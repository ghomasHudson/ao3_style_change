“Then we had that talk, and you made me admit what I’d been afraid of the whole time: it wasn’t that I couldn’t read you. It’s that I didn’t want to. Because I was attracted to you, and that didn’t read as a good thing. I didn’t wanna be attracted to some uptight former Marine who took issue with everything I did. But I was. And I hated it until I faced it.”
"Just a history?" Sam prompts, desperately wanting Gabriel to say "yes" whether or not it's a lie. As long as it's convincing, he'll believe it because
And Castiel, always sensitive to the limits, stops tightening the ropes, tying the end off on the table’s leg with a strong, but quick release knot.
Clearly reading his completely obvious discomfort, Castiel does his best to put him at ease by turning the focus to himself. He’s always been really good at that. “I would like to explore both a romantic and sexual relationship with you, Dean,” he says plainly. “To be honest, if it were only sexual attraction, I’d be inclined to not pursue it at all. The risk to our working relationship wouldn’t be worth it. However, feeling how I do...” he knuckles over his heart absently with a distant look.
those of you who have been following along for eight months since the beginning of this. I love you all. I can't even tell you how much your comments and support have meant to me. This fic was a long process, and as of this last post, my longest fic ever. I never would have had the steam to finish it without your constant support and snot crying and beautiful key banging comments. Thank you!
Castiel shrugs as he passes by to but his burden down on the prep table and preheat the large toaster oven. While that's working, he turns to Dean. "Red wine would be good with this, unless you don't drink it?"
Dean thinks he says, “please,” but through the rushing in his ears, it might have only been a thin whimper. It doesn’t matter because Castiel gets the idea.
Sam rolls up Dean's silverware in a napkin before handing it off to him, touching it as little as possible before setting places for Jody and himself. "You're seeing him Saturday, right?"
Since Benny ordered, delivered, and took the time to set the food up, he’s given first pick. Dean’s shoved to the end of the line since he’s well-known for never leaving enough of his favorites for anyone else to share.
“There wasn’t anything to ‘patch up,’“ Castiel informs him, air quotes and all. “We simply needed to come to a better... understanding.”
"Well, that and imported Japanese toilets," Castiel answers with a mischievous gleam in his eye. "Does the lasagna need to be reheated too?"
“Well, now, that means you’re married,” Missouri finishes. “By the authority given to me by the State of Texas and the Powers That Be, I pronounce you married husbands. Y’all can kiss now.”
been waiting today. He's done other things, too. Passing the time since this is the sort of waiting that doesn't require sitting still. He's not a big fan of that kind of waiting. Productive waiting is fine. That's what he's doing. Been doing. Getting a little tired of doing.
Castiel smiles. “Right. It sucked. After that, I did what I could away from the animals. You can’t be sad if you don’t get close enough to bond.”
He flips on the water a little hotter then he prefers and plugs the drain. Then he goes to the sink to grab Castiel’s bath bombs. They’re green tea and smell nice. Castiel swears that they help him wake up more, but Dean remains dubious. He uses his imported bath salts all the time, but they’re the opposite of invigorating. He tosses one of the bombs into the tub, letting it sizzle and turn the water a light, milky green.
After more tests, and more exams, Dr. Barnes comes back before dinner, flipping through Dean’s file, face pinched. Castiel stands immediately, and Sam drops his feet from the coffee table.
“No!” Sam protests loudly. “Hell, no! I mean, if it works for you and makes you happy, I got nothing to say about it at all! No judgement here. But can’t you like... use that?”
Sam deflates a little, wavering. "I know you hate it when I bring this up, but it doesn't stop me from feeling inadequate."
He looks so genuinely concerned that Dean's heart thuds. He scrubs his palms on his thighs. "No," he says far too quickly. He clears his throat. Makes an A+ attempt to sound casual, and ends around a C-. "No, it's just... uh... an orgy? Come on."
Sam takes his time eating, flicking his gaze up to Dean every now and then until Dean, still with eyes on his plate, sighs. “What’s with the looks? You got something to say?”
Dean crosses his ankle over his knee, sinking down into the comfortable couch cushions. "Go for it."
Dean takes the lube and adds a generous amount to his aching dick, wiping his hands and then angling Castiel’s legs around his thighs. “You don’t have to give this to me if you’re not ready. I know we’ve done it before, but...” But Castiel had had full control of it that time.
Castiel startles. “What?” He looks so shocked and offended that Dean nearly laughs. But he doesn’t because this has been their biggest contention for a long time. And nothing about it is funny. As much as Dean’s attracted to Castiel, he can’t bring himself to be with someone who thinks of living things as disposable objects. He so badly wants to be wrong.
Ugh, stress eating. This is what he's been reduced to. Damn Castiel and his trust in all things from sting-y bees to weirdos who order boring coffee every day for their whole lives. Damn himself for being such a soft nougat soul encased in a jawbreaker-hard shell. Damn Dean Winchester for being so hot and probably good for Castiel on just enough levels to be bad for him later. Damn Sam Winchester for being... He cuts that thought off, chomping down on a bear claw while stomping back to the checkout line.
Dean makes a dissenting hum. They cross the threshold into the bathroom where Dean releases Castiel's hands to turn on the shower. "Well, it sounds like you're asking me something when you'd rather be telling me something instead. I'm a pro at that, so I'd know."
A small shrug of one shoulder. "It's okay," he repeats. "Look, Cas, if we're gonna be in this, the things I do... who I am, it
“My husband,” Castiel murmurs, touching Dean’s bottom lip. The old word sounds really, really new tonight.
Sam trails down to Gabriel’s dick, stroking it to full hardness and then using his lubed hand to pump himself a few times. “I’ve always thought you were sexy. I don’t care if you’re soft around the edges.”
Gabriel shakes his head. Slowly, he says, "I think you don't always realize when you're running on empty yet. And while you're getting yourself squared away, I wanna be here to fix whatever I can."
Rolling his eyes, Castiel places the tray on his lap. "Thank you for lunch. And you're not worth the trouble of me possibly ruining my life over in order to prove a point."
"And you're right," Dean admits, mostly because he wants to see Castiel looking so tentatively happy some more. "I'm not going home for Thanksgiving. I don't mind it, though. I think it's kinda cool when the whole city is a freaking ghost town."
Then he's finally on his way home. Immediately, he strips off his clothes, tosses them into the washing machine, and jumps into the shower. It probably won't do much good after the germ soup he'd sloughed through to take care of Castiel, but in the end, he considers it a small price to pay to make sure that the people he loves are taken care of when they won't take care of themselves. The list is too damn short these days. He'll do anything for the ones he's got left.
Every muscle Dean can feel against him goes taut. Voice strained as hard as his body, Castiel gasps, “yes, Dean! Please!”
"'Morning," Dean rumbles back. He rests his weight further against his omega, and goes still. He actually starts snoring lightly again.
show up, we can catch him now, rather than having to stay on high alert indefinitely for his next chance. Plus, security is much tighter here than alternative places.”
“A worthy place to be.” Castiel reaches into his back pocket to get his cell phone. He reads the message on his screen and sighs. “Anna needs me.”
Before he can overthink it, Dean's hand flies out. He knows it's trembling awfully. He knows it's sweaty. He knows it's cold. He knows it's the complete opposite of ten minutes ago. But Castiel takes it without hesitation and holds on.
Sam is about to slide into the seat beside Dorothy, but is stalled by the booming voice of the DJ. "The man of the hour has arrived!" he calls good naturedly.
“I can do that,” Castiel says firmly. “Whether you know it or not, you pretty much just defined exactly what a healthy BDSM relationship is built upon.”
This time, Castiel's first tip-off is about thirty minutes after waking up on a Saturday. Dean shuffles into the kitchen, barely awake. He slides up behind Castiel and plants a series of butterfly kisses across the back of his neck. Smiling, Castiel reaches back and ruffles Dean's sleep-matted hair. "Good morning," he murmurs.
to Sam. With a cold thrill of horror, Dean recalls Sam’s parting words. What he says to nearly everyone.
"For what you did," he says with false lightness. "That's... you're still doing everything for me. Putting me first."
Sam resists rolling his eyes only barely. "Well, that's fine with me. I'm only trying to graduate with the best grades I can get."
pouring into him via Gabriel's mouth, fingers, tongue, trembling voice; it's manna from heaven. It's brain chemical ambrosia that forces him to a level of euphoria previously unknown to him. A level that he almost destroyed himself a few years ago failing to meet. It was here all the time. And it's
It's still true, though. He needs to talk to someone about this. So he departs campus and goes to the only place he's ever received any worthwhile advice.
In an effort to pull focus away from his brother’s turmoil, Dean asks, “what d-d-did the email that Charlie flag-g-gged say?”
Carefully, Castiel lowers himself onto the center of the bed, crosses his legs, and breathes out deeply.
Finally freed, Castiel makes a cry of triumph and hauls Dean up, cupping his face, eyes dark with shame and concern. “What happened?” he demands, quietly but frantic. “Talk to me. What happened, Dean? How can I help?”
Sooner than expected, or maybe not since Dean’s lost all concept of time, Castiel is rolling his hips faster and faster, gasping and moaning, louder and louder. His dick throbs, and Dean may not know how long they’ve been at it, but he knows when Castiel is getting close. He feels Castiel’s thighs tighten on either side of his head, and on his next thrust, Dean sucks hard and swallows. Castiel shouts and yanks on Dean’s hair painfully this time, coming hard onto the back of his tongue and down his throat. Dean drinks it all eagerly.
It feels different to Castiel. Even as his pleasure intensifies the further he goes. Dean’s weight isn’t even on his legs anymore. His right leg is heavier against his lower back, and there’s no dig of a heel from the left. Different. But also exquisite. Once fully sheathed and braced panting against Dean’s chest, he takes a moment to center himself. Tonight isn’t the night to only look to himself and his inability to make it last.
of pressure. Of course, Castiel has no idea what it will cost Dean to even pursue a friendship, but damned if the guy doesn't make him want to try. "Thanks, Cas," he says. He stands, Castiel following a moment later. "I'll text you, okay?"
, all right. It's fine, Sammy. I didn't invite Cas over here last night to see if I could fuck him. It was some spur of the moment decision. We drank a beer. Hung out in my room with all our clothes on. If you really wanna hear the truth, I was kinda testing him."
"Exhausting," Castiel adds, shoulders slumping. His eyes come up again. "I can't believe I'm even talking to you about this," he says wryly.
. There’s not a one among us who can cook like that,” Dean says. “Don’t complain, or you’ll go to bed without dinner, young man.”
“That’s a relief,” Dean answers, some of the tension draining from his shoulders. “See you on the flip side?”
Gabriel shudders. "It ain't like that, either. He deferred a few years, and is just coming back. He's typical graduation age, actually."
Slowly, entire body strung taut, Castiel lowers himself onto Dean’s hard dick. His internal muscles quiver before they loosen, and he pauses frequently, panting and groaning softly. Dean holds himself as still as he can, only bracing against Castiel’s thighs with his hands. Waiting, overwhelmed with the pleasure of it. The promise and the reward when Castiel is seated completely; filled. A bead of sweat rolls down his temple and Dean watches it with fascination.
Carefully, Castiel lowers himself onto the edge of the bed opposite the wires and tubes sustaining his husband, and for the first time since the accident, gets a good look at his face. It’s hard to do. So very hard. His head is bandaged completely, the left side of his face mangled with stitches and scratches. He’ll have scars for sure, though Castiel is fairly certain that Dean won’t mind, and Castiel himself certainly doesn’t. It won’t be so bad once the extensive bruising goes down, he tells himself.
Castiel opens the gate for them when they’re finished. He’s smiling broadly. “They should use you both to make tourist brochures,” he says with almost-embarrassing sincerity.
It’s the first non-job related thing Castiel has said to him in a week, and it’s like a welcoming blast of fragrant summer air. Dean grins and glances across the lot to where Castiel is lounging against the Impala, sipping a can of Coke. “Someone had to since you’re too lazy to do it.”
Wordlessly, Castiel also passes Sam the letter. He’s sure that Dean will be upset when he finds out that Sam’s read it, but now isn’t the time to think about that. There’s an entire future at stake. And despite the fact that they’re married, Dean knows his brother better than Castiel does in a lot of ways. A lifetime with a sibling will do that. Therefore, Castiel is counting on Sam to have some insight that might be helpful to counteract the absolute hopelessness that’s been rapidly overtaking everything else in Castiel’s head.
Castiel huffs out an incredulous laugh. "Of course I want to make out with you. I want to do a lot of things to you and with you."
Castiel had deflected Dean's humiliation with a joke. Like this is no big deal. Like he honestly doesn't mind and isn't trying too hard to make himself not mind.
? Dean can't handle that. If he has to handle that, he's positive he'll do something stupid, like kiss the tears away.
At least it’s making his aim better. The first target is still as shaky as his previous attempts, but the frustration makes him more focused, so that the second and third hit much closer to where they should; holes clustered right through the target’s black heart. It feels pretty damn good after a while.
"Yeah, thanks," Sam says, really wishing she'd just stay. She seems like the kind of person who has things like hidden knives on her person. She'd be a good ally, if not for killing someone, then for his peace of mind. Too bad that ain't the way of the world. "See ya." Resigned, he drops into a chair and starts sifting through the books that are in front of him. Meg was right about the mess. There don't appear to be any real themes or order to the stacks. They're all religious studies, sure, but other than that, there's every genre.
Dean sees them in his peripheral vision. He inclines his head to signal them to stay back. “You’re surrounded,” he tells Michael. “D-d-don’t do anything stupid.”
“What should I d-d-d-do?” Dean asks suspiciously, though the inferno of anger is fading to embers rapidly now that he’s getting at least the promise of what he needs.
He wishes that Dean would reach out and touch him - give him any sign that they’re crawling back from the brink, but he doesn’t. “I appreciate the apology,” Dean says eventually.
Dean holds up a hand and Sam dutifully stops his usual tirade of support and appeasement before it hits the launch button. It's a knee jerk reaction now, but he still hates that Dean cares so much about the emotional heavy lifting. Sam's actually good for that part. He
“You’re more than welcome to stay as long as you like,” Castiel is saying. “There’s plenty of room. Are you staying for Christmas? Please stay for Christmas.”
Castiel nuzzles into the short hairs on the back of Dean’s neck. “I know you won’t believe me, but I’m going to tell you truth, anyway. You did all the right things today.”
. Like he wants to be served without an ulterior motive. He doesn’t wish to make Dean feel lesser or embarrassed. He’s craving the pampering as much as he does his headstrong husband becoming his pliant and willing sub.
The prep feels like it goes on forever, but then abruptly only feels like a second when Dean is removing his fingers. "You're ready."
Bobby’s head peeks around the door and he lets out a long whistle. “Looks like I’ve taught you well,” he says approvingly, and full of envy.
"I will," Sam says, and not just as a platitude. Maybe it's hardwired into his DNA by now to do what his teachers and professors say, but he
“Yeah,” Dean says slowly. “You don’t ever come to the competitions. Surprised you saw my run yesterday.”
Dean rests his good arm over Castiel’s shoulder, sifting his fingers through the hair on the back of his head. “Y’know, I can’t even remember why I didn’t like you. Feels like a million years ago,” he says with a starry-eyed grin.
Glancing around with a twist of his lips, Sam mutters, “with an... inordinate amount of soft surfaces to have sex on.”
Sensing this, Dr. Barnes motions for them to sit and they all do. Castiel takes Dean’s hand, but his eyes don’t leave the surgeon. “You think it’s a lost cause.”
treasure these moments the most. When Dean finally lets go of everything. Feels whatever Castiel wants to elicit in him. Responds to it. Asks for it. There’s no bluster or bravado. Dean can chest thump with the best of them, but with Castiel he’s learned that there’s no shame in being open. No reason to think that being a man is negated by being stripped raw. This is the breadth of their love and the strength of their commitment to each other. It’s painted over Dean’s body. Etched into his skin.
“Your media guru is pretty amazing,” Jody says, impressed. “If she ever wants something else to do...”
Gabriel uses Sam's arm for balance as he removes his shoes. "Yeah, yeah, it'll cool down in a few. I have the thermostat set on a schedule for Loki. Cats like it warm, so when I'm not here, might as well give him what he wants instead."
Castiel shimmies his hips down. “Take the plug out, Dean.” He arches his back, pressing his hips more firmly against Dean’s. “Make me
Of course, he wouldn't wear clothes he hated, or drive a lame car, but he knows how he seems. He likes it, in a way. People look at him, his job, his hobbies, and they think he's some cowboy wishing for the bygone days. That he's confident and sure of everything. That he'd sooner throw a punch before talking it out.
Dean grits his teeth so hard they squeak. It takes him a moment to unclench enough to answer. "Just need a minute," he mutters. "Please."
He also doesn't seem to notice that Dean has suddenly and ineffable, fallen for him just a little bit more.
He also needs to get better at hiding his emotions because Nick sees it, and grabs on. "I can see that spark in there, Sammy. Right now. Just. Y'know. Give it a think. Let me know."
to prove something, right? Many of the articles had mentioned that sometimes safe people aren't even aware of being one. Especially those who are a part of a daily routine by rote. Like a preferred customer service representative at a favored restaurant or store. Exactly like Castiel. He had worked around Dean's rituals without fuss and without even knowing it, and that consistency had led to Dean considering Castiel a safe person to deal with. Someone who doesn't immediately trigger anxiety or catastrophic thoughts.
"You're gonna be awesome, Sammy," he says with an unreadable expression that makes Sam's skin crawl. "Just don't let anything - or anyone - get in your way. All it takes is one bad apple to ruin a lot of futures, you know what I mean?"
Luckily, Dean seems to be of the same mind. He holds his arms open and Castiel walks right into them because that's where he needs to be at this very moment.
Of course, thinking and doing are two different things. Dean manages to convince Lisa to extend the invitation to Tran Bionics, claiming exhaustion and speech trouble. Probably knowing he’s lying, but also not wanting him to renege on the offer, she takes the lead.
Dean jumps up, shoving Castiel in the chest with a snort. "Enjoy your blue balls. I'll bring you clothes. Towels are on the shelf."
He’s not really sure how to bring it up, though. Not sure how much leeway he’ll have for suggestions over the course of the day. He waffles about it until the solution offers itself in a stroke of luck, or in this case, spilled orange juice.
He’s definitely broken, but not by Dean. Not because of Dean. It’s because he hasn’t been fighting hard enough to get out of his head and see the reality and the trauma as two separate things. Blaming himself for Dean’s trauma. Insisting that Dean is better off without Castiel trying to ruin their lives further.
Squirming, Castiel says, “you’re much more a man of action. If this will help you feel how equal we truly are, it’s okay.”
It’s the go-ahead he’s been looking for. Castiel grabs a handful of Dean’s hair at the crown of his head, yanking up hard. Dean’s head snaps back and he moans harshly, held fast, the fire in his scalp almost making him come right then.
Castiel folds the letter back up. Creases it with his thumbnail. Sets it gingerly on the bed beside him. Then he picks up the envelope and upends the stapled papers into his lap. Reads every word of them.
known. If he goes missing, there will be a lot of very expensive lawyers passing money around for a lot of high profile investigations. You won't get away with it."
There’s no time for that shit. Castiel slams him down against the table, Dean’s breath knocked out of him with the forceful contact. His eyes shine with dangerous mirth when he recovers his breath. “That’s more like it,” he murmurs. He’s already hard.
And he loves it. The three weeks before his heat are like a honeymoon. Not that Dean isn't the perfect husband and mate on normal days, but a couple of times a year, it all intensifies.
“I’m glad to hear it.” She squeezes his arm and releases him. “I’ll stick with him until he’s ready to fly the coop.”
Therefore Castiel attempts to keep his touches perfunctory since they have a ways to go. Of course, Dean has become a much more experienced bottom so he relaxes himself and opens much more quickly than he used to. He feels heat on his jeans and then the unmistakable sting of Dean’s teeth digging into his thigh.
There’s no one in the kitchen when Castiel arrives, so he’ll have to fend for himself. He’s not a very talented cook, though for whatever reason, he makes perfect toast. He’s also good at coffee. His eggs probably wouldn’t kill anyone, but he’s set the smoke alarm off one too many times to attempt it. Honestly, he’s afraid that if he takes too long, the tentative good morning he’s found with Dean will go up in smoke faster than his scrambled eggs. It’s not a charitable thought, but still possible.
Gabriel laments silently. And he holds himself back until all of the papers are turned in and the room is cleared. Then he sorts through the stack until he reaches Sam's paper.
Castiel doesn’t back down from the yelling, or the fact that Dean keeps assuming that Castiel can read his mind. As unfair as it is, he knows it’s not really about him at all. He knows Dean. He knows how to deal with his emotional turmoil. He stands firm, stoic, and it kind of breaks Dean’s heart. “I do,” he says when Dean’s full attention is on him again. “I understand that you have always taken Sam’s health and safety personally, and that’s what you’re doing here, even though inherently, you recognize that this isn’t something you could control.”
“Oh,” Castiel says. His eyes roam up and down Dean’s body, causing the cowboy a moment of irrational self-consciousness. “Dean, you look... um.”
He's home barely in time. Doesn't bother to wait for the garage door to open all the way to pull the Impala inside. Instead he throws it into park, yanks the keys out of the ignition, and then dives under the opening door in a clumsy crouch. The tingling is getting worse and his whole body is starting to shake. He yanks the inside door open, sprints up the stairs, and makes it to his bathroom just in time to say goodbye to his breakfast. At least it wasn't much.
But once it is, Sam leads the way inside. "So, how do we really talk about your day without either of us feeling like an asshole?"
It’s useless to sleep with his mind running through endless scenarios of varying degrees of catastrophe, so Castiel figures he might as well be productive.
Dean nods, knowing his own voice would be nothing if he tried to speak. He secures his hat, taps the heels of his boots against the wall to make sure they’re secure, and climbs the rail to the bucking chute. Benny’s on the other side, grinning wickedly at him. “Good luck, brother,” he says.
It's worth the risk. He needs to be sure that tonight doesn't so much as lend him the possibility of anything else bad happening. A little more peace. That's all he's asking for. Maybe not all he needs, but if it's all he gets, he'll take it. It's worth it. So he watches the scenery pass as Gabriel drives them home, and he breathes. Just breathes.
“Baby is why,” Castiel says with an oddly thick hitch to his voice that makes Dean unconsciously scoot towards him.
Finding nothing but sincerity, and knowing that time is of the essence, Dean relents. “Fine. Yeah. You’re right. Okay, let’s g-g-go. Ord-der up.”
It’s not ten seconds later before Dean is coming too, sobbing moan lost in Castiel’s mouth when he collapses down for a kiss. It makes him tremble. Makes him complete. And tomorrow it’ll be forever.
It's Castiel's turn to shrug. "When you build a dream from the ground up, it's difficult to step away. There's always the concern that if I'm not there to nurture it at every step, it'll all fall apart."
“What the fuck?” Dean demands as he hops backwards. Incredulously, he watches his horse whine and snuffle against Castiel’s chest until he’s nearly knocked off his feet, laughing softly and petting her lovingly. “What the hell is this betrayal?”
That certainly sours some of Dean’s ardor. “Dude, I’m hardly that weak-minded. And even if I wasn’t, sex isn’t a lifetime commitment.”
Instead of answering, Sam taps her on the arm and nods over his shoulder to indicate it's time for them to order. Charlie pays for all of their drinks, brooking no argument.
“Soon as we can,” Sam answers, turning from the stove with the skillet to plate them up their breakfast. “Since you’re still refusing to fly, it’ll take about twenty hours to get to Bozeman. Bobby called and said he’ll get there this afternoon with Baby. Plenty of time to get her settled at the stables and ready.”
At least today, Gabriel appears to be more agreeable than usual. He sits across from Castiel, fiddling with the handle of his mug. Castiel waits him out, expecting another foolish weekend embarrassment at the club or a spat with Nick Pellegrino since Gabriel's been working those themes lately. Therefore he is wholly unprepared to hear, "Cassie, we need to get while getting's good because something is seriously wrong with Sam and Dean Winchester."
“Do you swear upon threat of perjury that the statement you are about to give is both true and accurate, to the best of your knowledge?”
Dean holds up a hand as Castiel reaches for the door. “There are some things you can’t b-b-be b-b-blamed for. Hitting on that piece of ass? I’d’ve been proud of you!”
Dean falls back on his ass, shaking uncontrollably. He feels like he might be sick. Suddenly he realizes that he is freezing, starving, can't see shit in the darkness, and somehow
“I am,” Sam confesses. Castiel has always appreciated the straightforward honesty between them. That’s one of the things that has kept their friendship more solid than any he’s ever had. Also, Sam worries about the people he cares for as much as Castiel does, and that common bond has carried them through a lot together. “Do you ever feel like you wasted that Stanford education?”
Sam laughs again and Jo pokes her brother-in-law on the shoulder with her bare toes. "Can I have an advance copy?"
Castiel's brilliant blue eyes widen and a beaming smile dawns on his face. "That's music to my ears. Have a seat and I'll join you in a minute."
“Yes,” Castiel agrees. “He needed us to know that he’s constantly following Sam’s progress through the world.”
Dean stands with his brother and drags him into a tight hug. "I'm not actively looking for the end, okay? But you've got a life, and I'm proud of you. I'm
Dean sighs, polishing off the last of his hot drink. "You hate doing this for me, as much as I hate doing it at all. I'm sorry you're stuck with me."
Gabriel's not sure whether to be thrilled or worried. He goes for neutral. "Wanna tell me about it?"
It's part of the appeal. Less and less of the appeal as he gets to know Sam better, but for once he's glad for his terrible personality. He'd be lying if he said that he hadn't been thrilled to find his clubbing flirt victim in the classroom. It's the vast majority of the reason he'd considered continuing the flirting in the first place.
"Little bit of this, little bit of that," Charlie answers in her most secretively blase tone. "It'll be fun, though! And legal. In case you were gonna be all lame and worried."
“I wasn’t,” Sam answers shortly, nodding for Benny to get the car started. Benny jumps forward and wades his way into the driver’s seat, gunning the engine while still in park. It has the effect of scattering some of the people. “Please. I’ll issue a statement when there’s more information, but I’m asking that you please respect my privacy at this time. Thank you.” He dives into the back seat, yanking Gabriel along with him.
Castiel hums in the back of his throat. “Obviously I was never injured like you, but... there was a time when I was overseas...” He trails off, not sure that he should continue. He knows that there’s no such thing as the Suffering Olympics, but his experiences do still pale in comparison to Dean’s.
Nick laughs again, the sound like nails on a chalkboard to Sam's ears. "True enough. We're all adults now, and this isn't a large town, so we're bound to run into each other on occasion."
She's right, Dean knows that. She's always right about these things. Too bad his brain and his coping skills have a hard time agreeing with each other sometimes. Still, he gets a blue lollipop for his troubles.
"I noticed," Castiel says with a small smile. He backs up a few steps, puts on fresh gloves, and grabs for a cup on the middle of the stack like always. "Usual?" he asks, already moving to make it.
They’re tangled and warm, and it’s spectacular. They come almost at the same time, shaking through their release, painting Dean’s hands with it. They don’t even have to move that much to reach the tissues to clean themselves up with. Afterwards, Dean holds Castiel against his chest, running his fingers through his soft brown hair until the man melts against him like a chocolate bar left in the sun. Despite that, though, he’s being suspiciously quiet. And still.
Dean drapes the shirt over his shoulder, then digs around a handful of other bags, pulling things out. "Bet you will," he mutters. He grabs a few options and then tumbles off the bed and shuts the door to the bathroom behind him. He takes longer to get dressed than he ever has in his life. The only thing he can decide on right away are the artfully distressed jeans. He tries on all the undershirts. The white isn't enough. The robin's egg blue seems too loose across the chest. The sea green looks good, though. Brings out his eyes, maybe. He tugs on the overshirt, gives himself a thorough once over, feels like something's missing, but he looks damn good, anyway.
“You’re really embracing that retirement mentality,” Sam chuckles. “Come on. I made that sludge coffee you like. That’ll perk you up in no time.”
In the interest of germs, Dean serves himself first, and keeps the portions small. A sort of ambient nausea has been plaguing him since he'd squared things with Castiel, and it makes him as uneasy as anything else. But he'd swore to himself that he wouldn't leave Castiel out in the dark again, and this is another step in the process.
As they check in, Dean’s eyes flick from one location to the other, and he doesn’t move from his post at the edge of stage left, facing the audience. “Keep the lights at half,” he says. The information is relayed to the convention crew, and the house lights dim, but don’t go out completely like they had for some of the other panels.
Dean snorts. Sam laughs loudly, thinking it’s a great joke. Dean watches Gabriel, knowing it isn’t. Sam figures that out quickly, too. His eyes pop wide. “Are you
stop me from having two phones. This one is on during normal office hours only. If you call or text or email during me time, I'll ignore you, hate you, and/or drunk text you at three in the morning with something completely useless."
Gabriel laughs a little at the assessment. “There’s that.” Then his amusement fades. “But there were also my selfish reasons. It wasn’t total symbiosis.”
Dean only half pays attention to the film; despite appearances, he’s not all that into mindless action movies, but he’s comfortable. Truly happy and content for the first time in a long time, only noticing the absence of it once he realizes that he’s got it again. It’s amazing. He loves these people. Charlie and Castiel brought something to the lives of two orphaned brothers, and he feels like he’ll never be able to repay them. Not that they’d ever ask him to. Castiel’s warm hand splays out against his shoulder blades, rubbing gently. It lulls him to semi-consciousness, perfectly fine just to drift in the moment.
“He’s worth flagging,” Castiel agrees. “I’ll note in the file for Charlie to prioritize looking for more letters every time she gets another shipment.”
Castiel laughs a little, and Dean gets the distinct impression that he’s laughing at himself. “I realize I don’t come off as the type of person who is usually involved in rodeos.”
Sam snorts a tiny laugh. "Just metaphorically. Being in the same room with him sorta... sucks my soul away."
Castiel takes four steps around the island so that they’re facing each other on the same side, only a few feet apart. “Were you?”
"Is Sam all right?" Castiel asks in a rush. "Your brother? Gabriel was extremely concerned about him today, and frankly, he was also worried about you when you were at the cafe the other day. He told me that you... seemed upset when I wasn't there."
"I've been accused of it once or twice," Castiel agrees. "Both Gabriel and Hannah have been bothering me for at least a year to take more time off."
“Glad you think so,” Sam returns. “It means you have to listen to me when I tell you to go to bed early. Benny will kick your ass if you’re yawning tomorrow.”
"You really are sensitive to the cold," Dean chuckles, tucking himself in and immediately getting an armful of Castiel trying to leech his body heat.
Castiel pauses, spoon halfway to his mouth. He blinks up at his best friend. "This is about you not wanting to get involved?"
“And you’re probably the best at what you do in the entire United States,” he continues exhaustedly.
"Hell, no it's not," Dean scoffs. "Hardest thing ever. But, I've learned how to do it my way. It's just not as second nature as it is for people like you."
Dean chuckles. That’s been a saying in their household for years from everything from the common cold to now, broken bones. “Get some more sleep. I’ll finish up packing.”
Then, after class on a Friday before a three day weekend, he waits for Dean to finish packing. They stand together and Castiel hesitation makes Dean hesitate in return. "What's up?" he asks.
He stares unblinking at the smirking DJ. In the spotlight, Sam gets an eyeful of sandy hair, hazel eyes, thin features, and a hell of a lithe, small frame packed into a white dress shirt. Sleeves rolled up his forearms, black vest opened, a fedora perched carelessly on his head. The whole hipster vibe combined with the startlingly unconventional good looks does something to Sam that hasn't been done in long, long time. He wants a piece of that. If only briefly. If only because of the euphoric atmosphere.
you?!" Dean sputters, going for indignation since anything else is slightly impossible at the moment. "When was the last time you
Dean drags his leg up over the arm of the chair, slouching as much as humanly possible. He’s as physically exhausted as Gabriel is mentally exhausted. Two peas in a weird pod today. “Yeah, pretty sure you took to hiding for the same reason I did. But considering how ready you were to throw Ruby at Sam before, I don’t get why you’re holing up now that they did it on their own.”
Dean grinds Lucifer’s cheek against the cold surface harder. “Why?” he demands, voice lower and more deliberate. “You think I’ve overstepped somehow?” He glances up dangerously at his husband and then Victor. “Have I?”
He pinches Castiel's nose, blocking the airway, draws in all the air he can hold, slots his mouth against Castiel's, summons up every bit of the stolen essence inside of him, and breathes out everything forcefully.
She grins, winks, and magnanimously says nothing about it as she gets him back on his feet and walking again. After a few more back and forths, she says, “why didn’t you go with them, anyway? It’s just a press junket. Only four days.”
Half of Dean just wants to make this last forever, and the other half is pinpointed on his baser nature, keeping it in check as it gnashes its teeth against his restraint. If he loses concentration, it'll be the end. But... but it feels
Dean complies, hardly able to go as deep as he wishes since breathing is getting quite difficult, but they manage for a while until Castiel cries out, close. So close. Dean taps their foreheads together, content to feel the hot breath on his face, and he moves faster, back bowing like a cat’s with each thrust, driving them up the bed.
Dean takes no offense. Not like he hasn’t thought the same damn thing before. “You’re making me b-blush,” he returns.
He doesn’t need this. Not now. Sam is injured, filming is set back half a day, and Castiel is in the wind. Well. In the wind enough for it to be really goddamn irritating. But if he wants to play the child, that’s fine. He can do that. He can assume shit up and down until he’s convinced he’s more right than anyone, then shoot off like a scared cat, but Dean ain’t gonna play that game. He can’t. He’s got a job to do, and a life to live, and if Castiel can’t understand him better than he has shown today, then fuck him.
Squeezing his eyes shut, he refuses to let the scenario play out in his head. "I'm doing what you want, brain," he mumbles. "Don't make me see it. I'm doing what you
That endearment again. It sounds... good. Castiel's lips part, jaw loose. And Dean paints over his lips with his leaking cock before slowly thrusting in. Castiel flattens his tongue, relaxes his throat. Eagerly takes the mouthful that Dean so nicely gives him. He could do this for hours, though there's something extra special about waiting until Dean's already close. He barely has to do anything besides enjoy the silky sensation of Dean pushing his dick to the back of Castiel's throat and then painstakingly withdrawing before doing it all over again. Once they'd discovered that Castiel had no real gag reflex to speak of, this had become a favorite staple of their sex life.
"Scandalous," Castiel teases. "Bed sounds nice, however, so I think I'll do that. I have a TV in my room, anyway."
“I d-d-don’t need things,” Dean protests, knowing that Castiel won’t be moved by his whining. He does it anyway. “I just need you.”
“You should get the water going, then,” Castiel says lazily. “And I’ll go get rid of these disgusting clothes.”
being able to handle you is. And, Dean?" He pauses, waiting until Dean is able to look up and meet his eyes. "I can handle you. I wouldn't have entered into a relationship with you otherwise. If it means never having the sexual component, I'm okay with that. To me..." His eyes turn up towards the ceiling. The smile never leaves. "To me, you're worth far more than your body. I'd never find sex to be more important than just having you any way that I could." He glances back down, easily meeting Dean's shocked gaze again. "I'm in love with you. That's the only thing that matters. If you let me have that, the rest is incidental. It always was."
have a reason," Donna reminds him. "He hates your boyfriend. At any rate, my suggestion is that you stick with it as long as nothing happens that causes you too much distress. There's no harm in calling it quits if the cons outweigh the pros. That's what being an adult is."
Slowly Dean starts to unclench. His body relaxes and he starts to chuckle softly, exhausted. "That was awesome," he says, collapsing onto his side.
And sure, with Sam, and at a certain point in his life many years before Sam, there'd been a time where he'd been devoted to romance and whatever love happened from it, but in between, he'd taken what he'd wanted when he wanted it. No strings, no misunderstandings, no hard feelings.
“‘Cause there’s no reason not to, honestly. Sam won’t take no for an answer. He does fine with the press, so I’m not
Castiel glances over his shoulder and sees the charger draped over the armchair by the wall. He takes the foot over to it and hooks it up, relieved to have it out of his clumsy grip. The LED lights blink slowly, and Castiel nods with satisfaction, returning to the bed.
, we learn about Gabriel's former bond, and it's implied that, because of the nature of his broken bond, he likely suffered severely. Thus, Gabriel would have been hospitalized until the severe symptoms were controlled with medication and therapy, then released to his family until he was well enough to care for himself.
Benny, slightly more spry than the rest, takes it upon himself to prepare their coffee. “Y’all need to quit your bitchin’. You threw down the gauntlet, and the price must be paid.”
“You only wish,” Sam teases. “Regardless, it’s a big deal. Anyway, go get dressed. We need to shove off. I’ll put the rest of the coffee in the travel mugs.”
Dean punches his brother in the arm, but goes into the trailer anyway. The doctor is friendly and the nurse is hot, so he doesn’t complain all that much. Fifteen minutes later, he’s got a clean bill of health. Just some bruises and a lot of congratulations on riding Larry and surviving. He exits the trailer with a handful of chemical ice packs and a growling stomach. “I’m starving!” he informs Sam loudly. “I want food!”
“You were moaning and thrashing around. I thought you might be having a nightmare, or in pain. Is there anything I can do?”
“Thank you,” Castiel breathes, gripping the base of his cock and positioning himself between Dean’s legs. “All it’s ever been is you and me.”
Dean takes Castiel's chin gently in his hand. So very carefully, he drags the tip of the lipstick across Castiel's top lip with trembling fingers. There's a shine to the shade, but it doesn't change the color of Castiel's lips very much overall. Understated. Just a small highlight to accent the beautiful parts of him, like the eye shadow. He paints Castiel's bottom lip, going a little too far. Blindly, he puts the tube back on the dresser. Transfixed, he touches the corner of Castiel's mouth to smudge away the excess.
The venue is a lot nicer than what he's used to and Dean eyes the marquee of the local historic theatre warily through the Impala's windshield. "What the fuck, Sammy?" he mutters.
Rocking back on his heels, Dean falls back on his ass. Scoffing, he says bitterly, "sure, it's okay. My body, my rules, whatever they are is o-fucking-kay. That doesn't mean it is with you."
Lisa breezes into the PT room bright and early, looking far more excited than Dean thinks she should have any right to be.
Castiel coughs so hard, coffee nearly comes out of his nose. He has to clear this throat several times and blow his nose twice before he can talk again. Hoarsely, he asks, "I beg your pardon?"
Castiel looks like he wants to eat Dean alive. “I love you,” he says heatedly, slipping Dean’s glasses from his face and daintily placing them on the bench.
Dean’s eyes widen in sudden recognition. “I remember her! Sam was pretty cut up when she d-d-d-dumped him.”
This is not a bond, but what happens when one is broken or being established. Pining sickness basically is a physical
"It is not!" Dean insists, making a grab for it."You said, and I quote," he pitches his voice deeper to mimic Castiel, "'Dean, your spring wardrobe leaves a lot to be desired. You need more color.'"
There, it's okay to react how he'd wanted to. He presses both hands over his face, surprised that his cheeks don't feel feverish. He's a goner. His heart is beating too fast to be healthy. Perhaps he drank too much coffee? Yes, he'll go with that. That makes the best sense. Otherwise he'll have to face the fact that Dean's affecting him more than he should be at this point. They've barely had a real conversation. And yet.
Dean’s hands dip under the water, left hand palming over Castiel’s hip, right hand thumbing over the head of Castiel’s half hard cock.
But then he remembers his dad. He and John Winchester hadn't always seen eye to eye. They'd butted heads just as often as they'd gotten along. Dean had managed quite well under John's penchant for bringing military rigidity into his parenting. At home, Dean had been the model son, only running buck wild when his father wasn't looking. Sam hadn't been capable of such patience around him. He'd saved most of his rebellion for home. The only time he'd felt like he could completely relax was at school. His friends hadn't expected anything of him. His teachers had been supportive. Dean largely ignored him during school hours. John had never hassled him about his grades. He even signed his report cards with pride.
The adoption process is quite involved. Children do not present their secondary gender until puberty, but all babies and young children respond to pheromones, and the potential parents
Sam doesn't want to know what that means, but the laughter that lights up the table has to be a good sign. At least, that's what he tells himself as he tosses back his second fruity drink, intent on pacing himself, but definitely requiring at least a mild buzz to convince him he's anything approaching a passable dancer.
He really wishes that he could stop crying for one damn day, but that's just not happening. It's got to show something about his character that kindness brings him to tears. "Thank you," he mutters sincerely.
"Nah," Gabriel assures him with a less-than-assuring fit of coughing and sneezing. "Onset was too slow," he wheezes once he recovers his breath. "My throat's been hurting a couple days and I've been tired. Thought it was just the weather changing and stress."
Dean brushes the thanks aside the same way that Sam had the jokes. "But in my professional opinion, I think you should fuck him first."
He doesn't know what to think about that. Which. Granted, is pretty normal when dealing with Gabriel Milton. It isn't a
“Cain suggested that we might start our joint recovery by re-establishing physical intimacy.” He hastens to add, “not sex yet, just touch,” when Dean immediately opens his mouth to point out Castiel’s former reticence. “I thought I could indulge you a little, if you like? I know how you enjoy an old fashioned shave. I’d... um... we could do something else, though.”
planned to wait a bit longer to ask him, but I just looked at him last night and thought, ‘I’d marry this man tomorrow.’ So I took the plunge, as it were. Dean and I are of the same mind in this regard.”
He dresses and makes sure he has everything he needs in his messenger bag before heading out for the day in the opposite direction of the university and to Espresso Lane.
That’s the tipping point. Castiel shoves his full weight against Dean, devouring his mouth with a kiss that overwhelms them both. He fists into Dean’s button down shirt at his shoulders, yanking so that Dean vaguely wonders if it might rip. He doesn’t give a shit. Not right now. He grabs handfuls of Castiel’s ass, holding him down, bucking up against him. The friction is delicious, as well as very reminiscent of his teenage years when he was too scared to do anything besides dry humping.
"Yeah," he returns sarcastically, "they just have to happen to be the guy who, by random luck, makes my coffee order for the first time and then gets stuck making it forever."
The contact is always the same, has always been the same, will likely always be the same. Castiel's unique text alert sounds and like some Pavlovian response, Dean immediately yanks his phone off of the nightstand to check it.
"The process is simple," Castiel mumbles to his lap, the whole situation profoundly embarrassing. "Sit behind me and use your hands to comb through the feathers. It will stimulate the oil glands and make them shiny. Don't worry if any feathers fall out. They're supposed to."
“I’ve already texted Gabe to find us somewhere quiet and relatively secluded, so you can’t back out now,” Sam says pointedly, clearly reading Castiel’s mood. “Benny’s got the car in the staff garage. The press won’t see us leave.”
Donna's eyebrows draw down and she mirrors Dean's stance, frowning deeply. "And have you taken even a split second to consider that some people
“What did you do?” he accuses over breakfast, which Dean refuses to attend while Castiel is in the room.
Castiel turns on his heel. They're both naked, but for a second, Castiel forgets the real reason that Dean is here. It's not for friendly conversation. "I'm counting the windows in here," he says.
“Yeah,” Dean grins into Castiel’s next kiss. “Ass o’clock is Sammy’s wakeup time, and don’t think for a
“Good stuff and weird stuff,” Dean shrugs. “Benny’s got the hookup to a great secure shredding place.”
Until a small sound starts to niggle at the corner of Dean's senses. He tries to ignore it, instead painting his fingertips over Castiel's stomach. The sound stops. Then it starts again.
to be touching someone again. Dean squeezes Castiel's fingers, probably too tightly. Neither one of them seem to be able to make eye contact anymore.
“Yeah,” Gabriel says wonderingly, completely ignoring the second part of the question. “How did that even happen? I mean, you’re prickly, but you’re not usually mean. That’s my gig. You’re supposed to be good cop.”
But Castiel has them back in position again in seconds, rutting together, grunting with the effort and exertion of the fast pace. It’s an incredibly animalistic sound.
"Yeah," Sam agrees. "I was... I wanted to ask again if you were like... actually interested in me. To date. Or. Whatever."
Cain folds his hands in his lap. “Since you’ve been the quick draw so far in regards to so many milestones, why is it so important to you that Dean be the brave one this time?”
"Cassie? Castiel?" Sam's eyebrows go up. "Why? He and Dean are... well," he snorts. "They're doing their best."
Fingers tangle with his, Castiel tugging their hands on top of his chest when he settles them side by side to cool off under the ceiling fan. "Yes."
to stay angry! Want to push us all away! Want us all to go on and replace all the spots you’ve filled!”
Dean wiggles over so that he can kiss his husband to shut him up. It works for once. “Wake m-me up.”
The slight stress of the word isn’t lost on Dean, who turns his back completely to tend to the scrambled eggs. Sam, however, misses it by a safe mile. “As long as we can have some more harmony when we’re on the clock, I don’t care how you do it,” he says sincerely. Dean smirks to himself. If he only knew.
The jolt that sent through Sam made tears spill out of his own eyes. "I'm sorry," he'd mumbled, tongue too heavy, lips too numb. "I'm so sorry." He'd said it a dozen times. It had seemed like the only words that were left in him for days. All the way through his release from the hospital and straight to a rehab program. He'd panicked, and Bobby had promised to stay with Dean. Had promised that he wasn't going anywhere.
For all he’s worth, Dean tries to close his eyes again, but his brain and his libido are not on the same page. His eyes feast helplessly on his Dom. There’s a reason he doesn’t involve himself in Castiel’s workouts, and this is why. Too much lean muscle and flexibility is hell, especially when he’s got a plug halfway in his ass.
"Good point," Sam mutters. His forehead hits down on the table. It's been doing that a lot lately. Maybe he should have brought a pillow.
? Isn't that a little too on point with the irony? Jesus. Then it stops. Must have been in his head?
And when he climbs out of the Impala, he doesn't feel like he's about to suffocate again. He pats her hood as he shuts the door. "Thanks for helping, Baby."
The words are almost enough to do it, but it doesn’t count when the smile stays almost completely in his eyes and the deepening crow’s feet around them. “You can try. What do you have in mind?”
Sam is also disproportionately thrilled that Castiel is going to go to the appointment. He promises to stay home and be good. Help Jack out with the house rules and generally not cause trouble. Dean sarcastically says the same while they get ready to go to the farmer’s market. Jack says he’ll watch out for everyone, and Dean simply leaves the room.
Dean sits beside him on the matching chair on the other side of the small table, strangely worried about him. It’s an entirely new response to the guy, and he’s not convinced he’s totally comfortable with it. So he clears his throat. “Dude, you missed lunch. We thought you’d gone somewhere. Sam texted you and everything.”
It shouldn't matter to Dean one way or another. In the end they all end up so drained they're either dead or as good as in ten more years, tops, but he's allowed some principles, isn't he?
“I can’t promise miracles, but I know what I’m doing. The hands we’ve made? Pretty sweet stuff. They’ve helped people do really dexterous tasks like knitting and playing the piano. And feet don’t even need that kind of delicate fine tuning. Walking? Running? Totally doable.”
He knows that. It’s just that he wishes sometimes that Lisa would go easy on him. That ain’t how she’s made, though. “Yeah,” he relents.
Recognizing the bravado for what it is, Castiel answers, “always.” He dips another hand towel in the water, squeezes it out and gently lays it over Dean’s face, eliciting a sigh from his husband. Then he arranges the rest of his tools on the bedside table, expertly mixing up the shaving cream. He’s never shaved Dean before, or anyone else for that matter, but Dean used to frequent a barber shop for a haircut and shave, so he’s familiar with the process.
“I’ve always believed in God,” Castiel corrects. “I’ve always been religious.” He turns his head to give Sam a questioning look. “Where do you think I go every Sunday morning?”
Thankfully, the show wraps exactly on schedule, and Dean motions to Sam to join him while Bela approaches the audience to distract them from hollering for autographs since Sam’s a sucker for those, too.
That’s all he needs to hear. Larry is a hell of a bull to ride. Larry is legendary. Larry’s had a grand total of five riders last more than five seconds. Only one made it to seven. No one’s done eight. Larry is the meanest son of a gun Dean’s ever watched, and thanked his lucky stars every year to only be in the stands for his runs. He’d hoped to hold that lucky streak until Larry was retired. Apparently, that was wishful thinking. Karma’s kind of a bitch that way.
Those hazel eyes slit further. "You sure you're not just with me to get at Castiel? That's much more his jam than mine."
Before anyone can settle in for a while to call Dean disgusting, there’s another round of moaning and groaning from Gabriel, Charlie, and Benny, all looking a little worse for wear after the reception.
“He was an asshole,” Dean says decisively, looking Castiel squarely in the eyes. “He spent his whole life running around the country with me and Sam in tow looking for the guy who set fire to the house. He never found him. All he did was slowly start to drink more, leave his kids in shitty motel rooms for days at a time, and expect me to be mom and dad to Sam. And whenever I screwed up...” He rubs his jaw in phantom memory. Shakes his head morosely.
Then Castiel shifts on his feet bringing their groins into contact, and Dean unconsciously bites down on Castiel’s neck with a loud moan at the feeling of Castiel’s obvious hardness against his.
“Agent Henriksen called this morning with an update on Lucifer Pellegrino.” He hates the way that Dean’s jaw muscle twitches at the mention of that man, but he spreads out on the bed, falls back against his pillow, and lets the ceiling fan cool him off. He nods, and Castiel continues. “He’s being extradited to Atlanta. You’re going to be called to testify.”
His elbow connects with something solid and there’s a pained grunt behind him, followed by a, “dammit, Cas!”
what I pay you people for,” Sam huffs good-naturedly, reappearing and carrying a stack of blankets that Dean immediately relinquishes in deference to his brother’s injury. He’s obviously only heard the last part of the conversation since he appears completely unbothered.
Dean slides onto his back lengthwise over the sofa, resting his head against the sofa’s armrest. “Not sure yet, but the sheer quantity of letters he’s sent in a single week makes me think we should work on identifying him. I dug through the mail archives and saw that this guy’s been sending stuff for nearly a year now. But we only really noticed now because he’s been gradually decreasing the time between letters. I’m not sure why he sent so many because when you put them together, it reads like one long letter. We won’t know if he’s going to try and escalate until we get more.”
"I won't," Castiel says with the smallest hint of warmth returning to his voice. "You being able to handle yourself isn't my problem.
Dean nods, resting his elbows on his knees. “Twenty-four hour lockdown,” he says. “It’s the only option. Half of Michael’s plan failed. He was hoping he’d-d-d-d get to Sam b-b-before we could secure him. Hoped his email would b-b-be the cherry on top.”
Instead of last, Sam is first this time, having somehow migrated to the front of the stage in the crowd's thrall.
Sam and Garth move to help her as she shoves condiments and trays into their hands. It's a really nice spread. Fruit and jams, crepes, two bowls of what looks like homemade whipped cream, and there's sliced whole grain bread already on the table.
“No,” Dean assures him, rubbing his temples, but the tension won’t be dispersed. “Not really.” He’s overthinking this, right? There’s nothing to be worried about. The whole world hasn’t figured out their situation. Like he cares about the world. Just Sam. And the way that things are going for him right now? He doesn’t need this on top of it. He’ll worry way too much.
," Gabriel corrects when he drags out a mournful moan from Sam avoiding his dick in favor of venturing down his firm thighs first. "If I didn't get to touch you all over and have you all to yourself, I'd probably be jealous of you with the perfect hair, and the height, and the body.
Gabriel looks down pointedly at the paper. "Well... Sam Winchester, since you don't got the confidence, guess it's up to me to determine your fate."
Dean corks the reliquary. The angel blade clangs to the ground. Dean's sweating hand presses over Castiel's on his neck. He tries to breathe but it comes out in a huge sob.
"Or your head up your ass?" Sam grins. He remembers those days well. Kind of likes having them back.
Castiel stalls the action with a tut. “Now, Dean,” he says in his matter-of-fact, dominating tone; all semblance of control restored in a flash. “Who’s in control of your pleasure right now?”
It’s even better when Castiel decides to take his time exploring his husband’s body. His mouth is something holy in its reverence until Dean feels sufficiently baptized by it. Especially when, no matter how ramped up their bodies get, Castiel’s ministrations remain tender. Even when the heat of his mouth closes fully around Dean’s dick, it doesn’t feel frantic at all. Dean feels both engulfed and adored. Then there’s the snap of a lube cap and Dean silently prays his gratitude that he’d cleaned himself properly that morning.
Castiel appears to be forgoing the politeness Dean has come to associate with him, in favor of not pausing for a second while eating. At least he isn't shoveling it in like a starving man, but Dean does actually appreciate the compliment. Castiel takes in every mouthful like it's the first bite ever. "I haven't since my divorce regularly. Gabriel comes over and cooks sometimes when he's bored or done something to anger me, and Amelia's cooking was good, but this is incredible. Did you go to culinary school?"
Thankfully, they’d checked into the flight early enough that it doesn’t take long for their luggage to appear.
And it's making focusing on his homework impossible for the time being. He shuts his laptop and gives up the ghost. He's caught up, anyway. He can take a small break. If only that small break wasn't being used to think about what Gabriel's lips would feel like against his. It's the most unproductive daydream of his life, but damn it's good.
Victor leans his elbows on the desk. “Because we went and had a chat with Michael recently, and he flipped on his brother. There was another actor about eight years ago, just like Sam, really. Michael was arrested for stalking, B&E, and assault. But he wasn’t the man under the mask. It was Lucifer, and Michael had enough of a story to check out, that if he’s being honest, we can charge Lucifer. Turns out, Michael isn’t too happy to take the fall again when we hinted that Lucifer would probably get a lighter sentence for this. He doesn’t want to serve more time.”
Castiel nods, sucks in air through his teeth. Hesitates like he feels the need to say something, but doesn’t want the reaction he’s expecting.
Belatedly he realizes that Lisa has stopped lifting his leg to stretch. He pushes up onto his elbows and levels her with a questioning look.
Sam doesn't point out that Dean's hands are raw and that all of the dishes in the cabinets have been rearranged. They know what happens when Sam points out the obvious. It's not beneficial to either of them anymore. They don't know all of the triggers for Dean's episodes. Nor do they know how to handle all of them properly, but they
Therefore, Sam is grabbing nepotism with both hands. TA's and professors have first pick of the study rooms. So, when Sam had kind of idly mentioned to Gabriel that the cloying atmospheres in the student center was making him more anxious, Gabriel had taken it upon himself to place a standing three hour reservation in "their" study room on the third floor of the library. He hadn't needed to go that far, though even he'd become pinch-lipped and annoyed when the librarians had given up trying to shush the masses of students in the main areas.
Too bad that Dean hears him from where he’s fixing his tie in front of the full length mirror attached to the back of their closet door. He peeks up at Castiel, not surprised to catch him staring and drawls, “problems there, sunshine?”
Lisa has arrived by the time Castiel makes it downstairs. She’s sipping a cup of coffee and showing Sam the pamphlets she received from Chuck. He looks like the new Christmas puppy going through them while Dean sits by with a bemused expression. Even Jack is impressed and asking question after question. Castiel plants a kiss on Dean’s temple as he passes by and murmurs, “wishing you were taking me instead now?”
From behind his back, Castiel pulls out a long length of rope. Dean blinks, but doesn’t say anything or move a muscle. He’s never seen this kind before. It’s plain, tan rope, and it looks incredibly scratchy. Really uncomfortable. It dawns on him slowly, that it’s probably the whole goal.
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. Takes a deep breath. It’s all in the past now. There’s no reason to get angry about it. It’s not like he was in love enough with Cassie to have been truly brokenhearted when they’d called things off. Still. It had been a damn dirty play on Castiel’s part. “So... you were responsible for firing Sam’s handler. Because you were jealous.”
What is Castiel like in a car? Does he get antsy being confined? Is he a free spirit who much prefers the open air? What temperature does he like it? Will he make Dean sweat to death, or complain about the heat? Will he inherit Sam's sour lemons look if the music is too loud? Will he fiddle with the tapes or complain about all classic rock all the time? Will he be a talker or prefer to contemplate the scenery quietly?
Dean leans into the touch for a moment and closes his eyes. And he allows the nurses to sedate him for the journey home.
“Yes, I would like to spend the rest of my life with Dean,” Castiel confirms, falling back on his biggest vice, which is formality. “If you would give us your blessing, of course. It occurs to me now that I should have asked for it first before proposing. I’m sorry.”
Gabriel places his laptop on the table and brushes his shaggy hair back into a small ponytail in an effort to buy himself time. His shoulders are tensed with Dean’s unexpected niceness. “Look, Dean-o, I know how you feel about me, so you don’t gotta do this. You probably already know what it’s about, anyway,” he says after a minute.
“I know,” Sam says with difficulty, having a hard time meeting his brother’s eyes. “You know why, right?”
The irrational anger spikes. Boils over. The lid was never going to stay on, anyway. In cold, seeping horror, he hears himself shouting, “the man I married wasn’t like this!
Castiel shakes his head. “Not like this. What I mean to say is, Dean’s looking much further out than where I am right now. What he said... it’s true that maybe I’ll only be able to relive the trauma forever. Maybe I won’t be able to get beyond it. I haven’t been trying for long enough to know. But I do know that I’m not in a place to say for sure what the outcome will be. And I also know that I don’t want to stay that way. Sam, I love Dean with everything in me. I can’t just let him go because things are hard six weeks after a life changing event. If I did... then I would deserve to be miserable forever.”
!" Jody yells, holding both of her hands out, palms up; one towards Dean, one towards Sam. "Zip 'em up and put 'em away. Now." She gives both brothers a quelling look, one after the other. Then she says, "Sam, pass me the ketchup. Dean, eat your vegetables."
Done with Dean, Cain turns to Castiel and shakes his hand with both of his. “Dean says I can buy you both a victory steak dinner after everything’s said and done here,” he says warmly.
"Not a problem," Castiel answers. He holds the cafe door open for Dean and directs him through the staff door to the kitchen.
Dean is already learning to love these walls of text. Especially when they're so freaking awesome. He likes all of those things, too. Or, well... he probably would like most of those things. And he used to like the rest when he was able to get out of his brain long enough to have a good time.
Sam sighs deeply, preferring to not delve into that particular wading pool of Gabriel’s grim determination. Instead, he thinks forward. “Two episodes. Sixteen days. Man, we’ll have to get Cas’s head out of his ass before then, or I’ll never be able to focus enough to finish filming.”
Of course, familial love only goes so far. When Lucifer had attempted to tie a host of other minor assaults and stalking charges to Michael after his arrest, Michael had caved. Now he’s about to be released.
Castiel takes a step forward. Falters. Puts a hand out, but aborts the movement at the last second. There’s nothing he can do to fix
They check each other over once more, and then it’s time to get the show on the road. The sooner they leave, the sooner this nightmare ends. “Are you sure I shouldn’t wear a tie?” Castiel asks uncomfortably.
Filming takes a hiatus for the holidays. Dean meets with Jody. Castiel is overwhelmed by the Winchester family Christmas.
The hand on his back urges him forward, which Sam is grateful for because holy shit, his whole being isn't cooperating with Gabriel around.
During his speech, Sam’s face had been easing back into cautious optimism. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
One of the cops holds up a hand. “If he knows his rights, he won’t let us hold him just because he showed up.”
"Morning sex sucks," Sam adds. "It's early and I have no energy, and then afterwards I end up falling asleep again, and then my sleep schedule gets screwed up, and then I have insomnia..."
He doesn’t understand why Castiel’s lack of reaction is so sexy. It shouldn’t be. He shouldn’t like seeing a lover hovering over him like Dean’s body on display has no effect. Like it could be anyone. Like Castiel doesn’t want him. But Castiel
“You can speak for a moment,” Castiel relents, feeling generous on their wedding night. “May I take a picture?”
Dean swallows hard, though he's pretty sure his face doesn't change expressions. Except for the tickling flush up the back of his neck. Jesus, tonight might just kill him for all unexpected reasons.
The man slings Dean's arm around his neck and guides him away from the site of his thwarted demise. Dean hopes he knows the woods well because there's no discernable path.
Dean presses a hand over the stabbing stitch in his side. "Not that I don't appreciate it, but like... do you have a phone or something? I can call 911. Get a doctor to square me away."
A flowered walkway leads to the front door with a security camera overhead and a line of labeled buzzers. Sam presses the one for 504 and holds his breath.
Dean shifts in his chair, feeling weird about having brought it up, but he can't deny the way that Castiel's straightforward confessions and personality give him a hell of a boost. "Good," he says roughly. "Same."
Dean bumps his shoulder against Castiel’s affectionately. “Whew, glad you only had a second of insanity there. I was about to get worried with all that flattery.”
Since Lisa is so helpful, and annoyingly right most of the time, Dean considers it. What harm could it do? Honestly, it would either help them, or rush along the worst case scenario. In Dean’s moments of clarity, he realizes that part of his blocking Cas out is selfish desire to prolong an undesired outcome. Of delving too deep and finally being told that it’s too much. That Castiel has hit his limit. That their relationship isn’t worth all this bullshit. That Dean isn’t the man he married anymore.
But he’s clearly not the only one in this predicament because Castiel’s hips lose their rhythm for a second, then he’s thrusting harder. Dean shoves himself to the very edge of the counter, and that’s the ticket right there. Castiel abandons the hand job in favor of latching onto Dean’s hips. He blinks up at Dean, lips parted, eyes glazed. Dean can’t stand not kissing him in that moment, so he does. It’s wet and messy and he can feel it in his very core.
But his Dom is having none of that. He slides out from under Dean, stands, and brushes his knees off casually. Dean would strangle him if his hands were free, but that’s exactly the kind of attitude that turns the pleasure into punishment. Tonight isn’t about that. So he stops and heaves in another deep breath.
Dean holds his hands out, palms forward like he’s placating. “Cas, man, it’s all your fucking fault, you know.”
Naturally he has to play along because that part is easy. He scoffs. "I'm always good for pie," he says with all the played up offense in the world.
Several silent minutes pass. Castiel rolls over, pressing his back firmly against Dean’s chest, slipping naturally into his embrace. He closes his eyes as Dean presses a small kiss against the back of his head and then begins to hum softly. The tune is familiar, but he can’t place it until the half-whispered lyrics of “Simple Man” slip from Dean’s lips lazily.
Sam pushes up off of the bed and approaches his husband-to-be. “Why wouldn’t I? I’m hoping this will be a once in a lifetime experience, marriage statistics in this country be damned.”
“You’re not a cop anymore, or a Fed,” Sam says. “You’re my bodyguard. And even though your job duties are similar, they’re not the same. You’re not the famous one, sure, but you’re still in the public eye. You still have to interact with the fans. And they’ve got camera phones. If something bad happens, it’ll be on YouTube in a second. What you need to do more of, is diffuse the situation, but your instinct is to treat everyone like a criminal. These are fans. They’re not people who need to be slapped into cuffs. A softer touch wouldn’t hurt.”
As they frequently find themselves, Castiel and Dean stand in front of each other in their now-completely shared bedroom, staring at one another.
Dean moves his finger again and presses his thumb to Castiel's bottom lip, swiping outwards. The lipstick smears across Castiel's lips all the way to the slight dimple on his cheek. Dean's body burns. Castiel looks like he's already been kissed.
Donna leans forward, encouragingly. "That's okay, Sam! We'll get it figured out together. Where would you like to start?"
"Ooh," Gabriel coos, scooting all the way back up the large bed to rest against the headboard. "Is it too much to hope for a strip tease?"
“It’s good to have you back,” Castiel says sincerely, holding Sam’s embrace slightly longer than normal and patting his back. It’s entirely possible he might be a little touch starved.
Sam jumps to his feet, knocking into the table, almost spilling their coffees. "Thanks for the coffee," he blurts, grabbing his cup. "See you in class." And then he's gone. He's out. He beats feet out of the coffee shop quickly. Cheeks on fire, he rushes to his car, jams the key into the ignition, and peels out of the parking lot in a way that would make Dean both proud and concerned.
And when his cell phone pings loudly with a text, he's able to shut off the water, knuckles throbbing with cold.
He sure as shit should. Sounds like a great idea. “I did promise to turn your frown upside down,” he quips.
Even not contagious, Dean thanks the stars they've been watching that he's on the other side of the car so he doesn't have to worry about germs. It doesn't matter whether they're the bad kind or the non-existent kind. "I'll get you warmed up and home in a sec," he says, tucking everything back into the trunk.
Sam sits up. “It said, ‘I’m coming for all of you.’ And that was it. She forwarded it to all of us. As soon as I saw it, Jack said we should get back home. We tried, but it was too late. He was already there.”
Inexplicably, Sam's knees almost give out at the sight of him, all done up in his argyle and glasses like a god of bookworms. The sheer
Once the tears start, they refuse to stop. Trying to choke them back only makes them hurt worse, so Castiel stops fighting it. He’d screwed up. He’d let this happen. He’d cost Sam his brother and himself his husband. He’s not sure how he can come back from this. As if he has the right.
He finishes and drops the razor to the table, then picks up the hand towel to wipe away the flecks of shaving cream left behind. With one finger, he strokes down Dean’s cheek and kisses his forehead softly before sliding back into his chair. “Until then... I do love you, Dean. With all my heart. Please wake up soon. Please be all right.”
Gradually, Castiel’s fingers tighten in his hair. Not painfully, but enough to pull his attention. He begins to thrust his hips slowly, almost like a question.
Eventually, Castiel breaks in and says, “you’ve got someone in your yellow zone. Three o’clock. Can’t see through the glare from the lights.”
than normal. It’s not a bad look on him. In fact, it’s appealing enough that Dean finds his lips tilting up into his most naturally flirty grin. Just to see what’ll happen, mind. “Mighty kind of you to say so, Cas,” he drawls.
Dean slams the phone on the table and presses the speaker. He rests his elbows on either side of it, hands fisting in his hair, leaning his head between his arms. "Cas is on the other line. He's... he's asking about my mental state."
But Sam isn’t placated so easily. In fact, his ire only seems to grow. “If you and Charlie can’t get Dean out of the spotlight, then you can’t do the job that I’m paying you for, and I’ll find someone else who can.”
Also a two car garage, which sells Dean on the spot because Baby ain't living on the street. She's too classy for that.
Dean jerks his hips up hard, slamming into Castiel. Once, twice, and the wire of tension snaps. Castiel comes with a gravelly shout, spilling warm into Dean’s hand.
Castiel sleeps deeply and undisturbed until just after seven in the morning when there’s a light knock on the door. He extracts himself carefully from Dean, shuffles to the door, and opens it to find Sam there with coffee, doughnuts, a prescription bag, and a shit-eating grin. “Good morning, Sam,” Castiel says, rubbing his eyes.
Gabriel digs Sam's hand out from under the sleeping bag, kissing his knuckles. "The orange looks great on your fingernails," he whispers.
Castiel seems to mull this over as he opens the door and steps them into the bedroom, slapping the light switch up.
“So, the surgery doesn’t take too long, but he’ll be a few hours in recovery until he’s back in his room. And the anesthesia will probably keep him out until morning, just so you know. Nothing to worry about.”
“Life is a funny thing,” she starts. “It’s long and short at the same time. Happy and sad. Full and empty in parts. It’s a contradiction. A race. A challenge. And no matter what, no one can do it alone. Sometimes it feels like there are few blessings in it, and no thanks at all. But then it happens. We stumble upon that special person who adds that one last spice our recipe has been lacking. They fill the gaps and put the rest of the pieces together.”
“You can’t do this!” Lucifer bites out, more honest emotion in his voice than he’s shown the whole time.
Realization dawning, Castiel says, "I shouldn't go to work tomorrow. I should... I should stay, too. It's Saturday, after all. I should eat breakfast with you. I can't remember the last time that I ate breakfast at all. Not here." He laughs suddenly. "I haven't actually used the kitchen once, save for the coffee maker. But there are plenty of groceries. I always have them delivered because I foolishly keep thinking that one day I'll make the time to learn how to cook. This will be the first time they're being used instead of thrown away."
Dean’s grin is quick and understanding. “Didn’t wanna be the twink everyone thought you were when they looked at you?”
“And you didn’t think to tell me sooner?” Normally, Sam is fairly calm about trusting them to do their jobs, but the accusation is heavy enough in his tone now that Dean feels a stab of shame. “You guys and your habit of keeping secrets too long is starting to get to me.”
this like air. He really has been dreaming about it since he first met Dean all trussed up in his blues. There’s only one thing left that would step it up from divine to perfect.
Dean blinks. “Uh, hey, Cas, you aren’t concerned with a Vegas-style, whirlwind three week engagement?”
Dean huffs and pushes off of the wall. He pokes the short man square in the chest. “That shitty feeling you got right now? Whenever you have that again, back the fuck off and find another way.”
Dean slouches lower in his seat. “Who cares?” he mutters. “I haven’t changed my mind about retiring in the last hour.”
He pauses. But that's the only reaction there is until he starts writing again. He doesn't so much as glance up towards Gabriel.
"Why would I?" Dean returns. "He owns the joint and he makes a great Americano. Hallelujah, the end."
Castiel's eyes slip closed as he revels in the motions, gently grasping Dean's hips just to help steady him. He's starting to shake with the effort of holding back. But Castiel doesn't want him to hold back. There's no reason to. They should share the afterglow.
Slowly, Castiel approaches him and holds both his hands out. Instead of taking them, Dean sways closer and cups Castiel’s face, wiping gently at his tears. “You cr-cr-cry too much.”
. And when Gabriel gave me the rundown, well... it seems like you're willing to try. That's good enough for me. What do you need from me? As long as it's not stepping over Dean's boundaries, I'll do it."
"I can physically feel you freezing up on me," Dean's voice breaks through dryly. "Just get the words out. Stop overthinking." He pokes at Castiel's squint right between his eyebrows. "Whatever it is, I'll listen. It's better than bottling it up."
“Thanks,” Dean says with a grin. He passes his tablet to Sam and Castiel gives his to the group. “Now, you’ll all have this info forwarded to you, but take a good look at the file for now, and those of you on tonight at the Westin, check the incoming traffic. None of the surrounding hotels have a Lucifer Pellegrino on the books, but he could be using an alias or staying further out. Sleeping in his car for all we know.”
Dean whips around on the stool even though it makes him dizzy. "I got it, Sam, okay? I'll find someone at the gig, but I don't have to like it."
, Cas was over at the house last night. With Dean. In his room. He was leaving when I got back there and he was wearing Dean's clothes."
Of course, he still doesn't rush his shower. Smelling good and being clean on a date is of the utmost importance, regardless of what the end goal is.
Dean only grunts in acknowledgement. But considering it’s the most they’ve spoken to each other in a long time, Castiel counts it as a win when he closes the door behind him. He turns to find Sam dithering in the hallway with a guilty expression.
Dean goes down on his knees in front of Castiel, face upturned in supplication. "And you're not mad?"
. His name is Gabriel. It suits him. Angelic sounding, but larger than life. Maybe this class won't be so bad after all. Not if
She steps down the side of the bed and begins to secure Dean’s wrists to the rail with leather straps. Neither Sam nor Castiel has the time to react with understandable horror because she’s already explaining, “he’ll be disoriented and probably in pain. Don’t want him flailing around and yanking at the breathing tube. It’s for his own safety. Once he’s free of that and more alert, we’ll take them off.”
The order is a bit on the breathless side, and Dean takes actual pride in that. He moves up Castiel’s body languidly, until they’re nose to nose again, and Castiel’s deep blue eyes search his with the plethora of emotions that neither of them need to put voice to just yet. Castiel’s chin tilts up minutely in offering. Dean closes his eyes and bends down.
Having already prepared another retort before Castiel’s answer, the unexpected admittance pulls him up short hard enough that he almost chokes on his tongue. “Huh,” is all that makes it out. He blinks. He thinks he has to be imagining it, but Castiel looks slightly more...
He pushes back and resumes his seat. “Great. Fine. So, back to the task at hand. I don’t have a leg to stand on. I get it. But I never said what me ‘n Cas were doing was smart, either.”
Castiel can’t help the fact that his body is reacting to both being able to touch Dean so freely, if innocently, and also those steady green eyes on him so absolute. He finishes the shave with a satisfied smile, warm cheeks, and dabs away the flecks of shaving cream left behind, finishing off with a pat of expensive aftershave.
Dean shrugs, trying for casual, but even his ears feel hot now. He holds up his cup. "I'm one of those people who couldn't function otherwise."
. But the doctors here are talking about brain damage. Perhaps permanent... complications. I’d like to believe in every silver lining as you do, but... forgive me for saying, you’re not here. If you saw him...”
Cain nods thoughtfully, but his smile is still bright. “You’d be surprised at how few people realize that, and more so actually walk the walk.”
"You do," Sam yawns. His eyes drift shut until he's left with just the rise and fall of Gabriel's chest under him. His deft fingers petting through his hair. "All of this. You do." It's the most calm he's been drifting to sleep in years.
Castiel takes a deliberate amount of time hanging one of the ropes and tying it off to the ceiling ring as the load-bearing line. Then he unwinds the other bundles to tie Dean with. Finally, the pre-set is done. Castiel tests the locks and rope by yanking it hard. It performs as expected, and then he’s closing the gap between him and Dean with purposeful strides. Dean barely has the chance to look up before Castiel bends forward and grabs Dean’s chin, jerking it up. Dean straightens his back, rising up as high as he can go without standing. Castiel is only a breath away when he says roughly, “I was going to gag you, but I think I’d rather hear my good boy scream.”
A wide, gummy grin spreads across Castiel's face. "Absolutely. Somewhere we can talk more? lay out a battle plan?"
"Thank you," Castiel grins up at him. "I know I'm going to shower it off in a few minutes, anyway, but I figured that I'd make an effort. It's a cedar and cinnamon oil I get from the farmer's market vendor."
There's quite a significant pause. And then a thoughtful, "Sam acted perfectly normal when I ran into him as I was leaving last night."
Conversely, it's going to piss Dean off a lot if Castiel lets himself get carried away like he wants to. Amelia had hated his overbearing tendencies. He can only guess how Dean would feel the same... times a hundred since he'd likely to attribute Castiel's over protection to some failing on his OCD. It couldn't be farther from the truth.
Sam frowns a little. He's not sure he likes how smugly superior Dr. Pellegrino sounds about that, but it's definitely something that piques his interest. Even something he'd been thinking about for his paper. Though that's not to say he's sold on it for his life's work.
"Suck it up," Sam counters. "We won't always be young and reflux-free. This is why we take turns and have the dinner chart, anyway." It's only half true. The fewest surprises possible to help with a solid routine is the other half. Either way, it means Dean can't eat burgers and bacon all week die of a heart attack when he's forty.
"That's the thing," Sam says with furtive intensity. "I think he's down because he's trying to convince himself that you're not any good for him, but you
Castiel grunts at the contact, body tensed, but not to run. In a light tone toughened by gravel, he muses, “so, when you said we should talk tonight...”
She gives him a strong hug when he enters her office not a minute late. “You’re looking good, kiddo! The private sector suits ya.”
“Don’t even,” Sam scoffs. “This is important. I’m totally cool with it. Are you? You haven’t slept at all.”
He keeps the lights off in the room and the blackout curtains closed. Despite being one of those people who can drop off to sleep at almost any time of the day when necessity requires it, the light makes for shit REM cycles. He wastes no time undressing and putting his foot in its dock to charge faster.
Which is so far from where they started that Dean can’t even articulate it properly. In the space of little more than a weekend, Castiel has gone from number cruncher to... well to a much bigger investment than client and sponsor. “I don’t mind being spoiled.”
Then the paddle whistles through the air and when Dean yells, “four!” it sounds almost like he’s having an orgasm.
“We moved around a lot,” Dean qualifies. “Sam told you about that right?” When Castiel nods, he continues, “well, we never stayed in one place for long. Always on the move. So, when we found a few hours to ourselves, Sammy ‘n me’d take the Impala all over the place and explore. Hell, we went everywhere in that car. Once we even took off for two weeks down Route 66 and beyond over the summer, just to do it.”
Sam whips around. "Yeah, you think so?" he growls moodily. "Well, I'm in love with him, so I'm gonna defend him. How would you feel if someone constantly talked crap about Castiel wearing flip-flops and smelling like patchouli all the time?" He thumps down onto his chair, glaring moodily at the table in a way that immediately throws Dean backwards in time to about the year 2000. Adorable.
On his way to the bathroom, he happens to glance into their shared studio. Dean's large computer screen is on. And there's a new wallpaper on the screen.
"That's right," Dean purrs, grinning. "Tell me what you want, Cas. I'll give it to you. You know I will."
Sam pales, stepping back to brace himself against the wall. “And you think that’ll actually happen?”
It shouldn't be that way. Dean scuffs his toe against the carpet four times. Then the other one to make it even. "I wasn't ready to tell him, but I had to. I didn't have a choice."
He slides out of Sam's lap, kneeling on the tiles, thoroughly washing each of Sam's feet in turn. Toe by toe.
Nothing happens. The silence stretches. Castiel keeps eating calmly, not at all looking as though he's willfully keeping a million questions or well meaning, but ultimately unhelpful, observations at bay.
At least the convention attendees have been well-behaved thus far. They’re enthusiastic, and though more than a few lost their shit being so close to the show’s stars, on the whole it’s been simple overwhelming star struck tears, rather than anything more malicious.
Dean’s smile is the rising sun. “You d-d-don’t wanna know how long it took me to d-d-decide on a design.”
Castiel’s throat clicks as he swallows. His eyes widen. The sudden plague of fierce desire is instantly swept away into the depths of understanding. And that understanding brews quite the potent draught of shame. He opens his mouth to apologize, to say anything, but Dean’s done with him.
Castiel’s right hand strokes in languid easy tugs, left hand working the loose jeans over Dean’s ass and hips so that he can reach further to cup his balls, squeezing slightly for that small hint of pain to test the waters. When Dean hisses through his teeth, every fiber of his being dedicated to not moving against an issued command, Castiel knows somewhere in the core of him that they are going to be all right. He’s not sure why it’s this moment that solidifies it. Not sure what single thing tips the scales finally. But he is sure of it. He’ll never doubt it again. And a part of him realizes that Dean can feel the shift, too. Almost like magic.
