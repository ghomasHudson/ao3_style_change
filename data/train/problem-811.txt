"So it's soon then."  John couldn't resist touching again, pushing closer this time, finding the taut but springy ring of muscle, pressing against it off to one side with his fingers, to feel the slick opening moving against itself.
“We will not consult my mother,” Sherlock said, his serious mein setting John off again.  Sherlock merely smiled as he pulled John back through the maze of doors, and out of the tower again.
"As I've said before, as far as I am concerned, his name is Inspector.  It doesn't mean that my care is any less real."
John heaved a huge sigh and leaned back against the couch.  Trust Sherlock to infuse even a sincere apology with a damning insult.  He wouldn’t even see it as such, the implication being that John wasn’t using his mind but relying on modern machines, so it wasn’t even worth pointing out.
"So, it's all just to do with chemicals, then?"  John thought of Sherlock's text to him when he was in the car.
"I'm not at all bothered by it," she said.  "We only ever went out for Thai or Chinese, and those are easy enough, and when you came over to my place I cooked."
"Yes.  We are indistinct, as the shell is quite dense, and the noise is distorted due to the curve.  Still, she will find our voices reassuring when she emerges."  Sherlock seemed to have no opinion on the gender of the baby, referring to it by whatever pronoun John had most lately used.  "Oh, and a Moby is the fabric wrap my mother gave us for the egg.  It serves well for a baby also.  Sarah will easily discern that you are woefully unprepared and unless I am mistaken as to her general nature she will want to remedy this.  Even so, I'd prefer that you are home by three.  Anborg will be coming over."
John turned to look at him for the first time since he'd woken up. “Might as well get some sleep in, more like,” he said. “I'll be back shortly.” He studied Sherlock's face, the new softness to his cheekbones, the subtle sheet wrinkles around his temple where he'd been lying. This face had nothing in common with the man who had jeered at him in the nightmare. He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock's forehead, breathing in the scent of him, bringing himself back to the real world again.
“You really can’t tell with an egg, can you,” she mused.  “Still, it just feels precious, doesn’t it?  I feel like I’ve gone all over warm and doting on it.”
"What's this about then?" John asked.  His phone buzzed in his pocket and he pulled it out, looking at the screen blatantly.
“I’m sorry John.”  When she spoke her voice was dry, parched, even though the pitcher of water was empty.  “I hope I’m not hurting her.”  She nudged the egg towards him, and, realizing that it was the source of her fever, John picked it up immediately.
"If you're saying that your feelings for me are analogous to my having ordinary features, you might want to start treading lightly."
“You look amazing,” John said, the hoarseness of his voice a surprise despite what they’d just done.
Not, I love you.  Not, John, I love you.  John, I do love you-- as if Sherlock had predicted over a month ago that this would be part of an argument.
“Great, thanks,” John said. When he'd thought the words there had been a sarcastic tinge to them, but he found that he meant it. If Sherlock was socially awkward at times, it was nothing to Sigeursonn's devotion to truth telling.
There was another mug on the table, and John sighed as he sat down, noting that it had already had milk added to it.
“A fortified entryway,” Sigeursonn said. “Very good, I'll talk to Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft can vet the contractors.”
“Or the fear of a foetal loss, I'm sure,” Sherlock said, seeming to read his mind. “We can at least be reassured on that front.”
John turned the egg around.  "You will.  Probably other things I'm not even thinking of yet.  You're not going to be able to apply logic to this."
"Yes."  John spoke before he thought, his voice a whisper, hands fumbling on the sleeve of Sherlock's gown, trying to pull it off of him at once.
Sherlock frowned.  “You may be right.  We’ll consult the doctor when she arrives.”  His expression softened when he looked at John.  “But of course, the opinion of my doctor will trump hers.”
) and he let himself be pulled into a loose, genteel embrace, the navy wool of her light jacket soft under his hands.   She kissed each of his cheeks quickly, too quick for him to even think of reciprocating, and he simply stepped back as she did, sliding her hands down his arms to clasp his hands in hers for a fraction of a second before letting go.  Her hands were strong, short fingernails, and she was dressed simply and warmly-- heavy navy trousers, a crisp dark blouse, the wool jacket.  If John hadn’t known Sherlock he would have guessed that she was a retired woman who spent a lot of time either in her garden, or perhaps with horses.  That might still be true, he reasoned, though there had to be more to it than that.
“I want that very much.  I’m merely acknowledging the suddenness of our arrangement and my own idiosyncrasies that might cause you to want a room of your own.”  He shifted, and John thought of the sharpness of his hipbones, the utter lack of fat on them, and wondered if he should warn Sherlock to turn himself every so often.
John sat down, looking dumbly up at Sherlock, who had entered the room. “Why are you talking about girls? I thought we didn't know?” He felt something hot rising up in the back of his mind, the thought that Sherlock might have asked Anborg to look, somehow.
“Probably Mummy,” Sherlock said, taking a slice for each of them to the toaster.  “She would think of this.”
“Not tired yet, you know that.”  He swallowed the last of his tea and stood, rubbing the towel over his head briskly.   “Are you ready to go?”
"I was trying to get to the point in such a way that you might be able to see it for yourself, but very well.  I'll be blunt, if you'd prefer."
“That would be good,” he said, and meant it.  Sarah had been hurt when their relationship had fizzled out so quickly, before it began, really, but she’d been a good friend during his lonely year, as he thought of it, and after, too, even as he’d tried to keep her at arm’s length.  He looked down as his phone chirped again, and he held it out to her.  “Another French message.”
“Going on cases is part of who I am.  And I don’t do it out of some misplaced sense of ego, either.”  He ran his hand over the stones.  “As much as I abhor sentiment, it is hard to deny, here, that my emotions are stirred.”
He sat down and had a scone and a cup of tea at her urging.  He was just pouring his second cup when Sherlock emerged, wearing a fitted black tee-shirt over jeans, a towel still slung around his neck to keep his dripping hair from soaking the shirt.  Seeing Sherlock in such casual clothes was still something of a shock, even after all these weeks.
John turned towards him, hands rotating the egg automatically.  He barely felt the strain in his arms, though it had only been a few days of carrying it around less than half the time.
"Makes sense, doesn't it," John said, wiping his fingers off on his own thigh before curling close to Sherlock again.  "To help the egg come out?"
"You're trying to remember if I have ever lied to you, and coming to the conclusion that I have not, though there are times that you wish I had been more forthcoming.  On the other hand, I know for a fact that you have never lied to me.  You have never lied, that I know of, and now I need to ask you for your word.  I need to require that you swear never to reveal what I am about to tell you to anyone other than Sherlock or myself."
his traitorous mind supplied, but he had that on his branch of the family tree too.  It evened out.  "It was my decision too."  Even though it was a base lie, it felt true.  Had they hired a surrogate, he would have preferred Sherlock to be the donor.
“I’ll get her some,” John said, standing slowly from where he’d crouched in front of her.  “Just wait here.”
“Your family has surprised me on that front,” John said, thinking of the tenderness with which Mycroft had held the egg. He immediately flinched from his own words, hearing the implicit insult.
“Not long at all.”  John felt a prickle go up the back of his neck.  “I keep thinking it’s going to be today.”
"Please trust me, and please, go away!"  The last was shouted as Sherlock hurled himself through the door, slamming it shut behind him.
"Satisfied that I won't hurt you?  Yes."  John kept one arm wrapped around Sherlock's chest and tried to guide his cock with his free hand, but with Sherlock lying on his side his buttocks were too firmly closed.
John nodded as he looked over his own menu, the gluten free flier conspicuously absent.  "I think that probably has something to do with Sherlock's brother, actually.  I wouldn't expect that level of choice when you come here again."
John imagined Sherlock being plied with biscuits and weak tea, surrounded by doilies in some Floridian retirement community home.
John bristled a bit at the authoritative tone, but it felt like something he was doing just because he expected himself to do it.  "I won't.  I haven't."
John watched, trying to make some sense, some reason as to why Sherlock would have bothered to go down to the Embankment on New Years, why he would film it with his phone, what it had to do with John.  The picture jostled, Sherlock holding the camera up with one hand, a sea of peoples' heads moving about beneath the bright sky.  Then, camera still held high, Sherlock held out his small notebook, flipped it open, and trained the camera on it.  In the next flash of light, John could see what he'd written there, in block letters across two pages.
"I didn't say anything cruel," Sherlock said, sure of himself, but not stridently insisting.  Not yet, anyway.
John sighed. “Alright. I'll sleep for a bit more, then I'll get up and I can get some food in. What does he like?”
Sherlock had only just gone into the kitchen when there was a knock at the door.  He walked through the living room, alert and focused, almost worried, and John felt his own apprehension building.  It was only the fact that he could hear Mrs. Hudson’s pleasant tone of voice that kept him from anxiously demanding that Sherlock somehow prove it was an expected guest.  He stayed seated as Sherlock opened the door, trying not to crane his neck for a glimpse of the visitor.
"John, please," Sherlock's voice was clear, muffled only a bit by the bed as he tried to slide backwards, fitting himself more tightly to John's cock.
“Hello darling. We love you so much.”  He couldn’t stop himself from constantly assessing the color in her cheeks, the rate and depth of her breath, and the way her eyes seemed to lock onto his own, holding his gaze for a few seconds at a time. When Sherlock leaned over his shoulder she looked at him, then yawned hugely, her eyes rolling before her lids fluttered shut.
He struggled to relax, loosening his collar and fidgeting the entire short trip home.  Once there he bounded up the stairs, pausing before the door of the flat only long enough to hear the click and hum of the front door locking itself behind him.
Sherlock took his hand as they stepped out the front door.  John quelled the sudden stab of nerves at that, annoyed that he felt it for even a moment.
Anborg chatted amicably with them for a bit longer, until John had cleared the tea things away.  John realized that after the baby was shown to be healthy she really would not have any reason to come around, and yet, she was, at least peripherally, Sherlock’s family.  Thoughts of visiting Anborg and the others with the baby in tow filled John’s head as he did the washing up.
"And this is particularly meaningful to me because?"  Sherlock was still not in the habit of polite conversation, and in truth John could have simply plowed ahead with the entire contents of his thoughts, but he was still caught in the rhythms of how ordinary people spoke.
"I am attempting to find a reliable source of human milk for the baby, but in the UK donated milk is set aside for premature infants."
"It's not that strange, John, all children at that age wish to be helpful to their parents, and I was no exception, despite my significantly higher than average intellect.  It is nearly universal that children hatched from eggs have an advanced brain development, most likely due to the richness of the yolk that they feed from during their gestation."
It took a moment for John’s eyes to adjust to the subtle movement but it was undeniably there, the entire shadow expanding and contracting around a point about one third of the way from crown to rump, just a barely visible flutter of vitality.  On the hard surface of the box the egg itself moved ever so slightly-- as he stared John had the briefest moment of vertigo, his focus narrowed down to a tiny point and a subtle sign, as if he were trying to look for evidence of the rotation of the earth.
"The fact that some people take this other than medicinally is a blight upon common sense," Sherlock opined before he sipped at it.
“I can only surmise regarding your childhood. I can not deduce it, but I can make an educated guess. Children are too plastic to allow for the adult to be a sure signpost to their upbringing, but your sister's alcoholism and your devotion to the military are almost enough.”
“Hello, I’m John,” he said.  The woman standing in front of him was wearing a traditional jumper, her blond hair in two thick plaits, and her answering smile was so warm that John immediately felt his expression shift from trying to be pleasant to being truly pleased to see her.
John obeyed, lying flat on his back as he watched Sherlock, wondering how he hadn't seen the way the other man was moving differently, gingerly, keeping his torso straight as he sat down, then rolled onto his side, facing away from John.
John watched the chest rise and fall, marked the pink color to the hands and feet, then gently pulled on her ankles, still nearly at her shoulders.
“Of course.”  She took out her phone and stepped into the kitchen as Sherlock sank down on the floor next to John.  John shifted as Sherlock put his arm around John’s back, holding him tight as they both stared at the egg.
When he stepped inside, Sherlock was much as he'd imagined him, laid out on the sofa, dark blue dressing gown only accentuating his pale skin.  He'd showered, and his hair looked darker than ever, splayed out behind him on a cushion.  A glass of cloudy liquid sat on his chest, barely sipped, from the looks of it.
“Yeah, I’ve been working up to it.”  He could feel his heartbeat in his throat, while Sherlock looked entirely calm.  He reached out for Sherlock’s hand, for his own comfort.  Sherlock gave it, but for a moment rested his fingertips against John’s palm.  That’s when he felt it, the tremor that could only be felt at that gentle touch.  They both squeezed tightly.
“No, caffeine has no effect on me.” Sherlock's hand wave was second nature, John was sure. He pulled down the orange pekoe and prepared a strainer for each of them. Sherlock watched him prepare the tea in silence, speaking only once John had seated himself at the table.
“And our child,  and teenager,” John said, having a sudden vision of the sorts of gifts Sherlock would likely find appropriate.  Far from what he’d expected, Sherlock had a deft hand when it came to choosing gifts, and with a child John was fairly sure that he’d follow the maxim of giving what he’d like to receive, or what he would have liked to have received.
Sherlock pushed open the dressing gown to reveal the contour of his abdomen, covered only in a thin vest.  It wasn't a fundus such as a pregnant woman would have, more of an all-over swelling, the center vertical line of his abdomen the most prominent part of him.
“The egg?” Sherlock paused to look at him. “The egg is gone, John. It amounted to nothing, in the end.”
“Oh, lovely.”  Mrs. Hudson spoke over the top of her paperback, the egg snuggled up to her abdomen.  “Have fun you two.”
“You managed it,” John said, glancing at him.  “Should we turn her a bit?  I wonder which way she’s facing.”
“She’s throwing off her own heat now as well as using your body heat,” Anborg said to John.  “As she nears the limits of the egg in terms of growth, she consumes the yolk at a faster pace.   It’s like a last burst of growth before she hatches.”
John sat in silence until the car slowed to a stop.  Looking outside he realized they weren't home at all, only paused outside a shop.  He dashed inside, bought two bottles of Lucozade and two packets of crisps, then walked back out to the waiting car, hoping he didn't look like a nutter being picked up by men in black outside a bloody newsagents.
John mulled that over as he turned the egg again, a motion that he didn't notice until he was already done.
"Fine.  This is the truth, at least, as it is understood right now.  There is much we don't understand about the theory of evolution.  While Sherlock and Mummy are both incontrovertibly human, there are traits that they share that are not commonly found in humans, or, indeed, in mammals.  The platypus and other monotremes are notable exceptions, but as far as we know they are the result of an early branching of mammalian evolution.  There is no direct link between the eutherians and the monotremes, but that leaves the branch of the human tree represented by people like Sherlock and Mummy a continuing mystery."
“I could do with a cuppa, too,” Sherlock said, sitting himself down at the table with the egg against his lap, one of John's jumpers wrapped around it.
“That didn’t seem to be how you were operating at the time,” Sherlock said, his voice so quiet as to be almost without inflection.
"I assume you've at least told her that we are together?"  The tone of his voice gave away that he was already looking down, examining what John couldn't even begin to imagine.
“Not having them confront the reality of other kinds of life on earth is far more for my own comfort and security than theirs,” Sherlock said, and John could not disagree.
Work was, surprisingly, bearable.  The hours passed quickly, with no more than the usual number of texts from Sherlock.  Towards the end of the day there was the usual late afternoon rush of minor sport injuries and sickly school children, and John stopped answering his texts altogether, depositing the phone in his coat pocket.  When he lifted it out as he was getting ready to go, he found himself entirely unsurprised to see that there were twenty unread messages.
She was also clearly unsurprised by the presence of Anthea at the worktop, wielding their sharpest santoku knife and turning a series of vegetables into neat thin strips.
The web of cracks became clearer as they were forced open from the inside, a new line forming from the crown of the egg downward to join the first, a shard that seemed to wiggle at the tip like a loose tooth, but kept settling back down.  John took a deep breath, the tears finally stopping as suddenly as they’d started.
John struggled for a moment to make sense of his train of thought, then followed Sherlock’s gaze over Tower Bridge, watching as one of the morning buses made its way towards the city.
"The first few times at least it will go well."  Sherlock trailed off, his tone not inviting further consideration on the matter.  “Are you going to work today?”
When Sherlock looked at him the corners of his eyes were wet, the slightest tremble to the corner of his mouth.  “No, I never did.”  He laid his hand along the top of John’s where he held Egzanthe firmly to him.  “I never dared.”
Sherlock wandered back into the kitchen.  “Charmingly disheveled naturalist,” he said. “Feel free to add any of your own things, as you see fit.”
“What?” John asked the phone aloud.  Sherlock knew he couldn’t read French, though he knew enough to know that the message contained the words love, and dangerous, and without.
"No, why me, what did I do?"  John felt helpless, sure he'd given some offense but utterly unaware of what it could have been.
“I think her temperature has gone up, quite high,” John said, handing the egg to Sherlock, who already had his hands outstretched.  Out of the corner of his eye John could see Sherlock sitting down in the basket chair, running his hands over the shell.  He held the egg up to his shirtfront, not against his skin-- it must have felt slightly warm to him, too.
“You’re routinely gone for ten hours, many days of the week,” Sherlock countered. “Surely I can be forgiven for daring to go outside for twelve in one week?”
The last two drawers were filled with bags of nappies, packages of dummies, and bottles.  John sat down on the floor, a package of bottles in his hands.
“Yes, if you were given another occupation.  This is my occupation, this is my outlet, this is my contribution.  Without the work, I am nothing.  I exist but effect no change on the world around me, so, in effect, I am nothing.”
When he woke the thin light of dawn was filling the flat and his bladder was screaming at him.  He set the egg down and pulled his jumper over it, and went to the loo, looking around for any sign that Sherlock had come home and simply not disturbed him.  It was unlikely-- for one thing Sherlock tended to bound into the house after a case, and for another there was no blanket thrown over John and his shoes were still on.  Those rudimentary courtesies were things that were not beyond even Sherlock Holmes.
The extent to which Sherlock did not believe in an afterlife sometimes surprised John, who believed it in with a vague sort of misty conception of a heaven full of clouds and a benevolent God who touched the earth with fingers made of light in old paintings.  If challenged he would have been hard pressed to define his beliefs, but when he had asked to be allowed to live, there'd been a distinct sense of someone listening, and not only in the manner of a dying man's desperation.
“These clothes are all from Sherlock’s cousins.  They’ve been passed from family to family.  Sherlock, I think this was actually yours when you were small.”  She held up a blue linen shirt with a heavily embroidered yoke in red over the shoulders and the middle of the chest.
"I'm sure you can figure something out, John.  No matter what you say, she will be predisposed to believe you."
“Our car?  Where are we going, anyway?”  John had assumed that they were going to walk around the park, perhaps get coffee, and walk home again.
"I couldn't trust myself to think of a way to tell you that Moriarty couldn't intercept or extrapolate from your innocent movements.  You might have stopped for a sandwich on the way to work one day and he would have concluded that your appetite was better prior to the time predicted by my death and concluded that I was in fact alive.  It had nothing to do with trusting you or not, just as my filing of Lestrade under I for Inspector in my mental hard drive has nothing to do with my esteem or lack thereof for the man."
She turned to him with a glare, once more.  “Zilpha loves her sons, and love, as they say, is blind.  Her belief may be next door to a complete fiction, but she has never challenged Mycroft and he has never offered to disabuse her of the nature of his job.  It’s safer for everyone this way.”
"Good.  Then I don't have to worry about being under some kind of spell when I tell you that I love you too."
“John and I are going to take the egg to our room,” Sherlock said, holding it to himself as he stood up.
There was a scraping of the chair on the floor, and then Sherlock was standing in the doorway, stretching his back with his hands on his hips, as if he were actually a pregnant woman.
"One of our cousins will come and assess it soon, but I feel that it is.  If it were not alive it would already be putrifying."
Such a cold, clinical word, but it sent a jolt of heat straight to John's cock.  "When, ah, when should that be?"  His mouth had gone dry, making speech difficult.
"Father had built a life for himself in Strynn, while Mummy was merely waiting to go back to England.  It was their agreement that they would return when I was three, but as the time got closer and closer Father realized he didn't want to leave.  He was from Norway, while Mummy only had grandparents who were from there, and no close living relatives.  The rest of her family was in England and France, but he'd never felt at home in England.  He had been a scientist of some renown in England, but in a smaller community like Strynn his influence could be felt far more clearly.  Mummy was always more comfortable working behind the scenes."
"Hello," Sarah said, composed despite the fact that Anthea was weaving in and out of traffic in a frankly alarming way.  "Will you be joining us for lunch?"
"You need one of those," she said, suddenly authoritative.  "All my friends who have babies swear by them.  Alright, you need a boppy.  What about nappies, are you doing cloth ones?"
"It will."  Sherlock's phone chimed at him, and he angled his head to see the screen.  "Speak of the devil, that would be Mycroft.  As you can see I can't leave the bed, so you'll have to deal with him."
"We're supposed to read to babies from the first days of their life," John said.  "It's good for brain development."
“Not correct, but correct only in that it is the image Mummy has cultivated.  That may be her only connection to gardening, that I know of.  She keeps her fingernails short and her hands unadorned because she can’t be bothered with the tedium of cosmetics and jewelry, but she does not have any of the other marks on her hands that would be typical for an equestrian, and there is certainly none of the dirt or tannin stain that would be typical for a gardener.”
"What is this?"  He pulled his hand away and held his fingers up to the light.  They were coated thickly with something crystal clear but viscous, clinging, copious but not dripping, and as fever-hot as Sherlock seemed to be.  "Oh my god."
John couldn't help smiling and shaking his head fondly, nearly able to hear Sherlock's voice through the texts.
“I find myself feeling a bit empty handed though.” John leaned back, listening as Sherlock hummed his response. “What do you and John need?”
Sherlock tossed a folded cheque on the coffee table, where it opened just enough for John to see the amount of naughts.  If it wasn’t enough for him to quit his job, it would be at least enough to provide enough padding for a lengthy paternity leave.
"How did I not know that?"  John frowned, more at himself than her.  They'd dated only briefly, but it seemed like the sort of thing he would have discovered, either when they were speaking as friends, or when dining out together.
She turned to him and sighed.   “Sherlock, you know better than to be out at all hours, leaving John with the egg.”  She brushed her hand over his remarkably stiff hair, then leaned a little closer, wincing.  “And you know better than to get your head wet at this time of the year.  Go, shower.  We’ll put a cozy on the teapot.”
"You know that experimenting on the baby is more than a bit not good," John said, hoping beyond hope that he didn't really have to explain that.
“And it is only a guess,” Sigeursonn said. “Well, it's an estimate based on probability, but you could still have a perfectly healthy boy with a ring like this.”
John pursed his lips, fully aware that even that facial tic was likely enough to give away his annoyance to Mycroft.  On the other hand, Sherlock had felt well enough to get to his room.  That was hopeful.
John’s heart sank.  “Do you not want me to sleep in your bed?”  The size of the bed that he’d seen looked more than commodious, and more than that he wanted to be near both Sherlock and the egg.  He’d never been married, but he was used to sleeping next to his partners.
She looked pleased.  “Well, it doesn’t sound like he’s any easier to live with.  In love, writing is dangerous, not to mention pointless.”
"The baby will have half of my genetic material, it will of course resemble me in some way.  It will also resemble you, but that will take less explanation, or none at all, as your features are ordinary."
"So, are you ready?"  She already looked excited, John noted, though purely at the thought of receiving some new gossip.  She didn't know how right she was.
Once home Sherlock was already dressed to leave, the only thing out of place his open shirt front, the egg against his skin.
"Then the egg goes in here like so," she said, taking it from Mycroft, "and you cross the fabric over again, over the shoulders, across the egg again, around the back, and tie underneath, like this."  When she was done Sherlock looked to be wearing a light green shirt, the egg firmly swaddled against him.  He moved his arms, testing it, bounced on the balls of his feet, his hands linked loosely under the egg, though it was secure.
“That’s quite usual, anyway, even among people who aren’t gestating.”  She took out a handheld doppler and switched it on, a familiar hum as the unit readied itself.  “Shall we hear the heartbeat?”
The smile Sherlock gave him at that wasn’t quite a smirk, but it was quirked to one side, like so many of his smiles.  This one said
John let his face go carefully blank.  Sherlock had been gone from his sight for a year.  Then there had been a terrible month when Sherlock had returned, and John had been simultaneously drawn to him and repulsed by the sight of the man who had caused him so much pain.  It had taken the entirety of the month for John to absorb the message that Sherlock had truly staged his death to protect him as well as Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.  Since then it had been less than a year, but he could not imagine being without Sherlock again, ever again.  The realization hit him almost as hard as the fear itself, and he coughed into his fist.
“Not with the way you’re covering her,” Annborg said.  “You’ve got about ten minutes though before she starts asking for food.”
“You don’t need to travel light any longer,” he said.  John’s heart filled at the sentiment.  He was saved from the threat of too much sentiment by Sherlock’s next utterance.  “I do, of course, have the power to veto anything you might bring that is too hideous.”
Sherlock’s hand curved around the egg, nudging John a bit, his smallest finger against the side of John’s hand, just enough of a touch to make sure that John was aware of him, that they were holding the egg together.  Sherlock straightened his legs out slowly, lowering his hips towards the bed. John turned his head, lapped at Sherlock’s hip, urging him closer.  Sherlock kept John’s cock held deep and still as he twisted, weight held on one hand, his left hand still gentle around the egg as he arranged himself, knees on either side of John’s head.
“It’s always a tense but exciting evening, when an egg hatches,” Sigurson said as he met John’s eye.
“But then you decided not to.”  Mycroft pulled out a cloth and shook it out, then folded it in half and laid it over John’s right shoulder. “I never guess.”
Sherlock nodded.  “I already did.  She should be here any moment.  Knowing you were working a half day and would be home soon anyway, I was going to wait until she had examined the egg prior to summoning you.”
“Ooh, let me see.”  She took the phone from him before he could stop her.  The protest died on his lips anyway.  He was going to have to tell her sometime.    She gave him an odd look.  “You two finally sort yourselves out, then?”
John opened the top drawer that had until recently held his socks and pants.  In their place was pile after pile of tiny folded babygros, all white.  He held one up, unfolding it, still shocked at how small it was.  The tag at the neck said 0-3 mos, not a preemie outfit, but for a normal newborn baby.  Despite the fact that he held the egg every day he was still having a hard time believing that the baby that would emerge would be so small.
"Oh, of course, silly me.  Now, what was the mnemonic for remembering the position of the ovipositor relative to the peritoneal cavities?  I must have learned it in medical school.  Oh wait, no, I didn't."
John shook his head, but knew that if he tried to convince Sherlock that it would have been Moriarty's fault, not his, it would be a losing battle.  He couldn't match Sherlock's wit and leaps of logic, not tonight.  "But for me, I would have been dead."
Sherlock shrugged.  “He won’t notice the state of it, though he’ll notice it’s contents.  Sort of a forest for the trees situation.”
Back at the flat John ran up the steps, the desire to hold the egg foremost in his mind.  What he saw when he opened the door stopped him in his tracks.
John sighed deeply, holding the egg against his abdomen.  "I swear, I will always tell you the truth," he said, his face pointed towards the egg so there could be no mistaking who he was addressing.
John walked home, pausing by the Sainsbury’s.  Sherlock had an endless supply of water and a nearly endless supply of food, but he was impatient, and easily bored.  John wouldn't put it past him to become dehydrated just because he was bored with water.  He darted inside and quickly chose two litres of water that claimed to be flavored with essence of cucumber and white grape, respectively, and a litre of blood orange lemonade.  The phone was mercifully silent the entire way home.
“Yeah, soon,” John said, holding the egg awkwardly with one hand as he carefully walked to the sofa.  The surface of the shell was still warm, and he set it carefully on the crease between two cushions as he retrieved his dinner from the kitchen, resting the plate on the coffee table as he ate, watching a QI rerun and trying not to worry about Sherlock.
John settled down on the bed, curled into the angle of the mattress, and pushed in with his middle three fingers, meeting the barest resistance, a sense of healthy flesh, but nothing more, the muscle and connective tissue underneath softening by the second, every push he made answered with a sense of giving way.
Sherlock shook his head. “I didn't ask. It doesn't matter, I had no intentions of leaving the flat today and as we have no car it's not as though we could give him a lift. I'm sure Mycroft knows his whereabouts, and unless things are really hotting up in the South Pacific he'll be able to spare Anthea and the car.”
John followed him, painstakingly taking the stairs one at a time as he held the egg against his stomach.  Sherlock waited for him at the top, then led the way to John's room.  As he stepped over the threshold he realized he hadn't even set foot in the room in days.  Half of his clothes had migrated to Sherlock's room and he did always sleep in there.
"Give me your hand," John demanded, tapping Sherlock on his hip.  Sherlock reached back, only to have John turn his hand so he was grasping his own arse.  "Open yourself up for me.”
In the kitchen he found the second bottle of  Lucozade that he’d bought just about six weeks before.  It was unopened.  He poured it into a glass and brought it out to Mrs. Hudson.
“What’s your foot doing up there?” John asked.  When he’d imagined her in the egg she’d always been tidily curled up, heels against her rump.
"I think you can," Mycroft said quietly.  "You've felt this way about him for a long while.  Is it not gratifying to discover that your regard is returned?"
"No, I was not."  John traced the bump of the egg, trying to feel its contours the way Sherlock had shown him.  It wasn't quite as clear without Sherlock's hand guiding him, but it was obviously there, firm and immovable.  "And I want this too.  I want to do this with you."  He had stumbled over the words, had almost said
“That’s not what I meant.”  Sherlock curled up behind John, his chest to John’s back.  He already felt cool against John’s skin.
Sherlock nodded.  "Our differences are serious, but for all his faults he is neither careless nor cruel to children.  I don't plan on denying him access to his niece or nephew, and if he wants to incubate the egg for a while, I will let him.  In Stryn it was very common for brothers and sisters and even friends to incubate an egg while the mother and father were busy."
"Not to the extent that you might think," Sherlock said, the corner of his mouth quirking.  He turned his head, his gaze suddenly piercing.
John growled at him, nipping against Sherlock's mouth before he pulled away, leaning and twisting enough that he could pull on Sherlock's right leg.  Sherlock was pliant enough to let him, and in moments John had both of his knees hooked over his shoulders, Sherlock's thighs spread enough to be out of the way as John leaned over him, Sherlock's cock brushing against his stomach.
“Hello,” Sherlock said softly, reaching in and brushing his fingers over the whorl of hair, careful to avoid the soft fontanels.
"Did you have to choose which parent to go with?" John asked.  "Or did Mycroft?  You were only three."
"It's no trouble," John said, discomforted by the silence between him and Mycroft.  Mycroft was singular in that he was able to make John feel uncomfortable with silence at all.
John stood and went to Sherlock's side.  Sherlock had run out of worktop to hold onto and was eying the distance between the worktop and the door, clearly wondering if he could make it.
“Here, we’ll let this warm up.”  She set it on the coffee table, then crouched down next to the sofa, looking for the outlet.  John realized too late that he should have been helping her look, but he couldn’t seem to leave Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock bent his head, leaning his forehead against John’s.  “Never.”  He pressed a kiss to John’s mouth, lingering there before stepping back.  “What did we come in here for?”
John felt Sherlock breach him just as he pressed into Sherlock, perfect symmetry, warm cling around his finger even as he felt his own hole twitch against Sherlock’s finger.  Seconds later there was a sense of straining in his throat, a rhythmic pulsing all along the length of his tongue, steady squeeze and release around his finger even as he felt himself coming, all of Sherlock’s motions echoed in his own body.  He swallowed reflexively, easing his head back onto the pillow as Sherlock’s cock softened.  Sherlock’s fingers were twined in his, holding on tight, nearly crushing John’s hand, but only lightly touching the egg.
"I was nearly sure," Sherlock said, softly.  "I was sure.  I am sure."  He let go of John's hand, only to curve his hand around the back of John's head, pulling him closer until John's face was leaning against the side of Sherlock's belly, the egg a firm curve under his cheek.  "I am sure that you love me."
"I think that if it came down to quantifying it, despite his truly spectacular lack of some common knowledge and occasional lapses in what you might call common sense, he would have the higher IQ, but that wasn't why.  There are some genetic tendencies in my own family that, while they wouldn't have stopped me from having children in a more traditional way, I'd rather avoid if possible.”
"It's alright, John, it only happens now.  Only every seven years."  Sherlock's voice seemed almost scared, and John pinged to why immediately-- scared of being thought a freak, now, after everything else John knew about him.
John pinched the bridge of his nose, as if that was going to help stave off the impending headache that was building behind his eyes.  Before he could answer the phone buzzed again.
He set the egg back onto his lap and turned on the early morning news show, then switched it off as he realized he was listening acutely for any sign of what Sherlock might have been involved in.
"John."  Sherlock hadn't moved from the table, didn't even bother lifting his head before asking for his attention.
They listened to the sounds of construction going on next door.  “What could they possibly be building now?  The bed looked nearly finished when I left,” John said.
It was the first time John had ever sat in the back of the car with Mycroft, and he found the setting almost comforting,   It was natural, after all, to look straight ahead, or out one of the windows.
“Certainly, but I’ve never considered it my job to keep another person happy.”  Sherlock’s voice was strong to the end but then faltered and John bit back the knowing smile he nearly gave him.
"Sorry, what?"  John felt wrong-footed, the first time that evening.  Anthea slipped away as Mycroft was settling back in his chair, only confusing John further.
“No doubt,” Mycroft said as he turned to the dresser. “Now, if I know Sherlock he would have placed the burp cloths,” his hand hovered over the knobs, then chose the drawer closest to the bed. “Aha.”
“Oh, right.  That makes sense, actually, I’ve been ignoring his texts all day.  Figured if there was an emergency he could ring the surgery.”
“Pulse is ninety-two,” Ann said, moving the doppler about slightly to find the loudest point.  “Perfectly normal for this stage.”
"My sister," he said, lying.  "Sherlock's parents, and his brother."  True there, to a point.  "Anthea knows as well."
“On the weekends we usually see her at least once,” John said.  “She lives outside the city but she’ll come stay with us closer to time.  She’s a university student.  Sherlock keeps pretty close tabs on her anyway and she lives with her family so we’re not concerned that she’s off getting into mischief.”
"John."  He spoke as if the words were being punched out of him, all sudden breaths.  "Please, I'm going to be ill, just leave me in peace.  Go, ah, go visit your sister."
“A pleasure to meet you,” he said, stepping forward.  He tried to observe, as Sherlock would have done.  She looked happy, and she wouldn’t be happy if Sherlock was hurt, or ill.  He held his hand out, tentatively, but she was already reaching up towards his shoulders (
“The doctor from Strynn, arrived in London this afternoon, probably went to her hotel to freshen up before continuing to Baker Street.”
“For looking at, sorry, what’s she calling herself today, Persephone?  For looking at Persephone’s legs.  You may look John, I know you can hardly help yourself.  But that is all you may do.”  He looked up at John, not really expecting an answer.
"It's blunt and to the point," Sherlock said, archly, "and within the next forty-eight hours you and I will be well on our way to becoming parents together.  I think I'm allowed to skip acting coy."
John hitched himself forward on his elbows and hovered over Sherlock's face for a moment, looking into his eyes, trying to discern if Sherlock wanted him to move.  Those long fingers carding through his hair, again, urged him forward, and John let his lips brush against Sherlock's.
“Sound thinking,” John said, getting down onto the floor to look at the egg more closely.  At first it appeared to be no more active than usual, which was to say not at all, but as he watched it seemed to shiver, rocking on the large end.  “I left work early because I just felt like something was going to happen.”
"No, when you were hired it was under a scheme that prorated your hours for things like paternity and sick leave.  You won't get much, I admit, but you've been working more of late, and besides, it's still something."
"Of course."  John took the glass into the kitchen and filled it once more.  "That must be a relief."
John leaned his head  against the high back of his desk chair and rubbed at his forehead.  The day had been long enough, but just as they were about to close a frantic mother had called and asked him to re-check a young child with a sore throat. Sarah had prevailed upon him to stay, and he’d agreed.  What he thought was going to be a simple case of reassurance and a feeling of having done well for keeping a child out of A+E turned into a surprise case of epiglottitis and the resulting tense transport to the hospital, all the while trying to convince the child’s mother that yes, this really was necessary.  Then there was the paperwork, and the paperwork he had allowed himself to get behind on over the last few days.  He rubbed the top of his head, trying to stave off the headache, and began.
“No you didn’t,” John said, soft and fond.  She took that moment to open her eyes, her arms flailing above her head, stretching out, toes pointed towards John, brushing against his jumper.  Her stretch was over quickly, limbs lax as she blinked, eyes closing again in an instant.
"I kept thinking that I would explain, soon, and then I never did.  Cowardice.  But I did most of my eating when you were out of the flat, at work, though I also ate meals with you."
“I doubt that even Mycroft has the power to make you a prisoner here,” Sherlock mused.  “Though I also wouldn’t put it past him.  The symbolism would be right up his alley.”
“Bassinette,” Sherlock said.  “Or a proper cot, I can’t tell which.  Though if it’s being placed in my bedroom, I’m guessing bassinette.”
One of the employees crossed the lawn, glancing up at them for a moment.  The first crowds of the day were already amassing at the gate, tourists with itineraries and too much to do in one day crammed on them, to be sure.  John watched the man walk over to the ravens’ enclosure.  He opened the door, and the bird sat on his arm, looking proprietary and calculating.
Sherlock's mouth tightened into a straight line.  "I dislike admitting that anything has the power to make me do anything whatsoever."
"That will take some getting used to."  John set his head down on the edge of the mattress.  He'd acquired a romantic partner, become aware of a subset of humanity he'd had no idea had existed, firmly cemented his identity as a man partnered to a man whereas previously he'd been comfortably bisexual with a preference for dating women, become an expectant father, and upended his usually independent  and somewhat solitary existence for what sounded like a sort of nordic kibbutz.
John's mouth tightened. “You are correct.” Whereas Sherlock had indulged himself in his aloof pursuits into adulthood, John had run headlong into a career that dictated that he had dozens of men he referred to as brothers. It was too obvious, even without Sherlock pointing at every sign.
"If you're not going to drink it, it's not going to do you any good," John pointed out, retrieving the glass.  A glance down at Sherlock's face revealed nothing of concern-- no sunken eyes, no toxic cast to the skin.  It had only been an hour, he realized, but Sherlock did in fact look thinner than usual about the face.
“Mrs. Hudson!”  He was moving again, swift careful steps to where she was lying on her back on the sofa, the egg carefully cradled against her stomach and her arm, leaning on the back of the sofa.
"You said that the egg is formed with a yolk that the fetus feeds off of for nine months.  If you're forming that yolk it would take an enormous amount of calories."
“Um,” John hesitated too long to brush the question off entirely.  “It’s more than just that we’re together.”
"None.  Some distant cousins, in America, but we never speak to them, just the odd Christmas card."  It made life simpler, usually, if lonelier at times.
John kept rubbing Sherlock's hip, wondering if it was hurting him to lie on his side for so long.  "How could I not have noticed?"
"Only a few months after we were together, we decided that we wanted to start a family."  He pressed his lips together, trying not to smile as she had to struggle to swallow the mouthful of water she'd just taken.
"Excited I can see, but why would she want to go shopping?"  John rubbed his thumb against the back of Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock's spine slowly bowed outwards as he pressed himself hard into John, his head coming to rest on John's shoulder.  John turned towards him, mouthing over his neck, his jaw, wet, wide-mouthed near-bites that were too desperate and disorganized to be kisses.  Sherlock twisted towards him, struggling in his tight grip, a high pitched grunt of exertion bringing John back to himself for a moment.
“I see.”  John opened the door to the flat, thinking. Sherlock had never shown a casual closeness with any group before, and referring to all of the egg-born and their children and families as his cousins revealed a side of him that John hadn’t seen before.
"I'm going, I'm going," John groused.  He would have to walk fast to get to the surgery, and he'd be sweaty when he got there, between the nerves and the exertion.
“I’m not,” John said, shifting the egg in his arms.  “I’m not trying to avoid you.  It’s only that you’ve apparently decided that of the two of us you should be incubating the egg and I’m a convenient second.  It leaves me at loose ends when I’m not working.  Why shouldn’t I go to work?”
“Mycroft sent it.  It has the entire Britannica on it.”  Sherlock actually looked happy, and John brushed a hand along the side of his face, lingering over his cheekbone.  It had been a while since Sherlock had looked truly happy, the stress of being primarily responsible for the egg weighing on him.  John resolved in that moment to make more of an effort to take that burden off of him.
“He is. Siguersonn isn't one to call excessively ahead of showing up. He said he would be here tomorrow and so he shall be.” Sherlock glanced at the clock. “Later today, in fact.” Sherlock was quiet for a moment, but with the air of waiting to say something else. “I know that you will get on with him, but I do hope that you like him.”
John hadn't kept track of where they were driving as Mycroft had been speaking, but he felt a tug in his abdomen, and he was willing to bet that it was towards 221B, all set off by Sherlock commanding that he come home.
“We drove by here the day he told me about you,” John told him.  They walked through the open courtyard, passing half a dozen silent workers who took no notice of them.
“No, no, it’s nothing bad, it’s just,” he sighed.  “I’ve got lots more to tell you, all good things, just, it’s a little odd, I suppose.”
John felt the interior of the car swimming before his eyes.  This was it.  Years of being Sherlock's friend had finally caught up with him.  He had gone insane, and was now hallucinating Mycroft telling him that Sherlock was getting ready to lay an egg.
“We are very lucky,” Sherlock said softly, as if volume could keep the fact that he felt such a sentiment secret.  When the toast popped up Sherlock buttered a piece for each of them and they stood leaning over the worktop to catch the crumbs.
Once he was sure John was still, Sherlock climbed up onto the sofa, a foot to either side of John's stretched out legs, perching lightly on him.
John hurried down the stairs, trying to put a pleasant expression on his face as he opened the door.
John forced himself to look up at Sherlock, noting the way the tip of his nose had gone pink, and the triangle of forehead above and between his brows.  “Sherlock?”
When John got downstairs he was surprised to see that Sherlock had his shirt off again, standing in the middle of the living room with the egg now being held loosely by Mycroft, who sat on the sofa.  Zilpha was winding a broad strip of fabric around Sherlock's shoulders, across his back in a tidy X, making a pouch of it just against his stomach.
“Our crib,” Sherlock said as they entered the bedroom.  “She’ll sleep in here for the first year, then move to the nursery.”
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice cracking, his ears feeling filled with water. “Sherlock, what is going on?”
Once inside Anborg unpacked a more impressive set of instruments than John had previously seen from her.  He refrained from asking if those were for his benefit and simply watched as she used a proximity thermometer to measure the temperature of the egg.
"The clothes that are tiny versions of adult clothes, the jeans and jumpers, are appealing, but Mummy assures me that for the first month or so we will appreciate these one piece jumpsuits."
"You are not a gifted liar.  The story that we have a surrogate is going to be all that you can hold up.  When she asks if you have various baby things laid in, you're going to be hopeless at saying that you do."
From the corner of his eye John could see that they both had their mobile phones out already. He let his head fall back on the sofa, already exhausted by the speed at which their minds worked. Whether or not Mrs. Hudson wanted a fortified foyer she was going to get one.
The morning went blessedly quickly, even his paperwork tidy by the time Sarah came around to the doorway of his borrowed office.
John hardly knew what to do with his legs as Sherlock folded himself up, knees near John’s chest, plane of his stomach curving around the egg, face lowered to John’s hip so Sherlock could nip and suck at the soft thin skin there.
Sherlock shrugged.  "No more so than any other human.  My scent is merely the byproduct of diet and hygiene."
John nodded. “Yes, actually, though now that I'm up I might as well stay up, I suppose. When is your father coming?”
John turned the page of his paper, barely aware of Sherlock across the table from him reading his own section of the paper.  He seemed to be flipping through the pages quickly, more quickly than usual, and he'd been restive all morning to boot, but it wasn't until he slammed his hands down on the table that John paid him any mind.
“She won’t go home until well after the child has been hatched.  It will take some time to falsify her records, and it would be easiest to explain if we wait until she’s attained a birth weight more common to a gestated infant.”
Ann was opening the case that John had carried up the steps-- inside was a simple light box, with a surrounding plexiglass frame.
“That's something I've never heard you say before,” John said. “Though based on what you and Anborg have told me, I'm sure that I will, once I get to know him a bit.”
John went, leaning over the arm of the sofa to kiss Sherlock goodbye, a startlingly normal moment in the midst of what had been nearly three days of madness.  Even though he knew the temperature was normal, he couldn’t help but feel the difference in Sherlock’s lips, couldn’t help pressing his own forehead against Sherlock’s to gauge his fever.  Still low, but definitely there.
"I know, I know."  John felt like spinning around in the center of the room, barely restrained himself.  "Why do I feel like this?"
"Oh god."  Sherlock's utterance was quiet, but carried a deep sense of horror.  John looked behind himself, then down at the paper, before asking.
"Yeah, I am.  Did you have somewhere in mind?"  He could have kicked himself, but in the stress of not knowing quite how to tell her, he hadn't even thought that far ahead.
"Yes, you did tell me that."  She lingered over the wine list for a moment, then set the menu at the side of her plate.  "But there was something else?"
"I had considered mailing a letter to myself, leaving the postmark intact, and presenting it to you should this situation arise.  However, I suspect that you consider Mycroft both able to interfere with the mail and willing to help me."
John looked down at her cord.  It looked normal, if drier than others he had seen, the remnants of the yolk a shriveled orange ball at the end of it.  Annborg reached between them and set a plastic clamp around it close to the baby’s skin, then clicked it shut.
'Happens sometimes, what do you mean?"  John had never known him to have any kind of irritable bowel issue.
"Sherlock is extremely unusual, on one of only seven such individuals in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though northern Europe has a small population of people like him."
John looked at their sleeping daughter and tried to imagine her as Johannah. “It doesn’t suit her as well, I don’t think.  And it’s a bit on the nose.”
“Well naturally. He’d never met Egzanthe before.”  They leaned closer and closer until their heads were touching, casting her in shade, the curve of their bodies a warm space for the sleeping infant.  Everything John knew narrowed down to the sight of her, the press of Sherlock’s hand and side against his own, the sound of their breathing. Eventually the door would open, other people would come in.  She would need a nappy, soon, and clothes. For the moment John allowed the tiny space to be his entire world, and dared to believe it was real.
"We'll wait and see which of us the child most resembles, then make up some story about how we've been secretly in love for months and we hired a surrogate.  Or, we could claim that a prior love interest found herself pregnant and rather than place the child for adoption by strangers kindly allowed us to adopt.  Probably more believable if the child resembles you, I'll admit."
John felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up.  He knew that candling didn’t have anything to do with an actual flame, not now, anyway, but the urge to protect the egg was still strong.
Once she shut the door John sank back down into the same sort of trance he’d been in earlier, the egg, and Sherlock, the only things in his field of view or on his mind.  When the egg rocked, shifting the blankets beneath it, they both gasped, leaning closer, John’s forehead pressed to Sherlock’s temple.
"Yes," John hissed, feeling the heat gathering at the base of his spine, spreading and gathering, tightening up his sac.  "Wank yourself."  His thighs burned with the effort of staying crouched, back aching as he wound up curved over Sherlock's body.  The bed shook and bounced alarmingly with every thrust, and he barely noticed.
Sherlock’s father grasped his upper arm and looked at him for a moment, the closest, John presumed, that they’d come to an embrace.
"Yes.  There is, however, potential for an intense emotional and mental torment.  Still, once the hormones have cleared, that, too, will be over and done with."
And it would continue to be a while, he thought, as he glanced into Speedy's.  He'd been interrupted from his own cup of coffee by Sherlock's... emergency, and he was considering stopping in, having a cup there, maybe a look at the paper, see if there was a copy of What's On lying about.  Instead what he saw was Mycroft Holmes, looking decidedly at home, umbrella propped against the side of the table as he drank his cup of coffee.
“Of course.”  Annborg shut the door behind her as she left, and John felt cocooned again, content to occupy the few square feet that held the three of them.
John brushed his teeth, getting angrier by the second.  Once out in the lounge again he checked his phone- no messages.  He sent one more.
“Why didn’t you just say?”  John sat down on one side of the sofa, hoping that Sherlock would join him.
“Just one more to see, then I’ll be done,” John said.  “Probably for the best.  I can’t stop thinking I should go home and wait for something to happen.”
“You have gone warm all over,” John pointed out.  “Your body temperature rises a little when you’re holding the egg.  It’s hormonal.”
"You said you made that video in case this situation arose.  Did you not know you were about to," he paused, then rested his hand on Sherlock's abdomen, hoping that Sherlock wouldn't call him on his reluctance to try to find the right words, or say them out loud.
John was silent for a moment, looking at Ann, who seemed to be making a point of looking at the steer skull on the wall.  Sherlock had stated that they couldn’t stop the development of the foetus, not that he
John closed his eyes tighter, as if that would help.  "It's not about what I want, Sherlock.  In a few weeks, or a few months, or a few years, when this wears off, what then.  I won't let you hate me for tricking you when you were vulnerable."
"I won't even ask why that's significant," John said, but he took the money, grateful for that little reprieve.
“We need to consider names,” John said, suddenly desperate to make sure that Sherlock didn’t choose something esoteric, then remembered whose family he was dealing with.  Zilpha, Sigurson, Mycroft, and Sherlock.  He started to giggle, aware that he hadn’t laughed in some time as the breath came rushing out of him so.
“John! John!” The voice was Sherlock's, really, truly Sherlock's, and John wondered for a moment how he could have thought the apparition in his dream sounded anything like the man keeping him from flying off the edge of the bed. “John, you're having a nightmare.”
John and Sherlock peered down into the egg.  Their heads, pressed together, blocked much of the light, but John could just make out what seemed like a soft pale dome, rising and falling minutely, as if she was already breathing the atmospheric air that she’d let in.
“Yes.” Sherlock turned the egg over, caressing it as he did. “I'm quite aware of that. Looking forward to it, even, but in a grown man like my father a lack of noisome demands is refreshing.”
"Very good, John.  Yes, I have been eating, far more than usual, and as you might have noticed from the shape of my face the development of the yolk has also cost me most of my own fat storage as well."
"I'm very sure, m'am," he said, and John had to hide his smile at the obvious note of fear in the younger man's voice.  Mycroft would have made sure it was there, and a wave of relief at that very thought washed over him.  How could he worry about the lack of a birth certificate when Mycroft had been involved, however uncouth it might have seemed at the time, from before the moment of conception?
“The Themes,” Sherlock replied. “It’s not half clean at this time of the year, and the scent was repellent. “  John breathed in deeply and thought he could smell some of it still, likely clinging to Sherlock’s hair, which was covering his head in stiff ringlets.
John turned himself around so he was looking up at Sherlock, who was looming over him now.  "Sometimes it is kinder not to be entirely to the point.  We've discussed this."
Sherlock's movements seemed uncoordinated, his hand fumbling as John continued to yank up on Sherlock's hips with every thrust.  It didn't matter, though, the coiling pressure and heat that had been building inside him finally reached a tipping point.  He tried to hold himself still as his cock pulsated, hot shocks of pleasure rocketing through him, arching his back, Sherlock held all the more tightly to him as he tried to stand.  Sherlock came then, too, rippling waves of heat squeezing John's over sensitive cock, and he heard himself grunt as he came, feet pressing hard into the mattress as he leaned back, lifting Sherlock off the bed, held tight into the curve of his pelvis, the entire world seeming to shake and crash as he spent inside him one last time.
John heard the words echo from years ago, the first night they’d ever spent together, though in vastly different circumstances.  That night had ended with Chinese, too.  John was sure it wasn’t a coincidence.  He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock softly on the lips.
After about twenty minutes any sense of worry he had was replaced by irritation at Sherlock’s comment-- that he didn’t have a good partner.  What was John doing at work if not trying to lay in a nest egg for their child?  Their child, who they conceived on the very first day of their romantic relationship, and, who John added, in his own mind, was going  to finish gestating in a matter of weeks, hardly a normal situation at all.
"As you can see, John, I'm naked."  He strode off towards John's room, leaving John to look at the carnage of Sherlock's room-- broken bed, disheveled linens, pants all over.  He sighed and went to answer the door.
John’s jaw started to ache, his shoulder burning faintly as his body began to protest being held in one position for so long.  He moved his free hand from Sherlock’s hip, sliding it up the curve of his arse, tracing the cleft there.  Sherlock mimicked his motions, pressing down against John’s arse, just as John was doing the same to him.  John’s crack was already slick, sopping from the liberal application of Sherlock’s saliva.  John brought his hand to his face, swiped the slick off his own chin, and brought his finger back to Sherlock’s hole, pushing down.
John shook his head.  "I'm just a locum so it's unpaid anyway, but you're right, I should get on that."
"Alright, fine, I see your point, but it doesn't change the fact that Lestrade is going to ask where you are, might even show up at the flat looking for you."
Sherlock merely nodded.  John stood up, wanting to comfort him, though he wasn’t even sure that was the right word.  Sherlock didn’t look upset as such, merely locked into some thought or other.  A slight twitch of Sherlock’s hand warned him away and he went into the kitchen instead.
“Is there anything else you can tell?”  He thought of reports of ultrasounds that he’d read.  He wasn’t proficient at performing them, but he knew that they reported on the four chambers of the heart, the nuchal fold of the neck, the development of hands and feet.  Looking at the silhouette, he felt oddly wrong-footed, as if he were looking at the world through a filmy glass.
“No, not really,” John agreed.  Inside the tower it was cool and dim, only the barest lights on and the light through the narrow windows.  Without the press of bodies the air was still, nearly moist, like a deep cellar.  They walked to the room with the crown jewels, passing a security guard who did not so much as nod at them.
John curled up with his face to the back of the sofa, the egg tucked into the space between his abdomen, thighs, and the sofa back, and dozed off.
“See if you can drink some of this.”  He held the cup up to her lips, and she bent her head forward obediently, sipping at it.
"It's taken care of."  Sherlock stretched, his feet striking the foot board then sliding up over the curved edge.  "Mycroft concocted a story about how I'd finally given in and begun working for the government.  If Lestrade is in a tight spot and needs my particular skills, he can call on Mycroft."
he pointed out.  It was useless, though, he was pulling on his coat before Sherlock could even text back.
John felt his breath catch in his throat.  Unable to answer, he simply pressed a kiss to Sherlock's sternum, then stood, stretching out the kink that had formed in his lower back.
He helped her to her flat, covered her with a light blanket when she laid herself down on her bed.  He made sure that she had a beaker of water and her phone near her before he left, promising to check on her in an hour if they’d not heard from her.
“Dare I ask about your father?”  With his eyes closed he felt like he was floating in a warm cloud, Sherlock and the egg the only grounding forces.
Sherlock looked unusually relaxed, pliant, even, the opposite of the alert calculating look he might have assumed Sherlock would take.
“Hours, I would think,” she said.  “If there’s anyone else you want here, you should tell them now.”
“It’s irrelevant.”  Sherlock reached into the box and retrieved the egg, holding it to his abdomen under his shirt.
"No," John said, closing his own eyes.  "Don't say it.  It's hormones, they're going to tear you apart anyway.  Don't make it worse for yourself."  He leaned one arm on the edge of the sofa, let himself lean forward until he could feel Sherlock's body heat against his face, could smell the clean soapy scent of his skin.
Sherlock waved his hand, dismissing the idea.  He already looked healthier.  “It’s not a fever, really.  I found today tiresome, but doubtlessly that was because it was the first day I had to spend left to my own devices.  I read a great deal.  I slept.”  He looked almost abashed at that admission.
“In a way, yes,” John pointed out.  “You can leave a child to sleep on its own for whole minutes at a time.  A child can be left in a cot while you go to the loo and you don’t have to think for even one second that it might be so cold that it will spontaneously die.”
Sherlock waved his hand imperiously, as if he could push away John’s discomfort.  “I know you don’t function like that at work, John.  We may lack the modern tests that you’ve grown used to relying on, but that doesn’t mean we’ve gone unobserved.”
John's arms and legs were shaking as he carefully lowered both himself and Sherlock to the bed.  His knees fought to find purchase on the smooth sheets, his head spinning as he made sure that Sherlock was all the way back down before he relaxed his arms.  A moment later he realized why everything felt so wrong.
"What's hurting you?" John asked, taking him by the arm.  To his surprise Sherlock actually did lean on him, walking, shuffling, really, towards the door.
“You know what I mean.”  She went back to cutting the chicken into broad strips, the skin already neatly disposed of.
“There never was an egg, John, not really. It was just an illusion that you were all too willing to go along with. Think about it.” He waited, as if he were a teacher and John was a recalcitrant student. “Could you really, truly believe something so ridiculous?”
John slid in, curling around the egg as Sherlock straightened his legs.  The surface was warm and dry.
John tapped on the screen and it stayed dark for a moment, a sort of indistinct cacophony coming from the tiny speaker.  It sounded like a crowd, a boisterous one, though muffled somehow.
John hitched himself forward, used his free hand to guide himself as he pushed in.  After the first inch, the first touch of wet hot tight now now now, he was all but sucked in, his hips canting forward without a thought until he could feel his balls brushing against Sherlock's skin.  Even then, he kept pushing, as if there was some way he could get in deeper.  He tried to speak, but heard his own voice, muffled by Sherlock's back, coming out as nothing but a whimper.
“Please,” Sherlock said.  John nodded as Mycroft walked past them, squeezing John’s right shoulder briefly before he left.
"I'll be here by then," John said, trying not to think of all the times he had missed her in the past.
“We shouldn’t have left you alone for so long,” John said, relieved to see that the glassy look to her eyes was resolving.
Sherlock shook his head.  "Liberal.  I should be able to attend, myself, without getting into too much trouble."
“That’s true,” Annborg said, moving from her spot on the bed to stand in front of them.  “In most respects she will have the same milestones as a gestational infant.”
"I know.  But this," he sighed, knowing he was dangerously close to insulting Sherlock's family.  "I'm not used to it."
John grasped the door jamb, overcome suddenly.  Mycroft anticipating their need for a bottle was the very least of all that he’d done, along with Sherlock’s parents, and then there was the support they’d already had from the “cousins” he’d only heard about. The egg was hatched and Egzanthe was here, a real living child, but Mycroft and the rest of Sherlock’s family weren’t going to disappear now that this bit of drama was over. He looked up at Mycroft’s perpetually placid face, his impeccable suit, and was hit by the realization that Mycroft must have endured incredible suffering keeping Sherlock’s whereabouts a secret for the years that he was gone. Without that sacrifice from this man that John had always found intimidating he wouldn’t have Sherlock, or Egzanthe, or the rest of his life as he knew it, for however many years that might yet be. Mycroft, who had held the egg with such tenderness, who had helped engineer John’s acceptance of the entire idea of Sherlock bearing an egg, who had supported them from the very first,
"I can't," John began, not even sure of what it was that he was refusing to do.  He had just confronted his own heart, his own certainty that he never wanted to be without Sherlock again.  He'd long ago filed his crush on the man, his attraction, under N for Never Going To Happen, and now Mycroft was telling him that soon (days? hours?) Sherlock would be begging him to
"As I said, once a baby is involved, people tend to believe anything.  We should say that I was the sperm donor, as well."
"It wouldn't be obvious, at first, but it would already be happening.  Mummy said she knew right away."  He placed his hand on the egg near John's hand, so that hardly any of the egg was visible.
John pulled, and with barely any effort the entire dome of the egg came away, revealing a tiny face, chin tilted up, eyes closed.  John let his gaze roam over the features of his child, the eyes and nose set perfectly above the rounded cheeks, the chin receded like any infants (though as it was Sherlock’s child, that might never change, he thought), and then the tiny neck and the clavicles below, the thin web of flesh between them rising and falling evenly.
John held his hips tighter, aware, in the back of his mind, that he was likely bruising Sherlock's skin where it stretched over his bones, but unable to care.
“Will do.”  John took a moment to compose himself outside the door.  The ground felt firm under his feet, the door handle its usual coolness under his fingers.  The sensations and sounds and scents of London were too vivid to be written off as a dream.
“John has never met my father,” Sherlock said as John brought out the tray with the tea and milk.  A few mismatched biscuits from the bottom of a tin rounded out the presentation.  John hoped that they were not stale.  “Nor have I really told him that much.”
John sat himself just as Anthea was bringing the last of the food to the table-- to John's relief she sat down too, and they filled their plates with rice and stir-fry, passing their plates back and forth like any other family gathered around a small table.  Sherlock, somewhat encumbered by the egg, allowed John to serve him.
"Did either of your parents ever remarry?"  John found that his body had adjusted to the higher temperature-- instead of making him feel feverish he felt relaxed, totally at ease.
The feeling that washed over John felt surprisingly like heartbreak, a sudden jolt of sharp pain to his chest. A wave of overwhelming love and warmth seemed to wrap around him, Sherlock, and Egzanthe, all receding as the pain left.  It stood to reason that if his love for his child would make his heart grow it might be by cracking open and healing over, and he felt it as a new tenderness, a new vulnerable spot that he would carry for her forever. He turned his hand palm up to squeeze Sherlock’s hand, just for a moment, needed to turn it back to keep a firm hold on Egzanthe.
Sarah gasped softly.  "You've got to tell Judith in the front office, so she'll stop putting you in for shifts.  Did you put in for paternity leave?"
"There wasn't much chance of me cooking at Baker Street," John allowed, thinking of the state of the kitchen back then.
“Nothing? There was a baby in there, Sherlock there is a baby, our baby.” His vision was swimming red, his ears filling with a rushing hissing noise, like the falling of distant mortars. “Where is it, where is the cot, Sherlock, what did you do with it?”
Sherlock sat down next to him, a firm hand on his leg. “You said at the beginning that not knowing was one of life's last great mysteries, even for parents who are having a gestational child. I inferred that you didn't want to know.”
“About four milliliters,” Sherlock said. “Not bad considering her stomach has never taken in anything other than her own saliva.”  He pulled the bottle away, leaving her open mouthed.  “I’m sure she could do with winding.”
John shook his head even as the urge to grab on to that excuse made itself known.  "I was just an arse."
“He's not particular. Despite his demeanor he is a very easy man to cater to. His most strident wish was to remain living in Norway. Other than that he has no real preferences as to food, sleeping accommodations, temperature, noise, or any of the other things that I would find tiresome to cater to.”
"The singer?"  John ran his hand down the back of the egg, wishing he could feel movement, or the bumps of spine and elbow and knees.  "I thought babies did best with Mozart."
“You see but you don’t observe,” Sherlock said.  “I know this.  This time, though, I put it up to willfulness, or, as you might say, thoughtlessness.   That was perhaps unfair of me.”
“The eye rolling?  Yes. She can’t really control her eye muscles yet.”  John felt a swell of relief as she sighed, inflating her tiny chest and pressing her spine against his hand.  She was a small but healthy baby, by all appearances, but her unusual entrance into the world had him watching her like a hawk.
John lifted his head, ready to challenge him, then thought better of it.  “Yeah, alright, but I get to do the same to you.”
When he returned to the lounge he found that Sherlock had tidied the coffee table, placing a pitcher of water and a beaker within easy reach, as well as the television remote and Mrs. Hudson’s knitting basket.
John fought against his knee-jerk urge to ask "how did that make you feel," knowing that with Sherlock, anyway, it was the wrong tack.
“No kidding,” John managed, gasping as he fought to sit up straight. “Sorry. Sorry. Is the egg alright?”
“How so?”  John found he could barely keep his hands off the egg, wondered how he was ever going to manage to eat if he was holding the egg during dinner.
John sighed as she drank again, this time holding the glass herself.  “Be that as it may, Sherlock, it’s the done thing to express your concern at your unwitting culpability when something like this happens.”
"Yeah, ok," John said, not wanting to press the issue any further, nor to insist that Sherlock had anything other than social machination on his mind.  "Where, do you think?"
“Gestational infants probably cry to help clear their lungs of amniotic fluid, and because of the pressure of birth.  Maybe the light and the temperature difference too.  She’s consumed all the fluid in the egg so her lungs are dry and she’s been used to this temperature for a while.”
“That he will never be without help again, for the rest of his life,” Mycroft said, finally letting go of John’s arm.
“What shall we name you?” Sherlock asked, his voice soft.  The baby had closed her eyes again, barely stirring as he spoke.
as they referred to us, children who had been hatched.  They were, for all intents and purposes, my cousins.  It was a happy time, and the idea of secrecy was woven into the stories that we were told.  Secrecy imparted to children by adults is considered sinister in most cases, but this was entirely benign.  By the time we came back to England Sherlock was three, and I was ten.  The most exotic thing about me, other than my intellect, which I was able to conceal just to the point of assimilation, was the fact that I spoke Norwegian.  It never occurred to me to tell anyone that I'd come from an egg.  It just wasn't a topic that ever presented itself."
"There's nothing difficult about it.  Within a matter of days the egg that has been forming inside my ovipositor for the last two weeks will be complete, a series of hormonal checks and balances will be in place, and I will, through a combination of a generous dose of endogenous muscle relaxants and peristaltic contractions, lay an egg.  I've done it before, though I do have to say that the first episode, while memorable, was probably not entirely representative, given that I was an adolescent and not fully an adult, and the egg, being minus any actual genetic material, was somewhat smaller than this one will be."  He drank again.
“Essentially, John, I do not want our child to ever use the word survival to refer to her childhood, her time in our house, or us. I hope that is enough to reassure you that even though we may differ in how we approach her, our aims will ultimately be the same.”
She looked away as soon as she saw John looking, carefully placed her napkin on the table, and pushed her chair away.
"I know that it is good enough for my brother, and there has never been another person about whom that could be said."  It wasn't an answer, but John decided to let it go, nodded to show his assent.
“Do you have everything you’ll need?” Anborg asked.  “I hope you say no, because I’ve got a care package from Strynn here.”  She indicated the largest case that she’d carried up with her.
“The ravens don’t keep London from falling.” John rubbed his hand up the furrow of Sherlock’s spine, rumpling his tee-shirt.  “I could say the same about you.”  He held his hand tight to the base of Sherlock’s neck. “Please, just for a few more weeks.  When the baby comes, we’ll figure out what to do then.”
John looked down at his phone, as if willing Sherlock to intrude on the madness that was the inside of the car.  Within the space of four breaths, he did.
“I am,” John said.  “I’m not scheduled to work tomorrow but Sarah asked me to keep myself available.”
“She seems very nice.  I only spoke with her for a few moments.”  John turned the egg slightly, rotating its smooth surface against his skin.  It was almost instinctual, trying to make sure it was evenly heated.  Even though it had been less than a minute he could feel his temperature going up, a certain amount of heat behind his eyes.  It wasn’t painful, but it was still, even after the weekend he’d spent with the egg on and off, surprising.
In response, Sherlock rolled onto his stomach, arms folded under his head, then lifted his ass in the air.
John watched as Egzanthe seemed to slow down, her suckling becoming more erratic. “How much has she taken in?” he asked.
“John, go, we’re fine.”  Sherlock was half-reclined on the couch, the egg a bump under his jumper.  His right hand held the egg steady while he held a thin book in the other hand, balanced against the back of the sofa.  (The book was written in French.
Sherlock nodded. “Echos of my previous betrayal, of course.” He put his hand on the table, palm up. “I will never, at any cost, lie to you again.”
“I’m guessing that she likes to garden?  Or perhaps she has horses.”  He knew he was wrong from the moment he spoke.
Mycroft’s assistant (she was calling herself Persephone) had casually kicked the pants and other garments to one side of the room with her pointy shoe and directed the movers to take away the broken bed.  The linens went with it-- sensible enough, John thought, since Sherlock’s bed had been a single and his was a double.  The one that was brought up in pieces and assembled by a team of proficient and entirely silent men was a queen sized one and John only had to ponder that for a few moments before deciding that Mycroft had chosen it based on not only the size but the name.  The wood was a dark cherry with a low, modern profile.  Rounded edges, John was grateful to note, having a habit of running into things with his hip in the night.  He had stood in the corner of the room, at first, supervising, but really, in the way, and unable, as usual, to take his eyes off Anthea’s shapely legs.  For all that her eyes never strayed from her phone, he knew that she knew.  Finally, he extracted himself with a mumbled excuse that no one acknowledged.
"It's fine. Keep watching."  Sherlock was staring at the ceiling, his hands folded beneath his chin.
"How are we going to raise this baby?" John asked.  "In terms of church, I mean.  How are we going to deal with that?  How many other important questions have I not even thought of?  How could I not have thought of that until now?"
Mycroft actually looked sympathetic.  "You must understand, John, I've been exposed to this idea for many years.  Most of my life.   I was six years old when Mummy laid the egg that was going to be Sherlock.  Towards the end of his gestation, when he was very nearly viable, I was allowed to keep him warm."
“The egg is gone, John. It never really was an egg, not as you understand an egg to be. It was just an illusion.” Sherlock's smile was ugly, his mouth twisted to a strange extent. “You know I'm good at those.”
“Lovely,” she said, as she walked away.  In any other person John would have taken the tone to mean she’d ignored everything Sherlock had said, but he knew that she’d not only heard, but transmitted the minutiae to Mycroft before she’d even turned around.
John tried to read into Sherlock's tone, but he merely sounded sleepy and content, as if the subject didn't bother him at all.
“You get lonely!” John nearly laughed, surprised at himself that he hadn’t seen it before.  “You say you get bored but really you’re lonely.”
John relaxed a bit at that.  If Sherlock hadn’t texted to say what his actual ETA was before, it was only that that wasn’t his MO ever, at all, not that it was a new form of incivility.
"You couldn't trust me to know that you were alive, you certainly can't trust me to keep up a convincing front that you're gone while you're living in the flat."  John tried to keep the petulant anger out of his voice, but it still stung.  It didn't hurt when he wansn't thinking about it, didn't assail him out of nowhere as the grief had when Sherlock was truly gone, nor was it as strong as the anger when he'd first returned, but it was still there, if John thought about it.
"Now, please, are you satisfied?"  Sherlock moaned as John withdrew his fingers, deliberately dragging them over the swell of his prostate as he did.
"I would have gone wherever Mycroft went, of course, but as far as I know the choice was not presented to him.  Mummy and Father divided their tasks along fairly well established gender lines.  Mummy raised us, but we went to Norway for summer holidays and once every winter."
Sherlock reached forward slowly, so slowly that John didn't flinch despite his outstretched finger landing directly on the tip of his nose. "Your columella is distinctly lower than your ala, which are even," Sherlock said, pressing slightly on the tip of his nose, until the cartilage gave slightly.  "That feature is highly correlated with what is aesthetically referred to as a Roman nose, although in truth it's quite common amongst Germanic people as well.  Your nose, though, does not possess the coarser bridge that often goes with that nose, and while the tip of your nose is turned up, just here," he slid his finger disarmingly close to John's nostril, "it is not a snub nose.  In a police artist's composite book, a picture of your nose would be filed under both Roman and Ideal, and there would be hundreds of like examples."
The front door closed, the last of Mycroft’s workers gone.  Sherlock swung his legs out of the bed and stood, still neatly wrapped in the sheet, egg cradled to his stomach.  “Let’s see then, shall we?”
In the case was the warming pad as she had promised, and a soft flat pad for the baby to lie on in a bigger bed with raised firm sides.
“Remember, John, he is like me, but he is not me. I am my father's son, but I had the tempering softness of my mother as well.”
At first John thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, or the light had shifted, but there was truly a thin crack running along the top third of the shell.  As he watched it widened and other cracks sprang from its edges, reaching towards the thicker ridge that ran around the middle.
“In your case, I am sure they’d be preferences.”  Sherlock stood and nudged John towards the stairs, giving him a kiss as they both stood at the bottom.  “I will wake you if you should risk sleeping through my father’s arrival.”
"Technically, yes, but the truth is that hatched children do well on either babymilk or real milk, and it's at a high enough demand here that I would not want to deny a truly premature infant of what it needed."
“Sherlock, I got you lemonade,” John called as he let himself in, closing the door behind him by leaning on it, his hands full with keys and the carrier bag.  “It’s blood orange, so I think it will be tart, do you want a glass right now?”  When he looked up he froze, for a moment, realizing that the person in Sherlock’s usual chair was not, in fact, Sherlock, but a woman, her silver hair swept up into a loose chignon.
"No, I was only just up the street and Sherlock's brother happened to mention to me that you were on your way to Piccadilly.  It would have been silly of me not to give you a lift."
John handed it over with a little trepidation-- they’d only ever set the egg down for a few moments, and always in a soft nest of blankets or other soft material.  On the stark white surface of the light array it looked incredibly vulnerable, wobbling for a moment as Sherlock took his hands away.
John lied on his side, propped against Sherlock, who was flat on his back once more, the dressing gown now discarded.  John couldn't stop resting his head against Sherlock's chest, practically nuzzling into his armpit.
John's brow furrowed as he tried to place the acronym, then remembered.  Oral rehydration therapy-- technically the mainstay of his practice in regards to people with GI complaints, though outside of the army he hadn't actually referred to it as ORT.
"That was going to be my next question," John said.  "How can you be sure that the baby will resemble you?"
“Irrelevant?”  John wondered how Sherlock could consider any piece of data irrelevant, especially the health and development of his child.
John sighed but did as she’d suggested, laying out the last of their mismatched (but genuine) silverware just as Mrs. Holmes came back into the kitchen.
“Did you have any sense as to whether your baby is male or female?” Sigeursonn asked. To hear him refer to the egg as a baby seemed surprisingly sentimental.
John finally worked up the momentum to pull backwards, nearly groaning with the loss of the tight warm slick, then snapped his hips forward.  He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's hips, holding him tight against his own pelvis, his thrusts short and hard, the urge to somehow get himself deeper into Sherlock's body almost overwhelming.
John leaned his head against the back of the seat.  "It's not obvious to me, however much you think it should be."  They were driving through Southwark, and he wondered if the driver had any destination at all in mind.
As soon as she was gone Anthea set the knife down and turned to John.  “I need you to understand something,” she said, her voice low and urgent.
Sherlock looked at him carefully, slowly scanning his face in a way that John had come to know had less to do with actually looking at his features and more to do with accessing his mind palace, the files marked John Watson.
“I know we can’t help her but I don’t know how she’ll have the leverage to get out of there now that it’s so cracked,” Sherlock said.  “I can feel the cracks spreading against my hand.”
"I was thinking to myself, about the milk, had I ever heard you be that altruistic.  Then it occurred to me, that you hiding for a year, knowing that I thought you were dead, that would have been altruism as well.  I just thought of that year, and how I'd never really truly considered what it was like for you."  He sighed, his breath shuddering as if he'd been crying, though his throat hadn't even felt thick.
“It was good enough that I have looked forward to meeting you, and I have no qualms about you being a partner to my son.”
"Having all that sorted out.  Mycroft made it sound as if you'd have a much more difficult time of it."
John opened his eyes and looked up at Sherlock's earnest face, and couldn't help but smile at him.  "Why can't you just say that it makes you happy to see me."
Sherlock smiled at her, meeting her gaze without a second thought, as if he weren’t literally naked, in bed.
“About eighteen days, give or take a few,” Sherlock said. “I was apparently quite reluctant to come out of my egg. There is some variation.”
"Be that as it may, how are we going to keep him from worrying about you?  You can't let him think that you've disappeared again."
John managed to shuffle backwards, awkwardly, on his knees, trying to pull out of Sherlock slowly, as if that would have an appreciable difference in terms of the likelihood of conception.  It was almost too easy, after how tight Sherlock had been, and as he looked down at Sherlock in the low afternoon light it seemed that he was more open than ever.  John reached out, tracing a fingertip around the dark pink flesh, marveling at how slick he still was.  He added a second finger and slipped inside without any resistance, pushed down to feel the expected elastic resistance, but there was none, Sherlock's flesh giving way as easily as if he were pushing on the corner of his own mouth.
“John, what’s happening, is she alright?”  For a brief moment John thought Sherlock was referring to the egg, then realized that of course he had no way of knowing if the tiny being  inside the shell was alright or not.
She shook her head.  “I’m fine, thanks.  The box is ready.  Sherlock, would you like to put the egg inside?”
“Who is your last case?” she asked, then shook her head as John held the chart out to her.  “That won’t be quick.”  She took the edge of the file in her hand.  “I know him from his last visit a few weeks ago.  He’s a talker.  Let me see him for you, and you can go now.”
John laid his hand gently along the side of her chest, feeling the comforting rhythm of her breath.  It was the usual erratic pattern of the newborn, several shallow breaths followed by something like a gasp or a sigh. “A golden haired woman.”
“I did not.”  Sherlock folded the shirt and set it aside, a slight moue twisting his mouth as he looked away from it, but not back at John.
“It’s barely warmer than human skin, and the light will let us see the shape of the developing foetus.”
“It’s a neat fiction that works in two directions,” Sherlock said.  “For all that I am proficient in duplicity, I believe I tell the truth far more often than the two of them combined, if you count their lies of omission.”
John looked at him sharply, trying to remember if Mycroft had ever lied to him.  By omission, perhaps, but never an outright lie.
"John."  Sherlock grabbed his hand, pushed it down and in, harder than John would have dared, and he felt it, the distinct curve, firm, out of place and yet perfectly, for now, part of Sherlock.  Sherlock guided his hand around his abdomen, describing the shape of the egg.  It felt huge, no matter what Sherlock said about endogenous muscle relaxants.  They ended with their hands against Sherlock's sternum, Sherlock's hand still over John's.
“I think so.” John kissed his forehead as he stood up, tucking a blanket closer around the egg as he walked away.
“We’re fine.  Go to work.”  Sherlock kissed him hard on the mouth, then turned back to his book.  “Yes, Doctor Watson, I’ll drink plenty of fluids and I will eat while you’re gone.  I promise.”
“The only reason Sarah believes your far-fetched story is that the alternative, the truth, is so ludicrous.”
"Now."  Just one word, but his voice broke, making it sound like a question-- making it sound like he was begging.
"Thank you."  He leaned forward and kissed her cheek, bending at the waist.  John wondered again how tall his father was.   She let her hand linger on his cheek as he stood.  "My beautiful boys," she said, softly, turning to look at Mycroft.  John looked at him too-- he was quiet, still dressed as he'd always seen him, to the nines, and wearing an expression that on anyone else would be termed a sulk, but on Mycroft was likely just deep thought.  Sherlock wandered towards the kitchen table, engrossed in looking at and touching the egg.  Mycroft stood and offered his mother his arm.  She accepted, laughing softly even as she swatted at him, and he looked appeased.
Before he knew it he was in the kitchen, leaning against the door frame as a protection against a sudden wave of dizziness. Sherlock was standing at the kitchen table, a toxic array of beakers and flasks bubbling away over the bunsen burners. The entire kitchen was filling with a fug of greenish smoke that made his eyes sting.
John accepted her, holding her with both hands around her rib cage, easily encircling her tiny form, before setting her against his shoulder, his right hand holding her bottom.
“This can be a good compromise if you want the baby to be in your bed some evening,” she said.  John took it in his hand and examined it, found it to be of sound design.
“You should eat something while you have the chance,” Zilpha said.  “Once the baby is here, you won’t be able to think of anything else for a while.”
Egzanthe threw her arms over her head suddenly, eyes opening as she smacked her lips, turning her head from side to side.
“Well.”  Sherlock sounded pleased as he stepped out of the car.  “John, how would you like to see the Tower in a way that few have ever seen it?”
“He did, but he’s always got to have the last word,” Sherlock said, pulling on a soft gray t-shirt and a pair of matching bottoms.
John felt himself slipping out as Sherlock stretched his back, and let it happen.  When he looked down his cock was glistening with a thick layer of Sherlock's lubrication.
"I'm going to tell her about our impending baby."  Sherlock was well within hearing range, but just out of sight, setting up the microscope on the kitchen table.
"No, not that strange at all that you helped hatch egg-Sherlock."  John groaned, still resigned to being within the throes of some hallucination.  "How the hell did your parents keep you from telling the other children at school?"
"What are we going to do with you?" John asked.  "I mean, now.   You're going to become insufferable, aren't you, asking me to fetch things?"
“The agency had us interview a couple of women.  She just seemed genuinely bright and kind.  And to tell you the truth, she looks a bit like the Watson side of my family.  She’s got similar coloring to me.  Similar nose.”
“Of course.”  He took the scissors from Annborg and reached down for the cord, holding it steady as he clipped it just against the clamp.  He tilted it to look at the cut end, squinting in the low light.  Annborg turned on the flashlight on her phone, shining the light on the cut end of the cord so John could see the three dots that meant she’d had three vessels connecting her to the yolk.
To his surprise Sherlock was smiling.  "I may be under the influence, but that was not the genesis of this.  I can prove it to you."  He pulled his phone out of the pocket of his dressing gown and handed it to John.
"That wouldn't make your own needs any less, I don't believe, so for now, while we can, do not think of hiding this sort of reaction from me."
John stood and stretched, ready to go back to bed.  “You know, I might begin to have some noisome demands of my own.”
"She can hear us?" John knew that gestating babies could hear their parents of course, but the shell seemed so impermeable compared to flesh.
"Of course."  John reached down to touch the egg, glad Sherlock couldn't see the smirk on his face.  If anyone could have used the comfort of placing their cares in the hands of the divine, it would be Mycroft.
“Not these, particularly,” Sherlock said.  “When Moriarty feigned to steal them, it was actually a set of replicas.  These are the real items.”
John shifted himself to the edge of the bed.  “I’ll go down and get a bottle for her.” Just walking to the door felt like tearing himself away, and he startled as he opened the door only to reveal Mycroft on the other side.
“Honestly, nothing,” Sherlock said. “We have the bottle warmer, the steriliser, all the clothes and linens, the bassinet, bath things.” He paused. “Diapers of course, Mycroft recommended a service and we've got them on standby, but I have to admit, I'm reticent about allowing that many people access to the house.”
John went to the coat hook, pulled his jacket on, and slowly walked down the stairs.  As a doctor he was worried about dehydration, bleeding, and, worst of all, the possibility of a vaso-vagal episode.  As a man, though, he understood Sherlock's request for privacy.  He was standing on the pavement when his phone buzzed.
John grabbed his bag from his office and nearly ran out the back door, slowing himself to a fast walk when he got to the pavement, lest he bowl someone over.  He looked frantically up and down the street, wondering if the bus was coming, or had just been, then gave into impulse and hailed a cab.
"You're planning on telling Sarah at lunch that you're expecting a baby in a few weeks.  She's going to be shocked, and you're preparing yourself to handle that shock, and to tell a lie which, as we've covered, you are adequate at but not adept.  I stand by my assessment though.  She will be so excited that any issues with your duplicity will be covered by her own rush of adrenaline." Sherlock stood up, the egg a smooth green mass on his stomach.  John still wasn't quite over the fact that Sherlock was, no matter what he said, the baby's mother, and he looked the part now.
"Greg Lestrade, Sherlock, Inspector Lestrade.  Remember, one of the three people you went into hiding to protect?"  John would have thought that Sherlock's inability to remember that simple fact was a put on except for the fact that he was so consistent.
John looked up quickly, wondering how Sherlock could have deduced that Pret was exactly where he would have defaulted for lunch with Sarah, and realized that Sarah and Anthea were having a pleasant conversation.  He listened for a moment, realized it had something to do with cosmetics or moisturizer or something incomprehensible, and turned back to his phone without guilt.
"Thank you."  Sherlock kissed John's temple, then leaned against him, content to be still for the moment.
John looked up and grinned, feeling the stretch of the dry skin on his lips when he did, imagined that his mouth looked much like Sherlock’s, now.
"Well, I tend to agree with you," John said, sitting in the chair opposite.  Now that he was in the same room as Sherlock the tale spun by Mycroft seemed bizarre, a remote possibility.  But Sherlock had corroborated it.  He glanced down at his phone, daring to sneak a look.  Sherlock's texts were still there, and then, in a moment, joined by another.
"Sherlock has made no secret to you that he has, in the past, been addicted to cocaine.  When he was twenty-one he was also experimenting with heroin.  He was removed from his disreputable dwelling and brought to our family's home.  He underwent detoxification and his cycle in the same week.  Due to the ravages of the withdrawal from drugs it is not clear if he experienced a strong urge to have his egg fertilized, and it's just as well.  He did feel that urge, to a certain extent, when he was fourteen, and despite fully understanding the fact that the egg itself was not, in fact, genetically speaking, a true egg, it was still agonizing."  Mycroft brought his steepled fingers to his face, a posture John had only ever seen in Sherlock.  "I wonder, sometimes, if the drug habit he developed later in his teens wasn't in response to trying to self-medicate that pain away.  Regardless, he has never returned to drugs, and as long as he has his work, I believe he never will."
John wasn’t paying close attention to their route, but he was reminded of the day that Mycroft had spoken to him in a car very similar to this one.  When the car finally turned in at a familiar marker, John realized that they had passed this way on that journey.
Sherlock shrugged, tilting his head up as he sipped at his cup.  The overall effect was that he looked like a reclining bird of some sort, perhaps an ibis, and John choked back a laugh at how appropriate that was.
"I know he wants you to come home, but there is more to discuss, John.  I am sure that you're aware of the powerful role hormones play in human emotion.  Despite his demeanor to the contrary, Sherlock is no exception, especially with the surge of hormones that will be starting any moment now.  The effect will be similar to a drug, overpowering, and it will prompt him to say things and act in ways that previously you would have thought inconceivable for him to do.  As you are a good man, I know that you would not take advantage of him in any such state, but you need to know this:  Sherlock will have an intense desire to have his egg fertilized, and he will ask you.  The important thing for you to know is that he had made this decision long before the hormones will have started entering his system."
"For a given value of large, yes.  That would be why my shirts aren't fitting lately."  He sighed.  "You haven't noticed, I'm fairly bursting out of them."
“We’re going to let Sarah and the others believe this baby is coming from a surrogate,” John pointed out.
John felt an uncomfortable flip in his stomach at that, the reminder of the other magic tricks he'd claimed to have performed, the ones he had, in fact, gotten away with.
“I wasn’t going to do anything,” John protested.  The few seconds he’d spent with Sherlock’s mother she’d seemed an intelligent woman.  It seemed beyond the pale that she wouldn’t have questioned Mycroft at some point.
“We will call for you if we aren’t sure,” Sherlock said, reaching out to touch his phone where he’d left it on the bedside table.
John leaned back and reached down with his free hand, fingers skimming along his skin, pushing in just slightly, and gasped before his fingers had even come close to their target.
John looked away as he put the bottles back in the drawer, wondering if he'd ever heard Sherlock voice something so altruistic.  His hand trembled for a moment when he realized that the only other time that he knew of had been when Sherlock had hidden himself away for a year, not letting John know that he was alive, simply to keep John from peril.  It had hurt the both of them terribly, but whereas John had at least attempted to mourn and then recover, Sherlock had felt the guilt of deception and the unfulfilled desire to tell every day.
“We know,” Sherlock said.  “And if she is sleeping in the bed with us we need to reduce our pillows and blankets as well.”
“So would Mycroft, though,”  John said, thinking of all the times Mycroft had anticipated their needs, surveillance or not.  “So would your father.”  The fortified entry way was a testament to his unwillingness to let a need go unaddressed.  He set his hand on the worktop, steadying himself.  The Holmes family, as it turned out, was by far the most supportive one he had ever been a part of, and somehow that fact seemed to have snuck up on him.
John nodded, his attention entirely on the egg.  He barely looked up when Sherlock let Annborg in, but shifted the egg so she had easier access.  He’d expected some kind of instrument, but she merely ran her hands over the shell, then rested her fingertips on either side of what he’d come to think of as the equator.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the living room, his phone in his hand, the egg in a sturdy nest of blankets and throws on the floor.
“Perhaps.”  John mentally crossed his fingers for the millionth time that the baby would look like Sherlock.
Later that week John returned from another shift at the surgery to find Sherlock on the sofa, feet dangling over the arm, the egg in the shallow dish of his abdomen.  He’d consistently failed to put on any weight despite his unusual inactivity-- it was the higher temperature, combined with the fact that if he was engrossed in what he was reading he would forget to eat.  John had to remind him, when he was home, but as the days had ticked down from 90 he’d become more and more aware of the fact that he’d want to work less when the egg hatched, possibly less around the time that it was due to hatch, as well.  Sherlock’s work brought in money, but inconsistently, and even though Sherlock continued to earn through his consulting John felt the approaching due date of the egg keenly.  He was about to be a father, and fathers provided for their children, full stop, even if certain consulting detectives told them that they needn’t worry.
Something about the exchange must have felt off to Sherlock, because the next thing John knew he was standing at the edge of the sofa. "I've upset you."  He was looking down at John, perturbed at his own lack of understanding.
“It was somewhat cowardly of me to leave that up to him,” Sherlock said as they approached the main tower.  “I could have told you, or tried to tell you.”
“He texted me while you were changing.  He knew I’d been out all night, saw the footage of me slipping and falling into the Thames.”
"It's not obvious, because it sounds as though it should be the stuff of rank fantasy, or science fiction.  But it is very real.  Still, at the moment, you have nothing but my word."
"I'm sorry, Sherlock, I'm so sorry, it's just that anything you say right now, you're under the influence," John knew he was babbling, stopped only when Sherlock let go of him.
“I can see how that could be shocking.”  Sherlock pressed his thigh against John’s as John watched Egzanthe take her first meal.  Sherlock held the bottle expertly, balancing it in his hand as the infant sucked vigorously but not pressing it into her face.
John fixed tea for the both of them with a setting for Annborg as well, and they sat in companionable silence as they drank.
John nodded and closed his eyes, relieved.  For Sherlock to say that it was distasteful, that was harsh enough.  That he knew it was not desirable was more than John had hoped for.
"As observant as I am, I can only guess at what you're thinking right now."  Sherlock's voice sounded like it was far away-- a bad sign.  John pushed his hand down hard on the edge of the drawer, under the pretense of needing to support himself as he stood up.  It steadied him for a moment, anyway.
"Not dangerous experiments," Sherlock qualified.  "Just simple observations, the best positions for holding, whether she prefers being walked about the house compared to gently bouncing in place, things of that nature."  He made a minute adjustment to the egg, pulling the edge of John's jumper closer around it.  "I have spent a significant amount of time in the company of babies, for a single man, anyway."
"Sherlock's fine."  It wasn't a lie.  If he was able to text about self-care then he was fine, for a given value of fine.
"Which part?  Detoxing?  Or..." He wasn't sure of the proper verb to describe what Sherlock was referring to.
"He wanted Irn Bru when he was fourteen.  That was his first cycle, and like most cycles at that age it produced an egg that in a bird would be called a dud.  There was no genetic material in it.  It was the equivalent of a polar body."
"Were you this olfactorily obsessed with all of your lovers?" Sherlock asked, and that sent a shock of want straight through John, the idea that they were about to be
“We’re all done in there,” she said, actually sparing them a glance.  “Mycroft wants to know if you want any food sent in.”
“What indeed,” John asked.  “Keeping the other party comfortable is a kindness, don’t you think, at times?”
His brain felt split in three-- his cock in Sherlock’s mouth, the egg cradled between them, Sherlock’s cock in his mouth.  It kept him on the edge for what felt like ages, the pressure against his own cock mirrored in the pressure on his throat.  Once comfortably settled there Sherlock hardly moved, shifting his hips inch by inch, John’s head pressing into the pillow a counterpoint.  John felt the saliva running down his chin, warm but quickly cooling, didn’t care, really, didn’t have a free hand to wipe it away.
John shook his head. “You don't have to get up in the middle of the night to make me something to drink,” he protested.
“Come and see,” Sherlock said, tying the egg to his abdomen with practiced ease.  John felt a stab of jealousy, then relief as Sherlock started walking up the stairs.
John sighed.  "Yes, that's it.  I know it's shallow, but one expects certain half truths from ones," he paused.  "From one's lover," he finished, the word carefully chosen.  One might not expect flattery from a partner, a pragmatic mate in all of life's endeavors, but from the man who had literally talked him into bed, he had been expecting at least a little massaging of his ego, slight though it was.
“Her clothes, her hair, even her fingernails are calculated to give the impression of a moderately well-off retiree, or perhaps a woman who has never worked outside her husband’s home.  She sits on the board of a half dozen London institutions and is the driving force behind at least two NGOs that I know of.  She accomplishes this partially by allowing people to underestimate her.”
"Right, of course."  He tore his clothes off, barely aware of where they landed, hissing a bit when he dragged the cotton of his pants over the exposed head of his cock.
"Am I hurting you?"  John pulled back, leaving the tips of his fingers inside, then slipped in with his smallest finger too, pushing in beyond his knuckles, only his thumb left outside, slotted neatly against the base of Sherlock's spine.
He needn’t have worried.  Sigeursonn was even taller than Sherlock, clad in similar clothes to what his son preferred, but his face was entirely different.  In that moment John realized that Sherlock had his mother’s features, entirely, except for his hair.
“She will be a little later at holding her head up and sitting up, because she didn’t have the isotonic pressure of amniotic fluid, but otherwise her development will be indistinguishable from a gestational infant’s.”  She took her stethoscope out of the pocket of her sweatshirt, and John carefully transferred the baby to Sherlock, noting how effortlessly he seemed to take her, resting the back of her head on his forearm.
"You're going to prove that you love me, with your phone."  John stared down at it.  How appropriate.  How inevitable.
She nodded.  “He’s finding the higher temperature difficult to adjust to, especially as it comes with a faster metabolism.  He didn’t have much extra energy saved to begin with.”  She took the bottle of lemonade out of the refrigerator and handed it to John.  “That’s going down a treat with him.  Bring it up to him.  I’ll call you when dinner is ready.”
“Are you sure?” John asked, already half hard, watching with rapt attention as Sherlock returned to his own side of the bed.
John breathed deeply, ready to attack him, ready to fight and beat the information out of him, yelled as he surged forward, stopped, suddenly, by arms around his waist.
"Mummy came with us every time we visited, and Father travelled to England at least twice a year.  It worked well for them."  Sherlock's chin was digging into John's shoulder, almost painful.
The sounds next to them changed from construction to cleaning, and then Anthea’s heels against the threadbare hall carpet.
“We can see far more with x-ray, but there’s the exposure of the foetus to think of,” Ann said.  “Ultrasound works only so far on the firm shell of the egg, and MRI would take the egg away from its parents for too long.”
John pushed forward, felt the thin layer peeling away from the shell as he moved his hand, the smooth shell against his knuckles, soft dry skin under the pads of his fingers.  His breath caught in his throat as he felt the delicate bumps of the curved spine, and then the egg broke apart and fell away, leaving him cupping the child against his forearm and hand, Sherlock’s hands a cradle beneath her as they leaned in towards her.
"His family tree goes back ages, and there isn't anything obvious, beyond the usual heart disease here and there."
"Without getting into any trouble," John said, knowing that it was far too early to even be having this argument.  "Does Mycroft go there?"
John sighed, aware that it was pointless to argue, and followed Mycroft out to his car, just pulling silently up to the kerb.
“Less than five pounds, I’m sure,” Sherlock said. “She’ll catch up.  Just look at Mycroft and I. Both of us grew up to be taller than average.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I suppose that in my case you might be literal about it. There was not an over abundance, a term I used with some facetiousness when speaking of your childhood, but nor was there a lack of it. The fact that I was able to insist on solitude when I was young spoke, in my case, to the fact that I knew my parents would be there when I wanted them. Whereas your solitude was, I suspect, a product of being preferable to the alternative.”
“The head is developing nicely, and the placental sac is robust,” she said as she kept measuring.  “If we hold still you can see the pulse.”
John looked at his tense, peevish expression for a moment, then laughed out loud.  "You know what's going to happen, in a matter of weeks?"
Anborg looked mildly amused.  “Let me know how that plan works for you.”  She ran her hand over the mattress, covered with a simple sheet, ran her hand around the edges of the oval mattress, nodding when she found no gaps.  “I’m glad you have a modern bassinet.  I brought a warming pad for you, from,” she paused, thinking.  “From Sherlock’s great aunt.  Or if not, Sigersonn calls her auntie, so I’m going to assume that’s correct.”
Sherlock's fingers tightened against the back of his head.  "You think I didn't love you before the change started."
He watched as she processed that, counting back the months, surely.  "Since just after he came back?" she asked.
Sherlock stood, stiffly, cringing as he moved towards the hall.  "Don't talk to me.  In fact, it would be better if you just go out."  He was bent forward at the waist, moving slowly, but with every sign that he wished he could move more quickly.
John merely shook his head as he went up the stairs, but when he did wake, sprawled in the middle of the bed, the sun was well up.
"I want this too," Sherlock said.  "I've wanted this, too, before now.  For months.  Since before," he paused.  "Before I left."
"Did you eat something?  Take something?"  The suddenness with which it had come on made bacterial or viral illness less likely than some kind of poisoning, food or otherwise.
"I thought that was just my good influence paying off," John said.  "Wait, does that mean you're hungry now?"
“Let me just get you two settled,” Annborg said as she followed them.  John took a deep breath and allowed it, the need to be alone with only Sherlock and the egg almost overwhelming.
John pulled off the thin undershirt he had slept in and handed it to Sherlock who spread it out on the table with one hand, the egg still steadied with the other.
“Seems to be,” Zilpha said, as Annborg nodded.  “I’m sure there’s the odd child that comes in the morning, but the eggs always seem to hatch after the sun has set.”
“Why are you home?” Sherlock asked at the same time.  He slipped his phone back into his pocket.  “I put her on the floor because she’s moving so vigorously it’s shaking the egg about.  This way she can’t roll off of any surface onto the floor, as she’s already there.”
"Your point?"  His nose itched when he spoke and he wrinkled it up, twitching away from Sherlock's still pressing finger.
The egg was heartier than John had originally supposed.  While keeping it against warm, human skin was best, it could rest, covered by an insulating cover, in a warm room for a few minutes, much as a bird might cover her eggs with loose feathers and straw.  While any insulating cloth would do, Sherlock insisted on John’s oatmeal jumper.  John tried to keep all the necessities to hand when he had to leave the flat on the egg’s fourth full day of life.  Prior to that the egg had been constantly nestled against either John or Sherlock, or, often, both of them.
Sherlock picked up the pace on John’s cock, sucking harder, pulling back to let his tongue swirl firmly around the shaft before swallowing him down again.  John groaned, earning him a firmer press of Sherlock’s cock against his throat, the barest fraction of a second of feeling like he might gag, then the acceptance as his body took him in again.  Sherlock’s hand was shaking next to his, almost fluttering over the egg, over the back of John’s hand, as if he was fighting not to squeeze down.  John felt relaxed, like keeping his hand loose was easy.   He wrapped his thumb and first finger around Sherlock’s hand, and held him steady.
"I think I need to lie down, and I want your arms around me."  As the words left his mouth he laughed a little, but without mirth.  "That has got to be the first time I've ever said that."
Sherlock wasn't even looking at him as he spoke, already turning back to the kitchen and his experiment, but John turned his face to the wall anyway, hiding the hurt expression that he knew had to be settling there.
“Food,” John said.  On the table there was a loaf of dark bread with pots of butter and jam next to it.  “Who brought this over?”
“It does.”  John said the names silently to himself.  “Why Watson Holmes, instead of Holmes Watson?”
The noise that escaped his mouth was something like a laugh, a hiccough, and a sob.  Sherlock turned around, his brow creased with alarm.
“Mother’s name goes second,” Sherlock said.  “As I contributed the egg, that would make me her mother, biologically. Besides, I like the descending number of syllables in the names.”
John curled up on his side, the egg held between his abdomen and thighs.  The higher body temperature was becoming second nature, and he didn’t even really feel it as he waited for Sherlock.  Sherlock climbed into bed behind him, pulling the duvet over his shoulders but leaving John covered by only his nightshirt.
“Siguersonn isn’t much of a mystery, I have to say,” Anborg said, a slight laugh coloring her words.  “He’s quite literal.  And I’ve never known him to hurt anyone’s feelings intentionally, but he’s quite blunt.  He doesn’t have an abundance of tact.”
"Yes," Sherlock said, pressing himself back and craning his neck to kiss John.  The angle was awkward, Sherlock's teeth snagging on John's bottom lip.
"We shall disagree, then.  Now, as for the books, the neonate will be completely unable to appreciate them for some time.  Klekket barn are exceptional, but not to the point of needing books."
He looked up to see Sherlock watching him, his gaze unabashedly traveling from his head to his toes.  John swallowed hard, realizing that he was cupping his balls in his hand-- either an unconscious masking or he was offering himself, he didn't even know.
“It’s a pleasure to do something a bit different,” Anthea said.  She was breaking down a chicken, now, and the way she sliced through the joints John wondered if it really was all that different from her usual set of duties.
Sherlock kept his hand over John’s, but didn’t look at him.  “Why?  Because the egg will require so much less attention and care when it’s actually a child?”
He drew in a breath to speak, wanting to point it out to Sherlock, but he was surprised by the sob that burst out of him, his face heating as his entire chest shook with it, a shuddering breath followed by the tears hot on his cheeks.  He wiped his hand over his face but he couldn’t stop, his lower lip shaking as he tried to blink his eyes clear.
"I probably did, and deleted it.  I don't know about the solar system, remember?"  He stretched his arms over his head and leaned back, shirt coming untucked from his trousers as he did.  "I'll leave the literary allusions to my blogger."
"Do you have patients in the afternoon?"  Sherlock took one hand off John's back and laced their fingers together over the top of the egg.
"Sherlock, and Mummy before him, are part of a rare sub-class of humans who lay eggs.  The cycle is one egg every seven years.  There is no guarantee that the child of an ovipositor will be an ovipositor.  Broadly, it appears to be a Mendelian recessive trait.  Sherlock is an ovipositor, I am not.  His sudden 'illness' this morning was not unexpected.  He was due for a cycle, and his current state is analogous to the stomach upset that pregnant women who are nearly to term sometimes experience.  Broadly, it's a clearing of the system, making way for the egg."
"We'll be down presently."  Sherlock unfolded himself from behind John and came round to take the egg.  Since the beginning he'd been the custodian of the egg when going up and down the stairs and John was glad to let him do it.  John straightened his clothes and went to the washroom to splash some water on his face, smiling to himself at Zilpha's unexpected warmth, the way she referred to them collectively, already.
“Fair enough.”  John stretched his arms over his head, still tired from his own long night.  He wondered if Sherlock was beginning to feel fatigued, but the low level of worry seemed to be keeping them both alert.
"Greg who, who is Greg?"  Sherlock only repeated himself when he was either annoyed or truly perplexed or, in this case, apparently both.
I would be able to discern it in an instant.  Likewise the cleft in your chin, your philtrum, and brow ridges.  Each of your features is unique to you, but my point was that taken individually they are common enough in our population that a resemblance between you and your child could be written off as mere coincidence."
Sherlock glared at the empty glass.  "I remember the pain.  It was excruciating, and I use the term in its original sense of harkening to an actual crucifixion."
“Of course.”  John lied down on his side on  top of the covers, accepted the bundled egg against the bare skin of his abdomen, keeping the sheet over its exposed side.  He waited to see if he could feel his temperature going up, but felt nothing unusual as Sherlock searched through his dresser.
Sherlock's face was flushed, his eyes as bright as if he had a fever, the bright gray of his iris now a thin ring around his pupil.  He pushed back against each of John's thrusts, his hands moving about restlessly, trying to hold himself open, trying to let John get deeper.
"I liked seeing my father, and all my cousins.  Speaking Norwegian was an interesting challenge, and many of the cousins spoke English and another language besides, so we had plenty of opportunities to practice.  Father is also conversational in Kven, though I've never found out why."  He sounded peevish.
“Of course.” John stood as he handed it over, expecting the other man to take it and sit down, but Sigeursonn stood holding it, turning it over in his hands several times, running his hand over the shell before he held it against the front of his shirt. “Not long now,” he said, his voice warm, pleased. “I never had the chance to raise a girl myself, but I have known many of Sherlock's cousins. Anborg was an infant when I moved to Norway. It's a pleasure watching them grow and acquire new skills and sharpen their senses. Girls are subtly different from boy children. It was fascinating because Zilpha insisted that there was no difference but there clearly is.”
"Essentially, yes."  Sherlock plucked the phone from his hands and began tapping on it, finally handing it back over.  The screen was nearly blank, a small grey icon of a video camera in the center.
"Right, ok."  John kept peering at the screen, and finally the phone was lifted out of the pocket, and held up.  It was nighttime, and the images were blurry, leaving trails, but it was easy enough to see the Millenium Eye, outlined in blue, clearly visible just as the muffled voices began something that sounded like a chant.  Or a countdown.
“You're right,” John said, “and I would have been tempted to ask had I known there was a way to guess.”
John swept his crumbs into the sink, itching to go back to the egg.  “Do you need anything else in here?” he asked as Sherlock did the same.
“It was still a betrayal. I know that you feel that you would have preferred to have made the choice, even though it would have led to your death. Merely giving you the choice could have led to your death and the death of others, but that does not mean that you didn't spend a year living in the grip of what you thought was an unforgivable betrayal of trust and love.”
