Dean let his hand rest on his bump again, slowly brushing his fingers over the skin, gently tracing the shape of it in a light caress. He had no idea what would happen from now on, especially after the baby was born. He didn't want to make the same mistakes his father had made; couldn't even
The light stopped before the spell. Sam saw the brightness dim quickly, and he opened his eyes as soon as he thought he could, even though Gabriel’s chanting did not stop for even a second. Just like before, his vision took a while to adapt, and once he could see clearly again he found that the light coming from Gabriel's hand had not vanished completely, but it was a lot weaker than before, enough so that Sam could keep his eyes open as long as he wasn't looking directly at it.
There was no point in stalling for any longer, on putting it off for even another minute. He'd already waited enough.
It was still surreal how Charlie knew everything about their lives from the books, but he just shrugged that weird feeling off, like he had learned to do by now. Sort of. “He was human like her, yes, but just for a while. He ended up stealing another angel’s Grace at some point.”
It had been days since his morning sickness had bothered him, so this was a little odd, but not completely unheard of as he still had a few eventual episodes every now and then, especially depending on what he ate. What really worried him, though, was the blood that came out of his mouth alongside the vomit. The clear hint of dark red mingling with everything else inside the toilet sent a wave of cold dread through him, and he couldn’t help but stare down at it for a moment once he was done throwing up, panting over the toilet and trying to actually get his head to stop spinning.
A huff escaped Sam’s lips, and he shook his head once more, apparently having a little trouble as he let the news sink in. “You know, I guess I should not be this surprised.”
"I assume you know there are cures for both vampirism and lycanthropy—if you act fast enough, that is."
, that hand felt so warm and strong around his dick, and now it was moving, sliding up and down against his sensitive, velvety flesh and
Some of the anger and frustration that Dean had felt once he realized that Sam had followed him in here to try and talk him out of going through with Jack's plan faded as soon as he took in the sad, tired look in his brother’s eyes, when he heard the defeated tone of his voice. Sam’s shoulders were still hanging low, too, slumped under an invisible weight, and Dean really wasn’t sure if that weight had been put there simply by exhaustion, or by something else entirely.
Jody nodded, features smoothing out a little in understanding—and in relief, too, by the looks of it. “But the curse still affects Dean?”
Somewhere in the back of his mind Dean scowled at himself for letting Cas watch this, but he couldn’t find it in himself to tell the angel to leave him to deal with this on his own. It wasn’t like Cas would hear him if he tried, anyway.
The man didn't seem willing to speak again anytime soon, apparently refusing to respond to Charlie's comment, his glare growing so intense it was almost impressive at this point, so Dean decided to push him a little more.
relieved that Cas was actually talking to him now, because that was certainly progress, but another part of him kept wondering if maybe he should have just sent someone else to come give Cas the news about Michael’s body showing up instead of coming himself. For some reason, having this conversation with him right now just felt… wrong, out of place.
But he didn’t stand up from that tree trunk, even if he was very tempted to just head back over to that bar and find out just how much alcohol it would take to get a hybrid drunk. Honestly, he really didn’t feel like moving, so he just stayed there, staring up at the starry night sky and wondering what the hell he was supposed to do with his life.
And then two loud, ugly cracks echoed loudly through the air as Charlie’s and Balthazar’s heads whipped violently to the side, as if moved by an invisible force. Their bodies went limp as their necks snapped, and they both fell to the floor with two low, heavy thuds.
“And what am I supposed to do then, Charlie?” Sam asked, hearing the plea in his own voice, “I can’t just sit around all day doing nothing. I can’t do that.”
happened—Dean didn’t do any of that. He didn't snap, didn't start yelling at the top of his lungs. He didn't even
For some reason, he still refused to look back up at Dean when he finally answered, “Learning that I didn’t have to live like a monster, that I didn’t have to kill to survive, that I could actually
ago, when the matter had first come up, even if deep down, Dean had known that wasn’t actually true—not really.
Cas let out what Dean could only define as a defeated sigh. Maybe he had been planning to be cryptic about it, but something in the angel’s eyes seemed to shift at the sound of pure anger pouring into Dean’s words. Dean was panting when he was done speaking, his hands shaking by his sides as he waited for Cas to say something—courtesy of the Mark, he assumed, which seemed very happy with the little anger from the hunter it could get a hold of. It was a sickening thought, but it was the truth. It was burning now, too, though the feeling was dulled, weaker than it had ever been before.
He put the small container in the microwave and set the timer accordingly, and then sat down at the table to wait, closing his eyes as he rested his head in hands. His entire body felt heavy, his movements languid, but that was expected with the very clearly not enough amount of sleep he had been getting during the past few days, which basically consisted on the very few times his brain had pretty much just shut down on him for a few minutes.
Understanding flooded their features, but their worry only seemed to intensify at those words. Dean couldn’t say he was surprised.
So he lifted his wide eyes back to the man’s face, finding him watching Dean with a raised eyebrow, which was obviously part of the clear ‘I told you so’ look that had taken over his features at some point.
A shaky breath escaped him, and Dean swallowed drily, nodding because of course Cas was right. The baby hadn't even been born yet, was still being formed, and already he knew he would do anything for it, no matter the consequences. If this would save their child, then it would be worth it. That was all that truly mattered.
If it wasn't for the whole Apocalypse prophecy or whatever, if fate hadn't decided to fucking screw Dean and Sam over before they were even born, then Cas would have never rescued Dean from Hell, so he and Cas would have never even met, much less actually have what they had now, and their baby wouldn't even exist. Dean was only pregnant right now
Curiosity coiled inside of him at the mention of the Mark’s age, but Castiel ignored it for now. “But it can still be removed, if Lucifer did it.”
A pair of hands was suddenly lifting his head and turning it to the side, a movement that seemed to be growing rather common for them, Dean quickly noted. It was almost startling, just how easy this was for them, how natural it was for Dean to just lean into the angel's touch.
. He’d only been kissing Cas for about a minute and already the hunter couldn’t understand how he had lived without it for so long. A strong hand grasped the back of Dean’s head, pulling him forward, tugging at his short hair and tilting his head to the side, which caused Dean to let out a broken sound that resembled a mixture of a groan, a whimper and a gasp. Cas’ rough stubble rubbed against the hunter’s in the most delicious way, the burn caused by it enough to send a series of chills running down Dean’s spine.
Dean almost chuckled, but he held it back. “It’s been a few weeks since you last saw him. Actually,” Right, Sam hadn’t been conscious when Cas had healed him in Omaha. So the last time Sam had seen Cas had been after the whole fiasco with Metatron in the dungeon, “It’s been over a month.”
And then a wet, frankly disgusting sound filled the air. Max let out a startled gasp right along with it, wincing just before his knees gave out under him and he fell to the ground, landing onto the grass with a heavy thud.
Castiel couldn’t tell if the man was annoyed by Meg’s words, but he did hesitate for a moment before reaching into his jacket and pulling something out of what Castiel assumed must be an inside pocket.
But he needed to be there for Claire. Castiel had been granted temporary custody of her while her father was considered missing, and he was truly doing everything he could to help her, to somehow make this whole thing easier for her, to be there for her whenever she needed him, even if she didn’t seem to want any of that. In fact, it seemed like she didn’t even want
Because that way, they would be protecting Dean. They would be making sure that no one—not even his brother—would go out there looking for him.
There were just so many options on the shelf, though, and Dean really had no idea what he was doing there, so of course he spent minute after minute just reading over the titles and the texts in the back with no freaking idea what to do.
what he was doing to Dean right now. Was he testing Dean somehow? What exactly did it mean if he was? Dean had no idea.
an angel? They don't go to Heaven. Being banished will essentially severe an angel’s connection to both Earth and Heaven momentarily. It will literally send them to another plane of existence, cut off from everything that could ground them, making their Grace lose a great deal of energy in the process, so much that a weak or wounded angel could actually die from it. And that makes me wonder: what would happen to an angel’s unborn nephilim if something like that happens, especially when it’s a male who’s bearing it? Would it kill both parents? Kill only the child?” Jacob hummed thoughtfully, turning his head to look at them again, and the same glint from earlier was suddenly back in his eyes. “I guess there’s only one way to find out.”
“So, if you’re angel,” she started, eyes focused on Cas, “Then that means that there’s like, a Heaven, right? And a Hell, too? The whole afterlife thing?”
"I still tried to, though." Sam shrugged feebly, and it was his turn to look sheepish and apologetic. "I'm sorry. I just... I was curious. I just wanted to see if I could feel them or something, but... well, there really was nothing there, or at least nothing that I could actually
There was something else about it, though. There was just this… warmness, this weird feeling that had Dean feeling a little lightheaded, but that made him feel good nonetheless, feeling content for no reason at all, which the hunter assumed must come from the soul bond. It felt more evident when he was so close to Cas, stronger and much more intense, especially now that the angel’s life wasn’t hanging by a thread. Overall, it just felt really good.
But he didn’t miss the way Cas instantly stiffened beside him, growing as rigid as a freaking tree in his chair, wings fluffing up like they did whenever the seraph was uncomfortable.
He had been fighting it for a while. He had not drunk a single drop of alcohol since Omaha, but holding back the urge was getting harder and harder every day. And now, with his upcoming conversation with Sam about him and Cas still hovering over his head and with the whole soul bond situation, Dean realized he
Castiel did not even think, did not even consider moving from where he was. The time that would take him to get to their room, to get to Dean, it could be
Sam, fortunately, did not show up with a new case or something to occupy their minds, probably because he did not want a repeat of what had happened in Iowa, even though he didn’t even know what that had been exactly. Dean knew Sam had been bothered about his freak out, and mostly curious, but Sam hadn’t brought up the subject at all, much to Dean’s relief.
He took his jacket to his room and just as he was about to put it away in his closet he remembered the little box with the medallion was still in the inside pocket, so he took it out before hanging his jacket, and then shoved the medallion in his sock drawer, because honestly he had nowhere else to put it and he didn’t want it staring at him from the top of his dresser, so the drawer it was. It wasn’t like he was ever going to use the thing, anyway.
There were so many questions piling up in Sam’s mind right then that he could barely register them all—about the Mark, about Cas’ Grace, about the bond, about Heaven, Gabriel, Crowley, about
What he did know, though, was that he definitely hadn’t come here to just stand there doing nothing, so he finally snapped himself out of it and cleared his throat, glancing down at the bundle of flowers that he was holding in his hands.
He finished working on Cas’ bag not too long after, but once that was done, instead of lingering inside the room and simply lying down on the bed with Cas for a while as he'd previously planned to do, Dean actually found himself walking out of the bedroom with hurried, almost unsteady steps. He decided he wouldn’t be able to just sit around without doing anything right now, even if maybe that was exactly what he should be doing. The last thing he wanted to do now was to give his mind a chance to wander; to allow his thoughts to move in any of the directions he really didn’t want them to go, which was bound to happen after the moment he'd just had because of the plushie, so he knew he had to keep himself busy somehow, and there was only one way to do that now, even if he wasn't exactly thrilled about it.
And once he was alone with Cas, Dean lifted his hand to reach out again, quickly finding himself simply running his fingers through the angel’s soft, messy hair, the movement slow and careful, touch gentle and calm, tender even, as if afraid of jolting the angel somehow; of hurting Cas even more than that damn sigil already had. He realized then that there was quite a bit of dirt and blood stuck to the angel’s hair as well, caking some of the strands together, and upon further inspection Dean realized there was a pretty ugly cut just above Cas’ hairline, which he hadn't noticed up until then, as it was pretty well hidden away from sight, completely covered by the angel's hair.
“It was accidental, as far as I can tell,” Crowley finally explained, the glint in his eyes still very much present and obvious. What was he hiding here? What was so damn hilarious that Crowley looked like a freaking kid on Christmas morning? What was Sam missing here?
"I've already warned them about the hybrid, of course. Nephilims are extremely rare, as I’m sure you already know, although to make sure it lives we would need both parents,” His flitted over to Cas, who tensed up beside Sam, before the Styne’s eyes found the hunter's once more. Sam's body tensed up even more in response, because this had been exactly what he had been imagining he would be hearing, but that didn't mean it made him any less angry. “And while my family is interested in what possessing such a peculiar creature may bring us, maybe that one is more trouble than it’s worth...” He made a pause, letting his words linger in the air as he took a few steps toward the wall to the side, eyes focused on the painting hanging there for a moment, as if suddenly the conversation had lost its importance.
—working a case, doing something that was at the same time so different from his current routine, and yet so painfully familiar, was the only thing that he could think of.
When Cas didn’t immediately respond, Sam took it upon himself to try to get anything else out of the angel, because Heaven being a problem was truly a thing he hadn’t seen coming and he wasn’t sure how to process that. “Cas, I haven’t exactly been hiding from Heaven, so why hide only Dean and not me too? And I mean, we both still have the carvings in our ribs, don't we?" That should be enough to hide both him and Dean from Heaven, shouldn't it? It had been for years, so why did Dean suddenly need something else for that? "This doesn’t make sense. Hell, Hannah even knows where the Bunker is, and she’s the one in charge now, isn’t she?”
Charlie’s gaze on the side of his face, but he refused to turn his head and meet her eyes again—at least until she actually said something.
the witch sang once she was only a few feet away from Castiel, her sharp red eyes dancing over his face, as if drinking everything in—his helpless state, his fear. That conceited smile was still playing on her lips. “You killed Tom and Scott, you gave Meg the slip so many times, and everyone’s so freaking
Father Jones’ eyes were a little wider by the end of Dean’s speech, and he looked pretty freaking uncertain all of a sudden—almost nervous, really, but he still nodded in silent agreement—albeit slowly, carefully, like he wasn’t sure that he actually wanted to agree to this.
Cas shook his head, “No. I’m saying that my Grace will not allow you to become a demon, that being the reason why the Mark must end the connection before it can turn you.”
A stubborn, unconscious part of Dean’s mind wanted to opine on that one, having quickly jumped to the most obvious and yet utterly insane conclusion that could be drawn based on those words, but he would push that thought away every time it as much as crossed his mind, because that was just ridiculous. He couldn’t even consider it, of course he couldn’t. That would pretty much be the same thing as accepting that he was insane, and he wasn’t sure he was quite there just yet.
Castiel turned his head, taking in Charlie’s expression—her wide, worried eyes, the small crease between her brows, the lines of concern that were so clearly etched onto her face. They seemed to have become a permanent feature on her expression at this point.
us! You just made that decision on your own, and then you insisted that we came to this freaking town without explaining
The second thing he noticed was that breathing felt weird. His lungs burned when he pulled the air in and pushed it back out, but the sensation wasn’t unbearable, just uncomfortable, like all his airways were… sore somehow, as weird as that sounded. His mouth felt oddly dry, too, and his head felt heavy even lying down, even if it was currently resting on what he assumed to be a very fluffy pillow, like there was something pressing down against his forehead, preventing him from lifting his head in any way. He also felt dizzy for some reason, which was definitely a bit freaky, because again, he was clearly lying down, and with his eyes closed, too. And yet, he still felt like the room around him was spinning, like the entire world was swirling around him, spiraling out of control. And he must have a fever, too, because he felt a little too warm, even if he couldn’t feel a comforter or a sheet draped over his body when he shifted a bit to check.
Suddenly those words made sense, but the realization made a chill go down Dean’s spine. The hatred in those words was palpable, left a sour taste in his mouth and made his insides freeze. The meaning behind all that was clear now. The Mark hated the bond, and it wanted it to break, wanted it gone.
“Good for you, Sammy,” he breathed out, that big, proud smile still playing on his lips. “Seriously, I’m really happy for you. I mean it.”
“Fergus,” she let out, and Dean turned his head around, frowning, only to find that yep, Crowley was standing right behind him.
Gabriel didn’t bother to asnwer her, instead looking away from her and moving forward to tug Dean’s arm away from where it was still wrapped protectively around his stomach so he could rest his palm over the human’s belly.
Claire, Chuck and Hannah watched from a distance, though, apparently choosing not to join in. The look in Claire’s eyes was pretty difficult to read. She looked almost... wary, which definitely wasn’t good, but she was probably still processing. If Gabriel had come around, then she probably would, too—she just needed a little more time. She was also still holding Dean’s gun in her hand, but her arm was hanging lax by her side, weapon completely forgotten.
in fact—regardless of what exactly had caused Cas to freak out like that, there was one thing Dean could be absolutely sure of.
“Yeah, I know that story.” Dean remembered Cas telling him about it when the angel had first explained to him what the soul bond was, and why it was forbidden by Heaven.
Somehow he knew that whatever was going on with him had something to do with the cottage he had seen in his head back in that motel room in Colorado, which he assumed he had just seen the interior of. He had no idea where those images were coming from, or why the hell he was seeing them whenever the Mark was acting up, but he knew he had to figure it out. And if he figured out where that place was, maybe he would find some of the answers he had been craving so strongly for so long.
However, there was nothing they could do about that now, especially with the baby. They couldn't do anything risky, not without hurting the nephilim—or
inside of him had only grown stronger by then, unbearably so—the urge to try and make Cas feel better, to try and distract him from all that pain. Cas had done that for Dean so many times over the past three months, the hunter felt like trying to do the same thing for him was the least he could do here.
“Is Jessica home?” John asked, still refusing to look up at his son. His voice still sounded far too weak and hoarse, worryingly so.
“Did you actually want something, or…?” he pressed when the silence stretched on for a bit too long, chancing another glance over at Sam.
, she really thought of everything—even turned off the security cameras in the hospital's staff parking lot. My family had absolutely no idea what'd happened to me—no one did. To them, it was like I'd just...
The thought that he might have already screwed everything up just as he’d been afraid he would during the past few weeks crossed his mind, but Dean pushed it away quickly. Fuck, he was already growing paranoid.
“As for the numbness I assume you’re feeling right now, since you would most likely heal too quickly from a head wound, we had to keep you sedated for a few hours.”
It worked a little bit, but only barely, and Dean could still feel his hand shake as he continue to prepare the food. He helped Cas finish chopping the vegetables that would go into the omelets and felt his hand trembling nonstop as he did it, which was made more obvious when the damn metal blade hit the hard surface below it.
Gabriel didn’t seem at all startled by the flames that suddenly erupted from the feather he was still holding in his hand, nor did he seem confused by the fact that the fire was of a clear, strong shade of blue. He actually had no reaction to it at all, not even a flinch or a frown, while everyone else in the room jumped a little as the fire suddenly sparked to life out of thin air, as obviously they were all pretty startled by it. Judging by the archangel's lack of a reaction, though, Dean assumed this was supposed to happen. Gabriel didn’t even pause his chanting, instead letting the volume of his voice rise even more as the flames seemed to grow stronger, bigger, their color becoming even brighter with every word that jumped from the archangel’s lips.
“Why the hell do you care?” he snapped, “I still don’t get why you saved me in the first place. You should have just killed me right then and there when you finished off Tom.”
Sam taking on the Mark of Cain—would be just a repeat of that. And if they couldn’t find a cure fast enough, if they couldn’t save him, then Dean would have to watch Sam become a Knight—a
The seraph continued to massage Dean's back for a few more minutes, and the hunter felt his body slowly melt under Cas' ministrations, muscles loosening up gradually as the angel's hands seemed to carefully remove every single ounce of tension they found in their way. That felt so good that at some point, Dean actually forgot why they'd even started doing this in the first place, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that he was a bit startled when Cas eventually broke the silence.
And then she started moving, striding toward Dean in a quick pace, her grip on her weapon still clearly tight. The look in her eyes was filled with something the hunter could only describe as hatred, and Dean could easily tell just by looking at her right then that all she wanted to do in that moment was bury her blade right into his heart the same way he'd done to her friend.
He’d known that the odds had definitely not been on their side since the very beginning, and that if whoever had taken all those people had really tried to turn all of them, that most of them wouldn’t survive the change. He’d been aware of that possibility since the moment the first raw, burnt up body had showed up days ago.
Cas gave him a small, reassuring smile, nodding lightly, before he turned around, clearly ready to walk out of the room and leave Dean alone.
He groaned once he finally hit the ground, tasting his own blood in his mouth. The world was upside down and he was feeling pain in several parts of his body, but he still blinked his eyes open and tried to regain his bearings, pressing his hands to the muddy ground and lifting the upper half of his body, ignoring the sharp burst of pain that came from his back where there was clearly a piece of wood buried into his flesh. He kept his muscles tense, body ready for whatever was coming next, for the wendigo to pounce on him and try to make Dean his dinner again at any second.
And maybe it was his own fault that those trips were usually endless, too, because he did have the habit of waiting until he was pretty much running out of everything so he would just need to make one trip to the store every month, but the alternative was going every week for less things and that just didn’t seem worth the effort.
“He’s not here, actually,” Sam handed her a mug filled with tea, which he had just made, and sat down with his own beverage across from her at the kitchen table.
Castiel finished pulling a pair of jeans over his legs before answering. The pants were comfortable, loose around his legs and not terribly constricting against his hipbones, and right now, he decided he’d rather wear them instead of his usual black slacks. He’d been wearing his dress pants all day, and he’d been growing more comfortable with the notion of wearing something
The hex bag that Castiel was carrying served the purpose of creating an illusion, fooling two specific senses—vision and hearing. Charlie had ventured into Dean’s room earlier and found a hairbrush, from which they’d extracted a few hairs that Rowena had used to cook up a spell that would make whoever was carrying that hex bag both look
Still, once he was somewhat content with his state, with his bump covered by several different layers of clothing, with his amulet safely tucked away inside his shirt and Cas' blade hidden in the inside pocket of his jacket, and after yet again reminding himself that it really would be better if he didn’t wait to be found by some wandering angel, Dean finally managed to make himself step out of the bedroom, trying to look confident as he strode down the hallway and toward the living room, and out of the corner of his eye he could see Juliet following him silently.
“Well,” Dean shrugged a little, because honestly, that wasn’t too much of a problem at this point, “Then we track your Grace first. Even if the Stynes are still following us… we’ll figure it out, okay?” He felt Cas relax a little against him, and then a nod against his shoulder. “Why didn’t you just say it, though?”
Dean snorted, but supposed he had a point, so he gave Crowley a quick nod before he darted out the door. There was small adjacent room on the other side of that door, cramped and with one single flickering light bulb hanging from the ceiling, some old boxes piled up close to the bare stone walls. And just like he’d guessed earlier, there were two headless bodies lying on the floor—a man and a woman, both of which he didn’t recognize—but Dean paid them no more than a quick glance before he made a beeline for the metal hook on the wall, from which he could see about a dozen keys hanging, held together by a single, rusty metal ring.
But he had to swallow down all his reservations and force his feet to move only a moment later, because suddenly Cas was walking inside the room, moving way too fast and without any sort of prior warning, and Dean had no other choice but to follow him.
“If Heaven finds us, either Dean or me, we’re dead. There will be no chance of speaking. They won’t care that Dean is healthy or that our case is different than anything else that might have happened until now. The baby is a nephilim, and to Heaven that is all that truly matters.”
The pair seemed very startled to see him wandering around, pausing their work to look at up at Dean as soon as he walked into the room, twin confused and surprised looks flooding their features as they both watched him slowly make his way over to where they were sitting.
He was just about done with everything, calmly sipping from his big mug of fresh, hot coffee as he carefully placed all the food on the kitchen table, when Sam came walking into the room. He'd probably been lured downstairs by the smell of the food, Dean guessed.
And then Castiel heard a cry—a canine exclamation of pain, to be more precise, also loud enough to be heard from outside of the house, and instantly he knew that something had happened to Juliet.
The touch of an angel’s Grace and a human soul should not be enough to form a soul bond, just as the touch of two angel Graces was not enough to form a mated pair. But his Grace had grasped Dean’s soul so tightly, wrapped itself around it with such eagerness, that it had happened. And Dean’s soul had
them off might actually be the right term—and toss them both across the room, as well as kick off those uncomfortable fucking polished black shoes, before he'd collapsed onto his bed and just passed out right there, still half-dressed and lying on top of the covers.
sound exactly like Dean, so that Castiel could pose as him while he visited the hospital and talked to any of the staff.
Even Cas seemed amused, and this time his smile came out a bit bigger, which was certainly a sight for sore eyes at this point. He continued to pet her then, earning himself a constant string of happy, pleased purring from the hound.
Their shower was very uneventful compared to what they had just done, but then again, all of Dean’s stamina was completely gone and all he wanted to do was sleep, so he did nothing more than just close his eyes and sigh happily as Cas’ hands carefully rubbed over his skin under the warm water spray, washing away everything that clung to his body while at the same time massaging and caressing him, tending to him so carefully Dean’s muscles quickly turned into goo under the attention of those expert hands. He did his best to do the same for Cas, but he was almost falling asleep on his feet and the angel kept tugging his hands away whenever he tried because apparently he had no coordination when he was half-asleep, so at some point he kind of just gave up.
Castiel’s death after the whole Purgatory fiasco had really sent Dean spiraling, nose-diving into day after day of dark thoughts and something he was pretty sure might be considered a depression. Maybe he shouldn’t have felt that way, not after what Cas had done, but apparently that didn’t matter. He felt like a chunk of his chest had been ripped out, and he couldn’t stop wondering if maybe things would have gone differently if he had done something, if he just had
Dean shrugged weakly, suddenly feeling silly again as he twisted one of the sticks in his hand. “I don’t know why, I just thought I’d do it. It’s not like I didn’t already know or doubted it, I just…”
John nodded again. “I know that. And I’m not… asking you—any of you,” He glanced around the table once, before fixing his eyes back on Dean, “To just… forgive everything I did. I hate myself for what I did to you, to all of you, and I... I wish I could take it back, I really do. But I can't. I can't... fix the past, I can't change what I did, but I can... I can try to... to be better now. I've changed." He swallowed again, eyes pleading, voice breaking a little when he added, "I’m just asking you to give me a
So naturally, during the next couple of minutes, Dean spent some quality time trying to expel a lung through his freaking mouth while Sam just kind of hovered there awkwardly, standing a few steps away from Dean’s bed, looking like he just had no idea what the hell to do with himself.
him in any way. Dean had a feeling that if he just shared the short version of the story, or even if he just told the guy that he didn't want to talk about this, Cas would simply drop the matter in a heartbeat.
Dean’s frown deepened. What the hell was he talking about? “Why not? Tomorrow's Sunday. You don't have to work.”
“Dean, what exactly are you feeling?” Crowley’s voice came from beside him again, and Dean realized then that the demon might not know what was happening to him, or maybe he just wanted to confirm it.
"In the illusion you said you faked your own death and went into hiding after taking on Lucifer. Is that not at all accurate?" There was a clear edge to Cas' voice, a sharpness to his words that had Dean growing quiet instead of saying something himself.
“He’s fine, Lisa,” he replied, keeping his voice low enough so that Ben should not be able to hear it from the living room, “He wasn’t really crying anymore when I got there, but he was still pretty upset. He still is, actually, but he’s okay. One of the other kids in his class was being a f—” Dean halted, cutting himself off before the words 'fucking brat' could actually get out of his mouth. That wasn't exactly what had happened, he reminded himself harshly. Still, even if now he knew that Mark kid was probably just lashing out because of whatever problems he was having with his own family, Dean didn't exactly feel any less annoyed with the situation or less protective of Ben, because that didn't change the fact that Ben had no fault in any of it and that the boy was still greatly upset about the whole thing.
“Okay, so what did I tell you about the animals?” Dean asked from the spot where he was currently crouched right in front of Ben so that their height difference wasn't so big, eyeing the boy expectantly. Lisa and Matt were standing several steps away from them, all the way back on the front porch and just out of earshot, simply lingering quietly by the front of the house, even though they had already finished loading up the car and had been ready to go for a while now.
The hunter shifted his weight on his feet and clenched his jaw, suddenly feeling extremely uncomfortable under the angel’s gaze, but he held Tamiel’s stare without looking away.
At first Dean wasn’t going to answer it, deciding to just pretend he wasn’t home so that the person standing out there in the hall would take the hint and go away, because then he wouldn’t have to deal with it. He didn’t want visitors right now, not when his apartment was a complete mess and he looked even worse. He just wasn't functioning very well at the moment. Now, he
Dean whined a little and held onto him tighter, but that wasn’t enough to make Cas stop, much to Dean’s annoyance. “Dean,” the angel whispered as he swiftly slid out of the hunter’s hold, getting up to stand beside the bed, “Come on. I’m not lying back down like this.” There was clearly an amused smile in his voice and Dean almost rolled his eyes.
“I kinda pissed him off too, back in Montana,” Dean commented in an attempt to soothe their minds. He remembered how surprised he’d been when Gabriel had lost his patience with him, as well as how he’d been afraid the archangel would no longer help them because of it, so he was quick to try and mend the situation a bit, to assure them that wasn’t the case here. “And I mean, can you really blame the guy? He’s been going through a lot lately, all because of us.”
His eyes moved quickly, taking in the several cuts covering a worryingly big portion of the seraph’s skin, and there wasn’t even that much skin visible right now to begin with. In addition to that, Dean could also see several patches of what looked like dirt clinging to Cas' body and clothes, and in result both the blood and the dirt stained a considerably high number of parts of the angel’s body in very sickly looking mixtures of red and brown—on his cheeks, neck, hands, and probably on various other places that were currently hidden from sight under his clothes, though there were also several clear rips to the fabric of those, many of which were also stained in both blood and mud. Dean swallowed drily at the sight, but he chose not to comment on any of it right now, filing away the thought to check Cas over once they were alone to see if there was anything else that he should be worried about; more wounds that needed tending to, but he could deal with that later.
Bobby swallowed drily at those last three words, but couldn’t find his voice to say anything in response.
"There is no harm in them for humans," Cas shook his head lightly. "A human child's soul does not need contact with their parents' souls to develop, so it can continue to form after the birth. A human soul is contantly growing during the first years of life. It actually does not stop until adulthood, when it finally hits full maturity."
that was clearly emanating from the angel right then, told Sam everything he needed to know about how much of a big deal this actually was, and it only made the human even more worried.
It shouldn’t have seen such a surprise, just as it should not have hurt so much, when he got no response.
explained it, then. “But you? Well…” She pulled the syringe away from Dean’s neck, adjusting it in her grip, curling her hand more carefully around it. “I’ve got high hopes for you.”
, he would dare say. "Well, I'm really happy about that, too. Although... well, I don't think that's all, Cas. I mean, you... you've always been different, from the very start, even before that whole mess with the Apocalypse. And you know, I think that's... that's why I fell for you." He honestly hadn't planned to say that, to make such an open confession, but when the hunter realized it, the words were already out of his mouth and he couldn't take them back.
“It’s hard, I know. You’re afraid people will hate you for it, or treat you differently, so you hide it away. I went through that. And it took me years to actually get comfortable enough to be open with it. But I am open about it now, and trust me, it’s a lot better this way, to be… okay with who you are.”
At that thought, Dean pulled in a deep breath to try and steady himself, to prepare for what was about to come, before he finally managed to make his feet to move again, stalking toward the motel in a surprisingly quick, confident pace.
“Cas, it’s okay. We’re fine,” he whispered, going back to softly rubbing the angel’s arm, trying to once more calm him down, even though the hunter knew that alone wouldn’t be quite enough to manage that right now. “It doesn’t matter now. We’re both okay and you’re here. You're awake, and we're all fine now. That's what matters, okay?”
For hours, he tossed and turned on the hard cushions, struggling and failing to find a comfortable position to fall asleep in. His mind was still racing, so that didn’t help, constantly reminding him that Cas was still knocked out and sick, no matter how many times he told himself that he wouldn’t be able to take care of the angel if he was suffering from sleep deprivation himself. Still, he went to check on Cas two more times before he finally succeeded in settling into a restless sleep.
“Castiel, you’ll have to deal with the full moon either way. If you don’t take this deal, then we’ll just knock you out again, dump you several miles away from here so you won’t know how to find us again, and then you’ll be left to deal with shifting on your own—which, if I had to take a guess, will definitely be a lot more difficult for you, since you'll have to do it
The scene faded quickly, and suddenly Dean’s vision was filled with light—weird bursts of it, all of them blindingly bright, blue and white dancing right before his eyes, shapeless forms that he couldn’t quite make out, that he couldn’t understand. He could also hear something—a thumping sound, quick and frantic, just a steady
Dean cursed inside his head at the sight, shaking his head and letting out a breath. He didn’t give the guy an answer right away, though, still choosing to stick with the slow approach. “What do you know?” he inquired instead, voice as gentle as he could make it.
Dean shivered when the cold air of the room hit his wet, naked skin, letting out a tiny, uncomfortable hiss, but Cas still didn’t join him on the bed.
The demon glared at Gabriel, but there was a shift in his eyes, the understanding of what clearly would be a lost battle. He had no fight in this, not against an archangel, so all he did was send one glance over to where Sam was, his eyes flitting over Dean and Cas for just a second before he turned to look back at Gabriel, who had not yet moved.
“Okay, I’ll be waiting for you, then.” Sam was about to end the conversation right there, but a thought suddenly struck him. He paused yet again, frowning as he asked, “Hey, how did you even find Dean, anyway?” It wasn’t like Hannah could have been just passing through the exact same town in Colorado where Dean had been, as well as through the same motel Dean had been staying at, and had just happened to stumble into his room to find him there.
Without a thought, even if he still felt a little disoriented and his breathing hadn’t yet returned to normal, Castiel crossed the room quickly and jumped on Tom’s back, wrapping his arms around the other man’s neck, hoping to pull him away from Ava. But Tom was way too strong, and he freed himself from Castiel’s arms far too easily, spinning around quickly and punching the other man’s chest with impressive force, knocking all the air right out of Castiel’s lungs and making him fall to the floor, gasping and wheezing just like before. The pain that bloomed in his sternum was insistent, almost unbearable, and he wondered if Tom had fractured it somehow.
And Castiel couldn’t say he didn’t get that, too. His whole family seemed to be having a hard time looking at him now. Castiel and Jimmy were the very definition of
about what’d happened with Cas. He’d quickly figured out that talking to Charlie seemed to put him at ease, and he had a feeling she would be pretty understanding about the whole thing—and maybe she’d have some insights to give him, too. Honestly, he could really use an outside opinion here.
“You…” Sam swallowed, then licked his dry lips, for some reason suddenly feeling his mouth dry. It was harder to get the words out than he had thought it would be, harder to even find the right thing to say, the right way to phrase what he was thinking. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you for a while, about…” He swallowed again, “About you and Dean.”
Cain had been the one to break Tolliver out of his cell. Dean had recognized the Knight the moment he’d seen the footage from the security cameras, feeling the Mark flaring up in his arm as soon as the realization had struck him. Meanwhile, Cas had found Tolliver’s final destination: an empty field where dozens upon dozens of people from all ages were buried, all murdered by the hands of the Knight himself, including Tolliver.
As soon as Dean walked into the small room, though, the older man’s eyes moved away from whatever those papers were, and quickly the hand that wasn’t holding the pen reached for the landline phone, lifting it in a silent offer.
it any longer. If he did, if he allowed himself to walk out of this place like this, starving and on the brink of another breakdown, he knew he wouldn’t last long. It certainly wouldn’t take long for him to lose control again, and this time, he knew he would end up hurting someone. He could already feel his self-control slowly crumbling to dust, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he did something else he would regret. Castiel’s words about going rabid with bloodlust, about completely losing control if he didn’t feed regularly, echoed inside Dean’s head almost constantly at this point.
There was something about the phrasing of that that bothered Dean, and he wasn’t sure what it was about it. Cas hadn't outright said that Gabriel couldn’t read the Book, he'd only said that the archangel wouldn’t be helpful. The way the angel had seemed to choose his words so carefully, and then had simply dismissed the subject after that, had Dean feeling a little intrigued. There was something Cas wasn't telling him, Dean was certain of it.
He should turn himself in. He hadn’t even thought about what he was doing when he’d run away from that alley, but now he realized that maybe he should have stayed there. Maybe he should have even called the police, really. He shouldn’t run from this—he
Dean shook his head. "It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to look so guilty about it." He smiled at his brother in a way that he hoped turned out soothing, trying to put Sam's mind at ease, and he was glad when his brother's shoulders seemed to relax a little, slumping a bit at Sam's sides. "And no, that doesn't change anything. It doesn't matter if I'm awake or not. I mean, they can bump into stuff and all, but Cas said they'll go through anything that's alive, so... you still can't touch them, or
Letting out a heavy breath of air at those words, Dean began to pace, running his fingers through his hair as he tried and failed to process that. Because he couldn’t. He just couldn’t.
“Cas…” was all Dean managed to let out, and that single word came out low and weak, nothing more than a feeble, shaky whisper.
But above all, they were still grieving, still mourning the loss of so many loved ones, and Castiel knew for a fact that that kind of pain didn’t go away with time. The pain of losing Jimmy was still very much real, just as unbearable as it’d been almost three years ago, and he knew for a fact that that wouldn’t change anytime soon.
And because of that the air around them was still a little heavy, which really wasn't a surprise. They still had to talk about this, Dean was very much aware of that, but he also knew that he sure as hell wouldn’t be the first one to address the elephant in the room.
Well, that… that wasn’t what Dean had expected to hear. Not at all, really. “So you’ve been following them?” he inquired.
Once he felt calmer, Castiel finally found it in himself to ask, “Why are you doing this, Gabriel?” He didn’t mean to be rude, not at all wishing to trigger a similar reaction from Gabriel to the one the archangel had had back at the cabin. He was just actually, honestly curious, had been since the archangel had first shown himself in their cabin back in Absarokee. He was still not sure what to make of Gabriel’s presence, but he was starting to think maybe they had misjudged him. Maybe he really did deserve a chance to redeem himself, whatever his reasons for it were.
As it turned out, the place actually existed. It was a small bed and breakfast somewhere in Montana, just a few miles out of Absarokee, a small town by the foot of the Beartooth Mountains. Closing his laptop, Dean let out a sigh. It wasn’t that long of a drive, probably like eight hours or something. He could make it in less, he was sure.
Yeah, well, that normally happened when he had those nightmares. It did seem a little more frantic than normal today, true, but it would slow down eventually. It always did, anyway. “It’s nothing, Cas, just…” He shrugged lightly, the movement coming out feeble and without any confidence, “Woke up too quickly.” He knew it was a weak and poor excuse, but it was all he bring himself to say; all he could come up with right then.
. His hands gripped at the sheets around him and then let go again, like his muscles weren’t quite sure what they should be doing, couldn’t figure out what to do to respond to the pleasure suddenly washing over all his nerve endings.
just downed about four fingers from his ever-present bottle of Jack, so that was probably what gave him the courage he needed to actually do it. But still, he was pretty freaking surprised with himself when he realized that he was actually
She was curled up on the floor, her back pressed against the wall in one of the corners of the small, dirty room, the farthest away she could be from the door. It almost seemed like she was trying to make herself seem smaller, with the way her body was almost bent in on itself, like she believed she could hide herself that way, like she could somehow disappear from sight.
“I know. I know. I…” Castiel looked down, licking his dry lips. He shook his head, looking back up, and he could only hope that his mother would see the truth in his words, that she could hear it in his voice when he said, “I had to leave. I had no choice.”
“Hybrids are quite resilient, my dear, as I’m sure you’ve already figured out,” Rowena explained. “A broken neck is far from enough to kill one, just as it won’t kill a vampire. But it will keep a hybrid unconscious for a couple hours. It’s quite an effective way to knock a hybrid out, really. Well, that and injecting some dead man’s blood into you, just to make you heal more slowly, and to keep you weak. That's actually why you probably feel a little weird.”
Soon enough Sam was done with his food and off to bed again, leaving Dean behind in the kitchen to finish his own sandwich and clean up—at his own insistence. He felt like a weight had been both lifted and settled onto his shoulders with that conversation, but he felt lighter nonetheless, because while Sam still didn’t know about the nephilim, Dean had just told his brother the very thing he had been dreading to open up about for his whole life.
just a vampire, or even a just a weird werewolf who likes to get freaky with their food. Or maybe it's some other creature entirely that you're not even considering here—like a messed up
“Where’s Cas?” he croaked out instead of actually addressing what he knew must be the only thing in both their heads in that moment, because he really didn’t think he could do this right now. His head was still spinning, nausea still coiling quite strongly in his gut and the weird pain in his chest still very much insistent. He wondered if the last one was coming from the bond, and he realized with dread that it probably was, even though the connection felt numb, just a weak, strained buzzing that was barely there, that Dean had almost missed. “I mean, is he… is he back yet?” He couldn’t even consider an alternative, but as he opened his eyes again to look at the pair he realized that maybe he should.
For just a second, a small spark of fear made itself known inside Castiel’s chest, but he was careful not to let any of it show on his face. Instead, he kept his face a calm, collected mask of indifference, his voice not carrying even a single hint of doubt when he replied, “If that were really the case, then you wouldn’t have said you sent them away.”
“I don’t know,” Dean replied with a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. He could feel a headache coming on, and he wondered if it’d been caused by the stress from this whole situation, by the state of Cas’ Grace, or by the distance that currently separated him and Cas. Honestly, the cause was probably the combination of all of the above. “It’s… the pain in the bond. It's getting worse, or...  it got worse for a moment, like really bad, and then it just went back to normal. I thought it was a warning or something, but… maybe it’s just because I’ve been away from Cas for most of the day now.” He didn’t sound entirely convinced of that, not even to himself, probably because he wasn’t feeling entirely confident about that assumption. But he still said it anyway, as though saying those words out loud might somehow make them true, or at least somehow make Dean believe them.
It didn’t take him long to find the staff room where all the nurses had lockers to keep their things. He was also immensely thankful that the room was empty, so he was able to just run up to the lockers and start trying out the locks, attempting to shove Tessa’s key into all the padlocks he came across until one of them snapped open.
Sam could only nod in response, the movement tense and slow. He knew it probably wasn't hard to figure out that he wasn't happy about this, considering he wasn't making any effort to hide his frustration, but Cas either didn't notice it, or he just chose to ignore it. The angel simply gave the hunter one final nod before he turned back around without another word and started walking toward the kitchen door again.
Suddenly it made sense why Cas had left his blade behind with Dean, though. Of course that he wouldn’t want to immediately seem hostile to the angels if his plan really was to just play the innocent, confused card, which meant that he definitely shouldn’t just walk out there brandishing a weapon in his hand. And since he was wearing nothing more than pants and a t-shirt, he also had nowhere to hide the blade from sight, either.
Haley’s words followed him insistently as he walked, growing louder with every step he took as he quickly made his way through half a dozen white, identical-looking hallways, echoing in an endless loop inside his head as he walked out of the hospital and drove out of the parking lot, haunting his thoughts even as he crossed the city line and guided the Impala onto the interstate.
“It is,” Castiel argued, keeping his voice as calm and gentle as he could manage. He took a step forward, but paused when Naomi tensed up, eyes shining with something far too close to fear, her skin looking a few shades paler than it had only a moment ago. She might as well be looking at a ghost—which wasn’t too far from the truth, if you really thought about it. “They found Jimmy’s body, but they never found mine. And you know that.”
“Enough,” one of the female angels to Hannah’s right said all of a sudden, the same one who had spoken earlier, stepping forward without a warning. Her eyes were hard, focused on Cas in a way that made it look like all she wanted to do right then was step on him and squash him like a bug, which didn’t seem promising at all. “There is one quick, easy way to settle this matter, Hannah, and you know it. I advise you to follow through with it.”
Cas huffed out another weak laugh, though this one was bitter, dry, clearly not amused. “I don’t want to have anything to do with Heaven anymore, Sam. I meant what I said to Hannah last night—Dean and the baby are my family, and I won’t put anything before them, ever. Not even Heaven.”
much—but if the angel seemed fine, if he wasn’t coughing or wheezing or thrashing around on the bed, then that had to mean that he could hold on by himself for just a little longer, didn’t it?
And who knew? Maybe spending some time on the road—just him and his Baby, flying over the asphalt, with her engine roaring and his music blaring from her speakers—that might actually do him some good. It definitely wouldn’t hurt to try.
Charlie breathed out, and Sam’s head turned to give her a surprised look. She looked spooked, confused, but it seemed like she had come to terms with this much quicker than Sam could even hope to. “Is that why Dean’s been throwing up so much, too?”
After eating, Dean felt so exhausted he all but collapsed on the bed, glad to have taken that shower and changed earlier. He felt drained, his muscles complaining with every movement, and he wondered if he would always feel like this. This sudden lack of energy was happening all too often, and honestly, it was starting to get a little annoying, even though Cas had assured him it was normal and there was no need to worry.
“And then came Lisa. And you actually tried to stay with that one, but just like everything in your life, that also crumbled, didn’t it, Dean?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, exactly. And that bond, it… it makes Cas more human. I mean, angels don’t eat, they don’t sleep, they don’t get tired or… even have
very easily jump out the bedroom window if they did wish to flee before the angels actually found them here, considering the cabin only had one floor, and Dean was very much aware of that option. But they didn’t know how many angels were out there, so they couldn’t just abandon Sam and Charlie to deal with them on their own. Both of them could hold their own in a fight, Dean knew that very well, but the odds would definitely not be in their favor if they were up against a whole brigade of angels, and Dean was not willing to let them sacrifice themselves for him like that.
a familiar voice answered, sounding just as sharp and serious as the hunter remembered it—Sheriff Henriksen, Dean realized.
But then again, the lack of weird, freaky stuff happening around him at home didn't exactly mean anything by itself. The ghost had apparently been haunting Dean’s apartment for weeks, maybe even months, and it was only now that Dean had actually gotten a chance to talk to the guy, so he really shouldn’t get too hopeful that the dude might be gone already just because he hadn’t seen the ghost in a handful of days. And anyway, all those freaky things didn’t use to happen very often before, and there was no reason for that to have changed now. Dean couldn’t just assume the ghost was no longer around.
A hand came to rest on Dean’s arm, wrapping around his bicep and squeezing it lightly, gently. “Dean, are you okay?” Cas whispered, and when Dean turned his head to look at him, he found two big, worried blue eyes staring right at him.
“What?” Dean’s eyebrows shot up, and he shook his head at the demon in disbelief. What the hell was Sam
A weird sound—a hollow, choked laugh—filled the air, followed by another voice. “Well, if I’m the coward, then what does that make
For a second, Dean was still confused by Cas’ reaction, still frowned confusedly at the angel, waiting for further explanation.
“We’re not doing that anymore,” she replied, shaking her head lightly. “It’s true. There are just too many results. I’ll have to try and narrow it down even more.”
“Of course I’m okay with it, Charlie,” Sam said, shaking his head lightly, letting his surprise slip into his voice freely, “I thought you already knew that.”
Only that didn’t happen, because his hand was met with nothing as it moved through the air. He felt the air colder than normal as it brushed against his skin for only a moment, the sight of his hand actually
“Why I sprouted freaking wings,” Dean completed Cas' train of thought, suddenly realizing that yeah, thinking about it that way, this did make sense, even if he really wished it didn’t, even if Dean really wanted to keep going on and on about how this was completely fucking insane and all.
Dean felt the bond stirring between them, buzzing more strongly than normal, the same way it did whenever Cas used his powers, and in the next second, the hunter's mind was suddenly flooded with images—memories that didn’t belong to him, completely foreign and unfamiliar.
Cas seemed to think about his answer for a moment, like for some reason he thought he needed to tread carefully, that he should choose his next words with extra caution, which never amounted to anything good.
Dean had swallowed drily at that, before answering with a low, “I don’t know, I… I guess so. I didn’t have much time with her. She died when I was four.”
Shaking his head as he tried to push those thoughts away, as he tried to ignore the stabbing pain in his heart they brought on, he looked back down at the Mark. “Screw you,” he let out, voice almost a low growl, forcing his feet to move even faster. Something must have happened to Cas, he told himself sharply, and that thought made Dean’s steps even more hurried, his heart beating quickly in his chest as the trip back to their room seemed to take a lot longer than it usually did. As he focused on that thought, on the fear that possibility brought onto him, he felt his head growing clearer as the Mark retracted a little. His mind latched onto the fear of something happening to Cas in favor of all the insecurities that still swirled around in his mind, but that wasn't enough to clear his head fully; it didn't make the Mark completely quiet. He hated how muddled his thoughts still felt; how the control he had on his own mind was rapidly slipping between his fingers and he had no way to change it; no way to freaking stop any of this.

So Castiel insisted, “Doctor Sunder, I’m afraid this can’t wait. Another body could show up at any moment now. There are ten people still missing, and if we want to have any chance of finding all of them alive and well, of bringing them home safely, then we need to talk to Naomi now. She’s the only reliable eyewitness we have, the only one who can answer at least
Cas laid back down properly on the bed after that, getting himself comfortable again, so Sam assumed the angel intended to go right back to sleep now that he’d eaten, and even if that may not be good idea, Sam also didn't think it would be a good thing to keep the angel awake if he wanted to go back to sleep. And so, the hunter said nothing on the matter, choosing to simply return to his seat at his small table with the intention of going back to his research, deciding to just leave Cas be, to just let the angel rest some more, because clearly he needed it.
Castiel and Sam both turned around at the same time, and in a second Sam had his gun pulled out and the angel was holding his Blade in front of his body, lifted so it was leveled with his chest, both staring at the newcomer that now stood by the checkout counter of the store, which was surprising since he had not been there a moment ago. Castiel wondered how they had not noticed him. The bell should have rung to announce his entrance if he had just now walked into the store, but just a beat later the angel noticed the open service door by the counter and remembered it had been closed when they had first entered.
Also, Dean really didn’t understand why the motel had changed places at some point while he'd been gone. He had to look for it for quite a while, which wasn’t very pleasant. By the time he got back to Omaha, he was already getting tired of driving, but he couldn’t stop until he found the motel. Fortunately, the familiar place eventually came into sight, and Dean scowled at the building for having such terrible timing when it came to playing hide-and-seek.
hear it again… well, that was enough to stun him into silence, to stomp down whatever tiny spark of confidence had managed to grow inside of him again, and for another long, silent moment, Castiel’s voice completely escaped him.
cloak all that energy to some degree. It’s not a perfect solution, but frankly, it’s all we can do right now. It’s not like you can all just go back to that fancy Bunker of yours and hole up in there until the little one is born. Sure, you’d definitely be cloaked from Heaven
“I thought I could ask him. He’d never said anything about it, and I didn’t think he would…” Another breath, this one heavier, but a little more controlled as Dean struggled to keep a grip on himself. “He’d always been so eager to talk to me when I asked him for tips on how to ask out girls, and I just asked the one wrong question I should have never asked him.”
And Dean wanted to believe those words, he really did, which he assumed must be the reason why his mind also insisted on replaying Gabriel’s comment from months ago along with Cas’ confession, when Dean had prayed to the archangel after the ghost hunt in Iowa.
Dean nodded, smiling back, because how could he not? His brother, in spite of his surprise, sounded actually
Cas paused, his hand resting on the doorknob. He turned around when Dean didn’t say anything right away, asking a gentle, “Yes?” His blue eyes had some kind of… warm, sincere curiosity shining in them that led Dean to believe he would really do whatever the hunter might ask of him right now, a thought that made that warm feeling inside his chest grow even stronger.
He would not have a choice, however, as much as he had been trying to avoid that idea for months now. If his Grace came to dangerously low levels, if the strain caused by the Mark proved to be indeed too much, he would have to go through with that plan, no matter what, because Metatron was the only one who could tell him the location of his Grace.
Charlie nodded. “Yeah, maybe. But…” She frowned a little, like she wasn’t sure how to phrase whatever was on her mind then, “Why do you think he wants to help? Why show up now? Hasn’t he been gone for like, years?”
“You boys want refills too?” the sheriff asked once she was standing, gesturing at the two bottles that remained on the table, one in front of each man.
“Whispering?” Sam frowned, taking a few steps toward the bed and sitting down on the edge, “It talks to you?”
And as the two lackeys made their leave, Castiel took a moment to assess the situation, to try to come up with a new plan of action. Killing the witch would probably solve at least one of their problems, since killing the one responsible for whatever spell was currently keeping Charlie and Balthazar immobilized should be enough to end it. Of course, Castiel wasn’t a hundred percent sure that would work, especially if that spell was being kept active by a hex bag, but he was still willing to make that bet.
Focusing his gaze on the darkened parking lot before them and not on the angel’s inquiring gaze, Dean forced the words out of his throat before he could change his mind about saying them, “I just… These last few days, I’ve wondered, well…”
He wanted to inquire about what Ben was talking about, but the pleading eyes of his son made any question he might want to voice right then die on his tongue. Ben might actually start crying if Dean even as much as let out that he had no idea what the boy was talking about, because apparently Ben had been promised something already and Dean really shouldn’t take that away from him, even if his mother hadn’t thought it relevant enough to warn Dean about it at all.
Once more his eyes found the countless cuts covering Cas’ skin, and as he looked over all the blood and mud staining both the angel’s body and his torn, dirty clothes, Dean caught himself wondering where the hell the angel had landed that would have made so much damage. Maybe he’d somehow ended up smashing into a tree, breaking it down so that pieces of wood had proceeded to tear at him before he’d fallen down to the muddy ground. It surely looked like that might have been the case, although Dean dropped that train of thought quickly enough. It didn’t matter how or why Cas had gotten like this; what truly mattered was making sure he was okay now.
Oh, wasn’t that awesome. Dean mentally cursed Bobby, although he knew he shouldn’t have expected less from the old man. The guy was almost like the father John had stopped being after things had crumbled between him and Mary, having all but taken both Dean and Sam under his wing at a very young age, even giving the older boy a job at the garage at the age of 14 and teaching him anything that John hadn’t covered about fixing cars.
So, somehow "Metatron" got changed to "Metratron" a few times in the last chapter O.o Sorry about that, I have no idea how that happened or how I didn't see it before, I actually cringed a little bit when I saw it XD It's fixed now, though :)
—and that might have some rather... undesirable effects on any non-angelic creatures that happen to be nearby."
, an actual half-angel little Winchester baby cooking up in his abdomen right now. How the hell was he supposed to tell his brother about this? How was he supposed to even fucking start?
Dean swallowed with a click, nodding, and somehow he managed to make himself croak out a weak, "Yeah. I'm fine." And before the girl had the chance to ask any more questions, the hunter opened the book again, going straight to the last page this time in an effort to avoid stumbling across any more memories that he'd rather not relive right now.
could hear the relief tinging his voice. He chose not to dwell on it, though. “Took you long enough.”
“So, you can’t just pull Cas out of the Empty because of his deal,” Sam surmised, before anyone had a chance to say anything else.
“Rogue angel,” Sam replied quickly, and Jody's eyebrows rose again, her surprise obvious in her features, but Sam didn’t let that stop him. “
And as soon as Dean walked inside his apartment, he made a beeline for the kitchen, fetching as many beer bottles as he could carry at once from the fridge and cursing himself for not having bothered to buy anything stronger recently. After the little breakdown he’d had when he received Lisa’s wedding invitation, he'd drunk his entire stock of whiskey, and then he’d vowed to himself that he wouldn't keep stuff that strong in his apartment anymore.
And the funny thing about that was—he and Sam hadn’t been interacting all that much lately, and he honestly didn’t see much of Eileen either, so most days, it already felt like Dean was all alone in this place, with how much time he spent sulking by himself, doing his best to shut himself off from the rest of the world so he could just wallow in his own grief-laden, self-loathing thoughts.
Claire shrugged the angel’s hand off with a snarl, glaring at him once again, and the seraph swallowed back whatever words had been about to jump from his lips, his eyes wide with surprise. “If you can’t fix her, then I’ll fix her myself!” the girl snapped, practically baring her teeth at the angel. Her voice was sharp and far too loud, practically echoing as it bounced off the walls of the room. “I’m taking her to a hospital!”
As soon as they’d gotten to the hospital, the sheriff had led them to the ICU, showing them a man in his mid-thirties, Thomas Wright, who had clearly been the victim of a car accident, or at least had been run over by one. They had soon found out that the second one turned out to be true, although the problem that had everyone frowning and completely confused about what had really happened was the fact that the poor guy had been
They were both quiet for a while after that. Charlie went back to working on… well, whatever it was that she’d been working on for the past three hours, finger flying over the keyboard of her laptop, furiously pressing down against the keys at a truly impressive speed.
Crowley had dropped off the map completely for now and wouldn’t answer his phone, which could only lead them to believe that he either had lied about the witch or he just couldn’t find her, so that was giving Dean no hope at all on the whole Mark dilemma, but for now he chose not to think too much about it. They could summon the demon if he vanished for too long, but again, Dean wasn’t happy about going to Crowley for help and he would feel better if they waited a little on that one. They didn’t have a solid lead on the Book right now, so really, they should focus on what seemed more promising at the moment.
So he sobbed into Cas’ shirt, let his body shake as he held onto the angel for dear life, his anchor, his rock in that moment, the only thing that gave him the slightest bit of sanity, the only light he had when there was nothing but darkness around him. He was painfully aware of something, and all it did was make him even more terrified.
The sight of the war room made the Mark burn even more angrily, reminding him of just what Dean had seen on the floor of that room in the illusion, but Dean focused on the buzzing of the bond to try and send it away. Surprisingly, it actually worked a little.
There was a bright spot of light that was different from the rest. It was surrounded by Dean's soul and Castiel's Grace, and it held such similarities to both, and yet it was so clearly different, so clearly its own entity, the beginning of a soul that had just begun to form. It was beautiful, perfect, and Castiel could not help but smile again as he felt it, felt its pure energy, strong already and yet so vulnerable as it had yet to fully develop.
Dean's eyes, however, only grew wider with his panic. Castiel could still feel his mate’s fear pouring into the bond, though it was even stronger now, practically emanating from the hunter and flooding the connection in powerful, disorienting waves, as it was in that moment that Dean seemed to truly realize just how hopeless their situation was quickly becoming. Castiel even saw the hunter's free hand twitching where it hung empty by his side, rising in the air only a couple of inches before Dean moved it back down, as though he wished to rest his palm against his hidden bump to soothe either himself or the baby (probably both, the seraph assumed). It actually seemed as if the hunter had been about to follow that unconscious instinct without even thinking, which wasn’t exactly odd, as that was something the angel had noticed the human doing quite a lot lately, and normally the sight of it would cause a warm feeling to blossom in Castiel’s chest—fondness, happiness, he wasn’t sure what to call it, all he knew was that it never failed to make him smile. However, in that moment, the seraph was glad that Dean had realized what he’d been about to do in time and had stopped himself from doing it here, because Castiel had no idea how Hannah and Afriel would react to such a clear display of protectiveness toward the nephilim.
Dipping his head down, Dean placed a gentle kiss to Cas’ lips, just because he could now, resting his forehead against the angel’s for close to a minute until he finally felt steady enough on his feet to pull away. Cas’ presence was grounding, much more than he had ever thought it could be, and he had a feeling maybe the wave of calmness that had suddenly flooded his being was coming from the bond; that Cas was the one doing it, and he felt thankful for it.
“Gabriel, I…” He closed his eyes, just then realized he was shaking, small tremors running through his muscles as his nervous system responded to what he was hearing. He took in a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself down. He had never experienced such a strong sense of panic before, and honestly, it was overwhelming. He felt like he was suffocating, like the car around them was being crushed and the metallic walls were about to close in on him, and he could not figure out how to make it stop…
"Gabriel is right," the angel replied, his voice weak, barely even a whisper. The words were dragging a bit on his tongue, which only confirmed the fact that he'd really been on the verge of falling asleep. Dean cursed himself inside his head when he noticed that. "You should be able to feel it, Dean. My Grace is part of your soul now, so you should be able to sense it too, just as I would. It will call to you."
Gabriel’s features darkened visibly, and while the look in his eyes was still pretty hard and intense, the way the man swallowed visibly and his jaw clenched a couple times gave away the way his confidence wavered with the hunter’s words.
The principal’s secretary—a small woman named Ava, who always seemed be wearing a fake-friendly smile and who very clearly hated her job—looked up from her computer at the sound of his knocking.
Only, he knew he couldn’t avoid Sam and Eileen forever. He could hole up in his own, private room for tonight, but tomorrow morning, he would have no other choice but to face those two, to be on the receiving end of their inquiring, questioning looks, to see the concern that would undoubtedly be written all across their faces as they took in his tired, rumpled state. And really, that was the
“Well, I assumed that much,” Yep, Charlie knew them pretty well, “What about this time? You didn’t start another apocalypse, did you?” She might have meant it as a joke, but there was a hint of actual doubt in her words that had Sam flinching a little, like that was an actual concern in her mind. Again, she wasn’t entirely wrong to think that.
Somehow, this chapter actually became one of my favorite ones so far, for quite a few reasons. There's just so much going on all at once, and
“I know, bud, I know.” He nodded softly, lifting a hand to run through his son’s hair, tucking a few stray strands away from where they'd fallen over the boy's eyes. “But things sometimes just… don’t work out the way we want them to, and that’s okay.”
The demon smirked, but fortunately didn’t open his damn mouth to comment on the clear change of subject.
Charlie didn’t look completely convinced, and her eyes narrowed a bit more, eyeing the bag as if she might be able to see through it somehow if she looked at it hard or long enough.
He didn’t elaborate, didn’t add anything to that single word. Instead, he just basked in the feeling of Cas’ arms wrapped around him, of the angel’s warm, naked skin pressed against his own, of their feathers tangling up together, of the seraph’s steady heartbeat hammering a beautiful song against his back, of the angel’s fingers drawing slow, soothing patterns onto the baby bump.
That last one happens a lot, actually, so that's what we usually bet on in hunts with no leads. Maybe someone knows something, but they haven't told anyone about it yet, and they just need a little push in the right direction."
Or at least that's what Dean hoped would happen, anyway. Gabriel had been ignoring Cas' prayers ever since he'd dropped them off here in Pontiac, and they still didn't know why.
Instead, he chose to focus on the pleasure currently coursing through his body, on the deliciously intense, almost overwhelming buzzing of the bond, on the stars shining just behind his eyelids as the fire in his belly grew stronger and stronger, as the flames spread out even more, filling every single crevice of his body, flowing like lava in his veins and making all of his nerve endings sing in absolute
When Dean woke up again, he wasn’t lying on the floor anymore—no, judging by the heavenly soft surface he could feel underneath him, unusually comfortable and pleasant against the oddly stiff, sore muscles in his back, he was lying on a bed—and a pretty damn good one, too, which told him he was no longer in a motel room. No cheap, shady roadside motel could ever have a bed this comfortable—he knew that for a freaking
Rowena’s eyes narrowed even more, head tilting sideways just barely, her gaze calculating and considering, like she was trying to decide whether or not Crowley was bluffing about knowing where the Book was just by looking at him long enough. There was clear interest in her gaze, even more than before, but still, what came out of her mouth next was a firm, “No.”
A hand gripped his arm and he jumped, pulling the limb back and out of the hand's hold on instinct, not even thinking as he quickly moved away from the unexpected touch as if it’d burned him. He realized a moment later how ridiculous that was and felt a stab through his heart at the broken, sad look Cas gave him in response, much like the one he’d sent Dean’s way back in Absarokee when the hunter had done almost the same thing.
to do this while Cas wasn’t aware of it; because to him, this was more than just making a friend comfortable to sleep, even though that really wasn’t the intention here. He felt like he would be taking advantage of Cas somehow, which was something he would never do, but in his head, right now, it still felt like he would be doing just that by following through with this.
“They can sense the baby, but not too early. Gabriel said that only archangels can feel it at the start, and with Michael and Lucifer in the Cage, he was the only one who knew at first. Heaven can only feel the nephilim after a few months. Cas says it’s because they give out a… signal, or something, but that it’s too weak for a while. But…” He licked his dry lips, giving them a weak shrug, “I’m way past that window now.”
He turned his head back around and fixed her with a confused look, a frown forming on his brows. “What is it?”
Dean shook his head, his jaw tight, posture stiff. Every single word Cain said was true, and Dean hated it; hated how the Mark flared up in response to them as confirmation, as if to remind Dean that it was still there, to make sure Dean knew Cain was right.
, and I spent hours upon hours thinking about this and planning, because if I was going to add it, then I wanted it to make sense and fit well into the story, and I'm pretty happy with how this chapter turned out. There's something oddly interesting to me about the idea of the bond needing a balance, of changes happening on both ends to make sure that the bond is still held between one full angel and one full human.
Picking the tests up (being careful not to touch the end of them he had peed on, because that was just gross) and sitting down on the toilet, Dean just stared down at the tests in his hands, feeling the tears running down his cheeks and not even bothering to fight them anymore. He just stayed there for countless minutes, feeling oddly numb all of a sudden and without a clue of what to do with himself, of how he should be reacting to this.
Dean kneeled on the bed, gripping the waistband of Cas’ boxers in his hands and pulling them off. He couldn’t help but licking his lips in anticipation at the sight of Cas’ hardened length, leaking and just begging for attention. Dean almost felt bad for letting Cas give him a hand job when the angel had been so desperately needing some attention too, but he was about to make them even right now.
“I’ll tell you when I get back, Sammy. It’s kind of a pretty complicated thing.” And Dean really didn’t feel like having such a lengthy conversation over the phone right now. “I’ll call you when Cas and I decide to leave, alright?”
step, he hoped. Maybe someday, Claire would be okay with this. Maybe someday she would even allow Castiel to be a part of her life again, would let him
Castiel's eyebrows rose at those words, and he took a moment to process that information, trying (and failing) to wrap his head around it.
“The address,” she explained, once again lifting her phone for Dean to be able to see the screen, and the hunter found himself staring at a Google search of the address.
That was actually how Cas found him—eyeing his stomach for what felt like the hundredth time in the last five minutes, looking like he was almost afraid of it somehow.
To try to battle that feeling, Dean kept reminding himself over and over again that Gabriel had assured them Juliet would be able to recover fully; she’d only have to do it the natural way. It would take a while, sure, and she might still be in pain for a few days, but it took a bit more than that to kill a hellhound, which was surely a thought Dean had never imagined he’d ever feel so grateful for.
“Heaven does not care,” Cas shook his head lightly, and his voice was suddenly much heavier with something Sam couldn’t quite identify. It was still odd to see Cas looking so human, letting out so many clear emotions that Sam wasn’t used to seeing on him, but he assumed he would just have to get used to it. He wondered how much of it was brought on by the soul bond; if being tied to a human made Cas more human somehow, or if this was just Dean’s influence on him. He had no idea, and he was curious, but this wasn't the right time for that conversation, so he just filed it away for later. “Our circumstances do not matter. All Heaven cares about is that every hybrid has to die. I’ve—” His voice cut off abruptly, and he looked away again, as if he couldn’t bear to continue speaking while looking at them for some reason. “I know that firsthand.”
Dean’s head whipped back around, just in time to watch as the wendigo trudged into the room, its teeth bared, claws scratching at the dirt in anger. It was clearly not happy to see Dean in here, playing with its food, but it didn’t charge at him right away. No, instead, it chose to linger by the entrance of the cave, using its one good eye to measure the hunter up carefully, like it wasn’t sure what exactly to make of him, which made sense. Dean was pretty sure that this thing had never seen a werewolf before, let alone a freaking hybrid.
He had been surprised when Dean had told him; of course he had. But then again, Dean had always posed a pictured for Sam—and their father, as Sam knew now—of the straight alpha male. And Sam had never questioned it; not really. Sometimes they’d tease each other about the other acting gay about something, but those comments had always been nothing but jokes; bickering between two siblings. Sam had never thought to be any actual truth in any of it.
Cain glanced down at the Blade for a second. “True,” he agreed, before looking back up at the archangel, his expression not once shifting for the air of superiority that just seemed to always linger around him. “What are you doing here, Gabriel? You have been following me for weeks.”
He didn't immediately go back downstairs once he was ready, though, instead choosing to perch on his place by Cas once again, not feeling like leaving just yet. The angel was still asleep, still completely unmoving under the thick warm blanket he was buried under, breathing blessfully slow and deep. Dean lifted a careful hand to run it through the angel's hair as he watched him, feeling a stabbing pain in his heart at the thought of leaving the seraph alone, especially when he pressed his palm to Cas' forehead and found that the damn fever was still going strong.
Another wave of heat washed over his entire body as soon as he did it, but this one was even more intense than all the others, and
Hannah was Cas’ friend, regardless of all that. And she might just be the reason they would be able to save Cas’ life. They owed her this, at least.
And apparently, all those hours of sleep had been exactly what he'd needed, anyway, since he could barely feel any pain anymore.
Dean shook his head again. “I don’t know. But... maybe we should start by checking the churches closer to the Novak house, because maybe that's the one Jimmy used to go to. Or maybe there's something in the poem that will help us, some kind of hint that we just can't see right now.”
The air of the living room was currently filled with the sounds of ingredients being prepared, which at the moment were being caused by Sam, who was chopping up something a few feet away. He worked without pause, a concentrated frown in his brows as he rhythmically pushed the knife he was holding in his hand downward, forcing the sharp metal blade to slide against the rough surface of whatever it was that the younger Winchester was getting ready for the spell, moving the knife until the blade hit the wooden board below, which produced a dry, repetitive thud that echoed through the air of the room in even intervals. And those sounds were something that Dean should be used to by now, after years and years of preparing ingredients for spells during the eventual hunt or occasion where they needed to resort to magic, but for some reason, tonight, all those sounds seemed louder than normal, almost painful to his ears, so much that he couldn't help but flinch because of them a few times, resisting the urge to lift his hands to press them against his ears in an effort to block out the noise.
But still, even if the noise was indeed bothering him quite a lot, even if it was surely making all the pain relatively harder to endure, Dean really couldn't complain about it. They had to get everything ready for the spell, and all this preparation was the only way to do that.
Cas blinked a few times, looking up at Sam with a confused frown in his brows. The angel looked disoriented, but that wasn’t exactly surprising. Sam wasn’t sure for how many hours Cas had been out, but he knew for certain that the whole showdown in Ohio had happened several hours ago. “Sam? How…? Why…?” Cas’ voice was even lower than usual, throaty and rough, like he hadn’t spoken in days, even if in fact it had only been hours.
floating around in his head, so many doubts just piling up in his mind, he didn’t even know how to sort through all those thoughts, and it wasn't like he could just turn it all off, as much as he wanted to. He had spent the handful of hours Cas had slept just lying in bed thinking about everything that had happened yesterday and this morning, and he still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around everything.
to look for you. I mean, I get why she did it, why she wanted to find Jimmy—I really do—and she definitely doesn’t deserve to die here, of course not, but again, abandoning everything to go looking for you was
"My little brother had turned six months old that exact same day, though I don't really remember much of it. I just... I remember waking up in the middle of night to my Mom screaming. I felt scared as soon as I heard it, of course, but when I heard my Dad calling out for her and literally
Haley shook her head, and her eyes were still a little wide. She was looking right at him, too, like she was looking for something on his face. “Nothing, I just... I thought I saw something.”
Castiel paused to mull that information over for a moment, considering it carefully, spinning it around inside his head so he could look at it from a few different angles. Perhaps that made sense. Perhaps learning that their situation wasn’t as simple as she’d originally thought was enough to make some of the girl’s anger wane, even if only a little. It seemed to have worked, anyway—Claire had been surprisingly subdued during lunch. She hadn’t been
Dean’s head snapped around at the sound of a familiar voice reaching his ears without a warning. He jumped a little, startled, although maybe he shouldn’t be as surprised as he was once he realized who was standing just a few steps behind him. It had been a while since the last time he’d seen her; he’d almost forgotten about her, actually, with everything that had been happening lately, but the truth was that he hadn’t really had much of a reason to think about her again until now. He still had no idea who she was, or how she seemed to be appearing inside his head like this. He still didn’t even know if she was actually real, but he was still betting on her being nothing more than a sick, weird creation from the Mark to mess with his head. It would make sense, honestly.
to feel like that. I want to just sit back and smile, just pop open a cold one and celebrate that we fucking
“Your phone was in your pants pocket. I… found it uncomfortable to leave it there and removed it. It’s in your nightstand, although I believe the battery is dead. I did not see any point in recharging it if you were not going to use it.”
“It is nothing relevant,” he replied lowly, pressing the tips of his fork into the meat and letting them dig into the small piece he had cut free from the rest, “Or at least nothing that can be fixed now.”
And that was precisely the reason why about five minutes later, Dean found himself walking out of the bathroom with the unwanted clothes still cradled in his arms. He'd made his decision by then, and he was very determined to follow through with it.
The first thing he noticed was the ache. Every single muscles of his body hurt, even when he wasn’t trying to move them. He must have worked one hell of a hunt the day before, or maybe he was just getting too old for this. Either way, he just couldn’t find it in him to move for a long time, instead just enjoying the bed he was lying on for a little longer, even if the cheap motel mattress definitely wasn’t that comfortable. Anything was better than moving, so the lumpy bed would be more than enough. Despite the insistent complaints from all over his body, he rolled over to his side, wrapping the comforter a little tighter around himself as he allowed his head to sink into the pillow with a sigh.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed out, nodding lightly, “We’ll try over here as well. I mean, four heads working together is better than two, right?”
He was running a moment later, and he hadn’t even realized he had started up the stairs until he was already taking the steps two at a time and was halfway up the wooden structure. It whined against the pressure applied by his feet, against the speed of his steps, the weight being pressed to the worn, old wood with more urgency than prudence should allow it, but Sam didn’t care.
But all that nervousness, all that dread dissolved into nothing only a few seconds later when the look in the angel's eyes shifted into something warm, something
"Yes, it is," Castiel cut him off before the other hybrid could finish whatever he'd been about to say. "You don't think we should keep doing this. You don't see the point. And even if that's not what this is about and you're truly just worried this is a trap that Meg's laid down for me, it really doesn't matter. I'm still going. If there's even a
And that pattern was indeed very much different from how Cas' wings were colored. The angel's wings were black all over, and there were no shades, no change of color from the top of Cas' wings all the way down to the lowest portions of them. The dark shade of black that painted the very tip of the seraph's flight feathers was the exact same one that colored the smaller feathers covering the joints on Cas' back. The exact same shade of black covered the entire extent of Cas' wings, not even a single spot of a different color visible anywhere.
pretty sure that she’d just been lashing out, that she might not have been so angry at them if her mother wasn't currently in the hospital and dying, but he also had a feeling that even after that anger faded, even after the dust settled and some time passed, Claire would still be wary of them from now on. She would never truly forgive them, not really, and getting close to her again definitely wouldn’t be easy.
” Gabriel continued his rant, “They say they don’t know anything for sure, but how can’t they? For fuck’s sake, they’re
He would do everything he could to figure out what was wrong with him, and then he would find a way to fix it. He
By the way Cas’ face fell, though, a hint of sadness suddenly clear in those deep, intense blue eyes, Dean knew he hadn’t been fast enough.
“I know,” Dean breathed out a heavy, tired sigh, but the tension in his muscles remained, even as the Mark seemed to quiet down a little, probably thanks to Cas. He took in a deep breath, deciding that worrying about what might happen wouldn’t do him any good, so instead he chose not to think about it right now. Instead, he chose to focus on something else, “Crowley knows, though.”
“This isn’t the kind of tracking spell you’re thinking of, I’m afraid,” Gabriel replied easily, not sparing the younger Winchester even a single a glance, instead choosing to look over everything that was spread over the table in front of him, probably to make sure that they really had everything here and that whatever ingredients Sam and Charlie had already gotten ready for the spell had been properly prepared.
He stumbled a little as he walked, his balance suddenly off, as if the walls were spinning around him, the floor no longer solid and static under his feet, instead shaking, undulating unsteadily as he walked. The hallways looked even longer than it had before, the walls closing in on him from all sides. The lights were too bright and not enough at the same time, his vision going in and out of focus, solid walls dancing before his eyes as if they were made of rubber. Nothing felt real, nothing felt solid enough, not even the floor beneath his feet.
He felt Sam tense up in his arms, and without even being able to actually see his face Dean already knew he'd caught his brother completely off guard, a thought that was confirmed barely a moment later when Sam abruptly pulled away from him, which made Charlie let go of him as well. And when Dean finally caught sight of his brother's face, what he saw there was no surprise to him—shock mingled with something very close to awe flooded Sam's eyes, but there was something else in there too, something even heavier and that Dean couldn't quite name.
It was quite an abrupt thing—one second, the wall was there, solid and sturdy, an impenetrable barrier keeping anything that Cas could be feeling in that moment from slipping into the bond.
He’d asked Cas about the whole dreaming thing one night, and as it turned out the angel did dream, but it was a pretty new thing for Cas. It had first happened when he had been human, but his dreams had stopped once he’d gotten some more Grace, because apparently angels didn't dream at all. They had started again after he and Cas had bonded, although his dreams tended to not be at all coherent, and he usually didn’t remember them afterwards.
Sam glared at her a little, but chose to ignore that little jab. “I just…” He looked back down at his salad and pulled in a breath, trying to steady himself. When that proved itself completely unhelpful and words still escaped him, he shook his head and reached into his pocket, pulling out his phone. He unlocked the screen and fiddled with it for a while, going through his search history until he finally found the web page he was looking for.
“I can’t remove the Mark of Cain myself, not with the information I have currently, but I might find a way do something about it.”
pay it any mind. No, all he could do was raise his hands up to his head and grab at it, squeezing his eyes shut as an anguished scream tore out of his mouth without his consent. His knees buckled under his weight, simply giving out, since the hunter no longer had the presence of mind to make sure that they were doing their job, and Dean fell to the ground, landing heavily onto the cement, still gripping his head, fingers digging into his hair.
Sam could see she was uncomfortable, and very much so, but that only made him want to insist. He had been intrigued by this, but honestly, his curiosity was spiking even more now, because he wasn’t sure what could get Charlie to act like this, but whatever it was, it had him more than just a little worried.
“Gabriel, you said there were matters you wished to discuss with both of us.” Leave it to Cas to sound so calm and professional after a comment like that, although there was a small edge to his voice that Dean did not fail to notice, one that bordered on irritation, which the angel was just barely able to conceal.
When he was happy with what he saw, he decided it was time to work on her interior. He rearranged the trunk first, taking all the bags out and checking what needed to be replaced or refilled, and quickly he realized that they were running a little low on salt rounds. He made a mental note to make more of those later, because even though they had no plans of going hunting any time soon, you just never knew when you might need them. It would be stupid to drive around without any of it ready for use.
“I meant what I said back at the bar,” Dean let out before he could think better of it, before he could change his mind about saying anything at all, “I really don’t know what I want anymore. A week ago, I was
So the next thing Dean knew was that he was moving again, scooting closer to Cas and hurriedly finding his way between the angel's legs, settling in the space he found there. He bent his body forward without a thought, lowering his head and letting his tongue slip out of his mouth so that it could find the seraph's dick, and then he was licking a wet trail from the bottom of Cas' erect cock all the way up to the tip, closing his eyes and groaning lowly in his throat when the very distinct taste of precome filled his mouth, assaulting his taste buds.
But Dean didn’t really have time to comment on it, as a moment later her entire demeanor changed once more, going back to what it had been earlier so fast that the abrupt shift had Dean even more confused. He frowned a little at her, and she smiled softly at him, almost soothingly, and he assumed she must have noticed his confusion.
He felt like himself again. He’d been a hybrid for over a month, but ever since Superior, he’d felt… off, like there was something wrong, something… missing. He’d just assumed he'd been feeling that way because he wasn’t human anymore, because his subconscious was just… overly aware of that fact, feeling the need to remind him that there was something
The waitress came and went, depositing a brand new round of beers onto their table before spinning around and walking away to wait on another table, and it was only when Dean was holding a full bottle of beer in his hand that he finally found it in himself to start talking.
Angels are pretty narrow-minded—not Cas, because he’s spent a lot of time down here on Earth, but all the others who are up there in Heaven. They see everything in black and white, and all they care about is that the baby’s a nephilim, so to them, it has to die. There really is no reasoning with them. They don’t listen.”
“No, I didn’t complete the change by feeding,” Cas said, a small, sad smile playing on his lips. “That choice was actually taken away from me while I was unconscious, and completely unaware of what was happening to me.”
“Well, firstly that you…" Sam swallowed once, like he wasn't quite sure how to voice whatever he wanted to say right then, and when he tried again his voice had grown a lot lower, tentative even, like he wasn't sure how Dean was going to react to his words, "That you've been pregnant since Omaha."
The words echoed inside his head more than once, repeated over and over again to make sure that every single angel would receive the message clearly, which was not by any means unusual. However, the fact that he was hearing that message at all could only mean one thing—Heaven had been informed of the events of tonight by one the angels that had come to find Castiel here.
Briefly, Dean wondered if the animals knew what they were, if they knew to stay away—if somehow, they could
“Mornin’ to you too, Sammy,” Dean grumbled, rolling his eyes. His voice sounded gruff, still rough with sleep.
It really was a good thing that they’d decided to take Cas’ car instead of the Impala, and not only because the Lincoln should call considerably less attention to itself. With Charlie driving, Dean could just concentrate on the bond, both looking for any signs of Cas' Grace nearby and trying to guess if there was anything wrong with the angel, still feebly hanging on to the hope that he would be able to tell if he needed to go back to the house so that the seraph’s rapidly fading borrowed Grace could try to recharge just a little bit more. And okay, Dean knew that Sam was with Cas right now and that his brother would call him the second something went wrong—
"I'm not trying to pressure you or anything, Dean," Dean looked up at her then, finally finding himself able to hold her gaze, "But I don't think you should hide who you are from your own brother. It's not fair to him, but most importantly, it's not fair to you. And I mean, when has hiding things from each other ever worked well for the two of you?" Dean actually chuckled at that, although weakly, and Charlie smiled, resting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it lightly. "There's no need to be scared, Dean. Sam loves you, and I'm pretty sure nothing could change that, especially not something like this." She sounded so sincere and sure of her words that Dean actually felt compelled to believe her, but he wasn't at all convinced. Just a few reassuring words were definitely not enough to send away the powerful fear he felt at the prospect of coming out to his brother.
He could feel Cas’ Grace even more strongly now, so much that it was truly impossible to ignore it. Apparently there had been no real reason for him to worry about walking past Cas’ Grace at all, because there was just no freaking way he would have ever been able to miss
A dark shadow passed over some of their features, but Dean couldn’t be sure what exactly they were all thinking, what kinds of thoughts were running through their heads, until Gabriel actually put them into words.
It was actually surprising how well he and Charlie had been getting along throughout the past few days—honestly, that girl had turned to be a freaking godsend.
Keeping those thoughts in mind, Castiel asked, “Where’s the text?” He stepped over to the table Sam and Charlie were sitting at, letting his eyes scan all the papers and books currently resting on top of it, but he didn’t find anything new there. “The one you said you needed help with?”
Jo was quick to steer them in that direction, but her steps were much slower now, overly careful as they blindly navigated the space around them. Sam could tell Jo had a hand raised, since he could hear a series of low, light thumps once the girl found a wall to guide them, and eventually, she managed to slap her hand over the light switch as they passed it. Light washed over their surroundings instantly, draping over the entire living room and finally allowing them to see where they were going. Sam squinted his eyes at the sudden brightness currently assaulting his retinas, but Jo didn’t give him time to pause and get used to it. No, she kept dragging him forward until they reached the armchair placed by the TV, where she all but dropped him, removing his arm from around her shoulders and twisting her body so that he’d lose his balance and fall heavily onto the dark blue cushions.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Charlie shift on her feet, and it was only then that the hunter remembered Sam and Charlie were still there, standing less than three feet away, just awkwardly hovering there like they weren’t quite sure what to do with themselves.
That last part was spoken in a low, pleading whisper, like Cas wasn’t sure if he was even allowed to say something like that right now.
The effect caused by those words was instantaneous, and pretty freaking obvious in the way Cas’ features immediately became more serious, the way his amusement faded from his face in a second, only to be replaced by blatant, unmasked arousal as the angel’s pupils dilated again, leaving nothing more than a ring of blue to be seen in his eyes.
He knew that if he slept now, in the middle of the morning, his sleeping schedule would be thrown off a little, but he didn’t really care. He was too tired to worry about that. He really just wanted to sleep.
Castiel paused. His eyes hardened visibly, and he pressed his lips together tightly for a moment before he finally looked away. Dean had really hit a nerve, it seemed, because Castiel was silent for a long moment, until he finally pulled in a breath, which he let out in a big, heavy sigh. He shook his head, as though attempting to clear it, before he finally answered, “There’s a lot more blood on my hands than there is on yours; I’ll tell you that.” He turned his head back around to fix Dean with yet another intense, unwavering stare. “Perhaps that’s why I’m here. Maybe this is all just an attempt to… redeem myself, in a way. But what truly matters here is that I’m trying. I could have just given up like you have. I could have found a hunter to kill me and take the easy way out, but I didn’t do that. I'm trying to... do something with my life, even after losing everything I had and everyone I cared about. I'm trying to
The psychic was silent for another long moment, clearly struggling to wrap his head around everything he'd been told, and once again, Dean and Charlie waited in silence, giving him the time he needed.
When he was sure he wouldn’t lose his balance again and fall to the floor (which maybe wouldn’t be so bad, really, because then they would be lying down, and Dean was very much on board with that turn of events), Dean responded to Cas’ kiss with just as much enthusiasm as he could, once again letting his tongue slide into the angel’s mouth, gasping for air but not for one moment leaning away to breathe properly because they hadn’t kissed like this, dirty and hungry, teeth scraping together and lips actually feeling like they would be bruised after this, for freaking weeks. Dean honestly couldn’t get enough of this right now.
His eyes did flit over to Dean, though, looking like he was assessing the damage on him for a moment as well.
Dean lifted his arm, running his hand through his hair and then down his face, scratching the growing beard that covered his jaw. He felt this weird, nervous bubbling in his stomach at those words, a tight feeling settling in his chest as he realized that this put some pressure on what he had to do next. This meant Sam would most likely demand answers from him at some point; he knew just how pushy his brother could be.
“You haven’t answered me, Dean,” he pointed out calmly, though there was a clear hint of something to his voice, like he was enjoying this whole thing, how much his words were getting to both of them. “Is that why you are not holding the Blade yourself? Because you still have hope you might not descend into the same darkness that I have tangled myself into? Do you believe it possible to resist the Mark? That it is possible not to succumb to it?”
Dean opened his mouth to protest, but closed it shut again just a second later, letting his eyes flit back and forth between Sam and Charlie for a beat, finding identically determined looks on their faces. They were probably right, and he knew that, but that didn’t mean he had to be happy about this. Still, as he saw no point in arguing with the two, since this was clearly a lost battle already, Dean’s body sagged in defeat as he leaned back against the headboard with a sigh.
“If either Heaven or the Stynes somehow find you here, right now, with Castiel in the state he’s in, they’re dead. There’s no fighting, there’s no healing him anymore. Yes, they only have a few days, and that means that if they get caught up in another fight, it’s over. Dean’s body can’t handle the stress, and Castiel’s Grace can’t handle any more wounds. So
Dean shed his clothes in the bedroom to the sound of the shower running in the adjacent room, his monkey suit already waiting for him on the bed, all clean and neat, the sight of it almost mocking. He hated wearing a suit, he always had, and even though he had done it for years now, he still couldn’t get comfortable in that penguin vest. It was just tight and constricting in all the wrong places.
Dean held himself back from huffing and rolling his eyes, because he wasn’t a freaking dog, damn it, and he was pretty sure that particular tactic wouldn’t have worked on a normal wolf either. Instead of letting his contempt show, however, he simply ignored her words and kept moving, figuring it would be best to just get this over with as quickly as possible.
And when he was finally ready to leave, Dean walked into the kitchen to grab the lasagna, and then stopped in the living room again, finally taking in the scene that greeted him there, finding that it hadn't changed much since the last time he'd been here. The ghost was still standing in the middle of the room watching TV, where another episode of Dr. Sexy MD had apparently started at some point while Dean had been getting ready. Apparently there were going to be a few reruns of the show tonight, maybe even a marathon.
“Are you okay?” Charlie’s voice was tentative, almost like she was stepping on eggs around Sam, like she felt she should tread carefully, and that made Sam realize that maybe he was being a little scary. But maybe he was entitled to, anyway. He
“Still don’t believe me?” Meg asked, “Well, don’t worry—you will soon enough. Because when we get out of here, Clarence, I’ll make sure to show you exactly how
There were still a lot of questions floating around in Sam's head, though, ones that he couldn't quite ignore, but he hadn’t really gotten a chance to ask any of those until now. For hours all they had done was plan and talk about what they would do; revise their strategy over and over again to make sure that there were no flaws anywhere; that every single detail had been thoroughly thought out, because they just could not afford anything to go wrong at all. They had to get Dean out of the Stynes’ grasp as fast as possible, making sure that there were no risks involved because they just couldn’t have Dean in the actual fight, and even though Cas denied it, Sam was also aware that the angel couldn’t put himself in harm’s way too much either. Dean and the baby were tied to him, after all.
However, please keep in mind that there are a few mentions of the suicide attempt after that point, and Castiel is still in a very,
Letting out another sigh, Dean bent his body forward, pressing his elbows down against his thighs so he could lower his face onto his palms. Fuck, he hated waiting around like this—absolutely
Most of the inside of this cabin was still pretty foreign to Dean, and he hadn't yet been to this place's kitchen, so he wasn't sure where that even was, but it was easy enough for him to follow the smell of the food. Fortunately that didn’t make him very nauseous again, although Dean’s stomach did flip at how the smell became stronger with every step he took toward the kitchen, but at least he didn’t feel like making a break for the bathroom again. He hoped that meant he would also be able to keep food down now, because his baby needed him to eat, especially now that he'd already taken his vitamins.
He opened up the first search result, which took him to the website of a newspaper called the ‘Pontiac Daily Gazette’, then let his eyes scan all the headlines displayed on the page, looking for a familiar last name, but silently praying that he wouldn’t actually find anything. There was nothing worth noting at the top of the page, amongst the most recent stories published on the site, so he scrolled down, finding a small space on the right side of the page that displayed the most popular articles of the week.
“In the ICU,” Sam replied, his voice low and somber. “The doctors have no idea what’s really wrong with her, though. We gave them a filtered, bullshit version of the whole story, and I can tell they’re not really buying all of it, but at least they seem to have dropped it for now. Anyway, the point is—they’re not… they’re not very confident. She’s fading fast. They're not sure if she's even gonna make it through the night.”
“Do you remember when Dad came back from the hunt?” Dean winced at the memory, the sound of his father’s voice still too clear in his ear, even after all these years, even after all that had happened since then, even with how much he himself had changed, “The fight?”
Well, that definitely didn’t sound good. Castiel knew that this whole thing must have been premeditated, of course, that whoever was behind it had planned everything out carefully, choosing a date when his entire family would be in Pontiac, not to mention that they’d managed to kidnap a total of sixteen people without being seen, without leaving a single trace behind.
It sounded like the man was barely managing to keep it together, like he could barely even let those words out.
Under the covers, a hand rested on Dean’s naked hip, just above the waistband of his boxers, massaging the skin softly, reassuringly. “Just a few more weeks, then the morning sickness should be gone.”
“I’m not really hungry, Cas,” he said instead. He actually felt a little nauseous, honestly, and he doubted he'd be able to keep anything down right now.
So yeah, Dean hadn't been left with much of a choice on the matter but to accept his half in the end. He wouldn't use the money, though; of course not. He'd opened a savings account for Ben as soon as he'd gotten it, and he'd vowed to never touch even a single penny of it, because his son always came first.
Gabriel shrugged, “They can’t because they literally Fell from Heaven and their wings burned to featherless crisps. They’re useless now. I was on Earth when Metadouche did the spell, so I didn’t Fall with them. My wings never burned.”
The expression on his face didn’t seem that much better, though. Cas’ eyes still looked distant and stormy, his jaw just a bit too tight, shoulders stiff, tense, as if a weight had settled over them after he opened up about his family. And as Dean noticed all that, as he took it all in, his hand tightening around his bottle, the hunter wished he could do even
“Because…?” Sam’s voice was tentative, but surprisingly not reprimanding. He was frowning, too, and there was that careful, almost hesitant look in his eyes his brother wore when he knew he had to tread calmly. Briefly, Dean wondered if he was really being so obvious about how uncomfortable and nervous he really was, but he allowed himself to be glad that his brother could read him so easily; that Sam could already tell this wasn’t going to be something easy for Dean to talk about, even if his brother had lied to him about it and Sam had no idea what could possibly be making Dean act like this.
—they had to be laughing their ass off at his misery right now. Sure, Dean had complained that he was lonely, but
He nodded in response. "Yeah, I'm a little over 19 weeks along, so about... four and half months, pretty much."
Jack pulled away from his father at the sound of a new voice, and all eyes in the room moved to find a nurse standing by the door, holding a clipboard and a pen in her hands—Tessa, more specifically.
"I wanted to make sure you really couldn't hear me," Cas explained. "It seemed... odd to me that you couldn't, and I thought that maybe you were just too... disoriented after your resurrection, and that perhaps I should simply give you time to adjust. And so I waited a few days before I tried to talk to you that way one last time."
So he kept breathing, pulling that putrid air into Jimmy Novak's lungs and letting it out rhythmically as his wings beat periodically by his sides, keeping him in the air. Of course, flying through this place would be much easier without a human vessel, but their entire group would be completely useless in a battle against demons without a body down here, where the foul creatures had so many advantages over them already, not to mention that the angel who succeeded in locating The Righteous Man would need a body to raise the human from Perdition, to take his soul back to Earth and rebuild the man's body back to what it had been before Dean Winchester had perished under the claws and between the jaws of Lilith's hellhounds. And for those reasons, every single angel that had come on this mission had needed to take a human vessel.
“No angel has to die,” Dean was shaking his head vigorously now, desperate for Cas to understand that maybe there was a way out of this.
They laid down on the bed right away, and it was just a matter of a mere couple of minutes until Cas was out, curled up to Dean, holding on to the hunter even in his sleep.
And now, as they echoed inside his head once more, Dean was suddenly getting self-conscious about this whole dancing idea, and he just hoped Cas wouldn’t read too much into it, into the song playing into the background, because maybe that would be too much for the angel, and the last thing Dean wanted was to overwhelm Cas somehow and scare him off.
. He eyed Dean’s form on the bed for a second, as if drinking him in, his eyes darkened by his blown pupils, and it was only a short moment later that Cas was climbing up onto the bed.
Sam’s eyes softened considerably as he watched Dean pause, probably realizing that he’d struck a nerve. His voice was a lot gentler when he added, “Rowena really is our last resort, Dean. We can’t afford to keep going like this, just sitting around waiting for a miracle. We really don’t have that kind of time, and you know that.”
But now, with Cas’ Grace so weak and Mark so strong, the issue had come back, and Dean couldn’t even think of getting turned on before the whispers started, leaving him shaky and disoriented. He could almost feel the control he had on his mind slipping through his finger every freaking time it had happened, so of course had hadn’t had an orgasm in over a month. And that was like, super unhealthy, he was aware, but there really wasn’t anything he could do to fix that.
No, but the problem was that he just had this weird feeling in his gut that told him something was wrong, not because of the situation itself, but he was just overly aware that everything around him was just so... fragile, like something was bound to come crashing down and destroy everything without a warning, because that was just what always happened; it was how his life was supposed to be. He had basically gotten used to just
He ripped the top of the bag easily, just like he’d done with the ones he’d drunk back in the Men of Letters' Bunker, and then he was pressing the bag to his mouth and drinking, sucking at it and gulping down mouthful after mouthful of blood. His breath hitched and his heartbeat spiked again, but for an entirely different reason this time. He drained three of the bags dry, letting each of them fall to the floor by his feet once it was empty, before he moved on to the next one.
Dean swallowed, feeling his throat running a little dry again, but he still managed to ask, “Complicate things how?”
Castiel paused, as if to consider that new piece of information, before he finally commented on it—tentatively, of course, clearly still choosing his words carefully. "So you're okay with drinking from blood bags now?"
“Hey, buddy,” he whispered, feeling his chest a little lighter now that he could actually hug Ben. However, he could easily feel how his son was clinging to him a bit too tightly for it to be considered a normal hug, as though the boy was afraid his father might pull away and leave if he weakened his hold on him, which caused yet another stab of pain in Dean's heart. “Daddy’s here, okay? I’m here.”
So he found himself talking, feeling the need to fill that tense, loaded silence, maybe in an unconscious effort to distract himself from the suffocating worry he could feel growing heavy inside his chest right then.
Gabriel seemed to mull over that explanation for a beat, until eventually, he nodded—accepting the hunter’s reasoning, it looked like. “Do you know what did it? If it was these people—the ones who took
However, even after Claire was dealt with, Dean still felt like they couldn’t just leave, even if all Dean truly wanted to do in that moment was say goodnight to Jody and turn around, to just get back in his car and drive away, heading back to the motel so he could curl up in bed with Cas and finally get some sleep.
So Dean had allowed that silence to linger, giving the six of them time to mull over everything he’d told them, while he focused his attention on something else entirely.
He was still panting, although he wasn’t on the floor anymore. No, he was in his room, and at that realization he sat up. Everything was still spinning but it was so much sharper than before and why was he here? Was he still in the Mark's illusion? The duvet and pillows under his hands felt soft and real, but were they really? How could he know? How could—
The Bunker was awfully silent, even more than usual. It felt emptier without Sam here and with Dean… unconscious. It was an odd, unsettling feeling, and Castiel felt almost uncomfortable with the vast emptiness of it around him, which seemed almost silly in his mind, but it was the truth nonetheless. He realized he had never been in the Bunker by himself before, and he assumed that must be the reason for that feeling.
Jack’s sobs didn’t stop—in fact, they seemed to grow even louder at that—but there wasn’t much more that Castiel could do but rock Jack gently, doing his best to calm his son down and be there for him, to hold him while he cried, reminding him over and over again that no matter how much it hurt, he wasn’t alone in this. He didn’t have to shoulder this pain alone.
And once more, Sam found himself surprised, because he’d had no idea this had been going through Cas’ head at the time. Back then, Sam had believed Cas had simply thought to be doing the right thing. He had believed Cas' explanation without questioning it, but now it all made so much more sense. Yet again he did not understand how he had not been able to see there had been much more to the situation than he'd believed at the time.
But as Dean looked at him, he realized that Crowley knew exactly what was going on here, if the look the demon threw Dean’s way was anything to go by, lingering on the hunter’s face before flitting down to his stomach for just a second before he was looking at Sam once more, all of it happpening so quickly Dean almost missed it.
Dean had no other choice but to agree with Cas on that one. Meddling with time was tricky, and they had no way to know what would actually happen if they changed something as big as Dean’s decision to take on the Mark. If you really thought about it, if it wasn't for the Mark, maybe he and Sam never would have gone to work that hunt in Omaha all those months ago, and Dean and Cas wouldn’t even be where they were now. Maybe Dean would never have gotten pregnant at all.
what he was doing to him. Cas didn’t seem to be in a much different situation than Dean was, anyway.
So he shook his head—weakly, pitifully, just as a tiny, broken sound found its way out of his mouth. It sounded like a weird mixture between a sob and a whine.
The thing didn’t seem very convinced about that, though, and after a moment, it finally seemed to make its decision. A loud snarl escaped its mouth—the loudest, ugliest one yet—and then it pounced again, going right for Dean without even a second of hesitation.
should make all the necessary adjustments to a man’s body so that it would be possible for one to carry a child, but what does that mean for Dean exactly?”
A hand came down to rest on his back, pressing lightly against his clothed skin—a gesture that was probably meant to soothe him, Dean assumed.
"Cas, what happened to my jacket?" Dean remembered he'd been wearing his brown leather jacket when they'd found Cas' Grace. He distinctly recalled shoving his hand into the inside pocket of the jacket and pulling out the engraved key he and Charlie had found at the library so that he could open the padlock that had been keeping that warded chest locked shut, but Dean wasn't wearing the jacket anymore. And considering that his wings had apparently burned through the two shirts he was wearing when the things had sprouted right out of his freaking back, making it pretty much impossible for the hunter to take any of said shirts off now, Dean found it pretty weird that his jacket was currently missing.
because Cas’ eyes were blue, and because anything of that color instantly made Dean think of him. It was
Cas was thrown to the side by what Dean could only assume was the same invisible force from before at a single flick from the creature’s wrist, landing on his side on the floor with a loud, muffled thud as the angel's body hit the carpet.
“Okay, you’re doing wonderfully so far,” Cas announced, a proud, bright smile playing on his lips that instantly made Dean feel better about himself. “Now, let’s try something else. Wait here.”
“What is this?” Castiel asked, confused. He could not understand the relevance of this information to their current tasks. He had never heard those names before, and he did not know what all the codes and words written around the names could possibly mean.
“Come on,” he wrapped an arm around Dean’s middle, urging him to stand up, “Let’s talk in the library. Hannah and Charlie are there.”
The girl's hand suddenly flew across the small space between them, grasping Dean's arm tightly, causing him to jump a little in surprise. Her eyes were wide and urgent as she asked, "You know what that means? Or at least, who Lazarus is?"
The message was clear, Cas might as well have written it down for Dean to read. Cas thought Dean was still mad at him and would push him away. He couldn’t be more wrong about that, however, because the single thought that Cas actually wanted this, wanted
Cas seemed pleased to hear that, nodding lightly in response before leaning in to kiss Dean lightly on the lips, almost reassuringly, as if silently trying to convince the hunter that he was fine enough for this. Dean let himself melt into the kiss, but it remained completely tame until the angel pulled away moments later, letting out a breath he let himself lie back down against Dean, pulling the hunter even closer, covering the human in warmth yet again. Dean felt the seraph kissing his jaw, nipping lightly at the skin and he just sighed, burying himself closer to Cas’ body, letting the heat engulf him. He felt lethargic, his muscles tired, although his mind was still oddly alert.
And Cas must have been really hungry, because he very much cleaned his plate, and he was done with his food in record time—not as fast as Dean, of course, but close enough that Sam was pretty surprised. The angel also drank the entire glass of water in one go, which also had the hunter’s eyebrows rising a bit in surprise. He really couldn’t decide whether Cas’ sudden appetite was a good thing or not, though, so he decided not to comment on it either, and instead simply took the tray from Cas once the angel was done with his food and left it on the bedside table, deciding that taking it downstairs could wait a little bit.
“And they said this would be difficult,” the man said, glancing down at the bloody blade of his knife like it was some sort of prize, a smug look in his eyes, a satisfied smile playing on his lips. “But all it took were a few strategically placed hex bags, some patience and of course, a big, sharp knife. Just wait until they all hear about it.”
“Not a chance, Cas,” Dean was quick to reply, because he had made the mistake of being too urgent before and not prepping enough, and he found out the worst way possible that rushing through this was definitely not worth it not being able to sit down for a whole freaking week. And even if Cas could heal himself so that it wouldn’t hurt, he would have to use his borrowed Grace for that, which was something Dean would very much like to prevent from happening.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, but found himself closing it shut only a couple of seconds later, finding that he didn’t exactly know what the right thing to say then was. He wasn’t sure how to put all his thoughts into words, how to best convey his feelings on this and make Cas see that he was completely, absolutely
The air was stale and definitely lacking oxygen the deeper he wandered into the mine, but he pressed on, choosing one of the only tunnels that didn't seem to lead deeper into the ground. He was careful to move as quietly as he could while he walked, stepping with caution, paws thumping softly against the dirt as he followed that rotten smell into one of the tunnels, figuring that was probably his best bet. At some point, the smell of blood started mingling in with all the others—
At that thought, Dean finally stepped off of the wendigo’s body, deciding he could just deal with it later. He moved slowly—not because of his wounds, because those had already healed by that point, but for both Ben’s and Haley’s sakes. He could feel Ben’s eyes following him as he crossed the room, but Dean kept his gaze focused on Haley as he walked, maintaining eye contact as he cautiously approached her and her unconscious brother.
Why had he seen this place, anyway? It had felt like a vision, though anything he saw only seemed to appear in his head when he was having some sort of breakdown because of the Mark of Cain. Still, those visions had led him here; had led him to where Cas was. What was he supposed to make of that? What did that even mean?
So he shook his head, still refusing to give in. His voice sounded surprisingly strong and determined when he argued, “My brother taking on the Mark is
“I woke up thinking I heard Dean call to me; felt him reach out to me through the bond, asking for help,” Castiel explained, carefully choosing his words as he spoke, “But he is not here, so I couldn’t tell what exactly that meant. And the bond is numb, weirdly so. It feels different than what it’s like when Dean is simply far away. And now…” He swallowed, shaking his head as he reminded himself once more that he could not explain to them exactly what he had just heard inside his head. He couldn’t tell them why exactly Heaven was coming for them; he couldn’t even mention it at all, in fact, if he wished to completely avoid suspicion. “There’s something wrong, and whatever happened, Dean reached out to me to ask for help before…” He shook his head again, “I’m not sure what, but whatever happened, I assume he might be unconscious. The bond feels too quiet now.”
“Will…” Dean swallowed, a curious thought occurring to him just then. He hadn’t even thought about this stuff before, but Cas mentioning fledgings just then seemed to have guided his thoughts in a different direction, “Do nephilims have wings too?”
“Leave him alone!” Ava was holding a crowbar in her hands, her eyes wide and frantic, her breathing a little heavy. Castiel hadn’t realized she’d woken up. “Let us go, you sick bastard!”
Dean felt his throat growing unnaturally dry at that question, but somehow, he managed to make himself nod. He honestly didn’t trust his voice enough to try speaking right now, so that was the only response that he allowed himself to offer.
In a second the archangel’s eyes were dancing over the ingredients and instructions for the spell, darting back and forth as he read the words written on the paper, growing completely silent as he did it. And maybe it was just Dean’s mind trying to be optimistic without his consent, but the hunter could swear he could see some of Gabriel’s color coming back to his face as the pause stretched on, as well as the usual spark flooding back into the archangel’s eyes, and even if maybe he shouldn’t, the human allowed just a tiny bit hope to blossom in his chest at the sight.
“I think so,” he replied with a small, halfhearted shrug. “I’m pretty sure I passed out at some point. Woke up still sitting in my chair, lying halfway over the table with a bunch of papers stuck to my face. Don’t know how long I was asleep for, though.” He also had a killer ache in his muscles, and his back had complained at every single move he made for about two hours after he woke up, but he chose not to comment on any of that right now.
“You want something to drink?” he asked when he finally managed to get his legs to move and followed his father into the living room, finding the man glancing around himself almost warily, taking in the room around him like he feared he might break something if he wasn’t careful or moved around too much. He looked so uncomfortable, so out of place, Sam would have found the scene amusing under normal circumstances.
“Yeah,” he replied, making his hands go back to work, making the small little stripes that covered his pie a little slower than before. He had never made one of this, but he knew it needed to be perfect. It was easy enough, anyway; all he had needed had been a few glances at the recipe he'd found online to get the gist of it. “I do. Always have, really.” As long as he could remember, anyway.
So he cleared his throat, finally finding his voice again. “We should let you rest,” he said, keeping his words low and gentle, “Claire will be back soon.”
Sam let out another breath after reading the reply, trying to push away the dark cloud of worry that instantly made itself known in his head when he learned that Dean had fallen asleep again. He chose to ignore all the unwanted thoughts that flooded his mind in that moment as he lifted his hand so that he could wave a waitress over—the same one who had taken his order for the takeout food just a few minutes ago. He asked for another dish exactly like Charlie’s—a big, complete meal with a beef, cheese, ham and egg sandwich, accompanied by lettuce, tomatoes, French fries, pickles, mayonnaise, corn and peas, all jammed into one big styrofoam container and ready to go. And he also asked for another cup of fresh orange juice, because that was healthiest drink on the menu that Sam thought either he or Cas could somehow convince his brother to drink.
look that Dean had been on the receiving end of way too many times during the past couple of weeks—had that same uneasiness he was getting awfully familiar with quickly making itself known in his gut.
It was Claire who asked that question, and Dean turned his head quickly to look at her eyes, taking in her unnervingly intense blue eyes—which seemed even sharper than before. She had them narrowed a bit now, too, which made her distrust of him all the more obvious.
He was going about this all wrong, he realized. The thing was, he didn’t want to get back into the life—not really. He didn’t need to go out and get himself back in shape, relearn the motions and pains of the hunting life, because he didn’t actually plan on doing this for long. That wouldn’t get him anywhere—in fact, it would do nothing to help him toward his end goal. In hindsight, going on that ghost hunt had been nothing but a waste of time.
That was all Dean had left of him—the blood covering that door, and the one that’d seeped into the fabric of his jacket, making up a bloody handprint—a mark heartbreakingly similar to the one Cas had left branded on Dean’s skin when he’d pulled the hunter out of Hell all those years ago—and it was on the
Dean nodded again. "Yeah. We can't have someone like Crowley getting his hands on it, even if he probably won't find a prophet to read it for him anytime soon."
Dean swallowed, no response coming to his mouth then, and he heard his brother sigh on the other end.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him. “But how the hell am I here? My Dad, he… how did you get through him?” Dread poured into Dean’s gut as he asked that last question, because he hadn’t thought about that until now. Fuck, if this guy had hurt his Dad…
“Are you fucking serious?” Dean couldn’t help but ask on the eighth day after they left Sioux Falls, on the same day they arrived in Littleton, Colorado. A few minutes prior, Sam had
“Yeah, it is,” Dean agreed with a small sigh of his own. “And that’s considering that I really found all the hybrid cases, and that all of them actually made the news, because if they didn’t, then we might still be missing a few.”
It’s just a gut feeling, really, but… what’s really worrying me about this is that I can actually count the times my gut feeling has been wrong about something like this on one freaking hand.”
“I know I shouldn’t be here.” His voice was low, barely a murmur, but it wasn’t like that made much of a difference. His mother wasn’t actually there to hear him talk.
.” Yeah, that was his prostate. His entire body tensed, and he howled as Cas began to hit it over and over again, making sure they were just the right angle as he thrust his hips up over and over again in time with Dean’s own movements, going as deep as he could and nailing Dean's protate every single time, “Fuck, right there, Cas... right, ah… right there, fuck…”
Fortunately, The Fox was pretty freaking professional, and she didn’t even bat an eye at his embarrassed, incoherent stuttering as she laid out the rules of the transaction that they would potentially be making—he would tell her what he needed, she would procure said item for a set price, and then they would meet again to finalize their deal. He would pay the full price, in cash, and she would in turn give him the item he’d asked for, no questions asked, from either of them—not about how she’d acquired said item, or why he needed it in the first place.
Some of the fight in Sam’s stance seemed to drain away at that, and instantly Dean knew he’d gotten it. Of course Cas wouldn’t have let Dean take on Cain if they hadn’t had a good reason, and they’d had a pretty heavy one.
Dean huffed at that thought, shaking his head and hastily pushing all those memories away, before he could linger too much on them and that familiar ache he felt blooming to life inside of him whenever he thought about Cas could get too unbearable.
Keeping that thought in the forefront of his mind, Dean picked up the vial with shaky hands, feeling the glass warm against his skin, and for a moment, he was mesmerized by the sight of the Grace concealed within the glass, as well as by the feeling of it in his hand, so clearly pulsating with life and power. He felt this rush running through his entire body, like his very being was singing in delight, thrilled as he literally held a piece of Cas' essence in his hand, which seemed to be resonating with the hunter's very soul.
for you. And your first turn needs to happen soon, or else you’ll never fully adjust to what you are now. Your body
Dean frowned, feigning confusion, though he was honestly a bit surprised by the dry reply. “I’m sorry, but it is.” He gestured between himself and the redhead standing right beside him with his hand. “We’re here because we—”
“I’m not going to say she’s fine, because that would be a lie, but… she’s holding on. She’s agreed to come back with us to Kansas while she adjusts, so… baby steps, I suppose.”
“Well, perhaps I should rephrase it, then. You have something that I want, and I have something that you want to keep alive. Does that sound about right?”
Dean didn't even have the chance to register his annoyance about the fact that he hadn't even said anything out loud and Cas had still answered his question, because suddenly all the hunter could really think about was the fact that Cas would actually need to go into his subconscious, that the angel was probably going to do that right now, and Dean definitely didn't feel ready for that. His heart picked up a much faster pace again, and he closed his eyes, squeezing them shut as he reminded himself of the train of thought that had calmed him down earlier, about how Cas would be careful and wouldn't look through all his private memories and thoughts, but for some reason, that just wasn't working anymore.
Which, in the end, had been exactly what had happened, as Cas had told him. The seraph had apparently heard the exact moment when Heaven had learned about the nephilim; had heard their alarms ringing loudly inside his head, as well as their surprised commentary and their initial planning to find the baby.
. Both archangel and seraph had sounded completely convinced of that, but there was still apprehension coiling in Dean’s gut about this plan, because he had no idea what Cas’ Grace would feel like, what kind of feeling exactly he should be looking out for. And how could Gabriel and Cas even know that for sure, anyway? Something like this had never happened before, so what if they were wrong? What if Dean walked right past Cas’ Grace because he didn’t know how to tell he was feeling it nearby? What if Dean couldn’t even find something that was literally part of his own soul now? What if Cas and the baby died because of him?
“I know, Cas. I get that. Believe me, I…” Dean shook his head weakly. “I’ve done my fair share of lashing out and shutting people out when I don’t know how the
“I saw Gabriel.” Dean turned his head and saw Cas was looking down at his food. The angel swallowed once, even though there didn’t seem to be any food in his mouth. “I realized it was not truly him at some point, and that allowed me to break free.”
letting his voice waver under their weight. He just hoped Dean was tired enough, that his mind and thoughts were muddled enough so that the hunter wouldn't notice the fact that the angel wasn't being truthful.
Rowena sighed, leaning back in her chair once more. She tossed the plastic band back onto the table, shaking her head slowly as she pursed her lips, apparently taking a moment to organize her thoughts, or perhaps to figure out how to put whatever was on her mind in that moment into words—her
Haley didn’t seem amused by that at all—in fact, a determined, resolute look took over her eyes then, much to Dean’s surprise.
that came from deep within him without pause. He could only hope that Dean could not feel it too, but that seemed truly unlikely at this point
But apparently, the others didn't quite agree with him on that, especially Sam. In fact, not only did Sam still want to insist on spending nearly their every waking moment trying to translate the Book, but he also had a brand new, absolutely
He kneeled down before their bags, stuffing his worn clothes into his own bag as they weren't exactly dirty, before fetching the little box of prenatal vitamins and opening it with a click, because he should most likely take one now before he actually went to the kitchen to get some food. Sam and Charlie knew about the baby now, true, but it would still take a while until Dean actually felt comfortable enough to take his pregnancy vitamins in front of those two.
For a moment, though, Castiel did his best to ignore all that, choosing to hold on to the tiny sliver of hope that he still had inside of him as he crossed the room in a couple quick, hurried strides and hastily pulled open the closet.
The smell of the bacon frying on the pan made the hunter's stomach turn a few times, and there was actually a moment when Dean thought he would have to abandon the breakfast preparation in order to make a run for the bathroom, but fortunately it didn't get that far.
go back home, even if at this point, that was exactly what he wanted to do. In that moment, he just wanted to pack up all of his things again and take off toward Pontiac, to go back to his family, to have
Sam didn't really like the sound of that. They shouldn't be using Cas' Grace like this, not when it couldn't recharge afterwards, and especially not while the angel was still constantly fighting against the Mark.
Clearly, Castiel destroyed everything he touched. Every decision, every attempt he made to try and protect the people he cared about always seemed to backfire, always seemed to accomplish the exact opposite of what he’d intended.
A familiar yet very-much-unexpected sound suddenly reached the hunter’s ears—the one of big, heavy wings flapping through the air, announcing the arrival of an angel, which was both confusing and worrying, for several different reasons.
Her eyes zeroed in on him instantly, like she was checking if he was still awake, before she slipped the rest of the way out of the tent, zipping it back up to keep some warmth in and carefully making her way over to where Dean was currently sitting on one of those small, uncomfortable stools.
Dean frowned, surprised at the words, at the sudden change of tone in the conversation, but maybe he shouldn’t have been. It was Crowley, anyway, so he just brushed it off as he recalled how Cas had told him about Gabriel trying to reach the Cage, and ended up nodding lightly in acknowledgement, “Yeah, he tried to get to the Cage back when the whole thing with Cain went down.”
"It's me you want, isn't it?" Dean asked, interrupting his brother, his voice unexpectedly loud, cutting through the air without a warning, and everyone apart from Castiel seemed surprised by the sound of it. Slowly, Dean pushed Sam lightly to the side and out of the way with his free hand, taking a couple of tentative steps forward, sharp eyes measuring Hannah's and Afriel's reactions as he moved, probably to make sure they wouldn't harm Cas, as though testing the waters, as if trying to figure out just how much movement he could get away with. Afriel tensed up as Dean stepped forward, but she did not move from where she was standing. Her only reaction was her turning her head a bit so she could focus her attention on the pregnant human, though from where Castiel was, still kneeling on the ground, he couldn't quite see the expression on her face, so he wasn't sure how to read her. Castiel did not see Hannah's reaction either, but he noticed clearly as she tensed up behind him, though fortunately she made no movement to harm him.
go rabid, without even the smallest shred of self-control. And if even then you don’t feed, if starvation goes on for too long, your body will just shut down, but you won’t die.”
Time passed, and with every minute that ticked away Dean’s resolve slowly faded. Rowena’s words about how not simply anyone would be able to read the codex kept replaying in an endless loop inside his head, about how she might in fact be the only witch alive who might be able to do it, and he was slowly starting to believe those words, as much as he wanted not to.
He picked up a glass this time, working on it carefully, spinning it around in his hand as he worked on getting its inside nice and dry. “But Cas… I don’t know how much Sam told you, but he and I, we’re… connected.” He chanced a glance over at Jody as he let out that last word, and he was relieved not to find any surprise or confusion in her features.
"Then wouldn't it be good to make sure there isn't anything... well, lying around that might... make him remember, or trigger some memories? I mean, that could freak him out and all, right?"
, they... they gave us another injection each, which knocked all of us out. I... I think it was sedatives, or something. When we woke up, we were all here, in these cells, but we felt... awful. Groggy, and tired, like we were drugged—which I'm guessing is what happened."
“Then let Charlie and I go with you. You said you were in Montana, right? We can be there in two, three days tops, Dean.” It would be a little bit of a race, but Sam knew they could make it if he and Charlie took turns at driving and stepped down on the gas a little. Maybe they could fly there, it would be faster.
And this wasn’t a good place for this either, but it shouldn’t wait any longer. Dean shouldn’t even have decided to wait the first time, really.
The woman was frowning by that point, still looking a bit annoyed, her eyes narrowed. However, she didn’t immediately accuse him of lying again, of pretending that he didn’t know what was happening here, so that was something, at least.
“It’s…” Dean shook his head again, swallowing again, his breath coming in a little short. The room was still spinning, the burn of the Mark too insistent, the voices too loud, and as he looked around all he could think about was where they had hidden the Book. Maybe he could—
Gabriel swallowed visibly, looking away and out the window as he felt silent. He was actually quiet for so long that Dean convinced himself he wouldn’t get an answer; that he was just expecting the archangel to vanish at any second and leave the conversation at that.
He kept petting Juliet, happy for the distraction she was providing him with, even if that was definitely not enough to truly take all of his worry away. Even if he was smiling at her, even if he continued to pet her and chuckle at the sounds she was making, his mind was still far away, constantly thinking about how Sam, Cas and Charlie could get seriously hurt at any second, and how he had no way to help if that happened. His attention was still very much focused on the bond, hating the complete numbness he still felt coming from it and wondering if he would even be able to feel anything if Cas got hurt with the way the connection felt blocked again.
