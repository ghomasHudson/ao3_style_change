“In this too, you may find me of some assistance, Sherlock. Don’t give up hope.” Dr. Quentin smiled.
“This was outside when I came back from the bakery. We usually don’t get any post on Sundays, and it immediately felt wrong to me. Sherlock had already left, so I went inside, grabbed a pair of gloves, and brought it in, just as it was. The phone did not even move,” she explained.
Sherlock thought for a while and moved his foot around some. “Apparently, there isn’t much pain. I don’t think I need medicine. Thank you for waking me up.”
See, I happen to be a successful matchmaker; having previously set up my good friend, Owen with his beautiful wife, Christina, going on 25 years now. My friend and colleague, Sarah Sawyer and my good friend Arthur Gregson, married now for 5 years, and my own beautiful wife, Linda, who despite being way out of my league, by some miracle of luck, twenty years ago decided to give me a chance when I told her we were, to cite my daughter Mel ‘OTPs’. So you see, in reality we are celebrating my concise matchmaking abilities. The moment I lay eyes on John Watson, I knew he was The One for the madman who earlier that same day asked me who would ever want him for a flatmate. I kid you not when I tell you John poised the same question, in the same tone of voice, and I saw Sherlock clearly in my mind in that instant. These two men didn’t stand a chance. I brought them together for no one to tear apart." Mike gave a proud little bow and and moved his hands, prompting the guest to applaud and hoot for him.
John called emergency services and gave the man a more thorough check up. Definitely under the influence of something. He didn’t like that the man’s slurring got worse and his skin colder.
John felt terrible, but decided to go with the truth. “It’s very different with me…” He said, looking at the desk in front of him. “...she hates the flat. Hates what I make for dinner. Resents me trying to check or review her homework. Rosie never tells me what’s wrong. She doesn't talk about anything she does with Sherlock. She has even stopped calling me Dad.” John felt a knot in his throat. He looked decidedly at Ms.Lane, not wanting to see a smug look on Sherlock’s face.
John drank quite a lot and quite often after the Smith case closed, I believe mostly due to guilty feelings about the beating. Eventually, we were reunited, in great part due to Mrs. Hudson’s efforts. I suggested he come back home once it was better between us, and when he did, he tried to stop the drinking. He needed therapy for it. I too had to detox, and we went through it together, taking turns with Watson, who was just about two years old. We did have a lot of help, from Mrs. Hudson, my parents, Molly, the Stamfords. By the time Rosie turned three, we were back to work, sober and together.”
D.I. Harris took the lead and went straight to Sherlock. “Ah, Edward, did the doctor finally arrive? And does he seem at least minimally competent?” he asked, not bothering to look up.
“So it’s true!! You!! What the hell are you doing here, huh?" The coach’s eyes were bulging out of his face. “Come to ruin another woman’s job?”
The package did not have any post stamps, and was wrapped in gift paper. “Sherlock” was artistically written on the package with black ink and the burner phone on top of it. John understood what had raised Mrs Hudson’s suspicions. He also took some gloves and used them to feel the package. Whatever was in there was solid. He didn’t open the package, as it was addressed to Sherlock, but he couldn’t stop himself from picking up the phone. A run of the mill burner phone, with four digit password. John steeled himself and tried 221B. The phone opened. There was one number pre-programmed. Going out to the patio, he pressed the call button. It ringed three times on the other side before Moriarty picked it up.
Sherlock noticed that indeed everyone attending used clothes in the colors of the decorations. Harry, John’s Best Person had a beige tulle dress, long and fluffy, with a light blue top, deep v neck, and a camel colored jacket fitted perfectly her hair in a messy chignon.  Mycroft, Sherlock's best man, had a dark blue suit and a grey shirt. Rosie, Pepsi and Nyla had on blue green matching dresses with gray slashes and shoes. The men had light grey suits with different color shirts, and the ladies wore dresses or suits in the color scheme.
He turned right, remembering he had heard somewhere people tend to head in the direction of their dominant hand, and if he had, it hadn’t helped him at all. Not that the view was any better. He had apparently left Sex Worker’s’ Corner for Drug and Alcohol Street, where the men eyed him with hate and distrust. John tried to hold himself straight, but his shoulder wound was still painful, and the anxiety was making his leg even more uncooperative than usual. He knew that he looked even worse than he was feeling; an old man at 30, invalidated home, no family, no job, hospital issued cane, clothes from the second hand shop. The men fortunately lost interest in him, as he continued his straight line, hopefully out of there, towards… well, anywhere else, were there were lights, and buses, and people who didn’t want to sell him sex or drugs, or maybe see him dead.
John was at the clinic finishing up with a patient who had broken a toe and fractured her foot by dropping a hammer on it, when her husband had come home and greeted her loudly. “He startled me and I dropped the bloody mallet! I was an idiot to drop it! I’m so pissed off! I had a month to go in my job! I’m a school teacher. I’m up for summer school too, now I’ll have to tell them I can’t. Are you certain it’s broken? Can’t I just ice it?” Her eyes said they knew the truth.” John saw Sherlock, his poor badly healed foot.
“This person is quite younger than the rest of the missing veterans, though. And in the others no one noticed marks on the fingers.” Sherlock said, thinking aloud.
Even though the trip back was long and tiring, Rosie insisted they go to Bakers Street. Once there, they found out Sherlock wasn’t. Mrs. Hudson said that since Rosie hadn’t been in, he had decided to take a case for Mycroft and was working from there. “I’ll let him know you are back, love. He’ll pick you up on Thursday.” When Rosie went upstairs, to leave some presents she had bought for Sherlock, John tried to get some information
“No! NO!!! Why does it still have to be him! I’m so bloody tired of not getting over him!! He doesn’t want me! I’m never enough, always his last resort. He doesn’t prefer a male partner.” Sherlock snagged one of Luther’s cigarettes.
“John,” Sherlock bent to kiss his jaw, his neck, to sniff his hair. They stepped out of shoes and trousers and got on the bed, Sherlock failing to grasp on to John, who stopped to rid them both of socks, as Sherlock laughed. John always liked to feel his feet, cold as they were. Sherlock stood and lifted the covers, getting in the bed, going to his side. This time, he was ready. This time, he kissed John as he got in, and pulled him towards his body. This time, when John kissed him, his neck, his chest, Sherlock said “Yes”, he said “more”, he hummed at John’s lips, at his touch. “God, I want to do everything with you,” said John, releasing the nipple he was teasing.
“I love this act.” Sherlock heard a voice next to him. The young redhead was now sitting next to him at the bar, watching the dancers. “I’m Hal. I believe you asked my agency for me specifically, Mr. Holmes.”
“I just wanted to let you know I followed the advice you gave me at your brother’s wedding. Well I didn’t precisely call my partner, but we did get together when he came looking for me to NY. We have been together since. Our lives have changed. I’ve moved back to South America to be with him, and travel back to the states a couple of times a year, to continue with the work I have there. We started organizations in our country to help support lgtb youth and seniors. It’s been a whirlwind. Can I call him over?”
“Sherlock!" John laughed, “He looks just like you! He’s tall and lanky, look at the cheekbones, and the curls and the eyes!”
At Barts, Sherlock took the package and the phone. John relayed the conversation to him. “I couldn’t help it, Sherlock. I pretty much knew who it was…”
John had a couple of names for Lestrade. Michael Hopkins, Edward Taylor and Peter Williams; all had served in John’s unit and had tiger tattoos. His major suspect though not pale, dark eyed or Irish, was a LT Sebastian Moran, who had been accused of abusing local women under the guise of helping rebuild a local hospital. John had been one of three officers sitting in the panel of court members, at martial court. They had found him guilty of attempted murder and sexual misconduct. Earning him a dishonorable discharge. John had heard of his tiger tattoo, never seen it.
“Our family has gone through rough times this year. We have suffered through separation, loneliness, illness and sadness. But my fathers, they are magnificent people, who know how to make the best of not good situations. Now, we are stronger for it. We are all loved and cared for. We have each other.
“The thing is, Sherlock had been very busy with work on his off days, so it’s hard for us to get together. Rosie does seem to want both of us with her. She constantly takes my phone to contact him.”
Sherlock let out an exasperated breath, rolled his eyes and glared at his lover. “Fine,” he muttered. “Fuck me John. Please.”
“Not applicable. I am totally indifferent to whom John decides to have sex with. I just wanted to know your opinion.”
John bitterly regretted the fight. He had reduced himself to his pettiest, meanest form. The one he tried to vanquish, the one who had stayed in a sham marriage, without looking for a better option, neglected a daughter, and abused a best friend. He did not want to be that person ever again. Undeniably, Sherlock was as much Rosie’s dad as he was. Nothing would erase or equal the care Sherlock had given Rosie as a newborn. When Mary left, Rosie had never taken formula. Sherlock succeeded where Molly didn’t, helping her get used to the bottle, buying dozens of different formulas until he hit the jackpot with one she would drink. They hadn’t even been a couple yet. Sherlock was right, he probably knew more about Rosie’s thoughts, friendships and preferences than John did, and the love they had for each other was plain to see. They were both terrified that John would take away their visits. He had no intention to do so, he thought.
John looked up he saw Sherlock, watching him with such longing in his eyes and his breath hitching, and saw his own desire, badly concealed throughout the night, staring back at him. So even though John knew better, he knew he shouldn’t; he had walked out, he didn’t want this anymore, he even had a girlfriend now, but this...Sherlock was here, looking at him like this and John, he, he couldn’t see anything beyond the verdigris of his eyes and he wanted him so bad. John got up and went to him, where he was sitting, taking his head in his hands, brushing those soft, thick curls out of the way, pulling him to give him a kiss, that was not soft and tender. It was urgent, and hungry and wanting. Nobody, nobody had lips like Sherlock, and John licked, and sucked and kissed them like today was all they had. Then he pushed Sherlock’s head back and attacked his neck, and oh hadn’t John missed this long, creamy, vibrant neck now breaking out in goosebumps as John continued licking its length with a broad tongue, then sucking a mark on it, as Sherlock made the most delicious sounds, his fingers, like small embers, lighting up John’s skin, plucking his shirt out of his trousers. Sherlock was hard already, god, the man was so gorgeous. Sherlock tasted of whisky and cigarettes and sweat, reaching for John’s zipper, his strong hands all over John’s body, practically whimpering. “Bedroom.” John said. Sherlock stood, and caught John’s face in his hands, kissed him. “John, oh John”
One day, two days, three, falling asleep on his feet. His phone was dead. He spent time at the Yard, at Barts, he went to Lestrade’s. Wednesday evening had him considering how to negotiate the pick up on Thursday without talking to…
8 years, 7 months, 14 days. Oh well, things of more importance had ended without meeting the 10 year mark. He went home. That business was best left to the dark. Many users who recur after a bout of sobriety end up dead by overdose, having forgotten how much to dose. Something to keep in mind.
“Easy, I saw your dog tags as I knocked Strauss down. But that was secondary. I could tell you were army by your stance, the remains of your haircut, your army hospital issued cane. You were in Afghanistan, as proved by your tan, only on your hands and face, not extending down to your chest, and because your tan said either that or Iran, and when I said Afghanistan you did not correct me. Your limp is psychosomatic, as you forgot your cane and ran with me, your shoulder was shot through, limiting your range of movement. You came back to England not long ago, as your tan has not faded. You have little to no money, as proven by your clothes, old and worn, but obviously your best, as you used them to a successful interview to work at St Bartholomew’s hospital, most probably staying afterwards for a cuppa in the cafeteria with Stamford, smart chap of your same age, your childhood friend from good old Edinburgh.”
So Sherlock ended up going to Mrs. Hudson, to ask her for advice on how to behave, and what to talk about. Mrs. Hudson, of course, was delighted. “It will be so good for the girls!” Sherlock deeply regretted his offer, but he did feel bad about taking a night with Nyla away from her mom.
She listened to him, got up to get them each a bottle of ginger beer. “You looked really anxious tonight. I would have thought you’d be over the moon to be back with old man John. You looked anything but.”
“I can’t continue with the sex, Luther. I should have given myself time to relearn how to be by myself. That was the plan my therapist suggested. However, you proved to be too much of a temptation.” said Sherlock, quite truthfully.
Sherlock thanked the girls and went back to Mrs. Burns. “This seems like it could have been someone from inside. It is improbable that a fellow student has done this and remained quiet this long. Also the patience and research necessary to go through our ancient history, archives and John’s old blog, indicates maturity beyond the primary school skill set. This shows the characteristics of an act of revenge. You can ask her teachers if they have witnessed any falling outs between Rosie and a classmate. Though I doubt the revenge is towards Rosie herself.” Mrs Burns went immediately.
John took him by the hand to the fireplace, where a tray with strawberry champagne awaited them. “To my love, for tearing down a relationship in ruins and building a new one from the ashes.”
“Given. Given name. This is my real one. Really John, who names their daughter ‘Rosamund Mary? And I want to add Sherlock’s last name next to yours!”
On the third day,  Sherlock got a voice message  from an unknown number; a quiet whisper, “Sherlock...999R, please come! love you!”. He had been at Barts. One of the survivors was battling an overdose, of something that contained heroin and an element that seemed a pest poison. The other man did not have heroin or any other hard drug, there was evidence of corticosteroids, along with other substances he was working to identify. He had confirmed with Allan the mark he had found on the sole of his foot, was an injection site.   Upon receiving Rosie’s emergency call, Sherlock dropped everything and headed straight to the school. The assistant in the office told him they had called John trying to reach him several times to no avail. Sherlock’s own phone showed a couple lost calls he had received while on the way, when he had been busy giving Donovan directions to the school.
That was Luther. Luther was in his home, with his man. “It was a good place with a lovely view, Iyanna, I’m happy you are going to France. I believe you would also enjoy Portugal, Spain and Italy. They would fulfill your love of romance.”
Instead of the wedding march, the band played “Moon River”, the singer gave a heartfelt rendition, as the grooms walked down the aisle, Mycroft on mummy’s arm first, they stood at the edge of the aisle, until Greg came next, accompanied by his daughter. Mycroft kissed mum on the cheek, Greg kissed Tara‘s hand, then they faced each other, held hands and the ceremony began.
Alberto said, "We wanted to give you an open invitation to our hotel, any time you would like to visit the Isla de Las Tortugas. It is a Safe Harbor hotel, catering mostly to same sex couples and families. It will be our privilege to have you with us.”
John felt his blood run cold. Sherlock had never said “goodbye” to him. In all the time they had been together, not even when he left with his luggage and his daughter. This was the first time. It felt ominous.
“Hm. My hair is getting a bit too long. I suppose I can try a shorter look. Not sending pictures to your father, though. Sorry.”
“No! Don’t pull out! I...just need air.” Sherlock was pale and soft. John couldn’t kiss his lips as he would have liked, but kissed all reachable parts of him. “It’s alright if you need to stop. We can always try again,” John started.
“I’ll be the spy,” said Jackson. “Allison is OK at making nice, but everyone likes me!” Allison scowled, but the other two nodded.
“Well, I’m endeavoring to make the most out of the time we have together. I’m doing my best to function socially.”
“We had agreed on it though! I did think I saw something when James came to visit, but he had just had a spectacular breakup, and I didn’t have the heart to tell him about Sherlock and me.”
Sherlock bitterly regretted the fight. After it, when he could think again, (it had taken the better of three days. He had pushed everything back to tend to Watson.) he realized that while it was true he had raised Watson just as much as John had, Sherlock had no legal standing whatsoever to support it. The school documents, that had started the fight, had never had any legal validity in the first place. His time with Rosie was not court ordered, and therefore not law protected, it occurred solely because of John’s kindness. Now that Sherlock had offended and irritated him, there was no way to force John to let Sherlock have her three days a week if he changed his mind.
“It just doesn’t sound like Johnny! He never mentioned Sholto to me while you guys were together. Not once! Even though we did talk about our friends. He mentioned Mike, Bill, and Lestrade, Mostly we talked  about you guys. He did love you, and he would come to me for advice when things started going south. Not once did he mention having a pen pal.”
I played with her, bathed her, soothed her, made her sodding baby food from scratch! I took care of her at night when she was teething and you had no patience left for anything!  Mind you I had to learn as I did it, read up while she napped, while I was on public transportation. I was just as much a bloody mess as you were, a recovering addict, I had cravings and cramps, I was sick to my stomach, I was a wretched, trembling mess, and guilty for her being in that predicament in the first place, but I took my vow to her seriously and I alway have!”

“It’s not that I thought he didn’t want the responsibility. More like he would want to be sure it was the best for Rosie. He did ask me what would happen if I wanted to marry a woman. I had to assure him that will not be happening.” John said.
“Anxious when I saw him. Then we fell back into our familiar banter. About Rosie, the Yard, Barts. That was easy. I had to think to remain at a prudent distance. I kept sneaking closer to him. Then he talked about his trip to Cardiff, and I tensed up.”
“Oh I got the itches, real bad. The doctors just said it was the life. What with me smoking and that but I knew it wan’t just that. My arms looked like it had scales on em.”
It was better than John had imagined. He couldn’t stop smiling. The people at reception smiled in sympathy. Sherlock and Rossie went straight to the dogs. Not that they could enter, but they stood in front of the gates of their enclosure like moths in front of a lantern. They talked excitedly over each other, until John came to take them to their cabin.
“Maybe it's not all that John. Maybe Rosie just wanted to exaggerate. She has been teasing you lately.”
After a long time, John got up and checked the bedroom. Rosie was sleeping in the bed. Sherlock was sitting against her bed stand, slumping, his head against the bed frame, his long finger hooked with one of hers. John took a blanket and covered him up, not daring to wake him, and knowing he would hurt like hell next morning.
He had reluctantly accepted to come to Brighton with John for a weekend conference about the special needs of veterans in their health care. Though Sherlock would have been content to stay home with Watson, she had gone to Cardiff with Harry, for a holiday visit, as school was over. While John had to attend morning conferences, he had promised Sherlock time in the afternoon. Tomorrow evening, Sherlock was his plus one at a formal dinner. Boring, but needs must. John had gotten up and left for conference early, so Sherlock had gone in search of some coffee, only to be caught up in a discussion with a Dr. Colin Fazel, a supervisor at the Research Division of the Psychiatric Department of Oxford University, about how much say should a person be given in their own treatment, when mental illness or PTSD were involved.
Lidia had such a happy expression, her eyes watering up “Oh Sherlock!!” She said as she got up, pull him out of his seat next to John and gave him a hug. Sherlock, after a minute of going flat board stiff with surprise, gingerly patted her on the back.
Sherlock lay his chest over his back and lightly kissed his shoulders. “Oh my god, Sherlock, that is ama- aghh!” John shivered, and Sherlock, kissed his back, as he grabbed his arse, breathing accelerated. He turned John around and kissed him passionately, going down his neck, sucking at his nipples, and John had to work at not being loud enough to wake Rosie.
“Your soon to be colleague, Colin Fazel, was kind enough to inform me, complete with the fact that you already have a plan for commuting back and forth a week, and staying in Cheltenham for two while only coming to London on the weekends. Since I do not recall talking about this, I must understand I am not a part of this plan. Therefore, my time here is done, and I will be going back home immediately, once I can pack my things.”
Sherlock then took John to the bedroom. It was painted in deep blue John had said was comforting. The bed had a new mattress, there was a walk in closet now, big enough for John’s things. There was an empty window box up on the wall and a picture of the three of them, right before everything had gone wrong, on one of the night stands. The bathroom had ample space to put things away, an enormous rain shower head, a big bathtub, and a double sink. John saw, and he also observed. (“
Molly   sighed. “John, Sherlock hasn’t had a conversation with me that isn’t about work since you two broke up. He knows you and I talk. He has been to the morgue, Allen consulted with me the first couple of times, though it appears he hasn’t been totally horrible with him. Greg probably knows, though. Doesn’t he have dinner with Sherlock every week?” John blinked, not having known this. Every week? A day each week? Or more? Wasn’t that a little much? He and Lestrade only went out once a month, sometimes twice. He was dropping in on Sherlock every week? Now that they were both single? No, Lestrade and Sherlock, they weren’t ...NO.
“Lizbeth, it isn’t really Charlie who asked me. The only thing between us is friendship, the understanding that comes from living through similar situations, in this case, still feeling deeply for our exes. I’m conducting this investigation, to help her out.”
So now he was sitting in the fire escape, smoking, knowing that unwillingly, he had done it again, driven John away, when everything had been so delicate to begin with.
That day, Mrs Hudson had casually talked about Sherlock’s underground network and how often she had fed and sheltered them. She had contacts, she mentioned, to punish people who hurt her family, or dared to break her boy’s heart. This, John did not share with Sherlock.
Even more frustrating was the other note. "An alcoholic and a junkie", the note said. Harry was an alcoholic. But Rosie had never stayed with her when she was a baby. At that time she had not been doing well. She had to research what a ‘junkie’ was and found out it was a drug addict. She knew Sherlock had health issues, like when he got sick and stayed at Mycroft’s. Dad had been worried about him, ‘using’, she heard him ask Dr. Stamford. Sherlock couldn’t be a ‘junkie’ though, could he? He didn’t live on the streets.
“Yes, pending interviews. I will appreciate your company, John. The investigated person will not take well to me.”
Sherlock makes his decision, and does not regret it. His dislike for new people has been put aside for the moment. He definitely is benefiting from this friendship. New experiences and mini holidays tend to lift the spirits.  John is having trouble thinking about anyone else. His ex is so hard to find. People seem to know things John isn't aware of...
Rosie called him as he was gathering information about a suspect. She wanted him to procure thin carton boxes to make a school project. She had to make a model of her home for the following week. “We can work while I’m home. If it’s ok to stay in…”
“Not my school friends. But my neighbors, yeah. It’s like we were kind of shy with each other. I missed you guys, though. You are the best friends ever.”
As Sherlock looked over his shoulder at Rosie jumping enthusiastically with her friends, John saw a big man’s face illuminate with a smile. This was Jackson’s grandfather, a very tall, buff man. Dark skin, black hair cut very short, with some gray woven in it. Shiny eyes brimming with happiness. '‘Do I know him?’’ crossed his mind, thinking maybe he had seen him at school.
Sherlock saw only genuine concern for Rosie, so he gave her the basic facts. She told him she had no problem cleaning up.
“Not, shut up, let me finish. I called you a ‘friend’ when I shouldn’t have. I will not, any more. I will call you my partner, the father of my girl, my love.  There is one more title I want to give you, if you still find me worthy. William Sherlock Scott, will you marry me? I would be honored to call you  husband.”
John went to the loo, to get flannel to clean them up with, and a towel. Sherlock was already falling asleep. John thought the day must have been exhausting for him, with all the people and the ceremony and the dancing. He had done so well! John’s mind went through the wedding as he held his sleeping husband. Harry had been and looked superb. Meg had been a rock, helping him every step of the way. Mrs Hudson had been thrilled to be a witness, and Sherlock’s first dance. She had told him how Daddy Holmes had helped Sherlock calm down and make it to the wedding. Mycroft had found a way to pay for most of the arrangements, and John knew he had donated to the causes the River Boys supported. He and Greg had danced and entertained Mummy. Donovan looked happy for once, looking very beautiful, with her date, DI Rodriguez. He looked totally besotted. Dr Quentin and Dr Gates, had come together, arm in arm and danced, and drank, and at the end of the evening, Beverly’s head had been on Ian’s shoulder. That made John ridiculously happy. Everything made him ridiculously happy. The look on his husband’s eyes when he and the girls had danced down the aisle! Sherlock had danced. With everyone apparently!
“Isn’t it better than fighting? I mean, at least we can get along well enough for Rosie stuff. And the last couple of times we’ve been together, everything has been fine, or not?”
Sherlock was quietly amused. How could he have missed how much alike the two men were? As John remembered his manners and talked about his conference, Sherlock observed them. Same size, give or take an inch, similar build, similar expressions around the eyes. They were even wearing similar clothes. While John had a light green shirt and khaki shorts, Wilson had a brighter green polo, and khakis. Now they were companionably talking about the hospitals they worked in and how it ate up time with their kids.
“Yes I did. I’ve seen how worried you both have been about not ‘really’ being father and daughter. You were scared you didn’t have rights, that Rosie could be taken away. She was terrified when we were travelling to Cardiff. She was screaming ‘He’s taking me away from my dad!’ I knew you both deserved peace of mind.”
John was not liking this, and dreading the feelings building up in his body. The anxiety, the hollow feeling in his gut. “Did he say what the hurry was about?”
“You are not really helping, here, Molls?” said John, who didn’t need any reminders of that last horrible year and a half. Right now, he could only remember the good times, the times Sherlock had smiled proudly at his ideas, the times he had helped on cases, and the aftermath of solving them. John didn't want to stop thinking about how Sherlock was in bed, loving, passionate, undone. Then curled up, little spoon, or wrapped around him, like an octopus. ‘Move on’?. Here, in Molly’s cat hair covered apartment, with the knowledge that Sherlock was off doing he knew exactly what with a chocolate skinned Adonis, wrecking John’s heart and head, he knew he was going to fight to get Sherlock back. Back in his life, back in his home, back in his bed. Anywhere. Everywhere. But back in his life. Back with him and Rosie.
He almost made it, could see a big intersection some few blocks up, when he heard the indisputable sound of a fight. There was a low baritone speaking in a mocking tone, and two distinct voices with foreign accents growling back:
“Do you not understand the word irrational? What does it matter how much you talk, if when the bloke comes around, your lover totally blows you off? I would think you would understand about irrational given how insanely jealous you were of the Adler woman. And she was totally the wrong flavor for your man.”
“So after all that talk about the posh boys being fairies, you were just gagging for me? How did you even keep your schwanz in your pants, you groBer idiot?”
Mycroft had given Sherlock a couple of cases, boring, but with high level clients. One of the diplomats required information on his wife’s lover, whom seemed to be growing her bank accounts. The Diplomat wanted to make sure that his family’s estate and jewelry were not being compromised, and if so, he wanted his belongings back. Sherlock had entertained the hope the “lover” may be Adler, but of course, it wasn’t. The other case was a suspicion of espionage, even less interesting and easily solved. The money was good though, and Rosie needed to have a nest egg. Sherlock had gotten the information, and now went in the cafe, where Mycroft awaited, two slices of cake and two cups of tea
"You are very sexy, Doctor Watson.” Sherlock said and kissed him again, John settling in on Sherlock’s chest, both men falling asleep in the comfort of each other’s arms.
Towards the end, Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings came on, and Sherlock gasped and closed his eyes. Luther looked at the orchestra, but was distracted by a hitching breath. Tears were rolling down Sherlock’s cheeks. He did nothing to wipe them off. Luther grabbed one of his hands. Sherlock opened his eyes and smiled, tears still falling. Luther took out his handkerchief, dried his tears and held on tight to Sherlock’s hand. How could Watson have left him? After years of living with this amazing man, how could he have walked out?
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “John? What happened to Dad?”  He said “and yes of course I want the pictures. For visual documentation. Your project has a considerable level of difficulty. I’m impressed by it. You worked hard.”
-John. Couples in long term relationships or  marriages may separate or divorce. Separate is like a break, and divorced is broken up, parted ways permanently. Like we are. SH
“Sherlock, John, Dearest brothers; So as to get to the part where we dance, eat, drink and be merry, I have one word I want the two of you to hold on to: Stay. Stay in each other’s minds, hearts, and lives. Stay interested in how the other is feeling, in what he is passionate about. Stay in his thoughts, by his side, in his bed. Stay with one another. You both do best when you are together, and Rosalie and I have big plans for the future. Let’s raise our glasses and toast to love enduring! Cheers!”
“John, really, why don’t you just call him? Or go upstairs when you go to Baker Street? I mean, he does look well. He’s slim, but not overly so, I think, not that I’ve stared. He seems more...communicative lately. Like he is trying to be polite. Allen has commented on it. He was kind of scared something might come of it, but I think it's just Himself really trying to behave.”
Then I got married. To a woman. And oh, wouldn’t you have liked her! I was so used to your filth, I didn’t even  notice her lies, her need to control everything about me, her own sick brand of abuse. She almost killed my partner…” he stopped to breath. Passed a hand over his wet face. Breathed deeply to control his anger. “Even when I finally got together with him, raising my child with him, your ghost was there in my head telling me to put him in his place, to not let people know I loved him, that he made me less of a man on purpose. I ended up leaving him, to prove to him he couldn’t make it without me, sure that he would come and beg me to come back home. I almost lost him to another man. One very sure of himself. Very much a man. I knew then I had to get rid of you. For my own good. To raise my child the right way. So they could grow up knowing they are loved and respected, always. I have been putting in so much work, and you know what? My partner, who is the best man I ever knew, gave me one more chance. Therapy helped. Anger management helped. You could have done it for us too, you bastard, but you chose yourself instead. I have proven to myself that, faulty as I am, I Am Not You. I will be there for my family and I will love them and have the love of my beautiful, genius, very male partner. Together we are raising my child. And just as if you were alive, you will never know them, never know their names, because you are not worthy of them.
They grappled, as John ran to Stewart to perform a quick check on him. The officer was fine, but the suspect had Sherlock in a death grip. They tussled together, Sherlock heard John call out to him, but couldn’t do a thing. Felt the man push him, but clutched at him and they both fell off the roof. John screamed his name. The awning broke their fall, even as they broke it, Sherlock fell on the suspect who hit the side of a dumpster and then the floor. John came running towards them. The man got up, reaching into his pocket. Sherlock delivered a perfect right hook, under the man’s jaw and down he went. In his angst, John almost shot anyway, then saw the man go down, out cold. John then turned the suspect on his stomach, took a plastic tie from his pocket and secured his hands, then took the three steps that separated him from Sherlock, who looked at him with eyes wide open.
Dr Ian Quentin was almost giddy with relief to see Sherlock. He looked very well put together, his hair in well taken care of curls, he looked very fit, and was quite talkative. Sherlock had missed a couple of sessions, due to work, making it a month since he had last seen him. Dr Quentin had to admit he had missed his patient.
“He must have been furious,” said Sherlock with a little smile and appreciating eyes. “Unfortunately, that will not stop him, John.”
Sherlock’s face locked up at that. Harry took the conversation to the better, lighter way they were getting along now a days, though she saw clearly that Sherlock wasn’t able to trust John’s intentions. She really couldn’t see a solution, other than time and constant reassurance. Apparently, John was better aware these days and understood now that as much as he had always denied it, he too had been affected by their fathers’ homophobia. Also his lack of communication and his bad experiences with Mary, were a big part of their problems. John was working towards developing better skills. It remained to see if Sherlock could be patient enough
“Ok, good because Mycroft is beside himself with worry. He told me what you said to him. That you wanted to ‘overdose’. Not just to ‘use’, mind you, there is a big difference.”
For Sherlock, it was exhilarating, the case finally showing an opening! The suspect within reach! Young, strong, accomplice. The man looked frightened and insecure with the gun. Looking at Sherlock, hoping for a way out.
“I didn’t pick it up! Herndon did it! No! I just happened to stumble close to it Donovan! Well, you know that, because you seem to have a modicum of intelligence, Herndon will never realise it! Well you are Detective Inspector now, Donovan, if you have a more legitimate way to obtain evidence against the murderer, then by all means, get rid of this, but if not, it stays between you and I. And I’m busy starting now, so don’t call again!”
On his way out of the office, the woman presented him with a bag containing two clean vests, and gave him the room number. He took them and hurried.
The boys have had a looong journey to get here. Frustration, fights, separation. Each took a different route, but they learned from their mistakes, and from each other. They had friends along the way. Both of them confronted their problems and  worked to make things better. They are at a place they didn't dare hope they would be a year ago. Now they are a family, together in their home, better prepared and disposed for what life has in store for them. The two of them, always.
“Well, your ‘minimal time’ has had an effect on their lives. You have made a difference for them, Sherlock, and for Rosalie, and for me, love. You are important, you are loved and cherished. I felt so happy to see them with you, Sherlock.”
Rosie said, looking into John’s eyes, very satisfied with herself; “Don’t worry Meg, John knows this is my hair. I can cut it as I like. If he doesn't, that's alright. We all have to be ok with things we don’t like, don’t we.” With that, she skipped away to open up food bags, while Harry laughed until her stomach hurt. “ If she’s like this now, I don’t want to see the hell she’ll give you when she’s a teen!”
“No, only that it’s my day with her, and things always seem to come up on our days. I’m sure it seems the same to Lizbeth, too, but ….”
“So, Rosie’s dress is here. The headpiece in the box. Check that you are taking her shoes. It cost us blood, sweat and tears to find the precise color that did not hurt Herself’s precious ankles. I made Rosie’s bag for Nice. You don’t forget your beach things. I will catch up.” He looked at his detective, who wasn’t sulking, or pouting, or fighting. Instead, he was a little pale, and looked a lot unhappy. “Sherlock?"
They analysed different plans for taking care of executive functions for himself, finding a good combination of charts, calendars and apps to help him keep track of self care, caring for Rosie for his home and his finances by himself, as a way of being more independent.
“I didn’t say anything about meeting new guy and you didn’t lose Sherlock, you left him! You had your reasons John. You were hurt today, it’s obvious, but there were reasons for you leaving! Don’t you remember? Sherlock was always working. All the time. He ignored your calls, and never answered your texts. You wouldn’t know who he was working with and where he was? Remember he even worked overnight? You constantly called Greg and had sometimes had to call half of London to find him. And when you tried to talk about it he wouldn’t, he just sulked, and if Rosie wasn’t there he would break things and yell at you!! You do remember that three night case he took? He never communicated with anyone for the duration. You were going out of your mind!! All those sleepless nights, John. It’s not as if you just up and left him! Don’t forget that!“ Molly saw John had reached for the bottle again. She had lost count. Was that drink three, or four? Bloody hell, three fourths of the bottle was already gone.
“He kept the offer to himself though. He took me to that conference and let me be humiliated because I had no idea. I wouldn’t want that to ever happen to my daughter.”
There was a moment of silence, as the two looked at each other. John was amazed at what he saw. A young man, couldn’t be older than 20, in a white t-shirt that floated about him and jeans that had seen better days ages ago, rail thin arms, full of track marks. Eerie, beautiful eyes, ringed with blue, green and yellow, dilated, as their owner was high as a kite.
Harry showed me how much I was becoming something I hated, treating you at times the way Mary used to treat me. Sherlock, I have learned my lesson. Please know that my attempt to leave you and move on were misguided failures. I intend to be in your life from now on, in any form you want me: co-parent, friend, partner… everything, Sherlock. I will not be shying away from showing what I feel for you anymore and I will not leave again.”
Charlie, Mike and Harry tried to convince Sherlock to buy a suit for his wedding. The man refused. It took Molly, with all her considerable girth, coming over to Baker Street to get him to reconsider.
“Yeah, you could be…” said Nyla, “...but in this group, no one would believe you would skip out on the Rose. The two of you are inseparable.”
As a response, Sherlock took the lube, made sure Luther lay down on the bed, got up on his knees, one on each of Luther’s sides, and prepared himself, slicking his fingers, introducing them into his hole and fucking himself, deliberately provocative, making sure Luther looked, putting up a good show for the man. One, two, fingers, slowly and sensually in and out, as his other hand touched his own nipples, stroke his cock, Luther was close to drooling, holding himself up on his elbows, his cock fully hard and leaking. Once Sherlock felt ready, he took the lead, pushed Luther on his back on the bed. He took the man’s cock, slowly, covering it with slick, then covering his hand and circling his rim with it. Luther growled, Sherlock laughed. He lowered himself onto Luther’s cock. This was what they excelled at, this lustful, playful sex, that never failed to wipe-out Sherlock’s mind, while turning on every nerve, bringing forth sensations he had given up on since his breakup with...Oh! Eventually, he started moving, just enough to tease Luther, making sure he touched himself, too, going on with the show.
Beverly caught the word: “What makes you think Sherlock is manipulating you? Was that typical of him?”
“So O’Keilie, you went from working for children to threatening them in such a short period of time. What was your thought process for such a plan?”
John looked at Sherlock’s face for a minute, not understanding. Then he looked down at his shoe. It was torn, ripped, destroyed. “The one they broke in Colombia?” Sherlock had shared few details of his time away. He had mentioned that his torturers in *Colombia had broken his foot. No further details had been asked for, or provided. Now, John thought this must have been one of the more traumatic experiences, given the near panicky tone of Sherlock’s voice. Sherlock nodded his head in answer, apparently unable to talk. Not good.
John had noticed Bill had a clean shaved face, had grown his hair a bit, and now used bespoke suits. His shirt fit him quite snuggly too. In all, he could understand why Molly was impressed, but he would always prefer the original. As the evening progressed, John scooted closer to Sherlock, making sure their legs touched.
John had relayed to the first responders that opiates should be avoided when possible and that Sherlock had a paradoxical response to common anesthesia and the most popular tranquilizers. He had provided them with a list he had put in his phone, made with information gathered during their evening talks. Once they got to the hospital, John reminded Sherlock he would be waiting for him, and the most he probably needed was a check of his oxygen levels, stitches and a clean up.
“Yeah some, also about you. Mostly though nowadays, how to get through boring social gatherings, and where Mummy keeps the good liquor. Also how to be in Daddy’s good graces.”
Then, on their last day, someone takes their sweet old neighbor's bag.  What starts as a robbery quickly becomes something worse, John's quick thinking allows him to stay close to Sherlock.  Who is this person? How does he know Sherlock? How does he know John? WHAT??
“Well then John, everything sounds good. How about we meet on the 15th and talk about family interaction? As always, don’t hesitate to call if you need to.”
. Without them, this story would still be unfinished and unpublished. All mistakes are mine, as is the restructuring of chapters. Thank you to all my readers and commenters who are making this one of the most fulfilling experiences! Please note there is mention of drugs, and suicidal ideation in this chapter. Feel free to pm me if you need a bit more info.
He went to the loo and as he cleaned his teeth, the idea of finally calling out John’s name while actually with John made him laugh. He was trying to control it as he brought wipes and a towel over to clean John, who seemed blissfully passed out. Sherlock cleaned him up, disposed of the waste, brought over two glasses of water. Then he went back to bed, took off the dirtied sheets and covered them up with the cover. John cuddled up on Sherlock’s chest.
John, in doctor mode, applied local anesthesia, cared for the gash, treated the new wound and wrapped it: “You will need a course of antibiotics. When there is a wound, it must always be cleaned, Sherlock. No matter if the cleansing hurts, or if the wound stings. Once  it’s cleaned it can be wrapped up. Then you can concentrate on healing. If you don’t tend to it, the stuff inside will get you an infection and it’s harder to get everything out.”
John put Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissed it. Then he ran towards the ocean, pulling him along. “Last one in is a rotten egg!!” said John and ran faster.
Sherlock’s eyes just filled with tears. Happy tears. Harry danced away, and John took Sherlock’s hand and they just started dancing. Friends and family cheered. Stood up in their seats and danced and clapped along. The girls let go blue and silver balloons.
John looked inside, his heart picking up speed, a smile spreading on his face. The flat looked enormous. There was the sitting room, the evidence wall, now peppered with Rosie’s schedules, pictures, and projects due. There was the fireplace, and his dear red armchair, and Sherlock’s across from it, as if he had never left. There was their sofa and the telly.
for their help with the story, their reviews of this chapter, the hand holding and the tough love through my "should I/ shouldn't I" I went through about posting.
A crass description of acts that could only be performed with a woman. There were also pictures. Selfies of the two of them at some restaurant. She wore a blue dress that looked painted on, a deep V and a ton of eye liner, her head on John’s shoulder, squeezed together. The woman holding John’s head and kissing his cheek. John was smiling. Another picture; Gianna in lingerie, winking at the camera; young, beautiful, curves in all the right places, small hands, long hair. There were more. Sherlock stopped himself from looking. John’s girlfriend. His new lover. The realization hit him like a bucket of cold water. What was he doing here?
“While I must admit I have by force gotten used to lower cases and cold cases. I still can’t see myself retired, waiting for John to go back and forth from Coswell."
Sherlock had a question he wanted a sincere answer for, so he decided not to tease for today. Instead;
Luther took the trousers off reverently, like someone fulfilling a long held wish, like someone unwrapping a Christmas present; “Oh baby you are perfect!” He undressed much quicker.
John sighed. “Sherlock, the man lay his hands on you. He called the smartest man alive a freak. He spoke about your private life. Insulted you! You are brilliant and beautiful. You can have your pick of lovers and companions. Just look at Luther! You are not alone and will never be. That he dared say I ‘threw you out’!”
“It’s alright Lestrade. I was crushed for a bit I’ll admit it, but I got sober, and we started collaborating. Eventually, I met John, and that was it. I just want to know; can I call you Greg now?” asked Sherlock." grinning.
As he listened to him talk about criminals, and finding clues, and how to hide in plain sight, John took the time to really look at Sherlock. He doubted he had ever seen a more beautiful human being, and he had honored his lady’s man title of “Three Continents Watson” extensively. Although, lately there had been none of that. He had never been attracted to men, or never attracted enough to do something about it.  Harry was the gay member of the family, and she had been out since she was a teen. There had been something with his superior officer in the army, but never anything physical. So why did this young man before him… enchant him so much? Why did he feel as if he couldn't bare to leave him? Obviously homeless, obviously a junkie. Yet there was something unmistakably… posh about him. Beautiful, evidently, but a beautiful disaster. So different from any other person he knew. John licked his lips looking at the man’s pink, pointy upper lip, the full, bottom one. He cleared his voice, and tried to keep up his end of the conversation.
Sherlock was most definitely alarmed by that; “John, you’re not - you don’t have - we don’t have to do...”
He handed the things in a plastic evidence bag to Sherlock. John handed him a smaller bag, with the papers and receipts he had collected. “Some of these look like sketches.”
“Don’t call me Greg, don’t you ever call me Greg. I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade to the likes of you.’ Yeah,  I remember. You ran off. I felt like an arse for saying it like that mate. Especially since you disappeared after. I even hoped you’d been high and forgot it. You came back after rehab sober, changed, distant. But Sherlock, I...couldn’t. From the moment we met, I felt protective of you. I saw you as a youth that had no one to take care of him. I couldn’t have done any of that with you.”
As a response, Sherlock smiled, kissed Mrs. Hudson and was off upstairs, to change for his date. John picked up the mess of papers, and looked for a place to put the files.
“I thought so, Gregory also picked it. Thank you for the cases brother, I’m happy you are up to your usual speed.”
“I’m free from pretending to be someone I wasn’t. Sherlock, therapy has helped, but the most jarring experience for me has been missing you. That made me reconsider my actions and my reactions. I see you now, working on being a better father, on being healthier and you make me want to be those things too. I want to know more, to be able to do things in better ways and to know what you need of me.  I want to deserve another chance with you.”
-The tear is big, the trainers have been rendered useless and we came back to your flat to look for her bee ones. Where are they, do you know? SH
John came to them then, saying “Hullo.” and placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. The man’s demeanor didn’t change.
Then Sherlock put his hands in John’s hair and pulled his head towards him, kissed him, a lustful, hot joining of lips, with Sherlock’s tongue parting his lips, his hand at the nape of the doctor’s neck. He sucked at the jawline, and the neck, where he placed a small, hard bite. Sherlock turned John around, his hands on John’s shoulders, all over his chest and his belly, fingers in his belly button making him laugh. Then his hands went to the ribs, and the hips.
“John, I missed you. I missed you terribly.” He said, his voice not as steady as he hoped. John stopped, but didn’t turn around.
“Which brings us to our present, Sherlock.” said Mummy, “though I admit it was Dad’s idea. I would have gone with some nice glassware.”
John fumed well into the evening. Sherlock was always professional, never slipped at work, they didn’t even hold hands. Yet he got outed, always sneered at, made fun of. John wasn’t even with him anymore and still heard it. Sherlock pretended to not be affected, to not care. Who would stand up for him now?
“Ah, thanks Mike, who has conveniently forgotten, we are exactly the same age.”  John cleared his voice and took a deep breath. “Sherlock. You made your vow to me and to our daughter years ago. Although it was a short one, one sentence, it was the most meaningful one you could have made, and though in pledging it, you put your own life in danger again and again, you have honored it every single day of our lives. You have always been here. For Rosalie, since she was a newborn, bringing her up, teaching her, playing with her, adopting her. For me, coming back for me, planning my wedding for me, living for me, letting me go, and taking me back home. You sacrificed yourself in so many ways. You have given so much of yourself to us.
“Yes, Luther. Nice young man, he is. He met Sherlock at a club where he is a DJ, he told me. Sherlock goes dancing there to meet up with him. Good old fashioned manners. A gentleman. One can tell he is very well educated.”
John saw Sherlock’s closed expression and his clenched fist, lightly bumping his thigh. Not the way he wanted this to go. He couldn’t change the topic without the genius being on to him. He tried to sound conciliatory, “I never said Greg had anything to be embarrassed about. It’s just, if it weren’t for that stripper, the night of the party, I wouldn’t have known anything was going on. I’m happy for them. Whirlwind romance, then. Both families already on board.”’
The tube ride was hell. The changing of lines, the people, the noise, the smells. His mood, bad to begin with, was black now. He almost went up the steps, then measured how angry he felt against how stupid he could get, and decided to knock on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
“How is Harry? And...Clara?” He said, his smile as beautiful as ever, but it didn’t come close to reaching his eyes.
Once out of city limits, Sherlock sprung up, digging his thumbs in the driver’s eyes. Instead of spiraling out of control, the driver slowed down, and when Sherlock threw himself on the bench, the man opened the door, as John approached. The driver slid out, Sherlock on him instantly, ripping half his shirt off. The kidnapper arched his body, smoothly flipping Sherlock over his shoulder. The next instant, he held him captive, strangling Sherlock with one arm, his other hand now holding a box cutter to his throat. As Sherlock remained struggling for air, John approached slowly, gun in hand, saying, “Let him breathe, Let him go, and I will let you live. I’m an Army Captain, a crack shot, and I will shoot you.” The fact that his heart was racing, and fear for Sherlock tied his stomach in knots, would have never been perceived by an outsider.
“It’s not conspiring when people get together to give a common present, Sherlock.” said Mrs. Hudson, as she gave him a gift of two thick tomes of  “The Beekeeper’s Manual”.
Greg’s three children were to participate in the ceremony; his two boys, standing at his side, Todd, the best man, Mack’s little boy carrying the rings. Tara, who had danced with Sherlock at Greg’s retirement party, would be the one giving him away, Mummy would do for Mycroft. Sherlock showed them around the estate, sharing stories about his working relationship with Lestrade and the antics he had witnessed at the Yard. Tara wanted to know about cases Lestrade had actually solved, and Sherlock was able to cite quite a few, plus some where they had collaborated closely, to pass the time. In all, by the time he brought them back to the main house, Greg and Mycroft were there and he happily passed the Lestrades on. Then, he went to take a look at the bees with Watson.
Sherlock was surprised. All of the hours playing Karaoke made sense now. The imp had kept this to herself. John, sitting next to him, looked absolutely happy. The bloody sod had known. There was his girl, looking ravishing in a new yellow dress with black lace and black shoes. Little Bee. She looked so nervous, waving hello and taking a bow. Ms. Landon took her place at the piano, and Mr. Rubens, the year 5 teacher, had a cello. Ms. Ruiz had a guitar. Pepsi and Nyla, in similar dresses, stood behind her at a distance, the background singers.
“John doesn’t think so. He keeps cringing in the mornings when he sees me.” she said smiling. “But Sherlock. Are you sick? You look tired.”
“Unfortunately, I have to see the foot to fit the shoe…”  He said, smiling a little when Sherlock reacted with a puzzled look and a nose crinkle. “...I must know your history, your diagnosis and the issues that have led you to your current situation. If there are any professional files, you feel may help me with that, we can have them transferred. There will be topics we must talk about, so that I can find patterns of behaviors, both efficient and not, so that we can analyse their results and consider valid alternatives for what is not producing the results you seek.”
