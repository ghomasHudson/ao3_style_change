Completely bare and vulnerable and out for Sherlock's eyes to peruse completely for the very first time, Sherlock is about to remove every single one of John's pieces of clothing, naked as the day he was born, nude in front of his partner for the very first time and this.
Mike's eyes darkened. "Don't play dumb. You go see him for hours every Friday night, come home with a slaphappy grin on your face every time like you're some kind of smitten girl. What, does he just have you bent over his desk for all that time?"
His voice has changed from shock to smug recognition and Sherlock turns to find a smirk plastered on his face.
He forced himself to focus, trying to sort out all the new information. Link's words replayed in his mind again and then he frowned, looking sharply over at Link. "What were you doing at Mad Marty's?"
"Oh god, Sherlock, fuck," John moans and Sherlock has to kiss him, has to pull him close and let John push him into the sheets and envelope him in heat and passion and bliss, tasting the curses and his own name in John's mouth and it is
Lestrade is on them immediately, mouth open to begin spouting information, but he falters at the sight of John trailing behind.
"Dorm," Sherlock shifts his book bag on his shoulder from where he has the strap gripped in his hand, attempting to not make it obvious he'd been just about to race home in time to meet John for dinner.
And just as he's about to give into the impulse, Sherlock's spine snaps straight, jutting his chin out, cool mask falling back over his features, closing himself off entirely to any advance John may have been considering making. Sherlock practically spits, "You'd do well to remember that, John. I don't have
But he put on the show for show's sake, trying to remind himself of what Sherlock's mother had said. Victoria had said it was for a case. A business trip.
Snapping his head up so hard it hurts a bit, John finds three sets of eyes boring into him intently, Paul, Mike and Greg all blinking at him, each stare looking somewhere between worried and annoyed.
Sherlock doesn't dare respond seeing as his retort would be that Mycroft was a poncy bastard for needing his boyfriend to shower because if Sherlock had a boyfriend and that boyfriend was John Watson, Sherlock would never
"Well, I am a human being, John," Sherlock replied, pursing his lips to keep from laughing. "I do smile and laugh on occasion."
"Jesus, Sherlock," he groans as his orgasm crashes over him. He rides out against Sherlock's hands, moaning softly as his hips shake and stutter to a stop. He glances up to find bewildered eyes looking back at him.
"My apologies," the man replied insincerely. "I thought the rugby captain would be prepared for someone simply speaking to him."
"Maybe we should get a drink?" Mike squeaked beside him, and again John became annoyed. His normally boisterous, friendly, loud, borderline obnoxious best friend was acting fucking bizarre.
And then there is John standing on the other side of the threshold, all dressed up in a dark blue button-down and navy jeans, looking the most put together that Sherlock has ever seen and the most bloody beautiful and all thoughts of discussing this away go right out the window as Sherlock's mouth fills with saliva and
Frowning, John takes a step back from his clearly furious roommate. "I-what? No." Mycroft? Where the hell did that come from?
It's gloomy out today which means John will want something warm for dinner, which means he'll put on his softest sweatpants and thickest sweater and curl up cozily on his bed while he laughs and smiles and asks Sherlock all about his day over a hot dish of food.
The boy who's breathing goes a bit ragged and he clings a bit harder to Sherlock still standing in the doorway, fingers digging into Sherlock's back but the curly-haired boy pretends not to notice, simply holding John steady and comforting him as best he can, grateful to be the one to do this for John Watson. "I know," he murmurs into blonde hair, because he does know, he knows
, he mused. However, his flatmate was nowhere to be found. John worried at his lip, feeling exposed out in the open like this, knowing if Sherlock spotted him before John could find him, he'd be in deep shit.
He'd caused himself most of this pain, he knew. He should have been smarter about all of this. He should have known immediately that John was different and should have given in at the very beginning. He should have known he would only create a mess, hurting himself and John. He should have known that things in his life never resolved themselves when ignored. They simply gained traction, becoming bigger and more complicated until things are so out of control that someone is getting wasted, punched and almost raped in a dark alleyway.
And then he'd watched as John had gone to the bar for his friend's drink, stayed by his side even when he was irritating him, never once drifting away to go find more interesting people to talk to. He was loyal. And clearly very stupid for missing all the signs Mike was throwing his way.
Sherlock looks up at John from where he's wrapping Dolly's reigns around the tree in their usual spot.
Sherlock stroked a long pull up John's length with his hand, licking at the slit. "I'm glad you appreciate them."
Sherlock had walked him to the door, locked it behind him, then promptly stripped off his clothing, and practically dove into the shower, wrapping his hand around his cock and stroking vigorously, still feeling John's hands on his hips and soft whimpers against his lips. He moaned out loud, wishing more than anything he were inside John's body and not his own fist. A ripple of pleasure tore through him as he considered the possibility that John was on his way home right at this very moment to do the exact thing Sherlock was in the middle of. The thought of John touching himself while thinking of Sherlock made his cock spasm and he came, picturing John laying on his bed with his hand down his pants, whimpering Sherlock's name.
John closed his eyes, praying to god he wasn't about to wake up. "What?" he whispered hoarsely, his body trembling with the closeness of Sherlock and the heat of his words in his ear.
John's eyes narrowed. "I'm ready." He would have sounded convincingly angry if the hint of hesitation hadn't snuck in at the last syllable.
"Nah, go on, rookie," Greg replies with a roll of his eyes before scanning to crowd of blokes up for the picking.
"Come in," John says hurriedly like he's only just realizing he hadn't invited Sherlock into his room, which Sherlock's guess is he hadn't. He follows in far enough for the door to close behind him and then John is in his arms again, cuddling as close as possible and Sherlock takes him back in with open arms, feeling equally clingy and a little needy and very grateful that the sentiment is returned so he feels no shame in it.
Which John truly cannot understand. Sure, he's a bit different but he's also incredibly interesting. Why anyone wouldn't want to spend time with him is really beyond John.
they're alone and warm, the only light coming from the lights stringed up along Sherlock's window. He reaches for John again as the door closes, attempting to close the distance between them again, unable to stay away for too long from his now-boyfriend.
"I better see you back in my bed this evening, Mister Holmes," John teases with only a hint of an edge, pressing his palms flat against the door on either side of Sherlock's head and ghosting his lips along Sherlock's as he speaks. "Don't be getting any ideas about going back to that mattress of yours."
John nodded. "Good." He laid his head on Sherlock's shoulder and sighed. "You're the best thing in my life. Thank you for introducing me to your family."
John Watson is a Year 13, Sherlock has learned since their meeting. John moved here at the end of last school year. John has sparkling eyes and rides a Bonneville 3000 and has the love of all the girls in school. He seems obviously attractive. He seems quite smug. He seems like he should be boring.
It wasn't a sharp or searing pain, but a hollowing, aching feeling. Like someone had gone into his chest without permission and removed a rather large chunk of his heart, leaving behind a gaping hole and an emptying feeling in his gut.
Sherlock tenses. "Why did you leave?" he murmurs. He should clarify but he can't. He can't bring himself to ask John why he chose to leave him to run off to a warzone.
rugby uniform; there is never a John Watson Sherlock wouldn't fully accept and curl into and snog senseless. Not a single one.
They walk through the house, Sherlock doing his best to remain interesting. He needs to impress John. He needs to show him he's got things to offer. He needs to prove himself.
-perfect cock-sucking lips, Sherlock," John managed to bite back, though the words held less venom and more pleasure. Christ, Sherlock was right. He did need this. And Sherlock was fucking
How could he be so stupid? How could he not know it was all just a game? Just a tease. Just having a laugh. Get the geek all riled up. Make him think he's special. Make him think someone wants him.
A thought scurried across his mind and John pulled back sharply to look Sherlock in the eye. "But no more being nice to Victor. I'm serious about this. Be mean to him. All the time. Whenever possible."
Sherlock is gasping for air, grinding his pelvis back against John's, the friction making his body thrum. He drops his head forward, shaking, and John captures his lips.
Victor's hand abruptly falls away from Sherlock's shoulder at the sharpness of the voice behind them.
Christ, that was lame but John can't bring himself to care even as a prick of uncertainty pings the base of his skull.
," Sherlock grumbles, fumbling with his keys in his pocket as they enter his building. He'd sort of hoped there was something more obvious, something in the way he dressed or his hair or his behavior that tipped off his sexuality to people so he could actively
"Great," Sherlock nods once succinctly, hoping that's the end of it and breathing a sigh of relief as Victor starts walking backward.
He rocks his hips a bit more insistently, the angle much easier to nudge that sensitive spot inside him, and he groans. John thrusts his hips up to meet his slide down and Sherlock cries out loudly at the sudden rush of sparks that shoot through his body.
Sherlock swallows hard. The reminder alone hurts him so much. "Um...I'm actually not going with-with John," he mumbles.
John loves to smudge the lines between sexy and sweet, murmuring love while fucking Sherlock into the mattress, whispering how badly he wants to suck him off while holding his hand on a busy street. It's something Sherlock adores, never knowing these were things he craved until John gave them to him. It keeps him on his toes. It keeps things so bloody exciting.
"Please?" Greg requests with a grin, grabbing an order form and sliding it across the unbearably pink tablecloth and tapping his finger against it. "It's for a good cause!"
"Okay, fine," Sherlock grants, holding a hand up to halt his roommate's movements, the very real threat of what is practically a swamp lingering behind him. "I concede. You win."
He tried to argue. He tried to fight back through to consciousness. He tried to move his body and open his eyes and pay attention. He didn't want to miss out on sex with Sherlock!
"I thought you said you could dance," John murmurs in his ear, clocking the redness racing up Sherlock's neck to his cheeks as John rolls against him once more.
"Again, I didn't know you were going to take that seriously," Sherlock mutters, bitter knot loosening ever so slightly. "But… but we…" he flounders for another argument for a moment before snapping his fingers. "But we haven't kissed! Couples kiss. And have sex. We haven't had sex either." Feeling quite smug for recalling another issue with their supposed relationship, Sherlock crosses his arms and smirks down at the blond boy.
Sherlock continued to sway, grind and melt on the stage, dropping to the floor and gyrating across the wood, every movement sensual and smooth, like he was made to move like this. He dropped his hands to his belt buckle and glanced up through his lashes at the audience innocently. The men cheered for him to do it but he shook his head, spinning backward and dropping his hips to floor. He left his trousers on, but it didn't stop the crowd from begging him to take them off. He threw a coy smile as the music came to a stop and his hips gave one more pop as he froze on his knees.
"Okay, how about you go indulge your sulk for a bit and then we can go grab a pint. I'll tell you all about my weekend and you can drown your sorrows. What do you say?"
"No, Sherlock," John glowered at him. "I want to go. To keep you from doing something stupid. You can't keep doing these things. You have to be smart."
"I guess Molly goes to school with him," Greg replies with a shrug. "She said he's uh… intense I guess? Smart as shit apparently."
Turning just in time to see her partner in crime schooling his features, Sherlock watches as Greg nods sympathetically at Molly and places a hand on her back as though to comfort her. "That would be really good, Molls," he agrees softly with a gentle pat. "Hopefully we'll make enough for that."
"He's a brilliant bloke," Mike had told him during one of their many classes after John had already stupidly moved in to the Baker Street flat, convincing himself it was because the flat was perfect and the location ideal, not because of the sexy man that already occupied one of the bedrooms. "Don't let the theatrics fool you."
Dropping his bag on the floor beside him and plopping down onto the cushions, the genius takes a deep steadying breath in an attempt to calm his angrily pounding heart, letting it out through his nose, hoping to center himself and ignore the darkly swirling cloud twisting his thoughts round and round. He's no longer alone, and he can't be stuck in his head while he's trying to tutor for godsake. He exhales once more and runs a hand through his hair, before attempting to plaster on some sort of pleasant look and turns his face up to his Chemistry partner.
Sherlock looked a bit unsure of himself, shifting his weight to his other foot and looking around at anything besides John. "See you, uh, next week then?"
"Oi, mate, you alright?" A voice broke into his silent panic attack and John looked up to find the bartender looking at him with concern.
He slips on his shoes and makes his way back to the kitchen as John is pouring his now scrambled eggs onto a plate. "Case," he says, raising his phone.
when you still lived there. But then again... they didn't know they have two gay kids then, did they?"
surprised by his behavior," Sherlock replies coolly with a raised brow. "You choose to date that vile human being, don't you know by now who and what he is? It can't honestly be that shocking that he would pull such a stunt and-"
"Absolutely," John laughed and stood, offering Sherlock his hand. "Come on. I want to see the rest of your house. And maybe go see your mother again. I might love her a little bit. Maybe even more than I love you."
He's getting really sick and tired of people attempting to get into his business. Particularly because there is no business to get into. First, his stupid older brother showing up last weekend to scold and lecture him on the topics of drinking alcohol and coercion, and later onto cautions of 'reckless youths' and, of all things, Victor Trevor whom Mycroft seemed to believe was somehow the reason for everything that had happened at the party. He hadn't been quite as crass as Irene in his concerns but he had given an earful on distrustful teenagers and the only thought on said teenager's minds.
over in his fitted jumper and his tight jeans and his sodding grin that could light up the entire university campus. "
Sherlock collapses against the bed, and John follows him down, cock still tucked inside him, both of them breathing heavily.
He bites the corner of his bottom lip, fighting the curve of his mouth but it's no use. He reaches out and tucks a finger under John's chin, tilting his head back up to meet his gaze. Those blue eyes catch his own green and soften from worry to affection in the span of one heartbeat, glowing with such tenderness Sherlock has to reach over and lay a kiss on that soft mouth. "I like you so much," he murmurs, the words slipping free before he can process how simple they sound, but John doesn't seem to care that the sentiment is primary school and instead lays a hand on Sherlock's cheek.
John nodded and the man looked as though he wanted to laugh. He pursed his lips, holding it back and John grinned.
Because not only is John straight and very much not interested in Sherlock Holmes, but he's also very much making it impossible for Sherlock not to...
"You are beautiful, so beautiful Sherlock, so good for me and so bloody gorgeous," John is gasping, hips stuttering and it's enough to push Sherlock under.
Eyes locking in on that blond head that is telling him absolutely nothing, Sherlock narrows his grey eyes in scrutiny, attempting to decipher exactly what it is John is trying to say with that unenthusiastic apology.
John's breath catches and he squirms. Sherlock stops immediately and he looks up, only to find that damn smirk. "Ticklish," John says with a wink.
Only Sherlock would be able to detect the small exhale that escaped Mycroft's lips. "And the other activities? You'll… step back? Stop chasing dangerous people?"
And just like that, John's words cleared Sherlock's lust hazed brain. Those almost dirty but just sweet and innocent enough words brought him right back to reality, right back to why this was the absolute wrong thing to be doing, right back to why he was all kinds of wrong for John.
Sherlock groaned and pressed him back to the door, sealing his body against John's and threading his fingers through the hair on the back of John's head holding him in place. Their tongues battled for dominance, pushing and pulling, gasping and kneading into each other's mouths. John trickled his fingers down Sherlock's tight stomach muscles.
"Right. As I got older, and practiced my observation skills, 'honing them in' as my father put it, I thought it would satisfy my curiosity to know. To be able to know almost everything just by a cursory glance at anyone or anything. But it only fueled it. Now that I knew I could find answers, I became more inquisitive. The experiments started then." Sherlock deliberately left it at that. John had seen his microscope and petri dishes scattered around his flat. He was fully aware of what experiments Sherlock was speaking of. Of course, those weren't the only things he'd experimented with but he left that alone for now.
," John cuts him off, exasperated by this idiotic conversation. He grabs the flannels from where he'd dropped them on the floor and shoves them in Sherlock's direction. He's feeling a bit off-kilter at the moment and arguing with Sherlock seems to be stirring something else within him, something he can't define. "Why don't you stop running your mouth and start running these flannels over your desk?"
s and soft smiles and Sherlock is in paradise. Sherlock is so bloody happy he isn't quite sure what to do with himself, feeling like he could practically burst at any moment and flood the entire campus with every little thing he feels for John Watson. It's been two perfect weeks of being a boyfriend and having a boyfriend and Sherlock honestly isn't sure why everyone on this earth hasn't gone out and found themselves a John Watson because John Watson is breathtakingly perfect and it's impossible not to fall quite spectacularly in love with him.
here. Sherlock Holmes. You know him, yeah? You know all about his little quirks and his giant brain and-"
"Oh my god," Sherlock moans to the ceiling and John comes in long white streaks all over Sherlock's lower back, hips pumping forward over and over, riding it out, shivering out the last of his orgasm, vision blurring completely as his orgasm crashes over him.
There's a dip in the bed as John kneels behind him. Sherlock looks down between his legs, seeing John's hand slide lube over his cock for only a moment before it disappears behind him.
God and he really just didn't understand. He didn't understand why Sherlock was cutting him off. Why Sherlock didn't want him anymore. The rejection burned so deeply in him, he wasn't sure he could handle it.
John takes a deep, unsteady breath, tilting his head slightly up with the movement and Sherlock catches just a glimpse of a bright red cheek flushed, blotching down the side of his neck and disappearing into his collar.
His eyes may actually pop out as they bulge at Irene's vulgarity. "What is wrong with you?" he whispers harshly, glancing around to be sure no one heard.
Not a single fucking word from that genius boy John had been snogging mere hours ago and insanity is starting to settle in.
Sherlock nods at her and whispers encouragements as he slips into her pen for the first time without Lestrade present. "We're going to try something a little different today, pretty girl," Sherlock murmurs as he places the saddle on her back. "I know you need to run." He strokes his hand down her back as he hooks the buckles of the saddle. He then grabs hold of the reins as he leads her out of the stables.
The sites that pop up are now of the Do It Yourself variety with a splash of creative experiences thrown in, advertising the brilliance of young minds who have clearly been on a million dates and are looking to mix things up a bit.
"Good to know you want to die because after last night, they're going to murder you," Bill laughed as he tucked in his shirt.
"Not bad for a first timer," Mycroft grins down at his boyfriend and Greg returns a soppy look of his own.
"Move," John barks much louder at the figure in front of them blocking their way and Sherlock only realizes it's Victor as they pass by, deducing from the size of the boy in the doorway.
Sherlock's brain immediately short circuits. He forgets John's memory loss. He forgets the past six weeks. He forgets everything except his husband's body pressed to his, demanding attention.
Ignoring the flush rushing up into his cheeks, Sherlock clears his throat. "I wanted to be prepared," he replies diplomatically, steadfastly ignoring his blushing face even as John's grin tells him it's deep and dark and so bloody obvious. "Besides, I read some interesting things in the articles I found that I didn't know before. For example, one of the pieces stated in order to keep my man happy, I need to make sure he eats proper meals, hence dinner tonight."
"I can't!" Teenaged John Watson cried from the tree of the branch, knees wobbling as he stared down at the water before him.
Lestrade eyed him as if taking in what he said, then knitted his eyebrows. "Can I ask why you come to this stuff with him? I mean, the detective stuff. It's a bit...odd for kids your age, isn't it?"
," Sherlock whispered against his lips between kisses, hands planted on either side of that round face as he snogged that blond boy and John giggled, accepting Sherlock's attack on his mouth with a grin.
"This isn't hurting you, Sherlock," John says. "I won't do anything that hurts you. Especially in more intimate parts of our relationship. But this is important."
Well. That wasn't strictly true. He'd thrown him the office hours bone now hadn't he? Sherlock internally sighed, hating admitting mistakes to himself. He just couldn't quite leave that beautiful young man, who had so recently been rejected by some stupid kid who couldn't see all the potential he had, alone in the classroom without a sliver of hope. For some reason, he couldn't be that cruel to John. No, that wasn't true. He didn't
"Well, it's not for me," Sherlock replies flippantly. "It wouldn't be right for me to keep it." He sighs, fiddling with his pen. "But maybe… maybe I'll hold on to it? Try to find its rightful owner? The person it was meant for really ought to have it."
"Careful," John tries to scold but it's clear he's barely coherent. Sherlock rights himself and drags his mouth back up. He fists the base of John's cock and takes him back in.
page! I post updates there for all my stories! I'm also always open to suggestions so feel free to drop me a line!
Sherlock is so caught up in John and Dolly and late afternoon runs that he barely has thought about it himself.
"She'll be okay," Sherlock said as he flicked on the kettle. "A little bruised, nothing like what you endured. We think it's a gang, teaming up to rob the destitute."
The team wins, mostly thanks to the unstoppable force that is John Watson, and a roar of excitement rips through the crowd as the game comes to a close. Sherlock stands with the rest of the crowd, the chill in his bones long since melting away, and goes to step toward the stairs.
," John continues, his soft voice somehow sounding harsh – almost rough in the darkness. "God help me, I did. But seeing you today… I can't, Sherlock."
John closed his eyes, fear and irritation warring for dominance, body seeming undecided on if he was more furious with his best friend or more terrified of slimy creatures lurking beneath the dark water below him.
He'd just raced back to his dorm, actually ran through campus to make it home, make it back to Sherlock, his platonic roommate, heaving dramatic gasps of air as he'd thrown the door open only to find the room entirely empty.
Sherlock ignores the sweat forming along his brow as his body shivers with cool fear, the promise in Sebastian's words slithering over him like the presumptuous snake that he is.
Mike dragged his shocked stare from Link to John and narrowed his eyes. "Oh... but you want to, don't you?" He tossed his hands in the air in exasperation. "God dammit, Link, help me out here."
He really is pretty. His skin is soft and smooth, completely untouched and delicate. John licks his lips as his hands run over the outsides of Sherlock's pectorals. Sherlock's skin breaks out in goose flesh and his nipples pebble to hardness, a deep flush taking over his chest.
It's not an outright lie. Sherlock does has valuable insight on how to better John's game, but they both know that isn't why they spend time together.
"I'm so sorry, pretty girl," he murmurs, nuzzling his face into her mane. "That was so stupid of me. I'm so sorry."
"John! Greg!" Molly Hooper's voice comes through the crowd before they can see her but John is already smiling. Molly and Greg are the only two campers John has never had any physical interest in. They're his friends, nothing more and he wouldn't have it any other way. The three of them have become quite close over all these years, staying in touch via e-mail when not on campgrounds and John likes to think they'll always be friends.
"Well, that," Mrs. Holmes continues as Sherlock's stomach drops to his toes, "and Sherlock loved Winnie the Pooh when he was a boy."
And within the span of a single breath, Sherlock has no bloody idea why he thought this was such a magnificent plan in the first place.
Sherlock huffed and closed his eyes as though John were trying to torture him. "Mycroft has...access."
"I'll be right back," Link said abruptly, kicking off the table clumsily and strolling with purpose.
John would prefer not to delve too deeply into what exactly had gone wrong that evening. He would prefer to close his metaphorical eyes to all things concerning his confusing roommate and his confusing feelings and his confusing relationship with the boy he lives with but clearly that isn't an option seeing as it's all he does now. It's all he fucking
So, if anything, they should be friends. They should spend time together and maybe John could, at the very least, earn an ally in London. He could use it, after all. He knew a total of one person here.
Sherlock doesn't know why he trusts John, but he does. He does with every fiber of his being. He trusts John not to hurt him. He trusts John to take care of him.
Smirking in triumph, John stops walking, crossing his arms over his chest and raising an eyebrow. "Thought I might," he glares proudly, body relaxing away from tense and determined to calm and cool and collected.
A quiet rustle of clothing could be heard, an odd sound as though someone was trying to speak and being muffled, a gasp of air, then, "Seriously, stop. I don't want that."
And with that, Irene spins around and takes off without a second glance, sashaying away with all the confidence in the world.
He should have made the place completely uninhabitable, should have forced John out the moment the boy dropped his bags at the bottom of the second flight of stairs and stuck out his hand to introduce himself as Sherlock's new flatmate, the one his landlady Mrs. Hudson had gone and found for him because she just 'couldn't bear to see him holed up there all alone for an entire school year.'
," Sherlock gasps, strong hands finding John's hips and pulling him close, pressing bare skin to bare skin, shooting tingling sparks along John's nerves and a groan out of his mouth, lips closing along Sherlock's neck and sucking gently. "John I-… I absolutely stand by what I said last night."
"I-I'm sorry," he mutters, wriggling out from under John and off the bed. "I'm...I didn't-I shouldn't have...I'm sorry," he mutters and hurries off into the loo, shutting the door softly, though the click of the lock is loud.
He had no words. He couldn't speak. His hands found their way to Sherlock's shoulders, holding on and
Cutting that thought off right at the knees before it gets out of hand, Sherlock turns away without a word from his departing brother currently headed in the direction of the team and takes off toward his dorm, suddenly needing desperately to escape before he does something exponentially stupid, like reveal his feelings to his
"Okay okay, get out of here, all of you," Greg chuckles, waving them off. "And please, for the love of Christ Mike,
John is still grinning. "In just a few years, I'll be a working physician. I would take out a loan and pay you in full now, then pay off the debt when I get a job."
John's thumb and forefinger close over each of Sherlock's nipples and pull just enough to drag a moan from Sherlock's lips. "John," he gasps, eyelids fluttering under the touch.
Although, listening to John murmur to himself as he'd gotten ready for bed had done nothing to reshape that belief. If anything, it had only made it stronger.
Sherlock takes a small comfort in that as he stares back defiantly, eyebrow raised, daring Mycroft to say something more. Regarding each other carefully, Sherlock begins to relax. Mycroft doesn't know anything.
"Slow down," John whispered to the cabbie as Sherlock pulled into a car park, realizing there was no reason to be quiet too late. They crept passed the building Sherlock parked in front of and John watched as he made his way inside. "Drop me around the corner," John instructed and paid the cabbie as he followed the directions. He climbed out and made his way back to windowless building, glancing up for the first time to see a dimly lit sign blinking overhead reading
And he truly has every intention of doing that, really, he does. He locates his discarded pants and tugs them on, spinning back toward the bed in search of his dressing gown he'd strewn somewhere two nights before.
His eyes flutter, blurry brightness peeking through his slitted eyelids. "Mm," he moans. A hand glides through his hair.
Sherlock wrenched himself out of reach and stepped back, swinging his coat over his shoulders furiously.
They regard each other silently, unseeing but seeing. Sherlock wonders if this has ever happened before. If John has ever done this while he's been asleep. If John ever reaches for him in the night.
"Hey!" Mike and Link said together, trying to sound indignant and failing as they both continued to giggle.
Sherlock has no answers. All of his reasoning seems so small and feeble now, risking his health and well being to endure torturous day after torturous day. He racks his brain for an explanation, something to give to his partner, proof that he is okay and he had it under control.
Which was what brought him to his current place. Staring into the mirror. Wondering when he'd become so bloody stupid.
Victor takes a small step closer, pulling a hand free from his pocket and gripping the strap of his bag, eagerly fidgeting with it. "Tonight? You could come to mine and we could work on it?"
"You are all a bunch of wankers, you know that?" John Watson snaps, the beet-red color in his face having nothing to do with the running he's just done.
"I'll get that candle for the table," Angelo continues, pointing in Sherlock's direction before backing away. "It's more romantic."
Somehow, she'd convinced him his whole life that no matter what he did, even after the drugs, even with the promiscuity, she would still be there for him. She only offered her opinions when asked, only gave support when contacted. And sometime, long ago, he had been made certain that he'd never meet someone else who could do that for him. No one he'd met thus far had.
"I brought dinner," he says but his voice is rough and a little wobbly, deeper than Sherlock has ever heard it like liquid chocolate pouring out of his mouth, his eyes reflecting the heat currently radiating off of Sherlock's skin and from there it's all over.
"Of course dear." Victoria went to leave, but stopped short at the doorway and turned back. "I can't wait to officially meet the man that has captured my son's heart, Sherlock," she smiled brightly, then took off down the hall.
Instead, all Sherlock can do is flap his lips helplessly several times before raising the shaky hand clutching his mobile and waving it gently with a weak smile, hoping the joke eases the heavy tension between them, John's wordless state making Sherlock's stomach churn. "Er-" he mutters. "I'm awake."
Sherlock didn't move for a moment, and then said, "What do you mean you 'figured out how to take care of one'?"
Sherlock clears his throat, glancing down to the bag full of books on his shoulder, none of which are the ones he needs for the their project. "My notes are back at my room. Can we stop there on the way?" His
And Victor is… fine. He's not adorably cheeky or hilariously funny. He's not sturdy and reliable while being simultaneously fun. He doesn't tease Sherlock mercilessly and make him blush.
"You are so gorgeous like this," he murmured up to his blond boyfriend as John's already red face darkened a shade. "You look so fucking good riding against me. I want to feel you come all over me."
"Mycroft," he murmured into the phone, gripping the device tightly in his hand as his entire body threatened to give out. "M-Mycroft."
He has no idea how he made it to first period. It's a miracle, honestly. He's in a daze, really. A fog. Nothing seems real. He wishes none of this
John nods, although he'd prefer not to make any promises considering he doesn't even know where the others are at the moment. He pulls his phone free and sends a quick text to the remaining three about Greg leaving and his and Sherlock's plans for one more song before tucking it away and moving to go to the bar.
John bit down hard on the inside of his cheek, doing his best to keep himself in check. "Sod off," he ground out.
"Oh love yes," John whispers above him as a hand lays softly on the back of his head, clearly still coming back from his orgasm but giving a solid effort in assisting Sherlock's. "Touch yourself."
Lestrade rolled his eyes, then looked around as though he may be overheard. "I can-" he paused and glanced down at John.
He reached his now damp palm down to join his other hand and stroked Sherlock's erection, slowly and methodically, getting it as wet as he could with his spit and the pre-come that was now spilling freely out of the tip of Sherlock's cock. He continued his work, eyes trained on Sherlock's face as he began to pant, hot and heavy and not quietly in the least. He moaned, throwing his curls back and pushing into John's grasp, his hips thrusting faster and faster, gasping and digging his fingers into John's scalp almost painfully. John loved it.
John's body went absolutely still as he came face to face with the tall, dark and handsome man he'd been drooling over only a few short minutes ago. His eyes widened at the sturdy features up close, those silver eyes tinting a slight green now as the man narrowed his gaze down at John.
Sherlock nodded and turned to John, whose face had gone impossibly red, fury radiating off of him. Sherlock waited for Molly to begin walking toward the double doors, then turned to John.
"You are not a vigilante, Sherlock, you cannot simply walk into a burglary at random and save the day, so to speak." Mycroft sighed heavily. "That's what the police are for. Let them do their jobs. You need to be focused on school. Enough of these distractions."
"They stumbled in around one o'clock this morning," John continues. "They were laughing and it woke me up."
"No way," John whispers, leaning up just enough to press a kiss to Sherlock's mouth before whispering, "I just got you in here, you think I'm just going to let you leave now?"
"Sleep now," John hushes, dragging a hand through Sherlock's damp curls. "Football and shower later."
Link threw his head back. "Oh man, have you not heard? Ugh, apparently, he basically runs the class for the professor and he's tough as hell."
He takes the head of John's cock in and swirls his tongue around it. John sighs and Sherlock drags his lips further down the shaft, sucking lightly as he goes.
The genius boy freezes as the door closes behind him looking alarmed, seeming stunned into place like maybe if he stays still long enough John will forget he's there, before he recovers enough to quietly mutter, "Er- hello." He's clutching a wad of clothing in his hands and hurriedly tosses them into his open closet door before shuffling back over to the bed and climbing in beside John. "How are you?"
Sometimes, Greg could be a complete wanker, and sometimes Greg said things like this and John actually smiled for the first time in days. "If you will, I will," John muttered.
The thought of domesticity always seemed completely abhorrent to Sherlock in theory but now, lying here, clinging to John as he makes love to him, settling down is the only thing he wants. Settling down with John. Forever.
Irene's eyebrows shoot up and Sherlock wonders if they could reach her hair if it weren't still pulled snuggly back from practice. "Have you
Jesus this guy was smooth. John grinned, his liquored mind appreciating the attention more then his sober self would have. Will grinned back and wrapped his arms further around John. "Come here," he crooned. John gripped Will's biceps to steady himself as they swayed to the music, and couldn't help but notice how firm they were. He gave an experimental squeeze to each, testing them out, and Will tightened his grasp on his waist. "I've never seen you here before," Will was murmuring into his ear and John shivered.
Breathing out a shaky breath of his own, Sherlock's gaze is darker now as he looks up at John from beneath his lashes. "I wouldn't know," he murmurs, looking a bit dazed. "I've never been."
John settles himself on his forearms on either side of Sherlock's body as Sherlock winds his arms around John's shoulders, one hand finding its way into blond fringe and holding on.
"Sorry," Sherlock mutters, looking around for any sign of John but the majority of players are off the field and heading to the locker rooms, John Watson nowhere to be found.
And then John had walked into Chemistry Lecture the following day, seen his bag sitting on his usual desk, heard the new TA's news of replacing Sherlock, and sadness had turned to downright rage.
At any given moment, at anything that pops up unexpectedly, any new experience John suggests, Sherlock tends to pale and attempt to exclude himself. The parties, lunches, games, all of it Sherlock has been less than excited to participate, trying not to have to attend, attempting to find excuses, fighting before finally giving in every time and then throwing worried glances at John up until he's comfortable in the setting and everything else falls away.
glad to see you," he says genuinely, searching Sherlock's face like he hasn't seen it in too long which the genius boy can most definitely relate to considering he's doing the same thing, watching deep ocean irises dart back and forth, up and down, sparkling in that stunning way they always do. He loves John's blue eyes and he hadn't realized he'd missed them so much until this very moment, so he takes his fill, indulging himself in the gorgeous eyes of his lover.
to go out and see what was out there and have some fun and who knows maybe meet someone? He humiliatingly admitted to himself that he'd never even kissed someone. Maybe tonight could be that night for him?
John huffs out a surprised laugh before poking Sherlock in the side. "Does kissing me just bring out the snark in you?"
," Sherlock's words stutter and tip into a lingering moan at the feeling of John's tongue dipping into his ear, tiny gooseflesh bumps rippling out along his skin under John's fingers where they dance along his neck.
Something passes over John's face and then his features harden. And then his hand moves from Sherlock's chin to the back of his head and then his lips are pressing to Sherlock's and Sherlock's brain short-circuits.
"Advice noted and appreciated," John smiles hoping it comes off as reassuring without giving away the fact that he is fully aware exactly what's going on here. While he doesn't want to make his boyfriend worry, John sort of loves that Sherlock worries and cares for him so much and equally adores the way the boy attempts to pretend he doesn't; it's incredibly endearing. Which is why John can't be obvious about the fact that he knows exactly what's going on here. "I'll keep an eye on it and make sure to check in with the trainer constantly."
He can keep a secret. John wants him behind closed doors. That's fine. He can do that. He will take whatever he can get.
"I know that Sherlock, but I don't know who it was. There two guys, that's all I know. They... came up from behind. I didn't- I wasn't prepared."
Lacing his fingers with Sherlock's, John hardly heard the string of curse words leaving Lestrade's mouth as he reveled in Sherlock's monologue, full of us and we, like they were a real team. A pair. Inseparable. Even now, it made John's heart pound a little harder in his chest.
John's eyes trail over Sherlock's thin, pale frame. He looks fragile and beautiful. "You're very pretty, Sherlock."
A glimpse of something through the mist caught Sherlock's attention and he turned sluggishly toward the figure, curious but unsure if he was too tired to care. He kept walking. The figure darted back into view through the fog and Sherlock saw a short, blonde boy jogging through the park. Oh Christ. John Watson. Of course.
"Look at her waist," John murmurs as though in shock, pointing a finger at one of the women on the screen. "I've never seen this on this big of a screen before but… Jesus, her waist is so
"Forget the girlfriends," John steps closer, cutting him off. "They aren't anything compared to you. I couldn't… I couldn't
"Oi!" Two shrill voices hollered at them from across the table and Sherlock turned, eyebrow raised to look between Link and Mike.
Fighting down the squirming at the base of his spine, it was John's turn to laugh, because really, this couldn't actually be happening to him. "Jesus, what are you a theatre major? Take it down a notch with the dramatics."
Greg is the first to recover with a slow twist of his lips into a sly, knowing grin, features glowing so brightly you'd think he was the one that had just kissed his longtime crush. "Ho-ly fuck," he smirks, eyes bright and teasing and full of excitement.
"Fuck yes, baby," John moans softly, and fingers find their way into Sherlock's hair. Sherlock hums contentedly.
Sherlock stares back, his pretty pink lips parted with gasping breath. His chest rises and falls quickly, his slender body shaking. "Wh-What are you-"
Victoria nodded and supported John's head as Sherlock slipped out of the car. He then reached back in and slid his arm under John's shoulder and behind his knees, lifted and swept him out of the car bridal-style. He jerked his head toward the house and his mother hurried ahead of him, opening the front door for the pair. Sherlock carried John swiftly inside, and to his room, Victoria following close behind.
"What?" John asks, hand half-outstretched with unhelpful flannels. He blinks up at the curly-haired boy as Sherlock's backward steps bring him to John's side, whose eyes are locked on the rapidly rising liquid. "Sherlock?"
Sherlock whirls around too quickly at the sound of a voice, falling back against the lockers with a loud clatter.
"Wh-" the voice starts again then stops, sounding closer and yet lost and the ringing in the genius' ears dulls to a low garbled roar as his head begins to spin, like he's suddenly been swept away by a giant wave that is threatening to drown him and that's fine, that's entirely fine because the absolute worst day of Sherlock's entire life somehow just got even worse and if he could just disappear into the sea that would be ideal.
They fall into the backseat when Sherlock finally manages to pull it open, laughter calming in favor of heady kisses and low moans. It's cramped and sweaty and bloody exciting and Sherlock's fingers are abruptly on the button of John's jeans. "Can I?" he breathes, more than ready for this. He'd done his research. He knows what to do.
Of course now, Sherlock was finding it increasingly difficult to keep his hands off John. He'd sworn up and down they would take it slow, and he planned to keep that promise but John certainly wasn't making it easy on him. Since the day John met Mycroft, only five days previously, Sherlock had kept things at kissing. Not that there was anything chaste about the way they were kissing, and Sherlock knew that only made it worse, but he was determined to follow through with his plan. When he felt John's hands wander, he'd maneuver properly around them so as not to upset the kiss, but make it more difficult to let it go any further. John obeyed, growling quietly in frustration every time, and Sherlock physically gripped at John's hair to keep his hands out of his clothes. God, just kissing that boy made him so achingly hard and he had to leave him every time all too soon, with an excuse about homework or class or an experiment or anything besides staying. He wasn't fooling John, but the boy was kind enough to let him go without a fuss. John seemed to have agreed to taking things slow, even though it was clearly painful for him. Sherlock appreciated this because in all honesty, if John pushed back even a tiny bit, Sherlock would have fucked him ten ways to Sunday by now.
He's not sure when he's become so sappy but this boy whom he currently has bundled up in his bed, tucked cozily beneath the covers is staring up at him with a wide, trusting, beautiful gaze and John just wants to shower him in affection and tenderness, keep him warm and doe-eyed and happy as ever.
"You could have grabbed it off the hook when we left," John scolds as he tosses the bundled towels onto Sherlock's bed. "It's sitting right there."
," is Sherlock's pathetic follow-up to his original counterpoint, thoughts beginning to spinning together tightly and confuse one another as the broad chest current pressed to his own rises and falls at the pace of a gentle panting and Sherlock finds his own breaths following at a similar tempo.
Sherlock darted quickly behind a building and John hurried to catch up, letting out a breath he didn't know he was holding when he rounded the corner and caught sight of the man still a good ways ahead of him. John's body thrummed with questions as he hurried along, nerves and excitement pounding in his veins. Where was Sherlock going? What did he do after class was over? What was he like when he wasn't teaching or sitting in his office? These questions had hung in the back of John's mind for weeks, and while he knew what some of Sherlock's extracurricular activities involved, he was positive he didn't know the half of it.
Everyone should know. Everyone should be well aware of who and what they are to each other and everyone should get to see the way John touches and holds and reaches for Sherlock, the way he slides an arm around his waist or soothes a hand through his hair, how at random intervals he kisses Sherlock's cheeks and has a grin ready for him at all times. People should fucking
He uses the toilet and heads to his room to find the acid he's stored for this very occasion when he hears a sharp yelp.
He shouldn't feel this way about John. Not because he's a boy – Sherlock sorted out his sexuality a few years ago, not thinking much of it at the time, until John Watson had wandered into his school and if he hadn't been certain he was gay before, John Watson and his rugged handsomeness had been sure to convince him wholeheartedly.
That niggle in the back of his mind reared up and drown his convictions so quickly it made his head spin.
The grin is immediate, spreading across Sherlock's delicate features rapidly. "He'll probably drop dead of a heart attack," he laughs, "or offer to pay you to stay away from me."
The change of topic only fuels the speculation that Sherlock was most definitely napping but John lets it go, rolling up to a sitting position and raising his arm all the way up, fingers pointing straight to the ceiling as he rotates it back and forth. "Really good," he says excitedly because it
of all people. I find you fascinating and kind and gentle and it amazes me every day that you are mine. You are the most important thing in the world to me John and I do. With all my heart."
Sherlock ducks his head. "Well when you go to school with mostly idiots, it's not difficult to achieve."
"My god, you are gorgeous," the blond boy breathes, "How did I get this lucky to be here with you right now?"
Safely behind a closed door, Sherlock rights himself and goes about showering and brushing his teeth, deciding that yes, John was definitely right, there is absolutely no reason for them to make it so obvious as to what happened between them the night before. He cleans himself quickly and redresses in his pajama bottoms and t-shirt, tossing his dressing gown on over top before hurrying to the kitchen.
The urge to grab him by the hips and press him against the wall slams into John like a tackle on the rugby field and he has to close his eyes for a long moment, fingers clenching around the jeans he's holding to focus on the task at hand which is to get out the door and not back into bed.
"It really is," Greg nods. "But eventually, they figure it out. Well, Mycroft did anyway." The sad smile is gone and a pleased little grin replaces it. "That man, I swear. It took some convincing but repetition helps." Greg smirks cheekily. "And lots of sex."
It was clean and not deep, no stitches needed, and John continued to clean it gently, taking care not to press too hard. He placed several small bandages over the cleaned wound, as Sherlock continued to breathe deeply and evenly, sound asleep. He sighed contently under John's touch and John couldn't help but smile.
"I'm just getting to the station now," Sherlock muttered innocently, "I sure hope I can make it through the crowds. It's rather busy in here."
His two realities are suddenly colliding violently and after the initial impact, a slow, soothing calm settles over him.
Even by Sherlock's standards, considering he still doesn't know a thing about rugby, the game is absolutely
together. Fuck everything else. This was it. After so much wasted time, this was Sherlock's moment. "Why would you care? It would get me out of your hair, wouldn't it? It would keep me from making you stay here, right? The one thing you don't want to do? It would get me out of your life, so why would you even care if I were to d-"
At first glance, John Watson is everyone's man. John Watson is for public consumption. John Watson belongs to the team and the school and the crowd and the world.
It takes all of one look for John to make his desires known. He drops his head, peering up at Sherlock from under his lashes, tilting his head slightly toward the shore.
He turned back to his two friends. "And you lot need to be fucking nice. What is the matter with the two of you? I thought you'd at least be- what?" He stopped short and narrowed his eyes as he watched Link's face turn redder and redder until he burst into laughter, Mike falling close behind him.
Mike nodded. "I gave him my two cents about what I thought of him. You're right, he is a total bastard."
"Boys," John nods in greeting before turning to grin up into his roommate's eyes, simultaneously lacing their fingers together in such an achingly familiar and intimate way like they've done every night in bed for the last six nights, and tucking their joined hands between their bodies. "You all remember my boyfriend Sherlock, yeah?"
He regretted the words as they left his mouth. Why had he said that? Could he sound any more like a whiny, petulant child feeling sorry for himself during his first real, honest conversation with Sherlock? Come on.
Even in his sleep, Sherlock wants to be as close to John as humanly possible and that fact alone settles a tiny, radiant ember in the rugby player's ribcage, making his insides feel gooey and joyful, wanting nothing more than to keep this boy as close as humanly possible at all times. Absently stroking a hand down the genius boy's still jersey-covered back, the pads of his fingers catching slightly on his own rugby number, John takes a moment to revel in waking up with Sherlock cuddled into him, wearing
A dry laugh came from the couch and John shivered at the unwelcome sound, unwillingly turning toward the sound. "Mm, I get it. You're the boyfriend that protects John from his big bad family, aren't ya? So sweet." She turned to John. "He'll leave you, ya know. Just like dad is leaving mom. Just like Clara left me. We're too messed up for relationships, Johnny. Things never work out for people like us." She leaned back on the couch. "Like I said: you're a Watson."
The taxi drove up and Sherlock gave John a gentle push toward it as the boy was still gaping at him in shock.
"Paul isn't at home," John sighs, fear prickling up the back of his neck and slamming into the base of his skull, spreading along his shoulders and out to his fingers, a bead of sweat popping free from his brow. "Jesus, where the fuck is he?"
Then John sneaks into Sherlock's room late at night and snogs him senseless, occasionally letting his hands wander and grope, allowing Sherlock to do the same, and they deliver each other teenage-quick orgasms almost constantly.
"Christ, okay, you scared the hell out of me. Don't do that John. I know you want to explore all this finally and figure it out but seriously, be fucking careful. That guy was hot but he was a little creepy. And forward as shit."
Which is gone in the blink of an eye as Mycroft's features darken rapidly, narrowing in on John like a predator to its prey, no longer the soft, gentle boy but the strong, powerful man looking out for his family and no one else. "But make no mistake, John," he practically growls, "if you so much as hurt a single strand of hair on Sherlock's head, I will personally-"
"But ever since that party at our house, when he… when he got Sherlock drunk…" Paul trails off again, shaking his head, eyes glazing over slightly at the memory. "He's become such a bloody
The floodgates seem to burst open all over again in John's chest and fill his insides with another wave of affection so strong for this boy it almost aches, the sight of him delighting in praises and touches making John want to wrap him back up in the comforter and keep him forever.
"And you all seem to forget I'm in charge of conditioning," Greg threatens to the group of giggling boys. "How does ten laps around the pitch sound?"
Heat blooms in Sherlock's cheeks immediately at the use of love falling so effortlessly from the blond boy's mouth, that same boy that is currently holding him tight like he never intends on letting him go. Sherlock squirms closer. "Fine, thank you."
Wavering for only a moment more, Sherlock finally stands, rolling his eyes when he catches John grinning smugly at him, grabbing his shower kit and disappearing through the door.
"I'm sorry," Irene Adlers's smooth words dripping with incredulity come from behind him. "Did that gorgeous beast of a rugby captain just talk to
"I'm going to make you feel so good, baby," John all but growls as he finishes applying the lube, settling one clean hand beside Sherlock's head while the other dances its fingers along the curly-haired boy's inner-thigh. "I'm going to make you moan."
. Claps on the back, brief hugs, fond smiles and waves are offered as they make their way through, and Sherlock doesn't miss several appreciative gazes down John's fit body from spectators eyeing the rugby player making his way through the crowd. Clearly Sherlock isn't the only one to notice how dashing John looks this evening.
"John," Sherlock whispers as his hip bumps against the mattress, stalling their movements just short of tumbling onto the covers.
Sherlock is pulled from his deep thoughts by John's hand on his shoulder, jerking around to find the blond boy grinning at him. "John?"
and so before he can stop himself or overthink it or bloody well know better, the word is out of his mouth and he slams his eyes shut and freezes, the sound of his gravely voice deafeningly loud in the silent room.
Because Sherlock Holmes has been in John Watson's bed since the night before, slumbering away in dreamland right at John's side and this just might be the best damn thing that has ever happened in John Watson's whole entire
Hands were finding shirts and hair and grips were tightening as they clung to each other, all the emotional turmoil of the past few days finally
Glancing up, John's eyelids drop slightly as he takes in Sherlock's question. Sherlock had done his best to smooth his features into feigned indifference but the look on John's face is telling him he's failed miserably. He flicks his gaze toward the door, the one that leads out in the direction of the car park. John reads his eyes
Although, it's not really anything to worry about. John has no intention of breaking Sherlock's heart.
"Ah, and be just like you?" Sherlock whips around, eyes scanning over the disheveled appearance of Sebastian Wilkes, taking in the marks and loose threads and telling words that have just tumbled out of his mouth like the idiot he is. "Based on the finger-shaped bruises on your neck and the scratches on your cheek, I assume you yourself pay for sex and may have gotten a bit handsy for a call girl's liking this past weekend?"
want to meet him," Mike emphasizes, lips still twitching. "I've heard he's completely mad and I could use a little mad in my life, couldn't I, Greg?"
," Sherlock volleys back, irritation and hope and panic and fear all warring for dominance within his slender body. "You asked me what we were doing, implying you didn't want anyone to know and I said-"
Sherlock actually giggles, an odd euphoria settling over him. "I think I just might," he says and John laughs.
And just when his knees are threatening to buckle with the weight of the truth of Victor's words, threatening to take him down and never let him leave this god-awful place, the front door clicks open, snapping Sherlock out of his statuesque position and he only barely manages not to mow Paul right over in his haste to get out the door, panting as he tears down the steps.
know," John nods, huffing a laugh, "though I have no idea why he puts up with me. Probably because I feed him every night."
"You're very... chipper." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and again, John laughed. It was an infuriatingly nice noise.
Instead, his brain decides to unhinge from his mouth and words come tumbling out that he had no intention of saying. "Do you want to come along?"
"Fucking… Christ… don't…. stop…" John moans, vaguely embarrassed by his lack of speech but at this particular moment he can't give a fuck because his cock is being swallowed down Sherlock's long, beautiful throat.
He was wishing for the world to change. For the entire universe to understand that this, right here, two naked men lying in a bath, exchanging the gentlest of caresses wasn't wrong. To understand that a man loving another man wasn't wrong.
The conversation he had with Sherlock from the night before flashed through his mind and he closed his eyes.
"Ah, I see we've been quite busy," John said conversationally. This, oddly, was one of his favorite parts of the day. Teasing a serious, focused Sherlock was too much fun, the reward being a quirk of the lips or a blush across those sharp, pale cheeks, sometimes even a tiny laugh. That was his favorite.
The small lift of his shoulder makes John look innocent and unassuming. "Maybe it was an experiment."
God, it had been by far and away the most incredible phone call Sherlock had ever received, and that included the multiple occasions of phone sex John insists they have when they're apart.
John couldn't tell if it hurt more that Sherlock was dating someone or that he didn't deem John worthy enough to tell.
"You just spoke again. Really John, if you are going to make such announcements, you should abide by your own rules."
Cackling, Irene tugs on his sleeve to bring him back down. "I'm kidding," she grins, laughter dying in her throat as Sherlock slumps back down beside her. "I'm kidding, Sherlock, really. You don't… you don't have to do that. Not if you don't want to."
More of the same appears only now the sites are tailor-made for gay men looking for whatever their heart desires in a partner, more risqué photos appearing along the image bar of scantily clad men winking and smirking and showing more skin than necessary.
"Hey," Sherlock greets them both, sighing a bit in relief at the sight of two people he would consider himself friendly with, no longer being cornered by some arsehole and feeling a bit safer, though no less shaken by the encounter.
"And why on earth would I do that?" The man grinned wickedly. "There's three of us and two of you. Or well, three if you count the one we already did a number on. What makes you think you're so much better then us that you get the nice little flat in the middle of London with this pretty boy?"
A ripple of wrath whips its way down his spine, starting at the point where Victor had touched him and racing through his system at lightning speed, beads of sweat popping at his brow with the effort not to turn and wring Victor's scrawny neck to
John's hand runs lovingly along Sherlock's back in a sweep of comfort, nuzzling his neck with soft kisses. "It's not over, baby," John whispers in his ear, making Sherlock's world tilt with another wave of bliss. "It's far from over."
He knows better but he was so hurt this morning, he figures why not twist the knife a little deeper.
. Even as Sherlock's chest is seizing with panic that his deepest secret could be revealed with the insinuation of this trip, he still finds himself oddly calmed, his insides soothed by his flatmate's ease.
They weren't questions that expected answers. They were just thoughts, John's simple, heartbreaking thoughts that he truly believed no one wanted him. Sherlock was convinced his heart was being ripped out of his chest by an unseen entity as he watched John Watson fall apart beside him. His cheeks were flushed from the alcohol and wet from the tears, his right eye was slowly turning a dark purple and swelling, his clothes were tattered from falling on the concrete and his hands were shaking.
Sherlock frees his trouser button and pushes at them as best he can with one hand until he can pull his own cock out, the heat of John's stare too much to handle. He begins long pulls over himself, eyes never leaving John's burning blue gaze. Sneaking his tongue out, Sherlock licks at the tip of John's thumb, laving over the pad in gentle caresses.
"Sherlock?" John's hesitant voice filters back in through the genius boy's anger and Sherlock blinks blearily at his friend, still wading his way through his outrage. "Are you alright?"
Sherlock raised his gloved hands to the door handle and John caught a glimpse of two silver objects sliding into the lock. Sherlock's hands worked delicately, twisting and turning quickly and efficiently and John narrowed his eyes. What was he…
"Really?" Victor practically beams at him, green eyes glittering with gratitude. "Oh god, that's so great, thank you so much, mate, truly."
And Sherlock resists the urge to march over to him, ring him by his neck and shout at him that he doesn't have the right to look so wretched because
Though the roommate/friendship line is being toe'd rather seriously by the rugby player. If he knew how idiotic that truly was, Sherlock is certain John would stop doing it. But Sherlock is too selfish to alert him to his mistake. To let John in on the truth. The truth of what Sherlock really is.
Snapped free from his inner-turmoil, John looks up to find Sherlock Holmes glowering at him, eyes narrowed and face red as a cherry, though not in the sweet, embarrassed way John loves but an angry, furious red that John has never seen on the genius' face before, making his thumbs falter in shock. "Sherlock-" he tries but the boy cuts him off.
This blue-eyed boy is sporting a different look. An odd one that should be ridiculous. It shouldn't work. Really, this isn't a look just anyone could pull off. But it's doing it.
John and Link disentangled and both pouted. "What about finding me someone new? I'm looking real good tonight and I'm a damn catch. Someone's bound to pick me up," John tried to reason, nodding as though his argument should be convincing.
Sherlock melts back into the mattress, bones turning to jelly as John kisses him thoroughly, tenderly rubbing their tongues together so carefully Sherlock almost misses the sudden warmth between his legs.
"Don't be," Sherlock whispers back, wrapping a hand around the base of John's neck loosely but steadily, careful not to bump into his skull in case that hit caused any sort of head trauma. "It's alright."
Shooting him a grin, Greg laughs with a shake of his head. "Right? But who knows, maybe it'll help my case. Remind Myc what a pain in the arse his brother is and realize that his anger should be focused on
"You know I'm usually just embarrassed for him but today I am embarrassed for us all having to witness this," Paul shakes his head fondly and John laughs. "Come on Mike, leave the poor bloke alone."
There is a beat of silence, the snuggling continuing on as though John hadn't spoken, neither boy apparently willing to let go, the need to be close consuming them both.
"Mm," John hums half-heartedly, decidedly less interested in hearing about Sherlock's painful teenage years. No wonder he'd been reluctant to spend any time with John's teammates. He was probably certain they'd be cruel. Everyone else in Sherlock's life clearly had been. And he didn't have any fucking parents to help. John could relate to being parentless, hell he was practically parentless himself, but John had always been lucky enough to be liked in school. He'd never had issues with friendships or bullies, always the bloke most people liked immediately. It was easy for him.
He wants this slender genius to be his, permanently. He wants to call Sherlock his boyfriend and kiss him whenever he wants and hold his hand and claim him every minute of every day.
"So, you did though?" John murmurs, gaze so soft and filled with so many things Sherlock has been desperately wanting to see in them for so long, navy hope blooming in his irises. He peels back a square piece of paper taped precariously to the front of the box, revealing nine words that shake Sherlock's world all over again, the visual evidence almost too much to take.
Sherlock refuses to look up. He figures John will either grab him by the collar and ring his neck, or get right to it and punch him in the face. Just another day in the life of Sherlock Holmes.
He knew very well that Mycroft had informed John of his drug issues. He also knew Mycroft had deliberately left out the suicide attempt. It wasn't that hard to sort out.
The frown remains on that round, adorable face. "Uh-" John glances quickly at the calendar on his desk, "it's Tuesday."
The tips of his fingers find the solid backside of John's hand against his belly and he just barely manages to keep himself from moaning out loud, tiny tingles dancing along each digit pad as they brush against smooth, warm skin, crawling their way up and around, sliding into the spaces between John's fingers and closing, locking themselves in place and drinking in the soft center of John's palm as they press in and hang on.
"You're perfect," John whispers, thumbing at his own semen on Sherlock's face, rubbing it into the pores on his chin. It's utterly filthy and unbelievably sexy and Sherlock just now remembers his own hard cock sitting cradled in the bend of his trousers as he still sits on his knees at John's hip, palms planted on either side of John's thighs. John seems to be completely captivated by his come on Sherlock's chin, eyes roving over the streaks in something like awe.
"You are filthy," Sherlock mutters into John's still damp blond fringe, sweat and dirt suddenly filling his nose with an odd, though not unpleasant smell now that they're enclosed in a small room. "Have you bathed?"
Sherlock won in the end, hand wrapping around John's already thick cock, hard and leaking between his legs.
"We're great until something new happens," John agrees with a sigh. "Then we're back to square one."
himself, it hurts being so damn close to John and having no idea where they stand, no idea why John is back here after everything Sherlock said and did and after
Scrubbing a hand down his face, John huffed. "Just a royally bad day topped off with telling the one person I thought would make it better to fuck off."
"And I see you haven't changed a bit," Mycroft replies airily. His eyes dart to John and narrow a fraction. "Who's your friend?"
?" Irene suddenly barks, falling into step beside him and throwing the back of her hand to his upper arm in a disbelieving
," she admonishes as though that's the worst thing she's ever heard him say which, by all means, it is
Fingers curve against his cheek and a thumb brushes into the cool streaks along his lips. Sherlock's eyes flutter at the gentle touch, reveling in the attention even after the more intimate part has ended.
They are roommates who eat together and spend evenings together simply out of proximity to each other. Sherlock may even dare to think that maybe they've sort of become… friends.
his control over to John so fucking incredible it makes him ache to watch. "Yeah, that's it, Sherlock."
Sherlock's deft fingertips ran down John's torso, caressing his skin lovingly and tenderly, touching his skin in such an intimate way that John shuddered slightly, feeling slightly out of his depth as Sherlock's eyes roved over him.
He's John's mate now. Not his partner. Not his lover. Not even his best friend. Just his mate. A flatmate. A housemate. A fucking
And John launched into the sordid tale of Harry's announcement of the divorce and the denial of parenting gay children. It was even more horrible coming from John's gentle mouth. Sherlock nodded and kept from clenching his hands into angry fists as he listened to the boy he loved explain how his parents had basically disowned him.
. He needed to stay away from him. "As I stated previously, several times in fact, I had a purpose for approaching you. I apologise if you took what I said out of context."
John cleared his throat. "Maybe I… Maybe I ask Sherlock? To go with me? Like…as my date? Or something? Not like outright, but maybe just mention it… And see what he says?"
"Sherlock is coming to the game on Saturday," Mike crows proudly, smacking a light hand onto Sherlock's shoulder and shaking him slightly.
And all Sherlock's short-circuited brain can process is the fact that John Watson's strong, capable, powerful body colliding with his is the most exquisite thing he has ever experienced, every synapses in his brain firing rapidly on all cylinders, attempting desperately to announce to Sherlock over and over in case it wasn't abundantly clear that
A burst of laughter falls from John's mouth, Mike's excitement always absurdly contagious. "Is that so?"
And then Sherlock stood and turned around and John thanked god he was sitting down as he felt his knees weaken. He was yet again, dressed to the nines, in a black, nicely fitted suit, a dark purple button-down peaking from beneath, the buttons hanging open loosely at the collar. John's dream from the night before came rushing back and he did his very best not to blush, or cross his legs tellingly, seeing flashes of Sherlock's head tossed back, mouth falling open, eyes closed, panting John's name... Christ Almighty. Get it together.
Attempting to shake it off and focus on the task at hand – keeping said boy safe and sound – John finds his way through the small crowd of people, only half-heartedly acknowledging those who say hello to him, having no time for small talk this evening.
John's pounding heart lurched to one side with such adoration he thought it might rip itself from his chest and crawl right into Sherlock's body, curl up and nestle in forever.
The dream had been downright dirty and the lingering side effects of his sleeping orgasm as well as the vivid memory sent little jolts through him. He shivered, stretched and yawned, feeling somewhere between satisfied and disappointed. His imagination did well. It was the faux-realness that bothered him.
Now Sherlock is fighting so hard, fighting not to be the incoherent mess John is making him into, but good
"Oi, should we call it?" Paul shouts just as a crack of thunder practically vibrates the ground, the storm suddenly deciding to come on in full force.
"I mean, I hear this Sherlock bloke is quite brilliant," Mike interrupts, rising from his folded position and blinking with insincere concern. "Who knows
Talking about it the next morning had been a similar torture to pulling teeth. Sherlock had sat silently, giving nothing away, eyes as wide and terrified as John had ever seen them, fingers digging into his thighs so hard they were white.
"John," Sherlock cries, sucking John's thumb deep into his mouth, pressing his tongue to it as his hips jerk. "
Gasping softly at the clear neediness in Sherlock's voice, John's fingers find the hem of his shirt and pull it carefully upward, tugging it over Sherlock's head and off his arms. Sherlock closes his eyes at the tender touch, feeling exquisitely ravished under John's attentions.
"I do," John shushes him before sealing their lips together again and pressing his middle finger inside, swallowing down Sherlock's cry, "Oh god yes, I promise, I
"Victor is not unique, John," Irene rolls her eyes like this is so obvious. "There are hundreds of guys like him out there. But I can almost promise that Sherlock has never seen anyone like him before, at least not someone radiating their charm in his direction. I don't think he realizes what he's gotten into. It doesn't matter if Sherlock wants Victor or not. Victor will make sure he does." She levels her gaze, her voice deadly serious. "By any means necessary."
"Sherlock," John breathed only inches from his lips, fingers finding their way into the curls at the back of Sherlock's head, tightening their grip to tilt Sherlock's face up a bit. "Sherlock, do you-"
He said nothing. He wiped his eyes, pulled out of Sherlock's grasp and left the room, the door closing loudly, sealing the one thing John wanted and knew he could never have behind it.
John hesitates, lingering on his side of the bed, the side that has smelled only of him for months on end, before he turns, rolling out of the bed, feet landing softly on the hardwood.
. John can't stifle the moan he lets slip from his lips, those words coming out so much filthier than they should be.
"Pfffft no," Sherlock said with a shake of his head, looking at John from under lidded eyes. He took a step forward and wobbled, falling forward.
John's face felt suddenly hot as he realized he was watching a crime take place. Before he knew what to do, Sherlock stood, picked up his bag, pushed open the door and slipped into the building.
With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock settles in as his family begins to open the remainder of their presents, though he never quite lets the little white box out of his grasp for too long, barely paying attention to the rest of the gifts that he opens because he's already gotten the best thing in the world. And it's from
is quite mesmerizing during the game would be a more apt way of putting it. John Watson was born to play this sport and it shows as he dominates the field and all the players in his path. He sprints and jumps and tackles and yells in this ridiculously sexy captain voice and Irene has to place a finger under Sherlock's chin to close his mouth for him. Twice.
John snorted and laid his hands atop Sherlock's. "No sex, Sherlock," John said kindly, removing Sherlock's wandering fingers from his waist. "Just sleeping. Come on."
"Oh yeah, it's about supper time, isn't it?" Mike grins knowingly with a wink and Sherlock refuses to react, though the capillaries in his cheeks don't seem to get the memo as they allow blood to fill them rapidly.
And much like the last 48 hours have gone, Sherlock's fingers take on a life of their own replying with an easy
Lestrade crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow at Sherlock, making it clear he wouldn't be changing his mind.
"Oh, actually, speaking of Sherlock," Mike drops his voice slightly, glancing quickly around to make sure the rest of the team is out of earshot. "I, uh, talked to Paul earlier. I let him know Victor isn't welcome at my house."
He swallows hard on a pained squeak as he bites his tongue. He has no idea if John was here for him or not. He shouldn't have said anything. It's so stupid, he should-
"You search in the correct locations," Sherlock mumbles back out to the street and away from Victor, properly ready for this conversation to be over so he can get on with more pressing matters of his day. Like the fact that a sweaty and probably soaking wet John Watson is just across that street there, and if he could get away from this inane conversation, he might just get a glimpse of strong thighs and ripped biceps and damp, blonde, beautiful hair-
"Cock?" John supplies, smirking as he flicks his wrist and slides his finger lower, brushing just over the sensitive, puckering skin of Sherlock's entrance. "You've been thinking about my cock, haven't you? Thinking about me… fucking you?"
"Alright!" Lestrade called and Sherlock smirked, turning back smugly. The Sergeant ran a hand through his hair and sighed. "Alright. Alright, fine. Come on then." He glanced between Sherlock and John. "Both of you."
And a little sentiment promptly grows exponentially in the span of a single breath and his heart lurches harshly in his chest as blue eyes suddenly snap open and find his, raw and deep and strong, laying bare every emotion going on his John's blond head, finding his own thoughts mirrored in those gorgeous eyes.
The last word trickles breath along Sherlock's nose and he only just realizes how close they are and how softly their speaking to each other, hands clasped together on the table, foreheads practically touching. "How will we know?" Sherlock whispers into the small space between them, gaze on John's lips as the blond responds.
John brought his mouth down to trail in between Sherlock's pectorals, planting wet kisses along his breast bone, snaking his tongue out to lave over the skin. Sherlock stayed close, his hand finding the back of John's head, riding the motion of his mouth against his body, breathing heatedly in John's ear, panting as John tongued at his nipple.
John looked away. He couldn't look into those eyes anymore. Couldn't hear words like that come out of that mouth anymore. He couldn't
"He's my Chemistry partner and I'm tutoring him," Sherlock spits dangerously, face darkening with anger, freezing John in place with the ferocity of his words. "I'm incapable of making friends." Ice blue eyes trail down John's body pointedly, hurt almost entirely masked by the cold, cutting glare of disappointment mixed with fury, Sherlock's beautifully sharp features becoming something almost unrecognizable as John watches him all but shudder back into himself, closing off any entrance John had hoped he had. "Obviously."
John's voice and look was firm and Sherlock had no energy to argue. He tried to give a stern look in return, but failed when his eyes instead closed and he turned and trudged back to his room.
John's heart feels like it's suddenly too big to be housed between his lungs as he watches his roommate sleep, making his ribcage feel like it's about to burst open at any moment with every emotion he feels for the stunning boy he's wrapped up with, everything he's been attempting to shove deep down and away currently bubbling right back to the surface easily, rolling through him calmly, reminding him of exactly what he's been wanting for all these months and allowing him to bask in the fact that he now has it.
"I don't-what?" John said, still stunned. "Sherlock, I don't…this doesn't change the way I feel about you at all. And I don't… that's not- I just wanted to know what you were doing," he finished lamely.
Tears prickle the corners of Sherlock's eyes, utter humiliation and complete gratitude warring for dominance inside of him, practically tearing him in two with the strength of each emotion rocking his slender body as he coughs up more sharp liquid, the fiery bite of the alcohol still present in the taste on the way back up.
"Lucky you didn't kill either of us," John scolds, making his way cautiously back to his side of the room, eyeing the floor for any stray shards of glass. "I would have murdered you if you had."
It's John who shifts first, walking Sherlock slowly back toward the bed until he can lay him down in the sheets, crawling over top of him and descending upon his lips again, and John's weight is more than welcome, pressed chest to thigh and slowly sinking Sherlock back into the mattress. It's warm and soft against Sherlock's recently cleaned sheets, the air crackling with anticipation and promise and intention between them as naked flesh rolls against naked flesh. Fingers slide between Sherlock's slender digits and tug, pulling both his hands up and over his head, and Sherlock groans as John presses his palms to Sherlock's and holds him down on the bed, nipping at his lower lip. The genius boy's hips roll at their own accord and John's cock slots in beside his, sending sparks of real pleasure racing all along Sherlock's body, the dimly lit coals stoking in his belly suddenly lighting on fire at the touch.
"I really have no answers as to why our sweet little Johnny here is wasting his precious time on our mysterious TA," Link said. "Maybe for a good grade?"
He doesn't love to admit he's been with other people, especially to the boy he wants so badly, but he knows it's important for Sherlock to know.
That gets the boy's attention immediately. Sherlock snaps his head up, eyes skittering across John's face to find his eyes. "What?"
John is… known here. Famous, even. Girls falling all over themselves for his attention, everyone greeting him excitedly. It's so obvious, and so something Sherlock hadn't even considered before and the urge to whack himself in the forehead for his clear stupidity is a strong one that he has to resist with effort.
"Ah," Sherlock sneers in response, "I see you and Greg have made up, then? How pedestrian, fighting with each other over
"Hey you," John calls. "Tie him up and come on over. We're trying something a little different today."
He can't find the right answer so instead Sherlock inhales deeply once more in an attempt to steady his galloping heart and make sense of the information he's been given, still nothing feeling quite real.
The water ran down his aching body in smooth streams, bringing John back around to himself again slowly. He closed his eyes and inhaled, the steam helping to clear his foggy head. He didn't want to face Sherlock. Not while he was like this. Why wasn't he home being pitiful in the privacy of his own loo? Why did he have to wake up like this in Sherlock's flat? When was he going to stop having such mortifying moments in front of Sherlock Holmes?
The doors to the outside world swing open and the serenity Sherlock had just been appreciating slowly obliterates into nothing as the quiet around them explodes into hundreds of cheering fans all melding together into one steady cry. Whipping his head around to the left, Sherlock stares up at the rather modest university stadium, the bleachers lining the field currently packed with fans mainly in various shades of red, mouths open as another wave of cheers erupts for whatever is happening on the field. Sherlock finds himself craning his neck slightly to see if he can catch a glimpse of anything or anyone.
"We'd pay the property cost," Sherlock suddenly says. He doesn't know when he's gotten on board with this plan but he wants that horribly sad look on John's face to go away. "We'd pay for them to stay here and pay whatever it cost to keep them."
Hands are tucking under his arms and hauling him back to his feet before he can register what's happening and Sherlock tries to remember how to breathe properly.
All the worst emotions about the best moment of Sherlock's life flit across John's features and a tiny crack ripples down the center of Sherlock's heart.
, you moron!" Irene barks rather loudly before ducking her head again, rechecking her surroundings. "You can't be this blind? Seriously, all he does every time we meet up is eye-fuck the shit out of you and it's honestly repulsive and I'm over it. He's so
. Out in the cold. Alone. All alone. The happiest, nicest, best person Sherlock had ever known lived here. In this dark, dirty, smelly place, all by himself, just barely surviving day by day, having no idea where his next meal would come from or if this space would even be safe when he came back.
"Captain's orders," Mike replies quickly, shooting a quick glance at Paul before continuing. "Says we've got to go at least toss the ball around a bit even if it's an off day. Now come
John's face had snapped up to catch Sherlock's facial expression, eyes scanning all over his features, searching for something that told him not to go. Something that would tell him that Sherlock didn't approve. That Sherlock wouldn't allow him to go.
Sherlock swallows a laugh of his own. Not so simple but he'll do what he can. "I'm a consulting detective."
"Yeah, yeah alright. I'm actually headed over there now, so I better get going." Mike stood up and walked to the door.
Sherlock's lips brushed over John's temple in a soft caress, once, twice, and a third time before trailing to his cheek, laying another kiss there. He made his way in a line down the side of John's face, dropping gentle touches of lips to his jaw and just below his ear, down his neck, to his collarbone. He took the skin between his lips and sucked gently, licking to soothe it under his touch. John let his head fall back onto Sherlock's shoulder, giving over to every sensation Sherlock was eliciting in his body, deciding nothing that felt this good could be wrong. Not when the person doing these things meant so much to the person on the receiving end.
A whimper escapes Sherlock's lips, the heat of John's words clearly almost too much for him. John feels a wicked need take over and glides his fingers feather-like over Sherlock's skin. Just as Sherlock is relaxing against the touch, John reaches his nipple and twists.
"Yeah maybe," John murmured. He felt Mike's eyes on him but he refused to meet them. He didn't want to have this conversation. Again.
, the aroma of Mrs. Holmes' famous hot buttered rum mixed with the undertones of the fire surely crackling away in the sitting room making Sherlock's eyes flutter a bit with the familiarity of it all. The spicy scent of nutmeg and cinnamon swirl themselves in and the youngest Holmes can practically
John's head was swimming, the sudden change in the conversation throwing him off, and disappointing the hell out of him. Weren't they just talking about going back to this guy's house for a shag? A very long, dirty weekend of shagging? John wanted to go back to that. He wanted that. God did he want that.
"He talks about Sherlock," Paul says urgently, looking directly into John's eyes and begging him to understand how important this is. "Not anything bad, but he just talks about him a lot. Mentions they're going to study, off-handedly says he's going to see him in class, sometimes asks me if I've seen him around lately. Sometimes he asks about you, too. About you and then immediately says he's seeing Sherlock right after he asks. It's like he wants me to put two and two together, you know? Like he wants me to be telling you that he's seeing Sherlock."
"Then you're in for a treat, doll," he laughed and set to work on pouring what seemed to be every type of alcohol into a twisted glass. "My specialty for first timers. I call it the Cherry Popper."
, if you want to," John assures, taking Sherlock's calmer body language as an opening to reach out again for his hand. "I hope you know I'm here whenever you need me. For… anything really."
John's eyes flickered to those clear eyes. Was that an invitation? John couldn't be sure. He shuffled back and forth on his feet uncomfortably, unable to throw himself out there again.
John took off like a shot, practically running toward the exit, not letting this boy get away from him.
It's a word he would use for his faux-John in his head as well. Romantic. In his head, his John is romantic and thoughtful and lovely.
"About what?" John is starting to get anxious now. Nothing about this conversation or situation is sitting right with him.
The fact that John hadn't fainted in sheer arousal was a bloody miracle in itself. Sherlock rode a motorcycle. Sherlock had a tongue ring. Sherlock played the fucking violin. "S-sorry, what?" he stammered, still reeling, and again mentally kicking himself.
Sherlock ignores the ache in his chest and instead focuses on the game he needs to win, much like his prize is currently doing.
But today, John was letting the curiosity get the better of him. Today, he wasn't standing idly by. Enough was enough. If Sherlock had some lover in secret, John felt like he had a right know. Of course, he really didn't, but too fucking bad. He wasn't going to let this go. It was driving him up the wall, panic and fear and stress all eating at him since this secrecy started. He didn't like it. He didn't like not knowing if, at some point soon, Sherlock would stop being his. He didn't like the possibility that Sherlock could have possibly found someone else to spend time with. He didn't like that Sherlock could have found someone to date, to shag, and to love. Someone that wasn't John. He didn't like the possibility of that
John's body temperature skyrocketed as he took in this gorgeous human being he had absolutely no business being interested in the way he was. Average at best, John bit down hard on his lip and stood a little straighter.
None of his friends look quite as worried as John feels, in fact the three of them seem to exchange a silent conversation amongst themselves, eyeing each other knowingly with tiny smirks and glittering eyes like there is some private joke being passed around that John isn't privy to. "What?" he demands, a bit irritated at the mockery.
"I…" Sherlock clears his throat, staring down at his feet. "I didn't mean to make this mess and I… it won't happen again."
"I know," John agrees. "And now I want you to trust yourself. Because I trust you and I think you're wonderful. And there is nothing you can do or say that will change my mind about that."
Hours later, after sobbing and sniveling on the floor of their once shared bedroom, feeling so unbelievably helpless and useless, John made his way weakly to the shower and stepped under the scalding water, hoping maybe he could burn the ache right out of his skin.
Gliding his hands up his sides, Sherlock finds John's shoulder blades, laying palms against them and pulling him impossibly closer, which is still not close enough. He spreads his thighs, pulling his knees up on either side of John's fit frame, silently asking, practically begging with a roll of his hips.
The warm ember that had lodged itself in John's chest the first week he'd met Sherlock gets hotter and brighter, glowing pleasantly, making his insides tingle with happiness.
Mm that sounded promising. He could let Sherlock take charge, no problem. He tried to open his eyes, waiting for Sherlock to take him. He felt strong hands on him and he groaned. Sherlock told him not to speak and he knew how to follow orders, but he wasn't so sure he could keep all the noises he wanted to make at bay. He would try though. For Sherlock. Because gorgeous Sherlock asked.
. He's bad at this. This social thing. He'd prefer not to embarrass himself in front of John this early in the night. He's certain that'll come later, anyhow.
The whimper that escapes Sherlock's mouth is the only answer John needs as he wraps his fingers around Sherlock's cock.
Jesus, John can't think about the word fine any longer, the word no longer holding any meaning in his head but just the garbled sound it's become as he repeats it over and over. He scrubs a hand down his face as his thoughts spin, wishing so much that he'd sent a text similar to something he's texted to Sherlock before so he'd be able to read between the lines and find out what exactly is going through Sherlock's mind and gage any hidden meanings.
Sherlock wants to make some stupid joke about it to make John laugh. Tease John about how much he must hate those crutches and that stupid cast. He wants to laugh and laugh with John until they're intertwined, finding each other again.
The genius boy grins. "Trust me, I would have done my best. Watching you get hit was... unpleasant. But I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to see you."
And he didn't want to hurt anyone. That wasn't the point of his personal life. He'd just never wanted more. He enjoyed sex, he was very skilled at sex, and his partners were always well aware of what encounters with Sherlock entailed. He didn't do it to be cruel, he was always upfront about it and it wasn't some big surprise afterward that he didn't want to date them. He saw no benefit or interest in a relationship before. And even if he did now, he was certain he was incapable of such a thing.
. John Watson had been his very best friend for ten long years, navigating the treacherous waters of primary and secondary school, attached at the hip, the closest of mates. Sherlock was there when John got his first note from a girl in their class. John was there when Sherlock got his first punch to the face. Sherlock was there when John kissed Heidi Jameson behind the fence at lunchtime. John was there when Sherlock decided he'd never kiss a girl as long as he lived. Sherlock was there when John's parents decided to get a divorce. John was there when Mycroft moved out. Sherlock was there when John's mother started drinking. John was there when Redbeard died. Sherlock was there when John made the Varsity rugby team. John was there when Sherlock was accepted into the gifted and talented program at school. Sherlock was there when Harry came out. John was there when Sherlock was first called a freak.
And when Sherlock finally slid into him, it didn't feel like John had been waiting forever for Sherlock to start. It felt like Sherlock had been slowly, softly making love to him the entire time. And beyond a stretching, filling feeling, it didn't hurt. It felt right; perfect even. Like John couldn't believe they hadn't been doing this the whole time. Like his whole world was now complete.
is what normal teenagers do? Google their injuries and figure out how to take care of them on their own?"
He rolls over and wills the world to end before he has to see John Watson take Mary Morstan to formal.
John, in another more fierce wave of panic, reached for him before he could go to far. "No!" he cried, shaking his head, eyes flying open to find Sherlock's features crinkled in concern. "N-no, please," he whispered. "Just... maybe we get underneath the covers?"
, a twenty-year-old Sherlock had gotten a call. A precious, tearful, breathless call, his twenty-two-year-old lover on the other end sobbing softly.
"What? Are you a jealous ex or something?" Why had he said that? Well, if it wasn't obvious where his mind was, it would be now.
John stood up abruptly and Sherlock almost jumped at the sudden movement. He'd been far to absorbed in those deep blue eyes.
subtly whatsoever and even going a pretty shade of pink, John still smiles back like this interaction is something he'll remember for a long time.
John had sat silently on the ride back to Baker Street that night after the pool and Moriarty and the semtex vest blowing up. They'd just barely made it inside when John had grabbed Sherlock by his coat lapels, thrown him against the door and pressed his mouth insistently against his, murmuring nonsensical things like
"Yeah, I know," John laughs, following him up to a sitting position much slower, "get back here so I can give you a Christmas cuddle."
And finally, as his hips falter and halt, Sherlock pulls that gorgeous mouth of his off John's shaft with a pop.
he did. He loved John, maybe loved him almost immediately upon meeting him, their connection so strong from the start, even as he denied it himself, and now… now here they were, together, and Sherlock simply couldn't bring himself to blurt out those three words on a rather, unremarkable day like today, after getting a blowjob of all things, and just, no. No, he needed to do this properly. He needed to wait.
It's a beautiful sound. Sherlock has an overwhelming want to taste it, lick right into John's mouth and savor it.
John had sensed something was being held back. Being the brilliant future-doctor that he was, he didn't push it and Sherlock was grateful. He'd decided at the start of this with John that he would carefully drop only one bomb at a time about himself. He forced down the panic that welled up within him, knowing all the things he'd have to reveal. Like he'd told John, they would cross those bridges when they got to them. He had a bad feeling Mycroft had given John one solid shove toward one of them already. Sherlock would be prepared when he asked.
