He smirked in response, choosing to take a sip of wine instead. The smirk felt extremely familiar – nostalgia hit me in waves, but
"You're welcome, mate. Though, there will be no presents for ten more years or so, mind you" he said, merriment in his eyes. This was what Sherlock preferred best. A nice time with a friend.
Sherlock was not allowed to examine the bodies in the mortuary (Molly Hooper finally grew a backbone. Bad for Sherlock). However, Sherlock was given full access to the hotel room. Hotel rooms were his favourite to deduce. While rooms in a house told a lot about the people in them, hotel rooms revealed nothing and Sherlock had always loved a challenge. He furtively went through the suitcase.
"Your mother had a lot to answer for" she said, trying to lighten the mood.
at that moment.
He dials a number on his phone.
"I'm William and you are Hamish" Sherlock said, readying himself for another explosion. It did not come. Clearly, John was too tired to argue.
I do thank people, John. Only when they deserve my gratitude. – SH
"Nothing!" I lie. I didn't want the world to know before Sherlock.
John: (draft) Why Sherlock
John: (draft) I love you, Sherlock Holmes.
John: (draft) She actually kind of reminds me of you?
That would set it off
Finally, at long last, John realizes that I cannot turn off the bomb. His expression turns angry.
"Promise me more Hamish and my mouth will be shut till asked" William finally managed to say, some of the mischief coming back into his eyes.
So, I stared at him openly while he packed away his things, a few girls helping him. He quickly shook them off, and took me to a nearby restaurant.
My mind whirs back to the first time I met this incredible man. . I would never forget that day. That day has changed my life forever, in ways John can never understand. I must remember to transfer that memory to my new mind palace.
"I'll deal with you later" he growled.
I did not know what to do. I decided to stay in a hotel. I was too much of a coward to face John after what happened. I needed time to process. I needed time to ponder over Mycroft's challenge. I needed time to know what exactly I felt about John Watson. I decide to make my new mind palace. I would need it for whatever Mycroft was planning next. I close my eyes. I am instantly transported to a castle in the country. I walk on the green grass, enjoying the wind on my face. My castle was crumbling and was filled with moss. I go inside.
And illegal.
merciful” the spark in Tom’s eyes returned. “You are not allowed to speak nor use your hands – we will be monitoring” he said, pointing to the cameras. A huge Cheshire grin spread on his face, once he saw the discomfort of his contestants.
Indeed he had.
"Do I know you?" the words spilled out before I could stop them.
Sherlock: (draft) It really is over then. I had hoped the train would change things. It has. But only for me.
"So, what do you think?" he asked bluntly. He did not mince words, this one. And on some deep level, I already knew this about him.
SHSHSH
I go to Marylebone Road twenty minutes before whatever John was going to do there. I make my way into the restaurant. My mind was telling me that John made a reservation knowing that I would be back.
"Mrs. Hudson. Untie me at once! I swear I will not kill myself!"

with excitement. The woman literally was jumping and down her seat, clutching the paper that denoted their number. John braced himself for their groans.
(6:17 p.m.) And I didn't want to impose myself on you. God knows I do that enough already.
SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHS
Please stop this madness, Sherlock. I don't even know what to believe in right now.
. I have reasons to believe that their manager, , is part of a smuggling ring." Mr. Sagarson's voice became a little quicker here "I can't say anything for sure Mr. Holmes. He keeps carrying a different suitcase everyday. Strange people come to the set for him and it is always to drop off a bag. I found some antique cups in his room once. He leaves for a notoriously long amount of time and always carries a bag. I can't go to the police with this. The band's reputation..."
I smile and pretend. I did not want people suffering because of me. I knew, firsthand how it felt.
I flinch. I never liked birthdays. When I was a kid, I always looked forward to birthday. But after a year or two, I got irritated. People never bought you what you truly wanted. The day was full of fake cheery people who wished you a happy birthday. Mycroft was the only one who knew I wanted. Not because he pays attention to me, because he gives attention to everything. I stopped celebrating birthdays as soon as I realized no one ever pays attention to what I really like.
"What were you whispering to Agatha?"
John: How's are my girls doing? :)
"Three weeks"
E: Just checking up on old friends! How about you, Doctor?
"That's what they all say" he said, in a bored tone. This guy sure had a lot of ego. I smiled.
John: (draft) I look at the stars and I like to think one of them is you.
"A surprise party is the ultimate insult to a detective" he said, since they still looked confused.
"I'm sorry I have a boring life. I can't be…." She starts irritated, but stops, and her eyes widen.
Who was I kidding? I was dying to watch it.
"We'll still be doing this" John said, trying to gauge a reaction from Sherlock.
A dark, secluded factory
This case was a ten then. Since Sherlock couldn't solve it entirely. (The part about it being fake?)
You were the best and the wisest man that I have ever known.
"You don't drink wine." I furrowed my eye-brows. How did I know that?
"So, will you come? There will be cake" she giggled
For the first time, Sherlock's face turns confused.
Sherlock searched through the not-relevant information rooms in his mind palace....And came up empty handed.
John: (draft) Why do I still think about you?
"Ladies and gentlemen. Family and friends. And….others"
Inside, the old man looks up. The old man looks no longer older. His hunchback is gone. His eyes sparkle with a radiance that comes with genius. Agent Delta's footsteps might echo like the gong of death, but the old man was Satan.
(4:14 p.m) No, I meant like, what are your feelings towards him?
There was suddenly silence for which John was very grateful. He blinked again, his vision slowly becoming normal. He then realised the cause for silence.
Question one: How did he get in?
“Okay, alright. The game is simple. Find your partner. Pull the rope. Got it?”
I see his body, a crumpled mess of what is my world. The blood is everywhere and I rush to check his pulse. I wait. No pulse. I wait. Still no pulse. I'm ready to hold his hand until his heart beats again or mine stops. I wait. I wait until they pull me away from my one true love. I can't leave him. I can't. My entire world has collapsed. Both my legs hurt this time but I hardly feel the pain. I feel numb, there's only one thought in my head: How do I get Sherlock back?

I begin yelling, my mind racing with the possibility of death. I am scared for my life and Sherlock's.
He turned to me, his expression told me that he was about to rant. He did not disappoint.
Sherlock: Got a case, Lestrade? Could really use one right now. SH
"Well, I looked up Mr. Simmons." Sherlock said, breaking the silence that seemed to have conjured istelf. "He has a record. I think, John, he might be part of that dark flower group.." Sherlock raised his eyebrows to warn John about not giving the name
“I am so worried about your eye-make up!” She fretted, while tying it from behind.
Ah. Denial.
List the likely sources where you'll find what you need
So, Sherlock, bring me closer
"Mr. Holmes, I'm Phil Sagarson. I'm currently the director to a musical video of a very prominent band which I can't name yet..."
Really, John? I expected something more along the lines of my…never mind. Favourite color…I already told you I have no favorites! It's illogical, preferring something over the other for no reason. However, purple appeases my eyes, to answer your question – SH
excited to have you all here. The crew had a lot of fun planning all this. We are going to have four rounds - each testing your understanding, your co-operation and like the song says, your knowledge of each other. Your first task begins this afternoon - so, I say, get some rest guys! Agatha will guide you to your rooms. Agatha?"
Oh, okay then. I'll use this opportunity to get to know you. It's only fair, considering how much you know about me – JW
John: (draft) I love you, but I have to go now.
"Thank you"
Molly is single. I refuse to romaticise her in this fic. She can't ask for someone's heart while she can't give them hers. She knows this and slowly accepts it. Hamish does not know that Molly loved/s Sherlock.
13:05
Sherlock had had many bad mornings. This would probably replace the one currently in second place. God, he hated to be confused. He, Sherlock Holmes,

Unsure, I open a bottle of scotch and quench my fears. Dealing with all of it would be worth it only if I could see Sherlock again. Even if it's on a television screen. I put the DVD in and press play.
"Okay..."
12:55
(1:24 p.m.) No, go tell him that, you big idiot!
John: (draft) You SWORE you would protect her.
Attention-Seekers.
Ok, I can't think of a question. You ask me – JW
Sherlock entered. The atmosphere was awkward, nothing like the easygoing attitude before. John looked at Sherlock for something to say while Sherlock waited for John. They both stared at each other, not wanting to break the moment.
“Get set” said Diana.
When's your birthday? – JW
Recap:
Oh! I see what you did there – JW
Previous chapter - Chainsmokers.
So, what do we do?
My face is completely devoid of emotion. I can't talk. I wonder if I should pretend that I didn't hear her.
I know, John. – SH
"Yeah"
We then talked about the people to be invited. It had to be a select number of people. People whom he genuinely cared about and people who genuinely cared about him. Mrs. Hudson was on top of the list. Lestrade. Mike Stamford. She suggests Mycroft.
Sherlock, what are you doing?
"Oh good"
"Bye John, see you next week." Ella relaxed when he closed the door behind himself. Glad that one of her most stubborn patients was finally showing an interest in improving his situation, even if she had to threaten him into doing it.
anything right away" he told himself, trying to think about the matter in hand.
Sherlock: (draft) Your yells still haunt me at night.
She nods, undoubtedly pleased. The Prime Minister enters. Mycroft tries not to deduce anything about him. His needed his brain power for the issue in hand.
John, I wish I was there to tell you this. Meeting you has been one of the best things that ever happened to me. Would you like to have dinner with me? And, yes, not takeover. Like a date. –SH
John sat in the waiting room, going through The Hindu, an Indian newspaper, while waiting for Ella to call him in. He sighed - despite being a doctor, he never really fully trusted therapy. He knew Ella had no clue about what was going in his head. The only reason he was still in this tropical country, waiting in an air-conditioned room to be called, was because he was ordered to. After the Ghazi attack, John was ordered to stay in India for the next nine months, trying to improve his mental and physical health. His shoulder was almost normal, his mind was not.
(9:43 p.m.) Oh, Sherlock. We are here for you.
Mrs Turner: This is Mrs. Hudson, boys. Sherlock, what have you done to the kitchen now? This is going in your rent. By the way, nice entry John, never knew you were philosophical.
Sherlock: (draft) Mycroft says death makes people like you. It's a strange feeling, looking at your own coffin.
She rummaged through the drawers, her mind, no doubt, whirring with different ideas. She took out a contouring palette and looked at his face again. She shook her head in defeat after a minute. She ended up highlighting his cheekbones and outlining his lips and eyes.
Yeah, I know
"Oh, you noticed that? I merely told her I could help if she was being abused at home. Which she is"
This was
"I'm sorry?" Mr. Sagarson said, clearly confused. He did not understand the one word argument the couple were presently having. Or what triggered it. All he knew was that Mr. Holmes turned to that doctor and it just broke out.
I see him. John. Alone at the table. He was early. For one moment, my façade of calm disappears. I am scared, very scared. For the first time, I wonder:
He stared towards his armchair, horror clearly written upon his face. He realised what happened. There was only one teabag which was left uninspected. It was sitting in his cup, having provided Mycroft his deduction and Sherlock his tea. He opened the teabag; take care as to not tear any note present inside. In the middle, wrapped in thin sheet of plastic, was John's next note. Sherlock heaved a small sigh of relief he did not know he was holding.
contest. So, are you guys reaaady?"
All the other couples were either overly excited about meeting the band or too determined to win. They were whispering to each other and John caught the gist of their conversations.
Goodnight John – MH
Sherlock: (draft) I'm so so sorry John.
John re-imagined the scene, him being the thief. He just pulled the pin out of the stand. The laser surrounding the stand would have set off the alarms as soon as his fingers touched the pin. Now, what? Thirty policemen would surround him in thirty seconds. Where would John hide in this precious thirty seconds? He glances around the room. The room is filled with ceramics, paintings, statues, metalwork, jewelry and lots more. Could he have posed as one of the statues?
Attention. He knew what my favorite color was. He knew that I hated him shooting the walls. He knew of my adrenaline fix, he knew of my days in the Army, he knew how I injured my shoulder. He knew the things that would set me off. He knew how to calm me. Once, I was beyond mad at him when I found an eyeball in the cup I poured my coffee in. I was about to drink it! He didn't apologize, he just ran, yes ran, out of 221 B when I yelled at him. However, I found a new office chair in the consultation room of the hospital. It took me an hour to trace it back to Sherlock (he came in disguised but I could recognize him in the video feed). How he knew I hated the chair, I will never know. Funny thing was, I never told him any of this. He knew, though.
Sherlock looked at his presents, overwhelmed by the love of his friends. He turned to thank John once again. Only problem, John wasn't there. He went to his bedroom, clutching Mycroft's present with him.
Attention. Simple, really. Poets and authors went to a lot of trouble to describe love. But, really, it all boils down to the amount of attention you gave to a person.
Sherlock: (draft) I don't hate you John. Never will.
13:12
I spot some wires going under the seats. I started removing the seats. And, sure enough, the bomb was there. Neatly covered up. I realized that the bomb wasn't in the carriage – the bomb was the carriage. I roll my eyes. What a show-off. I soon figured out where the time fuze of the bomb was.
12:56
No, Sherlock
Tom put his hand on the lid of the box, smiling cheekily at all of them.
"Never race without protection"
Sherlock: Obviously.
"Look at that woman in red heels. Obviously cheating. And, the guy currently on the phone? He's gay but doesn't know how to tell his wife"
Sherlock: (draft) I love you, John Watson.
I'd be lost without my blogger
John: (draft) I keep seeing your face in the papers. You don't miss me even a little bit, do you?
"A repeated lie becomes the truth" Sherlock replied, now opening the curtains to let the sunlight hit John's face.
I look at Sherlock. Who did he think he was kidding? Sherlock thought he could deceive me? Sherlock wasn't talking about London. He was talking about a very specific John Watson. I don't say a word. Sherlock himself suggested the removal of the ring, but he seemed confident that John would still love him.
"…I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could have the misfortune to meet…" Sherlock went on.
. In me, Hamish, you always have a friend. You always have a shoulder to cry on and a voice of hope.
(6:10 p.m.) If this plan includes identifying him and apologizing face to face, I swear I will kill you Sherlock.
(1:09 p.m.) Johnny, Johnny
The crew smiled at the couples who looked as shocked as they were when their number was called out. They cheered loudly and soon each of the artists picked a couple.
E: Well, everyone can't be a Holmes, can we? Some of us have to stick to good ol' stalking. :)
John: Haha true.

The band members played a song called

John: (draft) Thank you God.
"Here, let me help you with that" William said, reaching for John's wig. Their fingers touched - just like they did a million times before. But, something was different this time. John could feel his heart thumping out loud. He remained very still, not knowing what to do.
John: (draft) Those two years were a test aren't they? A test of my loyalty. I failed and this is my punishment. A punishment I fully deserve.
12:46
"Could be, but WHY THE HELL am I to suffer? Be the bloody make-up artist!" John yelled.
"I fell in my own pit. I did not realize what was missing."
You were an adorable baby, with your two dimples and black hair. You inherited my hair and my blue eyes but you inherited John's height (don't tell your father I said that). John tells me I spent three days merely looking at you after you were born. Not surprising, really. You, Hamish, defy all logic. For no rational reason, I fell in love with you as soon as I saw you. You've given me the best gift there is Hamish – parenthood.
his first feeling. He looked mostly like himself (just the blond wig was a bit weird). His face looked a little younger because of lesser wrinkles. Upon further inspection, John found that Sherlock found no reason to conceal a slightly noticeable scar near his ear. He easily could have but he chose not to. John felt something rise in his chest, something he couldn't explain. He somehow remembered something Sherlock has said a long while ago:
My heart skips a beat. He once told me that his work was everything to him. That he was married to it. And, I had believed that for a very long time. Was it possible that Sherlock could love me? Was it possible that he would show emotion? When it clouded his judgment? Suddenly, I'm a lot more hopeful. My stomach is filled with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Hope fills my heart and suddenly the world seems a lot more beautiful. I hug a pillow and smile like an idiot.
"No, Mike's great. But, he is not my best friend"
Why did I fall for him? Easy, really. Attention. Seriously, who could not fall for the amount of attention he showed, despite my sexuality, despite everything?
Two or three people groaned at his puns. John had to admit – they were so bad that they were good.
What was his reason? Ah yes, it was very "funny". Funny? FUNNY? Was that what I meant to him? Someone to play a prank on? For the first time, I am broken. I broke when Sherlock fell off the roof but this was worse. A million times worse. He never really did care, did he? All that mattered to him was the game.
He searched 221 B with the thoroughness he usually spent for cases. After a search which resulted in two broken glasses and one very scared cat, Sherlock noticed an envelope right on his mantelpiece. Best place to hide – plain sight. It read:
Greg starts stuttering. I understand that he is scared as to what my reaction would be. I'm not sad actually. This was a chance to know more about Sherlock. I wouldn't have missed it for the worlds.
It was time to become Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective.
The anger subsided after a few days. But, the realization didn't. I had to move on. I couldn't let one dead man destroy my whole world. I wouldn't. I decided I'll mope around for a week every year. That week, I would lose all contact with the world, just stare dejectedly at the wall and get completely wasted. The other days, however, I decided I'll be the John I was when I was with Sherlock. Atleast, try to be that John.
(4:24 p.m) That part I understand.
John couldn't tell the exact second when he decided to do it. Actually, he had no recollection of even the merest indication of wanting to do it. John only felt his toes pointing upwards on their own accord and the next thing he knew, he had pecked William on his cheek. Both of them paused, shocked with what had occurred. John was still on his toes and his lips were still inches away from William's cheek. The faint lip (gloss? paint?) stain was slightly shining on Sherlock's face.
The easy going atmosphere turned electric in a nano-second.
“Blindfolds”
Sherlock: (draft) I miss you.
"What do you think?" John asks, casually. Internally, his heart was racing to see what Sherlock would say.
Sherlock felt many emotions – initially blindness, then confusion, later surprise and a little happiness, and finally he settled on
Part III: William Sherlock Scott Holmes and John Hamish Watson.
"John, Sherlock…"her voice broke, tears streaming her face once again. I feel guilty for shouting at her. She was going through the same thing. I realize Molly and I were in the same boat. Only difference was that was there for me while there was no one for her. I feel very sorry for her.
"Mm-hm?"
Sherlock.

It wasn't that John was cruel, or John had a history of breaking people's hearts. The first,

I see a momentary gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Maybe, Sherlock did have something in his mind palace. Sherlock thinks hard. I could see that he was thinking in a speed he never thought in before. I pray to God that he had something in his mind palace that would help us.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes-Watson
Now that John had Sherlock out of his mind, he noticed the other couples. He didn't bother trying to remember their names, he could always ask Sherlock. They were all straight couples except for one lesbian couple - Tara and Samantha. Apparently, they were the eighth couple he did not notice. Before he could analyze further, the director began talking.

He heaved a sigh of relief after the contouring nightmare was finally over. Ruby then proceeded to his eyes and lips with careful strokes. John had to appreciate her patience and accuracy. She worked on him slowly while John could only impatiently wait to open his eyes. He finally opened his eyes to see Ruby washing her brushes nearby, giggling a little while William looked sheepish. He looked at himself in the mirror and disbelief

"John dear, you need to wake up now. John"
Sherlock increased his pace, clearly not happy with how things were. John was a little worried too, he wanted to win so
with considerable success. He was really into game shows, this man.
Sherlock: (draft) This is the problem with getting attached to someone. I feel so lost without you.
(6:12 p.m.) You know I live so much at your place I should just move in.
“Congratulations, Tony and Hannah! You go to Round twooooo” Tom announced, in midst of the celebratory phrases the band were yelling in the background.
"Now, honestly, tell me Sherlock, you like John. Like you like your friends. Yes or no?"
Sherlock: (draft) I'm mad at myself actually.
The sadness of the truth hits me.
"But he didn't take anything else, like the platinum chain for example"
John: (draft) I'm sorry, I really shouldn't be doing this.
It does not mean I know how to diffuse a giant bomb! What about you?
Sherlock had forgotten what he had intended to say. Shit. He was turning into those bloody teenage girls in those movies again. He collected his composure
"Look at her heels!"
(4:11 p.m) John!
Sherlock could not do it anymore. He left, pulling on his cloak.
Someone snorted and it took Tom considerable control to not giggle.
"Bugger"
The realization hits me hard. We were going to die.
For the first time, my brain worked in a speed that could rival Sherlock's. All the decisions that I had made, all the things that I could have done better, all the things that I was yet to do…they all came crashing down in my mind. My memories with Harry, my regret about Harry's drinking, the fallout between Dad and Harry because of her sexuality, my Mom's cooking, my school days, my girlfriends, my college days, days in the Army, meeting Sherlock. Sherlock. As I walked down memory lane in the speed of light, I realized I wasn't angry at Sherlock. There was no point in being angry with him now. I felt gratitude for the man who was now going to kill me. Without Sherlock, every day would have felt like death. I was a breathing corpse before I met Sherlock. And, if this was what I had to pay, I would do it.
Ok. Your turn. – SH
Look, I find it difficult. I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.
"TELL ME!"
"So, how did you figure it out? The double murder"
(1:15 p.m.) I am sorry, but I really don't get to say it much.
"Love? Of course he does not. He may have a crush on you but that will fade away. Everything fades away, Sherlock. Especially human emotions."
13:13
Before John could think about this, Agatha approached them asking them to move to the next room. John thanked Ruby for his eyes and lips (they did look a tad more seductive) to which she only giggled a little harder.
(See the end of the chapter for
(1:01 p.m.) What do you want now?
"Don't tell me you don't love a surprise" John's voice sounded behind him. Sherlock turned so fast that his neck cricked. John looked merely amused. And a little bit happy.
Use your mind palace
(9:39 p.m.) Be as it may, the first time must have been really difficult for you.
Sherlock: (draft) Have you moved on, John Watson?
"Of course not. Take this phone" he said, handing over an iPhone. He took out another phone.
13:03
"YOU MUST CARE ABOUT SOMETHING! WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIFE?" I would yell in return.
"Don't sweat it" his long-forgotten teacher's advice rang in his ears. "Let it happen and don't take rash decisions. You don't have to define your sexuality. You are allowed to live your life in whatever way you want"
You'll think of something. Oh, and I am arranging the food and alcohol. – MH
No activity in the innerzone. Over.
"Sherlock, please. I am sending you the details of our fake identites right now." Sherlock said, not looking above his phone.
“Arms behind your back” said Alexa.
"John" she begins. Her face is covered with tears. Sherlock's loss hit her too, then.
I drop my phone. It falls down, slowly, but I'm not paying attention. Did I really mean that much to John? Hope pushes me. I had to do this before I lost courage.
Ok, my turn. If you don't mind, I'll ask you the same question – SH

I remember everything about that day. The last rays of the Sun were dancing all around us, different shades of yellow colouring the city. There was a gentle breeze and just a touch of magic. A foreign place, a dream-like land with not a soul whom I knew. That's how a holiday should be. Only when you cut away real-life, you allow yourself to dream, to fantasize, to accept magic. Anyway, that was when I met him. There was something about him, something most people saw but never chose to investigate. His eyes met mine and I knew nothing would ever be the same.
I open my laptop, intending to post on my blog. I type the heading:
"John. Come back to London. I have a case for you"
The Agent nods. He pulls out his walkie-talkie and leaves the hall.
Copy that. Over.
(1:16 p.m.) You said it was a good puzzle? Finding John?
but now thanks to you, that bubble burst. You faker! So, tell me, why in God's name should I
Sherlock: There must be something, brother mine.
My eyes close against my will and before I knew it, I fell asleep.
"How do your crew members take this?" Sherlock said, after a minute of silence.
The hairs on the back of his neck rose.
Copy that. Over.
“Round One: Blindspot.” For some reason, he imitated the female voice from
"Dance, both of you"
"SURPRISE" four voices yelled and the lights turned back on.
John: You're up late.
Mr. S had a curious knack of only robbing things from museums. Treasures that belonged to the government. All the robberies Mr. S committed were neat. Simple. Elegant. No one saw him come. No one saw him go. All that remained was his signature S in the place the artifact once stood. He was seen only once, by a servant who saw him running away. His gender is the only thing they know. John was completely giddy with excitement. It wasn't everyday you meet a rival worthy of your skill set. Of course, John would be put into action only if Plan A failed.
I knew what Mrs. Hudson was referring to.
Mycroft: Anything to get out of meeting your, no doubt, god-daughter.

It wasn't easy to pretend that it was an ordinary place. It's a place which held more shadows than lights, more memories than humans. Perhaps, that was why the gentleman purchased it from her. She walked on, moving past the grey buildings, occasionally shooing animals which had made their adobe in the old buildings.
My blood is boiling right now. I'm angry at Sherlock. Angry at him for giving in. Angry at him for even thinking that I would believe what he was saying. Angry that, clever as he was, he never would realize…that I loved him.
"If you were worried"
He soon found the box of tea bags beneath the experimental apparatus in the cupboard. It took him quite some time to get the box. This, he realised, was John's way (other way - the first was yelling) of telling him how hard it was to make tea in the apartment.

The case was better than John imagined it would be. Frankly, the thief (who had been dubbed Mr. S) had gained John's respect when he stole the diamond. Bypassing Mycroft's security was no piece of cake. Pretending to be the jeweler? Amazing. All of Mycroft's guards were looking outside but not inside.
"But, now there's a new chapter…..to Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Watson"
John: (draft) I wish that I had never met you. Then, there would be no need for me to want you now. No need for crying over you. No need for heartbreak. No need for pain or tears. No need for forgotten promises. No need for trying to sleep but not being able to. No need, for everything you've done to make me feel like absolutely nothing.
11:09
I know, John. – SH
"Good morning, Hamish. Now, get ready. You need to be there in an hour. I'll come by a little later"
John felt a little tug in the area of his stomach. Never did he realise the truthfulness of the phrase "knocking your air out". His hands were itching to wrap themselves up in his hair, to explore every nook of face, to
How? I had no idea where Sherlock kept his stuff. It was very likely he threw them away in a fit of "My house is like a hard-drive". It was possible that they were in his room.
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes."
"No" John said, fully knowing what just happened.
He leaves. It is always nice, knowing your deductions were right.
"If you had known, you would have made the whole world know that you know. You would have banged open the doors with a ready quip in hand to show us all that you figured it all out" John said. Sherlock accepted defeat, that is, he did not argue further and let John take his coat to hang.
Tom immediately chirped in, reclaiming the attention of the audience.
It strikes him.
(4:23 p.m) Hmm.
John stopped in his process of pulling out of his socks.
Christmas found Mycroft, John and Agent Delta in Mycroft's office, discussing last minute tactics and going through THE PLAN. Needless to say, no one was in a festive mood.
John: On my way.
"Hi Hamish!" she said, with a genuine smile on her face.
(8:19 p.m) You like them, admit it
In retrospect, it was obvious, really. My actions have spoken louder than my words. But, the realization brought feelings so foreign to me that I staggered under their weight. Words like hope, love, relationship - that had been long forgotten, resurfaced and refused to budge out of my head. This was the very reason I refused to let emotion cloud my judgment. Emotion makes you take irrational decisions – decisions that have a basis only on gut feeling, nothing else. It was completely against what I believed and what I do. Once I let irrationality take over my head, I will become ordinary. Just like the others. I will not be able to deduce anymore – emotion will always fight to let me see the world "in a better light". There had been a reason for me remaining single, despite the attention I craved. I wanted to be different, to be special. I wanted to be a genius.
"Well?" he asked.
But most of all, for not hating you, which I know I should
"Aren't there usually biscsuits?"
(1:36 p.m.) Okay, fine. Maria is not calming down. I'll talk to you later. Babysitting is the worst!
Also note that these reports contain the following messages – messages that have been sent, messages that failed to reach the other person due to network issues and messages stored as drafts."
I punched him.
As expected, the couples beside him groaned. The man with whom John talked to earlier, looked at him with utter disbelief as John got up. He slowly made way through the disappointed crowd, trying to focus on not stamping anybody's foot. After an eternity, he reached the stage, the lights blinding him. John swore, were they going to deprive him of his five senses today? He climbed onto the stage, shaking everyone's hands, still blinded to see who it was he gave his hand to.
John was completely on board with the idea that Mary and Sherlock are good friends.
The end of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. The end of an era. Sherlock's fumbling with time fuze but I knew there was nothing that could be done. It was over. Our lives were going to end in a minute
God, how did the noise become more
Sherlock: I'm very busy at the moment. SH
"Of course. You should too. Would you like a wig? That should do it"
A/N: There are two types of bomb fuzes. An impact fuze detonates a bomb when the projectile strikes its target, and a time fuze acts after a controlled delay.
"Here again, Sherlock?" Mycroft's voice reverberates across the empty hall. As much as I detested him, he was the epitome of decision-making. He was also a great teacher. I stand opposite to him, silent.
SHSHSHSHSHSH
I smile, shaking my head a little. It was just like always. We go in.
Sherlock played his final card. He uses his ever trusted mind palace to lock the entire incident. True, he could have just told John to move out – nah, who was he kidding? Mycroft always admired Sherlock's ability to repress things (apparently, it was a good thing). However, his mind palace wasn't that secure. There were moments – teeny, fleeting moments, like the times when John smiled at him after an inappropriate joke at a crime scene, when their knees touched while riding the taxi, when John took out Sherlock's phone from his jacket, when John massaged his head. God, that was fifteen minutes in heaven and hell simultaneously. Sherlock tries- he tries really hard and
This was something I truly did not know about John. What would be his worst fear? Getting shot again? Dying early?
Mrs. Hudson shakes her head, thinking fondly of that memory. He wasn't aloof, despite what people thought of him in their first glance. He was a good man, a man who cared. A man who went through a lot. A man who liked a challenge. This, she gathered during the few times he talked to her. She knew that he cared about her. There was one time when an American had broken into the factory, trying to steal some equipment. She had confronted him, but the American tied her up, stole whatever he wanted to and left. The look on his face when he found her tied up was proof enough that he loved her. She didn't know how, but he dragged the American back, made him apologize to her and return everything that he had stolen. He was a son she wished she had.
I quickly read through the letter. Expensive local paper, typed and posted by the client himself. Afraid of hackers, since he didn't mail me this. Man of impeccable taste, expensive habits.
The living room of 221 B, Baker Street was filled with text noises for the next two minutes. A very confused night-gown clad Sherlock Holmes checked his phone, not knowing what the ruckus was about.
On the matter of love. Firstly, we do not care as to who you love. Never be scared to be who you are (I know what you prefer, and I am not disappointed) And, Hamish, do not believe, even for a single second, fairy tales are restricted to books. If you wish so, you could make your own fairytale. I know that you will be cynical, no doubt due to you uncle's training. But, let me give you an example. My life with John has been a fairy tale. True, it's unbelievable, especially since we live he life of the common couple. Yes, we fight about who gets the milk. Yes, your father had to buy two refrigerators. We bicker a lot. We are old people now, who merely drink tea and research about bees. All of this will have given you the impression that we are the most common, dull, routine couple there is. But, there is more to that, Hamish. Did you know your father killed a person for me on the very day I met him? Did you know that I asked him help in hundreds of cases where he could have been killed but he never faltered? Actually, he was once under gunpoint and wrapped up in semtex – enough to completely demolish an apartment. I was so sure he would leave me after that. After all, which crazy person would be willing to stay? I think that's the question Hamish, are you willing to stay after you know how crappy the other person's life is? You don't know how broken he was after the Fall. You don't know what I had to do to save John. I was ready to die for him. It all comes down to that, Hamish, what are you willing to give up for your person? This are the questions I want you to ask yourself before you propose.
"The thing about Mary…she has changed everything" John began, wanting to tell Sherlock, to explain why he was marrying Mary.
Oh, dear Lord. (This definitely was the day he took the Lord's name so many times). Frankly, Sherlock did not know what to feel. While he was, against his better judgement, open to the idea of a relationship with John, (or in goldfish terms,
Gotcha. Overdoing the indifference, Sherlock.

case? Ohhhhhh.
I try to feel my fingers and yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. There was no ring.
Sherlock looked very taken aback. He very slowly wiped his cheek with his fingers, looking extremely confused. Sherlock looked like he was doing some quick thinking.
The presents included mostly promises (Mrs. Hudson would let Sherlock experiment in the kitchen every year on his birthday, Lestrade gave full access to cases they would get the following month while Molly invited him to a game of Guess the Career in which she would let Sherlock examine the limbs of every dead person on her slab while Sherlock would guess their profession). However, Mrs. Hudson provided him with some books on bee-keeping. He opened a red present already knowing who it was from. He received similar present ages ago. It could not be a phone this time.

"I do not release my patients until they are healthy or at the very least on the way there. So I definitely will." Ella stated, completely serious.
"The wedding rings. They were killed by one of the crew for the jewellery."
I sit, deducing human emotions took a lot of work.
John: (draft) Remember that time when our biggest problem was who would get the milk?
He laughed. He had the
that Sherlock was a feet away from him, also moving in his direction. His hand stilled and his breathing became slightly ragged. He moved forward – and they collided.
"You'll have to write a speech"
The biggest secret? He was an empath. He pretended that he did not understand emotions – on the contrary, he understood them too much. That was the reason he had no friends. He could see that most of them talked to him because they needed his help. That was also the reason he loved Mrs. Hudson. She loved him just for him being him, not because of his money, looks or intellect. He was an intense person. The Holmes' boys didn't do things in halves. He hated with such visible intensity that the other person had no option but to cower or bully him. However, Sherlock loved with the same intensity as well. I still remember how Sherlock punished that American for hitting Mrs. Hudson. His love was the greatest gift anyone could possibly get.
(4:19 p.m) And?
I have no idea.
Molly seemed to catch my contemplative mood.

Sherlock: The bait was perfect. He absolutely fell for it.

Best man? Sherlock couldn't care less. John could pick anyone on the streets for all he cared
(9:36 p.m.) Another one? You already went once this month. Didn't you tell Lestrade?
“That’s it?” one of the contestants asked, incredulously.
Oh! Stupid. Anyone could walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. He must have come in yesterday and hidden inside till today. All the guards were obsessed with not letting anyone in but no guard was inside today. Same repeat of the diamond. Will these people never learn?
"Please call me Tom" he said, pushing away a tuft of his hair, smiling at them all.
Oh, okay then. I'll use this opportunity to get to know you. It's only fair, considering how much you know about me – JW
"But Sherlock is really dead. I recognized him and he's dead, John. No matter how much I hoped, reality hit me John. Sherlock is dead. The hospital has issued a death certificate."

"Well, it's time you guys! The whole crew is completely excited about this. It took us a lot of time and effort and we are extremely proud of the result.

I cut the phone. Honestly, the British Government deserved some respect. It was time I put Operation Lazarus in motion. I called Sylvia, and instructed her. It was crucial everything went to plan. If she was surprised, she didn't show it. I trained her well, then.
Emotion had already once clouded my judgment. And, I would have nearly paid the price for that. My friendship with John itself has made me question my deductions once. When I heard John at the pool, and for one horrible second, thought that John was Moriarty, my brain went into overdrive. There were three pieces of my brain at war with each other. One piece, which sounded like Mycroft, was chastising me for the blunder I've committed. A piece that sounded like my parents pitied on me. A small, but defiant part of my head did not care. It was grateful for the company it had gotten, no matter how fake. It did not regret meeting John Watson even if he was Moriarty. After that eternal second passes, I only felt one emotion. Not hate for Moriarty, not concern about my impeding death. I felt gratitude towards the man covered in semtex.
"Yes, you know he cares about him, deep down" she says, looking seriously at me.
He played it a final time but something felt very off. It felt messy, like excessive seasoning on an otherwise perfect dish. Music with too much sugar on top. A song to impress; not express.
"It's Greg, and he is not my best friend."
So, when John still stayed true to him, (
The guard went in with all the pride of a lion. His footsteps echoed the almost empty hall like the gong of death. He was clearly not a man that could be trifled with. He walks slowly, each step being taken with great caution and utmost care.
The frailty of a genius, it needs an audience. He's brilliant enough to want to be in the limelight. He wants attention. He wants a chase. He wants to be caught.

"And, John? I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could have the misfortune to meet. But, you've changed that John. Changed me. You've taught me to hope. Hope that I will be loved by someone for pure and unselfish reasons. Hope that I'll always have someone by me when I need them the most. You've made me the man I am today. You've saved me so many times and in so many ways that you'll never even comprehend. It's been one hell of a ride John, of mystery, murder and mayhem. And I look forward to doing that after the next three years"

Diana's suitcase was a mess of tops, make-up and some jewellery. Sherlock had no idea why there were so many frilly clothes around. Lace was everywhere. He found some stockings that would make The Woman proud. Lestrade blushed at the amount of lingerie the woman had and excused himself.
"He got away" Lestrade said, voice full of anger and disappointment.
John: (draft) I hate you, I hate you so much.
For the first time after many months, my heart beats fast. Sherlock's voice and Sherlock himself….how I missed him. I wonder idly if that was why he winked and smiled when we first met. But, the majority of mind is only thinking one thing: Sherlock.
"They think he's having an affair, becasue he always looks so satisfied when he returns. I don't know Mr. Holmes, it is only a suspicion"
"Alright Molly, okay. But I really don't think Mycroft would come to something as ridiculous as a birthday party. Oh no, wait, he'll come. There will be cake!" I explode, in a fit of hysteric giggles. She catches my mood and we both laugh like idiots for a minute or two.
I did not reply.
John: (draft) I love seeing you smile. Even though it's about a murder.
"You know what? Let's cut a deal. If John loves me, you don't interfere anymore. If he doesn't, I'll be the best man to his wedding."
John looked slightly hurt, but then smiled like a parent who he knew his kid was lying.
I nodded.
If you ever feel lost, tired or perhaps defeated, remember that you always have a home to return to. A place where you get hot cocoa in winter and an iced tea during the summer but a lot of love no matter the weather. You will always have the three of us through thick and thin, for better or for worse. You have us, hon.
John: (draft) Sherlock, I have to confess.
Sherlock. First look.
Sherlock: (draft) One more year and I'll come back home. Come back to you. If you still want me, that is.
(8:10 p.m) Oh, look who's texting! Remembered that I am alive then? What do you need? A foot?
You know, you were worth it. Worth all of the taunting, the sympathy from relatives, the biological demands, the grief. Letting you go was one of the hardest things I did in my life. But, I am glad. The pain was worth bringing such a wonderful person to this world.
Being with Mary has taught me to hope that I could be happy again. Maybe not as much as with Sherlock, but atleast a little happiness was enough for me right now. I guess I must have used up my lifetime happiness quota with Sherlock.
"Aww...I don't blame you, he was looking really cute!" Diana gushed, clearly smitten with them.
John hurried to the museum, his heart racing with the pump of adrenaline. It had been so long since John felt this way. Mr. S successfully stole a jade hairpin worth nine million pounds from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Today was a holiday for the museum. How did he get past the security outside?
Legwork never really had been his area.

I go down to make myself a cup of tea. I see his wallet on the sofa. What luck! I eagerly open it to see his license. It must have been his license when he was a teenager. I couldn't stop a small giggle that came out when I saw his picture.

Sherlock: (draft) Oh, how I've missed London. The wind on my face, the noise of the city, the buildings and the citylights – just one thing to finish this picture of bliss. You.
Sherlock is Hamish's biological father.
Molly looked out her window, and saw John boarding a cab. She smiled. Personally, she thought John did love Sherlock. His eyes lit up whenever she said Sherlock. He reminded her a little of her old love-smitten self. But she wondered if it was a crush. It wasn't her place to know. It wasn't his place to know, either. She frowns and takes her phone on the table.
"…and you"
Something struck me while I was pulling my chair to sit. I looked at him, who was in turn gazing lazily at me, his posture relaxed.
"You know it won't change anything. Me and Mary, getting married?"
12:58
This is it.
John smiled at the wind. He was going to face something stronger soon.
13:11
John immediately muted everything.
John: (draft) What if I didn't meet Stamford that day?
Sherlock: Odd socks? Arrest the brother in law. SH
Mycroft was never adept with emotions. Not to be confused with ignorant, however. Mycroft understood emotions all too well. He knew enough to manipulate people into doing his bidding. He knew what emotions could make a person do. What he didn't know however, was to deal with such emotions when it was his younger brother feeling these things. Relationships were always tricky, especially when the other party is married. Mycroft dare not gamble with such risky odds. So Mycroft did what he could, despite his better judgment. He continued tapping Sherlock's and John's phones. The results were, well, unexpected.
"Hang on. I haven't agreed!" John said, irritated with the non-verbal agreement Sherlock and Mr. Sagarson had.
"Um. Sure. Which ones?"
It's the only way I'll get to know you – JW
John Watson: Sherlock, there's a place for this sort of thing. A laboratory.
I was a broken man, an adrenaline-junkie, a man who cared about none and with none who cared about me. Life with Sherlock…it didn't normalize my life but rather made it better than I could ever hope for. Every day was new, bold, exciting. Nothing was ever dull. Like I told Mycroft, I was never bored. Truly, he's the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
I was in the army before I met you
it could resolve his boredom. Well, at least it explained a few things. Like Mycroft's warning that he wouldn't help. Like Sherlock would actually take Mycroft's help. What it didn't explain however, was if John had gotten the idea last night, how did he buy the envelope five days prior? Must be for something else. It didn't matter. He had bigger things to think about.
You see, you know things!
Sherlock: (draft) If it is only in Hell I'll get you back, so be it. I'll go to hell, Mary.

"I'll try. No promises, Ella"
The second anniversary of the Fall was approaching. I was reminded of my promise that I would wait in many subtle ways. For example, there was one time I got someone else's newspaper. And the headline? "Not dead" (Well, the story turned out to be about some Egyptian tombs or something). Another time, one of my patients had a breakdown in my office saying how a guy promised that he would wait for her but never did. It felt like the Universe liked to watch me suffer with indecision. And the worst was when I went to buy Mary a ring. I decided I would propose to her on the day of the Fall so that I would fulfill my promise. I finally decided upon one (Looking at the rings made me very depressed so I went with the one which had diamonds and could be bought with my meager salary) I paid the bill, put the ring in my pocket and was walking towards the exit. There, (I could have sworn they weren't there before) in a flashing array of lights, were a set of rings. Upon closer inspection, all of them turned out to be the same ring. The ring I hallucinated. Needless to say, I blacked out.
"Will you play again tomorrow?" I yelled at his retreating figure.
"This is what people do, Sherlock. They get married. I warned you. Don't get involved."
He tried to deduce the gits, but they were skilfully packed in shapeless boxes. He opened them, resigned that he would have to wait to know the contents of the box, and truth to be told, he was enjoying this a little. Was this how normal people felt like when they opened a present?
I was angry at Sherlock. Angry did not even cover it. I am sure there is no word that could describe how I am feeling right now. After the relief that came with the realization that we were not going to die, I was angry at Sherlock for manipulating me. It was like a reality check. That Sherlock paid a lot of attention to me as well as the fact that he often manipulated people's emotions. He was a good actor and certainly had the ability of making someone fall for him if need be. I stopped, startled at my realization.
Oh, how I missed you Sherlock.
Or I will be. Soon.
John had never heard of

Now was the second most difficult part. Waiting until the museum was sealed. On the roof. During a January evening. And, it just started snowing. Good. Tonight was going to be good.
"I've read it John. The Reichenbach Fall, you called it?" he says, in his low baritone. My heart skips a beat and he could see that on the monitor. Here I was in a hospital, feeling like rubbish and the man I loved is going to tell me he could never love me that way.
"Exactly, Jo-Hamish! I'm trying to make friends with the crew to get some dirt. Nothing so far. Shall we go and take a look at his rooms?"
"You promised you wouldn't embarrass me!" John said in a betrayed tone.

Sherlock: (draft) I'm falling in love with you all over again. And there's nothing I can do about it.
Sherlock knew he and John had a lot to talk about – The Woman's death, The Fall, Charles Augustus Magnussen, Mycroft's interference with Mary. Sherlock knew John had his own ghosts to talk about – that shoulder wound, Harry, a letter John stored in his locker...they had so many things to tell each other. Things that would make, strengthen or perhaps break their relationship. Sherlock would need a lot of time and evidence to believe John would
Sherlock's brain did a double take.
The man takes my coat. Baby clothes catalogue visible in the inner coat, both for a girl and a boy. Expectant father. His phone rings, special alert noise.
Sherlock: (draft) I sometimes whisper your name into the winds, hoping they would reach you.
John: (draft) Not that I'm cheating on you with her!
"John. My friend, John Watson"
Sherlock: Well, I would presume.
"Have a lovely day and do give the happy couple my best"
Thank you, Sherlock. This is my way of thanking you.
Such was the state of my mind when I was lying on the bed next to Mary. I look at her, sleeping peacefully. Her tranquil face soothed me and I found myself relaxing slowly and looking into the matter rationally.
They were led into another room along with the other contestants. John was left at the entrance (he assumed) and Sherlock was taken further along the room. Tom’s voice came in through the speakers of the room.
"Wait, he has a

John: (draft) I'll wait forever. Just so you know.
My worst fear? That was actually very easy. The hope that fills me dares me to take a leap forward, to show Sherlock what he really meant to me.
"Oh?" Matt looked slightly curious.
SHSHSHSHSH
John: Fine. It's totally up to you really.
"Of commitment!"
"Uhh..good. Very good. Nice." John struggled with words while Ruby put cucumber slices over John's eyes.
"Molly" I say. She turns, her eyes fearful. "It has all been done before. Remember how Adler faked her death?" I know I'm grasping at straw but I don't care. The other alternative cannot be true.
12:51
“Well, now that we have your attention...” Tom dragged on, with a smirk. He seemed to be enjoying every moment of the suffocating tension in the room. If looks could kill, Tom would have been killed fourteen times.
"Trust me, Diana, he appears calm but I'm sure he's dying inside" Sher...William explained, a mischievous smile on his face.
Sherlock: Just go to hell, Mike.
Sherlock: (draft) I hope someone's looking after you the way I did before.
Ella sighed, relieved he was finally showing a sign of cooperating. "Great, on that note I will let you go for today. I expect results next week."
What? No!
John: (draft) I hate you, I hate you. I want to punch you in your effing face. I won't even avoid your nose.
John walked through the corridor, stopping at the balcony. He could see London in its entirety. For a second, he felt insignificant in the vast expanse that lay in front of him. The moment soon passed, and for the first time, John gulped, slightly scared. This was the most difficult part.
I tell my client that I had to go. He nods, after all, he does have twelve guards of his own. I walk out of the bank, being careful as not to let the thieves see me. I see a black car waiting for me. I hop in. Slyvia (Anthea's real name) greets me. She has had a crush on Mycroft from a really long time. I wonder how Mycroft could have been so blind. Was I blind to certain things too?' SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHS
There was only one city left to finish his global signature.
There was something wrong. Something very wrong with Sherlock's voice. He sounded vulnerable, for the first time, he sounded human, when I didn't need him to!
A question I cannot answer, John. I am torn between losing my mind, the very substance of who I am and becoming insane or losing…all of you. (Not Mycroft, though) –SH
He waited until the draw was to take place, tapping his foot impatiently waiting for Sherlock. Mr. Sagarson arrived along with the band which caused an instant uproar and thus temporary deafness. The band members (four male and two female) all waved at them. Each band member, the director and the producer would pick a number thus selecting eight couples. John saw many couples crossing their fingers. He smirked and said jauntily to the couple next to him.
Tea was ready. Mrs. Hudson slowly poured it into a cup. She mixed some of her "herbal soothers" in them. Sherlock would need them today. She takes the tray and frowns. She was unsure as to how Sherlock was feeling right now. She listens to the waltz music coming from Sherlock's flat.
But I'm okay
"Well, your eye conversation means you'll atleast get past round one. That's enough time isn't it?"
Well, the first crime is not mine. It belongs to ACD. The story is called the Devil's Foot I think. However, all other puzzles, the second crime, rhymes etc. are mine
"Oh, it's not just a quiz. It's much more than that. We've ensured that no couple gets via trickery. Only genuine couples who actually know and understand each other will stand a chance. I and my wife did a test run..."

Sherlock: Can't make it. SH
He looked me straight in the eye. A deep stare, as if trying to decipher what I was thinking. I stared back into his. Big mistake.
I looked at the empty room. John wasn't home yet. I talk to my skull (friend. Well, when I say friend….)
(8:15 p.m) WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE MET FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN HUMAN PARTS
"I was serious about the ten year thing. I told them they didn't have to get you gifts for the next ten years so to put the effort into a good one. So, don't go expecting these gifts the next year."
(3:06 p.m.) You text me after an hour to tell me that? Oh, Sherlock, you've got it bad.
(4:15 p.m) Don't play dumb with me, Sherlock Holmes!
We step inside the carriage. I was bracing myself to see a huge bomb in the centre of the carriage.
John didn't reply. I wait two minutes. Still no reply. I text Mrs. Hudson.
I'm not gifted like you, Sherlock – JW
Is John home? – SH
We are actually planning on having a contest and the winners will be featured in the video. It is to be announced tomorrow."
It was midnight when Mrs. Hudson woke up. She could hear Sherlock's violin, his music pouring from all corners of the room. She crept upstairs and peeped through the door to hear him better.
It was time to show John who I was.
Sherlock: (draft) I'll be honest. I was looking forward to your eulogy at my funeral today. Why didn't you come?
But, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. For once in my life, let me not.
A philosophical smile.
"Please act happy" he whispered.
The tea! Mrs. Hudson was in on it too! He went to the kitchen and sure enough the cup was in the sink, staring at him innocently. He picked it up and sniffed it. That confirmed it.
that they get to grow old with their spouse,
The whole world turns upside down. This is what he was. Best friend. Was John that cruel to make him his best man? Surely the agony because of John marrying her was not enough? Was Sherlock to be punished by actually having to arrange a marriage he didn't want to happen? Sherlock pauses, trying desperately to not let his expression show. He forced his face to remain neutral while trying to calm the tumult of emotions threatening to tear up the fragile wall he had created. He had spent years practicing to control his emotions. He had succeeded.
I'm pissed.
Britain was in uproar.
John was actually hoping Plan A would fail. He had a lot of fun deducing about Mr. S these past few days.
I subtly warn Sherlock. He does not get it.
"John..."
Mycroft's eyes scan mine and I know what the worst thing that could happen was. John, dying.
When he reads, when he types
I smile. I feel a little bit like Sherlock's John, pissed at his inappropriate deductions. I feel a little angry too, at him for leaving me in this state

John nods. He smiles strangely at Sherlock and leaves.

with John. He imagines a candlelight dinner with John – Angelo giving them a knowing smirk. They would eat casually, perhaps hold hands. John's fingers would slightly brush Sherlock's. His heart races just at the thought. They would soon leave – since John's touch always turned on Sherlock. John would do these slight, barely touching strokes on his forearms that turns Sherlock's blood electric. They would look at each other- Sherlock uncertain but John determined. John would hold Sherlock's head in place – determined not to let Sherlock run away because that's what Sherlock did when he was confused. He would
Suddenly, the lights turn on and the timer starts. I am insanely angry at Sherlock right now. He led us to this…this suicide plan of his and we could die. How irresponsible of him! I yell:
"Well, it's the safest way. I played with the idea of being the make-up artist but I don't think you have the connections. Anyway, this is more efficient."
I bargain for more time
SHSHSHSHSHSHSH
How will you decide if John loves me or not? – SH
MYCROFT! I calm myself, being emotional does not help any scenario, especially one that included Mycroft. Emotions betray you and I wasn't about to lower my defenses in front of one of the sharpest people alive. Not that it mattered, he knew I loved John now. Something, I tried really hard to avoid. Mycroft's interference had burned out more relationships than I can count. I wonder if my interference destroyed relationships…especially those of John's. I must apologize. I realize now how it feels like.
SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHS

Changed me. Taught .
John switched on his laptop, trying to update his blog. He would type a few words, press backspace and the whole process would repeat again. He eventually   wrote a small piece about that day and then.... deleted it. This was something John did every day. Every day he would type something and everyday it was deleted again. He was just not ready. John wondered if he would ever be.
Sherlock: (draft) How could I tell you that I loved you when you looked so happy with some other woman?
SHSHSHSHSHSH
The thought that I met someone does not even cross Mrs. Hudson.
I hear Mrs. Hudson's voice cutting through my sleep. I wake up with a jolt, remembering the events of yesterday. I still have the oxygen mask, but I try to show her my tied hands. She seemed surprised with my jovial mood and I don't blame her.
JOHN! LOOK AT ME!

"WHY...WHAT...NO" John seemed to have lost the ability of constructing a sentence.
"And if you don't, I will sign you up for 6 months of extra mandatory therapy."
John: (draft) I am so sosorry.
No, Sherlock, I'll be back with you very soon.
SHSHSHSHSHSHSH
Meanwhile, John had only one thought:
(6:22 p.m.) Yes, thank you.
"Changed everything"
So, where are we on the party arrangements? – JW
(9:50 p.m.) Of course!
So, Watson pull me closer
eyeliner.
"And?"
Sherlock, in the mean-time, was silently fidgeting more and more in a way only recognisable to John. He cast a look at Sherlock but Sherlock refused to meet his eye.
"What sort of contest?" John asked, seeing that Sherlock was quite busy with his phone.
One found mad and two people dead. Obviously, some form of toxin was introduced to the body. It was easy to kill, but not that easy to drive someone mad. He raced to his room, thinking of the various possibilities. More importantly, the motive?
"Sir, the Prime Minister is waiting for you" Anthea said, typing frantically on her Blackberry. She had been a rock for Mycroft.
What? Why? What? Sherlock, what happened? Why are you doing this? Why are you lying to me? We both know that's not true.
John: (draft) I don't ever want to see your face ever again, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock: (draft) This is it John. I'm coming home.
13:09
John: Um, hello. We met in the bus.
That morning:
Sherlock was completely giddy. Ecstatic. He felt like jumping in the air. He instead settled for hysterical laughter.
"So, it's the big day then"
(1:37 p.m.) We all love you, Sherlock. You know that, right?
He loved me? Sherlock Married-to-my-work Holmes loves me? Oh, Sherlock, I'll wait for you for a thousand years if you wanted me to.
"Well, you and Mycroft should enter the contest" John said jokingly.
It was her way of subtly reminding me of my hallucination. And, it was my time to reply.
See what emotion has done to you? You are texting sensitive information. Ugh! –MH
'Now the website had matched him with...'
Plan B was set into motion.
Sherlock's stomach did a somersault.
John: (draft) You're wrong, you know. You are a hero. Always were, always will be.
Sherlock: (draft) I'm really scared about what will happen after this - Would you forgive me? Would you even remember me?
"Dull"
"This is it, you guys. This box has everything a couple may need for Round One"
Copy that. Over.
SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH
“GO!” yelled Matt.
"You mean, I was clever?" John smirked a little.
Things won't end well.
Interesting.
John: (draft) And now it is too late. I'm so sorry.
I hit a dead-end. No other possibility occurs to me. A fear that Molly was right starts creeping in.
"You still love him" She says, and dramatically exits.
I nod. My eyes are filled with tears. I'm just happy he's still alive. Happy that I did say all those things which I regretted not saying. Sherlock pulls out a plain platinum ring out of his coat and slips it on my finger. It looked beautiful. It feels wonderful. Precious, just like Sherlock. Cold, just like Sherlock felt like in the beginning, but John's warmth would soon warm the ring. However, I couldn't see the ring on my fingers which I longed to because my head was also tied down. However, I looked at Sherlock, trying to memorize him. I imprint this memory in my head forever. He kisses my palm. He kisses my forehead. And, then, he's moving away. I start moving, trying to get out of my bed. He whispers in my ear,
To John, it didn't matter. Admiration was the only thing he felt. He slightly regretted the fact that Mr. S would be handed over to the authorities after all this was over. Shame. What a waste of such talent.
John: (draft) YOU KILLED MY WIFE
John: (draft) Is this...what I think this is?
John: (draft) I still remember the day we met. 29th January, 2010.
The man of thought was now replaced by a man of action. He took his cloak and ran out of the building, yelling:
SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH
I decided that moving on from Sherlock meant taking that walk down memory lane. I summon up my courage to go into our flat.
The drizzling finally stopped and John found rose petals taking their place. He stilled, he could feel a strange pull in his stomach. William’s eyes met his and they seemed to be searching his whilst the rose petals still fell all around them. Sherlock came closer; his eyes still intent on John’s. John’s heart began beating a lot harder; his fingers were itching to touch Sherlock. He stood where he was, afraid to move. Sherlock stopped two painful inches away from John, and stared at him with an intensity that almost scared him. Then, in the midst of the din everyone was making, with all the cameras pointed towards them, with rose petals swaying gently between them, Sherlock Holmes kissed John. It was a quick peck, very hesitant and immediately pulled away. It was almost as if he was scared that he would burn his lips. He immediately turned away from John and smiled at the cameras. John soon joined him, his smile quite real.
13:10
How boring.
Comments
(1:05 p.m.) Text me the convo.
Sherlock. I bloody know, okay? I did not want to see Sherlock like this, kneeling in front of me, a face that spoke of desperation, hands joined as if I were God. If my forgiveness truly meant that much for him, I would gladly give it. I did not want to spend our last moments together in regret for unspoken things. I would tell him. I would tell him everything. My last words will be I love you, Sherlock Holmes.
"Okay, give me"
John: (draft) But what about Janine then? Why does my brain tell me that you're manipulating her? And why does my heart desperately want it to be true? I used to be a nice person.
Tom was standing in the centre of a room which very much looked like the dressing-rooms on the telly. There were huge mirrors everywhere, not to mention the tons of make-up kits piled away neatly. There were five guys and three girls standing beside Tom, all of them inspecting the eight couples. Tom waved at them.
I looked at John. He's a good actor, but he didn't deceive me. One look, and I knew who the shooter was. I wasn't horrified. I was filled with awe.
Sherlock: (draft) I just had a nightmare. I dreamt that I arrived at the bonfire late. Must you also reside in my dreams? Wasn't reality enough?
Yes, John. But even a criminal would say that. Has all my instruction been for naught? – SH

"I need you to run a toxin test on the clothes" Sherlock said, slightly out of breath. Two hours were already up and Sherlock had no idea as to how many puzzles John had for him. Not that he was complaining.
"Look, Sherlock. This is the most important day of my life and I want to be up there with two people whom I love and care about the most."

At a crime scene, maybe murder
Sherlock: (draft) Many happy returns, John.
Now, if I..well,
"I will"
John Hamish Watson. It was all for him. All the things I had done the past two years. They were to ensure he was safe. I was an idiot to let my emotions to take over me at the wrong moment. Months of planning could have been ruined. Proposing to John was one of the best moments of my life, but it was the wrong time. I and Mycroft spent months to plan the perfect fake suicide. The entire thing was staged so that John would believe that I was dead. And, I, the idiot I was, went back to John the same night. Well, I had to. His entry on Reichenbach Fall made me forget everything.
Molly, don't spend too much –JW
Mary: I'm on my way.
(4:17 p.m) You only talk to people for a reason! Mycroft because he is your brother. Lestrade for a case. Mrs. H because you think of her as a second mother. Me because I won't stop bothering you. So, why John?
"Wait!"
I didn't realize I said that out loud. Not surprising really. Therapy has completely ruined me.
Mycroft's expression turns grave.
"What?"
I've made sure that the venue is available. I also sent invites. You should find out Sherlock's favorite flavor and book the cake –MH
their purpose in life by a select few to further their own interests. We kill dreams for money, kill love for lust. I had lost all my faith in humanity when I returned. I lived in my sister's place for a few days, doing nothing but merely existing. My sister was a smart woman. She seemed to understand what was happening without me saying a word. She was also a great woman, she never once offered sympathy or tried to cajole me into thinking that the world was a better place. I loved her for that. And it was that love which finally gave into her requests. I found myself with a suitcase in hand and a ticket to Paris in my pocket and a glimmer in her eye.
"We both know I haven't written a word. You know that I'm only here because I have to be here. Can we just quit the facade?"
Oslo. First robbery. A lost Vermeer was stolen. Lost again, then.
"It's Mark!" Sherlock said but no one heard him.
After a few vibration-filled minutes, all the couples were asked to move to a different room. John used this diversion to deactivate the app and with some slight surprise, saw that Sherlock was furiously trying to do the same, albeit in a much more discreet manner. He soon succeeded.
SHSHSHSHSHSHSH

Still in denial. Today was going to be either a night of euphoric celebration or a danger night. And all the evidence points to the latter. Tonight was going to be a very sad night. A night of two broken, misunderstood hearts. Was reconciliation possible?

The thief is hitting London next
Mrs. Hudson left, with tears in her eyes, unable to see her son grieving like that.
Sherlock: Goodbye, John Watson.
Both their heads turned at a knock on the door.
"What do you want, Mycroft?" I ask roughly. Mycroft was the reason of Sherlock's death. I hadn't forgotten that. I contemplate hitting him but I was bound. Again.
Have your parents ever tell you the story of your conception? Well, let me give you the uncensored version. Sherlock never wanted a kid. (Not to worry, he changed his mind as soon as he saw you! You were a bundle of cuteness!) He was scared to be with Rosie and it took a lot of effort from John's side to convince Sherlock that, yes, he was Rosie's step-father. It took him a lot of time to accept that. You can still see him being a little uncertain with handling Rosie. I remember the day they asked me to do this honor. Sherlock was pacing in the lab, repeatedly telling John that he did not have it in him. (The words were "I can't even
"Oh, face it, Sherlock, you're scared."
Sherlock instinctively moved closer.
"Of course one should. But not at John's wedding! We wouldn't do that, would we? You and me? We would never do that to John Watson"
There was a high pitched scream and a couple went to the stage, resembling Sherlock when he first hears about a good case, that is, giggly and jumpy. John couldn't see anything.
Sherlock smiles, but it seems forced.
Finally, Hamish, I wish you a lot of happiness. We will always be there for you, no matter what. We'll be there when you fall. We'll be there when you try. We'll be there when you fall again. We'll be there when you reach the top. Nothing matters to me more than your happiness. I hope you'll find your John Watson and have what I have now. Take care of your sister when we are gone.
She looked at my hand but then her face becomes sadder than ever.
(6:19 p.m.) Thank you, Sherlock. Of course you do. Now, don't make me cry.
"I'm sorry. I really am." I apologize, not convincingly.
, a Cheshire grin on his face. "We just wrapped up our shoot for a song cover. Something tells me you weren't sorry to witness it. Anywaaaaaay...Are you all excited? Nervous?"
“Oh, come on!” someone whined.
I can't, I can't do it John. I don't know how. Forgive me.
That is what is wrong with all of us! We are so desperate to be heard that we are just waiting for our turn in a conversation!" He stopped abruptly, pouting.
I was so anxious with the matters at hand that the day at the hospital was a complete disaster. I prescribed cough medicine to a kid with stomachache. Luckily, I realized what I was doing and was able to correct it. Nonetheless, I was very distracted and Sarah kept shooting me dirty looks, passing a comment about attending a book fair and giggling.
"Well, dummy, he took his card when he left. Okay, why grocery? Dull. That's the only thing he goes shopping for. John is a huge fan of online shopping. Okay, why online shopping? This one is really obvious. His shoulders hurt when he goes out in the cold. It's December, not exactly a nice time to be running around the city. What if he went to buy something important? Balance of probability, dear skull"
The truth of the statement hits me. Hits me hard, very, very hard. I realize that Sherlock is dead. What happened afterwards was indeed a hallucination. I would never see Sherlock again. We would never run in the streets of London. There would be no more entries on my blog. There would be no more deductions. No more Mycroft. No more dead bodies. No more shooting the walls. No more experiments. No heads in the fridge. No more life.
Sherlock: (draft) But you're perfect. Never ever doubt that.
Someone he lived with for eight years. Not a model to ogle at.
I've deleted it – SH
John: I know you're lying, don't even insult my intelligence by asking how.
She nods, looking at me curiously. I know her head was burning with questions but I didn't want to answer them. I left, a little hurriedly, scared she might find out.
Sherlock: The curtain rises. The last act. It's not over. SH
I liked it when John typed my name. I could hear his voice.
It's the least John deserved after all I put him through. He loved her? I will silently accept it. I will not make him choose after he has already chosen. I wouldn't risk his friendship for anything in the world.
No one was in the room when the police came.
"No, say you are sorry. Apologize."
By the time I reach the Diogenes club, I already deduced how the conversation would go like.
Lonely? Him? Ha! John had more friends than I had enemies. He could never feel lonely.
There was a shocked silence while the eight couples took in everything and then began a lot of "OH MY GOD"s, hooting and whistles. The band lost their composure and began laughing, all of them transformed into normal people once again and the room felt a lot cooler.
John: (draft) Why does this feel like goodbye?
"Why do you not want to?"
John was not confident that they would catch Mr. S. They secured all known museums in London. Triple security was assigned to museums like the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery. They did now know when Mr. S would strike but they were on constant alert. But, hell, Mr. S got through the Delta Team. John knew it was only a matter of time for Mr. S to strike again and thus launching plan B.

Sherlock was laying on the couch of a hotel in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. And he was stuck there because Mycroft somehow blocked him from the airport.

There were a pile of boxes waiting for him on the armchair. Sherlock deposited his present gifts into his armchair. He swallowed once or twice, determined to say the things that he
"Now, the crew members are pretty excited about this. They are the ones organizing the contest. My job is to film you all and put the winners clips in the video. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to Mr. Garibaldi!" Mr. Sagarson said and walked away, no doubt to being filming right from this moment.
I got up angrily and left. I thought he
This was all I had. I was sure about the method of murder but wasn't sure of the suspect. I raced to the lab with the clothes. I needed Molly to test for toxins.

He walked a little further and stilled. He didn’t need the phone anymore – he
(1:03 p.m.) Sherlock.
She went inside, shaking her head at mess the man had managed to make. She made her way through the obstacle race he created. She stopped at the door, trying to decipher his mood. If he was yelling, it meant she shouldn't go in. If he was shooting the walls (no exaggeration), it meant he wanted company. The sound of machinery meant he was working and there would be no use in going inside. He wouldn't notice her. But, he was silent. Silence usually meant deep contemplation. She went in, determined to make him eat something.
"Two more months" he told himself.
It made complete sense. Sherlock wasn't allowed to see the bodies for there were none. A case was easy to fabricate but a body wasn't. It also explained the hotel room – a home was impossible to create for someone like Sherlock. A home is the ultimate encyclopaedia of a person's life. The effort required would be tremendous. Now that Sherlock had a better understanding of things, he realised that he should have noted the notorious absence of interviews with suspects. Sherlock merely assumed that Lestrade was scared about Sherlock's involvement. However, it had been very clever of John to make that all up.
"How is this the first time I am hearing of him? After all he has done…" the Minister asks, flustered.

John: Wait, how do you know I'm a doctor!?
Why didn't you call the police? Why do you never call the police?

Mrs. Hudson is confused, though she is trying her best not to show it.
"The moment you made this a big deal."
Sherlock jolted out of his bed, certain that the apocalypse had begun. He dressed up in high speed. He racked his brains to remember how and when he had fallen asleep. All he remembered was having some tea and talking to John, or rather, complaining about the lack of a case. He washed his face again with cold water, trying to remember.
I was insane
After a suspenseful ten minutes, Sherlock sent a single text to John.
I'd be lost without my blogger
I've always loved stories of treasure hunts and texting when it comes to Sherlock. Figured if I like them so much, I should write them.
Dimmock: You'll have to explain later!
Was this a price I had to pay for playing with John's mind?
"Wearing that cologne then?" John joked.
I look at John, trying to find out what exactly he was thinking
"I'll try" he muttered half-heartedly, mostly to get Ella off his back.
I had no intention of letting Sherlock know what was John was about to do. I will let him make his own deductions.
E: Hey
Leave that to me, brother mine. – MH
John: Impressive. What's up with you?
My sister drank too much and that's an issue
Mycroft almost choked on his tea. When he asked his team to document the success of Operation Lazarus and its aftermath (dismantling Moriarty's web), he had expected a nice little file which basically spelled out
"No!" he yelled back. I could hear his smile. He got on a cab and I saw the car slowly receding away in the distance.

Another one of your bloody tricks
I wasn't gay. Sherlock was just special, that's all. Even Irene fell for Sherlock, even though she was a lesbian.
I made a fake-prescription to buy hypnotic drugs that would numb my mind. There was no way I could live through even a single day feeling like this. I started drinking too (Not as much as Harry though). To me, everyday was numb. Dull. Nothing happened to me anymore. Wake up. Go to the hospital. Do required work. No social interaction of any kind. Come home. Drink a bit. Sleep. Repeat. I live like a robot. Greg tried to talking me into going to pubs but honestly, I had no patience for that sort of thing. How boring it all seems now. Molly visits at least twice a week, checking as to how I felt. I would say I'm fine, she would act like she believed me. It felt nice, however, to know that she truly cared for me. I must do something for her before these three years end. Mrs. Hudson would call once a week. I never had the courage to take the call. That is my life now, the life of a robot. The life of the man I was before I met Sherlock. A life with no purpose. A life without meaning. Mere existence. Plowing my way through time, waiting for three more years.

"Sherlock. Human emotion can never be rationalized. It's a blind leap where you hope you don't fall. A gamble with the most extraordinary odds. A decision which has no logical reasoning.

I know it's just my pessimism talking. John had renewed long lost hopes. The hope that I'd find someone who loved me, someone who would make me their number one priority, someone who actually cares, someone with pure intentions.
(1:09 p.m.) He is an army doctor? Why a cane? HE CAN'T WALK? OH MY GOD. I AM SO SORRY.
"Come in" a terse response.
I had an extremely tiring day. I was actually thankful that Sherlock didn't invite me to the case he was working on (the client wanted complete anonymity – he would only trust Sherlock). Two minor surgeries, four clinic patients and a nasty break-up, it looked like the universe was against me today. Well, truth to be told, I wasn't really that into her, anyway. The only silver lining was that Sherlock wasn't home so there was no need to worry about the house. I opened the door to 221 B, absent-mindedly checking the knocker to see if Mycroft was here (Sherlock's ways were rubbing off on me). It's been a long time since Mycroft visited the flat, but again, things have been pretty rough between him and me after the…the Fall.

Author's note:
I slowly droop off next to the woman I vow to make my wife.
My heart breaks, looking at the desperate reporter. If that article came out, this would how people would talk to Sherlock. We had to make this right.
"Ruby, do you mind if I do his cheeks? I would love some contouring tips" William said, in that cute voice puppy-eyed look John only knew too well. Not surprisingly, she agreed.
Sherlock: (draft) For what it's worth, I really and truly loved you. And I usually regret loving at the end, but I don't. You were the best person I could have ever hoped to be friends with. I've loved you and maybe, just maybe, I regret it now. Just a little.
He turned slowly.
It was nice to get to know you a little.
"Admire your confidence mate. The odds are not good" the man replied, holding his girl-friend's (no, wife! the ring) hand and crossing his other hand.
(1:10 p.m.) Haha, I've been wanting to use that for ages. But, I think it should be the opposite. Something like Sherlock, Sherlock yes John. But it does not have that ring to it.
No, not an intervention. Was Molly going to do a medical check-up? Was that why John was buttering Sherlock up? That must be it. The knife was waiting for surgery.
"You wouldn't have to do anything, Dr. Watson. Maybe hand-holding but that's all"
"What if he doesn't?"
(9:46 p.m.) Yeah?

He scoffs at the idea though, asking me not to fret over "could be's" and "what ifs". But it does make good tea-time conversation.

So, it was John who was responsible for his nine hour sleep. That narrowed things. He was a doctor. Only way – tranquilisers.

"Absolutely"
He can be crazy like that sometimes.I sometimes heard the opening notes, muffled, coming from the living room, always abruptly stopped. And as the years passed by, he slowly forgot about the song completely. I don't blame him. He has a folder full of his own music now.
it. She was sitting on the corner of the table and had crossed her legs. She looked slightly disinterested, holding a cigarette in her hand that was waiting to be lit. Harry, the drummer, wore a full-fit white T-shirt which complimented his muscles quite well. He had placed his elbow on the wall to show off his biceps while placing his palm on the back of his head. Sam was sitting on a chair near the table, wearing
After 0987,0034,0001,0689,1230, it was the turn of Mr. Sagarson. He walked towards the laptop and typed:
Sherlock: (draft) Goodbye, John.
John woke up to the sound of Sherlock's voice.
John: (draft) I'm using the cane again. Never thought I would need it.
"All lives end. All hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock."
Sherlock was aware that Mary and John knew that he was scared. They just did not know why.
Mycroft was the last person I wanted to see. Especially when he could deduce that I wanted to kill myself. Well if he noticed it, he didn't show it.
Friend. Friend. How Sherlock hated the word.
I wait for an hour but I still don't get a reply. All my hope diffuses out slowly. Of course, Sherlock didn't love me. Just because he knows my favorite color? Or that he pays attention to me? News-flash! He does that to everything in his surroundings. He probably pays the same attention to his skull. There was no reason for me to feel special. None at all. Who was I, a mere man in the millions of people, to be anything but ordinary to Sherlock? I was addicted to the level of attention he gave me. He was everything to me and I mean nothing to him. I am merely a bundle of flesh and clothes which can talk. A goldfish.
"What is your bloody problem?" he snarled.
"What for?"
"Mrs. Hudson. After days of indecision, I've finally decided. I don't care!" he practically yelled in joy.
"I am not a child anymore Mycroft"
Mycroft: Not what I quite implied, brother dear.
Sherlock: (draft) Sometimes, I just want to look you at you straight in the eye and yell "I'm alive!"
"I was talking about a career, Sherlock! Loving people is the most chaotic thing you can think of. It is the most unpredictable way of living your life! Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock!" he would be practically yelling.

"But why?"
Have a crush?
"I did indeed, but where is the fun in that?" William replied, his eyes full of mischief. His lips were curved with the pleasure of teasing John and Sherlock's whole face looked like a happy schoolboy's.
"I play the violin too. We should try a duet sometime" Matt smiled at William. Was it just him or was Matt's tone
"Yes"
The words reverberate around his head for a second.
The guard was anxious – droplets of sweat had accumulated on his forehead despite the snow surrounding them. His stance was that of a tiger – ready to leap at a moment's noticed. His eyes scanned the area with an intensity that would put eagles to shame. Anyone could see that he was a man ready to fight. He had plenty of reason to be. Britain relied on him.
"If you are going down, might as well stay in Paris first" she smiled, asking me to hope.
John, I need you with me forever
I felt guilty. Very guilty.

This was always the case with Sherlock. Sherlock always left him alone when John needed him the most. Something clicks in John's mind. It felt like a sign. Like marrying Mary was the right thing to do.
John was too preoccupied to hear the jeerings and the catcalls of "Gay!" and "Faggots!". He was too preoccupied to notice that the eighth couple were selected. Actually, he became unaware of everything in the world. There was only one thing in his mind and that was Sherlock's

"I can't, John" she says, and runs out of my room. However, I could still hear her sobbing outside my room. It all felt unimportant. Was I really mad? Was yesterday a hallucination? Was it my mind's way of recreating my hopes, recreating my dreams, recreating all that could have been? For the first time, I'm glad they've tied me down.
I arrive at Marylebone Road an hour before I was supposed to meet Mary. I was that nervous. All my nerves were tingling with anticipation. Sadly, it was not due to the fact that I was proposing. No matter how hard I try to convince myself, I knew the state of my anticipation was due to the end of two years. End of waiting. It was Sherlock's time to keep up his promise. Ninety nine percent of me was telling me (in a voice very much like Sherlock's) that I was stupid. But, there was that one percent that was feeling justified in keeping my end of the promise, no matter how ludicrous. I sat, contemplating as to how to propose. Clever as she was, she must have already figured out that I was going to propose to her.
There was some nervous laughter in assent.
I was a fool.
John: This isn't a good idea.

They spent a lot of time in Sherlock's bedroom trying on different wigs. Sherlock amused John by wearing all his costumes and saying ridiculous lines. He remember one memorable moment when Sherlock wore the traffic police-men's unfiorm and said:
The party was surprisingly short. They sang while he cut the cake and had generous amounts of it. There was also beer in the burettes, beakers, basically every chemical apparatus that could hold liquid. Mrs. Hudson smiled and hugged him, adding a few comments on how he should settle down. Lestrade merely smiled at him. His eyes held the triumph of fooling Sherlock Holmes with a fake real case. Sherlock's respect for Gavin went up a little bit, that is, he decided he would find out Lestrade's first name. Molly smiled at him and wished him well, nothing like the Christmas incident. Mike wished him and said
John: (draft) I am worried about cheating on you? I have a wife.
John: (draft) Go to hell, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock: I love her.
Attention. I paid attention too. Hard not to, when you are in this deep. He always said preferring one thing over the other without any reason was completely irrational and thus alien to him. However, he did slip. He did have favorites. He loved dogs. He liked the wind - I discovered this when I realized that he preferred a bike over a car. He built up his knowledge of London by being a cab driver (I found a cab license while cleaning Sherlock's room). He hated birthdays. Not just his, everyone's. He seemed to have no idea as to what qualified as a present and what did not. One birthday he gave me a watch I wanted but could not afford. The next birthday, however, he gave me an essay which basically said that all my friends hated me.
Oh! I see what you did there – JW
I merely observed. You are free to observe anytime you like – SH
John stared at her, realizing that she was actually serious.
My last attempt.
He gestured to the waiter for the cheque. We both headed out in silence, each of us busy in our own thoughts. I really wanted to ask him his name but I didn't. There was something beautiful about the evening, something surreal; I did not want to ruin it with reality. We walked through the garden, admiring the flowers until we reached the spot he played earlier. He stopped walking and turned around to look at me. Again, those deep blue eyes looked at me searchingly, as if they were expecting something.
John: Night owl?
My heart breaks, looking at his expression. He is looking at me, his mouth telling me to get the hell out but his eyes begging me to stay. He was staring at me, deducing my every movement, every breath. He seemed to have forgotten about the looked at me like a man taking the biggest gamble of his life would. Of course, I realized all this later. Then, I was only thinking of possibilities that could save us. I was not giving up yet.
I was too scared to let him in. Things never went well, after that.
Harry Watson: Brother, what has got you thinking down this road? Have you met someone new? It sounds serious
John: (draft) I don't blame you. You warned me right at the start. Married to your work. My mistake, really.
They were taken to a much picturesque room which on closer inspection turned to be made of movable cardboard walls. John knew he was going to be filmed today but couldn't help feeling self-conscious looking at all the cameras. He then focused his attention towards the six people who were obviously waiting for them. They were posing as impatient people but the overall effect was...well,
Relationships are never easy and I've learnt that the hard way. There can, and there will be, other people in your and their life. Do not dwell in the past. Rather, make your future. I had to go through the agony of watch the love of my life marry someone else. To rub salt on my wounds, I was best man. So, don't commit the mistakes I've made. Never be a coward. If you love someone, tell them. Tell it to the world. Tell them everyday. Show them as well. Yes, you will fight, there will be words. There always will be. But, is the person worth it? John is worth it.
wasn't that difficult a deduction, especially when Sherlock kept saying it. Sherlock had particularly enjoyed that one. He typed in his password (no, not John Watson. Sherlock was romantic but god forbid, never
Lestrade says he has a belter.

Well, we stopped the flame before it could spread. Since you haven't heard me and ran off Sherlock, I'll tell you here: The kitchen is off limits for fire-related experiments!
Well, the date went terribly. Terribly didn't even cover it. We met for coffee before work. I wasn't used to talking these days and she didn't talk either. I guess she was too scared to talk to me, afraid she'll let the wrong thing spill out. We drank coffee in silence. Summoning the courage to talk, I ask:
E: Or early.
Or was it?

John: So, you never did tell me what happened.
"Mycroft" I growl. How dare he intercept my mail?
John was giddy. In an hour or so, he was finally going to meet Mr. S. He surveyed the five storey tower in front of him. The tallest museum in the world. The Blue Carbuncle was on the top of this monstrously high building. John fastened the ropes on his waist, walking towards the entrance. He walked in, through the metal detectors. He smiled when they detectors did not make a racket. All his gear was plastic, thanks to Mycroft. He soon got past the security under the guise of a tourist.
