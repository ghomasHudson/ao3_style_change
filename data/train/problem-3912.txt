Something in Dean's chest tightens and he knows that Cas is commenting from experience, not just fantasy. Dean wants to rub that memory out—not because it was someone other than him, but because of how he imagines it made Cas feel. He can see it: Cas just letting it happen, and then the shattering disappointment of the entire experience and with no one he could share it with. It hurts Dean to think about, but it’s also the final wedge that pries Dean away from a hair-trigger orgasm. So there's that.
"That the angel who's been juicin' you up?" Bobby says. There's only a little judgment in his voice. "Weren't you the one sayin' that they were all dicks? That Uriel asswipe guy, and the spineless one. Which one's this one?"
On the back of his tongue, Dean wants to say "You don't have to." "Stay over here." "Plenty of room for two," with a little flirty tip of his head.
He tries to believe it when he tells her, "You're going to a better place." For her sake. For all their sakes.
Charlie carries on like she hasn't just mortally wounded him. "Sam noticed you two were trading off, and I was like, dude! Just buy them a second one!"
Jimmy's not staring at him anymore, but Castiel is. One corner of his mouth lifts in a small smile. Almost... what the fuck, playful? He doesn't look away when he says, "Not all angels are terrible. At least I hope not? I think I might be one of them."
Cas wraps an arm around him, and a large, warm hand presses carefully against one of his shoulder blades. There’s another flare of bone-deep ache, accentuated by just the nudge of Cas's nose along the outline of the palmprint. It goes on and on, until Dean is dizzy and buzzing and the need to kiss Cas has reached a fever pitch.
Dean’s pretty sure this is going to be obnoxiously awkward, but then Amelia, who rolls with this shit far faster than anyone should, offers Michael a plate of the cookies that were just starting to brown to golden in the oven.
They eat pie on her hood, trading lazy smiles and forkfuls of deliciously baked pastry and filling. It's the kind of lazy afternoon Dean never thought he'd have, or want. The kissing starts happening between one bite and another. Sweet lips tasting like cinnamon or chocolate become almost more fascinating than the fresh slices of pie in their laps.
Dean blinks sharply. "You mean those assholes had something like this the whole time and they kept sending us in with a memorized exorcism and one stinking blade?" The anger is coming back, now that Dean's had a chance to breathe, to come to terms with the idea that Cas could be real. That Cas is here with him: solid and warm and tingly at the edges of his senses.
Dean stays leaning against the corrugated wall, hands behind his back, pressing into the metal. If he puts his hands in front of him, he’s too afraid that he'll reach out before he's ready and touch Cas, and find out it really is all in his head. "Angels can be exorcised?"
This time, the arch of his body against Castiel's feels deliberate, and a temptation--enough of one that Castiel nearly forgets that the front of his pajama pants just felt the slightest bit... damp. "C'mere, buddy, you can't give me one of those and not let me give you one, too."
Dean runs his full hand, palm flat against the skin, down Castiel's sides and then back up, barely skimming his nipples. It's another gorgeous and new sensation, but… puzzling.
Dean doesn’t look back at the crumpled box when he crawls back into Baby’s back seat and closes his eyes.
I know, I know, it still hurt even though many of you knew that it was coming... I really am sorry about that! We'll always take care of you, though, promise! (And, er, hold on nice and tight to that thought...)
He feels his grip tighten a little, and worries about it for just about a heartbeat before Cas groans against his lips. He rolls to his side, carefully not dislodging Dean’s hand.
(News flash: Cas doesn't do things that Dean expects him to do. Dean really should know this by now.)
"Eh." Bobby shrugs. "Maybe. But you also know that a free pass from us is worth a helluva a lot more than you’re makin’ it out to be. You think you’re gonna pull one over on us now because you got us over a barrel? Think again."
"Hey, uh, can I... ask you something?" he asks, because this is probably going to turn into one of those things he can't ask with Cas actually looking at him.
Sam does, his expression puzzled as he pulls out the little folded piece of paper. He skims it. It's only got one line on it, Dean knows. Dean's one class. There's a lot of blank space. Sam's lips move and his eyebrows crinkle together as he sounds out the weird combination of run-together letters and numbers that make the class code.
But Dean doesn't do any of that. He just flaps a hand impatiently, and Castiel carefully wiggles his way in.
Jimmy snorts. "Uh-huh." He doesn't sound like he believes the whole angel business. Dean doesn’t know if that’s comforting or scary, considering that he’s Castiel’s
Bobby stares at him and takes another swig of his beer. "So you didn't have sex in the back seat of your car, is what you’re sayin’?" It's said pointedly, with a snort, but Bobby's whole face is starting to soften, just a hair.
"You mean me," Sam says, and he doesn't look happy about it. He's been living on a revenge fantasy since Dean was ripped to shreds in front of him. Dean can’t blame him for that, either: hell, he’s seen it happen in their dad. Letting go of that is going to be damned hard.
He can literally feel Cas trying to comfort him, the warm static of something brushing against his sides and back. It calms some of Dean’s anxiety about things going their way for once. Because things just don’t
When Cas releases him, it's only far enough to get his lips on other parts of Dean's chest and neck. He trails the tip of his tongue back down Dean's clavicle, over the curve of his shoulder and Dean knows what's coming next, like a beautiful, fucked-out train wreck.
"You're something else, you know that?" he marvels, closing his eyes and burying his nose into Cas's sweaty hair. "Damn."
, why is it always blood). Castiel’s hand is red with it. His fingers come open, and he drops a piece of glass to the floor, smeared dark. He catches the sleeve of his trench coat before it sags into the open wound on his forearm.
Dean blinks, slowly. He probably should be thinking of some kind of objection. But his skin is aching where Cas drew a line of warmth down the middle of his chest. "Uh." He swallows, and looks down. "Did you start already?"
Once they’re living that Casper life—Dean’s not feeling up to the ‘living’ pun right this second—they see the second reaper from the street, and catch up to her inside the boy’s house. She’s got straight, black, chin-length hair and a knowing glint in her eye.
"I'm sure they think so, too. That's probably why they're trying to kill me," Cas answers, very dryly.
Cas absolutely deserves whatever he needs to keep him making those tiny happy growls and biting his lip in pleasure; Dean's toes curl a little harder into the mattress, looking for just a tiny bit more push, shoving himself upwards in a way that makes his back twang. “Yes,” Cas groans. “Yes, like that.”
Claire scowls at Sam. God, she really does look so much like Cas at his grumpiest when she does that. “Don’t you know Uncle Dean
He's not wrong though. It wasn't free, but it was a whole lot cheaper than if he was just some regular Joe Shmoe off the street. "Yeah.” Dean chuckles, softly. “And I don’t have to live in the dorms, either. Drive in three days a week with Cas. I think he called it a 'low-impact college experience.’"
"Have you done this before?" Cas rumbles, and his fingertips dip just barely into the back of Dean's jeans. Not deep, not... not anywhere Dean hasn't had grabbed or stroked or petted before, but it feels like more, and Dean's not even goddamned naked yet.
Cas allows Dean to roll them—Dean twitches a little and grabs for the edge of the bed for a second before he remembers: oh, right, king-sized mattress. No worries about falling off the bed and concussions interrupting the good stuff.
"It occurred to me, then: the parallels. Cain and Abel. My human life accidentally, I think, prepared me for this. Because Heaven likes its symbolism, Dean. Two brothers—the key and the lock—two halves. Two different sides. Then I realized: Lucifer will need a vessel when released, and, being an archangel, it can’t be just any vessel. It would have to be a strong one, or…" Cas trails off and he looks away. "One strong enough to be enhanced by demon blood."
"It won't be your fault if I die." It's a whisper, barely more than a murmur. "But it means a great deal to me that you care this much about it."
Dean shrugs. "Not really? He got me, too." Honestly, the venom had been so complete he'd forgotten that he had a boot knife right at his fingertips.
Michael is staring at them, back and forth, and his eyes come to rest just behind Dean’s navel in a way that makes Dean think he’s looking
"It's forged from an old angel blade," Cas says, re-clasping their hands together. "You're right-handed, you'll appreciate the ring the next time you need your right hook."
He's not sure how to bend down and kiss him, no matter how much he wants to, without pushing further in, but watching Cas sex-flushed, reaching down to gently fist his own half-hard cock, fingers wrapping loosely around himself and just sort of petting... that doesn't help Dean’s control. That definitely doesn't help.
Cas shakes his head, and chuckles. “Maybe a bit.” If he were the kind of guy who winked, Dean thinks he'd wink. "But if we're talking about in-laws... Sam is a good man who's doing whatever he can to stop the end of the world," Cas continues—like it's obvious to him, an angel who can possibly see souls, and it should be obvious to everyone else. "I know that, and so do you. He's stronger than what's in his veins." He smiles. "I didn't think I'd ever have in-laws, either—for reasons that are very different from yours. But I'm happy with the one I do have."
"So," she says, and then shakes her head. "I don't want any part of this angel-demon dance off. I just want to do my job."
He gets a long blank stare for his troubles before Cas leans in and asks into his ear, breath hot. "Why, are you hot for teacher?"
Cas stalks past them both, then sinks down into a squeaky recliner that whines under him like it's weeping. He doesn't put his head into his hands, but he does look down at his palms, his knees. Maybe he's remembering Anna. Maybe the guilt's too heavy for him to raise his chin.
They get out just in time: just as they pull the car out of the convent’s cracked, overgrown driveway, Cas spots the first run of demons, from further away than human eyes can see.
Castiel's not exactly sure how they got there--he peeks over Dean's shoulder at where his own ankles are dangling awkwardly off the edge--but he's not exactly sorry about it, either. Then when he shifts to relieve some weight and
Dean catches a glimpse of a warm, dark amber liquid in a fancy smooth-sided bottle, and a white label saying
It's so much better without clothes on. He can't even be embarrassed about the warm, wet smear he's leaving on Dean's skin.
Dean tilts his head to give Cas more room all while slowly rubbing at the firm muscles under his thumb. Cas's ass feels amazing, no matter how he's touching it and he can feel Cas's legs spreading just slightly around him at the pressure he uses. This time, when Dean flashes to something that happened only a few days ago, it's to the quiet, content sounds Cas made, that moment his finger first pressed inside Cas’s body.
Dean's chest rattles. He pushes a bit more; their fingers tangle further. "I gotta say… that's a little intense." He pauses. "Still, I think maybe I would have married you."
The kit’s in the Impala, but they’ve been running around trying to keep seals from breaking like damned monkeys, and there’s been no time and money to restock since the last emergency. There’s no gauze in there. "Yeah. I got it." Dean ruffles around in his duffel, and pulls out the cleanest bandana square he's got.
Dean pulls into Cas's side as he wakes up—or he tries to, because he reaches out to pat at the bed, and, uh, it's just him in it. He blinks himself awake. What the hell? The curve where Cas's body settled is still warm, though.
"They're homemade," Cas's little niece says, yanking hard on Michael’s sleeve and pointing at the cookie like this is really important. She scowls at him like she’s annoyed she has to explain this again. "You have to eat it. While it's warm. That's what makes it special."
Cas is still leaning over him, propped up on his arms, rather than flopped the rest of the way onto his chest, Dean realizes. He'd be a little insulted that he didn't make Cas go all boneless on top of him if it weren't for the fact that this position gives Dean a good look at the expression on his face: lips flushed and pouting, eyes half-open slits of blown blue, chin tilted downwards. In the little gap between their bodies, Cas hasn't gone soft yet—just like last time.
But Dean knows that the stink of the pyre is still in Sam's nose, just like it's in his own. Sam is looking out the window, silent in a way he hasn't been in a long while. His shoulders are down and his jaw clenches every few heartbeats.
But Cas just smiles against the side of Dean's cock, the nudge of his lips like a seesaw of careful heat. "I thought we'd said something about going without underwear," he teases.
I don't know who I feel sorrier for in that encounter: Crowley or Bobby! So they've got the scythe now... what do y'all think they're going to do with it? (Aiyah, Cas really can't keep his paws off that handprint, though, can he?)
He's happy and laughing as he and Cas walk from the shed to the main house, their elbows bumping and pressing from how close they’re walking. Dinner is one of the best meals he can remember in a long time, even with the blade of detox hanging over Sam's head. The food tastes better than he remembers (even though Bobby made it). The company feels softer and more comfortable, and even Bobby's slightly under-lit living space feels brighter and clearer.
Besides, the look on Cas's face when Dean reaches down with his free hand and neatly wraps it around both of them, tucking their cocks together in his fist, makes it
think that the warm, buzzy feeling he feels in his shoulder or the bottom of his chest must be made-up. It's too good, and that doesn’t normally belong in their lives. "That sounds... nice."
Bobby shoos Dean out of the way when Dean almost knocks over one of the piles of books for leaning closer to listen. Dean grumbles, but he heads down to make sure that the scythe is stowed securely. Baby's gotta be in tip-top shape, 'cause she's gonna go for the ride of her life soon.
He almost doesn't make it: he pumps fast and smooth just twice before Cas's breath catches and stalls out. His back arches, and streaks of come decorate Cas's abs. Dean nurses him carefully through it with gentle strokes until he's a shivering wreck.
Dean's lips are moist; Castiel's aren't, and he's afraid they probably taste like toothpaste. But Dean doesn't seem to mind.
Sam pops back in a few minutes later and Dean parks them in the right spot. Dean directs Sam to the bags while he leans into the back seat and runs a reassuring hand down Cas's side, meeting his pained smile with one of his own. Dean wants to crawl in there with him, hold him close and reassure both of them that Cas is gonna be fine. Instead, he helps him out of the backseat and walks him into their new motel room.
Dean doesn't even move. He can’t. He can see what’s happening, can see Sam drinking in long pulls, shuddering. He doesn’t want to believe it, but he also…
"You're not suggesting, you're saying it!" Sam exclaims. He shoots a hard look at Dean like he's saying "You see this?"
Dean watches Cas reach out, hand glowing already, and he can feel the effort Cas has to put into it to even get the process started. Even before he touches Jimmy, Cas falters, the light flickering. Dean puts a hand on the nearest knee in support—out of instinct more than anything. The light strengthens and Cas resumes healing with a vengeance.
He turns Cas around, both of them shuffling and bumping in the tiny shower, and pours out the contents of the tiny little bottle of motel shampoo into his hand before setting his fingers in Cas's hair. It's weird: he hasn't washed anyone like this since Sammy was a kid, and God knows he's never had anyone do it to him since he was, well, old enough to wash himself. But he vaguely remembers it feeling nice.
Cas kisses the back of Dean’s neck and rubs his hip, just like that first night. Dean’s so busy savoring the feeling of not having lost everything that he finds himself asleep before he's ready.
Dean doesn't have much to say to that. But he's not sorry for saying what he did, either. He knows he was right, too. And right now, they don't know what the hell is more right.
"Thanks, Bobby," he mumbles, finally. Shit, he doesn't even know what to do with the fact that not only does Bobby not have an issue with Cas being a guy, he just... made up a room for them. "Thanks."
when they were talking about his memories. “I need to hear about these dreams one day." He says it into Cas's skin, warm and tender. "Did you wake up hard?" Dean asks; whispers. "Or did you come in your pants?"
Crowley snaps his fingers, and a long scroll of parchment appears in his hands, dribbling down to the dirt floor under him. "Now,” he produces a pen and clicks it dramatically. “Who shall I make this out to?"
That gets them to about 2 PM, and as they put all of the gear away in the places they'll want it come tomorrow evening, Dean considers what to do with the rest of their time.
Dean shrugs. Okay then. "So, what, you're just gonna take some divine bong hit, and, shazam, you're Michael Landon?"
Pamela prowls a figure-eight around Castiel and Jimmy, and there's no 'like' about which one she's deciding to take a bite out of. Dean almost chuckles. No wonder Bobby recommended her. Jimmy's a little red-faced. Cas is turning just his eyes to watch her. She looks up and grins, glancing between their faces. "Are you two identical in
Dean's ready to argue—again with the angel who can't smite a puppy and might not even be able to walk under his own power. But the look on Cas's face stops that argument.
Charlie goes on for a good five minutes about the hows and whys of her choice of weighted blanket for Dean. It's a darker color, forest green, a bit bigger and heavier for his size and weight, that kind of thing.
Cas's laugh is even more rueful. "He might understand," he answers. "But celestial bureaucracy doesn't involve paperwork. Somehow, that makes it worse."
Dean grunts. "Sounds good." He shifts, and Castiel tries to raise himself away, but he's under the blanket and his body is sluggish with sleep. So he doesn't move as Dean's arm encircles him. "Go back to sleep, too damned early."
Dean didn't mean it that way, as a rejection. He didn't want to make this into more of a fight than it already is. Fuck, he didn't even think about it at all.
Ruby barely glances at him, all her attention focused on Sam. "That angels can't be trusted. Why should he?” She flicks her fingers towards Cas, but doesn’t even look at him. “For all we know, he's some kind of Heavenly double agent."
When Dean does take the whole thing into his hand, it jumps, because Cas does an involuntary thrust into his fist before groaning loudly and biting his lip. Dean watches, fascinated, as his first upstroke seems to help a pearl of liquid squeeze out of the head. His thumb swipes it up gently, and he twists carefully on the downstroke to spread it around.
He's forced to eat his words when he thanks Ruby, ‘cause she came through. This time. Castiel and Jimmy seem perturbed, but whole and healthy.
Cas is watching him, smiling, when Dean looks up. “Spanakorizo,” he says. “What you’re tasting is the dill.”
"Okay," Dean says, feeling a bit better, at least physically. The creases in his jeans when he moves sometimes press against the bruises on his hip and that's also starting to be soothing. "If this were for real, I'd start tracking him right away."
But Cas's fingers ease gently under the edge of Dean's shirt, helping untuck it from where it got snagged under his weight... well, that's warm and nice, a little tickly. The knot in Dean's chest unwinds a little.
"Lilith," Sam squeezes out. The pages crumple under his fingers. His eyes are tight and red. "He wrote about Lilith. And... and me."
Bobby's probably right, but the truth is, Dean's just about ready to snap about this whole thing. So who the hell knows?
Dean knows he must be feeling better, because he can't help but let out a dirty little laugh at the word 'release'. Cas's smile widens a little sheepishly, and the rumble of his laugh overlaps it. Together, they both relax just a little. Cas's arms are still solid around him but there's a release of tension that converts the hold into something a little softer.
Dean taps his fingers on the steering wheel and the tension that thrums through his body is nearly suffocating. He needs to do something. He needs to
But Dean's still not brave enough to ask for some things, and in response to Cas's curious little head tilt when he hands Dean a towel, he shakes his head. "Nah, uh, I, nothing."
At some point, Cas starts kissing other parts of him—down his chin, neck, across his collarbone and finally, one careful lick along the edge of the palm print Cas is still holding onto for dear life.
Dean sees Cas's eyes widen, too, like he's just realized something important, and then he chuckles—softly, under his breath. "Your brother made some… unmanly yelps,” Cas says, solemnly. “He's trying to preserve your dignity."
Cas runs his hand down Dean's chest, warm circles on his breastbone and then his stomach. He skims, briefly, lightly, over Dean's hard cock and they both shudder.
"Hold on, I'm not falling asleep like this," he protests, laughing. He reaches under the driver's side for the wet wipes. Cas gets on board with the clean up after that, even if he makes faces at the cold wetness.
Cas looks sad, but he lets it go in favor of turning back to Dean. "Heaven doesn't like disobedience. Even without all my memories, they'll want me squashed before rumors can start."
Yeah, that sounds about right. They shuffle back into the main research area of the house. Bobby eventually points to the middle menu. "That place isn't bad, it'll deep fry just about anything. Try the oreos, they'll knock your socks off."
Cas is crinkling up beside him, hunching deeper into his trenchcoat with a furrow appearing between his eyebrows. "Crowley? Do you mean the little man who sold his soul for..." Cas clears his throat, twice, and shakes his head. "Why does the king of the crossroads demons have Death's old scythe?"
They don't look at a newspaper. They don't look up weird crap, or demon omens. For just one goddamned afternoon, they don't.
for lack of a better word, coming from Cas's body. "I dunno, sounds like a chick flick." He pulls their hands up until their forearms are pressing together against Dean's chest.
It's fantastic. Dean curves his fingers, starts feeling out the strong walls holding him in. He knows he accidentally brushes his target once because Cas sucks in a sharp breath and goes silky-tight. Dean waits for him to relax and then he goes back over the same spot, slow and steady until finally—
"Good things do happen, Dean," he says, and it's gentle. "And you deserved to be saved. I'd know this even if I didn't know my own name."
. He wants selfishly and unreservedly, and not in the way he's wanted other things in his life. Getting laid and getting hammered are fun, but he doesn't
"I'm not sure you should be poking around Cassie's brain," Jimmy says, shifting from foot to foot. "Cassie, you remember..."
And then the poor spelled schmoe whispers, "She said—Jasmine said—we would be together, forever, if... if only Vicky was..." and Dean's not sure which of them, the guy or him, feels more sick about it.
Dean doesn't have any damned idea how to answer that, and they're halfway to the door by the time he realizes that, for a second there, he actually forgot that they're going to meet that pretty girl reaper's boss. Big man capital D, Death.
Dean’s all of a sudden right there again, a few hours ago: a wet rag in his hand, looking down at a cold, inert body lying on a machining table, Cas's face slack and bloodied.
Dean yanks back out of the kiss with a gasp and falls back down to the bed, his blood running sluggish and cold
Cas, though, doesn't smile. "He's a Prophet of the Lord. Please don't threaten him.” He arches one sassy little eyebrow. “No matter how much you might want to."
"Not war, Castiel. What comes after. Paradise," Anna murmurs, and the bliss on her face is almost a caricature. "Aren't you tired of all of this? Existence puttering along without guidance, slowly decaying into madness?"
Dean smiles against his skin and pulls himself a little further over Cas, half-overlapping. "We shouldn't... what?"
Dean wants to hear more of that low, deep, throaty sound. Feeling it vibrate against his neck is addictive. Cas, on top of him, is heavy and breathtaking and luxurious.
Just as Bobby pulls Baby out of park, Dean can feel the slight pop in the brakes that’s a trademark of someone not familiar with driving his car. The usual indignation about it is absent, but beside him, Sam lifts his head and stirs, sitting forward...
But Cas just keeps rubbing his finger back and forth in the crease of Dean’s ass, just... petting, sort of. It's the only place he's touching Dean directly—everywhere else is just legs and t-shirt and... did they forget to take off their clothes again? Dammit.
They both need a shower, neither of them have cleaned off for something like three days, and somewhere in the middle there was the most intense and gross fistfight in the history of everything. Dean might still have tiny bits of exploded Lilith on him.
When he hears the soft crunch of footsteps, Dean knows his nerves should jump, heavy. That his hand should fall to his Colt, that he should be saying "Who's there?" Just because this is Bobby's, and it’s always been safe, ‘safe’ doesn’t mean jack shit these days. It doesn't mean they ain't got the forces of Heaven and Hell out to get them.
Zachariah, who apparently never met a boast he couldn't resist, eventually tells them about the preachers, sneering all the while. Yeah, yeah, so smart. Dean takes notes for future reference.
Cas finally looks away and Dean feels like he can breathe again. "There are moments. Different times.” He shifts around. “I think I was in Egypt during the plagues. Also, Babylon during the great exile. Sodom seemed like it was a nice place before, well."
The smirk that Cas gives him before his expression smooths out doesn't help, either. Dammit, that full mouth is made for that look.
Holy shit, Dean did that. He got Cas off. The wonder of it punches him almost as hard as every muscle in his pelvis tightening, his balls pressing up because he needs to come so bad, and then he's there, too.
Jimmy, though, is full-on scowling, now. "So you're telling me you two met six months ago, are married now, and neither of you thought to tell
"This isn't something you usually do." With other men. After all, Castiel had said it himself right at the beginning: he thought he was going to want things that Dean couldn't give him.
He's not looking to start anything, though. He takes Cas's bloody hands and pours liquid soap into them, sudsing them over and over until they're clean. Until there's no more blood staining the floor. Cas watches it go, and while Dean can't always tell what's bothering someone, he knows that look.
Dean doesn't imagine Cas's reluctance or annoyance at the question. It's all there on his face to see.
There's some debate about if they should stay another night or not. Dean doesn’t care: he's done his laundry, picked up a few things he needs and he's not going to call Cas away from something important for a second day in a row (no matter how much he wants to). The question is solved for them when Sam finds them a case that night over takeout Chinese.
Dean clenches his fist hard enough that he can feel his fingernails dig into his skin. "Well, I got some news for you: on at least one front, you ain't as observant as you think you are."
However, as Dean closes his eyes in his empty motel room and prays to Cas, he finds he can't care all that much just yet. He's not exactly pining, but he does miss the way it feels to have Cas in the same room as him. After a quick prayer and a mental wink, Dean grabs his laundry.
Dean’s got no problem with girls; of course he doesn’t. Maybe he should be happy he’s making it with a hot redhead in this story. But he also just knows the reality of it was so much better than any of this bullshit: so much hotter, so
Sam, though, almost looks relieved when he drops into the sofa and crosses his arms. "You slept with her." He lets out a deep sigh. "Oh, thank God. I was getting really worried, Dean. I mean, it's not good that you... but..." his face does this weird twist. "Nick said that you just needed space, to get back into your paces, but seriously, Dean, a siren?" He leans forward. "We can work with this, though! What did she want from you?"
Bobby looks at the box like it might have something dead in it (har har) when they bring it in, but he doesn't look any more pleased than Dean feels about the whole shitty business. "You had lunch with the Big Daddy Reaper himself, and brought home
The room is organized chaos. It's not that there's a lot of clutter on the floor, but that there's a whole wall of shelves full of books and papers, and a desk in the corner with stacks of more. There's stuff on the walls, some framed things of old paper that look super religious, but other artsy stuff that just looks decorative: a little thing made of pieces of colored glass, a few pictures that are almost certainly Claire’s drawings. There's a neat basket of unfolded laundry off to the side, next to a chest of drawers in dark wood. The top drawer is still left partially open.
. He looks about a foot taller than he should in a pair of white sneakers, asylum wear and a trench coat. His hand is raised, ready to fight or defend, but there’s something off about the stance—like he’s missing something.
Dean stops at the top of the stairs and takes a moment before shakily taking them down. It's quiet in the basement. The panic room isn't soundproof, yet, but its walls are thick and reinforced. Quiet sounds don't really make it out of the room.
Dean absolutely does not look at Cas or blush or shuffle awkwardly or duck his head. Nope. He's just gonna pretend that was never said, and be a much happier and more comfortable person that way.
Dean eagerly wedges his hips upwards, and Cas shimmies his jeans down to just under the curve of his ass; Dean’s never been so glad that he wears loose jeans before. It's a little breathtaking to feel the warm metal of the Impala through just his shorts, and the contrast to the sharp night air is something else. Cas's hands then trail down, down, down to his left shoe, which is deftly untied and pulled off, dropped... somewhere, Dean doesn't care where. Then his jeans are slowly shifted again, just far enough down for Cas to bend his left knee and pull.
Cas nods into his brother's shoulder and holds him tight. Dean's having trouble holding onto his own emotions. There's a sharp tickle in his throat and a prickle in his eyes. He knows this reunion all-too-well—hell, he’s lived it—and doesn't begrudge them this time.
"What are you on, Dean?" Sam asks, low and dangerous. "You've got some nerve, getting on my case about the demon blood, when you..."
Sam plays confused well: that’s the upside of a life hustling pool and faking authority figures, you learn to act pretty decently.
Okay, they’re going to have to have a talk about doing insane, reckless things that can get them all killed. And Dean’s gonna ignore the glass house he’s standing inside with a rock in hand.
For the first time, Adam smiles. He doesn't look anything like Dean or Sam. It's fucking crazy. "I don't think he does," the kid admits. "But he seems okay, I guess. I think he's just curious about you guys. In a way that's sort of weird and stiff. Like my biochemistry teacher."
"Holy shit," Dean rasps. He doesn't remember screaming, but he sure must have strained something. "I mean it. Holy shit."
At first he thinks Dean is going to lash out when the weight traps his feet, but he just shudders again and Castiel nudges the rest of the blanket up to his shoulders.
He knew about the demon powers thing, but he didn’t ask why. He’d let it go because things seemed to be getting better, and because of fucking Lilith, he hadn't asked too many questions.
"You want... you want me to give it back?!" Crowley splutters, leaning back from the barrier like he thinks Bobby might be contagious. "Are you mental? That's not a deal, that's a bloomin' loan!"
On the next slide downwards, though, Dean's lips meet the curl of his fingers, and that feels like a triumph. He moans, himself, before he thinks about how that might feel for Cas.
Cas puts a gentle hand on Dean's arm. "Dean. She's visible to the human eye. She probably knows I'm in here and is waiting for us to respond to her presence. If a reaper was sent to take Sam, we'd have no idea." He pauses. "I'd be hard-pressed to be aware of one when not in the same room, especially right now."
Cas's face is a mess. It's bloody and bruised and Dean can just imagine what the rest of him looks like. Dean looks at the preparation table. Next to the shroud and the ropes are soap and a big metal bowl of water, a couple of the industrial rags that Bobby buys in bulk for the cars. Hunter burial rites aren't really that big on ritual, but sometimes they die with crap on them you don't want burning near other humans.
Jimmy makes a small sound in his throat like he's about to cry. Castiel wedges him further back into the corner. "Try," he growls.
(Yeah, Cas is definitely, one hundred percent, hearing at least some of Dean's thoughts. Dean's almost sure he's not going to survive him. Holy fuck. What a way to go, though.)
It's almost insulting how unsurprised Bobby is... though he did find in the lore how to kill the thing, so he must've known a little more about sirens than they do.
Dean's almost startled by the feel of Cas’s cock pushing into his palm: he almost forgot, for a second, that he still had a hand around both of them. When he sneaks a glance downwards... oh, yeah, nothing about the line of Cas's body says that he's having any pain at all. The head of his cock is flushed purple, and he’s dripping down onto Dean in a steady, silvery stream. He moves his fingers, and Dean watches, mesmerized, as a new bead wells up at his slit.
Whatever Dean’s planning to say to Bobby—and whatever it is, it’d probably get him called ‘boy’ or ‘you damned idjit’—is interrupted by his phone ringing.
Death finishes up his beef rib, and sighs in pleasure, like his expression never changed at all a few seconds ago. He takes up a little finger wipe to clean off his fingers, and dabs at the corners of his mouth. "I'm saying
Cas shrugs. "I'm monitoring the area. I suspect that unless Chuck is in direct and dire danger, they're more likely to want to use this opportunity to attempt to track us after we leave."
It's the needle they were looking for in the haystack of all those books. Lock and key. They have a possible place, now.
"Guess maybe if things'd been different, I would have liked it better," he says, flicking the edge of the thick paper with his thumb. "'Cause they're different now, and it was kinda fun."
God, he’s so fucking adorable. Cas has got no-one but himself to blame when Dean tilts down and nips his neck hard enough to leave a mark. Cas’s whole body jerks. Dean leans back to admire his work, and frowns a bit as the tiny red mark slowly disappears. Dean runs a casual finger along the spot; Cas shivers. "So, you've got angel healing?"
"Fine," Crowley finally bites out, after an extended staring contest with Bobby. "Your soul for Death's castoffs, to be returned with all proper paperwork followed—assuming Lilith becomes demon paste, and you stop fiddling with the lock on Lucifer’s cage"
"Hey! No playing the angel card," Dean protests. "Besides, you ain’t pulling that wool over my eyes. That's Shakespeare, not religion."
This time, Dean ducks in first, wedging himself into the corner that the bench seat and the other door make. Cas climbs in after him, reaching for Dean with one knee pulled up on the bench seat before he's even settled. This kiss is rougher, dirtier. Cas grasps at Dean, his hands running all over. They're warm and distracting by the time they inch their way under Dean's shirts, splaying wide and possessive over his sides.
"So..." Dean murmurs, in between one kiss and the next. He scoops up the last bite of apple pie, with that last perfect crisp-soft piece of baked apple and a crunchy bit of crust, and looks at its pretty silhouette balanced on the fork before holding out to Cas. "Still agnostic on pie?"
"Dean?" Cas is leaning over him, back in his eye-line, alive and breathing and full of color. His baby blues are wide and worried. "I'm here, Dean. I'm here."
Dinner takes a weird turn, though. Bobby and Cas do most of the talking, but it quickly veers from 16th century diaspora-based language shifts—why does Bobby even know about this stuff?—to weirdly mundane but Cas-centric things.
"Either way," Bobby nods towards the stairs that lead to the panic room. Sam’s stopped yelling. Dean doesn’t know if that’s better, or worse. "For now, you got a little time on your hands, might be something you can use to take your mind off things."
"So…" Sam draws it out and Cas might get the hint if he weren't still looking at Dean. Sam huffs. "What happened?"
Cas nods frantically at him, and a bitten back "mmhmm" comes out of his mouth. Their movements get sharper and Cas drops his head again, pressing their foreheads together. "Yes," he whispers. "Like that."
have worked. I’m originally of Heaven, Dean. It would have been excruciating for me, but it still should have been easy to simply throw me back. But I think… I think our connection is… outside of the bounds of natural order of the universe in many ways.” Cas swallows, and Dean can hear the effort that it takes. “I think I was… I
They both peek down at the way it all but jumped between their bellies. Cas smiles. Dean would laugh if he weren't feeling so damned nervous.
Dean snorts. They're in small-town Maryland, so Dean expects at least some kind of sideways look when they walk into the little Greek restaurant. Together. Hand-in-hand. Cas doesn’t try to let go. Neither does Dean. Not even when the eyes of the middle-aged lady manning the check-in podium drop to their joined fingers.
"Yeah, sure, Sam." Is Cas's color supposed to be this way? He's not bleeding anymore that Dean can tell, but the way Cas keeps trying to give him a reassuring smile is the last thing from reassuring. "What?"
It felt really fucking awesome when Cas moved against Dean, so is it gonna be just as good for Cas if Dean does the same? He gives a shaky push upwards with his hips to find out.
When Pamela gets there to help them with this new brand of fucking insanity—becoming ghosts is really a new low for them—she gives him one long look, but she doesn't say anything about what must be going through his noggin. Dean breathes a sigh of relief. He’s not exactly excited to be drawn right back into all of this apocalypse bullshit, but this is the family business, and it’s all he’s got left.
Then, like it's nothing, he leans into Baby's frame and drops a kiss on Dean's lips. Freedom tastes like the smile that he presses into Dean's. Dean sighs, feeling Sam's unhappy energy in the car door slam that follows.
Jesus Christ, Dean did not miss anything by skipping regular dating for the first 29 years of his life.
Yeah, he's pissed at the accusation. Yeah, this is fucked up. But yeah, Dean didn't exactly expect that he'd send an angel flying with a punch, either, so how could he expect Sam to get it?
But the position Cas's head is in puts his ear right in front of Dean's mouth. Dean grins and puffs a little cool breath of air right into Cas's ear, and follows it up with a slow lick up his earlobe.
It's such a weird thing for Sam to say that Dean's brain stalls on it for a second. Huh. Sam sure as shit didn't say anything like that the last time they saw each other, at Bobby's for Thanksgiving. Then again, they spent a lot of time that weekend teaching Cas to shoot a shotgun.
Cas brings him in for a soft, soft kiss. One hand, the one not holding the lube, comes back up, and strokes Dean’s cheek. When he backs off, he looks so patient. "Dean, I do not think I would ever say no to you… well, barring certain circumstances such as shared bathroom walls.” Cas smiles a little sheepishly, and that makes the weird twisting tension in Dean’s belly ease up a little. “But I am uncomfortable relying solely on our connection to communicate during sex."
"No," Dean replies, automatically. It's not rational at first, but after he takes a second to check more than his gut, really, it's not a good idea anyway. "Let's not give anyone who calls themselves ‘king of anything-related-to-Hell’ more information than they need."
"Come on sweetheart," Dean encourages him, and the nickname sends a jolt of heady pleasure through Castiel’s already overworked system. "You can do it." He nips at Castiel's jaw briefly before returning to looking into his eyes. "I want you to."
Cas's chuckle has that same tiny edge of hysteria that Dean feels going through his whole body. "I don't think there are words in any language to describe how 'okay' I am," he says, and the small, sleepy smile makes that not a lie.
The bottom curves of his ribs probably should hurt the most, Dean would figure, but Cas is sucking gently on the side of his neck in long, drawing pulls by then, and Dean can hardly lift his own head from where it's lolled back on his shoulders and a little to the side. "You givin' me a hickey, Cas?" he slurs.
Dean's expecting Tessa to leave pretty quickly after that, but she pauses, hesitating. She lays a lot of home truths on him—shit he already knows, deep down, all about how they all lie to themselves. But what gives him pause is the last thing that she tells him.
"Maryland," Cas says, smoothly, once he's translated the coordinates from the Nigerian Prince’s plea for help. Then he pauses and gets a faraway look on his face. "Wait." He pulls the laptop up and types quickly. "There's a church… no, a convent. I remember reading about it in one of my classes. It was a blip, really. But someone had put together a lecture about Theology and the Psychopath, and the circumstances were… memorably gory. I wasn't really interested, but I never put it together before now."
‘The important thing is not to think much, but to love much; and so, do that which best stirs you to love.’
Cas shivers against Dean, but he opens his eyes. "Will it make you feel any better," he says, his dark gravel even rustier, "If I said 'be not afraid, only believe?'"
Cas pets his hair, gently, like he can't stand to let go any more than Dean can. His eyes are pretty damned calm for someone who just politely offered Dean the chance to murder someone, as easily as he'd offer him a cup of coffee. "I was not privy to what he did to you." Cas's jaw clenches, then relaxes. "But I saw what he wanted you to become. That you did not is a testament to you, but... he remains what he is. Hell's torturer. A demon. Don't you want him dead?"
"Come here?" Cas says, sad and a little pleading. That place where their connection should be inside Dean aches and pulses like a cut artery. "Please? I... I can't see you from here. It's worse, when I can hear you but I can't see you."
Cas looks away from Dean, then. "Likely. But... as I said, Heaven likes its parallels. Two brothers, on opposite sides." Cas turns back to him, this time looking shaky and desperate again. "You have to understand, Dean, when I first came back this was all vague supposition. Until recently, I had no real proof, and there were too many other things to worry about first. I would have told you if I’d known for sure. I would have."
Cas comments, over his shoulder, "It is not creepy if there is consent." Then he goes back to talking with Bobby in a normal voice.
"Last time I checked," Dean answers, before he has the time to let his brain catch up with his mouth.
"Sam?" Cas says. There's a gentleness to his voice that Dean’s not used to hearing when it’s not just the two of them. "May I see those?"
Angels might not need to breathe, but Dean hears Cas's quick, sucked-in breath. And for an instant the world is cold and sharp again, because shit, shit, what is Dean even doing? Cas is a fucking
Dean doesn't give two shits about the fact that they're in public and they're both guys. He probably should care, he knows, 'cause someday they're going to be someplace where that won't fly. But right now, that doesn't matter.
But Cas is lying next to him, their bodies cooling on Baby's hood with the dark of a late winter night wrapping them close. Sam is probably snoring his sinuses out in their motel room. There’s a voicemail from Bobby on Dean’s phone. They’ve got some people to save and an Apocalypse to stop.
And that shit with demons and deals and Lucifer? That's gonna be a problem for tomorrow, not tonight.
When Dean opens his mouth and gently tucks the head of Cas's cock against his tongue, the low noise that Cas makes can't even be completely muffled against the back of his hand.
. With no permission from Castiel whatsoever, his entire body arches against Dean, and it’s delicious.
When Cas starts talking, finally, it’s into the notch between Dean’s collarbones. "Heaven has always been far too interested in you and Sam," he begins, very quietly. "I suspect your parents were targeted by a cupid to ensure your births." Cas's fingers start drawing nonsense patterns on Dean’s chest. "You have to understand Dean, I remade you, from atoms, from carbon and oxygen and iron. Your body, or what was left of it, was only good for the blueprints, but I only needed a small amount of material from it to add to what I was building—essentially, so that your soul would see this body as your own. Human bodies refresh completely every seven years or so; this isn't much different than that, only I did it all at once." He looks up, then, chin perching on Dean's sternum. "You learn things about a person, putting them together piece by piece like that."
"That was your rectus abdominis muscles, I'm going for your psoas now," Cas murmurs. His fingers press down and weirdly inward, away from Dean’s hipbones. It's hot and bizarrely relaxing at the same time. Dean wasn’t even aware of the slight ache before Cas just soothed it out.
Dean might be a little impatient by the time Cas has it open, but it's Cas who reaches out and catches him by the shoulder again like he can't stand to let go for any longer.
"I'm not going anywhere," Cas murmurs. "Not even if I were sure my legs could support me." He leans in to kiss the salt tracks off Dean's face before resting their foreheads together. "Dean, if it's alright with you, I'd prefer never to leave your side again."
A loud slam breaks the kiss apart. "Dean!" Sam's voice calls from Bobby's patio, luckily out of sight of where Dean and Cas are standing. It’s still too close: the house is only a few yards away. "I think I found it!"
Like the tickle of someone else’s hair against Castiel’s cheek, or cloth he’s not wearing under his fingers, stretched over taut, sleep-warm skin.
Also, he's not going to admit it, but Cas using Baby to finish getting off? That's, uh… that's the kind of thing Dean's gonna have to think long and hard about: whether he finds that just really hot in general, or if it's just that Cas has defiled Dean’s car in a way even Dean hasn't, and that somehow gives him strange wiggly feelings in his stomach.
Until Dean kicks out a leg and wraps an ankle around Cas’s. Cas smiles into his bite of eggs, but says nothing.
Dean has to clear his throat twice before he can say, his heart is still hammering in his chest, "Yeah, what, Sammy?"
Then Cas’s gaze searches Dean’s face—lips, nose, cheek, forehead—and he licks his lips. When he meets Dean’s eyes again, the blue is just a thin rim around his pupils in the dark. “Please,” he says. “I want to know you.”
"You have to understand that being an angel is... insulating,” Cas begins, his voice halting and awkward. He doesn't meet either of their eyes. “The world is beautiful—it's God's creation—but it doesn't move us. Humans are kind or cruel, generous or petty, but that was all just them being made... fallible: by our Father, by Lucifer's temptation. We were—I was... above all that."
"How much do you know now?" Cas asks, gently, when Dean can't get words out. "Do you know who we are?"
Cas opens his mouth. He doesn't say anything else before he closes it. Which just goes to show maybe he's not as socially blind as he lets on.
Dean can't imagine having to wait over 30 years (or 3 billion) to learn about his own body like that. For all that this is new to Dean, it's not new in that way.
?” she demands, with all the intense judgment of the third-grader she is. “What kind of brother are you, anyway?”
"I went to Hell to save mine," Dean answers, and Jimmy stops dead. Sam flinches. Dean doesn't. "So, yeah. I do. But this isn't about me, it's about you guys being Cas's family, so we're gonna be helping you whether or not you're willing, buddy."
Fed at the hospital. It’s not the first time it’s happened, won’t be the last—it’s why Bobby knows how to scare the shit out of real agents—but the timing’s never good.
Normally that's Dean's line, and it brings a tired smirk to his lips. "Sunshine Motel off the highway?"
He pulls Sam aside firmly, and gives him the rundown. Sam at first looks pissed, then intrigued, and then kind of delighted—at the Adam part, that is.
Uh. So uh. The word count on that scene surprised both of us? This is when I knew Tia and I were in trouble, though admittedly it wasn't till chapter 10 or so I declared us a fanfic OSHA violation waiting to happen.
Cas moves quickly, doesn't he? Well, he knew just what he wanted! Just wanted to reassure everyone that YES, this goes happily, and YES, more good times are coming for the boyos... eventually...
"Nah," Dean answers. "No, if I really wasn't interested, it'd be fine with him. I think he just wants me to know I can do it."
"Human life is… short," Cas begins, slowly. "Especially compared to an angel's. What may look like fate, or even random chance, because someone can only see a small part of a grander scheme... seems more like careful deliberation the more I look at it."
Dean shares a look with Cas, who mostly shrugs: he'll follow Dean's lead. "Well, that's the thing, isn't it Crowley? Haven't you been paying attention?" Dean opens his arms wide, as if to gesture at the current scene they find themselves in. "Prophecy's gone off the rails. Why do you think Heaven is so bent out of shape?"
Dean's whole world is still rattling from the punch that almost twisted his head around when the whole world lights up in cold white shadows around them.
Castiel heard Dean make those rough little sounds, when he was an angel. He never once considered what effect hearing them might have on
A future. Not just hunting, but a future with Sam and Cas. Going to see Cas's brother and sister-in-law and niece again. Planning on it.
Jimmy put his mug down with a hard click. Dean almost flinches, but not quite. It's not warmth in Jimmy's voice, but there's surprise there when he says, "I thought for sure you were going to lie about that, if anything."
He dips his head and takes Cas's mouth instead, hot and indelicate, his hand coming around the back of Cas's head to grip his messed-up dark hair, not exactly gently.
Cas shakes his head and it's obvious he pities her just from the angle of his chin. "Just because you do not understand something, doesn't make it not worth understanding. And no, I'm not tired of existence.” His eyes flick to Dean’s. “I would very much like to enjoy at least the next forty to sixty years of it."
Cas arcs both of his eyebrows, completely fucking unperturbed. "Six months and thirty-odd years, if we're actually counting." He shrugs with just his shoulders. “‘We stayed a day or part of a day.  Ask of those who keep account.’”
"I'm trying to do something here," Cas says without much heat. He's smiling, eyes sparkling, and that sex flush that Dean loves is spreading slowly over his body.
Charlie sniffs in Dean’s direction, but Castiel can hear the laughter in it now. "If you're not nice to me, handmaiden,” she announces, haughtily, “you'll never learn the glory of sleeping squashed!"
Dean runs a nervous hand through his hair. "Yeah. That's a thing we—I decided. When I'm here and not out there. Turns out, it's easier to figure out a new life if you've got a name that's never been on the FBI's Most Wanted."
Dean sticks his foot out—he knows better than to use his hand—to keep the door from slamming in his face. "Wait! Wait, seriously. It's, uh... it's..."
It’s also the first time they’re going looking for a psychic-or-something that managed to crack himself out of the looney bin by squashing an orderly behind a chest of drawers. One that was supposed to be
Cas answers, honestly, "Sir, considering that your existence means that your, your brothers most likely also exist, I think we would prefer to not be that... much of a topic of discussion."
Charlie grabs Dean by the ears to drag him down to her level and turns his head back and forth. "Handmaid," she announces, "this time sharing deal is clearly not working out for you. Luckily, your queen is here with your salvation!"
Dean shakes his head, and touches the line of his own angel blade. And with that, Sam's out the door.
Jimmy flinches at that. But her words put a different kind of choke in Dean's throat, shit. He's not gonna be able to talk at all, is he? 'Cause he's never gonna forget the way Cas said, so softly,
Dean's back arches so hard that his hips leave Baby's back seat, and that shoves his cock through the cup of Cas's fingers.
to find his little brother curled up  on the floor, the scalp wound filling his eyes with blood, and one arm tucked to his chest in a way that looks dislocated or broken. But Sam’s alive, and not balls deep in a demon: both wins in Dean’s book.
But there's a little Greek place outside of town that looks nice. Like... not a diner. Dean tries to remember the last time he sat down and ate at an actual restaurant that didn't have linoleum and a takeout menu.
Cas runs his nose over the bulge in Dean’s boxers, rubbing sweetly. His hands are back on Dean's still-clothed thighs, spreading him gently, fitting his thumbs into sensitive spaces like he knows exactly where to press. He leans further in, and Dean has to hold his breath.
He has plans, sure, but he also wants to remember this day with as much clarity as possible. Their table is intimate and out of the way, the dim lighting setting a mood that Dean appreciates. He and Cas sit close together, leaning in, closer than Dean might normally feel comfortable with. But he can't help it. Their ankles have been twined together since about two seconds after they sat down.
Crowley gives each one of them a look that says how much he hates all of them, and given better circumstances, he'd be tryin to kill them. It's an expression Dean's much more comfortable with. They stay like that, frozen, until finally Crowley throws his hands up. "Alright, fine,” he growls. “But if I get killed, I'm coming after you lot personally."
Bobby slams something on the other end of the line, and then sighs. "Fine. But you call me the moment you know something, need something, or, hell,
Dean blinks. He's never heard Cas say much about his parents, not since the first car ride. Jimmy never said anything about them, either—not even when he realized that Cas was alive.
The final battle happens a week later. Castiel should have expected the trap, he supposes, but he didn't actually think Dean would actually be willing to fake a nightmare. He should have known something was different--Dean’s so quiet, tonight, though he’s tossing with more violence than Castiel’s used to.
Well, that just won’t do. Dean takes the bottle and lobs it gently in Cas's direction. "So were you being hopeful, or just trying to be prepared?" he teases, gently.
"Hey, treat every girl like a princess, right?" Dean jokes, and swallows down the weird bitter pill of the lies he just told. It's nice to be able to joke with Sammy, but lying about Cas is starting to hurt a little.
Dean's breath is hot in his ear and the occasional kisses he pushes into Castiel's neck only heighten the experience. "So good, it's so good Cas, I can't believe... fuck."
No, he didn't. He'd told them to forget his number. Considering that Dean just had told him that his twin brother was dead in a war between angels and demons, Dean can't even blame him for that.
They start up an intense sort of shifting of hips, low flat rolls that push their cocks against each other, bottom to top. Dean's not sure he's gonna make it to pants off, and he's starting to be really okay with that. Cas hooks his arms under Dean's shoulders and pulls him close, and that helps Dean grind down at the back end of each roll. It's bliss.
"Yes and no," Cas answers. "Those circumstances are not of Dean's making any more than my strangeness as a child were of yours."
Unlike most nights, Castiel finds his sleep easily. Unfortunately, it's fleeting each and every time. By the time he passes out from sheer exhaustion it's close to sunrise.
"Where no one can erase or remove them." Cas is still moving so carefully, so slowly; Dean sits very still as his hand comes close again.His finger skims, gently, around the rays of the sun, and draws a warm star over Dean's heart. He skirts up to Dean's right shoulder.
It wasn't like this before. It was never like this before--skin to skin, held together in someone's arms, close. It's a mess, wet and hot, and it's exquisite, Dean's expression slack with delight as he watches Castiel fly apart.
Cas huffs. "Jimmy, I am an angel. I could pick you up like a princess and carry you without breaking a sweat. I'm only helping you like this for your dignity." He pauses. "Also, I don't sweat anymore."
The content feeling in Dean’s stomach makes all of those worries seem far away and indistinct. He lets it, knowing that all-too-soon it’ll be time to worry about it all over again.
Cas tips his head to the side in that look that Dean sort of loves. "Really?" He shakes his head. "I suppose I’m just accustomed to it. I've never met our Father. None of us have, except for the archangels."
Castiel looks down and blood drips off the ends of his fingers. “It hurts,” he says, like he’s surprised by that.
There's a moment though, when Dean's hands stray from their current path of running up and down Castiel's spine--an amazing sensation really--and those clever fingers slowly start to edge their way under the elastic of Castiel’s pants. There’s the barest hint of a pause when Dean looks--no, feels--uncertain.
"Maybe," Cas says, leaning back into Dean's hand , just a bit. "If Lilith's death is the final key in the lock, then it has to be something specific. These things don't work by accident. They have to be deliberate. Rituals, almost."
The Christmas lights in the house are subdued, other than those on the tree, and most of the decorations involve evergreen boughs and golden baubles. A few big shiny ribbons are pinned up in places. Cas told him that they'd even cut back on some of the holiday junk after Dean's near-panic attack at the full Thanksgiving Special, as it had been called, that Jimmy and Amelia tended to put on. They'd been especially thankful this year too, because of Cas.
Cas stops, then, and lifts his head just enough to catch Dean's eyes. "I'm not incapable of—" he trails off and chuckles wetly. "It was always you, Dean, and you spent so long as a figment of my imagination, I couldn't help but feel…"
in the front seat and it's the most revealing thing he's ever seen. How fucking dare someone know him like that, see him like that, without his permission.
The noise that Cas makes in response to that is higher-pitched than Dean thought his voice could go. Okay, so maybe Cas isn't as unshaken about this archangel-on-doorstep thing as he's pretending to be.
Sam tries to talk to him as they're driving out, but Dean doesn't answer. He can't. He barely hears the questions.
This time, he wakes up to a blanket tucked around him and an empty back seat. His mouth is open and he can feel the scream vibrating on the back of his tongue, but he swallows it when he realizes he’s no longer trapped in his nightmare.
"You're not welcome here, brother," Cas says, really fucking calmly for the fact he seems to be addressing an
"But maybe you can teach me a thing or two about bein' human, too, huh?" Dean whispers, and leans in to replace his thumb with his lips.
Dean reaches for one of the pillows by Cas's head. He folds it in half, because it's kind of a shitty motel pillow, and shoves it under Cas's hips as he lifts to make room for it. That's almost a mistake because it just sort of rubs them together in a very pleasant and distracting way.
Cas smiles at him—soft and warm, but with an eagerness to it that does a lot for Dean's nerves. He really does want it. He's not just doing this for Dean, he's doing this for himself, and goddammit, that's amazing.
Inias's shoulders only twitch once before he strides forward, the edges of his stodgy suit flipping. Cas's mouth curves in a harsh, humorless smile, and he looks past Inias at Uriel. "Can't do it yourself?" he asks, softly, and there's something that sounds like a threat in his voice. He steps forward like Inias isn't even there.
They do a pit stop about 3 hours in. Mostly a pee and snack break, and a chance to get some gas. It seems calm at the moment, but Dean doesn't want to be caught 3/4s of a tank down in a tight spot. The twins are solidly asleep: they don't even twitch when the car doors close the second time. He and Sam grab some extra snacks. Worst case scenario, they can stop at the side of the road if someone really needs to pee. They’re all guys here.
Well, that's fair, Dean supposes. That being said, Dean has one car, he bets Cas probably has more than one language under his belt.
Sam rolls his eyes so hard his hair almost levitates. "Dean, we've been living together all our lives. I think I can recognize by now when you've got that... that..."
What's left behind is cold and hard and ancient. The smile he wears—it wears—is small and mean. He laughs, and it's like the sound of tires blowing out on the highway going eighty. And for the first time, Dean maybe, maybe, understands why this guy calls himself the King of the Crossroads.
Cas kisses him again and again. Still soft, still slow, but incrementally deeper. Dean knows Cas’'ll stop if Dean shows the slightest reluctance, and that somehow makes it better. Dean lets himself be kissed and touched and it's like tiny little bits of love showering all over him. It's enough to make it easy to forget how to breathe. Cas stokes that tiny flare of hunger carefully until Dean is achy all over with something he knows is arousal, but it’s never really felt this easy inside him before.
Dean shivers. There's something to Cas's words. Some deep truth that Dean can feel in his chest, all the way down to his marrow, despite the distinct lack of actual details.
"Yeah, I, uh... I didn't know if Bobby would be, um. Okay with it," Dean admits. He doesn't say that he didn’t really plan to tell him. Or that the moment Bobby started on with the detox talk, Dean might've already begun running through nearby motels in his head—just in case Bobby kicked him out.
Now that they've got the guy pinned, though, Dean's not sure what they're gonna do with him. Castiel doesn't seem like he's going to kill an unarmed angel, and Dean, for all that the guy called him a mongrel and a monkey, generally doesn't stab people for animal comparisons.
Cas reaches up and settles his hand on Dean's bicep—not quite touching the mark. Him avoiding it right now is, Dean's pretty sure, intentional, because weird things happen to both their brains whenever he has his hand on it. "That goes for you, too, Dean," he says, gently. "We are all doing the best we can, and you have value, too." His eyes narrow, just slightly. "That means that if you are contemplating something stupid and suicidal in the face of all this... well, don't."
When Dean pulls away, a lifetime later, they're laying across the width of Castiel's bed, chests pressing tightly together, legs tangled gently.
Dean swallows and resists sitting down next to Cas, and not just because can't stop thinking about the gross things that probably happened on that couch. "What do you mean, not replenishing like it should?"
All he can let himself do is be taken apart, fall into the careful, deliberate pattern of suction, in and out. When Cas's hand leaves his hip, it leaves warm achy prints behind it that make Dean realize just how hard he must have been pressing up against Cas's fingers. Cas is still bobbing, spectacularly coordinated, as his fingertips trace along the inside of Dean's thigh, dance at the sensitive crease of his groin.
"You don't normally ask if you can. I am waiting with bated breath," Cas murmurs. Dean would normally call him a sassy asshole—because he is—but Cas says those words low and thrumming into the side of Dean's neck, his lips moving over a patch of wet skin.
He trails off. Dean gets it. Sam’s warded, but not in the way Dean is: he hasn’t got Castiel’s name written across his tailbone like the damned Batsignal.
Dean's about to prickle at that, but Cas smiles, sweetly. "Exactly," he announces, and it sounds like the kind of thing brothers say to each other, not just a weird and tense stand-off.
"I'll be sure to write it in my diary." Bobby snipes, before finding his own seat near the table. He lets out a long breath and looks back and forth between them. "Now, either of you two wanna tell me what the hell is going on?"
This time, it's the buzz of connection that washes through Dean, clean and uncomplicated—right, as if any of this is anything but complicated, but it feels so simple when they're like this. Cas is soft and pliant next to him (okay, on top of him, and that feels very nice) and Dean's brain is maxed out on pleasure to the point of quiet.
Dean can't disagree with that, but he doesn't say it aloud. He didn't know Anna for shit, but Cas did, and they both know that in the condition she arrived in? She's probably dead, now.
is standing there, his face twisted with righteous fury as Dean’s least favorite angel crumples at his feet. He’s a vision, dark-haired, face intense, and if Uriel hadn't just bit it like the asshole that he is, Dean might think he's hallucinating.
Dean feels exhausted and hollowed-out. Hell is too close to the surface, and the knowledge that Sam is going to ask more pointed and specific questions about it at some point in the future weighs him down further. Cas, who drove there with Dean rather than pop over, comes up behind Dean as he's fiddling with the key in his hand. It doesn't want to straighten out and catch in the lock, and Dean's other hand is holding his bag.
Dean's heart thunders in his chest. Jesus, he passed. Like, really passed. "Yeah," he says with a calm he’s not actually feeling. "I think Cas suggested this class as sort of a crash course in essay writing without actually getting me to enroll in Writing 101…  I think that might've been so boring I'd genuinely consider blowing brains out. I'm pretty sure Cas has got a secret plan to get me my undergraduate degree one class at a time."
Cas nods, earnestly, leaning in to trace the line of Dean's chin with his nose. "I cherish our connection, I would never want it to flounder." He sounds as far from innocent as possible, and his nose finishes its arc, punctuated by a soft kiss. "It's very important to me."
And if it's tears crusted on his eyelashes and not just sleep when Dean wakes up the next morning, no-one will ever know.
There was apparently a hissy fit about it in Heaven. Someone stamped their feet and Chicago got a windstorm."
Anna doesn't flinch. She doesn't move. The edge of the knife nicks her neck, and a drop of blood rolls down it, glittering until it vanishes into the collar of her white, white blouse.
Nervousness—yeah, maybe a little. That deep, shivery, connection between them is tight and tense and shining, though—God, he can feel that everywhere they touch, and he wants to be closer so bad that his joints ache with it.
Dean shivers all over, and he couldn't put a finger on what he's feeling if he had a million years to do it. Lust—hell, he's barely dared think about this, since he thought Cas wasn't into it, and the rush of excited
But there’s nothing about Dean’s expression that suggests he’s asleep. Not his open eyes, not his scowl, not the curl of his lip, and certainly not the way his brows are bunched together. Castiel might be tired, but he’s not stupid.
Sam sighs, and clearly can't figure out what he wants to object to. So he turns to Bobby. "How are we doing on the ritual? And finding Lilith?"
Cas's hands are large and rough with calluses at the tips, at spots on the palm—they're not soft teacher hands, if they ever were, but why did Dean never notice that before? He feels like he should have noticed that. He feels like he should have noticed all of it: the way Cas's dimples are just a little off-center as he smiles down at Dean, the way he settles his weight on Dean's lap.
It's not okay. It's the last fucking thing from okay. Dean hunches in, because it's either that or dry heave, and finds himself being tucked into strong arms, his head pulled into the crook of Cas's shoulder. Cas smells so human: a little sweaty, a little sleepy.
He puts Dean down and strides off down the hallway before Dean can think of an appropriate response to that. Okay, they're definitely gonna have to fucking talk about what just happened.
Then Sam carefully takes something off one of the branches. It’s a little black car, made out of a matchbox painted with streaky black acrylic paint, with delicate glued-on cellophane windows and big white buttons for wheels. Like… actual moving wheels: the buttons are attached to a bamboo barbecue skewer stuck through the matchbox. It’s got a long golden ribbon to hang it from, and Claire painstakingly wrote “Baby” on the side in red glitter pen. It was her ‘thank you’ for him helping her make the other Christmas ornaments for her art class.
Cas murmurs, against his neck, "It was never like this, before, not until you," and he sounds just as astonished as Dean feels. "I want you so much. I missed you."
Dean kisses Cas's hairline, since that's the closest bit to his lips. Cas hums in approval but also grumbles about his choices.
Dean can't see what he's doing, just exploring by touch. It's a little of a weird angle for his hand. But the warm tuck of Cas's ass cheeks around his fingers as Cas flexes and moves on top of him, their cocks bumping every so often, makes beads of sweat break out around Dean's hairline, and Dean doesn't even have a finger in him yet.
More than anything, that convinces Dean that Castiel is the real deal. What kind of real deal, though, he has no idea.
Dean really doesn't want to know. "Well," he shrugs. "We, uh…” he trails off. Telling a non-hunter that they burned both his and his mom’s bodies, so there’s not likely to be a death report or investigation about that, just doesn’t sound like a good idea, even if the kid does have an archangel inside him. “We couldn’t stick around to find out, but there’s a good chance there might only be a missing persons case out on you. Explaining your disappearance and your mom's non-reappearance might be hard, but it's easier than if there was any real proof you'd died."
Before either of them have to make a decision, though, Bobby's grumble echoes through the room. "Now I ain't got nothin' against you bein' happy, but you only get
Sam sits back with a groan, and rubs the ball of his thumb across his eyes. "I'm beat. I can't read any more about flannel and shotgun shells and portents."
have those things now. And, hell, would he have even wanted any of that anyway? Dean doesn’t regret the way he lived his life—the family business. He doesn’t regret the people he saved. He doesn’t regret those hours on highways getting to know Baby’s purr, and the sound of Sam and Bobby laughing over weird freaky lore.
A lamp sparks and pops loudly beside them. Dean's not sure what that's about, but he's too gone to want to stop.
"Fine. Whatever." He grips the Impala’s wheel harder and watches his knuckles whiten. Today, Dean's not up for anything more energetic than ‘terse.’
He looks a little overwhelmed, though, and Dean can't blame him. He just got himself two half-brothers, a brother-in-law, and Jimmy, Claire, and Amelia in the bargain. Plus the archangel riding his ass. It's a lot. Hell, it's a lot for
Cas shakes his head. "When a righteous man sheds blood in Hell," he says, softly. "As he breaks, so shall it break."
the humans in his charge, not take them down in the process!" His lip curls, and he straightens, lifting his chin. “‘For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways,’” he spits.
Dean doesn't even look up at first: he's too intent on carefully tasting the eggs set out for him, chewing thoughtfully before swallowing. (Cas also dropped hot sauce by his plate, because he’s effing
Cas runs one dry finger along the edge of the print, and the feeling of connection hums between them. "This was an accident, I think? I was saying goodbye and you reached for me one last time, only you were already inside your own body."
Score. Dean laughs a breathless, giddy laugh. Cas presses sloppy and uncoordinated kisses into his neck and shoulder. Dean's breathing heavily and his legs are sliding down, no longer having the energy or tension to stay bent and upright. The gentle thud of the backs of his knees hitting the bed jostles both of them just enough to wring out one more shiver of pleasure.
Dean's whole body jerks with the desire to get away, to not let anyone see, because—because—because why? He's not embarrassed, he's not ashamed. It's just...
But Dean doesn’t say anything. Just ‘cause he already knows how Cas might like it, doesn't mean he doesn't enjoy this—his hand around Cas’s cock, Cas's hand around his.
Dean agrees, but he also doesn't want to let go of Cas either. "Stay." He mumbles the words into Cas's skin, feeling his own face heat at it. "Let’s go to bed."
Dean’s only teasing, so his eyes go a little wider when Cas turns a little pink over his cheekbones. Holy shit, he can blush. "I—it's not precisely that, it's—" Cas stammers. "They don't translate well, some types of protection sigils, but they are most powerful when tied to a Name, and I thought—"
Cas licks his lips and looks at his hand, thoughtfully, and looks over at Sam. "I can... I think I can still... "
Dean's having lunch with a being who talks about the day he kills God—because it's all part of the rules, apparently? Fuck, fuck—and complains about the Devil having a temper tantrum. He swallows, dry. Swallows again. "We're trying to stop it. Lucifer. The whole dance with the devil fandango. You're saying we can't?"
Sam laughs in his face and Dean can feel his blood pressure really start to rise. "Look,” Sam says so kindly that the hair rises on the back of Dean’s neck. “Her venom must be working really hard in you. Just. Don't do anything. Let me take care of it." Sam turns on his heel, and starts to leave the room.
Cas sits down next to Dean like it’s been minutes, not weeks, and kicks the side of Dean’s shoe gently with the toe of one leather boot. "I do not miss laundry."
That night, when he unwraps Cas's arm before they get into bed, the slash bisecting it is gone like it never was.
"I think we use that term very differently," Dean murmurs, but he's already starting to get lost in the way it feels having
Bobby shakes his head, but he doesn't look away from Dean's eyes. The shadows of his eyebags are probably as deep and dark as Dean’s own. "I figured you'd want to..." he clears his throat. "Take care of him yourself. He's laid out, now. I got the shrouds by him."
When Dean fumbles forward and gently takes him into hand, trying to keep his cock balanced between Cas’s thighs, though, Cas's shoulders both jerk backwards against him. "Dean!" he gasps. "You don't have to—"
When he's done, Dean ends the call and violently misses phones he could slam down. Cas plucks the thing from his fingers (probably a good idea) and then rubs across Dean’s aching knuckles. The pre-bruise ache disappears.
Dean's shoulders push off the wall. He doesn't want to, but he takes one step closer. Another. Because he needs to. Because the emptiness in his chest hurts, but it doesn't hurt as much as it did a day ago. An hour ago. Ten minutes ago, before he reached out and took Cas's hand.
Cas still looks woozy and wobbly, and he’s still leaning heavily against the nearest wall like it’s all that’s holding him up.
"Whose side do you believe I would be on after that?" Cas seems to have found some focus again. He pushes off the countertop and brushes past Dean again; his fingertips barely touch Dean's hip, but he feels them, hot, like the most pleasant brand he could imagine. "The forces of Heaven are not particularly clever—nor do they give humans this much credit. I've hidden both Sam and Dean from them in ways that will require greater creativity than most in the host will ever display to get around. I'm on the side of humanity. I’m on the side of the
Cas gently brushes her wrist, and rises to his feet. "If you understand that there's something there to love," he says, gently, "then you're halfway there."
But Cas smiles at him from still-too-close like he can see what Dean's thinking. He tilts back on his heels so their chests aren't resting together anymore (Dean doesn't know when that happened) and his hand lowers gently off Dean's cheek. When he turns away, it's to lean his back against the rusted heap behind Dean's back, side by side again. His next exhale is visible in the air.
His pulse starts thrumming as he watches Cas take off his coat, and then his suit jacket. He starts rolling his sleeves up his forearms—the forearms that Dean can't seem to look away from. He wants to touch the skin there, run his fingers down the line of bone, draw shapes into it.
Cas moves to help, but Dean cuts him off with a noise in the back of his throat. They’re all three gonna end up in a pile on the floor if Cas goes down while ‘helping.’ Dean gets Cas to the nearby sofa, installs him in a corner and tells him to stay there. He goes back and eases Jimmy up, supporting his injured side gingerly. He brings him to the sofa, too, and then helps him lay down so that his head winds up in Cas's lap. The way Jimmy's eyes won't leave Cas's face tells Dean that was the right decision.
Cas's calluses run just inside his hipbone, rasping gently into the crease between hip and thigh through Dean’s boxers. He's not even touching Dean's dick skin to skin, and it's fucking fantastic.
Dean frowns. "You're... cut off from Heaven?" Okay, he didn't hear anything about this. Shit, he knew that Cas was hiding something, but he didn't know what. "Wait, what does that mean?"
Across the room Cas's head pops up in surprise: he stares at the phone in Dean’s hand in shock. Dean winks at him, and after he hangs up, he feels his lips lift in a smile, just for Cas. "Well, there's no turning back now,” he announces. “You're officially a Winchester."
Cas smiles and curls his hand over where Dean's fingers are pressing against his skin. "I think your name would look pretty in pig-Latin." He picks Dean's hand up carefully and laces their fingers together. "You're already written all over me, though. Right down to my component atoms. I’m sure everyone can see it."
Jimmy doesn't look amused. Or comforted. Actually, he does look a little bit more like Cas when he's all... pinched up like that. "Well, when last you left here, you weren't wearing a
The funny thing is, they've spent so long just not talking about shit that there's something almost comfortable with the painful silence going through the car. Dean turns on the radio and hums along to the Eagles, drumming his thumbs on Baby's familiar, heavy wheel. Sam sulks like a boss. Should've gone to college for
"I don't know," Dean grits out. Cas's eyes flick to his, and Dean doesn't let him look away, this time. "But we're gonna think of something."
Eventually Bobby stands and stretches. "Alright, all of you who have an appointment with Death tomorrow, go get some sleep. I suspect you're gonna need it. I'll stay up a while longer and see if I can find anything useful in this pile of paper." Bobby starts stacking their dishes and empties before Dean can reach for them. He nods towards the stairs. "Go on up, second bedroom’s been cleaned enough to sleep in."
Cas shakes his head, and smiles, small, sad. "I think that's what you, and Heaven, never understood, my friend. There never was."
” Dean lets out a stifled little grunt of laughter at that. “My Ph.D was out of genuine interest in the subject, but not for the reasons my parents probably assumed.”
Dean's lips thin, and he feels his shoulders bow. "We might." He sits down in front of his little brother, and slowly tells the story of their lunch date with Death.
Cas joins him and Dean briefly feels content beyond the telling of it. The thought of Sam breaks through those warm, soft feelings quickly, but not as quickly as it might've a year ago, and that's something Dean is still trying to deal with.
, which should be impossible. But watching him lean back to really start riding Dean's cock—one hand resting firmly back on Dean's bent knee now that Dean's got a hold of his hips, his bottom lip held tight under the pale flash of his teeth, whole body arched backwards to give Dean a hell of a view—Dean is pretty sure no one would have any idea that Cas hasn't done this position before.
A second ago, when the angels first landed on this outfield, Sam called Castiel an 'innocent bystander.' But looking at him now? Dean's not so sure.
Sam appears to accept the information for what it is. He goes back to slowly and methodically eating his breakfast for a few more minutes before frowning again. "Is Anna not in the house?"
Dean wants to keep staring at Cas’s cock moving in and out of his hand, but some part of his brain must be thinking beyond 'fuck, God, more, more,' and he ducks his head into the curve of Cas's shoulder instead.
There's a thin layer of dust in parts of the room. Like someone's been in here, but only as far as they needed to be before leaving again. It’s been months since Cas left, but Dean knows what it looks like when someone’s grief keeps them from putting away a loved one’s things.
Dean has trouble not jumping him right then and there. "Okay, settle.” He flaps a hand in Cas’s direction. “He's an angel, they're all a little off."
Cas moans, softly, and that's when Dean knows he's figured out the timing. At the next firm thrust, Cas quakes in his arms, neck arching back to rest his head on Dean’s shoulder. "Yes, please," he whispers.
But Dean's memory for places is pretty good. He's pretty sure he's got the layout down and could take it running by their third walk-around. And considering that the white marble altar still has blood in its cracked surface, he's pretty sure he knows where this shit is gonna go down.
On the one hand, Dean wants to shake awake Cas and Jimmy, shake them until answers come falling out. On the other, Dean’s little brother is looking at Cas like he's starting to believe, and Dean can't figure out which is more dangerous.
Dean pushes Cas’s shoulders back against the headboard with a gentle nudge, and brings his hand up to cradle around the base of Cas’s cock, so he can stroke the parts he isn't practiced enough to reach. Maybe someday he’ll try it. For now, he hauls himself up so he’s partly sprawled over Cas’s hip and thigh, his other arm bracing him up. He doesn't want complicated right now, anyway; Cas seems too worked-up for complicated.
"Wow. I'm likin' the mojo," Dean grins against Cas's shoulder, then looks down to admire the print of his teeth in it. He bit pretty hard. The crescent of marks is still there, though he can already see the edges starting to fade.
Cas rolls his eyes, and it's such a familiar brotherly gesture that he's suddenly back down to earth in a way that feels accessible to Dean.
Cas shrugs, delicately. "There are… only certain individuals who are capable of…” he seems to be picking his words very carefully, “...internalizing demon blood in that way. So withdrawal has been known to happen, but Heaven's justice tends to be absolute. There's no margin for, well, anything. Anyone so deeply allied with demons would be considered sullied, and to Heaven, the answer would simply be death.” He pokes his fork into his pancake a few times, studying the pattern the tines make in it. “Our versions of rehabilitation are built around cutting out the malignancy, not rehabilitating it. My best guess is that once the worst symptoms subside, the bigger issue will be relapse."
Dean snorts. Right. There's a little too much biblical metaphor going on in his life. He takes the pages and scans the opening. It's pretty close to how he remembers it: the day is a little fuzzy and disorienting and streaked with white and red and panic in his own memories, because digging his way out of his own grave just fucks with a guy. But it looks mostly right. He skips ahead again, because Dean also has that sinking feeling that he knows what's different, and he doesn't want to explain to Sam
Dean almost misses the slight smirk. Oh, Cas means it in every way possible. He definitely wants to care for Dean but… "Yeah, how come your version of ‘caretaking’ involves more orgasms than mine?"
The air changes and Dean's head snaps up. There's the sound of wingbeats a half second later. He doesn’t have to look to know who’s behind him.
Dean wants more. He's not sure what more is, but God he wants it. Then Cas does... something. His finger bends, and wow, can Dean feel every single movement. The finger crooks just
Cas pushes himself a bit more upright, and then grimaces and looks down at his hands. Yeah, Dean's gonna need a hot shower after this room, with lots of soap.
Dean arches into all of it: simple, uncomplicated pleasure’s an old friend made new again, because it's Cas. Cas is pretty quickly becoming the person Dean has had sex with the most—Hell, probably already would be if not for the, y’know, apocalypse determined to keep ‘em busy and apart. Dean's forgotten that he can keep learning about someone long after he’s  spent those first hours exploring their entire body.
The sad little hint of accusation, weirdly, is what brings Dean's head off his knee and pushes him through to his feet. Because he's always been a contrary sonofabitch in a lot of ways.
And Dean can't even pretend that it's not his fault Cas is here, like this, cold on a table in a shitty salvage shed.
"Hey, hey. I kinda like you a little volatile." Dean also kind of likes teasing Cas, he's finding. He throws him a wink. "Anyone ever tell you you're a badass, by the way?"
Dean ducks his head into Cas's neck, hiding maybe just a little, even while his cock is so damn interested in the proceedings his boxers are having trouble keeping him in check. He swallows, and then clears his throat. "Fingers?" he finally mumbles into Cas's skin. "I think? Is that what's, uh, first? I want to try what's first."
He needs something, though, just a little something more, it's fucking fantastic, but he's almost untethered—and then Cas carefully brings Dean's hand to his hair. That's—yeah. That's perfect too. Dean doesn't push, doesn't suggest; he just rests it there, feeling the soft tufts of hair under his fingertips as Cas’s head moves, up and down. It's grounding in just the right ways.
Dean doesn’t smile back. Shit. That’s sort of heartbreaking. Dean’s not even sure why; maybe it’s because he can feel a little of Cas’s sorrow—the awareness that flying is the one thing about being an angel that Cas actually loves.
Okay, that's really weirdly specific. Dean exchanges a wide-eyed look with Sam. Cas makes a small, gasping noise that might be a laugh, or a sound of horror.
Charlie has a way about her: she fixes problems before most people even realize they're there. Castiel has seen her do it for Sam and Dean on multiple occasions. When it finally happens for him, though, the warmth of friendship that comes with it is nearly overpowering.
But Castiel isn't paying attention to Sam. "Everyone said you were a dream. All my life. You always said that, right, Jimmy? But I knew," he says, and there's an expression on his face that Dean thinks he should recognize—a little tip to his head, a little curve of his lips. It’s… sweet. "When the voices said 'Dean Winchester is saved...' I didn’t know. But I’m so glad."
Cas comes back down with the duffle looking fully packed and a slim wooden box in his hands. Right, the scythe. Yeah, they should probably take that with them. Damn, that thing is an awkward shape, or Dean would carry it on him.
Higher Voice—Jimmy—sighs. "September 18th." He's looking at Dean, too, but it doesn't feel the same. He doesn't
Something in Dean relaxes a little. He thinks he might actually want to, at some point, but he can only take so many heart-stopping events in a year. Them stopping the Apocalypse, Cas coming back to life
He snatches the phone, dials, and leaves a blistering voice mail that if Ruby overhears won't tell her more than how fucking pissed and scared Dean is for his baby brother. He's not a fan of this plan, and he will try to pull the plug on this plan as soon as possible, but no way is he putting Sam into more danger because the little shit ran off and just had to do this all by himself.
Cas joins him for a few chuckles and that more than anything seems to throw Sam off. He spends the rest of the evening looking slightly confused, even as he and Dean start putting up the warding. By the time Cas finally stands to leave, Sam’s still got a little furrow between his eyebrows.
“What did you do?” Dean demands. “Did you… did you kill them?!” That can’t be good, can it? Not that Dean hasn’t thought about how much he wants to put his fist through Uriel’s face sometimes, but he also doesn’t want fucking angelic retribution on all their heads, either.
The twins sit quietly in the back as they cruise down the highway towards Bobby's, but whenever Dean looks up to check his rearview, there's
He feels Cas smile against his shoulder, the dry curve of it nuzzling along the raised edges of the handprint. One of those long hands curls around his hip, riding up against him in a slow, dirty roll. The other slides through Dean’s fingers, set next to Cas's hip to keep Dean from crushing him—he wanted to keep touching Cas, finding out just what's good for him.
Cas's mouth falls open a little and stays that way. He's wide-eyed in a way that Dean's never seen him.
"Why'd you do it?" Dean asks. His voice cracks. Water rolls down Cas’s cheekbone and pools on his ear, tracking through the dust and dried blood on his face as Dean’s fingers clench too tightly on the rag in his hand. Cas was supposed to follow them out, goddammit. He was just supposed to buy them a little time. He wasn’t supposed to try to duke it out with a goddamned immortal demon they all knew he couldn’t beat. "Why'd you..."
"Yes!" Cas gasps. "Yes, I think I—" Another dull thud as they come together. "I'm going to—" His words are swallowed up in a gasp of pleasure, then a low, rolling litany that’s definitely
They still haven't looked at each other by the time Dean sits on the edge of the bed next to Castiel.
"Your. Angel." Bobby's face is doing something Dean can't quite define. “Like… a guardian angel type deal? Those things are real?”
Then his eyes drift over to Dean again. "But... I think I'll need more of my memories, first," he finishes.
"Because you were set up to fail," Cas says, soberly. "Six more years. For six more years, I failed to see what was so obvious a human child could have seen it. And because of it, you were at their mercy. I think I was only able to save you because they allowed it, not because… not through any wisdom of my own."
"I wasn't sure you really existed," Cas says, taking another piece of chicken skin. Death pushes a plate of wings towards him, and he makes another happy little noise and scoops up a fried wing tip. "It's... a comfort and not, I suppose."
They're still bickering over pancakes versus waffles when they sit down at the table (venison stew, and no one asks where the deer came from).
Dean takes up the knife and cuts his palm, deep. The sting of it is familiar and ancient, the blood welling up hot. "Ready," he says.
"Oh, baby," Dean gasps, "Fuck! Please, like that." Cas’s rhythm is torturous and sweet and fucking amazing. But as much as Dean wants to move into it, the firm hold on his hips and the lack of leverage he’s got with his leg over Cas’s shoulder prevent all but the smallest of wiggles—and Dean suspects those are only with Cas's approval.
"No. That was me," Castiel answers, from the other side, and how the hell can't Sam tell them apart? "It's... it all makes sense, now.” He seems to squint and reconsider.  “Some things."
Before they head out, Cas finishes warding all three Novaks, and Sam walks them through what all the new symbols and drawings on their walls and floors mean. Sam managed to hide it all under carpets and behind curtains and under furniture. He must have been up well before Dean and Cas made their appearance. When that’s all done, Cas hugs Amelia and kisses Claire on both cheeks—which makes her squeak and paw at his face, but Cas's grin is wide and sweet at her, and they're both smiling. Amelia says something into his ear that makes Cas squint, and almost-kind-of-blush.
Cas doesn't answer in words. Instead, his tongue traces the very edge of a thumb; why Dean knows it's a thumb, he couldn't say, but he does. He feels his whole body move into it, pressing his cock against Cas's thigh, his groin, the scrape of his zipper.
Dean grunts, still not fully awake. Sam is unaccountably perky in the mornings and Dean often wonders where he went wrong.
" and his hips jerk upwards when Cas bites down, hard, right where Dean's neck meets his shoulder. It's not even on his sensitive side, but just that touch of sharpness makes Dean's toes curl against the floor. Cas smiles (Dean can feel the curve of his lips against his skin) and mumbles, "Hmmm. Interesting."
"No!" Dean spits, shaking his head. "No—God, Sam did you not just live through the exact same last few days we did? Did you not see what poison that bitch put in you?"
Dean runs a nervous hand through his hair and makes a decision because fuck it, his legs are still jelly, he feels fucking fantastic and Cas is the best thing since sliced bread. They wiggle their shirts back on, Cas slipping him a soft kiss as his head comes through the neck hole.
He glances up at Cas’s dark profile and bowed head, the way he runs his thumb over the angle of his jaw as he reads, and smirks. Nope. Definitely can't imagine him as a redhead.
He strides into the kitchen just in time to see Cas flip a pancake with one careful little tip of his wrist, Bobby watching him curiously from the bench table they use as a dining table.
When Sam finally turns his back to the Impala, it's like the emergency brake got taken off Dean’s body. He can move again. They throw themselves out of the car,  but by the time they get to Sam, he’s already yanking the black thing out of Amelia's body. There are other meat suits lying in piles on the floor, more abused than Amelia—probably been dead for days, maybe longer.
On the next push, Cas's hips nudge back, and that changes the angle a little—the head of Dean's cock slips over his target and slides forward, bumping soft and firm against the thin, delicate skin covering the back of Cas's balls. They both jump a little. Cas makes a small startled sound.
Under the washed-thin cover of the flannel, he wiggles his hand underneath the cup of Cas's palm. Dean's fingers slip into the clench of Cas's callused grip. He strokes the tense, tight ball of Cas's thumb, and feels him relax, feels his whole wrist drop. When his hand uncurls, Dean's fingers interlock through his.
When they break apart this time, Dean puts the cardboard container down in the brown paper bag—yep, they really ate four whole slices of pie, and nope, Dean has no regrets. He slowly eases back on Baby's hood until he's stretched out over the sun-warm surface, and sighs happily.
Dean doesn't bother to tell him that Cas, wards or not, can probably hear him. He shrugs, but feels a smile curve around his lips. "He's weird, but what's not to like?"
Dean's right up in Cas's space as soon as Bobby's gone, kissing the back of his neck. "This makes up for the terror I experienced waking up alone." He brushes another kiss along the same spot. "Barely."
Cas blinks at him, and tilts his head. "Thank... you?" he says, and looks down at the t-shirt of Dean's he's wearing. "I suppose I should have brought some of my shirts from Jimmy's, rather than always borrowing yours," he adds, a little ruefully. "I didn't think. My other clothes never need to get washed."
When Dean gets the door open and slings his bag down on the nearest table, he's not really paying attention to much of anything other than putting one foot in front of the other. But when he looks up, he sees Cas stall at the door: his back stiffens into that angel posture that he sometimes gets when he's not sure how to react.
Michael looks at the cookie, nods at Castiel, closes his eyes briefly, and then nibbles carefully at the edge. Dean's actually fascinated to watch a being experience chocolate for the first time. Next to him, Cas feels like a little bundle of hysterics whenever they touch, because the Archangel Michael just started smiling in unabashed delight. He exclaims, “Hm!” and takes another bite.
Cas makes a soft noise against his lips that might be protest, but might be encouragement, Dean's not sure. But damn, that feels, it... the slip of it isn't the same as when Cas was touching him through his boxers. That was nice, but it was just a back and forth little glide, blunted by the cloth. This is... slippery, tingly, not pressure. He thought Cas was just gonna go for it, because, well, isn't that what he's supposed to do?
Jimmy raises an eyebrow and somehow still looks nothing like Cas. "So you told the truth so you wouldn't be caught in a lie?" he drawls.
By the next time Sam brings up a job from Ruby, Dean is still working up a pissy head of steam about the unfairness of it all, and the bullshit that is his life. There’s a hole in his chest that opens up, sometimes, if he thinks about for too long.
Dean sees the shadow out of the corner of his eye moving, rising, the messy mop of hair clearly making it Sam. He rolls out of the way just in time to avoid an axe to the melon.
Sam's face goes whiter. "Me making the beast with two backs with Lilith is interesting to you?" He's on the edge of an angry hysteria that Dean's not sure he'll be able to defuse before Sam storms out.
He should be nodding, not able to look away from the curve of Cas's mouth when Dean's angel deliberately licks his lips. Yup, that's exactly what he should be doing.
Everything is great, a little soft around the edges even though Dean's only had one beer. When he stops to think about it in the occasional lulls in conversation, it's a little disconcerting for him to be this happy all on his own, but he's gonna grab onto that and hold on with both hands till that train jumps the tracks. Because, goddamnit, this might be the best moment in his entire life.
Cas straightens beside him, and the joy that was written all over his face gets taped up and packed away as carefully as gift wrapping. "I might expect to hear that sentiment from one of my students here in the Midwest, but I'd have thought someone who spent time at Stanford would understand that sexuality is a range, rather than a binary. And might know something about people coming out in their own time," Cas says, coolly, his shoulders back like Sam doesn't tower over him.
Sam, of course, latches onto the point that seems to matter not at all to Dean right now. "The plagues in Egypt? You mean—there really were angels there—" then he shakes his head. "Never mind that. But... if you were an angel..." then he blinks twice, three times. "Wait, you went to
Dean's brain short-circuits a little. He remembers Cas spent an entire lifetime as a gay man who spent a lot of time interested in a guy he wasn't sure even existed. Of course he has… things. But it’s not often that the reality of their different sex lives really hits Dean between the eyes.
Okay that's a little weird, Dean wonders how much Cas the Angel can recall of his post-angel, pre-human life.
Dean blinks. And then blinks some more before what that means filters through his addled brain. "Jesus Christ,” he breathes. “You mean angels are in on it, too?"
"I invite you inside my home in peace," Castiel intones. It’s got a ceremonial quality to Dean's ears.
It feels sort of indecently good, but also a little frightening. Dean has had no problems at all with their sex life, other than that they don’t get it that often But he sort of wonders about other things, now.
Oh Jesus fucking Christ, their weird new buddy isn’t just nuts, he’s a nerd. Sam's got company for real now. And Dean should find nothing about that statement Cas made at all interesting. But there's just something about the way his face lights up when he talks, the way his eyes are creasing at the corners a little—
Dean knows better than to blush when Bobby's looking at him, but he also can't do anything about the way the back of his neck burns at that. "Huh. I dunno, Cas,” he admits. “Nothing's different. I'm fine. Sam’s…” Sam’s not fine. “Sam’s safe. We're at Bobby's, everything should be secure..."
Sam does actually laugh at that. As much as he'd been in awe when the concept of angels had first been introduced, Sam had soured just about as fast as Dean had.
Dean's pushing against the window, using it for leverage to grind and roll and thrust against Cas. With the other he threads his fingers into Cas's hair and holds him steady against his shoulder. Fuck it, that's the best shit he's ever had—and they're gonna do it like this—and he's gonna explode at any moment now... and he just
He tries to push upwards a little, get his torso propped up so he can watch Cas moving—but Cas has got him down but good, the strength in his hands unreal and perfectly controlled.
"Anna is gone," Cas says. His voice is a sandpaper rasp of grief. "Taken while we were busy with Crowley."
: Dean experiences some pretty hardcore grief in this chapter. He considers, briefly, some harmful ideas.
Dean pulls his zipper back up about halfway, not even bothering with the button. Sleeping is much more comfortable without the button. When he looks back, Cas seems to have made a similar decision.
Castiel glares. He’s not intimidated by Dean Winchester, and he certainly doesn’t follow his orders when he thinks they’re ridiculous. "Then stop giving it back!"
Cas licks a sticky smear of caramel—and holy shit, Dean does not know how he made it, but it’s fucking delicious: Dean can feel it sticking to his tongue, his teeth, and probably his gut—off the back of his fork. Quietly, he says, "Sam's strong. And I honestly believe he did it because he thought it was the best way to prevent the apocalypse. Without that pressure, I don't think the temptation will be there."
Cas makes a small noise against his lips that isn't a moan as much as a sigh, like he feels that they've slotted back into place, too. He turns into the kiss, nuzzling softly.
It's hard to believe this is over; it feels like just yesterday that we started writing this entire rebellion against the way canon hurt us. We promised you guys schmoop, a bit of smut, and a lot of the boyos in love and being gross together while the found family averts the Apocalypse, and here's hoping that you found this as satisfying to read as we did to write!
"If you say He works in mysterious ways, Cas, so help me..." Dean mutters, but he can't finish off that threat. He's a little too happy.
Dean shrugs. "It was more cryptic than that, but he gave us a nice big ‘I’d find it helpful if you grabbed it,’ yes." Kinda.
Dean needs to see that look a few dozen more times. He draws out and presses in again and Cas arches against him perfectly.
Dean opens eyes he didn't realize he'd closed, and catches sight of his duffel bag, set on a dusty book box made out of a stolen USPS plastic basket. He chuffs out a laugh. "I think our families both had the same idea," he murmurs, leaning back against Cas.
"What's your favorite book?" Dean shifts them gently back to what they were talking about. Okay, maybe not that gently.
Castiel's not sure if Dean has started smiling by the time Castiel tiptoes carefully out of the room, but Castiel has. Just a little.
It's a little kid's promise, one that Dean knows none of them might be able to keep. It's coming from a million-year-old angel.
"You could've knocked," Dean says. He reaches into Cas's pocket and rummages for his fingers. It gets him a little smile.
Cas's jaw moves, tightens. "It took me longer than I liked to realize that there was a problem. Because I am as arrogant as any angel, and I did not want to believe that the problem was not with Hell, with demons. The problem was not with Dean. The problem was coming from
I got some intel, too... 'cause I'm just that good." He pastes the smirk on and is surprised to find that some of it is actually real.
A few nights of near miraculous sleep later, he keeps it wrapped around him as he shuffles towards the kitchen for a drink one evening before bed. Getting to sleep is still an issue, but he, thankfully, now stays asleep most of the time.
In the library, he makes sure to stand all the way across the table from Cas. Just to see if it makes a difference. It doesn't.
Dean claps his hands together in excitement. Okay, something to do that’s not running for their lives or moving to Timbuktu. He can get with that. "All right. I like this plan. So, where's this grace of yours?"
Castiel’s chin tips back, and he stares into Dean’s eyes, his head tilted. It takes a long time for him to answer. Dean’s not sure why he doesn’t try to look away.
"It doesn't matter, Castiel." She grapples at the sleeve of his trench coat—Dean blinks; just a few seconds before, Cas was still wearing a band shirt and a pair of Dean's sweatpants—and Dean realizes, with another twist of his gut, that some of her fingernails are missing. "It doesn't matter. It's Lilith. It's Lilith."
them something, a location—rushes through Dean like the feel of a shower after a long, dirty hunt. He can't believe that Sam would mislead them, not about something like this. Not intentionally: he’ll never believe Sam’s so far gone.
Cas, more than anyone Dean had ever met, believed in choices and the freedoms that came with them. It wasn’t like he’d never said it. He’d choose Dean every time, and by extension, Sam. He’d buy them as much time as he could get them.
“Only Jimmy knew about my dreams, though. I knew well enough to keep those to myself. I never stopped having them: sometimes beautiful, sometimes terrifying.” He glances at Dean, and the tip of his tongue flickers to brush against his upper lip as he licks it. “Sometimes quite magnificent.”
Sam isn't wrong about what he’s saying—Dean isn't on board with what Sam's been doing with Ruby, because using a demon to hunt down a bigger, badder demon seems like a recipe for being stabbed between the shoulder blades. And that has nothing to do with the fact that since he first went to Hell, Dean's entire damned world has changed and changed and changed again.
Yes, Dean wants that, and just the thought of it makes his cock catch on the wet on the inside of his boxers.
"You're okay?" Cas asks. His eyes are searching Dean's face, his hand cupping the back of Dean’s neck.
Castiel takes a moment to right himself on the bed: feet hanging off the edge is spontaneous, but not conducive to the kinds of freedom of movement he thinks he wants. Dean's smile goes wolfish again and he crawls onto the bed, following Castiel's path until he's hovering over Castiel's quivering body on all fours. He’s looking his fill, too.
He barely feels the warm sear of the words that go down his spine, with Cas's lips moving against his. But the one that goes just over his tailbone makes him jump, 'cause okay, that is weirdly sensitive. Dean finds himself smiling into the kiss until Cas pulls back and looks at him quizzically.
"So the feathery fuckers know we know something," Bobby growls, loud enough that Dean hears Sam turn over on the sofa in the other room. "'Leastwise we never told her 'bout the scythe."
Yeah, Dean's finally cottoned onto that. It took some time, but he's finally given in and looked right at that truth.
Dean blinks. "Are you saying that you, uh..." his mind sparks, grinds, and then gives up. "My... soul?"
“It kind of sucks.” Now Dean's laugh is genuine. "You should have heard the interrogation I got over scrambled eggs and toast."
The first husband says that he loved his wife, and that he knew exactly what he was doing. That he's guilty. That means he probably is.
'Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; without having any chief, officer, or ruler, she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.'
But he feels Cas smile against it like there's no cloth between them. Dean gets approximately three breaths to catch up on, complete with slow sliding thrusts into Cas’s hand when Cas laps at him again, and it's almost torture because it's so fucking good. Dean's fingers tighten on Cas's hair because fuck, Cas needs to do that again, right now.
"Cas," Dean murmurs, drugged-out, possibly stoned, chin turning to seek him out. Up until this point, Dean has been holding onto Cas however he can—hand on bicep, fingers digging into shoulder. Cas’s shirt is still on and Dean needs to fix that soon. Dean runs shaking fingers down Cas's chin, gently pressing upwards at the delicate point.
"Let's worry about our safety first," Castiel says, finally. He says ‘our,’ but his eyes slide in a quick up and sideways glance, towards his brother.
It's a loose-limbed and well-rested Dean Winchester that Cas pops just outside the motel room that he and Sam originally were sharing. Dean’s bag thumps onto the ground by their feet like it’s followed them through space. How does that even work, anyway?
The bed is on the other side, against the wall. There's a dark comforter on it and a pile of fresh sheets and towels draped over the foot. Cas smiles at them and starts sorting. "Amelia," is all he says and Dean remembers all over again that Cas came from a regular family that does regular family things. Like have guests. And extra linens.
The next pictures, though... Dean doesn't know what to think of those, either: the curve of a hand resting on a table, fingertips tapping around a bottle of beer with a label half picked-off. A pair of familiar eyes, staring out of the page: his own. There are little sun-lines at the corners, and a thick fan of eyelashes.
Castiel hands find themselves clinging to Dean's soft shirt--holding him close, making sure he can't move too far away when their lips part. Castiel’s lungs are heaving: he might actually be shaking. He can't stop smiling when Dean rests their foreheads together, even though all he wants to do is wrest Dean back to his lips.
Dean cracks open an eye. "Cas," he murmurs. Not a few hours ago Cas couldn't even sit up by himself, he sure as hell shouldn't be healing Dean's little bumps. Actually... Dean peers suspiciously down at the gash on his side. That's gone, too.
Dean’s hands grip onto the wheel so hard the Impala swerves under them—fuck! Dean rights the car. Sam grabs the oh-shit handle and glares at him. Dean glares back, then shoots another one into the rearview mirror for good measure.
"I don't know," Cas answers. "They're cousins to angels, but they only answer to Death." He reaches for the Impala’s door handle, but doesn't open it. "She's very pretty," he says, apropos of absolutely fucking nothing.
"Oh, yes. It's lovely, Dean," Cas sighs. He's still watching Dean through the dark fringe of his lashes when he flicks his thumb down the stripe of sensitivity leading from the head of Dean's cock down to his shaft.
"They were so excited," Cas continues, but his arms tighten slightly and he ducks his head down into the space between Dean's chin and shoulder. "I was named for myself, which in hindsight I find hilarious. But growing up, knowing what little I knew and not knowing why… it was a burden. I knew when catechism was wrong. I could tell when Bible verses had been mistranslated. Gabriel was, absolutely, a
Cas crosses his arms and sighs. It makes him seem slightly more human and approachable. Dean has the feeling that's on purpose. "Take everything the others have told you with a grain of salt. I don’t know everything, but Dean’s been their main point of contact with humans. When there’s an appropriate moment, he and I can take some time to sort through what we know."
Dean has no idea what that means, but he yanks him down onto his cock and Cas's whole body reacts into it.
The celebratory mood lasts right up until Sam's screaming kicks back in, and it’s not the same kind of yelling. It’s so much worse.
"I am always glad to be of service," Cas murmurs, his cheek resting on the rise of Dean's knee. "But you were already beautiful as you were. Just a little... banged up."
"Dean," Cas murmurs, quietly. "It's okay. I'm okay. You're okay. Sam will be okay. You can stop, for now. You can experience it."
He wonders if Sam had these feelings when he went off to Stanford. He's not gonna ask, though; they've already had far too many heart-to-hearts in the last six months, and Dean can only take so much bonding before he starts getting hives.
Dean's looking down at him, though, and he's not sure if the expression on Dean's face is embarrassment for the hot column that Castiel can very clearly feel against his thigh, or anticipation, or fear. "Uh..." Dean mutters, and Castiel thinks he's likely just as flushed as Castiel himself. "Sorry, should... too much?"
Cas laughs, but sits down on the sofa and starts pulling the laptop towards him. Dean sits down beside him, and they start looking up stupid coupley shit to do in spring just outside Baltimore.
Cas's eyes have gone slightly wide, but the smile is still pretty fixed on his face, so Dean thinks maybe his tiny little implosion has been taken well.
The little man walks right up to the edges of the devil's trap—leans up and in, and it's, creepily, like watching a kid press his nose to a storefront window display. And Dean, well, Dean has to say he doesn't like it much when Crowley's eyes slide towards him. Just his red eyes, just his gaze—nothing else about him moves.
Yeah, Dean knows where this story’s going. The back of Dean's shoulder is damp. Dean’s throat aches with the words he can't quite figure out what to say.
making this difficult?" This time, his smile at Uriel is a challenge. "Or don't you trust yourself to make it quick like he would,
Then, just as sleep is about to pull him under, he feels the slightest hint of motion against and beside him. He feels lips pressed to his hairline, a soft brush of smiling breath.
He's sure as hell not going to rush Cas—he remembers just how long it took to get him ready last time. But while Dean enjoyed every second of fingering him open, holy shit, watching Cas do it for himself, seeing him gasp and arch and the way his eyelashes flutter when he must get a good stroke, is about ten times sexier. With his hand where it is, he can feel the tense, impatient push of Cas's fingers, and it gives him a little bit of an idea.
" His voice is ragged and hysterical, but that's just how a guy sounds when he’s worried he’s finally lost his mind.
Bobby rolls his eyes and pushes off the bolster he was leaning on. "Yeah, I think maybe we're done here."
"Castiel," he hisses, hand raising into a familiar snapping motion. “You pathetic little seraph, you think—”
"Yeah? Don't let me stop you." Dean says casually, but he's still pressing his fingers against Cas's where he's slowly stretching himself open. It's unbelievably hot and he can't even see what Cas is doing.
"Come on, I got it all laid out in there." Bobby doesn't even look at them as they step into the house.
Dean arches an eyebrow. "Oh, don't you even start,” he complains. “Pretty sure I've already got one stamped on my ass. Or so everyone tells me."
Cas blinks. "That's my brother. I was a professor of religious studies. Most religious archives don't exactly use the Dewey Decimal system. Or English. So..." he tilts his head. "Yes?"
The door closes and that seems to be the signal for Dean’s body to tell him how long today has been. His limbs are leaden and his eyes sandpapery. Cas comes up behind him, curling his body against Dean’s back. Both arms slide around Dean’s waist, and Cas hooks his chin over Dean's shoulder. Dean lets himself relax into the hold. Getting hugged from behind still feels a little backwards, but nice nonetheless.
He wakes up to the smell of coffee seconds before his phone alarm blares near his ear. Cas is at the countertop, and the little coffee machine is perking out a full cup of what's probably just as strong as brown water, but the smell will definitely help wake him up.
There's got to be a way to off Lilith and stop the breaking of the seals in all of this pulpy wannabe writer bullshit, but by the time he's into chapter umpteen, Dean's eyes are starting to burn from how tired he is. Chuck came wandering down a few hours ago, but it was only to grab another bottle of whiskey.
But Cas's smile over at the bigger angel isn't a smile at all—it's cold and bright. "I should have known you were involved," he says. "You always were a boot-licker."
But he draws himself another circle and dips to press just with the pad of one finger at where he's almost sure... maybe? Jesus, he can't even imagine it, everything seems so
Cas wiggles and uses his toes to pull the blanket up over them—somehow, without kneeing Dean in the thigh, which is kind of a great trick. "It's just a drop, and I assure you, Dean, I'm currently filled to overflowing."
it when Cas's eyes go dark and hungry. "Oh... yes, very much so," he promises, in a low, dark burr of a voice, and the click of the lube bottle coming open all of a sudden sounds very, very loud.The sweet torture of Cas’s lube-slippery hand running up and down Dean's cock, getting him good and wet, ends with a little flick of his thumb right along the ridge where head joins the shaft. The sensation of it almost lifts Dean’s hips right off the bed when he goes to chase it.
Cas doesn't say anything about the clothes situation, though. Maybe, maybe, he's just as pleased at the idea of wearing Dean's clothes as Dean is about seeing him in them.
"Yes!" Dean nods frantically. "Yes, please. Now? Now is good." He's babbling, just a little, but there's a part of Dean that feels like it’s been waiting for this his whole life. For someone to look at him the way Cas is. He never knew it until he got it. But it's here,
"Well, all of that's worth dick if we can't even find her," Bobby says, leaning back with his mug of toxic sludge. "How's this head bitch not making any waves?"
Dean blinks; he's having trouble concentrating over the screams of his baby brother. The betrayal in Sam’s voice physically pains Dean. "I'm sorry, what?" he asks, blankly.
Dean knows that what they burned wasn't actually the little brother they never knew they had. He knows it was the monster that ate the kid, and his mom. But that didn't mean that Adam Milligan wasn't real. He was.
"Castiel," Anna says, but she doesn't move. Her suit’s not torn anymore. Her smile is soft and bland.
Okay, Dean's gonna have to go look that one up. But clearly he's got something going, because that old, quiet pain is starting to fade from Cas's face, replaced by a hint of soft amusement. Yeah, Cas knows what he's doing. Dean's never exactly been subtle.
Something's weird. Of the two of them, Sam isn't the one that goes leaping for conclusions across burning rope bridges. That's Dean's job, and Dean doesn't like being the ones with the books and the clear eyes.
Sam makes a low, shocked choking noise in his throat. Dean lifts the straw up again. This time, Sam turns his face away.
"Sister," Castiel answers. He doesn't sound like he means it. But he doesn't sound sad, either, and his angel blade is out. "You're alive."
Uh... okay? Dean stares at him. "Dude, did you get hit on the head? You complain when I pick up someone all the time." Not that Dean ever picked up any guys in front of Sam, and guys were few and far between anyway, but that's not the point. Also, it’s not really the problem. "Also, uh... wait, how did you…?"
He runs his free hand down Cas's dirty, bloody sleeve. "Only reason I'm not blind drunk right this second is I need to remember this and I... I think maybe you wouldn't appreciate that, either." He cups Cas's cheek. It's still soft and prickly the way he remembers it feeling against his neck. "So I'll try not to die or to get myself killed, but after this, I’m gonna be drunk for a good long while. Please don’t be mad, ‘kay? I just… I can’t. I... I don't know if I'll ever really li—"
"You're right." Dean nods. "He'd never take that. Which, if he's taking this play act all the way, then that's exactly what he did."
Dean breathes for the first time since the convent, and Cas smiles brightly. Dean’s injuries aren’t healed, but there’s a certain sharp bite that’s no longer there. The sneaky bastard.
"You're dead," Dean wants to say, because he can't let himself want this again. He barely stood up from the floor the first time he saw Cas die. He still doesn't have any explanation for why the loss of someone he knew for less than a day has wrecked him for months, but the hole in his chest was so huge that he had to stop asking why.
Dean finds out Cas sent Jimmy packing along with Pamela, and he's relieved. A concerned, uninformed civilian can be a serious liability, and Dean's already distracted more than usual. Sam, too. The drive to the big-ass supernaturally inspired oak tree is tense, in many different ways.
Dean, whose brain has been a little offline since the first finger slid, slick and easy, into Cas's body, is still coming back from that kiss when Cas lays that on him. "Bwuah?" His lips and his tongue seem to be out of sync. "I mean," he clears his throat. "Are you sure?"
They haven't had a lot of these private, quiet moments, and that's not just because Dean's kept this separate from Sam. Dean wants this moment—sure, all of these moments, but right now, this one is what he wants the most.
Bobby gives him a curious, assessing look. "An ad salesman like you know anything about lookin' at lore?"
Dean blinks. "Yeah. Yeah, Cas, I'm..." he sighs, and looks up at where Bobby's staring at him. Dean lifts his lip in a sneer in Bobby's direction. Bobby's expression doesn't change. "I'm fine. We're at Bobby's."
Dean surges forward, tilting Castiel’s head back just enough to get his mouth on Castiel's neck. At first it just feels odd, but that sensation is briefly overturned by sparking pleasure down Castiel’s spine, and then back up. Castiel’s hips roll sharply, and the throb of pleasure just from that swallows him whole.
The air is so thin and dry Dean has to take a few deep breaths just to feel like he's getting enough. He hopes they're either here long enough to acclimate—he sort of forgot about that—or here for so little time that it doesn't matter.
"No," Cas replies idly. "It's because I was a religious studies major and you told me that made me sound like a 'fuddy duddy.’"
"And then... Jesus fuck, I don't want to call it a miracle, 'cause I don't think I believe in that shit." Dean shakes his head and turns the ring on his finger. "But Cas isn’t dead. He's an angel—guess he always was, just, crazy time shit happened. And he's helping out, y'know, us. The dumb monkeys that all the rest of the angels want to off."
The doorbell rings before Jimmy has time to answer. The voices out in the hallways aren't familiar to Dean, but Jimmy frowns. "Sorry," he says, gruff, but it's not an apology for what he said earlier. "That's my next door neighbor."
So maybe Dean's still got a sort of dumb smile on when they do finally get up and get dressed, watching the sleepy ruffles peel away and the angel come back out in his suit and trench coat. "I can make breakfast," Cas offers, "while you and Bobby get Sam."
There's no soft certainty of breath, anymore, or the way even Dean's vaunted memory foam bows just the tiniest bit towards his weight.
Zachariah sneers, ignoring the light that's still shining from the cut on his arm. "And I should have known that you being put out of your misery when you were weak from your reintegration was too good a rumor to be true. Could Uriel not even do that much right?” He sighs and shakes his head, sadly. “You always were wrong in the head, Castiel, but now you've thrown your lot in with the apes?"
One leg now bare, Cas runs his hand back up the inside, nails scraping bluntly at Dean’s inner thigh. Dean worries he's going to be a bit chilly until Cas doesn't actually put his leg down, but rather, hoists it over his shoulder, knee practically pressing into Cas’s ear. Cas turns his head just enough to kiss Dean’s bare knee and then leans back in, thumbs drifting to Dean's hip bones, circling slowly, teasing the edge of his boxers now and then.
interesting ants?" Dean retorts, throwing up his hands. "'Cause somehow, that seems like the better option right now! Maybe we can go back to that?"
When he opens them again Alastair and Cas are both gone. There’s a smear of ash and darkness on the ground where Cas stood. That’s all that’s left.
"Were you serious? 'Bout needing to rest,” Dean asks, quiet, worried. He hasn't forgotten what Cas said about his batteries.
A warm hand sneaks its way around Dean's cock —fingers callused, but still soft in all the right places. Not that he'd been paying attention to when Cas finally unwrapped his fingers from around Dean’s, because Dean had every intention of continuing the slow, even drag up and down Cas’s cock.
Rescue comes from an even more unlikely source—one who puts toast and eggs in front of Dean, and it smells fantastic. Amelia actually smiles at him. And pats him on the top of his head. Whoa, okay. "Stop, Jimmy, alright?" she says, firmly. "Can't you see Cassie's happy? I've never seen him happy like this, have you?"
"I'm sorry, you must be thinking of someone else,” Dean answers, sweet as can be. “You're just not my type."
Castiel spends three minutes in his room with sweaty palms and a pounding heart and absolutely no idea what the hell is happening. But Dean has never not followed up on that sort of threat (well, any sort of threat, really) so Castiel changes and then, apprehensively, finds his way back to Dean's door.
There's not much else to do after that other than wait. Unfortunately, there's still more than 30 hours until show time, and that's too long for Dean to simply be able to distract himself. He already knows he's going to go a little crazy in the interim, and poor Cas is going to get the bulk of it aimed at him.
God, he's so polite, and that shouldn't do it for Dean the way it really, really does. Dean sets his hips and thrusts harder, rubbing against him, between thick, strong thighs.
"Why did you?" Dean runs a slow hand down Cas's arm, ending the sweep with the tangle of their fingers. “The way you talked about it,” he studies Cas’s fingers and the way they look next to his, “you sounded like it might be worse than being dead.”
What? "I..." Castiel's voice is rusty as nails and his eyes look away sharply. "I don't know if that's a good idea." He reaches out with two fingers and tugs at the blanket over Dean's shoulder. "You have your own now, anyway."
Castiel isn't sure how to respond to that. Admitting anything means admitting that he not only entered Dean's room without permission (not a hard and fast rule, he's learned, but verboten when humans are asleep) but he also witnessed something deeply personal. Something Dean works very hard to pretend never happens.
Crowley turns to study him. "Hmm." He looks Bobby up and down, and he doesn't look impressed. "A little..." he wobbles his finger around, "crunchy, isn't it? That soul of yours. Good chance Hell will get it anyway."
"Oh, really?" Sam straightens and looks interested. "So what happens when, say, a human soul goes to
"In our pure forms," Cas says slowly, like he's just now sorting out his own theories on what happened, "time is a little more fluid. A heartbeat for you can be an eternity for me. I think whatever pure accident sent me back, reached ahead, too. Kept us connected over time and space."
"Yeah, well, he knows, right? He knows that Lilith's death ain't just endgame, it's the end of all things, and that Ruby..." Dean looks up, and at Bobby's face. Then at Cas's. His gut drops. "You think he still believes in Ruby."
"And you've been an angel for as long as I've known you. You sayin' people can't change?" Dean narrows his eyes. "'Cause I'm pretty sure I know a little more about what it is to be human than you do, buddy."
He's about to close the one eye that he's got open—because it's taking a completely stupid amount of energy to keep it that way—and just let his body fall into dreamland when he realizes that all the lights are still on. (Well, yeah, they're on: Dean's never understood what's all that much fun about having sex in the dark. If his partner's hot enough to want to sleep with, Dean's gonna want to
"I've seen them do this before: distract a battlefield commander who was just a hair too good at their job." Cas shrugs, looking away, and then glancing briefly at Dean. "I've seen them redirect what should have been the ‘right’ plan to something that fit their notion of convenience... It's what makes me think the emphasis on Lilith, alongside their strange incompetence about the other seals, is suspect. Lilith and her troops alone can’t be responsible for warding off the whole host of Heaven."
Cas smirks. "More like a Dean Winchester kink; the rest is just details." He looks Dean up and down one more time. "Though I admit, this version has the lingering air of competency and strong hands. I like it."
"No. You didn’t hurt me," Castiel breathes out, shakily. His eyes don’t leave the way Dean’s fingers are moving on his forearm. "That… I see. It explains a lot."
"You are," Bobby says gravely. The door clangs shut with threatening clang. "This is for your own good."
... tied here, now, not to Heaven. She tried to send me back, and it didn’t work… but I paid a price for it. We paid a price. I was held together by the thinnest of threadbare lines. I
Dean nods, already knowing Cas is going to suggest angeling them away if it comes down to that. Dean wants to say ‘no,’ because last time it left Cas so drained, and fucking
He also has no explanation for the small, soft smile that curves Cas's lips, either, because that feels—it looks—a whole lot like a welcome, and maybe a bit like wonder. Shit, they just saw each other five minutes ago, and Dean doesn’t know this guy from Adam—not really. There should be no ‘welcoming’ going on anywhere.
The room is quiet, save for their labored breathing. It's a good quiet, though, not the ominous, dark quiet that keeps Castiel awake. Dean is a heavy and pliant weight on top of him, and it's another wonderful part of the whole experience. Castiel's skin still tingles, and Dean seems to be shaking a little as those wonderful big hands pet the closest patches of skin Dean can reach.
That's not Dean's Cas. It can't be. Suit and tie; blade that’s shining even in the half-dark of this shithole. That's an angel. That’s
Dean finds himself smiling against Cas's lips when he finally draws back for air and resettles them, his elbows balanced over Cas's shoulders. His head has stopped spinning for long enough that he's really feeling the way Cas's cock is pressed between their bodies. One of Cas's hands is on his shoulder, and the other has left off clutching the bedsheets and is on Dean’s hip now.
Dean's throat sticks a little, watching them. It doesn't pass him by that between him, Sam, and Cas, the eternal angel who's unimpressed by bacteria on Mars is the one who grew up with a perfectly normal family.
Cas chews on his lower lip, eyes distant. "Maybe," he finally admits. "I have... a few friends remaining. Not many, though. I'll have to think about it."
(Cas excuses himself from the table at the expressions on Sam’s and Claire’s faces, but yes, Dean can still feel him laughing in the bathroom.)
"Where?" Dean asks, pitifully grateful to hear Cas's voice. So far Cas hasn't done anything but be patient, if reserved. He's an excellent copilot, insofar as he defers to most of Dean's choices and only gets demanding when it's important, like Dean being so tired he might drive off the road. But the silence in between hasn’t been
Jimmy's the one who breaks the silence, because Jesus fucking Christ, what does someone even say to that? "They... weren't all bad dreams, though, Cassie, were they?"
Dean's brain is still gooey and quiet with pleasure, so it takes him a moment to figure out what Cas means. When he does, eyes he didn’t even realize that he’d closed fly open, and the idea of it jolts him with another shiver. "Really?" he breathes.
"That depends," Cas answers, a bit tartly. "Are you checking to ensure that I am truly one of the family, so that you might call upon my pancake magic whenever you wish? Or because you want to steal me away from Dean and have me for your own?"
Sam slowly moves his arm: there's a wince, but he seems to have full range of motion. Cas goes to finish the job, but Sam stops him before Dean can. "I'm good."
“You like it a little fast and rough, huh?” Dean wouldn’t be saying this stuff if they weren’t—if this weren’t so good, if Cas weren’t taking him in a lot faster and rougher than Dean would ever have treated him, but fuck, Cas looks like he’s having the time of his life, his bottom lip red and swollen from how hard he’s been chewing on it, his eyes a thin dark rim of sapphire around dark pupils. “Maybe you’d like it if you could still feel the stretch of it the next morning.”
It's not enough—it'll never be enough—but it's something. Dean nods, and starts shifting the body into his arms.
"Cas take you somewhere good?" Sam asks, but his eyes are still squeezed shut and his mouth is set in a grim line.
Crowley actually rocks back on his heels and looks surprised. "Oh, that old thing? Well, well. This is a surprise. I was sure no one knew I had that.” He runs his thumb back and forth over his upper lip. “Yes, that pretty little thing can kill just about anything. One problem, though," Crowley continues, casually. He seems more businesslike now: less show, more get-shit-done. "No one can use it. Death doesn’t like anyone playing with his toys.”
