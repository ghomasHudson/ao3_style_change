"Right, I believe we should go," Sherlock announced as he checked over Harry and John and smiled, "You two look perfect," he told them.
John went over to one of the benches and sat down on a stool. He smiled as he watched the two of them. Chemistry wasn't John's strongest subject, but he still enjoying experimenting when he was in those classes. These days, he enjoyed watching Sherlock. It was twenty minutes later that the door opened and Mike walked in.
Mycroft nodded his head as someone walked into the living room, "Ah Anthea," he smiled as she handed him a disk.
Sherlock got out of the cab, and John was left behind to pay once again. The older man rolled his eyes as he followed Sherlock towards the tape. Donovan was there, but she ignored the two of them as they ducked under the tape and walked over to Lestrade.
"Let him go and tell us what the hell you want we don't want him," Petunia yelled, well more like screeched.
"I think we do all right," John said as he looked at Marian and took a seat on the sofa, "At this moment in time he is happy and safe, and that is all that matters. Though we do have something that we need to show you," he said reaching the desk and plucking the papers that they had the Dursley's sign, "Here, his guardians have relinquished their rights to us."
Sherlock looked up from where he was sat at the desk in the living room. Mycroft had sent them information about Harry, which he had been able to find out. He had found the family and had been able to survey them over night. They didn't appear at all concerned for their nephew. Sherlock couldn't even figure out how Harry was related to them, as he looked nothing like them. It was mid afternoon and he glanced at his phone as it buzzed.
"Don't you worry about that, grown ups are supposed to care for the kids," he said as his breathing became rough. Harry held his hand as the light faded from his eyes. Harry gave a little sob as he sat there. Snuffles went over to him and pulled at his clothes. Harry followed him back into the alley and settled further in, almost out of sight as he slowly fell into a restless exhausted slumber.
Harry went with him over to his desk and sat down. He was about to say something when he heard a noise from outside of the room. The door to the next room opened and they could hear someone walking out. Harry's instincts told him that it was the man, and he learned to trust them over the years. He looked around for somewhere to hide. Mike moved and let him hide under his desk, since there was a back to it so no one could look, and it reached the floor so there would be no way to tell that someone was under there.
"Right, you think that you bring danger to us, don't you? And that is why you are feeling like you are at the moment," Sherlock questioned seeing Harry's nod of agreement.
John smiled as he saw Sherlock come into the room, "I think it would be best if the canine remained with us," was the simple answer as he went to the sofa and sat back down.
Thank you for the wonderful comment and the kudos, you guys are the best ever. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Snuffles gave a bark, gaining the attention of the whole weird little family. He was happy as he looked at his master and gave another bark as Harry went over to him and ruffled his fur and began to play a little.
Harry frowned as he heard some voices in the hallway, it wasn't often that he heard someone, mostly he just heard footsteps going to and fro outside his door. Harry carefully got out of the bed, and went over, glad that he was no longer hooked up to an IV. He slowly opened the door and looked out. He could see a young woman talking to a man. The man turned a little and Harry froze.
John looked to Harry and smiled, "Don't worry, he is just annoyed at the moment because he can't find this killer," he told him as he led the way to 221b, "I'll sort out a bedroom for you," he said, his bedroom was now free since he had moved down into Sherlock's just over a month ago.
"Thanks, Molly," John said softly as he looked at the two working away and shook his head, "I'll leave them a little, Harry finally seems happy."
"And he won't give us that if he doesn't trust us to keep it to ourselves," John sighed as he leaned against Sherlock.
"I was already there getting my own. I hope I got something that you all will like," she worried putting down the variety of sandwiches and cold drinks she had brought.
Sherlock got off the phone and looked over at John. He wasn't happy about what he had heard, but he knew that there wasn't much that he could do about it. John looked at him and then sighed. He had a feeling he knew what it was going to be about.
"Sorry," John smiled to her, "Oh, and Harry, this is Mrs Hudson, she's out landlady, and she will remind you that she is not our housekeeper," he said, as he looked back to Harry.
Harry laughed a little, the smile finally reaching his eyes, "It will be all right, though?" he asked as he stood up.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. Hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well!
"Do I have to go with you?" Harry asked, fear lacing his voice even though he was trying to hide it once more.
Thank you for the brilliant comments and kudos, you guys are awesome! I do hope that you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Harry nodded his head and went back to Sherlock. John watched Harry and Sherlock begin their experiments again. He smiled as he walked over to Mike. John was thankful for the help that Mike had given Harry.
Sherlock could see the sadness that clung to the man and he stood up once more and walked around the table. He walked up behind John and wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him against him, leaning his chin on John's right shoulder. John relaxed into him. He didn't know how to bring up what he was thinking, not knowing if Sherlock would be all right with his suggestion. Sherlock placed a kiss on his cheek as he said, "We shall talk when we have this killer locked up, we have to ask Harry what he wants to do," he told him softly.
Sherlock and Mycroft followed. Harry was staring at the house, "They are all monsters, they locked me away, make me work all day and then beat me when I can't do what they want. I learned to cook only because they would burn me on the stove if I didn't get it right," he said, he could see people about, able to hear him.
Sherlock and Mycroft looked appalled at that, "It's a four bedroom house and there are four of you, there should have been plenty of room for you to have one," Mycroft said with a shake of his head.
"That she is, when the CIA came here they were after something. Mrs Hudson was harmed by them trying to get the information out of her. She pretended to be the sweet old landlady slash housekeeper for us and that she had no idea where it was or anything. Worked rather well. She had it hidden on her and pretended to be a weak old woman, but she is anything but," Sherlock smirked over at her as he then looked back to Harry.
"I shall leave him in your… care," Marian said snidely, "But you need to find him a proper home and family soon. If not I shall take that duty for myself." Marian turned and walked out of the room, Diane following behind her as they walked down the stairs and out of the house.
Sherlock just nodded to him and lay down on the sofa and disappeared into his mind palace. Harry watched him in fascination. John just shook his head and began to make some lunch, making something up for the dog as well. Seems they would have a full house for a while.
Sherlock nodded his head and got up, letting John stretch out on the sofa. John smiled his thanks and quickly drifted off. Harry frowned and then began to read the book John had lent him. Sherlock went to the kitchen and began to work on an experiment that he had planned to do a few days ago. Harry's curiosity got the better of him as he put the book down and went into the kitchen and watched what Sherlock was doing.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes and I wish to speak with you and your husband concerning your nephew Harry Potter," he said, his voice calm and even.
"What you asked for, there is someone there, we are trying to track him now," she added as she gave a nod to the two other men, a slight frown when she saw Harry and then walked out again.
Harry found what he needed and started to cook, he had done it so often that he now did it without the prompt of Aunt Petunia screaming at him to do the breakfast. He cooked what was needed for a Full English for two, not even thinking about doing himself a breakfast, since he normally didn't have one with the Dursley's. He began to dish up as he heard the two men coming to the kitchen.
"11 Sickles just to rid, 13 if you want hot chocolate and 15 if you want a hot water bottle, and if you are bringing the dog then it's another 3 sickles" was the answer as Harry climbed aboard.
Harry nodded his head, "okay," he said with a little smile, he turned to Mrs Hudson and hugged her tightly, "It's just that when you were hurt it…" he trailed off for a moment, "you are everything I ever imagined a grandmother to be and it was like someone hurt my family and I hated it. I wanted to make sure that you would rest and take it easy and make sure that you were all right," he told her softly, his voice so quiet that the two men in the chairs could only just hear the words.
I thought I would change this up, there are always so many that have Dumbledore take Harry away from what is now a loving family. Soo, hope you enjoy this little change :D
Harry nodded and grinned as he went and got ready, grabbing the lead and clipping it onto Snuffles's collar. The two walked out of the flat, locking the door behind them and saying goodbye to Mrs Hudson. They walked to the park and let Snuffles off the lead so he could play with the ball that Harry was throwing for him. Harry had to chase him half the time. Sherlock smiled as he watched, the teen was quick on his feet. Though it darkened his thoughts a little as to why he was quick on his feet.
"He is up in his room, he is going back to a place that has basically been a prison to him for all his life, he needs to gather the courage to go and see them again after what ever it is that drove him away," John told him as he got up and called Harry down.
Thank you for the wonderful reviews. They are amazing. So happy that you are enjoying this story, I do hope that you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Harry nodded his head, he didn't really trust anyone. How could he with all that had happened to him? He sighed as he quickly left the room. John and Sherlock watched him go.
"Yes, there are a few things that we can do there, that I'm not allowed to do here," Sherlock grinned, becoming excited at the thought of doing a few more experiments with Harry.
Moments later John was downstairs with him as something came bounding up the stairs and leaped towards Harry, jumping on him and licking his face. Harry fell backwards and onto the floor.
"I think that went well, there is still some guilt, but he doesn't feel as bad," Sherlock said as he looked at John as he began to bring things out to make lunch.
John nodded, "Yeah, nightmares hit me as well," he told him, "I dreamt about the day I was shot when I was in the army. It changed my life, but it did lead me to Sherlock," he told him, "Sherlock has helped me with them since we met, first with the violin, then talking to me and now like this," he said as he brought up their joint hands.
"He had a nightmare last night, woke up around two, in the end he came down and joined me in the kitchen for a few experiments, though it took coaxing to get him to come in again," Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock went past them and up the stairs, Harry following him, since he didn't like the thought of Sherlock being alone. Sherlock looked around and Harry was doing the same as well. He froze when he saw it, there was a message on the wall over the fireplace.
"I do not believe that he has gone to school recently, the things that he should know, he doesn't, but he does ask questions," he explained as he looked at Harry that was now leaning fully against John.
John moved closer and looked out of the window as well, he couldn't see, "I can't see anyone out there," he replied with a shake of his head.
"Just a ride to Kings Cross Station," he said as he handed over the sickles and took a seat on one of the beds.
"Hey, I'm all for it, been saying since the start you two should just get together the UST was killing everyone around you," he grinned as he spoke quietly.
Harry gave smile, "I think it might make them explode when they see it. It just screams bespoke," he told him, almost copying Sherlock's more haughty tone that he had heard a few times.
"You will be in our care for a while. I know not ideal but so far Sherlock hasn't started shooting the walls with you around so… good thing for us too, yeah?" John joked though there was a look on his face that Sherlock could easily read.
Sherlock nodded his head, "Of course, Harry, choose what you would like from the Chinese menu on the desk and tell me. I'll be ordering in about two hours," he said as he turned to Harry.
"Right so now you can go, it's all right for me to wait a few minutes for him to come, so go," Harry smiled to the two of them.
Harry shook his head, "I know that, but I know that you have to go, you can't just stay here with me when there is a killer out there wanting to kill again, what if you are able to find out where he is hiding, then you might get him," he started to tell the two of them, "If you don't go then you won't find any of this out and we will still be wondering who he is and where he is," he sighed a little, rubbing a little at his throat.
Harry pushed the arms away as he said, "Sorry, I'm sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. I'm fine," he told them as he pushed John's hand away as he tried to put it on his shoulder, "I don't need help. I'm fine," he said once more.
Harry laughed as he was on the floor, "Snuffles, get off," he said as he pushed the dog off and smiled.
Sherlock and John were sat in the living room that night, Harry had gone to bed hours ago. Still protesting all the clothes and things they had brought for him. John leaned against Sherlock and yawned. He was tired, he got up as he turned off the TV and went to Sherlock, when he stopped as he heard a loud scream from upstairs. Both men shared a quick look as they ran to Harry's bedroom and found him on his bed shaking.
Thank you for the awesome kudos and comments! You guys are the best!!! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
"Now, you boys were arguing over clothes, have you thought to ask Harry what he would want, since it is him that you will be buying for," Mrs Hudson said as she looked to them.
"Right, we shall take our leave," Diane said, she could see that they were not going to get anywhere with the men in the room.
"How are you able to sleep through all that's just happened? How can you not have nightmares?" he wondered as he heard a soft knock on the door, "Come in," he called out, wincing a little, hoping he hadn't woken Harry.
John smiled as he said, "Well, I don't know about you, but it's almost lunchtime, so why don't I get something hot started for us," he then stood up, ruffling Harry's hair as he went past him and headed into the kitchen.
"Do you know what else, though. I went to school with burns on my arms," he interrupted her, pulling up his sleeves and showed the few scars that he had on his arms. There were a couple in a circular pattern on his arms. They were faded, but could still be seen., "When I burnt anything while learning to cook, they punished me by pressing my arms to the hob. I went to school with them still hurting and blistered and they didn't believe me when I told them what happened. That my Aunt had called them that morning before I arrived saying that I had put my arms on there and refused to let them take me to the hospital. In reality, I had spent the weekend in the cupboard under the stairs in pain. So I ask you again, where were you then? Where were you when I really needed someone on my side?" he was almost pleading for an answer.
"The lab at Bart's. Harry and I could do some experiments and I could teach him a few things." Sherlock said, glancing towards Harry, before continuing quietly, "it might take his mind off things. I know he does enjoy it. He is rather curious about things," he finished.
"Why have you come here to help me now? Why not when I really needed it. When I was being beaten, starved and made to work so hard that my hands would bleed. Where were you then?" he asked her, his eyes serious and his mouth pressed into a thin line.
Harry walked into the kitchen. It was nearing dinner time, in an hour. Sherlock was the only other person in the flat, though Mrs Hudson was downstairs in her own room. John had been called in to take a shift at the clinic. They were down two doctors after a wave of patients with stomach flu was coming in. Sherlock just hoped he wouldn't bring it back with him.
"We need to go out for a little while, we shouldn't be too long, but we need to go and we can't take you with us," Sherlock said as he looked to the teen. He could see Harry become tense and uneasy.
"I think he might be correct, you're not a mother at all, no mother would do that to any child whether their own or not," John said with a shake and then he walked out after Harry.
John walked into the room and was relieved to see that Harry was talking to Sherlock, and Sherlock was behaving himself. An hour later Sherlock and John had all they needed to try and track the man down, the police would be there doing the same soon. John was tempted to remain with Harry, but knew he would need to keep an eye on Sherlock. They said goodbye and left the teen alone to rest. Harry settled down, tired from all that had happened. He hadn't slept well in the alley waking up scared out of his mind in case the killer or his uncle had found him. Soon he was asleep, feeling a little safer now he was somewhere safe.
Uncle Vernon gave one large kick to Harry and then rushed over to try and keep his sister in the house and not to let her float around Little Whinging.
Hope your week is going well. There are only two chapters left after this one. So close to the end everyone!!!
“First of all, I don’t think making a stink bomb is part of the national school curriculum either and secondly, are you saying that he doesn’t have any secondary education at all?”
The dog walked a little close, his sharp nose catching the smell of blood that hung around the teen. He watched as he pulled out a wand and quickly went over and whined at him, crawling on his belly, trying to show the child that he was no threat to him at all. He carried on going towards him as Harry looked to him, wand out, but pointed to the ground.
"Who is he?" Molly asked, not having heard anything about the teen. Mike and John quickly filled her in, "Ah," she nodded, "you only have temporary custody of him?"
"He didn't come back so don't you worry about that. Now how are things?" Mike asked Harry as he glanced at the two men in the room, who were watching them both.
"Harry doesn't need you to find him a family, he has seen what family can do to each other. He needs people that will be able to understand what he is going through and will be there to help. I think it is time that people started to listen to him and what he wishes," Mycroft said, "Now I suggest that you leave, you have caused enough upset for one day."
Mrs Hudson could see that they were beginning to scare Harry with the way they were acting and she put her arms around the young teen and said, "Don't worry Harry, they are always like this, they are just having a little domestic, don't you worry. It happens," she reassured him.
John looked over to him and shook his head, "No, Sherlock," he said, frowning, "it would be better to get him something that he could wear all the time, suits just aren't practical."
Thank you for all the comments and the kudos, you are all so amazing and I adore each and every single one of you!
Harry sat down on one of the chairs, trying not to look around too much. He didn't know what he should do.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he looked at the woman, "You have no idea of what is going on and how Harry is coping with the disturbances in his life. So please don't inflict us with your idiotic spouting of useless words," he told her.
Hi all, sorry for being away for so long. I ended up with a cold and I'm still fighting a chest infection that really doesn't want to go.
Lestrade walked back in with a hot mug of coffee, sipping at it tentatively as he went back to his desk and sat down, "Right," he said, "Just have to find somewhere for him to go," he said softly.
"I…" Diane began looking from where the teen had disappeared up the stairs and to the others in the room.
"I believe I shall go as well, work never stops," Mycroft said as he gave an incline of his head to his brother, "And make sure to take care of those two," he added, getting a smile from John as he left.
The door to the flat opened and Harry's eyes shot to the door as a well-dressed man walked in. Umbrella swinging in his hand as he looked around. His pale blue eyes landing on the teen sitting in Sherlock's usual chair. Snuffles gave a few barks as he went over to Harry and sat near him.
"How about we go somewhere?" Sherlock suggested from where he sat at the kitchen table, hoping that it would be able to take Harry's mind from the things that were going on in his life.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, you guy and gals are amazing! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
"Mike," Harry smiled as he left Sherlock and went over to him, "I'm well, are you? He didn't come back again did he?" he asked him, worry entering his voice.
John, Sherlock and Mrs Hudson had all see the guilt in his eyes and each of them had tried to get him to stop, but nothing had worked. Mrs Hudson had tried getting him to stop by making cakes, instead, Harry had taken over and made them for her. John and Sherlock didn't know what they could do. Harry hadn't slept well during the night, waking up from nightmares, and not just about what had happened, but what could have happened.
"Strange that you of all people would recommend those two Donovan, but yeah, that might work," he nodded as Harry started to wake up, "Can you go and get us both something for breakfast," he asked the woman.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter, just messing around while I have the chance. I do hope you enjoy my fun.
"No you don't," Harry said shaking his head, "I was six when I first told someone about being hit by my uncle and nothing was done. Instead, my aunt and uncle told lies about me to the teacher I had told and the headmaster. Saying that I was a delinquent, that I did nothing but cause trouble for them and the people in the neighborhood. That I bullied other children all the time. When in reality I was nothing but a slave to them. That it was my cousin that was the bully, and that I myself was quiet and so scared half the time. It took everything that I was to ask for help. I had seen on TV and around the place that I could tell someone and they would listen to me. But they didn't."
"He can't trust people," Sherlock said as he observed Harry's behaviour, "He was abused John, before he ran away. We need to find out who they were, we need his last name."
He nodded his head and they got ready to go, Mrs Hudson proving to them all that she was fine as she got ready and joined them at Sherlock's instance. They went out, Harry not sure if they should, but went along with it. Sherlock quickly told John what was going on at the flat so that he wouldn't be surprised. It was a nice time, the only thing that marred it that night was when Harry had his nightmare. Thankfully, Sherlock had been there to comfort him.
"You ran away from home because of what one of them did to you," Sherlock said as he observed the young teen, "That is why you didn't tell them your last name."
Lestrade quickly told Harry that he was going to ask Sherlock and John to take him and keep him safe. Harry was happy inside at the thought, since they had both helped him. Lestrade called Sherlock first and then John when he got no answer. John agreed to stop by at lunch for a talk, Lestrade didn't tell them why he wanted them there. Donovan came back and the two ate breakfast together, with Lestrade going back to work and Harry nosing through a few things, though trying to hide it. Lestrade once again smiled as the thought of the similarities with Sherlock crossed his mind.
"I know, but I think you need to do this, you went before and it was all fine," he said with a little smile, he didn't want them to change what they did because he was there, he gave a small cough as he looked to Snuffles, "I have him as well."
Donovan looked to the kid that had rolled over a little, the coat falling down to reveal his face. She looked a little closer and saw a scar on his forehead, "Who would do such a thing to a kid," she murmured as she saw that it was too clean to have been caused by an accident.
"How about Watson and Holmes," she gave a suggestion, not in maliciousness, but knowing that the two of them would be able to keep him safe.
Mike waited until he couldn't hear the man before he moved and let Harry out. He pulled out his phone and tried to call Sherlock and then John, but didn't get any answer. He sighed and then called Lestrade, telling him that he should come to his classroom. It was twenty minutes before Lestrade walked through the doors and was told what had happened. Mike checked Harry over once more saying that he was all right to go, just to make sure to feed him.
"You are welcome to stay longer Mycroft," John said, he glared to Sherlock when he began to protest.
Harry nodded his head, "I know I will do one of the days," he told them as he then said, "Right, so are you going to go or not?"
Harry put aside the tray and looked around the room he was in. He was still surprised to be in there, especially after the police had finished their talk with him. He thought he would be in a ward when everything was over, but that hadn't happened. Harry was beginning to get a little bored, there was nothing for him to do, he wasn't into watching TV like a lot of teens, he preferred to read.
Sherlock smiled at him as he began to explain his experiment. Snuffles had followed the teen for a moment before seeing Harry was safe and then went back to the rug to sleep. Harry watched Sherlock with fascination, forgetting his wariness and actually asking questions. His curiosity coming out once more after being down trodden for most of his life, from the Dursley's and from Snape. Sherlock was impressed with what was being asked, though he could tell that the teen should know a lot of what he was asking him already, if he had been going to school.
Vernon got up as soon as he saw the teen and stalked towards him, he raised his hand about to hit him as John moved and had the fat lump pinned to the nearest wall and none too gently as well, "I believe it would be best if you didn't do such a thing Dursley," John snapped at him as he pushed the arm higher causing him to squeal in pain.
"Anthea is already going through the last few minutes of footage to see what we can find. We are going to be tracking all that have been near this street," he told them, there was worry evident in his voice and eyes as Sherlock and John looked to him, "Snuffles was hurt, but the vet said he was fine and just needed to sleep things off," he said as he pointed to the dog sleeping in his bed.
"Harry," John called out to the teen as he sat on a chair looking towards the window, an open book that belonged to John sitting on his lap.
"Change her back!" Uncle Vernon yelled as he rained punches and kicks down on Harry. Harry said nothing as he tried to protect himself from the blows.
"I will be doing my best to make sure Harry remains safe as well Detective Inspector," Mycroft added, "At the moment, I have this place under surveillance and I have people on standby that can be here within minutes if need be."
Diane took the papers and looked through then, "they are official," she said handing them to her colleague to look through.
"Well before I let you unleash your 'dogs of war' speech and cement yourself to become my brother's most favourite in-law, let me talk to him for a moment," Sherlock interjected as he pulled out his phone and called his brother.
Sherlock went down and helped John bring Mrs Hudson up the stairs to their flat. John didn't want her to go to her own room as he needed to keep an eye on her. She didn't look to bad a little bruised, but he knew that she had been through a lot more than that.
"Who is it you want to talk to?" Mike asked, wondering if there was someone that he would be able to contact to come and see the child to help him.
Mycroft walked up the stairs to 221B and into the living room. He smiled as he saw his brother, John, and Harry all gathered in the living room. The young teen was curled up, reading. Mycroft couldn't help but be a little surprised that he hadn't wanted to watch TV, he had believed that most teens would have preferred to watch than read anything.
"They just started when they said about getting me some clothes," he told her soft as he just watched them.
Sherlock gave a pout at that, but John made sure he kept quiet with a look. John gave in and said one suit, which made him happy. They were soon cleaned up and ready to go shopping. Harry was a little unsure of it, but both men took him anyway.
Harry moved as quickly as his injuries would let him as the smaller of the two men looked towards him. Their eyes met as the taller started to look over. The smaller gave a sad smile and then drew the taller mans attention to him once again. The small man kept the taller mans attention on his as he pulled out a knife and stabbed him repeatedly. Harry watched in wide-eyed fright, hands over his mouth to stop himself from scream out. Snuffles gave a low growl, understanding the need to keep quiet.
"This is Harry, he is staying with us for now," Sherlock replied, though there was something in his voice that made Mycroft look at him suspiciously.
Harry looked between the two of them as they argued back and forth about getting him suits or more casual clothing. He was beginning to feel a little nervous as they carried on bickering, their voices never raising over the talking level as they tried to show each other why the other was wrong and their were right. Harry got up and moved away from the table as he heard someone coming up the stairs.
"It will be fine Harry. we're thinking about taking you to the Lab's at St Bart'., Sherlock would like to do a few experiments with you," John said as he smiled over at Sherlock.
They walked back to Baker street and opened the door to a sight that made their hearts drop. John rushed over to Mrs Hudson who was lying on the floor near her flat. Harry looked around, instantly on alert, just as Sherlock was as well.
They left the flat and headed to St Bart's, it didn't take long for Sherlock to lead them to one of the labs. Harry's eyes went wide as he looked around, it was the same one that he had hidden in when he was at the hospital. He quickly told them that and they smiled reassuringly, they could see the nervousness and the reminder of what had nearly happened to him. Sherlock began to gather the equipment that they would need and started to set up, explaining things as he went..
Harry looked at it and then to John, "I've never had a phone how do you…?" he trailed off, embarrassed.
"I think it might be best to do that a little later, at the moment I know that Hermione will be on holiday, she goes every summer," he said, though he wasn't sure if she had gone on holiday or not.
"Any other friends that you can talk to or tell them what is going on?" John asked him, a little curious as to why he had never mentioned them before.
"You're not going to hurt me are you?" Harry asked the dog, feeling a little stupid about asking, but he felt that the canine would be able to understand him.
Sorry for disapering, fatigue plagued me for a week and then a cold, which I am still recovering from.
This story is finished and I will be updating it once a week on a Wednesday baring anything else happening. There is a total of 34 chapters and we have around 10 chapters to go after this one is up.
It was an hour later that the door to the room opened and someone walked in. Harry froze once again and moved a little, knocking into one of the stools.
"I think you should as well John," Sherlock then grinned to him. John had one suit that had been tailor-made, at Sherlock's insistence a couple of months ago for a case they were on. He had only worn it the once.
Harry flinched a little, wondering when they were going to try and talk to him about his dream. His friends did that a lot when they were at school but they were never anything that he wanted to talk about, no matter how much they pressured him. Harry looked at them and asked, "Yes?"
Someone knocked on the door and Lestrade called them in. John walked in first and then Sherlock. It was just past lunchtime and Lestrade had been about to get something for lunch for the two of them.
"So far from what we have seen of him, he is intelligence and has done well in protecting you. I believe that it would be best if he were to remaining with you and protect you when we are not here," Sherlock told him, a small smile on his face as the dog gave a loud bark, making Harry and John both jump at the sudden noise.
Harry went still as he heard a noise behind him. Fear went through him as he thought that Uncle Vernon had found him and was going to finish what he had started. He slowly turned his head and saw the dog that was watching him. The dog was larger than any he had seen before. Black fur all over and it looked rough as it took a step towards him. Harry's green eyes went wide in fear as he tried to move away, not getting far as his body protested the movements.
Diane and Marian couldn't answer the question. They didn't know how to answer and made Harry see that he needed to be in a proper home that would be able to help him.
"No, I know that England would fall if that happened," John gave a dry chuckle as he watched the two in the living room.
Harry talked with Stan about the recently escaped Sirius Black. Harry knew he would be all right in he Muggle world. The black dog sat next to Harry on the floor, just about keeping his feet as the bus hurtled around London, letting of one or two passengers before they reached Kings Cross Station. Harry got off with the dog.
"I can see it's more than that by the way that you are sitting," John told him, shaking his head a little, "I know how to spot injuries Harry, I trained hard to do so."
Harry smiled back, "I trust you, just don't…" he trailed off as he turned back to the window and looked out.
"I'll do you something in a bit," John said to the dog as he looked up to him and gave a small woof. John then looked to Harry as he said, "Sherlock and I had a talk last night about Snuffles," he began.
Mrs Hudson climbed the stairs as Harry went about dusting and polishing everything around him. She went into 221B and over to the sofa and sat down. John looked at her and Sherlock looked into the living room from where he was in the kitchen.
"Yes," he nodded as he got up and walked over to the landing and called out, "Harry can you come up here for a moment we want to talk to you," he told him.
Sherlock thought for a moment, he knew that letting Harry go back to them was a bad idea and he didn't want him to end up some home. He looked at John, a silent question in his eyes as the other looked back at him. John gave a smile and a nod, knowing what the other was asking of him.
Sorry for the mistake in putting the chapter sixteen up and not fifteen. Please be on the lookout for chapter seventeen, I will be posting that sometime tonight.
Harry jumped up and went over to the window and looked out, Snuffles was there down on the pavement, tail wagging and looking up. He smiled and then it dropped as he looked towards the sofa. He frowned when he didn't see Sherlock, he hadn't even noticed the man leaving.
Harry sat up, Dudley watching him in fear and horror. Harry adjusted the glasses on his face and wiped away some blood that had come from a slight cut on his lip. He stood up, wincing in pain as he moved. He wanted his truck, but knew he wouldn't be able to carry it. His truck flew out of the cupboard from under the stairs as well as the things that he had hidden under the floorboards of his room. All of it flew towards him. He put them in his truck and took out the bag of money he had left over from Second Year. Harry tried to find that ball of energy to shrink his truck. He gave a trembling smile as it worked. He grabbed his wand from cupboard as well and put it away.
John nodded, a flash of something going through his eyes, "Yeah, and only until this case if over with. We have his previous guardians consent to find him a home. So he won't be going back to them," he told her.
Sherlock walked over to him and hugged him, "Come away and sit down," he told him as he pulled Harry away.
John nodded his head and said, "All right. I'm going back in and making sure that Sherlock doesn't upset him while he tells us what he knows."
"I don't know either, we have to get through to him that there is nothing for him to feel guilty about," John sighed as Sherlock walked into the room and sat down as well.
The dog whined and shook his head as he went a little closer and began to beg for a fuss. Harry chuckled a little, wincing at the pain in his chest that caused, but he stroked the dog gentle.
Lestrade rolled his eyes at her, "Yep, I'm going to get a cup of coffee, watch over him. He might be a little wary of you, so be warned."
Harry smiled to him and nodded, "thank you sir," he told him, grateful that he would be somewhat safe that night.
John and Sherlock shared a look, they could see that he didn't want them there, "All right, we'll go, but if you do need us for anything, come and get us," John told him as he got up from the edge of the bed and the two went to Sherlock's room.
"I thought you would like to know that you little talk on the lawn has stirred up quite a bit of gossip. My men have reported that they barely leave the house. Only going out when they need to. The boy, Dudley, is being watched by a number of parents now and has been caught by the police trying to graffiti the apparatus in the local park," he answered him, a smirk playing on his thin lips.
Marian straightened up and looked down her nose at Sherlock, "I presume to do so because I know what I am doing. I have been working for Social Services for over twenty years. It is you that has no idea of how to take care of a child," she snorted at him.
Sorry for the long wait. Been getting things sorted so I can start updating again. Laptop broke in November. Got it sorted in January, but things were going on. Hopefully I will be back to posting once a week!
Sherlock and John were in the living room. Neither of them had slept that well, even after turning in early. They had woken several times, each time they had gone upstairs to check on Harry, finding him asleep, but restless. Harry had been quiet for most of the morning. They didn't like the thought of leaving him alone but they had no choice. They had found a small lead on another case that they had been working on before being called in with Lestrade. They needed to track it down and make sure that they were hearing things right as it might mean an innocent man was being framed.
"He gave up hope of ever getting away because his so called family has made everyone believe he is a dangerous child, he was a toddler and people were thinking he was bad," John said in disgust.
John smiled, "I know, I'm still the same with them, half the time I do the wrong thing and Sherlock has to sort it out," he chuckled as Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he went over to the sofa and flopped down, "Yes," he snorted as he glared once more.
It took a good hour before Harry came back downstairs. Sherlock took him into the kitchen to work on a few experiments, nothing too gory, but still working with eyes. Sherlock couldn't help but be impressed with the way Harry had handled them. He wasn't squeamish about them, just like John wasn't. The first time he had brought out the eyes, Harry had pulled a face, but that was all. He was soon working beside Sherlock, who found it refreshing to have someone else that didn't run screaming when he worked on human remains.
"How do you think Harry is faring?" he wondered as he watched the teen sit with their landlady and talking quietly. John had always been the better person at judging emotions..
"I have no idea what I should do, social services need to be told," he said to the teen as he sat down at his desk.
Harry came out of the kitchen and was watching intently as he saw that John was having a nightmare, he knew the signs as he had seen them in the others boys on occasions. He looked at Sherlock who was calling out to John, telling him he was safe and that all was fine. Sherlock's calling didn't work as John yelled out, sweating, shaking and shot up on the sofa.
"Hmmm, shall have to remember that next time I kidnap someone," he joked, relaxing a bit more. He couldn't help but do so, John had that air around him.
"He witnessed a murder at the end of last month, he is staying with us because we can protect him," John answered as he came back in with the tea for the four of them, "The killer is after him, so everyone thought it would be the best solution."
"Please listen to him Mrs Hudson, I don't want you becoming ill or something because you didn't," Harry told her as he took one of her hands.
Thank you for the wonderful comments and the kudos, you guys are the best ever. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Sorry for taking so long in updating things. Life has been kicking me down for a while, and November was NaNo, which I had fun with.
Sorry for disappearing again. But the anniversary of my mothers passing came up and it hit me a lot harder than I thought it would do. I'm starting to get my head on right again, so I'm back.
They stayed for another half hour before John stood up, pulling Sherlock up as well, he turned and called out, "Harry, come on time to go home," he watched as the teen came running, Snuffles running beside him as they rushed over to them.
Hey all, sorry for not updating last week. I was on holiday and was able to visit Stonehenge, which was amazing!
"Harry, you have a killer after you that has now killed again," Sherlock began to explain, "I do not like the thought of you being here on your own, it could be dangerous for you."
Sherlock looked around the room, "he fought hard," he said as he looked at the disarray. He smiled a little as he saw the knife that had penned letters to the mantle was missing, "Oh well done Harry," he said as he noticed the knife on the floor and saw the blood on it, "Harry cut our dear killer, so far we've had no DNA on the scenes, this might change with this little bit, Mycroft can you get someone to test it?" he asked as he pointed to the knife.
I'm just focusing on a couple of stories and then moving on until they are finished if people read other fics that I haven't updated yet. So I will get around to them, so don't worry!
"I'm Harry, but please don't," he said as he began to explain what had happened, going through what he had seen in the alley, to the fact that he saw the man in the hospital and that he was looking for him, "I need to find them, to tell them that I saw him again," he finished softly.
"Then I'll make you some," John said with a shake of his head, he couldn't help but think that this would be normal for the kid, if he did it without even thinking.
Thank you for the brilliant kudos and awesome comments. So happy that you are enjoying this fic. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
"He wont say anything, he isn't even telling us his last name. We're having social services come in to talk with him later, but he will be in here for at least another day or two," he told him, "We only just about got his D.O.B out of him, as soon as he realised why we were asking all the questions he stopped answering."
"I'll just have a look around if you don't mind," the man nodded and quickly looked around the room and then left with a, "thanks for letting me look," tossed over his shoulder.
John nodded his head and with a steely look on his face marched back into the living room to join the others. Then he froze when the rush of words that came from the consulting detective's mouth registered in his head. "In-law?" he gawped. He turned around to ask Sherlock about what he had just heard but the man was already engrossed in conversation with his older sibling
"They've found a body, same motive as before. It's our friendly little killer," he said clenching a fist as he felt a thread of anger go through him at the thought of the man that had hurt Mrs Hudson and was trying to find Harry and harm him.
Harry yawned a little as he walked down the stairs in freshly washed clothes. Someone must have washed them last night after he had gone to bed and put them in his room. He had ended up wearing very large clothes to sleep in. Not that he cared, he was used to clothes never fitting right unless he was at Hogwarts. He walked into the kitchen and looked around. The kitchen was clean, though he knew that it hadn't been when he had gone to bed. He could hear the two men moving around and beginning to get up.
"Yesterday afternoon the killer went to the hospital to try and find him. Harry had the good sense to run and hide. Mike found him, the killer was going around saying he was looking for his brother. Mike knew he was lying and made sure Harry was hidden when he went into Mike's classroom to search. Called me after the man was gone and Harry came here with me," Lestrade told them quickly what had happened.
Harry looked to him his eyes a little fearful as he said, "Please, please can he stay, I know it's a bit of a bother…" he trailed off as John raised a hand to stop him.
They both smiled and the four of the left baker street and headed towards number four Privet Drive Little Whinging.
"How about we go out for a little while, though Snuffles will have to remain here," Sherlock suggested, looking to the dog that was lying loyally beside Harry's chair.
"No, please no, I can't. If I go there then he'll find me, he'll kill me, I know he will. He did it to the others as well," Harry said as he shook his head, begging the man not to call anyone to come and get him.
John smiled with how Harry was trying to keep it all together and not to show that he was scared. He guided over to the sofa and let him sit between himself and Sherlock. Mycroft looked at them and smiled as he pulled out his phone.
I know most of you are going FINALLY YOU UPDATED, so happy you stuck with me and I hope you will be with me when I cross that finish line as well.
Within a couple of minutes, the two were out of the door and Harry was on his own. Sherlock and John got in the cab and headed to the scene. They didn't like the fact that they had left Harry on his own, and both of them had a feeling they should have brought him with them, even though he would only be alone for ten minutes before Mycroft would get there.
Sherlock shook his head, "Don't need to," he said as he took one of the many slices of toast that Harry had made and began to nibble on it.
"I'm sorry but I haven't. I've been in here for most of the day and the door was locked before I got here," he said with a small smile.
"I know, he's gone now, must have when he saw you come up behind me," he said, with a sigh. Harry looked down to his hands and clenched them tightly, they were shaking. His knees felt wobbly as well.
Hey all, I am back after running off to spend a whole month to write. I wrote over 120k, finished four fics, and started three more.
The door to the room opened and the man walked in. Harry watched and waited for the best time and as soon as the man was near the bed. Harry made his move he slipped from the table and out of the still open door and began to run from the room. He went up stairs and through corridors. Not caring where he went as long as he could hide and get away from the man that was after him. Harry couldn't go no further after a while, his body protesting each and every movement. He slipped into one of the room, looking like a classroom. He chose one of the desks at the back and ducked under it and settled down, pulling the stools in front of him so he could remain hidden.
Thank you for your kind wishes and such. The October after mum passed away my grandmother passed as well. Both ladies were two that encouraged my writing. So it had been hard to go back to old things.
"But you don't want it to just be temporary do you?" she asked with a little smile on her face. When it came to matters of the heart, Molly was able to see a lot more.
Donovan walked in and frowned as she saw the hair and the coat on the sofa, she looked over to her superior and asked him, "What's going on?"
"Hi, have you seen a kid, black hair, rather messy," he said as he recalled the picture that the nurse had showed him, "My little brother has run off from his room again, wondering if he came to hide here?"
Lestrade took Harry from Bart's, not signing him out, as he didn't want a trail left behind that someone could trace. He had no clue as to what he should do, Harry was a witness, and it looked like the killer knew about him thanks to someone leaking that there was one to the papers that morning. Lestrade arrived at New Scotland Yard and led Harry to his office.
"I'm not their family and I don't consider them mine, to be honest with you. They are people that I had to live with and that was it," Harry replied bluntly.
John shook his head and Mycroft smiled , "you are good for him John, I always knew that from the moment I met you," he said to the man.
"True Sherlock," she smirked to him and then giggled, "oh my husband was a rotter, truly he was, Sherlock had him put away for murder, he was a little bastard."
"Oh you dear sweet boy," Mrs Hudson said as she hugged him tighter. She couldn't help but feel flattered and happy at the words, she had never had children, and only a niece from her sister to spoil. The closest she had got to children were John and Sherlock, and with Harry, to be called grandmother by him, it was wonderful.
"Really?" Harry asked perking up at that. He enjoyed spending time with the older man. Sherlock was interesting and took the time to explain things to him when he didn't understand.
Marian sneered as she read them. Not happy with what she was seeing. Harry watched her and then spoke up, "Why are you here now?"
It didn't take long for Harry to come up and for them all to be sat down. He didn't feel comfortable being with them all, but he just hoped that they would still have him for a little while longer, "What do you need?" he asked them all looking at each of the adults in turn.
Harry looked between the two of them as he ate the last of the egg and shook his head, "You don't need to do that," he told them.
I made a mistake and this should have been chapter 16 and not 15. Do look out for chapter 17 later on tonight.
Thank you all for the brilliant comments and kudos, you guys are so amazing! (Never ever forget that!)
Sherlock went into the living room, giving Snuffles as ruffle on his head as he stood near him and looked at John, who was sweating and moving around jerkily, "John," he called out, his voice soft and while he wanted to reach for him, he refrained.
"But I need to know John, we have a killer to find, he has already killed four people," he said as he looked to his friend who was checking the young teen over.
Lestrade sighed, "fine, I'll have something ordered in for us to eat, since I have a few things to finish before I can go home. I have a sofa that you can use I suppose, for the night at least."
"I'll show you quickly before we leave," Sherlock said as he stepped towards him and knelt down. He showed Harry how to use the phone, to get in touch with the two of them in case he needed anything. He stood up and said, "Don't worry, we will be back, and you can always send us a text. We will answer it if we are free to do so, a call to us means that you need us right away, understand?"
"Baker Street," was the simple answer as he asked the child, "When you have been seen to can you tell us all that you know of what happened?"
Mike laughed and shook his head, he sat and watched the two experiment at one of the benches, "They get along really well don't they?" he asked.
Sherlock nodded, "Yes, though now we have a last name, we might be able to find out what happened and how we can protect him from them. He has told us that he once told a teacher what was going on, but his aunt and uncle were able to make it seem like it was him that was causing the problem. He gave up trying to get away, he has…" he paused trying to find the right word.
"Hey Greg," John greeted and then noticed Harry sitting there, "Hello Harry," he greeted him, puzzled as to why he was there, "Why are you here?" he asked.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, so happy that people are enjoying reading this. I do hope have enjoyed this chapter as well.
John and Sherlock looked to Harry and the could see that he had been affected by what they had done. They gave each other a glance as John then got up and went over to him.
Sherlock smiled as Mrs Hudson began telling Harry about her husband and what he had done, Harry listing intently. He stood up and went past, place a hand on Harry's head for a moment before he followed John and sat down at the kitchen table.
The boy had barely moved from where he had laid down that night. Lestrade's large coat was covering him up and he could just about see the black mop of hair on his head. Lestrade gave a small chuckle, the messy hair reminded him a little of Sherlock. Though there was something in those expressive green eyes that caused him to pause, there was a hardness in them, even as he tried to beg and plead for things. Lestrade had been surprised when Harry hadn't had nightmares about what happened, he had expected to be startled by a scream at least once during the night.
