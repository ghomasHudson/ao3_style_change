"Oh, my goodness…" Was all Mrs. Barnes could say in response.
"It's not like I had much of a choice," he explained. "The Avengers twisted my hand. They attacked first. I can't let something like that go. So, yes, I had Brother Eduardo put the order for the attack forward."
The next half hour went by uneventfully. No one came in, no one left. The dullness of it all threatened to put Knežvić to sleep. In fact, he was certain that the girl had fallen asleep at the bar and was about to go shake her awake and throw her out when he heard a sudden bark of laughter come from her.
"Well, what
"I wasn't threatening physical harm!" Tony knew that, but he honestly just wanted to avoid the conversation. He already knew how it was going to end and he just couldn't take the heartbreak. Not right now.
For a moment, everything was still and silent, as if everyone were afraid that even the slightest movement or sound would set the shaking off again. After a bit of hesitancy, Rhodey got to his feet and Happy offered Pepper a hand up.
"I don't think this is the kind of thing you congratulate someone on." Despite trying to say the remark so quietly it was kept to himself, voices still tended to carry in that room and thus Clint heard him. He shook his head in disbelief.
"Twelve percent for my baby?" Pepper asked as she started to make her way over to the seating area.
Given that they were being kicked out there was no point in moving their luggage from one hotel to another and Tony was very vocal in his desire to leave D.C. as soon as possible, they decided to take their flight as planned. They packed everything up fast and headed to the airport. It was hectic, but they were all able to do it. Well, almost all of them. An absence noted as soon as they boarded the flight.
Thank you to the guest who left kudos on AO3 and mfaerie32 on FFN for the review! It really means a lot! :)
"My friend, Lara." Betty raised an eyebrow.
"Where's Banner?" he asked. "Has he shown up yet?"
"I know, I know," Tony said. "I don't need to be reminded for the billionth time today."
"Okay," he said. "See you in a few hours."
"Oh?" he said. "Why not? What could you possibly do to stop me?"
"I thought you were coming to kill me," she said plainly. "The best way to survive a mass shooting is to avoid the attacker, deny them access to your location, and – if it comes down to it – defend yourself. I couldn't avoid them, and I thought holding that door closed wouldn't last me long. The best option I had was to at least try and defend myself. That's what the Secret Service trained me to do and I was fully prepared to do it if Tony hadn't spoken up."
"Your attitude." Natasha raised an eyebrow.
"My… Friend lives here." Nina could feel the panic rising in her voice with every word. "Can you please just tell me if she's okay? I haven't heard from her in days." It wasn't unusual for Oswin to suddenly fall out of contact for a couple of days, but given the circumstances, it only gave Nina more cause for concern.
"Uh… Sleep, eat, shower… The basic stuff you need to do for survival?" Lara gave him a look of disbelief.
"Excuse me for this, Commander," she said. "But I do think it's relevant for me to point out that Captain Rogers has been heavily sedated. When he does wake up he'll be too groggy and weak to even get out of bed, let alone try and harm someone."
Once again, I want to stress that I don't intend for this break to be permanent. If I don't ever post again, assume I'm either dead or locked in Onision's basement. I will still be writing the entire time. I just want to get ahead of myself so I can be able to update regularly. I hope you all bear with me on this. I've already started Chapter Thirty if that makes anyone feel better and I hope to get as many chapters as I can under my belt before I return.
"Good," Steve said. "Now tell me what's going on in that genius mind of yours." The corners of Tony's lips raised upwards for a second before getting down to business.
Suddenly, the Hulk let out a great roar. It was so unexpected that Steve jumped a little bit. What was even more unexpected, though, was the sharp gasp of air coming from the lifeless body next to him. Steve's head whipped around, and blue eyes connected with brown. Tony was
He explained the Raël's plight as best he could. The frog-man listened intently, his gaze never leaving Tarquan's face. When he finished the story, the frog-man allowed a stark moment's pause to pass before speaking up in a heavily accented, croaking voice.
Well, not all the nightmares. At some point – Tony honestly didn't know when because he had finally lost all concept of time – Dr. Smith came into the room, noticeably without any protective gear on. Tony knew what that meant.
"Forcing your followers to fight your battles for you?" she questioned. "That's low."
. He couldn't. It was like they used cement as glue. Eventually, he saw opening the letter the traditional way wasn't going to work, so he flipped it vertically and tried to open it from the end. He could feel it had a little give, but he was having trouble ripping it with only his hands, so he tried using his teeth. With one good pull, the letter opened, sending white powder flying everywhere.
"No," Tony said. "I'm not even going to try to deal in valueless currency, so I'll just take the loss."
He was just finishing that up when Pepper took the phone away. Honestly, he was not so much worried about losing work as much as he was of her accidentally hitting something and calling Carol. He had a feeling that calling an intergalactic warrior had similar consequences to if you called the fire department and there was no fire; the only difference being that a lot more pain was involved. However, Pepper did not let him explain that as she just went ahead and unlocked the phone.
"I have some in the middle drawer of my dresser," Tony said. "Just go down the hall and it should be the last door on the left, right before the emergency stairs." Bruce nodded and gave a quick "thank you" before disappearing down the hall. Tony turned back to Steve, who looked at him with a bit of concern.
"Yes," he said slowly.
It wasn't hard to find where she lived. In the past twelve years, Lorraine Wilburn hadn't moved once. A dumb move on her part, given that she feared for her nieces' safety should they meet their formerly incarcerated father, but nonetheless Knežević was thankful that she made it. After all, it made finding Audrey and Stephanie
Tony's stomach twisted and tears started dripping from his eyes. As much as he hated it, he knew that it had to be true. Steve wouldn't scream at him like that if he loved him. Tony would be a fool to think otherwise. Maybe he'd been fooling himself all along, thinking him and Steve could work…
"Good to hear," Tony said. "Get in." Conroy's eyes were wide as she looked from Tony to the car, and back to Tony again. Clearly, she was trying to calculate the vehicle's total worth in her mind.
"No," Natasha said. She stopped on one page and her eyes started to scan it. "I did do that, but not for the reasons you two apparently think I did."
Stepping inside, Carol found herself in an enclosed foyer. Ahead of her was another set of double doors that presumably lead to the rest of the building. She couldn't tell for sure, though, because even though the doors were glass, she couldn't see through them. Someone had gone to the trouble of blacking them out. That raised her suspicions a bit more, but not enough to forego pretenses.
"That's the thing, Brother," Freeman said. "I didn't do anything." Adoniram's smile wavered.
The tapes had been circulating for about a month by this point. They still had not really reached wide-spread public knowledge, but the rumor mill was running hot. People spoke in hushed whispers about the possibility of Tony Stark being gay, but for the most part it was dismissed as hearsay. That would be, at least until the tapes reached them and they finally got proof for themselves. Then they would pass off the tapes to the other non-believers and the army of people who knew the truth grew. It eventually spread from place to place, city to city, friend circle to friend circle. However, it seemed the last people to know about it were the people closest to Tony Stark himself.
"So why don't you?" He shrugged.
Knežvić was confused by that until he looked up at the TV and saw that it had switched to the news. The reporter – who was identified as Jessa Abello by the news banner underneath her – stood in front of a Jared's Galleria of Jewelry that was surrounded by the flashing lights of police cars. He had to do a double take as his eyes flashed over to the laughing girl, then back to the TV.
Despite that, Lara found herself struggling with the problem as well. Every time she ran the numbers in her head, she came to what seemed like a correct answer, however, she couldn't help but feel like it was slightly off for some reason. She mulled over it before giving it up with a slight shrug.
"That's good," Tony said. "That reassures me a bit." Pepper frowned.
"Loki is manipulating you," Natasha said.
Another complication was the fact that he was still in the hospital. There was less than a minute between the cop leaving and a woman with long blonde hair walked into the room introducing herself as Dr. Holcomb. He was then forced to listen to the whole spiel about what his test results showed again. She did go into more detail about his condition and methods of treatment than Dr. Rawls did, which Tony considered being a good thing. Although, she did concede that the only treatment method available for a case as severe as his was a bone marrow transplant, which was complicated by the fact that he had no living relatives and one of the rarest blood types in the world. However, they did have the means to treat the ailments and get him back in relatively good health. They wanted to focus on that before they tackled the donor problem. After all, he needed to be in good health before they did the surgery.
"No thanks," he said. "I'll hold it and keep my dignity." The doctor frowned.
"Help me?" Oswin scoffed. "How? By scaring the crap out of my girlfriend again?"
Once they arrived at the hospital, Tony was quickly whisked off by several nurses to a private room on a mostly empty floor. Steve and Conroy were directed to a waiting room while Pepper followed Tony into his room. After Afghanistan and the whole Stane situation, Tony arranged things so that if he should get kidnapped/die/be rendered incapacitated in any way shape or form, Pepper and Rhodey had the legal authority to make decisions on his behalf. Currently, Rhodey was on a classified mission (something that seemed to be happening a lot in the weeks since he first donned the War Machine armor) so that left Pepper to be the de facto legal authority should something happen, or his illness became worse.
"What the fuck?"
"Good."
The other one? He got to see Steve dressed up in a suit. Now that was a sight to see. He kept it simple; black tie, black suit, white dress shirt, but even so Tony was having a hard time trying to resist how unbelievably attractive he was. If Tony could have his way, he'd throw Steve down on the table and start screwing his brains out right then and there. Unfortunately, there were such things as public decency laws, and he was pretty sure Romanoff would castrate him if he tried to do that while they were eating. So, he'd have to stick with taking long sips of his wine and replaying his fantasies in his head. It was truly a pity.
Even though she was clearly lucid and interacting with the environment, something in the tone of her voice sounded thousands of miles away, or – more appropriately – like it was left at the courthouse. Given that she had not shared what had happened with the protection order, it was pretty much spelled out that things had gone badly. Concerned, Bruce moved across the kitchen to sit down on the ground next to her.
"I mean I wouldn't tell anyone," Stark said. "Period."
We're now officially halfway through the year! That means we're only six months away from the blood bath that 2020 is sure to be! Crap...
supposed to do that." Recognizing all too well where these words were coming from, Clint forced himself to sit up and scooched to sit next to her.
"Come on," they said. "I just want to hug you."
"So, I'm not going crazy?"
"What time do you want me to show up tomorrow?" Lara asked.
"I know," Steve said. "And I'm proud of you." Tony's lips quirked upwards.
"Touch it," the frog-man implored. "Then you will know." Seeing that he had nothing to lose, Tarquan tentatively reached out a finger and did as the man said.
"Twelve percent?" Pepper raised an eyebrow.
"Yeah," Rhodey said. "JARVIS mentioned that, too. Why'd you take pills when you knew you were already intoxicated?" Tony could be an idiot when he was drunk sometimes, but he was not actually stupid enough to mix drugs like that. At least, that is what Rhodey hoped. To his relief, Tony was able to offer up some sort of explanation.
and her entire house shaking. Even though she had been living in LA for a few months, she had never experienced an earthquake of this magnitude before. Sure, the ground always gave little tremors from time to time, but this was a lot more than that. It had to be a 5.0 or higher. A big one, if you will.
This hadn't been what he had intended to do. He didn't even think escape was possible. He thought he would die getting sucked into the endless void of space. In fact, he'd been counting on it. This, however, was much better. At least he was still alive.
"Oswin." She wiped the remaining beer off her lips with the back of her hand.
Although, yes, Barton was possibly showing symptoms of both Ebola and H5N1, they couldn't be certain it was even those diseases he was suffering from, never mind if it came from the powder or not. If the powder ended up being inert, then it couldn't infect anyone. If that were the case, it could be a good sign. It could mean that Barton had something more common, less deadly, and more treatable; curable even.
"Seriously?" Lara nodded.
"Oui, Angelina Jolie essaie de tuer Brad Pitt maintenant," Lara rattled off to the phone. "Pourquoi? Je ne sais pas! Je pense qu'ils doivent s'entretuer maintenant qu'ils savent qu'ils sont des espions ou quoi que ce soit. Si vous cessez de poser des questions, je pourrais mieux vous expliquer le film." Lara looked up to see what was going on on-screen when she finally took notice of Pepper standing in the doorway with her hands on her hips. Lara's face blanched. "Hey, J.P., I'm going to have to call you back. Oui. Je t'aime aussi, mon frère. Au revoir." Lara hung up the phone and turned back to Pepper. "In my defense, Tony was the one who asked me to do this and he said to be completely honest with you when I tell you that he's doing an Iron Man thing and he's going to come right back once it's taken care of."
"Well, you shouldn't have pushed your luck." If looks could kill, both Lara and Everhart would have dropped dead from each other's glares. Tony finished unhooking his microphone and handed it back to the producer. He was about to walk out, but Everhart spoke up, causing Tony to freeze in front of the door.
"No," the concierge said. "It's against our policy. Come back when you have a badge and a search warrant."
"Then what's wrong?" Lara asked.
"No," he assured. "Nothing like that."
"Don't swallow it," Steve warned.
The movie they ended up watching was
"I don't know," he said.
"I only did that once," Tony said. "And that's only because I really couldn't sleep."
"Free food tastes better," Clint grumbled away as his only explanation.
"No. Thank you." Lara nodded again before turning to Pepper.
"I know, I know," she said. "But it's a long story and I'd need time to explain it all properly. Also, no offence, but none of you seem exactly comfortable right now."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stark Industries," she said automatically. "You've reached Tony Stark's office. This is Lara Conroy speaking. How may I help you?"
"I think I am," she commented. "I think for you, individualized therapy is probably the best place to start. Talking to someone about the underlying problems and figuring out better ways to cope will probably make things easier for you. Even if it doesn't it can still help to figure out how to map a way to go that works for you."
"Because of him," Fury finally relented, not taking his eyes off Bruce as he pointed at Thor.
"It's still an awkward formality," Salinas commented.
"And how do you know that?" Tony asked. The woman's face was tense as she looked him directly in the eyes.
"What do you mean?" It was clear in his voice that Steve already knew he wasn't going to like the answer.
"Pepper," he said. "I'm dying."
"Okay," Lara said carefully. "We were just coming to tell you that it was time to wake up…"
Tony did everything he could to keep himself from stamping his feet up the stairs like a petulant child. If he wasn't convinced that S.H.I.E.L.D. up to something, pulling him back out of the room before he even got a chance to talk to Steve did it. Either this wasn't the real Steve Rogers, or there was something else they didn't want him finding out. …Or he just had a headache and was being overly paranoid, but Tony didn't think that likely. This was S.H.I.E.L.D., the spy agency that doesn't let anyone know anything until it's convenient for them. Yes, he was still bitter over the whole waiting six months to tell him they had the solution to the palladium poisoning while he suffered and showed all the signs of someone who was considering suicide thing, but even if they hadn't pulled that, Tony would still be suspicious. He was suspicious of anyone who asked to access his private files. He had to be. After all, anyone who wanted access to his or his father's designs obviously had less-than good intentions.
"Brother Daniel?" she questioned. "As in Daniel Adoniram?" Carol didn't think it possible, but the woman's smile got wider as she nodded in confirmation.
"Oh my God." Tony squeezed his eyes shut and brought a hand to his head. "Please tell me you didn't scare yourself into thinking if people find out you're bi, you'll get thrown into an asylum." Steve didn't have anything to say to that. "Damn it, Steve, how many times do I have to say it before you get it through your thick skull. It's not 1945 anymore. We don't lock up people for being gay and we certainly don't perform lobotomies on anyone. I've been out of the closet for sixteen years and nothing…" Tony seemed to catch himself mid-thought. "Alright, bad stuff has happened, but I've never been
"So, they are in a relationship?"
Happy Labor Day to everyone in the US! I hope you at least have some way to celebrate considering everything that's going on.
"Alright, alright," Tony said. "Talk to you later."
"You can come with us to the hospital if you want." Steve raised his eyebrows.
"Yes," Clint said. "How did…?"
"Nothing!" Lara exchanged a glance with Steve. With a few subtle gestures she communicated what she wanted him to do, but Clint caught on easily. He was the king of subtle gestures, after all. He backed up against the door and gripped onto the knob tightly. "Oh, no," he said. "You can't get past me, I'll…"
Directly across the hall from Tony's corporate office was Pepper's office. Again, it occurred to him that he should probably talk to her and talk to her and it wasn't like he had an excuse not to. He could clearly see her sitting at her desk, intently focused on whatever she was working on. Tony's gut twisted uncertainty, but he still took a hesitant couple of steps to the door. He even brought a fist up to knock on the door but couldn't bring himself to go through with it. He just didn't have the emotional energy to do it. His hand hovered at the door for a moment before he brought it back down, sighed, and turned to walk back to the elevator.
Rhodey had made them breakfast that morning. Steve tried to insist that he was their guest and he didn't have to do that, but Rhodey was hearing none of it, which Tony was grateful for. (Mostly because he didn't have the heart to tell his boyfriend that no, he didn't want eggs
"Please," Lara said. "You've clearly got work to do and if I'm not here to assist you, well then I just wouldn't be doing my job now, would I?" Tony gave her a small smile in gratitude.
Clint sat on the couch next to her – the proper way. His eyes were glued to the screen of the flip phone in his hands. Based on the movements of his thumb across the keypad, she could easily guess that he was texting Laura. Usually, when they were out for work, Clint limited his contact with his wife. He didn't need to be distracted on a mission, after all, and conversely, he didn't need an enemy learning of his family's existence by tracing a phone signal. However, it was different this time. There were no missions to get distracted from or enemies to face. For once, they were working with the minimal need for cautiousness and secrecy.
"Good afternoon, Mr. Stark," she greeted as she walked in the room. "I'm Dr. Rawls, head of the emergency department here at West Hills Medical. What brings you here today?"
"Hi," she said. "My name is Lucy and I was wondering if you two would like to take a personality assessment."
"Look, I know what I said about Peggy telling me you're bi was upsetting…"
"Has anyone told you that you're too paranoid?" he asked.
"You can't!" Lara raised an eyebrow.
"Don't play dumb," Pepper said. "You know exactly what I'm talking about."
"Eat up," he said. "If you're still hungry, I can make more."
even existed. Thus, the minion that had labeled himself "Hawkeye" had assured his master they wouldn't be found. Despite the assurances, Loki remained on edge. He had pairs of the soldier-minions patrolling the corridors every few minutes under strict instructions to kill anyone unfamiliar on-sight. He couldn't have anyone disrupting the construction of the machine. If he didn't have that completed and the invasion of Earth taking place on time, well, he didn't want to imagine what would happen to him.
"To be completely fair, sir, you don't need to." Fair scoffed.
"…That what?" Natasha looked down. "Natasha, what are you afraid of?" Slowly, she gained the courage to look him in the eye.
, so that's what she picked. No one objected or even really minded, which was good. Rhodey even made the effort to pull Carol into their conversations, which she clearly appreciated.
"Wait, are you filling out my information on that form?" Steve raised an eyebrow. "Isn't that supposed to be for Tony?"
has manners." Tony must be mistaken because he could have sworn, he saw Fury roll his eye."
After learning that the man who stole the Tesseract, Loki, was putting on a scene in Germany, Natasha Romanoff (a.k.a. the Black Widow), Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America), and Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) rushed out there to capture him. Loki gave up easily. ...A little too easily, but that doesn't matter at the moment as another Asgardian has appeared and just as quickly disappeared, taking Loki with him. Whether he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract is lost. Tony quickly takes off after the rouge Asgardian with Steve hot on his heels...
"It was a witch hunt," Tony outright stated. "The girl interviewing me had an agenda. She went off script and pulled out all the stops."
"Well, no…" The guy said. "It's just… It's such a tight outfit…" Romanoff didn't let him finish whatever he was saying.
To her credit, Carol was very careful with Stark. She didn't hold him too tightly or fly too high. She even kept her pace slow in order not to jostle him too much (and to make sure Jessica could keep up.) That was impressive considering her strength and Stark remained unconscious for the entire ordeal.
"What?" he found himself saying at the same time as Pepper. Looking over at the redheaded woman – who was now sitting in the driver's seat of the car – Steve could tell that she was assessing him the same way an animal would a predator or a threat. He didn't blame her. For all she knew, he was the one that made Tony sick.
"I'm going to get another drink." Tony felt surprised at how off-balance he was as he stood up. Hopefully, the others didn't notice. "Does anyone want anything?"
Rhodey continues the story of how Tony was outed to the public.
The number one thing that he should have been thinking was
"Okay," he said. "I'm calm. I can think clearly now."
"They stayed overnight?" Tony questioned.
"I can't tell you." Tony smiled and lifted his glass to his lips. "It'll ruin the surprise," he said before taking a sip.
"Alright," she said. "I better get to work. I'll start looking for furniture later today."
"It is with a hung head and a heavy heart that I make this announcement," he said. "The past twenty years I have spent as a loyal employee of Stark Industries have been some of the best of my life. However, despite my dedication, I find that I can no longer stand by the actions of this company or by the actions of its owner, Mr. Anthony Stark."
Trouble doesn't even begin to cover the half of it.
are the one who was lurking around
"I just want to get it over with," she said. "The sooner it's done, the sooner I can get him away from me, and honestly I can't wait for that."
"I had all of my father's files digitized ages ago," he explained. "If you give me some search parameters, I can have JARVIS search my private database for it."
"Knežević." Irritation played out clearly on both their faces.
"Is that all he told you?" Romanoff raised an eyebrow.
"Has anyone ever told you you're a jerk?"
"Missionary?" Barton questioned.
"Of course," Steve said. "But not until I get a chance to repay you, first." The excitement rushed through Tony's body at a break-neck speed.
"Mister Speaker," the House Sergeant at Arms said. "The President of the United States!"
"Sorry, Agent Romanoff," Tony said. "But neither you nor S.H.I.E.L.D. has the authority to order me to do anything."
"Uh…" A nervous voice broke through their little bubble and Tony pulled back from Steve a bit. He didn't let go of his hand, though, as he turned to face Bruce who had returned to his normal form and was using a throw pillow to cover himself. "I'd hate to break up the moment, but can someone tell me where I can find some pants?"
"How long has it been?" Freeman asked the person on the other end of the call. The other person probably said that they didn't know. "Well, I got off the phone with you fifteen minutes ago. Have you looked for him?" A pause. "Alright, I'm on my way over there." Another pause. "No." Pause. "Because if we bring him in, it's not going to look good." Pause. "Just think about it." Freeman sarcastically nodded. "Yeah, exactly. Listen, just send the workers out to search for him. He's probably still somewhere on your property. If you don't find him by the time I get there, I'll call the RCMP…"
"That she did," Tony said. "She always did." Steve hummed in agreement and things went silent for a moment. Glancing over at the alarm clock on the bedside table, Tony could see it was 9:15. "Well, I have fifteen minutes until Nurse Buzzkill comes back to make sure I actually get some rest-"
Tony opened his eyes. The brightness of the room instantly made him snap them back shut. He groaned and reached out for Steve. He found the space Steve normally occupied empty and frowned. It wasn't even warm, meaning Steve hadn't been there in a long while if he had been there at all. He got his hopes up when he heard someone step into the room, but they were dashed when the person spoke up.
Steve didn't realize he had fallen asleep until he started coming to. He groaned and rubbed his neck. He had been leaning against the wall all night. Obviously, that wasn't the best position to be in. He was trying to massage his vertebra when he heard the noise that woke him up. Someone was knocking on the door.
"What was it?" Cooper asked.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to fall asleep at all." Tony shrugged.
Tony stayed in the bathroom for a long time after he finished throwing up because he was afraid that if he left, round four would sneak upon him. Steve stayed nearby, ready to jump in and help Tony if he showed any signs of distress. Eventually, Romanoff came over with a plastic bowl she found somewhere. It wasn't that big and could hold maybe one round of vomiting, but hopefully, that's all they would need it to do until Tony could make it to the bathroom. She handed it to Steve, who gave it to Tony, who took it with a dry, scratchy "thank you." They then proceeded back to their seats, where Tony had been sitting ever since.
Unfortunately, Dante wasn't willing to let her go so easily. He followed her out into the hallway and grabbed her wrist at the top of the stairs. Instinctively, Lara pulled her wrist back and struck him across the face,
That brought him to the next question. Was he afraid to love Tony? No, absolutely not. Was he afraid telling Tony that he loved him? Yes, most certainly. Although, yeah, technically what Tony needed to hear right now was that he was loved and supported, Steve still was not sure
"I'll take that as an okay for round two," Steve said as he started to lean in again.
"Okay."
Back in the moment, Steve was finding it very hard to mask his worry and concern. He knew that a 106-degree fever was bad. As sickly as he had been before the serum, he had never surpassed 104.8 degrees. However, he had heard from his mother numerous times as she nursed him back to health that it was dangerous to mess around with a fever that high.
"I still don't see how that can devolve into this sort of catastrophic mess," she said. "I mean, I get it. I have days when I am loaded down with paperwork, too, but this? Come on." Tony sighed.
"I guess," he said.
"It's alright," she assured. "I'm fine now."
"That was the plan," Loki remarked.
Freeman, though, was a different case entirely. He knew where Tony was when he was missing and didn't tell the other Avengers or notify the police. That had to be illegal, never mind being grounds for terminating his position. It was inexcusable and impossible to ignore. Something had to happen about it.
"Because I did a really good job in school and Miss Riley wrote on my report card that I'm a delight to have in class." Clint raised his eyebrows.
"It's the difference between life and death."
"Classified?" Lara questioned.
Remember kids, don't do drugs.
"Really?" she asked. "You think I'm that incompetent with tech?"
"Charlie-Tango-Alfa-Niner to the Hub. Do you still read me? Over."
security system. I would think that the FBI would want to ensure that she has no opportunity to escape whatsoever."
Thank you to IRllyHrtStny_75 for leaving kudos on AO3! It really means a lot!
was supposed to be their savior, not them. So as soon as he could, Adoniram did and said anything he could to vilify the Avengers.
"It got you to smile, didn't it?" Tony nodded, but slowly the smile started to fade from his lips. "Alright, if you don't have a fever, what's wrong? Headache?"
"Sorry," she said. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
"You're not," Bruce assured. "You're not."
"Can you bring up the surveillance footage of the front doors starting at around the time Stark leaves frame?" The concierge nodded, closing the media player before setting off on another search through the File Explorer. Meanwhile, Bruce looked over at Natasha.
"Understandable," Steve said.
"Stevie Nicks, Jimi Hendrix, Truman Capote…"
"Yeah, yeah," Rhodey said. "Keep giving the same old excuses. All that's going to happen is the night nurse will take your phone again." Tony rolled his eyes and Rhodey laughed in amusement. "See you tomorrow, man."
"I've been awake all night." Unsurprised by the admission, Tony leaned in to wrap his arms around Steve and pressed his forehead to chest.
"Leave," Lara clarified. "Now."
Out of everything Tony expected his last moments to be like, he never expected himself to be so at peace with dying. He'd been fighting to stave off death for so long (save for that admittedly slightly-suicidal period when he was dying from palladium poisoning) he'd never thought he would just give up, but he was. The world needed him to make this sacrifice and he was ready and willing to make it.
Tony forced himself to nod. In all honesty, he didn't want Pepper (or, rather, the company) suing the hotel and the police. In fact, he still didn't believe that he hadn't done anything wrong. He probably did something off-camera that he didn't remember and that instigated that sort of response from both the hotel and the police. After all, he was wasted beyond all reason at the time. It wouldn't be that crazy to assume…
She didn't think Steve had gotten any sleep either. Although she had gotten him to stop pacing and calm down a bit, that didn't erase all the underlying anxiety. They had tried to play games to pass the time, but given that Steve didn't know much about pop culture and there wasn't a deck of cards to be found, they were stuck playing "Guess What Number I'm Thinking Of." That game eventually petered out and both had decided to call it a night (or afternoon. It was hard to determine the passage of time when you were in a place without clocks or sunlight.)
"I just assume S.H.I.E.L.D. knows every personal and private detail about my life." Clint sighed.
"Oh… Okay, sir!" It was clear that the operator was having a hard time not sounding starstruck. "I'll notify all responding officers and get you in contact with the chief of police. Is there anything else we should be aware of?"
Second, he couldn't be around anyone that was sick. Again, his body was still recovering, and his immune system was substantially weakened. He was in no state to be fighting off viral infections and if Clint got sick, the consequences ranged from a bout of pneumonia to death. So, visitors were going to have to be regulated. The good thing was that since he was on bed rest, he wouldn't be out in the public, so that wouldn't be too hard to accomplish. The most that needed to be done was that everyone would have to wash their hands before they interacted with him and not to go near him if they were sick, which was no big deal.
"Fine," he manages to say, but he knows Steve doesn't believe it. Still, he keeps his hands-off Tony and lets him try to catch his breath. Tony closes his eyes and tries to focus on breathing and not crying.
"Tu pars," she said as she opened the door.
"No, not at all," Tony said. "But it's worth a shot, and if it doesn't work out we can figure out a way to Shashank you out of there."
"Well, you went somewhere most of us couldn't follow you," Bruce amended.
"No," he said. "Don't take me back. I don't want to deal with Howard."
If Tony had, to be honest, he thought S.H.I.E.L.D. was overblowing the danger "Steve Rogers" presented to him. Yes, the guy could probably lift a car over his head without breaking a sweat, but that didn't automatically mean he was going to go on a rampage and kill everyone. Though, he had to cut them some slack. The Harlem incident was still fresh in everyone's minds. It made sense why they were being so cautious.
"Do you need help?" Before Tony could answer her, Steve was at his bedside offering him a hand. Tony took it and Steve helped him pull himself up. He situated his arm around Tony's shoulders much like he did the night before and Tony turned his head to smile at him.
"Yes," Tony said. "I'm sure Carol appreciates the warm welcome, don't you?"
"What's going on?" She asked as she pushed Lara to sit down in an empty chair. "Tony's house was broken into?"
"Plenty," Tony said.
"Jesus, Romanoff," Tony remarked. "Your ability to dig up information on people is uncanny." She shrugged.
"That's not how this is supposed to work," Tony said before he could think better of it, causing Dr. Cranston to raise an eyebrow.
"Alright," she said. "Is there anything I can do to help?" Pepper raised her eyebrows and began searching through her purse. She pulled out a navy-colored book with the numbers "2012" embossed in gold and several pages that were already worn.
"A bit," Tony said. "It's just… I don't know."
"That redheaded woman, Pepper," Steve said as he looked Tony in the eye. "She wouldn't reveal something private about somebody else if she figured it out for herself, would she?" Tony's brow furrowed.
"Don't worry," Natasha said. "It's nothing you can't fix." Natasha walked past Tony, turning on a light that was attached to the gauntlets on her wrist. He and Steve followed her as she stepped inside the house. "Wow must have been some party."
"Why not?" Steve gave Rhodes a confused look, wondering why he could not see the obvious.
"Yeah," Bruce said. "Just a friend, though, is all."
"I deserve credit for the blow job you gave me which helped you sleep last night?" A half-smile, half-smirk graced Steve's face as he said that.
"No, you're not," he said. "Especially considering you're not supposed to be here. What are you doing, Romanoff?" She pushed back a loose strand of red hair and sighed.
…" He took a breath. "Honestly, I have no idea how I deal with it. It is always there in the back of my mind and I cannot mute it. It is just something that is always there, reminding me of the consequences of fucking up. The thing is, if you listen to it too much, it usually ends up causing you to fuck up. The best you can do most of the time is just try."
"I think Steve's the one you owe that last apology to."
"JARVIS, log in to my private database and pull up all files related to 'SSR Project: Rebirth.'"
"Just hear me out…"
about it," Rhodes corrected. "There's a big difference. Everyone already knows about it."
Remember kids, love is not a choice!
"She could handle you though, right?" Once again, Tony knew better than to answer that question. "Exactly. Besides, 'Natalie Rushman' didn't technically exist, so I never appointed her as my replacement."
"We from Gaza," the man said in heavily accented English. "Palestine. This normal." Tony made sure to give them an extra big tip after that.
"Yup," Tony managed to say. "Just feels like a full-blown rave is going on in my skull. I'm fine."
"We know," Tony assured. "We just want to keep it to ourselves, for now, right?"
Just a few small notes before I finish off the chapter; the people who texted Lara with the last name DuBois were her younger foster brother (Vick; the one who lives in Nyack), older half-brother (JP; the one who lives in France), and foster mother (Vanessa; not the one who abused her. That was her biological mother.) DuBois is Lara's maiden name and I don't remember if I've stated that or not in this story. So, yeah, this is probably the worst way to introduce characters into a story, but I think this is going to be the only appearance her older brother and foster mother are going to make. Her younger brother is going to appear in person at some point, but I can't say how or why. Spoilers...
"I'm fine," he assured. "You're not."
"Tony," Steve said into his communicator. "We got him."
That little bit of satisfaction Tony had felt, though, died as soon as he heard mechanical
"I…" Tony couldn't defend himself. That would be a lie. He couldn't say that he didn't continuously question why Steve was even with him, and he couldn't say that he never had suicidal thoughts before. Most importantly of all, he couldn't lie to Steve like that. So, he stayed silent.
"Lara." Rhodes rolled his eyes.
Steve thought. He wanted to feel around for a blanket to pull over himself but found that he couldn't move his arms. He couldn't even
One ring…
Bruce's only response was to point behind her. Turning around, she could see the S.H.I.E.L.D. Commander approaching them. Her skin was pale, and her cheeks were red from the cold, but it did nothing to detract look on her face. Lara and Bruce stood to greet her, but before either of them could get a word in, Hill got right down to business.
Lara was clearly upset about something. Whether or not it had anything to do with the topic at hand, Tony couldn't be sure. He just knew the first time he saw her after breakfast that something was off. She had her hair tied up in an extremely tight bun that looked like it hurt, and she kept her gaze hard, no matter who or what she was looking at. As the meeting went on, Tony did notice that her hand kept drifting to the pocket of her messenger bag where she usually kept her personal cell phone. That eventually led him to the conclusion that it was something having to do with her ex. Once he figured that out, he felt the pulsing in his temple increase. He just hoped it didn't come to affect the workday. As much as he liked Lara, he didn't need her ex coming in to threaten her and cause problems. They already had enough problems to sift through. No one needed that.
"I'm sorry I said that to you," Tony said. "That was wrong, and I shouldn't have said it." Lara shrugged.
"Can you even remember the last time you slept?" Tony frowned.
"What the hell?" She freed her arm from his grasp and stumbled backward, however it was too late. The process had already begun. Directly in the spot where Knežević had touched her arm, a pale-yellow stone had appeared. It quickly began to spread, consuming her wrist and hand, and moving up her arm at a remarkable speed. She screamed, but it was pointless. She was the only one on duty and there were no customers. No one could hear her, and no one could help her.
"Well," Freeman's voice wavered. "As I said before, it would provide a benefit to our recruitment numbers…"
Thank you to mfaerie32 on FFN for the review! It really means a lot! :)
"That's good to know," Tony said. "But are you okay?"
So, he had no idea what was going on anymore. For all he knew, Barton could be dead by now. He kept glancing down the hall he had come from, hoping that he would see Dr. Smith or at least a nurse that he recognized coming down the hall to give him an update, but he had no such luck. Eventually, he got impatient and got up. If he was going to be forced to sit around and wait for information that would probably never come, he might as well do it on a full stomach.
"There's still a chance that his son still has access to the files," Coulson suggested. "It's worth a shot." Fury nodded in agreement.
Natasha walked back into the room carrying both boxes easily (to Lara's annoyance.) She set them both down on the kitchen table, opened one, took a paper out, and examined it.
"You get that, J?" Tony whispered into his phone.
"A dollar and a quarter?" Clint repeated. "Wow, the tooth fairy must have been feeling pretty generous." Laura nodded.
"Yeah," she said. "I saw him out in the waiting room on the way here. He looked a little freaked out to me for some reason. Something happen?"
"I know," he said. "We're just stalling the inevitable." Lara walked over to the door, her hand on the knob.
"The elevator," Natasha said. "Around 12:45 AM." The concierge nodded and clicked through a few more files before bringing up Windows Media Player. He queued up the video to the indicated time and let it play.
"From what I've heard, Tony couldn't have been stopped any other way," Steve pointed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You don't need to apologize," he assured. "We all failed him there. Besides, you also need to know that it's not going to be that way for you when you come out."
"That's my secret, Captain," he remarked. "I'm always angry." With that he turned back around, his pallor complexion turning a monstrous green and his physical form increasing to at least three times his size. As the sky-whale scraped across the pavement towards them, the Hulk smashed his fist directly into the creature's forehead, causing it to flip in the air as it halted in its destructive path.
"That's it," Natasha assured.
"Oh good," she said. "So, it was a compliment, then."
"It makes you look weak," Freeman said. "Untrustworthy; undependable. That is the last image the American public needs to have of the Avengers right now. Not attending the State of the Union will only solidify that image in their minds. Do you want that?"
"Just do it," was all Lara said before she left the room.
"And there can't be many places in Newark that check off those other two boxes," Bruce said.
"I would," Tony said. "If the idea of eating didn't make me sick." Steve's eyebrows raised in alarm and he searched the room for an empty bowl or a bucket.
"That's not true," Knežević asserted. "Your mother's death was an accident."
Steve and Tony were separated once they were taken to be debriefed, as was everyone else. It was standard procedure, but Steve couldn't help but be a little miffed by it, especially when there was something clearly wrong with Tony. Steve could tell that he wasn't being honest when he said he was alright. Earlier when they were kissing, it felt like Tony was shaking in his arms. Given the brutality of the battle and the fact that Tony had a "minor" hysterical break earlier, Steve couldn't help but think he wasn't coping with any of this well emotionally and considering that Tony almost died… Well, Steve could attest first-hand that almost dying did a number on your emotions, and he could only imagine how Tony was internally reacting to it.
"I don't know," he admitted with a sigh. "For now it's probably just best not to have it around. I'm not sure… I don't think I can commit to anything yet."
"Well, duh." Clint tapped the side of his head in a sort of "I should have known that," gesture. Laura laughed. "I love you, babe."
"Excuse me, ma'am," she said. "Are you Winnifred Oswald?"
By the end of it, though, he still didn't know what was wrong with him. Dr. Wayne and the nurses with no explanation or even the slightest indication as to what was ailing him. In a way, that was distressing, but in the end, it was what he had wanted all along. As he had thought to himself earlier, Laura and the kids didn't know, so he wasn't going to know either. Although now he might be finding it at lease somewhat frustrating, it was still fair. The rest of the situation, however, was becoming less so.
"Alright," he said. "I'll talk to him about it when he wakes up."
"I'm not mad about that," Tony said. "I'm not mad at you for anything right now. I just want to know what the hell's going on."
"So, if you don't get the footage, does that mean you can't find Tony?" Steve asked. Natasha shook her head.
Dr. Holcomb then left the room and a short while after her promise was delivered upon when an exhausted-looking nurse came to switch out the mask. He quietly thanked her when she finished, and once she was gone he was left alone with his thoughts. The biggest one after I'm never coming to this hospital again was where's Steve?
"These rules are discriminatory," Tony protested.
"Snake trails don't lie." Romanoff slipped a bunch of papers clipped together from the inside of her vest. She inconspicuously passed them to Fury who hid them inside of his coat.
"Sold." Steve put three Benjamins he had retrieved from Tony's wallet down on the counter. The concierge quickly scooped them up and tucked them into his blazer's inner pocket. Natasha looked at him, wide-eyed with disbelief.
"Then I won't," Steve said. "I'm not going to leave you like this. I never will." With that, the dam broke. Tony got as close to Steve as the layers of blankets would allow and buried his face in his shoulder. The sobs came out at a rapid rate.
"Nat, what are you doing? We need to get a move on! Let's go!" Natasha held Clint's gaze for a few more seconds before she relented and sighed.
the Other would say as he inflicted another integration method upon him.
Yeah, some of this is so ideologically sensitive that I worried about whether or not I should change this from a T to an M, but this isn't the entire fic and I don't want people thinking that this is porn, so...
"Banner?" Obviously, that was a no.
"Are you sure about that?" Director Fury asked.
"Tony Stark." Steve's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Name ring any bells?" It did, but he wasn't sure how. For some reason, his mind was foggy, and his memory was cloudy.
"Did you complete the intake forums?" Tony's eyes went right to Rhodey.
"Are you okay?" he asked. "How long have you been sick for?"
"Yes."
"Alright," she said. "I'll be there as soon as I finish this."
"Okay," she said. "Thank you for letting me do what I needed to do, and for hearing me out." To her surprise, Stark offered her a small, bitter-sweet smile.
"Off the record?"
"Then what's the problem?" Clint shrugged.
"She's not my girlfriend," Clint said firmly.
"I'm not in," Tony said as the helmet was removed from his face. "I'm actually out."
"I didn't call you," Steve said when no apparent reasoning for the agent's appearance could be found.
"No problem," Tony said. "We just wanted to have a look around. We don't mind."
"And what exactly would that have changed?" Lara frowned.
"And we worked together on reviving Project: Rebirth."
"Absolutely nothing," she said. "The hotel called the police to break up a wild party and you somehow got caught up in the confusion. They threw you out by mistake."
Stark fell silent. Clint couldn't blame him for that, though. Everything he did was quite repugnant, especially when you added opening the letter to that list. Eventually, Stark did speak up, and what he said surprised Clint.
"I must have… …Come into contact… …With the venom… When I dropped… The Vial…"
"Sorry." Steve gave him a confused look until Tony gestured to the mark in question.
"Yes, rip my heart out," he said. "That's exactly what I need right now."
Tony's eyes fluttered open, revealing them to be red and glassy. Steve forgot to breathe for a second and not in a good way.
However, as the Church's membership grew, so did the crowds that came to attend the memorial services. Eventually, it became unfeasible to continue holding services on the sidewalk without obstructing pedestrian traffic so instead, they started gathering inside the tower itself. That worked out perfectly for Tony.
"Lucky you," the other woman said. "Unfortunately, this isn't my first time taking out the trash."
"Oh, it was just terrible!" Steve could see his mother lift a napkin to her face to wipe away a few tears. "I could barely believe it myself! It was the most horrific thing I have ever seen! There were more patients than beds! Children were covered in filth! It was just…" she broke down into a fit of sobs. Mrs. Barnes put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
"He wouldn't hide," Steve dismissed.
"Thanks," Tony said, looking at Steve and smiling. Steve didn't get why he kept doing that, but he wouldn't deny that he enjoyed it. Tony looked good when he was smiling, even as pale, sweaty, and weak as he was now.
"You know," Lara said, her voice growing tinier with every word. "Like with Betty?"
"I'll explain later," Tony said. "Trust me, Steve's a good person, but for right now can we focus on getting to the hospital?" Pepper put her hands on the steering wheel and took a deep breath in and out.
"Even Cap?"
Which was in fact, true. After days of suffering through the detoxification process, Tony's symptoms had seemingly subsided. He never went into a seizure (which was a miracle) but the affects still weren't pleasant to go through; nausea and vomiting; chills and aches; fevers and delusions… It was as far from a walk in the park as one could get and for as long as he lived, Tony never wanted to go through it again.
"You look well," she commented.
"Just come along," the agent said. "Don't make this harder than it has to be."
(See the end of the chapter for
He was about halfway through another boring, dismal night when a woman walked in. She looked no older than twenty and had her hair cut in a short, brown bob. Knežević quickly concluded that she had already had quite a bit to drink, considering she was deliriously giggling and very uncoordinated. He waited a few minutes for her to manage to get up onto her barstool before going over to take her order.
"Thank you," Lara said sincerely.
"Good morning," he said again.
The masked person on onscreen said something, but the audio was so distorted that it could not be clearly made out. By Rhodey's guess, he was trying to figure out if the camera was recording, as he immediately turned it away from his face and pointed it down at the carpeted floor below him. The man made another distorted remark – probably getting confirmation that yes, it was recording – before stepping up on to a bed.
"See you later," Tony reciprocated as Pepper left the room. At the same time, Conroy shut her laptop.
"Go upstairs," she said. "Get to bed. I've got things handled here."
"No," both Clint and Natasha said.
"Hi," she said. "My name is Regina and my question is for Tony Stark."
"First of all, it's Clint," he said. "Secondly, the dog's a 'he', not an 'it.' Third, can you really stay mad at this face?" He held up the puppy, who seemed to know that he needed to put the charm on. The dog looked up at Stark with the widest, most pleading brown eyes and despite his annoyance with the animal's mere existence, his expression began to waver. Frowning, he sighed.
"Yes," Tony said. "Charge them, please. I'm sick of this."
"He's still alive, but his blood pressure is starting to drop." Natasha nodded slowly.
Unscrewing the cap, Tony started to chug it all down at once. He knew it wasn't a good idea to drink mouthwash, but he could feel himself starting to sober up and he couldn't lose that buzz. It wasn't until he had finished the bottle that he saw the two most accursed words on the planet written on it:
"No," she murmured. "It is what it is. At least I can get the police to help me if he comes near me now."
"Yeah, I got that," Tony remarked. He lowered his gaze to one of the balconies and saw Loki standing there with his head held high. "Plan B."
"Sir," the AI said. "Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line." Tony rolled his eyes. Of course S.H.I.E.L.D. would call now of all times.
"Yup," Lara said, popping the "p." Pepper gave him a hard look.
"Because the water you drank was poisoned. You'll be dead in fifteen minutes."
"What do you mean?"
"You sure you're okay?" Tony nodded.
"My name is Natasha Romanoff," she said with an easy, crowd-pleasing smile. "I'm also known as the Black Widow, and detail about myself would be my favorite kind of sandwich is peanut butter. No Fluff, no jelly, just straight peanut butter on bread." The crowd gave another little chuckle, then it was Steve's turn.
"Well, Barton, it would be nice if you told someone that you still had a dog in
"You could have," Steve said. "But I need to know." Natasha stared at him for a moment longer before slowly nodding.
"So, is that all that went wrong?"
Yes, another OC-centered chapter, but at least you got to see a bit of Steve and Tony! Plus, the next chapter is from Tony, Natasha, and Steve's perspectives so that makes this better, right? Right?
"I thought you said he was in bed with someone?"
"Hey," she said. "Do you need anything else?" Tony quickly shook his head. Natasha, catching on to his wariness, sighed. "You think I'm mad at you, don't you?" Tony gave her a "well, duh" look. "Well, I'll tell you this; I'm not happy, but I'm not mad either. I'm sorry. I picked the wrong time and place to press the issue I shouldn't have confronted you the way I did. Can you forgive me?"
Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy all exchanged looks. Steve could sense a silent conversation was being held. They wanted to help him, but there was a hesitance to find out more. They obviously had some idea of the arcane mental health practices of his time, but they couldn't be sure they wanted to know the true extent of it. Luckily, Steve had mercy.
"You don't understand," Clint breathed. His entire body felt horrible. Whatever Loki did to him, it clearly didn't have a pleasant aftermath. He couldn't think of one part of his body that didn't hurt, even in places where he hadn't been hit. He would put money on the idea that all his muscles were striking in solidarity with his brain, eyes, throat, ears, and heart. "Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in?"
"Good point," he said. "So, you ready to see more of it?"
"We don't know," Pepper started to say.
"Well, I haven't gotten word from S.H.I.E.L.D. yet. I know we shouldn't say anything without their go-ahead." Pepper looked right at Morse, who nodded in confirmation to that. Freeman didn't notice, though.
Loki groaned as he hit the ground. For the most part, he was okay. It just knocked the wind right out of him. Still, Thor didn't have to throw him
"Yeah." Steve rubbed at the nape of his neck. "I'm fine." Tony's eyes narrowed, and his brow creased, but he nodded, accepting the answer anyways.
"You're fine, Miss Potts," DeMarcus said. "That was more directed to Mr. Stark and Miss Conroy."
"I think that goes without saying," Natasha said.
. That said something to Steve; absolutely avoid getting committed to an asylum at all costs. So, he did everything he could to protect the fact that he was bisexual. He didn't tell anyone, not even his best friend Bucky. The only person who he ever willingly revealed it to was Peggy, and that was only because had been in love with her and trusted her implicitly. (Which for the most part his trust was well-placed. The only person she had told was Tony, and that was long after he'd been frozen in the ice, and he'd come to accept her reasoning behind that betrayal.) Other than that, no one knew. It was safer that way.
"Do you think you should go in there?" Steve reached for the knob and found it to be unlocked. That should have been a relief, but all it did was stir up concern in the pit of his stomach.
What Tarquan didn't know was that shortly after the escape pod disembarked from the main craft, an unforeseen electrical issue had sparked a fire. Given that the pod's systems vented in pure oxygen into its main chamber, it didn't take long for the fire to spread. It took only moments for the pod's occupants to be engulfed in flames, completely making the men's sacrifice pointless. It only took a few minutes for the Raël to be completely erased from the universe.
Despite its large size, the room became steamy rather fast and moisture clung to about every surface. The room smelled strongly of disinfectant and though the anti-bacterial soaps they had to use claimed to be "scent-free" there was a very distinct smell that stuck to all of them after use. Tony, Clint, and Natasha unanimously agreed that it was "old-person smell" while Steve had no idea what they were talking about.
"…sure, that's a good idea?" Bruce pieced together what the voice said. The door dampened the sound enough to where they could barely be heard clearly. It also didn't help that they were whispering. "I mean, you don't know what his reaction is going to be."
Tony curled his toes and straightened them again. The cold slush that lined the street made them feel like they were on fire. It was starting to occur to him that it was probably dangerous to be out there. He didn't know what the air temperature was, but he could safely assume that it was somewhere near freezing with a windchill that was making it ten times worse. The smart idea would be to get inside and warm himself up ASAP, but he had nowhere to go. He had no idea where the hotel was and no way to get back to it otherwise as he had no cash. Plus, the area he wound up it appeared to be largely residential. There were no businesses or public buildings to speak of and it wasn't like Tony could go knocking on people's doors, begging to be let inside. As far as they knew, he was just some drunk homeless guy and if he tried to tell them that he was Tony Stark, they'd probably assume him to be crazy, too. That sounded like a sure-fire way to get sent to the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time and he'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats 'cause they're coming to take him away, ha-ha!
"Not after you killed Joyce!" Lorraine's voice broke as a sob ripped through her. She was able to maintain the volume, though. "Not after you took their mother away from them! I'll never let you have them, especially when you're in my front yard screaming at me in your
"Where's Barton now?" she asked.
He had let things get too far out of hand. Whether or not it was a "problem" was a discussion for a different day, but it was out of control. It honestly made him afraid. He had become just as reckless as Howard had been and from what he could remember, all he cared about was keeping up his buzz. Nothing else mattered to him – not Steve and not anyone or anything else – just the booze. That truly scared him. He didn't want to become like that. He didn't want to hurt the people he loved. He wanted to protect them. From what, he didn't quite know yet, but he knew that he wanted – no,
Some things couldn't be helped, though. So, Tony just hoped he could get away with winging it for now. Getting behind the bar and down on his knees, Tony started by taking the doors off the cabinets, which was an easy enough task. After that, he moved on to removing the shelves. He had to lie on his back and angled his head oddly to spot where the screws were, he managed to do it and got the shelves out without too much difficulty. Once he had all the shelves removed, he could easily see where all the bolts holding the countertop together were and set about removing them.
Alright, I get the feeling this is a case where politically, I'm damned if I do say something and damned if I don't - especially since everything I have to say comes from a place of deep-seated anger - so all I'm actually going to say is try and stay safe if you're living in the D.C. area. Same for anywhere else in the US. As the inauguration draws closer, I doubt this will be the last incident we have.
"I know." She moved her head so Clint could hear her clearly but kept it at an angle where he would not be able to see most of her face. "I know, but it hurt. It really hurt. I wasn't expecting…"
While Lara talked to the police on the phone, she saw the building's head of security, Tobias Wallace, walk up to the suspicious individuals. Wallace had his back to the camera, so she couldn't see what he was saying, but she assumed he asked them to leave. Lara felt her gut twist unpleasantly. Although the agent that attacked her wasn't armed, his buddies clearly were, and she couldn't help but worry about what they might do. Still, they seemed compliant enough, so much so that Lara eventually relaxed and sent Tony another text.
"Alright," Knežević relented. "Do you know where you're going?"
"Yeah," Tony said. "The mail gets hit with a small amount of radiation. Not enough to hurt people, but enough to kill any viruses and bacteria that could be inside."
"Uh…"
"Goodnight, Tony." The room was once again plunged into pitch blackness as Pepper turned off the lights and left.
"We got in a fight," he said. "He locked himself in the bathroom and I haven't been able to get him to come out. I think he slept in there." Lara frowned.
"Will you stay with me?" he finally asked, his voice coming out in a low whisper.
By the time they reached the end of the stairs, Tony could hear and argument breaking out on the floor above them. Two women – one with a British accent and one that sounded American but had the tiniest hints of British mixed in there – were shouting but their tones weren't angry. One sounded concerned. That voice belonged to his assigned S.H.I.E.L.D. physician, Dr. Smith. The other voice was just plain stubborn and insistent. He had a feeling he knew who it was, but it wasn't confirmed until a figure appeared at the top of the stairs. It was the woman he had known as Homeland Security Agent Jennifer Duran but was now being told was S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Jessica Drew. God, he was getting sick of the spy games.
"Yes ma'am," the woman reassured Fury's second-in-command. "I calculated exactly how much diazepam his body would need to remain in a relaxed state without overdosing. He shouldn't react violently." Hill considered the woman's words carefully for a few moments.
I need to stop writing these author's notes when I first wake up. Seriously, my head is empty right now and I don't have anything meaningful to say.
"We think we might know what the powder was," she said. Under different circumstances, Tony would have taken that as good news, but the somber tone of Smith's voice told him otherwise. Glancing down for a second, Tony noted that the alarms had stopped blaring, but the doctors on the other side of the vinyl sheet were still clearly speaking in rushed tones.
"You're not."
"Right away," JARVIS said before the audio switched over to the sound of a phone dialing and ringing. He brought a hand up to Tony's forehead and found it to be unusually warm and sweaty, particularly for someone who had spent the past five hours sleeping with the air conditioning on full blast. He could only hope that it was not indicative of something serious as he waited for poison control to pick up.
Yeah, Tumblr pulled me into that show, and then I pulled my family in, and now all I'm doing, if I'm not watching the show on Netflix, is reading Destiel fanfics on AO3. Like, I've gotten so obsessed with the show it's not even funny. The only one who I think might have gotten more into it than me is my mom because she read all of Revelations in one night after we started watching Season Four, and yesterday we got a new kitten and she ended up naming him Castiel. (Which IS the perfect name for him, but still.)
"I can't help but wonder if your emotional state stems from a lack of fulfillment. Tell me, Mr. Stark, do you feel satisfied with where you are in life?"
"I can pay for it," Tony was quick to assure. The cashier – a boy who looked no older than fourteen – shook his head.
"Yes," Steve nodded, and the doctor made quick work of the examination. He shined a light into Steve's eyes and ears, listened to his heartbeat and his breathing, examined his throat, and checked his pulse. All of these were procedures that Steve was quite familiar with, however, the doctor eventually had to move on to procedures using more modern equipment. None of the tests were invasive, but the unfamiliar instruments did give Steve a sense of unease…
Yes, he was only now talking to Laura about the dog. In his defense, this was truly the first opportunity he had gotten to do so. When they arrived at the tower, Clint couldn't connect to the hidden server network he used to contact Laura. He tried on both his laptop and his phone but had no luck with either. The best he could guess with his limited technical skills was that Stark's AI was blocking the signal from going out. No matter what Clint did, it wouldn't connect and that frustrated him beyond reason. For obvious reasons, he couldn't ask Stark to fix this for him, so he ended up having to contact Hill.
They were walking through the last exhibit of the night – an exhibition of artifacts from every war America had fought in. For some reason, Tony wanted to do this exhibit last. That was alright with Steve. To be honest, he was glad to have saved this until the end. He was told by S.H.I.E.L.D. that the Allies won the war. They didn't elaborate on how they won it. Some of the atrocities committed in the name of victory shocked Steve to his core. If it wasn't for Tony's hand coming gently to rest on his shoulder, it probably would have been much more difficult to keep himself grounded.
"Yes," Natasha said. "But you know there are other things we should discuss, like running the team."
"You're welcome," she said before leaving the room. "Have a good night."
"Still, we should toast now!" Knežević raised his glass with shaky hands, causing some of the glass' contents to spill out. "Just 'cause… Just 'cause we should."
Remember kids, always have your chapter ready to post the day before you're actually going to post it. It makes life so much simpler.
"That's good," Carol remarked.
"I didn't lock myself in there," Lara pointed out.
"Crap," Tony said. "The post office must have screwed up somehow…"
"All those in favor, say 'aye.'" Again, a chorus of ayes followed, this time from Natasha, Bruce, and Clint. "The ayes have it. Motion carries."
There was one drawback to this method of transmission, however, and that was that it took a long time for these videos to be passed along. Today, video can be passed along instantly with just the push of a button. In 1995, the tapes had to be physically passed from person to person. So, it took a while for these things to gain traction. Once they did, though, the destruction that could be done to one's reputation could be just as devastating.
A lot of you are probably disappointed that we didn't see any Steve and Tony in this chapter (especially considering the bad place I left Tony in the last chapter), but don't worry! They'll be back next chapter! In the meantime, I hope you didn't mind spending time with Lara and Bruce!
Carol and Fury looked at each other, confirming that they had both heard the same thing. Fury turned towards the door.
"Just if there are certain questions you don't want to be asked," Freeman explained. "Something you'd rather keep private, those sorts of things."
"I would be concerned if you didn't." Dr. Fox finished fiddling with the equipment and stepped back into view. "Like I said, valium is a sedative. It's supposed to make you feel drowsy. In fact, I was surprised that you didn't fall back to sleep as soon as you woke up."
"Red. Red is my favorite color."
"Jobs can be entertaining," Bruce argued.
"This is the first time you've been in this room," Tony pointed out.
"Probably," Tony shrugged.
So, Steve prepared himself as the concierge brought up the file they wanted. For the first few minutes, they watched the video play at normal speed without seeing a single sign of Tony. The concierge then offered to speed up the video to twice it's normal speed. Then he sped it up again, and again. Natasha had to stop him from speeding it up to sixteen times it's normal speed out of fear that it would go too fast and they would miss Tony.
"After that tape was released, Stone made the wise decision to steer clear of Tony at all costs," he said. "Personally, I think it was to protect his own reputation. If he and Tony were seen together, it wouldn't be hard for someone to put two and two together."
Is there a reason I feel so passionate about this topic? Well, yes, sadly, there is. IRL, I have someone in my life with a serious addiction issue. It's to the point where I want to cut this person out of my life completely, but I can't because I live on their property and do not have the financial means to move out. Several people in my family have suggested holding an intervention for this person. However, I already know that's not going to work. This person denies that they have a problem, has refused help consistently, and has even directly stated that if we hold an intervention for them, they'll never want anything to do with us again. (Which is where that line from Tony comes from.) For me, if an intervention were to take place, then I'd be out of a place to live, and I think this might be regardless of if I was directly involved in planning the intervention or not. Besides, I'm confident that they're too far gone at this point for an intervention to even be useful. The only way this person's going to stop is if they die, which would be kind of sad if it wasn't for the fact that the person that they were had died years ago.
"Okay," Annabeth said reluctantly.
"Damn it," she cursed as the elevator doors opened back up. Getting to her feet, Lara sprinted back into the penthouse. "JARVIS!" she called out. "JARVIS, can you block the elevator so that way no one can access it?"
"Fine," she said. "Don't tell me then."
"It's too late!" he called out. "She can't stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe."
"No," Tony said. "You grabbed me and dragged me out of there! If the roles were reversed, you would be screaming assault!" He didn't know what it was he said, but Lara went completely pale and it looked like she started shaking a bit.
was going to be either.
Quickly pulling herself up and onto the flying motorbike/platform, Natasha was instantly faced with the problem of the two Chitauri soldiers occupying the space with her. The first one was easy enough to take care of. She just had to cut the cord tethering the alien to the bike and knock it off with a single roundhouse kick. The other one was going to be a bit more of a challenge.
"Alright,
"You're out of breath," Fury pointed out.
the one who's going to be paying for it."

"Why not?" Lara gave a half-hearted shrug.
Stepping straight down the hall, she walked into the kitchen to find Steve and Natasha exactly where JARVIS said they were. Steve appeared to be making sandwiches while Natasha sat at the counter with a triumphant smirk on her face.
"He wouldn't stop throwing up," he said. "He was in so much pain, he choked a few times, at one point I seriously thought he was going to die… It was… I don't even think I should be talking about it." Natasha nodded in understanding.
"Nine-eight-nine-nine-seven-six." Natasha nodded and punched the numbers into the dial pad.
"JARVIS, what time is it?" Tony squeezed his eyes shut.
"Same here," Steve said. "Why? Do you think there's something suspicious there?"
"I'm jealous of your
"Music is fine," Steve said. "It won't bother me."
"An orphan hospital?" Jessica raised an eyebrow.
"Good call," Natasha said.
"Hey yourself," Steve said with a small grin. "What's up?"
"I added that new Vita-Water stuff to it," she said. "So, if it tastes funny…"

The Supreme Understanding's membership peaked sometime in the mid-to-late '90s, but once tragedies like the Waco siege and the Heaven's Gate mass suicide started making headlines, it became harder and harder to recruit new members. Eventually, Adoniram became desperate, making doomsday prophecies in order to draw in new members. It did entice fear in some people, but in the end, it made more people leave his religion rather than increased their faith. When he gave the date of May 21st, 2011 as the end of the world and the day came to pass without incident, he saw the biggest withdrawal yet, leaving him with only a few hundred, somewhat skeptical followers. He pushed the date back a few months to September 4th, 2011, in a last-ditch effort to revive his followers' faith in him.
"Fine," she said. "But let it be known that I think it's too good of an opportunity to pass up."
"Jess is fine," Carol assured. "It only took a week for her to recover before she was as right as rain again and running off to go back under deep cover. I would've left after that, but then I found out my niece had leave this week, so I decided to take the opportunity to spend time with her." Tony nodded understandingly.
"Good."
"Oh, fuck
"What? Lara please, stop." Although Lara wanted to just go and not stop until she was in the next country, she found herself heading his command, if for any reason because she didn't want to force him to grab her. Slowly, she turned towards him. Bruce had to pause for a second to catch his breath before he spoke. "What happened?"
was heard as the metal of the staff hit the housing of the Arc Reactor. Loki's face fell. He tried raising it a second time and touched it to Tony's chest, producing the same result. The Arc Reactor covered his heart, protecting it from whatever magic hijacking spell Loki had tried to put on him. That was the second time since this whole thing started that his genius had inadvertently saved him. "This usually works."
"I do," he said. "I want to be there for Betty, but…" He shook his head. "It feels surreal. Like it's from another life that's not my own, even though it is. I mean, I wouldn't be what I am now if that wasn't a part of my life, but at the same time, it feels… Foreign interacting with it, alien almost. Do you…" He frowned before looking back at Lara. He knew what her reply was going to be, but he still had to ask. "Do you understand?"
"You left him at the bar?" Hill raised an eyebrow and Natasha looked down.
"Barton has it, doesn't he?" Smith slowly nodded.
"That aside," Natasha said. "What else happened?"
"In the State of New York," DeMarcus said. "Trespass against land is considered a misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of twelve months incarceration. Meanwhile, accessories to a crime can face up to fifteen years in prison and that's usually reserved for truly serious crimes such as murder or bank robbery. With trespass, a judge is more likely to add a few years' probation to his sentence."
"The elevator already has that function built in," JARVIS said dryly. "I believe that's why Mr. Stark gave you a key."
"At night," Tony responded.
"Since Stark started to lose his mind and made his girlfriend CEO and a Russian traitor his secretary."
"Seriously."
"I have unfinished business with Loki," Thor said.
"Yeah, Dad, where is he?"

"You know," he said. "If we weren't potentially poisoned, I'd kiss you right now." Tony laughed.
Clint's gaze went to the vinyl divider that separated him and Stark. He couldn't see through it, but he knew Stark was on the other side. That served to make things a little less creepy. At least there would be a witness if the doctors decided that he was beyond the point of saving and they might as well take his organs while they were fresh. (
"Really?" she questioned. "You honestly want me to go around your lab – which is locked down tighter than Fort Knox – to make sure that no one is hiding in there." Yeah, Tony could see her point.
"Tony…" He turned to look at his boyfriend directly in the eye.
"You didn't have to do that," he said. "I was fine." He felt Steve's hand gently rub his back.

"I know what you mean," Steve remarked. "You're not hungry, though?" Tony shrugged.
"Shut up," she muttered as she slid her phone back into her messenger bag. "So, what are you doing up this early? Out of the two of you, I thought Steve would be the morning person."
"Then why do you keep doing this to yourself?" Steve asked. "Drinking all the time… Am I not enough?"
"Yeah," he said. "I might have been told that before. Albeit in a different context."
"Well, you can forget about it because it doesn't matter, I'll still do the interview." Freeman – who had been looking like he'd been trying to get a word in edgewise for about a solid minute – seemed to visibly relax. Tony turned to look at Natasha. "What does matter, though, is how Agent Romanoff knew about that. What, does S.H.I.E.L.D. have a super-secret spy satellite orbiting my house now?" Nat just shrugged.
"I must admit, I too am puzzled by Loki's actions," Thor said. "What kind of game is he playing?"
"Everything," Tony said. "I mean, if you like Microsoft, fine, but at least upgrade to Windows 7."
The first place Steve headed for was the bar in the back of the room. He asked the bartender if he'd seen Tony (and was momentarily thankful for his boyfriend's celebrity status as it made searching for him so much easier. All he'd have to ask was "have you seen Tony Stark?" Anyone would automatically know who he was talking about.) The bartended had in fact seen Tony and confessed to making him a drink. In his defense, it wasn't made clear to him that Tony was already drunk until after he had already served him. After ordering his drink, Tony had spotted someone he recognized and took off in their direction. The bartender promised Steve that if Tony came back, he wouldn't serve him. Steve gave the man a grateful thanks before going off in the direction that Tony was last seen going.
"I don't know." Well, obviously he knew he was drunk and left the hotel, but everything before, after, and in between was a fuzzy mystery to him. "Who are you?"
"Mr. Stark, it's freezing out. Even if the sun is coming up, you're not going to last much longer in this cold." Tony was still hesitant. "When we get there, I'll call Duane. We'll get you back to the hotel and sorted out, okay?" Tony kept his skeptical gaze on Salinas for a moment longer before nodding.
"Well," Tony said. "If you really have nothing to lose, then you wouldn't mind a short stay at San Quentin. How does twenty-five to life sound? Fair, or should we take away the possibility of parole?" Tony turned his attention to the cops that had gathered in the beach's parking lot. Quite a few more had shown up – probably spurred on by Iron Man's arrival at the scene – but no one had approached to help him with Knežević yet. "Hey, wouldn't mind a little help here! It's not like I can handcuff him or read him his rights!"
"Good," Pepper said in a lighter tone. "Now, back to business."
one! Now, if you would kindly back away from him before he's sick again…"
"It's the city that never sleeps," Tony pointed out. "It's always changing."
"Okay, ma'am," the officer said. "I believe you." Lara let out a frustrated huff of air. "Now, can you try to describe what happened in detail?"
"Just be sure to join me fast, stranger," he said. "It'll be mighty cold and lonely without you."
"Pass it over here," Rhodey insisted. "That way you can just tell me the answers and I can write them down."
Turning her gaze up to the ceiling, Lara took a deep breath in and out. There were a lot of things she needed to do to fix this while most of it was going to have to wait until morning – which
"You too." It was clear that Happy was just saying that to be polite and all conversation died there. Tony fell back to sleep quickly, leaving Steve to stare out the window at the passing landscape as they made their way to Malibu.
Loki's head burned as he realized what he'd just condemned Asgard to; what he'd condemned
"Like I said before," Tony said. "I only got two minutes in before you sent the doctor in to interrupt us. Plus, you people probably gave him more valium than he needed, so he's completely out of it right now. I wouldn't be surprised if he's forgotten that I even spoke to him by now."
!" Knežević let out an aggravated sigh.
"You okay," a wary, slightly accented female voice said. Natasha looked up to see Stark's assistant and found that the question was directed at Stark.
"What?" Oswin quickly pulled out of Nina's embrace but moved to cradle her face in her hands. "What do you mean? Why would you think that?"
"If you couldn't handle it, then you shouldn't have had breakfast up here." Tony kept his gaze on Steve, so he had no idea how Lara looked, but his best guess would be annoyed.
He then took off in the direction of the elevator. He heard Happy call after him, but Tony ignored him. Once inside, he shoved his key for the penthouse into the proper slot and slammed his hand down on the "close doors" button so fast, it left a stinging feeling in his hand for a few moments. Bouncing anxiously on the balls of his feet, Tony awaited the elevator's arrival on the proper floor when JARVIS' voice came over the speakers."
"Please don't choose porn!" Clint laughed again and that was enough to make Natasha's lips quirk upwards, too.
Freeman then slowly stepped away from the podium and presumably off stage with Cabe closely following him. Pepper stepped into shot seconds later, still the epitome of composure. She began to speak, but honestly Lara barely payed attention to what she had to say. Instead, she was getting up out of bed and began to search for clothes to wear. As much as she wanted to sleep, it was clear that Pepper was going to need help handling this crisis.
"Right," Betty said. "I'll start compiling a list of bio/chem labs in the Newark area."
"Nothing," Steve said before a moment's pause. "You nervous?" Tony scoffed at the idea.
"Ma'am," he said. "We've been asked by S.H.I.E.L.D. not to comment as for as their exact role and extent of involvement in the incident. So, again, can you stop with those questions? That would be great." Everhart frowned for a moment and Tony couldn't help but feel a little smug. Clearly, it wasn't the first time she had pressed the issue. Quickly, she seemed to accept this and moved on.
"It looks different," Steve finally said. "But it's still the same. Steve turned to Tony and saw that his lips were still slightly quirked up.
Honestly, that was easier said than done. His thoughts were a rampaging cacophony of fears and regrets. The only thought that he could clearly make out amongst the noise was "why the fuck did I do that?" Granted, it wasn't a given that if you open a letter, you should expect it to be filled with a possibly deadly powder, but at the same time, Clint couldn't remember why he opened the letter to begin with. He just went ahead and did it without thinking.
