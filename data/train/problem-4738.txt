“Why are you scared of them, Wesley?” Tony asked, as he folded the paper and put it into his inside pocket.
“Would a counter argument effect you, now?” Tony demanded suddenly, in a different voice entirely, before Adam could answer what Steve had said. And Adam just exhaled, softly.
But he’d never seen radiators of this shape and size, before. Like he’d never seen light fixtures that looked like his, or ever been in a home painted this strange shade of yellowish cream. Oversights in the research process, slight errors in the dates, a misunderstanding of the little details - like Fury picking the wrong baseball game to play as Steve woke up, or the agent who came to greet him wearing the wrong tie and bra. Minor, understandable mistakes that nonetheless made Steve feel disorientated and nervous, like he was wandering through the eerie almost-perfect suburb at the beginning of a horror movie…
By the time his own giggling had petered out, Steve felt weightless and watery, still smiling at the sound of Rhodey’s laughter, echoing in the distance…
There were suddenly all these unconnected ideas in his head. Thoughts he just knew were important, that would all thread together into the same epiphany, if he gave it a moment…
Sam, Tony and Bucky had been sitting in silence on the uncomfortable wooden bench in their holding cell for about fifteen minutes.
But, with a lot of careful thought, he finally took that step, and came to a heavy stop just behind him. Tony started talking before he even turned around.
do first?” Steve questioned, very carefully - not entirely sure what he was hoping for, but certainly hoping very hard.
, that person has to be a con artist or a nutcase… And maybe I should be a bit concerned, by how quickly I believed you weren’t a con artist or a nutcase…” he huffed a self-conscious laugh. “But I mean, there’s no blueprint for what comes after that. All the usual relationship rules don’t apply. And I couldn’t just… you know…
“I think it’s actually just that your brain doesn’t know how to interpret the signals your arm is sending,” he continued to speak directly to Bucky. “I think this problem requires more reprogramming than it does surgery…”
except me. You called Clint, and didn’t think for a second that he might say, hold up Cap, Tony’s my friend too. You brought Scott Lang in, and you didn’t know if he was Ross’ secret lover, when you did that. You called Wanda, and she was literally the bad guy in the last fight we had. And all of you got together and discussed this thing like a team, because you knew when it came down to it you’d only have to say you needed help, and they’d be loyal to you –
He’d love to think that he could just ‘be himself’ and ‘go with the flow’ and ‘learn as he went’ and have it all work out… But he’d tried that once.
He maneuvers back to Tony but straddles him the opposite way facing away from him, so that his ass is on display, hovering over Tony’s stomach.
Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Steve can handle that, picking from options. Tony makes everything easy.
Steve nods, “I’ve been thinking about that actually. What would you think about co-leading the team with me?”
“Right,” says Bruce, “A year ago Tony’s blood looked totally typical, just like Sam’s. But here’s what it looks like now.” Bruce dismisses Sam’s screen and brings up Tony’s new results alongside his old ones. At first glance they look similar, but there’s a series of flags and markers on the new one, and the lab results in the corner have several readings that are highlighted in red.
Tony every night, knowing that in the morning he won’t be there. He hasn’t called. Will probably never call.
“Look, I think this is on me. I knew we needed to have a bigger conversation about what we were doing. I knew that maybe you weren’t 100% ready to jump into this with both feet. I was just so excited Steve… you’re… god you’re everything I thought I’d never have. I’m sorry if I pushed you to do something you didn’t want or didn’t understand.”
He confidently palms Tony’s erection, sliding up and down as he leans forward to kiss Tony’s neck, ears, hairline. Tony arches up into his touch but doesn’t move his hands.
Tony gives him one more squeeze and goes to take his usual seat by Steve. Maybe it’s out of respect for Scotts awkward crush, but they don’t touch much, just sit together and watch the movie, arms brushing. When it’s over and Tony and Steve head off to bed, Steve gives his a friendly punch in the arm as he goes by.
And if he always used to have his bags brought inside before Afghanistan and Obi, so what? It doesn’t hurt to do a little moderate lifting.
In fact, the whole concept has continued to dominate his thoughts, to the point that Bruce has noticed and asked in a worried tone one day if Tony is experiencing any mental impairment.
Tony keeps his hands resting lightly on the sides of Steve’s face and neck. “Go ahead and take me out, but don’t pull my pants all the way down, you’re going to want them there in a minute.”
“You’re barefoot! Jesus Steve, this sand is too hot – what” and grabbing Steve’s hand to tug him back toward the shade of the house. “What are you doing? You want blisters your first day in Hawaii?!”
His phone blinks to life at 10%. Steve looks over at Tony, who is still basically passed out. Steve shifts tenderly as he swipes in his code and settles gently on the edge of the bed so as not to disturb him. In their last round Steve got his first experience bottoming and his ass is still tender. It’s fading quickly, but he flushes at the intensity of it. Tony really didn’t hold back… shit, he’d better focus on the phone before he gets sidetracked, again.
Tony moves his hand that isn’t occupied by Steve and runs it through his golden hair, sensing his heightened emotions.
But Steve is kissing Tony before he can even get the question out. Steve can’t believe this. He really has been such a stubborn, goddamn idiot.
Steve can’t wait anymore. He’s been so entirely focused on Tony’s pleasure and comfort that he has  been ignoring his own arousal, almost unaware of it. But now that he’s spreading the lube over himself he realizes how close he is, how much everything has been affecting him. He’s so turned on he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to last more than a few strokes.
Surprised, he almost lets go of the hammer. Tony showing up means things are about to get much better and much worse. The armor doesn’t have the helmet and he can see Tony’s face clearly. Hear his natural voice. It cuts through the whispers of the bog drowning out everything else.
Jesus, could Steve be any more confusing? He says they need to keep things non-sexual, and then puts his head on Tony’s crotch...
Scott settled his Cassie visitation with Maggie amicably. They decided it will gradually increase over time so he can ease into the role and also pursue The Avengers stuff. It’s going to take some time with the lawyers to get it all official, but for now they are good with him taking her at least for overnights a couple times a month. In the future they may change it to Friday-Sundays, and then who knows.
“Uh, well we met up about five weeks ago to get everything figured out with the Accords… it sort of happened then.”
Steve tries to smile, still tense. He doesn't know what he needs to hear, but he can't help but feel things aren't resolved.
Tony gulps, nodding before a breathy “Yes” escapes. He closes his eyes, and Steve can feel him getting harder under his hand.
Tony looks like he’s about to say something, but instead sways forward and almost crashes to the floor. Steve catches him mid-drop, slowly easing him to the ground.
He takes off his tinted glasses and sets them down along with the fork. Pepper always hated talking to him when she couldn't see his eyes.
Thanks to PerplexinglyParadoxialPerson who pointed out anyone subscribed to this story would not be notified if it was made a series and updated, so I will post a placeholder chapter once the next part of the series goes up.
Tony makes a small shrugging motion and propels himself off the bar, moving toward Steve. Once he reaches him they’re standing a few paces apart (basically still in front of the elevator because Steve appears to be rooted to that spot), Tony spreads his arms out to his sides and raises his eyebrows.
Tony doesn’t seem to know what to do with the praise, so he redirects. “Fuck Steve, you’re so gorgeous. Above me like that.” Tony presses his hands against the headboard hard enough that Steve’s enhanced hearing can make out the wood giving a little.
What is Tony… He has to make this clear, he has to say the right thing, even if he has no idea what that is. Steve wishes he had time to think; he wishes he could go up to his room and have time to write his thoughts in a letter. “No, wait, I don’t think I was clear. Tony, I don’t feel weird. I’m – I’m just trying to ask you how you feel about me.”
Steve hates the idea of some random cleaning service cleaning up after them like that, but he’s so sticky with sweat and drying ejaculate that he just gets up off of Tony and rights himself on the side of the bed. He offeres a hand to Tony to help him up.
Pink tinges Steve’s cheeks as he considers that he and Tony have been buck naked for over 48 hours. It actually felt odd to pull his clothes back on his body, restrictive, like shackles.
Steve presses his face deeper, breathing in. Tony smells amazing, a clean fresh scent mixed with a distinct aroma that’s naturally his. Steve is already zoned out, totally overwhelmed by the smell and feel of him. He spreads his knees a bit further apart so that his face lowers below the waistband and down to his goal.
came, that should have taken the edge off… but it seems over the last few months he’s trained his body that he can come the moment he gets immensely aroused. Night after night he would wake up aching, and rush to take care of himself as quickly and quietly as possible. By the end in order to get even an hour of sleep he’d wake up hard at least two or three times a night, always ready to come. Waiting like this, even though it’s probably only been about 10-15 minutes makes his eyeballs itch and his hair stand on end.
Steve nods and picks up the lube before rounding the exam table to stand on the other side where Tony can have a clear view of him.
It’s happened over and over tonight. The realization that Tony hasn’t felt truly happy, hopeful, relaxed, safe, in such a long time. Because he’s feeling those things now, and they feel new and foreign.
They begin what is sure to be a heated debate about what is to be done with Thanos (who is now held motionless by some ancient contraption Wong provided, head bowed) when Thor drops from the sky with blinding speed and hits him square in the chest with a huge axe.
Tony does not let out a whimper. It’s definitely not a whimper… but whatever it is he doesn’t dwell on because imaginary Steve’s hand moves from his hip to grasp him fully, hesitant but strong. His whole body weight would be braced on the glass, pressing back against Steve. He’s so close now, and Jesus all he’s thought about is Steve’s hand wrapping around his dick.
“Steve, Steve” is all he can manage as he’s taken almost all the way out of Steve’s body and then right back in, again and again.
His grip on the handrails is firm but they feel solid. Tony must have upgraded this shower to accommodate his strength, he thinks, as he pulls out and slides deftly back into Tony to the hilt. It feels so good to take him like this, to surround him from behind, while being firmly teathered to the wall. He thrusts once more.
“Tony?” Steve sounds worried now, and apparently wants a response. What can he say that will convince Steve that this is okay? He probably can’t. But he can at least convince him that he understands.
regret." Steve pauses, eyes bright. This is his only chance. "I don’t know if there is anything I can say; I should have tried harder. You don’t… god I don’t know how to say this without sounding like a sanctimonious asshole…”
Tony focuses on the last of the code which simulates splattering blood and bites his tongue. He knows better than anyone that people change, and that Thanos was a master manipulator, but he’s never going to tell Thor Loki is forgiven for New York. Thor has regaled them a few times over the last six weeks with how Loki attempted to kill Thanos in the end, choosing to save Thor and sacrifice his own life.
Steve is glad Tony’s eyes are still covered where he’s laying on the bed so that he can’t see how Tony’s little monologue has utterly destroyed him. He’s instantly hard. His brain is on fire from the scenario Tony has laid out.
in his warmth as it bleeds through his leather jacket, smile hidden under his helmet. And Steve grips Tony’s arm with the burned hand that can’t grip as well, and holds it tighter against him on the sharp turns to make sure he’s secure. Tethering him close.
“Well,” Tony says slowly, like he thinks Steve is missing something obvious. “He’s still a wanted man, right? He can’t hide in Wakanda forever. We need to figure out how to get him exonerated too, offer him a spot on the team if he wants it. I probably owe him a new arm too, now that I think about it…” Tony shrugs, eyeing the last dregs in the coffee pot wistfully.
Thor examines the arm and sees he added a retractable sight-laser, and a special grip on the shoulder that is just the right size for Rocket’s hands. “Yes,” Thor says, strangely moved that Rocket wants to ride with him during their many forthcoming adventures, “this will do nicely.”
Tony’s eyes dart up and narrow as he continues to tap on the pad “Um, who had you watch Star Trek? Did they even show you The Original Series?? Oh my god Steve, promise me you won’t watch any more sci-fi until I can be there to properly supervise.”
“… My planet destroyed, my father dead. Had to kill my sister. My brother died, he’s back but he did die of course... Oh what a year.” Thor refuses to break eye contact with Steve, who is now a lovely shade of strawberry.
He misses Thor and the Guardians leaving by a week. He would never tell Thor, but he’s relieved the compound is fairly calm as a result of their absence. Tony gives him the run-down of how the team is functioning and offers him some lab space of his own down in his workshop.
“You kept the phone.” says Steve, noticing the flip-phone he gave Tony months ago on a wireless charging pad next to the tablet.
Tony squints at Thor now. He’s not sure if Thor is constantly trolling everyone, or if he really is as oblivious as he seems.
Tony actually draws blood, while Widow, Steve, Black Panther and Wanda hold him in place, managing one limb each. They have him splayed out like he’s on a saint Andrew’s cross.
Tony throws himself on the bed dramatically, even though his suit might wrinkle, and they need to be out front in five minutes or Wanda will magic his balls off.
boyfriend material. Okay, yes Steve is stubborn, but so is he. And maybe Steve doesn't really know what he’s doing when it comes to being in a relationship, but… god, is it wrong that Tony actually finds that appealing? Like, for once he isn’t the only one that’s clueless about how “normal” relationships work. That for once it wouldn’t be someone trying to pull him into their idea of what he should be… always pulling. Even with Pepper he felt like… but Steve is just this unending force of acceptance. It’s addictive. He doesn’t feel like he’s being pulled at all, it’s like he’s got a fucking life raft.
“Perhaps you were worthy once... Are you still?” he asks, before dropping his hammer in the muck at Steve’s feet.
Steve smiles, “No pressure, I know you’re all-in with the team, and I know everything with Pepper only happened a few months ago. I just want you to know I’m not going anywhere, no matter what.”
“Studies have shown that manual stimulation of the area after the procedure can increase the treatment’s effectiveness.” Steve says, continuing to press two fingers inside, rubbing at his cum, pressing it against the Tony’s smooth channel, working to press it deeper.
Steve is struck once again by how great he thinks Tony would be as a co-leader of the team. For whatever reason he’s rejected the idea so far. Maybe as the financial backer of the team he feels like it would put him into a position of too much control? Steve resolves to continue to check with Tony on all major developments. Even if he doesn’t want the official title of team leader, Steve wants him there every step of the way.
“Okay first Tony, you will need to either abstain from penetrative sex or use condoms for the foreseeable future. We need to observe how long the serum stays active in your system, and if there is deterioration or negative side effects when you are cut off from... the source. Then I’ll need you to provide a blood sample at the same time every day for next two weeks.”
Steve nods. Whatever Bruce says, he will take to heart. Bruce is this calming force (which Steve supposes is ironic). He trusts him.
Please let me know if there is anything off here, it's been quite a while since I've seen either Ant Man! I did some googling 🤔
“Please.” He says again, louder this time, sounding exactly as broken as he feels. His cheeks burn and everything in him tries to reject this feeling. The feeling he’s fought against his whole life.
Natasha spares them a glance from teaching the dog to ‘play dead,’ saying “He’s fine, he just needs sleep.” LASS-E dramatically clutches at her chest with a rounded metallic paw and lets out a pathetic whimper.
Steve feels… he doesn’t know what this is. This warm, unwavering acceptance radiating off of Tony’s best friend. He starts to get a bit choked up.
It’s been a five days of sly glances, heated texting, hurried kisses in abandoned hallways and two aborted attempts to sneak into each other’s rooms in the middle of the night (you try hooking up when you live with a guy who phases through walls and doesn’t need sleep). Tony is actually considering building a secret passageway between the compound’s master suite and Steve’s room, or kenneling Vision at night. Or hell just announcing their relationship at the next team meal, because Five. Days.
“Come on, Cap, don’t be that way.” says Sam. “What were we gonna do, out you? Make you tell us before you were ready?” Sam slaps him on the back as he goes to drop his dishes in the sink.
He sits on the adjacent sofa and sets his pad on the coffee table. He brought it in case this is just an early check-in meeting about his X-Con analysis... but he gets the feeling it’s something else.
Tony helps Steve lift the last of it off of him and they set the car down. Another bystander is already bending to make a tourniquet for the old man out of his tie.
Thank you again for reading! I wrote and posted almost 35,000 words in like two weeks, which is the most I've ever written at once in such a short timeframe.
The collective Avengers groan at the name (minus Steve, who thinks it’s pretty… he thought Tony would go for more of a cliché, like Rex or Fido).
He starts with one finger, and quickly moves on to two, stretching and scissoring them until he’s aching for more. He doesn’t linger, this isn’t the main event, he just wants Tony to see what he’s learned.
No, it looks like Steve is just... looking for something at the back of Tony’s throat… with his tongue. Now he's picking him up, and grabbing his - oh wow, make that 5% gay. He’s definitely 5%, maybe 10% gay for Captain America
Tony winks, and presses some of the small gold tubes of lube into Steve’s hands, turning around on the platform to address the shower “Cleaning mode 3.”
He steels himself and prepares to call Tony’s best friend. Of course there’s a more obvious reason for him to be dreading this conversation. He hasn’t spent much time with Rhodey, and Steve hasn’t forgotten that his conflict with Tony inadvertently paralyzed him. God, should he bring that up?
Tony doesn’t respond, but thinks he may text her again in a week or two. With time it would be nice if they could be friends again; after all, it’s possible there’s a vacancy opening up.
He’s also bought two post-run PowerAids from the nearest cart, so he’s pretty sure he’s pulling his weight even though he's not like, actually running.
Steve keeps up the unhurried movement of his fingers and moves up Tony’s body so that he can kiss him. “So you’re saying you trust me?”
Upon waking up, he finds a contract in his personal email from Stark Industries to hire him as a security consultant. There are so many zeros in the fee he’ll be getting that his teeth chatter. It’s more than he’s made in the last… maybe ever.
Steve can feel his skin getting hot. “I feel… really good about all of that Tony. I… before last night I thought I really wanted you to take control, tell me what to do, um, dominate me? But, I think, I also like the other way, where you do what I want. They both felt right.” He shrugs, he can’t really explain it better than that.
Steve seems satisfied with that because he licks at Tony in earnest, probing him with the tip of his tongue. But then he stops, he doesn’t delve any further…
Steve also asks if anyone else on the team wants to bring up anything around the idea of personal relationships, and there’s an awkward silence.
Tony yawns and rubs drool from his beard and smiles as he stretches. His t-shirt rides up just a bit as his sweatpants ride down, and Steve catches a glimpse of the shape of the muscles in Tony’s torso that run down diagonally, forming a “V” shape toward Tony’s…
Strange jolts out of it. “I’ve looked forward in time, to review alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.”
After he tracks Vision the first time, it’s easy to follow Wanda back to the others and digitally tail all of them with minimal effort. In truth they’ve been pretty boring. Steve booking a coach ticket across the Atlantic was a pretty big red flag, but it was his first significant movement in months. Tony figures Steve could be coming back to New York for a variety of reasons. It’s a big city, after all. Except, shortly after his plane touches down Friday reports that the nanobot-beacon on Steve indicates he’s making a beeline for the Tower.
“Tony I’m… I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m not really even sure what “as much or as little” even means. I think I’m probably most comfortable having you tell me what that is in more detail? And um, you probably already noticed I don’t mind you taking the reins?”
Except that he was just in a car accident so it actually does hurt, and Steve ends up taking all five bags (four of them Tony’s).
Tony is light-headed with power, holding Steve hostage between the two fingers jammed in his ass and the tight grip he has on the base of his cock.
When they enter the kitchen Vision and Wanda are hovering over the stove and Nat and Sam are at the table in the open-concept dining area (looking very much like vultures, waiting for Viz and Wanda to finish with the kill).
Five more minutes turns into thirty, which then developes into frantic frontage with the remaining gold lube when Tony helpfully points out that Steve has become hard again during their cuddling.
Steve is there, standing on his own two feet, pulling a car off an old man’s leg. He’s yelling to a passer-by.
“Hand-holds, Steve.” Tony reminds him. Steve looks up and sees the second set of handholds several inches above the ones Tony is grasping. He reaches out for them, finding that they provide the perfect leverage for him to take Tony from behind.
Tony balks. “What do you mean least surprising?! I was with Pepper five months ago! Five months ago Steve and I almost killed each other! Don’t do that thing you do where you act like you knew when you didn’t.” Tony is pointing at the screen, playfully accusatory.
Tony can guess the answer from their previous fingering interrogation, but it feels important to go over this while they’re not in the middle of having sex…
Unfortunately, by the time Tony realizes what a perfect opportunity this is, Steve has already left for his morning run.
But Steve isn’t moving, or scoffing at Tony’s blatant impropriety. In fact he’s… uhh, he’s looking… at Tony’s crotch?
Tony rewards Steve’s accommodation with a hard bite right on his ass-cheek. He tastes like lemon and honey.
After Siberia Steve starts waking up every few hours. It’s odd, but he doesn’t think much of it, he has a lot on his mind after all. The days pass and he finds it harder and harder to fall back asleep and stay asleep. And he starts to remember his dreams. He can’t get the images out of his head. Cold. Pain. Tony.
Steve is catching up now, and beginning to blush. “Right, sorry Bruce, we told the team just a few weeks after the reunification, but you were gone… and then Thanos, and then you were off in the Alps…”
“Sir is in the lab with Dr. Banner." There is a brief pause before the AI continues "I have been contacted by Director Fury and Agent Romanov requesting that you return to SHEILD to complete your debriefing…” there’s a very slight upturn in tone at the end, as if JARVIS is asking a question.
It’s like he’s lit a fuse and Tony is off, telling him everything he wants, the words tumbling from his mouth like a waterfall.
Steve opens his eyes to see Tony looking down. Gazing at his hands running over Steve, the head of his cock appearing and disappearing faster and faster as Tony works him.
Oh fuck, this was probably a terrible idea. He checks his reflection in the small outgoing screen in the corner similar to a webcam. He’s flushed. Fuck, what was he thinking? Pepper knows what he looks like when he’s aroused! But she said it was urgent…
“So, I, uh, I finished work on the virus,” Tony started, nervously. “Well, I think it’s as well suited for this task as it’s possible to be, anyway. And… when I was running tests with it, I managed to unearth a couple of encrypted files on outside servers - things Hydra shouldn’t have shared off their network, probably. The work experience kid fucking up or whatever, most of them. And I didn’t think too much of it, because it’s not like you can work backwards from there or anything… But then I got to looking at what they were, just, because, you know, they’re confidential Hydra files and we should probably know…”

Steve dragged Bucky on top of him as he fell onto the bed, clawing Bucky’s t-shirt over his head so roughly that he stretched the fabric. He saw Bucky grin, briefly, as he rushed to meet Steve’s pace, ripping Steve’s shirt off and unfastening his jeans.
Although, if he’d been less consumed by that, Steve would probably have realised that… Bucky gave up on that
Steve wanted this. And not just how much Steve wanted to touch him, or even how much Steve wanted Tony in general; Tony could feel how much Steve
we jump right to the Hunger Games theory - there has got to be a way of finding out more about this place, and this stupid festival. If we had more information, we’d have more chance of finding the real answer, rather than, you know, just coming up with ‘could-be’s…”
He knew that sadness would never go away. No matter how great a world he built here, no matter how happy he was with his choices, no matter how much better he could do by another, equally valid Bucky, still, there would always be those questions in there somewhere.
Bucky was saying any of this, what the thread of the conversion was supposed to be - Steve didn’t know in which direction to reply. Whether to search for an answer to Bucky’s accusations or look for a deeper meaning in them or to wonder whether something else had happened…
example, of me being unreasonable.” Tony went on, snuggling closer to Steve as he spoke “I mean, maybe it wasn’t my most rational contribution, but it’s probably not the thing I would’ve gone all Dawson’s Creek over, if I’d had to pick just the one… But, you know, that’s because there
When the door opened behind him, he didn’t even jump. He realised that somewhere between being left in this room and now, he’d fallen into a genuine
And then he looked up at Tony’s house, silhouetted against the evening sky. There was that familiar twist in Steve’s gut, just from knowing that Tony was near…
But then he remembered that he’d already handed that off to Steve… for reasons that made sense at the time…
“Sort of,” Tony answered, dropping into the seat beside him, “I mean, I think I might’ve worked some things out.”
“So, what is it they’re pumping up from the basement? Where does that all end up, is it just going into the main water supply?”
He knew that something strange and unknown was happening to him, and that he had to deal with it, however inconvenient that was.
He’d made it as far as the hall before he paused, and, as though it was an afterthought, added, “is there anything that you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know?” Without missing a beat, Steve replied,
“Until when?” Steve bit back. “You think any of us are going to be less hurt and bitter next week? Next year?
He hated himself for breaking his promises to Pepper. He hated himself for being right in the middle fucking up the best thing that had ever happened to him, despite all the second chances he’d been given, in spite of the fact that he’d never deserved it…
“Yes Sir,” Freddie nodded, with the ghost of a smile, “here to provide anything that might make your stay with us more comfortable.”
“And the only way to do this is a step at a time,” Steve added, taking a step forward so that he could put a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
to save people from ever feeling awkward like that. That he was supposed to save people, always. That he was supposed to be the responsible one.
look had nothing to do with their plans for the evening, or the role that Tony had so expertly fallen into - Steve knew that look. Steve had seen that same exhilarated joy wash over Tony’s features every time they’d seen one another since New Years Eve-
“Might be worth looking into” Tony mused, thoughtfully. “Maybe we should go looking for her tomorrow… actually, it might be worth trying to find out some more about the local population…”
And then, without warning, Steve grabbed a hold of Tony and threw him onto his back. A little shout of surprise was immediately smothered when Steve kissed him again, an elated swoon rolling through Tony’s head as he felt the weight of Steve pressed against him. His hips arched up of their own accord, his cock weeping against his stomach. Panting now, Steve moved to kiss Tony’s throat, running the tip of his tongue over the vein in his neck before he nipped lightly at Tony’s earlobe. Tony let go of a high, pleading whine, fidgeting up against Steve as he peppered kisses over the line of Tony’s jaw, and then down along his neck again, and then over his shoulders…
It was just… Outside of all Steve’s vast proclamations and his continued, baffling devotion to Tony, it turned out there
Again, he thought about telling Tony that he loved him - that he already thought Tony was the best thing that had ever happened to him, that Tony deserved to like himself more than this…
“God, I’ve not heard anyone talk about Tyrone Powers in – years,” he explained, still giggling. “I’d forgotten he even existed.”
And then he felt Tony’s lips soften against his, and the shiver that ran down Steve’s spine was so tender that he simply melted into it. His grip loosened into a caress, slowly working down Tony’s arms, bringing him as close as he could in this slightly awkward side-by-side position on the couch. For a few seconds there was nothing but this warm, buzzing dizziness and the rapid thud of his heartbeat-
He knew it didn’t make sense, but he didn’t feel drained – he felt as though something more substantial had rushed to fill the gap. Deeply and bodily satisfied-
He blinked, and raised his head from the patch of white carpet that he’d been vacantly staring  through. He found a disorienting wall of moving light, without perspective, without edges...
“You didn’t hide a bomb in a government research facility,” Tony reminded him. “You didn’t cut corners, or take unnecessary risks when you got there. You didn’t say, screw that, I’ve saved the world nine hundred times, I’ll sit this one out – like you have every right to. You turned up, and put yourself on the line, and saved as many lives as you could without putting others at risk. And then you stood there and let a group of angry people yell at you, because the person who’d really hurt them wasn’t there, and they needed someone to blame,” and then Tony traced a fingertip over the line of Steve’s jaw,
he processed the look on Tony’s face. The way Tony closed down, and curled into himself, and looked away from Steve.
“I want you to” Steve purred, rolling his hips into Tony as he shifted to lie over the top of him. And Tony carried on babbling swear words and endearments and promises and pleas, as his wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and grabbed mindlessly at his back-
Steve was rather taken aback by the lift in his chest when he caught a glimpse of the wrapping paper. He didn’t know why he should be surprised by the gesture, seeing as it was so obviously something that Tony would do - or why he should be so immediately and purely
“The place first came to the attention of local Vice five years ago, because of rumours that it was a cover for a prostitution ring,” Nick continued. “And maybe it was. Police never found any firm evidence of anything, probably ‘cos they put no effort into finding it. It came to
, from the moment they walked in. As far as they could make out, there was no greater concentration of drugs in the air here – but according to the research files, the substances on offer at these bars all had a very specific effect. And, from the looks of things, they were
“So, here’s what gets me,” he announced. “That is at least one bullshit detail too many to be a cover story. If you just came here to tell me some fake story, common sense says you’d have stopped at ‘I’ve been frozen for seventy years’. There was no need to add aliens after you already added time travel. So, either, every part of that story has a reason to be there - there’s something very specific you’re trying to do, or find out, with each part of that…”
“You feel better sweetheart?” He whispered, stroking a palm over Steve’s ribs. Steve just nodded, as enthusiastically as he could manage – although, truthfully, he had no recollection whatsoever of ever feeling bad. He couldn’t remember anything outside of this room, couldn’t conceive of any other priority… But he knew he felt better. That this was as good as it was possible to feel. Tony let his head rest on Steve’s shoulder, his hands stroking over Steve’s waist, curving over his hips. “Good…”
“Loki, my brother, was quite gifted at subterfuge. I always looked down on his tactics, but it had its uses, oh yes, much like Loki himself. At first you think, ‘oh that’s terrible’ but then, after a thousand years it grows on you.”
A small smile appears on Steve’s face, but he schools his expression quickly. “I think in the future that may be an option for you, however given the severity of your condition, you’ll need full anal insertion today. Getting at least two doses into your anal cavity will be crucial to the procedure’s success.”
Steve shooting him a blinding smile while he looks up at him like Tony is his own personal Jesus isn’t helping either.
Pepper lets out a small noise. “Are you even… god Tony I didn’t even think you… with men. I know there were those rumors when you were younger, but you’ve never talked about, never in all the time I’ve known you … I’m just… and Steve?” she looks so lost.
“About six weeks ago when I went to visit Tony, we resolved a lot of the conflicts we had that were keeping the team apart. And we also worked out many of the issues between the two of us. Our personal issues. That is, what I mean is that Tony and I ended up changing the nature of our relationship at that time, and we wanted to tell everyone about it… that our relationship has changed. Improved really…”
“Yeah that’s difficult Bruce… I guess I have been feeling just… good? Sleep has been better, I have more energy, it’s easier to focus. Oh, wait I think I’ve got one!” he looks triumphant.
“Ah to be a part of a romantic couple again!” interrupts Thor. “I have so many cherished memories of that time with Jane. Just her and I, caught up in a lover’s trance. But oh how these last years have been lonesome. The past few months especially… Although I was able to save the Earth and return my people, it
Tony moans at the loss but is otherwise silent, pliant. Steve shifts Tony into a bridal carry and moves them to the other side of the bed where the sheets and comforter are cool and undisturbed. He knows they’re both a mess, but it’s all he can do to lay Tony down and follow close behind, wrapping him up in his arms.
“I get it," Tony says, brushing a wet strand of hair away from Steve's face. "I was outed as bi by a tabloid in my 20s, but I definitely let my dad and everyone else think I was straight for a long time. I just ask because I know you mentioned being less experienced and I want to make sure you feel okay with everything. I can still… even though you’re the one fucking me, I can take the lead if you want?”
Bruce takes a deep breath and appears to be gathering himself. Tony is pretty sure he’s doing his meditative breathing.
A smooth stream of water adjusts so it runs down the base of Steve’s head and over his shoulders. Tony angles the water a bit more to wet Steve’s hair and then puts it back to run over his shoulders, grabbing one of the bottles next to him on the shelves.
He’s been in the “future” for over five years now, but it’s still engrained in him to think kissing a man will get him a negative reaction. Especially from a military man.
“We’re running a bit behind, we’ll meet you there.” he says into the comm before shutting it off. As a rule he doesn’t like to use the comms for non-Avengers related communications. But he also doesn’t like to spend the evening sitting awkwardly in a crowded dance venue hard as nails.
Nat rolls her eyes. “Come on Steve, we know you. We were sequestered in a series of tiny shacks and hovels with you for months. After you came back from seeing Tony it was like you were a different person. Not to mention in the months before you left when you could barely eat or sleep. Something was tearing you apart from the inside, and when you got back you were whole again.” She shrugs and spoons another bit of paprikash into her mouth.
“I’m, I am fine.” he says, “Stay back. This is my task.” He pants heavily, and pulls his arm up to the heavens.
happen, and when it does, we need everyone together. The previous Accords were drafted out of fear and reactionism. The CAP PAC and the changes it promotes to the Accords are the key to a safer present and a safer future.”
“I – yeah, that’s actually part of what I wanted your advice about. You see, I didn’t exactly tell Tony about Becky. Well, okay, I just didn’t. And now he’s found out through Clint and I think I may have really messed things up.”
The next fifteen minutes are a torturous affair. Steve moves in and out of him like a metronome, in and out with such consistency that Tony feels like he’s getting fucked by a machine. Tony just sinks further into the table and loses himself in it.
Bruce pushes his glasses up his nose and adopts his most professional, science-lecture tone. “Well our basic theory right now is that intercourse is the delivery method. Anal suppositories work because the anal cavity is highly adept at absorbing things directly into the bloodsteam. It’s why something like HIV is transmitted so quickly through anal intercourse. So somehow Tony is absorbing your dna through your semen. Normally that would not be possible, but your semen may be acting more like stem cells than regular sperm cells due to the serum? I’m not sure, we need to run more tests.”
“Okay I’ll get clean and then meet you in the bedroom, Steve. I’ll be sure to stay nice and tight for you. Nobody has fucked me in about two decades, so I’d say you’ve got your work cut out for you.”
Almost immediately Thanos gets a few amazing shots off, one of which sends Steve flying (later he would reflect that if Tony hadn't gotten him his shield, he most likely wouldn't have been able to withstand the blow).
Peppers eyes widen at that. “Tony, I’m not saying this to hurt you… but I just can’t see how this isn’t going to completely blow up in your face.”
Steve moans weakly as he realizes Tony is doing exactly what he said he'd do, fucking is mouth with his tongue. In response he sucks Tony's tongue into his mouth just like he did his cock, his own erection showing interest again, never having fully softened.
Rhodey waves him off, “Just a bunch of jokes about how my dick must not work, you know the military. There are some good guys out here, it’s just that mentality they get when they’re all together. I miss you and your sensitive soul Tony.” Rhodey batts his eyes at Tony.
At first he thought Steve might refuse. He’s been fluctuating back and forth between team-leader-Steve and friend-Steve enough to make Tony’s head spin. And it’s already spinning. Honestly, he half expected Steve to cart him back to SHEILD HQ and have them give him a psych exam, and then wish him the best of luck and leave.
Tony takes stock of himself, his head clearing a little. His ass feels used but not too sore. He can feel that Steve is still fully hard inside him.
Steve looks mildly confused but not concerned, and follows Tony’s directions, pulling the pants down a few more inches, just enough to allow Tony’s cock to spring out, heavy and flushed. Steve licks his lips, looking up to Tony to see if he has any further instruction.
Steve replaces his mouth with two fingers so he can access Tony’s prostate, moving his mouth up against Tony’s testicles “Touch yourself Mr. Stark, that's it.” Steve says and then sucks on Tony’s sack gently as he assertively strokes his prostate. Tony comes for a second time, covering his own chest and abdomen as he cries out “Steve!”
The flight to Hawaii takes eight hours, and Tony sleeps the whole way there. Steve can’t help but smile to himself as he looks at Tony across the aisle, snuggling further in to the fancy blanket that is wrapped around him. Tony’s private jet isn’t quite as nice as the five-star hotel they’ve been staying in, but that doesn’t seem to matter because Tony is finally getting some solid sleep.
Whenever Steve is in the room she automatically runs up to him, barking for him to play with her or scratch her ears. Steve is almost always happy to oblige, and on the rare occasion he is trying to do something important (finding the channel with talking the Sponge in the Pineapple is important!), her helpless whines and dejected lowered tail make him give in soon enough.
Tony reaches out and touches Pepper’s hand briefly across the table. Just a quick acknowledgment. A thank you.
Steve nods, before saying “Yeah, um, I’ve been with a couple of women but not… back then it wasn’t something you could be open about, and then, I like women too so it just seemed easier…”
“Hmm, yes Steve?” Tony asks as he rubs the cloth up gently to the back of Steve’s knee while kissing the knob in front.
Before he goes back to San Francisco maybe he will give them the heads up that if they are trying to keep their relationship off the radar, sitting basically on top of each other isn’t the best tactic.
Tony smiles up at him from the mattress, loose and happy. “If anyone asks, I’ll tell them Captain America did his due diligence.”
But Steve is ticking all his boxes and seems eager for more... The fact that he needs to come at least twice makes Tony's head spin with the possibilities.
He can’t believe he asked to see the bed; no wonder Tony keeps pushing… he’s practically paving the way for him. And that’s the crux of it, isn’t it? He kind of wants Tony to push. Well, no he really wants him to. And he doesn’t. He still doesn’t know what he wants and they are going into Tony’s bedroom.
And how could I not include that bit about Steve being an island in a river?! Seriously, go read '1796 Broadway'!
Milan, Shanghai, Seattle… Tony has been traveling for months making business contacts and attending conferences. Steve writes him every day. Sometimes they are really just doodles of things going on around the tower (one especially explosive entry -- and the one that finally gets Tony to start writing him back in earnest -- is a doodle of Natasha kissing the Hulk with little hearts above their heads and the caption “Seriously, this is happening”).
Steve blushes, not missing what kind of “unwinding” Tony probably needs to do alone in the shower, but nods because he really doesn’t want to leave Tony, or this bed… which Tony must be joking about the price of, right?
Steve moves back over to position himself where he thinks he needs to be over Tony’s hard cock. They’ve done this once before, Steve bottoming from above. It was a hurried frenzy out in the living area on the sofa. Tony prepped him and guided him down over himself then; the logistics seem a little different with Tony flat on the bed and Steve fully in control.
Scott turns into Gi-ant Man and mainly serves as the split-second distraction they need to get the upper-hand.
So no one is making him do the “right” thing here, but he’s figuring it out. And the result is that he gets to be around Steve.
Tony throws Peter the most epic high school graduation party ever. Some kid named Flash won’t leave Tony alone until he promises him he will record a tik-tok video with him.
“You need to be completely honest. You need to be honest with Becky,” Steve winces, he really should be more concerned about Becky; “You need to be honest with Tony, and most of all you need to take a hard look at where you are and be honest with yourself.”
Bruce steps out from behind the mystery doctor and suddenly they’re off. Dr. Weird whisks them off to the “New York Sanctum” and lays it all out.
And he still isn’t sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. He doesn’t feel any more sure than he did before coming to Hawaii. In fact he’s even more confused, because right now Tony doesn’t feel like the biggest mistake he could make, or the best thing he could ask for.
A similar set-up to the shower setting Steve initially saw all those weeks ago emerges, with a single shelving unit coming out adjacent to a six-inch-high platform against the shower’s main wall. This platform is about a meter wide but only about a foot deep. Two sets of hand-rails emerge from the wall above it.
Tony confirms, “Yeah it’s air-tight. It can go underwater, into space. The spores shouldn’t have had any way in.”
“I get it, Steve. I think you’re right that the first step is getting everyone back together. Hell, convincing them they can trust me and that you and I really have resolved things. That's the priority.”
Rhodey shrugs in response. “I think Pepper spent a lot of time trying to convince you to be something different than you are. And convincing herself that you were different than you are. It wasn’t always a bad thing, she wants you to be a responsible, careful, realistic person, like her. But what you
all of the time. But we need a way to work out what to do when I, or anyone else on the team, thinks something isnt right.”
Tony squeezes down on the dildo instinctively, he’s pretty sure he would come instantly if he was allowed to touch himself right now.
Tony only beats him by a handful of seconds, but he’s already fiddling with a read-out. Of course Tony’s shower has a computer in it. Someday Steve wants to take Tony camping. Get him in a tent in the woods with nothing that connects to the internet, or has a computer chip in it, or even runs on batteries.
Steve slides his hands down Tony’s back to slip under the curve of his ass, suddenly remembering  howTony exclaimed when they first started that he wanted Steve to “move him around however he wanted.” Tony can be like Steve’s Dream-Tony, but he's also the opposite. Tony likes to be
Seriously... This is just a ton of smut. Like, is there a rating past Explicit? Mild warning - more D/S stuff ahead.
“Yes, oh… so if you’d rather, I can clean your ass. Dip my soapy fingers down to tease your tight hole. Open you up. Maybe if you beg just right, I’ll take your hole with my mouth, plunder you with my hot tongue. That's called rimming by the way if you didn't know...”
Steve and the others have been officially moved in to the compound for five days when by some miracle, everyone has plans, leaving Steve and Tony alone. Vision and Wanda are out in the city (on a date they aren’t calling a date), Rhodey is off at some military PTSD-awareness thing and took Sam, Scott is still home with his family (and figuring out exactly how he wants to juggle his life in San Francisco with being an Avenger), Nat is visiting Clint and his family. It’s perfect.
Finally after a week of less than an hour of sleep a night, he can’t even remember why he thought anything was more important than Tony. Or no not Tony, the team… the team staying together.
He gets to see Steve smile, and joke and shovel popcorn and cotton candy and cinnamon sugar pretzel into his mouth with glee. So when he sees the ring of cinnamon and sugar coating Steve’s mouth, he doesn’t lean forward and swipe at it with his tongue, or brush it off with his own thumb and lick it clean. He hands Steve a napkin and suggests they go see the mongooses.
Strange responds, “there are still almost 20 outcomes where we win, but they aren’t pretty. So, I need a clear picture in my mind of where to go, do any of you know where the witch or the shrinking man are right now?”
After toweling off Tony turns the knob of the bathroom door, eager to get back into bed with the real Steve.
Steve puts his foot down, causing his legs to make a “V,” with Tony kneeling between them at his feet.
everything we have done tonight. I am 100% over the moon about it, everything that’s happened. I have most definitely wanted it all; in fact I’ve been the one “taking the reins” right? Just because I’m not hard doesn’t mean I’m not so satisfied, so incredibly
The nerves he has about finally talking to Tony are building, but he can’t regret his decision to do it in Hawaii. Japan was a toxic place for Tony; hopefully Hawaii will be a place he can really start to recover (both from the accident and the pain of his split with Ms. Potts).
He’s not going to push, but he’s not going hide either. He’s not going to call Becky out, or let slip that he did a fist-pump when he read that she possibly-probably ended things with Steve.
Steve opens his eyes and watches Tony select a pretty standard-looking washcloth and an orange bottle. The smell of citrus erupts around him as Tony wets the cloth and pours a liberal amount of soap onto it.
Steve goes on, clear-eyed and sure. “I can’t regret taking a stand, Tony. It’s who I am. But I know what I did wrong, what I
“Well, I actually just got it on good authority from Tony Stark himself that ‘It’s doesn’t matter two fucks what kind of doctor I am, I’m smart enough to switch when needed.’” Bruce rolls his eyes, but affectionately.
that Tony would put his mouth… there. His cheeks clench at the idea. It feels incredibly taboo, like something so foreign his brain doesn’t even have the ability to process it. Tony wants to stick his tongue in his ass.
“I think Scott.” says Tony. Steve is surprised. Scott is the newest member of the team and knows Steve and Tony the least.
Maybe if Tony had been there, he thinks. But wherever Loki is (Thor is convinced the snap brought him back, but they haven’t seen him), Tony doesn’t want to know about it.
He comes up behind Tony, overwhelmed. He runs his hands up and down his back, before going lower to cup his ass. Steve spreads him wide to get a better look at the plug. Jesus, it’s big. The width a little bigger than Steve's cock is maybe, he won't be able to tell for sure until it's out.
“Nah kid,” says Tony. “It’s just a reminder in case anyone panics or gets pinned down. Just say “I heart New York” and the whole program will pause. We just picked a phrase that nobody would actually say in battle. If we made it “I can do this all day” for example, the program would probably pause in the first two minutes thanks to everyone’s favorite Brooklyn boy.”
Steve doesn’t need to take his hand, but he does. Just slides it big and warm into Tony’s own like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
This is the longest thing I've written in a long time, please let me know if anything is unclear or rushed 😁
Peter webs it down from the sky while Wanda prevents it from getting any more shots off with a forcefield of her magic.
Rocket shakes his head. “No one ever knows what you’re saying, you know that?” He picks up another wrench and points it at Tony.
Steve surpresses a sigh and follows him up the staircase. If Bruce is able to figure this out and ensure Tony is safe, Steve will buy Tony a mountain of burgers.
Finally, after Steve has eaten three sandwiches and finished off all of Tony’s orange juice (Tony eats one sandwich and a pot of coffee), they can’t put it off anymore.
He looks fucking spent. His legs are splayed out in random directions, his chest is heaving. His eyes are closed tight, like he can’t even stand the stimulus of sight right now.
Steve can’t think. He wanted this; he wanted to know how Tony felt. And now he does and he is totally unprepared for it. He wants to interrupt Tony and tell him that he can’t seem to let things slide when it comes to him. He can’t focus; he
In seconds Friday responds, voice echoing out of the armor, “It seems there are multiple fan sites and posts devoted to your alleged relationship, and one tabloid story from a year ago. However, there is nothing that has gained mass awareness or acceptance, Boss.”
Steve scoops him up into a bone-crushing hug, lifting him off the ground and even spinning him around in one tight circle.
Steve kisses him, as though to test it right then even though they’re both on the sofa in loungewear in the master suite of the compound, no armor in sight.
Steve blushes deeply down to his chest. It’s not like before though, he doesn’t feel ashamed… well, he does but Tony is there and he can tell he’s proud of him, so it’s like... a good shame? He’ll have to think on that more later, because it doesn’t really make any sense.
He’s so lost in his own thoughts that by the time he looks up, Tony has the vid-screen up and is calling Rhodes. God, he didn’t even hear what Tony said to him about being on camera or not. Where should he stand?
He enters the suite with tunnel-vision, quickly stripping off his clothes and heading straight for the bathroom. Tony showed him the suite on his first day here under the guise of a grand tour for him as team leader (wherein they got a hurried make-out session in before Sam came around asking how to work the TV).
The car pulls up and Steve gets the bags as Tony pays the driver. The house is insane. Steve can’t think about what a place like this must cost. It took him a while to get used to the tower, and he isn’t really even comfortable with that yet. Tony probably has places like this all over the world… it makes Steve feel like there is an even bigger gulf between them, thinking about his childhood and then later the tiny apartment he could barely afford. Even if Becky was out of the picture, and even if Tony’s flirting has been due to romantic feelings… how could a relationship between them even work? Could Tony even see anything past Pepper right now, if ever?
This fic and others to follow is an off-shoot of the AMAZING epistolary fic “1796 Broadway,” where ‘Captain America respectfully requests that all complaints be addressed to him in writing.’ I really admire what the authors are doing, and the slow build they are creating is so so lovely… that said, my brain won’t shut up after each post with “what now???” so this is an answer to that.
Steve slips fully into the floaty feeling as he lets go, accepts that he’s just a nice warm place for Tony to come into. He’s there to accept whatever Tony gives him, he just has to be still and keep his mouth wrapped around Tony’s perfect cock and just be. Perfect.
His hand falls back to his side. Maybe he didn’t have access to the building after all. Maybe Friday is testing him, or let him get this far at Tony’s directive only to stop him here. He hopes Tony is actually in the tower. Steve knows he was in New York as of yesterday for a charity gala. Something promoting STEM for kids in low-income populations.
Rocket also makes Quill a matching arm laser attachment that can slip on his arm over his coat. Quills been feeling pretty sensitive about the whole ‘Thor joining them’ thing. In fact, he makes Quill’s even more accurate, with a faster retraction and longer range (or so he tells him).
He showers and checks his beard. Moisturizes. Puts on some deodorant, all while raging to the open air and Friday about all the things he’s mad about. Not just things Steve has said or done, the whole lot of it. The entire clusterfuck of the last four months. Hell, the last four years.
God Steve must be close. He knows it's probably just his inexperience. To offer up "anything" so easily like that. It makes Tony want to wrap him up and keep him away from anything that could ever ruin that perfect openess.
LASS-E makes a cute grunting noise, and the metal polymer that covers her form changes from primarily silver-white (with blue feet and a red nose) to a vibrant green color.
Tony puts a hand on Peter’s shoulder to settle him down. “Hold on there, underoos, what do you mean Ned owes you $20?”
“So, you like the bed then?” Tony asks as he crawls in, with as straight a face as possible (he isn’t very successful).
This is now a series! Apparently if you subscribed to this story, that doesn't mean you'll be updated that it is now a series or when the series is updated.
Steve nods even though Tony can’t see him. “Good, as I said, it’s completely normal to become aroused and even ejaculate. It’s against ethical codes for me to touch your genitals, but if you need to you can touch yourself after a certain point during the procedure. I can let you know when that’s allowed.”
After the team has been at the compound for two weeks, Steve and Tony decide it's time to tell everyone about their relationship. Steve wants to call a meeting.
“How are you doing?” Steve asks, and Tony wonders if he’s getting off on this as much as he is, because Steve’s tone is still one-hundred percent professional.
… I’m officially dreaming. Okay dream-Steve, here’s what I want. I want you naked, like, yesterday. I want you rutting on your knees for me until you get rug burns from my Isfahan rug. I want you to take me as deep as you can down your throat, get me right to the edge, and then back off. I want to slap your beautiful face with my hard cock until you're begging to have it back in your mouth, I want you to choke on my cum and I want to taste myself on your pretty lips before I fuck your mouth with my tongue the way my cock just did moments before...”
Tony sighs. “It’s… The cradle fixed it… Look, I can’t promise the next time we fight I won’t get freaked out a little… and yes don’t look at me like that Steve, we’re both running high on endorphins now, but we are going to disagree in the future. You’re a stubborn son of a bitch and I can be kind of an asshole. We’ll work on it.”
Tony groans and it’s not a groan of pleasure. Steve pauses. He doesn’t want to push Tony if it’s something he really doesn’t want to talk about, but, he did tell Steve.
He feels petty and angry and wants to punish Steve. Drag him down low to where Tony’s been these last months. Fuck, maybe he shouldn’t even see Steve face to face. Maybe he should leave him down there to rot.
“The truth is Tony… the truth is that I don’t regret saving Bucky. And I don’t think I was wrong about the accords… but I’m sorry-”
“I’m going to touch you now Steve. First with a new cloth to clean you, then my fingers, then if you’re good, my mouth okay?”
“Tony, leaving you in Siberia was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I never wanted to fight you, and hurting you… I know I can never take that back. Siberia was entirely about protecting Bucky, you know that right? If it was anything else I would have rathered it was me there on the ground left behind.”
Tony is basically non-verbal now, just moaning with the occasional word slipping through like “yes” or “fuck.”
Tony can’t even track what Steve is talking about, but he knows he doesn’t want Steve to leave him like this. He is so vulnerable, exposed ass up in his medical gown. Tony has had a lot of sex, and done a good amount of role playing, but this is more intense than he imagined. Maybe another time getting left in here and not knowing when Steve would be back
Steve feels his heart swell as Tony stares at his creation. He’s seen soldiers coming home look at their newborn baby boys with less pride.
Tony doesn’t say anything about his growing erection. Steve told him to be still and quiet. Steve is in control.
Okay, so the exercises kind of work. Tony’s heart is no longer racing, but he still has an obvious issue to deal with that isn’t going away. He peaks an eye open and glances first at the tenting of the sheets, and then to Steve, who still has his forehead pressed against Tony’s temple.
Steve laughs even harder at Tony’s scandalized expression, and soon they're both laughing, and it’s like that day at the pond… but with erections. They laugh until they ache, until finally they’ve both calmed down enough for Tony to blurt out:
Tony looks at him like he’s crazy. “I’m coming with you! That’s standard practice for these kinds of things, right Bruce? The spouse can come with?”
“Here comes the first dose Tony, remember to wait…” Steve is breathless, and comes quietly, shoved all the way inside of Tony.
Rather than be medically retired after the paralysis, Rhodey pushed to finish his active duty contract and complete his 20 years. The equipment Tony designed for him means he can do anything an able-bodied person can (actually his legs are about 20x stronger). Tony is proud of him, but he will be glad when he’s home for good, and an official member of The Avengers.
Steve smiles at him softly, and shit, if he keeps making eyes at him like that, they won’t even have to tell the team anything. Tony glances at everyone else and the feeling in his chest expands. Sam looks content, Nat looks approving, almost proud. Wanda looks touched and she’s the first to raise her glass in return. Vision looks, well, blank. But he always has the same sort of non-expression. Tony should spend more time with him, learn his reactions better.
When they pull apart Tony is breathing heavily. Steve seems mostly recovered, his chest rising and falling normally. Tony’s gaze drifts further down to see that Steve is fully hard again. Sweet Jesus.
Tony is actually starting to blush, because of course his perverted mind can’t get off the submission/blowjob thing, and of course his fire hose of a mouth does nothing to keep those thoughts from just spilling out.
Steve lets go of the hands and eases off Tony a bit so he can settle his weight. At the same time Tony slides up the bed slightly until his hands brush the smooth, teak headboard. He closes each hand into loose fist and presses them up against the wood. It gets at the spirit of what Steve wants (Tony's hands held in place above his head), but allows Tony to ground himself. To have something to press against when things get too intense.
way something I invented could’ve caused an accident that killed a person who was meant to do a thing on this planet, or something?”
“I’ll let you familiarise yourself with the details,” he said, as though he’d decided to be gracious about Steve’s bad mood. “Agent Hill will be here in thirty minutes with transport.”
And then Steve broke the kiss to gasp for air, still holding Tony close as he threw his head back and panted.
But before any of them could answer him there was another commotion at the other side of the courtyard.
He drained his glass and brought it down on the counter with too heavy a bump. He let go of a weary sigh, and accepted that his head wouldn’t be quiet again for a very long time. There was no point in trying to force a stop on these thoughts.
“Well I sure as hell wasn’t doing it to help the Nazis” Nick replied, stuttering over the last few words.
been overwhelmed and starstruck, after years of telling himself there was nothing special about the man?
“I know, I’m a terrible influence,” Tony grinned, because he already knew that Steve was staying. That Steve
this fell within them. That it wouldn’t fall on anyone else's shoulders if he stopped for a day. That the mission wouldn’t be compromised…
And, heaven help him, for just a few minutes Steve was pleased at the idea of finally having Tony to himself. A reprieve from the constant stream of brash strangers… The hope that Tony might at least
-be, listening to his instincts didn’t preclude all thoughts of the future. Maybe he could follow these impulses while still thinking about the sort of life he might want to build.
“Seems to me, you either know who did that or you’d have no idea whose door to knock on.” Tony observed. Zan smiled.
bad at this, apparently. Very out of practice, you know… But, yeah, I like you. A lot. Enough that I’m seriously wondering if it’s fixed my back pain.”
Automatically, he pictured Steve, pacing up and down the living room as he ticked items off of their checklist. And it probably did occur to Tony that he should really be helping-
… Steve wouldn’t actually feel better for it. Tony might feel better, the way he hoped Rhodey and Pepper did, when he relented and threw them a bone for their efforts. But really Steve would be uncomfortable in what he was saying, selecting the least awkward topic to sacrifice, thinking about the reaction he should be showing rather than the one he was really having. He’d be having the whole conversation through that prism of shame and judgement and doubt…
back, as he focused on reading the discomfort in Bucky’s posture, and keeping his hands very steady. He barely heard himself, describing everything he was doing and giving a running countdown until they were through, his voice unnaturally calm. By the end of it, he’d
– and Steve felt every bit as guilty, acknowledging this – maybe Tony being here to irritate him with holograms was another reason that Steve liked these missions. Because these missions were the only ones that Tony seemed to bother with. Because it took an official summons and the potential end of the world to drag Tony out of his own life and into a setting where Steve might possibly bump into him…
“Maybe, when we get back, we should just talk more about this stuff… just, generally.” He suggested “The things we think and the things we’re not sure if we think and the things where we’re not sure what to think…”
even. Something that he’d felt able to put into context and consider as though it was actually a reasonable,
“I don’t like being handed things,” Tony reminded him, in lieu of mentioning all the reasons that this whole thing was entitled and presumptuous and
that it was as lovely as Steve had ever looked – although the sight of Steve spread open and naked on his bed, flushed and sweaty and still making pleading little noises as he gulped for air, was certainly part of the overall effect…
list of risks and issues was running though his head – the time it would take and the fact that the others weren’t briefed and
An impulse that came directly from this new and unique bond he had to Steve – something that was simply a part of him now, that he would always feel, that he’d always have to take into consideration, from the point on-
“But I am so fed up with everyone talking like we’re on opposing sides of some great moral stand. I am
the best our world has to offer, and if it’s not going to be kind to you, then we should all be fucked, really. And, if the way you’ve dealt with that is by becoming an expert at invisibly defending yourself, while you just keep trying anyway – then you should probably be proud, in a way.” And he laughed softly, and he squeezed Tony’s shoulders…
And it was only because, at that very moment, the photographer let out a more conscious groan, that it
He broke into that same silly grin again, his face flushing hot as he thought about his plans for the night...
And so he thought about what he would say, if Tony woke up and was horrified by what they’d done… What he could do, if Tony felt violated, if that came out as fear or tears, or anger... He didn’t think any of that was very likely, actually… it didn’t
Like Tony, he’d immediately felt embarrassed by his paranoia, and the severity of his reaction… and then, like Tony, he’d second guessed himself -
“…Yes, like every Thursday,” she answered, in that secretary-voice she only ever used to mock him. “So-”
“How lovely to see you all!” He grinned, finally acknowledging the others. “I was actually just on my way to the main studio to look over the plans for this evening's showcase. If you’d like, I’d be very happy to give you a private tour of the-”
, or whatever. I mean, I still haven’t worked out what it is or how it affects me or how much control I can have over it – and, yeah, I think it’s the reason I was…
cautiously… like he was nervous. Tony didn’t know why that should be immediately endearing – but he wished it wasn’t. He was having quite enough difficulty with that one simple question as it was.
Instantly, Steve lit up in an affectionate grin; an automatic response to seeing Tony’s face… Which quickly pinched into a confused frown, as he tried to piece together the story behind this…
In reality, Tony was becoming increasingly comfortable that they’d made the right call. And increasingly pleased that they’d actually made a call, come to that. That they’d finally acknowledged that their relationship had changed since he hired her to be his PA, even if that didn’t make them a good match romantically. To find and name those acts of kindness and concern and commitment for what they really were.
For an hour they just sat there and talked, enjoying the incidental touches that they missed so much the rest of the time, taking in the little details of one another and smiling. Every so often Steve would pull the robe tighter, and the silk-cotton blend would drag over his skin, sparking an electric shiver that was part pleasure, part anticipation. A few times, Tony had slipped into that dark tone of voice, or flashed that authoritative smile, and Steve had become very aware of how naked he was under this thin layer of fabric… But, for the most part, that first hour had been like any of the conversations they indulged in when they finally got a chance to be together.
Some unclear yelling is heard off-camera on Rhodey’s end. He yells back “Yeah yeah, stick it up your ass!”
It isn’t up for debate. Thor insists on wielding the infinity gauntlet, and Strange doesn’t offer up an alternative.
Tony is half hard and getting harder by the second. Steve can only shut his eyes and press and rub against his arousal, pulling him as close as possible, his large hands gripping the entirety of Tony’s ass, almost lifting him off the ground in his haste to get closer, soak him in.
Bruce rubs his fingers at the corners of his eyes, slightly dislodging his glasses. “Honestly I did notice some changes in Tony when I first saw him. In a lot of ways he looks better than he did the last time I saw him, which was what, over two years ago?”
The beating of the water can’t disguise the other noises coming out of the bathroom. They aren’t loud. Steve is pretty sure that a normal person wouldn’t even be able to hear them. The serum improved his hearing overall, but it also made it easier to distinguish noises from one another, and zero in on them if need be.
Tony comes with a muffled shout, covering the glass. He slowly slides down to his knees so his legs don’t give out from under him. That would be just what he needs, for Steve to burst in and see him incapacitated in the shower from coming too hard.
level of asshole that would require some sort of sexual favor in return for what I’m trying to do to bring the team back together…”
Bruce stiffens at the familiar twinge of rage pulsing at the edges of his consciousness. Tony comes up to him, already half-covered in his nano-armor.
Add to that that his room and board are covered, and apparently Avengers team members do get something called a “Hero Stipend” (there is also an email about that), and Tony is right about not having to worry about money. Scott is motivated to create the best, most detailed security analysis possible.
Steve looks ahead and sees a long hall, also lit by the floor lighting. At the very end he can see the glow of real lights coming from an open doorway. He forces himself to walk.
“Wha- What?” Is all Tony says, before his face goes blank. Steve doesn’t know what else to say, and Tony just sits there, and doesn’t say anything for a solid minute. He thinks Tony’s brain may have actually broken, because he has never been quiet this long when he has something to say.
, it’s just… he’s realizing that telling people about their relationship is also basically him coming out over and over? Which he hadn’t done before now because... Well, he's actually not sure why he hasn’t. And now it’s all happening so quickly.
Tony answers and before Steve can register more than that Tony isn’t wearing a shirt, the room is empty and Tony has run out onto the deck yelling “last one to the beach is a rotten econosolv!”
Tony squirms and makes impatient grabby hands for Steve to join him in the bed, which Steve does once he’s devested himself of the rest of his clothes. He drapes himself fully over Tony, but pulls back when he tries to kiss him, waiting for an answer.
Oh. Okay, Tony can see that Steve isn’t here to play around. He’s… god he looks like he’s gone about 100 rounds in B.A.R.F.
It’s always Steve's choice. The dreams are frustrating clear there. He could take his hands off Mjolnir, stand up, push Tony away. The hand on the back of is head is resting, supportive, but there’s no force. Anything that happens in the dreams is Steve’s choice, and he always choses Tony.
Steve opens his mouth to protest, but a sleek red thumb slips inside. He closes his eyes and gently sucks, giving in to whatever is going to happen this time. Relaxing into being with Tony has become one of the only times he feels at peace lately. Might as well enjoy what he can before he wakes up.
Steve’s voice is thick with emotion “I should have listened. I was too stubborn, so concerned with not moving an inch that I didn’t see if I just met you halfway, we could solve it together. Cut the wire."
It’s a lock when he wakes in the morning from a hyper-realistic dream where he and Pepper and Steve had an adorable baby, named after Pepper’s eccentric uncle Morgan.
Steve tries one more time. “I’ll call to see if they have a private table for four. It’s a pretty small place, they may only have tables for two left-“
Everything has become so… he knows he should have found some way to tell Tony sooner. He knows he should have found some way to be better.
my thing so… anyway, the walls and amenities change depending which code I pick. I’ve custom-coded about thirty options, with more one-off features and settings.”
Tony barks a surprised laugh, and takes a moment to rake his eyes over Steve before throwing his hands out in a “carry on” motion…
Steve, Tony and Dr. Strange are almost a match for the two dour-looking aliens (Falcon is doing damage control with civilians).
Well, except Tony, who wraps an arm around him during the next movie night and says just loud enough for Scott to hear:
“I don’t know Steve, you and Tony were getting pretty close before Tony left for Japan.” Bruce doesn’t mean it as a barb, but it’s true. Hours in the lab don’t really make someone your soul mate (despite Tony’s declarations otherwise), and even if Nat hadn’t told him about their letters, it was getting pretty obvious.
The kids are in bed and so are Tony and Steve. Tony can’t believe they go to bed around 10 pm these days, but that’s always the case when they have the kids. Pepper has been dating someone for the last couple of months, so Steve and Tony are taking the kids more than half the time when the need arises. The jury is still out as far as Tony is concerned, but Steve likes the guy.
It doesn’t help that Tony is squirming on his lap, already babbling about what he wants to do with Steve next… wait what?
Tony takes his jaw in hand and slides his length back into Steve’s mouth, while at the same time stepping closer, pressing his leg in a firm line against Steve from his lower  thigh up to his abdomen. Steve's erection suddenly has a heady pressure against it.
Steve groans and Tony can feel a rush of his saliva coat his hole. This goes on for who knows how long, Tony is totally in the zone until,
"Yeah apparently having aliens and the villains of the world try and kill me was just the exact level of drama she could take. Me fighting Captain America and coming home with a concussion and bruised ribs from the
Steve raises an eyebrow as Tony puts on his weekend-causal cloths and leaves the suite. Unsure what to do next, he picks up the package on the bed. Tony said it would have everything he needs.
Tony groans as the absolutely incredible amount of cum inside him begins to slide out. He shifts on the table and rushes to reassure Steve. “Steve, you know how I am, yes it just came out. I’ve been thinking about it… lately. But I didn’t want to freak you out. We haven’t even been together a year. A year and a half ago we were beating the shit out of each other in Sibera. I don’t want to… I don’t want to rush this or do anything you aren’t ready for.”
As she cuts a corner piece for him she says, “Scott, you have a crush on Steve and Tony, we get it, it’s fine.”
There is a small sink and counter station that holds things like bandages, cotton swabs, gloves, pain medication and hand sanitizer. Not only are they realistic props for Dr. Steve to use, they’re ready in case of an actual emergency. The cabinet under the sink has two actual emergency first aid kits.
Tony isn’t surprised. No, he’s had Friday tracking Steve and the others for months (shocker, Vision emits the same energy signature as the stone from Loki’s staff… what did Thor call it, the mind stone… because he
Tony rewards him by pressing in further, stretching him,  opening him up more. “What does 'not much' mean?”
“Alright everyone,” says Steve. “This training course is Tony’s brain-child, but that doesn’t mean he has the answers. Friday is manning the course, and it’s on us to work together to beat it.” A count-down clock appears as a hologram above their heads, it begins counting down from two minutes.
But all that changed the minute he realized he could make all his Doctor Steve fantasies come true; plus, having a fully equipped medical room down there is actually a good idea. If Tony or the others are ever forced to come down into the panic bunker levels, chances are someone will need medical attention.
of a few things. One, you broke up with me. You decided that you couldn’t be a part of my life in that way anymore. So while I still love and respect you as a friend, you don’t really get a say in this. Like,
Steve gets distracted by the taught line of Tony’s jaw. He wants to bite it. Oh god. Shit, he knew his dreams had started bleeding into his waking thoughts, but… Jesus, he needs to focus. Was he always this attracted to Tony? Maybe.
"We were able to sequester Vision in Wakanda. Their advanced cloaking and shield technology makes it the ideal place for him and the stones until we can figure out what to do."
This chapter borrows more heavily from the others in terms of the content of the letters in '1796 Broadway.' I figured at least some of what was written would spill out in an actual conversation, and in some cases more or less, because finding the right thing to say in the moment is very different than laboring over a letter.
Steve>> Sorry, I know I’ve been unresponsive. Tony and I have covered a lot of ground, and we have a plan in place to bring everyone home.
This latest dream isn’t all that different from the others. It starts with him in the middle of a dark, missy moor. It’s nighttime and he can’t see much through the fog though there’s a full moon. He can hear a hundred voices whispering through the mist. Telling him:
Steve just moans and pushes back to meet it. So eager. Tony bets Steve could take a lot, more than the average person, all that bodily perfection. And
related to my past romantic relationship with Tony. At all. You know I love you both, and the two of you… I look at you two, and you’re just… you’re perfect together. But I know kids were something Tony kept in the “maybe” column, and I was thinking that given you two are obviously in it for the long haul, maybe you’d think of this as an opportunity for the two of you as well?”
Tony clears his throat. “Okay also, is this” He waves a hand at Steve, “is this how apologies used to be done? Literal begging on the ground? Jesus, I mean thanks for the effort and all but it’s not necessary. And if we’re being honest, it feels like you’re apologizing, but also a
“Whoa whoa, Sunshine, hold on.” Tony watches Steve turn from blissed-out, to full-on panic mode on a dime. He replays what Steve’s said and feels a creeping dread. He has to get ahold of this now.
They split their time between the house and the compound. They spend long weekends by the lake and have dinner with Pepper at least a couple nights a week. They don’t have a formal custody agreement, but find a pattern that works for all of them. When Steve is away on missions, Tony always stays in their lake house, soaking in as much time with Morgan as he can.
Bruce looks at them a long moment. “Huh,” he thinks, “They’re in love.” He makes some final notes, and gives them marching orders.
it matters! I’m not going to… I’m not going to do anything with you if you’re not going to enjoy it, Tony! I’m not just going to, to use you without you getting anything from it!” Steve suddenly feels panicked, like there’s something huge he’s missing.
Steve’s expression slides into a hesitant, beautiful smile in response to Tony’s gentle tenor and use of “Cap.”
Tony doesn’t seem to have the same qualms though, because he quickly unzips Steve’s pants and leans up so he can whisper into his ear. Steve almost comments that it’s just the two of them, he doesn’t need to talk into his ear like that...
hard because I am so turned on, but then I look down and oh, nope. Which again feeds the hotness of you taking me in that state… so, sorry rambling…”
. My planet, gone. My people, gone. Heimdall, gone. Loki, gone... just when he'd proved himself a true brother."
Tony and Vision take aim at the orb, held firm in the distance by Wanda’s red power. Vision sends an energy beam from his forehead while Tony fires one of his smallest, but fastest missiles.
in my suite.” Tony wiggles his eyebrows and grabs Steve's hand. He starts to pull him away down the hall.
He probably won’t get another opportunity, and he’ll be damned if he ever misses a chance at something this real again.
Steve is starting to blush. God, Tony thinks, why is it so hot when he’s inarticulate? Steve is always clear and eloquent when he’s in Captain America mode. Delivering the rallying speech that gets the team in gear. And that’s it, Tony realizes. This fumbling, awkward person is Steve, not Captain America. And the most incoherent Tony ever sees Steve is during sex, so any hint of hesitation automatically brings Tony’s mind to blushing Steve… about-to-get-fucked-Steve.
And Jesus fuck if they aren't a total match sexually. Tony loved Pepper, but their sex life wasn't exactly what he would call ideal. It wasn't anyone's fault, and he felt lucky that someone like Pepper even wanted to be with him. So a somewhat subdued bedroom wasn't a deal breaker.
“I want to touch you.” Steve would say, finally fully pressed against Tony’s back from shoulder to knee. It would almost be a question.
Dream Tony is a decent size, but there isn’t much of him on either end of where he’s grasped himself. Just an inch or two of give as he pumps back and forth. Steve feels his blood pound as it occurs to him that Tony is going to milk himself into Steve’s mouth. His gauntleted fist continues to slide back and forth, back and forth, the way made easy by the copious amount of salvia Steve has left behind.
Nothing compares to this. This incredible heat, the knowledge that he’s inside Tony, filling him, taking him for his own. He lets out a desperate noise.
He’s nervous to talk to Steve (and also Tony? Steve is the official leader of The Avengers, but Tony is bank-rolling the whole thing, so it kind of feels like a “don’t ask dad without mom's permission too” kind of deal).
… It wasn’t until he picked it up that he realised how soft the leather was, and that it was subtly studded with what were probably real diamonds-
“And I know that all the things I’ve been scared of for twenty years are still there,” Tony groaned. “And, to be honest, I’m still worried about the risk to you and Pepper, and Steve, and the Avengers, and the company… and I still don’t know what the hell I’d go outside and
Finally... I have a *vague* idea about maybe writing a sequel to this - which won't happen for a while, because I have a lot of things to catch up on after the most hectic of all Christmases... but, I've made a post about the idea here: https://wilmakins.tumblr.com/post/189976981732/for-those-of-you-that-read-the-facility
And Steve’s head snapped up, his eyes suddenly fixed on Tony, the threat of tears receding in an instant. Tony swallowed an anxious, bitter taste –
How badly SHIELD had treated Tony - the fact that it had left him anxious, made him uncomfortable in his own home.
An entirely different sort of curiosity stirred in Tony then. Something between shock and intrigue. A personal pang of uneasy amusement that led him to pick the paper up without thinking…
, I have JARVIS running a scan on all the information that SHIELD have on their servers, as well as a general internet search, and I’m hoping if I use them to cross reference, it might help me find the relevant files.”
myself mad, just trying to work out why I change when I’m around you, if I’m making it up - why didn’t you say anything?”
we’re done” Tony answered, lifting his head and pointing at the rack of vials “If I’m right, that is the finished serum. Six batches. But I’m going to run tests on two of them before we go, just to make sure they do what I’m expecting them to…”
Or run, and risk failing this primal instinct once again, and suffering with this desperate physical longing to just see his face-
Bucky pulled away from him, putting one hand firmly against Steve’s back and guiding him to lie down on the bed. Steve felt the world carry on rolling backwards, the ceiling swaying in front of his eyes. He was vaguely aware of Bucky standing up, and the scraping sound of the closet door opening-
Tony’s gaze fell on the bundle of yellowed papers, tied up with a length of ever-fraying parcel string.
“Okay, I probably deserved that,” Nick conceded, far too easily, “and I get that we might have to earn your trust on this one - but can you really tell me that you aren’t interested in
“And he was weirdly nice about it,” Tony carried on, straining to remember. “I asked why he was always sneaking up on people, or something, and he actually apologised… And said it was just because he was ‘hoping to catch me when I got home’ or whatever, and I asked why he even wanted to see me, seeing as I’m narcissistic and volatile and everything else… and then he apologised for
were in real danger if they were discovered by the wrong people – even then, the absolute tragedy of this revelation took precedence.
So Steve just let Tony melt into him, not making Tony look at him again, not making Tony answer him-
He could see Tony struggling to decide what to think about first - whether he should commit to an identity crisis, or an anxiety about the future, or his skepticism about the immediate drama unfolding in his living room…
decide to be a hard working mechanic with a family and a dog – and what a parade I’d have been owed for that. No, I tried to be as good a man as I could possibly be – far, far better than you are, or any of the dicks who work for you – and you’re going to tell me
He could force himself back into the ‘real world’, with its norms and values and concepts of acceptable behaviour - he could make himself confront what had just happened, and all the reasons it was strange…
Saying something about staying here for the next few hours, something about it probably being safer…
“So, to summarise.” Steve stepped in – mainly out of a compassionate instinct to give the woman a break.
too stunned to even think about answering. He hadn’t even gotten as far as not knowing what to say, yet.
And Bucky felt another pleasant sensation - something else that was happening more and more, as time went on-
just punched Adam for that – if Adam hadn’t turned away at just that moment, and pulled something like a smartphone out of his pocket. “But, fine…” He muttered, typing a code onto the screen in front of him. “We’ll just do it the long-winded way….”
And he turned to look at Steve… Flushed, and a little breathless, scanning the room with wide, endearingly innocent eyes – as
Steve had never slowed down for anyone on his way to Sunday school, and, while history might have it that he was just too well behaved and pure minded for such things, the truth was that he’d never liked anyone enough to be late for. He’d never known the simple thrill of a crush, the energy of wanting someone's attention… The pleasure of enjoying someone's company, and hoping that they enjoyed his.
He was looking forward to seeing Steve again. He’d spent the whole day happily thinking about the things they’d talked about, and wondering what sort of week Steve had, and remembering things he’d thought of saying to him, over the last few days.
...Something stirred beneath Steve’s skin. A recognition and a longing, both physical and emotional... Like hunger pains triggered by a familiar taste…
This is as bad as the former black ops agent who thought everyone deserved to have their lives ruined
And, sure enough – just like Tony said – after a while, she seemed to run out of words. Eventually, she just looked up at him, her whole body still alive with a desire, a
to be the person who get’s helped and supported and understood, I don’t want to be a… I want to be your boyfriend. I want… I just want to be nice to you.”
...He just didn’t like the person he’d started to become, when he was around her. He didn’t like the role he felt obliged to play, the constant awareness that hummed behind every moment spent in her company-
Instinctively, he looked for exits and vantage points – the same way Tony counted happy prime numbers to ward of an anxiety attack. Something he was familiar with. Just something he could do with his head.
Or whether he was still too hurt to let it go, even now. If he was too upset to enjoy himself in this moment. If doing this, or even
“So, uh, to confirm,” he managed, sounding distant and spacey, even to himself. “The serum was based on vampire blood, and when the US Army said ‘super soldier’, they really meant ‘vampire’... And as well as being faster and stronger and smarter, you also drink blood and barely breathe and might live forever. And it’s possible that it affects the people you fall in love with, but you don’t know how.”
right, and you’ve no qualms about taking it upon yourself to stop me – making a choice for the entire world, in the same way I have, I might add. And if you can do that, and be quite so sure, and not consider yourselves arrogant, then why should I?”
the way his body pulled towards Steve - he liked giving into it. It felt natural and comfortable and
His mind burst into worst-case scenarios - or possibly the worst of his battle memories - as he braced for the familiar onslaught of information, the rush to process it in time
But Tony managed to contain it. He remembered that he’d made an ass of himself the last time Steve took him by surprise, that he’d
was familiar. This spark of inspiration, flaring into something bigger, triggering a hundred other ideas. This understanding of science, this process of figuring things out, this feeling that came with a technical challenge – this felt safe, and certain, and fundamentally
He’d prepared himself for that revelation. His six months of planning for this moment had included a lot of honest thinking; many frustrating, sleepless nights going over the most shameful of his regrets and facing the worst of his fears - all so he could be as ready as possible for this new start. In amongst all that, there was the acceptance that some things would never be better-
all the things about you that are so amazing. I’m sorry I never once said well done, or – that I just…
His body softened under Tony’s hands, his frightened gasping eased into hard, ragged breaths. And Tony just stroked his hair, and kissed the side of his face very softly, and didn’t stop to think that he’d never usually do this. And then he heard the slightest edge of relief on Steve’s breathing, he
“You’re not being concerned and protective now, are you Tony?” Steve teased, unable to contain the burst of affection. Even in this light, he could see Tony blushing.
kick himself for that later. But right now, he had to say something. “I mean, I’ve been to some pretty fancy places – I’ve
“Sorry, I just meant… That was probably an awkward…” Tony stuttered. “I mean, if you’re thinking that I’ve just massively misinterpreted and now you’re going to have to reject me at a vulnerable time or – I haven’t, I know, I didn’t mean to… I’m not going to feel rejected-”
“Yeah - on the condition that I can also ask lots of questions about digital tape brain guy,” Tony added brightly.
It was only an echo at this stage. A basic instinct. Just trying to contain himself, just for a minute, just because some little part of him remembered you were supposed to – even though Tony was already trying to move against him, a desperate, pleading edge on his shallow breathing,
“...Let’s go for a walk on the beach,” Tony suggested, shooting an accusatory glare at the inside of the house. “I’ve… got an idea that I want to talk to you about.”
Steve felt an inch of relief as he registered how much sense that made. That it did explain this strange feeling of purely physical weakness-
Heart beating hard in his ears, Steve made a run for the back of the room – keeping his body low and his movements fluid, calculating the maximum cover as he went. He was greatly relieved to find that his stealth was more a question of intelligence than strength. Okay, he couldn’t push himself forward quite as quickly as he would’ve liked – but he still

And Tony was… amazing. Astounding. Wonderful. More than Steve had ever known, even in all those years of pining-
Tony wanted to be appalled by that thought. He wanted the simplicity of knowing. But all he got was a strangely compelling queasiness, and a thrill of fear.
Slowly, Tony was beginning to see the real meaning in all of this - that Steve was something other than human, that it
Bucky had never spent time with anyone who had that quality. He loved Steve dearly, of course… But awkward,

“So, we, uh, should probably talk…” Tony mumbled, running a hand through his hair. Trying to think how he’d planned to start this thing before he got all love-struck and giddy… “I… feel like there’s some stuff I need to apologise for…”
And he’d forgotten all about not knowing what to do with his hands. He’d forgotten all the questions that had once made him hesitate, all the outcomes he’d ever worried about avoiding.
He felt Steve melt under his touch, like his body was responding directly. Tony stroked his hands down over Steve’s thighs, Steve’s legs falling further apart at the slightest suggestion, his head falling back against the sheets… baring his neck again…
I said sorry about the secret, the thing I did, at the time – I don’t just mean that. I mean – I lied to you, then. I didn’t
“Oh God, so good,” he whined, tears stinging at the corner of his eyes. Steve let go of an animal growl and dug his fingertips into the sensitive flesh above Tony’s hipbone, sending sharp shocks of pleasure down through his thighs. Tony could hear his breath shaking. He could feel Steve’s cock pulsing inside him. “Let go sweetheart,” Tony whispered, rocking against him very gently-
“Eight thirty-seven am, Sir,” JARVIS replied, and then pre-empted the next question. “You fell asleep just after ten last night.”

“There aren’t any,” Tony cut her off – because, of course, it would’ve come up when he was obsessing over Steve. And, anyway- “They’d need a big location, somewhere isolated, to do work like this – wherever this flyer was produced, its not in New York City. Probably not somewhere they’ve admitted to. They must have another base, somewhere we don’t know about, somewhere they have him right now…”

to say. That Steve had stopped Tony from sharing a deep and sensitive fear, with something that sounded like a debate rebuttal… He remembered the trauma and personal history that underpinned this for Tony – that Steve had been in the middle of reminding himself about that very fact, when his emotions kicked in-
Apparently, this drug just took whatever idea was in your mind – whether it was one you were trying to hold on to, or one that had a hold of you – and
