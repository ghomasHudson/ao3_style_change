Once Mary had ducked out of the room, Sherlock sighed and sank further into his chair, crossing one leg over the other and steepling his fingers, thinking. “John, I’m going to tell you this now, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t bother trying to argue with me. If Moriarty takes either you or Hamish, or
“He’s fine; in the kitchen now,” Jim said. “I told him you were delivering an important message for me in Cork.” He cocked his head to the side, his mouth curling into a small smile. “Which, I suppose you
John and Sherlock looked at each other, and Craig rose and picked up Alfie, apparently sensing that they needed to talk. “I’ll just be in the kitchen if you need me,” he said, then disappeared.
“Ooh, yes!”
“A fight.” Hamish didn’t take his eyes of John and Sherlock.
“Not funny.”
Then came “A Study in Scarlet,” changed dramatically from John’s original story—“But seriously, where did the Mormons come from?”, John had asked incredulously when he’d read it—and Sherlock found himself with a steady stream of clientele coming directly to Baker Street for his help in an assortment of crimes, puzzles, and mysteries.
“Although I imagine for you, you’ll be away for far longer,” Sherlock said.
“Speaking of your Dad, Hamish, I think we deserve some answers…don’t we, Doctor? The main one being, how did John and I come to have a
John didn’t say anything more as he finished his push-ups. He was at the point where he could do fifty without much of a struggle. By the time he was done, Jim had slid out of bed and was tossing on a clean pair of trousers. “Your assignment today is to terminate O’Seanassy. He’s been getting on my nerves.” He scratched the back of his head as he looked through his wardrobe. “He’s been embezzling, naughty boy. He’ll be over around noon. You can do it then if you like, just don’t spatter any blood on the furnishings. Jane’s still trying to get that bloody stain out of the sofa.
To make matters worse, one day they received a note with their mail that said, “See you soon. xx JM.”
“Brixton, the very place Charlotte called from.” Sherlock yanked on his coat as well. “Six disappearances, right where she saw a bunch of stone angels.”
But no, he finally reached over and untied John's gag, then untied his wrists. Once they were free, John collapsed face-first, gasping in air and clawing off the rope around his neck. He weakly pushed the ropes off the bed with his foot, then lay, too weak and sore to move.
John was whimpering now, making noises that he had hoped Sherlock would never, ever hear.
John came back with some cocoa and laughed aloud at what a perfect mimic Hamish was doing. He set the cocoa down and set about making himself some tea, humming without realizing he was doing so. He felt comfortable in a way he hadn’t before, even with the ominous stone angels in their flat.
“Oooh, certain academics would be high-fiving right now if they heard that,” the Doctor grinned. “At any rate, what was created was not a clone of
Sherlock gave a short, annoyed sigh. “I haven’t got a favorite dish. Eating for enjoyment expends energy that could be spent on more productive things. It’s transport. Fuel. Nothing more.
“I kind of like it when you’re an arrogant dick,” he murmured into Sherlock’s ear, then kissed behind his ear as Sherlock began tuning his violin.
Sherlock gave a brief twitch of a smile. He was, in some dark way, glad to see the consulting criminal again as well.
During the three days John spent extra time with Hamish and thought endlessly of Sherlock. He almost felt like a free man. He wanted to write to him. He wanted to
I’ll tell him. And I’ll be sure to give him a kiss for you as well.”
went and searched him out—
“We ought to sleep fully dressed,” he said. “If the angels come, we don’t want to get sent back in nothing but our skin.”
“Probably because it sounds mental,” John said.
Sherlock stared at the fireplace. “Unfortunately for you, that’s not your call. Jim won’t care if you want to be traded or not. It’s my decision. I just thought you should know my intentions, should it happen.”
“Oh. So you
Mycroft cleared his throat, stared at the floor for a moment, as if wrestling something in his mind, then finally stood. “This is it, then? I won’t see you again?”
“Doctor! I’m so glad to see you! I’ve missed you very very much! 1895 is brilliant! The schools are so funny, and my dads wear hats
“As if you could,” John said breathily, closing his eyes. “I’m not your slave. Even if I don’t mind being ordered around every now and then.”
Brenetta Lave was unable to give them any further information about Torchwood, The Doctor, or his blue box, but she did finally, after much coersion, pass on a phone number and a name of someone who might be able to help.
Sherlock’s anger resurfaced. “Unfair?
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I know I am. It’s very cute.”
know when my birthday is?”
“Shit,” John muttered.
They made a sort of nest for themselves out of the sheets, and their overclothes, burrowing against each other for warmth on the hard floor.
“More than any old gunman. The best. My right-hand man. My bodyguard.” Jim put the hookah pipe down and rose, walking slowly past John, letting his fingers drag across the back of John’s shoulders. “Want to know why I lured you here, John?”
Sherlock stared back, blinking deliberately, as if not trusting his eyes that John was really there.
Duncan shook his head mournfully. “Why would somebody put a box on the sidewalk and move it a couple hours later?”
“I didn’t see, sir. It was dropped through the mail slot with the other letters, and I assumed it was some sort of calling card. Who’s ‘JM’?”
While Sherlock was gone, John and Hamish returned to Mr. Doyle’s apartment, and John began recounting his first time meeting Sherlock, hastily changing a few modern details or leaving them out to let the author fill in the gaps.
of your guardians,” Sherlock said. “Tell us more about their friend.”
Since Sherlock refused to introduce him further, John held out his hand. “Dr. John Watson. Pleasure to meet you.”
“Do what he says, John,” Sherlock forced out, his voice barely audible.
“I say whatever I want all the time,” Sherlock pointed out, then added sardonically, “I believe you called that ‘being a dick.’”
“Brilliant; that’s Dad’s favorite, isn’t it, Dad?”
Sherlock hungrily looked around, finding the flat harder to decipher than he was used to, since so many of the items were out of his historical context. “What are you writing?” he couldn’t help asking.
“Do I remember? Darling, you’re killing me! Of course I do. What’s going on?”
“Well, add ‘Milton Bradley’ to your list of enemies, then, and meanwhile I can win the game by guessing Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the lead pipe.”
“God—John,” Sherlock muttered as they kept going, the joy inside him tightening and building. “Fuck.”
“Don’t mistake intelligence for cheekiness, John,” Sherlock said aloud. “It would seem we’ve got a proper genius on our hands. I imagine you’re top of the class.”
Sherlock, having put together most of the pieces himself, didn’t enjoy hearing what John had had to do, but understood completely why he had. He was mixed with jealousy and pride that John had managed to fool James Moriarty.
“Why does it smell so bad here?” Hamish asked.
“Go ‘way, Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock called out.
Jim winced as his head slammed against the wall. “Um,
“Not…exactly,” John sighed.
John felt himself redden as Sherlock peeled off his shirt. Why? There was nothing to be embarrassed about. Still, he could feel his ears growing hot. He averted his eyes and snatched up the newspaper he’d just wrenched away from Sherlock, then settled in his chair. He could hear Sherlock in the kitchen, stirring something. Cumin in the cold tea, most bloody likely. He glanced up at Sherlock a couple times, his foot jiggling.
,” the Doctor said, raising his voice. “It
“You must trust me, Sherlock. Otherwise all of this ceases to exist, and you, along with everything you know, will disappear, a lost pocket of history with you trapped inside. You have one of the greatest minds on the planet and you choose to use it to help people. I know what you would give to save the life of a friend. I also know you won’t condemn millions to cease existing for selfish reasons.”
Breathing hard, Jim snapped, “On your hands and knees.”
“I’m sorry. What did Sebastian call you?”
the case, then, in theory, we would’ve already been sent back in time and the museum would be here. The books would be here, but they aren’t.”
John yelled at the page in the book.
. I might like to raise Hamish by myself. It’s your call, Doctor Watson.”
John alternated between kissing Sherlock—God, even when he was mad he couldn’t get enough—and trying to struggle away from him so he could defend himself. He finally pushed him away. “I was just—being friendly! Sherlock, you
He rolled back over towards John, pulling his face toward him and kissing him. “Never like that, hmm? I hope that’s a good thing.”
“These are tight times for all of us. What makes you so sure?” Doyle asked, narrowing his eyes.
John’s mouth was dry as he examined the bullet wounds. It wasn’t a lethal shot by any means, but Jim had lost a great deal of blood. What if he couldn’t save him? Would Jim’s men ever believe him? There wasn’t an exit wound for either bullet, so he carefully extracted the second bullet, then cleaned, disinfected, and tidily patched up the wounds with some neat stitches.
Mycroft heaved a massive sigh, caving. "
are going to come and transport us back in time where we will be stuck for the rest of our lives.”
! Don’t try and distract me.” He whined, annoyed, “You’re ruining my build up to your death! Can’t you just shut up for a moment? I’m going to have to start all over now!”
The faint righteous look that was permanently etched on Mycroft’s face disappeared and he set down the glass of Scotch he’d been holding. He grasped for words for a moment, looking down at his shoes, then back up to John, his voice level. “I’ll want to see the scans, obviously. …I presume he doesn’t know you’re here, otherwise he could elect to tell me himself.”
“And you’ve been flirting with her since
Sherlock examined the picture carefully, and John noticed the space mobile above the bed. “Sherlock, look.
. I’m an esteemed professor here, you forget.”
Sherlock didn’t have to consider this deeply to know that he wouldn’t leave a puzzling case, no matter how irrelevant it was to the larger society.
“There’s a good girl.” Jim smiled and handed her his hat, then ran his palms across his hair and set up the stairs. He didn’t bother to knock, simply pushing the door open to find Sherlock idly plucking the strings of his new violin, his slender back to the door. Sherlock didn’t turn around at the sound of the door opening. “Jim. Apologies for not putting the kettle on.”
Mycroft studied the spastic lines sprawling over his brother’s brain. “And there’s no treatment?” he said, finally handing it back to John.
“Learning the violin! We missed you very much here, Hamish.”
Sherlock sat back in his chair, frustrated. “This is absurd. Is that all you can tell me?”
“I’m good, I just…I can’t quite…that. Was.
John sighed and stared at the ceiling. Some things—like Sherlock being an oblivious twat—never changed.
“How’s Hamish?” John asked, coughing from the small amount of talking. He tried to clear his throat and found it extremely painful.
Sherlock gave John such a piercing look that John lost all words and accusations, and he helped Sherlock in undoing the buttons to his shirt, his fingers shaking. Once he’d yanked it off, their pressed themselves together once more, shuddering as their bare torsos pressed against each other. The skin on skin contact was intoxicating, and words were lost as they fumbled at each other, clawing at each other’s hair, running hands down each other’s skin, yanking at belts and waistbands and finally tumbling into the bedroom.
“Is that--?” John
Jim sat back in his chair and looked up at John darkly. He tapped his fingers on his desk. “Obviously you would. Anything to keep your precious Sherlock and Hamish safe from my evil grasp, isn’t that right?”
John stumbled black, clutching his face, fighting back every urge to swing back at Jim. He finally muttered angrily, “Won’t happen again, boss.”
“It’s absurd, but John, it all fits.” Sherlock was perched in his chair, tapping his fingers together. He snorted. “Can you imagine actually
“When? When you kissed me?”
Jack laughed. "It's a bit like chasing a ghost, but sometimes it works. It all gets a bit muddled…"
“Ever played Russian Roulette, John?” Jim asked, beginning to fuck him slowly, keeping the gun shoved into John’s mouth.
They kept a firm grip on each others’ hands as they crept toward the bedroom, John looking forward and Sherlock looking backward to keep his eyes fixed on the angel.
be? A simple grab and switch? No, no, no…not my style at
"That man was supposedly in 1995 this morning. That man is supposedly immportal. That man has a massive crush on you. Sherlock, when did our lives go from moderately crazy to downright loopy?"
! We can’t leave yet! I was going to show you my dormitory and the dining hall!”
“That’s when I decided I liked you.” Jim contemplatively took another drag from the hookah, letting the smoke seep out of his mouth, sucking it back in through his nose, and out his mouth again. “Did you ever meet my Sebastian, John?”
“Why are you so
Hamish’s eyes welled with tears and he hugged the Doctor tightly. “I’ll miss you, if I don’t ever see you.”
“I’m not calm, John,” he said from the doorway. “I just don’t know what to do.” Sherlock looked around his bedroom, memorizing it.
Sherlock was completely taken aback and stumbled backwards, mouth open in shock. John wanted to hit himself. Stupid,
What did Jim want to hear? “Yes,” John choked out. It wasn’t a lie.
“Its’ fine, just fine. Only be more careful next time,” Doyle said, his annoyance fading.
“Yes. We’d still love to have you around, Hamish especially. We both want what’s best for him. We just…we just want to be a family.”
It doesn’t take much spying to figure out what’s going on, John!” Sherlock’s voice rose. “How long have you been planning on snogging her, then?”
In the cab, Sherlock watched Victorian London pass by. He looked at each person they passed, calculating, annoyed that they weren’t quite as easy to read as he was used to. The basics were all still the same, however, he was happy to find. The apple vendor was having an affair, obviously. The shop on the corner had recently come under new management. Still, there was much to learn.
“Jane. I have a question.”
Once Jim had yanked off his belt, he swung the buckled end against John’s face, leaving an angry red welt against John’s cheek. John cried out in pain and surprise, clutching his face.
“Sally,” Sherlock said curtly. “You’ve talked to other flat residents, I presume. Have any of them seen anyone move the statues?”
Sherlock pulled away long enough to raise an eyebrow down at John. “Is that so? Take off your belt.” He clamped his mouth against John’s, arching his back away from him so John could obey.
“Oh?” John turned to look at Sherlock, eyes raised and a smile cocked.
Sherlock never expected his case to zig-zag in an entirely new direction so rapidly as it did the following week, however, when he and John were coming home from a secondary, more straightforward case that Sherlock had taken on.
Doyle stuttered, torn between his instinct to turn conversation back to more proper subjects and his relish for such a juicy story. “There have been five in the past month—all the victims took a knife to the heart
“Mmm. You can see why I never bother dressing unless I have to,” Sherlock mumbled, rolling off the bed. He yanked on his pants and trousers, then tossed John’s things to him. “Decency laws—entirely stupid,” he sighed, falling onto the bed again once he had his shirt and suit back on.
Molly looked between them, startled. “Both? I mean—I can…take the floor if one of you wants my bed.”
Sherlock gave a hesitant, stiff nod. “Right.” He looked over at John. “Are you in?”
John kneeled in front of Hamish, trying to explain about the stone angels and the cracks and the universe and the Doctor’s part in it all. It was a lot to take in, and he searched Hamish’s face when all was said. “We’re all going to have to blink together, you see. If the angels are in fact down there.”
Sherlock pushed two fingers against the outside of John’s hole, the slowly pushed in, waiting for John’s muscles to stop spasming.
(See the end of the chapter for
without the bullet holes in it,” Sherlock muttered.
“Oh, it’s nothing, really. As long as you know the right grocers and markets to go to...I’m happy to help.” Sherlock glanced her way and she blinked a couple times, looking embarrassed and a trifle uncomfortable. She turned her attention back to Hamish. “If you help me in the kitchen, I’ll let you sample everything before we serve it.”
Sherlock’s grin faded. “Aneurysm stays,” he said. “There were more than two angels at Barrington Arms, and for all we know, there are even more out there. I don’t want to get too comfortable and then be caught off guard.”
“A robbery, with two homicides. Will you come?”
Jim’s black gaze caught John’s eyes and a small smile played at his lips. John knew he’d tripped a wire and cursed himself for letting his tongue slip.
"Apparently he's called 'The Doctor,'" Sherlock said, bursting through the door.
Sherlock closed his eyes as John’s lips brushed against his chin. Was this what it felt like to be adored? It was entirely engrossing. He would have to be careful, or it could consume him. He’d kept away from love for that very reason. Now, however, he was beginning to think the risk was worth the feeling of happiness that bubbled up inside him whenever John was near.
Sherlock shrugged off his robe and peeled off the wet shirt, then looked anxiously in the mug. “Thank God, there’s some left.”
John gave a muffled, pleading yell, shaking his head back and forth frantically and yanking as hard as he could against his restraints. He was utterly trapped and overwhelmingly full, to the point where he could barely think straight.
"Yeah, he's got this thing he does: changes his entire cellular structure if he's about to die," Jack explained. "All Time Lords could do it."
taking care of him. I can’t be bothered to regale him with one of my cases every time I walk out the door,” Sherlock said bitterly. “There’s been nothing since the Belgravia Slasher. I’m going mad sitting in here day after day without anything to do. No violin, no books, no equipment, no
“I tried to help him but I think…I think he needs you, John.”
"Go ahead, then," Ursula said, looking the detective up and down curiously. Elton handed her over, and Sherlock ran his hands along the corners and back, searching for some sort of mechanism that would allow the oddity to be explained.
“Nnngh, John…” Jim murmured softly.
“Sorry, I haven’t got a string of lovers like you with your ‘ladykiller charm’ and army-doctor-captain-rank-pulling..” he floundered for a word. “Sexiness.”
John made a muffled groan as the barrel shoved in. His breathing was rapid and shallow through his nose, and he clenched his eyes shut.
After a moment he said goodnight the same way he had the night before. “Snore and I’ll stab you.”
"Jack Harkness, I presume," Sherlock said, assessing him.
“Arthur Conan Doyle?” Sherlock said with a hint of a sneer. “Is that what you do in the evening? Peddle your tales to him?”
"Well, depends on where in his time stream he is. He's a time traveler, isn't he? His timeline doesn't follow a neat, straight line. I could see him today and he could be 926, and I could see him tomorrow at 903."
wither you when you do.” He held John’s gaze a moment longer, making sure the message sank in, then leaned his head down and placed a gentle kiss on John’s lips, lingering a moment, eyes closed; before pulling back to look at him again.
There was a tentative knock on the door then, and Mrs. Hudson’s voice called out, “Boys? Mind if I come in?”
The Doctor grinned, clapped him on the shoulder, then disappeared up the steps, calling, “I think I last saw the book in the squash courts, or possibly the reptile enclosure! Back in a mo’!” His voice faded deep into the TARDIS.
Mrs. Hudson’s flat. The place was entirely unrecognizable, however. Gone were the settees and the knit kettle cozies, replaced with dark wooden furniture, kerosene lamps, Persian rugs, and patterned wallpaper.
“Why’re you staring at me?” Hamish frowned.
“Get your clothes off.”
“I can read you, John Watson,” Jim said. “You’re still terrified of me. Smart man.”
“Goodnight, John.”
“I don’t think that Sherlock knows that you think about him nearly every time that you masturbate, either,” he said.
Sherlock was perched in his chair, grimacing at the fireplace. “Mmm, I wish there was. Let me know if there’s anything in the paper worth mentioning. And by that, I mean at
John stared at him in disbelief for a moment. He dropped his voice and said condescendingly, “Well,
Sherlock sat back in his chair, pursing his lips in annoyance. “Jim Moriarty. An old acquaintance. He’s a professor at Hamish’s old school.” He proceeded to give her a brief but detailed description of his appearance. Mary was taken aback when Sherlock continued with great earnestness, “Mary, if this man comes to the door, you are not, under any circumstances, to let him in. Do you understand me? The only exception is if
“I want to say goodbye to London,” Sherlock said, disgusted at how sentimental it sounded. “
“To 1895!” John and Sherlock clinked their pint glasses together. It was a Monday evening and it was quiz night at a neighboring pub, so the two men had an entire corner of the pub to themselves.
John pushed open the bedroom door with dread, preparing for the worst, but he still jumped back in horror at the angel that stared right back at him. Gone was the placid, blank-eyed face that looked like any other stone angel. Its face was contorted into a frozen snarl, bearing pointed teeth and looking more like a demon or a gargoyle.
Lestrade was outside Barrington Arms to greet them when Sherlock and John got out of their cab. “Sherlock, you’re not going to believe what we found up there—“
?” Molly insisted.
to solve,” Sherlock said. “I need something that the police can’t figure out. I need to create a reputation for being smarter than them so they’ll start calling me in to consult on cases.” The thing Sherlock missed the most from the 21
“He was making fun of me! I had to clock him!” John winced, reminded of the many scrapes he’d gotten into on the playground. Hamish turned back to the two men. “What are you two doing here? Are you my dads?”
century’s standards. And I want your son. Hamish has potential. Then again, any spawn of Sherlock’s would, am I right?” He leaned in to take another drag from the hookah as John stared at him, flabbergasted.
Jim grinned. John’s armor was weakening steadily.
“Where are we?” Hamish asked.
“I don’t even know what that is,” Sherlock sniffed.
“Disappear
?” Hamish asked.
“Three bullets…that gives you a 50/50 chance,” Jim mused, fucking John harder now, cocking the gun. “If you would’ve killed him with one bullet, I would’ve only loaded it with one…tsk. Too bad for you.”
“So you’ll come?” Hamish asked eagerly.
The stone angel stood between the desk and the kitchen, staring blank-eyed straight ahead, one arm reaching out towards John. Sherlock fixed his eyes on it immediately.
"They don't know, or it doesn't say here," John said, leaning over Sherlock's shoulder to look at the screen once more. "It hasn't been updated in years."
every time. It’s not logical.” He slammed his game piece onto a spot on the board.
John groaned against Sherlock’s lips, furiously ripping at the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt, running his free hand over Sherlock’s throat and squeezing it briefly. Once their shirts had been cast onto the floor, John rolled over to pin Sherlock to the bed, forcing his head back so he could bite and lick up Sherlock’s neck, digging his nails into Sherlock’s arms.
feel if I started spending more time with her than
Just as John opened his own mouth to allow his own tongue to meet Sherlock’s, Sherlock pulled away and stuck the scarf in John’s mouth, wrapping it around John’s head and knotting it to gag him tightly.
John was whispering now. He knew he was blantantly staring at Sherlock’s mouth, but he couldn’t pull his eyes away. “Sherlock, we can’t, we’re not actually going to—“
interesting things about you, John…” Magnussen said, carefully loosening his necktie behind him.
“At the moment, I think a bit of alcohol would agree with me.”
“I’m not implying
Jim spit out the name in disgust. “No, no, no. The Master. Not a name I reserve for anyone aside from myself, normally, but he
? What signs?”
In the morning, it was as if nothing had happened. Jim was back to his dangerous, mood-swinging self, but he didn't mention the night's activities, only sent John out on an assignment. John used the time to send the letter to Sherlock.
John used the fire lie once again to explain why they had no property to speak of. Mary’s eyes widened in sympathy.
“Jim, please…” John breathed, but he didn’t know whether he was begging Jim to let him go or to keep going. It was like being trapped in a violent maelstrom.
The young boy leaned in confidentially towards Sherlock. “He always forgets my age.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw, annoyed to no end that tears were stinging his eyes. His stupid, arrogant, older brother. What good would it do, being upset that he wouldn’t see him again? He tried to keep his voice steady as he said, “I know I was a handful. Though I can’t say I regret pick-pocketing you all those times. It always came in handy.”
“You don’t
John clenched his eyes shut, continuing to make weak, muffled pleading noises, resting his sweaty head against the wood. His arms hung slackly. He was unable to muster the energy to keep yanking on them, and it was doing no good anyway. He waited for Jim to untie him or ungag him. There were a few terrifying moments where Jim was still, presumably sitting behind him, watching him, perhaps. Relishing in his vulnerable state. Was Jim just going to leave him like this?
John looked up, waiting.
Jim turned to leave, then pivoted back. “Oh, one more thing, almost slipped my mind! I have a message for you from John.” He grinned, then mimicked John’s voice, throwing in a few sniffles. “I’m sorry, and I’ll see you soon…” He sneered, then stepped closer. “And this is from him as well.”
John heaved a sigh, almost too annoyed to show Sherlock his surprise. He took a deep breath, then finally said, “I bought you something…”
John shivered, but didn't move from his spot or look at Jim. “What do you mean, Jim?”
still here, is the better question, Sherlock Holmes. When you leave, you close up this reality, and that’s how it should be. If you keep running…if you stay here much longer, you will rip a hole in the universe.”
Sherlock let out a short, exhausted laugh. “Lucky for us…we have the rest…of our lives…to make up for it…” He leaned over to kiss John again, dropping his face down on the pillow next to him so close their noses are almost touching. John blinked away a couple of happy tears as looked over at Sherlock, finally so close to him again, as it should be.
John considered this, finding it surprising. Even though it was Mycroft, surely Sherlock wanted some sort of face-to-face closure. He bit back his questions about it, however and asked a different one. “And how are we going to tell Mrs. Hudson?”
as you can.” Sherlock squeezed his hand.
Jim gave Sherlock a playful smile, looking almost bashfully at the floor then back up at him. “Look at you—Sherlock Holmes. I
John’s eyes were already beginning to strain. “Sherlock, what happens if I blink? It’s way down there—how’s I going to move in an eighth of a second?”
John nodded, his heart lifting at his luck, and the man rang a bell from his desk to fetch someone.
Sherlock watched John leave, annoyed, then immediately left the park and bought a pack of cigarettes. Watch John stop him.
throwing a fit,” John said, agitatedly standing up. “I just don’t know how I’m supposed to say goodbye to people! How can I do it without it being perplexing and upsetting for them? God, I can’t think about this right now.”
” before he opened the door.
“Oh, so we can add ‘comedian’ to the list now? John Watson: Army captain, doctor, bachelor and comedian?”
John squeezed them both. “We're home. We're all home.”
He glanced up at Moriarty, whose eyes were laughing at him, taunting him.
“Robbery, two deaths,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock laughed and clapped John on the shoulder, still shaky with nerves. “We’ll have to lessen the creepiness, then.” He grabbed his deerstalker from the mantel and one of John’s caps from the hat stand and flung them on the heads of each. “The deerstalker suits that angel much better than it does me.”
“We have to go where Moriarty tells us to. We have to do what he says,” John led Hamish down the hallway.
make it better,
John nodded sorrowfully. “I was sure you’d died. I don’t know how much of that conversation you heard—back with Moriarty, when he had the gun pointed at me.”
. Shall we?”
He dragged himself off the sofa and answered the door, eyes dead. “What.”
prove…anything?”
Sherlock smiled and pulled off John’s bowler hat, tossing it into the one of the chairs, then ran his hands down John’s chest, unbuttoning his waistcoat. “Somehow, I think we’ll manage,” Sherlock said.
Jim returned his lips to John's ear to whisper, “Surprise me.” John twitched a bit as Jim gently grabbed at him through his trousers and laughed softly in his ear, then swung John around so that Jim was leaning against the wall.
is this possible?”
Hamish huffily straightened his school blazer and led the march out of the room. Sherlock and John trailed behind.
When he opened the door, Jim was waiting for him, sitting on the bed. He didn't look up from examining his nails as he said in a bored tone, “Take your clothes off.” He picked a hangnail.
John closed his eyes and tilted his head as Sherlock moved his lips down his neck. He couldn’t believe this was really happening, that Sherlock was here in his arms.
“Hamish? HAMISH!” the Doctor seemed to see Hamish for the first time, and stared down at him in shock.
“Don’t touch my things. You’re ruining the dust line.” He placed it back on the mantle carefully. “I was warned that you would talk quickly, Doctor, but I didn’t expect to hear you babble nonsense. Why would my flat be a museum? And what business would I have being in 1895?”
“You’re very welcome, Mr…sorry, what were your names?”
John inhaled sharply at the sting of Sherlock’s nails and opened his eyes, staring widely into Sherlock’s. Sherlock shuddered, about to climax. “
Sherlock looked at the publishing name at the bottom of the website. "Looks like we'll be paying a visit to Mr. Elton Pope."
, Sherlock.”
he yelled.
“I don’t want you to leave me here,” Hamish said.
John had given up and hung up eventually, but he felt better knowing that he’d at least talked to her.

Sherlocl’s mouth twitched into a smile. If ever there was day for a drink, this is was it. He had been converted from an utter critic of aliens and time travel into a full-fledged believer.

“That’s a compliment, coming from him,” John assured Duncan. “Go on, it’s all right.”
“And the

“Yes, well, perhaps when we have to funds to hire you,” John mumbled.
“I’m sorry,” John sputtered out. “I wasn’t trying to cause trouble. I just had some questions and was directed to talk to him. Why—why shouldn’t I be talking to him?”
John and Sherlock followed the Doctor uncertainly inside a hallway that was eerily similar to the 221 of their day. “Who lives in the flat upstairs?” he asked the woman, who was knocking on the door that would have been Mrs. Hudson’s flat in modern day.
“You're quite sure about that?”
? Hamish…” Craig sighed.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “What do you intend to do with that,
“Well, it’s clearly making you miserable. And taking those pills isn’t going to make anything better, you know.”
Sherlock hung up his top hat and pulled off his scarf. It had begun to snow outside, flurries that danced rather than settling on the ground, the first concrete sign that winter was on its way.
“I took a brief test, was all. The requirements for medical hiring have changed a lot over the years, I’ll tell you. I had to bite my tongue from correcting them on some of the questions. But I start as surgeon on Monday!”
“Ooh, John, does this mean you’ve agreed to my little proposal?” Jim said giddily, propping John’s chin up with his hand.
on time like a bird on a twig, you can only be in it, and being in it means being rather tangled,” the Doctor rambled, checking his watch again. “Am I really two months late? At any rate, I’m fairly certain I discovered why you two don’t make any sense.”
John panted and fell backwards, catching himself with his hands. He was glad he didn’t have to swallow. He stretched his jaw and then stowed Jim away, then carefully rebuttoned Jim’s trousers and slid back up. “Was that proof enough?”
“Ooh, Arthur, I always imagined you to be a more amiable chap. Good luck on your histories.”
Sherlock steered John’s cock carefully as he lowered himself, then sat back with a groan that was half pain, half pleasure, John’s entire length inside of him.
sorry, Hamish. He was working on a case…he was shot.”
“I don’t need a
a bore.”
“I haven’t checked the bedroom yet.”
. Tell a dead man what you did to his family.”
I never did like to be over-dramatic.” The Doctor frowned, thinking. “Well, that’s not entirely true…” He muttered, as if to himself, “Maybe I should get a long, dramatic coat again. You certainly pull it off, Sherlock.”
Once the three had shuffled back out of the hallway into the street, the Doctor began pacing back and forth on the sidewalk. “Now…this is interesting. Doyle’s here, existing where he’s supposed to, but he can’t write about Sherlock Holmes because he doesn’t exist here, which means he’ll never ben famous.” He pointed to Sherlock, then prodded him in the nose, much to Sherlock’s displeasure. “
John flinched at the touch. He blinked slowly. The damn smoke was infiltrating his brain, making it hard to think straight. “To lure Sherlock, so you two can play your games and…but then why didn’t you tell
“I fail to see how that is any concern of yours, Molly. Now please. Leave. I’m
John shook his head. No, this was too much. He shifted uncomfortably. “Sherlock—“ he said softly, his voice half-pleading.
Jim didn’t say anything, but John felt his hand move below the sheets. Jim winced, then raised the knife from the covers and lifted it up above his head, still lying on his stomach. For a brief moment, John thought he was going to plunge the knife into him, but Jim stabbed it into the mattress between their pillows instead. Eyes still on John, he brought his knicked thumb up to his lips. He licked a droplet of blood from the cut. “….Good morning, John.”
? Did
John moved his hands up to Jim’s chest, digging his nails in as he pushed Jim farther in, varying the pressure of his lips and tongue. Jim moaned lowly, letting John continue for another minute or so, then suddenly growled, “Stop.”

“How was this possible? He’s nine and a half and John and I have only known each other for two years. Even taking time travel into account, it’s simply
. Taking you for example…"
John swallowed and stared at the stain on the carpet. Months ago he would’ve felt vile and disgusted after doing something like that. Now he felt nothing. It was just another task, another facet to the job. He thought vaguely that there was something wrong with that, but he didn’t let himself dwell on it.
Yet he felt it again a few days later, when John was in the kitchen conversing with Mary, leaving Sherlock studying tobacco ash varieties under his magnifying glass. He was more than glad to answer the bell when it rang; anything to distract him from John and Mary’s incessant, enthusiastic talking. He was careful to hide his elation at finding DI Gregson at the door: A Yard inspector was asking for his consultation!
“I’ll pass on a message for you. Last words.”
“We need a refuge. Don’t mind us, you can go back to bed if you’d like,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at Hamish. Hamish raised an eyebrow at Sherlock. “Would you like to see my research?”
Sherlock pressed his hand harder down on John’s neck, but only enough that John’s couldn’t freely move his head around. He dragged his teeth along John’s jaw, following the bone up to his ear. John’s breath caught as Sherlock’s tongue and then his teeth found John’s earlobe, dragging it out as his hand slid down to touch John through his pants.
Sherlock was wrong. Magnussen knew it as soon as his mind fell upon one especially interesting pressure point of John Watson’s. He walked over to one of the guards who had checked them for weapons when they had arrived, and slipped a pair of handcuffs from his pocket, then stood behind John. “Give me your wrists, John,” he said lightly.
completely follow the stories.”
He flopped back down and closed his eyes, resting his hands underneath his chin and listened, waiting intently for the sound of her retreating footsteps and the flat door closing, so that he could drift back into his hazy bubble and have a bit of peace.
is the problem?”
Sherlock cut him off. “Craig, we met Hamish today and he led us to believe you know the Doctor. Is that right?”

“Regenerated, really, not
Jim looked John up and down. John had had to dispatch three men, which had gotten messy, and he’d suffered a few bruises on his face and some shallow cuts across his arm.
"Unbelievable," John muttered as he dragged Sherlock back outside the café.
you’re just a madman with a box.”
He had grown increasingly on edge, as had John. They tried to carry on life as usual at the flat, but both were rattled by the slightest noises or shadows.
Ooh, that’s interesting…” He picked up a magnifying glass from the mantelpiece and looked through it, spinning around. “I’ve read all your stories—brilliant stuff! Best detective London will ever see.” He stopped spinning and looked up at Sherlock, grinning. Sherlock frowned at him, unsure how to handle the man who was so confidently yammering away and touching his things without the slightest hint of explanation. “Sherlock Holmes,” The Doctor said admiringly.
“Quite right,” the Doctor grinned. “See you soon, my literary impossibilities!”
“He’s just like you, Dad! He’s really smart and really interesting and he’s always pushing me to be cleverer, and he laughs when I show up the other students! You
“Right, right, 1895!” Hamish yelled as he ran back up the stairs with his suitcase.
“Who? What’s following you?” Molly asked, but Sherlock cast her a look that told her that she wasn’t going to be told, and gave a tired sigh.
How did you get in? What are you doing here?”
anything anyway. What were you trying to figure out, I wonder?” Now his laugh was cruel, and he yanked again on the rope to stop John's muffled whimper. “You aren't trying to take me down, are you? Tsk tsk tsk...that would be
He used the two-day journey to London as an opportunity to bond with the men—Hammond, Burke, and O'Connell. It would be to his advantage to get the men to trust and like him. The man made fun of him for being Moriarty's bitch, but John did his best to convince them that he was absolutely devoted and in love with Jim. That way, if someday he managed to kill Jim, the men might not immediately suspect him. He wanted to erase any motive. For the same reason, when the men mentioned Sherlock, John responded with bitterness.
“Of course not,” Sherlock lied. He couldn’t be sure. “On my count, blink.” His voice held only a slight tremor as he counted. “One…two…three…”
For the next week, Sherlock, John, and Hamish closed themselves in 221B. Sherlock took up his violin again, along with Hamish, who was starting up music lessons at his London school. John continued to tell Mr. Doyle and Mary about Sherlock’s other cases, as well as details about Dublin, leaving out the more upsetting parts of the story—parts he would relate to Sherlock later, in private.
“What are you doing?”
“Fuck off,” Jim said, snatching his hand away.
You must be curious.”
around him. Sherlock had had
Hamish ran to Sherlock’s bedroom, where the sheets were still tangled from the previous night’s activities. “Wow, this room is messy! Where am I going to sleep?”
Sherlock pulled off his coat and looked at the sofa. “That unfolds into a bed. We should both be able to fit, John.
"You've been wasting our time," John snapped. "You've given us nothing. Thanks."
“Sherlock, I heard some strange noises in the basement apartment last night. I wondered if you or John wouldn’t mind having a look. I’m worried that some animal might’ve gotten trapped down there, and I’m not up for dealing with that. My hip, you know—“
“Come along! Let’s go see who’s living in 221B, shall we?” The Doctor said, leading the way.
on its own?
Sherlock wound his scarf around his neck, scanning 221B over before he headed out the door after John. Everything was in its proper place, and everything was as it should be.
Sherlock stared him up and down for moment. He was close enough that his hot breath was hitting John’s cheek.
loathe getting my hands dirty…” He raised his finger in front of his face, examining the blood from different angles, then stared darkly into John’s eyes, singing lightly, “Oh well.”
He stood aside as Sherlock stepped warily towards the door. He expected to see Baker Street as it was five minutes ago, but he was also giddily hoping to be proved wrong.
“This way, doc.” The man grabbed the back of John’s neck and began steering him through a labyrinth of rooms, small spaces crammed with pillowed sofas and low chairs, most of them occupied by glassy-eyed people clutching at hookahs.
Sherlock moaned as John began to nibble at his ear. “Sorry,” he breathed, closing his eyes.
John’s heart went out to the soft-spoken housekeeper, who was just as trapped as John was. He reached out to touch her face with one hand, his voice gentle. “Jane, please, I’ll take care of it.” When he removed his hand he was horrified to see that he’d left a smear of blood on her cheek. He wiped it off with a dishrag, muttering apologies, then took the mop and quickly scrubbed up, disgusted with himself. He ruefully thought of Lady Macbeth, obsessively washing her hands, trying to get rid of the unseen bloodstains. John could relate. He would never be able to scrub out all the blood, even if he scoured the entire house and himself spotless.
Craig raised his eyesbrows and stepped back, allowing Sherlock and John to come inside. “Yeah, come in. Excuse the mess. I’ve been the at-home dad lately, and things’ve been—“
“Can we go see them?” the boy asked, as if they had come together on this outing in the first place.
Jim grabbed John’s tie and swung him back around to press him against the wall and licked John’s chin. “For now.” Then, as if nothing had happened, Jim dropped back into his chair and continued to write.
“Fine!” John said, frustrated. “Let’s go to St. Bart’s and poke at corpses. Will
John shook his head. “No. But we we’re going to try and find out. We still don’t know how you were created, but you’re definitely ours. Did you know Hamish is my second name?”
Sherlock told the Doctor, “I don’t follow.”
Hamish didn’t seem too upset as he said, “Oh, the doctor’s got nice friends. Sometimes Craig and Sophie let me go visit Rory and Amy—“
“So is the fact that we just
. It managed to get displayed in an esteemed museum, after all. It has, uhh, historical significance and the color use on…that one—“ He gestured vaguely at a crumbly fresco. “—It’s…really…exquisite…” John traied off lamely.
Half an hour alter, they arrived at a townhouse. It wasn’t particularly lavish or extravagant, but there was a posh, sophisticated air about it. It was one of several that Jim owned in London, but it was the one he resided in the most frequently.
you were my dads! You had to be! We match!”
Duncan scrunched up his eyes. “Not that I recall. It wasn’t such an unusual sight back then. They were all over. There might’ve been one…”
John opened the bedroom door. “She’s gone. Are you quite done sulking?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and shifted to face the ceiling. “I’m surprised I hadn’t picked up on that earlier.”
John gasped silently when Jim shifted in his sleep and he felt something hard touching him. He carefully lifted the covers, horrified, but was relieved to find only the knife, the hilt pressing against his thigh. Not wanting to get cut by the blade, John was unsure if he should reach down and take it from Jim’s loose grasp, or if he should wake Jim up and risk what Jim would be like when awoken against his will.
“Doctor, don’t say things like that, or his head will get too big for the flat. That’s what Dad says all the time.”
He grabbed John’s shoulders and kissed him. John gave a muffled noise of surprise, then pushed him away. “A kiss doesn’t qualify as an answer! You think I’d let myself be trapped in another century with a man I’d flippantly dump a month later?”
“What—what if we wake Mrs. Hudson?”
Sherlock frowned at him again, but he felt somewhat sated knowing how Hamish came into existence, even if the science of it seemed dodgy. “How did you do it? Replicate our DNA?” Sherlock asked.
John wasn’t to be paid until after the first week, and the rent on 221B was 2 guineas a week. They paid Doyle the last of his own money save for a few farthings, then stepped up to see the flat.
“Being in a haze all day and night doesn’t instill fear in anyone. Wouldn’t want to lose your reputation,” John pointed out. “Promise me you’ll lay off the drugs.”
John looked at Sherlock and nodded. Hamish danced around with glee, than ran up to put his suitcase in his bedroom.
“Moriarty’s not a professor,” John interjected. “He’s probably pretended to be, though. He took up the alias ‘Rich Brook’ and forced Sherlock to fake his own death.”
As John undressed, Jim removed his tie, waistcoat, socks, and shoes, then unbuttoned his shirt and let it hang open. Once John was fully undressed, he stood in front of Jim, awaiting orders, but Jim had an eyebrow raised and was looking expectant, and John realized Jim wanted him to initiate.
Hamish frowned and struggled away from John. “Yeah, Dad, we’re friends!”
Mary timidly entered the room a moment later, keeping close to the doorway. “Mr. Holmes…?” she ventured.
“I mean,” Jim continued, laughing, thrusting into him with full force, “The man does really
John pursed his lips, considering this. He tapped his fingers on his chair. “D’you fancy a pint?” He offered. “Regardless of how you feel about alcohol, I desperately need a drink.”
“That doesn’t make it any less impolite,” Sherlock said irritably.
Sherlock shifted his weight uncomfortably, debating what to do, then finally leaned over to place a kiss on Hamish’s forehead as well. “Sleep well. We’ll be downstairs if you need us.”
Jim breathed in through his nose. “To live,” he said. He opened his eyes and rolled them dramatically. “And to tutor bright young lads. Like Hamish.
“Exactly how far are you wanting to go, John?” Sherlock frowned.
” He stabbed his fountain pen down violently, causing a large blot on the page, then he looked up at John.
“I’ll miss the blog. And the comment section,” John offered up. “And your ambiguous texts telling me to fetch your harpoon or Google something or other. Good curry.”
“Craig and Sophie are your guardians?” John clarified.
John didn’t have much of an appetite for breakfast, but as he always did when he struggled to follow Jim’s orders, he forced vivid images of Hamish with his throat slit or Sherlock with a bullet in his head and resolved to obey.
“We never did explain about the angels, John,” Sherlock muttered.
“From the results I’m getting, I find that hard to believe,” Sherlock murmured, moving a hand up to tangle in John’s hair. “And John…the attraction is mutual.”
What’ve you done with him?”
Mary met his eye and nodded. “I understand, Mr. Holmes. Moriarty...that name sounds familiar.”
Sherlock began irritably leafing through the Sherlock Holmes stories, which he’d purloined from the console before they’d left. “Hm. Some of these quotes are identical to conversations we had.” His lip curled as he read a passage silently. “Our discussion of the solar system, for one.”
John nodded. “What tipped you off?”
“How is this fair?” John said suddenly. “You have the nerve to zip around to any time you like and force people’s lives to change? We’re becoming time refugees against our wills and you get to run to wherever and whenever you please?”
you can watch Sherlock die. And make no mistake, Doctor Watson, I
Jim growled and punched the brick next to John’s head before storming back inside.
The first thing to do, of course, was to investigate the web, but the last time he’d done that, Jim had found out. He would be more careful this time. He would, as much as it pained him, take it slow.
Sherlock let his mind wander back to the activities of the day, and how it compared to a typical day back home. He winced at thinking of the 21
Sherlock stepped away from the wall. “Do you trust Mary, John?”
“Now hold on!” he snapped. “This is utter rubbish. The Doctor came to us for the first time a month ago and more or less directed us to get out of this century as quick as we could. Why would he bother to drop our son off if he wanted us to leave?”
John strode over to grab his own coat. “Can I come?”
Sherlock struggled to free his wrists from John’s grip, but John moved to grasp both of Sherlock’s wrists with one hand, the other moving to his throat to pin it against the bed, then he licked along Sherlock’s cheekbone, traveling his mouth to his ear. “I said I’m sorry. Your turn.”
“Your frontal lobes are unusually large.” John rolled his eyes. “But then they
John groaned and opened his mouth wider, then froze when he heard voices nearing the room. He tensed as a couple passed the doorway without going in, then laughed into Sherlock’s mouth and resumed kissing.
“Yes, that’s pretty much in the job description.”
? My, my, this city shall eat you up and spit you in the Thames in less than a fortnight,” Doyle proclaimed.
times?”
right now!
—in which case the books should already be written! It doesn’t match up. It’s not cohesive.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John’s scarf. “Oh. Brilliant. And she’s made you a scarf,” he observed, then dropped his voice so Mary couldn’t hear. “Why don’t you two just get married? That’s what fine, upstanding doctors are supposed to do, aren’t they? Find a nice wife and settle down?”
Sherlock nodded weakly, and wrapped his arm around John, holding him until they both fell asleep.
“No, of course we want you to come if that’s what you want. But it’s going to be hard. We don’t know anything about parenting, and we won’t be able to tell people we’re your parents in 1895,” John explained.
“Sherlock, he’s ten. This decision is going to change his entire life!”
It was such a concise way of putting it that both of them smiled, and John dropped to one knee to hug Hamish properly.
“These are just some of the stories, and none of them are the final ones. I won’t tell you about your future too much but…do you like beekeeping?”
John didn’t respond as he packed away his med bag. Jim was trying to scare him, but John noticed that Jim hadn’t done anything major to stop him so far, and took it as a good sign. He would much rather have a preoccupied, plotting Moriarty on his hands than a bored one.
you do!”
Sherlock and John looked at each other, momentarily frozen.
ours?” John asked.
“I’m not tired,” Hamish said through a stifled yawn.
John mouthed "crackpot" to Sherlock, making him smirk.
Sherlock restrained John as he lunged forward again, then smirked at Jim. “We’ll be keeping a close eye on
!” It was then that Jim noticed John sitting stone-faced, in the corner of the room, watching him.
“Go. Away,” Sherlock growled.
When Sherlock finally came, John pulled away and finished himself, gasping into Sherlock’s hip, then drew himself up to Sherlock’s mouth and kissed him. “Apology accepted?”
“All those crimes. The faceless ‘Professor’ organizing dozens of crimes throughout the city. It was you,” Sherlock muttered. “I’m glad you’re entertaining yourself,
A couple of pints apiece later, both John and Sherlock were pleasantly buzzed, John moreso. Sherlocked noticed how unsteady John was when they got to their feet to head back.
John and Sherlock exchanged glances as Elton led them upstairs. "No photos. I want my love life kept private, thanks." He knocked on his bedroom door. "Ursula, love, we've got guests. A detective a…erm…doctor."
John’s face broke into a smile, and he caught Sherlock’s chin with his hand and kissed him. “Promise me one thing, though. That we won’t go on dates. I’m notoriously rubbish at them…unless crime scenes and late-night Chinese food count as dates. Those’re fine.”
“You belong in that century, Sherlock. In the full universe, you are
When Sherlock returned home far after dark, John was in his chair, reading. It was the first time Sherlock had seen him looking settled in the flat since the kiss.
“Because 1895 could be around the corner. We just can’t be sure, Hamish, so it’s best you put yours on, too.”
Sherlock smiled too and hurriedly wiped his eyes. “While we’re coming clean…your rabbit, Charleston, the gray one that died over summer hols back when I was still in primary—that was my fault. I was running an experiment on it, trying to control animal’s emotional responses—“
They stood where they were for a moment. “John…you’re still holding my arm.”
Sherlock and John stood staring at the man for a moment, not saying anything. Sherlock finally stepped forward, looking the man up and down. “The Doctor,” he said, hardly believing it was really him.
“Right,” Sherlock said gravely, meeting John’s eyes, then slowly leaned in to kiss him, grateful for some distraction from all of this.
Sherlock didn’t look up from his notes. “I am well aware that she is gone.”
The man was still grinning obscenely at him. John wanted to punch him, but he merely spat out, “Lead on, you stupid wretch.”
“Sherlock—“ John said nervously. How had this made the situation better?
Sherlock moaned and moved his foot along John’s ankle. John sucked faster, tightening his lips around Sherlock, then reached a hand down to touch himself, sucking and pumping the base of Sherlock’s cock with his free hand.
“Well! Come back at the end of the day with a job contract from at least one of you, and then perhaps we’ll talk about letting the flat.”
and you can never have seconds—not that you’d want to. My friend Robert told me they put crushed worms in the gravy.”
Elton beamed. "You know, if it wasn't for the Doctor, we never would've met."
The question caught John off-guard, but luckily he couldn’t enunciate anything more than a muffled groan with a gun barrel tickling the back of his throat anyway.
"Ursula, yeah! My girlfriend. Want to meet her?" Elton's face had brightened.
John shook his head, unable to believe they were having this conversation. “We say goodbye and then…we just give in?”
Jim’s lips curled into an amused smile and he gently plucked John’s fingers from his suit. “You see,
How about the fact that you two are tangled in a sweet, forbidden love affair and caring for a
, you
Sherlock obliges, shoving the hat down on his head and bore it for a few seconds while Hamish grinned in delight. “Wow…I have a famous dad,” he breathed.
Sherlock groaned and dug his fingers into John’s shoulders, wanting more friction.
Jim headed into the kitchen to get a bite to eat. Jane, who was standing over the stove making porridge, glanced at her shirtless boss and blushed, averting her eyes to the floor.
“Thank you for coming up, Mrs. Hudson. Don’t you have some baking to do?”
"Don't. Really," John interrupted. "Now, in your vlog…you show your girlfriend, Ursula?"
"Ooh, tell him about Torchwood!" Ursula suggested.
John moaned, half out of frustration, half from anticipation and croaked out a yes. He forced himself to stop grinding and writhing, his wrists still strained against Sherlock’s hand.
"Torchwood."
“You really did. I’m quite the catch. Intelligent and sexy, as I’ve been told by multiple sources.”
Hamish sprang into Sherlock’s arms, hugging him tightly, and Sherlock, after a moment of surprise, wrapped his arms around him. John smiled and wondered if Sherlock had ever hugged a child before. Evidently not, judging by the way he was looking at John, as if to ask, “Am I doing this right?”
“Oh! You’re a doctor as well? You must lead a busy life with two jobs,” Mrs. Hudson interjected cheerfully.
John gave a hopeless laugh. “So do I.”
“I followed him out of the gambling house, tracked his route, found a high-up secluded location and fired. Clean shot through the head. Left before they could determine where the shot had come from.”
Sherlock, however, didn’t even both looking up, focusing his attention on his work, though his words were more taut and he continued acting snappish for the rest of the investigation.
Jim reached out to place a hand on Hamish’s head and ran it through his hair. John’s rage flared up. He wanted to shove Moriarty away and tell him to never touch his child again, but he could only watch as Jim said in a sad voice, “Hamish, your father, Sherlock—“
Sherlock turned off his phone and leaned toward the cab driver. "Forget Baker Street. Austrian Embassy, please."
John suddenly turned Sherlock’s face toward him and stepped up on his toes to kiss him, taking him by surprise. If they were going to publicly display their affection, it had to be now. Sherlock caught John’s lip with his, moving a gloved hand to John’s face, and kissed him back. It was a comforting reminder that no matter what changed in his life, John would be there with him.
“Really? Couldn’t tell,” John said, raising his eyebrows and skimming the paper. “Maybe we should just move somewhere with more interesting crime, since you’ve locked all the decent criminals up. We could go to New York City…or Liverpool.”
John was a wreck. His breath was coming fast and part of himself wanted to lose himself to this man, to just let it happen—but the larger part was screaming to escape, to not let him win.
Craig shrugged, utterly flummoxed. “I couldn’t say. We’ve tried to do right by Hamish, but we don’t know the full story. Sophie’s an amazing mum, and even though our budget’s a bit tight, we’ve tried to give him everything he needs. But if you want him back…you have every right to do.”
John stretched and sat up. “I’ll show you. What d’you fancy? Toast and jam?”
Sherlock watched from the window as Jim got into a hansom cab and disappeared. Was John in the cab? He couldn’t bear the thought of John being so close but being unable to help him. And Hamish, too. It was too much.
we weren’t aware of?”
John dropped it as if it were made of hot iron, then backed away. “Sorry! Goodnight.”
Sherlock sank into his chair, drawing his knees up to his chest and steepling his fingers under his chin.
“Is it really that upsetting to you that I don’t want you to
“You both have to meet my favorite professor. He’s really really smart. Come on!” Hamish pulled on his parents’ sleeves, yanking them in the direction of the main hall, where the professors were milling about, having a meet and greet with the parents.
They glanced at each other briefly before racing upstairs to see the Doctor circling the stone angels, examining them closely.
Even Sherlock was dumbstruck. When he finally regained use of his voice, he held out his hands tentatively. "Uh—may I?"
“What do you mean, you’ll miss it? Is this some threat to kill me again?” Sherlock asked, disappointed. He’d expected something less dull from Jim.
. You know who goes behind a boss’s back to ask questions? Someone who’s meddling in things they shouldn’t. Now.
“Mind if I sit?”
“There's another guinea in it for you if you return with an answer to a question,” John told the boy, holding up the coin. “Ask the housekeeper, 'What's John's favourite meal?'”
“Yeah, but—just fucking do it, it’s fine,” John breathed, arching his back.
A portly, confused-looking man opened the door at the address Hamish and given them. A toddler was at his heels.
“It just…it seems uncomfortable. Aren’t you cold?”
Sherlock paced in front of him. “My reputation precedes me,” he said, a bit smugly, John thought.
John thought about it for the rest of the afternoon, pacing his living room and bedroom, walking up and down the staircase. He wondered how far he would go if it meant seeing Sherlock again. He would need to figure out what Jim wanted from him, and then give it to him as willingly as he was able.
A long-unused muscle at the corner of John’s mouth twitched in the hint of a smile, imagining what Sherlock’s response would be upon learning that Moriarty had daddy issues. The twitch was quickly gone, however, and John nodded. “Point taken, boss. It won’t happen again.”
John finally asked, “…What if we really

Amused, John stepped so that they were toe-to-toe and tilted his face up to Sherlock’s.
Moriarty was facedown on the floor, a pool of blood forming around his chest and seeping into the carpet. “How—“ John faltered, his eyes wide with shock.
Jim turned back to Sherlock. “I’m going to miss this, our games, your guesses, all the flirting…”
case to free Sherlock from the “stagnation” he was forever moaning about. John gave a chuckle as he stood up, stepping into the kitchen to snatch up one of Mary’s rolls. She gave him a sly look but didn’t stop him.
Feeling that he was intruding, John silently backed out of the door and closed it behind him. He had no idea what a Holmes farewell would entail, but he felt they should at least have some privacy.
to read, especially adventure stories and books about how things work. He’s not much one for sports, but he can run fast when he wants to! And he’s a strong little fellow.” Craig smiled. “Honestly, sometimes I have no idea what he’s talking about. And he tends to…know things. About me, about our neighbors. It’s spooky, almost, except he never tries to be mean. He’s got a good heart. He’s kind to other children and he has a few friends, but he likes his alone time. As I said before, he’s extremely gifted, especially at science.”
“How—how does one go about finding a job in London?” John asked, noticing that Sherlock had bent to whisper something in Hamish’s ear, then stood to scan the flat.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock chuckled. “I want to see his actual insides.”
John stumbled backwards into the sofa, panting. “What do you want me to do
“Hamish, do you want to play a game? We’ve got Cluedo, or cards.”
Jack grinned and pointed at John's face. "He's adorable when he's confused! I can see why you keep him around!" He leaned in confidentially once more. "Are you two together? If not…I know this great bar not far from here." He winked at Sherlock who frowned and leaned away.
John straightened, hands resting on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I don’t think you’re a dick, you
you don’t sleep well.”
John kept his eyes trained on his book. “Just that Charles Dickens is severely overrated.” He glanced up. “How was your day?”
However, the added complication to John’s life did nothing to deter him from his ultimate goal of getting to Sherlock.
like the danger. If he set his morals aside, he found the job satisfying on some base level. But he felt empty and alone without Sherlock. He had to keep satisfying Jim, John told himself, if he was ever going to get back to Sherlock.
The man pushed in after him, catching his elbow. “Woah, there, doc! Yeh might not want to be running off
Sherlock had already strode over to the box and was pounding with all of his might on the door. “
“Two,” Sherlock said into John’s mouth. “If we slide two inches to the left—“ he sidled over, pulling John with him. “We’re in the blind spot.” He clawed at John’s shoulder blades through his coat.
“Would he mind?” John asked.
Then he would go out and see Hamish, and he would see Sherlock’s eyes when Hamish looked up at him, and John would think, “I’m doing this for you. For both of you.”
“It’s in the name—relative dimension. Bit too complicated for humans. You never get the hang of this stuff, nor should you.”
never change! It’s boring, isn’t it?!”
Hamish sat back down on the bed as Sherlock began pacing and explaining everything as John sat next to him. He listened carefully as he rattled off information about how they met the Doctor, their run-ins with the weeping angels, and their plans to surrender and return to 1895.
“No, he most certainly isn’t! When I replicated your DNA, some of Watson’s was latched onto it—a particle of skin, perhaps, or—saliva,” the Doctor said, a trace of a smile on his face. “What
Meanwhile, Sherlock was perched on the bench next to Hamish, his elbows propped on his knees, steepled fingers against his lips. He glanced over at Hamish, who had taken up the same pose. “Why do you do that?” Sherlock asked curiously.
Sherlock returned fully dressed; how he’d managed it so fast was beyond John. “This is Duncan—what was your last name?”
John moved his hand back to grip Sherlock’s bum as he pulled Sherlock in deeper, pulling in and out with greater speed, easing up every so often to keep Sherlock from coming too quickly. He had forgotten how much fun giving fellatio could be when he actually cared about his partner, when he
John shook his head at him. “You never have to compete for me. It’s like I said, you have me, all of me, whether you want it or not. I’ll think of something to tell Mary. I promise.”
Sherlock moved closer, then, running a hand up John’s back, asked breathily, “Don’t they usually use—lube for this kind of thing?”
An hour later, John, Sherlock and Hamish were all crowded into Arthur Conan Doyle’s parlor, Mr. Doyle fending off a barrage of questions from Hamish as Mary set the table and John examined his bookshelf from a respectful distance.
Every week that went by without a letter made John more and more nervous. It was possible, he thought, that Jim had done something to Sherlock and was covering it up. Wouldn’t he want to gloat if that were the case, however? Either way, John had waited too long for Sherlock to help. He needed to do this himself. He began thinking seriously about the daunting task of killing Jim Moriarty.
Jim crawled to his side of the bed and slid under the covers next to John. He rolled to face him, giving him a quick peck on the cheek. “Goodnight, Johnny Boy, be good and don’t snore.” With that, Jim rolled away from John and fell asleep almost immediately.
John bit down on the gag, yelling into it as his eyes rolled up. The sensation of was incredible, and John’s breath caught even more as Sherlock began to move up and down.
,” he snarled.
“Do you get that feeling?” John asked as he pulled away. “That you could just—say whatever you want?”
Sherlock looked between the two of them, then said coldly, “It’s fine, I’m not hungry anyway.”
“That’s not good enough!” Jim barked, grabbing John and punching him again in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. “FIGHT ME BACK! FIGHT ME BACK, YOU FUCKING
The doorknob turned slowly, then the door swung open and Molly Hooper stepped inside. “Erm…hi. I heard—I heard that John moved out, and I hadn’t heard anything from St. Bart’s, so I wanted to see if you were…okay.” She looked around the disheveled flat and pressed her lips together, taking in the unmistakable smell of cigarette smoke, the empty pill bottles and the full ashtrays littering the table, and Sherlock himself, who looked gaunt and unwell, lying glassy-eyed on the sofa.
burned the heart out of you.” Jim looked irritated, then closed his eyes for a moment, crooning, “Nooo, I didn’t get that quite right before.” He glared at Sherlock’s chest and jabbed a finger at it twice. “It’s still
Jim growled, opening John’s revolver. “Three bullets left? This was supposed to be a one-bullet job! I thought you were supposed to be
John tensed but refused to look up. “Oh?”
Sherlock was too busy looking the Doctor over, fascinated despite the absurdity of it all. He finally got out his phone and began dialing Duncan. “Does the name Duncan Reynolds II ring a bell? The Blitz in London? He says you saved his life when he was a child.”
John scrubbed his face. He would love to know the answer to that question. “We’ve no idea, except that it’ll be soon. That’s why you must say goodbye to Craig and Alfie and Sophie today. All right?”
Sherlock glared down at Hamish and the Doctor grinned, leaning against the door of the TARDIS.
There was a pause, rare in a conversation with Mycroft. He seemed genuinely surprised when he spoke again. "Goodness, who have
” he spat out. He would do anything to keep Hamish safe.
“How do I explain this? Picture a clothesline--no, it’s nothing like that, forget the clothes line. In fact, forget the whole thing. You
John took a deep breath. He would not punch Sherlock. He would talk this out rationally. “The point is, could you lay off a bit? If you’re never going to approve of any of the women I date, keep out of it!”
John turned his head so his lips were brushing Sherlock’s. “Hamish certainly sprouted up though, didn’t he?” He gave Sherlock a soft kiss, nipping at his upper lip.
“Interesting. Your life
Sherlock looked over at Hamish, realizing too late that his words had a cutting effect he didn’t intend. “That’s not what I meant, Hamish. You were a surprise to both of us, but you were…needed.” He frowned, but it was the exact word. “Sometimes…you get what you need before you realize it was what you wanted.”
Sherlock was quivering with rage. Magnussen’s command was clearly to both of them and it took all of Sherlock’s willpower to obey. He had to obey. This man could destroy them both in less than 24 hours, and they would be able to do nothing but stand by helplessly as he ground the final piece of their lives into dust.
brought me back and gave me a whole new life here.”
“No. I’m not uncomfortable, John.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him. What an asshole. “Are you?”
A few nights later, John limped home to find Jim in a violent temper. He’d already broken a number of china plates and a whisky glass, and was furiously scribbling a letter.
Jim frowned at the wall, surprised at John’s move. He had never expected to share a bed with John Watson, at least not a John Watson who was willingly there, under the pretense of
“You were wrong,” Sherlock said, watching him. “And you left because…why? You felt tormented by me? That you couldn’t have me?”
anyway?”
He met John’s eyes, stepping closer to him. “I thought I’d lost you today. When you called—“
John wished he’d slow down a bit; it was a lot for a young child to process, but Hamish was nodding and listening carefully, seemingly taking it all in stride.
to meet him!”
John clenched his jaw and looked at Jim with quiet rage.
John couldn’t do this. He used his thumb to wipe away the beginning of a tear at Hamish’s eye, then glared over at Jim. “For God’s sake, can you give us a few minutes of privacy? Can’t I comfort my son alone?”
“We don’t know,” John said. “It might not.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s neck to pull his head down until their lips were nearly touching. “You, sir, are brilliant.” He pulled Sherlock in for a kiss. Sherlock leaned into it, wrapping his arms around John, glad to finally have some alone time with him.
“If you want it, Jim, then you can have it. I'm giving it to you.”
Once out of the cab, they headed inside St. Bart’s. The old façade outside looked much the same, but the inside was much changed.
to survive?” Sherlock unlocked the door the flat and held it open for John.
“Care to change that?” John grinned cheekily.
“Tan line from the ring. Went to visit him, did you? India would be a horrible place to die.”
“We’ll sort out sleeping arrangements tonight,” John said.
Jim moaned, closing his eyes and running his hand through John’s hair before he grabbed handfuls of it as John began to bob in and out.
“This is Sherlock Holmes. We met about four months ago. Do you remember?”
“Don’t bother looking for them, Lestrade! Destroy the angels!” Sherlock called before he and John were out the door.
Sherlock took a somewhat hesitant step towards John. “If I’m wrong, consider the whole episode forgotten. I’ll never bring it up again.”
London, I mean.”
As soon as he arrived back at the townhouse—John still refused to think of it as “home”—he limped to his room and hurriedly tried to clean his battered hands and face before Hamish could see. The water in the ceramic washbasin was soon a rusty color from the blood of several different people.
“We haven’t the faintest. We didn’t even know he existed until today. And he’s been longer than we’ve known each other, so we reckoned the Doctor had something to do with it.”
“Spooky stone angels?” Sherlock asked Lestrade dully. Lestrade opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock cut him off. “Woman named Charlotte Hayle left me three voicemails. My question is, is the police force so incompetent that they don’t investigate the strange appearance of large statues that are causing someone sincere distress?”
John let out a breath, groaning each time Jim’s cock slammed into him, wanting it to be over.
Jane looked at him in surprise. She rarely heard anything out of the tacit gunman. “What is it sir?” She brushed away a strand of frizzy hair from her face.
me?” Sherlock asked. He didn’t know whether to be disgusted or proud.
“There’s a nice wide space between being an arrogant dick and ‘parading around like a moron.’ But you want to know something?” John crossed behind where Sherlock was sitting and wrapped his arms around his shoulders.
John brought Sherlock a toasted sandwich, the pinnacle of his cooking abilities, and brushed his hand against Sherlock’s as he gave him the plate. “Eat something, or you
Sherlock stared coldly back. “You must realize that saying I should trust you because you’re ‘The Doctor’ is about equivalent to saying I should trust you because you had shrimp cocktails for dinner last week—meaningless.”
As the weeks passed, sex with Jim became a routine, although it never felt routine. It was always terrifying and unsettling; Jim’s unpredictability meant John never felt at ease, but he began to learn what Jim liked and even, to his disgust, began liking it himself. Guilt would wash over him afterwards, but sometimes in the heat of the moment, John would forget about the Sherlock and disappear in the pleasure.
“I’ve already texted him. He says he can get the right people to turn a blind eye.” Sherlock rubbed his thumb over the phone, wondering if that would be the last time he ever texted Mycroft.
Sherlock strode over to the window and looked out. “I don’t see any sign of them, John. It doesn’t appear that they followed us.”
Sherlock slowly withdrew his hands, then began fervently kissing under John’s jaw and along his neck, licking just under John’s chin. He drew up again to glare down at John. “Not even a muscle. Understand?”
Ursula eyed him. "Some kind of…organization. A government thing, we think."
It would be fascinating, admit it!”
“He wants to thank you, I suppose, or at least confirm he isn’t mad, since he just saw you a few weeks back.”
John rolled his eyes as he poured his tea. “Hamish, don’t inflate your father’s ego. It’s already big enough. You’ll be bored to tears, Hamish!”
John’s breath hitched and he drew his mouth away long enough to mumble, “Did you have a task in mind or did you want me to use my imagination?”
The more he thought about it, though, the more flustered he became, and found that he couldn’t retain any words he was reading in the paper.
"I'd love to, but Torchwood is backed up right now. As Captain, I have more responisibilities than most. Now, if you two were immortal, we might be in business, because it could take a while."
They were greeted by Elton, a man in his early 30s, with very blonde hair and slight bug-eyes after John rang the doorbell. He looked between the two expectantly. "Is one of you Sherlock Holmes, then?"
“But Parents Day’s just
“Mmm…” Jim turned his head a bit to the side, allowing John easier access. “That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
,” Sherlock snapped impatiently.
John began yanking off Sherlock’s robe, letting it fall to the ground, then yanked Sherlock’s arms up and pushed his t-shirt over his head, tossing it to the ground as well. “Aren’t you supposed to be the
“Where can we go?” John asked.
John, still upset, tried to struggle away from him, his face flushed, his voice a bit softer now. “You still haven’t answered me. Kissing me doesn’t just fix the fact that you’ve been utterly ridiculous lately.”
“I make my
“So this is probably the biggest, strangest mystery you’ll ever try to solve, Sherlock. That is, if you’re willing to take it on.”
“But what about the disappearances?” Lestrade called after them as they headed down the stairs. “Where did the people go?”
The next message sounded even more desperate, from a few minutes later. “I’ve left the flat—I can’t bear to go in there. I keep trying to get the police interested, but they’re ignoring me. The angels, the stone angels—they keep moving, Mr. Holmes. Please, if you can help, call me back. Again, this is Charlotte Hayle.
?” John said.
“A historical fiction piece; I’m through with those adventure stories.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched into a smile. “About what?”
John clenched his teeth together to stop from snapping that assassinations had a lot of unseen variables. He
“Hm. Raising up a child in a different century. Could be dangerous.” Sherlock’s eyes flicked sideways to John’s, and John couldn’t help but smile.
“I hardly think it matters either way,” Sherlock muttered, then stepped inside a hallway lined with dark wood. To the left was a heavy oak door, opened to reveal a library with shelves that stretched to the ceiling. The wood floors were covered in Persian rugs, and Mycroft sat in a maroon leather armchair, a book balanced in one hand and a glass of scotch in the other.
Sherlock sighed, running his hand down John’s arm. “Where’s Hamish?”
Jim raised his eyebrows, his expression slack. “Fine, go ahead and keep that one. It’s not like I don’t have more.”
“Well, it’s not very believable, is it?” Lestrade countered. “Weird stone angels moving-“
John winced, then growled, “Jim, people are staring.”
“What do we do if he
“Aren’t you going to put a shirt on?”
The Doctor chuckled and grabbed Sherlock’s hand, yanking him inside. “This is going to blow a hole in your logic frame…”
Jim was still examining his nails, not bothering to glance up. “So...what did you do with your day off?”
“So impatient,” Sherlock teased, then reached to the bedside table and pulled out some lube. Smirking a bit, he uncapped the bottle and rubbed some along
After they’d disappeared out the door, Mary went to the window to watch the consulting detective and the doctor stride down Baker Street with the inspector, ready for every crime and every adventure.
Sherlock finally raised his eyes to look at John. “More than.”
A month went by and John made minimal progress. He was beginning to realize that Jim's web was a lot more complex than he had ever thought, but he never understood how complex until he found himself talking with a man named Dougherty, who alluded to strings of other men devoted to carrying out Jim's word. Scores of men, spread across the British Empire, a far-reaching web. After his talk with Dougherty, John came home discouraged, and tromped upstairs to get ready for bed.
John gasped in a breath as Sherlock’s hand left his throat. He tried to yank his wrists free, but they were fastened tightly and only pulled tighter as he struggled. Anyway, the bindings only served to work him up even more. His face was red and he was finding it impossible to keep his moans in check.
“This
Time can be rewritten, Mr. Holmes--can I call you Sherlock? Brilliant name, Sherlock. Time can be rewritten, but people don’t just stop existing one century and start existing in another…”
And yes, I
Fuck. Jim had found out far faster than John had anticipated. He swallowed.
The Doctor sternly approached him. “Let me make one thing clear. The one thing you must understand about me: I am
“Aliens! Finally, something fun to do!” He looked back at John as if noticing him for the first time. “Did you want something?”
off of crime, Mr. Doyle. I’m a consulting detective—the only one in the world. I invented the job. Is there more information on the case in the paper?” Sherlock asked Doyle.
” Sherlock repeated.
“And how do you know that this reality is wrong and yours is right? Who are you to say which ‘universe’ is correct?” Sherlock asked.
It wasn’t long before Sherlock had the violin tuned and was creating songs as he went, drawing the bow in long sweeps across the strings.
Sherlock nodded. “I have reason to believe the Doctor wants us banished into the past by them, and I have no intention of leaving. How are the angels destroyed?”
Creative name. Very cute.”
His eyes swept upward to see Sherlock standing in the doorway, still holding the gun toward where Moriarty had been standing.
. But I checked 1895 and you weren’t there, you simply didn’t exist. So I go to 2012 to the Sherlock Holmes museum at this address and it’s not there, it’s just...your flat.” He poked Sherlock in the chest, and Sherlock took the opportunity to snatch back his magnifying glass.
John drew his knees up to his chest, burying his head in his knees and rubbing the raw skin at his wrists, trying to take what had just happened and shoving it in some dark forgotten room of his brain. When that didn't do any good, he finally stood up and padded downstairs to write a fresh letter.
“Will a babysitter be needed?”
“Not all, but the end result was the same,” John said, working off his shirt with some difficulty. He didn’t want to undress in front of Jim, but redressing so he could see his son had taken higher priority.
Hamish cocked his head, considering. “He doesn’t make enough money, or he’s cutting corners. His haircut’s uneven, so that means he cuts it himself—or has a bad barber. But if he does cut it himself, it means he lives alone. His shoes are polished but that’s to hide that they’re old. I could see how worn down the heel was even from here!” He sat back, satisfied. “Did I miss anything?”
They stood back to back. Sherlock tapped a finger deliberately on John’s hand three times, then said, “Blink.”
“What on earth d’you—I don’t date dull women! None of them is ever going to live up to the Glorious Intellect of Sherlock Holmes, you know. One genius is more than enough to deal with.” Sherlock smiled a bit at this.
Jim's eyes glinted as he leaned forward, pushing John harder against the wall to kiss him. He muttered into John's mouth, “
to know.”
“I didn’t know you really existed! Sherlock’s never mentioned you,” Gregson said.
John stared at Jim’s back, wondering if he’d done the right thing or if he’d made a huge mistake. He hadn’t even realized he’d fallen asleep until he was startled awake by Jim’s arm flinging around him. He looked over at Jim and saw that the man was still asleep. It had been an unconscious motion.
"You already know that I'm a detective. I was hired to, obviously. You're not the only one who has had run-ins with the…man."
convinced him without a doubt that this was the same man he'd seen sixty years ago. No, John, there's something to this."
Jim eyed John somewhat suspiciously as John crossed in front of him and climbed the steps to his bedroom.
John accepted the piece of paper and broke his own rule. He asked a question. “Why does he have to die?”
"John Watson. How…did you get here so quickly?" John asked.
It was a good while before John could collect himself enough to draw back, wiping his own tears and then wiping off Hamish’s. “This isn’t the time for crying now, son. We need to be brave together, like soldiers. Can you be brave for me, Hamish?”
John reddened. The first thing that came into his mind, of course, was everyone’s assumption or sometimes, insistence, that he was gay. It annoyed John to no end, and it annoyed him even more that every time someone assumed that he and Sherlock were a couple, he felt a deep relunctance to correct them.
It was a very good question. John looked at Sherlock in hopes that would come up with some sort of logic out of this, but Sherlock ignored the question entirely. “The flat above you…is it available to let? We were thinking it would suit our needs perfectly.”
John circled the bodies as well, then took out a notepad and jotted down notes as Sherlock rattled off his observations to the astonished Gregson. John also noted that Sherlock was being more of an ass than usual, calling Gregson and idiot multiple times.
On Westminster Bridge, they stopped and stared out at the water. “Ugh. This is going to smell
"What day is it? I can meet you today, at whatever time it is now and whatever location you're at. If that's convenient."
As John began the MRI, he explained, “The image will take a while to process. In the meantime, I’ll look through the database and find a good aneurysm for you. Keep still in there.”
When the buzz came at the door, John leapt up. “Client?” He flung open the door to the flat. “For God’s sake, Sherlock, put a shirt on!”
Despite his increasingly labored breath, Jim continued his monologue. “Honestly…
of this is possible!”
while I was gone?”
“I’d have to agree with you, Hamish.” He turned to John and raised an eyebrow, knowing full well why John had chosen the room. “Perhaps John can enlighten us on why he is so fond of this particular aesthetic.”
Jim looked up, fuming, and growled, “You four are going to London.”
John had several long hours at the house before Jim returned, which he spent pacing the living room nervously. Jim always returned home armed. John would have to pretend to be relaxed until Jim disarmed for the evening before he struck.
’s cock, to John’s obvious surprise.
“I didn’t send John. He came on his own volition. I had no intention of telling you, but now that you know, I’ve come to say goodbye,” Sherlock said in an even voice. He straightened his suit cuffs. “My condition is more severe than the doctors previous thought. I have a week at most, if time is generous to me. So goodbye, Mycroft. That’s what I came to say.”
Once all of Jim’s employees had returned home that night, Jim produced a new bottle of laudanum and cast a curious eyebrow in John’s direction as he dropped a few drops onto his tongue.
Jim grunted. “Dental hygiene these days is limited enough without getting that shit anywhere near my mouth.” He stood and straightened his waistcoat, then looked down at John.
Sherlock looked up from the book he was reading and across to John, sitting in his chair with a cup of tea, exactly where he should be, and exactly how Sherlock had imagined him every time his eyes swept the room all those months. “I read your letter and immediately made plans to get to Dublin. Granted, I’d been scheming for months on how best to do it. In lieu of replying I thought it safer to act without telling you, in case Jim caught word and tried to foil it. It took a good long while to get everything in proper order.”
talk to him that way,” he said lowly, then straightened.
Gregson raised an eyebrow at John. “And who are
be, though. Obviously. Biology doesn’t work that way—“
“The author,” The Doctor said. “Brilliant man, forever having adventures himself, when he wasn’t writing them.”
Sherlock snorted.
John’s breath quickened as he pulled closer, and he leaned down to kiss Sherlock again as Sherlock ran his hands along his arms. “Do I look different? From when you last saw me?” He left a trail of light, slow kisses up Sherlock’s jaw to his ear, burying his nose in Sherlock’s hair. He’d missed that smell so much. He could drown in it.
“Nah, he’d be thrilled. He loves showing off his things. Come on.” Craig hefted Alfie into his arms and led them down the hall.
John and Sherlock gave the flat a final sweep with their eyes, and they tramped downstairs. “Mrs. Hudson, if we don’t come back up, don’t come looking for us, just call the police,” Sherlock called into Mrs. Hudson’s flat.
John patted the bed for Hamish to sit down. He looked up at them, an eyebrow raised in a decidedly Sherlock fashion.
Sherlock stared down at John incredulously, his chest still gasping for air. “G-God…no…John. I-I want you to fuck me, John—
Sherlock kept Hamish from moving any closer to Jim. He locked his eyes with Moriarty, who had a small smile on his lips, clearly enjoying every moment of catching Sherlock and John so off guard.
“J-John—“ Sherlock blindly grabbed behind him for John, grabbing him and pulling him to the door to see.
“I see him! Come on!” Sherlock and John followed him across the room and approached the back of a dark-haired man in a top hat. Sherlock clears his throat as Hamish reaches out to tug on the man’s sleeve. The man turned around and John and Sherlock stared in horror at James Moriarty.
“You’ve never played Cluedo? That’s it, we’re playing,” John declared, grabbing the board game and heroically ignoring Sherlock’s massive eyeroll. He explained the rules and Sherlock interjected snide remarks about the rules being idiotic. John got flustered and defensive of the game, and all the while Hamish was amused by both of his dads and quickly picked up the rules of the game.
John’s heart hammered as the safety was released, but before O’Seanassy could fire, his jaw was grabbed from behind and his neck was snapped. He crumpled too the ground and Jim was looking down at him with distaste.
“I have a few years on you, remember,” Sherlock reminded him, running his hand through Hamish’s dark hair, feeling a surge of love for the boy. “I’m glad you came with us, Hamish.”
Sherlock’s phone rang. “Don’t answer that. You’re right, you need a break,” John said, crossing over to him. “You also need some nourishment. You look like one of those mistreated POWs. Let me fix you something.”
“Thanks for letting us in,” John added.
John examined Sherlock’s face, enjoying having him trapped, all to himself. The past few nights alone in Hamish’s room had been unbearable. “I could get used to this,” he murmured, beginning to grind his hips slowly against Sherlock’s. He loosened his grip on Sherlock’s wrists and throat, but Sherlock didn’t try to break free, apart from arching his neck up to catch John’s lips in another kiss and wrapping a leg around John to pull him even closer.
“I never said that.” Sherlock frowned down at him, and John put his hands on Sherlock’s hips.
John was exactly what he wanted him to be, Sherlock thought, but said nothing. He was hardly going to beg him to stay, not after John stated so clearly that it wasn’t what he wanted.
John rolled his eyes, twining his feet with Sherlock’s to keep warm. “You know very well the digestive system doesn’t work like that. Food doesn’t sit in the stomach for days, slowly being eaten away.”
Jim turned back around to face John, this time looking at him down the barrel of a pistol. “It
the winner.”
Beating away.” He sighed, then brushed off and straightened Sherlock’s lapels. “Ah, well. If at first you don’t succeed…” His mouth drifted into a grin.
John swallowed nervously. “I wasn’t—“
“You won’t need stitches, Dr. Watson,” Jim said. To John’s surprise, he helped John wrap gauze around his chest to staunch the bleeding, his fingers quick and nimble.
Hamish seemed engrossed, however, by the thick file documenting tobacco ash and mud compositions and charts comparing liquid viscosity.
to meet them. And you will.” He clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. “It’s been fantastic, it really has. Sherlock and Dr. Watson in the TARDIS.”
“Openness to same-sex relationships,” Sherlock offered.
John was now fully erect, even as he tried to wriggle free from underneath Jim.
“Jim. My name is Jim.” He pressed his ring against the melted wax.
John clicked out the light on their way out.
John swallowed. If he pretended that he like Jim enough to share a bed with him, Jim might be well pleased. The best friend his former rival, utterly devoted to him. That had to be an attractive offer. As much as it sickened John to think about it, it was the clearest way to Sherlock that he could see so far.
“I find that plan completely acceptable.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around him, letting his hands slide down his lower back.

The Doctor blinked mildly, although wisely stayed on the other side of the angels, out of Sherlock’s reach. “Why are
, in your case.”
John was finding it difficult to breathe.
“What’s it to you if I am?” Hamish asked suspiciously.
Moriarty struggled to free himself for a moment, glaring up at John, then a smile broke out on his face. “Oh, John, you are
Craig came back in with Alfie. “Any questions for me?”
take me serious when I say, if you try and pull a stunt like this again...”
The job was harder than expected, even with Gannon and O’Seanassy’s help. John didn’t return until the day after Hamish got back, and his throat was so bruised that he had difficulty speaking or swallowing. He also sported a large gash across his back, but he couldn’t see it to tell if he needed stitches or not.
Sherlock groaned and arched his back, beginning to unbutton his and then John’s trousers before running his hands up John’s back, feeling scars there that hadn’t been there before. His stomach turned, but that vanished when John leaned in to kiss Sherlock with more fervency, pushing him back onto the bed. John’s hands were everywhere now, growing frantic. He murmured into Sherlock’s mouth, “God—I want you—“
"You have two cats, you're left handed, judging by your fingernails, mild OCD, your right thumb says you play the flute, quite often, although that's no indicatior of how good you are, however, that stack of classical music in the corner would tend to support the idea that you're rather skilled at it. You've lived in an old, creaky house most of your life, though not this one. You don't know how to properly hold a writing utensil, your love life exists but lacks quite a bit in the physical department, and you had eggs for breakfast this morning. Do you want me to go on?"
The curtains are drawn, which is good, because nobody can see me do
“It’s a bit like blogging, talking to him,” John said. Doyle had written up about ten of Sherlock’s cases so far. John had read them over, and even though the author had changed a great number of details, he found them very entertaining. It was fun reading about Sherlock in a story as if he was some sort of hero. Doyle had recently been talking about trying to publish in the Strand.
to trust me.”
John touching Sherlock’s chin and tilted his face toward him. “Well, whatever’s coming for us—blue boxes or time-stealing angels or psychotic murderers…we’ll be together. Right?”
“Of course, I’ll tell the kitchen.” He left the room and returned a moment later. “They’ll start dinner preparations at once. John—a word?”
It was all John could do to stop himself from punching Mycroft in his prominent nose.
John was fuming, his cheeks flushed and his eyes flashing.
When John woke up, Jim was frowning over at him.
growing used to him. If he despised him, why was he being so adamant about keeping Jim off the drugs? He could see no benefit for John in doing so. What was his angle? Unsure of how he felt about the army doctor in front of him, Jim said nothing more. He capped his ink bottle and put away his pen, raising his eyebrows at John before walking upstairs to go to bed, wondering if John would follow him.

John looked at the mantel, where a mug of congealing cold tea was sitting, next to a large jar of rat poison. Maybe he should just move out. He could only vaguely remember the days where things were sane. Sane and boring, a small voice in John’s head reminded him. He shoved the thought away angrily. “Well, now the dog’s dead and Ruby’s refusing to talk to me. Eleven. I think this is eleven women that have sent me packing, due in some way to you.”
?” John stood up, outraged.
“Then stop me,” Magnussen said, giving the detective a small smile as his hand on John sped up.
Jane gave a small nod. “My husband passed…but I’ve got a son…around the same age as your lad—Hamish…”
“Hamish, you should know very well that some of biggest scientific breakthroughs were mistakes. You’re the best mistake that I’ve ever inherited.” He rested a hand on his son’s shoulder.
Jim shoved his lips against John’s in a forceful kiss, prying John’s mouth open with his tongue, searching every inch of John’s mouth.
On the verge of tears, Molly squeezed Sherlock’s shoulders. “If you need anything, call me. Please.”
Sherlock ran a hand up John’s neck to the back of his head, holding it against him, missing the feel of John, missing his smell, his smile, his touch—everything. Finally he whispered softly, “You look even more changed than Hamish does.”
Molly faltered for a moment. “Well for a start, getting dressed, dumping out those pills, and going outside for once. You haven’t shaved in days, you look like you’ve lost two stone, and you smell awful.”
“How many statues are there? Have you gotten an accurate count with all of the moving around?”
“They’re not sufficient,” Sherlock grumbled.
Jim finally pulled away and rolled off the bed to put his clothes on. “We’ve got work to do today, kitten. Get that sweet little arse of yours out of bed, hop to!”
Sherlock closed his eyes as John’s lips moved to his neck, slowly kissing up to his ear.
“Where shall we go? The park?” John said, trying to be cheerful. It was a gorgeous spring day, and John was trying hard to shove back the constant fear of being tossed into the past in the blink of an eye. He wanted to enjoy a beautiful day in 2012 London while he could.
Sherlock answered the knock at his door with a cigarette in his hand and a blank expression on his face.
have to protect you. Do you know how many times you’ve needed your ass saved? Let’s take a tally, shall we?”
There certainly was a smell to Baker Street, and it seemed to roll off everything—the people, the buildings, the muck in the streets.
Jim looked a bit annoyed, but also curious. He arched his neck to look down at John.
"Sherlock Holmes! For you I'd meet any time. I've got some places to go-what year are you in right now?"
“Ungh,
"Time machine. Time travel's impossible, mathematically, they've practically proven it," Sherlock sputtered.
“But he tutors me!”
“Where did we go?” John asked when he was able to speak again.
Jim seized John’s hair, causing John to gasp. He used the opportunity to shove the barrel into John’s mouth. “I
.” He tossed the book to John, fed up. “Ridiculous.”
Pain racked John’s body and he yelled out, making no attempt to mask it or quiet it, since the gag muffled it so much anyway. Every thrust pushed a futile yell or groan of protest from John's mouth as his head pressed against the headboard.
The Doctor seemed like quite the matchmaker, John thought, thinking back to Elton and Ursula. And, although not directly related, he and Sherlock hadn’t acted on their feelings until this whole mess had began.
Sherlock held John closer and admitted quietly, “Well, you can have me.”
Sherlock frowned and grabbed John's hands, stopping them on the second button. He searched John's face and realized that John was serious. He realized with horror exactly what John had gone through for the past year, but swallowed his shock and said gently, “John—I…not like that. This is give and take…I’m not Jim. I don’t want to just…
“It would have created a way out for you. It would allow you to maintain your life in modern London and it would have closed the loophole, since the
John swallowed and looked at the floor. Jim cocked his head, thinking. Perhaps John
John sighed into his mouth, pulling Sherlock closer by his hips, but they both pulled away when a churning engine noise began, growing louder and louder. It sounded like it was coming from directly downstairs.
“C-can we have steak and kidney pie?” Hamish ventured, and John squeezed his hand.
When the boy returned empty-handed a half-hour later, out of breath and with the answer “steak and kidney pie,” John smiled and relinquished his guinea, knowing the note had fallen into the right hands.
“Oh, undoubtedly. London is still full of crime, I imagine.
Sherlocked looked at the two of them, baffled. "But…but how do you…breathe?"
“I don’t.”
“Tomorrow, John. We’ve enough to buy a few suitable things.”
More often than not, Jim gave John most Fridays off, so every other week John picked up a habit of visiting Hamish in the afternoon, not coming back until after dinner, when all of Jim’s lackeys and employees had returned to their respective homes. It was on one of these nights that John came home to find the front door slightly ajar.
John’s face burned as he finished stripping, then crawled onto the bed and kneeled, feeling humiliated. His heart hammered in his chest.
“If you consider riches and a good school for Hamish a threat…
“It’s not that…I just don’t like feeling…coddled. I was in the army, you know. I’m good at surviving.”
He rolled back over and it took John a very long time to fall asleep. Jim was asleep almost instantly; the laudanum was likely the culprit. John heard him mutter Sebastian’s name a few times, which surprised him. He thought sleepily about Jim and Sebastian’s relationship, trying to imagine Jim acting anything resembling loving to anyone.
“Hamish, you must understand that once we go back to 1895, we shall be living there permanently. We’re not like the Doctor. We can’t travel around to whenever we want. Life is going to be very different back then. It’ll be more dangerous in a lot of ways, life will be harder and more frustrating.”
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open. The TARDIS,
“I haven’t got an‘insult of the day,’” Sherlock frowned.
, John?”
Doyle stood up and walked over to a pile of papers on the chair, picking a leaf out. “Good thing for you I fail at keeping tidy—even Mary can’t keep up. The perils of being a bachelor, as you two must both understand. There’s an article in here, third page, I believe.”
Jim wrapped his arm around John and licked up his cheek, then kissed him fully on the mouth before he rolled over to sleep, leaving John panting and tethered to the bed, feeling self-disgust and confusion wash over him.
I just offered him Sebastian’s old position.” Jim met Sherlock’s eyes from under his brow and bit his bottom lip, licking it and slowly drawing it out of his mouth, hoping to strike a nerve.
Sherlock had contemplated visiting Mycroft in person for several days. Now that they were standing in front of his townhouse, he was beginning to second-guess himself. He rang the buzzer and a posh female voice answered. “Please give your name and reason for visiting.”
John’s heart sank. “Okay.I mean…good. Goodnight.”
“W-what did you hear?” John choked out, and Jim tightened his grip on his neck, his thumb digging into John's pulse point.
Sherlock scanned the crowed, deconstructing the posh, upper class men and women strolling about, and John wondered if Hamish was making friends his own age; he was so tight-lipped about his social life.
“Yes, well...some men are better off as bachelors, you know.”
Molly was not deterred, however. She snatched the bottle from him and looked around for any more pills. She found two bottles with pills still in them, and snatched these up as well.
Sherlock's touch elicited some girlish laughter from the slab before Ursula scolded, "Watch it! That tickles."
Mycroft blinked rapidly and looked at the floor. “In primary school, when you used to knick the headmaster’s keys to use the lab—remember that? As Head Boy I was always the one put in charge of finding out where the keys were, and I had to pretend to be mystified. You were a little bastard.” He laughed softly.
"It's his species. He's the last one. Well, there was the Master. That was fun. He took great joy in killing me. Over and over."
“But why?”
“Ever written any detective stories?” The Doctor asked.
Jim took a step closer so that their shoes were nearly touching. They were improperly close. He removed his hat and tipped his neck to both sides, cracking it loudly, then moved his lips to whisper in her ear, his voice cold and low. “That’s not really any of your business, is it?”
who he is, even the men who work for him.”
do it if you stay here!”
“CARDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR, DARLING!” Jim yelled madly as pounded into him, pulling the gun from John’s mouth and firing a bullet into the ceiling as he climaxed himself.
John blinked in disbelief as he listened. There was real fear in this woman’s voice. She didn’t sound like a mad person in the least. “Angels,” was all he managed to say before the phone rang in John’s hand. He looked at the number. Lestrade.
And the worst part was, despite how much he hated it, he could feel his erection pushing against his trousers. He breathed heavily through his nose, squeezing his eyes shut. Not this. Not Magnussen. How dare he. This wasn’t right. But the more humiliated he felt, the heavier and needier his cock became.
John nodded. Sherlock had, naturally, deduced absolutely correctly. Why hadn’t he figured it out earlier?
Hamish frowned, his mouth popping open. “What—no, I just saw him this morning! He told me goodbye before I went to school…” Hamish looked over at Jim, who had rearranged his face into a sad, pitying expression.
“More coming,” Sherlock mumbled, pulling away. They both froze—a group of school children, by the sound of things. They quickly disentangled themselves and straightened their appearances as a small boy wandered in. The rest of the group seemed to be moving on without him, but he didn’t seem to notice or mind. He just stared up at John and Sherlock. “Were you two havin’ a snog just now?” he asked.
"You'd have to be more than incredible to find this man," Elton said.
? What do you mean ‘when the angels come’? Is that some sort of code? An organization?”
John killed the men he had to and avoided Baker Street altogether, reuniting with the other men and heading back to Dublin without delay. John wanted to be sure that Jim remained convinced that John was infatuated with him, especially after the trip to London, so close to Sherlock.
Several winding streets later, John was properly lost as they finally stopped in a back alley. The man stopped at a low doorway marked only by a red lantern, then pushed the door open for John, allowing a cloud of smoke to billow out. “After you, doc.”
John pulled his fingers out, lubricated his cock, then very carefully pushed it in, pausing to let Sherlock get used to its width. Sherlock gave a small groan, and John pulled out and pushed in again, this time hitting Sherlock’s prostate, making Sherlock arch his back and part his lips in a silent moan.
“Are you really…an alien?” John asked the Doctor. “You look human to me. You sound human. You sound
follow, because if I disclose any more it could...rip a hole in the pocket and then, well, what happens with a pocket hole? All the loose coins and keys and bits of string and whatever it is you put in your pockets falls out. Bear with me!” He said, raising a hand as Sherlock opened his mouth to speak.
“You don’t display any signs of mental illness,” Sherlock said, sitting across from him, steepling his fingers. John pulled up a chair next to them, grabbing a spare bit of paper to make notes; Sherlock never bothered with such “trivialities,” but John found notes helpful.
After a moment, Sherlock took a step back, taking a deep breath, collecting himself and wiping away his tears. He set his jaw and breathed in heavily through his nose again. “I need you to go to the stationary shop a few streets down and fetch me a seal with the letters ‘KM’ on it and a new stick of wax.”
John wasn’t sure what Sherlock would want to do after saying goodbye to his brother. When Sherlock ordered the cab back to Baker Street, John had expected Sherlock to retreat to his room or to his chair and disappear into his thoughts for hours on end, but as soon as they were inside 221B, Sherlock shrugged off his coat and yanked John toward him, kissing him. John gasped in surprise.
Not knowing what else to do, John and Sherlock followed the strange man out into the street, stopping outside his phone box as he unlocked it. John was shocked to see it in reality; they’d spent so long searching for it, and here it was, astounding in how ordinary it looked. He touched it to make sure it was real.
in the late 19
? You Holmeses always did have a flair for the dramatic. I’m making more tea. Want a cup?”
“You said you ‘caught glimpses’ of what was chasing you. Describe it.”
“What are you thinking about?”
John stepped over to look at Sherlock, his arms crossed. “Hamish, I can understand. But if he takes me...I’m sorry, I’m not going to accept that.
Sherlock fervently kissed him back, yanking John’s coat off, grabbing at his neck with both hands, pulling him closer.
Sherlock glanced at John, who looked relieved, then back to her, reaching his hand out to raise her chin so their eyes met. Sherlock searched her face for a moment. “Thank you,” he said sincerely.
“You saw the advert, did you? For the surgeon job?”
He stood over Jim for a moment, giving his arm a light kick, then reached down to feel at Jim’s wrist for a pulse. It was so faint that it took several moments to find it. He bent and scooped Jim up, sweeping the dining room table clear with one hand so he could lay him out on it. He ran back to the kitchen to grab towels to staunch the bleeding, stepping over the pool of blood, then rushed off to fetch his med bag and returned to pull of Jim’s jacket, waistcoat and shirt.
“No! Do what you want. Forget it.” John buried his face in the newspaper again, flustered. The sight of his flatmate shirtless shouldn’t bother him. And it wasn’t that that bothered him. It was the fact that John couldn’t help but glance up every now and then and notice and admire the lines of Sherlock’s torso, the curve of bone at his hips, the small of his back, how pale he was—there was nothing wrong with noticing, John told himself.
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and gave it a squeeze. “You told us you would tell us, Doctor. Why did you bother showing up if you can’t say anything at all?” he asked.
“We’ll need to tell her, then. I will. After dinner.”
? You want me to blink?!”
“I didn’t think you did MRIs, Doctor Watson.
Jim finished writing before folding the letter and dripping sealing wax on the envelope, not bothering to look up.
When John came out twenty minutes later, there was a steaming mug of tea waiting for him. “You made me tea?” He sniffed it, remembering the only other time Sherlock had served him a beverage. “There’s no hallucinogenic sugar in here, is there?” he teased.
Sherlock’s eyes were beginning to water. He swallowed hard, thinking. “I have an idea. We’re going to position ourselves in the middle of the kitchen, halfway between my angel and yours. When I say blink, blink once, as quickly as you can.”
"We tried asking the doctor, but most of what he said goes right over our heads. He tends to jabber pretty quick," Elton said, then looked at Sherlock. "Bit like you."
Jim paused for a moment, thinking. “Remember the last time we had a little rendezvous? Back at the pool?”
be. If they’d somehow, impossibly had a son, they’d bloody well know! But the resemblance—and the surnames. Was this some sort of Time Lord prank? He didn’t find it amusing in the least.
John hissed in pain, his grip on Jim’s hips tightening automatically.
“You and Hamish need to eat as well,” Sherlock pointed out. “And there’s the matter of paying for Hamish’s school, whenever we find a suitable one.”
Sherlock held him to his chest, resting his chin on John’s head, not knowing what to say. That kiss had told him so much more than he wanted to know about what had happened here. John’s hesitation and tensing paired with the slightly raw skin around his wrists, spoke volumes, volumes that should never have been written, and he held John tighter.
brought me back.”
John clutched at Sherlock’s coat lapels, kissing him as if this was the last time he’d ever be able to do, and Sherlock matched his fervency, slipping his tongue into John’s mouth, which was becoming much more familiar now, but in a delightful way, like a favorite room he loved coming back to. He wrapped his arms around John’s back, sucking on John’s lower lip.
“F-fuck…Sherlock—“
No witnesses have seen anything suspicious, we haven’t come up with a single clue—“ Lestrade ran his hand through his hair, visibly frazzled. “Anyway, if you wanted a look at the statues, there’s one up in number 21.”
“Our situation is very similar to an aneurysm in the sense that we don’t know when or if we will ever…disappear.”
“John, can we not? Perhaps you should get a glass of water and go to bed.”
“ I don’t know, but if it is able to get here from Brixton only when no one is looking at it, I don’t want to underestimate it. Unless it’s a new one.” There was a chilling thought. He realized, of course, that they had no idea how many angels were out there. There had been the four in Brixton, but there were stone angels all over the place, in cemeteries, on churches… “Tell me if you need to blink and I’ll trade off with you for a bit.”
“He does that,” John said apologetically. “But don’t worry, if Sherlock’s taken your case, he’ll solve it. You’re in good hands.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s hands from his back and pinned them to the bed above his head. “Say you’re sorry.”
“You still haven't answered my question, John,” Jim said, a dangerous tinge in his voice. “What's on your mind?”
“John, come here,” Magnussen said, a small smile playing on his lips.
still here.”
doesn’t find the solar system useless.”
John had noticed this too. “Gum chewer?”
Mr. Doyle’s housekeeper poked her head in then. “Mr. Doyle sent me up to see if you were finding the flat to be to your liking,” she said. “Is it just the three of you? Neither of you have a…a wife?”
John was about to answer when Jim shut him up with another deep kiss. He twisted his wrists in Jim’s hands and gave a small grunt, feeling short of breath.
“But that’s what I saw,” Duncan insisted. “I know I did.”
“Doctor Watson and Hamish?
There was paperwork to sort out with Craig, which Sherlock handled while John helped Hamish pack. It felt less like helping than watching Hamish tear around the room, piling his few possessions untidily into a suitcase.
Jim’s face was far too close now. John turned away, desperately racking his brain for some loophole, some way out. “Why do you want me? I’d fight you…every step of the way I’d fight you. You’d get tired of me and kill me anyway. You’d get…” John forced his eyes to stay open. “You’d get bored and go after Sherlock again.”
John cried out as his thrusts became harder, more resonant—he forced himself to hold back to a gentler pace for a few minutes, groaning, before moving the pace back up to his hardest thrusts. “Oh, God, Sherlock—I-I’m going to come!” John gasped. He was so, so close, and the next thrust deep inside Sherlock sent him over the edge.
John leaned down to run his tongue very slowly from the base to the head of Jim’s cock, trying to replicate everything that had made Sherlock shudder with pleasure. He pushed away a wave of guilt as Sherlock flooded into his mind, reminding himself that he was doing this for him, that it was a means to an end. He slowly took the head in his mouth, running his tongue along it.
They stood in dumb silence for a moment.
All the while Hamish held tightly to John’s hand. Eventually, they returned downstairs to find Jim at his desk, writing. He gave Hamish a small, sad smile. “Would you like to decide what’s for dinner, Hamish?”
One morning, John came down the stairs to see Jim writing a letter furiously, blots of ink splashing onto the page. Without looking up at him he held out a piece of paper with his right hand, still scrawling at the paper with his left, and said, bored, “Kill this man. Keep it clean. Can’t have it leading back to me.”
“That should solve our problem.” Sherlock leaned forward to lick under John’s chin and whispered, “Keep your legs still.” He slowly slid back between John’s legs, pushing them apart, then cradled John’s balls in his hand, gently tugging and fondling them.
Sherlock scanned the street, unable to help hoping that his eyes would lock with a certain brown-eyed army doctor. When they didn't, he went to sit at his writing desk and began composing John's letter, not knowing how long it would be until he got it. It would be at least a week before it reached Dublin, where the address was marked, but would John even be back then? He wished he could respond to the letter immediately. Sherlock felt a pang of annoyance that 1895 didn’t have the convenience of mobiles and texting.
"Don't be silly, sweetheart!" Elton opened the door to an apparently empty room. There was a square of concrete propped up against the window, which didn't look unusual in the least until Elton picked it up and turned it around to reveal a living human face stuck inside. "Meet Ursula!"

“Yes, decommissioned and torn down years ago! I hadn’t seen one in ages,” Duncan said.
“Does Sherlock know about your…rather unusual enjoyment?” Magnussen said, tightening the blindfold securely.
“You’re sick,” Sherlock spat.
people, who would gladly let their knives meet his throat at my signal.
“I miss Westwood! And bombs, John! And technology.”
“Hm?”
“No one, sir,” she said. “Mr. Doyle, sir?”
“But you’re—you found—“ The Doctor took a step back, scratching his head, looking Hamish over. “How old are you, Hamish?”
Two dads. And the Doctor’s involvement yet again. It was impossible that this boy was their son, of course, John thought. Hamish was right, biology didn’t work that way. Still, Hamish’s unruly mop of dark hair, his narrow blue eyes, and his whole demeanor were so like Sherlock that John couldn’t ignore the resemblance. His heart pounded as he watched Hamish scratch behind his ear, something he’d seen Harry do a thousand times when she was uncomfortable. It simply wasn’t possible. He had to be imagining things.
“When you were just a new little thing in my lab,” the Doctor said. “I’ve just popped back from dropping you off with Wilfred Noble.”
Sherlock didn't push John, letting him take the lead, kissing him back slowly, his hands still on John’s face, then slowly ran one through his hair and down his back to rest at his hip, the other sliding down to rest at the side of his neck, his thumb softly running back and forth under his ear.
“John!”
As he ran, Sherlock’s mind raced at the possibility that John could be gone by the time he got there. Gone forever. He pushed himself to run faster, flying up the stairs and bursting into the flat.
They stepped inside the café and got an unobtrusive table where they could talk more comfortably. Sherlock began laying out what they knew of the Doctor, and the original case that he'd taken to solve.
Once they were at the TARDIS door, Hamish turned to the Doctor. “Will I ever see you again?”
“You said you wanted to prove that I was in love with you. I couldn’t let you know…I was positive you didn’t feel that way.”
likes this juvenile game because it’s the only chance he has to feel superior to me.”
, John thought, his heart pounding. He could feel Magnussen crossing around him and then he knew that Magnussen was standing right in front of him. His face burned. Sherlock couldn’t watch this. Sherlock couldn’t see.
, and you let me do what I bloody want.”
Jim smiled. “You’re only a bag of bones like the rest of us, Sherlock. Although…perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I’ll just tell them to start by getting rid of that lovely housekeeper you’ve got. Cute little thing, isn’t she? And of course, I could give my men the option of
Isn’t that what you always said, Sherlock? How you’ve changed. I’ll be keeping a very close eye on your son, while Daddy’s away. He’s got potential. ...Ooh! I wonder if I could adopt him once his fathers are incarcerated!”
“I want you to tell her about us, John.”
Jim walked back into the living room and sat at his desk to continue writing. “I would have killed him regardless of whether you were here or not. Anyone who barges into my house to threaten me or my employees must die. He was liability, and I’ve got a reputation to uphold.” He plucked up his fountain pen once more before adding, “And you’re a useful asset to me.”
Sherlock forced himself to stand still, watching John as he hesitantly stepped forward on the terrace, staring Magnussen down defiantly. It was a small reconciliation; whatever Charles Augustus Magnussen did to John now, John would bear it with dignity. And Sherlock was quite positive that he knew everything that Magnussen had on John’s file already. There was nothing that this despicable man could bring up that would cause John Watson to break down.
John, used to fading to the background when Sherlock was being praised was shocked when the Doctor turned to him. “And John Watson, the most human human, the bravest—“ he grabbed John’s hand and shook it as John stared at him, dumbfounded. “It’s such an honor. From the bottom of my hearts.”
“No, I’ve got two dads, at least that’s what Craig and Sophie told me.”
“Hamish. Go wait outside for a few minutes,” John said.
“I’m hungry,” Hamish said.
John pulled and twisted at his wrists, but Sherlock held them fast. He writhed under the man, his heart racing. He’d never wanted Sherlock more. He craned his head up to try to catch his lips with his own, but Sherlock leaned back, not allowing John to make contact.
“Oh, don’t get your hopes up, dear. Of course I’ll take precautionary steps. Have him watched, make sure he knows you’re with me, and of course, promise him that I’ll have you both killed if I think he’s getting too curious.” Jim touched John’s chin, tilting his face up towards him. “And I
Mary blushed, Sherlock noticed with considerable annoyance from the corner of his eye. “He doesn’t? Erm, what I mean is, sir, I won’t take offense to your indifference to my food, then.” She smiled a bit. “Though few have tasted my treacle fudge without cracking a smile.”
“Ohh,
"How does one track the Doctor down if he's always 'jumping around' in time?" Sherlock asked.
Duncan looked anxiously between the two men. “I have to tell you, first, about when I was a boy during the Blitz. The air raid sirens went off while I was delivering newspapers—I was late getting home, and the streets were completely empty. Except for one man, running down the street. He waved at me and smiled, like nothing was wrong. I was terrified that, somehow, he was a Nazi, but he wasn’t dressed like a soldier—anyway, he grabbed my hand and told me to run and to not turn around. I don’t know what was chasing us, I only caught glimpses…but I think that man saved my life. I got home and he disappeared. Then, last week, I saw the man again. I knew it was him, he even had the same outfit on. And he hadn’t aged at all!”
“Mm, I know what you mean. It’s clear that he’s intelligent, but if he’s an alien life form with the technology to travel through space and time at such speeds, than that’s only natural. As for seeming
It’s not worth it, it’s not worth it, Sherlock chanted to himself. He had to detach. He had to be logical. One embarrassing moment for them both was not worth their entire lives. Magnussen was trying to goad them both and it was working. But Sherlock was better than that. John was better than that. They had to be.
John mumbled something. He didn’t know a single thing about Coptic art other than what Hamish had just told him. He’d just been looking for another likely-empty room so he and Sherlock could continue their snog. He considered shooing Hamish off—despite what the boy said, the school group was bound to notice him missing eventually, and the teachers would likely frown on him hanging around with two strange men.
“Shhh…sleep, John…you did the right thing. What fun we’re going to have.”
“I can’t believe it! He’s here, he’s really here!” Hamish was practically bursting with glee.
“And 20 shillings to a pound,” Hamish added proudly.
Sherlock was still looking questioningly at John. “I don’t know,” John said in answer to his look. “I hardly fit to be a parent. I wouldn’t know the first thing, and we know we’ll be in 1895 in the very new future. Are we supposed to take Hamish with us? We’re going to be there, stranded, without money or jobs or connections and have to start all over. I’m properly worried about how we’ll take care of
Moriarty lazily stepped back. “Restrain your
John was about to answer when there was a loud clatter from the kitchen, making both John and Jim jump and turn their heads toward the drawing room door.
Hoping the move would put Jim in a good mood, John sat up, running his hand up Jim’s arm as he did, then leaned forward to kiss him gently on the mouth.
John stared at him for a moment. Sherlock spoke with such calmness. “How can you be so calm about this? How does it not bother you, that we could disappear from our friends’ lives? From our families? God, what am I supposed to tell Harry? We never did get on, but I’m the only immediate family she’s got. Am I supposed to ring her up and say, ‘Hi, sis, just so you know, I might disappear into the past, so if you don’t hear from me, it’s because I’m in 1895. Ta!’”
Sherlock stood up. “What is it, Mary?”
useful. He spread some on his fingers as Sherlock frowned at him curiously, then gently pushed Sherlock’s knees up toward his chest and slowly pushed an oiled finger inside, his breath catching at the tightness, then worked it in and out, slowly adding a second.
One evening, John was cleaning and checking the house's gun collection on Jim's orders. He pulled apart the pieces and checked them, so lost in his work that he didn't realize Jim had come to lean against the doorframe several minutes ago.
Jim’s eyes narrowed and they trailed up to John’s face, assessing him. “You get a kick out of this, don’t you? It gives you a rush—brings you back to the war. You enjoy the hunt, don’t you Dr. Watson?” John’s jaw tightened as he tied off the stitching and clipped it. Jim was right, and John hated himself for enjoying any of it.
. This century’s hateful. My brain is curdling with boredom as we speak.”
John cupped his face, running a hand along his cheekbone and down to his jaw. “It’s a fantastic thing.” He moved in to kiss Sherlock more deeply. “Would it be all right if I…moved back in?”
John shivered at the cold metal on his face, but stared into Jim’s eyes. He wasn’t going to shoot him, John told himself. He wouldn’t. Then again, what was to stop him? Sherlock would never know.
“Yes.”
In one of swift move, Sherlock grabbed Moriarty by his jacket and shoved him against the wall. “
They grabbed the printed scans of Sherlock’s brain, then John spun into an office. “Marlene! DO you have Dietrich Pendanski’s file? I need to make some comparisions for an MRI.”
tell about Torchwood."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, growing impatient. “Well, what is it, then?”
John shivered, instantly reminded of how violent and changeable his boss and captor was. He couldn’t let himself forget that he was living with a madman as unpredictable as a summer storm. He sighed a breath of relief as the door closed, then bent to pick up the vase shards. Several had skittered under Jim’s desk. John crawled under to retrieve them. As he straightened, he noticed a corner of a note poking out from beneath a ledger. Looking to double-check nobody was around, he slid it out to skim it over. As he did, his heart skipped a beat.
Moriarty shut the door to the small library they were now in.
“I’m a jack of all trades,” John laughed.
you!” Sherlock clawed his hands greedily down John’s back, wanting to touch every part of him at once.
“This is my son, Hamish Watson. I’m a widower and Sherlock was my wife’s…brother. He’s helping me look after him, as we are both bachelors.”
John moaned as the gun pushed in and out. He
John turned to Sherlock, laughing. “Well…I think he likes us.”
blame me for not waiting for you
Mary watched Sherlock let out a choked gasp. He scanned over the letter several more times, although he had memorized it the first time through. By the fifth time through it, Sherlock was crying.
If you can’t believe that, then that means you can’t trust me.
John yanked Hamish away from his hand. “Don’t you dare touch him!”
John frowned at the idea. He hadn’t the slightest notion of how homosexuality was viewed in Victorian England. Was it even legal? He doubted it was at all acceptable.  “But—she might quit. She might be so uncomfortable that she quits working for Arthur. She could spread gossip about it on the street and ruin your name. No more clients. Is that what you want?”
As John moved, the uncomfortable stretching began to subside, and it was all pleasure as John hit Sherlock’s prostate once more. He moaned and began bucking his hips up to meet John until it was pure pleasure, and John complied to his thrusts by moving faster. John shuddered above him, digging his hands more tightly into Sherlock’s skin.
"Good thing I
John and Sherlock slept in separate beds over the next few nights. A few days later, Sherlock came home from an unfruitful walk around the area and stopped at the door of the flat, unable to help himself from eavesdropping on a conversation between John and Mary.
“Of course. I’m your medic. Now that you’re awake, I imagine you’d like some painkillers.”
John lets his eyes flutter shut, fully relaxing for the first time in what felt like a year, and scooted closer to Sherlock, resting his head under his chin.
Sherlock lunged at the Doctor, but John grabbed him by the waist, yanking him back. “Get. Out.
“No. They’ll be in one place one day and one place another, and nobody knows where they came from. Whoever’s moving them must be quite—“ she pushed into the flat and stared at an empty corner. “I was just—just here three minutes ago.” She checked the door number again. “How is that—“ Sally turned and jumped, clutching her chest, as she saw the statue standing in the narrow corridor of the flat, near the toilet. “How did it get there?”
“Not that I’m aware of,” he whispered back, biting back a grin. “I don’t know, he reminds me a bit of you.”
John sighed as he opened his medical bag. He’d been shocked at what the Victorians considered useful drugs; they used many painkillers to the point that they were addictive and harmful. But, he’d learned, he could use a small dosage of laudanum as an effective painkiller, provided he didn’t overuse it.
“Gross, Dads!” Hamish wrinkled his nose. “What if someone sees you?”
John thought he’d say more, but he just rolled to face the other direction and said, “Don’t snore.”
John skimmed the brief Wikipedia article and related it to Sherlock. It wasn’t a long entry; Doyle was a Victorian writer who wrote a great deal of stuff, mainly historical chronicles and a few adventure stories, although nearly all of his works were out of print, more or less vanished into obscurity.
