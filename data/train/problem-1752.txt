Later, as we made our way to the laboratory, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.
The convert frequently spoke about his life before the Mormons, and this intrigued Strangerson with a burning fascination. The younger man wished desperately to know more about life outside his small and secluded people and what the greater society of men contained.
The men of the establishment duly laughed, a hearty communal sound that cut through the sentimentality we all were feeling at watching the proceedings before us. Hope and Strangerson’s love had filled us each with pride and delight, and seeing the two of them partake in the trappings of matrimony made my heart swell. It didn’t matter that their ceremony was not legally binding. It didn’t matter that I could never have imagined the sight of a man marrying another man a few short months ago. The only thing that was important was their proclamation of everlasting love to one another here before this exalted community.
Hope looked down at Strangerson’s arse as he tapped his instrument upon the eager crack. He was overcome with the thought that he was about to be fucking his best friend, here after years of pent up longing. Arching his butt in the air, Strangerson knew that they were about to embark on an excursion that would last forever. He was in love with Hope and no one else would ever provide him the same passion.
The room we came to was low-lit and smoke filled, redolent of tobacco and other heady smells. From somewhere through the haze came the sound of a player piano and a dull cacophony of voices. Though the space was shadowed, I could resolve a bar in the distance and scattered furnishings; comfortable-looking couches and divans. Draped upon them, turning their heads to watch us pass, was a profusion of beautiful and enticing men.
Ruffled and uncomfortable, Drebber began to puff. “I would ask you to please take your accusations elsewhere. Simply because a man isn’t happily married does not mean that he undertakes the gross indecencies to which you refer.”
I laughed at his cross-examination. “I keep to myself as well,” I said. “And I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices as well, but those are the principal ones at present.”
I suppose I should not have submitted so easily and allowed Holmes to use my instrument as a transactional tool in his case. But you must understand that it had been some time since a pair of fine lips had become wrapped around my cockhead. Drebber, with his avuncular handsomeness, was not a terrible way to break this virginal fast.
Nuzzling my neck, he whispered in wonderment about the unbelievable partaking we had both shared. “You are a savant of sex, my friend. Do not close yourself off from others.” After cleaning off, I thanked and paid him. Lingering on the bed, we held each other, kissing and embracing while reiterating our mutual bond, our soft endowments rubbing against one another. I knew this would not be the last time I sought out the company of Jack Saul.
But before he could utter whatever was on his lips, a quite-sloshed Strangerson came over and nearly fell upon Holmes’ shoulder. He said that he wanted to thank the detective for all of his help and began pulling him toward a small crowd of men that included his new husband. He shouted something to Hope that I didn’t quite catch, but I was pretty sure it included the words ‘enormous cock.’
They came in a variety of shapes, colours, ages, and styles—as if the Empire and all her diversity were on display. Many seemed to be wearing a costume of some kind, often that of a working-class man such as a dockhand, carpenter, or blacksmith. A few donned suits like Holmes and myself—though it was unclear if they were staff or clientele—and several appeared to be of high society. Quite a number were bare-chested or garbed in even less. One nubile young man passed us with naught but the garters on his legs (Holmes gave his cock a playful squeeze as he went by, to which he smiled).
This was something Hope had wished not to be asked. But he gave in to his friend’s inquisitiveness. “I was aroused beyond measure. It was not something I could help.”
Pushing him back, I slid down to my knees before him and unbuckled his belt. Fishing out his engorgement, I placed it in my mouth, savoring its musky flavor, that mixture of sweat and pre-ejaculatory fluid which had come to coat it. Gregson responded by throwing back his head and panting ecstatically. I tugged off his trousers and underwear, throwing them both to the side as I took a good long look at his member. It was neither large nor small, and had a charming upward bend. His bullocks, on the other hand, were enormous, entirely outsized for his particular organ, and I delighted in nuzzling my face against these ovoid treasures within their hairy nest. I sucked one, then the other, running my tongue over their curvature while they were encased inside my mouth. Gregson gasped euphorically at each action and additional fluid came leaking from his tip.
We left him at work with his chemicals, and walked toward my hotel.
“It was obvious to me from the beginning that the two of us are quite similar in character. That was the same number of men I had taken to bed during that span.”
“It is indeed kind of you to come,” said the man. “I have left everything untouched.”
“Have you been with a man before, Mr. Williams?” said Saul, lightly.
“Tell me more about this Mr. Holmes,” I said, my thoughts straying once again back to lodgings and money. “He is a medical student, I suppose?”
By this point, my erection was starting to strain at the fabric of my underwear. “Have you ever found yourself under similar circumstances?” I asked, realizing where our current situation was likely headed.
He fished out my towering implement, busily moving his lips over the head to collect the succulent juices that had issued forth. The hashish had intensified my awareness, my mind zeroing in on what would provide me with the greatest enjoyment. Seeing his legs over my head, I knew precisely what I wanted. Reaching up, I undid his belt and removed his accouterments. His knob sprang out, the fat tip practically knocking me in the eye. He was as at least large as I was—perhaps a bit shorter though certainly thicker.
I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded down the path, or rather down the finger of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. He then looked up to an open window on the second floor, white curtains flying in the breeze.
Strangerson squirmed, a hot feeling that he didn’t understand working its way through his belly. “The sin of young men,” he said, moving down to a whisper. “Abusing themselves.”
“His own fervor must have been aroused by these actions for, at one point, he undid the clasp of the cloth covering his crotch. Out sprang his own erect implement, towering over my head like a fine oaken club. His piece was immense, as was befitting a man so large as himself, and the reflexes of my characters told me what I must do. A voice in my head said simply: ‘Allow your desire to overtake you.’”
I gasped. “Even better.”
“By no means.”
“What does he want you there for?” I asked Holmes.
“To Salt Lake City. The hand of God leads us there, following the person of our Prophet.” Great pity rose in the young man’s breast, and the desire to foster this new stranger who appeared so haggard and in need of brotherly love. “You must come with us so that we can nurse you back to health. But if you do, it can only be as a believer in our own creed. We have no wolves among our fold. Will you agree to such terms?”
“Seeing that I was still unsatisfied, he took my hand and looked into my eyes. ‘I have a great amount of love,’ he said. ‘And, for me, love must be free.’”
Parting ways with me in the wonderland before us, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind. Finding a secluded sofa, I sat to catch my spinning head. I had always considered myself open to new experiences, certainly of the erotic variety, but a few short weeks with Holmes had already opened up vistas I’d scarcely dreamed about. This strange free-spirited world I had entered seemed ever more fantastic with each passing day, and Holmes himself an ever greater mystery and temptation.
“How magnificent!” I exclaimed.
Holmes held up the atomizer proudly. “It is a cleaning spray capable of instantly dissolving semen and other ejaculates and leaving no trace. Are you a high-society man looking to hide your torrid affair with the gardener without alerting your washerwoman? With Sherlock Holmes’ patented creation, now you can.”
The young scout took his newfound companion down to the crowds below, who welcomed the starving man and took him before Brother Strangerson, an Elder in their society. He was the father of the youth who had spotted Jefferson Hope and, upon seeing the man, he turned to his son. “Give him food and drink and let it be your task to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”
The unhappy youth could make no sense of his father’s question, so lost was he in his misery. He merely raised his head from his pillow and told the Elder Strangerson that he no longer cared what happened to him. At this declaration, his father realized that his son must be in a sorry state indeed, and that nuptial arrangements would have to secured as quickly as possible.
“Aroused by what? The gentle natural spring?”
This thought was a novel and shocking as any. “Human sexuality is more complicated than I ever imagined.”
The pressure against my palate felt astounding, and the accomplishment of disappearing the length of his dick into my fore-end with no gagging reflex filled me with pride. Gregson’s heavy exhalations suggested that the situation was rather overwhelming for him as well. His instincts bade him place his hands upon the back of my head and start to rhythmically thrust his hips. The incursion was not unwelcome and I was impressed with myself for managing to provide the man with what he clearly so desired. As he fucked my face, his bountiful bullocks slapped repeatedly against my chin, the feeling incredible and gratifying.
Hope drove himself upright and brought his lips to Strangerson’s, who received the tender kiss. The men embraced one another tightly, giving in to their mutual desires, finally let loose from rigid social conventions. A fearful emotion pressed in Strangerson’s breast—the worry of what his Mormon family would think. But the dread was soon buried beneath the realization that, no matter what happened next, he would never be able to relinquish Hope again. For his part, Hope swelled with happiness that he and his best friend were able to show one another the true depth of their love.
The boisterous crowd continued dancing in the dim light of the club. From the corner of my eyes, I could see that several of the men—most of them quite drunk—had begun to remove their shirts and were currently slipping and sliding their half-nude bodies against one another as the music swelled. Even during the wedding ceremony, there had been a number of ribald jokes, a great deal of backs being slapped, several crowd-members caressing their inflating implements beneath their elegant clothes. It was understood by all that Hope and Strangerson’s vows had not included exclusivity and many were awaiting the moment when the new grooms decided to transform their after-party into a bacchanalia.
Gregson began to stammer. “I— I can’t contain myself. This is simply…”
“Ah, if only I could explain,” thought Hope. “In a manner,” he said aloud.
There were times when I would look at him and be glad for his rules about not mixing domestic and recreational activities together—Holmes was rather not the type of man I typically went for. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to experience when he would run his fingers over my shoulders to get my attention.
I would hear Holmes banging into them from the room next to mine. Exactly how he found so many men in London with such capacious arseholes was beyond me. I did my best to ignore it, thinking that I should be out finding a romp of my own. But still I listened, often bringing myself to completion with the sound of some man softly calling Holmes’ name.
Not quite understanding where this was going, I told my friend that it was no matter. “Thank you for kicking off these excellent festivities.”
The summer heat now pricked the two men as they sat discussing an indecorous subject in Hope’s sweltering household. “Why should this sin of onanism be such an evil?” asked Hope. “Has not the Lord filled men with passion?”
The glans of his cock glistened with precum in the golden light, its tip poking coquettishly from a foreskin sheath. My tongue tasted this delightful indulgence, one hand wrapped around his shaft as the other continued its eager dance against his butthole. Taking the head into my mouth, I twirled my tongue over the tip and took back his foreskin. Stamford practically fell back against the wall, enraptured by my carnal skills.
“My sweat-covered partner now conducted an acrobatic act, scooping me up in his arms as he drew himself into a standing position. He cradled my buttocks as I wrapped my hands around his neck, feeling his massive cock drive into my exposed pucker while I uttering euphoric declarations. To be entirely under his control as he directed his erection into me was an incredible inducement toward ever higher realms of pleasure. Napayshni grunted like a warrior, his athletic prowess evident at each turn of our carnal session.”
He got up, a loud plopping sound emerging at the same time as his colossal implement. The dark-haired man collapsed to the ground, completely spent. Holmes stood and wrapped a smoking jacket around his body, though he neglected to sash it shut. He strode to the kitchen, his front side resembling the display of a Viennese sausage shop.
“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.
I’d once asked Holmes about the characters of the two Scotland Yarders he worked with. The pick of a bad lot, he’d replied, and as jealous of his deductive skills as a pair of professional beauties. Holmes had assured me that both Gregson and Lestrade were quick and energetic, but conventional—in every respect. Early on, he’d suspected that they “had their knives into one another,” a slang term for men of our persuasion who bed each other, but later he had changed his mind. Despite repeated attempts, neither the sour Lestrade nor his cheerier partner had ever given in to Holmes’ self-described charms. Looking at Gregson’s reddened face now, I wondered whether or not my dear flat-mate ever made mistakes in his assessments.
The newlyweds remained on the floor between Holmes and I, their oral cavities stuffed with our substantial tools. Breaking away, Hope and Strangerson turned to one another and kissed excitedly before switching positions so that each now had a new cock in their mouth. Caught up in a riot of sensations, my flatmate and I came close to one another, our arms thrown around each other’s shoulders, our foreheads leaning together as we watched the stunning performance beneath us. By this point, we had all removed our clothing and I relished the view of Hope’s naked hirsute body engaging in deftly swallowing Holmes’ copious beauty, which was still unparalleled among all that I had seen in the world. Strangerson’s soft tongue swirled around my own thick shaft, causing radiations of absolute joy to emanate from my loins.
Holmes shrugged. “A French aristocrat’s son. Jean-Pierre, I believe. He asked me to help him find a suitable hotel for a man of his tastes while in England. We came to a mutually beneficial agreement regarding his price.”
“Of course not,” I said.
Holmes continued: “But I must say, Watson, I am surprised. You are giving Gregson a fine education in male bonding, but appear to be withholding half the pleasure.”
He smiled. “I suppose there are a few particulars you might have to leave out of this Study in Fornication, else the masses would be horrorstruck.”
Soon, we were rollicking, my shaft plunging in and out of his depths, both of us shouting in ecstasy. His body was unbelievable, taut and elastic at the same time. Once he was opened up, we switched to a position Stamford enjoyed even more; he on his back as I faced him, his legs spread like an insatiable queen. Each thrust now hit that special spot inside him, the prostate gland we’d seen so many times in medical drawings, giggling and aroused at the same time.
At the door, we were met by a tall, white-faced, light-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion’s hand with effusion. A momentary glance between Mr. Holmes and the detective made me suspect that they knew each other both professionally and Biblically, but I could not say for certain. After all, I am not a consulting sexual detective.
It seemed that there was nothing left to do but introduce my considerable cock to his eager receptacle and, with Gregson encouraging me the whole way, I doused my shaft in lotion and placed the head against his outlet. With almost no effort, my crown vanished into the enticing compartment and then the entire length glided past Gregson’s voracious arsehole.
Mr. Drebber eyed my companion and I with suspicion. “What is their business here?”
Some of the men smoked cigars or pipes and most held drinks in their hands. They chatted amiably with one another, hands caressing sides, lips brushing against bare skin. Off to one side a group was dancing with the music; in pairs, like frontiersmen. While I have been with my fair share of prostitutes and even entered a molly house or two in my life, this scene was unlike anything I’d ever before experienced. The atmosphere was so open and unguarded, the attitudes so cavalier in regards to sins of the flesh. Here and there, I even saw men engaging in sexual acts, wantonly and without regard as to who was watching. Though I had just spent my seed in Drebber, I could feel lust reawakening within me.
My companionability seemed to help calm him once again and the fact that I had referred openly to matters normally approached discreetly furthered the air of familiarity between us. He took another whiskey and was on the verge of saying something before thinking the better of it. He formed a new question. “How is it that you and Holmes came to know one another?”
My lips slid up and down his cock, each movement bringing him further into my throat, and my face closer to his body. Pulling him all the way out, I squeezed his sopping wet shaft and then plunged all the way to the base, burying my nose in the curls of his pubic hair. I did this several more times, Stamford convulsing with unbridled delight.
“Why is that?”
“And the florid face?” I asked.
Holmes stood right next to me and, at that moment, leaned over to whisper in my ear, “I hope you won’t mind if I borrow this.”
“I asked if the man had left behind anything in his room after absconding and the deskman showed me a single telegram that had been lying upon the floor in his room. It was dated from Cleveland a month ago, and contained the words ‘J.H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this message.”
At first, I directed the thrusting. Stroking forward, I was able to evacuate most of his magnitude from my cavity, bringing my cockhead nearly to his chin, before plunging him all the way back inside, driving us both to ecstasy. But then he took control, ploughing me a brisk pace, his magnificent implement lunging expertly in and out. The sensation was celestial, my entire being opening from his skill and proficiency. I would not be surprised if our jubilant cries could be heard in Eton.
Nursing my annoyance with the huqqa hose, I sank deeper into a stupor. Who does Holmes think he is—a debauched Casanova expecting everyone to bend to his disgusting whims? If the price of this hedonistic lifestyle was relinquishing control over my own power, then perhaps I’d prefer to return to Baker Street alone tonight.
After some time, I stood and the two of us got to work unbuttoning my coat and shirt, the prodigious hairs of my chest peeking from my undershirt and suspenders. Stamford undid the buttons of my tweed trousers and reached into my pants. Taking the bulk of my cock into his hand, he pulled it out and placed it against his.
“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.”
“Who is that man?” I said, pointing at the bare arse in the living room.
“It’s no matter,” I said, feeling at the height of relaxation. Gregson’s sudden entrance should have sent me scurrying, but it instead gave me no qualms. There was a sense of satisfaction at having my nearly-nude body on display, the tuffs of chest hair peeking through my undershirt, especially for a delightful dish such as himself. Though I have heretofore neglected to mention it, Gregson was an exceedingly handsome fellow, with enthralling emerald eyes and a neat blond beard adorning his cheeks. He was solidly built, like myself, and I could tell that the physique of a boxer lay concealed beneath his tight-cut checkered suit. His innocent distress made him all the more endearing.
Realization dawned upon Strangerson now. His eyes grew wide as he leapt from his repose. Without another word to his father, he ran from the room, his feet carrying him out into the crepuscular dusk and straight to Jefferson Hope’s house, where he knocked upon the door. At the sight of his friend returning to him, Hope’s heart filled with joy. But he remained on guard as soon as he saw that Strangerson was panting, clearly worked up into some extreme emotional state. The two men gazed at one another across the threshold, each unable to utter a single sentence.
“Because that is the manner of my attraction—towards persons of my own sex.”
Holmes smiled as he finished putting on his clothes. “My companion and I found Mr. Drebber quite the charming fellow. They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains. In which case, Drebber might be considered a luminary of our time.”
Gregson eyed Mr. Drebber about this piece of information. “It that true? Was your secretary here recently?”
Even soft, I must admit my tool was an appealing prize, dangling down toward the floor as it stiffened. Drebber was scandalized yet entranced by my thickening dick. As if it were a treat presented to a dog, Holmes grasped my sausage and shook it enticingly.
“That was quite delightful,” I said, believing he might be done. In certain cases, I have seen men grow embarrassed and uncomfortable as soon as they achieve their orgasm and I did not wish to have Gregson turn panic-stricken.
“Right then,” said Holmes, with a merry laugh. “I think we may consider things settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.”
11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
Freed from their constraints, the two men took to caressing each other’s bare buttocks, running their hands up one another’s backs, and pressing their legs together earnestly. Their existence became a riot of touch and smell and taste as they took to exploring their bodies with every extremity they could press into service. Hope moved around his young friend’s frame and embraced him from behind. His hardened implement slipped comfortably between Strangerson’s rounded butt cheeks and he heard his companion give a cry of surprise and delight.
The two of us sat across from one another, neither apparently able to come up with something further to say. Holmes bit his lip and gazed into my eyes.
“We are the Mormons,” answered his companion.
“You know, John,” he said. “There is something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
“The sensation was rapturous, so overwhelming to me to feel another man pleasuring my extremity that I gave not even a second thought to doubts or reservations. Napayshni worked with accomplished grace, sending me into convulsions of pleasure as his fingers danced over my rigidity. He knew how to drive me forward toward the erotic edge of orgasm, only to pull back at the last moment and let my sensual energy recede enough to delay my outburst. His digits caressed my swollen testes, tenderly rubbing the base of my shaft and stroking me toward paradisiacal ecstasy.”
Stamford took my breath away. He leaned against a wooden vanity in the low light, his body barely concealed beneath his undershirt, underwear, socks, and garters. The muscles in his shoulders were well defined, his abdomen a perfect specimen beneath the tight cloth. Fair hair sprouted from his legs, and I recalled how smoothly my own legs had once slid against them. His eyes shone like sapphires as he pushed the flaxen bangs of his hair from them.
“One night as I returned from a hunt with the other warriors, I opened the flap to Napayshni’s teepee and found a shocking sight. Another white man was within, thrusting himself into Napayshni. The stranger donned the hat and bandana of a cowboy but was otherwise entirely nude. He wore a wooly beard and his chest was bursting with burly chest hairs, his proportions as thick and well-developed as Napayshni’s, who crouched on his hands and knees beneath the man. The two of them howled with effort and pleasure.”
Both Strangerson and Hope now doffed their clothing and placed them in a safe space. Though he tried, Strangerson could not force his eyes to turn away from Hope’s limp organ, which seemed to be more inflated than during other previous swim sessions. His gaze also traced over Hope’s incredible physique and the velvety hairs which covered his legs and chest, his masculinity seeming to dwarf Strangerson’s own timid smoothness. Hope tried to disregard his friend’s interest, knowing that it could never lead to anything ameliorative for the two of them.
“Why Watson, you know that I am the very model of discretion when it comes to matters like this.”
Even with this much readiness, this next part always took a bit of finesse and patience. I placed my erection against Stamford’s hole, pouring a copious dollop of oil on it. When I felt Stamford had relaxed the proper amount, I tipped my hips forward ever so slightly. As the head slid into Stamford’s quivering compartment, shockwaves of pleasure undulated through my body. Stamford no doubt felt the same, as his breath quickened and his eyes widened. He kissed me deeply and requested that I please continue. With slow and careful movements, I slipped farther and farther inside him, eventually bringing the base of my dick against his buttocks.
“Go ahead,” Holmes said in a deep and commanding voice.
Catching his breath, Gregson laughed heartily and leapt into our welcoming laps. He wrapped his arms around both Holmes and I, planting appreciative kisses upon our mouths and bodies. We three soon decided to retire to Holmes’ bed, where we lay and napped, Gregson comfortingly squeezed between us. My hands traced lazily over his figure, occasionally daring to run over Holmes’s naked muscles as well, while I drifted off to sleep.
8. Anatomy.—Highly accurate to the point of unseemliness.
In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons: and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristic of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
Holmes licked Drebber, reaching down to smear precum on his shaft and stroke it. The stimulation sent Drebber into fits, driving his mouth all the way to the base of my cock. The sensation was celestial and I couldn’t help but pump my hips ever so slightly, though I wasn’t sure Drebber could handle such an incursion into his gullet. He took it like a champion, pulling himself most of the way off and then plunging back to fully envelop my rod.
Gregson paced, seeming to wish that I were more properly attired. But he did what any good Englishman would do in an uncomfortable situation and ignored it. I must admit to deriving some pleasure from watching him struggle.
Sherlock Holmes came over, his tie already loosened, his jacket gone, and placed his hand on my knee as he sat down beside me. “Are you having fun, my friend?” he asked.
Hope could feel his friend’s emanating desire, taking great care to work slowly and methodically on Strangerson’s rear. He nuzzled his nose between the bouncing butt-cheeks, snaking his tongue from the base of the Mormon’s bullocks to the top curve of his backend and then repeating the action with zeal. Strangerson grunted from the effort, feeling his pucker loosening and giving way to Hope’s probing tongue. Hope managed to slip his explorations a short way into his friend’s delectable channel, savoring the elated cries issuing from Strangerson’s mouth.
We continued in this manner for some time, and I enjoyed being both observer and participant in our revelry—watching Holmes expertly lunge his colossal grandeur into Drebber’s enthusiastic slot while my own implement slid between his heavenly lips. Soon, I could feel the tightening of my testes that indicated the impending critical period. The other two men must have begun to feel the same, as their breath quickened and passionate exclamations increased. Holmes grasped Drebber’s torso and dove into him with greater force and urgency. Drebber trembled with excitement; the three of us grunting like a troop of baboons.
I tipped my head in amazement, happy to focus on something other than the embarrassment that we had both just experienced. “Is that so? Well I am eager to hear the conclusion.”
Brazenly, he touched the bump at Lestrade’s crotch, causing the detective to jump back flustered.
Spotting another circle of burly men, I walked over and got down on the floor between them. Their previous cocksucker had just departed and so I offered my services to the proffered appendages, each wet with spit and pre-ejaculatory fluid. A half dozen dicks surrounded me now and I took one in each hand and a third in my mouth, delighting as the remainder took turns slapping my face with their shafts and bullocks. My existence became nothing beyond the consuming of cock as each man took his turn between my lips.
Hope winced, as if wounded, but managed to speak in an even voice. “That is good. Marriage is a great sacrament among your—that is, our people. Are you not happy?”
I elected for the former. Holmes showed me to my bedroom, which was comfortable. The kitchen was small but would serve our needs and the living room was airy and, even with a naked man sprawled out on the floor, cheerfully furnished. Jean-Pierre stirred as we entered, rising slowly. He grinned as I attempted to look away from his limp organ and made no attempt to hide his nakedness. He sprawled out on a plump sofa, the hair at his crotch as dark as that on his head.
Finally, Gregson cried that his critical period was almost upon him. Here Holmes did a perverse thing and slid his hospitable channel off Gregson’s engorged implement. He tapped at my shoulder and bade me disconnect myself as well, suggesting that the two of us sit side by side upon the couch. At first the direction gave me displeasure, but then Holmes instructed that Gregson bring himself to completion before us so that we could both enjoy the sight. Smiling, I flung myself in a seated position beside Holmes and encouraged Gregson’s routine as well.
“Ah, but first, my dear Watson, I must explain how it is that I arrived at this most inevitable of deductions. The facts before yesterday had been thus: I’d learned from Lestrade that Drebber and his secretary Strangerson were last seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third, that is, two days ago. At two in the morning the next day, Drebber had called Scotland Yard, telling them he had come home to find his house burgled. The question which confronted me was to find out how Strangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the supposed crime, and what had become of him afterwards. Now, from my informants at Rache, I had learned that this public appearance had been a sham. The last time Drebber and Strangerson had truly been together was when they both visited the club later that same evening, around 10.30.”
“Why Watson,” said Holmes, grinning at the carnal sight before him. “My impression was that we’d agreed to keep such things confined to the bedrooms.”
Yet rather than cry out and try to stop his companion, Strangerson was entirely entranced by the erotic performance. Hope’s brawny body was tensing in a magnificent manner as he repeatedly abused his hardened tool. The furious pace and determined focus seemed to suggest that Hope was completely engrossed in his exertion. His having taken a daring position here so near to the others indicated that this action had been something he’d had no choice but to indulge in. Silently, Strangerson floated closer, scarcely aware that his own erection was now straining underwater in a turgid display.
At length, they joined the party and splashed with one another in the clear and inviting current. The Mormon youths laughed heartily, having invented a game of slinging river mud at one another and then tussling for dominance in the shallow water. Strangerson watched as a blond baker jumped upon the silt-covered back of a brown-haired companion, the two of them hooting as they fell with a great splash. He grabbed a glob of mud and turned to search for Hope, wishing to peg him with the sludge, but found his constant companion had somehow disappeared.
Twitching his moustache left to right, Saul gave me a wicked smile. He retracted his hand from my rigidity. “Of course. There are rooms we could go to for seclusion.”
“Vin Mariani?” he offered. I told him I thought it was a bit early for wine. “Nonsense,” said Holmes. “A cup of this is more stimulating that tea.”
Despite being upset, I was duly impressed. This mixture, whatever it was, would have probably come in handy at many times in my life. “What have you done?” I asked.
“But then he already had it with him, prior to the time of the robbery?”
Finally, he jumped up and produced several items that had apparently been the fruits of his search, listing each one as he handed them around.
The elder Strangerson spit on him. “You will never see my son again.”
It was then that I noticed Holmes, quite nearby, in much the same position as me. The man below him was that lowlife John Rance, though this time I saw his features in a more flattering light. Behind Holmes was Jack Saul, his massive instrument sliding to and fro inside Holmes’ Hellenic buttocks. Catching my eye, Holmes gave me an enthusiastic wink, and our excited expressions spoke volumes about all that we had encountered that night. Holmes began to cultivate a faster pace with his magnificent endowment, pushing back and forth between Rance and Saul in a manner that suggested a playful air but which was at the same time quite arousing.
“We eventually went our separate ways,” said Hope, his eyes downcast in remembrance. “It was for the best. He was a singular man and I needed to explore love beyond the confines of the tribe.”
“But if this is a place for gentlemen only, then what about Bess and her… attire?”
But I knew that life there couldn’t last, and I naturally gravitated toward London, that great metropolis into which the idlers and free-spirits of the Empire irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leaving a comfortless, meaningless existence, spending such money as I had, perhaps more easily than I ought. I lived on a stipend of eleven shillings and sixpence a day, which was barely enough to buy bread, whiskey, cigars, and have enough left over to enjoy some time with a skilled and flexible man.
“And marihuana?” Holmes asked.
This inflamed him even more and he began to tear off his own jacket as we continued kissing, undoing the clasps and fasteners of his clothing. He pulled back his head, his hand bonded to the outline of my thick endowment, as if he could scarcely believe its existence. Giving him what he wanted, I tugged at the waistband of my underwear and allowed my enormity to spring free. A joyous cry escaped his lips as he first glimpsed my rod, proudly erect within its bushel of hair, a drop of precum leaking from its tip. I smiled. Seeing men react to the sight of my cock is a pleasure that will never grow old.
Soon Drebber was working assiduously on both our stiffened instruments, moving back and forth between each one like a drunk man. He tried to fit as much of our proportions into his throat as he could with each pass, doing a rather commendable job of it. In similar circumstances in the past—a male lover beside me as a second one knelt at my crotch—I would be kissing the nearer companion. And so, I leaned toward Holmes now, parting my lips for an embrace.
6. Male sexuality.—Practical, but limited. Claims to tell at a glance the desires of different gentlemen, though I sometimes suspect he is inventing things.
Strangerson cocked his head to one side, understanding that there was something unseemly about the poem, though not quite comprehending its underlying message. The innocent confusion endeared him to Hope, who wished he could provide a demonstration of the verse to the inexperienced young man. A trickle of sweat traced down his neck and he tugged at the starchy collar that was common among the Mormons. The barest sliver of Hope’s chiseled pectoral muscle became uncovered, causing another bout of distress in Strangerson.
“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. It was child’s play.”
Another inch of his largesse slid into my slot, stretching my sphincter. My arsehole accepted the girth without complaint, the pucker pliable as soft butter. It drove me into a frenzy, running my hands through my chest hair, pinching my tender nipples, and making me shift my hips farther back to capture more of this man’s magical endowment. The grin on his face indicated his delight, as if he knew the agitation his instrument could induce, and he gave my buttocks a few encouraging slaps. He drove farther inside me and I welcomed his intruder with zeal.
“Returning to my side, he smeared his hand in unguent and easily slipped a finger inside me. His amatory actions had served to inflame my passions to a burning pitch and my rear was now rather relaxed as a consequence. His declared me ready to receive his grand implement. I was in such a frenzied state that I could hardly process his words, entreating him to just fuck me already.”
“Why, what is there against him?”
“Joseph!” Hope cried.
Hope looked away, his eyes falling into shadow. “What would you care to know?”
“And what is that?”
He was not studying medicine. He had, himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies, chiefly men, was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information about male behavior unless he had some definite end in view, beyond the obvious.
Lestrade stared hard at Holmes, and I wondered about the conflicting emotions within him; he seemed simultaneously furious at my companion’s aloofness and bitter that he had not been invited to our romp.
“That’s strange,” he said. “It appears that someone was trying to write the name ‘Rachel’ here on the back, but stopped. Is that your wife’s name, Mr. Drebber?”
I told him I was having a wonderful time and was quite glad that he was able to arrange these nuptial proceedings. “But could we please go over the particulars of the case? I don’t think I quite understood how you managed to solve it.”
We shifted positions a few times; he taking me on my back, then from behind while I crouched on all fours. Eventually, we settled on our sides, he spooning me as my left leg stuck straight up into the air. He played his fingers over my erection like a practiced musician on their favorite instrument, bringing me close to the edge but subsiding just before I came. All the while his unbelievable attribute dove into my trembling pucker, coaxing me farther and farther toward Arcadian bliss. With each ingress, I felt the pressure on my prostate, the crowding of my compartment, the astonishing hardness and strength of his enormity. I wanted this delight to be never-ending.
In spite of the pleasures around me, my mind turned back to the case. “How did you find that out?”
Thinking something might be amiss, I quickly opened the unlocked door and found Holmes entirely nude, thrusting himself into a young companion on the floor of the living room. This display of naked fornication in broad daylight was almost more than I could handle, though the two men took hardly any notice of me as I entered.
“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. Unless he was with a companion, it was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes, he spent his days at the chemical laboratory, sometimes on long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, though secretly I wondered if the drug that plagued his heart was love.
But at a debaucherous celebration in their honor, the married couple was in high demand and so it was not too long before Strangerson and Hope were called away to engage with other gorgeous men. Holmes and I stood there a moment after they left, grinning at one another like schoolboys. A nervous tickle spread through my belly as he approached within inches of my face.
Strangerson was still working away on Holmes’ sizeable dick as I came to stand in the circle.
“You seem to be a walking calendar of men’s proclivities,” I said. “You should start a paper on those lines. Call it ‘Sexual Gossip of Yesteryear.’”
1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.
The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to Jefferson Hope. “I see,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”
Holmes continued. “A pocket edition of Boccaccio’s ‘Decameron,’ with name of Joseph Strangerson upon the fly-leaf. And a letter addressed to Strangerson, referring to the sailing of a boat from Liverpool. It is clear that this man was about to return to New York.”
A flicker of a grin traced over Hope’s mouth. “Well surely you’ve heard the limerick: Young cowboys have great fear/that studs, once filled with beer/completely addle/would throw on the saddle/and ride them in the rear.”
“And what have you discovered Mr. Holmes?” he asked.
And I agreed. Whatever my feelings for Holmes, I wanted more than anything to enjoy myself during this masculine episode, to touch and be touched, to fuck and be fucked, and to watch others engage in sexual congress of astounding variety and exhilaration.
Holmes read the contents and told me it was a note from Lestrade. He asked us to come to number 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road.
Strangerson turned a deep crimson color and shook his head, unable to even voice the words to a negative response. He looked at his best friend, who had blossomed in health after his rescue, and once again felt the warm stirring in his abdomen. Hope was certainly a striking fellow, his face austere and economical, who seldom took to smiling beneath his feathery moustache. Farm work had given him an imposing frame, with thick and hearty shoulders, though the manner in which he wore his long hair somehow softened him. When looking at Hope, the words of Joseph Smith always came to Strangerson’s mind—how the Prophet had written that male friends “should lie down on the same bed at night locked in each other’s embrace talking of their love.”
“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It seems to me Stamford,” I added, looking hard at him, “that you have some reason for not wanting me to meet with this man. Are you afraid that I will come between you?”
The burly detective needed little encouragement, so close he was to divine bliss. With simian unrestraint he worked his foreskin up and down his shaft, concentrating intently on his final release. Holmes and I relished the recital, each of us stroking enthusiastically at our considerable members, our nearer arms flung around each others’ shoulders, our legs stimulatingly intertwined. My entire spirit was aflame with shameless pleasure, the display of Gregson and Holmes touching themselves sending overpowering elicitations through my brain. No doubt my sixteen-year-old self would be overjoyed about the resounding delights that lay ahead of him.
“Though he the penetrated one, Napayshni was completely in control of our sexual session, bouncing up and down on my dick and howling with utter abandon, his body beautiful and divine. The experience of my member sliding in and out of his tight pucker was incredible while the sight of his gigantic cock springing about and leaking a steady stream of fluid brought me to untamed vistas of delight. This was apparently Napayshni’s intention for he stopped just before I reached my orgasm and pulled his body off mine.”
As for me, my vision was filled with Holmes and his kind expression. He seemed to be regarding me in a way he never had before.
I marveled at this grown-up version of Stamford, far more forward than in our school days. Had his encounter with this Sherlock Holmes character had anything to do with it?
“Plural marriage is intended to diminish the great evil of self-pollution,” said the young Joseph Strangerson, reading from a book as the edges of his ears turned pink.
Holmes watched this action with lust and slid up beside me, placing one arm around my shoulder. With his other hand, he undid his own trousers, releasing the soft form of his monstrous entity. “You rather enjoy sucking large members, don’t you, Drebber?” he said.
The young scout felt his heart beating fast, though he knew not if it was due to his exertions running up the cliff or for some other reason. He explained to the gaunt man before him that his appearance was no delusion.
“It all sounds well and good,” I said, languidly stretching my arms. “Though I will have to put these ideas to Holmes to see what he makes of them.”
Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and seventy, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. His florid face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were flecked and dashed with mud; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre. He dismounted and leaned upon his weapon for support, his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggesting a wiry and vigorous constitution. Yet the man was dying—dying from hunger and from thirst.
“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.”
The two of us broke away, the enchanting spell between us reaching its natural endpoint. We smiled at one another, and it seemed that each of us was awaiting the other’s reaction before we could proceed. Holmes crooked his head to one side and then swung a muscly arm around my back, pointing me out towards the saturnalian sights around us.
Both men’s faces were stained with a deep, embarrassed red as they entered, having no doubt overheard our exertions with Drebber. Neither glanced at the stark-naked man on the floor, who seemed not to care much who saw him unclothed. Holmes buttoned his shirt without haste, though his lower half (and the immensity it contained) remained bare. I had to admit that I experienced no discomfort from the detectives’ presence either, and the informality of having the affair out in the open was relaxing. I could certainly get used to such an environment.
“Of course not! I’ve never seen hide nor hair of his—OOOOOHH!!”
“And his age?” I asked.
Holmes paid and she pulled aside the curtain to allow us in. As we passed, I was shocked to see that Bess wore nothing on her lower half, her bush displayed proudly for all to see.
He was returning east after a fruitless sojourn in the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver. His labors had come to little, though he had enjoyed an underappreciated position among the men in his encampment—that of a tension reliever for the all-male cortege of miners. Though each had taken their turn with his delicacies, they had at some point grown uncomfortable with indulgences in passions they considered unspeakable. Their shame and disgust at their own desires had led them to rally against the man and so he, after overhearing a plot to dispose of him, had disappeared into the wilderness before anything foul could befall him.
Hope could have smiled at this endearing entreaty. Though Strangerson’s words were as yet immature, he knew what his companion desired. As he continued kissing his friend, he began to undo the buckles of both of their belts. Within seconds, their pants and underwear were around their ankles, and their members each sprang free. Strangerson gasped when Hope’s rigid erection smacked against his bare thigh, a phenomenon he could have scarcely imagined happening just a few short days ago.
The sights, sounds, smells, and sensations of the scene sent me into conniptions of unbridled pleasure. Without delay, I drove the full length of my erection into Gregson’s inviting warmth and began to buck both of our hips together. This induced him to plunge in and out of Holmes’ slick slot, producing the most orgasmic of cries from his mouth. His breath quickened and he tore at his beard and brow—indications of the tremendous dual commotions now traveling through his body. I certainly envied him. It’s not every day that a man gets to delve his dick into a fine and eager opening while simultaneously having his backend stretched by an expansive and hardy implement.
“It seems a rather queer practice,” said Strangerson, who felt the hot air suddenly oppressing him.
When I awoke, the two of us lay naked next to one another on the bed. Stamford was looking at me in an exultant daze, cheerily smirking. His fingers ran gently through the fleece of my belly.
“Certainly,” I managed to say. “Though I’m afraid I’m a bit out of my element now.”
“That will be one sovereign apiece,” she said, holding both Holmes and myself with a playful gaze. I had the sense that in her imagination we were performing outrageous acts.
Sherlock Holmes stood upon a dais between Mr. Jefferson Hope and Mr. Joseph Strangerson in front of a packed crowd at the club Rache. All three men wore suits of the finest cut and make, and each was brimming with happiness. Hope and Strangerson clasped hands between them, their eyes wet with tears, matching ruby rings slipped upon their fingers, as Holmes closed his Bible.
“The twitching of my compartment must have been too much for Napayshni, for now he lowed like a bison and began to shoot into my vestibule. He thrust farther than before as the copious ejaculate engulfed my antechamber with its flood of bliss. I could feel his emanations dribbling out and down my leg. After six or seven pulses, he completed his amatory operation and collapsed his bulk down atop me. I fell asleep with his arms wrapped tight around me.”
While locking his eyes upon the two of us, he picked up a small bottle from the floor and dabbed some lubricant upon his fingers. He rubbed his hole with his slippery hand and carefully inserted a digit into the rose-colored crevice. The routine had its intended effect—almost absentmindedly, I began to once again slide my wide contrivance into and out of Gregson’s snugness. Holmes smiled and nodded his head encouragingly, pressing another finger into his enticing slot.
“’Certainly,’ they answered. ‘After waiting in vain, he went off to find the gentleman and hasn’t been seen since.’”
Later, I stepped away from the small dancing floor, my muscles sore from hours of merrymaking, my brain lubed up with great amounts of beer. I had been cavorting with the rest of the men as a banjo and squeezebox played entertaining tunes. Many in the crowd were sweaty and beginning to disrobe. Needing a moment to myself, I took a seat at the sidelines.
Twice during his scrutiny, he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter and exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still, I had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.
Though he immediately understood what Strangerson was referring to, Hope’s reticent face betrayed no emotion. He merely looked at his friend and said that he had been caught up in a moment of weakness. He told Strangerson to erase it from his mind.
With ardor in his bright green eyes, he flipped over, placing his stomach on the couch and thrusting his buttocks out obscenely. He ordered me to drive my tongue between his cheeks, exclaiming that he needed to feel my appendage stuffing his antechamber before the day was through. Such an alluring invitation could not lightly go unfulfilled and I quickly heeded Gregson’s request.
“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.
And gratifying your own desires in the process, I thought, though I didn’t utter this idea aloud. Instead, I said: “Do you mean to say that you can deduce the precise sexual desires of any man who you see on the street?” This was among the points in my list that I considered to fantastical to believe.
My hand wrapped around his dick, taking occasional pauses to re-lubricate, we continued in this manner as if lost in a shared trance. Each movement forward brought forth a wellspring of bliss, the reverse course similarly sending out enchanting rushes. I was lost. Lost within my body, within Stamford’s arse, within the two of us connected in love. Shudders passed through Stamford as I persisted with my pleasurable invasion. It was clear he could stand it no longer.
Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done all that can be done,” he said. “It’s a queer case, though, and I knew your taste for such things.”
Gregson remained rigid and aloof, giving me no indication of his thoughts. The man began to colour even more. “That would have been entirely inappropriate.”
Holmes downed his glass and perked up. “Would you like to tour the place?” he asked. “Or perhaps you would like to relieve some tension with Jean-Pierre?” He smiled wickedly. “He is a young rooster and if you give him a few minutes, I’m sure he would be ready to go again.”
He turned a shade pale as he realized that he appeared to have caught me at an inopportune time. Averting his gaze, he suggested that he should have announced his coming. But some glimmer in his eye suggested that his finding me in this fashion was not entirely to his dissatisfaction.
“I don’t recall you using the word ‘happily’ at any point,” said Holmes with a casual air.
“It was an interesting time,” was all he said to Strangerson’s inquiry.
Momentarily stunned, I tried to make sense of his system. But my body was rather aflame, Drebber’s lips now sliding past the midway point of my shaft, and rational thought somewhat beyond me. Holmes took the opportunity to leave me and sidle up behind Drebber, who was on all fours on the floor. Carefully, he undid Drebber’s belt and removed his trousers and underpants. Like two rounded hillocks, his naked arse stood out, covered in small black curls. The tuft of his bullocks peeked from between his parted legs, which were thick as tree trunks. Below, I could see his plump cock, dripping pre-ejaculatory fluid at a remarkable rate. Drebber seemed to be in a state of frenzied anticipation, more aroused than I had seen any man in some time.
Gregson bit his lips and turned his head away. “Perhaps.”
“Please sir,” he said, touching a light brown forelock. “I have the cab downstairs.”
But even if their noisy session had not been audible well across town, it was unfortunately doomed from the start. For the neighbors had seen young Strangerson enter the house hours earlier and, suspicious, had alerted the relevant authorities. At that moment, Strangerson’s parents had gathered at Hope’s doorway with the other elders of the city. Hearing the terrifying din within, the crowd clustered at the door and forced it from its hinges. The sight before them nearly caused a riot.
“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised by his enthusiasm. I picked at the spot where the fluid had been and found it completely clean. “Though next time, I would prefer if you gave me some notice beforehand.”
“Though I wished he would leave me alone, so great was my love for Napayshni that I agreed to follow his lead. Alone in his teepee once more, my companion tried to clarify several things to me. He said he had met the cowboy many years ago and that the man passed through the village from time to time. Napayshni enjoyed his company and his cock, and told me he had several other lovers, including a Frenchmen trapper, a Russian merchant, and even Indians from different tribes. He tried to explain the complexity of these interdependent relationships but our mutual vocabulary was not up to the task of what he wished to convey.”
9. Sensational Literature.—Immense.  He appears to know every detail of every scandalous encounter committed in the city of London and beyond.
The question on the tip of my tongue was too embarrassing to say out loud. I merely stared at the man, perhaps too leeringly, for he gave me a perplexed look as he left.
Seeing these three, while also surrounded by two more unbelievable creations, penetrating and being penetrated, it was all too much for me. I began to come, my fourth or fifth attainment that evening, the orgasm both understated and yet euphoric. I believe I achieved what the Eastern mystics call nirvana, that moment when one is caught up in the awe-inspiring elation of being. My backdoor partner, perhaps feeling my twitches, achieved his own critical period then, and I felt a warm flood of semen rush out to intermingle with all the others inside my cavity. Our third must have also been quite close, for his dick now issued forth a parabolic fountain of cum that shot up and landed in a glob on his furry chest.
“It is no matter, of course,” said Holmes, placing his hat upon the coatrack. “I have been working for some time trying to crack the nut of Gregson’s desires. Glad that you, my dear Watson, have finally managed it.”
I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way—
“What was it like,” asked Strangerson. “Among the cattlemen of the frontier? You’ve said so little to me about that chapter of your life.”
I was impressed. “But you still didn’t tell me how you knew it was thirteen.”
“No,” said Stamford, frowning. “He is not an easy man to draw out, even for those he is physical with. But he can be communicative when the fancy seizes him.”
“He rather enjoys having his armpits licked,” said Holmes, demonstrating with a protracted taste of the man’s underarm that made Rance laugh. “And this one—” Holmes scrutinized the Moslem on the couch beside me— “He seems like he’s up for a bit of anything.”
“The curved dome of his lusciousness slipped past my lips and I was like a man taking his first taste of whiskey. The flavor was heady and restorative, with an undertone of salt that somehow mesmerized me and bade me take him further into my maw. The experienced healer knew precisely how much of his protuberance he could proffer, filling my mouth with his hardness but stopping short of rendering things uncomfortable for me. My own member was inflamed beyond measure by this point, especially as he continued to stroke it with all his talents and skills.”
Righting myself, I begged Saul to stop. “Please. I want to feel you. But not here—I need privacy.”
“Yes, that’s very good,” Holmes said encouragingly. He placed his hand in Drebber’s curls and bade him forward on my member. Drebber complied, taking more of my halfway-hard reward into his mouth. He sucked on it gently, inflating me further.
“Are you saying that more-experienced ranchers would mount their assistants like horses?” asked Strangerson, suppressing his odd feelings.
“I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”
The party lasted for hours and I came several times that night, not all of which I need to relate. During the final occurrence, I had once again found myself pressed between two men. The one below me was on his back, his bronzed skin suggesting he was an Italian, or perhaps Greek, a profuse carpet of hair covering his chest, which I delighted in tugging as I pressed my cock into his accommodating receptacle. The man penetrating me was a gigantic Viking, with a bright red beard and long locks of hair that I ran my other hand through as he repeatedly incurred his way into my tender pucker. The rhapsodic pleasure bathing me from all sides could not have been more agreeable, and I was in rapturous paradise, consumed by carnal matters.
Holmes did not seem to be listening to the man, running his nimble fingers wildly over the dresser in the room, as well as here, there, and everywhere. During his examination, my companion wore the same far-away expression which I had remarked upon before. So swiftly did Holmes move that none of the assembled persons had any time to react to the rudeness of the intrusion.
They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a glint of gunmetal grey, showing up hard and bright against the rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word ‘Redskins’ was on every lip.
“Excellent. Now would you say that that you and your former secretary, Strangerson, were quite recently at the club called ‘Rache’?”
As one rather large specimen filled my throat, I looked up to see a familiar face. The sapphire eyes and elegant moustache of Jack Saul greeted me with a wink as he bucked his oversized instrument against my lips. A moment later, I was drowning on the dick of Jefferson Hope, who was kissing Jack Saul with abandon. The next man in line, I didn’t recognize, though his instrument tasted so heavenly that I impelled him to finish inside my mouth, tasting the delectable volume of cum he deposited within. This stranger, who was handsome beyond compare, then turned his arse towards me and requested that I play with his pucker, an appeal I could not readily refuse.
The Moslem came forward to hug me from behind and pinch both of my incredibly-aroused nipples, diving his contrivance in and out of my slit as he did so. The oscillations were transferred to the long-haired man below me, who wriggled and whimpered with joy, his throat simultaneously stuffed by a rather large instrument. The scenery and sensations were all too much for me and so I achieved my first orgasm of the night, expelling a donation into my penetrated partner just as the Moor shuddered behind me. I felt a delightful rush into my own chute, leaning back my face to kiss the beauty now filling me with his cream. Almost as soon as I pulled out of the hairy-arsed man beneath me, another enormous cock squeezed its way between those extraordinary and voracious cheeks.
Stamford reached back and pressed a hand onto my rear to push me deeper inside, moaning in uncontrolled joy. I hoped that no nosy neighbors were listening in on our rutting session but by now was too far committed to do anything about it. Holding Stamford against me, I gently sank into his body, enjoying the passion of our bond. Sweat dripped down my face as I pulled back again, looking down the fur of my chest and stomach to Stamford’s arse and my personal article lodged within. Gently, I began to ride him.
“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had slept with thirteen men in the last two months.”
I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I said to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.” Annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation, I thought it best to change the topic.
This quirk of personality gave no bother to Hope’s closest friend among the Mormons, the youth Joseph Strangerson, who had educated and inducted the convert into the ways of his new religion. Strangerson had been but seventeen when the party came upon Hope on the alkali plain, and he had felt an instant connection with the outsider, who was only a few years older than him. Strangerson had never quite fit in with the religious society himself, a fact that gave great consternation to his father, the Elder Strangerson. The young Joseph had been a fey child, lithe and taken to bouts of overexcitement, and his father hoped that the rugged Hope’s taciturn ways would rub off on his son.
I moved in as close as I dared to Stamford. “You are telling me he is of… our persuasion, correct?”
Swallowing, I tried to think of an answer. My yearning was glowing hot and bright but the situation, and perhaps the hashish, held me immobile. My mind fluttering like the pages of a book caught in a draft, I sputtered nonsensical utterances.
Stamford looked at me like a caught lamb. “Quite so,” he said. “Though that needs not be the only criterion for two men to get along.”
Allowing a thin stream to drizzle on Stamford’s hole, I licked my lips. As if his posterior did not look delectable enough, the cocoanut oil would now impart a certain savoir faire to the tang of his arse. My tongue slid eagerly between his cheeks and found its target as Stamford mewled with delight. Throwing his head back, he muttered incomprehensible syllables. I had to grab my aching shaft and rub it a few times to relieve the sexual pressure as my nose and tongue dove forward.
Lestrade’s dark look suggested that he had experienced similar circumstances in the past with Holmes, and he didn’t like them. He was desperately trying his best to suppress the ardor we had roused in him, though his rigid member was visible through his trousers. Gregson, too, had clearly been stirred, though he managed to address us while avoiding meeting our eyes.
“Oh, Gregson,” I thought. “You have yet to see what delights lay in store for you.”
Holmes paid me no mind, spreading the sticky substance on his finger upon the lapel of my coat. I realized that it was a spot of post ejaculatory fluid that had seeped from my ducts following my escapades with Stamford. With a mixture of disgust and shock, I looked at the visible streak and asked Holmes why he had soiled my clothing.
As a man who appreciated the male form, I had always taken great care of my own, engaging in isometric exercises to keep myself in top shape. After the army, and even after my injury, I was in peak condition, my muscles strong as thick ropes. My hand rested now on the slight potbelly that indicated my love of beer, yet still I was often told admiringly by the men I took to bed of my beauty.
In a moment the young fellow had dismounted, fastened his horse, and was ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object that had aroused his curiosity. He advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of a practiced scout. The watchers from the plain below could see him flit from rock to rock until his figure stood out against the skyline. He gave out a cry of alarm and threw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment.
With an air of perfect restfulness, Holmes spread butter and jam on a blackened slice of toast. He informed me that Gregson had left just a moment ago, saying that the detective had been rather flustered at the thought of explaining to the men in his office why he had on an identical suit to the one he wore yesterday.
Drebber stumbled forward, fell to his knees, and parted his mouth like he was partaking in a sacrament. The head of my cock came to rest on his tongue, causing an electric thrill to run through my spine. He closed his eyes, as if tasting the sweetest fruit plucked from the most tantalizing tree.
His head turned to watch the decadence all around us—the swallowed cocks, the fingered arseholes—but then came back to look me squarely in the eyes. “I simply wished to express how much I have enjoyed meeting you. You are quite unlike anyone I have encountered. I hope that we will have a long and lasting friendship, you and I.”
The man needed no instruction in his enjoyment, pulling out my towering instrument and rubbing it all over his face like a puppy playing with a prized possession. The glossolalia of a frenzied worshiper issued forth from his mouth, an overexcited series of moans, sighs, and exuberant exclamations. Some coherent words appeared, and I gathered that he was thankful for my introducing him to the pleasures of manhood. He told me that he had also been stirred by the sight of nude men but had always deeply suppressed such desires. It was only when he walked in on Holmes, myself, and Drebber earlier today that he realized the extent of his longing. Our unrestricted activities had reawakened a lust that he considered long since extinguished.
Here I cut in. “So that shrinks the time with which Strangerson is unaccounted for.”
Thank you to anyone who read all the way to the end. This was a fun piece to produce. Comments welcome here or at sirarthurpornandoyle@yahoo.com
“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I’m a sexual consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have many men who are looking to find other men to satisfy their proclivities. And since people of our persuasion must be inconspicuous, hiding what we do in the shadows, there is the penchant for misdeeds. I have always had a knack for spotting the cravings of other men, their likes and dislikes in bed. I enjoy applying my abilities toward interesting cases that might otherwise go unsolved.”
“So thought I!” said Holmes, shooting a finger into the air. “And yet I knew there must be more. Considering once again the ruby ring and what had become of it, I wandered about the area, looking for a jeweler. My initial thought was that Strangerson had decided to sell it.”
The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, and my protestations of how little he attracted me physically merely a ruse. I confess that this man stimulated my curiosity, and often I endeavored to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered how objectless my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends (nor lovers) who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily life. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much time in endeavouring to unravel it.
“I… well…” Drebber seemed at a loss for words, hypnotized by the sight before him.
Holmes smiled. “You provided me with a wonderful reward. After the concert, I spent some time digging into our mystery surrounding Dreber’s ruby ring, and was able to solve almost the entire case.”
“Napayshni covered his enormity in lubricant and cupped my buttocks with his steady palms. While crouching below me, he pulled up my hips and then slowly lowered them down over his crotch. Remembering the training he had just given me, I unfastened my aperture just as his member touched the responsive opening. His colossal cockhead began to stretch my pucker. The sensation of my hole giving way to his enormous member is one that I will relish for the remainder of my life. I still bring it to mind when pleasuring myself alone at night.”
The convert paused, wondering how much of himself to reveal to the youth. But there was no use with a masquerade anymore. He decided to tell Strangerson everything and then quit this city, never to return.
“By the way,” I said, stopping suddenly and turning to Stamford. “How the deuce did he know that I slept with thirteen men in the last two months?”
He pointed at my crotch, where the outline of my rock hard equipment was visible through my trousers. Flummoxed, I did my best to cover it up. I took a swig from the offered glass. “Listen, Holmes. I am as libertine as the next man but I was not expecting to find you like this.”
“And do you know this man’s name or what he looked like?”
“You should fuck me,” Strangerson whispered, surprising them both. Hope came up and kissed his companion’s neck, telling the youth that such an act was not to be entered into lightly. It took practice and care, even with experience.
“’Had?’ I asked.”
He gazed into my eyes and told me he had long dreamt of a day such as this. While touching himself alone, he had often stuck his fingers within his craving cavity and even used cylindrical instruments on occasion to satisfy his vexing urges. Such details fueled my own desire and I pressed my husky figure against his, hammering my raging organ against his slippery buttocks. Unstoppering a bottle from the side table, I smeared my hand in unguent and tickled my fingers against his pucker. He entreated my ingress and soon I’d snuck my smallest digit into the tight opening.
Following the requisite amount of stimulation, Holmes stood and arched his arse away from Gregson’s tongue, wagging his posterior like a saucy ingénue. Gregson became once again confused but my lust-filled mind knew exactly what was necessary. Coating Gregson’s dick in ointment, I aimed it true and, directing his hips forward with my embedded instrument, plunged the head into Holmes’ hole. Both men gave a satisfied moan and I knew that my movements had been enthusiastically received. Looking back at me, Holmes winked his eye and nodded to indicate that we should proceed. Our combined bodies slid tenderly forward upon Gregson’s shaft, which sank ever deeper into Holmes’ randy receptacle. Gregson’s considerable bullocks finally came to rest within the cushioning crack of Holmes’ bottom.
The two men paused here, each scarcely believing the reality of their positions. Hope could have never explained to Strangerson at a point earlier in their friendship that the stimulation of one man’s hole with another man’s tongue was a suitable exploit. Strangerson would certainly have balked at the suggestion. The Mormon youth had never dreamed that such a feat would bring a man satisfaction and assuredly not the profuse pleasure that was currently radiating from his posterior. His pucker twitched with uncontrollable delight as the wet stimulus licked its way around his delicate orifice.
But now Saul introduced a new element, his finger gently probing at the spot behind my hairy sack. It moved in a posterior direction, landing directly in my twitching hole and sending electric enchantments up and down my body. Matching his movements, I explored his rear end, finding it smooth as his body save a ring of hair just around the opening. Naturally, my mouth gravitated that way. Shortly, my tongue had taken over for my fingers and he returned the favor in kind, each of us diving headfirst into the other’s sweaty crack. We relished our mutual anal-lingual stimulation, our hands running over each other’s glutes, occasionally reaching to tug at each other’s rods.
Young Strangerson lifted his head once more. “What do you mean, father?”
“My name is Jefferson Hope,” the wanderer said. “I was forced from a prospecting party far west of here. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuer and then at the long line of waggons on the plain below; “there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.”
“Who knows?” said Drebber, agitated but unable to turn away. “Paperwork most likely. We had recently traveled in the Continent together. Why the devil are you so fixated on him?”
At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.
“Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.
“Napayshni had given me some concoction to help with the healing and the world around me seemed dreamlike. Through the smoke, he smiled at me with his beautiful face. His cheeks were sharp as obsidian stones, the braids of his hair swaying gently as he sang a song of prayer. It was then and there that I began to fall in love with him.”
The living room door burst open and in came the fair-haired detective Gregson, oblivious to my disarray. “My dear fellow,” he cried, “congratulate me! I have made the whole thing clear as day.”
Before trying his luck with the silver lode, Hope had spent a year on a gaucho ranch past the Mexican border. The suntanned ranchers had been sensational and strong-featured, filled with virile machismo that often spilled over into sensuous actions. More than once, Hope had found himself entangled with a group of men grunting in a barn in Spanish at the end of a long day’s work. He had to suppress a rush of blood in his groin as the memories spilled through his mind.
Strangerson avoided his friend Hope for some days after this episode, unable to face the convert following his intrusive eavesdropping among the reeds. Not understanding the reason for this sudden change in their relationship, Hope took to moping about his house, emerging infrequently to wander about the city with a brooding expression. His neighbours comprehended that something was amiss, and gossip spread throughout the town.
“Leave your horse below and we will await you here, Joseph, my son,” the Elder answered.
Holmes gave a sequence of syncopated knocks that must have been a signal of some sort. After a moment, the door opened to a dark and warm waiting room, the air inside perfumed and musky.
“A fellow working up at the chemical laboratory at the hospital with whom I had an… encounter. Afterwards, he was bemoaning the fact that he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.”
Strangerson entered, a cavalcade of pronouncements fighting in his mind. He wished to tell Hope about his family’s plans but the words continuously failed to reach his tongue. Hope offered him a seat at the kitchen table and then brought the young man a cup of hot Mormon tea, which helped invigorate the youth and order his convoluted thoughts.
Of course, I wasn’t about to let slip this beguiling opportunity and so I tipped forward and planted a tender kiss on Gregson’s lips. He gave but a moment’s resistance, first pushing me away but then melting into my arms as we passionately embraced. Our bodies seemed magnetically charged, pressing together in a heady pull. I allowed my hand to enter beneath his coat, running my fingers over the shirt covering his nipples. Surprised and aroused, he gently moaned.
“I’ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued. “There was no robbery, simply the aftermath of two men trying hide a secret tryst in a house that doesn’t belong to them. I suspect you will encounter Strangerson and his Patent leather shoes soon. The other man is six feet high, in the prime of life, has small feet for his height, a florid face, wears coarse, square-toed boots and smokes a Trichinopoly cigar. He and Strangerson came here while Drebber and his wife were gone. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.”
“A hot sting of discomfort filled my breast. Though I didn’t know it at the time, this was the emotion known as jealousy. I ran from the teepee before Napayshni could rouse from his orgasmic state, seeking succor in the wild night. With tears in my eyes, I lay upon the grass and gazed up at the soft light of the moon. Soon, I heard a voice crying my name—it was Napayshni searching for me. He stood over me and asked if I would return with him to the tent, so that he could render an explanation for what had just occurred.”
His companion, Jefferson Hope, looked at the bashful youth with a laconic expression. “Self-pollution, eh? And what is that?”
Hope leaned down and kissed his companion’s back as he aimed his cockhead at the tight access point. It gave way with nary a moment’s hesitation. Strangerson felt his aperture open up to the delightful pleasure of his friend’s hard rod, its bountiful proportions sliding into him with ease. He cried with elation as Hope coaxed inch after inch deeper inside his virgin cavity. Hope could scarcely believe how obliging the young Mormon’s compartment was, and he moaned with unrestrained gratification. Instinctively, he began to buck back and forth.
“Lust now made itself known in the form of a swelling at my crotch. In my mind, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to practice the labors I had witnessed earlier between Napayshni and the cowboy. The idea of my companion’s large cock stroking its way inside me seemed among the most inciting scenes I could imagine. Seeing my desire, Napayshni pulled me down on the soft furs of his bed and soon we cooed together naked, each of our virilities rising as our limbs entwined in a delicate embrace.”
Hope’s feelings went out to the poor boy, so confused and ashamed at his actions. He wanted to caress his friend’s chestnut hair and tell him that there was nothing unclean about his experience. In fact, it was good and natural that he should encounter such emotions.
After my new companion caught the attention of passerby and asked him to bring us two beers, he turned to me. "Saul, Jack Saul, Sir, of Lisle Street, Leicester Square, and ready for a lark with a free gentleman at any time." He told me he was twenty-four and originally from Dublin.
He began, almost absentmindedly, to pick at the top button of his collar. “When did you first act upon your desires?”
At this moment, Holmes spoke up between his tongue lashes. “Mr. Drebber, I know how much you enjoy the feeling of a large cock in your mouth while another man bucks you from behind. Wouldn’t you like that right now?”
My brows were becoming crossed at having to pay attention to all the information Holmes was dispensing. “But then it seems you came to a dead end.”
The man he held sported wild brunet sideburns and a toothy grin. His face seemed rather low-brow for my tastes, with a crooked nose and a scar above one eye. He wore the pants and shoes of a constable, though the rest of his uniform seemed to have gone missing. Holmes appeared delighted with his find.
Just now, captured in Stamford’s hand, my beast rubbed against his. When lined up together, my cock extended a way past his; and its girth was noticeably thicker. Stamford was practically ensorcelled by this prize, his eyes unable to believe its dimensions. Like a man bewitched, he lowered himself down to the floor. No doubt any thoughts of Sherlock Holmes and his supposedly magnificent member were now fully banished from his mind.
Hope slipped his fingers up and down his well-proportioned instrument, working himself further and further into a lather. His exploring hands touched the sensitive head, the responsive shaft, the brimming bollocks. His congenial arsehole was crying out for stimulation and soon he took a digit and slipped it an inch or two past his constricted sphincter. He imagined the penetrating probe to be Strangerson’s tongue or perhaps even his member, loosening Hope at the beginning of a fuck session. Strangerson no doubt had a delightful instrument that would press its way into his compartment with eager relish, leading the Mormon youth to heights of pleasure he’d never previously dreamed of.
“It is just that I— that is, I believe to have figured out the case.”
Seeing the effect of this painful recollection on his dear friend’s face, Strangerson came forward. He stroked Hope’s stubbled cheek with a finger, causing Hope to look up in his eyes. A moment of high tension strung between the two of them.
Interminable minutes passed as we rode the cab to his place. For the benefit of the driver and others around, we embraced one another goodbye as I prepared to feint leaving him. We both took the opportunity to hold on for longer to one another than should have been proper. He palmed me a key and went inside.
“His titanic implement dove in and out of my aperture, causing my own member to rise once again. Napayshni’s broad chest pressed against mine as he came forward to kiss me, raising my legs high into the air. Changing the angle of his delightful ingresses also seemed to cause a doubling of its ecstatic effect. I didn’t know it then but Napayshni was hitting my prostate, a sensitive button inside every man’s tunnel that can greatly multiply his pleasure. I cried with joy and locked my legs around his back, petitioning him to pound me ever more.”
He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, forty years hence,” muttered Jefferson Hope, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.
“My passions were so provoked that I rested my hand on his solid buttocks and tried to press him further into my throat. I wished for nothing more than to drink every inch of his dick, to feel it slide in and out of my fore-end until nothing remained of living beyond this incredible feeling. Napayshni had unleashed my true nature—that of a cock-hound—and I had to give in to the desperate cravings that had long remained hidden within me. The healer laughed at my eagerness and prevented me from impaling myself too far. After some continued stimulation, he began to issue sounds that made me understand an offering was on its way.”
After the requisite motivating period, Hope rose and grabbed a bottle of olive oil from his kitchen cabinet. He returned to find Strangerson bent over the kitchen table, proudly displaying his aching opening like a wanton prostitute. Strangerson had slipped two fingers into his slit, pumping them back and forth to show his friend how amenable he would be to their sexual encounter. The sight fueled Hope’s cravings to a feverish level and he quickly dolloped his dick with lubrication.
And with that, he leaned in and planted his tender lips upon mine. Caught unawares, I melted into his embrace. Our intimate connection caused a swelling in my breast and I knew then and there that I was in love with Sherlock Holmes. Because of the earlier actions of our new companions, we were both in quite a randy state and so my hand slipped around the girth of his cock just as his hand did the same to my member. I tugged at his preposterous prominence, feeling its incredible size and weight for the first time. His own exploration of my implement sent inundations of bliss throughout my body.
I made myself comfortable on the seat. “In fact, I always smoke ‘ships’ myself,” I said.
Of course, my body had other needs that soon announced themselves. My pucker was now twitching expectantly and so I once again moved backwards over Saul’s body. His tip slipped unexpectedly into my compartment; the task happening so smoothly that it stunned me. Normally, I required a fair amount of digital encouragement to relax my purse strings yet here we were, Saul’s glans already working its way into my hole. Sighing with a combination of delight and surprise, I felt his stiffness dig slightly deeper. Saul looked at me as if to ask if everything was alright and I nodded to indicate that he continue.
“Napayshni brought me back from the brink in more ways than one. As I lay in his teepee, stripped of my clothing, he engaged in some sort of ceremony to drive out evil spirits, waving a smoking bundle of a local plant over my body. Napayshni himself wore naught but a loincloth for this particular ceremony. I must tell you, my friend, that though he was considered womanly by his tribe, this healer was masculine beyond compare. His legs were thick and sinewy, his arms bulging with strength. His skin was dark as fertile loam, his body expansive and brawny, like that of a powerful stag. Looking at him, I could not help but feel an aching desire in my manhood.”
I explained the particulars of our introduction, alluding only obliquely to my friend Stamford and the actions that tied us all together. But Gregson appeared to gather the subtext rather easily, swallowing a large dram from his glass as if to douse an internal conflagration blazing within him. In an agitated and somewhat high-pitched voice, he asked if I had always known of my attraction to other men.
I saw Holmes, his tall and well-built frame, his muscles bulging like Vitruvian Man. His eyes were sharp and piercing, watching the sweat-covered back of the man beneath him. His hair was wild, in a passionate disarray. The fur on his body was light but noticeable, curving around his nipples, pooling on his chest, and trailing down to his sex, where a rough tangle of hair sprouted at the base of his cock and covered his balls in a fine down. His companion appeared to be in his early twenties, with inky hair and icy eyes. He looked up at me with a flirtatious smile, clearly enjoying the show they were giving me.
The vows had been said, the rings exchanged. Holmes stated that, while he was certainly no man of the cloth, he had been inside of one not too long ago, and therefore wondered if some of that man’s priestly powers had been transferred to him.
Holmes shut his eyes for a moment and then looked up, seeing me for the first time.
I leaned forward for a kiss. But Stamford pulled back, his eyes reprimanding me. It helped me remember myself and the society I lived in. I might feel passionately about Stamford at the moment, but decency and decorum would not allow our emotions to exist outside this bedroom. We both shifted uncomfortably for a moment and I cleared my throat.
“That may be,” said Holmes. “But at the very least it will put the idea out there and then perhaps things can start to change.”
My hands ran over the bodies below me, circling Gregson’s nipples and sliding over Holmes’ musculature. Instinctively, a part of me knew that my flat-mate would allow this amount of touching, though a voice within told me not to caress his colossal cock lest I violate our tacit agreement with one another. How I knew this remained a mystery but I prided myself in starting to understand Holmes’ alien mind and his strange set of rules. Gregson himself was under no such prohibitions and I eagerly watched as he stroked the unimaginable immensity jutting from the grunting gentleman beneath him.
“It might not be a name. ‘Rache’ is also the German word for ‘revenge,’” I interjected, trying to helpful.
And with that, I fished out my own quite raging erection, eliciting peals of excitement from my audience. Several began to disrobe, touching themselves and their nearest companions with unrestrained lasciviousness.
“Is this really your first time?” I said, wrapping my arms his body as we both felt our connection.
7. Chemistry.—Profound.
Drebber, joyous tears streaming down his face, nodded while orally retaining my apparatus.
“Many women do.”
Hope, who enjoyed watching his friend’s discomfort, pretended to be thick. “What kind of abuse?”
“And who was the first?”
“Looking for lodgings,” I said, glancing around. “Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”
My tongue dove upon the tight aperture volunteered to me, savoring its contractions and the excited yelps I elicited from its owner. His buttocks were exceedingly hairy and I delighted in running my fingers up and down their forested curvature. Standing up, I tapped my hardness against this pliable rear entry. Encouraging calls came from both the men around us as well as my new partner, who pressed back his curly-haired head to give me a kiss. As my rod slipped into the first part of his slick slot, he gasped at my great size but grunted affirmatively to let me know the incursion had been appreciated. Our friends around us helped out, passing me a bottle of lubricant and even rubbing it over my fat tool when I pulled out for a moment to allow my companion to relax.
It was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes hailed a cab and ordered the driver to take us to an address near the West End, in Fitzrovia, a part of the City I had yet to become much acquainted with.
This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bent over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps, he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it!” he shouted to my companion. “I have found a re-agent that is capable of cleaning up the stains and leaving behind no trace.” Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.
This view must have borne fruit in Murray’s actions, as he carried me to safety at a base hospital in Peshawar, where I rallied. Though I will always be indebted to his bravery, Murray left me soon thereafter, called back to help wounded sufferers once again on the front lines. I can not blame him; it was wartime. And relationships like our did not have much place outside the battalion.
The woman bowed her head at the introduction. She was fortyish and wore a heavy coat over her fair frame, her raven-colored hair swept back tight. Giving me a secretive grin, she opened a second door into an even darker room. While my eyes adjusted to the low candlelight, Bess came to stand behind a small lectern placed in front of a lacey curtain. She removed her overcoat, revealing a scandalous kit—an ornate corset that cupped her breasts but left bare her entire arms and shoulders.
Hope, who was perhaps more forward than his new husband, came over and tugged at my ballsack. “It’s one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen.” He immediately dropped down and placed my head in his mouth, eliciting a satisfied exhalation from me. His soft tongue traced over the engorged tip of my implement as he sent it to explore the interior of my sensitive foreskin. The men around us broke into a Edenic state, their clothing doffed, their bodies beginning to writhe against one another in a lurid display of virile contentment. My eyes drank in the sight of beards and body hair, stiff sausages, downy buttocks, bushy crotches, shaggy legs, and all manner of gorgeous manhood beginning to consummate their desires around me.
“Somewhat,” I admitted.
On the very day that I reached this conclusion, I was standing in the Critereon Bar, when someone tapped me on the shoulder. Turning around, I recognized the bashful but handsome eyes of a young man who had been a dresser under me at Barts. His name was Stamford, and the sight of such a friendly face was indeed a pleasant thing for a lonely man such as myself. I smiled at Stamford as he blushed his greeting, no doubt recalling the time when we had indulged in passions that dared not see the light of day. Seeing an opportunity now to reenact some of our glory days, I invited Stamford to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.
Our activity must have been loud and overpowering for it wasn’t until we both heard the sudden sound of the door closing and locking that we realized there was someone else in the room.
As Hope engaged in his stimulating routine, he squeezed his eyes and played images of the nearby nude young men in his mind. He had been overtaken with emotion at the sights in the river, deeming the pleasure he’d receive greater than the risk he would take giving in to his desires. An imagined scene of unbridled hedonism now entered his brain—that of an orgy breaking out among the young Mormon men in the river, glistening dicks plunging into receptive puckers as they drove their nubile bodies together rhapsodically. During this debauched episode, he would of course induct Strangerson into the methodology of male sensuality. The youth would first be down on his knees with his tender lips squeezed around Hope’s cock and then bent over as Hope thrust his enflamed implement into the younger man’s supple aperture. He imagined the bucking, braying action in raunchy detail, envisioning every aching sensation of the masculine merrymaking.
I launched into a hearty laugh, knocking the virtuous detective with a friendly punch to the shoulder. “Ah, Gregson, I am only teasing. I know you are not interested in the pleasures that Holmes and I partake in. Please, let me refill your drink, it has run low.”
The scent of male sweat filled my nostrils as my endowment returned to the snug and sensuous compartment from which it had been removed. Rugged hands ran over my brawny chest as I slid forward and several companions leaned in to kiss me. I felt a feathery touch on the curve of my buttocks, its gentle pressure impelling me farther into the incredible chute of the brute below me. He howled with delight when I reached my maximum depth, stopping only when a precum-dripping dick was placed into his mouth. Both my instrument and my nipples had never felt so hard before, my body stoked to a place of inconceivable passion.
That sounded not unlike my own proclivities. After all, the world was filled with beautiful and erotically-charged men; even Stamford knew that I would never settle for a single person. ‘To have and to hold till death do us part’—as the mundane couples put it in their vows—would not suit me.
“I am certain. And here is another curiosity: all three of these men are followers of the Church of Latter-Day Saints.”
“Now, Mr. Drebber,” said Holmes. “At what point did you and your secretary first become lovers?”
When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. “If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,” I said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”
“Seems you’re making yourself comfortable,” said Holmes. “I myself have found a dashing companion. His name is John Rance.”
“Indeed, it is, my friend.”
He now led me over to the bed, sliding his body face-down over the blanket. I was enthralled watching him stroke his manhood against the covers, his eager desire obvious. Doffing the remainder of my clothing, I placed my hands on either side of his hips and pulled his buttocks to my face. I rubbed my beard over those peach fuzz cheeks, inhaling his animal scent with zeal.
The agitated detective accepted all of my offerings, ensuring that a decent amount of space stood between as sat on the settee with the rum-flavoured cheroot and tinkling glass in his hands. Taking my time, I lit my own cigar, watching his eyes dart about the room in every direction but of my undressed repose.
“Ah!” said another voice, saving me. “Mr. Williams!”
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, politics, and philosophy, he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the most naïve way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
Strangerson came up to Holmes, kissed him, and held Holmes’ heavy bullocks in his palm. He whispered something, to which Holmes nodded, and then dropped to his knees. Holmes’ enormity twitched before his face, a teardrop of precum glistening from its tip, and Strangerson seemed unable to believe both its dimensions nor the fact that he was encountering such an extravagance. Entranced, he placed the cockhead between his perfect lips. Holmes and the other men encouraged his actions, their own members straining in their pants.
From a pocket in his coat, Holmes produced a small flask containing oil. He rubbed some on Drebber’s hole, carefully inserting a digit. Drebber’s willingness at this point was evident. But Holmes seemed to want to tease the man just a bit more. He knelt down like an lion at a savannah watering-hole and began to play his tongue over Drebber’s pucker.
Clenching spasms wracked his physique as he fired a cannonade of cum. The vision of it shooting over his head, coupled with the sensation of his puckering hole, sent me over the ledge as well. With an almost lupine howl, I expelled my offering into Stamford’s twitching aperture. Drained, I collapsed down into his awaiting arms. Satiated men, we both fell promptly asleep.
“Since I was a young boy, I have felt the stirring in my loins when with close male companions. At first, I took the sensation as indication of my great love and friendship for them but at some point I realized that it meant more. I became distraught after this recognition, and filled with anger. Back at home in Chicago, I was a terror, picking fights with other boys in the street and letting loose great mischief upon the world. My parent eventually wished to be rid of me, and so I headed out west to seek my fortune.”
I turned to see that the couch I’d chosen was not as private as I first believed. An appealing man sat in the dark corner, his body half wreathed in shadow. His skin was cinnamon brown, his eyes dark as midnight, his lashes long and lovely. He appeared to be in his early twenties, though the top of his head was bare and smooth, and a finely-trimmed beard of wiry black hair plastered his cheeks. He was shirtless and I could see another tuft of coarse hair covering his pectoral muscles and nipples.
“I should like to meet him,” I said. Stamford fixed me with a serious gaze, as if to ask whether or not I intended to sleep with this Holmes character. “It’s not like that. If I am to lodge with anyone, I would prefer a man of quiet and studious habits. How can I meet this friend of yours?”
5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in marihuana, opium and other drugs. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
With this, he turned and faced us with his rear, crouching into a squat to render apart his butt cheeks. Though thus far Holmes’ enormous frontal appendage has been the focus of much narrative attention, his backside is also worth some careful consideration. Holmes’ muscled buttocks resembled smooth granite boulders, their vigor no doubt strengthened from many hours of outstanding thrusting. Each cheek had but the fairest amount of hair, yet remained among the most masculine of any anatomical structure I’d ever seen. Within his precipitous crack lay a delectable roseate pucker, which Holmes was now displaying proudly for his double audience.
4. Politics.—Feeble.
Seated at the breakfast table was Holmes, a silk robe draped over his sturdy shoulders as he sipped tea. Taking the other chair, I found that my flatmate was nude beneath his housecoat, which opened at the front to reveal his burly chest. His large limp organ was visible, slumped to one side in the cleft of his crotch. For some reason I suddenly regretted that I’d taken Gregson in the drawing room—it seemed to bring sexual matters to the forefront of our living arrangement. An uneasy prickle blossomed in my chest; the image of coming home to find Holmes driving his gargantuan instrument once again into a willing man here in our shared space. As to why my feelings fell in this direction, I cannot say.
I was in a state of great anxiety when the cheque arrived. Noticing that desire hung thickly around us, I asked him if there was a place we might go for more privacy. A passing waiter glanced awkwardly at me when I said this, though the alcohol made me insensible to his stare.
“Look at you, John,” he said. “You are a marvelous creation. I apologize that we were interrupted earlier.”
“What did I tell you?” said Holmes. “His cock is nearly—ahhh—nearly as big as mine.”
“It certainly has,” said Holmes, and then seemed to move on to another subject. “And your secretary—a certain Joseph Strangerson, do you currently know his whereabouts?”
At that moment, there was a violent peal at the bell. The sound of the door opening and a person dashing up the steps three at a time echoed throughout the room. In another life, I would have jumped from my reclining position and attempted to cover my iniquity but instead I remained in a reclining position on the couch, my bushy legs flaunting their socks and garters, the rounded bulge in my underpants scarcely hidden behind my resting right hand.
Once, Strangerson had been dragged away, his father turned to Hope. “You pervert,” he shouted at the convert, who had fallen into a despondent heap on the floor.
Hope could see that there was no use hiding the truth from his friend any longer. “It was not nature herself that stirred me, but rather the sight of other men, cavorting and playing with one another in the nude.”
“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection in this field as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”
There is no need for me to detail my measurements in the Queen’s Imperial. Suffice it to say that I had been with a fair number of men, and seen a wide variety of specimens in all lengths, sizes, and thicknesses—finding pleasure in each. But one thing that has been clear to me for a long time is that I am rather above average in this department. In fact, there have been only a few dicks that come within or exceeded the same range as my own.
“Indeed,” nodded Holmes. “But even more important was what Strangerson and Drebber had been seen doing at the club Rache—namely, arguing. The other patrons distinctly recall watching the two men have a heated row right there in the middle of the room, with Drebber unable to keep his temper under control at some news that Strangerson had given him. And we know from John Rance what this news item must have been: that Strangerson was re-enamored with his former lover, Jefferson Hope.”
“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away toward other channels.
“But why should that give you such agitations, my friend?”
Somehow, my limbs had become entwined with his, and my hand had come to rest upon his crotch. A growing hardness was evident beneath the cloth.
Holmes continued to laugh and talk as each of the men took turns caressing his slowly-engorging enormousness. He retained the casual air that had been in effect moments prior but the accipitrine gleam in his eye notified me that his mind had begun turning to other matters. The men in the circle marveled at his immense cock, which now began to rise like some magnificent contraption of considerable pleasure. Some of the dancing men had noticed the change in the sexual atmosphere and began kissing one another. Other groups in the shadows were engaged in their own foreplay, carefully stroking one another, slipping out of their clothes, beginning to nuzzle and neck. I even saw the proprietress Bess standing to one side, watching the events with rampant delight.
The whole thing occurred in a moment—I could barely process the scene. Holmes’ words and their import floundered in my mind.
At this moment, I saw Holmes turn and point to me. He said something to his small audience and then crooked his finger to call me over. I had been enjoying leaning back in my seat, rubbing my prodigious tool beneath my clothing while simultaneously circling my right nipple with my thumb. But seeing how the men all beckoned me as well, I decided to take them up on their entreaties.
In his hand he held the wooden handle of a long hose. This was connected to a water pipe, a device I recognized; the men in Afghanistan had called it a huqqa. The young Moor at my side stated that it contained hashish, though I was still reeling and didn’t fully pay attention to his words. Offhandedly thanking him, I took the hose and sucked in a long draw. The smoke was scented with rose and a lungful relaxed my beating heart.
The light of Holmes’ grin shone with an approving gleam. “I told you that my tricks were not so hard as they initially seem. A short time with me and you are already becoming quite the detective yourself.”
“In any case, I declare you married,” he said, beaming. “You may now kiss one another.”
“Oh, John,” he whispered, no doubt reminded of how much we had once enjoyed the pleasures of our entwined bodies.
“Ah, Dr. Watson,” he said. “To show you my latest creation.” He took a small atomizer and directed its spray to the spot on my coat. Within seconds, the fluid disappeared.
Holmes had whipped a tape measure from his pocket and was trotting noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally, kneeling, and once lying flat on his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, whistles, groans, and little cries of suggestive encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained fox-hound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope.
Holmes grinned mischievously. “Revenge,” he said. “What better way to take retribution on the man who treated you poorly for many years than by fucking another in his own bed?”
Holmes studied us all. “And it can refer to a type of Medieval hunting-dog, once commonly found here in Britain. Perhaps one of you has heard of a club with the same name, over by Cleveland Street?”
But Drebber did not appear to know what my companion was talking about. “I haven’t seen Strangerson in some time. He has nothing to do with this case.”
Gregson held himself starchily as I scratched at the fur just below my neck. “And do you always trust the judgments of Mr. Holmes above all others?”
I did not care just then to hear of other men’s lengths or girths. Deciding that Stamford’s risk in the cab could be met with my own, I pressed my knee against his under the table when I was sure nobody watched. “Perhaps your memory is faulty. I could gladly remind you of at least one previous priapic encounter. I believe at the time you referred to it as ‘beyond compare.’”
“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was the proliferation of footprints in mud all over the grounds. Patent leather and Square-toes walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room to the bed—or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes disappeared for a while—“ for the sake of our driver, Holmes did not spell out exactly what the two men were doing—“I could read all that in the dust; the appearance of a robbery was made after the fact in an attempt to hide these actions.”
“Are you telling me she relishes watching the couplings of men?”
Holmes met my eyes with a look that said, “Not a bad state of affairs, eh chum?” And I had to admit that if this was life with Sherlock Holmes, I would probably be willing to put up with a few strange rules. Drebber had now encapsulated a greater portion of my dick than most men could manage, his oral skills clearly among his greatest assets. That Holmes had managed to recognize this a priori was impressive to say the least. Relishing the warm wet feeling on my pole, I threw my head back in sublime gratification, slipping my hands beneath my shirt to caress my body and hardened nipples.
“If you like, I can keep such things confined to my bedroom,” he said. “Though I take it you had some enjoyment from watching us.”
“Is everything to your liking?” the man asked, taking a drag himself and smiling.
Yet nothing can last forever. A man accepting another man deep inside him, opening up his sanctum sanctorum, was among the methods that would most readily bring both to come. Enraptured by Saul’s implement, I marveled at the fact that not all men allowed themselves such pleasure; that we alone had figured this beautiful indulgence. I realized that sliding tower, glistening as it worked its exquisite occupation of my arsehole, sundering my body, was not something to be hidden in shadows, covert and clandestine. It was right and good to allow these acts their necessary place among the wonders of the human experience.
Eventually, I drifted back out into the club. Coming back to the couch, I found the aftermath of Holmes’ exhibition. Rance and the Moor were sprawled and sated, dreamy grins on their faces as they drifted off the sleep in each other’s arms. Some of the looky-loos around them had taken to coupling in the low light, and a faint background of grunts and moans could be heard all around. Holmes himself had nearly finished dressing, smartly fastening the clasps of his cufflinks as I approached.
As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height, he was rather over six feet and lean enough to appear taller. His eyes were penetrating and ever-watchful, save during those periods of torpor which I have earlier alluded to; and his hawk-like nose gave his whole expression and air of alertness and decision.
Across the room, through the curtain of smoke, I could see Holmes in outline. He was naked and his enormous curving implement stuck out pompously before him. He threw the side-burned Rance over the back of a couch and immediately sank his massive manhood all the way into Rance’s snug arsehole. Soft moans carried over to my ears. The darker-skinned man Holmes had stolen took a position beneath Rance, deftly swallowing his cock while rubbing his own circumcised member. Several nearby patrons began to touch themselves, watching the action attentively.
This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. As I previously mentioned, this area was new to me; though I noticed we were not far from our apartment on Baker Street. Holmes seemed intimately familiar with our surroundings, addressing our cabman on precisely where to pick us up in a few hours. The drive made a face as we disembarked; evidently he did not think this part of town decent.
Sherlock Holmes began a slow and steady stroke, his ridiculously large member shifting like the piston of a departing train. While thrusting into Drebber’s opening, he removed the remainder of his clothing. My eyes drank in the sight of his nude, brawny frame and the woolly hair on his chest. He leaned forward and undid Drebber’s coat and shirt, which had become sweat-stained from exertion, and then twisted his head beneath Drebber’s thick and muscular body to lick his engorged, pink areolae. Drebber responded with an elated cry as Holmes took Drebber’s cock in hand once again and began to pump it.
Shifting on the couch, I offered him a seat. “I’m anxious to hear how you managed it. Please, let’s light some cigars to indulge in as you tell me. Will you have some whiskey and water?”
“We came here on business,” he said, sitting down on a three legged stool, and pushing another one in the direction of my foot. “My friend here want to take diggings, and as you were just complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought I might bring you together.”
“But what do you think of the case, sir?” said Gregson, annoyed.
The cries of the foul birds awoke the sleeper who stared about him in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,” he muttered.
I smiled. “He seems to have a remarkable knack for exactitude. Elsewise you and Lestrade would not be consulting with him, eh?”
“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”
Hearing a cry, Hope opened his eyes with fright. He looked up but found nobody in the vicinity. Embarrassed beyond belief, Strangerson had immediately ducked beneath the surface and was now shimming away back toward the group, hoping he would never have to discuss the events that had just occurred with anybody.
All of this put me back in willing condition rather quickly, and soon I was up and about in the club again. I almost instantly spotted my next amusement—a row of men bent over a comfortable settee, each proudly displaying their eager outlets for anyone to take their satisfaction with. A few muscular trailblazers were currently pumping away at an arse or two but the majority of the buttocks seemed sadly unoccupied. Deciding to rectify this misfortune, I stroked my implement back to full hardness and set myself at the end of the line. I wanted my dick to savor each of these mouthwatering offerings and, after covering it with some proffered lubricant, sank my colossus into the first compartment.
“We have come about the robbery,” said Holmes.
“Do you suppose that is the man who came between him and Drebber?”
“To gather information,” he replied, locking eyes with a well-dressed man whose dick was currently being enveloped by a bearded mouth. “And perhaps a few other things.”
“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”
Here Hope stopped his narrative and looked up at his friend Strangerson, whose eyes were lit with a bright flame of candlelight. Though his heart beat fast in his chest, the convert felt utterly becalmed, as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He knew now that it did not matter what reaction he received, the telling of the tale had already been restorative to his constitution.
I shook my head. “Perhaps. Though the person who wrote it would be best to keep their mouth shut in public.”
Stamford swallowed, and I could see the lust burning in his eyes. But we had to be discreet. We continued our dinner as if the two of us were nothing more than close friends. Stamford, that terrible bastard, happened to order a plump pork sausage that aroused several competing emotions within me, principally jealousy. I took it upon myself to quaff several extra beers to cool the fire within me. Unfortunately, all it did was made me bolder.
At this moment, I sensed a wet tongue on my exposed arsehole. Looking back, I saw the cinnamon-skinned Moslem youth who had shared his huqqa with me yesterday. His long-lashed eyes and grizzled beard peeked up from between my cheeks and I winked at his instinctive consummation of my innermost desires. He continued his torrid exploration of my backdoor as I began to slip in and out of the astonishing aperture beneath me. To fuck while being analingually stimulated in such a manner was a nearly-overwhelming feeling and it took most of my willpower not to ejaculate on the spot.
Soon, a cloud of fine-scented smoke billowed about the two of us. The thin veil provided a touch of modesty to our scene and Gregson slowly began to unwind. The dark spirit in his glass also appeared to put him at ease, and he told me at length about his suppositions. The particulars seemed to be in something of the right direction, with Gregson correctly identifying Drebber and Strangerson as members of the American religious movement known as Mormonism. But he was under the impression that the robbery had been genuine, committed by a man named Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy.
Strangerson hugged his frame against Hope’s, wishing that by force he could almost merge the two of them together. He wanted to feel every inch of his friend’s physique against his own. The thrilling sensation of Hope’s body even through his clothing was already a greater joy than the young Mormon had heretofore experienced in his life. Hope’s lips against his as they pressed together their faces was a tangible reminder that such contact was among the greatest parts of human existence.
My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty. Desperately, I wished to speak to him more about what had transpired when I tried to kiss him during our time with Drebber. If nothing else, I wished to clarify our standing with one another. But I knew my questioning would be impudent—Holmes had articulated the rules and they seemed to be rather steadfast. Besides, it would not be practical to talk about such matters here in public.
Holmes eyed me. “And I was not expecting you for at least five more minutes,” he said. “But I assure you I will keep such things in my trousers for the time being so as not to upset your sensibilities.
Holmes raised an eyebrow at me. “No.”
“We are the persecuted children of God—the chosen of the Angel Merona,” replied the scout.
Holmes and I were led up a staircase to a bedroom, where the mysterious affair had occurred. In it stood a fretful man, about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad-shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, running to silver at the sides, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light coloured trousers, and immaculate colour and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon his head. He nodded curtly at Holmes and I as we walked in. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, stood by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.
“Was a good time had by all?” he asked, tipping his head playfully. I nodded, though did not wish to go into particulars. “Well, during my exertions I learned an interesting fact: Joseph Strangerson has been here recently.”
Shaking my head, I realized that I’d fallen into an abysmal state. Holmes had affected me more strongly than I cared to admit. Here I was in a veritable paradise; there was no sense sulking. Why venture home alone when men were readily available all around?
My head fell back in pleasure as Saul tugged at my foreskin. Sensations had become heightened due to the marihuana smoke. My cockhead was damp with precum. A whimper escaped my lips.
Strangerson glared at his companion, feeling that a new connection had grown between them. His buttocks were slick with sweat inside his pants and his erection had been straining against the fabric throughout Hope’s detailed description. He asked his friend what became of his relationship with Napayshni.
The woman who opened the door looked at my companion and smiled. “Ah, Mr. Hawthorne—it is always a pleasure to see you back here.”
“He now took some of the seminal fluid issuing from our instruments and smeared it on his fingers. With one hand, he pried apart my butt cheeks and rested his other hand upon my constricted pucker. The lubrication seemed to ease his ingress and this time I was able to relax the requisite amount for his digit to dive a short way into my antechamber. An electric thrill coursed through my hips, causing the rate of leaking from my engorged cockhead to increase considerably. Napayshni understood that I had achieved an important milestone, giggling and hugging me close to his chiseled physique. He instructed me to push my finger deeper inside him, which I did so rather easily. His compartment had after all been recently stretched by another man’s dick and this thought bountifully multiplied my passion.”
I passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. Why were these two men taking such a risk in a house that doesn’t belong to them? Why did they feel the need to hide their affair with this elaborate charade? If robbery was not the men’s intention, they why is the wife’s ring still missing? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.”
Holmes beamed. “Stick with me, Doctor, and I hope you will become entranced with the finest study I ever came across: a study in fornication. After all, there’s the thread of sex running through this colourless skein of life, and our duty is to follow its every inch, and see where it takes us. But now for delights, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”
Though guileless Gregson seemed to find this an easy enough request, the look on Lestrade’s face indicated that he didn’t entirely like where this situation was going. But he acquiesced and left myself, Drebber, and Holmes alone.
“I am hoping he will be my flat-mate,” he said, reaching out to shake my hand.
I spoke in a low and steady voice. “Come now, Gregson, have courage. Why did you so boisterously barge into the residence of two men such as Holmes and myself? Were you, perhaps, hoping to witness a scene similar to the earlier one at Dreber’s manor?”
My eyes met Holmes’, who gave a quick wink and addressed the woman like an old friend. “Hello, Bess. I trust business is well. I’ve brought a good friend to experience the wonders of your hall. This is Mr. Williams.”
I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.
Strangerson licked his lips, his spirit a whirl of conflicting emotions. “Please,” he said, “tell me what happened next.”
“Shall I go forward and see, father,” asked the young man who had spotted the glinting item.
On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. On the ledge of rock above this strange man there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comer uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.
“My eyes bulged at this surprise, though Napayshni seemed to have expected it. As he continued grinding our implements together, he twitched open and closed his rearmost aperture, allowing my finger to slip in and out. I realized that he was showing me with his body what to do with my own. Feeling the force of his hand on my sphincter, I tried to follow his lead, though it seemed easier to tighten rather than loosen the ring. Napayshni laughed and kissed me again, telling me it would take practice to master these motions.”
From afar, I watched as Hope, Strangerson, Holmes, and a small crowd of men laughed and touched one another. The particulars of their words were lost in the hullabaloo but it was clear that their conversation had turned to carnal matters. Many in the circle had thrown their arms around their companions’ shoulders. A few kept reaching for their crotches again and again. Finally, I saw Hope ask something of Holmes, to which my friend nodded. His belt was then unbuckled, his pants and underwear dropped to the floor, and the soft version of his gargantuan instrument tumbled out for all to see. Strangerson, I noticed, gasped at the sight.
The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, though I suffered a disaster during my time there. During the battle at Maiwand, I was struck in the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which luckily did not damage my body as badly as it could have. But as I lay there, injured, wondering if I were to fall into the hands of the murderous Ghazis, my orderly Murray picked me up and threw me upon his pack-horse. Murray and I of course were lovers, in the Spartan fashion, as were many of the men in my regiment. The officers turned a blind eye to these encounters, though some actively promoted and even participated in them, with the thought being that they helped bond soldiers together.
“Oh yes, indeed,” I answered. “From the time I was young.”
It seemed that no bigger prize—both figuratively and literally—could have pleased Drebber more. Leaving my growing erection aside, he shifted to face Holmes, pressing his face into that incredible creation. He seemed to drink deeply of Holmes’ dick, and immediately become inebriated. Rubbing his bearded cheeks over its unending length, he looked like a creature at play. Eventually, he leaned down to accept the enormous head into his mouth, an ecstatic shiver running through his entire body.
“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. “You won’t mind if I borrow some of this?”
Saul and I fell together into the downy softness of the bed, eventually landing in a position where he straddled me from above, our bodies pointed in opposite directions. Undoing the clasps on my trousers, he pulled them down to my ankles as he slid his chest over mine. He rubbed his face at the bulge in my underwear. Sniffing like a fox, he inhaled my aroma, as if no bouquet had ever been finer. His tongue slipped into my underpants just at the point where my legs met—that responsive patch behind my balls—and I squirmed, tugging uncontrollably at my beard and curls.
“I had much to do inside in the house,” the detective answered evasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.”
The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.
“Are you saying, Mr. Drebber, that you gave no interest in something like this?” Holmes said, retaining a comfortable grip around my shaft.
But Strangerson was resolute. Having listened to his friend’s back and forth regarding Napayshni, he felt that he could accommodate a short trial—the scandalous actions of men and the pleasure they could bring was all he could think about now. Hope was rather enflamed himself and did not take too long deliberating in his mind before deciding that feeling Strangerson’s sphincter slowly swallowing his stiffened tool would not be a bad sensation.
But Holmes had hidden his thoughts once again behind a secretive smirk. “Come, Watson, or I shall be late for Chopin.”
