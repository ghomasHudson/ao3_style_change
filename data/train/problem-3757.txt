His own room. Not a cardboard box under his sleeping bag, not a bunk bed in the homeless shelter, not a shared room with creepy strangers. A bed, a desk, a dresser, some shelves on the wall. Not that he has much to put in and on those. Not yet. But his window has a nice view on the park, the trees blocking out the shrubs behind which he used to sleep.
But he promised Dean. He needs to prove to his boyfriend that his diet isn't getting out of hand, that he can be normal for him, at least on a holiday. It reminds him of all the Novak family dinners when he was asked to stay quiet about his private life, or the holidays spent with his boyfriends' families.
"Don't let him fool you. He already called Nora and said he's back on Monday." Dean can hear the eye-roll in Castiel's voice.
Castiel shuffles into his room. The second bed is still empty and freshly made. It's weird to think about having shared the room with a suspected murderer. But even weirder is how lonely and sad this room feels now.
Dean beams at him. "Yes. During the summer festival, we have a free view on the stage from our balconyâ€”admission free!"
He takes a deep breath before he returns to the living space, where six pairs of eyes look at him expectantly.
He puts on his second pair of jeans, throws a somewhat clean hoodie over his threadbare shirt and strikes off to a cafÃ© on the other side of town that has a pay-what-you-can policy. He has a strict rule to go there twice a month at the utmost. But today, he wants to sit alone at a table and eat, just like normal people do, celebrating his first day back on a payroll.
Castiel sighs quietly. He wishes he wouldn't be so uneasy with his own body. But it's hard when it doesn't react as it should. He can't trust his body to do the right things because it doesn't when it counts, namely in matters of the heart.
Dean grins at Castiel apologetically. "My roomie. She's setting up a board game night. But we need an even number of players. Hey, have you ever played
Dean huffs a laugh and runs a hand over his face before he grabs the mug and blows over the hot beverage. "He lied to me. Several times."
Castiel blushes and shakes his head. 'Angel' sounds so nice off Dean's lips, and there is no mistaking that it's an endearment for someone you loâ€”care deeply about.
Dean furrows his brow but doesn't comment. It's just food. Everyone can read the termination time on the label and throw the expired stuff in the bin. He shrugs it off. Castiel is weird sometimes, but he looks happy about this, so why piss on the poor man's parade?
"You really wanna know?" Dean sounds equally parts thrilled and daunted. Castiel turns to face him. His boyfriend shuffles his feet, and a faint pink dusts his cheeks. "It's about your Christmas gift."
He feels Dean's worried eyes on him, and so he grabs a hot dog from the pile. If he eats it very slowly, no one will catch on, he's sure. He meets Dean's eyes as he takes the first bite. His boyfriend grins when Castiel's eyes widen at the delicious taste.
He sits up next to Dean and hooks his fingers under the waistband. He looks up at Dean with a questioning gaze. Green eyes stare at him for a long moment before Dean nods his consent and lifts his hips. His cock springs free, slightly erect. Castiel smiles shyly up at Dean.
Dean makes a dismissive gesture and opens a bottle of beer. "It'll get better eventually. I put on some weight, too, after I got my first proper job that actually paid the bills."
"You're kidding!" Dean laughs. Castiel loves that he never sounds as if he were laughing at him, although he probably does. "Are you working Friday night?"
"He promised to come over, warm up, and eat lunch with me every day till his birthday." Okay, 'with him' is a stretch. He means 'in my office'. But Charlie doesn't need to know that. He can fast without a squeezy conscience when he gives his food away. And dinner tastes so much better when he felt a little hungry before anyway.
Kevin smiles at him, his eyes lighting up for the very first time. 'He could be my kid,' Castiel thinks as he watches him eat.
Castiel takes a deep breath and pushes the door open. When he steps out of the lift, Dean is already leaning in his apartment door, a brilliant smile adorning his face. The sight makes Castiel giddy. He loves Dean's smile. He's seeing it so often during work when Dean deals with customers. But this one is different, and not only because it is directed solely at him. Dean looks well-rested. He's always handsome, but now, he looks radiant.
He lays the spoon down and dabs his mouth with a paper towel. Dean knits his brow together. "I didn't meanâ€”you can eat as much as you want, Cass."
"You lost enough weight, Cass. This is getting out of hand. It's Labour Day. That means the old tradition of hot dogs in the park, Sam's infamous taco salad, and Charlie's S'mores cupcakes. Oh, and don't forget the new tradition of a picnic cooler full of soda. I ain't gonna accept no for an answer. You can change your eating window for once. Live a little."
She slumps down onto the couch next to him. "It's just labour pains. You two never really had the rosy phase at the beginning of your relationship. You have to figure yourself out while getting to know each other. But you'll get there."
Charlie nods. "For what it's worth, I think you're right. He's overdoing it. Yesterday, I watched him staring at his phone for five minutes with a sandwich right in front of him. He only ate it when the alarm went off, even though his stomach was rumbling before. You know, people who are prone to addiction often show this trait in other, even healthier parts of their lives. Could it be that he replaced the alcohol with controlling his eating habits?"
Dean chuckles. "Nothing about my life is healthy, Cass. I'm living off ramen and apple pie." He pats on his small bump and laughs.
Dean nods, biting the inside of his lip. "Yeah. I mean, I learnt from the mistakes I made in our relationship."
"I only realised when she texted me birthday wishes at midnight and asked what she should bring today."
She shrugs. "I know nearly everyone in this room. And the only two men Sam ever mentioned were his brother and Bobby who I assume is the fella over there."
"No need. Hannah will bring my old one on Christmas. Gotta go now. Love you." Castiel presses a last kiss to Dean's lips and then hurries to catch his bus. Dean smiles after him.
Thank you so much to everyone who read this story. ðŸ’™ Its topics are close to my heart, and even though it might not be read by many, I'm still glad that I wrote it. ðŸ’š
Hannah is shuffling her feet, hands pushed into the pockets of her jeans. "When you were gone, whenever I was at a place I thought of you, one that I would have loved to show you, or where I saw something reminding me of you, I bought a postcard and wrote about it. Iâ€¦ It's probably stupid, and you don't have to read them, okay? I just wanted you to know that they exist, andâ€¦" She runs a hand over her neck.
Dean pulls out before Castiel emerges on the other side, his erection already flagging. He tries to get up to get a wet washcloth but Castiel paws on him. "Cuddles," he whines, and Dean chuckles as he falls back into bed and wraps himself around his sex-drunk lover.
The group chats for a while. Castiel tries to follow their conversations, but he doesn't know the people or events they are talking about, so he mainly enjoys the accidental touches between him and Dean.
He knows how awful this would sound if he spoke it out loud, but he really likes Castiel. He is funny and adorably weird. He's beautiful and incredibly kind. His kisses turn Dean's legs into jelly. He's so damn perfect, and even though Dean knows that there is inevitably heartache on the horizon, right now, he would spend a year in purgatory just to have him in his arms once.
Dean shivers at the tender touch and bites the inside of his cheek in a last attempt to keep back the tears welling up in his eyes.
His phone beeps, and he looks at Lisa's message, a video of Ben throwing a touchdown. He sends back a thumbs up. It doesn't hurt as much as it used to just a few weeks ago. But the morning shift is already taken, and he doubts that Judy will give it up. She has a bunch of teens at home to bring through puberty.
Dean huffs a laugh. "Well. Then we can be dumbasses together." He sits down next to Castiel. "I'm not good at this, man. I'm a shit boyfriend."
Dean cleans him up before he covers him with a blanket and goes to work in the kitchen. A well-infused pasta salad is better than a fresh one anyway.
"Drop it, kiddo," Dean groans. "I'm just sick. Just let me sleep, and I'm back to normal in no time."
"I haven't thrown it away!" Castiel says with utter conviction, his flickering eyes betraying the seriousness of his voice.
He pulls his hand from the right side, where the beer is, to the left with the sodas. He's sweating because it's hot outside, and his hands are trembling because he's dead tired after six night shifts. He just needs a cool shower and probably ten hours of sleep, and he'll be fine.
He has no idea how he is supposed to handle this. It's the first time he attempts a relationship with a man that goes beyond a one-night stand. He just hopes that Castiel likes to top. It would make things so much easier. Maybe, this new relationship isn't doomed right from the start like the one with Lisa had been.
Castiel's heart is racing against his ribs. He knows that he'll have to address his past earlier or later. 'Band-aid off,' he decides.
But he was wrong. Dean knows it wasn't anybody's fault. Both of them tried to do the right thing. Even Castiel as he watched him raking the leaves and decided to let him go. Out of love, even though Castiel didn't have the word for this emotion back then.
Castiel watches after Dean, who walks into their kitchen. He quickly checks his watch, then hastens after him.
"That's Hannah," Castiel explains, blushing, before he pushes the passenger door open and gets out of the car just when his sister arrives and pulls him into a tight hug.
After the whole moving in together after dancing around each other for more than a decade, Dean just loves spending his spare time next to his boyfriend on the sofa and binge-watching all the shows he missed in the past and everything new he can get his fingers on. Blessed be the inventors of online video platforms. Dean has a subscription to all of them.
Dean frowns and opens his mouth but thinks better of it. "Good night, Cass. Enjoy your night off. See ya tomorrow."
Rowena raises a single eyebrow and quirks her mouth into a warm smile. "A gentleman. We don't come across those often enough." Three men start protesting immediately. The Scot laughs. "Those who feel addressed should reflect on why they do so," Rowena retorts with a wide grin and greets everyone with a stout-hearted hug.
Morning comes way too early. Dean grumbles something unintelligible as he tries to swipe away the alarm for the third time.
Castiel lets go of him and folds his arms over his chest. "I thought the marzipan was for me," he says in faux affront.
Dean's head falls on Castiel's shoulder. He holds him there, no words needed. It's been an exhausting week for both of them.
Dean wouldn't understand his fear. He's a gut person. He reacts emotionally, impulsively, eats whatever he wants to without care. Castiel, on the other hand, lets himself be guided by logic. And yes, he knows
"Since always. It was my greatest joy, the best way to relax. I just don't have a garden to tend to anymore." Castiel smiles to himself. Dean loves this face. He doesn't see it often enough. "The system would have worked if I wouldn't have made a mistake with the conversion from the metric system. I did it in my last garden and it was perfect."
Dean opens his mouth but he is too shocked to react. Castiel steps closer, and after a moment of hesitation, he leans in and presses a kiss to Dean's temple ever so softly. Dean feels like crying. He doesn't think he deserves this display of affection after what he said.
Still. What if the kind of attraction Dean feels for him is connected to his looks? What if his intervention earlier is not born out of health concerns, but aesthetic reasons? He can't lose Dean because of a petty matter like this.
"There's nothing to talk about, man. All that crap you told me when I got sober, about being open and letting other people in? You can shove it up your ass."
Castiel nods and smiles at him. This one isn't forced. He can't wait to be with Dean in chartered waters again.
Charlie shakes her red waves. "We've postponed it to after the wedding. That will be enough pressure for you."
Too much has happened in the last 48 hours, and he's still trying to catch up, despite the heaviness of his eyelids and the weariness of his muscles.
"People who can relate to some aspects of being asexual, but not to others. Some only experience sexual attraction very infrequently. Some people are demi and can only develop sexual attraction if they have a bond with someone. Being ace is very individual. The grey spectrum is wide. And all of it is perfectly normal."
"Yeah. He'll break up with me. Just because it might be a valid orientation, doesn't mean that he'll put up with my shit."
Yes, they did. Still, it doesn't make Dean any less angry at his body. Stupid dick! He wishes he'd been born without one. It's a useless tool attached to his body, always getting him in trouble, one way or another. He's so horny as of late, but he can't come with his boyfriend in the same room. How fucked up is that!?
Dean blinks at him several times. What the hell is he talking about? Is this how Castiel feels whenever he drops a pop culture reference? They stare at each other for a long moment.
Dean smiles softly and pulls him into a hug. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me." He presses a kiss to Castiel's neck, and his boyfriend tilts his head to give him more room to press a trail down from behind his ear to the neckline of his shirt. "You smell like my bodywash," Dean breathes, and the words tickle deliciously on Castiel's skin.
Dean interrupts him with a kiss. He hopes it says what his mouth can't form words for. He puts all his love in it, all longings that only Castiel can sate, all his wishes for a future together.
Castiel turns and leaves the flat, the front door slamming closed behind him. Dean stares at the empty hallway for a long moment, then curses like a sailor. Who does Castiel think he is? Didn't he tell him he wouldn't want to change a thing about him? That he loved his soft belly, and the way Dean enjoys the food he cooks for him?
"Yes. First time that both of us were single." He puts a burger on her bun and hands her plate over.
"At my age?" Dean snorts. "And for what? I just started a good job with proper everything. I won't risk that."
Dean watches in awe how his boyfriend starts glowing as he talks. Castiel is always beautiful but like this? He's radiant.
Dean chuckles. "Picking you up. It's past six." Castiel's lips fall into a silent 'o'. "Ready to go?"
Yes, he doesn't know Rowena, but Sam does. Well enough to want to marry her. Sam, who thought he was too toxic for a real relationship. Dean always told him that this was bullshit. And now that his little brother is finally listening, Dean acts like a jaundiced ex?
Of course, Dean sees it as easy as that. Maybe Castiel isn't hiding him from his family, but the other way around. Maybe Dean will understand how deeply he has fallen when he sees Hannah's house, her perfect family, the BMW in her driveway. Maybe Dean will ask him why he chose to live on the street instead of moving into his sister's guest room that is bigger than his new one, and much more luxurious for sure, with an en-suite bathroom, a walk-in rainfall shower, and all that jazz.
"Looking good, Mr Supervisor," Dean says, his smirk only slightly teasing. Castiel raises his eyebrowâ€”a sure way to make Dean lick his lips. Castiel grins triumphantly as he succeeds.
However, Dean doesn't allow himself to let go like this often. He has a reputation to uphold, after all. That's why he only drops by if he has two days off in a row, and he gets some good night's sleep for once. Otherwise, he would fall asleep, drooling on some rosebud tea or something.
"How have I never seen the signs? I mean, I was worried about his beer consumption but this?" She shakes her head, tears filling her eyes.
She shakes her head. "I'm happy you're alive. I'm happy you're having a good job and a good man. I'm so proud of you. For so long, I was worried every time an unknown caller ID popped up on my phone. Every time, I expected someone to tell me that you were found dead." She sniffs. "I don't want to imagine a world where Castiel Novak no longer exists."
Dean sets the alarm on his phone in case he dozes off and gives his eyes some rest. There is no use in mourning after the what-could-have-beens. He brought it all on himself. He and his stupid dick.
Castiel hums. "I was in a postcard club, too, with members from all over the world. My collection filled two walls of my bedroom. I used to have pen friends. I always loved learning about their culture. I travelled a lot in the past. What I'd give to go to Venice again, or Tokyo. I miss the Scottish Highlands."
Is their nearly-fight unsettling him so much? Or the excitement that he'll get Baby on the road for the first time in years? Both explanations don't sound plausible. He's simply antsy. The thrill of anticipation feels different. And he doesn't really worry about their little quarrel. It wasn't that bad, and Castiel kissed him before he left.
"No, it's not!" Dean all but shouts and pushes Castiel off him. He fishes for his pyjama bottoms and puts them on.
are," Castiel corrects. Michael rolls his eyes. "Don't think your job is more secure just because you worked longer here, Michael. The kid deserves to be addressed with their right pronouns."
The joke falls on deaf ears as Castiel simply nods along. Dean raises his eyebrows momentarily, then moves on. "If you're good at working in this department, I'll show you how to take inventory. That's our job as it's less traffic in the early hours. Any questions so far?"
'Good,' Castiel thinks and lets his fingers travel under the hem of Dean's shirt. That's not new. Both like touching each other. New is that Castiel's fingers don't move upwards but down under the waistband of Dean's pyjama bottoms.
"No!" Dean answers. It's not that Castiel expected him to be happy to meet his stuck-up family, but the sheer force of this single word throws him off big time. Not even a moment of consideration. Castiel had hoped that he would be worth more than a two-letter answer.
"Oh, that tight ass would've been mine, sha." Benny smirks. Even after all these years, Dean isn't sure if his mate likes men too or is just confident enough in his sexuality to joke like that.
Castiel's lips curl into a smile. "I told them he had to deal with a private matter, and his start day is in six weeks anyway. Until then he'll be back on his feet again. You'll see."
Dean passes her a cold beer and slumps down next to her on the sofa. He runs a hand over his face. She is right. He knows that. Ifâ€”no,
Castiel leans his forehead against his. "I love you, Dean. This doesn't change anything. At best, it will make me a better partner for you and a good ally for the ace community."
Dean hums and takes a sip from his coke and watches Castiel taking a bite from his burger, his eyes rolling back as he moans around the food. Dean shakes his head and chuckles. He's happy that his boyfriend enjoys their dinner.
Dean wakes up with the hangover of the century. He's gonna die for sure. But his angel left painkillers and water on his bedside table. And a note. Dean needs a moment to make his brain work to be able to read it.
Castiel leans back. "If I didn't know better, I'd think you're missing me when you're off work, Dean."
Castiel catches it just like the small Grogu all this time ago. "That's correct. And what a manly cuddler you are." He grins mischievously.
Dean nods and pushes his chin forward but swallows his tongue. It was just a silly note. He probably forgot about it already.
Castiel nods. "It's wide open for the holidays," he replies. He saves the nervous swallow until Hannah and Dean have turned to the trunk to get out their luggage. These are going to be long torturous two days.
He takes the mini Yoda and throws it over to Castiel, who catches it and looks at the little thing so fondly that Dean is tempted to take his words back.
Dean cautiously kicks the door to his bedroom open and enjoys the view welcoming him. Castiel looks so soft in his sleep, the ever-existing frown on his forehead relaxed, his nose pressed into Dean's cushion, probably searching for his scent. The sight makes Dean's heart ache in the best ways. God, he had forgotten how beautiful and precious these little moments are.
Dean pants for breath. "Youâ€¦ How can you think that this is how a relationship works? I can't just use you! That I'm your boyfriend doesn't give me a right to your body. Jesus!"
Castiel spreads the food on Dean's dinner table, taking in the missing photographs on the wall and the half-empty DVD and CD shelves. His heart aches. Dean must feel empty, too. He loved Lisa, Castiel knows that. And Ben, her son.
Castiel licks his dry lips. "Tea is great. Coffee gives me heartburn." He takes the offered mug and smells the fresh scent of peppermint and lemon. "Never thought you to be someone having tea in the cupboard."
This time when he exits their en-suit, he finds Castiel sitting on the side of their bed, staring at the new shelves. He turns his head slowly, a bright smile adorning his face.
"How much did you drink this time?" he murmurs. He has seen Dean drunk three times by now, but usually, his boyfriend is just a big, tired teddy bear. Castiel tries to get Dean off to his bedroom. He's just glad that Charlie isn't home. Dean would die of embarrassment if he knew that his best friend found him naked on the tiles.
"And that you didn't ask him has nothing to do with the wee angel that ye can't stop gushing over?" Rowena asks, a teasing smirk wide on display. Yes, punching someone in the face would feel very satisfying right now.
Castiel nods, drifting off into his own head. He probably regrets telling Dean this, but his boyfriend has none of it.
No. He's absolutely not considering it. He built a new life here, left the past behind. As much as he loves his surrogate father Bobby, this isn't an option. But it's a way better topic than the man he couldn't take his eyes off the whole evening, whose warm presence next to him made him all giddy inside, and who he didn't want to let go when they hugged goodbye.
Dean curses himself. He never thought about Castiel's side of the equation. He was way too happy to have such a loving, caring man on his side. Castiel already put so much effort into the relationship, high time for Dean to do the same.
"B," Dean had said, flashing him his most winsome smile. He had never said it out loud before that moment. Why define who you are if you only share a bed for one night?
But then he was there, so real and so close, and asked him how he was. He could hardly explain that the man he had shared a room with for the past month was arrested for murder in the middle of the night, and that he still can't enter his own room because the police sealed it.
"Tea would be great." Kevin looks at the sparsely decorated room. His eyes fall on the photo frame. "Your boyfriend?"
Dean glances at him, heart in his mouth. He spoke his truth freely for the very first time. It should be invigorating, but all it did was punch the air out of his lungs.
"He's a quick learner," Dean states, looking over to where Castiel is bent forward, stocking the shelves with nut bags.
Castiel opens his mouth but the words don't come. How could he explain how freeing not eating is? How much control it gives him in a phase of his life where pretty much everything is unsettling and new.
Dean wants to correct him but decides to leave it be. It's better when his buddy thinks he and Castiel went all the way. He hits Benny's butt with a tea towel and grins at him. "Donâ€™t be jealous, only because I never cared to fuck you when you were still working at the Gas-N-Sip."
Sam had been surprised when he and Castiel got together. Eileen much less so. Maybe because she had known it all along, kindred souls and all that crap.
"We're just happy that you're back on the horse," Sam shouts, and Dean tries to ignore the suggestive comments carrying loudly into the kitchen. It's moments like theseâ€”and when he deep-fries foodâ€”that he really hates the open-plan space of the apartment. There is only so much time you can hide from your friends behind the fridge door.
Castiel frowns. Even he knows that this was weird, but his analytical mind is interrupted by everyone getting up and moving to the dining table where the game is already set up.
Dean opens the box that holds the few things he still might call his own forever. Like the picture of him and his mum before she died. Well, the first time when he was a kid. There are bits and bobs, knick-knacks picked up on the road, too. A tiny drawing that a little girl made for him after he saved her and her parents on a solo hunt. It's yellowed and crinkled. He smiles at it. That had been one of the good days.
Dean nods and takes the jar from his hand. "Thanks," he says. He already counts the hours until they can leave this godforsaken place.
Castiel is putty under his ministrations, and it doesn't take long after Dean pushes inside him that Castiel comes with Dean's hand on his cock and his name on his beautiful lips.
"Yeah. A little too much," Dean says, blushing fiercely as Castiel presses in and feels his arousal.
He should be filled with butterflies, be giddy and a hopeless sap about the blue-eyed man next to him. But that's not in his cards. Not until he figures out how to handle this.
"You'll be here in California, and I'll be back in Kansas. We'll be lucky if we see each other on Christmas."
After April, when Castiel realised that he was gay, he had renewed hope that his sexual disinterest would change, that
It happens, now and then. It worked for several months with Lisa and Cassie. Not every time, but often enough to act as if he were a normal man with a normal libido and a normal sex drive.
Castiel swallows hard and straightens himself. "The Gas-N-Sip is an important retail point for locals and transients alike. We offer gas, but also groceries, information and entertainment material. It's the largest company of its kind in the whole United States, market-leading. I just got promoted to manager. I will have about a dozen employees under my leadership and will be solely responsible for centralised purchasing and such."
Dean's eyes shoot up. That's the man? The man, who he built up as the bogeyman who would get familiar with his fist? A fucking baby in a trenchcoat?
"Dean, the bodily withdrawal is only the first step of the journey. You need to face your illness. Otherwise, you will relapse," Sam states, his voice bordering on a plea.
"Wow! Congratulations. You made it." Kevin looks down at himself, the pullover he sports not much help against the cold.
Dean's tears are falling freely now. Castiel will leave. He will see how pathetic Dean is and go. Dean will have to find a new job. But that's the smallest of his problems.
He stares at her for a long moment. "Oh, because of Dean? Don't worry. He always talks very highly of you."
"So, what made you sink to the level of us mundanes?" Stevie asks after he shared that he was on the shortlist of becoming the manager of the last bank he worked at.
Dean purses his lips. She's his best friend. He should be able to talk with her about shit like this. He has carried this secret so long with him. It would be nice to share the burden for once.
Dean feels underdressed the second he enters the room. Castiel clutches his hand so tightly that Dean is convinced that there will be lasting crescents pressed into the flesh. He puts on his most winsome smile anyway. There's never a second chance for a first impression.
But Castiel just gives him that flat expression that is enough to put Dean on edge. Is it displeasure? Annoyance? Or simply his version of an eye-roll?
"Most of them are kind people," Sam says carefully. "And after tomorrow, Rowena is your family, too."
He walks closer and hovers a few steps away until Castiel raises his gaze. "Sorry. I was an ass," Dean says.
As it turns out, the ticking time bomb doesn't come down during the night. Dean finds them spread on the floor after getting out of the shower. He curses as he trips over one lying in the way. It's one that doesn't deserve the name plushie. It's hard! Those stupid things! He should stuff them into a rubbish bag and throw them out. But he doesn't have the heart to do it. Dean may be hung up on old gender roles now and then, but he isn't a complete asshole.
His resolve crumbles, but he forces himself to chew every bite as long as he can. The helping of the taco salad is so big, and Charlie's muffins are the large-sized ones. Castiel makes a rough estimate of the calories. This is much more than he usually eats. And Dean only bought the full-sugar soda.
The shop is empty save the two of them now, and Dean allows himself to steal glances of Castiel while he cleans up the mess that Jenny left behind, because Garth had to head out early.
Maybe it's the antidepressants he's taking. They can raise the libido, the patient information leaflet said. Was he simply lacking some messenger substance in his brain to be allo? Do all ace people? Is it an illness, after all?
"I'm not sure if I agree. It always felt like something else I couldn't control. And my partners always thought I was aroused by them, even though it just may have been too tight jeans or something." Castiel breathes a sigh. "I had a boyfriend whom I tried to explain to that I don't enjoy sex the way he does, and he used my erections against me. I hated that my body betrayed me."
They fall silent for a long moment until Dean nods. "You're right. I justâ€” He was my hero for such a long time. What sense does it make to rock the boat, now that he's gone."
"I was sick at the time. As you might see in my personnel file, I haven't missed a single day of work since I started at the Gas-N-Sip." Castiel sounds way calmer than he feels, but a good facade is half the battle. "I am fully recovered now, have a secure housing situation and relationship. I am a very different person compared to that time in my life."
He doesn't know how long he's been in the stall, trying to get himself off, when somebody enters the room. Not just anybody.
Dean works his jaw. It's a bit difficult to look at Sam, now that he realised that he's never given his fiancÃ©e a real chance.
Dean flushes red. "I didn't want to assume that you wanna share a bed, now that you finally have your own space again."
He knows it's stupid and futile. But for the first time since he left Lisa, his get-off-to-sleep ritual of stroking himself until he is relaxed enough to slide into dreamland actually ends in getting off to the imagined visuals of blue eyes, the most beautiful smile on chapped lips, and the sound of a softly moaned 'Dean'. The next morning, he won't be able to feel bad about it. He had all but forgotten how fucking great an orgasm could be. If he were able to get one with a partner, how awesome would
Of course, he would have loved to work in the field he had trained for, or at least have a day job, but he isn't in a position to be picky. No bank wanted to give him a chance. And at the end of the day, he's willing to do pretty much anything. Anything but what he did before he quit drinking, of course.
These damn green eyes! Castiel doesn't understand it himself, but something about Dean makes him want to do stupid things. Him! A person who doesn't even know where to sit in a group of people he barely knows without breaking some unspoken rules. Not sober, at least.
"Dean, you should drink a huge glass of water and go to sleep. I'll bring you a hangover breakfast and we'll talk. Okay?"
Castiel quirks an eyebrow. "It tastes better and now that I can, I want to watch what I put into my system."
Dean shakes his head. "The way I should've loved Lisa, but couldn't, becauseâ€¦" He gestures in Castiel's direction.
Because that's what Dean is for him first and foremost. Love. Strong and burning, gentle and caring. Castiel adores the softness of Dean's stomach as much as the strength of his arms, the fierceness of his kisses just like the reverent brushing of his fingertips. But he keeps these thoughts to himself, knowing they'd be too much for Dean to hear. His boyfriend can process his deeds much better than his words, and that's okay. They'll get there eventually.
"The best. But don't tell Sammy. I love it when he teases me. And I won't give up burgers, in case you thought that."
Dean is hot, but thankfully not running a fever yet. Castiel looks at the empty water bottles next to Dean's bed. He can't have drunk that much since Castiel left, can he?
His boyfriend chuckles and pulls back. "You're the best thing that ever happened to me, Dean. No money could balance out the joy you brought into my life."
"I have no idea whatcha talking about," Dean says, collects the empty bottles from the coffee table, and carries them to the kitchen. He's well aware that his cheeks burn like fire for everyone to see.
Dean stares at him, the line between his brows deeply creased. He shakes his head. "I seem like good luck to you? Trust me, you don't wanna be with me. Ask Lisa." He waves over to the Gas-N-Sip.
He ignores the two and checks the till money. Garth is rather pedantic, but his shift partner Jenny is a bit weird. Probably due to her family dying in a fire. Dean can relate. Everyone reacts differently to trauma like this. He wants to help other people because of his; she is rather cold to protect her heart from more losses.
The whole day, Castiel had looked forward to seeing Dean again. Dean, who makes him feel seen and accepted like no one ever did. Not even Hannah or any of his exes.
Dean shakes his head. "No, we're going to be fine. But the therapist got some stones rolling, and there is so much shit that Cass doesn't know about me. I had to sort through it on my own."
Dean shakes his grip off.  "Look me in the eye and tell me that you've eaten the sandwiches." Castiel shrinks into himself, the regret in his eyes saying it all. "Sonovabitch," Dean presses out.
"You could never be a bother." Dean doesn't hear the reply. He's hung up for real, leaving Castiel looking at the barely illuminated ceiling until dawn dips his bedroom into light.
"In my experience," she interrupts him softly, "secrets poison a relationship. I ain't gonna tell ya what to do. But there ain't nothing to be ashamed of, honey. You are so strong and went through so many things."
This wasn't what he had planned. Before he had the ace talk with Charlie, he wanted to let Castiel fuck him. It's always easier to fake an orgasm that way, at least doggy style. But now it's too late for that.
Dean. His best friend since college. Castiel was his best man at his impromptu wedding. Dean is the love of his life. But Dean doesn't know. Can't know. And that's fine. There is no place Castiel would rather be than at Dean's side. It's enough for him to see his best friend happy, thriving.
"Dean." Castiel grabs his arm, pulling on it in desperation. "I really haven't thrown them away. I swear on everything that's holy to me."
"I haven't touched a single drop of alcohol for months, and since my last rehab, I haven't felt the urge. I drank to forget, to numb my feelings. I don't need that anymore." Something gnaws in the rear of his mind at his own words but Castiel ignores it. He knows he isn't lying.
The whole thing gives him a headache without a boner stealing much-needed blood from his spiralling brain.
"Because I mean it." The tone of Dean's voice is so confident that Castiel wants to believe him. It's hard, though, knowing the darkness that lives inside his soul, bound to spill at any time. Castiel didn't lie back when they talked after their first kiss. Bad luck follows him everywhere he goes. Why should it be any different now? He'll manage to mess this up somehow.
Castiel laughs wetly. "But if he breaks up with me, we won't see each other again. I know my place, Charlie. I've been there before. The last time ended in a two-year-long bender."
Dean did everything in his power to get him so far and he can't bring himself to regret it. But he's still angry. Maybe he is anger, plain and simple. He's been angry since his mother died and his father gave a shit about giving his sons a home. This anger will probably never go away. It's good that Sam found happiness, Dean muses. At least one of them should.
He grabs his phone. Several missed calls and a ton of text messages await him. His eyes grow wider and wider as he scrolls through them.
He squints at the screen when he finally gets hold of his phone with clumsy fingers and picks up swiftly when he sees who it is.
Charlie gets up from the sofa, steps into Dean's way, and cups his shoulders, holding him in place. "There are couples that make it work. Some find ways to meet in the middle, some cut sex out of their lives, others have open relationships."
She scans him again, and Castiel can't help but squirm under her intense gaze. She sits down on what used to be Cain's bed, and Castiel sinks on his own. He fidgets with the bedframe, unsure what this unannounced visit might mean for him.
That might be because he doesn't know the whole story, of course, just snippets and outcomes, but not the reasons behind them, or the missing pieces that would give him a full picture. And frankly, Castiel is way too afraid to let Dean see those. So he pushes them down and covers them with work, secretly shed tears, and lots of food, until all he can feel is nausea. It's a physical sensation that could pass as an emotion in Castiel's book, and it is glorious and terrible at the same time.
She nods in understanding. Dean gets the impression that she knows to read her brother rather well. "He was always very disciplined. I guess it's how we were raised. And his otherness only pushed him to try harder. But I'm happy to see glimpses of who he used to be." She studies Dean's face for a long moment. "I won't give you the shovel talk. Just promise me to treat him well. He deserves a good man at his side."
Castiel takes Dean's hand and presses a soft kiss on his lips. "I don't think I can sleep without you, Dean. But maybe we could use my bed today?"
"Could you just leave it be? He's my colleague, not a serial killer." What made him think that these are his best friends if they are teaming up against him like this?
Sam chuckles, but it sounds strained. "Yeah. Umâ€¦ I simply used the same header as last year. It's always the same people anyway. But I forgotâ€¦"
Dean laughs just as humourless. "Sounds like we're a match made in heaven," he murmurs and shuffles his feet.
Dean pulls him into a long hug. They both linger, not ready to let go. Later, Castiel can still feel where their bodies touched when he's lying in his bed, bright awake, and not only because Cain is snoring like a bear.
"So that they can judge your sexual prowess from two sides?" Castiel asks, amusement forged into his features and laced around every word.
Dean chuckles. "Good for her. That scumbag didn't deserve her." He eyes his new colleague as he walks closer and offers his hand. "Name's Dean. And you are?"
Dean looks at the little Yoda sitting on the TV bench, replacing the emptiness that used to be there in all its soft-looking glory. "Plushies are for kids and women," he states.
The friends discuss the pros and cons of moving for work and suggest alternate jobs in the area. It's actually pretty helpful, but Dean is only half-listening.
It's still hard to believe that this man wants to be his, saw his very soul and fell in love with it. Dean still struggles, but he's tired of running away from himself, from love in the fear of losing it. Castiel is his best friend and the third love of his life. Hopefully the last.
"Um, no. There'sâ€”an inspection. I can only get back in tonight." Castiel furrows his brow. If he just had his sleeping bag. Then he could hide behind the bushes in the park.
Dean cards a hand through his hair. "I fell in love with the man you are now, Cass. I don't care where you're coming from. It'sâ€”a lot. I mean, I grew up in shitty motels and on the backseat of the Impala. But you're not judging me for that, are you?"
The bed is empty next to him. How one can be an early bird, Dean will never understand. But he sure as hell won't complain if it means that the man of his deams brings him fresh coffee to bed.
"I know. They didn't even know if I was still alive back then. Every last cent on my bank account was distrained, so I didn't use my cards anymore. I inflicted a lot of pain on my family." He gets up from the bench. "I'm sorry that I shouted at you. I know you just worry about me. I'll eat at the picnic tomorrow. I'll start the fast earlier to make up for it."
"And I didn't come despite all your efforts," Dean chuckles self-deprecatingly. Right now, he would love to have these lips wrapped around his cock. But he mustn't give in. Castiel isn't a sex toy.
Castiel chuckles and cups the back of his head. "You never do. But I want to know what you need from me the next time it happens. Or when you rut against me at night."
Charlie lays her hand on his shoulder. "I like him. I can imagine him living with us. If you're sure that you and he can make it work, whichever way this goes..."
Castiel smiles at him a bit forced. During the seasonal festivals, the cops are rather hard on those who sleep behind the shrubs. He's lucky not to be one of them anymore. He'll do everything in his power to never go back.
"You look tired, love." The endearment slips out of his mouth of its own accord and Castiel's eyes grow wide, searching for Dean's reaction. But there is none. Just a subtle twitch of his lips, and Dean leaning forward to bring their foreheads together.
Castiel loves it when Dean rolls or pushes up his sleeves. There is something exhilarating about seeing this part of him exposed while the rest is well-hidden under clothes.
"Are you sure? Because it feels like we're drifting apart instead of getting closer." Silence spreads between them for a while until Dean sighs. "I've been sitting here for the last hour, ready to pick up something at a 24/7."
Jo chuckles and shakes her head. Then she stretches out her hand. "Hi, I'm Jo. My mother owns the Roadhouse. Dean and I have been friends since he and Sam moved here."
It's calm in the petrol station so close to midnight, and Dean flashes a toothy grin at Garth, his colleague from the evening shift, as he walks straight to the staff room to get changed. He hates that ridiculous blue vest, but they are allowed to wear anything beneath it, as long as it looks decent. Dean shrugs out of his flannel shirt and takes a sip from his flask. He pops in a piece of chewing gum and returns a minute later to the front.
Castiel nods and pushes his lunch box in front of Kevin. "When did you eat last?" Kevin shrugs. "Where do you sleep?"
"You're in withdrawal, but warm turkey, if you will. Your body goes through the symptoms, but softened by medication," Sam explains.
There had been a time when Castiel was absolutely oblivious to such signsâ€”until Gabriel gave him the flirting 101 because he couldn't believe that his little brother never brought someone home or got frisky behind the school gym. Part of it was Castiel not even realising that he was being hit on. But frankly, he was simply not interested. Not like the other kids in class.
Dean blinks himself out of his trance. How long was he zoned out?. "Yeah, justâ€”I never really made it out of the States. Who knows, maybe you'll show me the world one day." He gives Castiel a smirk. They both know that their income doesn't give room for much more than a camping trip, and Dean isn't sure if that's appealing to someone who used to live in the street.
"I fucking love you, man, and Lis knows. She's known for months and now she's gone. Taken Ben, and left me the house. She doesn't want anything. A whole year, and she leaves because I can't stop loving you."
Castiel pats him on his back, the movement feeling weird, so he stops. "Left something in the staff room for you. Tell me if you still agree, tomorrow."
"I was going through a rough time," he starts. Dean and Charlie prepared him for this part of the interview. None of them had thought to include Naomi in the role play, though.
His way to look at men is one of the things that separates Castiel from other people. Nudes or skimpily dressed guys don't do much for him. He can enjoy the aesthetics of the human body, no matter the gender. But if it comes to finding a man attractive, he prefers him well-dressed, well-groomed, a bit of skin exposed, but not too much.
Charlie looks at him with sad Bambi eyes. He hates it. She knows exactly what they are doing to him. "You'll see," he says, grabs his phone and keys, and storms out of the apartment.
He presses the palms of his hands against his eyes, hoping to force back the sting of tears building up in them. A warm hand lands on his shoulder, startling him. "You've done well."
Dean stares into blue eyes for a long moment, then cards his hands through Castiel's hair and shakes his head. "You're perfect."
"I missed you, too. Can I hold you until dinner? Need to consecrate the bedding." Dean grins from ear to ear.
"Oh, I doubt that they will meet us before tomorrow. My parents are usually in bed at 9.30. Unless the Queen of Sheba arrives." He breathes out slowly and looks back at Dean. "Thank you for coming with me. I have no words to express how much this means to me."
Dean deflates. "He called it his, so chances are high we have to carry my old desk down again soon. Or I leave it with him. It's never been my style."
As soon as Castiel sinks down on him, Dean closes his eyes. He knows that watching someone pleasuring him is a sure way to lose his erection.
Dean's cheeks dust a beautiful pink. "It's from Sammy's shop. The blend is actually named after me."
After a long moment of staring, he sets the tray on his desk and sits down at the edge of the bed. He brushes the hair out of Castiel's face. His boyfriend's eyes shoot open at the touch, a hint of panic dulling their blue. It takes the sleep-muddled man a moment to morph his face into a smile.
Dean presses his face into a pillow and groans. Castiel snuggles closer so that Dean can hide his crimson cheeks on his shoulder. "You looked as if you were enjoying yourself, love. Don't be ashamed."
Castiel shakes his head. "You're feeling 'good' because you don't feel the full blow of the symptoms."
He feels Charlie's lips in his hair, pressing a tender kiss into it. That's usually his job. He's the older one, the comforter, the big brother she never had. He really fucked this up if the roles are reversed like this. Why did he open his stupid mouth?
"Donâ€™t marry for money, ye can borrow it cheaper, my mother always said," Rowena speaks when Castiel returns his attention back to the conversation.
Heat shoots into Dean's cheeks. Surely just the barbecue grill. "Thanks. Youâ€”" She looks so thin. He knows her well enough to know that isn't a good sign. "I heard your yoga studio is doing great."
His eyes fall on the coffee table, and his heart clenches painfully. There they are. The notes from the last four days, slightly crumpled but carefully laid out.
Dean chuckles without mirth. "Can't remember when anyone said something like this about me." He bites his lip, hard. Why did he say that? To a complete stranger nonetheless. Castiel doesn't comment on it, though, and Dean sighs in relief.
of sex, and sometimes, I see you lick your lips or lean forward, and the thought of that in a sexual situation arouses me. But, if I have the real deal, I just can't. I either lose my boner or I just don't get off. It's fucked up. I'm sorry."
In front of the house entrance, he stops. Charlie's words give him pause. Is there something like eating too healthy? Sure, Castiel restricts his eating time, but he showed Dean all these studies proving how healthy that is. And Castiel chows plenty in his eating window, he simply cares about the quality. No, Charlie is just overprotective. It's kinda sweet that she cares so much for his boyfriend.
Dean needs to look away. He feels like shattering into a million pieces. "Will you break up with me?" he asks, his voice as thin as cheap parchment paper.
Thankfully, Castiel takes Dean's words at face value and looks around the room, taking in the details that escaped his tired eyes this morning. Dean's room is tidy, but still comfy, with posters on the wall, little knick-knacks scattered over the shelves, many funko pops of characters Castiel doesn't know, and even more books. The room fits the man who lives here. Castiel wonders what Dean would make of his room in the residential group. The sheer thought of Dean ever being there makes Castiel nauseous.
Charlie nods and pulls Castiel in a tight hug that he doesn't know how to react to adequately. But it doesn't matter, they hold each other up for a long moment until Sam rings the bell and helps Castiel to struggle Dean into sweatpants and a shirt.
"Yes," Castiel says cautiously. "I come from money, and I earnt well in the past. But this hereâ€”" he gestures to the Roadhouse, "is more than I have dreamt of for two very long years, Dean. And you are more than I have ever dreamt of in my
He chuckles to cover up how much he wants to ask it in earnest. But that wouldn't be wise. The longer they keep it casual, the longer Dean can draw out the inevitable.
Castiel sits up and stares at him with widened eyes and swollen lips. He's so damn beautiful and everything Dean ever dreamt of.
Castiel huffs a laugh. "Thanks for the confidence vote. If not even my boyfriend thinks I could succeed with anything in life, maybe I should fling myself off a bridge."
"You could use a cutter for that or simply put it in the dumpster on the back," Dean suggests with a grin, and Castiel blushes. Dean would love to run his thumb over the pink on his cheek and find out how deep it is crawling underneath his collar.
Dean walks through the bus and flashes Castiel a toothy grin when the other man takes his backpack off the seat next to him. Castiel's smile is brilliant. Dean takes a deep breath and tries to rein in the butterflies storming his stomach.
He thinks of the night before when he got ready for his second shift. He brushed his teeth and looked at himself in the mirror, already dressed in the blue vest. He had smiled at himself until he felt his mood rising. It had taken him less time than usual. Probably the filled stomach. Not being hungry for once was rather nice. He shouldn't criticise Dean's eating habits. Eating food from a dumpster isn't safe and healthy either.
"No! You could hurt yourself." Castiel jumps off the bed. "I'll leave you alone if it's uncomfortable with me around."
Missouri smiles at him kindly. "I didn't correct him. I also didn't blow your cover. But, honey, if ya love him, he deserves to know the truth."
He takes the pills and swallows them. He can't even remember how they got home. He hasn't been wasted like that in years. Why did he shoot himself off like that?
Castiel's eyes flicker through the room. This is obviously a pretty relaxed crowd, but he has never 'advertised' his orientation, as his mother put it the first (and last) time he brought a boyfriend home. Not that his relationships lasted long enough to be more public about it anyway.
The smile on her face grows even wider. "I brought it here, actually. As I know my brother, his walls are still bare, am I right?"
He starts every day with a smile now, even if he isn't feeling it. The fake moving of the muscles of his face turns into a real smile eventually. And even if not, he still feels better, and he makes other people feel better, too. Missouri, his social worker, always says that he brings light into every room. She's probably just kind.
"Castiel got it somehow in his head that he doesn't deserve nice things. But I guess he is on the way to recovery regarding that." Dean raises a questioning eyebrow. Hannah laughs. "I meant you, Mr Winchester." Dean can't help but beam at her.
He drags himself under a tree to get out of the sun and slumps down. He feels like shit, but at the same time so much better now. All this built-up tension is gone, leaving a nearly soothing emptiness behind.
, not since the first day. Castiel seems to be the only one off the cards. It can't be a colleague thing either, because Dean flirted with Jenny, and even Castiel was able to see that she wasn't the least interested.
Castiel plans to make up for it. Maybe he could take Dean out. He'll get his first payment today, after all. A pizza in the park, maybe? Sounds reasonable. Dean doesn't strike him to be fancy when it comes to dates. They technically slept through their first.
Dean takes the tub and ushers him in. "Cass brought popcorn!" he yells through the hallway. Several whoops return from the open plan living space.
His body refuses to sleep during the day. If Dean manages to scatter a few naps stretched out over midmorning and afternoon and gets about four hours of sleep total, he calls it a good day. All that sucks, not to mention his completely destroyed social life. Dean's a pretty upbeat person who draws people to him. But constantly underslept, he doesn't like himself on most days, and he won't burden others with his moods.
"Not really," Dean says, well knowing that he has lost this round, no matter what game they're playing.
Dean nearly spurts his mouthful of coffee over the breakfast table. God, this family is worse than his ownâ€”spruced up facade and dirt all over the back, as it seems.
Dean jumps off the sofa, pacing through the living room. "How could he? Everyone needs sex. Everybody wants sex."
Castiel nods and folds his hands in his lap. It's always better to let Dean work through his thoughts, to wait him out.
Dean still hasn't figured out what 'normal' means regarding sex. Statistics will always only get you so far. So he decided to let his boyfriend of nine months take the lead, and at the moment, they have sex three to four times a week.
"This is a wedding, Cass," he groans. "You either get drunk or end up in a food coma. These are the rules."
"Who thought it was a good idea to go cold turkey? That's dangerous!" Castiel hisses in Charlie's direction after she told him about her and Dean's bet. He knows exactly what Dean is going through. He's been there several times before. "We need to get him to the hospital!"
Dean groans, and Castiel cups his cheeks. "Can you open your eyes for me, love? You're worrying me."
Castiel contemplates throwing the sandwiches away. He hates the thought. He used to starve. Thrashing food doesn't feel right. Then, he remembers a discussion he had with Garth about the superiority of PB&Js over grilled cheese sandwiches. So, he slips into the staff room and puts his lunch on a plate. The sandwiches are still good. Dean always gets the ratio of peanut butter and jelly just right to keep them moist without turning soggy over time.
The man tilts his head to the side and Dean starts seeing the family resemblance. "I think that they complement each other very well. I would have expected Sam's best man to see that, too."
Castiel waves him off. "It's nothing." He nods in Jody's direction and leads him to his office. "Coffee or tea?" he asks when he closes the door behind them.
It's a house to be filled with memories. A home, like maybe only the bunker ever was to Dean. It's full of things, some shiny and new, some old, given a second life. Just like them.
"Nah. I wouldn't embarrass you in front of your new family." It's enough that Dean embarrassed himself.
Dean chuckles. "Nah. Thanks to Rowena, we overcame our unhealthy codependency a while ago. I'm happy for him." He stares at Castiel for a long moment. "Have you ever thought of getting married?"
"I asked you. It's my first Thanksgiving with them afterâ€¦ I'm not sure how it's going to be, but knowing that Baby is in front of the house? Sounds like a safe way of escape."
"I don't care what others think. That's none of their goddamn business." Dean winces. Castiel barely curses. "Didn't you know that I would love this part of you just like I love every other? All the wonderful and infuriating parts that make one beautiful Dean Winchester?"
Dean takes a sip of his draft beer, regretting not having gone for a bottled ale. What he would give to play with a dampened label right now. He runs his fingers over the condensation on the glass instead, making a squeaking noise that sounds terribly loud in the eerie silence between them.
Castiel's head is swimming, just like his gaze. He can't even stop crying when someone else is sitting down next to him.
Castiel needs a moment to overcome the thought that Dean could have picked up on his abstinence to process what his boyfriend just revealed. "He did what?"
He's a bit nervous about Dean finding out that he didn't throw the food away. He would die of shame for sure. But he hides the backpack in the reefer in the back of the shop after restocking the fridges in the front. No reason for Dean to open it. Castiel should be safe until he'll go off duty. He can't wait for his breakfast. His stomach is already growling.
Like the day before, Dean slumps into the empty bus seat next to his colleague. He receives one of those adorable little smiles. Castiel even shows some teeth this time.
There is another pause, probably filled with a head shake Dean can't see. "I don't like crowds of people. And my family is, well, my family. I love them, but it's complicated."
The hand on his shoulder tightens in a squeeze, and Dean pulls back, hovering over the threshold in a way that makes Castiel tense in unease. Is he already regretting letting his new boyfriend move in?
Dean can picture him vividlyâ€”a leer on his face, sweet-talking people into feeling safe and then smiting them with the snap of his fingers. That man has to be evil incarnate and Dean won't pussyfoot around him. No way!
Rowena has a power over Sam that makes Dean's stomach flip. She conjures sappy smiles on Sam's face and makes him follow her like a love-drunk puppy. She's a witch, Dean is convinced, but he tries hard not to mention that in Sammy's orbit. He heard the whole that's-a-misogynistic-term speech when Sam was dating that Ruby chick and Dean knows that his brother would only cling closer to the Scot if he knew that Dean thinks that his fiancÃ©e is straight from hell.
Lisa pushes her hands into the pockets of her jeans and worries her lip. "I thought a lot about you over the last few months. About
He watches as Castiel's eyes flutter shut, the eyelashes a nice contrast to his tanned skin. He's a bit on the thin side, but his body is strong. Dean was witness to it when they had to pull the whole back-counter forward to clean up the sugary fluid that ran behind and underneath.
Dean smirks at him. "I always knew I partnered up. But your smartness always floors me, Cass." Castiel gives him an unamused smile.
Castiel sounds like a petulant child. Dean takes in his set jaw and fierce gaze, and he decides to let him blow off his steam. "Have fun and don't overdo it. You've just eaten."
Dean suppresses a hearty laugh. They definitely drew the long straws when it comes to the people seated around them. End table or not, they most definitely have more fun than the stuck up people on the other side.
Dean smirks at him. "You know me too well." His features grow more serious after that, and he runs his fingers over the zipper of Castiel's hoodie. "Thanks, man. For everything. I know I was an ass the first few days. I'm sorry."
Dean cups his face with a tender hand and runs a thumb over his cheekbone. "It's gonna be alright. And if not, we're out of here, enjoying a nice motel. I already checked some out, just in case."
He wakes up in the late afternoon and takes a shower in the communal bathroom. The soup kitchen around the corner is already closed. Until he gets paid the next week, the little money that he has only suffices to pay for the bus fees and his necessary trip to the laundromat. He shouldn't have bought the dress shirt for his interview. It hadn't been necessary.
"We're not working until Sunday," Dean says and rolls his eyes, regretting it immediately. Castiel was right. He isn't fine. His head is aching, and the world moves a little too fast for his liking.
"I know that this is a spectacularly stupid idea, kiddo. But what am I supposed to do? He's been looking for two weeks now. No one is taking him because of his past. I can hardly look for a new roommate while leaving my boyfriend to hang out to dry, can I?"
Careful not to let his boyfriend see it, he puts a small, cheesy note between the sandwiches. He smiles to himself, already looking forward to the flood of heart emojis he will likely find on his phone at his own lunch break.
With a determination that Castiel hasn't felt for a long time, he walks back into town. He has no destination in mind and still, he ends up at Rowena and Sam's tea shop. Remembering his own words towards Dean, he pushes the door open. Sam will know what to do.
Castiel's mouth falls agape. He had expected many things, but this? How the hell did she meet Dean? And why does she know who he is to him? Oh, god, did she tell him that she's his social worker?
"Because she wants me to be happy," Dean says, and with horror, Castiel realises that he has spoken the question out loud. Dean huffs a laugh. "I'm sorry, man. I never planned to say a word. Our friendship is too important to me."
Dean swallows hard. "There'll come a time when he'll realise I'm not what he wants." The silence that follows is heavy with the unspoken confession.
"You should invest in a monthly pass if you work at least four nights a week," Dean suggests as Castiel counts out the bus fee.
"Nearly there," Dean smirks and leads him to a footpath that Castiel has never walked before. "Close your eyes, or it's spoilt when you see the sign."
"Addicts are masters of concealment. Don't worry. He'll be fine, Charlie." Maybe he said it more for his than her sake. Dean hasn't moved much since he started packing, save the constant tremor working through his body. But everyone needs him to be optimistic now, strong. He can break down later.
Castiel grabs his hand, still not looking at Dean. "You are a wonderful man with the biggest heart I've ever encountered. I just worry they might break it."
"Where's Cass?" Dean asks, and Castiel's heart threatens to beat out of his chest. Sam steps to the side, and Dean's face lights up before it turns grim after a second. "Why am I here?"
Thankfully, Dean pats the sofa next to him, and Castiel takes the seat, well aware of how close they will be as four grown adults squeeze into a three-seater couch. Dean doesn't seem to mind that their knees are touching, or that their arms are brushing, every time he leans forward to grab a handful of popcorn. Probably because he does the same with his brother's girlfriend on the other side.
Castiel raises an eyebrow at the word and shows no sign that he got the movie reference. It's not the first time he reacts so obliviously. Dean shakes his head and huffs a laugh.
Yes, starting a relationship is stupid. It blew off in his face twice already. But his exes are both women. Men are different with sex. At least, that's Dean's experience. He might fake it way longer with Castiel.
Dean tries to see it as a positive sign that Castiel didn't chuck him out on his ear. He decides to give him space.
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints at Dean, who is struggling to hold his gaze, blushing fiercely. In a split second, Castiel makes a decision. Maybe he's a fool to try it one more time. Maybe the man in front of him will be his final downfall. But the pull is so strong that he stops fighting against his feelings.
"And this handsome fella must be Dean," she says, still smiling. "Thanks for bringing my brother home."
Walking home the day before had been arduous. He most definitely didn't want to repeat this experience just to bring a hospitality gift. So he forwent the trip to the laundromat and had money left to bring some kind of snacks. He was lucky to find a huge tub of popcorn in the reduced section. He peeled the price labels off in front of the supermarket, earning himself a few strange looks. Humans. Sometimes, Castiel fucking hates them.
Castiel looks good in a suit, even though he managed to get his tie flipped around. Dean thinks it's adorable and doesn't correct it.
Lisa looks over to Castiel, their eyes meeting. "I'm happy that he is more understanding than I was." Her eyes grow glassy with unshed tears. "You deserve someone who accepts you, who embraces and loves you just as you are."
No, he can't talk about that with her. She's not his therapist. And that man only prescribes him pills against his anxiety. Pills from which Dean doesn't know anything. Just like about his living situation or the fact that Castiel is broken beyond repair, that what they are doing right now is basically everything he feels comfortable with in bed.
He takes the offered hand and Castiel's smile grows wider, just like Dean's heart. Castiel pulls him slowly into his arms, lets him settle against him, and rewards Dean's head leant against his own with a gentle brush over his back.
He hastens to the front where Dean and Lisa are talking, she already without her vest, clearly clocked out. Castiel stalls for a second, eyes fixed on her hand touching Dean's arm. He takes a deep breath, pushes the flare-up of jealousy away, and walks to Garth, ignoring the two for the time being.
Dean gapes at him. "Cass, you could neverâ€¦ Of course I love you. My sexuality has nothing to do with my feelings for you."
Anna? Oh, that's the future sister-in-law Sam raved about and Dean thinks he wants to set him up with. Well, that probably flew out of the window a minute ago.
She quizzes Castiel about his upbringing, family, and career. The others join in the questioning, and Castiel feels anxiety crawling up his spine, threatening to spread into every part of his body.
He never wants to hit anything, but she doesn't need to know that. He has to maintain a reputation after all,  and no one suspects his true persona under the easy flirting and his good kissing skills.
"I think it kept him sane last week," she states, watching Dean's reaction carefully. "It wasn't easy on him that you didn't let him stay every free minute."
"No," Dean exclaims. "You didn't." Castiel shrugs. "You'll be the death of me!" He pulls Castiel into a bruising kiss. His boyfriend chuckles into his mouth.
Dean turns to the bearded man that just saved his boyfriend's ass. He tries to place who this person might be. His British cousin, Crowley, maybe?
"Oh. Don't you worry about a thing, honey. It ain't nothing bad," she says as if she could read his mind.
Castiel shakes his head. "Earlier or later I might have told him myself. I mean, Charlie already knew. I would have liked to do it myself, though."
wasn't enough, no matter how hard he tried. Because his dick stayed soft, and arousal was a foreign concept to him. Still is. Always will be, probably.
Yes, their circles have widened over time, with Jody and the girls, Charlie and Dorothy. Still, happiness isn't really part of their lives. They might get glimpses of it, butâ€¦
He's hung up on the thought that he might have a serious crush on his co-worker. That little bastard somehow wormed himself through every microfissure in the wall that Dean built around his heart, and in record time.
Castiel's mother wasn't fond of Jewish people, but one got a pass, probably because he was Polish-born like herselfâ€”Joshua Heschel. She loved to quote the rabbi to her children, and her favourite was 'Self-respect is the root of discipline: The sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.'
Dean stares at the small paper. No bee doodles, no 'I love you'. And then, there's the fact that Castiel never goes out running on a Sunday morning. This is their lazy day. They sleep in, have sex, share a shower, and then walk to the small cafÃ© around the corner offering scones and pie all day. Not that he would crave any of it right now.
The waitress gives him a warm smile as he puts a dollar note on the table. He will have to walk home from work once because of it.
He flushes the toilet and washes his face with cold water. After a look into the mirror, he declares himself passable and puts on a smile, waiting until it appears believable.
Some pieces remind him of the women he used to love. A ring that he had meant to give Cassie more than a decade ago. He doesn't even know why he kept it. Maybe as a reminder? Of what, he isn't so sure. Maybe that someone once loved him, simply for being himself. It's a fucked-up, twisted way of thinking, but well. He's Dean Winchester, after all. Not the best boyfriend material.
Castiel huffs a wet laugh and breathes out raggedly. "It's not that I don't want to eat your food. You know that, right?"
Dean growls at him and sweeps him up into his arms. Castiel lets out a yell of surprise. "Dean, I'm too heavy. You'll give yourself a hernia!"
But what a month it has been. Instant attraction that he has never felt like this before. Secrets, revelations, their coming outs. And now, they will share a flat with Charlie. It's fast. Maybe too fast. But this time is different. Dean knows him.
Charlie looks at him with her stupidly kind eyes, and Dean knows she won't let this go. "You don't have to sleep with him. Just be upfront with Cass. I'm sure he'll understand."
He pulls a flabbergasted Castiel into his arms and presses a kiss on the crown of his head. "Where're you livin' now?"
Castiel swallows hard. Shame washes over his skin and ties his stomach into knots. "Close to St Mark's."
"No problem," Dean chuckles. "You get my engine started with your voice alone, no matter what you say."
"Let me breathe," he chuckles before he presses a tender kiss on her cheek. "You'll break me in two."
"I'm talking about you throwing your lunch away!" Dean snaps. Castiel gapes at him, cheeks turning crimson in an instant. 'Good,' Dean thinks. He deserves that after lying out of his ass.
Dean's lips curl into a soft smile. He brushes a hand through his boyfriend's hair. "Yeah." He nudges Castiel's nose with his own. "That sounds perfect."
Castiel pushes up into a sitting position and leans against the headboard. He rubs his eyes. "What time is it?"
"Congratulations," she says and smiles brightly at him. Castiel feels so much better when he leaves to catch a bus home.
What the hell happened!? Why can't he remember a single thing? Before he can think better of it, he dials Sam's number. His brother picks up after a second.
Dean nods. "I don't know why. Everything is fine and then we fight from one second to the next. I never fought with one of my exes this much. I thought it would be easier this time, but it's worse."
She smiles at him. Dean's hand twitches with the urge to brush a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Muscle memory is a strange thing. "Yeah. I'm doing alright. It's enough to get by."
"You, too, Cass." He takes Castiel's hand and runs his thumb over his knuckles while they eat in silence. "There will always be enough food around. You know that, right?" he asks, Charlie's worries mixing with his own when he watches Castiel help himself to a third serving.
"I never thought that a woman her age would live in a shared apartment. Made me feel better about myself."
Castiel hums his response. He's not sure if he could form proper words with the tightness in his throat. He's nervous. Not about the blow job. He masters the technique. But he knows he'll break the wall today, and everything may come crashing down afterwards. The same could happen if he postpones sex to the last possible moment, though, soâ€¦
Castiel gives him a crooked smile. They all seem nice enough, but he's not really a people person. What was he thinking when he agreed to come here?
Dean shrugs. "I'm not, but it doesn't matter to me who organises things like that. I'm always game for anything."
He simply shrugs and hopes that she might leave it at that. "He talked our ears off this afternoon. Ye left quite an impression, Castiel. I haven't seen him so smitten sinceâ€¦"
He ponders if a good night's sleep would be worth the heartache of working with Lisa again. He had switched shifts when they split up. They parted as friends, but some of her words were still stinging, and Dean needed to protect his once more broken heart.
"As I said. Nothing special." Dean rolls his eyes. "I'll show you at home. I prepared a PowerPoint presentation."
It's a farce, really. What he used to welcome in the past, he wishes wouldn't happen anymore. Lisa had called it their lucky days, those times when Dean's erection didn't flag as soon as she 'tried to make him feel good'. The days when he got hard before she requested sex were few and far between. It's the first time that it's happening with Castiel. Castiel, who is very happy to never have to deal with sex shit ever again.
Castiel bites his lip. "Too rich for their own good." He presses his burning face into Dean's shoulder. "It's another world. I'm not sure if I still fit in," he murmurs. "Too much has happened."
He presses a kiss on Castiel's cheek. His heart clenches when his boyfriend gives him an unreadable look instead of a smile as he usually does. This is going to be a long day.
It started with a tiny Grogu plushie that Castiel brought home from shopping after Dean had gently forced him to watch
"Oh, what about it?" he asks, nervous anticipation building up in his chest. A year ago, they kept Christmas simple. None of them had much money to spare, and Castiel's private therapy sessions ate most of it. A thing they thankfully don't need to worry about any longer.
"Yes. A very talkative one, though." Castiel throws a tea bag into his mug. Castiel never drinks that stuff. He's the connoisseur of loose teas.
Castiel puts his mug on the nightstand, rises from the bed, and embraces his boyfriend from behind. "I'm so sorry." He presses a soft kiss on the nape of his neck.
"You didn't. Listenâ€¦ I donâ€™t have a problem with having sex. Never had. That's why it took me nearly 40 years to come out to myself. And the first one I told was Lisa, and you know how that ended."
"â€™M fine," Dean slurs. His breath doesn't smell like alcohol. The whole situation doesn't make any sense.
"Always so mature," Dean mutters. "I'm pouring my heart out. But I know. You could never love me back. I'm a mess."
Taking care of, Dean has. It's the only good thing about Castiel's night shifts. Every time, Dean feels like a traitor, though. It's not that he hasn't masturbated in the past. It's just that he's ashamed of thinking about his boyfriend whenever he does it. And on top of feeling like a liar about the label that he so proudly claimed, he feels guilty about not wanting Castiel sexually in real life, too.
Castiel watches Dean sinking back into his pillow. "It would make a difference, Dean. Your testicles are important for your hormone production and therefore for your health."
He knows by now that Dean could bounce off the walls when they get home, but after a shower, a 10 am dinner and some cuddling on the couch, he's pretty beat. The best time to give his boyfriend the blowjob of his life. Well, probably not, Dean had likely quite a few, and Castiel is a bit out of practice. But anyway. Dean will glide from post-orgasmic bliss right into dreamland. Perfect.
"Dean!" he exclaims when his boyfriend sticks his head through the doorframe. "What are you doing here?"
His finger slips in easily, and he moves it carefully inside his boyfriend. Castiel for sure is a goner today, his legs already twitching. Dean loves it. Loves to make Castiel feel good.
Castiel presses the call button and dries his palm on his jeans. They are still a bit stiff from hand washing them. No matter how often he rinsed them with the showerhead, he didn't manage to get all the laundry detergent out. But he could hardly turn up at Dean's game night with either unwashed clothes or empty hands, could he?
Castiel shrugs. "I thoughtâ€¦ I thought if I do this for you, then you wouldn't have to use sex toys anymore."
Okay, no quickie then. "Sure, babe." Dean presses a kiss into the soft flesh of Castiel's thigh and pushes himself up to kiss him on the lips. He loses himself in it before his hand sneaks down to his semi-hard dick and pulls a few times until it's filling out. He fetches the lube from the bedside drawer and starts opening Castiel up. His fingers glide with ease, and as always, Dean is in awe about how quickly his boyfriend can be prepped. He himself always needs more coaxing.
Heat crawls into Dean's cheeks. "I'mâ€¦" He looks at the floor. "I'm afraid of flying, okay? But I'd drive up with you. Baby needs some proper movement."
Castiel runs a thumb over the short hair on the back of Dean's neck. "The same reason why I go back home on Thanksgivingâ€”closure. You went through a lot, and it's your right to love your father for the good just as much as to be angry at him for the bad."
Charlie nods. "He should seek help. It can't be healthy. Yesterday, I found him sitting on the bathroom floor, holding his stomach."
She puts a hand on his arm. "I don't want you to hide. I went with you to pride, didn't I? I'm not ashamed of you. I didn't understand then that it was no different to being straight or bi. But I do now. If you can forgive me, maybe we could start over again?"
"Do you know the homeless shelter, corner 8th and Oak street? Pest control was finally done, and the church offered to give it a lick of paint and some repairs."
Dean groans. It's 3 am and he still can't sleep. A late-night talk with his hyped roommate isn't on top of his favourite-things-to-do-after-midnight list.
Castiel presses a soft kiss on his lips and leans his forehead against Dean's. "Thank you. You're an angel."
It's dry and clean and â€“ most importantly â€“ free. His paycheck won't bring him far. But it's a first step back to normality. He won't complain. He brought it all on himself. He and his stupid dick.
Dean scratches the back of his neck. "Iâ€”I get if you want to enjoy your new freedom. I bet Benny's bed is very comfortable. Not as good as my memory foam butâ€¦"
So Dean grits his teeth, swallows his tongue, and plays nice around her, even going as far as agreeing to be his brother's best man. He will still be there when Sam comes running with his heart broken and with his tail between his legs.
Castiel embraces Dean from behind and presses a kiss to his jaw. "They sure will with all the sweets you bought."
He runs a hand through his hair. Just two more hours until Castiel is back, and Dean can just imagine what he might think if he sees his plushies spread on the bedroom floor. No, this won't do.
There's never judgement in Castiel's eyes, just gentle understanding as if it weren't a big deal that Dean lashed out, exposed him, and was a frigging asshole back in the hospital and sometimes since he's been back, too. Dean isn't sure if he deserves his forgiveness, but he's too much of a coward to let go of the man he loves. If Castiel still kisses him after everything he's done, then maybe he should just trust that he won't get rid of him any second, simply because he's needy.
Dean flips another burger and tries hard not to look at Lisa, who just arrived with a big hello welcoming her. He never bad-mouthed her so nobody harbours a grudge. They all know he's happy with Castiel anyway.
He tries to block out Castiel's noises. They should be arousing, but not for Dean. His cock is achingly hard by now, thanks to Castiel's clever mouth. Thank god for little mercies. Still, Dean doesn't know if he'll be able to come and he's already close to overstimulation.
Castiel huffs a laugh. "You might be right. She's an empath for sure. That makes her really good at her job."
Castiel laughs, this time without mirth. "I bring bad luck. It follows me everywhere I go. I haven't had a boyfriend in two years and the longest lasted ten months."
Dean puts his jacket on the coat rack and walks quietly into the open living space. He can barely see his boyfriend's silhouette in the dim light.
Dean's feet are faster than his thoughts, carrying him to the park entrance framed with flowers. He lets his eyes wander over the park and yes, there on a park bench sits the man he loves. Castiel is wringing his hands, and he looks so damn small. Dean did that. He could kick himself. And all about something as silly as eating habits.
The silence stretches into an eternity until Castiel quietly says, "Good night," leaving Dean alone in the pale moonlight.
"Most people do, angel. It's called 'dinner'," Dean quips, but Castiel can hear in his tone that he's worried again.
Castiel moves to the bed and sits down, furrowing his brow. "It's in the past. And not everyone did."
Castiel nods and brushes his moist hands over his dress pants. His last hope that his good interim employment reference would be enough just went out of the window. Heart racing, he meets Adler's eyes.
"Oh, yeah." Dean chuckles. "She's awesome. Is she a psychic? She's given off some supernatural vibes."
Dean clicks the ring box open. He hopes that Cassie is happy with whatever bastard is blessed enough to have her at his side. She still holds a special place in Dean's heart. And he loves that he can talk about her with Castiel, that there is no jealousy, just happiness that Dean once had someone who loved him, and grief that it wasn't meant to be.
"Let's dress you first. The vest might work with your eyes," Dean says and winks at him. He doesn't expect the other man to blush, but a gorgeous pink crawls up Castiel's cheeks. Once more, Dean finds himself staring. He makes a mental note to avoid these eyes as much as possible.
She carries herself like a queen, and despite still struggling with the thought that she might have talked about him, Castiel takes her hand and presses a barely-there kiss on its back. "Pleasure to meet you."
Castiel opens and closes his mouth several times, and Dean wishes the ground would just swallow him whole
He pushes the newspapers much harder than necessary on the shelves. He doesn't know why he's so angry all of a sudden. He didn't think of sex and his inability to enjoy it since the last time he swapped a blowjob for pizza. It was the last time he got so wasted that he ended up in the drunk tank. There had been a life-threatening attempt to quit cold turkey after that and some slip-ups in his recovering process, but he didn't have to touch a dick for nearly a year now. And now he's jealous?
Anger mixes with regret as Dean switches on the floor lamp and sees Castiel's tear-soaked face. "Oh, honey."
Dean walks back into the house to get a refreshment, and when he opens the fridge, he looks at the bottles, thunderstruck.
Castiel smirks at him. "And you're a good man, Dean Winchester," he says and leans in for another kiss.
Castiel feels warmth spreading through his chest at the sight of one beaming Dean Winchester. He had been right from the start. This man will be the death of him.
Castiel knows that it doesn't mean anything. It still sends goosebumps over his skin, something that hasn't happened to him for a very long time.
Dean tries to stay on top of the conversation, but everyone has strange names, and the family dynamics make it difficult to follow.
He returns to the living room where the others have moved back to the sitting area again. He looks at the only empty spot next to Benny and decides to call it a day. The other's protest, but Dean just stares at him with an unreadable look on his face. He sees Castiel to the door.
"You neglected your work until you didn't come anymore," Adler states, piercing him with his gaze over the wooden desk.
As soon as dinner is done, Dean excuses himself and flees to the hotel. A real one that Sam was kind enough to pay. It makes Dean feel only smaller and not good enough.
"You son of a bitch, why do you have to be so fucking beautiful? With those eyes and those hands and those lips? You don't even get half of my jokes. Why do I have to be in love with you? Fuck!"
Castiel blows over the hot liquid and takes a cautious sip. "I know. I was being dramatic. I'm not really used to someone caring. Not someone like you, at least."
When they pass the estate's gate, Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. "That wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
They sit down and eat in silence. It's thick and heavy and Castiel can't remember a single time that it has been like this before. So many unspoken words, so many unasked questions. But what is he supposed to do? Supposed to say?
Of course, that doesn't mean that Dean isn't teasing him about the growing pile of plushies, everything from
He looks up and through the wide windows that give the impression of the garden reaching into their living room. He watches Castiel for a long moment, the way his shoulders twitch as the angel seems to be in deep conversation with a hummingbird. Dean huffs a laugh. Castiel is a weird little bean, avenging angel and little puppy cramped into an unfitting trench coat. At least, his boyfriend owns more clothes now. He simply wears it out of nostalgia.
But this is a joyous day, and Castiel is already in conversation with Helen and Bobby again. It's a miracle how Castiel slipped into his circle of friends and family, how they made room for him. Castiel looks so good, happy, belonging. He's truly the best-looking person at this party. His eating and fitness regime is clearly paying off. Looking at his boyfriend, warmth spreads through Dean's stomach andâ€¦
Castiel blinks several times until his eyes can properly see what's in front of him. It's a shed, maybe more robust than it looks in the moonlight. It is surrounded by bushes, a few raised beds and vegetable patches.
"Oh, you already did. In way too many graphic details. I really didn't need you to spell out the sexual activities you had with your exes. I'm not a prude, but woah!" Castiel's annoyance oozes out of every fibre of his being.
"Hey, no one could know that he wasn't sick," Sam says and squeezes his shoulder. Castiel won't cry. Dean is okay. The doctors said so.
need more than he admits. Maybe he's worried that Castiel would leave him if he confessed his true desires.
Dean hums contentedly when he feels Castiel's hand run up and down his back, soothingly. He could die happy like this.
Castiel realises that he is staring at Dean when the man suddenly gets up. "Anyone a beer?" he asks. Five hands rise and Dean's eyes fix on Castiel.
He stares into Castiel's sparkling eyes a moment too long, and both their laughter runs dry. Sam would tell him not to let his dick dictate his actions, but Dean's dick has no say in this anyway.
"Yes. Health insurance, for example. You could ruin yourself with a stupid accident while out on the run or something."
Dean takes in the pile of clothes that Castiel seems to have put together as suitable for the wedding. "I could try to let out one of your shirts. I'm not a seamstress, but I know my way around a sewing machine."
Dean fidgets with the paper napkin before he runs it over his mouth. Castiel finds his nervousness endearing. He has seen Dean flirt easily with women everywhere, but here he is, cheeks burning crimson, unable to meet his eyes.
Castiel puts the album carefully back into the box and closes the space between them. He pulls her into a big brother hug and presses a kiss into her hair. "I missed you, Munch."
"What? He has no right to make fun of people like us who struggle. People like him wouldn't survive a single day on the streets."
Dean huffs an aborted laugh. "And I thought you would at least not lie to me." He throws the lunchbox on the tabletop. Castiel winces at the impact noise. Dean doesn't care. He strides past Castiel to the apartment door, but his boyfriend catches him when he already shrugs into his jacket.
She stops him with a finger on his lips. "I know. Justâ€¦ When the hospital called meâ€¦" She looks at the closed curtains. "You still can't sleep during the day, can you?"
"Yes. The whole entitlement treatment." Castiel looks at his hands. "Dean, I'm not like them anymore. Life has humbled me."
Dean is proud that he is so disciplined. He didn't miss a single night of work despite feeling shitty most of the time. It's not a physical need so much anymore, more the distress of finding other, healthier habits when he usually would have disappeared into the staff room and taken a slug of booze. Castiel takes over some of his tasks at work, everything that doesn't keep Dean's mind and hands busy, basically. And in the low traffic times, he kisses him behind the slushy machine, just to keep him occupied. It's not that Dean doesn't notice. He simply accepts the help in silence. That alone is hard work. Dean's not used to letting other people take care of him.
"Awesome." Dean grins from ear to ear. If Castiel keeps his work ethics and loosens up a little, working the night shift will probably be as much fun as it used to be with Donna.
"I haven't been on the front, really. Nora wasn't as good with the paperwork as I expected her to be."
Castiel hums. "I know that now. But a few weeks don't erase a quarter of a century thinking otherwise. There are moments when I still have the impulse to please you sexually, when I think I might lose you because of how I am."
Who could Castiel turn to when he was fed up with his boyfriend? Sam and Rowena? Less likely. He wouldn't talk to his social worker either, no matter how much he trusts Missouri. Maybe he'd call his sister? Probably not. Dean can't really pinpoint the kind of relationship the siblings share. Does she even know that her brother has a boyfriend?
Charlie squeezes his shoulder. "You won't break up. You'll talk the shit out and reconcile. You love each other way too much to let a few bumps throw you off course."
Castiel's heart clenches painfully in his chest with a wave of longing and sorrow that no human being should ever endure.
"Creepy," Dean calls, heat rising into his cheeks. He's still not used to being looked at like this. With so much love and devotion. Castiel said he had to learn to live with it. Dean's trying, but as of yet, it still makes him squirm. But in a good way.
Dean is so proud of Sam, of how he made his way, found purpose and love. He's a little bit proud of himself, too, that he raised him so well, that his little brother turned out not half as fucked up as Dean thinks of himself to be. Sure, he could have done other things, could have been a big shot lawyer or something. Sammy's got the brains. But his smartness led him another way, one where he's getting by and can live without work consuming him. He has a good life, a good wife now, and a house that they'll make a home.
A thousand questions are running through Dean's head, piling up in his mouth like cars in a chain-reaction collision. But he doesn't get them out. Not when they exit the bus, not on their short walk to the Gas-N-Sip, and not during their astoundingly busy eight-hour shift.
Dean smiles to himself. Castiel's head lolls against his shoulder with every pothole and every turning of the bus, and it's just perfect.
It's a challenge to convince Dean to meet him on the bus, but Castiel persuades him that it would be silly to pick him up just to drive past his own bus stop. Dean wasn't happy about it but gave in eventually.
"Angel," he says, checking for Dean's reaction. It might have been only a slip or probably a tease even. But Dean just smiles at him, nods, and seals the agreement with another kiss. He pulls Castiel into his side, his thumb brushing circles around his boyfriend's shoulder.
"The shrink said it's important that I function in everyday life. There's no use in postponing my return. And I need to pay my rent, and probably parts of the medical bill. Soâ€¦"
"Oh, darling, you coudna," Rowena objects. "I've gone with the boys ever since Sam and I got together. Now you're part of the family tradition, too."
She pulls him into her arms, allowing him to hide his tears on her shoulder. "I know. It'll be fine." She just hopes that she won't have to help Dean pick up the pieces of his shattered heart once again.
Castiel swallows hard. He didn't think so far. "Iâ€”I'm not sure if I can eat right after work," he presses out.
Castiel smiles at him with closed lips and so much fondness that Dean wants to hide from its warmth and bathe in it at the same time. "You did, right from the start, Dean. I don't need the word to know it."
It's been so long since someone hugged him. He's sure Dean is a great hugger, strong and soft at the same time. Castiel shakes himself out of his reverie when Dean pulls his arm back again and fishes for his phone. He didn't even hear it ringing.
He pushes a package of painkillers over the table instead and watches how Dean's Adam's apple bobs when he swallows them down. He shouldn't look at Dean like this.
Of course, there is another solution, but that's a bit presumptuous, and possibly would send wrong signals, too. But he doesn't know anyone else in the area, and the homeless shelter is closed by day. He ponders sleeping in the park, faking a nap. His back will probably kill him, though. And his work clothes might get dirty.
Dean opens and closes his mouth several times. He can't even dissect all the layers of this sentence. He clenches his hands. What are they playing at?
How is this his life? Just three months ago, he had been happy-ishâ€”the stepfather of an awesome boy, the partner of a lovely woman, a house with a garden, the apple pie life he had always longed for as a kid. It wasn't all roses and sunshine, but what relationship is?
Castiel has a plan. A good plan. They've been together for three weeks now and he knows it's time. Dean has been antsy the whole past week, and Castiel is smart enough to connect the dots. Dean needs sex but he doesn't want to put pressure on him. Dean's perfect, but he's also just a man with urges and needs.
He'd love to show Dean the beautiful autumn colours in Vermont, but his savings aren't big enough for that. But maybe a weekend trip for Dean's birthday. He hopes he can save enough money until Christmas for that. Dean deserves this. And Castiel is taking good care of his health. He won't need a doctor for a while.
"Cass!" Dean could hit himself. How did he mess this up so badly? "You don't have to lose weight. I like your little love handles."
Castiel slows down his chewing. Time stretches until he swallows the bite. Unlike his boyfriend, he knows not to speak with a full mouth.
Castiel's glee slips off his face. "And I am the only one currently working there who has the commercial education to run a business," he bites.
Absent-mindedly, Dean brushes over his chest where the shirt is still a little wrinkled. It felt so right, like two puzzle pieces slotting into place. But looking at Castiel, he's not so sure anymore. His stomach ties into knots at the thought that he might have destroyed everything.
Castiel finds him dozed off sitting on the bathroom floor, embracing the toilet pan. Concern creases his forehead as he tries to wake his slightly shaking, sweating boyfriend.
"Society needs good mechanics just as much as doctors, teachers, and sanitation workers," Hannah states.
Castiel sleeps over at Dean's after every joint shift, and he has woken up more than once to Dean's morning wood pressing somewhere against his body. Dean, the perfect gentleman that he is, always rolled away as soon as he was awake enough to register it.
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints. "This is your body, and its reaction is perfectly fine. You are aroused. Just from kissing me. I take it as a compliment." His lips twitch slightly. "It's okay, Dean. I know that you have a sex drive. It's fine."
"The flood at least wasn't as bad as when Cassie tried to create a drip irrigation system for his flowerbeds," Hannah snickers.
It's the truth, though, but no one around this coffee table would believe him. He worked so hard on building and keeping up the facade of being a big flirt and someone collecting lovers left and right. The spiel is second nature by now. Sometimes, Dean doesn't even know which parts of it are truly him and which are just veneer.
