"And we should have a code-word if we were to discuss something serious so the other would know when not to just crack up jokes about it..."
"I'm not as perfect as people assume I am either," Rogers seems to take pity on him and steers the topic slightly.
"I don't mind, as long as it won't attack me in its current state if I try to use the toilet real quick," Bucky told him, making Tony type with a smirk.
that,” Tony told him. “But nobody’s invincible, and when I saw that you didn’t vanish, after coming back from space, I... was secretly glad that you weren’t risking your life anymore.”
So he traded a few things around and felt quite accomplished when he got a quite useful (and old too) spell-book for next to nothing.
Thor was too tired to even try to at least object to the pronoun that didn't fit him. Not that the little beast's pathetic little high-pitched roars would prove Hulk wrong anyway.
"Yes," undoubtedly, there were some members of the team who liked to post then, when they looked like male models, and Phil had the
That's what Steve wanted to say. Reassure Tony that he wanted that relationship just as much as Tony, although, after the last 3 days, he didn't know yet in what form or shape could they manage it the best.
"Yeah, yeah, and they are always so grateful that they barely want to let me go." Steve clearly meant the supposedly cured patients.
," Tony noted. "And I kindly ask you to stop communicating on the speakers of the room and direct all your answers to only me, on the screen. No offense, but the
"I think you'll be fine," Loki assessed, reaching for Bucky's hand with a comforting gesture. "Unless you wanted to date him because then I can't help with your regrets."
"Yeah, sometimes more than one, too, I'm never going to miss that routine," Pepper pulled an unamused face. "But you said it, they were all
“I want to nominate you and the new CEO,” Steve found Tony in his workshop, almost too busy to appreciate when Steve kissed his neck.
"I could give you my phone for real this time. That way, maybe you could reach me to ask if I was back in town for Thanksgiving or something if you'd still want to meet then."
"You had been already useful, are you kidding me? Taking the Stone from Jane, telling us where to find it in the first place... Besides, I'm not a child just because I'm not a mythological god, I'm a scientist who can calculate the risks, and I'm telling you, I want to do it."
"Rogers. I figure my best course of action is to try to keep away from him, so that's what I've been doing..."
“Why haven’t you told me?” he finally asked Steve with a confused expression once they got to the room. “We’ve been dating for years but we have to come all the way to 1970 for me to figure out that the man I love is an Omega?”
Because it was the Grandmaster's ship that picked them up. And Loki didn't want to think what would the Grandmaster do with them as punishment for the failed escape.
Once he wasn’t kidnapping Tony against his will, Steve turned out to be quite charming. When Tony felt a bit better - usually after a small nap, though he couldn’t sleep more than half an hour now because of the pain - they would play guessing games. When he was worse, Steve told him stories about his past and all the Omegas he rescued, and it was a comfort.
"Banner!" Thor immediately turned back. "You're on an alien planet, but I need you to come with me, to Asgard. There's a fight to be fought."
He would have taken Thor's pain away and suffered it a hundred times over still if it meant that Frigga was smiling at him proudly, and Odin didn't have any negative comment on Loki or his magic.
But he didn't start elaborating on specific films, and Steve thought it was already surprising: Bucky not only sat in silence with Tony when he got his arm, but they talked. Even if only about Steve's subpar taste in movies - as Tony surely would put it.
it. If Steve knew he could get off topping people and it could be just half as good as with Tony, maybe he would have tried it before. He was disappointed thinking that - as usually, it was the case with Tony - it was only a one-time thing, but he turned out to be wrong.
Why? It was part of a new unspeakably nefarious plan to eavesdrop on the Avengers' plans, of course, nothing to do with the pets he got.
"I'll think of something," Tony quickly promised, suddenly way too much conscious about the simple fact how Rhodey could always make him laugh, and now he knew it wasn't just a mere accident. And as always, when in pain or doubt, he had the worst defense mechanism: joking about it. Because if he was grandma, then Rhodey was? "Bye, grandpa..."
Thanos not only snapped away half of the entire universe but also made sure to half every soul-marked couple.
"You know, Steve, you're one of the few who I know for sure that could have never been my soul-marked, but sometimes still wish were."
Steve didn't think either, but that was just his bruised ego talking. Just because he was taken aback by anyone kissing Bucky right in front of him, and how Bucky let it happen.
"I couldn't," Tony agreed. "So I only hired and assigned him as her assistant, and I'm only biding my time until they realize-"
Shit. And that certainly qualifies as a real reason for Steve to ask him follow-up questions of the topic, so they aren't quite done with it, not just yet.
"No, I'm going to be very busy soon. I'm just a sucker for superheroes, and man if Colonel Rhodes doesn't look sharp in that uniform," he said, not expecting the mics to pick up on that, already making his way to Rhodey who was making his way to the exit.
"I'll stay here," Tony told him. "Pep told me we're one of the few companies who could help people now, so I expect I'll be busy soon enough. You?"
And that was enough for Rocket to attack Ronan then. Both of them were seniors and about the same height, so it should have been an even fight, but Rocket seemed almost wild with fury and could have seriously hurt Ronan if not for Groot pulling him off the other teen.
“The pain isn't so bad now,” Tony told him. “Just don’t stop. You want to take my mind off things? It was working.”
But maybe that was only his self-destructive side, Winter Soldier just without "the crazy". Also whispering into Bucky's ear about other aspects of his relationship and life that he knew were totally bull.
"I didn't do anything wrong, Tony," Happy kept his calm, and only put a hand on Pepper reassuringly, who was about to send Tony to hell.
And how? Well, that was the ingenious part of Loki's plan if he did say so himself, even though understanding his wit would have been only possible if anybody had at least as good of an understanding of magic as he did, and there was no one fitting that description, but alas.
And after that Rhodey took the suit flying for about a whole 10 seconds in the garage before he asked if he could take it out on the open for real, and Tony sat down with a coffee, scrolling down on Twitter for the longest time until Rhodey had returned.
Then, Barnes not only disappeared but surfaced on US soil again as the Winter Soldier. And not just that, but a monster mind-controlled by Hydra too.
"I have been in love with Steve since forever, but waited 70 years for him to catch up," Bucky looked into Steve's eyes. "And even if he never saw me that way I would have been okay with that."
"I think he means you owe us a tour if you feel like you're up for it," Steve told him, also giving Tony a kiss.
Thor gave a dissatisfied noise hearing that nickname, but Hulk must have been right and he needed to sleep badly because once his hunger ebbed, he was already halfway there.
"He should be fine, usually he pulls himself together when it's time to fight. I'm sorry your night was ruined though. Next time I'll hide the booze better."
Bucky wouldn't have put it behind Steve to try to seduce him only because of pity, trying to heroically help out a friend selflessly no matter what, but this attraction didn't seem to be forced or faked.
"You forget, I also had Loki for a brother," Thor smiled. "But I can't just leave now without asking first. If you could perhaps change your mind about it if I stayed. I know I'm nothing like your beloved Margaret, and you aren't like Lady Sif either, but I also tend to think that's a good thing."
"I wasn't kidding," Tony's face fell sensing Steve's distress. "I wanted you since I came back from Titan, Steve, or maybe even before. And if you don't want it the other way around then I'll just have to be with you in a way I can."
"I trust you already can guess what I'm thinking about you anyway," Loki was in so much pain it wasn't really making it easy to even just talk, not mentally function.
"I want to try it," Rhodey seemed both excited like a little kid, and also hesitant. "But if you invented it, shouldn't you fly it?"
"But she's more powerful than I am. It's only a matter of time and she'll figure it out for herself, you know. She's the one who restored my magic too. Without an incantation or conscious effort. She just asked me if I was broken, and she should fix me. Looked at me, and I was-"
The doctor was a capable and kind Beta, explaining it very politely to him - even sending Steve out of the room since he couldn’t provide any official documentation Tony was his.
"And here I thought sorcerers weren't truly monks," Stark was doing the same thing as Stephen when he tried to get Tony to do something he resisted, and then Strange challenged his ego a little bit, and even though Stephen knew this, it still worked.
it meant anything since I was so drunk I could barely think straight, but it won't change the fact that I involved both of you in my drama when I only meant to royally self-destruct. You know, as I usually do. So I was hoping maybe we could all put it behind us, what do you say?"
"Yeah. I never expected him to accept me. And now he's even making jokes about it, it's quite surreal. I'll need some time to adjust."
Although, Quill still wasn’t big, and that was part of the problem. It wouldn’t have mattered if Ronan was to beat him up if he could at least land a few punches on his own.
"Nicely done," apart from breaking a child's heart, Strange did well on getting them out of the vision, so Loki guessed that was it.
The last thing Thor needed was to be given to the Grandmaster - again! just - as a pet now. Who knows what that lunatic would do with a small beast. Maybe even eat him or something.
"Fair warning: Peter's still living with me, and even though I love him to death, he can be a handful, picking up guys like Wade..."
"It's not a date. It's her way of checking up on my mental state. And you don't even have to do anything, just go out, have some food, and don't give her any reason to doubt your mental sanity."
"I like my current arm plenty," Bucky said, but Tony saw how he eyed everything in his workshop, and he was still toying with the new arms movements.
It was just dumb luck that when Tony broke the piano Rhodey was out, so he wouldn't figure how it happened, but he was suspicious, at least.
"I can't tell. Are you referencing some vampire movie I haven't seen? Your list just begs for an edit, Cap."
He'd be no doubt captured by the Midgardians this way, but he couldn't even use glamour to change his appearance, and couldn't keep his eyes open.
“I’m sorry I... what is... I don’t. I mean... that’s not... you can’t be...” Tony was incomprehensible.
He expected Strange to spiral into a fit of rage hearing that, and he was secretly looking forward to it, but his words had an opposite effect. The Doctor dropped his drawn shoulders and sighed.
But in case something happened in the school, or Principal Ross wants something newsworthy (or what he deems as such, at least) showcased, it's too "boring" for anyone else's tastes so that only leaves Phil to deal with it, and he was only ever so happy to, for years.
"Only for a visit. Some people would like to see you. I promised to try to persuade you on their behalf."
"It's just only polite!" Quill said. Not to mention, he wanted Gamora as a friend then. "In my previous schools, and believe me, I had many, I'd always had a girlfriend..."
“You can still help Omegas who desperately need you,” it’s not like Tony didn’t admire Steve’s determination. “But as I’d told you, I’m not like that.”
Steve was part of the team still, but now almost useless, having regrets for the first time since he was changed back. He couldn't even hold up his shield for long now, not without his arm going numb.
Bruce was so different than for instance Thor and his friends that Loki begun to think that maybe it wasn't quite horrible that out of all the mortals he could have been switched with, he got Banner.
"What the hell do you think you're doing out of bed?" and he didn't seem happy, so Loki automatically could only manically grin, falling to his default mightier than thou attitude he ever so often used.
"I'm sorry too. I truly believed it was best if you'd have never found out. At least now you know why I wanted to have distance from you sometimes," Bucky explained, hoping this meant he could get it.
"How 'bout a deal then?" he offered to Loki. "You conserve your energy by not talking, concentrating only on getting better, and I not only won't let anyone know you're here but once you're sufficiently healed, even take you wherever you'd want to go."
"You don't have to decide now, either," Thor gave him an easy way out. "But the gang isn't going anywhere without Quill picking up some new music and some movies first, and Rocket and Drax getting drunk, so I'll expect I'd only have to leave days later unless you tell me that maybe I shouldn't."
And, for a couple of days, it seemed like he got what he wished for, but it also meant Steve was conscious around him like never before.
"If the villagers see you, they'll talk, you know," he heard Bucky's voice from the inside. "So unless you want them to have the wrong idea, either leave or just come in."
"This pitiful curse will only keep me incapacitated for about 5 to 10 minutes," Loki told him. "So if you want to kill me, you should get on with it right now."
"Traitor," Tony dramatically gasped, but Steve knew he was covering up content. "So sorry, Cap, but if that was all, then you should leave."
After the transformation, Loki was healing fast and almost effortlessly, and strangely, he got along with the Captain better than if he was himself. Maybe having a small and helpless had its advantages when it came to the nurturing type of heroes that the good Captain was.
"The chance that I get hurt and unable to speak at all is still more significant than I'd like, so I need a workaround ASAP, while I ran tests what happened if this new feature was added to the Tower's speech recognition system as well, but there is a risk that it would create a security gap."
"For the record, I have never said that I didn't want to," Rhodey stated with a small frown. "That's why I left and still got upset yesterday. It's okay if we chose to ignore it, but we've never even talked about it, not even once."
"See, another unexpected move. You've just said you know I could kill you without effort in a blink, and you still don't follow simple commands."
, doing a mix of old dance styles he once knew, and the new ones he saw in a couple of videos, he only noticed Steve and Tony were there when they must have already seen him.
While Loki got some of Bucky's worst memories, Barnes seemed to have anticipated this, and not only stabbed Loki while he had to get close to Bucky to connect to his mind, but used a cursed object to do it.
Steve was about to say something, but then, his phone went off. Tony couldn’t believe anyone would carry such ancient-looking and dated tech, but then Steve’s face went dark upon answering it. He cut it short, but Tony didn’t even have to guess what instructions he got from the other side.
And when Tony offered to make something to help Rhodey walk again, while Rhodey was honorably discharged, and in need of special physical therapy that Tony insisted he'd pay for just to get the best doctor anyone could get, it was easier to coordinate all three from one place.
"And my uncontrollable daughter who just held me hostage and in a coma for weeks... I sometimes wonder that if I ever wanted a relationship, maybe it would have to be with someone like you."
Nevertheless, Quill had always liked music, and dancing was something they could do together for free with his mom every single night - before her illness got worse, so...
Time was on Steve’s side, making Tony trust him more and more, and Steve used this trust to show him that what Tony went through never was supposed to happen - and won’t happen ever again.
Finally, he notices he didn't even sleep a wink, and he might not know everything, but he knows enough, and he sort of wants to do it. Given everything, he feels it could go either spectacularly, or go up in flames horribly, so he gets a second opinion.
Especially with Steve getting closer than ever to him, without a clue how it affected his supposedly best friend.
So when you met a guy or girl for the hundredth time with the "kind" or "honor" or "dignity" mark on the left hand, but they used their right hand, it was obvious they had the procedure.
But, letting Nebula die, only to incorporate her into his systems, when he was too late to ask for her permission was not something Vision wanted to do.
In the meanwhile, Tony wasn’t 14 anymore and knew more about tech than Howard and Obadiah combined, so of course, he had found out and confronted Obi.
"Yes, but you did teach me how to cast an illusion, and use the gaps between reality to hide anything, so all I did was just combine the two, and hide while keeping the illusion up-"
"Will you ever stop?" Loki closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Unfortunately, him taking Tony's sadness away also seemed to have empowered Stark's confidence.
"That's enough," Steve stood, just as Pepper jumped and slapped Tony so hard the sound almost echoed in the deep silence now that Vision stopped the movie.
His mom always told him his dad was a phenomenal dancer and that's where Quill inherited his "talent", but Quill suspected she just saw how much he liked to dance and made up stories when she didn't even know who his father was.
Except, somehow that is only the beginning of Steve making plans for the both of them, and while it's not a big deal, it suddenly turns out to be when Steve doesn't just kiss him goodbye one night but also asks.
"All I'm saying is that I've changed my mind," Loki declared. "For a lack of a better option, you'll do for the task at hand. After all, this is all your fault."
Loki only remembered wishing that he could just conjure his knives, even if he couldn't have magic back like ever when he just... blacked out. Woke up with no memory, naked and not happy, because he was still in Sakaar, based on the decor.
And it had a positive effect. Even from a very young age, Loki could take away the pain of others, and make it his own. If he wanted to be honest, sometimes it seemed like it was the only skill his family appreciated.
disappointed by you, Loki. I was tempted to melt you into a puddle, but then I was told that then the body of my Champion would be gone as well, and that can't happen. So if you want my forgiveness, you better find a way to switch back and do it fast. Otherwise..."
"Sometimes it's just trivial things," Coulson notes, because now Rogers was making him sound bigger than life.
"You mean it sometimes glitches?" Tony was already seating Barnes down, ready to hook him up for diagnostics.
The only thing he doesn't like about his new hobby is how he'll revert from his usual self to a high school student with a very shallow and embarrassing crush whenever Rogers is around, so he tries his best to avoid the captain as much as he can, and concentrate on the job Fury had given to him.
"So you were a helpless animal and the Hulk took care of you? That's just weird. Feels like I missed a century, man."
"But do you think I should ever come out? Or just keep that private, not exactly a secret, but not admitting it in front of everyone with an internet connection?"
Then, a covert SHIELD mission popped up, taking Steve off the grid for 10 days, and when he got back, Bucky looked tired. Resigned. Distant.
"Well, it's not easy to predict, but if you wanna do it, and you time it right, and we chose the platform wisely, then... it can be done. Although just to be clear, it's not what I've meant to suggest."
So, it still could be much worse. That itself maybe wasn't a comfort, just a fact, but something to give him the will to go through one day, and then the next, always concentrating on the just one, but starting again the next day, on repeat.
In any capacity he could, even if for him it only meant that he joined both Thor and the Guardians and tried (and sometimes failed) to instruct them to fight with some sort of strategy, coordinating mostly from onboard the Benatar.
And, to make matters worse, Bucky was looking at him with an expression that indicated that no matter their previous disagreement with Cap, they still were in complete agreement about this.
They had been together for just half a year but seemed as if it was always that way when the army had conducted a search and rescue with Rhodey in the suit, and the media got a whiff that there was an exciting new tech that was flying around and Rhodey had to do something with it.
"I'd undo his Snap then as well. I can only turn back time completely in a given space, or not at all, I can't concentrate the magic on his body, but ignore his fist..."
"But I need to transform myself to a lesser being, so more of my magic could go into healing my injuries."
He might have been unable to sense real grief as humans would, but every time something reminded him of Wanda, it was as if he started a very complicated and tasking calculation he never got to finish, and the cognitive unease was unbearable.
"That spell better worth all this trouble," Tony could only mention, because it's not like it would be safe for him not to learn how to control this power that was dropped in his lap, so he had no choice.
"In that case, I can also give you some closet space," Tony couldn't believe it, but Stephen was smiling at him.
He sure won't give birth without help... He was more pain than he ever thought was possible already.
Except that then there was something wrong with the ship - "a fucking faulty Terran part!" according to Rocket - so they were stranded for a couple of more days.
"I'm gonna fucking kill Stark before I let that ever happen," Strange growled. "Even if at some point Jade will be older than him going back and forth between possible timelines and aging differently, I imagine, I'll just..."
"Call us a couple of calculators whose only special ability was that we had legs to walk on?" Vision questioned.
It was a bit overwhelming at once, but Tony must have kept these things in for a while now, so the least Steve could do was to humor him and learn how to use a new phone.
He had devised an electronic Nest (a metal shell) that would act as a substitute to a real one, in case the Omega’s Alpha was dead or too far to help, easing at least some of the Omega’s distress by keeping them "safe".
"You hated it," Tony could sense it from Steve's painful expression. "You wanna go back as fast as possible because you can't stand the thought of spending one more minute with me-"
Loki still wasn't above stabbing Thor for that suggestion, but then, he took off on a Chitauri ship and got lost in the crowd on the ground. Secretly switching sides, and working on eliminating any Chitauri ship and crew who got far away enough from the main battle.
"I thought after Ultron you knew to be careful with these things, Tony," Steve sat down on a bench press, and Bucky already knew this sentence will not bode well before he saw Tony's head shot up from his typing.
"You? Oh no. Buck, if you ever hurt Loki, I won't be able to be friends with you anymore," Steve then just said, which made Loki smile, but not his partner.
"No offense, because I know Stark is very capable considering he's just a mere mortal, but I doubt that's possible," Thor sighed.
"I asked Quill to go to the prom with me," Gamora said. "But he told me he'd rather go with someone else."
Those who turned completely dark had been suffering constantly for decades, so it wasn't usually born out of nothing, as the stories sometimes would lead you to believe.
So it was unfortunate because while it meant that he could save Midgard and even the individual Midgardians who would have been caught up in his spell more efficiently, he didn't count on staying alive while doing it.
"I am calmer than I have been for years," Pepper stated. "Why not let him speak? He's only this honest when he's drunk, and every time he acts as if he is the victim, I am only more convinced that I've made the right decision breaking up with him."
After New York, both Frigga and Thor tried to appeal to Odin on Loki's behalf. If it was up to his adoptive father, Loki was sure he'd be locked up in a cell somewhere with the keys thrown away forever.
Woke up in the nurse’s office still breathing while none of his body parts seemed to be broken - a miracle - but when he tried to sit up looking for his comics, he could only collapse back to the bed. That’s was only when he noticed Rocket and Groot were there.
“You could help me pick more people. And speaking of picking… I’ve narrowed down our list of names for the pups as well, you wanna hear?”
Tony could never be the Alpha heir Howard Stark wanted. If he could have, he no doubt would have disowned his son.
"So you know who he is," Loki said. Already cloning himself with a simple illusion and sneaking behind Barnes, but Barnes might have expected that from their previous encounters because he was alertly positioning himself in the only place of the room where he couldn't be surprised that way. "But I'm not here to kill you."
"Yes. Geniuses tend to change the world, but that change often skyrockets if they aren't working alone," Loki said, and Tony just smiled.
"I will. Buy something," Coulson tries to pretend as if it's not a big deal. "Maybe not a mug, but I'd like to support the team, so, maybe something more practical..."
"Right. One is that your posts get as many likes and shares as anyone on the team, but you don't update so often as the others."
"Actually, I think you'll find that this is New York. Nobody remembers, cares, and/or isn't too busy constantly being on their phone."
Only, as always, the spell came with a very steep price. It would grant your most desired wish, but the reason it was forbidden because it would grant your wish in a way that was also nothing like you imagined. Many magicians who cast it went mad, turned dark, or resorted to suicide because they couldn't take the reality they fabricated with it.
?" Peter was staring, but not any less than Stark, who was so shocked that he was rendered speechless.
"Maybe I needed some time to adjust, given the era we're from, and what I was told when growing up, but I still don't know why would that matter."
Loki may have thought he wanted recognition, but even if he still felt that way, he'd be conquering only one planet in Thanos' name, with an army that wasn't even his. And maybe he'd have some power on Midgard, but he didn't care about mortals, and it's not like he wanted to stay on a planet that was so crude and primitive.
“Hi,” he wasn’t used to Alpha’s addressing him either if it wasn’t another degrading order during sex. “My name is Omega Society Protector Captain Steve Rogers, but please just call me Steve. I’m an OSP officer, and I got the task to check on you this year. I’m an Alpha, but don’t be scared, I’ll probably only take you away from your Alpha for half an hour tops, and won’t let any others get close to you while the interview. I hope you don’t find me intimidating, but if you do, this is an Alpha-spray, you can carry that until we get back. Do you have any questions before we go?”
"Even living in the caves as a madman, but still going strong because of all the energy I have on Asgard as a deity is still better than-"
"I didn't teach you to talk back to me, boy!" Odin was furious, but probably just because Loki's words were closer to the truth than they'd ever been.
Loki hoped his eyes conveyed, because he just used all his dwindling magic at the moment for the transformation, so he couldn't just turn back to send Steve to Hel.
"I'm almost healed, and clearly just a burden," Loki thought better about it, now looking for his clothes Steve hid somewhere. "So I'll leave..."
The girl just held out a hand, and Ebony collapsed. Then she made another gesture, and Strange was free, and another, and he was good as new. And angry as hell for some reason - at Loki.
Loki only transformed to Stark - knowing full well that the original one was most likely away working, and it would be the least suspicious if he was to leave the Tower.
"Are you really?" the Captain questioned with a tone that left no doubt that he saw through Loki's usual tricks easily. Maybe he was something else and not just on the battlefield.
In his line of work, Loki's reputation was as good as his livelihood. You couldn't be a proper villain if you were a laughing stock, after all.
Not thinking much of sleeping next to Thor every night when everyone was cramped into such a small space together, only getting somewhat of a surprise when they had defeated the next 5 space-maniacs and there was nothing left him to do, and Steve asked Quill for a lift to return to Earth.
And Thor, the perfect golden brother, who was still trying to save him, what did he do? Loki was jealous of him for almost a millennium, but wasn't Thor just the product of Odin pulling his strings from the background, just as he did with Loki for so long?
"Got to such a serious 'friendly fight' while training, that they perfectly matched the data the security system had on seriously threatening postures and movements. They almost destroyed the whole Tower, when Friday tried to eliminate them and blamed me."
“Pep said we’re doing better now than just a few months ago,” he told Steve one day. “So would you finally train me? I know we’ve talked about it only in passing like a year ago, but I simply didn’t have the time then.”
"It wasn't a bad idea, after all, was it?" Steve wondered, a bit sad that it was over now that he was leaving.
"Ha, that's new," Bruce noted then asked. "And just for the record, now you're not a cat, and I'm still very much naked and in the same bed as you so... nothing happened?"
"Alright, will this take long?" Tony could only sigh. "Because I wanted to go back by lunch, I have an SI board meeting at 2."
Only seeing Steve next when there was a mega-threat again, some crazy Midgardian scientist going too far with his experiments, and this time Loki showed up not to scavenge alien shipwrecks but to back the Avengers up.
"For the record, I didn't," Rocket told him with a voice and a gesture that seemed to be his attempt to calm him down. "I was trying to be funny."
"I only have the capacity you raised me to have," he snarled back. "No doubt fearing the repercussions of raiding so many, defenseless worlds, you took in a Frost Giant baby, and raised it as more of a monster than any of my people originally are. Hoping your actions and golden son will look better by comparison."
"Oh," was all that Tony could say. "So I have to tell you that I feel the same way? But I already kind of did."
There was simply no way Steve would accept that. He used the sanitizer and fast healing foam Tony had used on Bruce before. Alerted Friday that they will need a Quinjet for transportation and Dr. Cho should prepare the new Regeneration Cradle.
So even though Tony never went back to the psychologist, he knew he was proven wrong once again. And if she was right about his friends, she was probably right about other things too.
But then, he saw the blond Alpha, telling Obi that no, he would not take a drink before taking Tony for a walk (it was OSP procedure that Omegas were always taken away from their Alphas for a short talk where they could tell “freely” if they were harmed in any way), and when he turned to Tony, Tony felt his crappy heart almost beat out of his chest.
If there was no other way out, and Friday wanted them to have a cozy little chat, she shall get it, Tony thought.
Tony wanted to tell him it was illegal for Steve to do any of that, but his brain turned into mush. When Steve pulled back, Tony found himself only scenting him back. Then - as if it was the most natural thing - he kissed the Alpha, never letting go.
"What do you have in mind? Should we take over the world? A galaxy? Or poison everyone at dinner and see if the nanobots can find and neutralize a toxin that's not from this planet?"
"Ha! Hahaha," Coulson laughs, but it comes out forced, and it's not like he knows what is the normal reaction to this. "Nice one, you almost got me."
"Speaking of impending disasters," Tony said. "I'll give you my phone number if you, in turn, take out Pepper to dinner."
Steve, on the other hand, hadn't said a word about what happened. It only proved how he didn't treat Bucky like he was his property, which was very nice of him. What else could a retired assassin ask for?
"What does it look like? I'm eating," Rocket told him. "Despite your poor upbringing, you seem to be familiar with the concept, so I don't get your confusion."
"You're right, I like to screw with people so much that I'd do it, even if I maim myself in the process," Loki sarcastically said. "So of course, please, go with the madman, that's a better choice..."
Problem was, it had a remarkable effect. Stark worked for 3 days straight without sleep or rest, like a machine, upbeat and with measurably faster and trashing less of his ideas later, so arguably with better results as well.
"I begin to suspect doing the right thing would be more appealing if sometimes it wasn't just so damn tiresome," he noted, picking up a fighting stance.
"Shut up and give me 5 minutes to fix this," Tony told him, but Friday spoke at the same time, telling them something completely different.
And maybe Stark thought he was still being a bitch about a spell he used himself or took it as a sign of how the extracurricular part of their arrangement should be ended, because he never approached Stephen suggestively again after that, and that was good.
That was unexpected but appreciated. It gave Loki still a second chance to maybe - just maybe - set things right.
"I can do most of what he does," Rocket shrugged. "And if it's more of a biological matter, my teammate, Mantis can probably turn his mind back. You'll just have to get him."
"At the risk of repeating myself," Tony got back to his previous line of thought. "Where should we go? Somewhere with a dress code?"
Steve had never considered crossing that line with Thor before. He must have gone real red too, because Rocket, who was doing maintenance on the ship and were just passing them, commented on it too.
"Exactly," Phil can't help but smile back this time. "It's hard to tell the difference without any routine, but you can always post more, as I've already said."
"Believe me, I can't work from here, so I want you to eat and get well soon," he told Loki. "But I also have a feeling if I don't ask you this now, you'll never tell me. So... what kind of spell did you have me under for the last three years?"
Bucky would have questioned why shouldn't they try to wait the program out, but given how the other two acted, he only took a couple of steps back, gathered some speed, and delivered a punch right in the middle of the door, using his whole body weight behind his metal fist.
"Sure. It looked like you did," Loki was just about to add something unpleasant to that sentence, but when he saw how the first thing Strange did was to check up on their daughter, his spite vanished.
"Feel free to dedicate your life to writing poetry about me after this. I except I'm quite a muse for somebody like yourself."
Steve hated it, but he did every test and poking and "resting" routine she asked, while Tony was yet to wake up, even once.
“Tony...” Steve didn’t even know what to say. On one hand, if Steve had any doubts about whether Tony cared for him just as much as Steve for him, this would have been enough to prove him wrong. It was moving that Tony would just come out and say how much he wanted to keep Steve safe. But it was also as if after all this time, and all their years together, he still doubted Steve’s abilities because he was an Omega. “As you know, I’m pretty hard to destroy, and I can hold my own.”
Stark's curse was that he was in an era where Midgard wasn't blessed with many brilliant men like him, and alone he was just a small clog in the machine, not having much effect.
And then, Loki finally figured how Bucky' darkest secret wasn't his brainwashed or his vampirism, but how Steve's opinion would perhaps change if he knew.
Or so he thought, but it was just then when Stark had stepped in with a bunch of obnoxious balloons that were meant to inspire the Captain to "get well soon", and when he saw a random black cat, his first instinct was to transform his watch to a weapon and aim it at Loki.
"You don't wield the Time-Stone for a number of years without not having some insight," the Doc told him.
"Then, make me angry," Loki couldn't believe he barely got his mind back and he was volunteering for yet another possibility to lose it again. Not to mention, endanger Banner in his body, because the Hulk could hurt him if he didn't like what Bruce was going to say.
"That's why I'm not suggesting that, but a three-way, closed relationship. Stranger things have happened, and we could still kill each other
“STAY,” Steve directly ordered, and basically ran out of the room. Got back with the medication, gave it to the whimpering Tony. Making Tony’s Heat-filled mind think he was going to leave him as Obi - locked up.
And suddenly, it wasn't just them anymore, but all the Avengers joining them, sometimes even guests. Pepper and Happy often showed up, but then, when once they arrived together, it turned out to be catastrophic.
Also, the pull he felt for Tony could no longer be just the byproduct of their biology, but it was still there. Different, but better as far as Steve was concerned, because what remained of their connection was something that they've built together back when they were dating. Which meant that if anything went wrong or changed that was beyond their control, they could still correct it in a way that wasn't.
"I was wrong," Wong stared at Strange. "He'll not only kill us in days but let the word be destroyed in a matter of hours. Why didn't you stop him?"
"What part of nobody else can substitute me don't you understand?" the human shook his head. "Otherwise you wouldn't be in the position you're currently are."
It didn't feel like it, but Steve smiled at her still, and she smiled back. And if nothing else, Nat succeeded in making him feel less crappy if only for a minute, because she reminded him that even in what it felt like the end of the world, he still had friends - like her.
“And that would be a great idea except now they are on a lookout for us, and this mission wasn’t supposed to take longer than a couple of hours and I don’t have a day,” Steve tried to not panic, or hate the fact that the 21st century almost had him convinced that it didn’t matter what he was when it just compromised this mission.
"You were right," Tony even looked up from his toys, giving him a look. "I don't have the slightest clue why you're here, Cap, but do me a favor and ask me directly."
Loki thought he must be getting better indeed if he could think of the aforementioned activities with such vigor now. But he listened to his body once before when he should have used his words instead when he first slept with Tony, so now he tried to concentrate on what mattered.
"Oh, Wanda..." Vision could only say next. Lost for words because he was so glad to have her back, but there was no need to say more because then Wanda was both smiling and crying, and also kissing him at the same time.
"It's only recently gotten worse, so... and you already know Bucky is my best friend, so I expect you'd like her, she's at least funnier than him..."
"Except, I'm not trusting you with our plan completely alone," Loki reminded him. "And the Hulk hates you. Maybe hates you the most."
He was so preoccupied with that inner turmoil that he barely noticed the Shell-man and the Spiderling creeping up on him. It was only his luck it was a clone they had found first.
Just when Steve was half-convinced Tony was also gone, and it was like an absolute miracle to have him back.
. And I'd hate to see him ruin what you have, just because he thinks the 'secret' is to have Bucky, and not commitment or - God forbid - making an effort to have an honest relationship."
"Right after you told me what I needed to hear. Not even my mother could bring herself to do it, not to the degree you did at least."
“Get yourself killed. In the vision everyone was dead, but you died in front of me. And it was my fault. What if it really will be, because I created the time-GPS?”
"You could have called ahead, Doc," Tony seemed to be surprised to see him, but also glad. "Or after the crisis is gone, you've already got rid of my number?"
Loki devised like a hundred possible escape plans in just his first week there. And was about to leave truly after the first two, but then something unexpected happened.
"It's not about that," by now, the movie was completely forgotten, and Steve looked as defensive as he felt.
"They drink milk. No fault of tiny kitten if Angry Girl don't know," Hulk's enormous hands very surprisingly gentle when he raised Thor and gave him a small pet on his head.
"Well, that might be an advantage then. Maybe you should show a little bit of that side of Cap as well."
If this was a game, Barnes seemed to know how to play it, at least he opened with a pretty strong hand, and Loki could only encourage that.
"No, but look," Loki used a charm that Odin used on him. "Now you can. If I can give you one piece of advice: never raise her with siblings. I don't think you'd want that on your conscience, Doctor."
"You think they'd even let you in your precious Tower looking like this?" Strange tried to stop him.
"And what if I wanted to look at some nudes? Do you want me to do it on your laptop SHIELD gave you for work?"
They tried everything under the sun. It was exhausting, trying to appeal to a reason of a child who was convinced that they knew better.
And, as far as the days went, Hulk's predictable routine was both a comfort and a good enough opportunity for Thor to plan an escape, so he stayed with Hulk for now.
"Even if I had a way, not to mention a way without my magic," Loki started. "I don't think I want to change back just so you could kill me."
"There is a chance the world will be ending in the next couple of days, no matter how small," Tony told her, but spoke as if he was talking to anyone but Friday. "She can't keep us locked up if we're needed to stop it. And even if not, I'm sure at one point Clint, Nat, Hulk or Thor would like to use the gym, destroying the door if they had to."
"I begin to think you wished I was," Bucky said, because he hadn't seen Tony for weeks, and this was the first sentence he chose to open with? "Steve, aren't you supposed to be at work?"
Tony shoved him away pretty hard at first, but when Steve thought it was because they were done, Tony's suit opened up and he stepped out of it, pulling Steve back close, getting rid of Steve's belt with one move, working on his pants next.
Still, Tony shouldn’t have flinched. Another careless mistake like that, if he left his mind wander, and Jarvis would be only memory. Tony was quite sure he’d die without him.
"Whatever you say. I give up. You win! We'll never get out of here," Tony lay down on the floor between two treadmills, taking cover. He couldn't bear the thought of looking in the direction of either super soldier. God only knows what they could have been thinking.
"You've been lying around, useless for weeks, and now look what you've done! You've upset her!" he looked like he could chop off Strange's head with the relic he was holding for it. "Jade, darling, don't cry, we can have ice-cream if you want..."
"Even if let's say I'm attracted to guys, and that might hurt my future career at some point, just as ruin some of the expectations the girls have about me online?" Steve then asks.
"Yes you are," Steve told him firmly. "If you aren't comfortable with who you are now, you can still become the Thor you were once before, but you can't give up."
"And what if you're right? Let's say Friday isn't salvageable, but I cook up a new machine learning gig, and it spits out me and your buddy are more compatible than you're with him or all together?"
But that was over when Rocket showed up, with his indispensable bodyguard, and wanted to give Quill his phone back.
"Leave? I wanna murder you nine ways before Sunday, but I'm not gonna let you fucking leave," Tony told him. "If what the Doc said was true, I'm the only thing that's keeping you alive now."
"Unless you bought it while I wasn't looking, wasn't it a little presumptuous of you to buy it even before you've talked to me?" Steve couldn't help but smile at Tony. It was so like him to do something like this, and Steve missed it dearly.
"I think I've just come up with one," she told Vision in her last moments. "What will the villains of this galaxy see just before their well-deserved death?"
Even months later he wasn't closer to figuring out Bucky's secret, but Barnes now sent Loki his address first, no matter how many times he moved.
"Should I tell them we broke up?" Thor inquired. "Because I couldn't keep my mouth shut, and it agitated you so?"
"Exactly," Loki hoped at least Tony getting this now would mean that Tony will stay away from him. When he could without killing Loki, that is.
"That's the key to a lie too, by the way," Bruce was now even trying to change the subject for Loki's sake.
"Um, so," Coulson reverts to examining the charts and graphs he printed out for Rogers, but they are little help when he can't concentrate on them. "You're popular online. There isn't much to discuss, you're doing a good job at it."
"They kinda grow on you, even though I wouldn't call them my friends to their faces, but they are my family now. Not unlike Thor is yours, even if not by blood..."
"In that case out with it, Rogers," Loki jokingly kissed him, letting go of the magic, paying full attention to what they were doing then.
But even if it was the real thing, he could probably run only a couple of steps, and he’d be caught and bought back again, facing a provoked Obi.
They were just kidding around, like so many times before, really, so Tony had no idea why Rhodey chose this moment to just - out of the blue - kiss him.
"So, if this was your last day on Midgard, what would you do," Loki just asked. A part of him was sure he did because he wanted to get to know the strange habits of the people who bested him in New York against all odds, so if they miraculously would survive this, he could use the info.
"Well, I'm not a counselor," Phil at first tries to straighten the question out for a serious answer since this is the first impression he's making, but when he sees the bored faces of the athletes, he thinks better of it, and switches tactics. "Or your mom, Rogers."
"Promise. And Barnes, you're welcome once again to my workshop," Tony turned to the Bucky. "If you still want to visit, that is."
But, Nebula had indexed memories and direct neural-link in her hand for easier reprogramming. Maybe her previous body couldn't be saved, but Vision could save her data?
When it was all said and done, Rocket put the Soul Stone into a safe container and walked up to Wanda with it.
"You don't want that. I can be brutal," Loki grinned. "But I'll tell you this: maybe my idiot of a brother was right about one thing. Midgard has some certain qualities I overlooked."
Not that it changes anything. Coulson has his strengths, but he doubts any of them is what Steve is looking for in a guy, so.
Or rather, completely forgotten, once they weren't dying. Although, maybe it was better to be said that they weren't dying - just yet.
As Tony hadn't considered dating Pepper originally, he was even less likely to let himself ruin everything he had with Rhodey for a night. But now that he knew that maybe it wouldn't be just that, he was constantly thinking about it.
"Is that all?" Strange wondered, but then, when the other wizard appeared, he turned back to Tony. "If you manage to teleport yourself the way you did in your dream, showing Wong and me, you got yourself a deal, Stark."
“I hope the pups will take after you. You’re extraordinary - as always,” Steve told him, as often as he could, hoping that if Tony heard it enough from him, one day he’ll believe it.
And the next thing he knew, they were kissing, and then, just at the very worst of moments, the proximity sensor of the ship went off, signaling that another ship was passing by them, and they had to rush into the cockpit to try to radio them, everything else put on the hold.
"And the smaller you are, the more magic you have to heal, right? So it should be a kitten then," Steve held the device in front of him with a furry little beast displayed.
But then, Tony was right, and as the Avengers, they never had time, they were interrupted so Steve had to go left and Tony right, then a base was after them, then when they got back, Nat was gone, and Tony needed to design and build gauntlet for the Stones, not even coming back to their room for the night, even though Steve waited up for him.
He managed to get home somehow, and even skipped days trying to recover, but while his body healed, his walkman - the only thing he owned beside a couple of comics - was also cracked, and he couldn’t replace it.
"I'm no longer a Captain. In a certain sense, I never really was. And it's not a competition," Steve tried to tell him. "And I've lost my way too. I had to become like this to remember."
"It means a lot coming from you, especially since I know how you felt about Bucky coming here," Steve told Tony, who hearing this retreated to pretend to busy once again.
"Do that and I manufacture you a whole set of mugs in return. Did you also want a webpage featuring it?"
“But that doesn’t mean the police and the OSP isn’t after us, and maybe even mercenaries that Obi hired. We can’t run forever… and…” And destined mates was such a scary concept when they barely knew each other. Just when Tony was free of Obi’s control, now he was dependant on Steve?
"You're meaning to say you teleported on your own?" Strange seemed to be stuck on the least important detail.
Steve could only groan when he saw himself photoshopped into a picture where he was indeed holding a kitten.
"Yeah, it's one of the reasons I don't like being online so much. I don't like the idea of someone going through all my entire electronic trail, and try to judge me based on it..."
Obadiah didn’t bond him - he already had a bondmate. He did something worse. If there was a business client he wanted to please, they could spend a night with Tony, where nothing was forbidden - except biting him.
"I'll pour you a real drink, while I pretend to join you with some water, and you have to tell me all about it."
"Peter knows how to take a good shot, and he's been known to photograph moving subjects exceptionally well, so he has my full confidence."
"Should we do something about...?" Loki was wondering. In a way, if Jade just adopted Thanos as a baby, he was a grandf- who was he kidding,
Not that it did any good. Obadiah’s punishment was never so bad before, and all that changed was that Tony couldn’t move for weeks after the incident. He was resolved not to build anything ever again, but then he didn’t get any food for a month.
"AH! But I've got news for you!" Rocket laughed. "Everyone knows! Hell, we've been betting when you'd finally get together, and I'd be damned if I let the grouchy machine girl win."
"Because if we were to proceed with this very pleasant activity, I think I could tell you," Steve suggestively pushed Loki into the bed, and Loki loved it.
Tony couldn’t believe Obi was his mate. But he never was separated from the Alpha for such a long time, not since he presented. And it was just Tony’s luck. Finally getting away from him just for a while, only to find out he can’t even do that because it was literary killing him.
Sometimes, like when they were just having fun spending time together, Tony wondered if the mark was a guarantee that they could have that always if somehow he managed to convince Rhodey to stay with him for good. As much as anything could be a guarantee, at least.
"Okay, as far as I can tell, there is nothing wrong with her software, but I'll directly check the security logs too," Tony said. "Until then, try not to die for real, because I'll turn off the alert."
"I think I begin to sense that," Quill gave Rocket a smile, who seemed irritated at first, but then his complaining didn't fit the fondness he addressed Groot with.
And then there was a huge fight that was quite frankly way too exhausting for a local Midgardian threat, but when Loki wanted to leave, Steve came up to him, and not only kissed him when it was over, but straight on dragged him to his bed next, and it's not like Loki had ever had any problems with that part if the Captain was offering.
"Let's not tell him that," Strange decided. There was some hope for them just yet, maybe, if they played it right. "It's better if he isn't self-conscious about his magic, or we're just as much in deep shit as you've said."
it was only because I tried to protect you. I was your only weakness. Maybe I still am," Bucky hoped Steve could tell he was honest.
"I'm sorry, Banner, but without my hammer, I'm useless," Thor was no longer hungry, so he stood to get back to work.
That said, sometimes payback was still in order, but luckily, Tony seemed to be entertained by that side of Loki as he was fine with all the other sides of Loki, which was not a small feat, given that he knew Loki the best.
“I don’t like it. I know we owe it to everyone and ourselves to try, but... when Wanda mind-fucked me all those years ago, I saw everyone dead.”
"Well, I'll be seeing you-" Tony said, and wanted to leave, and judging by his expression, he wouldn't return either, not soon...
So maybe Loki couldn't live with Tony honestly, but he could sacrifice his life without lies. After all, Thanos taught Loki most he knew, and there was no way for Loki to win, but at least he could protect Tony, right?
"I'll go with you to see her," he then manages to pull himself out of his head if only to kiss Steve now. "She must be amazing."
"You just stay away from my private areas or I'll kick you," Loki was adamant to go through the nightmare on his own if he had to.
He also took a page from Tony's book and when they didn't see eye to eye about something (Steve would have been floored if there was anything important they could agree on), he just made a joke and moved on, rather than inviting an argument as they so often had in the past.
Then there was the issue of Tony Stark. Notoriously only dating Alphas - so much so that rumor had it he was born an Omega, but Howard paid people to turn him into an Alpha - suddenly kissing Steve.
