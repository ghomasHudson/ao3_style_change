“No, I, uh – I’ll have in today.” He swallows down the nervous tingle in his throat and tries to smile, but most likely succeeds only in giving a weak half-grimace.
Two weeks after the date, Sherlock slips into the coffee shop on a Friday afternoon. The door bell is barely disturbed and neither of the two seated patrons glance toward him. Sherlock is glad for it, feeling of late some old and long-buried self-consciousness that makes him crave invisibility.
man to room with him, even if that requires lying about his proficiency in ever being able to shut up.
Finding himself back in the university library, Sherlock walks up three flights of stairs for good measure before sinking heavily into a chair in an empty corner. He scrubs a hand over his eyes and focuses on his breathing.
The only response was the cocking of his friend’s head to the side in askance. He realised very quickly it was of imperative consequence that Sherlock departed the bathroom as swiftly as was humanly possible.
Sherlock should feel a little stupid, standing alone in a hallway, grinning down at his mobile phone like this. He should feel ashamed of his own lack of decency in this moment – but he doesn’t.
Whatever his face is doing, John grins at him anyway. A genuinely pleased, gorgeous thing, bearing no hints of malice or amusement at Sherlock’s expense. He drinks it in with a flicker of his eyes, committing the rare image to memory.
It occurred to John just as the incessant ringing finally stopped that it hadn’t been his ringtone at all.
The laboratory door opens just as Sherlock discards his pipette. The two drops he’d deposited onto the petri dish cause a precipitate to form in the blue solution.
“If you were to leave, I – I would understand. I know this is… I know the depth of this infraction.” Of course he would understand. John treasured photographs the way he did tea, or the smile on someone’s face after he had helped them, or those times when he could persuade Sherlock to eat something for breakfast with him, or those preposterous Bond movies, or the graceful way Sherlock played the violin when he played for him, or reading in his armchair on quiet days when it rained.
“Lestrade thought the M might stand for Moriarty. He suspected a copycat or an underling,” John supplied, sipping his tea.
For a moment, they stood still, looking everywhere but at each other. Then the press and surge of those around them became too strong a force to content with, an elbow into John’s back knocking him forward a step, and a high heel onto Sherlock’s foot compelling him into movement. Soon they were dancing together, and it was somehow both the easiest thing in the world and a task that required the most amount of self-control Sherlock could ever recall exerting. Every inch between them had to be fought for, the crowd vulture-like in its quest for more space.
The overall transformation managed to take years off his appearance, but Sherlock thought there was something missing. John regarded his watchful eyes warily.
There’s a beat of silence before John snorts with laughter and begins shaking his head. He chuckles to himself for a moment, looking at the ground.
Such an admirable amount of self control was expended in the way of ensuring Sherlock’s mouth didn’t drop open – that would be too much for his pride to handle – that as a result, he was unable to prevent his eyes widening.
It was locked with a passcode that he had neither any desire or hope of guessing correctly, though the lock screen showed a missed call and four unread messages from Lestrade. Hazy images that may have been memories flitted through his mind, and he remembered the case. The noise of Bonfire bar; the bartender smiling amicably at him and saying in a silky smooth voice, “You waiting for someone?”; turning away after an offhand response and striking up a casual conversation with a woman standing nearby; waiting and waiting and then the sudden onset of disorientation; Sherlock’s arms around him and his cologne engulfing him in the cab... He must have been drugged.
It's been a hot minute! I'm basically unable to write during the uni semester, but now that's over for a bit I'm free to work on this fic again. I do love it. Thank you if you've stuck around and you're still reading. x
That isn’t to say that the man was not a gentleman – he was, without a doubt – but he had always found himself somewhat subservient to the whims of his more base desires. Certainly, whenever circumstances permitted, he enjoyed the surprises of dating and the familiar comfort found in serious relationships, but he could not deny the primal pleasure he derived from pure sex. Filthy words being growled into ears, sweat-slick rutting in alleyways behind seedy bars, legs beginning to shake uncontrollably beneath him while his head was dipped between thighs – he loved it all, drank in every ounce of sensation with wolf-like satisfaction.
He had been apprehensive of her forward enthusiasm in dancing with him. However, he had since surmised that what he thought could have been targeting him as a murder victim was actually just desperation.
Yet, Sherlock still finds himself leaving his last class — vector calculus, dull — ten minutes early in order to rush to the coffee shop. He has absolutely no knowledge of its closing time, only the crucial understanding that it opens at 5am and remains so for at least four hours (he’d skipped a useless morning lecture once or twice, and still managed to stop in on his way to campus).
Sherlock turned to the first woman nearest to him who was mostly unoccupied and pliant enough to turn away from the people dancing with her. They were clearly not particularly close friends of hers.
John’s vision blacked out for a moment, in which he could have sworn he heard the quiet whoosh of fabric being dragged over skin. When his eyes fancied themselves ready to become accustomed to the harsh bathroom light once more, Sherlock was poised before him, completely naked. It did not escape John’s notice that the man’s thin, perfect cock was standing at half-mast.
There was no use in even entertaining the thought of hiding the uncapped bottle of conditioner – oh god,
Being embarrassed in the company of Sherlock Holmes was worse than having an entire stadium full of people laughing at you. At least the crowd would be neither as annoyingly gorgeous nor as dickishly intelligent as him.
The soft, reassuring hand in his makes him push it away, keeps him moving without a hitch in his stride.
Sherlock begins to feel a flicker of panic sparking heavy in his stomach, then hurriedly remembers mercuric oxide.
Also, shout out to the two professors at my uni whose last names I stole. I’ve never met either of them, but they have brilliant names. And to the professor whose Tuesday morning classes I consistently fell asleep in – thanks, I guess.
John innocently looks up at the building while Sherlock unlocks the door. Starts a sentence about it being nice, or having character, or some such irrelevancy.
Glancing at the ceiling, John wondered what would happen if he simply stood up, grabbed his towel and left the room. Sherlock would be unbothered, no doubt, but John’s pride would surely sustain a beating.
Initially it had been irritating that the flat had become littered with photo frames almost overnight. He thought they were redundant – why use vital space in the physical world for such a trivial thing, when the moment could be captured in its entirety in one’s mind? John had reminded him that not everyone had a mind palace, thank you very much. Eventually it had become endearing for him to turn in the living room and spy a photograph of John and Mrs. Hudson at Christmastime, John wearing that awful jumper he called “festive, you idiot” and both of them sporting matching smiles of pure warmth.
Sherlock knew that he was wasting precious time, that he should move on to the next woman – the next potential murderer. He had the repulsive sense that there was something he was missing, a stray thought nagging at the edge of his stifled mind, just beyond the clutches of his fingertips. Something was strange, different, notable.
Sherlock’s smile turns uncharacteristically sheepish as the barista wipes his hands on his apron and takes a seat across from him.
For his part, Sherlock is taken aback by the piercing question, and John thrills at the knowledge that he guessed correctly.
“John, there’s something… I should say, I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.”
“Donovan has, yeah.” The remnants of humour slipped from the inspector’s face. “No one particularly unsavoury has been sighted entering the club, but obviously with the killer’s record of discretion, that’s to be expected.”
Several long moments later, which had consisted of John staring at the object, silent and still, the door opened and Sherlock strode in.
John hadn’t worked a morning shift in the place before yesterday – or, not one that Sherlock had graced – and therefore had no real evidence to support the assumption of his return. Had something Sherlock said or did given him away? Did John somehow manage to notice, amongst serving an endless line of customers, that Sherlock walked through the door with the ease of someone who had done the same thing a hundred times before? That he didn’t glance up to survey the drinks menu? Did Sherlock merely seem like a creature of strict habit?
“How was the third victim burnt? I hardly think holding a lighter to a knife would have much effect.”
The man was a marvel, a renaissance painting, a symphony in himself. Sherlock found himself wanting to catalogue every twitch of his mouth, every
Two of the small circle heard him, appearing wholly unconcerned when they looked at the girl. She was decidedly nestling into his shoulder, her eyelids suspiciously droopy. One of the women shrugged and the other leant in, speaking in an aloof manner, “Who cares? About time she found her boundaries. Never has enough to let loose, does she?”
Sherlock has been avoiding John and they both know it. How will John react when he finally comes clean with the truth about who he is? Will they be able to get past the lie?
He had also neglected to shave, a practice he usually performed daily with religious devotion. His five o’clock shadow made him look younger, owing to that ironic tendency within young men to grow facial hair in a bid to outwardly prove their maturity. The slightly dishevelled result somehow appeared both intentional and effortless.
“How do you feel about the violin?” Why is his voice doing that? Something inside him clenches a little in apparent distress at his own blasé tone.
They share soft, secretive smiles, their appreciation for the company and the conversation going unnamed but not unacknowledged. Then Sherlock packs away his books with a rustle while John shuffles over to the counter, the dishes that await him in mind.
Every time he gets up to do a quick walk around to other customers or ducks behind the counter to serve a harried student on their way home from the library, he finds himself just a little worried the spell will break. Worried that when he walks back to the table, this low-voiced chemistry student, with eyes like electricity and a face seemingly chiselled by Michelangelo himself, will tell him it’s been nice to chat but he’d rather not do so again.
When they break apart, they’re both breathing hard. Sherlock’s porcelain nose is tinged pink with cold. He leans his face a little into one of John’s hands, which still haven’t moved.
Sherlock has to admit, if only inwardly, that it’s possible the last addition had been a bit much. It’s awfully fun, though, this elaborate attempt to entice a stranger to himself.
“I’m going to get a drink,” Sherlock shouted, not willing to take the chance of leaning closer to her.
A few seconds later, it was clear Lestrade’s voice in her ear had given her words of admonishment, for the grin left her face as quickly as it had appeared.
Getting lost in the music was far too easy, and if he didn’t concentrate on preventing it, he was in danger of having it consume him. Halfway across to the spot he had aimed to reach, the beat changed mid-song. The application of diminution saw it pound into double time and take Sherlock’s self control with it. Before he knew it, he wasn’t just inching sideways a little awkwardly, while he carefully calculated each motion to match the song’s rhythm: he was dancing.
“Of course. This time I troubled myself with containing the mould cultures in this bucket instead of using the bathtub, since you expressed such vehement dislike for the idea after the last occurrence.”
“Yeah, Sherlock. You are.” John shifted on his feet, hands clasped behind his back. He didn’t get why Sherlock hadn’t known it earlier.
John started laughing, harder than he had in a while. This seemed crazy, when he stepped back and thought about it.
There was a noise irritating Sherlock, boring through his ears into his brain. He looked around near the floor, where the noise seemed to be coming from. He didn’t see the source, but there was a crumpled-up piece of paper on the floor, seemingly from John’s bag, which was lying only centimeters from it.
Sherlock knew he probably shouldn’t look at something that wasn’t his — that would be invading John’s privacy.
He was so enamored with his shy but brilliant lab partner that he couldn’t care less about getting into trouble for not doing work.
He’d only had eyes for one person for ages. And he felt it really was bittersweet, but he was fine like this. At least he had a vent. Talking to someone who didn’t know who he was (and therefore that he was the recipient of their affections), but knew what he was feeling was incredibly therapeutic.
The bell rang again, letting John know he’d definitely be late now, even if he ran, so he stuffed the flyer in his bag and jogged up the stairs.
“What on earth…” John approached her desk, bending over to look at the computer screen. “Is that a tutorial?”
At first, he’d thought the message on the wall could have been from Sherlock, but that was just his mind letting him fantasize. First off, Sherlock’s handwriting was different than that of the note. It was messy, as if his mind moved too fast for his hand (which it did) and he couldn’t be bothered to care (which he couldn’t).
Sherlock flung open the door and made his way up the stairs, yelling, “Come on, we’re wasting daylight!”
Sherlock laughed, hopping out of his seat, and John realized he thought it was a joke. “Well, I hope to see you around, John Watson. Actually, I’d hope to see you at Blacklock at seven o’clock on Friday.”
Sherlock went on as he was, building his wall back up. Every time he saw John, he imagined who his heart belonged to. The somebody else.
John pulled out his phone and set it up against the wall so it was facing him. He moved the laptop out of the way and turned on his sister’s desk light before pulling the mirror closer to his face and clearing his throat.
Sometimes it just hit him, that he and Sherlock were together and okay and Rosie was happy and it filled him with this warm fuzzy feeling that he never wanted to dispel.
He realized that although he wasn’t the most socially involved at the school, Sherlock knew what was going on. What those messages said.
Clara laughed and slipped into the living room, taking a seat on the couch. “It’s fine. I’ve gotten used to it.”
The bright red eyeliner pen resting next to the laptop drew John’s eyes. He picked it up and rolled it around in his hand absentmindedly. He had never really messed around with makeup, except for one time in grade school where he had worn blue eyeshadow and pink gloss for a week on a dare. He’d always been a little nervous to try.
Sherlock was pulling things out of drawers and bags, placing them on the table. He set a couple of new packages on the table and crossed the room to grab John’s hand and pull him over to the chairs.
John unscrewed the tube, pulling out the lipstick wand and leaning closer to Sherlock. “Ah, you’re too tall. Tilt your face down.”
“Oh, get out of here,” the young man snapped. “I’m not going to get anything else out of you today.” He waved a hand at his sibling dismissively.
They’d be stunning, of course. Crisp in a suit or a gown and somehow just as gorgeous in pajamas with nothing shiny. And funny. And interesting. John Watson was someone who valued interesting things — he liked to collect strange objects he found, and wrote a backstory for them in one of his many journals.
“John?” He sounded appalled. “No, this is not a braid. You’re amazing, John, at many things, but braiding is not one of them.”
It couldn’t be him. It was somebody else. Somebody else … why would you say “somebody else” if you were looking at the somebody else?
She had never been embarrassed about her feelings, and shared everything with her fathers. (Hence why they knew she’d never had a proper crush before.)
“And,” Sherlock continued, having moved onto a more interesting topic, “she met someone. In her … calculus class. No, right outside her calculus class. She … dropped something … no! The flower fell out of her hair, and he picked it up. But … she was already gone, and so he pocketed it. And … yes! When he saw her in calculus, he gave it back to her!”
“Here you go,” the server trilled, setting down a dish and two glasses onto the table before spinning away to take someone else’s order.
Both of their phones began vibrating nonstop as John grinned at the camera and Sherlock sat speechless.
“What’re you fantasizing about?” John’s voice came before Sherlock could gather himself. He felt another flush making its way across his face when John saw him with the flyer.
“I’m studying this bacteria culture and how it reacts with various chemicals. I think they’re,” Sherlock nodded up at the rest of the class, not even bothering to look at them, “doing something with plant cells,” he said quietly.
“I’m not his date,” John said automatically, brow furrowing. Sherlock said nothing, only looked at John expectantly.
His heart sank. That must’ve been what all the rugby players were talking about. He’d overheard them at lunch. They were talking about
“Homework on the first day?” John asked in wonderment. “How did you know that, and why are high school teachers so cruel? It’s only the first day!”
“You’re going to want to start with primer, obviously. I’m not going to explain why, because if you’re that incompetent, you should not be wearing makeup at all.”
“The livestream, John! You’ll be doing my makeup. God forbid we start late; the internet would have a conniption.”
“He may not accept, but just so you two know: it’s definitely a possibility,” she said, pointing the butter knife at them.
“Yeah, it’s this guy named Sherlock Holmes. He’s pretty good.” Harry twisted her wrist slightly, her face close to the mirror.  “Done!” she exclaimed, capping her eyeliner and tossing it down with a flourish. “I’ll be back around twelve. Don’t wait up!” She flung an arm around John’s neck and kissed his cheek before grabbing her bag and rushing down the stairs.
“Now get some sleep.” The excitable blonde nodded, and kissed both of them on the cheek. (She had to get on her tiptoes to reach Sherlock.)
He wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers, the sight of the work he had chosen to leave untouched causing a small wave of panic to stir in his chest. He sat back down, picked up a page, and reluctantly began to read.
It was safe to say that John was speechless. He had never seen nor imagined himself with actually well-done makeup before. And he had to admit: he looked amazing. His eyes were both darkened and brightened by the eyeshadow paired with the jet-black liner, and his cheeks looked soft but sharp at the same time.
John turned around so quickly he hurt his neck, despite already knowing who it was. How could he not? He’d heard that voice everywhere.
His buddy to the left doesn't seem to be quite as competent. "Come on now, we were just having a laugh-"
the small sample he had of boys his age in secondary school had been incredibly skewed because here he stands with a good handful of young men that seem…
"He's not," Sherlock barks viciously because he hates this. He hates even the hint of possibly more with John. More than just soft smiles and late night takeaway and pleased little giggles. He hates to think there could be more. There couldn't. There is barely
"And I really appreciate all your help with this assignment, I mean I would have been in serious trouble if it weren't for you." Victor smiles sincerely, nodding at Sherlock with gratitude.
"Have you been in the heart of the city before?" Sherlock murmurs, afraid of breaking the spell lighting up John's face.
that he isn't the only one to notice. He's sure that he's seen the blood race up Sherlock's neck and stain his porcelain-like face when their hands graze as they walk beside each other. He's sure he's caught Sherlock looking away far too quickly when John's breath ghosts across his cheek when the blond turns to face him where he's peering over John's shoulder. He's sure Sherlock notices as much as John does.
"Alright, alright, I get it," Greg waves him off with a click of his hand, nodding. "It's not that it's surprising, I was just hoping I would be there to stop him when he acted."
He doesn't sound the least bit sorry. "Greg, would you just tell me?" John bites back, cheeks heating with embarrassment and confusion.
"Sherlock, I swear to God-" the tinny voice of his brother came through the speaker hovering near his ear but Sherlock was no longer listening. Pulling free the flashlight he'd taken to carrying with him in case an impromptu investigation happened, he crept into the darkness, following the sounds coming within.
John cursed his body and then his brain, then wriggled out of his shorts and pajama bottoms and tossed them in the hamper. He glanced at his clock. 6:30 AM. No way in hell Mike was up yet.
. You're such a loser stalking around campus like you're so much smarter than everyone else even though I'm certain you've never had a cock in your arse, pathetic virgin pretending to be so much higher and mightier than everyone else. And finally someone shows interest in you,
It's not anyone else that has caused the silence previous and now shortness of Sherlock's texts. It's not an outside source that's settled friction in their interactions, albeit not face to face. It's not a third party that's setting off this uneasy feeling like something is definitely wrong.
And John Watson finds it almost impossible to breathe all of a sudden as the angry raging beast that lives within him rears its ugly head and scents the air, growling low in its throat at the sight of a rather pretty brunette girl standing to Sherlock's left, green eyes locked on John's roommate, gently curled hair bouncing down around her shoulders.
"Of course with sweet virgins like you," John continues as he pulls one languid stroke up Sherlock's shaft, "it doesn't matter if you start fast or slow. You're going to come quick and hard either way."
He flexes his toes against the tile out of habit, watching as the muscles contract through his leg. He falls into first position, then second, appreciating his slender, toned body so much more now that he knows what it does to his lover. The things John whispers to him in moments of passion burn bright in his mind as he rises up on his toes, not quite on pointe but steady on the balls of his feet and lifts his leg up and out into an arabesque. He should be embarrassed, doing naked ballet moves in the privacy of his loo but love makes people do incredibly stupid things and Sherlock is happy to oblige the stupidity for now. He stretches his arms out, one in front, one behind and watches his form, the steadiness of his movements, the precision of his body. John has made him better. John has made his body better.
Sherlock gives a single nod and it's all the confirmation John needs before he spins on his heel and takes off toward the woods just near the fire. It's dark and out of the eye of the rest of the campers and not too far away that they won't get lost and the perfect place to-
He didn't know what had happened to Harry. He knew she left. He knew she hadn't come back. But the reasons were vague at best. John had been hiding in his room when that final discussion had taken place. He couldn't make out any actual words. All there had been was yelling, a horrible resounding slap, and a door slamming. The next day, Harry was gone. When John asked his mother if she was coming back, the answer he got was a screaming match between his parents and an order to go to his room. He'd tried to call her and text her over and over, scared and confused as to where she'd gone. The only response he received was a text message that read: "Leave me alone, John. I'm safe. But I'm not coming back."
The water is warm and nice and calming and Sherlock arranges them both under the spray, helping John tip his head back under the water to wet his hair, naked and beautiful for Sherlock to gaze at and love every inch of, water trailing down every line and dip of firm muscle, water gathering in the blonde hairs at John's groin and dripping sensually down his hardening cock, the image almost pornographic and Sherlock has to look away.
And maybe if Sherlock hadn't been so deeply in grief, hadn't been wallowing in the closest he'd ever get to being held by John Watson, well.
"What's her name?" The boy takes a step closer, setting down the bail of hay he has in his hands, revealing a white t-shirt and washed out jeans.
John filled the bath with the warmest water he could without waiting for the boiler to finish, then turned to Sherlock, who sat on the covered toilet seat looking curious and miserable all at once.
John shakes his head, apparently perfectly at ease with this line of questioning. "I'm not," he admits. "Which is why I understand how important this is for you. But I don't want to hurry through this just because I'm not. I want
of all things. It was exhilarating and wonderful and maybe a little nerve-wracking and John felt totally out of his depth. He waited patiently and silently, afraid if he spoke the spell would be broken and Sherlock may stop spilling his secrets.
John was herded back to the curb as a black sedan pulled up, looking rather official and rather ominous and a cold sweat crept down the back of his neck as Lestrade swept open the door.
John didn't miss the quirk of Sherlock's lips. "Well done, John," Sherlock said. "You did your research I see?"
"I'd love to see you try," John murmurs smugly and Sherlock opens his eyes to find John rather close.
"It wasn't even close to hitting me," Sherlock shot back. "Addicts have notoriously slow reflexes and-"
John raised his eyebrows. "Really? You were just contemplating sucking me off and now you want to talk about someone else potentially doing it?"
Sherlock kept silent, not trusting himself to speak. He stuffed his laptop back into his bag and hoisted it over his shoulder. He took a deep breath and turned back to John who was looking very unsure of himself. "Problem?" he asked, succeeding in sounding indifferent.
The adrenaline was already rushing in his ears. A case. A real and true case. One that wasn't for the police. One that he didn't receive only half the information for.
Laying supine along the bed, long legs stretched out and relaxed, fingers steepled against his plush pouty lips, Sherlock Holmes looks as gorgeous and as lazy as John left him this morning, spread out along the comforter like some tired king completely exhausted from his day of doing absolutely nothing.
Sherlock had had to call a pop quiz just so he could sit and stare and think and deduce and…revel in John's deeply reddened face and clenched fists, doing his very best not to look at Sherlock again. It stirred something inside his belly, a small something coiling in his lower half, tightening as he tried to fight it. Another version of a flushed John Watson had blazed in his mind and Sherlock had bitten the inside of his lip.
John drags long pulls over him with his hand as he pops his mouth off and smirks up at Sherlock. "Are you going to come, Sherlock?" He murmurs in feigned innocence. "Will you come for me?"
All he knows is John's soft, recently licked lips are pressing to his in the gentlest of touches. His fingers on John's shoulder move, sliding up his neck and cupping his face, the cheek warm beneath his touch.
Not for the first time, Sherlock curses his inexperience in this area. Why can't he tell? Why doesn't he know if John likes him like that or not? Why is all of this so bloody confusing?
Sherlock clutches to his friend, shaking his head, fingers digging into cotton as large drops of water trickle down his cheeks.
And without waiting for a reply, John turned and bolted, something he was becoming quite familiar with and perfecting quite nicely. At least he had that going for him.
Because that's all John thought about these days: sex with Sherlock. Getting off with Sherlock. Touching Sherlock's nude body and having Sherlock touch his. It was like a drug, something John craved almost all the time, his inexperienced libido racing at top speed constantly for one man and one man alone. If he'd known his body would react like this once they started having sex, he would have bloody warned Sherlock.
Sherlock hesitates, looking unsure. Then slowly he trails his fingers down John's belly, touching his hand gently. "...Can I? I'd like to...try."
Flushing from the center of his chest to the tips of his ears, Sherlock grins imprudently down at the mobile in his hand, tracing the screen with the pad of his thumb over the words he's read so many times before and yet somehow still always make his stomach flutter. Even after four years, after so many similar texts on the first day of every semester of his university career, there is still something about receiving a text message from his partner, cheesy or otherwise, that always gets Sherlock feeling a bit light-headed and warm all over. He drags his finger along the screen, touching those loving words that, though not the first time he's received them, still seem to mean so very much. He swipes open the reply box and begins to tap out a reply when-
John only nodded and rolled over, snuggling into the blankets as Sherlock pulled the comforter over him. He kissed his temple then went back to his mother, who was hovering in the doorway. They closed the door silently and Sherlock blew out a breath.
“What?” Sherlock’s face was blank, which John knew meant that he was hiding thinly-veiled confusion.
Disclaimer that my knowledge of pharmacology is limited to high school chemistry, a 2am google search, and a very brief discussion with my third-year med best friend, which veered mainly into how much organic chemistry sucks.
“Hi.” She spoke up to him a little shyly. The words were lost to the music, but the movement of her lips was easily discernible.
Halloween may have been two weeks ago, but every time I read this ending I involuntarily reenact a ghost impression.
Patting the pockets of his coat, he’s appreciative that in amongst all of his haphazard thoughts, he’d somehow managed to retain sufficient presence of mind to put his phone in one of them before he’d left the laboratory. His mobile shows an unread message.
The bass continued to thud onwards like the pulsing heartbeat of the club. The possibly-crucial, possibly-trivial detail continued to elude the spotlight of his perceptions.
Sherlock looks at John and he sees the memory of a medical student, the precision and focus of a surgeon, the sincerity of a nurse and the quickness of a paramedic. He feels the impulse to demand John tell him what field he’s studying, to have his deductions validated and praised by this man.
It is also no secret to him that his playing the violin and being prone to extended bouts of silence are not his worst qualities, nor is the latter even entirely true. But for some unknown reason and with more fervour than he knows how to explain rationally, Sherlock
A comfortable tension has brought them together, only sharpening each time John has risen to attend to his responsibilities: a thread delicate as cotton pulled taut, ineffable as heavenly bodies caught in mutual orbit. Neither is eager to break the connection they’ve unwittingly formed. Trepidation makes itself known in the growing doubt that maybe this easy magic isn’t meant to last beyond the confines of an empty café on a hazy Saturday afternoon.
John smiles. Sherlock tries not to stare at the brilliance of it and reminds himself that he does indeed know how to speak.
Donovan levelled a calculating glance at him, the slightest hints of tightness around her eyes giving away her concern. “Here, then.” She held out her cup.
John wasn’t supposed to have been bait, just a sharp set of eyes and ears where he was needed. The killer was suspected to be female, average height, brunette, manicured fingernails, attractive but not unusually so. Not enough that someone whose area that was would remember her precisely, remember her as more than a pretty face – no, outwardly memorable only as much as any other woman in a bar wanting for you to buy her a drink.
That is, until a new barista is hired, who’s more than happy to work frequent mornings and who never forgets a pretty face or its accompanying name.
They walk in silence past the now-empty football fields and cross the footbridge under the university’s old-style yellow street lamps.
Sherlock considered for a moment, mentally rummaging through his memories of John’s clothing options. His leather jacket would work with the image, but would also hide his arms, something younger men with his physique would be unwilling to do. It would also give him the opportunity to retreat into it, inadvertently declaring his discomfort to the world.
Keeping his fingers moving quickly so as not to come under suspicion, he deletes the unsigned text from John’s sent messages immediately.
“Oh, I do hope you’ll reconsider, William. I promise I can be very persuasive.” The woman’s grin widened, seeming to glitter with the threat of thirty-two knives – or, perhaps, just one. And a blowtorch.
Because here, with his hands clutching the lapels of John’s coat, the scent of coffee grounds and baked goods sweet in his nose, his every sense entranced by the feeling of
“Any time,” John chuckled. He placed a tender kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, sparing only a moment for them to blink some form of their own bewildered, besotted morse code at each other before he reached for a wash cloth.
on you in a way that –” He paused for the briefest of moments, wherein his gaze flickered down and back up John’s frame. “– suggested interest of a kind deeper than is usually present between a worker and their customer.”
gone to think in silence for a bit. After– after exams, you know –” His tone changes abruptly as his gaze comes to rest directly on Sherlock. “Joseph, what are we doing? What’s– what’s going on?”
“I see you boys finally decided to show. Done with the domestic of the day?” Donovan said, typically coolly.
, I don’t doubt that. But you always keep these little – little escape hatches. Outs you can fall back on if things get too real or if someone might get too close. I adore being your friend but you know, this could be good for y–”
savoury kind.” Content with chuckling at her own joke, Molly doesn’t seem to mind that her customer only shrugs.
Hands paused mid-gesture, like a puppet suddenly finding itself without instruction, it appeared that Sherlock had finally taken stock of his friend. John’s face seemed frozen and distant, as if there were an invisible wall standing stoic between the two men. Sherlock was used to having the ability to decipher John’s mood from his body with a glance, so often did the other man allow himself to be seen candidly in Sherlock’s presence. He was used to noticing where boundaries would have been between ordinary people in their situation and stepping over them after a mere moment’s thought.
So now he waits in the café: later than he’d like to be, in a much longer line than he’s accustomed to, with a new barista. Sherlock sighs internally at the thought, feeling a physical craving for caffeine already. He steps forward.
Lestrade only grinned, turning and waving Donovan to join them. As she approached, John realised that contrary to his original assumption, she wasn’t dressed in plain, casual clothes like Lestrade and the other detective, but in a long-sleeved, emerald green dress – which, upon further observation, he realised wasn’t really a dress, but a shirt and shorts in one. He glanced towards her feet, thinking about the possibility of an on-foot chase before the night was over; she was, sensibly, wearing flat shoes.
All of a sudden, John understood. He placed his empty teacup atop his plate and put them aside on the bed. “Sherlock, listen to me.” He clasped his hands together in his lap and sat straighter so as to be as level with his flatmate as possible. “I’m sorry to remind you of something you loathe, but not everything is clever. Not everything is as brilliant as you wish it would be.” He swallowed, knowing full well that both of them were thinking of Moriarty and what Sherlock had told him of the conversation on Bart’s roof.
“Yeah. He’s always like that,” comes Mike’s voice, drifting after him several moments later. It is followed by the door snapping shut.
Unfortunately, the mind he had spent his whole life cultivating so as to be relied on in stressful situations was mysteriously blank. He hadn’t even the presence of mind to scold himself for leaving the photograph in such an obvious place. In fact, he had exactly two words stuttering through his head.
An overhead light flickers not too far in his peripheral vision and he has a distant desire to fling a heavy tome at it.
The sound John made deep in his throat could only have been described as a growl, his eyes narrowing into slits.
Nodding, John followed his flatmate downstairs, calling a quick though sincere farewell to Mrs. Hudson. A cab magically appeared, as they were wont to do whenever Sherlock desired one.
“Three?” John’s head tilted along with the question. If Sherlock had been less focused on the case, he would have marvelled at how open John was, especially given the recency of their conflict. “You think it was her who drugged me?”
Just the thought of losing John made cases with serial killers less compelling – what was becoming of him?
Glad that he’d turned to retrieve his coat, Sherlock clenches his eyes shut for just a second. John sounds unconvinced. But Sherlock is committed now: he might as well see the thing through to its possibly-bitter end.
“Go forth and fend off the groping, freak.” Donovan’s parting words were accompanied by a mock-salute.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.” Pausing an arm’s reach from John, he cycles through the details once more.
“So what if they do? How do unfounded rumours conceived by small-minded imbeciles have anything to do with John?”
With a sigh and the momentary flicker of her eyes closing and reopening, Donovan stepped closer to him.
He sat up as slowly as he could, levering himself upright with both hands braced firmly on the mattress beside him. His headache lifted slightly, just enough to think a little clearer, now that the noise that had disturbed him had ceased.
Sherlock’s lips twist at the crude phrase. His mind feels like it’s spinning, hovering on the cusp of something long hidden.
Not his room, certainly. The bed was too wide, hedonistically luxurious in the pure comfort it provided. That explained the non-existence of his expected pains.
John turns his head and sees their hands touch over the cup. He can’t decide if they’re together or not, but feels like he’s intruding on something as they continue to exchange brisk conversation.
Sherlock’s mouth hangs open as he wears a blank expression. He replays the rest of the evening in his mind. Confusion. Worry. Surprise. Joy. Bliss. Contentment. Concern. Regret. It had ended with him alone in his bed, staring at the ceiling and willing his mind to empty.
He blinked languidly, sure that there were vital pieces of evidence still evading him. An absentminded shifting of his legs assured him that he was still wearing trousers, however the woollen jumper he had worn the day prior lay folded at the foot of the bed. In its place was the old t-shirt he usually wore to sleep in. His shoes were placed neatly on the floor.
“Uh – yes. Sure. Please. That would be nice.” Sherlock’s nodding. Why can’t he stop nodding? He hands over his card.
Sherlock rubs his eyes. Inhales. Exhales. Then he grabs some clean clothes and strides to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
: the study of how a drug at a certain concentration affects an organism at the site of action, with respect to the drug’s binding with a receptor.
But then he thought of Sherlock himself, bringing him tea earlier and looking – in an endearingly bizarre manner – tentative. He thought of
Squeezing his way through the outskirts into the thick of the crowd was a challenge in itself, which he soon realised could be achieved by moving in time with the music, rather than simply trying to elbow through gaps between clusters of people. They tended not to like that. Besides, he preferred not to do more damage to his shoes than was strictly necessary.
. Known, even though he trusted that John hadn’t taken his eyes off of his glass for more than a split second, even though John had muttered that the bartender was male while his drink was being poured. John liked to sound in control and sure of himself; his voice rarely shook in much higher pressure situations than this, but even when it did, it never sounded this unsteady. Lestrade had given him an acquiescing nod a moment after the words had filled the unmarked police car and Sherlock’s head had snapped up, then Sherlock fled into the crowded bar across the street, a hive-like intensity to his painfully singular focus.
“Er, we’re sorry, mate.” The man spoke directly into the detective’s face and it felt like every cell in Sherlock’s brain started simultaneously screaming at him to move as far away from this stranger’s breath as possible. “Me wife’s a bit of a fan, y’know.” He inclined his head in her direction.
He hadn’t thought this far. He glances up at the barista and his gaze catches on ocean-blue eyes before it has a chance to reach the name tag.
His right hand continues to shake all through the walk to his first lecture; the tremor persists even after he finishes the cup’s contents and disposes of it. At least it’s quite a good coffee.
“It would help us blend in and probably give you a better chance to look for anyone suspicious. I know –” he added, seeing that Sherlock was about to interject, “I know it’s a lot to take in, even for you. It would be too much to observe every detail and deduce every woman in all this chaos.”
They walk in silence a little further, leaving campus and being greeted by the intermittent flurry of restaurants serving dinner and cars passing too quickly. The occasional stone tumbles down the street under their absentminded steps.
There’s a moment of silence, but no question is forthcoming. John stares, tamping down his amusement like coffee grounds.
Sherlock blinked and shook his head. “Unimportant. So, since your video showed just how much of a buffoon you are with makeup, the topic of this one will be eyeliner techniques for amateurs. Clearly it will be an invaluable resource for people like you.”
“After a little bit of time, of course,” Sherlock added quickly, seeing that Rosie would find it overbearing and overenthusiastic of her to ask him so soon.
But he sighed and patted his lap, resolving to give it his best shot. She perched there, the way she always did.
“Just, just something in the hallway,” John finally answered, also averting eye contact. Sherlock was so smart, he’d be sure to figure out why John was acting the way he was. “Hey, don’t you need goggles? That could be dangerous.”
Evidently his viewers commented the same things on John’s video, making sure the boy knew what Sherlock was really like. The internet had chosen his soulmate. With a sigh, he logged onto Tumblr.
“Oh, that. I found that in the hallway. I think … I think it’s from the wall. Y’know, the —” he cut off, seeing Sherlock nod. “Yeah, my teammates made those. It’s sweet, and all, but y’know …” He cut off again, turning redder than Sherlock, whose face had gone slack and shy once again.
Leo seemed to flush at that, but held out his hand to shake Sherlock’s own firmly. “Likewise.” Sherlock’s warm but icy eyes scanned him.
Sherlock had taken to wearing John’s rugby jacket and going to all the practices. (Which he did anyway, but now he could sit where John could see him.)
And the idea of Sherlock Holmes actually loving him too was just unrealistic. Sherlock Holmes was a thing that happened in John’s dreams, the dreams where you wake up with a tingling feeling from the imaginary contact that felt so real but was all in your head.
John exhaled and stepped back from the door. “You should probably just come in, I suppose,” he said in a low voice. “When she says a bit, she really means another half an hour.”
John just couldn’t keep the grin off his face any more. He practically skipped in place, before bouncing over to where Sherlock was standing, standing on his tiptoes, and kissing him on the cheek, before starting down the hallway.
“I am,” Mycroft sighed, finally bringing his head up to shoot a sharp glance at Sherlock, “technically speaking.”
? It was disgusting) would get popular people teased and questioned, no, they’d want to avoid that. The Sharpie was almost out of ink. Age, not overuse. It had dried up from being in someone’s backpack for a little over …  a year? No, two years.
It really did make Sherlock happy, seeing his daughter so plainly enamored with an honest, sweet boy.
Sherlock was struck by how enchanted he was with this man when he smiled. His face lit up, and the only word his brilliant mind could think of was
Sherlock broke away first, blushing furiously and leaving John’s head spinning. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and intertwined their fingers, partly because he thought he might actually fall over, but mostly because he’d thought so much about finally holding his hand.
They’d already gotten started with the lab in chem, meaning his coming in late wasn’t a big deal, thankfully. He just nodded at the teacher and mouthed a ‘sorry,’ then headed for the desk that he and his partner shared in the spacious room.
“Um…” Sherlock looked around, searching for an easy answer that wouldn’t raise any questions, “… lucky guess?”
Sherlock barely heard him, but he stood up quickly and grabbed his papers, rushing out of the room. He shoved open the heavy doors, bursting into the bright, stone halls of the kingdom’s crown jewel, scrambling away from the study as fast as possible. His fussy, ill-fitting shoes irritated him to no end as he sped through the corridors, taking huge gulps of the clean air. He ran up a sprawling staircase, scrambling to make it to his room before Mycroft called him back.
John allowed himself to be swept up in the banter, poking, and constant lack of space between himself and Sherlock. (It may have been a bit awkward for him at first, but it grew into more and more of a comfortable proximity as time wore on.)
His breath gradually grew shallower as he let his doubts and fears take the place of his usual grim resignation. He clenched his clammy hands into fists in a weak attempt to cease their shaking.
“John, pass me a flower,” he ordered. John obliged, and Sherlock slipped it into the braid, then stepped back as the kettle started whistling.
John automatically put on a winning smile. He was so happy just to be next to Sherlock, he could have shot through the ceiling with excitement.
Sherlock strolled from the bedroom into the kitchen at that moment, putting on the kettle and then the coffee maker.
Rosie brushed the strands falling out of her braid out of her face and swallowed the bread she was chewing before replying. “Leo.”
He allowed himself a moment to catch his breath, staring up at the ceiling. The rising and falling of his thin chest slowed until his breathing returned to normal.
John’s noise of surprise was stifled as he slipped his own arms around Sherlock’s neck, trying to let his mind capture every detail: how Sherlock’s hands felt like they were burning through his shirt, and how the curly hair at the nape of his neck was so easy to tangle his fingers into, how John’s nose squished a little bit against Sherlock’s cheek.
And Sherlock did something he’d never thought would be a result of this ordeal: he smiled. He smiled, and wrote back to the person.
And John was torn between watching the glances Rosie and Leo exchanged or watching Sherlock watch them; both were entertaining.
“And today I’m going to be doing Sherlock’s makeup,” John blurted, giving Sherlock a reassuring smile that he hoped said
“Ah.” Sherlock got up from his chair and held out his hand to the teen. “You must be Leo. I’m Sherlock. We’ve heard a lot about you.”
He thought about telling him what he didn’t already know: about how stupid he still felt for letting his guard down the previous night, about the photograph and Sherlock’s too-recent breach of trust. He imagined that Lestrade would simply tell him that he should’ve known what he’d gotten into when he realised what Sherlock was like and continued to work with him, live with him, be friends with him. He imagined he’d have no idea why Sherlock took the photograph, but he’d probably say something unhelpful and even more unsettling than the issue itself, such as
Their eyes find each other and Sherlock’s are searching for an answer he knows the other pair does not hold. Does he want him to say it aloud? Does he want him to break both of their hearts, and demolish any remnants of hope for a future in which they meet again? Would it be easier for John to be with Mary that way? Easier to sleep next to her at night if he can fool himself into believing that Sherlock is off in the world on some noble adventure, fighting criminals and ensuring the triumph of goodness?
Standing a short distance away from the counter, with the air of someone perusing the drinks menu fixed high on the wall, Sherlock takes a chance to watch John. He finds himself entranced by the barista’s graceful hands.
, John thinks with a frown. At least, he hopes they’re not. Not that he really cares about strangers’ love lives, of course.
Sherlock found that watching John’s face as he worked himself was exquisite. He started slow, evidently still self-conscious, but then the sensation and the realisation of
He shoved all thoughts of his best friend from his mind. John had been so worried about him just the day before — and a couple of hours ago, even after he had discovered Sherlock’s latest deception — but now it seemed that he hadn’t a care for the safety of his flatmate. Had the anger finally set in? Had he realised that he didn’t care about Sherlock as much as he’d thought?
She directs a gentle smile at him before sweeping her pile neatly aside and leaning the broom against the doorframe behind her.
It occurred to him that he had begun to thoroughly despise this case and the damage it had inflicted on his faculties.
When John next managed to reopen his eyes, following an extended period of attempting to get his breath back, he was blessed with the sight of his flatmate reclining at the other end of the bathtub. Hand slick with what he assumed was fresh conditioner and the remnants of John’s own come, Sherlock was working himself at a pace just short of feverish. His eyes were heavily lidded and his head tilted upwards, exposing the enticing column of his alabaster neck. A vein jumped in it, the blood within pounding along to the symphony the two men had unwittingly begun to create together.
It's been a while, so I'd really like to thank everyone who's sticking with this story. You're the best and I love you.
seemed to sink in, and the pace of his hand increased. Hungry eyes drank in the sight as he flicked his wrist just so whenever his hand approached the head of his cock.
That it was preposterous that this stranger was sitting across from him, this woman he’d never seen, intruding on their nightly ritual.
Sherlock’s fingertips came together under his chin as he arranged his thoughts. “Lestrade called three nights ago, saying that a man had been found outside Ignition bar with a fatal stab wound to the back of the neck, which had severed the brain stem. The letter M had been carved into his chest, post-mortem and haphazardly, with a knife – something easy to conceal. Hard to tell if it was due to unplanned rage and a subsequent desire to leave a kind of signature, or a violent urge becoming unrestrained while performing a preconceived act.”
Closing his eyes, he rested his head only briefly on the headboard behind him before he remembered Sherlock’s mobile. It was only when the man wished to completely immerse himself in his thoughts that he was ever not in the same room as the device. John crawled to the edge of the bed and rummaged in the top drawer to retrieve it.
John shrugs a little, his steps slowing. “It was empty and I signed out earlier than I left, boss won’t mind.” He takes a breath as they finally reach each other, the tiniest of smiles pulling at his lips. “I wasn’t sure I’d catch you. I was trying to think of the fastest way to search floor by floor.”
Sherlock moves to the side and waits, resisting the primal urge to check his silent and motionless mobile phone.
“Your point is perfectly comprehensible, but misguided. I don’t purposefully build these ‘outs’ for myself, it just happens that in this case I had previously lied to John and it resulted in negative consequences I hadn’t foreseen.” Sherlock’s tone is level and matter-of-fact.
Sherlock knows this could go awry in an instant. The words are audacious, and his forced disinterest is at striking odds with the fascination he feels for this man. Frankly, he’s typing nonsense on his laptop solely in a bid to occupy his hands and let out some of the manic energy currently flaring within, in response to the prospects before him.
Distantly, he recognises the adrenaline of standing on a precipice. Feels like he could all too easily become addicted to someone caring about him this much.
Lestrade let out a long-suffering sigh. "Look, I might be able to sneak you in the back in a few minutes. I can't let the others see you, alright?"
. And now here he was, lying beneath the most beautiful human being he'd ever laid eyes on, while said gorgeous creature told him he loved him.
He floats through practice, lovingly petting Balthazar, sighing contentedly as they trot around the course.
to work with. Is this really it? Is it really over already? After one single beautiful night together, this is how it ends?
"You were so good for me, love," John groans softly. "Watching you come was one of the sexiest things I've ever seen."
And just like that, the few inches of space between them are suddenly unacceptable. He wants to demand John not say such things like that. He wants to offer a glare and a pout and furrowed brow to express how utterly infuriating it is to have his lover stand there and say such incredibly perfect things to him and not touch him. How completely maddening it is to lay here, willing and raring and then to have the breath completely knocked from his body as John admires him from above, robbing Sherlock even a fighting chance at responding with something resembling words.
Sherlock doesn't know what to say. He hadn't meant to scare John. He'd been scared, but allowing John to be fearful? No, that hadn't been his intention in the least.
John almost chuckles but a crackle breaks out at the base of his spine and he's suddenly almost there. "Yes, Sherlock, fuck, yes I'm close…so…close…."
"Thank you," Sherlock nods his gratitude and ducks his head as Angelo gives him a knowing smirk, instead turning his attention back to his date.
William beamed at him, then turned to Sherlock, marched right over and gave him the nicest hug a father could give his son. And to John's shock and awe, Sherlock hugged him right back. Like this was normal. Familiar. Like they were a family full of hugging and loving characters.
John swung his head around to look at Link, who must have been the happiest drunk he'd ever met. John was quite pleased to have Link as his drinking buddy tonight, since Mike had insisted on being sober to keep an eye on them. Mike was clearly worried John may do something stupid.
John stared incredulously at him. "Sherlock, what the bloody hell is going on? Why aren't you staying?"
It was a filthy demand that would have made Sherlock laugh ten years ago, but now...now it made him faster. Now it made him desperate to comply and eager to couple and goddamnit if he wasn't inside John in the next few seconds he may explode, or John could disappear and this could all be some horrible bad dream. He scrambled for the lube in his bedside table, flipping the cap open urgently like his life depended on it.
, needing to know every detail about John Watson. John occupies the room above Sherlock's and yet his presence is everywhere in their flat, all over the kitchen and sitting room and the loo. But not in an irritating way. In a nice, comforting way. Like it wouldn't be home without John in it.
He doesn't know how much time has passed as he attempts to focus, sight only seeming to get worse as he stands as still as he can, everything in his body lurching at any tiny movement. Nausea washes over him every time he blinks, everything tilting just slightly when he opens his eyes.
John reaches for him before Sherlock can hesitate with uncertainty and brings their lips together in a soft welcoming kiss. He hadn't noticed the tension he's been holding in his shoulders, only realizing it when it flows freely out of his body at the touch of John's mouth to his after two horrible days away. Sherlock hums, grabbing greedily and twisting needy fingers into blue fabric. John giggles. "Good morning, Sherlock."
"You!" Sherlock yelled right back. "You and your lies! First you pretend to want me, claiming you want to be with me. Then after weeks of lies, you finally come out with the truth, stating you don't want to have sex with me and tell me to leave. I'm fine with it being over John, really, I'm not so pathetic that you must coddle me after breaking up with me. It's been five days and look; I've survived without you. So don't show up here pretending to be sorry. I haven't heard from you in said days, so you clearly aren't
"I wish I understood," John murmurs. "I wish I understood why, you know? I think it would make this easier for me. But I know you hate talking about it. Just… if one day… if one day you feel comfortable, will you tell me why? Because I… I would have
"Alright my darlings, us old people need to sleep," Mrs. Holmes yawns enormously and smiles at each of her children and their guests, eyes resting lastly on Sherlock for a moment longer, brows creasing in confusion as he stares thunderously back at her. "Sherlock?"
He pulled it gingerly over his head, straightening the cuffs of the button down underneath it and rolled the sleeves up to his elbows. He gave himself a once over in the mirror, noting his still damp hair and shrugged. He didn't have time to dry it. He was far too anxious.
"I…-" the rugby player starts and stops, giant eyes falling away from Sherlock's and sweeping down to himself, shifting the item he's got clutched to his chest that the genius boy is only noticing now, nodding down to it meaningfully. "I...I got your Valentine."
"Have you ever dislocated a joint?" Mike grins knowingly, making Sherlock's heart slow a bit. If Mike is smiling, that's got to be a good sign, right? He wouldn't smile like some lunatic if this was some horrible fatal injury. "It hurts like a motherfucker. You don't have any interest in moving, trust me on that."
"Who the hell was that?" John snapped, more then a little irritated that his plans to ravage Sherlock were derailed by some random woman.
John pursed his lips trying not to laugh. "Fair enough. Okay, so what am I to do for your…umm…investigation?"
"The cost will be covered, John," Sherlock murmured in his ear as Mycroft sashayed to the kitchen with his parents, leaving the two of them alone.
He's barely aware of his hand dropping his half empty cup. He's barely aware of Greg asking if he's alright. He's barely aware of Molly eyeing him suspiciously.
"Come on!" Seb cackles, as though he and John are in on this together, waiting for the professional rugby player to join in on the fun of grinding Sherlock down to nothing. "He's a manipulative little prick. How much did he get you for? Little freak probably had-"
Squeezing his eyes shut for ten long seconds and thinking steadily about Mycroft, Sherlock blows out a breath and wills himself to relax, his libido thankfully falling silent at the repulsive thought of his older brother and settling beneath his skin unobtrusively, a low hum still simmering through his veins, a harmless reminder of what his inner-self is
Feeling off-balance, John took a chance and changed the subject as Sherlock continued not to look at him. "Are you going to the mixer tonight?"
"Hey, that's no longer my job now that we have you." Greg points a finger at him, biting his bottom lip on a stupid smile.
It keeps him from curling forward into a pathetic, sobbing mess and possibly spending the night on this porch.
Greg laughs. "Well, at least this part is easy, yeah? You know how to do this in your sleep." He nods toward the field up ahead and John can't help but grin, the well-known rush of adrenaline pumping hotly through his system.
"Bury yourself a little more under the covers and they'll never know you're here," John whispers, laughing as Sherlock gives him one last solid glare before tossing the blankets all the way over his head.
"God, yes," Sherlock babbles, rocking his hips up to emphasize his plea. "After that little fellatio performance of yours, I think you owe me."
The bartender laughed again. "Oh, just you wait. Enjoy!" He sashayed off toward the other end of the bar, assisting the rest of the men sitting there.
," he gasps again before he finally realizes John has pulled off and the flurry of sensitivity in his belly has eased itself away from the edge.
Another question. Is that all they were doing? Snogging? Or were they going to go further? Did John want Sherlock's virginity? Because Sherlock would happily give it up to John. Right now. Today. Why wouldn't he want to be with his boyfriend like that-
Greg sat down heavily in the chair across from him at their small kitchen table. "So, what're you going to do?"
John was grinning. "You are sitting as stiff as a statue and you look terribly alarmed. Did I hurt your feelings, Sherlock Holmes?"
every inch John has exposed and somehow that's absolutely all John can handle as his own fingers itch to touch. Sliding a hand up into inky, soft, still damn curls, John pulls that gorgeous mouth back down to his, ignoring the weightless protest of Sherlock's observation ending and tugging a pouty lower lip into his mouth.
"Nothing," John shakes his head with a grin. "I just wasn't aware that you owned a pair of trousers that weren't perfectly fitted and posh as hell."
"We will meet you there," John says with a shove to his teammate's chest and a wave toward the exit. "We need to get dressed."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Of course I heard you. You weren't quiet about it. Now answer my question."
He didn't want to give up. Even going in blind, having absolutely no idea if he had a shot in hell, John really couldn't let this go. He couldn't just give up on it. Not on Sherlock. Not ever.
Leaning back in his chair and closing his eyes, already regretting ending the conversation, John settles deeper in his chair, a soft euphoria settling in his bones.
"Yeah, that's about enough there, Greg," Molly cut him off sharply. She turned to John. "We have an address. Go see him."
He has no interest in John's apologies. They are hollow and unfeeling and don't mean half the things Sherlock wishes they did.
Every jumbled word and shallow thrust of John's hips tells Sherlock one beautiful thing, excited little bursts rippling along his skin as John tugs just right at his curls and he sinks down as far as he can, burying his nose in the hairs at the base of John's erection, simultaneously burying that cock in his mouth and without thinking twice, he does the last thing he'd read about.
cold, his blonde hair taking on a chestnut color as it darkens with rain water, matting it along his skull as his jersey wilts against his back beneath the raging weather, but still the blond looks strong, shoulders kicked back and ready, fist clenching and unclenching at his sides, gaze alert and searching, clearly ready to fight even in the worst conditions.
is not sitting well in John Watson's stomach. He burrows further into the blankets, already on his way to feeling epically sorry for himself and hoping desperately that last night hadn't scared his lover away completely.
He doesn't remember the day the army called a year later. He doesn't remember looking wide-eyed at Sherlock and saying '
Sherlock shrugged. "I've got several ideas, but I'll wait to narrow them down before I tell you. I need more data." Sherlock glanced up as if disappointed. "Nothing else is on at the moment so I thought it was about time to indulge my curiousity about Professor Limon. Nobody can be that boring, can they? Normally something comes up on my first attempt."
he's being played by his chemistry partner with her kind little face and giant heart and worry for all things science and as a scientist himself he knows she is playing to his soul, tugging on his heart strings that the poor science teams need to go to these fairs and showcase their talents and get into good schools and be huge successes in Chemistry and Biology and
From this close, Sherlock could see just how blown his pupils were, and large his body was, calculating quickly just what he would need to do to maneuver himself out of this position, when something in the man's free hand caught his eye.
"Oh, it's so obvious," Greg laughs, thumping Paul on the back with the palm of his hand. "Sorry mate but nobody talks that much about a lecture about
"I know this is really scary, and I know you don't fully understand what's going on inside of you. But I hope tonight was a wake-up call, and I hope you're going to stop fighting yourself."
"Dunno," John said, trying to shrug nonchalantly. He didn't want to talk about Sherlock. With anyone. For some reason, the conversation they'd had felt private. Like a secret the two of them shared. He didn't want to destroy that illusion by telling someone. Even if it hadn't ended the way he would have liked. And how in god's name would he be able to explain Sherlock's... observations? Mike wouldn't understand. John wasn't even sure if he truly understood.
"Alright," Sherlock agrees readily, pressing his lips to John's temple. "But I'm not tackling or being tackled by anyone and I refuse to participate in any muddy activities."
She does have free time, Sherlock knows, where the ranch hands let her run out in the open field. But she's a pain to wrangle and Sherlock did wonder if that hindered the team from spending time with her.
"Are you okay?" John asked softly, his cheeks still twinged pink from the cold, his features soft with worry.
John grins. Like that would ever stop Sherlock of all people. "So? Dogs bite people sometimes and I know plenty of families who have them."
John giggles. "Of course! I hardly ever go to these things, but Greg suggested I do and the rest of the team is going so I figure I'd better go. Keep the lads in line and all that."
But Sherlock wasn't far. He was here. Right here. Breathing and murmuring and so close John could taste his scent on his tongue, hear his heart beating in his chest, a steady rhythm that couldn't even begin to set pace with John's racing pulse thundering in his neck. Which sat only a breath away from Sherlock's lips. Which John was seemingly unable to take his eyes off of.
The pressure is slowly loosening, Sherlock's muscles giving to the intrusion. He rocks back experimentally.
Grinning against that delicate porcelain-like skin, John growls in response, "What if I wanted to be worrying about you?"
"Yes, I can only assume that didn't feel the best," Sherlock murmured. "You need to go back to your room, John. Now."
"You guys are no longer invited to nights out if you act like this the whole time. There are two other people here," Mike said in annoyance.
His cunning response, however, promptly dies in his throat, the color in his face draining along with it as all of his panic from earlier comes roaring back in full force, shaking its head at Sherlock's complete and utter stupidity.
"It's nothing, really," Sherlock mutters, suddenly panicked that this gift is completely ridiculous, that John might find it silly or, god forbid
"Oh, I don't care about you," Mike waves his hand dismissively; though the bite in his words is tempered by the somewhat sloppy wink he drops in John's direction. "My Pong Partner is here and I need to get to continuing my undefeated status immediately."
"I-… I'm not hungry," Sherlock replies, a bit snappish if he's being honest, the irritation of losing John's attention to a bunch of nasty rugby brutes stinging a bit more than Sherlock had thought it would. "Thanks, anyway."
Sherlock shook his head from side to side. "They asked 'bout…'bout the perty blond feller… but I lied, John. I-…"
toward the front door, Sherlock Holmes huffs a sigh of annoyance and shoots a glare at his university flatmate and current travel companion in one last feeble attempt to seem completely indifferent to this entire trip. He's probably failing miserably seeing as the butterflies in his stomach are currently soaring around his insides at the very sight of the house standing before him, but the solid effort is necessary. "It's just a cottage," he grumbles much less harshly than he'd meant to, "it's our winter home."
"We just want to know everything's okay," Mike tacks on, and John isn't sure he's ever seen his teammates look so truly alarmed as they do now, all offering their help so selflessly while John swirls around his own head like a self-absorbed arsehole.
The curly-haired boy had given him no indication one way or the other before he'd rolled himself out of bed and schlepped off to the showers, hand clutching his head along with a low moan of agony.
"What?" John snaps, stomach flipping in panic, certain he already knows the answer but needing to ask the question anyway. "What does that mean?"
John gives his hand a squeeze. "Only with Dolly, Sherlock. And you'll get there. It takes practice."
Placing his hands atop Sherlock's, John slowly carefully unlatches his grip and laces his fingers between Sherlock's. "Sorry," he murmurs, even though he very much is
"Why don't you stop making his decisions for him and let him in on the conversation that's been battling on inside your head?"
By way of answering, Sherlock doesn't and instead makes his way up the snow-covered footpath to the front door, insides squirming with anticipation of what awaits him on the other side, the heat of the house practically radiating off the heavy grey stones that make up the exterior, tiny white lights dangling off along the triangle topped front, simple yet elegant as always, framed in white by recently fallen snow laying evenly along the rooftop and on the ground surrounding the house. He hasn't been here in a
It's a bit tougher to get out the door after that, and even harder not to let panic seep into John's swirling mind as Sherlock Holmes gives him one last heart-wrenchingly beautiful smile as his bids him a nice day, stepping out of the room and out of John's sight before the rugby player can change his mind.
"Like you? Want you? Going out of my mind falling for you? Yes." John's face is so open, so sincere. "So much, Sherlock."
It wasn't spoken of. Not directly. It was simply fact that men do not... do that. Men do not lie with other men. Men do not enjoy other men in that way. Men are not attracted to other men. It was bad. Sinful. Wrong. All so very, very wrong. Illegal even. No, boys marry girls. Boys do not marry boys.
"Because I can't get a read on him!" John exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. "And I have to see him every day, so if he shoots me down-"
"He didn't do anything, did he?" John all but barks, knowing how harsh he sounds and unable to contain it. The beast within roars its approval.
He watches as Mary scoots as close to John as possible, clips on the helmet Sherlock had worn what seemed like years ago now, and melts her body around the captain.
The intended purpose of throwing John into a secluded area was to make sure he was alright. This was a rather welcome side-affect.
When John had finally called it a night, Sherlock had crawled over to John's bed, laid his head in John's lap and hummed contentedly.
"What are you, prude? You've been moaning all fucking night, practically begging for it. Come on," the growling voice came again.
But John hadn't been about to let that go. He'd all but forced Sherlock to admit it because it was everything John had wanted for so long and to be this close to it... John wasn't about to pass that up.
Sherlock let out a loud, belly laugh, shaking his head adoringly at John and grinning from ear to ear. "Bed, I think," he chuckled, reaching for John's hand. "I don't think the editor of the school newspaper sucking face with one of his writers in public would look so good."
John snorted. "I know," he said softly. "That's my point; you were happy. So happy to be moving on with your life, to be done with our crap school and on to London and uni where I knew without a doubt you would thrive."
John had almost dropped his tea in his lap as that bomber jacket-clad man had scanned the small shop, laid eyes on him and produced a knowing smile. John bit down hard on his lip, anticipation thrumming in his gut, never one to shy away from approaching or being approached by a potential date, especially one that looked like
Sherlock isn’t listening. He opens the door, mutters, “Don’t take my landlady too seriously,” and in one fluid motion, draws John into the foyer, shuts the door behind them, and finally kisses him with all the passion he feels.
“The killer has been careful.” Sherlock frowned, and John knew that he was both pleased and irritated by this. “Long brown hair has been found, which the police cannot identify as being from anyone in their system. No traces of their fingerprints or blood and no substantial amount of skin cells under the victims’ fingernails. They were unremarkable enough for the security guards at both venues to have no recollection of them, but persuasive enough to entice two people to leave with them into a side street.”
“Your name doesn’t start with an M.” It wasn’t really a question, but John’s inflection rose towards the statement’s end, asking for clarification.
John blinks a few times before his brain catches up with his ears. “Is that it?” he calls to the other man’s back.
” John enunciated with spine-tingling clarity, “tell me that you found it lying around or you only did so recently – it was on the bottom, sticking out from under a pile of things, one of which was a dentist’s report. We both know when the last time you went to the dentist was.”
John chuckles to himself, shaking his head gently at how wonderfully animated Sherlock is. How much he clearly loves learning, chases academic knowledge for the pure sake of knowledge.
to understand? The disyllabic is spelt exactly as it is said but still, he receives cups with untidy scrawls reading all things from Cheryl to Shylock. (The latter wounds him so spectacularly that he resolves never to step foot into that particular shop again.)
Their eyes lock and John feels like he could cry. He thinks Sherlock looks like he might offer out a palm to shake his hand, but sees the man change his mind and embrace him softly instead. He’s glad for the intimacy of the contact. Even just this once.
, before he feels a soul-deep compulsion to bring up her favourite television drama or Mrs. Turner next door.
Irene glances at a spot of mud beside her right shoe, then fixes him with a piercing stare that doesn’t match her softened tone. “Shame. But recent heartbreak won’t get you out of telling your best friend what happened, Holmes.”
Sparing a glance in a half-hearted search for John behind the couple’s heads, he turned on his heel and began to shuffle back to his previous spot. Without warning, a hand grabbed his wrist and he was unceremoniously yanked forward a few paces. The offending hand belonged to the woman he had thought timid and unimposing; her smiling face now loomed before his with unanticipated confidence.
Sherlock almost crumbles at that, then swallows forcefully. When he speaks, his voice is small. “You knew I’d be here?”
“Strawberry,” John affirmed, suddenly sounding exhausted. Figuring Sherlock deserved to spare the effort, he added: “And tea, please.”
onto a takeaway cup. The man seems to think it amusing, briefly showing the script to him with an unconcerned shrug and a possibly-flirtatious grin. Misguided. Idiotic.
– Sherlock narrows his eyes momentarily at the unfamiliar face and plain name – shares a glance with the woman on the other register. (
The two men meet eyes over the counter as Sherlock approaches. Both fail quite spectacularly to temper their matching grins.
Sherlock grumbles about the stupid phrase from the moment he wakes the next morning, all through the breakfast forced upon him (Mrs. Hudson knows he’d neglected to eat yesterday morning: there’s no hiding anything from her), and up until he pushes the coffee shop’s door open.
It astounded him to no end that in all of Sherlock’s immense intelligence, with his deductions and predictions, the man thought it was unlikely that he was the killer’s ultimate target. John tried not to dwell on the man’s tendency to be his own downfall – and how he had been already, more than once.
. Honestly, Plato satirised the whole idea of “naturalism” in naming, which is the theory Sherlock talks about liking here. Like much of Plato’s discussion of how he thought language works, the whole
“Your drugging was unrelated,” Sherlock said vaguely, giving the impression, as he so often did, that he knew more than he was willing to share. He avoided John’s eyes, finishing his tea, casting the cup aside and staring at his perfectly rounded fingernails.
The barista continues to stare at him, eyebrows drawing together a little while he holds a marker and cup in his hands. A tiny wrinkle appears between the man’s brows. Some strands of hair fall over the stranger’s forehead, and Sherlock tells himself that he’s obviously imagining their twinkling in the morning light – golden as dawn rays over the bubbling froth of the seashore.
, John mentally continues, chuckling under his breath. A moment later he holds a paper bag out for Sherlock to take.
At John’s prodding, Sherlock told him a little about his brother and the games and experiments they used to occupy their time with as children. That they’d almost ruined their father’s yacht pretending to be pirates caught in a heated duel, and been banned from the gardener’s shed after an unfortunate minor explosion. He quite happily admitted that Mycroft was now a stiff government official who liked to think he was incapable of logical infallibility and wouldn’t know a sense of humour unless it grew on him like an additional appendage. Even then, he’d likely throw a fit and get his secretary to arrange its immediate removal.
Speed-walking away from the café last Saturday, his first instinct had been to shove the croissant into his mouth with one hand and pull out his phone to text Irene with the other.
“My name is not Joseph,” Sherlock says, his voice level. He lowers his hands and finally opens his eyes, tracking the bewilderment on John’s face. “I lied to you. My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
He thinks of the Woman. He thinks of the jealous glint in John’s expression when he’d happened upon Irene undressed in Sherlock’s presence; how his dangerous streak had glimmered just below the affable veneer, like the tip of a shark’s fin skimming the ocean’s tranquil surface.
His face is so open that Sherlock pauses for a moment. Holding his phone upright in offering, his eyebrows are raised. This man trusts enough in the judgment of Mike, whom he surely hasn’t had contact with since their university days, to willingly lend his mobile to a complete stranger. A mobile phone is typically an item of such personal attachment – with the contact information of loved ones, messages, photographs, various other individualised details – that Sherlock finds this act particularly telling. This man seems as much of an open book as it is possible for another person to be.
John carefully repositioned his thumb and middle finger to clasp around the base of his cock, wanting to both cease the further flow of blood to the area, and retain that which was already pulsing there.
Irene, the smug dollop, has never had this problem. She seems to think that something about her posture, her tone of voice, her very air, demands attention enough for any barista to complete the task without a problem. Never mind, Sherlock thinks, how utterly common a name
“The killer’s victims have had similar physical attributes: short or medium-length dark hair; tall – at least 175 centimetres; average build and fairly pale skin.”
His friend shifted and Sherlock’s mind snapped back into place: the case, the markings on the bodies, an unremarkable killer, unsuspecting victims.
He shoves it all aside, along with his innate British masculinity, because if John doesn’t say it now, he won’t ever have the opportunity to say it again.
John’s laugh seems to burst out of him of its own accord, light and musical without extending into booming territory. Sherlock wants to record it, hold it, bottle it; fashion it into cologne and let it sink into his pores every morning. As it stands, a smile drifts over his face like wisps of cloud on a breezy afternoon: gentle and unhurried, yet all the more welcome for surprising him.
Thus, he frequently departs annoyed and stroppy, often with an inadequate amount of spare time to conduct an experiment in its entirety before his first class.
She has good reason for treating him a little icily, Sherlock privately admits. He’s spent a week avoiding her with the single-minded determination of someone attempting to keep particularly sensational gossip from their chronically nosy best friend. So it’s a small victory that he can, at least, decipher her intentions. Sherlock often finds that to be half the battle in their conversations.
John’s thoughts are spinning in his head with such alarming rapidity that he feels dizzy and slightly nauseous. There is a plane right beside them, Mary not far off, a security guard of Mycroft’s almost certainly standing too close and definitely eavesdropping, and Sherlock is
Groaning, John threw out his right arm to grab for it on his bedside table – and was greeted instead with soft linen. He chanced a frown, making the effort to crack open an eyelid.
“I don’t –” John swallows. Takes half a step closer for good measure, so that Sherlock can see his freckles in startlingly high definition.
“The point is I was taking a bath, which is generally a private activity, and you felt there was something so
Sherlock’s eyes positively light up. “Exactly. Nicknames give others the chance to tell us who we are. How they see us. That’s why it feels so odd when people who don’t know us well use our nicknames: it feels like they haven’t earned that perception of us yet.”
Sherlock seemed almost timid as he shuffled backward, bending lowly to lick the head of John’s cock just as a sinner bows in repentance. Then he raised his eyes to meet John’s gaze and, in one swift motion, swallowed him down to the hilt.
There’s a change in tone when Sherlock finishes this that makes it sound like a question mark, like he’s inviting a response. He surprises himself with it. He’s not used to conversation like this, to wanting to hear a voice other than the one in his head when he’s speaking of something he’s passionate about.
Mike Stamford is a fairly antisocial man, without a sprawling circle of friends. He lives with his longtime girlfriend Fiona and their pet Labrador, makes monthly visits to his parents’ home in Blackpool, and has generally amicable-in-passing relationships with the other lecturers at Barts. The appearance of the man who enters the room with him is a stark anomaly.
But John finds himself talking about all kinds of things at the other man’s request, unthinkingly spilling details of his life like a child handing out sweets. It’s addicting to have his full attention, to feel like whatever he tells him, his secrets will not only be kept safe but remembered, treasured.
When they arrived in the side street – the main road being where the club, Element, was located – Lestrade was waiting, cloaked in near-darkness but for the faint moonlight. An unmarked car sat nearby, and John spotted Donovan and another detective chatting not far off. Lestrade directed a nod of greeting at John and paused with his eyes on Sherlock as they approached. Then he cleared his throat.
“Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.” He nods, as if it will cement the statement firmly in the realm of certainty rather than in its current residence of blatant vagueness.
Seeing his frown, Irene takes pity on him by breaking the silence. “Sherlock, it’s been a whole week and I haven’t heard a peep from you. You’re lucky I didn’t show up to your place at 3 in the morning. Either it was a truly awful date or you slept with him and now you’re wishing you hadn’t.”
Inevitably, the woman had gone home with tears on her face and Mycroft had shot his brother a thunderous glare before silently retreating to bed early.
“Just tell me what happened after you left the restaurant. Did you go anywhere else? A bar for drinks? A spur-of-the-moment movie? Supper with his flatmate?”
“Then you’ll work it out.” Irene sounds so certain, as if her will cements the statement’s truth, that Sherlock almost believes it. He nudges a flattened patch of wet grass with the toe of his shoe.
Mycroft is visibly surprised, and Sherlock tries not to deduce what goes through his brother’s head when he asks to speak to John. The nosey git has
Sherlock was immensely appreciative of the small kindness: it gave him a physical point of connection with the case and their true objective, preventing his focus from whirling away onto the music, lights and hyperactivity of their location. John had a knack for doing that, Sherlock thought: reading and responding to Sherlock’s needs with ease, as if it was a routine they had followed and perfected over the course of their whole lives.
Sherlock’s cheeks flamed at that. He blinked, dropped his head almost into his plate and mumbled a quiet thanks. The chuckle that came from John convinced him that it mustn’t have been that bad; anything that made John made that sound was good and right and proper.
And she’s right: he’s tried to keep as much information from Irene’s sharp mind as possible. He hasn’t told her a word of what happened on his and John’s date.
“And he just destroyed it. Demolished any pure motivation I had to study for it. I drank so much coffee that semester.” John shakes his head, the remembered disappointment flickering anew in his eyes.
Raising his eyes slowly, Sherlock finds that John was already watching him. A shiver runs through him that has nothing to do with the chill of the evening air. He abruptly stops walking in front of a flat bearing the number 221. Pulls John over to the stoop with some urgency.
“Was never going to happen.” Lestrade’s face tightened a bit in frustration. “We asked if the owner would consider allowing security to check bags on entrance,” he explained for John’s benefit. “He not-so-politely refused. Apparently business is more important than preventing murders.”
He had been silent for too long, John’s hurricane expression growing rapidly more tempestuous with every passing moment. Realising this, his mouth started to shape words without his consent, engaging in a fight of its own – keeping John.
The woman was single and had never married. Probably not heterosexual; most likely not homosexual either, judging by the present circumstances. Although currently house- and cat-sitting for a long-time close colleague and his husband, she usually resided somewhere outside of town with two roommates.
“Your name. Your real name. Whatever it was before, whatever you’ve told people – I like Sherlock better.”
Sherlock looks up and stops when he sees John approaching him. Feels his bag slip from his shoulder and land with a quiet huff of air beside him. He watches the evening wind playing with John’s hair. Focuses on how endearing it is. Tries to push down the sea of emotions rising in him, guilt the strongest of them all.
His thoughts then shifted to the possibility of himself being the next victim. He was unable to stop his mind from filling with the image of himself, laying in an alleyway with his shirt torn off, his eyes wide and unseeing and a large, jagged H burnt into his chest. To an extent, he thought that he was already invisibly branded with the name of Holmes: memories came to him of the way Donovan and Anderson had looked at him at his first case, as if he were a freak by mere association with Sherlock; of Mycroft standing in a dank warehouse saying,
Although Sherlock can’t see his own expression, he isn’t sure which of them looks more bashful. John hides it well with what is positively a beam, while Sherlock thinks he might actually faint.
When he arrives, it’s extremely quiet, with only a handful of customers tucked away in corner booths and hunched over at hushed tables. Many wear oversized headphones, tap away at open laptops and are generally shrouded in overt messages to leave them alone. A lone female barista is sweeping behind the counter in light, controlled movements. Her long mop of hair is tied back, although the edges of a side-leaning fringe escape her navy hair clip and obscure much of her features.
They drained the rest of their small drinks and departed the safe vantage point – a little reluctantly, on Sherlock’s behalf. He tried to retain an awareness of John by his side as they moved into the throng.
When he closes the gap, Sherlock lets out a small noise of surprise that only makes John grin wider. The kiss is at once firm and gentle: John’s mouth moves with the soft desperation of
Sherlock tears his gaze from a lone dog-walker in the distance and focuses on his best friend. His eyes ask the question he refuses to voice.
“John?” A sudden gust of wind threatens to carry his voice away before John can hear him, but they’re standing too close for it to matter.
Personally, John envied the simplicity of Sherlock’s outfit and how it so easily suited him. He had also foregone a jacket, opting instead for a plain black t-shirt, black jeans and black shoes. The ensemble made him appear even taller, even more unattainable and even more striking than usual.
Sherlock smiles as she stands upright. Feeling compelled to answer, he replies, “I don’t really think I’m either.” He pauses. “Not really a food person.”
A customer moves to collect their drink, and Sherlock firmly ignores the flares of jealousy he feels toward every millisecond they experience John smiling at them and every decibel of their name on his breath.
Sherlock blinks, but can’t seem to recall how to speak. He hadn’t listened to any of his surroundings on the way over, and most likely wouldn’t remember anything of them in this moment even if he had.
John gently pulled back from the embrace, eyes searching. He nodded calmly. “You can get back to your mould cultures, you madman. Just let me give you a quick wash down first, alright?”
“I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.” He winds his scarf around his neck with a practiced loop, finding his eyes drawn to lock with John’s as he turns to face him again. “Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
Lestrade’s voice sounded placating now, probably reminding Sherlock that they needed to focus on their plan for tonight, not on whatever undoubtedly trivial thing for which he was being criticised.
The left pocket of her high-necked, short crimson playsuit dipped with the weight of her mobile phone, though clearly not with a wallet. A small purse was clutched in her left hand, which he assumed held the unaccounted-for item. She was looking at him with an expression of casual interest that spoke of intrigue, but not of desperation. Sherlock almost sighed with the sudden relief that flooded through him following that deduction.
Sherlock grimaced. “An alleyway a block from a club called Phoenix. I had thought that Bonfire was a surer bet but it appears that it was simply the more obvious choice. And yes. It’s… complicated.”
No, best not to think of that yet, that far off time that seemed so removed from reality in the near pitch black of the night. The moon was suspiciously absent.
“And Lestrade’s too much of precious cargo, so you thought you’d proffer your services?” Sherlock spoke, surprising John so that he hadn’t time to properly stifle his snicker.
Sherlock is too distracted, far too interested in other current circumstances to quite bring himself to care. He needs to choose his next words carefully.
Too soon, he had reached them. Forgoing words, he raised his eyebrows, with an expression like concrete gracing his face.
Stumbling up the final stair and into their flat, Sherlock was physically exhausted. Fully aware that the hyperactivity of his racing mind at present meant that he would not be making use of his own bed that night, he made the logical decision to leave John in his bedroom. His friend would be more comfortable there – and it was a shorter distance to it from his habitual thinking spot on the lounge than to John’s bedroom: if for any reason John were to be in need of assistance, he would be there in mere moments.
“No – listen to me. I should’ve said it before. I should’ve believed in you and I should’ve waited and I should’ve put you first, listened to you –” Wildly, he thinks of the plethora of napkins folded to resemble the Sydney Opera House, littering the coffee table and the floor around a seated Sherlock. He had looked up at him with such a
It's been wild but I'm back with another chapter! I won't attempt to make promises for when the next chapter will be, but rest assured that I love this story and I will not abandon it.
“Stupid.” Sherlock shook his head, seemingly in lament for the cognitive skills of Scotland Yard’s finest.
The night prior had brought the conclusion of the fifth case and, with hardly time for a short kip between each, Sherlock had returned to Baker Street more blurred and frayed at the edges than usual. He normally slept for at least twelve hours after a case, although sometimes up to fourteen after particularly taxing ones such as this had been. Therefore, John had no qualms about slipping past his friend’s figure early the next morning – draped haphazardly as he was across the lounge in the sitting room, as though he had simply fallen onto it and into slumber in the same movement, and remained in both – and into the bathroom for a relaxing bath and a wank.
Although he truly hadn’t thought it possible, being in the heart of the crowd was worse the second time around. It seemed that Sherlock’s reprieve from it, however short-lived, had reacclimatised him to the notion of personal space.
For a suspended moment, Sherlock and John stare at each other with blank faces and held breaths. Then Sherlock turns and almost bumps directly into the customer coming in behind him.
it. There was no damage to the photograph itself, I assure you. I –” Sherlock closed his eyes, hating himself, hating the shaking timber of his voice, how its usual smoothness had been abandoned, the rich baritone pitched several tones higher in distress. A voice dreadfully reminiscent of Mycroft’s echoed in the back of his mind.
Sherlock watches John’s nostrils twitch, sees his eyebrows dip. He feels like he could drown in John’s eyes, which are pleading with him as if John himself was the one who made a mistake. Sherlock’s throat is tight and he feels suddenly bereft and far too cold in the evening chill.
Irene’s expression is one of deep exasperation. “It’s not that, okay. It’s just –” She gestures tightly with both hands before turning to face him properly on the bench. “Sherlock, darling, my favourite brain to pick, the only person I’d trust to know which professors I’ve slept with, possible platonic love of my life – you’re an idiot.”
“We’ll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o’clock. Sorry – got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
Was it crazy that John was actually very thankful and a little bit proud of his friend’s doing so? Yes. Yes, probably.
She noticed him mid-sentence, her lips shaping a most likely prepared excuse that would also notify Lestrade of Sherlock’s undoubtedly agitated state. Sherlock met her half way, glancing behind her at the man she had left – a different one to the stage-five clinger who had been with her when they first arrived.
They explored each other’s mouths for a time, with all the enthusiasm of drowning men searching for their last breath, until John’s head tipped back, his chest heaving as he panted. Sherlock took the opportunity to anoint his jawline with kisses, and then proceeded to suck and lick his way down the man’s neck.
“Yes.” When it finally sounds, Sherlock’s voice is strong, unwavering. Only a tad concerned about the gravity of the horrendous mistake he had made the previous morning. “Doppio, thanks. Take away.”
His friend nodded, a hint of uncharacteristic solemnity present in his expression. “I suppose a small canister of butane gas and an accompanying detachable flame gun would be easy enough to conceal in a purse. Forensics think that the killer began the process some time after the eventually fatal leg wounds were administered, so the victim bled out before it was completed. The killer then retraced the pattern with a knife.”
“Yeah. I, uh –” John fumbles with something that the counter blocks from Sherlock’s view, glancing down at whatever it is he holds in his hands. “I’m not supposed to do this, but I figure I can make an exception.”
“What? What happened to him?” Sherlock rounded on her, chin raised and eyes narrowed, but she had turned to face the dance floor, too.
Normally Sherlock wouldn’t be amused by a woman’s polite attempts at conversing with him, but Molly’s unassuming warmth speaks of a kindness he’s not accustomed to outside of interactions with Mrs. Hudson. Her attitude is far from Irene’s teasing and salacious banter, or his classmate’s permanent disdain.
Sherlock thinks about his essay, long-forgotten in favour of more worthwhile uses of his attention, and simply can’t bring himself to care at present. The happy crinkle around his eyes is made visible only to the interior of his messenger bag. Then he rolls his neck in a smooth semicircle and straightens with a small intake of breath, steeling himself to return to the world outside of this newfound haven.
“That – it – my NAME!” Sherlock bursts out, suddenly breathing hard. He closes his eyes and presses his fingertips hard into his eyelids, feeling overwhelmed. Feeling embarrassed – a foreign concept he doesn’t enjoy at all.
He assumed it was due to the amount of time that had passed in the interim, allowing even more copious amounts of alcohol to be imbibed, but now the part of the club set aside for dancing was no longer being used for that purpose: it was merely a cesspool of sweat, complete with errant hands and elbows and feet. More than once, Sherlock was subjected to the uncomfortable sensation of a drink being spilled on his shoes, or splattering up the hem of his jeans. He was immeasurably grateful for his forethought; he shuddered to think of his dress shoes sustaining such defilement.
It does, however, present a problem in the more mundane aspects of his everyday life. One such aspect is the practice of ordering beverages.
John’s eyes crinkled with mirth at that. He spoke about how he used to be pretty good at rugby when he was younger, and his roommate often urged him to try out for the university team, but he just didn’t have the time to commit to it right now.
And when John finally looked up and their gazes met, Sherlock could see that the ocean was contained within John’s stormy eyes.
He revelled in challenging the impossible, but would gladly profess defeat if tasked with deducing an entire room of women, each one almost instantaneously, while weighed down by the superfluous background data that his senses absorbed.
“The game is never over, John.” The words come out biting, harsh, splintering the moment and threatening to draw blood. He regrets it immediately, purposefully softens his tone when he speaks again. “But there may be some new players now. It’s okay.”
Happy to let him talk, and even happier to entertain new ideas, John replies slowly, “Nicknames fit in with that, conceptually. We reinvent ourselves when we meet new people.”
– meets his eyes and Sherlock can see that he’s smiling just a little, just enough. Can see, from how close they’re standing, the gorgeous sparkle in his ocean blue eyes that tells him John doesn’t hate him after all.
John glances up and away at the library’s windows, extending eight floors above ground. Suddenly he seems unsure of himself in the midst of this prolonged small talk. “I saw you head back towards uni instead of going home. Took a guess. It’s uh, it’s where I’d go. Where I
At times such as these, Sherlock was reminded how much he truly appreciated John. Not just as someone who retrieved miscellaneous items for him or paid cab drivers or forced him to eat or sleep, and not even as his closest and most trusted friend, a person who understood his methods and his quirks like no other. During long or convoluted cases that dragged on and pushed him to his physical and mental limits, John was always there, encouraging him to rethink the information available to them, to reconsider the killer’s motives or methods, and reminding him of their ultimate goal. Unlike Lestrade or Donovan, John didn’t view him as an instrument through which the case could be solved and the criminal apprehended, but as a person who, like him, was trying to save people.
“Oh, you … you told him about me?” John’s brain feels sluggish; he curses its lethargy in the presence of this man’s mysterious omniscience.
“I agree that we should explore all necessary safety precautions tonight; both outcomes are feasible.”
Sherlock spared a glance at his friend for the unintentional pun. “Yes, it signalled a potential serial killer. The second body was found in an alley behind the Inferno club with an S carved into her abdomen.”
Sherlock mused. John may have sometimes viewed him as more than he was, as someone who never forgot anything and who could process unlimited amounts of information in an instant, but that wasn’t true. In spite of his best efforts, he was just a man. Granted, he was equipped with a sharp eidetic memory and the ability to make rapid deductions based on available information he had trained himself to understand – but he also regularly made mistakes.
He wasn’t exactly the best judge of that area and short of asking Donovan – a low he refused to sink to – he had no real way to confirm his belief, but he was reasonably certain that the woman was not what he would assume to be average looking. In any case, the only one of her physical characteristics that matched their description of the murderer’s was her sex.
“We’ve only just met and we’re going to go and look at a flat?” Despite the man’s words, Sherlock can see the edges of his mouth tugging upwards into a smile. Perhaps a begrudging one, but a smile nonetheless.
Maybe it’s something the barista says to everyone, a necessary pleasantry he bestows on every paying customer:
Their eye contact for the next few seconds is so intense that Irene feels like her eyes might water.
Each bright jingle of the bell above the door, and every dawning realisation that he should check on the few other customers still hanging around, makes John seem to start with a physical tremor, like he’s shaking himself awake from a dream. He is, really – in his own mind. Sitting with this man, having the chance to talk to him, feels like a blessing; like time and fate have conspired to grant him this gifted company. John’s worried that this beautiful, witty enigma of a man might realise at any moment that it’s just John he’s talking to – John, who doesn’t own any posh coats like the one he wore the other morning, and doesn’t know the first thing about Gödel’s theorems.
As he pushed his way through the heavy, sluggish crowd, the pair seemed almost surprised when he made in their direction. For a moment it appeared the woman would flee: she stilled with eyes wide, like a child hearing a noise in the next room while they were eating from the biscuit jar. Then a slow smile broke over her face that almost made Sherlock pause, in the midst of nebulous confusion.
It’s retrieved at long last, having fallen from his bedside table and onto the floor. The power socket his phone charger was plugged into hadn’t been switched on; that explains why his usual alarms had failed to rouse him.
Reality intrudes, unavoidable and unwanted, when closing time eventually creeps too close to ignore any longer. Sherlock finally admits that he should go. It takes a startling amount of his self control to give voice to a fact he knows to be true, even if some desperate part of him wishes it wasn’t. John scrubs a hand over the back of his own neck when he nods. A similar hesitation is clear in his expression, even as he smiles graciously.
John felt heat finally come to his face as he nodded forcefully. “I’d like that quite a bit, Sherlock.”
They spent the rest of that night in the school’s courtyard, breathing in the honeysuckle and moonlight, John leaning into his boyfriend’s warm side, allowing the music he made to permeate his brain, leaving a soft static in his ears.
He leaned against the counter and started running his fingers through Rosie’s thick blond hair, then carefully weaving the strands together.
“I’ll … see you all next week, then,” Sherlock said abruptly, reaching for the camera and ending the stream with the click of a button.
News spread quickly around the school, especially that concerning everyone’s two favorite Unrequited Lovers.
“So do I,” she replied, hopping off her seat and swinging her backpack on. “See you two after school.”
And by the time senior prom came around, well, that was quite the experience. Half the school seemed more excited about Sherlock and John going than themselves.
“Remind me again why you’re not next in line?” Sherlock huffed, standing up and stretching. His curly hair was stuck to his forehead with sweat; the room really was much too warm.
But it still felt right, and the way Sherlock shyly giggled next to him confirmed he felt the exact same way.
“Wait,” John paused, looking at Sherlock. “What do we have to discuss? I thought we were just meeting to … meet.”
“John Watson,” John replied. A small smirk made its way onto Sherlock’s face at the statement, which, John realized, he already knew from his Twitter handle. “Nice to meet you in person.”
John didn’t know how to braid hair. He knew how to tie knots and tourniquets, but his fingers were just not built for braiding.
John felt extremely uncomfortable, but decided to just bite the bullet and give Sherlock the truth as it was.
There was one more Sharpie scribble, and it was very near the small, irrelevant corner Sherlock had written his in, hoping to go unnoticed.
And he really couldn’t see it, but Sherlock’s façade was falling apart. John’s eyes were sending Sherlock a message that was clearly
Rosie recognized the looks they gave each other, and smiled. She hardly remembered her mother, but she’d heard stories about Mary Watson and was always humbled when Sherlock or John said she reminded them of Mary.
He left the table then, sifting through bottles in the cabinet to try and find what Sherlock was requesting. He smiles and shook his head at himself as he realized he’d never question Sherlock, even when he was dealing with dangerous substances.
Until suddenly, Sherlock opened his mouth and blurted out, “Well, it certainly is convenient that I wrote the other messages, then, isn’t it?”
The school had started calling the two of them the Unrequited Lovers, and John’s entire rugby team talked about them often.
John just looked at him blankly. Sherlock had never talked this much, especially to John. He had heard rumors, of course, of the one time Sherlock had raised his voice, apparently to yell at a teacher about how it didn’t matter what the Earth revolved around.
She reminded them both of Mary so much in that moment. And what was best was that the memory didn’t hurt anymore. All of the sadness had eventually been replaced with happy memories or new experiences, and the old pang in the heart had faded to a whisper of nostalgia, which made both John and Sherlock smile wistfully.
Cheeks heating just a bit, Sherlock looks away and drops heavily into the seat beside his flatmate, unable to look at him directly any longer without swooning like a moron, but unwilling to leave his side. "Open it," he encourages as he eyes the rest of his family settling in with small mounds of gifts surrounding each of their feet, even Sherlock's somehow appearing beside him, clearly while he'd been gawking at his friend like a lovesick schoolboy.
"Oh please, the boys locker rooms are on the other side of the hallway," Irene says, crossing her arms. "And the exit to the car park is beside it. He came down here for a reason."
"I do. I do realize what you think your decision is. But before you commit yourself to a relationship with me fully, there are things you need to know. And I'd like to tell you them in here."
"Shut up," Sherlock growls under his breath as he kicks Balthazar into gear, riding him across the course to the next jump.
John Watson who is not perfect like he made Sherlock think he was. John Watson who is not God's gift to earth like he made Sherlock think he was. John Watson who is not special like he
"Years," John clarifies, pressing a lingering kiss to Sherlock's cheek. "And then you waltzed into the library Friday afternoon talking about giving your virginity to some random stranger-"
"Oh I – y-yes, alright," Sherlock mumbles, hurrying out of the room and to the loo himself before he spins right back around and disappears back into his bed with his lover forever.
Sherlock traces a pattern on John's belly with the tip of his finger, trying to stay calm. "Scared of me," he mumbles.
