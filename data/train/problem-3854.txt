“Yeah, why?” Dean sat taller in his chair and puffed his chest out. “You got something to say about that?”
With a groan he pushed himself up off his bed and decided to put his things away. He never realized eating so much would make him so tired. He was just going to hang up his new robes, brush his teeth, and pass out.
“Look,” Sam said. “If you don’t want to talk to me, fine, whatever, I get it. If you don’t want to talk about whatever the hell happened in your little fantasy world, that’s fine, too. But, Dean… you
“Yeah, yeah,” Charlie said, waving him away. “I’m a big softie. Now get out, I need to seduce my girlfriend.”
Cas pulled him in close and gave him a quick kiss. “I don’t know, we can figure it out when I’m not late for chess club.”
The thing got in Dean’s face, breathing its putrid breath and dripping saliva onto him. “Ugh, you are one smelly son of a bitch.”
The line of his mother’s mouth turned downwards, obviously annoyed at her son’s taste in food (and what she referred to as ‘culture’).
“’M not,” he mumbled in reply. “Just… my mom always used to tell me that angels were watching over me, you know? And… and I don’t know if I believe that because if they were, then… then they would have been watching over her and she’d still be okay. But—but maybe she could still be…” He let his sentence trail off with a sigh.
Cas nodded solemnly and took a small bite. A thoughtful expression crossed his features as he chewed.
He needed to take his mind off of it. He needed to find something to distract himself. Star Trek, as much as Dean loved it, just wasn’t cutting it. Casting his eyes around the room, he finally landed on his backpack lying innocently next to the door.
“Still eating,” Dean said. “I gotta go see Bobby.” He began walking and then turned back quickly. “Oh, I told him I’m meeting Bobby for family stuff, so make something up if he asks.”
“Come on, man,” Sam said. “You won’t even look at him anymore. He thinks you blame him for what happened.”
“Maybe we’ll even have a little fun with both our wands.” The tone was serious again, but this time there was the undercurrent of sincerity that had Dean spluttering and flustered instead of sullen and moping.
"Yeah," Cas said. Then, seemingly upon remembering that the monster incident happened in the woods right there, he went on, "Oh, but we don't have to. We can go somewhere else. See a movie, or try and brave the public pool. You can pick."
“Yeah, Sam,” Dean said. “I mean, you’re too scrawny for the monster to want to eat you anyway. Unless he’s looking for an appetizer.”
“Whatever, dude,” Dean said, too preoccupied to worry about being embarrassed. “Oh, and we’re leaving at ten, so be ready.”
“Thanks,” Cas gave him a small smile. “I didn’t actually swallow a dictionary, but Gabriel swears he saw me chewing on a thesaurus when I was little.”
Hesitantly, Cas reached out, and when Dean didn’t flinch or pull away, placed his hand on Dean’s thigh. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I don’t want you to ever have to relive it. I would take all of your pain away if I could. But I think Sam has his suspicions and he doesn’t seem like the type to drop something like this.”
“Dean,” Cas said urgently, slamming the door behind himself and striding dramatically into their shared apartment. “I need your help.”
Their conversation only got cheesier from there, Dean completely forgetting the reason he called Cas in the first place.
“Shit,” Dean heard one of the teenagers say before the soft thunk of a bat hitting the ground. “Kid, are you okay?”
“Yes, my love?” Cas replied, not taking his eyes from Dean’s lips and the pleasant dark pink color they had taken on.
Sam slumped, defeated. “How is he always so freaking hungry?” he mumbled while stomping from the room. He picked his bag up where he had left it by the door and ignored Bobby’s admonishment for kicking his door open. He’d feel bad about it later, but right now he had too many emotions vying for top spot and it was making him irritable.
Dean swallowed down a large portion of his coffee, scalding his mouth and trying not to choke on it.
“Yeah, but…” Dean extended his arm as far as it would go, landing just a couple inches short of the hard plastic of the remote.
“He didn’t mean three inches to get the remote,” Cas snapped, then seemed to catch himself and took a deep breath. “Dean you have a sprained knee, you’re hardly incapacitated.”
Dean was having a great time camping even if he was by himself. He didn’t need his little brother to make every venture of his worthwhile, even if this camping trip was supposed to be tradition. Just because Sam got himself a girlfriend and doesn’t want to leave her for
“No!” Dean shouted. “No, I’m sorry, but Sam is missing! And I’m telling them where to find him and they’re looking at me like I’m crazy! You’re looking at me like I’m crazy!”
“I won’t,” Cas replied easily, opening his locker and grabbing the desired biology text book and handing it over to Dean. “I’m a good student.”
He dropped his baseball bat outside, hoping the thud it made when it connected with the hard and cracked dirt outside wouldn’t carry. He hoisted himself up and through his window next, landing much more softly as his sneakers made contact with the ground. He left his window open, too afraid to make more noise than necessary.
Dean laughed. “Okay, but when you’re looking I’d stay out of Gabe’s room. He doesn’t seem like a very vanilla-in-bed kinda guy and I don’t want you to get scarred for life.”
,” John said the word like it physically pained him and Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from yelling. “He’s a dragon.”
“I thought you said you were healing,” Dean accused, rushing forward to add his hands into the mix, accidentally bumping Charlie out of the way.
Dean was groggy when he woke up. Groggy with a killer headache. It took him a few moments to remember what happened and why he was tied to a chair. When he did he cursed.
“Shouldn’t we be listening to Cas’ favorite music since it’s his birthday?” Jo piped up from the backseat.
“… And another child has gone missing, this time Ava Wilson, age ten. She was last seen in her home just last night. If anyone has any information regarding this case or that of Ansem Gallagher, reported missing four days ago by his parents, we urge you to contact the sheriff’s department immediately. Searches are ongoing…”
“Fuck,” Dean muttered, falling back onto his pillows. He stayed like that for another couple of minutes before he rolled over to face his nightstand. He grabbed the promised journal and ran his fingers over the smooth brown leather. It reminded him of a newer version of his dad’s journal, only this one would be filled with random facts about his daily domestic life instead of the best way to take down a newly transformed rugaru or the quickest way to exorcise a demon.
Dean closed his eyes and tried to calm himself down. “Get out,” he managed to grit through his teeth. “Get out before I—“
“It’s not going to work,” Dean told him. “You need a willing party to break a bond. Just let me go.” He tried flexing in his bonds again, but there was still no give. He let out a frustrated shout. Looking over to his father who was now rummaging around in a black duffel bag placed just inside the large circle he had painted on the ground, he said, “Please, dad. I have literally never asked you for anything in my life. I did everything you ever asked me. Just please,
“Oh, I don’t know, Dean,” Sam said. “Maybe because he’s given up on trying to talk to you and has instead decided he’s going to work himself to death becoming the next great hunter so you won’t kick him out of the bunker.”
Dean let out a long sigh before sitting up, pulling his now bandaged arm back to his own lap. “It’s alright, Sammy. It’s not your fault that dad’s an asshole.”
Cas let go of his grip on Dean’s hair and fisted both of his hands in his letterman jacket. “I like being president of the chess club,” he growled.
, freaking Charlie). Why didn’t anyone ever warn him that owning his own shop meant he had to do all the boring shit like paperwork? He just wanted to get under the hood of a car and get to work. Leave everything behind and just let an engine speak to him.
“No,” Cas said. “I told you that he always sings the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song when he drinks too much rum.”
Seven figures stood before them, statue like. The missing teens and the missing children. Everyone except for—
Cas ran his hands over the deep blue comforter on either side of him. “I don’t want to presume anything. I fear my own desires are clouding my judgment.”
“Well, like I said, it’s Cas that’s good with the details.” He stood up abruptly and stretched. “And you know, it’s getting pretty late, mom, best be off to bed.” He faked a yawn.
“What is what?” he asked, trying to remove her death grip. It was one thing when she was just ruining his shirt, but this
Bobby narrowed his eyes at Sam. “I ain’t apologizing for not tellin’ ya about him. Dean asked me not to, and after what that boy had been through, I’d thought it best to go along with his wishes.”
“Nearly,” Cas replied, shooting Dean a quick glance. “We’ll follow our soul mate into the afterlife.”
“Yeah, I sort of got that,” Jo replied, striding into the blessedly air conditioned house. She took a moment and stood directly under one of the vents. “Sweet Jesus, that’s nice.”
Dean and Cas avoided each other’s eyes as they drove past house after house, Cas’ face still glowing and Dean too afraid to make any sort of move after Gabe’s threat. It went on like that until they pulled up to Dean’s shabby but well-kept house.
“What? No way,” Dean said. “I don’t want to actually live with the guy. I’ve heard your horror stories.”
Cas put a hand on Dean’s knee and squeezed. “I think we should at least let him explain what your father was doing there. He could have shown up out of the blue.”
Another name! She grabbed and clung onto that small thread of hope. “Oh, yes, it might be under…” She stopped. She had never gotten Cas’ last name.
“Yeah, well. I need to do something before I snap.” He let out a frustrated groan. “I mean, if Sam asks me one more time why I don’t want dad to know where I am, I might kill him.”
Jess’ heart sank all the way down to her knock off designer heels that were already killing her feet. “Are you sure?” she asked, lowering her voice in the hopes that Sam couldn’t hear them.
Dean barely refrained from rolling his eyes. He hated being a legacy. It did come with special treatment, just not the kind anyone wanted. For Dean, it just meant that his grandpa used to work here way back when and people still felt bad for his family because he died so horribly they never even recovered his body. There was even a plaque dedicated to him and his Bondmate so every kid who came here knew that Dean was never going to live up to his grandpa’s uber heroic legacy.
Dean let his laughter out then, his tears able to pass as from the outburst. He laid a hand on Cas’ shoulder, like he had done so many times before, and just like all of those times, a warmth spread through Cas. He let that feeling finally pull his mouth into a smile.
“Fine,” Charlie huffed. “But only because I don’t think it’s very smart to discuss this when Cas is in the other room.”
The gym had been decorated with balloons and streamers in red and white, photo booth in one corner, drinks and snacks in another, game booths spanning the far wall like some sort of carnival. It looked decent, even if the ever present scent of B.O. still lingered in the air, like a sign seen from the corner of your eye. It was definitely still the gym, no matter how much glitter they doused it in.
“The only thing we can do,” Dean said, taking the knife from Cas in a hand still slippery and warm from his blood. “Try not to hurt the kids. Well, maybe the high schoolers. They did try and scare Sammy.”
The shopping trip was a success according to Dean who bought enough food to last them at least three weeks.
Cas tugged his blade out and kicked off of Lucifer again, this time making it to the edge of the hole. He grabbed it and pulled himself through, falling out onto the other side. He managed to get his wings working before he landed on the still burning forest, and then his only thought was to find Dean.
“Honestly? Pigs to start flying,” Jo said. “Because that’s the only way I’m going to believe this conversation is actually happening right now.” But she still followed them as they changed course, Cas peeking his head into Gabe’s shop to quickly shout their new plans.
“Besides, we are not living the same day,” Cas continued. “Yesterday we watched a Spanish soap opera.”
He blinked the water out of his eyes and spit the last of the water out of his mouth, his coughing fit now over. He quickly scanned the sky for Cas but only saw a large black dot. Dean clicked his tongue. He had been hoping to fight up there in zero gravity, but he guessed he’d just have to wait for Cas to regale him with the details later.
“No!” he nearly shouted. Apparently his dread far outweighed his desperation. Then in a calmer, much less crazed tone, he added, “No, thank you, but I’m fine to go with you.” He saw Balthazar coming back into the room. “Besides, I wouldn’t be so cruel as to leave you with only Balthazar for company.”
Cas finally made the harrowing move to place his whole hand on top of Dean’s. He only needed to say one word, the one that meant everything to him, and the one that meant so much more when he said it. “Dean.”
Although, now that Dean was thinking about it, he wasn’t exactly landing any vital blows on the thing. He could have smacked himself in the forehead. Here he was thinking he was kicking ass when really he had just fallen right into the creature’s trap. Cas even told Dean that it liked to fight from afar, avoiding any serious damage to itself. His frustration tasted bitter on his tongue; he couldn’t even begin to imagine how Cas felt after a lifetime of this bullshit.
Dean’s brow furrowed even more before quickly recollecting himself. “Right. Balthazar.” He nodded a few times and rounded the car to get back into the driver’s seat.
Cas shifted into a more comfortable position in the passenger’s seat and said, “He’s probably trying to pry information out of Bobby.”
The silence lasted for about two minutes before Sam opened his mouth again. “Is that why you always used to lock yourself in the bathrooms at motels? Were you having panic attacks?”
The next day Andy Gallagher was reported missing. His parents were absolutely beside themselves, having now lost two sons. Their tearful plea for them to be returned (or to return since no signs of a struggle could be found anywhere) had Mary hugging Sam and Dean so tightly to her that Dean felt as if he might bruise.
“Yes,” Cas replied, a small smile lifting a corner of his mouth, the first time that Sam had seen the guy show any emotion at all. “Four years, now.”
“I wasn’t going to kill him,” Cas said. “I was only going to try and persuade him to leave. Sam can even come with me.” After a moment’s pause, with his head tilted to the side, he added, “Although, our situation would be completely resolved if you let me kill him.”
“Dean, you are acting like a child!” Cas shouted. Dean took vindictive pleasure in having gotten Cas to break his unnaturally calm façade and slammed the door behind himself.
Jess rolled her eyes and tugged him forward by his hand. She left him by the door with a slightly exasperated shake of her head and strode up to the maître d’ alone.
Dean buried his smile into Cas’ shoulder. “I’ll call Bobby up tomorrow and see if he has anything that needs doing around here. If not we’ll skip it and get straight to the good stuff for you.”
“Okay,” Dean said in a loud voice, clapping his hands together. “Moment over! I’m starved, what’s there to eat?”
“No,” Cas said. “But Charlie just called. Your father showed up at the shop. I’m on my way there now.”
Jo rolled her eyes but came over and gave Sam a hearty pat on the shoulder. “Charlie is being dramatic, but it is good to have you back.”
Cas leaned even closer to Dean. “I packed that pair of cowboy boots you got for Halloween last year. I was thinking we could take turns getting fucked by Doctor Sexy.”
“Alright,” Sam replied. “Okay. I’m sorry. I want this to work, too. There were… there were definitely times I wish I could have picked up the phone and called you, man.”
“Or maybe the monster got them, too,” Charlie cut in. “They were last seen in the woods, right? Sam and his friends saw them and then they saw the real thing? Nobody saw them after that.”
“I thought it was just planes,” Dean said. He peeked both eyes open before slamming them shut again. “Flying metal death tubes shooting through the air with nothing but the grace of god keeping them up? I don’t even believe in the guy, so no thank you.” He took a deep breath. “Thought I’d be fine if I had wings of my own, you know?” He shook his head and let out a shaky laugh. “Turns out I just don’t like heights.”
The two of them ran, all limbs and elbows, coming to a skidding halt in the kitchen in front of a very unimpressed looking Bobby.
Cas gave him a little shove before knocking on Sam’s door. “Sam?” he called. “Your mom sent us to get you for dinner.”
“Jo, shut up,” Dean told her, glancing back over his shoulder to see that only about half of the class had gone back to their own drama, the other half halfheartedly pretending they weren’t listening in.
Dean let out a huge exhale and turned his head to face away from Cas, who merely squeezed Dean’s hand.
“This is ridiculous,” Cas said. “Are you telling me we’re not even going home to pick up some clothes?”
. He was looking at Dean like he had just grown another head—or maybe Cas was just realizing how utterly, pathetically in love Dean Winchester was with him and couldn’t quite believe how he could ever dare to love an angel.
“Uh, I was sort of hoping you could tell me that.” Dean kept a grip on Sam’s shoulder, sure that it was the only thing grounding his little brother who’s eyes kept flitting around as if the answers could be found hidden somewhere in the air.
The words echoed in the cavernous war room, taunting Dean, each repetition more pathetic sounding than the last. And Cas just stood there, staring at him with his head cocked to the side in that way that was just purely, stupidly
He drove the whole way home in a daze. He’d be thankful he made it there in one piece once his brain finally rebooted. He’d also most likely apologize to Baby for playing so fast and loose with her well-being.
“Cas!” Dean exclaimed. “Sammy, this is Cas!” And then in a whisper just as loud as his previous exclamation, “The
“You mean that getting stabbed was the plan?” Dean demanded hysterically, pressing his hands to the stab wound.
She shrugged. “The principal said that no one could find them, but they’re pretty sure it was some of the students that ditched today since they’re the only ones unaccounted for.”
“Don’t listen to it, Sam,” John told him. “You know you can’t trust a word it says. We do this and Dean is free. That’s what you want for him, right?”
“Sorry, Jo, gotta go,” Dean said, grabbing Cas by his upper arm and practically dragging him out of his seat.
“You better not stain my new table cloth,” Dean told him, handing him a plate filled with eggs and bacon.
He stumbled through brambles and branches on his way towards where he had seen the thing crash, the beam of his flashlight dancing a haphazard path across the trees, spinning over fallen leaves. The further he went the brighter it got, too, until his flashlight became completely unnecessary. The light diffusing through the trees was a soft white and it almost glimmered. Probably not a good sign.
“C-cute?” Dean stuttered, daring to look back up into those blue depths, so much brighter in real life. Cas had a bit of a blush staining his cheeks pink as well.
He finally looked up and saw Cas’ blue gaze locked on him. Time seemed to stop as they stared at each other. Dean wanted to close the distance but couldn’t bring himself to move. He could hear his heart beat pounding in his ears, wondered if Cas could hear it, too.
Cas clenched his jaw. “I’m not going anywhere.” He brought his knees up and used them to kick off of Lucifer to launch himself back towards the hole in the sky. Lucifer grabbed him around the ankle and yanked him back. Cas followed along with the motion and brought his blade up, stabbing Lucifer in the shoulder.
Cas bit his lip. He didn’t want to be callous, but, “Do you think you’ll be able to get over it? My adversary could show up at any minute.”
Dean laughed and snaked his arm around Cas’ waist as they made their way to the door. “You know, I still don’t know what the French word for twelve is.”
“Only if you admit that you started it,” Cas said, putting his hands on Dean’s shoulders to stop him from getting closer.
“Dean?” Cas ran into the room, dropping down next to him. “What happened?” His hands hovered over Dean’s bad knee but didn’t touch, too afraid to cause any more pain.
"I'm not saying that I think it is, but, he uh, he made me promise to hear you out without making up my mind on it first. So, tell me what happened. All of it." He went over and sat down on the edge of Sam's unmade bed. "And hey, even if I still don't believe you, at least you have Cas, right? Charlie, too, I guess. But Jo's still on the fence."
Sam hardly waited until he heard Cas’ feet on the stairs before rounding on Bobby. “Why doesn’t Dean want dad to know he’s here. What happened between them?”
Cas, who had just come back into the room with their first aid kit, walked over and took a seat next to Dean. He pulled Dean’s injured arm towards himself and began to clean it. “Anything you want, my love.”
Dean froze where he had a knife poised above the pie, ready to slice. Slowly, he turned to face Cas. “You baked a pie for me?”
“Cas thought we should try and make a good impression.” Dean shrugged and tried to steal a piece of shrimp from the pan Mary was making scampi in only to have his hand swatted away.
He wiped away the last of the evidence of his crying and sped up to see who was going through his room. But when he got to the doorway he was blocked by someone coming out. They literally bonked heads and bounced off of each other.
Cas slid his hand down Dean’s arm and intertwined their fingers. “Or maybe I could just help you out. Your class is right next to mine.”
“It’s a very big deal, Dean,” Cas told him, his voice taking on an angelic strength that Cas had no right to anymore. “I would like to know why you automatically assumed that I was leaving.”
“You’re awesome,” Dean told him, leaning up for a kiss which Cas was more than happy to oblige him with.
Or maybe he was really talking to a star. Or suffering a serious mental break. “And astronomers have never discovered that stars are human shaped because…”
“Ah, yes,” Cas said. “I cheated when you and Charlie were the ones making deals to team up and take me down before the game even started.”
Dean opened his mouth to reply but there came a loud pounding on the door and a shouted, “Dean! Dean, I know you’re in there!”
“Oh, that’s it, asshole,” Dean said, tackling him back onto the bed of the truck. He pinned Cas’ arms above his head. “You’re going to pay for that.”
He turned with wide eyes from his mom to the suited man and woman in front of him. There were other officers there as well, cataloguing the scene, patrolling the perimeter. “Huh?” he asked.
“He didn’t mean anything,” Dean said quickly. “You know how dad was. You don’t think that shit qualifies as hurting us?”
“Of course, man!” Dean nearly shouted. “I mean—uh—I would not be averse to that, no.” He held his hands out awkwardly as he gestured towards Charlie’s recently vacated seat.
Castiel cast his eyes down and noticed that his entire front had been covered in flour. It must have happened when he had first tried opening the bag—how was he to know the powdery substance would puff out of the newly torn opening? Needless to say, it had surprised him into spilling nearly half of the bag down his front. Perhaps he should have worn one of the aprons that Dean had hanging on a hook near the pantry.
“Aw, ain’t you two sweet,” Bobby cooed at them, expecting Dean’s usual brash dismissal of such things.
“I—I’m sorry!” he gasped. “But you—you checked your—“ His sentence was lost to another bout of laughter.
“You did it Cas! Holy shit, you fucking did it!” Gabriel was shouting and the next thing he knew Gabe was crushing him in a hug, continuing to shout directly into his ear. “Oh my god, Cassie, you’re finally free!”
“Not much if they can’t prove anything,” Mary replied. “And it doesn’t look good for them being able to. Besides, Sam will be fine. No one was actually hurt, just shaken up.”
“What do you mean it hasn’t arrived yet? What, you’re too good to go to the store and pick up the chocolate yourself? I know you’ve got a driver’s license, kiddo. I was the one that took you to get it.”
“Let’s go, lover boy. The dance started five minutes ago and I’m sure your prince charming is searching high and low.”
“Well, what’s going to happen to them?” Dean demanded, already forming a list in his mind of what he’d like to do.
“Yes,” Cas continued. “Which is why I think that, though they’re not people, perhaps they could be a window that people can look through. Your loved ones are still there, but they are not the stars themselves.”
“Fine,” Dean spat back. “Then I’ll leave.” He grabbed his keys off of the table and wrenched the door open.
“Nothing against her, of course,” Cas said and took another step closer to Deean. “I believe I’m a difficult student when it comes to this sort of thing.”
“How on earth do you go from stoned out of your mind to charmer in like two seconds flat?” Sam asked, lowering his phone to stare at his brother.
Cas stood frozen, looking between the two brothers and trying to decide which to help and which to betray. Luckily, he was saved by the doorbell ringing not a moment later.
Dean nodded a few times, feeling a little nauseous and wondering if he was close to getting heat stroke. “I mean, if that’s your only problem…” He let out a huff of air. “It’s not a huge deal. She’ll probably think it’s cute or something, that you don’t know how. I’m sure she’ll have no problem teaching you.” He tried to keep the bitterness out of his voice, but with the sharp look Cas shot him he wasn’t sure he was entirely successful.
Sam held up his hands in surrender. “No, no,” he said. “I guess it just didn’t occur to me that you might change your name.”
Charlie snorted. “Is that what he told you? He hustled you, my friend. I hope you didn’t put any money down.”
Cas cocked his head in thought as he stared at the flickering flames of the fire. “I like listening to the sounds of the universe,” he said with a smile. “The planets spinning, flying along their paths. Asteroids drumming into anything in their way. Sometimes we’d even hum along, add to the melody. It’s very peaceful.” He pulled his marshmallow out, now the perfect shade of golden brown, and turned to Dean for further instruction.
Dean grinned immediately, no trace of that sadness left. “Obviously,” Dean replied. “We were just waiting for your clumsy ass to finish locking up.”
“What’s wrong with my shirts?” Dean asked, looking down at his baggy black shirt with Batman’s logo standing out in yellow. “Batman is awesome!” He looked back over at Charlie. “Yours has Wonder Woman!” he accused.
Dean shook his head with a fond smile. “I’m not up to making your lazy ass anything, want to order in?”
Dean rolled his eyes and followed. “You’re always starving,” he called to Cas, who was already halfway down the stairs.
“Perhaps it is selfish of me, but I like having them,” he admitted, breaking eye contact for the first time. “You have all of mine,” he added softly.
“No can do, broski. She likes her name, don’t you girl?” He patted the dashboard fondly. “Now get your butts in here, I don’t have all day.”
Cas unlocked the back door to the bakery and stepped inside. It smelled wonderful, scents like cinnamon and chocolate and strawberry mingling in the warmth of the kitchen, but it was the loud music blaring through the stereo that put a smile on Cas’ face. Led Zeppelin this morning.
Sam raised his gigantic shoulders in a shrug. “I don’t know. Maybe? Today was only the first day, so I’m just trying to get back into the hang of things.”
Dean was not okay. Cas had been tackled out of the sky by something that looked straight out of a fairytale from hell, and as if that wasn’t bad enough, it had happened
“Right, yeah,” Sam mumbled, bumping into the wall a few times on his way out, completely unwilling to remove his hand from his eyes lest he somehow manage to see through his eyelids. It’s not like this was the first time Sam had caught Dean having sex, but it was definitely the first time Sam caught him taking it up the ass from his best friend.
Dean sighed and dropped his head into his hands. “It’s just—it’s hard, Sammy. It’s hard to be around him.”
“I didn’t say that,” Bobby told him. “I’m only trying to say that you don’t have to keep hunting just because it’s what you think you should do. You have an out. No one would blame you if you took it.”
“But he’ll be back tomorrow. I told him I’d look into some of the stuff he was giving me.” He turned to face Dean who was staring at the wall with a blank look on his face. “I’m sorry, son. I didn’t know he was coming. I tried to get him to wait, but you know how he is.”
“What, is skin cancer not a concern anymore?” Dean asked, then, “Wait, how do you know my ass got sunburned?”
Dean pulled away with a soft, “Fuck.” He kissed Cas again. “Handjobs in the shower. Final offer,” he said, a little breathlessly.
“Yeah, well the quicker the better. Got to make sure this guy ain’t trying to pull one over on your rusty ass.”
“He had put it in your drink originally. You switched them and then called him out. So unless you were implicit in his prank on you, that wouldn’t make any sense.”
“Is it because you don’t want to hunt anymore?” Sam asked one day. The two of them had stepped outside with their beers, while Cas, Jess, Charlie, and Gilda remained inside playing the game that Charlie had brought over.
Dean ducked his head, and Cas knew he was blushing, though he couldn’t see it behind his sunburn. “Well, I’ve got one more present for you.”
Cas forced a small smile onto his face. “My love,” he said gently, preparing himself to crush Dean’s manic façade, but at the pleading look in his eye he relented. With a sigh, he asked, “Would you like to pick an island, or would you like to do it together?”
Dean glared at his little brother. “Shut up, bitch. We’re not being weird. You’re weird.” But he handed over the remote without a fight.
Bobby shooed him up the stairs, Cas following behind him with a small smile. Dean turned left at the second floor landing and led Cas to the spare room which he opened with an exaggerated flourish. Cas rolled his eyes and gave him a gentle kiss before moving into the room and sitting down on the full bed which let out a soft squeak with his weight.
It was bright, so bright he immediately squinted, waiting for his eyes to adjust before inspecting it further. Once his eyes stopped screaming, he brought it up to eye level. At the end of the leather cord was a small, corked vial, but inside…
“How the fuck should I know, Sam?” Dean spat, causing both Sam and Cas to jump a little at the vehemence, especially since he had just seemed catatonic. “You didn’t tell him I’d be here, did you?”
Since Sam’s revelation seemed to go over well, Cas decided that he would try it out as well. At least this way he would know and the awkwardness would be minimal, since it would last a couple days at the most.
“What?” Dean asked, pushing himself into a sitting position with his back against the headboard. He quickly wiped his face, hoping Cas hadn’t seen the evidence of his tears. “What do you mean?”
Dean opened and shut his mouth several times while trying to think of a response, but nothing ever came to him. He finally decided on changing the subject. “How’d you fall?” Again, his nerves were showing.
And then someone stepped out from behind it. Sam. Shaggy hair, pajamas two inches too short because he was growing faster than their mom could buy him clothes, kind hearted, pain in the butt little brother,
The man slumped forward and covered his face with one of his hands, small whimpering sounds now coming from him, albeit muffled.
“Protect him from what?” Sam laughed. “His happy life away from you? I think he’s made it pretty damn clear that he doesn’t want you to be a part of his life anymore, and after what I found out you did to him, you’re lucky I’m not finishing what Cas started.”
“There’s just, uh, one more problem, then.” Dean hardly had to raise his voice to be heard over the music, the two of them were so close.
“That’s the one,” she said. “Although, I can’t speak for other Deans. You might be a total Dean magnet.”
“Yeah,” Dean said slowly. “My letterman jacket.” He put a hand on Cas’ forehead. “You feeling okay? I mean, I know you were moaning my name pretty loud a few minutes ago, did it hurt your hearing?”
“What the fuck,” Dean spat. He tried to see if there was any give in the ropes tying his arms, but he should have known his father wouldn’t allow for that. “Seriously, dad, what the fuck.”
Cas clenched his hands into fists. “Apologies,” he said after a sigh. “Please drive quickly, Sam. I have an idea what your father plans to do and we cannot allow it to happen.”
“Oh,” Jess said. She frowned as she pondered the question. “Well, what’s the worst that could happen? Best case scenario, they’ve somehow managed to get reservations last minute on a cancellation or something. I mean, maybe they know the maître d’ and he snuck them in. Worst case scenario, we look like idiots for five minutes and find out that your brother really is a giant asshole and then I make you feel better with ice cream and sex. I say we go for it.”
“You never told me you were psychic. You think that would be something I should know about my husband.”
“Whoa, there, Dean-o,” Jo said. “What’s got you so jumpy? It’s the last day, it’s not like there’s a test you forgot to cram for.”
“Thank you guys for coming,” Dean said. “But don’t feel like you have to. This is… the stupidest thing we’ve ever done before.”
Cas grinned for a moment before the next throb of pain shot through him and his face sobered. “I did not like today.”
“Did you have a good birthday, Cas?” Dean asked him, a crooked smile on his face. His cheeks had gotten sunburnt, but mostly he’d just gotten more freckles.
“That’s not—“ Cas cut himself off and took a deep breath. “I’ve told you countless times that I’d rather be here, with you. You have to know that I never wanted to leave you, Dean.”
His eyes blinked open and he looked around. Dean was doing homework by lamplight at his desk, pen slowly inking something onto the pages of a book.
“What is all this?” Cas asked, pushing some of the multi colored balloons aside to find Dean standing in the middle of their room with a huge grin on his face.
Dean snorted and tipped his beer bottle back to drain the last of it into his mouth. “Sure thing, babe. Let’s go kick some ass.” He pushed himself up from where he had been sitting on the deck and walked over to his husband, leaning down to whisper in his ear, “Thank you.”
“Yes, but I’m the queen,” she said. “Besides, I’m not drowning in mine. You’ve got a good body, Winchester, show it off a little.”
“Okay!” Sam said, lifting his hands up to cover his ears. “I get it, I don’t need to hear any more.”
did not want to keep it a secret. More like he wanted to shout it from the rooftops. It was just… just
“Is this true?” Cas asked. “What you’ve written?” At Dean’s continued stammering, Cas stood up and held the textbook out. “Please tell me this is not some horrible prank.”
Dean let their chatter blend into that of the other volunteers and police as he stared into the woods. They looked so peaceful, so beautiful. Dean could hardly believe that they held such a horrible, dark, and ominous secret between their sun-kissed leaves.
“You are a complete dork,” Cas told him. At Dean’s affronted look, he went on with a small grin. “And that’s why I love you.”
Dean shot her a warning look but she just smiled sweetly at him. Cas didn’t appear to notice anything, too caught up in trying to beat Sam again.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said. There had definitely been an attempt made at flattening his hair, but Dean was glad it had failed. He liked that Cas always looked a little windswept. It added to the whole head in the clouds thing he had going for him.
Next, Dean pulled Cas over to the photo area he had just spotted, which was really just a cheesy backdrop with streamers and a teacher with a polaroid. They posed for two pictures anyway, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, huge grins plastered across their faces. Dean would never admit it, but he was definitely going to frame his as soon as he got home. And with the reverent way Cas was looking at his own picture, Dean thought he might not be the only one.
Instead, Castiel shrugged noncommittally. He slid his hand into Dean’s and began leading him away from the art, away from the uncomfortable question that still hung in the air, toward the exit.
Once Castiel had reached the other edge of the clearing, where he could be safe from crushing any flowers, he settled down on the grass and pulled out his sketchbook. There were so many flowers that begged for his attention, but Castiel ignored them in favor of the Castilleja.
“I’m glad you’re so happy to monopolize my time, but I need to get up to the house for my dinner. And you should probably go home too.”
When Castiel offered nothing in response, Dean asked another one instead: “So you’re worried that Kazimir might be used as a one-way ticket?”
“Yes, of course,” Gia agreed. “But now that you have risen, we must get you back to safety. You’ll move into Ana’s—”
Castiel settled down on the floor as well, only the grid of papers and books separating him from the omega, and glanced through the stack. “I somewhat know
“She must have!” Cas reasoned. “She’s the only one who would…” he looked up at the man, tears brimming in his eyes. “I promise, I was never going to do anything about it,” he rambled. “I tried to stay away, but you just—“
His soul cried out for Dean, wanted to fly down and help. Then he could see his alpha one final time. But he pushed the urge away; he couldn’t go help them, not without freeing a worse evil—an evil that neither his alpha nor his sister would survive.
When Cas had first arrived, with Michael’s death a fresh wound in his heart that reopened every night, he never would have thought of even looking at another alpha, much less wanting one. But now, as weeks and months had passed, Castiel knew he couldn’t keep ignoring those little things about Dean—how he was kind to everyone, always helpful, always ready with a smile, even in the midst of stress.
As Castiel—or Cas, as Dean had apparently dubbed him—followed the alpha through the halls, Dean explained the setup of the sanctuary.
“Just what I said,” Donna agreed from across the room where she was helping chop up food for dinner that evening.
Cas may have whimpered a little bit when Dean’s tongue slipped into his mouth, claiming his after years of separation. Cas could only press tighter, his body desperate for the feel of Dean’s. Damn Uriah and his forged forms; Cas had Dean back, and he wasn’t going to let him go again.
He shook his head, hesitating before his the next words. “LeMarc, one of the greatest criminals the world has ever known, had a wife and son, but he still managed to remain active under police radar for years.”
“I don’t think it’s fair that my dad is forcing Sammy to marry your sister just because he’s the future king,” Dean echoed.
Cas, on the other hand, was headed up to New York, to Columbia, for their creative writing program. He already had his entire path mapped out, all the way through courses and
He wasn’t sure how he knew, already, what Dean tasted like, what flavor was distinctly his. But somehow, he did know, as their tongues chased and teased. He knew that at its very base, this kiss tasted of the gorgeous man.
So on the seventh day, he decided to put a stop to this. Obviously M. Winchester was misinformed about his circumstances. That was probably Cas’s own fault; he never wore any of his fine clothes anymore, hadn’t since his mother had left. Today though, he donned a blue waistcoat that brought out his eyes and brightened his complexion.
He trailed off for a moment then seemed to catch himself and glanced back at Dean. “Growing up, Ana told me stories about them.” He nodded toward Dean. “You’ve probably heard some version of it. They formed this world, imbued it with the magic to create and sustain life.”
“This shit has to stop,” he muttered, almost to himself. But he knew that it wasn’t to himself, not really. He’d said it to the man currently sitting in the armchair in the corner.
“Not the cat...the key.” She grinned manically. “And if I did shoot you, you know no one would do anything about it. They might even give me an award!”
"I'm not," Dean promised, emphasizing the words with a slow roll of his hips. Castiel cried out as Dean began thrusting again, his body spasming under the bigger boy's as Dean drove them both to their orgasm.
He said it so off-handedly, keeping a watchful eye over the floor, but Dean immediately latched onto the line. It was the first time Cas had ever referred to Lucifer by name.
Cas knew the other kids at school were envious of how he always got into the college parties. He kind of hated it, though. He was, at best, his idiot cousin’s babysitter for the night and designated driver for the times Gabe didn’t manage to talk his way into someone else’s bed. But somehow, with the Playboy Bunny costume Gabe wore, Cas knew he’d find someone tonight.
“I should go get my soda before it’s too late to escape,” Cas joked and hurried away. Dean stared after him, his mind whirling. What had he been about to say?
Castiel considered leaving it at that; they'd both apologized, the air was clear. But what Crowley had suggested wasn't actually half bad. Drawing im a deep breath, Castiel ruled out his offer before he could lose his nerve.
Castiel chuckled. "I think I already crossed that one off the list. Ow!" He smacked Charlie's hand away when she pinched his ear. She smiled at him expectantly, and he smirked. "Fuck 'im!"
The skies darkened and a sonorous explosion shook the very ground beneath him as lightning crackled across the sky. It was done: Hannah had completed the spell.
The others seemed to grow aware of the danger as well. With little prompting, the bedraggled group shuffled back through to the room with the mural. Dean scooped Ana up in his arms and followed Cas and the others up to the stairs beneath the altar, back out to the fading light of the Italian sunset.
“Maxwell’s brother is the chief treasurer, self-explanatory. Thomas, the alpha,” Dean wiggled his eyebrows at that, causing Sam to snort out a laugh. “owns the shipping yard nearest the docks.”
Fifteen minutes later, just as he started to wonder if something had happened, Anna rushed into the room.
“You’re no supreme of mine!” Kazimir argued, but suddenly his voice was deeper, distorted, heavy with screams and fire. Finally, with that one sentence, he revealed the truth: whatever was in that body was not actually Kazimir.
He chuckled. The whole time he’d been watching Cas, Cas had been watching him. “Cop through and through,” he muttered.
It wasn't that he was embarrassed. It was that he didn't want Crowley to disagree with what Dean had said. Right now, those words that Dean had spoken were his, and his alone. There was one person who thought, misguidedly of course, that Castiel wasn't a total whore. Castiel didn't want to ruin that.
"Do that again! Again!" Castiel pleaded. Dean complied, ramming his hips up again to meet Castiel's downward thrust. Castiel picked up his pace, his entire body shaking.
“Huh?” Castiel looked back up to find Dean watching him. “Oh, we wondered why you didn’t bring an ambassador. It’s because you’re the royal family ambassador, right?”
Cas ignored him in favor of signing yet another form. He loved his job, but fuck if the paperwork didn’t kill him.
He pointed to Meg, then pointed toward the front of the house. She nodded and slipped away into the darkness. Dean wasn’t sure where she’d get a gown to blend in, but he had no doubt she would make due.
Brady shook his head. “No man, I’m here on a legit date. Besides, why the hell would he send anyone to check up on
Dean shoved his shoulder, causing him to stumble a few steps, but he quickly fell back in line next to Dean, this time taking his hand and entwining their fingers. Dean blushed for an entirely different reason.
“Uh, Cas?” Dean said, poking said sleeping former angel in the arm. Cas cracked an eye open to peer up at him. “Not that I don’t love that you decided to stay in the bunker with us, but what the hell are you doing in my bed with me?”
“Dammit, Cas, you gotta be more careful,” Dean told him after Cas had finally admitted what had happened. They had just locked the front door after the last patron left when Dean had spotted the bandage Cas had wrapped around his thumb which had taken the brunt of the burn.
“No thanks to you,” Bobby replied. “Dean didn’t know he was telling me new information. I think he figured that you’d already told me. Having been with her for three years now.”
“Nah, that’d ruin the mystery,” Dean laughed and put an arm around Cas’ shoulders. He remembered at the last minute how gross and sweaty he was, but it was too late to change tact now. Besides, Cas was just as sweaty as he was. In this heat, it’d be impossible not to be.
Cas couldn’t hear the response on the other end, but he assumed it was something to his mother’s liking because she thanked the principal once more before finally ending the call. His mother’s heels made thunks on the hardwood floor, so Cas knew he only had moments before he was discovered. He quickly dashed across the hall, sliding the last few feet on his socks, before flinging himself into his room and onto his bed. He grabbed a book and opened it to a random page as his mother walked into view in his doorway and knocked on the door jamb.
“I’m not trying to be the bad guy here,” John told him and Dean couldn’t keep in his snort. “I’m just trying to look out for you. I don’t think you understand just how bad this situation is, Dean. You should be killing that thing, not fucking it.”
Dean ignored him and kept walking until he was standing right in front of Cas, blocking him in against the counter.
“Alright, alright,” Dean said, stretching an arm around Cas’ shoulders. “I think our significant others are getting bored.”
“Dude, it’s a surprise,” Dean told him. “Just relax and enjoy the music.” Dean leaned forward and turned up the volume.
?” Dean let out a snort. “John Winchester is never twenty minutes late unless he’s up to something.”
“I lo…” Cas started, but found that the rest of his short statement got caught in his throat. This was much harder than he had anticipated. He should have given Sam much more credit for coming clean. Perhaps he should have even prepared himself in front of a mirror. “I,” he tried again, but that was even less successful than his first attempt.
Sam and Mary both laughed, while Dean's face turned an even brighter shade of red than it had been before. "Cas!" he hissed.
“Speaking of,” Cas said. “Did you really want to go to Benny’s tonight, or was that just another excuse?”
“Of course,” Cas replied, walking further into the living room and stopping a few feet away from Sam.
Charlie nodded with a shrug as she found a chocolate muffin. Dean picked out a cinnamon swirl and blueberry for himself and Cas. But when Charlie began walking back to their table, Dean remained where he was.
He was so drunk he didn’t even notice his soul reaching out and finding another, not that he would have really known what was happening. He may, however, have been slightly more amenable to the dark haired man walking with purpose towards the empty stool next to him.
It was a week before Bobby called them back. Sam had eventually gone home to catch up on all of his schoolwork, but promised to be only a phone call away if dad came back, which, luckily, hadn’t been necessary so far.
“Probably still a normal one,” Cas said, trying to wade through the balloons to get to his wardrobe. Dean’s first dozen or so balloons had trouble retaining their ability to float, though Dean had nailed it on the last three dozen.
“Until I have to get back in the car. I didn’t even realize how cramped they were. I’m not meant to hide them for so long. And now that our house is no longer a safe place—“
“Why did we only bring one stupid holy water knife?” she demanded angrily. “And why are the stupid woods so dark at night?”
“Oh, don’t you start, too,” Dean snapped. “It wasn’t real. It was jerks in a costume!” He looked back and forth between Cas and Charlie, the former glaring, the latter looking slightly apologetic but determined. He turned to Jo. “Do you believe in the stupid thing?”
Cas shook his head. “I can run to the corner and grab a six pack.” He stood up from the table and began walking towards the door, but Dean grabbed his sleeve and held him back.
Cas leaned down and stopped a breath away from Dean’s lips. “With food,” he corrected. “The things I want to do to you will require more time than a simple lunch break can provide.”
Cas slid across the bench seat and took Dean’s face in his hands, looking at him with such sadness. It wasn’t pity, never pity. It was one of the things Dean loved most about Cas.
“Because he’s the only other one involved.” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a huff of frustration. “You said you were letting this go.”
The blood drained from Dean’s face and his breathing came more quickly. He felt the beginnings of a panic attack coming on and without Cas’ soothing voice he couldn’t remember how to stop it. The pounding in his head increased as he heard the rush of blood through his racing heart amplified tenfold in his ears. He couldn’t catch a breath, he was going to suffocate, he couldn’t get any air into his lungs.
He rushed to the bathroom as soon as the bell rang, announcing the end of school and the start of the dance, the start of his
“Move!” Cas shouted, shoving Dean away and leaving himself in the path to get hit by what he could now see was the winged humanoid form of his adversary who was
“Come on, Sammy,” he said. “You didn’t think we’d actually wear those things outside, did you? In public?” He dissolved into laughter again.
“Dad, you can’t do this!” Dean tried yet again, but his father continued to ignore him, chanting something from a large leather tome. “Dad, I swear he’s not doing anything to me. I love him, okay! I love—“
Dean kept his eye roll in check, mainly because he was too focused on Cas and the fact that he was about to go over and potentially ruin their friendship. He took one more deep breath.
“Fine,” he said and with that he got up and marched into his room, slamming the door behind himself. He flung himself onto his bed, pulled a pillow over his head and screamed himself hoarse. It was only after he felt lightheaded that he sat up and grabbed the phone he kept on his bedside table.
So, really, he wasn’t worried. Not until there was a weird sort of tingle that went from his head to his gut. It was similar to how it felt when Dean used magic, though Cas had just barely been able to pinpoint that feeling during their daily classes while he was on the lookout for it. Every time either one of them used magic, the spell buzzed through their connection, gathering as much magic as it needed as it went. But this was…
Dean rolled his eyes. “So you’re just, what? Going to miss school this week working on dad’s wild goose chase? Isn’t this what you ran away from in the first place?”
Dean let out an unattractive snort. “You obviously don’t know the kid. He doesn’t give things up.” He shook his head. “This is why he wanted to stay with Bobby. He wanted to confront my dad.”
worked. And now Dean was stuck fighting some insane looking vulture creature who had half of its feathers missing but somehow made up for it in teeth.
Dean leaned over and kissed him, tasting the leftover saltiness from the bacon. “Pretty sure the feeling’s mutual.”
Dean sighed and prepared himself for a repeat of last period, although knowing Jo, with much more swearing and punches.
Dean realized then that the odd wheezing sound he heard beneath the roaring in his ears was his own breathing.
“No, Cas, don’t—” Dean took a step forward, hand reaching out for him, but seemed to think better of it and stopped halfway, letting his arm fall uselessly back to his side.
“Oh, you know,” Gabe said airily, waving his hand around. “Just checking up on my baby bro and making sure I won’t have to raise any teen pregnancy babies.”
, despite the fact that he sees her every day at school and has barely seen Dean these past couple of months. It’s not a big deal. Not a big deal at all.
“You are a moron. And you’re only half forgiven so don’t push your luck.” Cas walked brusquely past Dean. “Now let’s go. Charlie is making steak and I’m hungry.”
Sam followed Dean out of the kitchen, also apparently done with his breakfast even though he’d only eaten half.
The next few days were awkward with just the two of them alone together again. Neither seemed to be able to stay in the same room with the other for more than a few minutes. Dean had become withdrawn and distant, and Cas couldn’t help but to notice that they were going through their stash of whiskey faster than normal.
“Well, it’s not school either,” Dean told him. “Interrogate us on Monday. Come on, Cas.” He walked over and began leading the way out the door.
“Veritaserum,” Sam blurted and then smacked his hands over his mouth. His eyes widened in horror as he realized Dean had switched the drinks when his back had been turned.
In retrospect, Cas knew it had been a horrible idea to lie to Balthazar about Dean being his boyfriend. He should have chosen Sam, or Garth. Hell, Bobby would have been better than this.
His adversary reached both of its spindly arms out to his sides and Castiel smiled. He just loved to telegraph his moves loud and clear.
“I had a very good time today,” Cas told him once they were standing on the porch in the light of the barely setting sun.
Castiel chewed the top of his pen cap, hesitating a moment before he decided to throw caution to the winds.
“And why do you think that?” the male detective asked, making a note in his little notepad without taking his eyes from Dean. It didn’t seem like he was trying to be mean, Dean was sure he was just doing his job, but the question still made him set his jaw into a defiant frown.
He sounded so utterly bewildered that Castiel tilted his head to the side to stare at him in confusion. “For what other reason would anyone bake a pie?”
Dean let out a little laugh. “Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but don’t you think you should let Cas field that question?”
The image of his father sent him back to the motel the night Sammy had left. The yellowing wallpaper, stale smell of cigarettes and whiskey, the rough and tattered carpeting. He flinched in anticipation for the next blow but when it came the sting on his cheek was weaker than he had expected.
He plopped down in Dean’s desk chair and flicked the lamp on before grabbing the textbook and flipping it to chapter fourteen.
“Dean!” Cas called as he swapped his jacket for an apron, black with a white outline of a slice of pie on the front.
They spent their time lounging, swimming, and eating. Dean had even managed to fit a cake into the cooler beneath the sandwiches and sodas.
But that was all beside the point. To repeat: Dean was kicking ass. Cas (he was assuming it had to be him anyway) had given him weird turquoise green fins on his arms and legs in addition to the gills and super awesome wings. And those things let him glide through the water with a precision equal to his movements on land. With his machete in hand he sliced through everything Cas’ adversary threw at him. Literally.
Dean turned to him with a smile, keeping his eyes off the road for far longer than was prudent. When he finally faced front again, he took one hand off of the steering wheel and laid it on the seat between them, palm up in invitation.
Dean took a deep breath and let it out. He could do this. He could push the total, soul crushing agony he was feeling way deep down, bury it under ten pounds of denial and his usual cocky grin. He gave Cas a pat on the shoulder. “Good talk,” he said. “But now I gotta pee. Save me a spot in the snack line?”
“He didn’t want to burden you,” Cas said. “And I suspect he didn’t want his life to be even more difficult than it already was.”
Dean lowered his hands and blinked the spots out of his eyes. “It’s all good,” he said. “I take it you’re excited about the s’mores?”
Dean just bumped his hip with his own where they stood at the sink. “No problem, babe. You know I like to feed you.”
“Eh, not super noble,” Dean said. “I mean, by the point you’ll realize you’ll need the therapy we’ll probably have a joint bank account, so really, I’m just looking out for my own money.”
Then her mother Ellen stepped forward, and Cas offered the older lady a smirk, holding out his hand. “Section Chief Harvelle.” She just rolled her eyes and pulled him into a tight hug instead.
Much to his surprise, the rest of the day went fairly well. He aced a test he thought he’d failed, he listened to Charlie go on and on about Gilda, and he spent some more time with Dean. But he knew that he still needed to talk to Crowley, clear the air between them...especially after that little incident with Gordon in the hallway.
Green eyes flashed through his mind. He felt a flutter in his chest. If he wasn't mistaken, this meant New Boy had found his way up to the abandoned bathroom.
“But your eyes,” Benny mumbled, the calm in the midst of the storm rising between the other two men. Cas looked at him and a blue wave passed over his face, then his features were his own again, blue eyes without a hint of gold.
They didn’t know where he’d gone or how he would survive there, given that he’d taken almost nothing with him. In fact, he’d left
“My uncle left it to me,” he explained. “It’s good for doing that communion with nature shit, but it’s still pretty fancy. Electricity, back-up generator, plumbing.”
“I’m sorry to have kept you waiting,” he murmured. He let his eyes linger on her mouth for just a moment before pretending to shake himself. “I’ll just head back to see him now?”
“We’re almost there,” Charlie tried to reassure him. “Just like five more minutes. We can think of a plan of attack.”
He whipped his phone out and texted Sam what was happening. He toyed with the idea of telling Cas as well, but eventually decided against having Cas storm down here in a fit of rage and accidentally on purpose kill his father.
It raised its foot off of Dean’s back only to stomp back down, hard. Dean let out a cry and felt at least one rib snap.
“Stay here,” Sam told Charlie before chasing after Cas, leaving the car running in his haste. He ran, slipping in the dirt, but managing to stay on his feet as he saw Cas disappear into the decrepit barn. He was only seconds behind and therefore saw the exact moment that Cas bounced off of some invisible barrier, the rebound sending him crashing into and through a wall of the barn.
“Nah,” Dean said. “He was wearing me down, though. Another couple of days and there would have been a mutt running around the bunker.”
are you?” Dean often reverted to tactlessness when stressed, and he was definitely stressed. Castiel was totally an alien’s name.
Dean shrugged. “According to you, maybe. But he treats me better than you ever have.” He took Cas’ hand and held it tightly. “If I have to ask you to leave again, I’m going to let Cas do it.”
Dean sighed and rested their foreheads together. “Babe, I just don’t want him to find out what you are.”
“Chill out, broski. And to think, I’ve been running interference with our parents this whole time.” He shook his head and clucked his tongue. “So, anyway, tell me about this master plan to woo your not-boyfriend.”
The door ricocheted off the wall when he pushed it open, but he ignored it and marched into his house.
“You’re expecting to get a quiet fishing trip?” Dean asked him, electing to just ignore the last part of his statement. “You do realize Gabe is the one taking you, right?”
Dean hummed. “Let’s just go with ‘gorgeous as hell’ and call it a day,” he said, rolling on top of Cas and leaning down to capture his lips again.
“Sam,” Dean cut him off. “Drop it. It’s fine, alright? But if you try to get me to talk about this one more time, I swear I am going to snap and probably punch you in the face.”
“Ah, the famous Gilda,” Dean said as the three of them made their way into the house. “Where is she?”
“We’re going to find him, Dean,” Cas said, coming up from behind him and slipping their hands together.
“Well, I didn’t think it was going to be this hot!” Sam protested. “And you were going to the park anyway. It’s not like I made you go.”
It was Cas’ favorite part of the day. Shoulder to shoulder with his best friend (their closeness excused as platonic since they needed to share the body warmth in this chilly weather), staring up into the inky darkness dotted with a handful of stars, as if some preschooler had gotten stingy with the glitter. Cas wasn’t exactly an astronomy buff, but he did love staring up into that staggering depth and wishing he could exist in it.
“Maybe you should think about getting some reading glasses,” Cas told him, noticing how Dean was squinting with a paper an inch from his face.
Sam laughed, refusing to admit that Ansem’s story about the yellow eyed monster still gave him nightmares.
“How are you not dead?” Dean blurted. He assumed the answer was alien, but at the same time he wasn’t sure he was prepared to hear the man admit to it.
“You scared me last night, Sam,” she said with a shake of her head. “I didn’t like seeing you like that. And I don’t like that
Dean looked down. “Dad said I could borrow books from the library, that you had extra sets for kids who can’t afford ‘em.”
Surprisingly, Dean didn’t have a retort and actually seemed to try and take his advice. He unclenched his fists and wiped his palms off on his jeans. He attempted a smile.
Cas shook his head. “You’re offering this to me now? After all these years of fighting? My whole life has been spent fighting you and now you think I’ll join you?”
Castiel smiled. “It has been a while since I’ve done that. Can we skip the hunt and get straight to the flying?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said into his shoulder. “You’d think I’d have stopped being such a monumental fuck up by now, huh?”
“I said not to call me out here to bother me, which we both know you were doing on purpose.” Dean looked away sheepishly at that. Cas continued, “I didn’t say not to call me if it was something you truly needed.” He leaned in and gave Dean a kiss. “Where were you trying to go, anyway?”
He spent the next few minutes staring at the board in a mindless haze, and before he knew it he was writing again.
“Morning, Cas,” Dean said, pouring another cup of coffee and handing it over to a still bleary eyed Cas.
“I don’t know!” Dean exploded. “But I do know that Sam is freaking out. And I don’t blame him. He was sleepwalking the other night. I caught him trying to leave. His hand was on the doorknob and everything, so what am I supposed to believe, Jo? That Sam suddenly started sleepwalking for shits and giggles? That he just happened to develop this problem after he saw a monster in the woods, and then his friends started disappearing from their homes in the middle of the night with no sign of a break-in or anything?”
The yellow orbs got bigger and started coming closer. It was only then that they saw that they weren’t just floating eyes like the Cheshire Cat, but attached to a humanoid body so twisted and emaciated that in the dark it looked just like another towering sapling.
Dean shrugged like it was nothing, but Cas could feel his relief like it was palpable. “Yeah, you’re welcome, buddy.”
Dean rolled his eyes and tried to extricate himself again. “This must be what a fricken caterpillar feels like,” he muttered.
Dean, face the color of his scarlet quidditch robes he so proudly wore, jumped up from his position half across the table and walked as quickly as his feet would take him out of the Great Hall.
“It means my dad was the one giving him those bruises.” He took a deep breath and exploded with, “And I
“I don’t know, not since that first night,” Dean said. “But I don’t think he would just leave like this.”
Cas stared in horror at what he had just inked onto the page and scribbled it out until it looked like a black scar marring the page. His heart pounded in his chest and he had to keep up a litany of “he won’t see, he won’t see,” in his head until it calmed.
I did good with dealing. I was handsome enough, charming enough...it got me in a lot of doors that had been closed before. I started dealing to the rich kids at Sammy’s fancy school, which got me into their parties, in with their hottest girls...and then in about eleventh grade, in with their hottest guys too.
Long after Dean had moved on to deal with business in other parts of the compound, Castiel sat in his rocking chair, thinking things over. He smiled at the thought of those kind, green eyes and that ready smile. Those broad shoulders and that tight—
“I just...don't you hate having to hide? Like, always having to conform to her standards and rules?”
Dean kissed Castiel’s warm skin right behind his ear, and Castiel leaned into the touch. He turned his big doe eyes on Dean, his smile pleading, and Dean couldn't help but return that smile. He'd promised Castiel a bed, and fuck if it hadn't been hard on them, literally and figuratively.
“I don’t know, man,” Sam answered. “It looked like he...” he turned away away and muttered, “This is going to sound so stupid.” He looked back at Dean. “It looked like he sucked the pain out of you.”
As Castiel settled in beside Leah, he smiled across at Anna. “How were things in the infirmary today?”
Castiel slowly lifted his gaze to meet his uncle’s. Instead of answering, he posed a question: “Why did the FBI send in one of their top agents to scout us out?”
boring…especially in bed. Which he proved again and again and again. And every time, he’d cuddle Dean after and scent him, still as addicted as ever.
“Seven?” Uriel sounded dubious, and Cas found himself once again wishing that punching one’s Europol supervisor in the face didn’t carry such a hefty penalty.
“Detective, actually,” Cas corrected, his tone smug as he leaned back against the desk, his long legs crossed at the ankles, his arms folded over his chest.
Dean laughed wickedly and leaned forward to press his lips to Castiel's, a pressure that Castiel returned readily. He opened his mouth for Dean, allowing the other boy's tongue to invade. He suddenly pulled away, and Dean's brow furrowed in confusion, but then Castiel was clambering onto his lap. Dean sighed with contentment as his hands settled on Castiel's hips.
“I can’t believe how well you’re handling the goddess thing,” Cas admitted. His bright golden eyes studied Dean. “I mean, I wouldn’t be hurt if you had questions or, um...needed some time to…”
"Your body's so sculpted," he breathed into Dean's mouth. "Like a marble statue." He pressed another wet kiss to Dean's lips. "How?"
And nope, Dean Winchester did not do that. I had a good thing going with dealing, getting paid and getting laid from both teams. One cute guy who was...you know, a perf—nope, not perfect. Just nice or good or something. Yeah, that was it: one cute guy who’d kissed
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” Cas, smiling sweetly, ran his fingers over a folder in his hands.
Lucifer sighed, somehow making it sound both tired and longsuffering. “And why not? How can you possibly know that?”
“You have done enough damage, Kazimir,” he yelled, and then Dean could hear no more as he rose higher in the air.
“Where is my son?” she screeched. “What have you done?” She lifted her hands, ready to shoot at the purple cloud. “I will send you right back!”
Now, he was elbows-deep in an old disagreement between two families long extinct. No one would benefit from this research, but it kept his mind busy enough to ignore the thrumming pain in his chest, the swirling thoughts in his mind, the irritating flare in his belly.
Long minutes passed, but Castiel found he no longer could just sit and mope. He had his chance to talk, to maybe connect, with the beautiful man who was driving him further insane by the minute.
“Dean,” Castiel cut him off. “What you said the other night was about as dumb as what I’ve been saying all week.”
“Of course,” Castiel murmured, desperately trying to ignore the blush staining his cheeks. “I just...I understand.”
“Naomi and Chuck are going out of town for Thanksgiving,” he finally whispered. “She didn’t even ask me to go. I mean, kinda but not really.”
Cas shook his head. “No, I don’t believe we were. And now that we have, the universe can’t reconcile it.”
Crowley glanced around quickly to make sure that no one was standing too close to hear his next words, rushed out. "I heard about what you did to Gordon yesterday, how you stood your own.." He hesitated for a moment. "I'm proud of you, for standing up to him."
“Tell me, is the deep cover going to involve throwing yourself under some new alpha, just for the sake of—“
With a long suffering sigh, Cas trailed Balth and Anna into the football stadium. He hated sports—hated football especially—but they’d dragged him here with the promise to leave halfway through for pizza. As they walked past the back of the bleachers, he happened to glance over, and drew up short when he saw a familiar figure leaning there in the shadows—a familiar figure whose green gaze was locked right on Cas.
“I didn’t know!” He bit out. “I promise I didn’t, but now that I’m here, I’m going to make things right.”
"See, you lay another hand on me, I'll scream rape so loud they'll hear it clear over at that nice little college of yours. And you know they won't take a chance on someone with a record," he shrugged like it didn't matter one way or the other. "Maybe they'd go to bat for one of their seniors who's proven himself, but for an incoming freshman? Nah! And especially not after Crowley leaks that information to the school board about your little drug habit."
"Cas?" Dean whispered as one of Castiel's hands slid up his chest to cup the back of his neck. He began to tug Dean's head down toward him.
When they reached the car, Dean reached down for the door handle, but Castiel stopped him with a gentle hand on his arm. He leaned back against the car, his eyes heavy lidded on Dean's face as he tugged the taller boy in by his belt loops.
The Dowager had once been one of his mother’s closest friends. Over the years, she’d visited the estate again and again, each time nodding approvingly at their treatment of Hannah, claiming it was “so good of you to let her earn her keep!” Now that everything had changed, the old woman had done all she could to distance herself from that past.
“You can change your face?” Meg asked, seemingly not concerned in the least that Castiel had chosen her face for his demonstration.
Castiel shifted Kaiden from one hip to the other and smiled ruefully. “It’s what I’m used to, and if I keep busy...”
It started out a daylike any other...but then again, that’s always how those days start out: no warning, no anticipation. Just a regular day.
Minutes dragged by, the afternoon fading into evening as Cas and Dean kept exchanging whispers and gasps and more kisses.
Castiel shrugged. "It's not the first time. Won't be the last.” Dean studied him intently, obviously with something contradictory on the tip of his tongue. Castiel didn't want another heart to heart, not so soon after Dean had witnessed the truth of who Castiel was, of
Cas blushed gently. “I should hope so, after almost two years!” His smile turned wicked. “I know everything about you, including a multitude of ways to make you forget about that empty stomach.”
“I thought it was hilarious,” he replied, more gasps than words. I bit low on his neck, low enough for him to hide, and he keened loudly. His hips seemed to move on their own as he bucked into my hand. “Is this my punishment then? I really was expecting more, since I did just give Brady a free look at your dick.”
a 1077 is,” Uriel cut in, sounding the teensiest bit annoyed. Cas smirked in triumph at his success. “I want to know why you filed it.”
Jess rolled her eyes, but she still swung by the office to sign him out. When she saw him before last hour, he looked a little dazed.
More shuffling, and then Dean heard the door open, meaning that Cas was headed back down. He exited the password-protected app and pocketed his phone as he rushed back inside to wait for Cas at the bar where they’d parted earlier.
Dean blinked, then offered a tight smile. “Of course not. I was just about to go grab another drink anyways.” He tinkled the ice in his glass.
Panic surged in Dean’s mind. He’d only just gotten to see Cas again after months of worry and loneliness. He’d been here with Cas for mere minutes and had stupidly spent most of those arguing.
He’d also known that, given half the chance, he’d happily let Dean beat the shit out of Brady for waking them up at 3 in the morning. But even that could be forgiven, since it’d led to sex in the Impala in an abandoned parking lot. Plus what kind of dumbasses would they be if they turned down
“My lord,” Winchester interrupted. “It’s a forest, it’s open to anyone.” He took a step forward, but still the entire clearing separated them. “Please, continue with your sketches. I’d just like to tend to the flowers, so long as I’m not in your way.”
“I’m here to help you,” Castiel replied softly, his tone so at odds with his eyes. Because even with the red eyes and heavy scent, Dean could sense the restraint the apha was using to hold himself back.
He suddenly felt Dean’s hand curling around his jaw, holding him in place as the bigger boy leaned forward to whisper in his ear.
Dean tried to strike up a conversation with Castiel on the ride back, just to learn more about him, his powers—the sack he wouldn’t relinquish for even a moment. All of his responses remained flat, monosyllabic until Dean finally just gave up and returned to his seat. With a huff of wounded pride, he pulled out his phone to glance at the old picture of Lisa.
“I think that gives us plenty of time, don’t you?” Cas had whispered as he yanked Dean into a hungry kiss that promised so much more.
When Cas woke in the morning, blinking his eyes open with the early sun, he turned to check on the cat.
All of them, all of those people had known what his mother was doing to Hannah. They’d known the entire time and done nothing, and now that guilt pushed them to unload as much as they could onto Cas. There was no kindness, no pity for the man who’d lost everything, absolutely
Castiel glanced at him skeptically. Sure, he was saying that now, but what about next week when he was still being shunned. Obviously this boy was too stubborn for his own good.
He considered approaching them, but he could tell how wrapped up they were in each other, in themselves as a whole. He didn’t want to ruin that. He smirked at his own sentimentality; it had happened more and more since he’d started seeing Dean...
“Well, news certainly does travel fast,” Castiel muttered, leaning back in his chair. He crossed his legs, folded his hands in his lap. It was a false confidence, he knew, but it still helped, even if just in his own chest.
But despite that sharpness that had sucked me in, I learned that he could be so damn soft too. He made such pretty sounds when I had him under me in my backseat, gasping as I slid my tongue against his, moaning as I nipped at his neck, begging me for more.
“Anna, I’ll be right with you,” Cas assured her as he passed the open door of her office and headed for his own door.
Dean frowned, as if surprised by the question. “Of course not! If anything, it proves to me that this is real. It just took a while for me to admit it.”
Lucifer’s lips pursed, gaging his response, before his expression smoothed back over. “I didn’t take anything from the job.”
“Awesome,” Castiel whispered. By now, they were so close, practically nose to nose, so it felt only natural to tip his head forward that little bit and claim Dean’s mouth with his. It hadn't been too long since they'd last kissed, only a couple of days, but the relief that coursed through each of them as their lips became reacquainted was so sweet.
Harvelle’s smirk grew, and Cas had the uncomfortable feeling that he hadn’t kept his expression as unreadable as he’d hoped. He gestured back toward the holding cells, eager to get this over with. “They’re back this way.”
” Sam clapped Dean on the back as he struggled to regain his breath. When the coughing subsided and his tears cleared, Cas stood only a few feet away, talking to Jo about her new internship.
He trailed off as Castiel’s gaze drifted past him, back out to the city lights. The younger man stepped toward the giant window even as his expression turned distant, almost as if he wasn’t looking at the city at all.
“So your experimentation is that you’re actually going to date a guy for the first time?” Sam guessed.
"I wanna see you," Dean whispered. Castiel smirked and tugged his shirt over his head, exposing his smooth chest, and tossed it away. He stood and undid his belt and jeans, slowly pushing them down his legs. Dean groaned when he caught sight of the little green panties Castiel wore.
As Castiel stepped up beside Crowley, the alpha slid a beefy arm around his slimmer frame and pulled Castiel tight against his side. Dean saw the back of the top Cas wore was open, leaving acres of tan skin on view.
Dean tried to keep his expression neutral, but his mind was whirling. What could sweet, kind Castiel have done to deserve such drastic action?
He almost went to Dean, not even entirely sure of what he wanted to do or say, but then his arm was being grabbed by someone from behind. He turned to find Michael, who held him back as the others passed through.
He slipped over to the bed and smiled gently at the groggy face on the pillow, settling himself on the edge of the bed.
But looking back over the all-too-brief conversation they’d just had, there’d been none of the old Castiel there. The old Cas had smiled at Dean like he hung the stars, had taken Dean apart so perfectly that last night, had given literally every part of himself to Dean, only to have it all crushed to bits when Dean had laughed right along with that damn reporter...
Castiel nodded groggily as his finger inched toward the door. Dean's eyes tracked his finger, wary and anxious. Castiel pressed the button.
“They’re doing great! A few of them are still unsure of what’s happening, but that might be for the best...”
of Asia. All just like the Castilleja Cas had seen in M. Winchester’s basket...And that very flower grew tall and vibrant in the center of the wildflower garden.
“What do you think, Estelle?” Castiel prodded gently. The older woman turned awestruck eyes to him, and Castiel felt that swell of triumph in his chest. He knew that this was a done deal.
Dean knew they were dancing. He knew their feet were moving in perfect sync as they followed the familiar steps of the waltz. He knew this, but he didn’t really notice, given how focused he remained on his alpha.
Home...yes, that word had slipped through his mind, but it hadn’t brought memories of his parents or a younger Sam or even of Lisa. All he’d been able to think of, was Cas.
Castiel glared at him. "Why didn't you just ask me? Huh? Why did you assume? It was a joke! But obviously, Castiel can’t joke about stuff like that. Nooooo." He shook his head sadly
Dean shook his head. “No, I don’t want you to forget a single second of what we’ve gone through…but I am asking you to give me another shot. If you let me back in your life, I promise, it won’t ever happen again.”
Dean chuckled. “Nah, that’s Rufus. I’m just good at connecting the dots for my dad, helping him find new opportunities.”
Castiel glared at him, half in anger, half in disbelief. Why the hell was some gorgeous asshole so concerned about this anyway? He didn't even know Castiel.
Dean chuckled. "You mean to tell me that you, sex fiend extraordinaire, manage to keep your extra-curricular activities hidden from mommy-dearest?"
As they neared Dean’s room, Cas kept his eyes downward, focused on the children. He didn’t want to see that closed door, didn’t want to think about what was happening inside.
“That’s great,“ he praised, despite the dread that pooled in his gut. Cas wasn’t the fastest-rising officer in his unit for no reason…he’d figure it out eventually.
"Look, it's not just... I mean... He keeps saying stuff like this, and it's not true! Like," he lowered his voice to imitate Dean, "'you deserve more than a fuck in a bathroom, Cas,' and 'you deserved more than just being Victor's thing on the side' and...and it's not true!"
Castiel smiled ruefully, studying their joined hands now. "And when I met you, I thought it would be as simple as that. Altering myself to be who you wanted me to be. But it wasn't. Because you didn't want just that part of me." He finally looked up at Dean, his eyes damp. "You wanted all of me."
Castiel’s eyes widened, his mouth dropping open as he stumbled a step back. Only now did Dean notice the gold glinting in his eyes.
Henriksen cleared his throat, glanced down at his glass. “He seemed fine,” he looked back up to meet Dean’s gaze. “A little shaken, but I attributed that to hitting his head.” He frowned and shook his head. “I wouldn’t worry about it.“
Castiel giggled and nipped at his lower lip. "Not that I don't love the mouth to mouth, but we are on a limited time-frame here..."
“So sorry I’m late!” Meg drawled as she threw herself into the chair Pierre was suddenly pulling out for her. Castiel’s gaze flew to meet hers, as did Hester’s, and the tenuous moment ended. The distraction was (gratefully) all but forgotten as Hester zeroed in on her new target.
you’re asking the right questions.” Slowly, she pulled a large manila envelope from her bag and set it down on the table beside the case. “This,” she pointed to the envelope, “is for you. After I leave, you’ll want to look through it.”
Dean curled up tight, trying to shield his head, neck, and torso from the relentless attack. And then, the attack stopped.
Castiel floundered. He’d expected anger. He’d expected Crowley to lecture for being so stupid as to let Dean back in after he’d slept with Bela. He’d expected a lot of things, but disinterest was not one of them. Crowley sensed this and sighed.
He talked about the day the prince came for Hannah, watching them ride away in that grand carriage. He told it about how Hannah insisted that him and his mother and sister go to the wedding. He could barely manage a whisper as he told the cat about that final secret tryst…
Gabriel rolled his eyes. "Point is," he continued. "Mom and dad put me in charge while they're away on their little Valentine's cruise and I'm not about to get in trouble for you having a mental breakdown on my watch. So come on," he slung an arm around Cas' shoulder and shook him. "Tell Uncle Gabey what the problem is."
Silence settled between them as Dean finished his drink. He set the empty glass down a little harder than strictly necessary, but he had finally stopped shaking.
“Because, I mean, I get it. I don’t want to hunt anymore either, but dad has never tried to get me to go back. I mean, yeah, I have to deal with the disappointment and occasional yelling over stupid shit, but he only calls in like once every three months.”
“Oh my god, I didn’t even think of that,” Dean said, horrified. He grabbed Cas by the hand and began dragging him over to the pizza line, jostling and bumping into the crowds of dancers as they went.
“Well I don’t know what to tell you, Cas.” Dean shrugged. “I guess I’m just not big on the whole pda thing.”
Sam thought about it. He needed to figure out who was telling the truth. It didn’t really take him too long. Actions speak louder than words, right?
“Come on Cas, I said I was sorry,” Dean said, trying for his best puppy dog look. He wasn’t quite sure it worked.
Sam sat at his desk chair, staring out his window at the sun setting over the woods, all purples and pinks with a hint of orange.
“A guy can’t be happy to have breakfast with his older brother?” Sam asked, feigning hurt with a hand over his heart and everything.
“Those are fighting words, Novak,” Dean said with a grin, setting the drinks and snacks down. He tried to take up his old seat on the other end of the couch but found Charlie sprawled there, munching on her own bag of chips, trying and failing to look nonchalant and innocent.
“Just tell me what I don’t know here, Dean,” Sam said. “I mean, I’ve realized that I must have missed stuff when we were growing up, but—“
Cas turned towards the staircase and began making his way up. Gabriel had tried confronting him that morning about his dream, but Cas had taken off in such a hurry he didn’t even think he’d said a word to Gabe on his way out. Cas was not looking forward to the conversation they were surely about to have.
Sam’s sweater lit up, too. It was blue with a giant cartoon moose on the front, beads of light strung around the antlers. He looked for about five minutes, but he couldn’t find any sort of switch to turn the lights off. He grimaced as he pulled it on over his head. It was warm where the lights glowed brightly on his chest. That had to be a fire hazard. He was going to be pissed if he’d survived monsters and demons this long to be taken out by the ugliest sweater on the planet.
In the end they waited to go on vacation until Sam was done with school for the year and surprised him and Jess with an island getaway. He tried inviting Charlie and Gilda, but Gilda beat him to the punch by surprising Charlie with tickets to the San Diego Comic-Con, so in the end it wasn’t really a choice for her.
“I care about you,” Sam said. “Sue me.” He held up a hand to keep Dean from snorting out a response. “But this isn’t about me,” he went on. “I know you. I saw how you were after the last time you came back from a djinn dream. I know you just need time to work shit out on your own.”
He could practically hear Bobby’s eye roll through the phone. “If you’re old, what the hell does that make me?”
“Come on, Sammy,” Dean told him, grabbing his shoulder and giving him a brotherly jostle. “You’re going to have fun today. Promise. Besides, even if the monster is real, which he’s not, he only comes out in the dark. You’ll be fine.”
“Because you promised you wouldn’t ditch us all summer to make out,” Charlie told him with a glare, obviously not impressed with his performance so far.
Dinner was great. The steaks were cooked perfectly, the light salad on the side a perfect complement even though Dean had to be bullied into eating it since it was “rabbit food” and he was a self-proclaimed warrior. But even he had to admit it was pretty good. For rabbit food, of course.
Cas ran a hand up Dean’s back, lingering over each knob of his spine. “Why don’t you tell him? It will get him to stop asking.”
Dean tapped Luc on the shoulder. “Riddle for ya,” Dean said as Luc spun around almost comically. “What’s a question you can never honestly answer yes to?”
They both wore collared shirts to dinner that night. Cas had decided to go with ill-advised payback.
Dean raised his hand in a wave, not letting himself cry even though the tears were begging for release.
Sam looked between the two of them for a few minutes. “Okay,” he conceded. “If this is what makes you guys happy, then I’m all for it. Seriously.” He stood up and grabbed his coffee. “But for the love of god, next time put a sock on the door.”
Castiel ignored it all and stood on shaky legs. He shook his wings out, sending a cloud of dirt to settle in the air around him. “Do you really think your old tricks will work on me?” Cas asked. “This form worked quite well to scare me when I was a child, but it’s a little lacking compared to what I see in the movies these days.”
Cas could feel tears blurring his vision and he told himself it was from the contrast of the golden vial to the darkness of the night around them, though it was a lie. Inside the vial were dozens of glowing, golden sparks, flying around, bouncing into the glass and off of each other. “Dean,” Cas breathed softly.
“Dad, I swear to god,” Dean said, still actively having to push Cas back, “if you keep talking I’m going to let Cas finish what he started.”
Cas passed out on Dean’s bed almost immediately when they got to the Winchester household on Friday afternoon and didn’t wake up until the sun had already gone down.
“Well, no, but Dean, he can’t prove anything,” Sam told him. “And if Cas really is invincible then I don’t know what you guys have to worry about.”
“Yeah,” Sam replied in somewhat of a daze, staring at the coffee table in front of him as if it held the secrets to the universe.
“What?” Dean began walking again, faster than before. “No one, man. I was—um—I mean, I thought maybe we would go if we both didn’t have dates, but it’s cool—it’s fine. I think Charlie and Jo were both flying solo, too, so it’s no biggie.”
Dean literally dove over the table to try and cover Cas’s mouth before he could ask the next question. The jug of orange juice spilled, a plate of eggs was knocked to the floor, and sausages went rolling across the surface of the table, but Dean was still too late.
Lucifer’s eyes momentarily widened in shock but it was quickly replaced with a look of pure smugness.
Dean stared at him for a moment, waiting for his composure to crack, but when he kept on staring right back at Dean with a straight face, Dean burst out with, “We were arguing over who was the hottest character!”
“Oh.” A soft smile turned up the corners of Dean’s lips. “I like that.” Dean fit his fingers between Cas’ and held his hand in a decidedly non-platonic fashion.
Cas heaved an exasperated sigh. “I could buy you an island if you really want it, but I know you won’t be happy living on it.”
Dean, overtaken by his idea, insisted, “No, Cas, you’re not getting it.” He grabbed Cas’ upper arms and shook slightly. “
Charlie rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “Well, I can’t exactly leave you here without making sure you’ll be okay. What if he dreams about things like drowning in volcanoes, what do you do then? Huh?”
“Think about it…” She glanced down at the folder in her hand, “Jo.” She chuckled. “You know, for a minute there, I was already forgetting your name.”
So when the night ended, and the two of them stood on Castiel’s front door step, it seemed only natural to look up through his lashes, a heavy blush staining his cheeks as he whispered, “Come inside?”
Dean looked smug. "Nope! Besides, it was English. Who the hell actually needs to take a class for English?"
“Well, not all of us were entitled to lazy Saturdays in our p.j.’s with coma-inducing waffle monstrosities for breakfast,” Castiel defended.
Once he had his six settled and eating, Castiel walked over to where Sam at another table to ask about the alpha.
He looked so shy and sweet and perfect in that moment, and Castiel really wanted to kiss him. But he knew he couldn't while the others were still home, so he settled for hooking their feet together under the table. "My pleasure."
They had other friends on watch, like Bobby and Ellen or Jodi and Donna, and Henriksen had contacts everywhere, ready to cash in a favor or two. Wherever this body was, one of the team or their allies would be able to reach it within a day or two at most.
Castiel waited until he heard the hallway door shut behind her before he allowed himself to relax. He slumped back against his desk, running a hand over his eyes. Fuck.
“Not now or ever.” Castiel got up and hurriedly tugged on his clothes. Before he left, he swooped down to kiss Crowley goodbye. “See you later.”
He turned to walk back into the ballroom, but at the last moment paused long enough to look right at Castiel, his challenge clear in his expression. So he’d known Castiel was there all along, and he hadn't told Dean… He’d wanted the older alpha to hear.
"I should've been there," Dean murmured, his eyes tracking Castiel's bruises, his tone filled with regret.
She returned his smile, but it seemed tight. “Pretty good. Only a few hurt fingers and tummy aches.”
Crowley chuckled. "That it did, Darling." He brushed a kiss to the top of Castiel's head. "Whatever it is, know that I'm here for you."
Dean could tell how nervous he was about this, his anxiety broadcasted with every movement. He squeezed Cas’s hand, pulling his attention back. His smile was confident. “I don’t want to brag, but my handicap is pretty damn good.”
“Guess who won, Babe?” he murmured, and before Castiel could speak, he yanked his boyfriend into a heated kiss.
“Like I’m scared of any of these pricks. I have enough dirt on them to keep them underground for a very, very long time.”
"I had a bad day yesterday. I'm fine," He lied. Charlie was happy with Gilda, there was no need to drag her down with his drama. It didn't matter, anyway.
Castiel sighed and settled back in his chair, taking a moment to clear his mind and settle his thoughts. He determined silently that there would be no more stolen glances...he’d nearly forgotten himself, and he couldn’t allow that to happen again. Not in front of Hester.
Dean kissed him long and deep, slowly claiming every part of his mouth. Cas moaned under him, allowing his hands to skim up Dean’s front. When Dean finally broke the kiss, he didn’t move away.
"I missed that, too," Charlie said, touching his face lightly. "Hurry up and try those on. I wanna see how good you look."
He remembered his last conversation with Ana. She’d asked him about Lisa... He knew with sudden certainty what Cas’s deal with Ana entailed.
Dean’s brows furrowed as he did the math, four years before him and Benny came back. “That means you were working for him when I was brought back.”
“All I could remember afterwards was sitting in your lap. It was so wonderful, finally being that close to you.”
Not to say Dean stopped using his skills. He could still wheel and deal with the best of them, creating alliances and friendships for his father-in-law with kingdom after kingdom. And if there was ever any jealousy or pushback from the other advisors, Raphael would often rise to his aid. He did, after all, owe Dean for his happiness with Anael.
He turned on the sink, making sure that the water was as cold as possible, then bent down to splash some on his face. When he stood straight again, he studied his reflection, noting the bruises and swelling with an almost clinical eye.
The Council would choose a new supreme, and Cas could finally be at peace here. He could let go of the pain he’d been damming up behind those walls. There was no way it would reach Dean, not across time and reality.
As soon as they reached the sanctuary, Castiel was pushed into a wheelchair and rolled away to the infirmary by a red-headed omega named Anna. She maintained a kind yet professional air as she checked his vitals and performed an ultrasound with some equipment they’d scavenged from what used to be the maternity ward.
“God yes!” Dean growled as he pulled Cas into a hungry kiss. He brought his hands up to clutch at the back of Cas’s neck, slipping one finger underneath the collar to retrieve the bug. He pulled away just enough to murmur, “Can’t wait to get you out of these fucking jeans.”
Silence fell, until Cas looked back up at Gabriel, whose gaze had gone distant. “He barely even flinched. It’s like he took exactly two seconds to feel that pain, and then he was back to being professional.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “I was trying to keep my mind busy so I wouldn’t go crazy over you! You were just wandering around, distracting me with your scent and your eyes and your…I mean, that dinner where you dressed in your uniform? God, that was a rough one! I could barely even focus on Sam and Ana.”
Still her magic remained linked to his, her face a mask of indecision. She watched as Castiel drew in a deep breath then spoke again, his voice softer.
The chanting became clearer, louder, but then Dean realized that was only because Cas had joined in. His voice, which had been shaky just moments before, now resounded clear and strong.
Cas stared at him for another long moment, indecision clear on his face. Go back to Uriah, get jail time and years of wondering what if he’d gone with Dean, or…go with Dean. Be happy again. Fill that empty space inside.
"Again," he pleaded. Dean brought his hand against Castiel's ass again, smirking at the slight jiggle the flesh gave.
Dean had no doubt the family was in on this, her obvious plan to divide and conquer. He knew that Anna and Megan—both of whom Dean had met and somewhat gotten along with—were around somewhere with their own teams, but Hester had ensured that Dean was not put with either of them. That old bitch had, with one sentence, trapped Dean in hell for the afternoon. But, ever the professional bullshitter, Dean just smiled and nodded.
“Just get your cock in me already,” he whined. He grabbed Dean by the collar and yanked him into a kiss as he spun them around and started walking them back toward the couch. Somehow, between the kissing and the grinding, they didn’t quite make it to the couch.
Yes, only a fool. A fool, such as Cas had been. But now, with Dean curled into him, with those green eyes staring at him adoringly, Cas knew he’d never miss the signs again.
“Don’t worry, my pet.” He turned to face it. “Tomorrow morning I will return you home and tell Dean what happened.”
God, everything was still so easy for these guys: no real field experience under their belt yet, no scars, no nightmares. No blood of their best friends on their hands. He didn’t chastise the man, as he might have once. Instead he simply gathered his wallet and keys and strode toward the elevator. He wasn’t here to deal with any punk security guard, anyways.
She sashayed away, leaving Dean alone with a plastic case and a manila envelope. Dean opened the envelope first, pulling out several sheets of paper. There was no actual note from Cas, but looking over the printed screen shots and bank statements, it was easy enough to figure out what it all meant.
The three brothers shared glances, but no one said anything. They all knew how difficult this must be for Raphael, to see the woman he obviously loved being readied to meet, and possibly mate with, a different alpha.
He was about to say something to Sam, when the family started trickling in, still smiling to the press just outside. But Castiel was not with them…
There were about five bedraggled omegas running around in the midst of the children, but it was clear they were outnumbered. He wondered if any of them had ever worked with so many kids before.
Castiel looked back at him. “Yes, there are more than a few loose retellings, but those were created by different religious leaders, and only a short time ago.”
The detective paused as he tried to supply a face to match the name. “No, I haven’t,” he finally admitted.
Cas saw Brady on Monday, and the sight of that pretentious asswipe reminded him of another face, another smile. He blushed as he thought of Dean. God, he really hoped that the guy had meant what he said about seeing Cas around.
When they parted, Castiel wore that adoring look again, the one that made Dean feel unstoppable, the expression that Dean craved more and more. He smiled back, running his fingers down Cas’s arm to find his hand and link their fingers.
Cas let out a heavy sigh. “Thank you, cousin. Please give our uncle my sincerest regrets, but I cannot risk this. Not now.”
The agents shoved Victor from the office, but as they passed Dean, Victor leaned in close. “You have nothing on me,” he hissed. “So when I get free, I’ll visit
Dean knew that Jo wouldn’t be finished with the rocking chair for a few minutes yet, so instead he detoured down to the basement. He found the work crew, made up entirely of engineers and construction workers, at the back of the room, planning the underground expansion the compound desperately needed.
Castiel’s eyes finally lifted to meet Dean’s, and the alpha let out a sigh of relief at the understanding he found there.
"I got so jealous, because you were lying there with me, after the best sex I'd ever had, and you were talking about other guys. Or at least, I thought you were..." Dean amended.
Dean wasn’t sure how Cas was able to communicate with him like this, but he didn’t question it. Instead, he wrapped his arms around Cas and held tight as they rose through the air, through the portal. Only once they had cleared the opening did it snap shut, allowing them to land on solid earth in the dark room.
“You’re not playing fair,” he complained, tears clouding his vision. “You used me for a mark, and now you expect me to forget that?”
Once the sale had been completed and the transport of the piece arranged, Castiel and Anna saw Estelle off with promises to contact her should another similar piece become available. No sooner was she out the door, than Anna was turning on him, her eyes narrowed.
Home...Dean hated how right that word sounded, how despite his best efforts, he’d come to associate it with dark hair and blue eyes. Even after this mission finished—even after he watched those eyes fill with hurt, anger...hatred—even then, from now on, Cas’s eyes would always mean home.
Sam was there, talking into his phone. “Yeah, he’s here, Meg.” A pause, then, “No, I don’t know how, but he’s here.”
No one answered as they continued to watch the plane door, but no one else followed the brothers. Instead, the stairway closed up and the plane rolled away.
“Cas, so beautiful, Baby,” Dean bit out. It felt different without the lube, harsher, but neither of them cared. “Cas, I need...”
When I dropped him back at the school, barely in time for his next class, his neck had more than a couple new bruises, his hair stuck up at crazy angles, and his eyes had that glassy, dazed look.
“I was scared too,” the supreme replied. “I couldn’t guess how painful it would be for me, if you returned to your home.”
Hannah grimaced. “About two months ago, right before...” she trailed off, but Dean nodded for her to continue. “Right before you came searching for him. He came back and said he’d take on the mantle.”
He glanced down to find Anna and Meg grinning up at them eagerly. When his eyes met Hester’s, though, he couldn’t read what he found there. It was disconcerting. He’d always been good at reading people, but her...he honestly couldn’t tell.
The younger man’s laughter in the otherwise silent space was surprising...surprising and beautiful. “No...well, yes. I mean, the Council wants me to reclaim the title, but I can’t. I cannot spend the rest of my life trapped in that forest by my own power.”
But then Cas smiled softly, his hands sliding up to curl in the shirt fabric over Dean’s heart. “You, Dean Winchester, are going to be the death of me.”
“It’s beautiful,” Estelle breathed, her eyes tracing over the swirls and squares. “The woman’s face...so captivating!”
“I’m sorry if I’m just a little confused,” Dean crossed his legs, leaned back in his seat to meet Victor’s eye. “See, for some reason I feel like you weren’t keeping tabs on me so much as that chip you lost track of after you paid a mob boss hundreds of thousands of dollars to kill me and my crew, then told them to make it look like a bad job.”
He motioned Alfie over and took a moment to explain to the over-eager intern his vision for the exhibit. Alfie nodded enthusiastically, his expression slightly star-struck. Castiel smiled kindly. It wasn’t unusual for the interns to develop a slight crush. Here, he was in his element. He was the expert, and his authority was obvious in his bearing.
