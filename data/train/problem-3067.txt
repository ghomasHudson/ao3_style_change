“Dean…” Cas starts, his voice weak. He feels the hunter pull back and plop down on the bed next to him. Cas opens his eyes to see that Dean’s expression has sobered up.
In the end, he rolled them over again, his body landing on top of Cas’, making the angel moan lowly. Dean sits up and tugs the angel’s boxers down with impatient hands, wanting them just to be
They fall silent and it takes Dean a moment to realize that Sam has just completely contradicted himself. He just hopes his brother doesn’t notice. “Come get me when you’ve decided,” Sam adds, readying himself to leave.
Dean’s watching him worriedly, one eyebrow shooting up in silent question. To Cas’ relief, Sam speaks before Dean has a chance to. “Give me the keys to the Impala, you’re in no shape to drive,” he says, his voice somehow remaining neutral.
He hears Dean sigh in relief before he presses his lips against Cas’. The kiss is slow but gradually picks up in intensity, up until it escalates to Dean needing to break off for air - his breaths coming out heavy. He pushes Cas back until his knees hit the edge of the bed and the angel loses his balance, falling over onto the lumpy mattress.
The thought makes his stomach drop. Jack was always the closest with Cas and if he hates Dean for letting him get taken, then Jack surely would too.
Dean swallows hard, feeling his heart pick up in his chest. He’s desperately trying not to panic as he tries to figure out where on earth Cas might have gone. “What do you mean you don’t know?!” His voice is turning angry, even if he doesn’t want it to, which, in turn, is pissing him off even more.
“Let’s just get dressed, walk Miracle, and go buy that stupid microwave," he grumbles but it’s obvious his mind is still focused on Cas’ words.
Everything around him is still kind of spinning and it makes his already uncomfortable stomach clench more strongly with nausea.
Dean hums, indicating he understands. “You smell like a forest after a storm,” he says after a moment. “You smell like… like damp moss and wood and flowers but you also smell like the rain.” He watches a smile spread on Dean’s lips. “You smell like home.” Cas feels his heart melt and it spreads warmth through his chest and he leans in so he can press a kiss to Dean’s lips.
Once that’s out of the bowl he hands Cas the measuring cups and bottle of milk. “One and a half cups of milk,” he instructs, watching carefully as the angel pours that into the bowl. “Whisk that together,” he says, gesturing to the whisk.
The kiss is heated right from the get-go - Cas so overcome with the need and hunger that Dean ignites in him that he’s mildly horrified to find that it has taken his resolve to hold back and not get completely lost in the sensations barely a minute to crumble.
“You got shit to work through,” Cas finishes for him, his tone and words mimicking Dean’s so well it startles a wet chuckle out of him.
He shouldn’t get his hopes up but those simple words have turned the small spark of hope into a full-fledged fire and holy shit, Cas might have already forgiven him.
Cas lasts half an hour before he starts looking for Dean. He knows that if he approaches Dean too soon it will only enrage the hunter more but he’s feeling too worried and too guilty to stay put any longer.
Dean tries to remember if he knows enough ASL to be able to sign what he needs to say if his throat isn’t going to cooperate. He thinks he knows how to sign ‘that’, and ‘me’ is easy but he’s not sure about ‘hurt’. He’s just… he supposes he’s just going to have to try. Because he… Sam was
He takes a sip of his drink, his chest warming up again as the liquid passes down. He rests his head against the wall behind him and closes his eyes, trying to bring the violent spinning under some sort of control. He takes another sip and feels his stomach starting to seriously protest at the amount of liquor he’s been feeding it. He doesn’t even know when’s the last time he’s eaten, so the hangover is going to actually floor him.
He suddenly remembers Cas’ words, telling him he can’t keep running when faced with emotions, but that only makes what he’s feeling worse because all it does is serve as a reminder that Cas is gone and it’s his fault.
“Right," Cas says, continuing to watch the hunter as he takes the filter out of the funnel and throws it into the garbage. Cas reaches into the borrowed sweatpants and pulls out his phone but there are no new messages. “Nothing,” he says, looking back up to see that Dean is putting a new filter into the funnel.
It takes them about an hour and nearly all the scotch they had at the bunker to actually get him drunk.
It’s been an hour since he’s texted an apology to Dean but the hunter has yet to respond. The worst thing is he doesn’t even know if the man has seen it. And honestly, he can’t tell which option is worse. Because what if he
“You’re not, Dean. I know you better than that,” he says sadly. “Not to mention, Sam told me you haven’t been sleeping well.”
He takes a couple of hesitant steps out and ends up tripping over his feet and crashing into the wall. He doesn’t fall, though, so he counts that as a win.
Maybe it’s the dark shadows under his eyes. The way they scream at everyone that sees him that he barely sleeps.
“Most importantly I don’t want you to feel ashamed for.” He looks away, racking his brain for the right word, “for having panic attacks.” He looks back at Dean to see his jaw clenched and eyes wary. “I’m sorry I didn’t know what to do when that happened… I… I’ve never witnessed one before and I, to be honest, still don’t really know what they are,” he looks away again, “but I… I want to learn- I do. I want to know how to help you so I can be there for you when you need me.”
Castiel, the angel he has been trying to rescue from the Empty for multiple months, is standing in the library with him. He’s standing like twenty feet away from him but neither of them is moving. They’re just staring at each other, different emotions emanating from each of them, and Dean thinks time might have actually stopped.
Then Cas watches as the love of his life winks at this woman like it’s no big deal. And that… that feels like a sucker punch to the gut - the blow expelling all air from his lungs. Cas feels any previous thought leave his mind as this completely new and different wave of emotion crashes down on him. A wave that overpowers the anger he has been feeling at the hunter’s companion. A wave that makes his chest tighten - making each breath suddenly feel like there are razor blades embedded into his lungs. That makes his stomach feel heavy and like he’s going to throw up at any moment, despite not having eaten. That makes the sounds feel strangely distant and his eyes hard to focus.
“Cas, if you don’t want me to bullshit you, you can’t bullshit me,” he says gently and pulls Cas close to him. The angel nuzzles his face into his neck, wrapping an arm around the hunter’s body.
“Have you not seen the marks on your back?” he asks, his resentment for being the cause of them leaking into his voice.
The kiss is slow, and they both pour their entire hearts into it. It’s more grounding than heated, both of them just relishing in the other person’s presence… or… well… up until he feels Cas’ tongue swipe at his bottom lip. He doesn’t hesitate and parts his lips and invites him in. And with his tongue, Dean seems to also invite his horniness. The angel deepens the kiss, his hands getting a little harsher on his body and Dean finds himself happy to follow suit.
” He shakes his head. “I’m also pretty sure he’s slept more in the past two days than he has the entire week. Or maybe even two.” He frowns.
Or more precisely, the guilt that comes with knowing that his brother’s worried about him. The guilt he feels when he stays in bed just staring at the ceiling so long that his brother comes to knock on his door to ask if he’s okay. The guilt that in the end always forces him to get up and downplay just how awful he’s feeling. The guilt that drives him to take a shower and change clothes and actually attempt to talk to Sam and Eileen.
excuse his lack of self-control! He’s millions of years old, dammit, he should have perfect control over his strength, not be unintentionally bruising the man he loves! He shouldn’t-
“You don’t need to play nanny, Cas,” he snaps before he can stop himself, his voice harsher than he intended. “I’m fine,” he insists and immediately regrets his words when he looks back at Cas and sees him trying to mask a pained expression.
His eyes fall on the single big rainfall shower on the side - vastly different to the many ordinary ones. He never understood why the Men of Letters would need such a fancy shower - the room was built to hold multiple occupants at a time, surely they would argue about who would get to shower there.
He’s looking up at the hunter with wide eyes and he watches as a dark and feral smile spreads on his lips. “Take off your shoes and move up,” he orders, and Cas finds himself doing as he’s asked without a beat of hesitation. His head hits the pillows, and he watches Dean as he sinks on the bed and crawls towards him - much like a predator would towards a prey.
Despite his best efforts his mind keeps wandering back to the feeling of the angel’s lips against his, his cool fingers trailing down his burning body, the small needy sounds escaping his lips…
It must have been, mustn’t it? Sam said Dean hasn’t been sleeping well, but the two - now three - times he has shared a bed with Dean, the hunter had relatively no trouble sleeping; only once waking up from a nightmare.
Dean hates this. The angel is emanating a lot of emotions but they don’t make sense. He’s uncomfortable around him but also on edge and also
He waits for the ruthless winds that create the eye and its relative safety to snatch him out of this super silence that the room has fallen into - silence where even whispers would deafen him - but they aren’t coming.
’ replay in his mind and he knows he’s going to have to tell Cas that his actions hurt him. Which… admitting that he has a
“Never heard of it.” Cas frowns, his eyes finding the show on the large TV. He looks down at Dean, who’s still sitting on the floor by his laptop, and Dean’s suddenly springing up to his feet and moving to the sectional, settling down next to Cas. They’re far enough from each other for it to seem like they’re just two dudes hanging out but also close enough that Dean could rest his knee against Cas’ if he really wanted to.
Dean wastes no time and rips the fabric apart, sliding it off the angel’s shoulders, impatient to feel his bare skin against his own. When Cas’ naked chest finally presses against his own, Dean’s absolutely sure all oxygen has left the room.
“What if I find out I’m so fucked up I can’t be fixed? What if- what if in turn you and Sam realize that I’m too broken and you leave?” He hates how thick his voice is or how a tear rolls down his cheek. He chuckles. “I’m sorry,” he says, wiping his eyes. “This sounds like some emotional manipulation bullshit.” He shakes his head, suddenly feeling very self-conscious. “I’m sorry I wasted your time,” he looks down at his feet.
He fiddles with the switch and the lamp turns on, filling the room with what normally would seem like soothing yellow light, but to his hungover brain it seems more like a thousand burning suns and he looks away, squeezing his eyes shut.
“So…” Sam starts maybe forty minutes later. He’s had a couple of drinks and Cas can tell he’s a little tipsy. “You and Dean." Cas looks over at the hunter who has a knowing smirk playing on his lips.
“Or what?” Sam growls and shakes his head, irritation radiating off of him in waves. “Yes, Dean, you fucked up and I can
Cas takes that as ‘go ahead’, his hands slowly tugging the clothing down. His hand brushes over Dean’s hard dick as he pushes the sweatpants and boxers down and Dean’s breath hitches in his throat.
He knows he’s being pathetic - he’s not the type to beg for forgiveness - but his pride has been thrown out the window the moment he has started talking with that girl - Janice - in the bar.
“Come on, let’s get you something to eat,” Cas says, sitting up on the bed and pausing the movie. He turns to Dean, his eyes all gooey and full of love, and Dean can’t help but smile. Was Cas always looking at him like this?
he says in his mind, but his mouth doesn’t seem to cooperate. It doesn’t matter just how much he wants to say it, just how much he loves the angel, the trap those words are stuck in is far too strong for them to wiggle free.
There’s a flutter of wings on the other side of the library and Dean feels himself tensing up. He really doesn’t want to hear how Jack has no new clues right now.
“Yeah,” he growls and catches Dean’s lips with his own, stopping the hunter’s teasing, and Dean lets out a moan into the kiss.
Sam is coming after him in an attempt to stop him and try to reason with him. But Dean’s way too pissed off to be willing to hear anything Sam has to say. Because his brother doesn’t get a fucking say in whether or not he’s drinking too much.
Cas puts three more pancakes into the pan and then, after some consideration, a tiny fourth one, finishing the batter. “So, I was thinking,” Dean starts, grabbing Cas’ attention, “we could go get a microwave for the kitchen. Which… honestly, I have no idea why we don’t have yet.”
and Dean’s still asleep. His breaths are remaining deep and even, heart rate low - indicating he’s in deep sleep - and Cas is beginning to seriously worry.
“Is it okay if I hug you?” Dean hears someone ask and it takes him a moment to realize it was his own voice. The angel’s eyes widen in shock and just as Dean is opening his mouth to take it back he nods.
He can see some road signs far away in the distance and he hopes that at least one of them will say that he’s approaching an exit off the interstate.
He feels Cas press a kiss to his collarbone. “Good morning,” the angel murmurs, his voice muffled by Dean’s neck.
His eyebrows knit together in confusion. He hasn’t slept this long in… well… ever. Not unless he had been pulling all-nighters.
“It’s not,” Dean says, setting the coffee jar down. “I… I was an asshole for kicking you out. You had angels on your ass and-”
Dean rewards the touch with a soft, pleasured sound, and Cas allows him to lower him down on the bed. Dean is holding back, keeping the kiss languid and gentle, and while Cas’ body is demanding he deepens it, languid and gentle allows him more control.
He clenches his jaw, trying to regain any sort of control over his body but it’s like it’s moving without him. He sees himself grab a hold of Dean’s arm and start tugging him out of the bar, faintly aware of just how much he’s shaking. He’s faintly aware that Dean has trouble keeping up with him, his feet continuing to trip over each other and Cas only lasts the couple feet back to the entrance before he’s letting go of Dean.
drive her!” He calls, and to Dean’s surprise, the fact that Cas doesn’t call the car ‘it’ is turning him on a little bit.
He looks over at Cas next to him with wide eyes and heat crawling up his cheeks only to see the angel frowning in confusion, not understanding Eileen’s comment. Cas’ eyes find his and his frown deepens. “Did Eileen’s words have another meaning?” he asks, tilting his head to the side. “And why did she call us kids?”
His other hand is moving down Cas’ body and to the small of his back. He presses Cas harder against himself and rolls his hips at the same time and a desperate moan tearing from his throat. The movement makes Cas groan in need and it takes him all of his willpower to pull back.
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” he grumbles to himself, seemingly satisfied with whatever the hell he found in Dean’s soul. “So, what do you boys know?”
Another hour later the painful clenching of his empty stomach is so unbearable he has to go get something to eat. So he finds the closest non-stop restaurant on his phone, changes into jeans, and heads out. He didn’t bother leaving Sam a note, doubting his brother will wake before he gets back.
An urge to pull their foreheads together ripples through him and he goes with it before he can start thinking about it. His eyes fall shut when they touch contact and he hears Cas take in a quick shaky breath.
His lips find the angel’s again and Cas kisses him hungrily, both hands coming up to Dean’s hair, trying to pull him impossibly closer.
Dean isn’t saying anything, and Cas’ eyes drop down to his lap as he waits for a response. The moment that has settled between them feels a lot like he has found himself in the eye of the storm. One where he can see he’s not safe and there’s no possible route for escape, and he knows the winds will destroy him once he gets pulled in, but he can’t do anything but wait.
Dean’s still not at all comfortable with Sam knowing about him and Cas, and hearing his brother talk about it so casually is making his skin crawl. But it’s not like he can do anything about it now. He just tries not to pay too much attention to the voice that’s perpetually hissing that a part of why Sam is so upset with him is because he’s into Cas as well as women.
He doesn’t know if he will, so he doesn’t promise it. “Bye Sammy,” he says instead, and the line disconnects.
Neither Eileen nor Sam would ever say it but Dean knows he’s limiting them. Sam doesn’t want to leave him alone for long periods of time, which prevents them from going out or - more importantly - moving out. Yeah, he’s heard them talk about it…
He sees his brother’s eyes look past him, down on the floor, close to where his arm had been hanging off the bed. Dean lets his eyes follow Sam’s gaze and finds the quarter drunk bottle of Irish whiskey he forgot he left there.
at this ungodly hour?” he grumbles, propping himself up on his elbow with a grunt. The pressure in his head increases, making it feel like it’s in a hydraulic press, and everything sways to one side. He tries to suppress the pained noise rising in his throat but it still escapes his lips. Sam’s hand reaches out to help him but Dean shrugs him off and pushes himself up into a sitting position.
He forces his eyes away when they leave the parking lot but they keep returning back to the angel behind the wheel. Cas is leaning back in the seat with his hand low on the steering wheel, fingers wrapped loosely around it. He’s bobbing his head gently along to the music, the volume slightly above conversational level.
When they walk into the library Dean notices his brother talking to someone, his gigantic body shielding whoever it is from Dean’s view. Then he hears excited yapping and figures out Eileen and Miracle are back.
Dean doesn’t wait for a response, just snatches his jacket on his way out and slams the door behind him with way more force than was necessary. The morning air is freezing, and Dean feels goosebumps rising on his body in response. He hears the door to the motel room open after him, but he’s already halfway to the car. “Dean!” Sam calls. “Dean, wait!”
The angel’s eyebrows knit together in confusion at the realization. “Does Sam often let you know when he and Eileen are going to have intercourse?” He asks and seeing as Dean spits out the coffee he has been drinking and starts coughing violently he probably didn’t interpret that right.
Cas just looks even more lost, and it suddenly hits Dean that flying must feel very different for him, seeing as he was actually built for it. Dean, a human, blipping between planes of existence as they teleport from one place to another? Probably not the greatest hit for his body.
He knows, rationally he knows, that Cas knows him and that he knows him well. He’s aware of Dean’s issues and his self-worth problems and Dean knows that but he doesn’t always
Dean’s eyes flutter shut and it’s only a second later that he feels Cas brush his lips against his. It’s faint and barely there but it still makes Dean’s heart rate skyrocket. For a couple of moments - or maybe minutes or maybe even years - their lips are just barely touching. There’s no movement, no nothing - the gesture tentative and scared almost.
the kind of desperation those feelings can spawn. He isn’t saying he completely understands Cas’ situation, but he definitely understands just the type of fucked up shit an empty stomach can get you to do.
He takes his time to wash himself, making sure he gets rid of all the dust that had gathered on him while he’d been out. He wipes the fog off the mirror with his hand as he brushes his teeth, and he lets his eyes focus on the couple of reddish-purple bruises where his collarbone meets his shoulder. It’s a strange sight, not that he minds per se, but it definitely serves as a slap in the face kind of reminder that his boyfriend is indeed not human.
Cas’ hands move to his shoulders and gently push him back. Dean doesn’t resist and sits up, resting a hand on the man’s chest.
” Cas hears Dean slur from the other end of the line and he immediately straightens up, itching to follow Sam out of the room. He sobers himself up and focuses on the phone call.
But Cas doesn’t relent. Instead, his eyes light up with righteous fury and he steps closer to him. His eyes are intense enough that they make Dean want to take a step back from him but instead he just stubbornly holds his head up higher. “I don’t
Dean’s arm is lazily wrapped around his middle, his fingers gently brushing against Cas’ bare skin underneath his shirt. He snaked them under the fabric a couple of hours ago and whenever the angel thinks he’s gotten used to the feeling they would twitch a little, sending jolts of electricity through his body and bringing his attention back to them.
are having intercourse,” he says matter-of-factly but that just makes Dean’s breath catch again, his eyes blowing wide.
He racks his brain and remembers the superstore, remembers the drive back, kissing Cas before he remembers the angel suggesting therapy. Him pulling back. Him storming out of the room, grabbing one of Sam’s shirts, heading to the garage.
It takes him a moment to tear his eyes away from the doorway Cas disappeared into and make his way to the showers. His heart is fluttering in his chest as excitement and, honestly, a little anxiety thrum through his veins.
said his grace cleans his clothes. But to Dean’s surprise, Cas proceeds to fold the suit and coat and gently places them in the laundry basket.
After a couple of minutes, he rises reluctantly, disappointed with himself that he didn’t say the words back, and grabs one of his shirts. He wets it in the bathroom sink but before he can use it to clean them up Cas waves him off and mojos their come off of them. Dean smiles and thanks him for sparing his shirt the trauma, and looks around for Cas’ underwear, tossing it at him once he finds it.
“I’m calling Sam,” Cas says and Dean’s eyes are shooting up again. He’s shaking his head before he even realizes it but Cas is already looking down on his phone. Dean tries to voice why it’s a bad idea but trying to make Cas understand makes him in turn realize just how fucking irrational he’s being. Of course, Sam wouldn’t hate him for going out with Cas. That’s just plain stupid. But he still can’t catch his breath and a pained chuckle escapes his lips instead.
There weren’t any open restaurants around and he wasn’t willing to walk more than a block or two so he ended up skipping dinner altogether, much to Sam’s unspoken annoyance.
“Only what’s reached the media. Three tourists, found at the Matsell Bridge Natural Area, all of them missing their hearts.”
okay, Cas would surely be in here with Sam, talking about something. Or at the very least keeping him company.
“Fine.” He shakes his head with a fond smile. He changes into jeans and hands Cas one of his jackets. “It’s late September; it’s gonna look weird if you’re out in just a shirt,” he explains when Cas only stares at it. The angel nods and grabs it, pulling it on.
He frowns in confusion. “I don’t want you to beg,” he says, taken aback by Dean’s words. He frees his hand from the hunter’s underwear and pulls back so he can look at him. Dean makes a dissatisfied sound at the loss of contact and his eyes blink open. There’s a hunger and need and urgency in them and they’re combining into a wild and borderline feral look.
is way too aroused for him to not lose control over his own strength again and accidentally hurt Dean. Or possibly cause him distress in any way.
When he finally opens them again, he sees that he’s in his room. He looks back at the bedside table and is relieved to find a bottle of painkillers and a glass of water. He reaches over for it and downs a couple of tablets, taking careful sips of the water to see if his stomach will be able to handle it.
The more he thinks about it, the more it makes sense and he’s starting to feel physically sick. He tries to push the thought away but it’s like it got stuck to the front of his mind with superglue.
He looks over to see the angel bobbing his head gently, a lazy smile spread on his face. He’s content, his eyes attentive as they watch the road. He’s dropped down his guard and is relaxed, like truly relaxed, and it softens his features, making his body appear younger.
They shuffle around and then Cas is pushing Dean down onto the bed. The hunter shifts higher until his head hits the pillows, and Cas takes a moment to just
“Okay,” he whispers because yeah, that sounds nice. He shifts backwards until his back comes into contact with Cas’ chest. The angel snakes an arm underneath him, and after affirmation from Dean, hugs him close.
Dean lets out a sigh and plops back down into his chair. “I don’t know,” he admits after a moment. Definitely not more than three hours. He doesn’t think he actually slept more than three hours at a time since Cas got taken. And since Sam woke him up it might have been a lot less…
The stomach acid burns his throat and tears start welling up in his eyes in response. He’s panting, his breathing spiraling out of his control as his stomach punishes him for his night of drinking.
He hesitates, but only for a moment. “When Jack pulled me out of the Empty,” he starts, eyes remaining focused on his hands. “Since the Shadow was not okay with that, it held onto me rather tightly and some of my body and grace got destroyed in the process.” He pauses to take a deep breath in an attempt to compose himself, feeling Dean’s eyes bearing into him with an uncomfortable intensity. “When Jack was repairing my body, he offered to make me an archangel - said that he was making new ones anyway and would love for me to be his first one.
When the whirring finally stops he lets out an audible sigh of relief and grabs the freshly made pot, not bothering with a cup - it’s just more dishes to do. He pats down to the Dean Cave with his laptop and plugs it into the large TV.
Dean taps into the skills he’s picked up years and years ago, pushing away the hint of a fear that comes with those memories. He’s safe. This is Cas, not some-
“It’s more complicated than just you hurting me,” he says, starting to feel the mental exhaustion from this emotionally heavy conversation.
Dean’s about to protest when he decides to smell his own armpit and his face morphs into a disgusted cringe. “Oh my fucking
He considers just telling Sam he butt-dialed his number or something. That the call was an accident. He’d make some joke Sam wouldn’t laugh at and hang up. Instead, he says, “I’m here.”
Dean looks up at him from underneath his eyelashes and instead of answering grabs hold of Cas’ shirt, pulling the angel close to him, their lips crashing together into a bruising kiss.
He tries his best to keep himself under control but the kiss still turns from gentle and tentative into hungry and desperate real fast. He bites and pulls at Cas’ lower lip and the angel lets out a throaty moan.
“Okay,” Sam says, setting all the shot glasses they have in the bunker down on the coffee table, “let’s get you drunk so I can tell you about how miserable Dean has been while you’ve been gone,” he chuckles - the alcohol preventing him from taking the situation completely seriously. “God knows I need to get it off my chest, anyway,” he mutters to himself and Cas is fairly sure he wasn’t supposed to hear that part.
“I can always wash whatever we buy you with my stuff,” he says with a small, almost shy shrug. He looks Cas up and down again before fishing out his phone and starting to type something. He stays silent for a moment as they walk before showing his phone to Cas. “Let’s go there. We can find some new stuff for you to wear.”
“I’m not doing this for your sake,” he says quietly, looking into the angel’s eyes. “Really. I mean, I’m not promising I won’t possibly freak out but I want to try this. I want to try this because…” he takes a deep breath, “because you always help me calm down,” he says honestly.
Thanks to Cas’ restored ability to fly they end up with extra five bottles of scotch in just a couple of minutes. When they get back Sam decides to slow down his drinking and switch to beer and they settle back in front of the television - where The Good Place is still playing - but neither of them is paying any attention to it anymore.
His mind hisses back an insult, saying that it most definitely is not fine, and Dean is just exhausted enough to not bother arguing. That’s how he finds himself in front of his room, one hand clutching his clothes, the other hovering above the doorknob - hesitating.
Cas nods. “Yes. It does,” he agrees. His eyes examine Dean’s face carefully like he’s trying to deduct what he’s thinking. His eyebrows get pulled together as he thinks, his eyes squinting a little, and his head tilts just that adorable tiny bit. It’s such a Cas expression that Dean gets momentarily washed with such warm and fuzzy feelings that they manage to take his mind off of the case and instead get him to focus on how beautiful Cas is, up until the angel states, “You suspect that Audrey might be involved with the werewolves somehow.”
“Okay,” Cas says with a hint of amusement. Dean shoves the rest of his food into his mouth and gets up to move the plate into the sink.
when we kiss.” He knows his eyes are pleading, knows it’s Dean's weakness, and he watches the hunter look away. “This is uncharted territory for both of us and I don’t want to do something you’re uncomfortable with and ruin us forever.”
, to do - but eight out of ten times Sam or Eileen catch him and insist on going with him or, preferably, not going at all.
“Sheriff Gardner,” the sheriff introduces himself, once his eyes scan over their badges, and he holds out his hand, which they both shake. “I’m guessing you’re here about the dead tourists,” the sheriff asks, sitting down behind his table.
But his brother doesn’t push. He stays on the line in silence and waits for Dean to figure out what he wants to say. Dean feels the anger trickle out of his system, leaving behind only the hurt, and he sighs heavily. “You know when Jack disappeared?” He asks quietly after impossibly long moments of silence, figuring that might be the best way to start. “And we hadn’t seen him in like a month and a half?”
” he commands and Cas doesn’t need to be told twice. With only a flap of his wings, they’re in Dean’s bedroom, and to Cas’ surprise - and mild horror - the human chuckles.
“Dean, I’m not an alarm clock, you can’t keep ‘snoozing’ me indefinitely,” he grumbles, earning himself an amused snort from Dean.
“Dean, I’m afraid this is not a good idea,” he says softly because it’s not. They’re both way too aroused for them to be able to stay in control of their bodies and needs and not do something that Dean might regret later.
Cas follows him out immediately. “Dean,” he says, trying to get his attention, and by his tone, it’s obvious the angel has caught a whiff of his distress. That he will channel his inner Sam and start asking him about how he’s
Cas takes a careful step into the ominously quiet building and they both wince when the floorboards creak beneath his weight, the sound loud as a gunshot in the silence.
Dean shakes his head. “No,” he murmurs and it’s true. He really does not want Cas to leave. He reaches over and turns on the small bedside lamp before switching off the overhead lighting. It gives him another moment to figure out how he wants to lie down and he settles on lying on his side with his back to Cas.
He shakes his head, hiding his face in his knees again. He’s trying to catch a breath but the fetal position he has curled into isn’t helping. He tries to force his body to unravel but it's like he’s paralyzed. His nails are digging deeper into his skin, as he tries to desperately push the spiraling thoughts out of his mind, but it’s to no avail.
“You certainly look better,” Sam comments with a confused frown. He eyes Dean’s crinkled shirt, glazed eyes, and flushed cheeks and a realization appears in his eyes, a smug grin tugging at his lips.
There’s a rising feeling in his stomach. He should think about this. He’s diving in headfirst with no idea-
Cas sighs, picking up the bottle of scotch and taking a drink straight from it. “It’s not that I’m not patient with him. I’m always going to be patient with him.” He looks at him pointedly. “I just don’t want to cause those issues in his life if he could avoid them.”
Cas only stares at him with wide eyes, his mouth falling open as he tries to unpack everything Sam just said.
Cas pulls back a little and Dean is about to protest but then the angel’s pressing a gentle kiss against his lips. Dean feels himself relax and his lips part, but then his brain catches up to him.
On a different note, I wanted to involve Sam in Cas and Dean’s relationship, so the boys – and hence you, readers, too – would get an outsider perspective on what’s going on between them – one that isn’t tainted by their emotions.
There’s so little holding him together he considers just ripping the bag open or even cutting a new hole in it with his knife.
He desperately tries to remember anything else from last night but he keeps hitting dead ends. There are flashes of memories from the bar but nothing coherent enough to make any sense of. Has he done something that has fucked his relationship with Cas beyond repair? Did he say more than he remembers? Maybe Cas called him and his drunk ass said some hurtful shit?
Not only can he not afford to bruise Dean any more, he also knows that if someone were to get injured or killed while he and Dean were kissing instead of focusing on the job the hunter would have never forgiven himself. Cas tries to keep that at the front of his mind for the both of them, seeing as it seems to be completely escaping Dean’s thoughts.
Dean lets out a relieved sigh, a grin spreading on his face at the angel’s approval. “I’m so glad your taste in music doesn’t suck ass, like Sam’s. Celine Dion can fuck off,” he says and hears Cas chuckle quietly. To his surprise, Cas reaches over and turns the volume up and Dean feels his heart melting in his chest, as
“He… he pulled Cas out of the Empty,” he manages to get out, “and that’s why he ghosted us for so long.”
Dean stares at Cas’ last message. He wants to ask more but it’s also painfully obvious that the angel is busy. He feels a wave of dark thoughts bubbling up, so he locks the phone, feeling his brain beginning to try to convince him he’s being annoying and Cas’ lack of replies isn’t because he doesn’t have service.
He’s not particularly hungry and the thought of eating makes his stomach clench uncomfortably, but he knows Sam will just worry more if he doesn’t eat. His brother has taken it upon himself to cook for all three of them and always leaves a portion out for Dean for a couple of hours with some stupid supportive note.
He closes his eyes and feels the hangover passing, and soon it fades away completely, taking the rest of his inebriation with it. His body no longer feels like a garbage dump in the Philippines and he lets out a relieved sigh.
Dean lets out a breathless laugh. “You sure? ‘Cause this thing you doin’? It’s fucking torture.” Dean reaches out for him, surely in an attempt to pull him close again, but Cas shies away from the touch, knowing very well just how easily his resolve for anything crumbles when it’s met with Dean’s pleading.
Dean snorts. “Thank you, Sherlock, for the masterful deduction.” He tries to pull him back into the kiss but Cas doesn’t let him. Dean’s eyebrows are knitting together, his eyes revealing he knows something’s on Cas’ mind. “What is it?” he asks, his voice gentle.
full of love, it’s almost like Dean’s fuck up has never happened. He looks up at the angel to see his expression matching the emotions in his words. There’s just so much pure, unrestrained care for him in Cas’ eyes he feels his own welling up with tears because how could he ever be worthy of that?
“Yes, neither Dean's television nor the Dean Cave’s television has Netflix built into them and I don’t own a computer.”
Dean’s face goes through a lot of emotions which Cas doesn’t really know how to identify before it settles on horror. “How about we don’t talk about my brother thinking we’re sleeping together,” He says. “At least not… you know what, no. Never. Let’s never talk about this ever again.”
The moment he lies eyes back on Dean he feels the tears pricking his eyes again and he takes a deep breath, hands curling into fists at his sides.
It’s in one of these moments where Cas just looks so damn human that Dean briefly forgets he isn’t. He briefly forgets that the man next to him used to be a warrior. A soldier. Someone who would command garrisons and be just outright terrifying. Someone who could blow out all the lights in a barn to make the most dramatic entrance Dean has ever seen.
food for myself.” He does his best to keep his tone and expression neutral as memories of that time flood his mind. He remembers how damn overwhelming everything was. How his senses suddenly weren’t numbed by his grace and how everything felt like it was dialed to eleven.
The angel’s panting heavily, making Dean smile and he props himself up so he can look at Cas. There’s pure bliss painted on his face and it takes the angel a couple of moments to blink his eyes open. They’re wide and dark and filled with that lovestruck look again. Cas’ hand comes up to cup his cheek and Dean leans into it before allowing Cas to guide him down into a kiss.
Dean wants to fight him. Tell him to fuck off with his condescending bullshit but he can’t bring himself to.
Not really wanting to get caught by Sam, Dean stumbles back a little, his hands pulling Cas with him. He uses one of his feet to kick the door shut and then he’s pressing Cas against it, eliciting a surprised yelp from the angel.
The inside of the station looks just about the way one would imagine the inside of a sheriff's office to look like. They stop by the entrance and Dean lets his eyes scan the crowd for any sign that might point them to where the sheriff actually is.
He runs a hand down his face and feels his sleep clouded brain catching up to him. He remembers Cas in the library, Cas’ breath warm against his face and most importantly his lips. How soft they were. How great his stubble felt against his skin. And how much kissing him felt like the best drug in the entire universe.
He pauses, seemingly collecting his thoughts and finding words on how to voice them. “I’m okay to talk about why I’m,” he pauses, looking for a word, “uncomfortable,” he says the word slowly as if trying to figure out if it’s the right one, “with us going public but I… I can’t talk about,” he gestures down to his crotch, then to Cas and back to his crotch, “that. Not yet.”
“Yeah?” he murmurs, applying a little pressure to Dean’s hips, his hands now pinning him in place instead of just resting there.
The angel’s other hand snakes itself under his flannel and around his waist, Cas now actively trying to pull his body closer. And Dean wants to, he
All of their surroundings fade to nothing and it’s just him and Cas. His hands on Cas’ body, his forehead pressed against his, the angel’s quick breaths warm against his face…
you all the time. So… yeah,” he says but it doesn’t seem to help Cas understand. Dean waves his hand dismissively. “Forget it,” he says and gets out of the car.
“You’re impossible.” He rolls his eyes but there’s a fond smile tugging at his lips. He hears Dean chuckle and Cas reaches for a new plate, placing the finished pancakes on that instead.
“Sam…” Dean tries to explain but he immediately feels like he’s being a totally irrational idiot. Of course, Sam wouldn’t have a problem with Dean and Cas kissing. He’d tease them about it, sure, but wouldn’t be disgusted or anything.
As soon as the question leaves his mouth, he feels panic flooding his mind. What if Dean had indeed yet to notice them? What if he was truly clueless about the state his back is in? Now he’s going to check and see his skin littered with bruises and Cas will have to watch his face contort into disgust. Resentment. Distrust.
” he asks, and Cas sees with a pang of sadness that Dean is trying to pull walls up to protect himself from whatever his words might imply.
Dean leans in until their faces are mere inches apart, and the angel finds his arms coming up and wrapping around the hunter’s body to hold him closer without him prompting - or even asking - them to. “We can drive over there later,” Dean murmurs, leaning in even closer until his lips brush against Cas’. The touch is barely there but it still manages to rob him of all his breath. “I’m sure everyone will be just fine if we get there a day or two late,” he murmurs, pitching his voice into an even deeper tone.
“Dean…” A sigh escapes Cas’ lips. “You don’t have anywhere to be. What’s the worst that can happen?” he presses on.
He raises one hand and curls all his fingers except his pinky and thumb. He points the fingers towards Cas so he can see the gesture better and moves his wrist up and down. That should be ‘that’.
Dean’s head is pounding, the dull throb making the lights of the bunker difficult to look at. His lips are parched and his tongue got stuck to the roof of his mouth. He can feel dried tears in his lashes and on his cheeks but he doesn’t remember crying. Now that he thinks about it, neither does he remember why or how he got into the library.
“Yeah, that about sums it up.” He sighs heavily. “We haven’t gotten another body in nearly a week so I’m thinking maybe the animal has moved on. If you want, I can get you the files, and statement we took from Audrey Hopkins, but I gotta warn you, there’s not much in them and Audrey’s words don’t make a lot of sense,” he says.
He’s never experienced anything in his life akin to the feelings that kissing Dean ignites in him. Never experienced anything like the fireworks that every kiss sets off in his chest - so explosive and pleasant and leaving him craving more. Never experienced anything like this need to press the hunter’s body firmer against himself even when there’s literally no space left between them. This need to feel every inch of him, every part of his body.
Dean nods, dropping down on one side of the bed. He feels like he has been awake for three days straight, not like he pretty much just woke up. He runs a hand down his face, his head resting on the soft pillows. He feels the bed dip next to him and he looks over to see Cas lying down. He’s unsure and his movements are stiff and when he finally lies down on his back he keeps his arms by his side awkwardly.
Audrey Hopkins turned out to be a sixteen-year-old girl who claims to have seen the entire attack. Her mother invited them into the house with only a beat of hesitation - something that would have slipped past the untrained eye - and he and Cas went up to the girl’s room to give them some privacy while they talked to her.
He looks back at Dean to see him staring at him with raised eyebrows and a curious look in his eyes. “Cas,
“Thank you, Sam.” He smiles but it’s a little sad; thoughts still circling around Sam’s earlier words.
The four hours it takes them to drive to Cedar Rapids pass faster than any four hours have the right to do. So, before he knows it, he’s entering the small city and asking Cas to find them a motel to stay in.
enough. Take a deep breath.” He waits for Cas to do as he’s asked before continuing. “I’ll turn on my laptop and locate his phone. I’m sure he just drove somewhere far and is now well on his way back.”
“You don’t have to explain,” Dean says, his voice gentle. He nudges Cas off him and turns so they can face each other on the bed.
When Sam doesn’t respond Dean looks over at him to see his brother giving him one of his trademarked bitch faces. It’s the one where he’s simultaneously pissed off and disappointed in Dean.
But instead of Cas, the hunter finds Sam. His brother is standing by the stove, eyes trained on the pan as he pushes something around. He’s dressed, having probably already been on his morning run, and his hair is damp from the shower.
“Come on, let’s get you to bed. I’ll make you something to eat and bring you some water.” His voice is soft like he’s talking to a small child.
It takes Cas only a moment of hesitation before he melts against him with a soft sigh, his hands coming up to clutch at Dean’s upper arms. The kiss is languid, neither of them in any rush to take it up a notch. Dean’s hands are resting on the small of the angel’s back, underneath his blazer, pressing his body firmly against his own.
“Yes. It should be eight-seventeen by my estimate,” he says. One of Cas’ hands is wrapped around his midsection, his fingers tracing patterns lazily into his skin. His touch is feather-light, and it electrifies Dean’s skin so much it sends a small shiver through his body.
I know this chapter took a little longer to come out but I’ve had a stressful week. I don’t know if any of you had to fly at any point during the pandemic but, oh my god, it makes me wanna commit mass murder. The company I usually fly with kept canceling or rescheduling my flight, so I had to book a ticket with a different one, which flies to an airport
Dean knows he’s pushed Cas far enough for him to try and extend this any longer, so he latches his lips onto Cas’ neck and he starts speeding his hand up. Cas moans loudly, the hand in Dean’s hair pulling at it just hard enough to make him hiss softly.
“I-” Dean clears his throat, eyes not being able to meet Cas’, “Yesterday was not about… it wasn't about me not wanting to be intimate with you… because I- I want you. Desperately. More than I thought was humanly possible,” he pauses, a ghost of a smile appearing on his lips for just a moment, “it was- the rush of it, you pulling my hair as you did it… we were jumping straight to sex and it just brought up some bad memories,” he says, his voice quiet.
He wants to ask, he wants to demand answers, but he’s promised Dean to keep them a secret, and asking about Sam’s words is just going to bring attention to them. “Dean hasn’t been sleeping well?” He asks instead, albeit a little reluctantly, hoping to distract Sam from the topic.
“Could you ask Cas if he could drop by?” he asks and watches as Sam’s eyebrows drop into a steely expression. “I just want to apologize in person, is all,” he adds quickly. “He’s not responding to my texts or prayers-”
He wants nothing more than to pull his best friend into a bone-crushing hug and not let go for a decade but he doesn’t know that Cas wouldn’t push him away. He doesn’t know that he wouldn’t crumble if Cas did.
, “Come lie down with me?” His words are anxious and his hand comes up to scratch at the back of his neck. He hates that Cas saw him freak out but the angel’s natural fragrance
And his determination not to be a burden - no matter how fucked up - seems to help. It doesn’t take him much longer to be able to take a couple of deep breaths and he watches Sam raise to his feet. His brother always offers him a hand, pulling him up with him but he doesn’t today. No, Dean has to get up to his feet on his own but he doesn’t complain, no matter how beat up and exhausted he feels.
think about that. Because if he thinks about it, it will be added to the pile of shit he’s aware is wrong with him, and that pile is already far too large for him to ever be able to deal with. There are all these issues that he’s actually taken the time to acknowledge and they’re looming over him, and there are just so many of them he doesn’t know where he should start. Doesn’t know how to even begin to deal with any of it. Because one problem always uncovers another, or it uncovers how it’s connected to a different one and he… he’s too much of a coward to face that shitshow.
the default but we can pull that ‘anesthetic’,” he uses his fingers to make air quotes, “back and experience sensations like humans do,” he pauses, eyes dropping down, “or we can also use our grace to enhance our senses - even to the point where it can work as an aphrodisiac.”
doesn’t mind Sam knowing about them, he’s promised Dean he’ll keep it a secret. “Sam, I don’t-” He tries to deny it but Sam cuts him off.
“Dean, you’re horny,” Cas says, worried that if they continue at this pace he will trigger another attack in Dean.
He knows that if asked he would deny to all hell that he uses anything even remotely close to that. It actually kept him up one night and he has managed to prepare a full story around it. That his skin always faintly smells like coffee because he drinks it too much. That he’s always around it and that’s why it seems to stick to his skin. That it’s not at all because he uses a body wash clearly intended for girls.
but that just seems like he’s trying too much to come off as… well… queer. Plus it’s not like he would ever admit to another living, breathing being that he likes it.
He flicks his tongue out against Dean’s lips but, frustratingly enough, they don’t part. Instead, the hunter chuckles and pulls back, resting his forehead against Cas’. “Finish the batter, then we can do this,” he murmurs and all Cas can do is nod eagerly.
Dean chuckles, albeit a little uncomfortably. “I told you I’m going to try,” he murmurs before rolling on his back with a sigh. He looks over at him. “Be right back,” he says and rolls off the bed entirely.
“Anyway,” Jack speaks, cutting through Dean’s thoughts. “I have to get back to Heaven. It’s been nice seeing you.” A small smile forms on his lips and then he disappears.
But he… Sam has a point. They need to start talking shit out - need to build a trusting relationship where the other person won’t fear their partner’s reaction to anything they say or do.
The angel catches him staring and his eyebrows knit together. “I look ridiculous, don’t I?” he asks with a sigh, eyes dropping down to look at himself.
but that’s just what Cas is trying to portray. Dean can easily see the nervous wreck that he is underneath.
Dean tries to push some words out but all that comes out is a choked noise. Because he’s stupid for thinking he can get together with a man. He’s stupid for thinking it’s okay. He’s stupid for entertaining it for as long as he has. Because this is not okay. It’s wrong and it’s disgusting and there are tears welling up in his eyes because he’s going to have to break the love of his life's heart.
Dean wants to pretend he doesn’t know what Cas is talking about or maybe just dismiss it with a joke. His hand freezes halfway to his mouth and after a moment he drops the fork back on the plate. His shoulders sag and he lets out a sigh. “I don’t know,” he says quietly. “Talking about it makes it real and,” he pauses, looking for words, “and if it’s real it means I can mess it up.” His eyes examine the leftover food, refusing to look up at Cas.
, the preview starting to play through the speakers. It’s a classic; it’s funny and doesn’t require focus, but it also seems like he’s trying too much to come off as straight. His mouse moves down his list to
He really doesn’t like the way there’s always at least fifteen versions of a simple item or how there’s always some variety of it on sale. It has happened to him on more than one occasion that he has been sent to get a simple item - like bread - and still somehow ended up with two.
The angel lets out a surprised gasp and Dean finds a satisfied smirk tugging at his lips. He rolls them over so he can stretch out on top of Cas, and he starts kissing down his jaw, the angel tipping his head to the side to give him more access. Dean’s lips ghost over Cas’ ear and he feels the angel shiver beneath him. “Can I touch you?” he murmurs.

“Two bowls,” he says, taking them out, “a whisk, and measuring cups.” He places them all on the island.
“Dean!” Cas exclaims and Dean’s eyes snap over to him again. The angel’s eyes are wide as he stares at him, an emotion Dean’s too angry to identify appearing on his features.
He must have been taking too long because Cas walks over hesitantly and sits down on the bed next to him. His movements are relatively slow and exaggerated and Dean realizes he’s doing it in an attempt to not spook him. Dean huffs out a breathless, unamused laugh and hangs his head low - not wanting to see the worry on Cas’ features.
I wanted to portray in at least in one of these chapters that sometimes, when you've lived with anxiety for a good while, you realize when you're freaking out about something that doesn't make sense or is completely stupid. But that realization doesn't immediately mean you'll stop having a panic attack. Because while you might rationally realize this, the rest of your body might not.
doubtful thought that I had, and I don’t even know why I paid it any mind, but it only grew in strength when I did, and it led me down more doubt,” he says and fuck can Dean relate to that. He can hear the shame in Cas’ voice, even if anxiety isn’t always something you can fight against. “I don’t know why I let it convince me that you wouldn’t wish to see me. I know now it was foolish of me to think that. I know now, you would have been happy to see me but that still…” His voice trails off, his eyes looking away in embarrassment.
“Aaaaaand, we’re done.” He reaches over and turns the music up, swatting Sam’s hand away when he tries to turn it back down.
The angel doesn’t say anything. He stays silent and the moments keep stretching on until he nods. “Okay,” he says softly.
His lips brush against Cas’ and the angel’s breath catches in his throat. But, to Dean’s frustration, he doesn’t do or say anything.
He considers praying to Cas so he can go get Sam but he can’t do that to the angel. He already feels horrible for what’s happening to Dean and this would just make him feel worse.
Dean finds that other than the offensive words being thrown at him by his own mind, the feeling of another man’s cock in his hand isn’t all that weird. It’s been a while, sure, but it doesn’t feel
Cas’ smile widens and he bends down to pick up the abandoned grocery bags. There’s a hungry look in his eyes when he straightens up again. He takes a step to Dean’s side and leans in real close to his ear. “I
“Fuck the socks, just come here,” he says in a low voice, the distance between them leaving him cold and desperate - and more importantly giving his mind time to catch up and be a dick.
He can feel Cas nod against him and then his fingers are circling his groin, the touch barely there. The coolness of them is combating the heat of Dean’s skin and Dean lets out a deep moan, his head falling back. Cas uses this to plant a kiss just below his jaw, making his way down Dean’s neck. Dean’s so lost in the pleasure he feels like his knees are going to give out at any second.
He’s building up the courage to speak and he can see that Cas can sense that. The angel sits down on the bed next to him carefully and Dean notes, with a pang of hope, that he hasn’t sat down as far away from him as Dean had expected him to.
