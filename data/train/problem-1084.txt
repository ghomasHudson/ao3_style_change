“Mmmm.  Yes, Captain.”  Sherlock’s voice sounds slightly slurred, and John’s fairly certain he’d been drifting off in that lovely place he’s tried so hard to describe to John before, the place his brain goes when he’s submitting.
Luckily, John doesn’t dally.  Sherlock hears the shutter click a few more times, and then John is pressing a soft kiss to his spine.  “Beautiful, so beautiful, we’re all done now, you were perfect.”
“Fuck, I can’t wait.”  Jude sounds almost infuriatingly casual, but he doesn’t cease the gentle tugs on Sherlock’s mane as he continues to work him over.
“They matter to
in a while; John would strip Sherlock and tie him up, or make him kneel, or handcuff him to the headboard.  Other times, if they weren’t in the mood for a power exchange, they’d cook a meal together and then retire to bed for a single round of vanilla sex, full of whispered endearments and tender promises.  John’s found he honestly doesn’t prefer one over the other.
“Yeah, yeah, it just has a way of
Sherlock bites his lip.  His cock is red-hot and throbbing angrily where it’s rising obscenely from his trousers, and his balls feel strangely swollen, but he must admit… the sensation is unobjectionable, when he thinks about the reward John has in store for him.  “Yes.  I suppose I did.”
“I said,
So he’s fine.
For a moment he worries that John may not take him at his word, but one look at John’s eyes, and Sherlock knows John is as far gone as he is.
enviably short, a happy circumstance of which John seemed all too eager to take advantage.
He’s not quite sure how long it takes for the first set of ice cubes to melt, but as soon as they’ve been reduced to water pooled between Sherlock’s prominent vertebrae, John replaces them with a new set, offset in position by a few inches so as not to aggravate the skin.  He settles back into his chair and continues to fondle his own hardening shaft as he watches Sherlock shiver and strain.  From this angle, John has a perfect few of Sherlock’s glorious arse, clenching helplessly as the sensation of the ice commands his attention.
He doesn’t
Sherlock sighs dramatically, begrudging his current lot in life.

So at last, Wednesday had arrived, and not a moment too soon.

John blinks up at him stupidly.  Because honestly, no, he really, really didn’t.  “And what’s that?”
The sound of Sherlock’s voice breaks the spell once more.  “Do… mmm, Christ,
The faces around the table have all lit up like it’s Christmas.  “Oh my God, amazing.  Do me, do me!”  Simms is all but cackling with glee, and John can’t help but join in.
He’d already had to delay the start of his experiment for three days because John was called out of town to address some issues with his father’s health (John had been vague with the details, and Sherlock knew better than to pry), leaving Sherlock in charge of Rosie.  She’d gone to daycare during the day, but mornings and evenings had been a jumble of frenetic domestic responsibility, making bringing his attention back to the Work considerably more challenging than usual, since he couldn’t remain completely immersed in it as he normally would.
“If at any point you feel overwhelmed, I need you to vocalise that to me.  It won’t mean we’re going to stop entirely unless you want us to; it’ll just mean we need to reevaluate our approach and try something different.  Yes?”
Sherlock nearly blacks out.  The vision of the panties pulled taut between his stocking-clad legs is so dazzlingly erotic that he finds himself willing his Mind Palace to take a picture of it for future perusal.  John seems similarly afflicted; he’s staring shamelessly down at the panties as he issues a series of sharp thrusts in to Sherlock’s willing body, and Sherlock sinks powerlessly into supplication as John begins to ravage him once more.
The next thing John knows, he’s emptying his guts into the toilet bowl, the retches wracking their way through is body in consuming, all-encompassing waves.  He can’t breathe and his eyes are swimming and his chest is heaving in a strange convulsing pattern that doesn’t seem normal at all.  There’s no air, not enough air, and he’s trying so hard to breathe but he can’t around the vomit expelling itself violently from his body.

Sherlock to actually hook up with Aaron.  I love the idea of Sherlock and John engaging in a bit of elaborate role-play about the possibility, but at the end of the day, the dynamics of their relationship as I’ve written it in this series don’t seem cut out for polyamory (or poly encounters).  That said, I do adore the thought of them toying with this dynamic mentally for the purposes of bringing out John’s possessiveness, and enjoying his subsequent reaction.
with John.  Nothing else -- not lust, not alcohol, not drugs -- has ever made him feel this way before.  It’s a sense of peace that is utterly incomparable, and he basks in its reassuring glow.

And he’s not quite sure how to tell John that.  That Aaron thinks John’s (mostly) closeted existence makes him some sort of existential threat to living ‘honestly’ and ‘openly.’  That John’s downplaying of his involvement with Sherlock makes him a traitor to some unspecified ‘team’ of which he and Sherlock are proud members.  That John’s overt heterosexuality is simply a guise for internalised homophobia that he weilds like a shield disguised by hideous wool jumpers and ill-fitting coats.  And though Sherlock has come a long way in convincing Aaron that John’s not all bad, that John’s made true inroads and progress and that he’s
John’s fingers disappear and Sherlock blinks his eyes open, firmly aware of the fact that he’s been quickly reduced to a sweaty, trembling mess of nerves.
John pulls away, eliciting a whimper from Sherlock.  “It’s alright, shhh, shhh, you’re okay now, everything’s okay.  Going to make you feel good now, yeah?  You were so good for me, sweetheart, so quiet and good while you watched, going to give you a little reward now, hmm?”

INCOMING TEXT FROM: John Watson
After an hour, it all begins to slide softly into focus.  Usually by that point he’s in the back of a taxi or a squad car or an ambulance (depending on the gravity of the situation), and it’s as if his brain finally connects the neurological pathways that allow him to process the sequence of events in a coherent way.  It’s always a little startling when it happens, but after all these years, he’s eventually grown used to it.
Greg’s eyebrows had all but disappeared into his hairline.  “Well, it’s not exactly the
God, it’s… it’s a lot.  It’s… fuck, John.”
“Thank you, John.”
“God, so were you, Sherlock.  So are you.”
“Oh, God, that’s it, love… Christ, these panties look so goddamn pretty on you, love the way your cock looks when you wear such pretty things--”  His words are swallowed whole as Sherlock dips his head to capture John’s lips with his own, and they exchange a series of heated, frantic kisses as John continues to jerk Sherlock through the thin fabric of his knickers.
“Still is.  She was cleared of all wrongdoing in her husband’s involvement with the initial embezzlement scandal.  She’s been a darling of the party for a long time.”
“Mmm.”  It’s not a
Well, ‘annual’ was a rather loose term in this case; they’d had to take a few years off, what with Sherlock’s death and then that unfortunate incident at Appledore, but since their lives had taken on a shocking degree of normalcy over the past few years, John had suggested they take it up again.
“I don’t.”  Sherlock’s tone is firm, and John’s eyebrows shoot up at his rapid response.  Sherlock holds steady; he knows exactly what ‘topping from the bottom’ is (John had used the phrase to explain what it’s called when John orders Sherlock to fuck him while they’re having a power exchange), and Sherlock knows he doesn’t want to top from the bottom himself.  Even the extremely mild form of it he’d employed during John’s birthday session had made him feel distinctly unsettled in the aftermath.

in an indulgent mood today), then return to the flat in time for Rosie’s nap.  John blogs and answers his emails.  Sherlock composes.  Rosie awakens.  John reads her books while Sherlock finishes his composition.  Sherlock does a puzzle with her while John does the shopping.  They double-team the cooking while Rosie toddles about the kitchen, interrupting them every 39 seconds (on average).  They eat dinner at the table.  John puts Rosie to bed.
Sherlock had known that already.  He nodded.
John’s eyes snap up to meet his.  To Sherlock’s surprise, they’re cold and calculating.  Then John gives Sherlock’s limp cock a

thing, what the two of you share. It’s not to be taken for granted.  And you have to know I would never come between that.”
Sure enough, John manages to prop himself up on all fours and slowly pull out, quickly replacing his cock with Sherlock’s plug.  “Oh, fuck, very nice.  Very nice.”  His fingers trace Sherlock’s tender rim, and Sherlock moans wantonly, raising his arse into the air for John’s perusal.  It’s still dark in the room, but John seems undeterred.
“Hhhng!”  Sherlock’s eyes slam shut and he tips his pelvis up to welcome the intrusion, hands flying back up above his head to grip the edge of the table.  John just grins, then takes Sherlock’s slim hips firmly in his hands to hold his body in place, and begins to thrust.
He curls up on his side, and cries.

He calls it the
Sherlock gives a nod so slight, it would be imperceptible to a casual bystander.
“So, um, I think that’s it in terms of negotiations.  All our previous hard limits are still in place: no gunplay, no bondage, no edgeplay.”  Sherlock gives a reluctant nod; those were new limits they’d set during this tentative foray back into power exchanges. They used to engage in all of them (and more) as a matter of routine, but since they’d reeled things in and started counseling, John had been very tentative about reintroducing more extreme activities.  Sherlock attempts to shake off the pang of disappointment that twists deep in his stomach.
Sherlock licks his lips.  “Because I’m yours.”
like a couple of plebian meatheads, watching some cinematic abomination that makes even the crap telly in which he himself occasionally indulges look like a masterpiece.
Sherlock turned to look at John, gazing placidly over his shoulder.  His face was blank, like a mask, devoid of any glimmer of intimacy.  John shuddered.  “That word you used.  Don’t use it with me ever again.”
But more than that, it’s the surrender.  He’s never felt more helpless, more at John’s mercy.  Even when John used to tie him up, tease him, tempt him until he was a begging, writhing mess, he’d never felt as immobilised and overwhelmed as he does in this moment.  The overstimulation is so consuming it’s nauseating in its intensity, and he can’t tell if he wants to pass out or be sick.
Sherlock moans and shudders, recalling the time John had tied him down on the kitchen table upstairs and seen how many orgasms he could wring out of him in an hour.  It had been exquisite agony.
No matter what Sherlock’s fickle mind may tell him: it was just testosterone and pheromones and the heat of the moment playing tricks on his perception.  Victor didn’t want

going to let John get away with it that easily.
“Shit.”  Aaron turns his attention back to his phone.  “Did you hear that?  Time is short.  Reddick’s got the team on the move to GreySphere HQ, but can you meet us at the bolthole to move the source?  I’ll text you the address… Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  See you there.”  He hangs up and tosses his phone on the nightstand, then strips off his t-shirt and sweatpants and rummages through his wardrobe, procuring a pair of denims and a sweater, hopping a bit awkwardly as he tugs them on.  Sherlock diplomatically averts his eyes.
“You’ve… named your vibrating plug?”
Sherlock thinks about it.  Or at least, he
Sherlock gasps in the first full breath he’s taken in what feels like ages.  The room spins and tilts dangerously, and he shudders, gripping the sheets and slamming his eyes shut against the sudden onslaught of sensation.
Sherlock doesn’t bother to correct John’s assumption.  After all, what would he say?
Sherlock’s voice is utterly transformed; throughout dinner he’d kept it even, conversational.  Now it’s low and sultry and all but
<12:27> That said, I have some bad news.

“Oh.” Sherlock finds his throat has suddenly gone a bit dry and his cheeks feel a bit warm as he wonders what sort of delights John keeps on this mental list.  Not for the first time, he’s overwhelmed with the desire to split John’s skull open and unfold his brain and read it like a chemistry equation, in simple black-and-white.
“Alright, love.”  He gives Sherlock’s lips one last chaste peck.  “Goodnight.”
Sherlock does, with a light grunt.  The plug is still inside him, and though he’d grown used to the sensation while he was lying still, the sudden movement reminds him of just how intense the penetration is.
“Hmm.”  John knows Jude is one of the few men Sherlock ever fantasizes about topping ,so he’s not particularly surprised by this admission.  He runs the tip of his thumb over the head of his own cock, the sensation causing his member to pulse eagerly in his hand as he imagines how gorgeous Sherlock would look fucking Jude; the way the muscles of his back would ripple, his glutes and thighs flexing in rhythm, the way his arms would tremble with exertion as he fought to hold back.
“Adda?”  Rosie’s voice rings out behind him, and he turns to find her gazing brightly up at him, face endearingly coated with the remnants of her dinner.
“Oh!  OH! Sherlock, Sherlock, I’m--”  And with that, John lurched forward and came in hot streaks across Sherlock’s face.
This happens, sometimes, after sex with John.  All the

people would not consider inherently sexual, but as it turns out humankind has a gloriously diverse range of kinks, so things as innocuous as reading the newspaper while wearing a nightgown or brushing my hair while singing ‘God Save the Queen’ are sometimes exactly what someone needs to get their rocks off, and God knows I’d never begrudge them that.”  Sherlock watches John shift uncomfortably in his peripheral vision.  “But these requests were different.  In fact, most weren’t requests at all, simply seemingly-random gibberish:

John sidesteps his gaze with rehearsed precision to stand behind him.  “Raise your arms out to your sides.  Spread your legs.”  Sherlock complies immediately, and John skims his fingers over the miles of pale alabaster skin exposed before him.  He makes non-committal, thoughtful sounds as he does so, pretending to inspect him for any signs of dirtiness.

John grins.  “Good.”
And Sherlock does.  His eyes slam shut and his body bows up and contracts almost painfully as his cock shoots another load up his abdomen.  He can feel it land in hot, obscene spatters, and despite his current state of delirium, he’s certain he hears John issue a little gasp as he watches.
John licks inside, Sherlock’s tongue tangling with his own.  He can feel Sherlock’s breath hot and heavy as it intermingles with his, their lips moving against one another in a familiar slick slide, practiced and eager all at once.  John combs his fingers into the short strands at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, and chuckles to himself as Sherlock shudders against him.
John groans and lets his head fall back, welcoming her ministrations.  She undulates against him and he has no doubt she can feel his hardness pressing up against her, but he doesn’t have enough modesty left to feel a single iota of shame about the situation.  Wherever the hell this is going, he’s along for the ride-- so long as Sherlock’s on board.
“Alright, then, love.  Unlock your phone, and give it to me.  I’m just going to set an alarm; I won’t go through any of your private things.”
“Yeah, yeah, hate the game, not the player.  Get out of here.”  With a wave of his hand Bill dismisses them, and John leads Sherlock onto the dance floor, pulling him into his arms.
“Oh, GOD, your hole… you’re so full, so open, fuck, Sherlock, fuck, gonna wreck you, make a mess of you, gonna make it so you can’t walk right for a week, GOD--”
“Hi, Sherlock.”  John gives him an amused smirk, then turns to Aaron.  “Aaron.  Lovely to see you.  Appreciate you keeping an eye on Sherlock for me.  Really generous, that.”
He tears it open with his teeth, then coats his cock as best he can without relinquishing his grip on the end of the belt.  Before him, Sherlock is trembling in anticipation, and John feels nearly dizzy with desire.  He presses his slick fingers roughly into Sherlock’s tight hole, eliciting a grunt from the man before him.  He twists them a few times; it’s a perfunctory preparation, devoid of any sensuality, but he knows that right now, Sherlock needs it to be rough.
a rather sensitive topic for them both.  But the moment they stepped out onto the street after the appointment had concluded, Sherlock pulled his collar up around his neck, crossed his arms belligerently to wrap his Belstaff around him, and took off towards the Tube at a pace that John could only match if he took it at a brisk trot.  Sherlock knows damn well John hates it when he walks too fast, so he was clearly goading him on; John swore under his breath and tried to formulate a game plan on the run.
He’s not sure how John makes him come again.  At some point John flicks the clothes pegs off of Sherlock’s nipples sending fresh waves of pain rippling through his nervous system, but he’s fairly certain that’s not what tips him over the edge.  The vibrator is still inside him and he thinks at some point John resumes touching his cock, but he can’t really process what’s happening anymore.  There’s just
John furrows his brow.  “I’m here… for therapy.  For my anxiety and depression.  To deal with the grief over the loss of my wife.  To work through my trust issues.  To figure out how to move on.”
The sound of Sherlock’s footsteps echoed up the stairwell at precisely twelve after midnight.  John had been dozing on and off, and he turned muzzily towards the front door to the flat as it swung open.
took weekends off.”
“Probably somewhere in between, I guess.”
“You close?”  John brings his fingertips to his lips to wet them before bringing them down to meet Sherlock’s right nipple, which he proceeds to flick and pinch.
“Um.”  Sherlock met her eyes nervously.  “What about your parents?”
“She’s never mentioned it.”
“Yes.”
Rosie’s voice on the baby monitor sounds obscenely loud amidst their quiet ecstasy.

“I need--”
Sherlock almost chuckles to himself.  Rather unusual use of Rosie’s baby monitor, that.  John is quite a pervert.  Sherlock fucking loves it.
“I know, love.  It’s supposed to be a surprise.  I thought… I thought you’d be happy to see me?”
He hangs up the phone and flicks off the light, then drifts off to sleep imagining just how amazing their reunion will be.
Sherlock buries his head in his arms and murmurs something unintelligible.
“No.  But I’d really wish you’d told me this sooner, John.  We’ve been working together for a while now, and I thought we’d made a lot of progress and really opened up.  But when you tell me that you’re hiding things like this from me, it makes me worried that we haven’t come as far as I’d hoped.”
The professor pursed his lips.  It was still early on in the semester, and Sherlock was filled with a growing sense of trepidation; perhaps he’d misunderstood the assignment, and done it all wrong?
interested in the proceedings.
So it would seem John’s on the same page once again.
“John,
at you, love, how big you’ve grown!”
Sherlock waits.
Then they’d become rather distracted making love on the sitting room floor for the better part of two hours.
“So I discovered during my research for that zookeeper case that, as it turns out, wolf copulation is sort of an… intersection of those interests.”
Finally, the ecstasy wanes.  John grinds his softening prick into Sherlock’s prone body until he becomes too sensitive to continue and reluctantly pulls out, eliciting a moan from the man in front of him.  He relinquishes his grip on the belt, tossing it haphazardly aside, then takes a few steps back, tucking himself back into his trousers and zipping up.  Sherlock remains bent over the kitchen table, trembling, exposed, and leaking in a most delicious manner.  John smiles.
“Love?  You can drop down onto your forearms now if you’d like, no need to keep your hands still.”
“I need a name.”
John doesn’t open is eyes, and he keeps his tone politely cool.  “Yes, Sherlock?”
He can breathe again.

wait. The first few hours were actually quite productive; Sherlock spent the time picking Aaron’s brain about the case, comparing their intel, and drawing connections between their individual smatterings of evidence.
Sherlock wails and squeezes his channel as tightly as he can, as if that could somehow take John’s come even deeper into his body.  He milks John’s cock for all he’s worth, desperate to take every last drop that John can give him.
John’s face transforms into a knowing smirk.  “Good.  Get freshened up, and I’ll see you back in the hall?  We ought to give Greg our congratulations.”
The day of Mary’s birthday is the worst.  He wakes up missing her fiercely, so much it’s a struggle to get out of bed.  He’s not on call at the surgery and Sherlock has to leave for the lab, so he knows Sherlock is counting on him to take care of Rosie.  Even so, he finds he doesn’t have the energy to do much besides get her breakfast in her, then plop her down in front of the television while he sits and stares into space.
meaning ‘bright’ and
He still goes through the motions of his day, but it’s like being on autopilot.  He’ll be vaguely aware that he’s engaging Sherlock in conversation, or putting Rosie through her bedtime routine, but it all feels hazy and surreal.
“Mmm.  John, John, please.”  Sherlock’s voice sounds wet and unsteady, but John doesn’t relent.
“Excellent.  Now, let’s see what I’m working with, here.”  John lowers himself to perch on the edge of the mattress, peering down at Sherlock like he’s a patient on an exam table (the thought makes Sherlock’s cheeks flush).  Then he reaches out and finally--
Were they chatting about the case, the news, the weather?  Were they chatting about
But thanks to his previously-collected data, he can conclusively say that he, Sherlock Holmes, is the best lay that John
Sherlock is quite uncertain he’ll be able to hide his erection long enough to make it back to the table.  He takes a quick sip of his drink and then shifts his weight from foot to foot, which proves to be a bad idea-- the silk rubs provocatively against his sac, and he utters a light gasp.
“Do it.  Come on my cock.”  Victor whispers the words low in Javier’s ear, and that’s all it takes.  Javier reaches down between his legs and pumps himself once, twice, then he’s releasing all over the sheets as he buries his face in the mattress, crying out in ecstasy.
Finally, he felt capable of responding.  “I… maybe I do.”
Finally, John rights himself and turns away just long enough to rummage through the drawer of the bedside table for the lube.  Sherlock takes the opportunity to arch his back, relieving the pressure of the corset enough that he’s able to suck down one or two full breaths before John is turning back to him, tapping his hip, their unspoken signal for Sherlock to roll over.
It doesn’t matter.  It never does.  In four deliberate strides he comes to stand behind Sherlock’s chair, before bringing his hands up to rest them gently on the bare skin of Sherlock’s exposed shoulders.  Sherlock releases a breath John didn’t know he’d been holding.
John tugs lightly at the fabric of Sherlock’s shirt, untucking it from his trousers, and snakes his hand up until he finds Sherlock’s right nipple, which he takes between his thumb and index finger and begins to pinch and pluck.  Sherlock gasps and shudders against him, and John chuckles as he feels Sherlock’s cock throb in response.  In retaliation, Sherlock reaches around to firmly grip John’s arsecheek, pulling his pelvis forward to grind demandingly against him. They both let out low moans as the their arousal escalates, breaths coming fast and uneven between frantic kisses, and John can only hold out a minute more before rolling Sherlock onto his back and climbing on top of him, slotting himself between Sherlock’s eagerly-spread legs.
“Yes, John.”
John shakes his head.  “And you… what, thought it was merely a coincidence that your targets
Sherlock nods, suddenly solemn.
At long last, John pulls himself upright into a sitting position, face still flushed and hair matted with sweat.  “Christ Almighty.”  He runs his fingers through his hair and hazards a glance over at Sherlock, who is still feeling rather gobsmacked and like his skin is so slick he may have physically fused with the sofa at some point during their coupling.  “You alright?”

“Successful, I suppose.  She’s at least speaking to me again.  Though I think she’s ignored the request for a Victoria Sponge entirely.  We’re going to end up with some triple-tier monstrosity, I can feel it.”  He sighs in resignation.
John laughs as he takes an appraising look down at Sherlock’s cock, which he’s pleased to see is rock-hard and leaking precome onto Sherlock’s quivering abs.  “Alright, then.  Your wish is my command.”  With that, he withdraws his fingers and grabs the lube, slicking up his own turgid member before reaching down to grasp Sherlock by the ankles.  He lifts up Sherlock’s legs to prop his ankles on his shoulders, tilting Sherlock’s pelvis back, giving John unfettered access to that most intimate place inside of him.
John cocks an eyebrow in amusement.  “How much?”
“How about you lift up this pesky little shirt,” he gives the hem of the ARMY shirt a teasing tug, “and let me watch while you play with your tits?”
“Mmmm, yes,
indeed.  Sherlock finds he likes this approach.
luck that the door he pulls open is that of the pub.  But that doesn’t matter; he settles himself at the bar, orders a whiskey neat, and proceeds to drown his sorrow.
And yet somehow, against all odds, here they are: Sherlock in nothing but a thin t-shirt and a pair of gorgeous, delicate panties, bent over the kitchen counter to allow John to ogle his arse to his heart’s content.
“You just thought it would be something special?”
The final ‘yes’ is more resolute, and John takes it as consent.
“Right, of course,
And then that had all gone rather spectacularly to shit, and for all the anguish it had caused, Sherlock was delighted when John finally came to his senses and realised that Sherlock was able to offer a lot as well-- though it was true their
“Nnngh.  S’rock, did you come?” He can barely form the words around his clumsy tongue, swollen with bliss.
Sherlock Holmes?”
John holds up the front page of the newspaper.  “Rumours are swirling that she’s positioned to become leader of the party.  Which means--”
“OH!  Oh, God…” John thrusts a bit harder, and Sherlock presses the vibrator firmly against him, eliciting a sharp grunt.
Sherlock remembers to keep his voice down, but honestly, how the hell does John expect him to respond?  He wants it all, he wants anything, he wants everything,
John steels himself for just a
Affection.  Sentiment.
That was a bit Not Good.  But desperate times called for desperate measures, and Sherlock needs to get back to the Work as soon as possible.
He finally turns back to the flat, and it’s not until he’s ascending the staircase that he realises he didn’t pick up dinner like he’d said he would.  Oh, well.
**********
When John comes back down the stairs a half hour later, Sherlock is fully dressed and just pulling on his coat.

Sherlock just moans and wriggles a bit; a calculated display of helplessness.
and amused titters that erupt among the onlookers.
John leans down and kisses him deeply, and Sherlock melts against his mouth.  He feels entirely consumed by the sensation, and he finds he doesn’t have the presence of mind to wonder where John is taking this anymore; he’s just along for the ride.
He clenches his jaw, straightens his spine, and speaks.  “I need you to force me.”
But now’s not the time to back down.  Instead, he offers a casual shrug and a virtuous smile.  “I’m just going to pop out to the restroom.  Perhaps by the time I’m back you’ll be in a state to socialise?”
“Yes.”
And it became very,
Sherlock’s voice rings steady but falsely light.  “Are you ready?”
“That depends.”
Mrs. H.  If there had been, God knows you’d’ve had a seat in the front row.  Hell, we would have asked you to
John chuckles, and Sherlock smiles at him despite himself.  “Okay, then.   So I think we need to be a little careful right now if we’re both going to get what we want, yeah?”
Sherlock had wanted to maintain the upper hand.  He truly had.  But suddenly, John is all confidence and defiance and raw, unmitigated strength, and Sherlock’s knees go weak and despite his intentions, he whimpers as his head drops back to expose his neck in supplication, his best-laid plans no match for his submissive tendencies when John was behaving like
John wanted to take it slowly this time.  The last time they’d tried this had been during a session, with Sherlock tied up and begging while John plundered him violently.  He’d envisioned that this time, he’d take it nice and slow, with long, languid thrusts that would warm them both up to the sensations gradually.
“In the past, I’ve engaged in those behaviours with people I didn’t care about.  People I didn’t even know.  And then there was the time… well, the time when I was really sick, and I did those things for the wrong reasons, and I learned to disassociate them from intimacy.  They were transactional.”
“Christ almighty, Sherlock, what did I ever do to deserve you, hmm?”  John presses a light kiss to the back of his neck, and a shiver dances its way up Sherlock’s spine.  He moans desperately, hoping John will hurry up, before he loses control altogether.  “Mmm, alright, love, going to fill you up now, yeah?”
<18:19> Not sure.  Lestrade’s running the whole team ragged, present company included.
“John, you’ve got so much lube on your hand we could subsist off of it for weeks.  Please. I want… I want it to burn.  Make it burn.  Please.”
“Alright, John.  I need to go to the bathroom and clean up.  Are you alright for now?”
back against the front of John’s denims, and the next thing he knew he was bent over the desk with his pajama pants yanked down around his thighs, dressing gown and t-shirt rucked up around his midriff, and John’s thick cock reaming him relentlessly as they both grunted and moaned in mutual pleasure, all intentions of tidying long past forgotten.
tell you how bad it had been for me, because you’d done it to save my life.  I thought placing the burden of my unravelling on you would be grossly unfair.”
<10:14> Sherlock, please respond.
“Hello, there.”  John’s voice is low and sultry, and Sherlock turns in heady anticipation.
His eyes flicker shut, and he’s back in his Fantasy Chamber.  Jude’s still naked in bed, but Sherlock decides he’d best not join him again; that would surely be flirting with disaster.  Instead, he positions himself in the chair in the corner as a shadowy figure emerges and makes his way to the bed.
John warms the flannel once more and washes him down in soft, loving strokes.  He’s so careful and cautious as he cleans between Sherlock’s cheeks, stroking his thigh soothingly as he murmurs words of praise and reminds him to
“So here’s a lovely letter we got from viewer Un-Christian Grey.” She lets out a rather endearing snicker at the pen name, and John finds himself smiling fondly in response.  “Our friend Un-Christian writes,

“Both?”
But this is what John wants from him.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows.  “Oh!  Yes, I’d… I’d like that very much.”
“Alright, John.  I’m not going to sugar coat this for you.  I wondered when we might get to this point, and it’s become apparent to me that it’s finally time.”
Sherlock whimpers a bit as the feeling recedes, disappearing back over the horizon but still shimmering dangerously beneath the surface.  He wills himself to take a deep breath.
Sherlock issues a frantic glance down, and John follows his gaze.  Luckily, his hands have remained resolutely within the lines.  “Yes, Captain.”
“Oh-- oh yeah, yeah, you like that?  You like my cock on your arse, you filthy slag?”
The thrill of those words zings straight down his spine to his groin, and his prick twitches in response.
John can feel Sherlock’s body begin to bow and tense, and he focuses every ounce of energy he has on pummeling his prostate directly, urging him towards release.
Sherlock somehow manages to shrug without missing a beat.  “No one ever complained of having too much cake at a party.”
hoping you could help me draft this email…”
“Good.”  John makes his way over to the chair in the corner, and Sherlock can hear him rummaging around.  There’s a pause, then a strange metallic
Javier seems to glow under his gaze.  “My partner and I started it about six years back--”
“Yes.  Now, there’s no way to screen volunteer counselors for whether they’re sex-positive using the website, but judging by the internet search histories of these six particular candidates, it seems they’d be open to counseling a same-sex couple, at the very least.”
John lets out a sigh like a deflating balloon, then shrugs his shoulders as if accepting defeat.  “Yeah.  Yeah, you’re right.  I have been thinking about it.  A lot.”
Even so, Sherlock had brought it up with Aaron the next time they went out, just the two of them.  Aaron had invited Sherlock to see a special exhibit on codebreaking that was currently at the War Rooms, and they’d agreed to grab a bite to eat beforehand.
Moira laughs, her eyes twinking with amusement.  “Alright, I’d best be off.  Wouldn’t want to keep you boys from getting home to your
“Sounds delightful.  Sorry to be missing it.”
John gives Sherlock a look like he’s lost his damn mind, but he swings his legs over the edge of the bed and plods to the kitchen, returning a few moments later.
“Okay.  Deep breath in.”  Sherlock breathes in and closes his eyes.  “Good.  Now, exhale.”  Sherlock does, and as he does so, John forces his cock in alongside the wand.
“Good.”  John’s voice is soft, and his fingers comb gently through Sherlock’s curls.  “You feeling alright?  You were pretty far under there at the end.”
“Feeling good, love?”
hard and looks rather capable of penetrating stone.
“Yes.  Just… hold still for a minute, please.”
“So yes, after several hours of reading about this process, I was turned on by the notion of it.  And the whiskey had admittedly lowered my inhibitions, so I just… went with it.”
But this was Sherlock, after all.
The name dredges up a toxic mix of unwanted emotions, which John promptly drowns in another long swill of lager.  “How is he?”
“Mmm.” He gives another nod and rolls his neck luxuriously.  “Better than okay.  Good.  I feel good. Thank you.”
“I say

the right amount of pressure, Sherlock isn’t aroused in the least.
“Please, John, you know it’s entirely dependent on the situation.  In fact, I’ve just remembered that I believe I have a long-standing request in for a particular Victorian-themed session based on the acclaimed film
Ever so slowly, he trails his fingers along the hem of the panties, where the fabric meets the exquisite curve of Sherlock’s cheeks.  Sherlock trembles and moans as John slowly pulls the fabric up, exposing just slightly more of the swell of his buttocks, creamy and soft.  John can’t resist more than a moment before leaning forward to lick and nibble along the crease where Sherlock’s buttocks meet his thighs.
“Use your words, sweetheart.  Does this feel good?”

Greg overflatters them and credits them for his own meteoric success, a claim which Sherlock resoundingly refuses to let John refute.  Molly tells the story of the first time she met Sherlock, the details of which are so gruesome that Sherlock’s mother is looking a bit green about the gills by the time she’s done talking (John notes that both Molly and Sherlock have similar penchants for their inability to read a room).  Mike Stamford tells an embarrassing story about some of John’s antics from their rugby days.  Danny says some rather lovely things about John as a leader and an inspiration for veterans, which makes John worry he may be about to cry until Jenny steps in and tells a humourous anecdote about the time she and Sherlock took the kids to the museum and somehow nearly lost all three simultaneously.  Sherlock’s parents give John much more credit than he feels he deserves in the events that turned Sherlock’s life around, and he has to swallow hard to choke out a

to back Sherlock up until his knees catch on the edge of the bed, sending him tumbling down onto it with an undignified yelp.  It just sort of
Sherlock responds with something that may be John’s name, or perhaps simply a series of random syllables strung together; John’s not quite sure which.
Finally, John seems to have had his fill.  He plants a wet kiss between Sherlock’s shoulder blades before pulling out, then taps his hip, indicating he wants him to turn over.  Sherlock complies thoughtlessly, and John clambers up to kiss him enthusiastically on lips.
Sherlock holds.  John takes hold of the rope dangling from his ankle and masterfully, carefully weaves a simple diamond pattern down his shin and around his thigh, locking Sherlock’s leg in a bent position.  Sherlock trembles under his touch, but stays calm.
“Well, I guess that’s the sign we’d best move on, here.”
So John steels his resolve, sets his shoulders, and resolutely marches up the stairs.  He finds Sherlock seated at the desk in the sitting room surrounded by a staggering collection of newspaper clippings.  Mycroft, John notes with a prickle, is sitting in John’s chair, leaning back as though he owns the place.
Looking back, the encounter was tame compared to what they’ve become, but John can still feel his cheeks flush as he recalls the way Sherlock had whimpered and moaned when John tangled his hands in his hair and stuffed his cock brutally as far down his throat as he could, until Sherlock was gasping and choking around it.
“Oh, love, you’re being so good.  Say my name.”
“Okay.  We’ll go really slowly.  I think for now it’s best I don’t turn on the vibrations, right?  Or do you want them?”
John’s using his Captain Voice now, the tone he

“There’s a proper office down there now.  We have a strict ‘No Sociopaths Upstairs’ rule, of which you’re currently in violation.  So if you’d be so kind?” He gestures firmly towards the front door.

“Yes, it did, but the ends don’t always justify the means.  You’re a recovering addict, Sherlock.  And you refuse professional help, and while I understand there are a lot of factors in your past that make you averse to that, I can’t be your therapist.  I’m your partner.  If I’m tying you up, I want it to be because it turns us both on, not to keep you from sticking a needle in your arm.”
He felt unusually shaky and unmoored as he and John collected themselves, and their usual post-coital banter felt thick on Sherlock’s tongue as John re-fastened his flies and Sherlock pulled up his pajamas and adjusted his dressing gown.  His orgasm had been so shocking, so
“Well, don’t we?”
“No, no, that was incredible, it was perfect, I just thought…”
But for now, John simply presses the plug inside of him, and pulls Sherlock into his arms.
“Are they… approved?”
Before he knows it, he’s sweating and moaning obscenely, fingers twisted in the sheets as he clenches his arsecheeks around the plug and grinds himself down against the infuriatingly soft surface beneath him.  He buries his face against the pillow, sinking his teeth into it, trying with all his might to distract himself from the tightening sensation coiling deep in his gut.  He whimpers and ruts harder, his body urging him towards release.
And so on.
“Am I… is this… good?  Is it… what you want?”
He continues to glide his fingers across Sherlock’s torso as he speaks, keeping his tone low and conversational.  “Yeah?  What did you and Aaron do?”
John.  Does this feel okay?”  He shifts a bit, and John grunts at the intrusion.
John knows for a fact that Sherlock’s relationship with Victor was complicated, and that their sex life had been even more so.  Sherlock had told John about the ways Victor had maneuvered outside of Mycroft’s jurisdiction over Sherlock’s activities by almost exclusively involving third parties in their sex life, allowing Sherlock to play the role of voyeur while Victor himself engaged in the actual sex.  The arrangement had always struck John as rather pervy and taboo… yet somehow also more than a little hot.

everything is.
“You alright, love?”
“Ah!  Gah!”  Sherlock’s body clenches instinctively at the sudden intrusion, but John is merciless; he simply tightens his grip, locks Sherlock into place, then proceeds to ream him mercilessly.
“No, John.”  Sherlock’s voice is muffled slightly against the floorboards.
“Pity.  What a fucking waste.”
John mercifully pulls away from his prick, and Sherlock sighs with relief.  But John is glaring down at him, and Sherlock suddenly realises that something dreadful is about to happen.
which Sherlock had never heard of but upon seeing it starred Julia Roberts, he wasn’t surprised.  Julia was one of John’s perpetual celebrity crushes.  Sherlock found he didn’t mind that crush; it was certainly better than John’s obvious attraction to Jennifer Lawrence, which Sherlock had previously deduced had more to do with her breasts than her acting abilities.  But John liked Julia Roberts as an
He can hardly wait.
Sherlock purses his lips.  “Fair point.”
Sherlock floats and drifts, his skin tingling and his body pliant and spent.  John talks to him the whole time he’s away in the bedroom while Sherlock is in the bath, and he makes Sherlock keep responding, which he begrudgingly does.  Then Sherlock realises that John is probably making sure Sherlock doesn’t just disappear under the water and drown himself in a sea of dopamine, so he responds a bit more politely after that.
Sherlock grinned up at him.  John grinned back, then took a deep breath.  “Alright, Sherlock?”
“Get your hands out of my hair.  Cross your wrists above your head.”  Sherlock complies so quickly he doesn’t even process the command before his arms are raised above him, hands touching.   His chest feels tight.
“Cheers to that.  How is Emily, by the way?”
“You’re welcome, love.  Now stay there.”  John turns and makes his way to the bathroom to retrieve the medical shears from under the sink (he always makes sure to have them on-hand when they’re playing with bondage, in case he needs to cut the ropes in an emergency).  He’s not concerned about Sherlock running away anymore; usually once he’d been taken, he grew endearingly complacent.
Just living up to my personal life motto: "Don't worry, it gets worse."
Dr. Richards cocks her head.  “You really believe that’s what they’d think?”
John gives him a wary glare.  “It’s too much.  It’s too much when I have to force you.”
Sherlock still doesn’t respond.
John can feel his release on the horizon.  It’s distant, but there, drawing ever closer as he hurls towards its inevitable arrival.  He grunts and grips Sherlock’s leg even harder, pistoning into him, and Sherlock whimpers, but it’s still not quite enough…
understand what Sherlock sees in the man; he is, by all accounts, drop-dead gorgeous.
Thank you all SO MUCH for the comments!  It makes me feel so connected and improves my sanity greatly.  Keep 'em coming!
“Down.”  Sherlock drops to his knees immediately, and John gives his hair a fond tousle before turning away from him to rummage through the drawer in the nightstand.  “Did he fuck your face, or did he make you do the work?”
Sherlock blinks twice, his hard drive reluctantly flickering back online.
“But your handlers wanted you to take your targets there?”
Sherlock glances back at John over his shoulder.  “Could I get you saying that on the record for the next time I spill acid on the kitchen table?”
The officer shook his head.  “Nah, mate, he somehow slipped away.  We’re about to get a massive manhunt underway.”
Why?  What have I done?”
First, there’s air, then blissful, blessed water.  The impact doesn’t hurt; it’s simply a transitioning of states as he breaks beneath the surface and sinks into the inky water’s depths.
“Well, a less generous interpretation of those facts would simply be that she and I get on so well because we have similar maturity levels, but for now, I’ll take the compliment.”
John stares down at him for a moment, sex-drunk and dazed.  And then he
John pauses.  “No, they don’t.  They tell the truth.”
This… this wasn’t a good idea.  At all.  They were both emotionally vulnerable, raw and aching--the exact opposite of the circumstances in which a power exchange should occur.  But suddenly, the idea of dominating Sherlock, of making him crawl and beg and scream and cry, is so consuming that John almost can’t breathe for the want of it.  He wants to fucking tear Sherlock apart.
“Down.”  Sherlock drops his hand back to the floor.  “All the way.  Onto your front.  Now.”  Sherlock dutifully lowers his body to the floor, hissing as his cock comes into contact with the rug.  He turns his head to the side and closes his eyes, clearly no longer interested in attempting to predict what John’s about to do to him.
“And do you believe that the other men who witnessed those actions have kept their findings to themselves?”
it wasn’t like that here.  This wasn’t a threat or a punishment.  Sherlock was asking for something he
“Good!  Good, love, very good, you’re so good for me, coming like that.  Shhh, easy now, just relax, let it all out, shhh…”
John reaches up and cups his jaw tenderly.
John sighs and lowers himself into the chair across from Sherlock’s, digging into his own bagel with a satisfied expression as he picks up the newspaper.
John takes a step back and glances towards Jude.  “Alright.  Go ahead, then.”
John pulls back and stares up at him, his eyes fond as he runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  “You alright, you?”
Sherlock glares up at him.  “Why, you’d prefer I were watching some nice, filthy porn instead?”
“Oh, John, sweetpea, yes!  Mmmm, just like that, oh,
Sherlock swallows and struggles to form a sentence.  Finally, he gives up and settles for a word.
“Level… Two?  Of what?”
we were friends and all…”
The sound of his mobile ringing in the kitchen snaps Sherlock back to reality.  He’d been dazedly staring at his poster of the Periodic Table for an indeterminate amount of time, his brain uncluttered and serene.  Normally he’d be taking the opportunity to recite his favourite combustible compounds, or perhaps mentally rearranging the elements by atomic weight, but not today, not right now.  Right now he’d just been blinking mindlessly at the poster, uncomprehending, unperturbed, reality sliding in and out of focus like slides on a carousel.
to mate with, oh
It’s not always sexual when they finish a session like the one they’ve just had.  In fact, it’s quite rare-- Sherlock generally needs to sleep once his Dark Mood has lifted; he’s usually in need of a long respite.  But tonight, he doesn’t feel the sweeping waves of exhaustion that often overtake him once they’re finished.  Instead, he just wants to be
“Of course.”
Finally, Sherlock opens his eyes and speaks, his voice high and desperate, his hands resolutely pressing John’s thighs apart.  “I like… Christ, John, the way the thick head breaches my rim as you force your way inside of me.  The way the girth of your shaft stretches me when you impale me, so big and long and hard, the biggest cock I’ve ever,
He continues to toy with just the tip of Sherlock’s member, the most sensitive part of him, and Sherlock cries out in agony.
John licks his lips and tries to read Sherlock’s expression.  There’s something there that isn't there normally.  It looks almost like… trepidation?  Concern?
Aaron could be about things.
<16:42> We haven’t spoken since
He wills his tongue to form the words he needs to say.  “Can you untie my legs first?”  The thought of being touched again in such a sensitive place while his mobility is still restricted feels too… clawing, too oppressive.
“Nnngh.  It’s okay, Sherlock, we should make this quick.  Go ahead.”
“Good.”  John grabs a length of rope, drops to his knees, and begins to weave an elaborate pattern of knots from Sherlock’s ankle to his knee.  It’s a pretty, intricate design, and Sherlock watches the mirror in rapt fascination as John conjures it seemingly from nowhere.  He loves watching John work on him like this; it’s like watching an artist in motion.
John had turned and stared Sherlock straight in the eye. “So you decided to keep me alive.  Suffering, but alive, so you wouldn’t have to deal with my death as you would if our positions had been reversed.  You thought I’d just feel
Sherlock shifts and crosses his legs, taking a measured sip of tea.  He is the epitome of composure; John’s relief feels palpable.  “I do work with the police, but more on the forensic side of things.  Where policework and science intersect, as it were.”
“For Christ’s sake, John, we’re a bunch of gay men living in one of the largest metropolises in the world, this is hardly the kinkiest shit they’ve seen go down-- this is just another damn Friday night.  Live it up a little, yeah?”
“Oh, gorgeous, love, beautiful!”
“Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Ohhhhhhhh!”  Sherlock’s issuing strange, bitten-off grunts as he takes each thrust, and John redoubles his efforts as he feels Sherlock’s passage begin to flutter and constrict.
Sherlock’s brow furrows.  “Aren’t you staying here tonight?”
He wants to put him on his knees and wrap a belt around his throat and remind him that
“Mmmm!” With one final grunt, John snaps his hips and yanks Sherlock’s head forward until his nose is pressed firmly against John’s pubis.  There’s a pregnant pause, then a moment later, the taste of John’s come floods Sherlock’s mouth and throat.
“You volunteer at a youth center?”
“Who?” John has lost the conversation completely.
John looks him straight in the eye, and nods.
But would he like a sandwich?
The moment is broken by Javier’s interjection, and John and the girl both glance up at the two Doms seated above them, eyeing them appraisingly.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed.  What he’d done wasn’t
John unties the rest of the ropes and rubs out Sherlock’s arms and legs, checking for any signs of restricted bloodflow.  He wipes down Sherlock’s torso and cock and arse with a warm, wet flannel.  He helps Sherlock to sit, pressing soft, sweet kisses against his neck as Sherlock whimpers and moans from the pain.  He gets Sherlock to stand, and wraps him in a dressing gown before gently guiding him upstairs.
Sherlock very diplomatically does not say
a scenario I’d taken into consideration.  Alas, the best-laid plans…”  She lapses off into a ponderous silence, her gaze distant.
“Sorry,” Sherlock muttered around a mouthful of curry as he collapsed onto the sofa next to John.  “Long day.  Lestrade had me cross-referencing phone records from 1992.  Honestly, the fact that I’m currently the only person in the entire department with a photographic memory is a disgrace.  Anyway, you know nicotine helps when I’m working with numbers.”
After all, he’d gone thirty plus years of his life with no sex at all!  How bad could it be to tone it down a bit?
Unfortunately, it appears his indignation is contagious; John’s cheeks have flushed an angry red, his comforting smile quickly transforming into a defensive snarl.  “The other night.  You said.  You said you wanted.”  He pauses, and Sherlock waits with bated breath; he honestly has
“No!”  Sherlock spins around wildly, which proves to be a bit much for his current condition; he slumps back against the wall, but keeps his gaze focused on John, willing him to understand.  His breaths are coming in aborted gasps, making speech a bit of a struggle. “It’s not.  Too much.  It feels.  Good.  I need.  To adjust.  For a second.  Please.”

Sherlock licks his lips and takes a diplomatic pause.  “My apologies, but I don’t recall--”
“That’s a no.”
“Come sit in this chair, love.”  He gestures towards the chair beside the wardrobe.

Of course.
so, he could avoid orgasm for a little while longer.
Moira shakes her head, her gorgeous brown locks shining in the dim candlelight (God, Sherlock is starting to really detest her, was it possible she even had better

“Excellent.  So your airflow will be restricted at times, but it shouldn’t be enough to cause dizziness or lightheadedness.  If you experience either of those things, or anything feels tighter than you want it to be, you need to let me know.  Understood?”
John’s hands feel warm and firm on his hips.  John’s not setting the pace, no, he’s let Sherlock take the reins for the time being, but even so, the sensation of his palms against Sherlock’s oscillating waist is grounding and affirming in a way he can’t quite quantify.  Sherlock bites his lip and zeroes in on that pressure-- of John holding him, not
(he takes the opportunity to dramatically clench his fingers in the chestnut-brown crown adorning his head), “you won’t make eye contact with me.  You’re sitting as far away from me as possible.  And when we were leaving the courtroom, you didn’t even want to be
“Yes, John.”
He wailed and thrashed and bucked as streaks of come pulsed out of his cock and up his abdomen, some hitting him as far up as his clavicle.  Throughout the ordeal, Sherlock seemed torn between squinting his eyes shut, and wrenching them open to take in the wanton display still playing out on the computer screen.
“Not really.  Watched a few cryptography documentaries.  Cooked.  Went to the gym.”
but there’s a moment in every encounter like this one when he just…

“Maybe you needed me around.”
John digs his nails into Sherlock’s tender flesh, locks him into place, and comes.
“The transfer’s been aborted.  They’re on to us.  We need to move
“John.  Please.”  Sherlock’s hands tighten on John’s thighs.  He could feel the muscles flexing as John’s body prepared for release.
“Sixteen total.”
“Open wide, sweetheart.  Let me fuck your face, yeah?”
but he’d accommodated Sherlock’s request, and had soon after started bringing him to orgasm fast and hard within minutes, then indulging them both in long sessions of languid, sensual sex in the aftermath.
He eyes Sherlock’s half-erect member.  “Did you touch yourself?”
Oh, well.  Nothing for it, then.  With a resigned sigh, he shifts his weight forward to free up his other hand, which he brings to his balls and gives them a light tug.  He grunts as the pleasure zings up his spine, and behind him, he can feel John gasp--clearly the sensation had just caused his passage to tighten around John’s cock.
“Good hurt.”
The next thing Sherlock knows, he can feel streaks of hot come spilling onto his lower back as Seb wails wantonly against the sweaty skin of his throat.  It’s absolutely filthy.
A look of realisation is suddenly dawning on John’s face, and the next thing Sherlock knows, John’s surging forward and wrapping him into a tight grounding embrace.  “Oh shit, shit, Sherlock, I’m sorry, I’m
They both dissolve into giggles, and it’s a few moments before they’re calm enough to carry on.  John continues to finger Sherlock open as Sherlock stimulates his own nipples, sighing and arching as the sensations wash over him, and John just sits back and admires the view.
Javier laughs, a rather obnoxious sound, if John thinks about it.  He hazards a glance at the girl kneeling next to him, who gives him another smile and a coy wink.  He licks his lips and smiles back.  Two could play at this game.
Jenny blinks.  “You were there as well?”
Sherlock is fisting himself in earnest now, one hand flying over his turgid prick as the other snakes into his trousers to cup his balls.  Tentatively he extends his pointer finger to stroke lightly over his own hole.  He never penetrates himself when they’re doing this, but he likes the idea of
There’s a pause, then the sound of silk against the leather sofa as Sherlock sinks back into it.  And then the unmistakable sound of skin on skin.
Sherlock slowly regains awareness of his surroundings.  John is still on top of him, thrusting lazily into his passage, and he’s peppering Sherlock’s face with gentle, reverent kisses.  Sherlock can breathe again, so he knows John must have finished inside him.  That means that Sherlock was
Sherlock stares blankly back at him.
in a unique, wholly consuming way that baffles his admittedly prodigious mind.  Moments ago he’d been all strut and swagger, yet all it takes is one sloppy grope and some murmured words in a banquet hall loo and he’s rattled to his very core, resisting the compelling urge to go to his knees right there in the middle of the restroom floor.  It’s a dizzying, dazzling sensation, and he reels from it.
Dutifully, Sherlock takes another stair, and then another.  He’s still rolling his hips, oscillating his pelvis, seeking to dull the sensation pulsing relentlessly inside him.  He can feel the sweat trickling from his brow down his temples, feel the sinew in his arms straining and his muscles shaking, feel his reddened glutes flexing and releasing with each step he ascends.  He loses himself in the pure physicality of it, in the incessant need to exert ultimate control over his own transport, and to demonstrate that control for John.
Sherlock is lost.  “Excuse me?”
Sherlock can’t help but grin up at him; he can’t believe he makes John
“I had some hypothesis all along based on your past behaviour.  Then seeing your childhood home today confirmed what I’d long suspected.”
is, I should have spent last night reviewing Molly’s notes on the medical records--”
The press of his lips is chaste and innocent, and it takes Sherlock rather by surprise.  He’d assumed that tonight John would be all heat and harsh demands, spurned on by days of frustration surrounded by his infuriating family.  But instead, he is careful, reverent, kind…  His lips move against Sherlock’s gently, tender in his ministrations as his tongue presses lightly forward, imploring Sherlock for entrance.  Sherlock grants it without thinking.
He lowers his head and feasts on them.  He licks them, suckles them, and nips and the fleshiest bits, and she loves every second of it, growing wetter and wetter around him.  She reaches down to hold them up for him, cupping them in her perfect hands, holding them up like an offering, and he indulges to the fullest…
He tips his head to the side wordlessly, exposing the column of his neck in supplication.  He’d have to be blind to miss the way John’s pupils dilate at the sight, the way his fingers shake ever so slightly as he reaches forward to hook the metal clasp around the ring of Sherlock’s collar.
He raises and lowers himself in minute increments, sliding further down Sherlock’s shaft with each oscillation.  Eventually he’s able to release his hold on Sherlock’s cock and reach forward to steady himself with his hands on Sherlock’s thighs, and with a breathy sigh, he slides the rest of the way down until his cheeks are resting firmly on Sherlock’s lap.
on Sherlock and refused to let him come altogether, neither of them had reviewed the experience particularly favourably.  He’s a little bewildered that John’s even bringing it up again.
John cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably.  “Um, yes.”
Wrong move.  The new angle causes the plug to press directly against his prostate, and a fresh wave of agony overtakes him.  He feels his limp cock jerk in John’s hand, and John issues a deep, dark chuckle.  Then he pulls Sherlock’s shaft fully into his mouth once more.
John establishes a steady pace, then yanks the belt taut around Sherlock’s throat, choking him out.
“Lovely.”  John reaches down and fastens the belt around Sherlock’s throat, then wraps the loose end around his own hand and gives it a light tug.  “Now, stand up and follow me.”
John indulges him for a long time, giving him the most decadent rimming of his life.  All thoughts of his own enjoyment fly out the window as he focuses on Sherlock’s reaction to the thought of Aaron doing this to him.  It’s so erotic, John can barely think.

“You alright, love?”
But something about having Aaron’s fingers
“Yes,

be; he couldn’t imagine the groundskeepers kept any sort of fact-checking tabs in regards to whether their wards were, in fact, still deceased.  He thought that perhaps Mycroft would have ordered it removed, but it was a detail so trivial there was no wonder it hadn’t crossed his mind.  Or perhaps it had, and his brother’s macabre sense of humour had gotten the better of him.
Sherlock wipes the spit from his lips, but he keeps his eyes resolutely shut.  “I liked… I liked how hot it was.  He was so hard, John, he felt like velvet steel in my mouth.”  John almost giggles at Sherlock’s erotic turn of phrase, but manages to hold back.  “And the way he looked at me…
“Nnnnnngh…”  Sherlock can’t form words anymore.  He’s spellbound by the rapture of his Transport, utterly transfixed by this transcendent journey of sensation.  He grips the chain of the handcuffs tight, and endures.
Wasn’t it?
John gently guides the vibrator to Sherlock’s fluttering hole, then presses it inside in a single, slow thrust, just the way he knows Sherlock lies.
Sherlock went off like a porn star.
Sherlock shrugs.  “I have a source.”
“Gay.  You’re gay, John.”  Despite himself, John lets out an exasperated snort.  Sherlock purses his lips.  “All of two minutes ago, you had me bent over with your cock in my arse.  It wasn’t the first time, and I doubt it’ll be the last.”
smiles, the kind that make John feel simultaneously giddy and hopelessly infatuated.  The tension between them seems to melt away, and John can feel his posture relaxing as he pulls Sherlock’s palm up to his lips for a kiss.
There’s no way he’d be able to keep up the act much longer.  While Sherlock’s self-consciousness seemed to be doing a number on his current ability to perform accurate deductions, John knows it won’t last-- Sherlock can detect John’s sex-flush from a mile away, and he’s certainly living on borrowed time as-is.
Sherlock bites back an indignant retort-- John was really planning to simply use him and then leave

have come up with an experiment to determine which of John’s partners gave him the most sexual pleasure.  He’d come up with a list of indicators, and determined which ones would be easiest to observe without incurring suspicion.
“OH!  John, yes!”  Sherlock’s hands grab the sheets and twist, his shoulders flexing as John begins to ride him, pinning him helplessly to the mattress with the force of his thrusts.
This is something else entirely, terrible in its intensity.  Sherlock had already come six times, and each time had been earth-shattering; he’s fairly certain he’s not going to be able to come again tonight.  Whatever John is doing, it’s not to bring Sherlock pleasure.
John gently places his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks and pulls them apart.
John notes his hands are clenched into fists.

There’s a beat.
“Good?”
for John.  “Yes.  Yes, please, John.  I’ll be good.  I’ll be so good for you.”
He keeps his tone low and measured.  “No, love, that’s fine, it’s all fine.  He and I just want to make you feel good.  Whatever it takes to make you feel good.”
“I’m so glad.”  John’s voice is infuriatingly casual.  The next thing Sherlock knows, John’s turned to grab one of the leather armchairs, and he’s positioning it directly behind where Sherlock remains resolutely knelt.  “So now I’d like to make you feel good, love.  Will you let me play with you a bit?”  John lowers himself into the chair and brackets Sherlock’s torso with his spread legs.
“Don’t apologise, John, it would take a lot more than that to scandalise a man of my station.”

“Yes.  I’m okay.  Just need a moment.”
John cocked his head.  “Well, no.  I mean, Mrs. H lets us store the mannequins down there, I suppose maybe she’d let us add on a few boxes of books if you really need them, but honestly, Sherlock, it seems we could just do away with most of these--”

at him, too, making a rather obvious show of checking him out, and John finds himself secretly delighting a bit in her attention.  Her eyes roam their way across his broad shoulders, his muscular chest (he’s suddenly glad Sherlock had insisted on him wearing his tightest black shirt), then down further, to where his thighs frame the V of his form-fitting trousers.  She licks her own lips.  They’re pillowy and petal pink and John finds himself suddenly wondering what they would feel like against his own.
He tosses the gun onto the pillow and climbs onto the bed, pressing Sherlock’s legs apart as he fumbles with his own flies.  He pulls out his cock and gives it a few resolute tugs, then runs his fingers around Sherlock’s inflamed hole.
new friend? Implausible, and yet…), and John is affectionate, loving, and kind.

“Oh, yeah, that’s it, Sherlock!  Oh, yeah, take that cock, just like that, fuck, you ride it so goo-- well!  You ride it so well!”
Sherlock narrows his eyes.  “I can say with a rather high degree of certainty that we did no such thing.”
John clenches his jaw but gives her a curt nod.  “I’ll be down in a minute.”  He’s forced to accept the fact that he’d rather not leave her unsupervised, even in their workspace.
“You going to be good for me today?”
Sherlock’s eyes fly open wide as John rides him, reaching forward to brace against the armrest of the sofa to give himself better purchase to grind against Sherlock’s prone form.
If she wanted to be punished, she’d refuse your orders or provoke you directly.  But she’s not doing that, is she?  No, she’s simply testing you, pushing your boundaries to keep herself engaged, and to me, that indicates that she’s acting out because she’s

The thought flashes through Sherlock’s mind in an instant.  It wasn’t that he didn’t
“Ohhhh, you like what I’ve done to you, sweetheart?”  John’s voice is startlingly close, and Sherlock blinks his eyes open to find John standing mere inches away, staring down at him with rapt attention.  Seems his techniques had worked quite the charm… Internally, he preens.

“My face--” John lightly strokes Sherlock’s jawline-- “My chest--” John’s thumbs pluck mischievously at Sherlock’s erect nipples-- “My thighs--” John runs his hands over his muscular form-- “My… my cock?”
“I do, but I
“So you… know for a fact she’d approve of your relationship.  And what about your lifestyle?  London? Raising Rosie in the city with a community of caregivers?”
Sherlock nearly barks out a laugh; there was no chance in hell he was moving so much as an inch in either direction, but the irony seems to be lost on John entirely.
John grimaces.  “And let me beat the shit out of you.”
“Put your arms up on the armrests, yes, just like that, sweetheart.  You remember our rules: No moving or speaking unless it’s to snap or tell me something doesn’t feel right, or you want to stop.  I’ll be restricting your movement but not your blood flow, so if you feel any sensations of tingling or numbness, I need you to tell me immediately.  Understood?”
“Good.”  John lapses into silence, the only sound the obscene slap of skin on skin.
still be around…
It’s not instantaneous, as John had thought it would be.  Sherlock twitches and moans for a few more minutes, eyes wild and desperate as they lock with John’s.  It’s clear that if he were able to use any of his usual tricks (dropping down onto his elbows to change the angle of penetration, oscillating his hips to control the rhythm of the pressure against his prostate, perhaps even tugging his own balls or pressing against his perineum to increase the intensity of the sensations), he’d have gone off in seconds flat.  But as it stands, Sherlock is completely immobilized by John’s commands, and he’s helpless to do anything besides hold still, and wait.
<19:56> Yes, I’m aware knowing the washing properties of cottons does not merit permanent status in the Palace.
“Gah!”  Christ, was John actually going to take him almost

crossing John’s lips has triggered his deepest, most primal fear, and he’s spinning dangerously out of control.
John is taking control, he’s--
John grins to himself as he notes Sherlock’s thighs are trembling with the effort of holding back, but seconds later Sherlock is threading his fingers through John’s hair to hold his mouth in place; he must not be
“Now.  I’m going to get comfortable.”  John takes a few deliberate paces and lowers himself back into his chair, perching himself on the edge of the seat.  “Now, sweetheart… come here.”
“Oh, fuck.  Is that good, sweetheart?  Your cock got
But before it can get too far, John relents, relinquishing control back to Sherlock as John resettles into the mattress with a contented chuckle.
And with that, Sherlock turns and marches resolutely towards the door.
“Alright.”  Sherlock sounds a bit breathless, and John notes he’s twisting his wrist as he fingers himself, furthering the stretch.
“Um, yeah, just… coat.” He stands and hastily turns his back to Sherlock as he shimmies into his coat and swiftly as possible.  Then he turns to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
Sherlock moans and resumes fellating the vibrator with voracious enthusiasm as John slowly reaches down and unfastens his own trousers and begins to stroke himself to full hardness, imagining Sherlock on his knees in the entryway of Aaron’s flat, servicing him while Aaron stared down at him, glassy-eyed and tongue-tied in backlit darkness.
John has to fight back a giggle at Sherlock’s characteristic formality.  “But as you know, I also like having sex with you when… well, when you’re wearing feminine clothing.  Your heels and stockings and garters and panties and… and all that.  Celebrating your femininity as well as your masculinity is important to me, too.  I don’t want to dismiss that.  And even though you identify as cisgender, I do think that aspect of our relationship is worth acknowledging.”
“You feeling good, love?”
But before he can process it, the tears are coming in an overwhelming surge, and he’s sobbing, relief coursing through his veins as the sensation of John’s hands cleansing his skin soothes something deep beneath the surface of his epidermis.  It’s a relief so thick it’s nearly palpable; the can taste it on his tongue, he can smell it mingling with the sandalwood, he can feel it in the cool weight of John’s dog tags resting against his sternum.  It is affirmation, pure and simple.
“Mmmph.  That was ‘mazing.”  Sherlock seems totally dazed, John notes with a sense of satisfaction.  He leans down to press their lips together, then pulls back and smiles down at him indulgently.
And with that, John pushes the dildo in as far as it will go, until Sherlock feels the flared base seated firmly against his rim.  John keeps one hand on the base of the dildo, holding it in place, while his other massages Sherlock’s arsecheek.
Sherlock closes his eyes and attempts to block out the shrill buzz of the chainsaw emanating from the television.  Across the room on the sofa, John and Lestrade are issuing ear-splitting cackles of horror between bouts of hysterical laughter, the bottle of whiskey on the coffee table between them looking considerably emptier than the last time Sherlock checked.  He resists the urge to bury his head in his arms and weep.
John bites his lip and looks again, then rakes his eyes back up her body to meet her gaze.
it takes all of his resolve not to go to his knees then and there.
God damn it.
Sherlock didn’t say
22:03.  Surely not too late to call John.
“Good, John.  Feels-- nngh!” (he arches as John strikes his prostate directly with his cock) “--Feels good.”
“What are you thinking about?”  John can’t help but ask; Sherlock looks impossibly far away.
John swallows.  “I’m… I’m sorry.  For… for what I said last night.  I didn’t mean that… that being gay is bad.  You… you know that, right?”
The steady buzz of voices from downstairs drags John reluctantly back into the present.  He and Sherlock are splayed out side by side, almost comically cramped on John’s tiny bed.  He feels utterly wrung out, and it’s with a low groan that he pulls himself into a sitting position and rises unsteadily to his feet.  Sherlock makes an exasperated sound and yanks the pillow over his head.
John swallows.  “Oh… okay?  So do you just want to… um, lie down?”
His erection forces its way prominently to the forefront of his consciousness.  He can feel himself engorged and throbbing, swinging heavily between his own thighs with every slap of John’s hand.  He adjusts the angle of his hips just a bit so that his cock brushes up against John’s calf.  It feels good.
But it seemed that Sherlock’s motives were exactly as they seemed: he wanted to get his mother off his back, and the easiest way to do that was to show up on her doorstep and hand over her beloved granddaughter to her doting care.
He can’t be arsed to care.  It feels
“I’m doing exactly what you want me to do.”
“Danny’s a nice bloke.  He and John met through the rugby league?”
By the time John makes his way down to 221C, he feels weary.  Rosie’d fallen asleep fairly easily, but the prospect of starting another row with Sherlock feels preemptively exhausting.  Even so, he forces his feet to march down the stairs into the newly-transformed space.
John tries not to take offense.  He knows deep down that his
For a second he thinks he might lose it, but the next thing he knows, John is pinching his right nipple,

He hadn’t sought them out, not by a long shot.  He’d been walking home one evening after a few pints with Stamford at the Allsop Arms when a mannequin in a store window caught his attention out of the corner of his eye, and he’d ground to an abrupt halt.  He wasn’t quite sure what it was about the panties that grabbed him initially, but upon closer inspection, they just seemed somehow so…
“You feeling good, love?”
John raises an eyebrow.  “With whom?”
so beautiful… you’re getting so full, aren’t you, love?”
and in an instant his nervous system is shot to hell as every fibre of his transport lights up with that impossible invisible electricty that only John can spark in him.
Sherlock gives him his most winning smile.  “Yes, please, John, that would be perfect.  And tea.  Definitely tea.”
Sherlock attempts to devote his attention single-mindedly to the stimulation his cock is receiving.  He just needed to

would he?  No, of course not, not for this…
“I… it felt so good, John, I couldn’t… I couldn’t stop…”
John swallows and wills himself to continue. “Did you… did he ever tell you… why he did it?”
“So, last week we had a… well, a… an argument.  About… well, it was about something personal that we don’t need to go into, but I realised afterwards a big part of it is that… that I don’t think I ever got over his death.”
He focuses on that sensation, on that
“Mmmhmm.”
“Ferns? Is that so?”  He peers appraisingly down at her drawing as Rosie nods matter-of-factly.  “Did you know that ferns have neither seeds nor flowers?”
And then John dips his head and firmly sucks Sherlock’s left nipple into his mouth and bites down on the peaked tip.
John and
“And then… and then--” Sherlock sounds a bit dazed, and his breath hitches; John can tell he’s added a third finger to his preparations.  “And then you’ll come in me.  Fill me up with your massive prick, put your come so far inside me with it that I’ll be carrying you for days.  And every time you look at me… you’ll know.”
While they wait for the food, John changes out of his damp clothes into fresh jeans and one of his more endearingly fuzzy sweaters, all while updating Sherlock on the events of his day.  Sherlock pays attention and responds at appropriate moments, and he resolutely looks away from John’s arse as he bends down to rummage for his toiletry kit.  Now that the panic and anger have dissipated, Sherlock’s gradually becoming aware of the low-watt arousal thrumming through his veins; it’s been so
However, John doesn’t seat it fully.  He stops after perhaps an inch, then pulls it back out again, making a pleased little humming sound.
“Yes.”  The word is muffled and curt, but it’ll have to suffice.
Well, perhaps he’s not a
forcing him to move in more demanding strokes.
Sherlock places the panties gingerly back into the box, and makes his way down the hall for an ice-cold shower.
“Oh.”
He can hear the sound of John’s strokes speeding up as he continues to pleasure himself, the sound of skin on skin accompanied by a series of soft, low grunts.  He momentarily worries that perhaps John will become too aroused - what if he ejaculates prematurely, and then Sherlock will have to
First, he’d ordered Sherlock to drink water.  Making him take care of himself.  Revealing that John, his Dom, wanted him healthy and ready to endure the rigors he was about to subject him to.

“Oh my GOD.”  And with that, John
Three months later, an envelope arrives in their mail slot addressed simply,
“Every once and a while you pause to kiss each other before getting back to work.”  Suddenly his eyes fly open and he gives John a slightly panicked look, hand frozen mid-stroke.  “Sorry, is that-- is that too much?”
for John.
And last, the handcuffs.  They hadn’t used them in a while, and Sherlock finds himself
“Nope.”  He takes another puff.
John brings his fingertips to his lips to wet them before bringing them to Sherlock’s other nipple.  He traces his areola in feather-light circles, and watches in contented fascination as the gooseflesh erupts across the porcelain planes of Sherlock’s pecs.  Sherlock moans and arches into the touch.  His eyes have rolled back in his head, and his cock is leaking a small damp patch into the front of his knickers already, transforming the crimson into deep maroon.
him.  Sherlock, awkward and antisocial, had suggested they meet at the library, and was completely flummoxed when Seb insisted they meet in his dormitory room instead.  He’d been entirely taken aback when, barely five minutes into reviewing Latin verbs, Seb had leaned over, gripped the hair at the base of his neck, and smashed their lips together in a kiss that felt more violent than tender.
Sherlock nearly jumps out of his own skin when John’s alarm goes off.  The noise is so anachronistic to his current state that he sits bolt upright, heart pounding, with a rather undignified yelp.
Probably not.  He’s pretty sure he can still hear gunfire and screaming.  His whereabouts are probably fairly inconsequential to anyone still upright, he reasons.
John’s mouth falls open.  “So… where are we going now?”
A violent shiver works its way down Sherlock’s spine.
He lowers himself dutifully to his knees and assumes the position he makes Sherlock take when they're doing this: Head up, back straight, hands folded in his lap.  He looks up at Sherlock’s face, subconsciously seeking some form of approval despite himself.
John seems satisfied with his ropework.  Sherlock can feel him tie the pattern off in a knot that settles on his coccyx, and he shifts a bit, taking in the sensations.  The corset feels nice, but it’s still quite loose.  He does his best to be patient.

John clears his throat.  “What… what if you moved up a bit, yeah, like that, so your cock--”

“...Sorry?”
He internally chastises himself for forgetting one crucial piece of knowledge he’d deduced the year before: the holidays make John horny.  Extremely horny.  The fact that he and John had had penetrative intercourse for an unprecedented six days in a row should have been a fairly obvious reminder, but Sherlock had been too busy feeling blissfully fucked-out after John had his way with him nightly to consider it; he didn’t dare question his motivations, and he didn’t mention the pattern emerging lest John feel self-conscious about his needs.  After all, Sherlock was always the one complaining they didn’t have penetrative intercourse often enough, so he’d been all too eager to cater to John’s desires.
“You want that?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest, but John cuts him off.
He’s got John
“Love?  I want you to touch yourself now.  Keep your cock in your panties, but I want you to show me how pretty it looks in all this gorgeous silk and lace.  Will you do that for me?”
“Mmmhmm.  Should be a rollicking good time.”  He rolls his eyes, and Aaron shoots him a knowing grin; discussing family drama was one of their favourite shared pastimes.  “What about you?  Any plans?”
John sits back in his chair, appraising the question.  “What’s that got to do with it?”
“But then he came back from the dead and now everything is fine.”  The words as so obviously a blatant lie, they taste bitter on John’s tongue.
we go, darling, easy now…”  John gives his hair another tug and Sherlock moans, pressing his arse deliberately back against what John quickly realises is his own throbbing erection.  He hisses as the thrill of pleasure sweeps through him, and then grinds forward against Sherlock’s plush globes.  “Fuck, sweetheart, you are being
“And this is Simms and Johnson.  I’m sure they have first names, but I don’t think any of us have ever used them.  Simms, Johnson, this is my partner, Sherlock.”
“Um, yeah.  Yeah, I can…” Sherlock extends his hand and John takes it, allowing himself to be helped to his feet.
Sherlock scowls and slumps back in his seat to stare moodily out the window.  “I knew it.”
Aaron shoots them a quizzical glance; they were both acting undeniably odd.  “Um, right then.”  Luckily, he seems to decide it’s not worth the effort to pry, and soon disappears into the crowd.
John casts a sideways glance at Sherlock and gives him a little nod.  The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirks up, and a silent conversation passes between them.

The word rings with the heavy ache of the inevitable.  John’s father had been ill for years.
“And if I told you I was going to knot you, lock your body to mine while I filled you with my seed, would you submit to me?”
“This is how the game will work, sweetheart.  This chalk here is green, see?”  Sherlock nods, the crease between his eyebrows deepening.  “This is the best one.”  John leans over and begins to trace the outline of Sherlock’s left hand onto the hardwood floor, the chalk gently skimming the very edges of his skin.  “Now, if you’re very,
“He’s not here.”
“Really?”  It was more than Sherlock could have hoped for.
John cocks his head, clearly still confused, but then realisation spreads across his face, and he pulls Sherlock down towards him to pepper his face with soft kisses. “Oh, sweetheart, I’m sorry.  I should have realised that would be startling when we were… in the middle of something.  Are you okay?”
Sherlock has worked hard to make John see that making Sherlock cry during sex

Greg paused for a beat.  “Is that… Is that what you and Sherlock do?”
Just as Sherlock’s cries escalate to climax, John empties the last of the wax onto his top vertebrae, completing the line up the length of his spine.
I feel perfectly capable of reading up on the message boards to determine what’s physically safe and how to make sure neither of us is in danger.  But I think the addition of making me the sole gatekeeper of the emotional aspect… it was too much.  We both need to be responsible for making sure we’re in the right headspace before a session.  I need to be confident you’re capable of making good choices, just the same as I am.”
The man beneath him is beyond ruined, glistening with sweat, eyes glassy and unfocused, body limp and unresisting.  John manages to raise himself up to sit on his heels and fully drink in the sight-- including the impressively-sized wet spot blossoming on the front of the precious panties.
All too soon (yet not nearly soon enough), John pulls back and relinquishes his vise-like hold on Sherlock’s abused buds.  He gingerly wets his fingertips and brings them down to lightly pet his inflamed chest as Sherlock shakes and whimpers in his arms.  A sensation of relief washes over him: As delightful as the overstimulation was feeling, he’d just begun to sense he was drawing close to orgasm, and he didn’t want to disappoint John by coming without permission.
“Yes, John.”
“YES! YES! John, YES! That’s it! Oh! Oh! Yes, PLEASE! There! There! Ahhhhhhhh YES!”  Sherlock is wriggling desperately against John’s lap, half thrusting into the tight heat between his thighs and half raising his arse in search of further contact.  John willingly obliges, swinging his palm with measured, precise efficiency, guiding Sherlock towards his climax.

And it’s true, oftentimes when he’s submitting to John he slides into that perfect weightless
To her credit, Dr. Richards barely reacts to John’s outburst.  She simply picks up her glass of water, takes a sip, and returns it to the end table with a deliberate
And when he is done, John tells Sherlock to relax and recover a bit while he makes him something to eat.  Sherlock floats on a lazy river of dopamine until John reappears with a full glass of water and grilled cheese sandwich.  He helps Sherlock sit up and keeps one arm wrapped around him reassuringly as he feeds him the sandwich, one delicious bite at a time.  Sherlock licks at John’s fingers as John nuzzles his neck, telling him how
“Indeed.”  It never ceases to amaze John how Sherlock can still turn on the snark when he hasn’t even yet opened his eyes or begun to recover.
and Sherlock utters a quiet cry as John speeds up his strokes.  John’s firm hand against the sensitive flesh of his cock feels exquisite, and he can feel his passage clenching around the plug as the thrusts up into John’s grip, stimulating him from within.
“OH!”  She tenses and gasps, hands flying to grab the armrest behind her head.  Her passage is so hot and wet and so fucking tight, and John moans obscenely as he sinks into her.
Could he sit up?  Sherlock’s not sure.  He feels so high he has no idea what his transport is capable of in this moment; his brain is offline entirely, and he’s not sure how to communicate any of that, so he gives a strange sort of shrug and whimpers again.
“But it turned out fine.”  He sounds more than a bit defiant.
“Yes, John.  I’m going to be very good for you.”
at being called out on his fantasy.  He’d figured John was at least as drunk as he was, if not more, so the fact that he’d introduced a rather novel dynamic to their standard dirty talk hadn’t really seemed like a big deal at the time.  But John had
John’s fingers make their way to his hair, which he begins to comb through with soft, soothing strokes.  “I know.  But you found a way to let me, didn’t you?  And I think that’s worked out alright so far.”
Unless… unless he just stood up and took what he wanted.  Unless he just strode across this claustrophobic cell of a conference room and straddled John where he sat stunned in his chair, and then ground against him until they both came in their pants, moaning and shaking with ecstasy.  Unless instead, he got on his knees and
as Aaron leans in to speak into Sherlock’s ear.  As he does, the look on Sherlock’s face transforms from surprise to something that could only be described as
to them: their office, their home, and everything in between-- their entire little world.  To separate the two seemed daunting in a vague, inexplicable sense that had left Sherlock feeling unsettled.
“John!”
Dr. Richards narrows her eyes.  “John.  Everything is not fine.  Sherlock died, you lost him, you grieved for him, and that made an impact on you.  Just because he’s come back doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen, it doesn’t mean--”
And with that, John leans down, wraps his arms around Sherlock’s chest, and heaves him into his lap before pistoning mercilessly up into him.  The change in position shifts the depth of penetration, and the next thing John knows, his cock is being ruthlessly squeezed against the vibrator by Sherlock’s constricting passage, somehow even tighter from this angle.
“Did you have a good time, darling?”  Victors fingers comb softly through Sherlock’s curls.
“Good.”  And with that, John reaches into the bowl and places three ice cubes in the divot of Sherlock’s spine.  Sherlock hisses and twitches with the application of each one, but he doesn’t recoil.
twisted...”
They drank water out of a stream and it was so delicious, he felt like he’d never tasted water before.  Then they laid on their backs and looked at the clouds, and when they tired of that, they rolled over and stared at one another’s palms, mapping out the lines like their fortunes were printed there in the peaks and valleys of their flesh.
“Okay, then.”  With that, John makes his way around the table to stand behind Sherlock.  Sherlock feels John’s palm grasp his right buttock, pulling him open.  He holds his breath.
John squeezes his hands, and Sherlock squeezes back.  That’s their unspoken signal that blood flow is unimpaired and Sherlock is ready to proceed.  Then John moves down his body and squeezes his feet.  Sherlock flexes them in affirmation.  He’s glad he doesn’t have to speak anymore.
That is what is real.  Wool in his hands.  Carpet beneath his knees.
It’s in moments like this that John is reminded of the fact that for some godforsaken reason, he’d been too shy to rim Sherlock until shortly after their reconciliation.  Before then, when they were together back before the Fall, the act had seemed too… too filthy, too intimate, too… gay.  As John had internally grappled to come to terms with his own sexuality, he’d wasted
“OH!  Oh, OH!”  Sherlock’s muscles coil and his thrusts turn animalistic, pounding up into John with all his considerable strength.
“Christ,
“Don’t be.  I’m not.”  There’s a beat.  “So… what have you been up to?”
“Mmm.”  Sherlock bows his head, and John watches in rapt fascination as he wraps his right hand underneath himself and presses John’s thighs apart, then proceeds to take himself in hand and jerk himself in rough, rapid motions.
“AUGH!  Oh, JOHN, JOHN, YES!” Sherlock shouts and collapses forward onto his forearms as John pistons roughly into him, his voice shaking with the force of John’s thrusts.  “OH, that’s it!  That’s it!  Oh, God, give me your cock, give it to me, just like that, yes, John, YES!”
He’d deflected, at the time.  Made it seem as if he was only referring to the Work.  That what concerned him about the entire situation was that their newfound fame would blow their cover, compromise their anonymity, make it harder to do the down and dirty legwork often required to cut through the bone and gristle and expose the gory heart of a case.
and Sherlock is echoing him,
“God, yes, John, I just… Tighter.  I want it tighter, please.”
There’s no hesitation.  John nods.
John nearly choked on his beer; apparently Greg’s filters had gone completely offline as well.  Through his sputtering, he managed a garbled, “Um, no.  No, not
<19:38> He actually was, infuriatingly enough.  Offered me a beer.  Smug wanker.
nothing more.
He winces.  He’s sore.
“Put that inside yourself.”
“When I Fell.  It was stupid, I know that.  It’s not your fault.”  To John’s alarm, a trickle of tears runs down Sherlock’s cheek, accentuating the curve of his cheekbone.  Even like this, he’s so goddamn beautiful, John thinks to himself, but he quickly focuses on the gravity of what Sherlock’s just said.
Because he swore to himself he wouldn’t be like that.  Back when he was younger, listening to his father reel and rage as his mother plead for reason, John swore to himself that he would
Then John’s face appears again as he joins Sherlock on the floor of the tub.  He’s drenched and his hair is sticking up at all sorts of odd angles and it takes Sherlock a moment to realise he’s crying, too.
Sherlock shifts thoughtfully.  “No.  It feels nice.”
Sherlock nods dazedly.  “All… alright.  Yes, okay.”
“Y-yes, yes, okay…”  His hand begins to move briskly up and down his shaft as if on its own accord.  Sherlock tilts his head back and spreads his legs a bit, uttering a low gasp.
He’d practiced a few more times since then, and was delighted to discover he was able to attain orgasm every time.  Consistency was important; he didn’t want to offer to reveal his new trick to Sherlock, only to experience an untimely bout of impotence and leave them both feeling awkward and disappointed.
John, I need it, need you now, please,
But oh

He burrows against John’s side and buries his nose in the soft skin at the base of his neck, inhaling deeply.  John’s pheromones are so soothing to him; his whole body is conditioned to associate them with pleasure and happiness and

than having John simply take him doggy-style with Sherlock on all-fours.  In this position, John can kiss his neck and murmur sweet words in his ear.  He can wrap Sherlock in his muscular arms and hold him tight to his chest, immobilising him as he thrusts up into his willing body.  He can play with Sherlock’s nipples, he can grab him by the hips, he can wrap Sherlock’s neck in the crook of his arm and cut off his air supply, the times they’re being rough.  He can fuck up into Sherlock and use him as he pleases, or he can sit back and let Sherlock ride his prick to his heart’s content.  Sherlock’s hands are free to touch his own cock and balls, or sometimes his nipples, or sometimes they reach behind him and tangle in John’s hair as he twists his head so they can kiss, deep and filthy, as they fuck.  It’s perfect.  It’s utterly perfect.
Sherlock swallows hard, sweat pooling in the divot of his throat.  He doesn’t open his eyes.  “No, he’s not moving, he’s just holding himself there inside me,
“Of course, sir.”
John grins.  “You know, I kept getting hard all day at the office thinking about you here, naked and open, waiting for me.  Wanted to sneak away and get myself off, but I thought perhaps that come would be put to much better use inside you.”
Despite himself, John lets out a chuckle.  He gives himself a rather hasty wipe-down with the flannel, then rises on unsteady legs and re-fastens his jeans.  He’s fairly certain he still looks disheveled enough that a discerning onlooker might be able to deduce what they’d just been up to, but hell, he was going to China Palace, not Buckingham.  Chances are they wouldn’t be running into any acquaintances worth making an impression on at this hour, anyhow.
He can see the way that the dueling sensations interplay in Javier’s posture, how he tilts his pelvis to allow Victor to seat himself fully, how he rolls his spine to angle Victor’s cock just the way he likes it.  Sherlock observes it all, wondering if perhaps one day
John chuckles and presses a kiss to the top of his head.  “Yes, I think you’ve had plenty tonight.  Are you ready for me to take the collar off?”
“Sure.  Sure, yeah, of course, we should, um… tonight.”  The words feel clumsy and foolish and somehow strangely awkward, but John seems unphased.  Instead, he just takes it in stride.
would make Sherlock behave, and then John would come inside him again and Sherlock would wriggle and moan and sob at the sensation of being filled.
Sherlock complies, and John lifts his dog tags from where they hang around Sherlock’s neck and places them delicately on his tongue.  “Suck.”  Sherlock closes his mouth with John’s thumb still inside, and for a few brief, erotic seconds, he fellates John’s thumb along side his tags, flicking his tongue in smooth whorls around metal and flesh, delighting in the way the tastes combine on his palate.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock willingly burrows into his arms, and John sighs contentedly.
Indignation rises in a nauseating tide from the base of Sherlock’s gut.  “Because I never thought we
“Not like you?  Impossible.  All you’ve done is seduce an upstanding member of his flock and indoctrinate him into your heathen lifestyle.  Standard stuff, really.”  John nearly finishes buttoning his shirt before realising his alignment is akimbo, and he’s forced to unfasten it and start again.

men, this is what made sex pleasurable.
At 10:26 the night before his birthday, John finally flops onto the couch next to Sherlock and rubs his eyes exhaustedly.
“Yeah.”  John feels dizzy and more than a little breathless staring down at where there’s a distinct trail of semen leaking from Sherlock’s open hole.  “Can I touch you?”
“Good.”  John’s voice is so low, Sherlock shivers at the sensation of breath against his ear.
“Fine.  We won’t have a session on a Danger Night again.  You can just pace about the flat and ruin my sock index and attempt to placate me with tea, like always.”  He starts walking again and brushes past John a bit more brusquely than strictly necessary.  John turns and catches up, trying to let the slight roll off of him.
Sherlock bites his lip.  “That’s… a thought.”
