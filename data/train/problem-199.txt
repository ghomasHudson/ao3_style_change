With the luxury of time to reflect, the mind begins to process the trauma. When you have known nothing but war, being introduced to a life of peace shows you everything you did not have. Hindsight tells you just how bad it was, and just how good life
They interrogate him about social media platforms he didn’t know existed, people he’s never heard of, events in history that haven’t happened. The verdict is bad. He can tell from their faces; these are things that everyone should know, background information you can’t help but pick up.
He keeps telling himself that, even as days threaten to tick into weeks.
mean it.
Sherlock almost cries, because the human mind is so cruel. Memories are one thing, we can make plenty more of those, but we don’t think about the other things they take with them when they go. The chemicals released when we look at those we know.
“I like you.”
Imagine meeting someone who already knows everything about you, all the parts you thought you’d locked away. Details they have no right to, an intimacy you can’t even imagine. That’s a horrifying thought for anyone. But Sherlock doesn’t
John doesn’t want to have to fight Sherlock at every turn. He just wants it to be over.
When he get home, the glass is gone from the floor.
“Now you mention it, the back windows look blacked out,” he nodded.
It takes a second for Sherlock to realise that Johns waiting for him to react. He shifts awkwardly out of his stance, coming to rest in a parodied 'at ease' position, hands restlessly twisting behind his back. John signs first.
“You, uh, need a glass of water?”
But this man was happy to be absent, and in the end, that’s all that mattered.  Because those who are willing to do anything for the ones they love know that they are not what they need, not what they want. And they never will be.
“Of course I’m fucking sure Greg. He never leaves the flat without his phone.”
As John recovered himself and went to look at the body, which now could have passed as normal, had it not been for the deflated look of its abdomen, Sherlock’s eyes flicked around, examining the room further.
In the end it doesn’t matter. Sherlock goes limp as unconsciousness takes him, and John pulls him out of the corner and into space. He tears open the shirt, intent on finding the wound on his chest that is causing all of this blood to seep through his clothes. And then he stops.
“Such as?” he pressed.
He looks up at Lestrade, cradling Sherlock’s fragile body to his own.
Sherlock waves dismissively, keeping his face as neutral as possible. John lets it slide, looking unconvinced. Instead of calling Sherlock out, he just approaches with a caution Sherlock
, fingers tripping over themselves.
“Care to explain what’s quite so funny?”
The steel grey doors parted easily and without sound, allowing the figures to move into the eerily still room. The empty corpse of the recently deceased lay under a simple white sheet, almost elegant in its anonymity. For a second there was peace as the breath of three lungs was shared with the flesh of four bodies, but it fractured into pieces as Sherlock stepped forwards, gloves already being pulled into place as Molly appeared from behind the office door.
“I thought maybe you’d try to, you know – mollycoddle me. But... well you have, to some extent, but you haven’t done what I expcted.”
And it all suddenly made sense.
He cleared his throat, “yeah, yeah that’s – good. Please.”
Even as he spoke, he reached a cupboard that opened to reveal several empty cleaning product bottles. He held one up, shaking it to prove his point. John rolled his eyes, turning to fetch Lestrade as Sherlock swept the containers onto the floor, checking each one. Mostly bleach, no doubt used to destroy any evidence left by the perpetrator.
But it wasn’t the broken voice that he had used before, standing at Sherlock’s grave. No, this John was angry, and it was obvious in his tone and his cut off syllables. He was letting him down. Again.
“Sherlock! Sherlock, stop.” He stilled, wincing with pain and breathing irregularly through his nose. “You need to lie back down – you need to rest.”
Sherlock hesitated before speaking. “I just – I had... uh, nightmares, I suppose.” He shuffled awkwardly on his feet.
(See the end of the chapter for
John raised an eyebrow, “What does that mean? Of course? You’d forget to eat for bloody days at a time but now
The place was cluttered with personal items; a briefcase lounged against the arm of a battered beige sofa, paperweights held down overdue bills and shoes littered the corridor. The walls were painted maya blue, a colour that contrasted with the dirt ground into the carpet on the stairs, giving the place a slightly lopsided feel. Overall the place was unkempt and clearly hadn’t been cleaned thoroughly in many years. If anything, it smelt as though the owner of this particular rat haven was well on the way to drinking himself to fatality, even before there had been foul play.
Sherlock visits John's sister, but she is drunk and hardly coherent. Once he leaves, she will likely not even remember their conversation, or whether he had been there at all. Still, it's easy to deduce John has not visited her in some time, even without decoding her slurred replies.
The woman disappeared from the window and there was a peculiar sound as she went toward the back of the building, out of John’s sight.
John walked down the dirt road to his home.
Chala was older than Harry but younger than John’s own father. Now, she stood on the small stoop in front of her house, holding her newborn wrapped loosely in a colorful strip of fabric. John had only seen the baby once before, on her name day, where there had been more desserts on the table than John had ever seen outside of the market.
“She’s—” Mycroft started, but Sherlock cut him off with a breathless word, expelled from him almost involuntarily.
“And now you think you can just come back,” Harry continued, though John had turned and most of his focus was toward deciphering the figure of his father from the shadows. “Now that everything is better and settled and I’ve done all the work? No, John! I won’t stand for it. If that’s how…  if that’s how you expect it to be, you may as well go back! Just run away again!”
John stared and wanted like he had never wanted anything in his entire life. If only John could—if he could—
Muhammad had been vocally disappointed about having a daughter instead of a son, Harry had been even more vocal in addressing this, and John’s father had been the mediator as the grown man stood up to argue with a preteen girl. Harry got into all sorts of scuffles, verbal and physical, and the only reason John remembered this particular one is because he had been allowed to eat as much of the sweets on the table as he had wanted.
Also, there is musical inspiration for the title. This is the song that I was playing on repeat as I imagined Sherlock playing his violin:
Reader's Notes: Music for intro and outro is the aforementioned song by P!ATD (I love them)
Sherlock’s lips lifted at the corners, but he did not laugh. Hadsana was chuckling, as well. He was not sure if they also knew about what had happened during the Hearing of the Public Grievances, but he certainly was not going to give them more reason to laugh at him.
“You didn’t kill yourself.” John’s voice is soft and sad, hand stroking Sherlock’s shoulder blades in an attempt to sooth him.
But it also means that he’s not going to wake up.
It only gets worse. John’s legs curl up into a ball, crying louder.
The screaming descends into tears, and John is sobbing into his chest. Sherlock immediately cups the back of his head, face in his hair, rocking them gently.
“What about the scars?”
John goes white as a sheet. Was that the right answer? Dumping his work bag unceremoniously, and shucking his coat, John sinks into His Chair. They stare at each other, and for the first time since the blog argument, John dares to look hopeful. Oh and Christ, how Sherlock doesn’t want to let him down.
He trashes the laptop, grabs it by the screen and smashes it into the coffee table until it snaps in two.
That sort of trauma…has he the strength to live through it again? He wonders about the sort of life he’s led that makes him the recipient of so much love, and such vicious hatred. What exactly is he inheriting from this sad, battered man?
How much can the world change in seven years? The possibilities are endless.
Their stories are gone, but the wounds left behind remain, inside and out. There are the emotions he can’t explain, and then there are the scars. The first time, just the barest glimpse was so frightening that he hurled himself across the room in shock, and lay panting on the bathroom floor. The nurses thought he was having a fit.
“You sounded just like him.”
“Mine is in the bedroom. Yours was closer.”
It’s all building up in his head, the confusion. He’d describe it as a nightmare, but he already has quite enough of those. There is just so much

Sherlock grits his teeth.
He’s competing with history.

is the one who has travelled back in time; back to when he was first invalidated home, before he met Sherlock. Because really, without Sherlock, John’s life isn’t anything much at all.
. He’s never been in better shape in his life. It’s barely morning, he’s wearing dress shoes, and is visibly struggling to stay on his feet. The cab driver is understandably suspicious.
John has answers to stupid things, like how to fix the hot water when it goes iffy (there’s a very specific order you have to jiggle the taps), or why his damn phone won’t do what he wants. People keep saying words on cases, at crime scenes; concepts Sherlock doesn’t understand, questions he doesn’t know how to answer. He’ll freeze, treading water on dry land; hopelessly out of his depth.
The imposter stares at him. "Well, no?"
John times it perfectly, lunging forward just as Sherlock begins to fall, catching him under the armpits, each on different sides of the hand rail. Crushing Sherlock’s ribs, he hurls him back over the railing.
John is angry when he gets in; Sherlock is just impressed he made it up the stairs.
where you are. Don’t move. It’s my note.”
He is somewhat reassured to find that he is still in possession of both his faculties and his limbs, but something is off about this. Even his transport feels different, very unlike himself, he just cannot place how. It’s maddening.
John sighs, but he thinks very carefully before he says anything.

Ah. So it wasn’t just in his head then, he’s always had an ear for accents.

“I never got that far. How did I know that?”
He doesn’t want to go back to being nobody. To waiting around doing nothing, fingers twitching at the sound of sirens. Useless. He used to keep a loaded gun by his bedside, just in case; and there’s no reason for a civilian to be doing that. No good ones anyway.
Phones are the size of houses, half of London has been knocked down and rebuilt, and America has gone properly insane. But the biggest and most alarming change is that
John gets up from his chair, snatches the laptop out of his hands without warning, slams the lid shut, marching back across the room. “Use your bloody own if you want, I know you know which one it is.”
Yet he is helpless but to rely on others to provide details of everything, to fill him in on his
It’s the type of thing that once you’ve noticed the discrepancy, it becomes impossible to ignore; like discovering a hidden panic room after measuring the walls. You can see something is there, but lack the means to access it.
People never knew that; how they laughed together, the delighted mischief in Sherlock’s grin.
He’s tried only using the top sheet, shivering until he can get to sleep. But it’s nothing to do with how warm he is. Sleeping naked has the same result, only exacerbating the cold. Exhausted, and desperate, he gropes for a towel; one laid out underneath, and one covering his torso; too tired to change the sheets. John gets annoyed when he can’t find a towel.
He slaps himself six times in front of the mirror until his eyes water and his skin smarts; and still sees thirty six year old Sherlock Holmes staring back at him, just with a slightly reddened cheek.
there’s a reason for it, but the answers evade him.
And who is this man they thought they knew, the man they claim he was? Sherlock doesn’t know the first thing about him. And what if he doesn’t want to be that man anymore? Would he even
An ordinary looking, boring locum doctor; just another ex-soldier who just happened to get himself shot in the war. What makes him so damn special? Why is he always there? What was John Watson to him? Colleague, friend…lover? There’s no evidence to suggest the latter, there are no rings (thank god), they sleep in different beds, and he’s not even what Sherlock usually likes.
"Leave. Now."
He can hear it chanting over and over in his head; everyone, everyone-
Now Sherlock’s casual sarcasm catches John off guard, because he’d almost forgotten what it used to be like. It’s as much a comfort as it is a painful reminder.
Why would he do that?! It’s so deeply personal, so exposing. Sherlock does not trust him, he thinks he might even hate him, and wants to run. But he can’t, not yet. Because of the puzzle.
John wants to giggle at crime scenes. He wants to reminisce about a case, or make a dig at Anderson. But every time he goes to do it; he just feels empty. Because Sherlock won’t understand the joke.
When asked, Sherlock shrugs. John looks at him for a long time and stops searching. The next day, the book is back, with the handwritten message forged to perfection. The exact same condition of use, coffee stain placed perfectly. And yet, he still senses John knows it’s not the original.
And he hasn’t the slightest idea what to do to stop him. Usually when Sherlock brings someone to tears, it’s either deliberate or irrelevant. Sometimes he’ll do it just because they’re speaking. Their pain is either informative or revenge. This time, he never saw it coming. Sherlock didn’t mean to make John cry, and he never expected he’d actually
John says nothing, frozen in shock, perhaps because he is realising now that he too does not know.

on the most fundamental level.
“You read the blog.”
Because Sherlock has retrograde amnesia.
The word rolls off his tongue automatically; “Snipers.”
John has no idea what’s going on, he’s jumped to his feet after him, and looks extremely disturbed.
He’s wearing Sherlock Holmes, and it’s every bit as unfamiliar to him as a 300 quid suit.
“He took my hand and then blew his own brains out with the other. He killed himself. And then so did

She finally gets the words out, but she talks too fast. The lady tells her to take a deep breath and slow down and start again. So Rosie tries to calm down. Her chest is still tight with worry. The lady is nice to her. She asks her lots of questions, but Rosie is afraid because she can't answer them right. She doesn't know what's wrong with Beebee, and she didn't see him fall, and there's no one home right now. But the lady promises that people will be over to help her and her beebee.
They are alone for the first time in a week. Dr. Molly had to leave early tonight. The other doctors needed her. Nana is gone today and tomorrow, and the day after that. Rosie didn't want her to go. Beebee didn't even say goodbye.
. How had he not seen it? All the signs were there, and yet he had not prepared, too occupied with preventing a catastrophe at her wedding.
Rosie grinds her teeth. She kicks the table leg. He won't play pretend with her. It's not hurting them! It's only make believe, not real. So it's okay. It makes everything normal.
"Yes. Rosie, come on, let go."
Grandma strokes her hair. "Say hello, Rosie."
A wave of longing swells in him, the months she has been absent from his arms. His legs twitch, wanting to carry him to her. He almost reaches out for her, to hold her again and feel her heartbeat against his like how he cradled her as a baby.
Sherlock tips back and drops into his chair. Mycroft sniffs. He hates when he does that. Wrinkles the trousers.
He holds his hand out. Rosie takes his hand and he shakes hers.
His name was Terrance Noland. He had worked a low income job and police found evidence of other robberies in his flat. But on that specific day, a little after five o'clock, he had robbed a bank and was being chased by three police cars. He jumped a curb and hit three people before crashing into a light pole. Without a seat belt, he was ejected from the windshield and killed instantly in oncoming traffic. Of the three people he hit, only one survived. After multiple surgeries, her broken leg would be usable, but her left eye could not be salvaged.
"Yes," he says.
"Did you take cold medicine?" That always helped when Daddy gave it to her.
"We'll follow the hearse from here. Police escort."
His head falls back after he takes another gulp from the bottle and his eyes close. His violin drops to the floor. Rosie flinches. Beebee has told her how much he loves that violin, and how she has to be careful with it if she ever holds it. To see him toss it around like an old coat...
Nana will be home tomorrow. It will be okay.
Light from the chair room seeps into the hallway, lighting the way. She pauses on the other side, the screeching is making her head hurt, and she can smell something sour from the chair room, like it has seeped into the walls.
She grins and grabs his arm and pulls as hard as she can and he grunts and puffs, but Rosie knows she is strong and pulls his hand out. His hand is clenched tight around the prize but Rosie pries his fingers open and there it is!
"One phone call you
It's still not good. Beebee is stiff and his shoulder digs into her cheek. All hard edges like a countertop. She squeezes her arms around his neck to show that she still loves him. She wishes he would hug her like Daddy.
He sounds sick. Rosie's stomach turns. "It's me," she says.
Sherlock had been expecting a client at five o'clock, so John took Rosie for new trainers. Her old light up Rainbow Dashers had been ruined by a daring trip through a mud puddle at the park. And without the lights, they were just regular old trainers. And they couldn't have that, now could they?

It’s all just word associations, just fragments, but it’s proof that the memories are still in there. They’re smiling now, because after weeks, they’re finally getting somewhere. They run through a few, and Sherlock comes up with an answer to each, they don’t make any sense to Sherlock really, but John looks so happy it’s infectious.
Thankfully, Sherlock shows no symptoms of sliding down that particular slope. It’s also encouraging to see that at least some things are coming back to him, even if only delivered by his subconscious.
He’s on the floor scrambling back.

Sherlock has never in his life been classified as part of the majority, and as time goes on, the chances for spontaneous recall begin to diminish. If no memories have surfaced after two weeks, that can indicate a recovery time of months or even years. After that, a full recovery may never be possible. His age, and history of substance abuse are added variables.
“I’m sorry?”
Sherlock has forgotten him, and John isn’t really coping very well with that. Every morning he wakes up and just wants to go back to sleep, to stay that way until it’s over. Because it has to end sometime; he completely rejects the possibility that this isn’t going to go away. It
“I like it.” That should shut him up, flattery usually does.
Seems John Watson is a man of his word, and despite everything; Sherlock laughs.
Seeing his brother walk through that door…he nearly wept with relief. He hasn’t gone insane. Whoever would have thought Mycroft could be a comfort?

John didn’t know that Sherlock had nightmares. He’d never shown signs of it before. He’d try to write it off as part of the amnesia, but something feels wrong about that. Just like something has felt wrong about Sherlock ever since he came back. He couldn’t place it before, but this feels exactly the same, his intuition screaming there’s a connection.
But it’s been
John walks into a room, and no matter what the angle or intentions he brings, Sherlock is already bracing for a fist fight. He pretends not to see it, but he knows Sherlock doesn’t want this. John catches him staring, looking at him with something close to resentment in his eyes. Sherlock is hostile, and John is unwelcome. But Christ, he can’t let him go.
Why would he commit suicide if he
Sherlock stares up at the stars, his whole body shaking with John’s grief.
Without his memory, Sherlock has no way of confirming what people are telling him. Everything is hearsay. It must be bizarre to be led into a room and be told it’s your home, or introduced to people who are supposedly your oldest friends; a space you do not recognise, filled with people you have never laid eyes on before.

The impact should have killed him instantly, shattering his skull, severing his spinal cord, causing massive internal trauma. His lungs should have collapsed as his chest cavity caved in.

He surprises himself; because until John got upset, he’d had every intention of ignoring him. Before he wouldn’t have even bothered to lie. But really, what would be the point? John is right, there’s nothing to be learnt from a potentially conflicting account.
It had taken years, but he’d learnt to control it, to keep his heart in check. He became logical, disciplined; pushing down all that sentiment and holding it there by brute force.

How long until he grows tired of playing nice for everyone else’s sake? Until he stops conforming to what he believes is expected of him? John suspects he’s biding his time until he can escape.

him. John could stand right here in the living room, palms sweating, sick to his stomach as he watches Sherlock striding out the door like he couldn’t give a toss. And he probably wouldn’t.
It’s cruel to expect anything of Sherlock right now, and it’s not fair to blame him for forgetting. But even though he knows better, John feels it too. A tiny part of him can’t help but think that maybe it’s because he just wasn’t important enough to remember.
Living with John in the same space everyday gives his life some semblance of a routine. There is always a point of contact if he needs it, an interpreter to make sense of the world. That stability is something he has come to rely on so much more than he’d expected; to the point where he honestly wouldn’t know what to do if he wasn’t around. He trusts without meaning to.
It’s full censorship. No experiments, no tantrums, nothing out of the ordinary whatsoever. He says as little as possible, carefully maintaining a formal distance between them at all times.
. What the hell is he supposed to do with this?
Sherlock hasn’t allowed himself to relax since the moment he returned from the hospital. John can tell that he’s acting every second, judging how to react, altering his behaviour and emotions accordingly.
“Imperial father,” Sherlock intoned, and then continued at a lower volume, “why do I have to be here? Isn’t this mother’s duty?”
When he had heard that Mycroft would be leaving the palace to survey the outer plains, he had jumped at the chance to accompany him. The palace staff had been becoming even more overbearing than usual, always watching him.
Was that an elephant? John tried to maneuver his head from under his father’s heavy arm. Had that been—yes!
She is alive. Here. In front of him.
She swallows. "I... I had a bad dream," she says, gripping the door tight.
Lestrade crosses his arms and shrugs. "Not her godfather."
Rosie hides her face in Grandma's leg. Yes. She remembers Mr. Mycroft.
Ah. They are a couple now.
She picks at some skin around her nail. "In the ambliance."
But even though John is gone, the smallest parts of him are coded into Rosamund Watson. Echoes of him left in the world, like ripples finally reaching the shore of a pond. The mug he left on the table in the living room. The last bill he opened. The last text message.
"Well..." Sherlock refuses to acknowledge the heat in his face as embarrassment. "We are brothers after all."
His face is pale, and he's breathing like he just ran a million kilometers.

Rosie gathers her colorings and tucks them haphazardly under her arm, with the markers gripped tight in her hand.
A snowflake catches in Sherlock's eyelashes. He reaches up to catch more.
Her breath hitched. "I thought... Daddy..." She broke off with a wail. Nana's face came into focus again.
Raymond Macintyre, in the standard academy uniform, sneers down at him, his fist bloody. Sherlock touches his swollen nose, warm from blood.
"We owe nothing to the dead, Mother."
"With money?"
He takes a deep breath, recalling Song's sessions like a tape recorder on fast forward.
Rosie isn't brave enough yet. Instead she turns the mirror sideways so it faces the wall. The sun is shining through the window by the time she falls asleep. Even then, she dreams of her reflection chasing her through a hospital. No matter how many doors she tries, she cannot find the way out.
It's like coming home after seven years away. He closes his eyes and slips under.
She gets out a piece of construction paper and her crayons. She colors a picture of her daddy, with his silver hair on top. Then she gets another paper and draws her Beebee, with his curly black hair.
A hand touched her shoulder, so gently. "Honey? Are you alright? Is this your granny?"
He blushes pink like a rose, and his eyes shift like marbles rolling. "I'd, er, well... We'll see."
"Nana talks about rent a lot."
Her daddy wouldn't say that. He knew who Nana was! Had he been gone so long that he had forgotten?
One day he just laid on the couch with his back turned to the room for the entire day. Nana laid a blanket over him and told Rosie to leave him be. "Rainy days" Nana calls them.
Sherlock frowns. He can see his reflection behind the cloudy eyes. He opens his mouth, but cannot find the words. John raises his eyebrow and nods to his hands. Sherlock blinks and is startled to see the notecards.
John carried the food back to the stand. Though there was a veritable mountain of food, the three of them demolished it speedily. There were no leftovers and, when they had finished, Harry embarrassed them all by slowly sucking her fingers. John thought it was childish and immature, but then he noticed the behavior had drawn the eye of a fair few people in the market.
Next chapter, adults! (THANK. GOD.)
The net slowly crested the rim of the ship’s deck. All John could see was a riot of colors: turquoise as vibrant as beads he had seen in the market, violet as royal and rich as what he imagined the emperor’s robes would be, silver bright enough to blind, and little dots of vivid yellow peeking through the weave of the net like sunlight through lace.
John stepped away from the door. He swung the door shut and latched it, making haste to reach his father, who was waiting for him near their fence. Once united, they began the short trek toward the icehouse to retrieve the fish they intended to sell at market that day.
“What. Is. It.”
At that, the entire family burst into giggles and Harry began an animated explanation, between chuckles, of how she had been likened to a fruit that morning as well. This led to a retelling of their entire morning—paraphrased, thankfully—though John could not help bouncing on his father’s lap and chattering anxiously when they told Wat about the baz.
Sherlock closed his eyes and grimaced in annoyance. He sighed heavily. Now, this. He assumed it would be dull, most people were dull, and most of the things they said and did were dull, dull,
“Let the side flap down, John,” Harry said in a put-upon voice, as if John had not just asked that exact question.
Uncharacteristically, Mycroft had raised his voice in anger, and it discomfited Sherlock, who began actively searching for a way to escape the conversation. The easiest way, which had worked statistically better in past experiences, was to annoy Mycroft until he lapsed into a sulky silence. Sherlock had the feeling that method would not work in his current situation.
Mycroft scoffed, loud enough to draw attention from the lady. He gave a small cough and motioned to his assistant for a handkerchief, playing off his lapse in control. “She has recently given birth. The paleness of her skin—look there—her body shows multiple symptoms from atypical stress. She had to use magic in order to carry to term and now she is paying for it.”
Mycroft was able to gather his wits and recover more quickly than Sherlock, whose mouth was still gaping a bit in surprise. He tilted his head at the lady the tiniest amount necessary in order to apologize and said, “My sincerest apologies, Lady Tremaine. Congratulations on your new child.”
“What is it, papa?” Harry asked.
Non-English words/reference in this chapter:
John figured there was no point in putting it off. First, he cleared the nightstand so that he could rest his candle there. There had been a lamp in John’s room, but it was not where it had used to be. John was not sure if that meant it had been moved into the mountain of items on the other side of the room or if it had been repurposed somewhere else in the house.
After prolonged exposure to them, Sherlock has come to have certain... requirements.
The next citizen to approach the dais identified himself as a doctor. The doctor’s apprentice approached with him, but kept her hands clasped nervously in front of her and her eyes on the flagstones beneath her feet. The doctor had huge eyes and bowed gratuitously to them all, and he reminded Sherlock of a one of the goshawks that liked to build their nests in the palace maze.
“It sounds to me like you were both very brave,” Wat acceded, warm gaze lingering on both of his children.
"Mmrnph," Sherlock replies concisely, and only John's delighted chuckle stops Sherlock inner grief and remonstration over his own inability to form a cohesive response.
Sherlock thinks he shook his head before he continued on his way out of the door, but he's not sure. He doesn't have time to sit and talk, though, can't Mrs. Hudson understand that? He must find John.
“Why do you think he’s even here?” John asked.
John, your birth was a beautiful thing that came out of a sequence of ugliness. I was devastated to lose Emma, you know I was, I still am, and I won’t lie to you and tell you that I’m not. But I love my family more than anything, John, you know that. And though I wouldn’t trade either one of you for the other, I can’t regret you being born. You’re my son.”
With a nod, Lestrade walked towards a whitewashed house, no different from its neighbours’ in its outward appearance. Officers were clustered outside, some talking amongst themselves, others standing alone. They all paused as Sherlock passed them, their eyes following the movement of his coat as he strode into the building. Once inside the doorframe, Sherlock let his eyes roam, flicking from surface to surface, covering each wall and the floor, taking it all in, seeing patterns as he ascended the stairs.
The door sends vibrations through the floor as it closes, so faint that Sherlock doubts John even notices them as he reenters the room. He only knows that they will be present because of the hours he's spent on their sofa, steeped in his environment.
It was this that scared him the most. He had been hurt many a time; it became meaningless, a hurdle to be overcome. But this? Being touched, where he had not been touched before, being stroked by a man he’d never met? This was psychological torture, and it was working. He would have done anything, anything at all to stop this. But his hands were tied, metaphorically and physically, and he was unable to do anything but sit and take it, too weak to even lift his head. It could have been days, or hours. If he knew what they wanted, he would have given it. No amount of information was worth this.
John went cold.
Mycroft inclines his head in understanding, remaining stood resolutely by his brother bedside. They continued to watch Sherlock’s passive figure, both lost in their own thoughts. John traced the veins visible beneath the translucent skin of his hand, desperately trying to distract himself from the very real possibility that his friend, his
Neither brother said anything for several heartbeats. Sherlock remained focused on his guest’s face, watching the internal debate, while the elder of the two let his eyes slide to the fireplace, retreating inside his own mind for a short while.
Standing slowly, Sherlock gripped the edge of the sink, meeting his refection. He lifted his chin, pulled up the façade, and gently rinsed the stained metal under the cold tap. A piece of tissue blotted the worst of the evidence and was left, discarded in the top of the litter bin.
He was set down again on a much softer surface, sinking in slightly. Opening his eyes, he saw paramedics fussing over him, wrapping a blanket around him, and wiping antiseptic wipes over his body. It felt like burning all over again, and Sherlock pushed them away, struggling to clamber off the stretcher-bed.
“What do you mean she wasn’t going to tell me?” He cut him off angrily, “I’m not a child Mycroft. I deserve to know this sort of thing.” Sherlock could feel the anger expanding inside himself; the primitive urge to lash out, hurt whatever was closest.
“You done here then, Sherlock?” Lestrade inquired.
Sherlock paused halfway up the staircase, gripping the banister and bowing his head, clearly in pain. He swayed alarmingly on his feet, prompting John to reach out, steadying him with a hand on his lower back.
A clatter behind him made him abandon his pursuit of the girl’s clothes drawers (which was starting to feel a bit predatory anyway), and look behind him. Sherlock was stood in the middle of a pile of books, which he seemed to have pulled down on top of himself. He looked comical; long coat and elegantly tailored suit, holding a single book, whilst a pile of novels covered his feet and ankles. He glanced at John’s barely suppressed smirk with disdain and kicked away the paperbacks.
Settling down in his chair, he turned on the television for background noise, then picked up the paper, folded it open and began to read. A little under two hours later he had finished, and the tea had been reduced to dregs. Unsure of what to do next, John returned to the kitchen to wash out mug he had used, before debating a shower. He was always reluctant to shower before Sherlock woke, as the vibrations of the plumbing in the wall behind the headboard of Sherlock’s bed often caused him to stir preemptively, leaving him in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
Sherlock closed his eyes, feeling as if everything he loved was slowly slipping from within his grasp. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see his tea being offered to him. He took it wordlessly, choosing to ignore the presence in his flat as he stood to stand in the window.
John met his eyes for a second, and for a brief moment, Sherlock was sure he was about to say something.
before he opens it what he will find.
The sound of the door closing, followed by an aborted retch caused Sherlock to turn. John stood at the foot of the bed, nose wrinkled in distaste. Sherlock felt his lips twitch involuntarily into a smile that was easily reciprocated by the shorter man.
to John.
John turned to look at his father, who he saw was looking ahead down the road. Sensing John’s gaze, Wat turned to look down at John, and gave him a rather vacant smile.

” Harry waggled her eyebrows conspiratorially.
“And your father is your father. Mycroft does not know, and you can not tell him. You can not tell anyone.” His mother said as she rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly.
Some days, John wondered what their home would be like without her always pushing them around, their father specifically, who sometimes got fairly melancholy when left on his own. Sometimes, when he thought no one was looking, Wat slumped and wilted like vegetables left too long in the sun, as if he was exhausted simply by the weight of living. So, John worried for his father and blessed Harry’s nagging, some days. Other days… honestly, he just wished someone would come and get her.
One of her keepsakes was kept on a shelf near the door, a small brass figurine that looked like a rabbit, her namesake. A wooden box sat next to it, an heirloom passed down through Wat’s side of the family. His father and Harry touched it when they came into the house each day, and his father always made a point of holding John’s hand while he did so. They stopped at the nearby ice house, where John watched avidly as his father paid to store the fish there. It had only taken moments before they resumed their journey home.
John held firm to this hope as he entered the doctor’s residence and approached Mik, the only person in the receiving room. The news he received was mixed, but John could only sigh in relief when Mik told him that Vihaan thought Harry’s deafness was temporary. He told John that Vihaan was keeping her overnight for observation, but that Harry would likely be fine come morning, with such an aura of awe and hero worship about him that John was simultaneously annoyed and reassured.
Sherlock missed a step. There was no ground under his feet where there should be. The hedge walls were too far away to realistically reach for and, even if there had been something close enough for Sherlock to grab, his momentum would have carried him into the pit regardless.
“Yeah, papa?” John peered at the ropes tied to the side of the boat, blue eyes bright with curiosity.
"John's missing," Sherlock says.
Wat stopped the cart in front of their stand and John and his sister moved as one to begin unloading the fish. They packed ice into the into the trestles on the table and then pressed the fish in over it, careful to arrange their wares by type and size. Wat had a leather belt around his waist, a gift from the thankful tanner, that held most of the utensils he needed to clean and cut the fish to the customers’ orders.
