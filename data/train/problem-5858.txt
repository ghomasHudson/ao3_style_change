hadn’t made it glaringly obvious that Tony didn’t want anything to do with him, then running into Tony and his beautiful date looking pretty cozy in the elevator less than an hour ago definitely did.  Steve had stammered an apology and opted for the stairs, ignoring Tony’s voice calling his name.
“I’m going to say the wrong thing again,” Tony pressed. “The last thing I want to do is drive you away, but I know it’s bound to happen.”
Suddenly, it all makes sense.  All of the strange questions Steve had asked him over the past few months, all of the secret meetings and private phone calls: all of it was in preparation for this day.
Tony gets up from the couch and smooths the wrinkles out of his suit jacket, very aware of Sarah’s intense gaze.  “I’m sorry if that was inappropriate or—”
“But you’re the one who wants to date me,” Steve reminds him, “I just want to know why.”
The thing is, the entire thing is absolutely ridiculous. They’re making Steve get into unnatural poses and forcing him to make these absurd facial expressions, and Tony would normally be very amused by the situation, but he’s too busy being super turned on by the image of Steve smoldering at a camera in a suit that costs more than his college tuition.
years—”
“Well, you weren’t in your lab…”
Tony pulls away and puts some distance between them.
“He made up some excuse after a while and left,” Steve explained.  He had actually thought they were getting along pretty well, so it was disappointing when Alex never called again as he had promised.  “It just… got really awkward? I don’t know, but I couldn’t blame him.” “Unbelievable,” Tony muttered.
“Which one did they leak?” Steve asked again.
Tony burrows deeper into Steve’s embrace. “You’re such a romantic.”
“Yeah, well I’d rather you step on my feet for the rest of my life than dance with anyone else.”  The words leave Tony’s mouth before he can even stop them, and when Steve pauses and takes a step back, he thinks he’s said the wrong thing.
“Howard didn’t like it.  He said it was for children.”
He looks over at Steve, who’s sitting just a few feet away from him, his face illuminated by the rays of the early morning sun.
Sheepishly, Steve swallows the mouthful of the newly-refilled glass he’s already gulped down half of.   He gingerly wipes at the wet ring around his lips. “No, no.   I’m fine.”
Neither of them said anything for the duration of the ride to their floor, or as they walked into Steve’s room and got into bed.
“So what else do you know about me?”
“I seriously have no idea what you guys are talking about.”
“C’mon, Steve.  Between the two of us,
~ ~ ~
Tony’s fingers froze over the page.
“Sorry,” Steve says monotonously. “Are you okay?”
Tony’s 15 when Steve’s first sex tape leaks on the internet, and he only knows this because he remembers noticing a tabloid with the unoriginal headline, “Rogers Sex Tape Scandal!” while trying to buy beer with a fake ID.  The second thing he notices is how
isn’t up for a little romp in the sack?”
“What the hell are you talking about, Stark?” Natasha asks.
But then he hears Tony zooming over his head before touching down next to him on the pavement.  Tony takes off his helmet, and when their eyes meet, Steve’s breath catches: he can’t believe it.  He did it.
Steve rubs his eyes and then peers around at them, smiling drowsily. “Morning, everybody.”
Steve shrugs. “It’s fine.  You sounded like you needed help, so… I came.”
Steve beams, entirely too pleased with himself. “Yeah?”
Pepper turned her attention back to Tony.
Steve’s eyes widened when he noticed Bulldozer regain consciousness. “Tony, look out!” he yelled before pushing the man out of the way.  He took the brunt of the villain’s headbutt, sending him directly into the closest building.
“A date?” Tony repeated dumbly. “A
“I wouldn’t wish those experiences upon anyone,” Steve added, quieter than before. “I couldn’t live with myself if you had gotten hurt because of me.”
Having run out of options, Tony sidled up to Bruce.  He knew Bruce wasn’t fond of these types of outings, but Tony really didn’t want to drive out to the Hamptons by himself to look at
Tony trudged into the kitchen where he found most of the team in various states of alertness.
“I love you.”  Tony realizes it’s probably bad form to say right before fighting an army of murder bots, but it’s too late to take it back now.
“Still… doing whatever you two did and being able to live to tell the tale?  That’s impressive.”
Steve pulls back and keeps Tony at arms’ length.  “You can’t be serious,” he says, looking at him incredulously. “Tony, you gave them a home! You gave
Steve smiles and kisses him again. “I’ll miss you, too,” he says fondly.
“Still,” Tony says, eyes flickering to the ring hanging around Steve’s neck, “it couldn’t have been easy.”  Steve notices him clench his left hand, no doubt trying to feel the same gold band on his finger.  “Don’t even try lying to me.”
“Oh.  Um… thanks, I guess.”
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but their waitress chose that moment to return to their table.
“But seriously, Steve,” Tony continued. “You don’t have to sugarcoat it.  I had
“As much as your classic rock?” Steve teases.
“Excuse me?” Tony squawked.
He marched back down the hall to
By the time Steve emerged from the bathroom, dressed only in a pair of threadbare pajama pants, Tony had already compiled a list of potential date locations in the city.
“Those kids looked like they were having fun,” Steve remarked, handing one of the toy boats to
Thor smiled in turn, but didn’t take a genius to notice the tightness in his features. “I’m glad to hear it.”  He turned to Amora and bowed his head. “I know you and I do not always see eye to eye, but I am most grateful for your services today.”
“I’m not the one who got stabbed,” Tony said with a scowl on his face.
“Oh, my!" Tony exclaims, placing his hand on Steve's chest. "You are positively insatiable, Captain Rogers.”
“You’re checking in on us.”
Tony ducks his head. “I’m… not good at this, Rogers.”
"Can we… I mean, I’d like to… Before when we…” Tony trails off.
Steve kisses his temple. “Yours is closer.”

“What am I supposed to do, then?”

"I’m really sorry if I made things um, awkward.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “If we could just forget all of this and–and just go back to our regular work rout–Why are you laughing?"
Steve blinked, his expression unreadable. “What?”
Tony paused. “Excuse me?”
Tony’s breath catches at the admission. “What if I’m not good enough for him?” he whispers.  He startles when Peggy gently places a hand on his shoulder.
“I’m fine,” Tony says quickly. “I uh… I couldn’t sleep.”  He fidgets with the hem of his t-shirt. “I actually don’t know why I’m here, but I think this actually happens a lot and… Fuck, I’m sorry I woke you up.  I’m just gonna… go now…”
“That is totally not the—wait,
All Tony is aware of is that Steve is warm.  He’s warm and he’s
fault that he was off in the Hamptons in some swanky hotel with Tony with no immediate means of escape.
“W-what?” Tony sputtered. “How did you know that?”
Tony shrugs. “Maybe I want to be cliche for once.”
Steve nodded. “Of course.  We should get lunch the next time you’re in town.”  And wasn’t that just
"OKAY.  EVERYBODY MOVE THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY!”
“I am
“Yeah,” Steve said fondly. “And I love you.”
It doesn’t take long for Steve to notice a pattern.
“It doesn’t,” Bruce said, trying hard not to look too bored as he stirred his drink.
They’re arguing about what languages are the most difficult to learn a few minutes later when Steve realizes that not only does he feel warm, he’s also loose and happy.  He blinks at the almost empty stein in his hand and then glances up at Thor, a wondering sort of surprise blooming in his chest.
"You could take it as a sign of trust.”
The sheets were bunched at Tony’s waist, and Steve watched the steady rise and fall of his chest as he breathed, still deep in sleep.  Tony’s head burrowed further into the pillows, letting Steve catch a glimpse at the purplish bruise he left on Tony’s neck.  Steve probably should’ve felt bad— the mark was going to be hell to cover up, especially for business functions—but he loved seeing his mark on Tony’s neck as if Tony was…
In truth, Steve was mad at himself.  All his life, he had been too scrawny, too short, too
,” she corrects. “Ever since he went off to school, you are all he talks about.”
Steve was glad to hear no accusatory tone in his voice.  In fact, he sounded amused.
“You’re not my Steve,” Tony says matter-of-factly.
“No,” Tony said, but even he could tell that he didn’t really mean it.
Steve nods.
“Keep going,” Tony pleaded.  He wanted Steve to come and to know that he had been the reason for Steve’s pleasure. “Still feels good.”
And when Tony gets back from work, Steve pushes him up against the wall of their bedroom and tells him about this thing he read about on the internet, and Tony never thinks twice about going along with it.
He’s eating and sleeping, working semi-normal hours, and—miraculously—still has time for Avenging.
“Wha—Do you really—You go on dates all the time!  How the hell could you not know—”
“Tony,” Steve said lowly, almost a warning. He felt a shiver run down his spine from the expression on his lover’s face—if they could still be called that.  He brushed his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip to wipe away the drops of water. “Come on. Get up. You’re getting dirty.”
“Um…”
Tony felt Steve’s arm slide around his waist and tug him closer, and he willingly fell back into the embrace.
?!” Steve counters.
“Who?”
“So are you gonna ask Rogers out or what?”
Tony was scribbling notes on the schematics for his newest armor when Steve entered the room and dropped down on the couch next to him.
. “Steve.  What is this?”
“I’m fine.”
Steve yawned.  “What about it?”
Tony brings a hand up to cup his cheek, fingers brushing over the slight stubble. “Mm… yeah.  I don’t buy it.”
It was a candid of all of the Howling Commandos, including Peggy, Howard, and Colonel Phillips, on one of their very few days off.  They were stationed in France that night, and Bucky, Jim, Gabe and Howard thought it would be a brilliant idea to get rip-roaring drunk on some questionable wine.  The aforementioned were draped across the card table in various states of drunkenness, while everyone else looked on with a mixture of amusement and disapproval.
know,” Tony drawls, “that we both have to be at very important meetings in forty-five minutes.”  He kisses Steve’s nose before getting off the bed.
“Very well.”  Thor picked up his wine glass and got up from his seat.  “I am very thankful to be here, sharing this feast with such admirable companions on this holiday.  We would not be here were it not for Tony’s generosity and willingness to take in such a group of unique individuals.  I am very grateful to know you all, and proud to be fighting alongside you.”  He took a moment to glance at everyone at the table before smiling. "And I am truly humbled and thankful to call you my ‘family.’” He raised his glass. “So, I would like to make a toast: to family.”
“It isn’t important,” Tony replied.
Steve opened the bottle and poured a liberal amount of lube on his fingers. “We’ll get there,” he replied before reaching behind himself.
not enough!”
The first press of their lips together was like a shock of lightning that Tony could feel to his very bones, the first touch of Steve’s fingers on Tony’s skin firing up every nerve in his body.  His entire body was thrumming with energy, and he felt like his heart could beat out of his chest at any moment.

Steve had camped out on the couch in the room after tucking Tony into his bed, keeping an eye on him to make sure he didn’t get sick.  Tony had apologized profusely for his behavior the next morning, too embarrassed to even look Steve in the eye.  Steve had assured him that it was all right, making Tony promise to find him if he ever needed to let his frustrations out.

"I don’t think we’ve ever done this."
Tony nodded.  “I didn’t think a future with
“We love both of you dearly and simply want to know how you are holding up,” Thor added.
Steve felt his face heat when Thor held the photos out.  “They, um.  They are rather… cute?” he tried.
Steve was almost positive that the size of the work would actually constitute it as a
Jan brushes away her own tears and approaches the podium, getting the attention of the reporters again. “The Avengers have been a team for almost ten years,” she says. “Steve Rogers and Tony Stark were romantically involved for the last six of them.”  She deliberately pauses, expecting a flood of questions, but they don’t come.
“And Tony knows what works for you?” Natasha probed.
Tony knew the exact weight of Steve’s words.  He’d accompanied Steve to enough nursing homes and seen the resigned look on Steve’s face when reality set in and Steve realized all over again that they had all moved on.  He’d recognized the longing in Steve’s eyes whenever he spoke about Peggy, and heard the hollowness in his voice whenever he mentioned Bucky.
“I didn’t actually uh, sleep,” Tony admitted. “Couldn’t.”

“A mistake,” Steve repeated.  It stung to hear Tony talk about it so flippantly.  “Right.”
“He managed to escape the wreckage, but his shield wasn’t so lucky,” she says, jokingly.  “The poor guy is going to be crushed when he wakes up.”
"Tony… what… What are you talking about?”
“Does the Captain believe that?” Frigga asked, catching Tony off guard.
“Okay, Steve, I love you, but if you don’t calm the hell down, then I am going to make you,” she threatens. She flashes him a pleased smile when he sits next to her on the large bed.
“Good morning,” Steve greeted.
After that, he loses track of things.

“He thinks
“I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean…”
Tony shrugs, and that’s all the answer that Steve needs.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked.
“The pleasure’s ours,” Tony replied, looking far more collected than he had been just ten seconds ago.
Tony looks over and sees that Steve’s entire body is practically vibrating with tension. “Are you all right, Steve?”
Steve put his head on the counter, refusing to give Tony the satisfaction of the blush slowly spreading over his cheeks.  Tony had mentioned to Steve on multiple occasions that making Captain America flustered was one of his favorite pastimes.

Pepper is also the one that takes a photo of Tony’s slack-jawed face when Tony sees Steve, dressed to the nines in a dark blue suit, waiting for him at the table.  She pats Tony on the back before making her exit.

the other day.”
The ride back to the tower was excruciating: Tony drove so cautiously that Steve was half-tempted to get out of the car and walk back himself.  He was sorely tempted to say something, but he bit his tongue.  Tony was furious with him as it was—he didn’t need any more ammunition.
“I’m not good enough for him.”
“Okay?  Of course I’m not
“What are you doing here, Tony?”
“Perhaps it would be better if I took that before you go in to meet the King and Queen,” Phil suggests.
“Sounds nice.”
Steve cut his words off with a slow and tender kiss, sitting them both up until Tony was sprawled across his lap and he could cup the other man’s face with both hands.
So he withdrew, and eventually drove Steve to move to DC.  And as much as Tony hoped that Steve would find someone else and move on, the mere thought of that actually happening devastated him.
Tony shakes his head. “I shouldn’t have come in the first place.”
“Then why don’t you save us both the trouble and just come out with it?”
Tony’s heart aches a little because he knows Steve works extremely hard, but he still has never seen Steve look so tired or worn down.  When Tony finally makes his presence known, the hard lines on Steve’s face immediately disappear, and he practically lights up when they make eye contact.
“Nope.”
“That’s not the

idea what the hell any of you are all talking about!” Tony yells, but it falls on deaf ears, because they continue to bombard him with questions.
Tony knows Steve is going to be fine.  He knows that the man will wake up and heal, and probably go out and save the world again in a few months, but as silly as it may be, it’s still a relief to hear Natasha say it.
Tony grunted, the sound swallowed by Steve’s mouth crashing down onto his own. He scrambled for more contact, arms slinging around Steve’s neck and shoulders. He parted his lips and swept his tongue out against Steve’s in an invitation Steve took no time at all to answer. But it ended as quickly as it started, and Tony absolutely did not whine when Steve abruptly broke the kiss, pressing their foreheads together as he panted against the engineer’s mouth.
“You bargained with the
“You clearly aren’t over it if your moping is any indication,” Bruce pointed out. “You haven’t spoken to one another in a week.”
“I’m sure that’s not true,” Steve assured with a smile. “The property is beautiful.  People must be clambering to get their names on the waiting list.”
“I’ll be fine,” Steve says, despite the slight sting from the fading bruises on his hips.  The man, the spoiled son of some big-shot CEO, was slightly younger than Steve.  He had been surprisingly pleasant company during the charity dinner, but was a lot rougher than Steve had expected when he was dragged down into one of the empty rooms of the mansion they were in.
"I was… I’ve been trying… for a while—"
“You’ll find someone,” Steve says with a sad smile, “Someone who’ll give you everything you want and treat you the way you should be treated.  Someone—”

Pepper looked unconvinced.
Steve gets off the couch and pulls Tony up with him. "Come on, let's go."
But even supersoldiers eventually run out of patience, and Steve finally draws the line after Tony momentarily leaves the room after a couple of rounds in the sack, only to come back with a half-full box of double-chocolate cupcakes.
Tony almost drops his mug. “You do?”
“Is that so hard to believe?”
“Probably,” Steve agreed.  He couldn’t help the smile on his face as he watched Tony get off the bed and walk over to his suitcase, rifling through its contents for his toothbrush.  The man was completely nude, save for the sock on his left foot.  It was a seemingly innocent picture until one took in Tony’s messy hair, the darkening bruise on his neck, and the light sheen of sweat drying on his skin.
“Was that okay?” Tony asks quietly.
On their third date, Tony had brought Steve a bouquet of red and yellow roses.  Their colors stand for romance and friendship respectively, but Steve’s pretty sure Tony had mainly picked them because they match his armor.
“Why didn’t
“You’ll be fine,” Steve replied, not even bothering to look up from the television.
He lay there holding Tony as he slept, and watched as the man’s face was bathed in the golden glow of sunlight, dancing across his dark eyelashes, his nose, the softness of his lips.  It was a mesmerizing sight: one that Steve realized he wouldn’t mind waking up to every morning for the
Steve stretches out his hand. “C’mon, they’re just shoes.”
It’s a simple gold band, but it matches the one on his own finger perfectly.
Maybe Steve had yet to learn how to wine and dine someone, but somewhere along the line, he had certainly learned how to embrace being a public icon.
Thor chuckles, a deep, rumbling sound that Steve loves.  He twists a little in his chair so he can lean on the table to tell him: “You’ve got a great laugh, y’know?” which makes Thor laugh even harder.
This is

“Oh, stop looking so guilty.  You knew exactly what you were doing.”

Tony quirked an eyebrow. “You got a dog

.  You can’t expect me to pretend like none of this ever happened between us.  You might be able to do it, but I can’t.”  He turned on his heel and stalked away, fighting back the disappointment when Tony didn’t call for him.
“Never.”  Tony knew Steve hated hearing it, but he would put Steve’s well-being before his own without hesitation.
“No, I’m
Steve gave him an appraising look before shrugging his shoulders. “You would’ve done the same for me.”
“Hey, calm down.  I was just kidding,” Tony said with a chuckle.

“Ha ha,” Tony drawls, and drags his feet to the coffeepot.
“Done… y’know…”
“I’d be happier if you went out a bit more.  You’re supposed to be getting something out of this arrangement too, remember?  I don’t want to be the one holding you back—”
“Then shouldn’t you be thanking me for being such a thoughtful and considerate date?” Ty backs him up against the kitchen counter and places his hands on Tony’s hips. “C’mon, baby.  It’ll be fun. I’ll show you a great time—”
“It won’t happen.”
"…Okay, I see your point.”
Steve yawns but still manages to nod.  He finally lets Tony go after a few moments and lays back down on the pillows. “M’always happy with you.”
“I know.”

Tony has absolutely no intention of living the rest of his life without Steve, but recently, the actual topic of marriage seems to cross his mind more and more frequently.
look good.  Why couldn’t they have gotten that one of us in Malibu?”
Tony just took another bite of his pizza.  Some sauce dripped onto his chin, and Steve stifled a laugh, thinking of what the press would say if they saw the self-proclaimed genius-billionaireplayboy-philanthropist in such a state. “What’s so funny?” Tony asked.
And another.
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony asks, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve’s gotten into the habit of leaving it a little longer—Tony had mentioned once or twice how much he liked it that way.
“Yeah, uh… no, thanks,” Tony said, backing away. “I’ll just find another hotel—”
“She’s just bitter that Steve never had an interest in her.”  Margaret flashes him a smile so beautiful that it makes Tony question his sexual orientation (again). “I’m Lady Margaret, but you can call me ‘Peggy.’”
Once again, Tony isn’t sure what it is that comes over him, but he pulls Steve down by the collar of his shirt and kisses him.
Tony wishes his repulsors weren’t damaged in the fight, because the last thing he wants to do is have this conversation.  He takes a step back. “Steve… I can’t—”
Let’s just say Tony’s arm gets quite a work out that night.
“But you—”
“He’s a well-known playboy,” Rhodey reasons, “and a businessman.  He knows how to get exactly what he wants—”
Steve sighed and looked down at his glass that was nearly filled to the rim with lukewarm beer. He had barely taken a sip of it but had felt nauseous almost immediately after.
“Are you asking me out?  Because you shouldn’t ask someone out when they’re only giving you forty percent of their attention
“It’s not my fault you found the ring before I could ask!”
“You’re exaggerating.”
Steve stood and plucked a pair of boxer shorts out of his luggage and slipped it on.  He looked back at Tony and saw that he was already completely dressed in a pair of dark-wash jeans, a plain gray t-shirt, and matching striped socks on his feet.  Nothing about the ensemble was particularly striking, but then again, Tony had the ability to make anything look high-end.
Some days, Tony will be so immersed in his work that the only acknowledgement Steve will get is a ‘hello’ and (maybe) a quick peck on the cheek before the genius is back to coding or wiring or… whatever it is he does.  But Steve just sprawls on top of the worn leather couch in the corner of the room and listens to the sounds of the workshop until they lull him to sleep, like the steady hum of the machinery in the background, or the subtle beeping coming from Dummy’s charging station.
“I think… Sometimes I think I’m dreaming or something,” Tony admitted. “That one day, I’m going to wake up and I’ll find out that the past three years weren’t real because it all just seems too damn good to be true.”
“So uh, do you wanna grab lunch or something?” Tony asked abruptly. “Vanessa said there’s a great seafood place down the street.”
Steve kisses his temple. “You know you can tell me anything.”
“There’s no way you’re in perfectly good health with the amount of junk food you consume.”
Natasha sighs. “Your information—”
Peggy gets a job at a prestigious company in Europe, and they break up a week before graduation.  Steve’s heartbroken, of course, but he eventually gets a job as an illustrator for a magazine. The pay sucks, but he and Bucky find an affordable apartment close to his office, so that makes up for it… slightly.
Tony smiles. “I may be a little biased but anything that reminds me of you is a good thing.”
“It’s not that.”
Tony is terrified of Bucky.  Sure, the man’s cool and all, and Tony’s seen firsthand what the CFO can do in a boardroom and how he can charm the press just as easily, if not more-so, than Steve.  Bucky’s been by Steve’s side longer than Peggy, Natasha

“How much am I suing him for?” Tony asked.
Tony appraises him. “I don’t want you to do anything you aren’t comfortable with.”
too much—and paws at his pockets. “Where is my phone?  Where is it, oh God.  We need to be recording this for posterity.”
“No, it’s just…” Steve says, between laughs. “God, Tony, you’re so dense.”
“He’s reckless, Pep,” Tony said. “He never takes care of himself, always sacrificing himself for everyone else and thinking about their needs before his own and—”
The next day, Tony took him to the movies.
Tony rubs his arm where Pepper’s nails had dug into his skin.
Steve doesn’t know when he falls asleep, but he when he wakes, the workshop is dark.  Tony’s on top of him, their bodies a tangled mess of limbs, and Steve can feel Tony’s steady breathing against his collar bone.

“I’ll stay at the Four Seasons and give you a few days to gather your things,” Tony says, dodging Steve’s question.
-date?
“What can I say?” Steve murmured against his neck. “I have a gift," he added with a twist of his wrist.
“I figured as much,” Steve says, leaning forward and pressing their foreheads together. “I’m not good at this.”
“Later,” Steve murmured after pulling apart. He pressed another chaste kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth. “Promise me, Tony, that when this is over, we’ll sit down and work this out. You can tell me then.”
Tony remained still, keeping his gaze fixed on the television in front of him. “Whatever you’re trying to do isn’t going to work.”
“Fuck if I know!” Tony says.  He turns to Pepper, who’s flipping through the channels on their television. “Pepper, now isn’t the time for TV!  I’d like to know
!” Steve says angrily. “Who dumps their significant other on their anniversary?”
Steve leaned over the side of the bed and reached into the nightstand.  He rummaged through the contents before taking out a small, black velvet box and gently nudging it into Tony’s hand.
“Are you—”
Steve looks good—he
The slow, careful sex is undoubtedly the best that Tony’s ever had in his life, but after a while, Tony realizes that Steve has a kinky side.
Tony groaned at the burning stretch. “How are you so good at this?”
His favorite sound, however, is Tony’s running dialogue as he works: the way he mutters numbers and equations under his breath, the excited tone in his voice when he figures out a solution, the occasional curse when something doesn’t go quite the way he planned.  Steve especially loves listening to Tony’s conversations with JARVIS and Dummy—he loves how little the man has to say to get his point across to his companions.

the nurturing type,” Tony protested.
Steve blushed. "I was under the impression that we are… were,” he corrected, kicking his boot against the concrete floor.  "Now, I’m thinking I probably misread things.“
“But I didn’t.”
Pepper cut in.
A quick search tells Tony that the saying means “A friend is another self.”
“I like you too, y’know,” he says, his breath leaving him in a rush.
“Really?”
“Yeah, sure,” Steve says, unimpressed.
"R-Right,” Tony stutters. “It’s not.  True.  Not true.”  He eyes are looking everywhere that isn’t directly at Steve. “I uh… I’ve got to get down to the office or Pepper will have my head.  Excuse me."
“I don’t see how dressing up like penguins and eating overpriced food helps kids.”
What he didn’t expect, however, was the economy size pack of condoms.

Sam threw his hands up in the air. “Praise the Lord, he finally said it!” he exclaimed. “Captain
“A real bore,” Tony answered.  He made his way to the fridge and grabbed the orange juice before drinking directly from the bottle. “You guys do anything fun while I was gone?”
Unconditionally and irretrievably
The silence in the quinjet is stifling, and all Tony can think about as he looks at the weary faces of his teammates is:
“You… you’re serious?”
"I’m sorry about those headlines, I really am, but I… They aren’t completely untrue.  I like yo—”
Tony raised a brow. “
Tony smiled back. “I do.”
“Tony,” Steve said, softly. “Sweetheart, look at me.”
“Did you… not know…?”
Steve shifted his weight. “A movie?  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie with me.”
Natasha caught the look Steve was giving her and coughed to get Tony’s attention. “Being immortalized in a painting is pretty cool, isn’t it?” she mused, subtly elbowing Clint’s side.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Rhodey drawled. “Maybe the fact that your teammates haven’t seen you all week?”  His arms were folded over his chest, and he was giving Tony the trademark look of disappointment that Tony’s seen on his face ever since their days at MIT. “Pepper’s worried.  She thinks you’ve been working too much.”
There was no way in hell that Tony would jeopardize his friendship with Steve over something so insignificant as a

“What happened?” Steve inquires.
in the background.
Tony moves his head to avoid it, but Ty just brushes his lips against Tony’s neck instead.  “Ty, please, I really don’t want to—”
“Yes, but I didn’t ask for the stuff.”
His favorite sound, however, is Tony’s running dialogue as he works: the way he mutters numbers and equations under his breath, the excited tone in his voice when he figures out a solution, the occasional curse when something doesn’t go quite the way he planned.  Steve especially loves listening to Tony’s conversations with JARVIS and his bots—Steve loves how little the man has to say to get his point across to his companions.
, Ty—”
He takes pride in knowing that he’s one of a
“It’s perfect, Tony,” Steve said, kissing his nose. “It’s perfect.”
“After you vanished for three months?” Tony scoffed and pulled away from Steve’s grip, even though all he wanted to do was move further into the blond’s space. “What?  After spending the past six months together, you didn’t think I’d notice that you were gone?  Of course I noticed!  Right about the time you missed your self-proclaimed ‘anniversary’ that night, and the dozens of unanswered texts.”
“We’ve been dating for almost two years.”
Tony shook his head. “Sometimes I question why I programmed you to have so much sass.”
Steve hadn’t realized he was staring again until Tony tentatively called out his name.  Tony approached slowly, stopping within arm’s reach.  Steve wasted no time in grabbing him and pulling him into his arms, burying his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.
Still, the press had always hounded him like a pack of wolves, and Tony chose to embrace it— he’d rather give them something scandalous to talk about than have them prying into the more personal details of his life.
“Not a chance, Rogers,” Tony said as they both got into the car and buckled up. “I’ve seen the way you drive.”
Steve eyes the object wearily. “I don’t have much of a green thumb.”
“I do know,” Steve said, with a small, but fond smile. “Believe me, I do. But I want one good thing to look forward to at the end of this mess.”
Tony graciously accepts the mug that Steve offers to him.
Steve had a fleeting thought of what his life would have been like if Tony hadn’t been there when he woke up from the ice, and trampled it as quickly as it had materialized.
,” Tony bantered.
“Is there a rule that I don’t know about that says I have to spend every minute of every day with Tony?”
Steve’s face turned bright red. “Nothing!  I wasn’t—”
“Oh.”  This was far from the first time they ran into each other after a restless night, and Steve knew better than to inquire any further; what Tony needed was a distraction. “You hungry?” he asked instead.
It just gave him more time to think about how to break the news to Steve.
See, it’s a well-known fact that Tony Stark has a sweet tooth.
“It’s fine,” Steve said dejectedly. “I’ll get over it.  I mean,
Tony stood outside of the guest room that he and Steve were sharing, his hand frozen on the handle of the door.  He had rehearsed a hundred different scenarios in his head, a million possible outcomes for how the evening would pan out, but this was
Steve and Tony never intended to hide their relationship from the rest of their teammates, but they didn’t feel the need to broadcast it to them all so soon either.
,” Tony says, crinkling his nose in disgust.
And it happens again after another party the next weekend.
“Yeah, you’ve said that befor—shit, fuck, ow!” Tony curses when he trips and stubs his toe on Steve’s shield.
“You’ve heard about me?”
Tony gently ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. “What are you thinking about?”
Steve furrowed his brow in concern.  “You don’t what?  Is something wrong?”
They get paired up to work on a project together, and it’s through their late night meetings at the coffee shop that they get to know each other over the course of the month.  Tony falls for Steve in every single way imaginable, but given his string of unsuccessful ‘relationships,’ he doesn’t decide to pursue anything with him (at least not so soon).
“Stop starin’ at me,” Steve mumbles.
Tony nods. “Thank you.”
“These trips can get a little lonely,” Tony admitted.  He took a seat on the bed. “It’s nice to have the company on my downtime.”
Sure, Tony acted flippant and nonchalant in front of the police and medics, but he scared out of his mind when he was tied down with a  gun to his head.
“Too much?”
—was never boring. Each day brought along a new adventure and a different set of challenges, and no two days in the

Steve is the one that blushes this time. “I mean, uh… you’re always with such classy, high society people, and—”
“A car?” Tony repeats. “Where the hell are you?"
Tony shrugged. “We’re friends, right?  Sometimes these things happen.  It definitely isn’t unheard of, so I don’t think there’s any need to dwell on it.”  He set his mug down on the cart. “Don’t get me wrong, last night was great—
. For fuck’s sake, do you know what that felt like? Especially with fucking
“I love you,” Steve says as Tony slips off of him.
“You didn’t have to—”
Steve hadn’t even realized what he had said until it had already left his mouth, but when he saw the genuine surprise on Tony’s face, he found that he really didn’t care.
A couple weeks later, he opens his briefcase halfway through a board meeting to retrieve a contract, and underneath the sheaf of paper is another neon blue Post-It.  His heart immediately starts pounding.
“Me neither, but I’m glad they did,” Tony replied.  He leaned forward and kissed Steve’s nose.
Steve shakes his head, unable to articulate an actual response.
Or rather, what he was wearing.
” Pepper asked.
“It’s a nice car,” Steve defended as he slid his own phone into his jacket.
He knows the others had seen visions too, but Steve didn’t seem affected in the slightest.  Looking back, he realizes he shouldn’t have assumed.
Destruction.
“You don’t know that,” Tony snaps. “Of course, I want to see him.  But I know that I’m just gonna end up letting him down again.”
“Are you ever gonna kiss me, or are you just gonna keep smiling like a dork?” Steve asks.
“Steve!”
“Lemme guess, a bitter ex-girlfriend or employee that was out to get their revenge for me dumping or firing them?” Tony said before dipping a finger into the batter and tasting it, and then held out the wooden spoon to Pepper.  “Hey, can you taste this and tell me if you think it needs more sugar?”
“I’m pretty sure we’re dating.”
“Healing,” she replies. “He looked a lot worse when we found him.”
, but the point was that they totally could if they wanted to.
Tony knew from the beginning that getting romantically involved with a celebrity was going to have its drawbacks.  He long-ago accepted that he probably wouldn’t be able to live the normal life he always dreamed of as a child, but after going on that first date with Steve, he realized that
“I was there!” Tony’s sad smile faded from another burst of anger. “I was there the whole time, Steve! Where were you? Gone! Every time I came out of that lab since you first left, you weren’t around. You were like a fucking ghost and it wasn’t like I could interrogate everyone without giving away your dirty little secret!”
Steve furrowed his brow. “What do you mean?”
And if he got JARVIS to record parts of it for their own private viewing pleasure later on, well... no one needed to know.
?” he asks after falling back into rhythm.
“So…” Steve drawled, his arm resting behind Tony’s shoulders. “Do you come here often?”
“No, Pep.  I—”
“That’s why I didn’t take you,” Steve explained. “I figured we could find something to do that we’d
him, of course, but still, he’d heard them.
“Have you had a lot of experience with these types of situations?”
,” Pepper explained.“
It smells like
“Why?  We’ve slept in the same bed before.”
“I love you,” Tony says when Steve appears in his lab with two cups of coffee and a box of baked goods. “Are these from—”
“Tony, it’s all right.”
Steve looks unimpressed. “You’re seriously telling me that you can’t choose between your loving, doting, supersoldier boyfriend, or a mound of baked flour and sugar?”
Tony’s alive.
“None of that matters to me–”
“Why are you so convinced that you’re going to mess up?” Steve asked. “If anything,
“God knows I want to give you what you want, Tony, but you should be with someone who actually deserves you—”
“Tony,” Steve grunted.  It was taking every ounce of self-control in his body to keep up the languid pace he set. “Darling, let me see you.”
“All right, kids,” Steve said, dragging Tony out of the room, “your parents are going to bed, so don’t stay up too long.”
.  Jessica Jones is the one that suggests they finally have a real press conference a month later with just a handful of the most prominent Avengers, but Steve demands to go as well, because the reporters would definitely say something about the leader not being there.
"Shut up,” Tony says, but doesn’t deny it.  Steve thinks it’s okay because the red blooming across Tony’s face speaks for itself.
Tony shook his head.  She made it sound so easy—as if Tony wasn’t putting his friendship with Steve on the line. “I can’t do that, Pep.”
“Yeah, well it would help if he actually learned how to clean up messes instead of making them bigger.”  Tony picked up Steve’s sketchbook and looked through the pages of sketches of the Natasha, Clint, Thor, Bruce, Sam, and even Tony, Dummy, and Butterfingers. “You’re a real good artist, Steve.  Dummy actually looks somewhat intelligent in this one.”
“Okay honey I’m gonna stop you right there.” Sam said looking at her, his voice conveyed embarrassment and disapproval but his eyes said otherwise as he straightened Jemma out and grabbed the upside down book from her hands.
He ended up falling on his butt and hitting his head on the sink as he tried to scramble away from the confused Tony.

was doing. But he didn't because that was what he loved about Pepper. She was painfully honest, she gave it to you straight. No mind games. She stuck to her goals and took things seriously, always aiming for the best possible result. She was smart and sharp, she could think on her feet and always found ways to clean up Stark's messes. He knew he had taken advantage of her. He tried, he wanted to show her how much she meant to him but he never could, not in any way she understood. He was surprised and thankful she had put up with him for so long. So, yes she broke his heart when she told him she needed more, more than he could provide for her, because Tony had been trying his damn hardest to be what she wanted, what she needed. But he wasn't enough, he wasn't good enough. Story of his life, thought Tony, never able to live up to people's expectations, always letting the ones he loves down.
"How's their party?"
“At least RSVP for two. Tell Nat you found a great date and then on the day of the wedding just say she got sick.” Bucky had pleaded him. Steve said no, that he would rather not lie to Natasha on her wedding day. The exasperated Bucky soon hung up, but not before reminding Steve that as best man, he was in charge of planning the bachelor party. Steve made it to his car really looking forward to the pickme up of today's activities. His stomach let him know he was going to visit the restaurant first. He pulled out the directions Fury had scrawled on a piece of paper for him and headed for the restaurant.
"As much as I would
The photo showed Tony in his dimly lit kitchen. Hair a mess, dark locks flying everywhere, face smug but filled with glee, lashes casting shadows on his cheeks, pink tongue sticking out proudly, showing off his skill, shirt hanging loosely and comfortably on his shoulders, not Steve's shirt, but this one suited him well, the red contrasting off his skin nicely. Steve tried not to let the whimper in his throat out. The beep from the microwave is what finally brought Steve back to reality.
The lights were off in the apartment. Classic surprise party move. He waited for them to jump out and scream. Reminded his body and mind that he wasn't on a battlefield and that these were welcome noises.
“I’m not fully naked.” Tony cut in, with a pout.
Steve wasn't the type of guy to stand someone up. Tony knew that. So there had to be a reason for his lateness.
A car honked at them, hurtling them back to reality as they moved out of the car’s way and towards Tony’s car.
"We almost done here?" Tony asked looking at his watch.
“The towel is fine,” Steve said, not wanting to lie anymore. And it
"Hey, Steve it's me. I have your clothes." A beautiful deep voice answered him.
“Hey, I know that shirt don’t I?” Tony asked, eyes readjusting on Steve’s chest, and
“No you already got the Barton baby. This one is mine.” Jemma pleaded.
“... It’s a pie” Steve mustered halfheartedly pointing at the pie, hoping with all his might his face wasn’t as pink as it felt. “I don’t know, I guess I was worried is all…” he mumbled to the pie.
a voice in Steve's head chimed,
“Here let me take a picture of you two.” The zookeeper said as they were petting the cheetahs that were now sprawled out on the grass below them.
“You haven’t come over in a few days and I just-” He began explaining, upon seeing Tony’s confused face, “- I don’t know if I made you upset or made things awkward between us by talking to you like that so I just-”
"Why- Uh- Why- Wha-What, what-?" Tony stammered, hand reaching up to scratch his neck. He took in another deep breath and refused to look Steve in the eye. "What um, what exactly did I do. Why do I owe you a towel Steve? Fuck, I hate the blackouts. I never know when to stop drinking, I always think I can handle it. I've got no fucking self control, I go around making a fool of myself instead, god why am I such a-" He was falling into a full-on hate speech and Steve was feeling helpless not knowing what to do to stop him.
Steve pouted his lips, waiting for an answer to come out of his mouth but nothing did.
Once, when the phone was finished, and Tony was explaining one of the features he got
He grabbed Tony and kissed him. Pushing him back against the corner, thudding as they hit the wall. A picture frame— the first causality of the night— fell off the wall, bouncing off the floor until POP!
“Wow, eight missed calls…” Tony said when the new phone came to life buzzing with the information of the old one.
“Hello Mr.Stark. I’m Jemma Simmons, it is a huge pleasure to meet you sir.” Jemma said bowing in front of him causing Sam to swipe a hand along his face.
Nat rolled her eyes. “Come on everyone.” She got up from the sofa. “Steve will be here any minute. Let’s go hide at Tony’s.”
"I was talking to a friend on the phone and I lost track of time."
"I don't have much need for sleep. Getting it every once in a while, like when I was with you, is good enough. And if you saw my messages then why didn't you answer me? I told you to call me when you got home. You didn't. What are you too good for me Steve?" Tony answered and Steve could actually hear the false indignation and teasing smile through the phone.
“Wait…” Clint said slowly, “I don’t understand what that means.” Eyes darting back and forth between Natasha and Laura, finally settling on Steve’s to see if he knew what they were talking about.
“Round three then?” Steve said in between kisses as he pulled Tony on top of him, there on the kitchen floor.
“Whoa” Tony said, his eyes lapping up the starry night sky.
Minutes later, when Tony rolled Steve on his back so that he could be on top, the whisper finally pierced through the noise. “
“Wabrist” Tony yelled at his phone as he opened it. He had somehow managed to wrangle his way through the crowded mansion and to the front of the house.
to you too Steve. Glad to see your phone is indeed working, you were able to read my texts?"
He handed her his phone and walked over to where Steve was standing in front of the polar bear showcase window.
"Oh, we must." Assured Clint with a nod.
Also, I hope the flashbacks aren't too confusing.
This is a liliger : https://www.google.com/search?q=liliger&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=595&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIyvaVzsvZxwIVyTOICh3mzwa2
“What are you guys doing?” Steve said struggling against Thor as Sam buzzed Tony in.
“So then what are your plans for the bachelor party?” Tony said continuing one of the many conversation they had started during lunch.
“Um. Thanks bro but you’re not the most covert guy I know. I was thinking maybe Jane could somehow sneak it in there or something, in between some science talk or whatever.” Sam shrugged.
PLEASE GO CHECK IT OUT!!! It would honestly mean the world to me. If "I Have Pie..." made you smile please return the favor by bookmarking my new story on Tapas <3 Love you!
Tony couldn’t stifle the whimper that escaped his lips. He almost sounded like a puppy begging his owner for a treat. He wasn’t ashamed of that.
Thor set the last plate and sat down as well. Soon the kitchen and living room, were the folding chairs and makeshift elongated table extended into to, were filled with cheery laughter and excited conversations.
” Tony looked up from the phone at Steve’s frozen red face, “who are the Carter girls?”
“No, I mean it’s a lot harder than it looks. First time I tried, we almost burned down the apartment.”
“Well, no this is different.” Bucky pointed at him. “I’ve seen Tony’s parties on tabloids Steve. I’d rather not end the night with a helicopter crashed in the swimming pool and a tiger roaming the house. C’mon, don’t shirk your responsibilities Steve, I want you to plan my party. Not him.”
“Naked?” Tony asked suddenly.
Anywho, hope you like this chapter ^.^
"It's mostly just my notes for building it. Sketches of the design and the hardware...that kind of thing. Probably won't be helpful in figuring the thing out." Tony said as he grabbed a bag of cherries from the fridge.
The rest of the friends nodded, throwing out, “yeah” and “good idea” as they made their way to the front door.
“When you say in ‘your room’,” Tony started slowly, “like are we just gonna chill on your bed eating the chips while we wait for the burgers to arrive or-”, he stopped, feeling like an idiot for being so focused on that one part.
“I don’t know, but last week you made it pretty clear it wasn’t what you have going with those girls,” Steve replied, his voice too rising in anger, he just didn’t get why Tony was so stubborn, couldn’t he see that Steve was just looking out for him?
"You-you didn't get
“I promise Tony, never again will I bake another pie without you.” Steve smiled with a wink.
*******
“What should we reply with?” Nat smirked scooting closer into Bucky.
"Umm yeah. Right." Steve fumbled over the words when he noticed Steve was already climbing into his car.
“But it was my vision.”
“Thanks.” Tony said as he retrieved the phone from her. He turned around in time to snap a picture of Steve leaning into the dolphin's nose. His forehead pressed against it, eyes closed, lost in the moment. Steve opened them, laughing, as he turned to Tony, who snapped another picture. Steve bearing a toothy grin as the dolphin kissed his cheek.
Steve quickly glanced up at his clock, 7:01 am.
. Honestly, that’s all I meant.” Steve urged.
He fumbled for his pocket as he stumbled back towards the house. After a few tries, he managed to pull out his phone.
“And is that Tony your texting with now?” Nat asked with a smirk as she got up from her chair. Steve instinctively tightened his grip on the phone as he nodded yes.
“Tony thanks again for all the food you brought. It was incredibly sweet, you really shouldn’t have.” Laura said as she hugged Tony goodbye.
Steve was now genuinely confused and cautious. “In the dark?”
Tony nodded his head slightly, cleared his throat and said, “there’s more. You have to open it.”
Tony tried to answer but instead, the words just got stuck in his throat causing his voice to hitch, he resolved in just nodding his head. Steve was already cocking his head down towards him.
“Tony your hand is red.” Yeah and so is my face probably, thought Tony as Steve carefully grabbed Tony’s hand from his chest to inspect it.
Once they were sitting down in a booth and had already placed their order, Steve tentatively placed the gift on the table, raising his eyebrows at Tony. The pure joy that had filled his eyes earlier was now fused with a feeling he was trying to mask, terror.
“Hey.” Tony ducked into Steve’s apartment.
"Can't you do it? I don't wanna." Tony said as sat on the toilet.
"No no yeah, I get it..." Steve's voice replied over the phone.
"I honestly don't know whether to be jealous of Pepper for bagging Stark or jealous of Stark for bagging Pep." Another one chimed in and that got Steve's attention.
"Hey stop looking at his lips," Sam nudged Clint, "he's mine."
“The— the surprise party.”
“Shit. You’re not supposed to be awake Steve. Go back to bed!” Tony exclaimed quickly turning the faucet off to wipe his hands and push Steve away. He was so caught up with making sure the breakfast was perfect and that Steve go back to relaxing that he didn’t even realize what he was doing until he felt Steve’s bare chest being pushed by his palms.
Comments and kudos keep me writing, so if you are enjoying this story please take some time for those!!
Shirt - idk, some polo french tucked. Maybe that white one from the pants picture? But looser and french tucked, because yes, Tony and Steve are the hugest fans of Queer Eye (and yes, they insert all of their thoughts and opinions while watching)

Hi. So, the last chapter was ALSO uploaded a whole year after the one prior. Just like this one. I'm so sorry.
I imagine Steve's sketch of Tony to be something like this (but with shorts and a tee) (not drawn by me) :
The video at the bottom of this page for the cheetahs : http://nationalzoo.com.au/meet_a_cheetah.htm
on the back of the sofa.
Steve looked up at Tony’s twinkling eyes, “yeah we should. That would be amazing.”
“Okay.” Steve said after a few seconds of staring into Tony’s eyes.
"I think..." Sam started, slowly, wanting to pick the right words, "I think that you have your heart in the right place and I love that you want all that and that you know you want it. I don't think it's old fashioned, I think it's sweet and a very legitimate reason as to why you are so careful in choosing a date. I'm pretty sure- no I'm positive if you told Romanoff all this she would let you off the hook...although yeah your probably right," he added at Steve's quirked brows, "she'll just start sending you on blind dates until you've found "the one"."
THANK YOU FOR READING. I love you. I really appreciate all those that have kept with the story, and to all my new readers... I'll try to be more consistent with the updates... try being the operative word :D
Tony blinked.
list, “thirty four things under no. And three things under yes.” Tony counted off with his fingers, “good friends, good food and good location.” Steve smiled in satisfaction.
“You know Tony, when you finally do choose someone to settle down with, you’re gonna make them very happy.” Steve said, patting Tony on the back, his hand lingering one second too long as his eyes flickered from Tony’s eyes to his mouth. Of course, this was just Tony imagining things right?
“Wait. Tony Stark built you a phone? One specially designed. Just for you?” Bucky said shifting in his seat, needing affirmation.
"Um...yeah just have a few more charts to get through." Pepper said quickly transitioning back into work mode and retaking the files in her hands.
“Just two friends of mine that I think could use a night out.”
"Well as a reporter you really oughta know that you have to clarify what you're saying." Steve smiled taking his coffee from Sam's hands and sitting down, spinning his chair to face his computer.
him...we’ve just been... hanging out.” Steve said his face returning to the color he had thought was only activated when he was around Tony.
Steve wanted to reach out and grab Tony’s hand, intertwining his fingers with Tony’s, and let him know everything was going to be all right. But instead he tightened his grip around the stool and gave Tony a tight smile as Natasha spoke for him.
“I…” Steve could feel his ears burning, and it wasn't just from being sucked and nibbled by Tony. “I thought, that—”
“Yeah. Beautiful.” Steve let himself whisper as he continued to stare at Tony.
Now they were laying in bed, getting ready to take the leap and start on the paperwork.
“Today is Thursday, I was over there Monday morning. It’s been three days Rogers! You couldn’t handle not seeing me for three days so you baked me a cake and came over?” Tony was wearing the hugest grin Steve had ever seen.
"Yes sir?" He replied crossing his arms behind his back as he reached Fury.
"Right."
He was so happy he sent his friends away for the next couple of hours.
“We didn’t-” Tony started asking, shifting on the bed
“Tony that’s- amazing. Though I know if anyone can do it it would be you.” Steve looked back down at the phone in his hand. It was a perfect fit in his palm, not too big, like some of the new phones, but not as small as his old flip phone. It was so beautifully designed that words could not do it justice.
Tony mused for awhile, “I want to go to the birds.”
“Mmm” was Tony’s response.
"SQUIDward!" Tony happily greeted him with a dazed smile as he came into the bathroom. His underwear was still caught on his ankles.
“Tony.” Steve scolded. “There are people—”
Tony silently thanked her as he put an arm around Steve’s waist and pulled him closer.
Watch ya think? Yay, nay? I know it was short, sorry, kind of a spur of the moment thing.
“Whoa there buddy, didn’t need to know how far you two have gone, but thanks for the info I guess.”
“Guuuuuyyyyssssss!!!” A voice called out to them from the front of the diner. Everyone turned to face the voice. Nat and Jemma got up and ran to Jane.

“You’re staring.” Steve, eyes still on the tv, broke Tony out of his trance.
A part of him pleaded, mainly the part that was connected with his legs.
“I’ll have a coke, easy ice.” He told the waitress as he slid into the chair. She glanced at Steve, waiting for his confirmation that this was an invited and wanted guest. He slowly nodded yes, eyeing Tony with curiosity. The waitress wrote down his drink and with a polite nod left to get them their entree.
“Right. Fiancé.” Tony kissed his forehead as he got up.
to take those off of you," Steve said his voice coming out in a husky whisper. "You are drunk. And that would be me taking advantage of you." He said, trying to shake himself out of it. The water was raining down on Tony. It was sticking to his hair, running slowly down his jawline, delicately dripping off his nose, glistening his abs and six pack— and Steve knew it, that though Tony didn't show off his muscles he sure as hell had them. His jeans were heavy with water now, weighing down around Tony's waist, showing off his white boxers, now see through, dripping down too because of the water.
“Rem-member that Star I was telling you bout.” Tony said after another pause.
Steve knew what it was, or at least he had his suspicions. He wanted to protest that he liked his phone, he was comfortable with it, it worked just fine, had for years. But the look Tony was giving Steve flushed all his arguments down the toilet.
“Is he here?” Jemma whispered poking her head into the apartment.
“If you want…” Tony finally said giving up, “I can help you plan the bachelor party.”
Steve looked down at Nat’s draft message. She had woven in what everybody had suggested and added a few things herself. Steve quickly deleted the message. He typed out his own response.
Hey ya'll so I was planning on adding the breakfast scene but I've had this part done for awhile and just haven't been able to sit down and right the next part so that'll be in the next chapter, sorry about that and thanks for putting up with me ;P

Here is a drawing of Tony that I really love that the end scene with the stars made me think of : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSDLhOOCIAAWmo2.jpg
“How was the doctor's visit?” Steve asked as she sat down. By the way Thor was looming over her with a big grin on his face, he was guessing everything was going well so far.
“Um yes, how did you…” Jemma said looking up.
"Uh I just finished watching your videos." Steve confessed, replaying his favorite parts over in his head, "I uh- I loved them and well I just felt like I had to call you...you know, to thank you for all that...." Steve raised his free hand in exasperation.
When visiting the adoption center two weeks ago, Morgan had run up to Tony and dragged him by the thumb to go play with him. It was love at first sight. Steve even told him she looked just like him.
“Guess you found your date to the wedding huh. Good it’s about damn time. Should I send the wedding invitation to the Stark Mansion or do you just want to give it to him yourself?” She smirked as she took out a sealed wedding invitation from her backpack and carefully wrote Tony’s name.
He looked at the sketch of Tony lying nearly naked on his bed, he tried to not let the horror show on his face.
“Wow, let me be honest that movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.” Tony said coming out of the theater laughing, deciding that Steve’s arm was the best thing around to steady himself with.
Steve thought,
"Man that guy scares me." He whispered to Steve as he made his way to his own desk.

Steve's Outfit For Breakfast:
How was it? Were the flashback hard to follow?
It" being the plan he had. The plan of Steve walking up to him and seeing him in all his beach best glory. He was wearing a loose white button-down, rolled up at the sleeves, and a pair of fitted beige beach pants. Sitting will cause wrinkles and sand to go everywhere. No, that's not how he wanted Steve to see him. Not for their first date. First date. He hoped it was still happening.
You are totally right, person I made up to ask me these questions! I DO have a very bad track record at uploading consistently. That is why I will wait until I have a few chapters written on this story and then schedule them to post while I write more! That being said, I am working on a few writing projects and also real life can get pretty busy. Uploading though gives me a sense of accountability and responsibility (are those just synonyms?) so even if it takes a bit to upload, I will eventually upload. So don't forget to bookmark/subscribe!! Also, comments are always my biggest motivators! So feel free to leave feedback, seriously it would mean the world to me!
"Oh." Tony didn't bother covering up the dejection in his voice.
Tony stared at her. “True. They have you. Makes me feel better." He tilted his head, grinning, "Not a lot better. But enough. You're in charge.”
They both took long sips of their coffees, each trying to figure out a course of action to take. Sam opened his mouth to say something but was cut off by a resounding "Wilson!" that echoed across the floor.
Tony felt like he needed a pillow, or something, anything, to squeeze and scream into, because for crying out loud, what did he do!?
A baby monkey crawled up behind Tony and grabbed his phone. He swung down into Tony’s lap and, laying on his back, started pressing at it.
Tony thought as his hands fiddled with themselves on his lap, his minds replaying over and over the way Steve said adorable and his smile just getting bigger and bigger as they started driving to Nat's house.
“Hi!” Morgan said, grinning wide at the men. She handed them some ponies.

Sorry for the long break. Here's is the next chapter.
“Your, uh, your boyfriend Bucky must be pretty curious wondering where you are,” Tony said squinting his eyes at the phone in betrayal for portraying such information.
“What’s your name?” Tony asked. He looked at the legos Harley had in his hand.
"Ye-yeah" Steve answered. He's sure they were helpful, he was just too busy paying attention to Tony talk to focus on all the rules and instructions. Oh well, another excuse to watch it again later.
Yes, Tony had been sleeping, after a long irritating day of meetings and the fact that he hadn't had a single good night of rest the whole week, he gave in easily enough when Jarvis pleaded him to get rest. When his lights turned on and his phone started blaring Steve's ringtone, well sleep could wait, more important things had just come up.
"I'm- I'm glad you called," Tony said as he made his way towards his lab.
“N-no it’s- I- I meant- yester- I’m fine! Nevermind, it was stupid. Forget I said anything.” Steve said, eyes refusing to meet Tony’s.
find a date?"
“Rogers how was your first day with the art side of the company yesterday?” Fury asked Steve as he came up to his desk.
"Go. Take a seat son." Fury replied nodding towards his office, closing the door after them as they went inside.
“You coming?” Sam asked nodding at Tony.
He nodded to the beach and the two began walking along the sand.
big bulge that had popped out at him.
“J.A.R.V.I.S has been on the Fritz, which should not be happening considering I’m the one who designed him… Anyways I’ve just been really busy with that, I haven't left the house at all, or slept or eaten or you know… and I guess… I thought that maybe you didn’t want me back. I mean I am basically the opposite of everything you stand for right?” Tony said, suddenly finding the pie very interesting and refusing to look away from it.
“Yeah okay.” Steve finally said and was received by a big grin from Tony.
“No. Ever since I drunk called him I’ve been nothing but a bother. Plus I’m pretty sure he’s at work right now. He’s a jo-” Tony said rubbing the back of his neck with his hand.
"I see you can draw a variety of things from cartoons and animations to nature and people." Coulson looked up as he set down the sketchbook. Steve glanced at the page Coulson had left open.
“Come on.” Steve nodded to the door.
The panic in Steve's voice shamefully calmed Tony down.
He knew Tony had probably enlisted the help of their friends. Knew that Tony himself had probably been worrying about every little detail. Every possible outcome. Every possible disaster.

“'Ven when I’m...dr-drunk I’m sart,” he proudly informed those around him.
"Different from all the other phones out there." She echoed, her mind sounding far away. "Yeah, I like the sound of that. Our investors will too. When should I set up a press conference?" She said as she pulled out her tablet.
Do we want a part 3? To finish it off, see the proposal and what not? Or is the rest up to your imagination? ;) Let me know!
“The monkeys.” Steve answered after a while.
~ThatFanwriter *many soul mending hugs and kisses*
Tony’s laughter echoed echoed through the valley. “C’mon old man.” He said facing Steve.
Tony gave him a death stare then with a roll of the eyes said, “Bruce you aren’t my therapist, stop psychoanalyzing me.”
"I am not risking my friendship with neither Peggy nor Sharon." Steve cut in.
"I love this song." He stated at one point, as the song in the background changed to a new one. He raised his arms, a wrench still in his right hand, closing his eyes lost in the music. Steve watched as the man began swaying his hips tensing his muscles in rhythm. Steve listened closely, wondering if this was another rock song. He couldn't believe it when "dashing through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh" began coming from his speakers, Tony still completely lost in his amazing little dance. Steve rewatched that scene more times than he would be willing to admit.
“Okay. Well, hold on, don’t open it now. It’ll distract me too much from the driving. We're almost there.” Tony perked back up a little.
Tony shivered, not totally understanding what that meant but knowing it sounded hot as hell.
Steve turned, spotting Tony. He waved back as he hung up.
“Of course you don’t remember.” Steve realized. “You were really
“You know one of these days I really should turn you from my door, make you go face one of these women.” Steve grabbed his own cup of coffee and sat on the counter opposite Tony, their knees practically kissing.
“We’re just saying,” replied Nat, “that if you were ever to get together with Tony, it
“You did sign the waiver forms right?” She asked dryly, then seeing their faces added, “I’m joking. Ha ha ha. I’m kidding, they are seriously well trained, as am I. We have never had an incident. Come on over.”
“You went into your bedroom and came out with this shirt” he tugged at the one he was wearing, it was hugging his muscles perfectly, “you said something about how that shirt had gotten you through some hard times growing up and in college and how you were wearing it when you first got J.A.R.V.I.S to start working and that you wanted me to have it to help me get over the girl.” Steve ended with a warm smile.
“Um. A little more together?” She said glancing up from the phone screen to the couple.
Steve, however, no longer looked teasing or playful, instead he just stared at Tony, which would have made Tony squirm away and find a hiding spot, had it not been for the small warm smile tugging at Steve’s lips, the way his eyes just seemed to reach out and envelope Tony in a hug.
In the few minutes Tony was gone Steve used all his will to force his thoughts on the movie and figuring out what it was about and what had happened so far.
Tony remembered. And even then, sometimes he had yelled to hold on while he put something on. For all Tony knew Steve slept stark naked, he didn’t want to walk in on that...right? He ignored the feeling that idea gave him. He could feel his heart beating like a drum in his chest, he hadn’t been this nervous since his first day at MIT at the age of 13.
“Don’t. Don’t apologize Steve, not to me okay?” Tony cut him off, head snapping to face Steve. “ I love that about you, out of everyone I know you’re the only one- at least the only one that matters- who always calls me out on my shit. You’re not scared to talk straight with me, okay, I don’t want that to change, don’t- don’t be sorry. I needed to hear what you had to say. You know you’re right, the one night stands... they aren’t what I want, they aren’t what make me happy.” Tony stopped, he was staring intently at Steve and realized that he suddenly felt the urge to add ‘your what makes me happy’, but before he could figure out what his mind was trying to tell him Steve hopped off the counter and headed for the fridge.
“Um not sisters, but they were related… Peggy and Sharon - and not at the same time. I- we're all good friends now though and I don’t want to ruin that by asking one of them out again- especially since I don’t feel that way about them anymore.” Steve explained trying his hardest to not stumble over any words.
Steve stopped and slowly turned to inspect Tony. He was in fact still wearing his pants. His chest heaving from being manhandled into a corner.
Steve quickly stretched his arm, check in hand,  above him, well over Tony’ reach. Tony glared at him as Steve struggled to hold back the laughter bubbling in his throat. Tony grumbled and slouched back in his chair.
body— your kindness and wisdom unmatched. I was lost, broken. I had no one. Nothing. You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong… You gave me a home. You’re an inspiration to me, Steve. I may not think like you or act like you –– but I sure as hell do respect and appreciate what you do and the way you do it. You’re an idealist in a world that is far from ideal. You could be my rudder, steering me when others couldn’t… And I know you're not perfect either. Sometimes too quick to judge… too slow to forgive. You'll always voice your opinion. You’re stubborn and, let’s face it, sometimes our egos compete. I don’t want perfect. I want you. I can’t imagine my life without you. I’m not half as good at—at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you. And that’s the truth. We help each other be better. And if you'll have me, if you'll allow me the honor of spending the rest of our lives together, I'll spend the rest of mine making you as breathless and rambly as you make me. And, yeah we’re gonna get on each other’s nerves, argue, but at least we’ll do that together too. So. Steven Rogers.
“Haha, well I figured this way I could eliminate any more chances of you waking me up at 3 am yelling, in a german accent I might add, ‘Mr. Rogers, oh captain my captain?! Mr. Captain please it’s wakey time, the world needs you, I need you!’ through the keyhole in my door.”
“Buck no.” Steve pleaded as he saw Nat’s evil smirk and her fingers begin to tap the phone.
-brown eyes. Steve assessed the man in front of him, and he had a strange feeling the man was doing the same to him.
“No! We didn’t have
“That’s no way to treat your guests Rogers.” A voice chided from the entrance. Steve spun back around to see Bucky and Nat enter his apartment, both tsking in disapproval.
“No stay.” The girl next to him pouted pulling at his sleeve. “Let him call a cab.”
“Is that a yes?” Steve whispered, his nose bumping Tony’s.
“We don’t need to put our phones away though, right?” Steve checked as they sat down.
of Tony’s.
too see-through boxers that covered it.
“it’s Wednesday, you have work in the morning, and I’m like a forty five minute drive from your house. Shit why did I let you drive me home? It would have been faster if you’d just driven home and I called for a driver. Sorry, that was inconsiderate, that’s me though, the selfish basta-”
"Yeah. But I was in the area and figured hey why not? Have you had breakfast yet? Come down and I'll drive us someplace to eat." The voice dripped like honey through the machine, echoing in Steve's tiny apartment.
“I’m Steve Rogers. I’m a journalist. We had had a phone interview earlier yesterday.”
“You know it’d been so long since I had last come to the movies that I almost forgot what it was like.” Tony said, still holding onto to Steve, “we should do this more often.”
“Well hey,” Steve offered without a thought, “as you’re best man I’ll do it.”
"Screw it. I'm just gonna call him." Tony finally shook his head, as he announced this to the world around him. He pulled up his hand, so his watch was once again across from his face. "Jarvis. Call
"Wait you guys understood what I said? I don't even know what I said." Steve said staring at their grins.
"Is that a yes? Or have you already eaten?" Tony's voice once again filled the apartment. Steve glanced towards his kitchen, his plate still resting on the table, empty. Then down at the glass he was still holding, empty.
“No.” Nat said, sneaking up behind the two men. “It’s more than that Clint. Not only are they good friends now, they are interested parties.” She said raising an eyebrow.
“Wait!” Tony quickly stood up. “Let me.” He took the knife from Steve and brought the pie closer to him, lining up
“What, being in a crowded kitchen?” Sam asked behind him.
There was a mess of bundled up blankets surrounding Steve, they were strewn away from Steve’s body enough to let Tony know that Steve did not in fact sleep with pajamas on, but enough to keep Tony wondering whether Steve went full commando or not. Steve wasn’t wearing Tony’s shirt but instead clutching it close to his chest, as if he had run out of pillows and he needed something to hug. Tony tried not to read into that since there were plenty of free pillows surrounding Steve. Tony lingered a few more seconds, admiring how calm, at ease, innocent, and delicate his friend looked while he was sleeping. Tony found his breathing easing and matching Steve’s rising and falling chest.
“As for right now. We have to go to that Innovators lunch downtown. Yeah, I know, I don’t want to go either. But we have to.” Bruce said as he got up from the sofa. “Come on.”
“Tony, I’m in my car and I don’t know where to go. You are very smart and we will have a discussion on whether or not you're stupid afterward, yeah?”
I love you, thanks for putting up with my sporadic postings. (*＾v＾*) -ThatFanwriter
“Do I have something on my face?” Steve continued in a playful tone as Tony tried to not think about the fact that if either one of them leaned in just a few inches or so their lips would be touching.
“Tha-that’s what I meant bro. But if your mind went to the other place then maybe that’s where you wanna be too.” Sam suggested. Everyone stared in silence at Steve when he didn’t respond right away. He could only open his mouth part way and stare at them as well.
“Umm...” Tony stuttered.
“Hi.” A worker greeted them, “will you two be swimming with our dolphins today?”
"Oh well, Stark and Pepper were just spotted on another dinner date." One of the girls answered him pointing at the computer screen which displayed a grainy photo of Tony and Pepper sitting at a table in some fancy Italian restaurant. "This was taken thirty minutes ago," the girl explained, "they are honestly the cutest couple ever!"
“We failed miserably,” Steve started laughing, “we nearly burned down the kitchen, we most certainly burned the pie… I’m pretty sure the alcohol consumption got in the way a lot, that and the talking and stuff...”
Tony wanted to snide back
the same as what Tony had put him through that night with the shower, but hey, he had to get back at him somehow.
. She put up with me, she took care of me. But I was- she was
When Steve stepped back into the bathroom, he faced a dilemma.
This was different.
Steve grinned. "That sounds fun."
Steve reasoned in his mind as he watched Tony prepare two slices of buttered bread. He smiled in thanks when Tony put one on his plate.
Tony wanted to scream, he wanted to yell at her for breaking his heart and only caring about the company and how
“What are you doing woman?” Sam said as he walked over to Jane.
“Hap it ain’t good. Bad idea, why'm just a bad idea person. Listen... Hap, I need you to pick me up.” Tony said wandering further away from the house, the music was getting too loud, he didn’t know how anyone could hear themselves think.
“I- I think dolphins are my new favorite animal.” Tony said looking at the dolphin then back at Steve.
“Yes, Tony.” Steve smirked, “Pie, you wanna make more pie?”
They spent the rest of the time swimming with the dolphins, sometimes being led by their fins, others times being propelled forward on a waterboard and other times just swimming and petting them.
“And I wanted to personally give him the wedding invitation.” Nat said pulling out the envelope from the night before.
, he yelled at himself pulling the present down to his lap,
“I love boring and simple!” Bucky argued.
Steve looked back down at the phone then up again at Tony, confusion letting through wonder and awe.
Hey so.... it's been a year.... yeah I'm not even going to bother with excuses. Just sorry and here you go :)
!” Tony yelled out.
Had Tony not been so focused on worrying whether or not the glow from the tv screen was bright enough to illuminate the red creeping on his cheeks, he would have been reading into that smirk.
Tony’s senses flared up. He had done a lot of kissing, but nothing had ever made him feel this way, even with Pepper, his only actual relationship before Steve. This was different, it was gentle but needy at the same time, like it was something they had both been waiting for their whole lives, it made him lose his mind and had him begging for more. He wrapped his arms around Steve trying to pull him closer, despite the lack of space already between the two. Steve’s hands were wrapped around Tony’s neck, caressing and memorizing Tony’s jawline.
“Umm yeah. I mean I was really drunk too so I don’t remember all of the details towards the end there. But I do remember that before I went back to my apartment you stopped me, looked me dead in the eye and said you had one last birthday gift to give me…” Steve lingered, setting his eyes on Tony.
“Um…” Steve strained his neck to see what Tony was looking at. He was going through his sketchbooks.
For the allotted ten minutes Steve and Tony were allowed to pet the two cheetahs, who never really paid them much attention. Except for that time when one of the cheetahs kept licking Steve’s hand. During those ten seconds, Tony found himself unable to breathe and take his eyes off Steve’s hand, in fear that if he did it might not be there when he looked again.
He watched, his big eyes opening even wider, as Steve unwrapped the gift, revealing a silver inscribed box.
“Cool! If you’re cool with getting wet we could sit in the splash zone.” Tony replied and was answered with an excited nod from Steve.
“Well I still have the company card, so what I said before still applies. I need to pay.” Steve said grabbing Tony’s shoulder to keep him in place as he walked in front of him. They ignored the group of girls standing behind them who were failing at not giggling.
"What's going on?" Fury finally asked, leaning back on his desk. "You've been staring at your computer for the past 15 minutes like it was alien tech."
He thought to himself as he pulled up Coulson's number.
He looked back up at Tony's expectant glare, as his hands hovered an inch away from the top of Tony's zipper, face two inchs away from Tony's crotch.
Steve nodded. It was sweet of them to celebrate the big day with them. “Okay. Give me a few minutes to… get hosting appropriate. Climbing off my lap might help me get there faster.”
Steve smiled fondly at him, holding in the smirk and the internal screaming because ahh showers and boxers and memories, “you had me at doooooo.”
An alarm blared off in his head. He brought his eyes back up to face Tony's, because apparently, at some point, they had fallen to rest on Stark's lap. Namely the upwards tent caused by the zipper being pushed up. The zipper.
When Tony dropped Steve off at home later that afternoon he forgot to give Steve his clothes and sketchpad back.
"Oh." Tony repeated. This time voice happy and intrigued.
"Yeah, they-- well, I'll tell you in person. I'm almost at the beach. Where are you?"
The lady on the speakers informed everybody that the show was about to start and that everyone should put away their electronics so as to not get them wet.
