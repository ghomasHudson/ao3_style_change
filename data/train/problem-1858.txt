Sherlock found he didn’t care.  There was a comfort in the numbness.  Everything was vague and far away and that was good.
Lestrade struggled to see over Sherlock’s shoulder and into the room.  Sherlock stood straighter to block his view and shoved at the door, but Lestrade wouldn’t budge.
A quick shove had Lestrade stumbling back and out of the door frame.  Sherlock made to slam the door in his face but the D.I. reached out an arm to stop it.
And later on, when Moriarty was caught, he would be sent off to a prison in the furthest time zone so that John Watson wouldn’t even be in the same calendar day as him.
He tried to speak but his throat was too tight and only a choked whine came through.  On the other end, Mycroft sighed.  Sherlock hadn‘t been the only one to form habits during his drug addiction; this was certainly not the first phone call Mycroft had received from Sherlock where the younger man was unable to speak.
Molly had been about to leave work when a new body was rolled in.  She took one look at the name on the tag and knew she wasn’t going anywhere for the night.
Nothing to prepare him for the sight of his flatmate and lover lying on the couch with his head turned at an awkward angle, limbs sprawled and his skin so ashen it looked grey.
“I’m trying to follow you, here, Ms. Hooper, but I’m not sure I do.  When you say coming around, you mean…”
“Listen, I can’t get him to wake up.  I need you to send an ambulance.  Quickly.  Have them bring all of their supplies with them, I don’t think he should leave the flat.  John hates waking in hospital.”
As the kettle boiled on the other end of the morgue, Molly pondered what she would look like dead.  Many people found these thoughts morbid, but John probably wouldn’t.  She could talk it over with him.  And while she was at it, perhaps she could ask him a few questions that she had always wanted to know the answers to.  Questions about what being in love with Sherlock had been like.  Questions about how it felt to have Sherlock love you back.  He wouldn’t answer, but her mum had always said that sometimes just getting the words off your chest helped.  Besides, they were getting to a rather steamy section of the book and she thought it would be just too much to read that out loud.
The world went fuzzy around the edges.  Sherlock’s hearing faded into a faint ringing.    He felt himself being led into a chair.  Two hours.  Where, where
“Good.” Sherlock cut him off, grabbing the front of his jumper to pull him closer and leaning in so that their lips were ghosting each other.  “Because I have no intention of letting you sleep just yet.”
He noticed his hands were shaking, clenching and unclenching in the fabric of John’s jumper.  The walls were vibrating and he couldn’t block out the sound of the traffic outside.  His own breathing was too loud and too cruel - only one set of ragged gasps filled the room.
Sherlock was babbling.  He was reduced to begging in front of his brother and the person who might as well be his boss, he was humiliating himself in front of strangers he had never met, but it didn’t matter.  The looks of pity on everyone’s faces.  The shushing noises Mycroft was making as he gripped back firmly on his hand.  None of it mattered.
“John?” Sherlock tried to call out, but his vocal chords seemed as frozen as the rest of him and it came out as only a soft whisper.  Clearing his throat gruffly, Sherlock took a hesitant step closer to the couch and tried again.
“He's here but now is…not a good time, I’m afraid, Ms. Hooper.  Sherlock is not quite up for a chat about preparations of the body or anything of that vein.”
“Sherlock, when you’ve taken away all other possibilities, the one that remains, no matter how difficult it may be, must be the truth.”
Sherlock’s fists hit out against himself now, digging into his hair and tugging, punching against his knees.  His gasps verged on sobs and his brain was simultaneously telling him instructions for CPR and reliving yesterday morning
John fidgeted the whole cab ride home, clearly eager to leave the hospital behind.  He had been an agreeable enough patient - too kind if you asked Sherlock, though John pointedly never did.  He smiled kindly at the nurses who came in time and again: for more blood draws, to run more tests, to ask more questions to verify his cognitive abilities.  Apparently, being dosed with a shiny new poison led to a bit of a celebrity status at the hospital.  Every doctor wanted his or her own data with which they could form their own theory.  John had insisted it was flattering but Sherlock could see the relief in the man’s eyes when he had been wheeled out of the ward doors and settled into a black cab.
It was the most beautiful sound in the entire world.  Sherlock wished he could play something that exquisite on his violin.  A whole symphony that just kept repeating over and over “John is alive…John is alive…John is alive…”
Desperately, Sherlock turned to Lestrade.  "Please, one night.  Lestrade, help me."  When there was still no answer, Sherlock turned back to his brother and weakly reached out for his coat lapel.  "Mycroft, please, don’t take him to the morgue.  Please, please not for John.  That place isn’t for John.”
It hadn’t happened often, thank the Lord, because she was young and most of the people she knew were still very much alive, but whenever someone she had known in her day to day life was wheeled into her morgue, Molly made sure they were comfortable.  She would make herself some tea, settle in, and just sit with them.  Just for that first night.  It was probably against the rules or creepy or something along those lines, but Molly figured it‘s what she would want for herself, so she doesn’t mind extending the courtesy to friends and family.
They blocked his view as John was covered with a sheet and carried out of the door.  They didn’t let him say goodbye.
“I mean getting better.  Waking up.  I don’t know how to describe it, Mr. Holmes.  One minute I’m reading a book to him and in the time it takes me to make a cuppa, he’s just...stopped...being dead.  I hope he doesn’t teach the others or I’ll be out of a job!”
Sherlock gave up on the struggle over the door and turned sharply to return to John’s side.  He could hear Lestrade follow him in.
Sherlock Holmes sat in a plastic chair watching the heart monitor in the private hospital room of Dr. John Watson.  His eyes had a hard, hungry look in them as they followed the path of the blips, as if he were waiting for them to stop.  But they never did.  The beeping continued on - consistent - over and over.
She read for a half hour before her voice got tired and she needed more tea.  Setting the book aside, Molly glanced back at John’s face.  It pleased her to see that he looked more like himself.  Perhaps she was just getting used to the dead version of John, but now, to her, he looked almost the same as he had a week ago when she had last seen him.  His skin was more the right shade and the lines on his face that had been so sharp with rigor mortis were softening.
John still hadn’t regained consciousness, but he was breathing on his own and his pulse was strong.  Sherlock knew; he had spent the first three hours with his fingers on John’s wrist to make sure.  Doctor’s were baffled but optimistic.  The words “full recovery” had been thrown around in hushed whispers.
People were talking to him.  Lestrade.  Mycroft.  Mycroft’s horrid assistant that John would flirt with to make Sherlock jealous.  Hands were touching him.  He let them.
Sherlock looked around the room and realized it was the first time he had scanned the full flat since he had arrived home.  The sofa had occupied all of his attention and it felt strange to take his eyes off of it, even for the few seconds it took to make a cursory glance over the room.  He couldn’t focus on the details, couldn’t remember if those papers had been on the floor when he left this morning or not.  It didn’t matter.
“I’ve changed my mind, Mycroft.”  Sherlock attempted to make his voice sound brisk.  Normal.  “We won’t be needing your assistance.  It’s all…it’ll be fine, actually.  Don’t come here.  Don’t bother.  Go eat something.  Rig an election.  Stage a military coup in Africa.  We’re fine.”
Sherlock pulled his own hand back into himself with a shudder, cradling it to his chest like it was wounded.  He stayed retreated for a moment, eyes darting as he took in the facts that had sprawled themselves on the couch.
Sherlock’s mind ticked observations, trying to record all of the infinite aspects of John.  His breath wanting and wet against Sherlock’s neck.  Each tiny movement, every single flex or shift of muscle.  The noises that dropped from his mouth as Sherlock slid a long digit in.  And then, finally, when Sherlock drove home, the warmth that surrounded him.  Everywhere was warm and moving and vibrantly, gloriously living.
Finally saying it out loud seemed to drain the last reserves of strength from Sherlock and he slumped to the floor, curling against the coffee table again.
No!  With a shake of his head, Sherlock forced his thoughts in order.  There was no time for a short-circuit now.
Soft typing and muttered voice could be heard on the other end.  No doubt the video feed for their living room was being accessed.  Sherlock sat up a little straighter - Mycroft would be able to figure this out.  As insufferable as the man could be, he had a knack for fixing all of the worst situations Sherlock found himself in.
Another whimper scraped his throat.  A car horn sounded in the street.  Outside was being loud and Sherlock was being loud but John was oh so quiet.  It wasn’t fair.
“No no no no no.”  He was mumbling it now, over and over, shaking John, hitting John, turning his head this way and that.  Cold all over.  John’s body was so cold -
But Sherlock let that go for now.  Tonight, he was happy to just sit and watch the monitor, wrap himself up in the consistent beeping reminder that this was no longer a John-Watsonless world.
Molly squeaked a little as John managed to roll his head once again.  A light sheen of sweat seemed to be forming on his brow.  She closed her eyes tight and willed him to
The kettle clicked and the tea seeped.  Molly turned back to resume her vigil but stopped in her tracks.  It was a most curious thing.  Molly spent a lot of time around dead bodies.  John Watson no longer looked like a dead body
The body.  The words sank through the layers of Sherlock’s mind and stopped everything.  That was wrong.  John wasn’t a body, he was John.  Sherlock’s eyes squeezed shut as he laid his head on John‘s chest and buried his nose into the soft cable knit.
Molly, for her part, screamed and ran to the other end of the room.  John’s forehead scrunched slightly as his breathing slowed until it was no longer audible.  But she could still see it from her crouched hiding place behind the desk.  John Watson’s chest was rising and falling ever so slightly.
Right.  A phone call was in order.  Not taking her eyes off of the reincarnate Dr. Watson, Molly hit number one on her speed dial.  Sherlock.
“No.  He doesn’t.  I will get the information from you later.  Now kindly let yourself out.  This isn‘t a good time.”
Mycroft promised that an autopsy wouldn’t be performed tonight.  No one would touch the body tonight.
Still, more delays loomed in the future, and the thought of having to use patience set Sherlock’s teeth on edge.  He would have to work a bit more stealthily with his flat mate back.  John Watson was not going to be involved in this case anymore.  He was to be kept far, far away from Moriarty (not that John knew that yet) and it was better to avoid the subject for the time being and hold the inevitable fight off until John had recovered a bit more.
"We don't need a holiday to have sex," John reminded him, tilting Sherlock's chin upward and kissing him deeply. "We could do that any time and anywhere. Like here and now, for instance."
Sherlock eyed the takeout, want overtaking suspicion as he opened the door further and let her in. Molly took in the sea of empty liquor bottles on the living room floor as Sherlock led her through the flat.
Sherlock let out a huff of laughter, once again caught off guard, so much so that he replied, "both," before he could stop himself. His laughter died immediately and his cheeks flushed crimson; he took a drink of his coffee to busy himself, not meeting her gaze.
“Always,” He replied, watching John’s ass as the latter walked towards the flower shop. “I’ll see you later?”
They laid together side by side afterwards, heaving for breath and grinning to themselves. Sherlock lit a cigarette, watching the smoke unfurl towards the ceiling.
"Sherlock - " John began, but was cut off by the sound of the flat's front door opening and a harsh, low voice calling out, "love?"
Sherlock's next client arrived. In three hours, Sherlock was done for the day. He stood, stretching, John standing up with him.
"Shit!" Sherlock sat up, standing up from the bed and tugging on his pants. He looked at John, panicked. "You have to go."
Sherlock nodded and continued eating. John went about making tea, careful to move slow and quietly so as not to spook Sherlock. Sherlock finished his cake, wiped his mouth and put his plate in the sink before retreating to the living room. John couldn't help but let himself smile a bit; Sherlock, though still too quiet (an after effect, John knew, of receiving beatings for making too much noise), was at least starting to return to his normal self, bit by bit. Sherlock turned on trash telly.
“Well, I have the measurements for the laundry hamper that you needed…Have you called an ambulance?  He looks terrible.  He needs a hospital, mate.”
John seemed to be waiting for something - a signal - so Sherlock nodded once to show he understood.  With a smile, John released his hold on Sherlock’s chin and leaned up for a soft kiss but Sherlock evaded him.
A knock on the already open door startled Sherlock.  There stood Lestrade, wide eyes taking in the sight before him.
Sherlock blinked firmly and tried again.  But John was still there, hadn’t moved an inch, not even a rise and fall of his chest.
A poison that made the victim appear for all intents and purposes dead.  The very idea of it made Sherlock’s mind start ticking and traveling down roads of implications and motives.
He fumbled as he removed his gloves and forcefully pushed two fingers at John, checking the carotid artery at the neck -
Sherlock was suddenly flipped onto his back and John hovered above him, a dangerous smirk playing on his face.
“You don’t know?”  If Sherlock had announced he was done with detective work and going to faff off take up accounting, Mycroft couldn’t have sounded more surprised.
Sherlock supposed that was good.  That was what he had wanted.  He tried to let a small sense of victory sweep in, but it faded away like everything else.  His brain was moving impossibly slow, thoughts weren’t clicking into place like they usually did.
“No!  No.  Mr. Holmes, I think I have some good new!  There may not need to be a funeral.  The body…John…he’s coming around, I think.”
“No.  Please.”  Sherlock tore his eyes away from John to look at Lestrade properly.  The man’s eyes were rimmed red and his face was paler then normal.  He might understand.  “I can’t let him…I don’t want him to leave….”
“I didn’t mean to…the front door was unlocked so I let myself in.  Sherlock, what’s going on?  Is he…?”
“Hmmm,” was the only reply. Sherlock felt no pity for the hateful thing and made sure to send it a quick glare.
“Sherlock.  Please.”  There is a firmness to the voice now, a soft command to stop the foolishness.  But Sherlock couldn’t stop.  He couldn’t admit what was happening.
“No, no, NO!”  The refrain was back, Sherlock yelled it this time as he leapt up and tried to cover John with his own body, but it did no good.
A long tone let Sherlock know he had a text message.  With a  frown, he tore his eyes away from the monitor to check.
With a whimper, Sherlock curled down into the legs of the coffee table and away from the sofa that he was going to burn when this was all over.  When John was better and everything was normal.  Yes, John would smile and they would burn the sofa, cushions and all.
- the text message tone blared and three kids were yelling outside and Sherlock felt his whole world shrinking and blowing up all at once and John was just laying there doing NOTHING not even MOVING and he always helped someone in need and Sherlock NEEDED him and and and…
It wasn’t until Mycroft answered on the second ring that Sherlock actually consciously realized he was making a call.
They came in somberly but in they came.  Medical professionals, who ushered Sherlock away from the sofa and then took his place hovering over John, touching him and poking at him.  Mycroft came in next, all gravitas and condolences.  Sherlock turned on him.
Her nervous giggle was not shared by the elder Holmes.  There was another long beat of silence and Molly found her anxiety getting the better of her.
Carefully, Sherlock eased himself along the side of the bed, not wanting to disturb John but needing to feel the warmth of him.  The monitor sang its beautiful song and John’s breath was soft and even.  It was almost enough.  Sherlock allowed himself to be lulled towards sleep by it, ready for this day to be over and deleted.
Afterwards, they lie slumped and spent, arms thrown around each other.  John must really have been well rested because he began fidgeting again after only a few moments, getting up to grab a washcloth and clean them off.  Sherlock was still pleasantly sated and couldn’t be bothered to move when John returned to bed.  He felt the other man lean over him, putting the lube back in the nightstand drawer.
A whole new wave of terror seized Molly.  She hadn’t even thought of that until she said it.  Her fears were quickly stomped out by the derisive snort on the other end of the phone which reminded her exactly who‘s brother she was talking to.
“But the meaning remains the same,” Mycroft's voice was still soothing.  Sherlock wanted to kick in his teeth.  But it was too late, his brain had already latched on to the facts.
Already Sherlock could feel his brain returning to full power.  Rebooting after the total system breakdown he had experienced.  Tomorrow he would scour the flat for clues, take a sample of John’s blood to test when the doctor’s weren’t looking, check some contacts from the homeless network to see if people had heard of anything like this.
The voice was gentle.  Sherlock hated that voice.  It reminded him of when he was six and Mycroft had explained to him that Gladstone wasn’t coming back from the vet.  But this wasn’t that kind of situation at all, so why was that voice being used?
A growl of frustration vibrated in Sherlock’s chest as he realized he couldn’t find what he was looking for; no pulse pressed back against his two fingers.  He leaned his head close to the mouth and nose to listen for breathing, holding very still over the lips -
Climbing the well-worn seventeen steps, Sherlock let John do the honors of opening the door to their flat and stepping inside.  The doctor gave a pleased little sigh as he set his bag down and shrugged off his coat.  His sigh deepened when he turned and saw that the couch had been swung around and shoved roughly against the wall, leaning on its front with a vicious tear across the back fabric.
“Hardly.” he said briskly, clearly snapping into movement on the other end of the phone.  “Call a doctor.  We’re on our way.”
There, better.  His voice sounded much more controlled.  He had to stay calm.  He had to figure out how badly John was hurt.  He had to wake John up.
Sherlock felt his brain pulling in every direction: cataloging clues, recalling medical cases that had shown the same symptoms, spewing memories back at him.  His skin felt like it was crawling and adrenaline poured white hot throughout his blood stream.  He couldn’t focus on anything or think what to check first.  He couldn't catch onto the threads of thought wrapping themselves in circles in his mind, Sherlock couldn't think, he was useless and John was just laying there being useless as well.
Lestrade must have finally gotten a good look at the doctor's body, because he stumbled away from the sofa and tripped backwards into a chair.  John’s chair, Sherlock noted with annoyance.
On its own, his cell phone seemed to have produced itself from out of his coat pocket.  With practiced movements, a habit born from his drug addled days -
Sherlock hissed a breath in through his teeth and clutched at the hand, trying to warm it up, to make it right.  In a rush, his brain - which had stayed frozen by the doorway when the rest of him had moved - came rushing back to him and began working overtime.
The car stopped outside of 221b and they trudged out into the rain.  This was a bit of a homecoming for Sherlock as well.  He had slept in the hospital for the three nights John had been kept there, stopping at Baker St. only to grab clothes and a quick shower.
He ended the call before his brother could object or throw any more facts in his face.  For once in his life, Sherlock did not want facts.  Sherlock only wanted John.  He buried his head into the jumper and took a deep breath, trying to catalogue every last thing that made up John Watson.
“No,” Sherlock gasped into the soft wool of John’s jumper.  He knew intimately what happens to bodies in the morgue.  But not to John.  Sherlock wouldn’t let that happen to John.  His hand was shaking as he brought the phone back to his ear.
Sherlock, on the other hand, was drawn into himself across the seat of the taxi.  He sat very still and watched as John absentmindedly tugged at his clothing and readjusted himself in the seat.  John moving was good.  He liked very much when John did that because it made it more difficult for Sherlock to recall how still and silent John had been before.  Sherlock had never known that some things were too horrible to delete, but that particular memory, the first sight of the corpse from the doorway, was proving impossible to scrub from his mind.
John cupped Sherlock’s face gently, stopping the increasingly frantic kisses that the detective had been placing on his neck.  Sherlock's head was forced up and he found his gaze being held by deep, sorrowful blue eyes.
Sherlock stared at the message for a very long time.  Until his hands stopped trembling and his jaw had unclenched itself.  Visions of revenge danced in his mind and he entertained each one slowly.
The sound of the familiar voice, smug as usual, helped bring Sherlock back from the edge.  He curled his legs up into himself and took a few deep breaths, never taking his eyes off John’s unnaturally slack face.  The silence must have been too long for Mycroft and Sherlock could feel the concern sharpen on the other end of the phone.
"That's gonna cost you," James replied, cigarette hanging out of his mouth. "250 for a go at him, double that if you want to buy him for good."
The two were silent for a moment, until Lestrade stepped over to examine the Christmas tree. It had a 'first Christmas together' ornament hanging near the top - John's idea.  Sherlock returned with three glasses of the sparkling water.
“I didn’t want the baby,” Sherlock turned onto his back, his breathing labored by his drunkenness, his voice quiet as he faded slowly into sleep. “But with you, I could.”
"We're not having this discussion." Sherlock dug the coffee from the cabinet and began the process of putting it into the coffee maker.
He visited Sherlock every day, even when Sherlock was transferred to the psych ward. When it was time for Sherlock to be discharged, John moved back into Baker Street.
John sighed, pulling the beer from his hand again. “Do you want to talk about what’s compelling you to drink at the moment?”
"Thanks for reminding me I need to get my locks changed." Sherlock lit a cigarette, walking past John and into the hallway, towards the bathroom. John, of course, followed.
"He won't let me do an exam on the rest of his body," Molly told him immediately, her voice quiet as she put the kettle on. "By the sound of his breathing, he's got a few fractured or cracked ribs, and judging by the blood stains on some of his clothes - "
He took the plate of food Molly handed him and relocated to the living room, taking a seat on the sofa and handing her the remote as she sat down beside him.
Sherlock felt heat rise to his cheek as he realized the flower shop boy was staring at him from across the street. With his tongue like cotton, he finished wrapping the girl’s tattoo and tried not to let his cheeks go any redder.
"I figured it was time for something good," John muttered, keeping his voice low so Sherlock wouldn't hear. "He was such a wreck at his dad's funeral, it was insane."
"None of your business," Sherlock huffed, shuffling towards his bedroom. "I'm going to sleep, John, goodnight."
John bolted from his seat, arriving to the bathroom after Sherlock just in time to keep the door from closing. “I get to watch.”
“Is Sherlock almost done yet?” John asked the girl at the counter of the tattoo parlor, wasting no time with niceties.
The drive to the private clinic wasn’t a long one from Baker Street; as such, they arrived much earlier than John anticipated, and opted to wait in the car until they got closer to the time of the appointment. Sherlock lit a cigarette.
The fridge was empty except for the eyeballs Sherlock mentioned, a shit ton of liquor and beer, and a bushel of rotting asparagus. Closing the fridge and deciding he was done with the kitchen, John made his way out of the kitchen and down the main hall. He stopped at the bathroom, or rather, what appeared to be Sherlock’s drug room.
Sherlock watched him go and then reclined in his chair, finishing his cigarette with a goofy smile on his face.
"You've always been an upstanding man, John, you'll do the right thing and go back to her and raise a child with her, convince yourself to love her again." Sherlock picked at a loose thread of the blanket, shrugging. "It's alright, John."
"I wanted to assess how much more of a dumpsterfire you've become since I last saw you," Mycroft smiled coldly. "Also to inform you that Mummy and Father want us to come around to the States for the holidays - not that I'm going to let you go like this."
"I can't leave him now," John's voice now, low and serious. "He's just now getting clean, and if I leave now, he'll just go right back to - "
“Don’t make people into heroes, John.” Sherlock said quietly, focusing intently on the stencil in front of him. It was as if he had read John’s mind. “Just because I have a ‘tragic’ upbringing does not mean I am saintly as a result.”
After a few more draws, he sat up and began to get dressed too. Stewart finished buttoning up his shirt and pulled on his suit jacket.
Sherlock tucked the bag into the inside pocket of his coat and rolled his eyes, leaving without further comment and slipping cat-like down the stairs and back towards Baker Street. Every part of him was shaking by the time he got back to the flat, and he walked as fast as he could until with a sigh of relief he locked himself in the bathroom and hurriedly began the process of melting the coke to pull into the syringe.
“Come sit with me,” John murmured softly. Sherlock did as he was told, curling up on the couch next to John, their knees touching. John ran his hand through Sherlock’s curls.
He got to his feet slowly, gripping the edge of the counter for support. He ran the tap, cupping some water in his hand and slurping it into his mouth. He rinsed and spit, closing his eyes as he fought back another wave of nausea. After a moment of swaying on the spot, he pulled up his t-shirt, running his fingers carefully over the blood-soaked gauze haphazardly taped to his abdomen. He pulled the gauze back, wincing at the sight of the large, purple and blue, blood-crusted gash ripping through his side, quivering with his every breath. It began to bleed again as he pulled the gauze off completely.
“What can I say?” Sherlock leaned back in his chair, shrugging nonchalantly. “It’s one of my many kinks, John.”
"Tell me what happened to your eye," John took a step forward, hand on Sherlock's arm. Sherlock yanked away. "I've got to go."
"Perhaps that's what you get for whoring yourself out, brother mine." Mycroft's voice was cold again.
"Or I'll make you watch our little session tonight," the man had gone back to smirking, tossing a glance at Sherlock, who stared down at the counter without saying anything. "Have our little whore here put on a show for you as he gets fucked by our clients, hm?"
John slammed his laptop closed the second he heard the door lock click, his stomach churning and his hand fisting reflexively. After a moment he stood, pulling on his jacket from where it hung on the coat rack and leaving his flat for Mary's. If Sherlock was going to get laid, then so was he.
“They only teach that to straight men,” the other man took a long draw off his cigarette. “And girls aren’t really my area, mate.”
"If he's not there, he's likely at that bloke James' place. You know, out on Abernathy street - uh, I think the address is 284."
“Stay here,” John ordered sternly, standing and leaving the room for the kitchen. Sherlock got to his feet with a groan and followed anyway, shuffling slowly down the stairs.
“Just do everything you can to keep them both alive,” Mycroft told her. “We’ll confer with Sherlock after he’s out of the woods.”
The drive back to his place wasn’t a long one. Fitting the key into the lock, he let himself into the flat and shivered. It seemed so foreign compared to Baker Street now, even though he had only been gone a few days. Shaking the feeling off, he made his way into the bedroom. He had just enough time to shower and get cleaned up before meeting Sherlock for lunch.
"Shut up and give me the shit," Sherlock snapped, wiping at his nose with his sleeve. It was bleeding again. "And a couple of rigs."
"Do you remember that night after we caught that leather-obsessed serial killer and went out for drinks afterward?" Sherlock didn't wait for John to answer. "We slept together that night. You were too drunk to remember it. You should get tested."
"Back so soon?" Sebastian purred from where he sat at a desk in the corner, smirking at Sherlock. Sherlock shivered despite himself, unable to ignore the slickness in Sebastian's voice.
Sherlock quickened his pace, smirking to himself when John came only a few minutes later, a warm, silky mess. John relaxed back against the headboard, breathing hard.
Sherlock zipped up his jeans again, cigarette clamped between his teeth as he washed his hands. "You didn't need to know. You moved out, remember?"
“Yeah, make sure you wear knee pads next time you stay the night at Andersons, Donovan.” Sherlock shot back, and John collapsed against him in a fit of giggles.
“That wouldn’t happen,” Sherlock muttered. “Trust me, I’m very far removed from anything of that sort.”
Sherlock entered his bedroom and tugged his shirt off over his head slowly. John fought back a gasp; Sherlock’s entire rib area, visible beneath the binder, was bruised. Sherlock turned to look at him, apprehensive.
“Mycroft’s useless,” Sherlock spat, his face contorting into immediate rage. “He’s nothing but a selfish liar.”
John set the book to the side and crossed the room, planting a kiss on Sherlock's temple. "You mean our honeymoon?"
“I’m gay. Gay people don’t sit normally.” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly, opening his bag of crisps.
He heard footsteps on the stairs leading up to the flat a few hours later, turning to look as Sherlock strode in. The tall brunette peeled off his jacket and threw his keys onto the table as he entered, sighing, jumping a little when he saw John in his chair.
"I know," Sherlock replied, sniffling and wiping his eyes. He had to pull himself together. "I know."
Sherlock - Gone to classes for the day, should be home around six. Try to stay alive until then and make sure to eat something. Love, John.
“Jesus,” John muttered, standing and taking a seat next to Sherlock on the couch. He grabbed the hem of Sherlock’s shirt and made a tugging motion. “C’mon, you have to take it off.”
John padded his way downstairs and into the kitchen, bumping right into the figure in the hallway in his sleepiness. He blinked and looked at the man in front of him - this wasn't Sherlock.
“Believe it or not, I am kind of attached to the Holmes name.” Sherlock murmured dryly, still pushing the pasta around on his plate. “Some of their values are justified.”
“Well, anyhow, I’m glad you’re doing better, Sherlock. This situation with our father is taken care of, and I just want you to focus on getting and staying on the right track.”
"Fine," Sherlock called to him, steadying himself. With a deep breath he tried again, melting more coke and shifting it into the syringe before finding a new vein. He was slower this time, inserting the needle carefully until he was sure it was properly slotted into a vein and registering before he pushed the plunger down. He leaned against the back of the toilet as relieving euphoria overcame him, everything around him coming into sharp focus. Finally, the world was at the same pace as his brain. He pulled the needle from his arm and stood, flipping the seat of the toilet up and flushing the needle.
“How much did you drink?” John asked quietly, tugging Sherlock off the chair. He settled them onto the sofa, setting the glass on the coffee table so Sherlock could lay his head in his lap. He ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair gently.
The entire room grew still in a way the four could feel but Thomas couldn't. Sherlock, however, smiled. "Of course."
"Do you remember the first Christmas you spent with me? It was right after I took you in. You looked horrible. I don't think you weighed more than a hundred pounds. You detoxed on the couch at my flat. Kept saying sorry. Sorry to me, sorry to your brother, sorry to your mum. I went out and got you gifts that night, so you'd have some things to unwrap in the morning even though we didn't have a tree."
“Love you,” John murmured, kissing him on the cheek. Sherlock only blushed a little, redness creeping up the back of his neck and down the tips of his ears.
“I was designated as your caretaker when they discharged you from hospital,” John explained, searching on the ground for his trousers. “If you’re leaving the flat, I’m coming with to keep an eye on you. And to make sure you’re actually going to work and not fucking off all day drinking, like you were yesterday.”
“He beat me,” Sherlock said quietly, staring up at the ceiling and purposely avoiding John’s gaze. “Because I had hickies.” John noticed then, for the first time, Sherlock’s bleeding lip and nose - his piercings had been forcibly ripped out.
“I’ll see you later at your place, yeah?” Sherlock murmured, and John nodded. Sherlock swooped down and planted a kiss on John’s cheek, catching him completely off guard. He disappeared into the parlor without another word, leaving John standing there with a grin on his face. Taking a few moments to gather himself, John made his way back to his car.
“Start what?” Sherlock hummed, his lips moving to John’s neck. John tilted his head back with a soft moan.
“Come for me, Sherlock.” John murmured into his ear, his hand moving furiously. Sherlock whimpered and gasped, quaking and crying out as he spilled over the edge; John followed him, releasing hard and fast into Sherlock as they both fell into satiated bliss. After a few moments, Sherlock disentangled himself, falling onto his back in the bed beside John. They laid there for a few moments as the world drifted back into focus.
Sherlock hummed quietly in response, setting the kettle on the stove, a small smile playing on his lips. Mycroft and Lestrade glanced at each other, eyebrows arched.
It seemed to last forever and ever, until finally, things went quiet, the room gone still. John inexplicably knew, somehow, that the flat was empty; the man had left and taken Sherlock with him.
Sherlock looked punk as ever, wearing the same torn, ratty black jeans he had been when they first met. His combat boots were laced up to his bony knees; his curly hair was wet and unkempt, the eyeliner around his eyes and the blue lipstick he wore smudged with wear. The mesh undershirt had also returned, layered underneath the patch- and pin-covered denim jacket he always wore. There were cuts lining his rib cage, sticking out like sore thumbs from beneath the mesh, looking fresh. There was a gash on his face, his lip busted open, his left eye black and slightly swollen. His pupils were dilated beyond any natural occurrence.
“It’s better than doing drugs,” Sherlock mumbled, still not looking at John as he selected a button-up from the wardrobe.
“Alright.” Sherlock murmured, cradling his mug in his hands as Lestrade joined them in the living room. He clapped Sherlock on the back.
“Of course I don’t want to keep it,” Sherlock muttered. “As you said, we aren’t financially or emotionally well enough to sustain another life form. Nor am I mentally stable enough to withstand pregnancy and the resulting lifestyle.”
“Loans,” John picked at his sandwich with a shrug. “Being a med student is quite expensive, you know. And Mrs. Hudson is an old family friend, and she needed help running the store so I offered. Killed two birds with one stone.”
“You okay?” John asked, his breath hot against Sherlock’s abdomen. Sherlock blushed hard and nodded, biting his lip.
“It’s just driving me crazy, John. Making me want to drink and use. Fresh air and work to distract me will be good.”
"Neither does anyone else," Sherlock snapped, fist suddenly slamming into the kitchen wall. There was the audible crunch of his hand breaking. Mycroft made a soft noise of understanding.
With a sigh, John unfolded the piece of paper, to find a list in Sherlock’s messy chicken scratch of a handwriting.
"You don't think the whole system knows Moriarty's handling you?" Sebastian let out a chuckle. "Did you know there's an AIDS kink? He's advertising you as his best whore - skinny and sick, for those that like that kind of thing. Pretty weird, if you ask me."
The other artists roared with laughter as John blushed bright red, raising his hand awkwardly before hopping off the countertop and slipping towards the back of the store. He could still feel their eyes on him as he tried to look busy, reshelving small succulents and trying to ignore the heat burning his face. He didn’t find it safe to venture out again until twenty minutes later, when the artists had all dispersed to their customers and he was free to sit on the countertop again and read. Another hour passed, and then it was two hours until closing time. Not a single customer all day. John was sure Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t mind if he closed a bit early…
"You okay, love?" he called as Sherlock emerged from the bathroom some minutes later. Sherlock joined him in the kitchen, wrapping his arms around John from behind and laying his head on John's shoulder.
“Love you,” Sherlock said sleepily, before his breathing evened into soft snores. With a sigh, John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and let himself fall asleep.
“You can look now,” Sherlock said softly. John turned again; Sherlock had changed into a pair of sweatpants and an Oxford hoodie that draped his skinny frame, swallowing him so that none of his torso was distinguishable. He looked shy.
“I don’t believe you’re that much of a wuss, John.” Sherlock smirked, a teasing note in his voice, and John couldn’t help but blush.
"Sure," Sherlock nodded, turning around and taking a seat in his desk chair, opening his notebook. "That's fine. Just take your old bedroom."
“Sexually molested Sherlock when he was little,” Lestrade said matter-of-factly. “Mycroft didn’t do anything about it until Sherlock was older, because he didn’t know, but Sherlock’s convinced it was because Mycroft didn’t want to tarnish the family reputation.”
John Watson didn’t mind working in the flower shop. It was a pretty laid back job, and he loved gardening anyway. Sure, it was located right across from the most notorious tattoo shop in town - one rumored to be frequented by gang members and drug addicts - but the front of the tattoo parlor was aesthetically pleasing, and John never really had to interact with any of the shop’s customers or artists.
Sherlock shook his head, putting his feet in the stirrups and leaning his head back. The doctor lifted the gown and did a quick exam.
"Before or after you moved out?" Sherlock barked out a harsh laugh. "Or were you waiting on me to kill myself with drugs so you wouldn't have to tell me anything?"
“Doesn’t mean I can’t be sad.” Sherlock mumbled, his words slurring together. “Doesn’t mean I can’t grieve.”
“I can stand,” John assured him, still blushing. He got to his feet slowly, peeling off his jacket and tying it around his waist to hide the stain. Sherlock smirked at this, his eyes roving over John as he licked his lips.
“They were alright,” Sherlock murmured, glancing almost wistfully at John’s sleeping figure on the couch. “Could have been worse.”
“This isn’t healthy, Sherlock.” John sighed, leaning against the kitchen doorway and watching him. “This isn’t the Sherlock I met a month ago.”
Sherlock became very still, staring first at her and then down into his cup. He was quiet for several long moments.
"So instead you're letting some random man you met at a gay bar pimp you out, even after he let one of his clients give you HIV."
“‘Still’ nothing.” Sherlock kissed him deeply, pressing him up against the wall. “I want you here, John.”
Sherlock moved languidly through 221B, feeling like soft silk in the darkness as he made his way upstairs and into John's room. John was in bed reading a book, glasses perched on his nose, and he looked up inquisitively as Sherlock stepped in.
"Wow," John gasped softly, examining his rib cage in the mirror. The bundle of chrysanthemums, pink with rawness, were beautifully realistic in shades of black and grey. They were incredibly detailed, the petals almost life-like against John's skin.
The party devolved into chatter as Mrs. Hudson finally joined them, then John's mother.  She, too, hugged Sherlock, kissing him warmly on the cheek.
John's eyes fluttered open and, seeing the shadowy figure standing in the doorway of his bedroom, he jumped a bit. Sherlock, silhouetted by the hallway light, stared at him, waiting silently for permission. John moved over, patting the empty space of bed beside him.
"Sherlock," Molly said softly, putting a hand on either of his arms. That only made him sob, choking for air, and with a soft "shh" she led him over to a chair, helping him sit.
But Sherlock’s seizing stopped in three, his body relaxing against the mattress. John held him close, and a few more minutes passed until Sherlock spoke.
Stuffing the letter back into its envelope, he threw the notice back onto the table and strode out of the flat, shutting the door behind him with more force than necessary.
“Your brother,” John pressed, trying to squeeze more information out of Sherlock about his mysterious sibling.
“You’re the first person he’s ever shown interest in,” Lestrade was saying. “He’s actually pretty closed off, believe it or not. Took me years to get him to trust me enough to take him in. And Mycroft? Sherlock hates him with every bone in his body.”
“I’ve got eyes on him at all times.” Mycroft assured him, smiling wryly at his partner. “But sooner or later he’s going to try and get in contact with Sherlock, and I’m afraid once he does, it will send Sherlock on another bender.”
“Would you mind taking him to bed?” Lestrade asked quietly; Sherlock was mumbling to himself, incomprehensible slurring. “I’ve gotta get back to my flat and work on this triple homicide case.”
“It’s fine, John.” Sherlock leaned over, curling up in the fetal position on the couch. “I’m just going to go to sleep.”
“It’s worth it to have seen that look on your face when I took my shirt off.” John settled onto his back. “Did you have any questions?”
John sat back in his chair with a sigh, his head in his hands, before getting up to make some tea. It was going to be a long night.
Sherlock's mouth was now set in a hard thin line and he looked away, sniffing hard with his back straightened. Instead of replying he went to the window, picking up his violin and nestling it in place under his chin. He began to play Silent Night.
Sherlock looked unsurprised at this; he exhaled slowly as he looked at John and then away again. “Did it sustain any significant harm?”
“Yeah,” They came to a halt in front of the diner - Speedy’s. “Anyway, I got the tattoo and then - one night I showed up at the parlor really drunk and shirtless, and they all saw the tattoo, and someone called Lestrade, and - yeah, it’s a nickname now.”
"I could make you come without even touching you, Sherlock," John's voice was deep, sultry, his eyes dark with lust as Sherlock dropped to his knees and nuzzled the crotch of John's trousers with his nose and mouth. John let out a soft moan, hands threading through Sherlock's curls as Sherlock unzipped the trousers and licked at John through his pants, suddenly ravenous for a different kind of breakfast.
“Do I need to send you back to rehab, brother mine?” Mycroft inquired quietly. For the first time, John could see the fear and pain in Sherlock’s bright blue eyes.
This type of sex was different than before. Sherlock's breathless moans were interrupted occasionally by John kissing him; the pace was slow and tender, John's hand wrapped around Sherlock's cock, tugging on it in time with the thrusts. When they both came in unison several minutes later, they lay together afterwards, out of breath and soaking in sweat.
"Do you have a condom and lube?" he asked again, and Sherlock couldn't scramble for them fast enough, turning back over onto his back and spreading his legs eagerly. John laughed a bit, slicked two of his fingers with lube, and then hovered over Sherlock, one hand on the bed beside Sherlock to support himself, the other hand working Sherlock open gently.
“John!” He heard Sherlock’s chirpy voice before he saw him. He approached the cell bars slowly, taking in the sight before him.
“I was bored in bed,” Sherlock murmured, eyes cast to the ceiling. “Unless you want to return to the bedroom and make it more interesting?” He smirked at John.
"I'm not going at all," Sherlock told him, rubbing his uninjured eye with the heel of his hand, then: "James and I already have plans."
“Yes, Sherlock. Your stab wound was bleeding so profusely you lost consciousness.” Mycroft crossed his hands in front of him, observing Sherlock quietly. Sherlock rolled over, squeezing his eyes shut in silent pain as he did so, one hand cradling his abdomen. John realised he was staring and forced himself to look away.
“Fine,” John replied, kissing him on the cheek. “But this means I get to wear your leather jacket when I want.”
"Do it, then," Sherlock murmured, tugging at the hem of John's briefs, tugging them down to his ankles. "Make me come without touching me, John. Make me beg."
“Mm, I think you should earn it.” John murmured, pulling his hand away and relishing in the way Sherlock whined. “After what you did in the diner today.”
"AIDs is going to end up killing me," Sherlock corrected him, his voice quiet. "AIDs and drugs and my own self-will. Let me be, Mycroft. Let it take its course."
Sherlock nuzzled him for a moment before disappearing to the bedroom. John grabbed his mug of tea and his book from the sitting room before joining him. He laid out in bed, Sherlock's head in his lap, his mug on the bedside table, one hand holding his book and the other carding through Sherlock's curls. It wasn't long before Sherlock was asleep, snoring softly into John's abdomen, and John felt domestic bliss.
“I didn’t know how,” Sherlock muttered, staring at the ceiling. “I didn’t know how you would react.”
“May I speak to John alone?” Sherlock said softly. Mycroft nodded once and stood, excusing himself from the room gracefully.
“There was touching, yes.” Sherlock closed his eyes, forcing himself to breathe. “But it didn’t go beyond that.”
"Mary cheated on me," John told Sherlock's stationary figure. Sherlock only continued to stare at him in silence, blinking occasionally. John continued.
Sherlock suddenly wrapped his foster father into a hug, face buried in Lestrade's shoulder for a moment. Lestrade was only surprised for a moment before he masked it and quickly hugged Sherlock back.
“Lestrade told you, didn’t he?” Sherlock muttered, grinding his teeth as he watched the heroin melt.
“Oh geez,” Sherlock sighed dramatically, popping a crisp into his mouth and chewing. “About ten years ago, I was homeless. By choice, really, I had run away from my brother’s house and...yeah. I was at rock bottom, in the throes of my addiction. One night, I was really high, and doing...not so savory things with a drug supplier in an alleyway when Lestrade caught us. He took me to Scotland Yard, called my brother….well, turns out my brother didn’t want me, and he offered Lestrade a sum to look after me for him. Lestrade, more out of the kindness of his heart than anything, agreed. He took me in, fed me, clothed me, helped me get clean, helped me get my first job, and even saw me through to my own place. I still talk to him every now and then.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and climbed off of him, reaching for the needle with one hand and rolling up the sleeve of his hoodie with the other. James watched him, lighting a cigarette.
"Who's Sherrinford?"  John asked, catching Sherlock off guard. Sherlock rolled over again, onto his spine, and stared up at the ceiling.
And before Sherlock could stop him once more, John was taking the stairs two at a time,ignoring Sherlock's protests as he burst into the flat. Sherlock wasn't far behind; the two found James in the kitchen, smirking.
"How much better I could be at fucking you than those other guys, how slow and gentle I could be until it drove you crazy, until I teased and teased you until you begged to be fucked like the whore - "
"I've been having a lot of rough sex with strange men, Molly, don't you think bruises are an aftermath of that?"
John and Sherlock go out on their first date, and subsequently end up discussing their life stories.
"It's not a joke," Sherlock replied before he could stop himself. He took another long pull of liquid courage.
"John, please," Sherlock gasped, closing his eyes as his body convulsed, hips tightening and arching upward as warm relief flooded his jeans. He leaned back against the wall, breathing hard, descending from oblivion slowly and pulling John into focus.
Sherlock slammed his hand on the counter, the force of his motion making him see spots for a moment. "I'm not ashamed. Sex work is valid work, John, no matter your opinion on it."
"Yeah?" John asked. Sherlock sat up a bit and reached over him, lighting a cigarette from the pack on the bedside table. "I'm sorry she asked about your parents."
“John?” Sherlock murmured, a mischievous glint in his eye, his foot stroking John through his trousers. John gasped, drawing closer and closer to the edge until - yes, warmth flooded the inside of his trousers, his hands shaking as his eyelids fluttered. Sherlock withdrew his foot with a wide smirk, taking a drink from his coffee.
"We weren't - " John fumbled, obviously caught off guard. That made Sherlock smirk to himself, and with a feeling of triumph, he allowed himself to order a bottle of vodka from the bartender next, content to sit there and sip on it for a good while. "We weren't - we weren't talking about you, Sherlock."
“How’s work been so far?” John asked, then gestured to the bandage on Sherlock’s arm. “I see you’ve gotten a new tattoo.” Sherlock’s arms were already covered in tattoos, anyway, and John wondered how he even found room for a new one.
"He's not gonna know," Sherlock assured him, anger bubbling in his chest. Why did John have to ruin everything? He held out the wad once more. "C'mon, Seb. Please - I - I need this."
“I have a shirt, upstairs.” Sherlock murmured, not meeting John’s gaze. He stood hurriedly and made his way towards the stairs. John followed.
“Thirty minutes from now,” Sherlock said absently, all of his attention focused intently on finishing the drawing in front of him. John watched him for a moment in admiration, then pulled his textbook from his bag and began on his homework, keeping himself to one corner of the desk. They worked in silence for a little while, each of them lost in their respective work.
John let himself into the flower shop after lunch, book in hand, and took his seat behind the counter once more. Across the street, through the windows of their respective shops,  he and Sherlock made eye contact. John was reminded of the startling eyes that captivated him to begin with. Oh, the places he and Sherlock had been in just a few short months.
“Yes.” He strode to the door, slipping on his boots and pulling on his leather jacket. “I just need to be alone for a little while, John. Don’t wait up.” And with that, he disappeared down the stairs.
“What’s a vanilla bloke like you doing in this part of town?” The teen exhaled smoke slowly, his smirk only widening as he sexed John up with his eyes. John rolled his own, shaking his head.
He ran his hands over his face once before turning away, striding to the window and opening it noiselessly. He slipped through the window, once again cat-like, his feet landing silently on the grass before he straightened and put his hood up, striding across the garden with ease in the night.
“He’s getting released soon,” Sherlock’s voice was quiet as he pulled the smack into the syringe, tying the torniquete around his skinny arm. “He’s got connections, people he can pay off to get out of prison.” Finding a good vein - and John wondered how, with all the track marks littering the inside of Sherlock’s arm - he slid the needle in with practiced ease and leaned his head back as he injected it, pupils going wide with euphoria.
Tomorrow he’d meet with Sarah at the surgery, touch base with Harry. He hadn’t forgotten how he’d felt in the cab before realizing he was being kidnapped, just pushed those concerns aside in the rush of everything else. He’d need to re-examine those thoughts again soon, but not tonight.
Taking Sherlock’s chin in hand, he leaned down and kissed the bruise. When he drew back his cheeks had gone slightly pink. Sherlock smiled at him, utterly charmed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Something personal, or Donovan would have known about it. He considered what he knew of the DI’s bad habits—a predilection for eating poorly and consuming too much caffeine as a consequence of his job—before deciding on the most likely out-of-character behavior to trigger this reaction. A mundane one-night stand wouldn’t elicit this level of shame. What sexual impropriety had Lestrade committed since they’d last seen each other he felt the need to conceal from Sherlock?
“It’s right at your hairline,” John insisted, already rooting around in his medical kit. “You’re sure to bump it if it’s not covered.”
Sherlock heard the downstairs door close and tensed before forcibly relaxing. The heat had just reached the point where it changed from a-little-too-hot to
Whatever busybody business for which Mycroft had come calling clearly made him uncomfortable. He waited nearly a full thirty seconds standing in the doorway to the sitting room after saying Sherlock’s name at a normal volume before raising his voice to be heard over the hum of the hair dryer. For him to lose his temper even to that degree over imparting news that distressed him was incredibly telling. Not government business then. Sherlock was even more inclined to ignore him, but considering the likeliest source of Mycroft’s information it would be prudent to get it over with as soon as possible.
John was over the moon, adrenaline singing a familiar and much-missed siren song in his blood, up until Sherlock told him they were going to his flat and, more ominously, that he had “a point to make.”
Sherlock shook his head and accepted the wallet, still trying to identify what was odd about the situation as he looked over the contents.
“Okay, you’re done. Try not to get the gauze caught on anything, yeah? I don’t want to have to rewrap it before I change the dressing.”
“Though I suppose I shouldn’t complain when you willingly let me do this without making a fuss. Maybe bees aren’t the only thing that make you cooperative.”
Before she could spook John further Sherlock stepped forward to take advantage of her current sentimentality. Mrs. Hudson practically flew into his arms.
John raised his eyebrows, actually tempted. Nosy sister that she was, Harry had been pestering him about his potential bisexuality for years. For Harry, who never liked to be wrong if she could help it, to actually offer to let something go for once without a fight was unprecedented. But reality reasserted itself again and he shook his head.
Sherlock’s hand on his back evoked mixed emotions. It was strange and different to be the recipient of the gesture instead of the source, but for a proprietary gesture it was far less smothering than having had girlfriends drape themselves over him in the past. John had only a few seconds to examine his response before being introduced to Sherlock’s landlady, an older woman who treated Sherlock with all the affectionate aplomb of a mother on the occasion of her son’s first date.
“But you can’t wear this about like a scarf. It’s nearly a kilogram, Sherlock.” John hefted it in his hands as if to demonstrate its weight. “You’re going to strain your neck wearing it out of the flat like that.”
The more he considered it, Mostan’s involvement actually worked in his favor. People attributed all variety of idealized emotional twaddle to former lovers with no basis in reality to easily refute. John was already inclined to favor him after the cabbie, but solving a case together would make obvious the difference between the reality of Sherlock’s brilliance and whatever ill-fated fantasies John had once nursed about Morstan.
With slow, methodical movements he eased the fabric down Sherlock’s arms, taking care not to brush against the raw skin of his forearms.
“The money was to take care of his children, I expect. He’s sick with something, a chronic condition, perhaps terminal. That’s why he was willing to gamble with his life.”
“Right this way, Mister. And lemme ‘ave your mobile while you’re at it. I won’t be making that mistake again.”
He hesitated at the identical buildings, but chose one and hurried over, peering to examine the door handle in the scant light. There was a glint of skin oils on the metal, fresh enough to indicate recent passage and consistent with his working theory that John was likely being coerced at gunpoint, which would place him in front of his kidnapper. Unfortunately, there was no easy way to find the exact room in the absence of any recent rains or John having trod in any recognizable sediment during their evening together. Sherlock backtracked to the stairs when he heard the sound of a cleaning trolley at the end of the hall, ascending a floor and peering into every lit classroom he passed.
Beyond John’s shoulder Sherlock saw Mycroft emerge from his car. He caught Sherlock’s eye and raised an imperious eyebrow. It was one thing for Mycroft to manipulate Sherlock’s internet search results. It was another for him to threaten his heavy-handed nosiness in person.
“And for Anderson,” Sherlock intoned with great drama, “several hours locked in a room with the relaxing sounds of whales and the rainforest.”
Ah, yes, John’s email trash folder held a confirmation of shipment for the honey dated from the beginning of the week. That John had hidden his guilt over feeding Sherlock a new brand of honey without telling him beneath his misgivings over not inviting Sherlock out seemed uncharacteristically disingenuous of him. On the other hand, Sherlock himself was guilty of having secretly fed John things that might be considered by some less innocent than expensive, locally-sourced raw honey.
Sherlock didn’t bother dignifying that with a response, letting his body go limp to slump back against the sofa cushions.
, no pretending or going in halfway. I’ll give you ten days, long enough for at least two dinner dates and maybe a lunch date. Your shortest relationship ever was Violet Smith and that was eight days, so you can’t say I’m being unreasonable. Especially because you usually wait until the third date before having sex.”
in Mr. Right, you’ll be able to tell me I was wrong and that you’re one-hundred-percent straight. And I’ll let it go. I’ll never bother you about your sexuality again.”
With practiced ease Sherlock tuned him out. Inside the box was the printed inventory receipt, the amount and billing information carefully blacked out by John with a marker. There was also a little laminated card from a company called “Bee Healthy” with instructions which Sherlock skimmed quickly.
Hope was gasping for air. Spittle flecked Sherlock’s face, but he didn’t care, only tightened his grip.
2) I'm also not an expert in Chinese calligraphy or Chinese art of any kind, and beg the pardon of any thus-inclined readers for any mistakes you see is this and the next chapter.
There was something wrong with the gun. The streetlights flashing through the window made getting a clear look difficult, but- The way the man held it was wrong. There wasn’t enough tension in his wrist to support its weight, grip too loose, no accounting for recoil. John strained his eyes, forcing himself to focus each time light flashed through the cab. Shadows didn’t fall the right way over the surface; lines were missing where there should have been space, and several of what should have been moving parts looked fused to the gun.
“Sherlock is a lovely young man,” she beamed. “He helped me out of a spot of trouble with my late husband. I’m so pleased to see him finally bringing home a date.”
Instead of trying to talk over Harry’s second-guessing John opened up the address book on his mobile to scroll for his newest contact. Sherlock Holmes’ name was there, just as he’d entered it, with both the number and email address fields filled in. It was the last thing John needed to finally shake himself out of his daze. That
Even through the thick wool of his coat John could feel his warmth, the solidity of his muscles. John might have completely missed the presence of the police cars if Sherlock hadn’t drawn attention to them, and he was hardly any more coherent when his forgotten cane made a surprising reappearance.
“Now where would be the fun in that? One’s safe and the other isn’t. You pick one and I’ll take the other.”
Sherlock turned onto Baker Street and stopped, John running into his back with a small gasp before jerking away. He narrowed his eyes at the police cars parked across from 221, part of his attention on John’s recoil.
Instead of the boxes of generically flesh-toned plasters normally found in the kit he pulled out a box decorated with—
“Yes- Sir William’s office. The bank’s Chairman. He’s on vacation in Cebu, or he’d have had an unpleasant shock yesterday morning.”
He carefully pulled the piece of glass out with the tweezers in the medical kit John kept in the bathroom, rinsing the wound out and cleaning it thoroughly. Once cleaned he could see that it wasn’t a deep cut, but the blood still leaking sluggishly from it had Sherlock reaching for a box of sticking plasters.
He’d been dumped before, and probably because of the work he did with the police judging by their incredulity at the appearance of someone who Sherlock called friend. With that thought came another, even worse. Sherlock
Thankfully John’s reassurance worked and Galbraith gave them a general date range and a list of names to investigate before getting sidetracked again about his colleague. Sherlock took the proffered information and let John handle the rest of the conversation—something about teapots that had John making sympathetic noises.
John made a noise part disbelieving scoff, part amused snort and started undoing Sherlock’s shirt buttons.
John gaped, his lips silently forming Sherlock’s words as if sounding out a foreign language instead of plain English.
“Not sure, but whoever did it chose that location on purpose. Three hundred people on the trading floor and very few of them could see it.”
John was blushing and wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock glared at Angelo. He’d hoped the point with the cane would have been enough to overcome
men, it’s true, but every so often… There was the one boy in secondary, Toby, who you were utterly mad for until his family moved away at the end of  the term. And I’m
Sherlock’s choice of venue was a cafe, inexpensive and casual but not a chain, and nobody looked twice at him or offered a candle, which was a relief to John’s nerves. He’d timed it better, or maybe Sherlock had anticipated him, because the other man swept in just as his tea was delivered.
In the silence Sherlock looked at him. John appeared neither disgusted nor upset, and his hand—the same one he’d used to take Hope’s nonexistent pulse—was steady.
“Sherlock,” John called from the kitchen doorway, “we’re almost out of honey. Should I order more, or do you want a different kind? Or,” his voice became hesitant and Sherlock looked up from checking his email, “I don’t have to if you’re tired of it. You like cane sugar. Should I get that instead?”
Two conflicting voices took up residence in his head. One of them insisted that it was early, but if Sherlock wanted to declare an end to the evening John could well walk him home. The other adamantly did not want the night to be over, wanted the chase to go on so he could keep feeling this way. They were in agreement on one thing. It had been a bloody amazing date, but it might be the only one he ever had if Sherlock invited him up for coffee and John said no because he wasn’t ready.
It may not seem like it, what with the computer screen in the way, but your encouragement really does mean a lot to me and kept me struggling to finish this chapter despite real life constantly making things difficult.
By the end of her list John’s face was a dull red, and though he told himself it was from anger, he couldn’t deny that Harry wasn’t at least a
capable of noticing when she’d done something wrong and changing her behavior to suit, though it was a lengthy process.
Much like John himself, his technique was firm and determined, seeking out and locating all the tender spots Sherlock hadn’t even known existed, steadily wearing away at them with rhythmic motions from his hands and fingers. He found a knot and pressed into it, pressed and held, and Sherlock’s hiss of pain turned into a moan of pleasure. He tried to stifle the sounds, but gave up when they were ripped from his throat every time John worked a kink out of his muscles.
Harry rolled her eyes. “The same thing you do with a woman, only with a man? For Christ’s sake, you went to
And he strode off before John could say anything. He nodded a tight farewell, not about to tell Arthur they’d never discussed this before because John
John, unobservant though he was, noticed the jar of honey sitting on the table the moment he stepped into the kitchen. Sherlock, mostly concentrating on his experiment, took note of his expression. Surprise, chagrin, happiness, and a touch of nerves all flickered their way over his face until his features settled into cautious pleasure.
John returned with Sherlock’s mobile in hand, but as he had done earlier the instant Sherlock reached out to claim it John pulled it out of reach.
The coffee survived the rest of the trip to Bart’s where Molly was more than amenable to loaning Sherlock her phone and promising to set aside a nice forearm for him in future. It occurred to Sherlock as he was texting Jennifer Wilson’s number that Molly would have been a good candidate to “date”—her starstruck crush covering any multitude of sins when he inevitably slipped—but he didn’t want to sacrifice their current relationship in the fallout. It was useful to have a friend in Bart’s morgue, generally and for his role at the Yard. He’d still have that after “breaking up” with Molly, but it would be tediously awkward and Molly was bad enough already.
“Anyway it was just a feeling, you know? I didn’t pursue it and I’ll probably never even see her again.”
The way his lips kept fighting a smile was off-putting. Sherlock swept away, pleased when Sally shot him a typically vitriolic glare, gave John one last parting comment, and scarpered off to pretend she wasn’t eavesdropping. John, to Sherlock’s relief, barely acknowledged her, greeting Sherlock’s arrival with a small smile that told him John hadn’t listed to a word she’d said.
Emboldened by his desire to thumb his nose at Sally’s disapproval, Sherlock leaned forward and brushed the orange blanket from John’s shoulders. John looked up at him in surprise, but didn’t pull away, the tip of his tongue flicking over his lips as Sherlock straightened.
Sherlock circled Morstan’s desk to examine the contents. A ceramic cat painted by an unsteady hand, and a pair of framed photographs. One of Morstan and his deceased wife with their very young daughter, the other of the girl several years later—taken within the past six months based on the frame and lack of fading—in a garish pink dress with clashing costume jewelry. His papers were disorganized, but there wasn’t a hint of dust anywhere, including the thriving plants by the windows. Morstan’s watch was expensive and flashy, his clothing older, tie and jacket rumpled. Incautious with money in his youth, he’d learned care for his possessions only recently. Gambling, if Sherlock had to guess, which explained John’s former attraction to a man who was now the epitome of responsible single fatherhood.
“Would you though? You hate sitting still for anything that doesn’t keep your brain busy. I didn’t think ‘for your health’ would be a good enough reason until I saw how much you liked your heat pack.”
He stared at the other man, face unreadable, before spinning to plant his hands on John’s shoulders.
sounded pained, “according to Mummy work relationships do not count. At least not work relationships as you conduct them.”
“Exactly. My hypothesis was two-fold. First, that you notice fluctuations in my health much more quickly than even concerns of a more practical nature, such as when you’re about to run out of pants.” He ignored another sputtered exclamation from John. “And second, that my own reaction to your attention is skewed in your favor.”
“Several times now you’ve expressed a belief that my interest in bees made me accept your gifts, that it makes me more cooperative in accepting treatment. But you’re wrong—”
Sherlock muttered a vague assurance that had John turning away in satisfaction to repack his kit, and went to his bedroom to change into a t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He could still feel the warmth and the light pressure of John’s thumb smoothing the ends of the plaster against his skin, even though the contact hadn’t lasted longer than a few seconds.
John replayed Angelo’s and Mrs. Hudson’s reactions to his presence and compared them to the obvious skepticism of Sherlock’s colleagues from the Met. They’d been enthusiastic but equally skeptical in their own way, acting as if Sherlock on a date was a rare occurrence. Suddenly John had an answer for why a bloke who looked and spoke like Sherlock Holmes might want to go out with him.
“Your benefactor. He’s the one who got you this job, isn’t he? You’re grateful to him—it isn’t easy living in London as a single father of a young child—and eager to have this solved before he returns.”
Mycroft and his bloated ego appeared, and settled a hand on John’s back. Mycroft’s smirk grew disgustingly smug, but he took the hint and turned towards where Lestrade was standing. He also had the pleasure of seeing Sally’s mouth fall open in disbelief, too shocked to affect inattention.
“None of the victims realized.” John scowled and set the disguised lighter on a desk. “Sorry for that, earlier. I didn’t know it was you, and he said he had an accomplice. I thought I might be able to buy some time bluffing.”
“John, are you-” Sherlock looked over John’s body, but couldn’t find any sign of violence to explain how he’d seized the gun.
“There’s been a number of studies done lately on the wound healing properties of New Zealand Manuka honey. It’s also an effective first-aid treatment for burns.”
“I shall take my leave now,” Mycroft said, rudely interrupting Sherlock’s plotting. “Mummy has granted you a ten-day grace period. If your behavior has not changed by the end of that time, I will lock your account.”
His optimism lasted up until he arrived at the restaurant, was personally greeted by the owner who’d been prompted to recognize him on sight, and seated at a table by the window with a candle “to make it more romantic.”
“This is where De Kleine made his drops—easy enough when the Chinese restaurant next door has no visible address. No one would expect a frequent visitor to Hong Kong here, but he could be homesick and peckish. The shopkeeper is hiding something—”
“It’s a microwavable heat pack.” John beamed, looking more puffed up than ever. “It’s filled with barley, but this cover part is washable. You can also put it in the freezer for use as a cold pack.”
“He always takes them to empty buildings, but there are far too many vacant construction sites and poorly-guarded offices in London to predict where he will go. Best catch him, dear brother. I shudder to think what will happen to the unfortunate Doctor Watson if you don’t.”
, there—there he was, sitting at a table in the back with another similar blond head. Frustratingly the other person's back had been to Sherlock the entire time, sitting behind another patron at such an angle that he'd not even glimpsed a hint at a profile or what the probable sibling had been wearing.
“Confessed to everything,” John said, nodding at the unconscious man. “He said it was a game. Two pills and he’d take whichever one they didn’t, but I bet he had it rigged somehow. Their choice was to take a pill or he’d shoot them. ”
Sherlock jabbed at the keypad on the microwave before stalking down the hallway to his bedroom, ignoring John who had recovered enough to start asking questions.
Maybe he could transfer the honey he’d removed from the jar into a portable container. The tiny to-go packets generally on offer were too cloyingly sweet after the rich flavor of John’s local honey.
Soldier and doctor. Protective instincts. An alcoholic brother with a ruined marriage. Accepted a push to question his sexuality partly to promote sibling harmony. This man, if approached correctly, would be overwhelmingly loyal. What could Sherlock do to take advantage of this nature? Brilliance, danger- John was attracted to Sherlock’s genius, appreciated his Work. He would continue their relationship as long as Sherlock supplied his adrenaline fix.
He thrust his burden into John’s hands and yanked John’s jumper up. John jumped, but didn’t try to stop Sherlock from pressing a gentle kiss to his already-purpling skin.
Two days was an extremely fast observational time, especially for John who never seemed to notice when Sherlock followed him and still routinely overlooked some of the most obvious clues at crime scenes. Of course, even John couldn’t fail to miss the bright yellow heat pack Sherlock had been wearing about their flat, and it didn’t take a doctor of John’s skills to deduce why Sherlock might need it. But John’s immediate reaction on discovering Sherlock’s health complaint was to offer a better solution.
“It was the building manager, of course.” Instantly all attention in the room turned to him. “But he’s being blackmailed by the owner to conduct the arson as a ransom scheme. There’s something in these properties he doesn’t want found and he needed a fall man to take the suspicion away from himself. He’s been nervous about this from the start, and rightly so, but his desire to move to St. Croix has nothing to do with the stress of the situation and everything to do with wanting to get out of the country to enjoy his illicit millions.
“And your takeaway,” he added, offering John a hand up. “After all the effort Angelo made bringing it to you.”
He anticipated the question John was trying hardest not to ask, stretching his right hand out in demonstration.
But the nervousness, the stumbling initial approach, the obvious arousal, and what Sherlock could now identify as an unconscious height comparison all came together instantly.
There was a brief silence during which he knew Mycroft was staring in horrified fixation at the garish fabric and attempting to determine if or when he’d somehow gone wrong to lead Sherlock into such an ill-advised fashion decision.
wouldn’t think to buy any of what you’ve given me for myself. The only reason they have the chance to work is because
Nobody answered when they buzzed Jonathan De Kleine’s flat, prompting Sherlock to trick a new resident into letting them in with a surprising show of affability. John thought about it as he waited at the door of the flat. That Sherlock could act wasn’t strange—the man had his own spy network and was in the business of uncovering other people’s secrets, acting was par for the course. But watching him pretend to be cheerful only made John realize how different he really was.
Sherlock beamed in return and couldn’t help the way his eyes traced the expression on John’s lips. He looked up, about to tell Lestrade that they’d come back to finish his tiresome paperwork once John was properly rested, and found the DI staring at him, handset halfway to his ear and one hand on the dial pad, both eyebrows up at his hairline.
Pompous, over-inflated Mycroft trying to be helpful, as per usual. Sherlock flipped off the nearest CCTV camera when he arrived at Baker Street and spent his first half hour at home typing things like “is it rude to eat your date’s meal as well as your own” into Google before his temper cooled.
“Sorry, Mister.” He was still smiling, no change at all to the expression. “If I can’t ‘ave ‘olmes, I’ll ‘ave to settle for you. Nothing personal, but I’ve a quota to fill.”
“Everything’s on the house,” Sherlock announced glibly. “I cleared his name of murder; Angelo won’t charge me a penny.”
“Apologies. I judged you the type to arrive early, but was delayed. You didn’t accept Angelo’s offer of wine while you were waiting? You needn’t have worried. He has an excellent selection.”
“Give me a fake number?” He shrugged and took back his mobile to show Harry the email address. “But why go to the effort of giving me an email if it’s fake?”
“John,” he started as soon as he heard the scuff of John’s shoes on the floor beside him, “cause of death is asphyxiation. Obvious. The lack of a struggle could mean poison, but the evidence points in favor of toxic carbon monoxide inhalation. Thoughts?”
Sherlock’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. John hurriedly reached for his tea and burnt his tongue. The waiter was still hovering, awkward at the shift in mood, and John placed his order anxious to save the conversation.
John had shown interest in his casework, despite the frequently violent and gruesome aspects. An army doctor could hardly be squeamish, of course, but John's enthusiasm went beyond that.
John licked his lips. “Do you mean… You think that’s him? The murderer?” His eyes darted briefly sideways, but he never looked away from Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock bellowed for John several times before it occurred to him that his flatmate and blogger wasn’t home, whereupon he began bellowing for Mrs. Hudson instead. After an unknown period of time during which a mug of tea did not suddenly appear at his elbow, Sherlock tore himself away from his slides with a huff of annoyance at the inconvenience and went to make the tea himself.
His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden laugh. John was looking at him, something that could only be delight dancing in his eyes.
The murderous cabbie was on the ground, a growing bruise on his jaw evidence of how John had incapacitated him. John’s mobile and an unfamiliar wallet lay on the floor beside him. His legs were tied with scraps of John’s vest, as evidenced by the scattered remains of fabric. John had been in the process of restraining the murderer when he’d heard Sherlock’s running footsteps.
The shop they located was disarmingly filled with kitschy souvenirs, but he didn’t miss how the shopkeeper placed herself in front of the back room when they came in. He was pretending to inspect a row of lucky cats while he formulated a plan when he ran into a motionless John, staring in rapt concentration at a cheap wall scroll.
And to Sherlock's delight, John followed him willingly, cane and limp abandoned at the table with the remnants of their meal. He re-evaluated his estimation of Doctor Watson as a faux-partner while they chased the cab through winding London streets and up, over, and across rooftops. Perhaps the Internet was right and there was something to the “get-to-know-you” aspect of the First Date. The discovery that there might be more to John that initially observed made the failure of his lead more bearable.
“That’s not ‘ow this game is played.” The cabbie waggled his gun chidingly. “But I suppose you ‘eard all about it from Mr. ‘olmes, did you? Well, I’ll tell you, since you won’t live to tell
Poison taken at gunpoint; likely a coward unused or unwilling to actually shoot his firearm. Current position as driver and one-handed grip suggested distraction; he’d need to be very skilled to hit John from his position in the front seat and through the divider screen. They weren’t travelling very fast and the kerb was immediately to John’s left; the chances of surviving if he threw himself out right now were high.
“Didn’t think you looked smart enough to be ‘olmes, but you were with ‘im earlier and I thought maybe that was a trick, y’see? Using someone else as cover would be clever, and I was warned ‘olmes would be clever.”
“I have been informed,” Mycroft said, forming the syllables in his mouth with infinite care, “of the logical fallacy of this belief. Mummy was displeased at my having shared it with you.”
With a sudden lunge that put him within arm's length of the cabbie, he knocked both bottles hurtling from the table.
a four if there was legwork involved. John would see him solve a case, possibly run down a criminal. Perfect.
He knew he’d said the right thing when John smiled and the familiar creases reappeared in the corner of his eyes. John gently moved his wrist out of Sherlock’s grip and turned his hand until the mobile rested cradled between both of their palms. Sherlock tightened his fingers to accept it and John folded his hand over top and squeezed before releasing.
“But, Sherlock, that doesn’t actually—” John attempted to force a laugh. The sound became trapped in his throat. “You of all people should know how unhygienic that is.”
John laid a palm flat in the middle of Sherlock’s back and abruptly pushed straight down, pinning Sherlock to the sofa just enough to make him feel a little squashed, but not enough to truly obstruct his breathing.
“Fine with me. Getting you to sit still for at least this much is an achievement. I guess I’ll just have to work on how much of a tosser you are then.”
“No. He was skimming too much off the top, or taking jobs on the side, haven’t figured out which yet. His colleagues were displeased, but whoever they hired for the job botched it; you can’t get information from a corpse.”
His other "relationships," if the term could be applied, were hardly better though he'd avoided sending anyone else to prison by simply not getting involved with criminals. The first and only time he'd tried for something more than a mutually beneficial arrangement had ended when it became clear that dating and drugs were incompatible and Sherlock had chosen the cocaine.
"That'll work well: 'Hey, would you mind not gutting my friend? Yeah, the ruddy tall bloke with the cheekbones trying to stop your dastardly plans. He's kind of a tit but if you leave him alone I'll give you a back rub.'"
1) Sorry for any anti-Mystrade readers out there. I considered other options, but the instant I thought up the "I get you in the divorce" line decided me that this was the pairing best suited to turning Mycroft into the Holmesian equivalent of the weepy best friend from the movie.
I went over my movie transcript in case there was anything usable for the outline and... I'd just like to thank anyone who's made it this far for not seeing a godawful movie like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days in the tags and running immediately in the opposite direction.
John immediately started trotting after him. His easy acquiescence compared to the amount of badgering he’d have had to endure from any member of NSY to reach this point was refreshing.
Sherlock waved his bee-adorned hand in John’s face and frowned when he only rolled his eyes and reclaimed Sherlock’s hand.
Harry had to pick the poshest bloke in the place, looking like a runway model as he stood at the counter waiting for his order. John grimaced and turned back to tell Harry that a woman who dressed like that was out of his league, much less a man, but she was staring at him with a skeptical expression straight out of his childhood. As if there hadn’t been enough deja vu in the conversation already, it was the exact face she’d always used when she thought John was being particularly stupid and, bloody hell, he could already feel his jaw tensing as he rose to the challenge.
The Chinese art specialist at the National Antiquities Museum was gratifyingly eager to see them, though Sherlock had to suffer through small talk about the man’s workplace crush before he could get a word in edgewise.
For one disconcerting second Sherlock had no idea what was going on, but then he looked away from John’s concerned expression and the details fell into place.
Sherlock shifted and John caught the flash of pale eyes in his direction before he drew himself up, tall and impossibly elegant.
“Oh, and you might want to do something about that before your friends at the Met become concerned.”
“John. You haven’t ordered yet. You needn’t wait for me, I’m not eating.” He shook his head at the waiter waiting for his drink order.
“Saying it’s a ‘campaign’ makes it sound like this was some sort of war I waged against you. It’s not like that.”
“Right. Thanks.” There wasn’t any socially acceptable way to say he’d done it for the adrenaline without coming off touched in the head, so he didn’t bother. “About the Chairman giving him the job- How did you know?”
They got in a fight when she tried to explain how to make the posts accessible to specific IP addresses, and John finished his dinner guiltily relieved at the return to the sibling status quo after the past few days of harmony. Harry called back before he could decide if he was a bad brother or not, confessed that she’d left a meeting and spent forty minutes pacing outside a pub in apology, and John gave her his password in return. The evening passed with assurances that no, he wasn’t hurt, nobody had been shot, he wasn’t in trouble with the police, and actually it had been brilliant. When he finally mentioned his second date it was time for bed, saving him from further criticism of his dating attire.
There was also a high chance he was reading too much into John’s actions considering his own past behavior. It was unlikely John’s personality had undergone such a shift that he was now experimenting on Sherlock for mysterious reasons. Probably John’s strange guilt over giving Sherlock a present without informing him of such was another consequence of his irrational hangups regarding gift-giving.
“I know in the past you’ve considered me a challenge for finding ‘the perfect gift,’ but if I’d known it would launch you on this single-minded campaign, I might have rethought accepting your birthday present.”
“Couldn’t find any with that fabric. Bedding and novelty ties, yes, but not much else, and believe me I looked. I even thought about getting one custom-made, but that seemed a little morbid considering you’re meant to use it when hurt and we’ve more than enough anatomically correct human bits in the flat already.”
Sherlock snorted in surprise, unable to hide the way the corners of his mouth turned up at John’s awful pun.
Sherlock paused, went back over the path of deductions he’d followed to reach that point. It was a likely solution, but he’d need to run tests to be certain, as it was useless to theorize without all the data.
Sherlock fought to keep the annoyance from his face, only mildly pleased at the attention being paid to his plum shirt. The praise John had voiced at their meeting had been satisfactory, but the rest of the conversation lacking. This relationship would grow boring quickly if John Watson was only capable of gaping or babbling confused questions in return to everything Sherlock said. One would think a doctor who’d worked in Afghanistan might have a bit more steel to his spine.
Harry stared at him, expression a likely female mirror of his own, before seizing his hand and grinning.
“Widower. Wedding band on his right where he can see it rather than on a chain suggests it was recent but not more than a decade. Daughter was statistically more likely from the attempt at flowers on the ceramic cat desk ornament, confirmed from the pictures.”
John’s usefulness was short-lived, but not a total waste. Sherlock’s operating theory that the message worked as a code primarily because of its placement and who the target audience was didn’t preclude it having individual meaning. Considering the effort undertaken to infiltrate the bank it made sense for there to be personal significance to the graffiti.
For Mycroft to be as nervous as he was spelled ill for Sherlock. When Mummy put her foot down the results were terrifying, but it was Father’s support of the scheme that most worried Sherlock. With the two of them as a united front, there was little choice but to obey. No attempt at wheedling or whinging would compel them to change their minds. They would cut off access to his account, and Sherlock didn’t need to run the figures through his head to know that the current frequency of his consulting was insufficient to fully support his lifestyle.
The books from De Kleine’s flat were waiting at Baker Street when they arrived. Sherlock, doubting that John was versed in even the basics of Mandarin, gave him a list of keywords to look for and left him to it. It was unlikely he’d find anything, but John had pleasantly surprised him before. There was always a chance John helped spark a connection in Sherlock’s vastly superior intellect, and it saved him the effort of going through the books himself.
. I know you can pull a man if you actually try. Here-” She started scanning the other patrons of the cafe around them, obviously looking for a likely mark.
Sherlock bent to examine the unconscious cabbie, looking him over carefully before voicing his conclusion.
Blackmail might have earned him points in their usual brotherly battle of one-upmanship, but with the rules of this game having been set by their parents Sherlock had limited options available to him. He could either find some loophole in Mummy’s edict that Mycroft had yet to discover—unlikely. Or—and Sherlock couldn’t believe how desperate he had to be to even consider this—he would have to succeed above and beyond anything Mycroft was capable of.
“I’m not sure how you tested that, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you did. If you like it when I take care of you, why do you make such a fuss about it?”
Sherlock waited impatiently for the microwave to finish, watching the yellow pack rotate on the internal turntable. John didn’t say anything during that time, but Sherlock knew he was paying attention from the desultory rate at which he turned the pages of his book.
“John.” Sherlock cleared his throat, unexpectedly formal after ranting that utility workers were useless because their poor customer satisfaction reviews attracted too much attention. “Would you like to accompany me on a case?”
“Good,” she said, staring into her coffee cup rather than look at him. “I may have- Well, actually. I’m—I met someone.”
had been in the most danger. Then, an inquiry about the police, repeated out of desire to see the cabbie handed over to the proper authorities.
The way Mycroft pronounced the word “you” immediately caught Sherlock’s attention. Deductions flashed quickly through his mind: Mycroft’s discomfort in sharing this news when he was usually so fond of meddling in Sherlock’s life. The frequency and sincerity in which his lesser emotions, normally suppressed with a dictatorial hand, had risen to the surface over the course of his visit.
Christ, what a disaster. He was tempted to leave, but the damage had been done. Except when he tried to give John an out as he had with the Met John surprised him by clenching his jaw and spitting the word “friend” with a vehemence that implied anything but and dared Morstan to comment.
Sherlock felt a familiar thrill in his stomach and the buzz of satisfaction at being able to get John, exhausted though he was, to smile, and resisted the urge to grin himself. Pleased with yet another confirmation of his hypothesis, Sherlock looked up ready to give the answer he’d deduced while waiting for John to return, and found Lestrade glancing between them with narrow-eyed suspicion. That was unacceptable. He didn’t need Gareth saying something to John and mucking up Sherlock’s experiment before he’d finished.
” Her tone this time was closer to fourteen-year-old Harry than mid-forties-year-old Harry. Several of the people nearby glanced at them and John fought not to blush.
In the sitting room he was interrupted by Mrs. Hudson’s familiar greeting and the appearance of the woman herself, preceded by a loaded tea tray.
“I’ll put you out of a job,” John warned, trying to sound serious and failing when he laughed mid-word and had to restart. “No more locked-room mysteries for you.”
Sherlock turned his head to keep the street in his peripheral vision and picked up the small tube of what turned out to be lip balm branded with the name of the same company from which John had ordered his heat pack.
John was beside him suddenly, both hands prying Hope’s jaws apart as if he could reach in and pull the poison capsule out, but there was no
Several hours later Sherlock awoke on the sofa. John had removed his shoes and covered him with a blanket, but left the half-drunk tea and the barely-touched toast, which Sherlock appreciated because it allowed him to estimate the time that had passed by the congealed butter on the bread. Alongside the plate and mug sat the bee-emblazoned heat pack. It was cold to the touch when Sherlock reached out to pick it up.
Sherlock reached into his dressing gown pocket and found the tube of beeswax lip balm. He applied a thin coat to his mouth, relishing the spread of it as he pressed his lips together, and smiled.
In this case not saying anything turned out to be the correct response. Harry smiled ruefully and started playing with her empty cup.
John sighed and sat down on a table. In the ensuing silence Sherlock went over the case in his mind, charting its progression before his involvement, and then including the point John entered the picture. What was it? The picture on the taxi’s dashboard, the contents of the wallet- Why did he feel as if there was a loose end somewhere? An accomplice- a
“Detective Inspector Gary Lestrade.” He ignored Lestrade’s automatic correction. “My liaison at New Scotland Yard.”
“Why bother?” A taxi pulled up before his arm was completely raised. “I asked the secretary for his address.”
drive him off with doubts about the physical aspects of a homosexual relationship once he’d served his purpose.
“Because the killer wanted it to look like suicide! Right-handed victim, wound on the left side. Or would you bother using your left hand if you finally decided to spare me and the rest of the world your existence?”
Even though he was expecting it, he felt instantly bereft when John removed the heat pack from his shoulders. It had still been quite comfortably warm and Sherlock was thinking absently of microwaving it again later until the moment John’s hands settled on his back. The first touch was light and testing, smoothing up and down over the fabric of his dressing gown in soothing circles. John started rubbing in confident, methodical strokes that had Sherlock sighing and relaxing further into the cushions.
On pressing his memory, he could recall John giving him tea with a vaguely guilty air a few days ago. Considering that John persisted in thinking Sherlock could take one look at his face and know every one of his sins from the past two weeks—which was often true but frequently took several seconds of focused observation to ascertain the exact details of John’s perceived misdemeanors, longer than what could be gleaned in one disinterested glance—John was frequently vaguely guilty over everything from hoping Sherlock wouldn’t deduce the contents of his internet history from the bags under his eyes, to his regret over being in a bad mood and not holding the door for the person behind him at Tesco’s.
Conscious that he was the hanger-on for what was Sherlock’s actual job, John fell into step behind the detective and didn’t see the person—presumably Sherlock’s client—until the door had shut behind them and it was too late.
he was starting to regret his decision. Being given a loophole so he wouldn’t have to think about gay sex just yet wasn’t enough to overcome his other reservations.
Under other circumstances Sherlock might have protested, but it was all he could do to remove his coat and scarf with leaden movements and slump onto the sofa as he felt his transport quickly losing steam.
“Yeah, I know you’re not a child. Though the way you act sometimes makes it really hard to tell the difference.” John muttered snidely.
John didn’t say anything when he sat down on the other side of the small cafe table, only lifted the coffee Sherlock had bought him to his lips. Out of the corner of his eye Sherlock caught the expression of appreciative surprise when John found it was still warm, but didn’t look away from his view of the street. They sat in silence for long minutes before John grunted and began rummaging in his coat pockets.
“Oh, god, you’re traumatized now, aren’t you? I should’ve been more careful. I have friends I could’ve set you up with, I was just too eager to prove how bloody right I was.”
Sherlock, who’d been going over his account of events on automatic as he snuck glances at Donovan and John and tried to deduce their conversation, startled at Lestrade’s tone.
Sherlock cleared his throat. Now they were both staring at his hands. This entire scenario had worked out with far less protest from John in his head.
“Ok, let’s hear it. Only I’m warning you right now I won’t let you turn our flat into a miniature surgery. There are some things I’m just not qualified to do.”
The excitement shifted to worry, her eyes darting towards John, and that was all the confirmation Sherlock needed. There hadn’t been another- if Lestrade had been waiting for him the sound of voices would have attracted his attention immediately. No body meant they’d remembered the case and come to find it, which meant a “drugs bust” to search his flat. John was a doctor with an alcoholic brother; the last thing he’d want would be a romantic entanglement with a former junkie.
