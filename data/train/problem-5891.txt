Tony weeps again, silent, sadder than ever in his life.
He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them again Steve is the one with his back on the blanket, while Tony straddles his thighs. He must’ve taken one leg out of his boxers when Steve wasn’t looking, because they’re sliding over one thigh, down and down towards his knee the more he moves and shifts.
Tony puts his tablet on the coffee table. “Steve.”
“I didn’t think you’d care for them.”
Tony looks at him, uncertain, frowning, he shakes his head just once.
(See the end of the chapter for
Silence stretches between them. Tony looks into the distance, focuses on nothing in particular. The mountains take up the landscape.
Tony’s disappointed face, his rage, his hatred for Steve, for the way he manipulated him and hid the truth from him. But also Tony’s soft gaze after the Hulk revived him in New York, the way he asked Steve,
Then Tony asks, “You sure you’re alright?”
“Yep,” Tony replies, and Steve tucks Tony’s head under his chin.
Steve finally lets himself acknowledge the two identical circles of gray metal around Tony’s wrists. The sun catches onto their surface, makes them shine.
No bite the first time you have sex with someone means no bond with that person. It’s not like that for everyone, times have changed a bit, but for most people it still works like that, and for sure it does for Steve, no doubt. It’s romantic, in a way. They say that when you find the right mate, you just
It’s Tony’s fault, really. None of it is on Steve.
Tony looks at him and shakes his head—fond and amused, but also something else that Steve can’t quite understand at the moment, even through the bond.
Tony’s shoulders tense up for a moment, and he shakes his head, slowly.
“Let me go,” Tony hisses, low and menacing, but also hollow, somehow. Empty.
Tony laughs, “Sì, proprio come babbo. Okay. Ciao, allora.”
“I know. Please. It’s alright.”
Tony looks at Steve, and joy is erased right away from his face the moment their eyes meet.
“Tony, I—”
“Yeah, I know. I don’t know. Thinking back on it now, maybe she was trying to tell me about my parents. Maybe she hoped you’d tell me soon, and wanted me to know something about Barnes, before. I don’t... I really don’t know.”
But at some point someone shoved this baby in his arms and Tony really, really, didn’t want to give her back. And to whom, anyway?
“Works alright for the rest. I’m just cold.”
That’s why Tony sighs and fishes his phone out of his pocket while Steve stares at medieval frescos. That’s why Steve draws while Tony works on his tablet, or welds pieces of armor in his workshop.
“Look at me, Steve.”
Steve wakes up in the morning to an empty bed.
After a few minutes, Tony feels like something’s not right.
“Kill me?”
Tony stares at the drawing.
Steve takes a step closer to him and Tony—
Tony has never felt safer than when his back is pressed to Steve’s chest. He falls asleep so quickly that he doesn’t even realize it.
“I’m sorry.”
They take a couple more teeth out. They make me swallow them.
He waits while Steve reads it. He observes him as rage surges into him and then ebbs away while he looks at the pictures.
Steve twists around to look at Tony, resting his weight against the sink.
“Because I’d trust him with my life, and more. And because he’s allowed on Wakandan soil. He brought the arm there, he’ll provide technical help—he
“And Nat?” Steve asks, changing the subject.
Tony turns to look at him, a wild flicker in his eyes, worse than any dullness.
“Not as low as you.”
He kisses Tony, circles his waist with one arm and adjusts his position on the bed so he can thrust up into him. Once, twice, countless times, fast and hard and harder and harder still, until Tony goes limp in his lap and rests his forehead on Steve’s shoulder.
“Yeah.” He sounds breathless.
“I’m not even hard right now—”
, went to Carol and told her he wanted to leave the team, asked advice on how to break it to Steve. Carol wasn’t thrilled by his existential crisis so he agreed to stay on, but how exactly is he supposed to deal with Riri telling him he’s still her “favorite grandpa” when it doesn’t sound as much of a joke as it did five years ago?
He has intrusive self-destructive thoughts.
“The serum generally is. It makes most things easier. Like giving head, as you say.”
“I’m gonna be fine,” Steve reassures him, softly, gently.
So. It’s happening. It’s gonna happen. There’s nothing to do.
Which isn’t something Tony ever expected to think, but that’s life.
The universe. The universe doesn’t do anything. The universe has no meaning. It makes no sense.
Tony’s phone rings.
But here, Steve’s whole life consists of a few, fundamental things.
“Oh my god, Captain America said a sex word.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, moving his hand to Tony’s face, caressing his curls away from his face.
Fuck, he really needs to cough and he can’t and—
“It’s… like there’s a road that starts in my head and ends in yours. I can always feel you. You are always there. Like sunshine.”
“I think it’s dislocated. Can you…”
Tony squeezes Steve’s thigh. As agreed, Steve speeds up his thrusts, and Tony closes his eyes and lets himself go, lets saliva dribble down the corners of his mouth and on his chin, lets himself be a thing—a mouth to be fucked instead of a person.
“Hey. How tired are you on a scale from zero to the day I told everyone that I was Iron Man?”
The man never wanted what can be done with hands and mouths, so Tony was never forced to do that. He just wanted to fuck Tony. But the man also wished to kiss him, and yet he never did, since Tony didn’t want it. There was a small amount of respect in that and Tony—
“Ugh, I need to brush my teeth,” Steve says.
But then the words make their way into Steve’s brain, and he registers them.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t want to—”
“You’re so beautiful when you’re asleep.”
“What would you like me to be?”
Rage and shame flood his chest, scalding hot.
“As a belated apology,” he says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Steve laughs and tells him that he loves him.
They all move to the living room, and Tony sits at the piano, Stella standing close to him while Steve stays back.
Steve shifts and hugs him close to himself.
“Yes. Of course.” Steve puts on a t-shirt and rubs the sleep out of his eyes.
They sit there for a while, absently watching other visitors enter and leave the chapel, and then walk back down the hill. There aren’t many people, the first days of September already have an effect on the influx of tourists, and Tony idly wishes that it also meant some respite from the stifling weather, but he knows it’s going to take at least the middle of October for that.
“Fuck,” Steve says, and it’s all regret and remorse. “I’m sorry, Tony. Nothing’s wrong with you, I’m sorry. I’m frustrated, and… It’s no excuse, I’m sorry.”
“Tony—”
Each has a preference. Each has a personality, likes, dislikes.
“It makes you feel like you belong somewhere,” Steve says, in a dreamy tone. He makes a face as if he didn’t mean to say it out loud, draws in a sharp breath. He licks his lips and swallows. “It makes you feel like you’re part of a system. Like a planet.”
Steve has felt this powerless only once in his life, when he couldn’t cover those couple of feet between his hand and Bucky’s on that damn train.
“I’m sorry. What I did... I’m so sorry, Tony.”
He takes a moment to anticipate the scrape of the metal on his skin, and begins shaving, painstakingly meticulous.
That does something to a person. Even when that person is Tony.
“Don’t be unfair, Tony. You know why she did it.”
For an absurd moment, Steve thinks they’re gonna kiss.
“A lab accident?”
“Alright.”
Goddammit.
“I love you. I forgive you. I want to be with you.”
“They’re not keepin’ it.”
“Come on,” he says, “give me a smile. Even a small one.”
“No, I made arrangements. We depart from Pisa. It’s only a couple of hours away.”
“I’ve got you,” Steve says again, in his ear this time, in his head.
“Oh, come on. Don’t give me that.”
Watching him be himself.
wants to adopt.
He’s about to go back inside and try to reach him on his phone, but he’s struck with an idea. More like an epiphany, really.
“It’d be twice as bad.”
“You’re naked.”
But no. He had no body to bury. He could only watch, helplessly, while they shuffled Tony’s dead body away in an ambulance. He was never able to ask for it back—they were both criminals, and in Osborn’s America criminals had no rights. No one had rights.
“Nope.”
There’s a text on the flip phone. It says,
“I’m sorry it’s taking me so long. I keep turning this in my head... I care about you, Steve. I don’t want to get this wrong. I swear I’m not being cruel on purpose.”
“So, now I’m gonna do something. Gonna try. Stop me if you don’t want it, okay? ‘Kay.”
He hangs the strop on one of the robe hooks. He takes his time making sure the blade is sharp, because the razor hasn’t been used in a long time, and he wants to do a good job.
“You think it’ll change? With time?”
Steve looks down, at his socked feet, plays with a bit of lint on the blanket. His fingers are very long. His nails are perfect, and Tony bets they’re not even manicured. His skin is so fair that his knuckles are red. His right sleeve rides up a bit on his wrist, exposing his fine blond hair. There’s dirt from the pencil on the side of his hand.
is Tony.
“Are we.”
“Oh man, you know the words?”
His skin is burning up, but he feels cold all the same.
. He hasn’t thought about sex this much in decades. He thinks about Steve, and his mind goes to dirtier places than it ever did before they were together, when he spent his nights pining and dreaming of a very specific warm body next to him.
, two for Tony and five for Steve, which is definitely too much.
There’s just static.
“Yes.”
Tony’s back looks beautiful in the dim light of the early evening, just after sunset. His skin is smooth and tanned, and his scent still makes Steve dizzy.
“Tony, I can’t… I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I can’t fight with you. I’m sorry. I—”
But he doesn’t.
Tony draws closer to Steve, makes him uncross his arms and slides into a tense hug.
“My blood is your blood. My flesh is your flesh. My mind is your mind.  May our bond be never-ending, may our lives be tied forever. There is no beginning and no conclusion. We are together as one in the garden of life.”
“I’m sure. Why so much doubt, Steve? We did it once, back when—”
“Right.”
“It’s alright. I promised I’d be with you, and I am. Just stay with me, too. Please?”
, I’m just saying. I like it.”
The thing is, it’s just— he’s on an endorphin rush all the time. He’s not sure a sixty-year-old guy can handle all these orgasms. Not one with his heart issues, anyway.
“How does it feel?” Steve asks.
“Because I hope we can fix this. Us. I regret what I did to you. I might’ve had my reasons, but it was wrong.”
Tony gives him a confused look.
“Give me one,” Tony jokes, addressing Stella.
He’s careful while he opens him up. Steve’s finger struggles to push past the initial resistance of Tony’s muscles, and he feels so tight around Steve’s first knuckle. So impossibly tight.
Tony takes several deep breaths, forces himself to calm down. He rubs at his chest, gauges if the pain is real or only the ghost of that terrible nightmare. His heartbeat goes back to normal after a couple of minutes.
Maria doesn’t talk. She’s eighteen months old and she doesn’t talk.
“What do you say we get some rest today? Spend the day in the garden?”
“I... thank you, for that.”
“And here I thought it was my charming personality.”
After, when the Avengers had secured whatever victory was possible, they went back to being strangers.
. Or at least, he sticks his name only on the research papers. I stick it on everything.”
It’s okay with Steve. He settles between Tony’s thighs, strokes his soft dick with delicate brushes of his fingers, massages his balls, presses on his prostate from his perineum. Tony groans. Steve gets an idea: he makes Tony roll on the bed until he is stomach down, spreads his cheeks apart, nips at the plump meat of Tony’s ass for a bit until Tony hisses, and then, without much preamble, he licks Tony’s hole.
That’s something Steve didn’t expect. He knew Tony would be tight, and he is, but mostly he’s just so
And Steve does.
Tony thinks.
Then, still cupping Steve’s face like the most precious thing, he says, “I love you. I may not love myself, but I love you. So much.”
“Fine,
As long as Steve isn’t actively trying to kill him. Oh my god! Is Steve secretly evil now?
He loves it, when Steve laughs.
Tony wants to stop time; he wants to bottle up this feeling of perfection, of accomplishment, the sweetness of rightful revenge that he never thought could be so addictive, but he knows that, like it always is with all the best drugs, the rush will only last a minute.
“But you’re happy, now? You made up and you’re happy. Happy, like, for real?”
Tony sighs and opens his eyes to chase away the memories.
First of all, as promised and as requested,
“What?” That’s not exactly rare, but it only ever happens in one case: when the Omega is dead. “I’m not dead.”
No, that’d be ridiculous. Tony needs to stop thinking about this.
And Steve thinks,
“I know you like to... I know you’re a tactile person. That’s okay. But I still don’t feel... I can’t do it all the time.”
“Wakanda was involved, but not me personally,” he says simply, like it’s obvious.
“Come on,” Steve says again when Tony blinks his eyes open and refocuses on what’s happening. “Get these clothes… Come on,” he urges, and again Tony obeys.
“Dude,” Rhodey says after running into Steve for the third time in three days. “What the hell’s happening?”
Tony rolls his eyes. He smiles.
“I count that as a compliment,
And while he asks that, he moves one hand from the mattress to place it over Steve’s chest.
Steve lies on the bed and indulges in his own misery.
He waits for the memory to play out in his head (
“You can take the first shower, if you want,” Tony says, abruptly, quickly, before his brain can pull some stupid shit on him and give him ideas he definitely cannot entertain.
He gasps, and that alone—this small allowance to his own weakness—helps him regain control over himself.
“Did they hurt—”
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
So it goes on. Their activities vary now, depending mostly on the place they find themselves in, if they have lube on hand or not, if they have to be really quick about it because Fury is waiting for them in the conference room.
Despite his prompting, Tony is tense, Steve can see it in the lines around his mouth, in the way his lips part slightly.
Good god. He fucked Tony. While Tony was sleeping.
“This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard in my life. And I’ve been in Justin Hammer’s presence. Multiple times.”
Steve has no right to be jealous. And yet, he keeps seeing it in his mind, playing in a cruel loop: Tony and the man hugging, Tony closing his eyes, the way they smiled and—
When Tony’s gaze lands back on Steve, he sees the way his chest is heaving, how his arm is shaking while his hand is still under the water.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again, and starts walking towards the elevator. He’s leaving.
an erection, instead of this weird feeling where his dick can go only as far as half-hard at best. His body looked better, he only had a few gray hairs at his temples. And it’s even worse when he compares himself to Steve ‘peak of human perfection with superhuman stamina and the libido of a teenager’ Rogers: Steve seems always ready to
“And then we decided that there was a safer way to try, that with the Pym Particles we could go in undetected and—”
“Yeah, I wish you would.”
It’s like a wound you can’t stop scratching; you pick at the scab until you get the satisfaction of it starting to bleed all over again. And then you feel stupid because you knew, you fucking
He lifts himself up to look at Steve.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut, burrows his face into Tony’s collarbone. He’s crying.
Steve rests his forehead against Tony’s shoulder.
“And Barnes?” Tony’s voice doesn’t shake. It doesn’t.
He gasps again.
“So.”
Tony sucks in a sharp breath.
“Since about 4.”
Steve places a hand on the dip of Tony’s neck, caresses his jaw.
“I don’t know, Tony. I’m sorry. Could be insomnia?”
There’s a small window. I can see the sky and the white clouds passing by.
“Thank you. See you soon.”
“You’re biased.”
Something deep in Steve’s lower belly shatters, releases a spike of energy that rushes through him like an electric current, makes him shiver. Tony doesn’t stop thrusting, smears Steve’s come on his abs, rubs it up to his chest and
They talk for about twenty minutes, and when they hang up there’s a hopeful smirk on T'Challa lips that makes Tony feel almost optimistic.
Tony’s on top of him, moving, and Steve holds his hips to steady him and just lies there and takes it, until his head starts working again and he can form a thought.
“But now you fall asleep all the time. You always look tired.”
He allows himself a few more moments of self-commiseration, then he finishes showering and towels off. In the bedroom, he sits on the bed, naked, and he means to get a pair of underwear from the drawer any minute now, but he stops when he sees that Steve has left his drawing on Tony’s pillow.
Stella smiles. “I’ll show you something.”
Tony is sensual when he walks like this, when he lets his hips roll with each movement. He can turn it off and on as he likes; Steve has seen him do it many times. So he knows that this time, like every other, is deliberate.
“Yeah.”
“Please,” he says, making Stella huff a little laugh. She cuts him a piece of pie.
Tony looks at Steve’s lips for long seconds, and then nods, timid and unsure, barely noticeable.
Tony flinches back. He can’t help it.
He wants to shake his head but he can’t. Any form of control over his body is a thing of the past.
, Steve thinks,
are written at the bottom, in Steve’s elegant and old-fashioned handwriting.
Tony turns to face him. He’s awake, and he looks at Steve for a long moment without saying anything. Then he straddles Steve’s hips and kisses him, his tongue reaching deep into Steve’s mouth; Steve can taste a drop of his own dried up come on Tony’s bottom lip.
“Tony.”
did, if anything. Steve. This isn’t your fault.”
I'm happy about it, naturally. But I'm also worried, Stella, because I see something uncontrollable in Tony's eyes when he talks to his father. He wants to fight, humiliate him even, and yet he also desperately tries to please him.
He runs. He doesn’t think.
“I made it,” Steve says.
A smirk. “Oh, sunshine, we’re gonna have so much fun together.”
“Okay, sorry.”
“Hey, you never know,” he says, grinning.
Still. It’s not like Tony has had time to go out a lot lately. Or the reason. Except to take Maria on a walk in Bryant Park. When he can avoid the paparazzi.
knot me here, do you understand—”
He stops after a few thrusts, pulls out, fixes his clothes. He looks at me like I’m the half-eaten carcass of an animal well past the point of putrefaction.
Tony doesn’t react for several long moments, and Steve feels panic rush through his veins.
He dreams of his body falling next to Tony’s, his own head a few feet away. Their blood mixing on the floor as an extreme, final act of love-making.
“I wish I knew how to help you.”
He enters the building while an old lady is exiting the front door, and he’s quick up the stairs. He rings the bell and Nat opens the door a minute later. Clearly, she was still asleep.
“Your heart is beating really fast.”
“Listen, I’m a big boy. Actually, I’m a grown ass man. I’ve sold weapons to backstabbing human garbage for a good portion of my life, much to my regret. I’ve got thick skin. I’m fine.”
They don’t go straight back home. Tony insists Steve just drives around the countryside for a while, and Steve humors him.
“Try using very simple words?”
“He’s gonna try BARF for the first time tomorrow.”
Tony adds two more eggs and shoots Manuela a quick text, so their fridge will always be stocked.
What if Steve isn’t here at all, what if the last week is all a figment of Tony’s pathetic imagination. It makes no sense that Steve would want his forgiveness. Steve doesn’t give a shit about him. Steve already hates him.
“So—”
Steve wonders if he should leave or not. Tony hasn’t acknowledged him, but this thing looks like is gonna play out pretty much like the other day, with the only difference being the person Tony is worried about.
He watches Tony throw his head back and stare at the sky with his lips parted. He takes a moment to savor the anticipation, and to memorize the shape of Tony’s throat now that it’s stretched and exposed like this.
“So I’m gonna ask you. Do you want to have sex with me? And be together as bondmates?”
Tony feels awful and he doesn’t know why and he doesn’t know how to fix it and he needs to fix it because he needs to be okay for Steve, he needs to guide Steve through the other side of his rut but he’s feeling so bad all of a sudden, so empty, why is he so goddamn empty—
“I won’t. But you know it’s necessary.”
The wind picks up the ashes and spreads them along the stream, into the water, and all around the woods, the bushes, the thick undergrowth. He watches them disappear, seemingly into thin air, dissolve and melt into the endless cycle of nature.
But he can’t.
“That’s— adorable. Thank you.”
After a few minutes of silence, Tony finds the courage to speak again.
Steve walks to the car, places his bag on the backseat next to Tony’s. Then, he sits in the same place T’Challa was occupying just a minute ago.
Steve first instinct when he meets Tony’s eyes is to reach out and touch him, caress his face or his neck. To hug him close, make him press his face to Steve’s chest and shield him from whatever’s on his mind.
“It’s green,” Tony says, an evil glint in his eyes.
The boy comes in.
Steve kisses back, still a bit unsure of himself, still careful, maybe fearing that Tony is going to shatter into a billion pieces between his arms if he presses too hard against his lips or licks too deep inside his mouth.
“I know. It’s just—”
Instead, they’re here.
But it went how it went.
With precise movements, Steve sits on the bed next to Tony, leaving plenty of space between them.
Tony isn’t hungry, but he forces himself to eat what Steve makes, because he knows Steve would do the same in his place. He drinks his water when Steve looks at him sideways after he tries to get up from the table leaving his glass full.
“No one else can do it.”
“Did I wake you? Playing?”
There’s a long pause, filled only by the rustling of the wind, by the rushing of the water, by the distant voices of children playing in the sunlight.
“Okay, listen to me now,” Steve pulls Tony’s chin up with his hand, makes Tony look at him. Tony feels ashamed, but he meets Steve’s eyes. “First of all, with our jobs,
They eat slowly, and the sun is completely gone when they start the dishwasher. It’s late, and Tony has yawned a couple of times.
The smile on Tony’s face vanishes. He closes his eyes for a moment, as though to gather his strength, and he pouts, overwhelmingly sad.
“Thank you,” Steve says, his voice thick with tears. He lifts his head to look at Tony and sure enough, his face is wet.
Steve slams his shield on the Iron Man helmet, over and over again, until it shatters to reveal Tony’s face, distorted in a mask of blood and terror.
“Yes. It’s also still technically mine, believe it or not. Ever heard of Carbonell? Women’s clothes.”
could end up being the one who has to spend years alone, Tony. We don’t know. No one knows, ever. But I don’t care. Being with you is the best thing that has happened to me in my entire life. I want to build my future with you. I chose you, I choose you every day. The way you make me feel— there’s nothing like it. Sometimes I can’t believe I love you this much. And I
“I am… so sorry, I had no idea.”
“Yeah. Palladium poisoning, from the reactor. Don’t make that face, it’s fine now, it runs on vibranium.”
“How did it feel, Steve?” Tony asks, abruptly, breaking the silence.
Tony wonders what made Steve cry earlier. He wonders what his last drawing meant. He wonders why Steve sometimes still lies when Tony asks him something, despite his best intentions of making amends.
. It’s like a constriction, in a way, but it feels— nice. Like it’s all over. It sends a rush of heat through him, and. It makes him feel— sensual. Like he hasn’t felt in a long time. He is covered in come, he is full of come, there’s probably come in his hair, and Tony should feel gross, maybe, but he just doesn’t.
“FRIDAY, bio signs?”
doesn’t just mean
“Shh, sweetheart, it’s alright. It’s alright.”
Steve guides him into a hug. Tony feels him kiss his hair.
Then, like a wave that crashes against the rocks, it loses its momentum and quiets down.
It’s okay, Tony thinks. There’s no rush.
Tony’s phone buzzes.
God, he wishes he could go to him and touch him, use his hands to make sure that Tony is fine—a little worse for wear, yeah, but nothing that can’t be solved with a couple of days of rest. With a couple of days of Steve curling up against him in bed, their perfect daughter sleeping softly close by, the bond shining again in their minds—
“Do you know how to read and write?”
He knows he should.
“We’re in Italy.”
“I just wish I remembered the moment, you know,” Steve says, quiet and pensive, while Tony is resting his head on his chest and cataloguing every beat of his heart. “The moment we became one again, after ten years. With all the things I wish I could forget… My mind has a sick sense of irony.”
“Goddammit,” Tony sounds exhausted. It’s Steve that does that to him. That drains all his energy away, that consumes his soul piece by piece.
All of it, every memory, every sensation, every gesture, coalesces deep in the middle of Tony’s chest, in that place between the arc reactor and his heart. All of it catches fire inside him, a person made into a blazing sun.
If it’s not one thing, it's gonna be the other.
He’s worried. He hopes Steve isn’t hurt.
“I can’t talk about this anymore,” Tony says, and he gets up, even though he’s not so sure his legs are going to sustain his weight. He staggers onto his feet and into the bathroom, every step a struggle against his heat. He feels slick trickle down the inside of his thighs and his skin crawls.
“No. It was. Bad.” Steve’s voice is thick with tears, and he sniffs, loudly. He can’t stop himself from leaning into Tony’s touch, and that’s another way to apologize in his heart.
“Why? We don’t need to be besties for this.”
Later, they have lunch. Steve makes pasta with Stella’s ragù, asking Tony for instructions only at the trickiest points of the process.
“You can ask for more food, if you need it.” Tony’s words are very slow, as if he’s explaining this to a small child who can’t yet grasp complex concepts.
“Kinda?”
Tony is alive.
Tony smirks. “You know that’s not the right number.”
Until it’s not.
Steve opens the front door, steps outside in the little porch. He places the half-empty glass on the table, but doesn’t sit down on either of the chairs.
The bracelets around Tony’s wrists hiss, and the armor forms all around him in less than six seconds (he needs to get it down to less than five, than four, than three), all the pieces slotting into place with perfect precision, and Tony isn’t lying under Steve anymore, no, he’s standing next to the bed but
“I’ll believe it when I see them, then.”
“Sorry to bother you guys,” Tony says while Bucky comes into the room from the corridor. He’s rubbing at his eyes with his hand. “Steve has a problem. He needs you, Nat.”
“Yes. Yes.”
There’s a grandfather clock in Steve’s room. Tony has no idea where he got it, but it appeared sometime after Sarah’s first birthday. It works; the hands and the pendulum move and all, but it doesn’t tell the right time.
He’s just... he’s just perfect, isn’t he. There’s no other word. Nothing else can describe Steve’s body. He’s perfect.
“Tony, hey. Look at me, sweetheart.” Steve, caressing his face. He sounds strange,  lost and devastated, but also tangible, like he woke up to find out his worst nightmare is real, like he’s crying too. Tony always makes him cry.
Steve lifts his eyes to look at Tony, but thinks better of it before he can reach his face. He just stares in front of himself, and his gaze lines up with Tony’s belly.
He looks at Tony while he talks to T'Challa.
“Shh, there’s no need,” he tries, with a soft voice, “there’s no need. It wasn’t your fault, and I’m okay. I was an ass, I’m sorry.”
Small mercies.
“Wow.”
“What did she say?” Steve asks, and immediately looks ashamed of his curiosity. He blushes. “If you don’t mind sharing,” he adds.
He’s here.
Steve looks sad and defeated. Tired, even though Wakanda has only one hour on Italy.
“Put a pot of water on the stove. Then go to the restaurant, they have clams ready for us. I can do it later if you don’t—”
“Oh, that’s... don’t think about that, Tony. Your heart was in the right place, it wasn’t your fault.”
Natasha asked Tony to walk her to the altar.
Someone shouts.
I’m sitting on the edge of the bed, and he’s crouched down in front of me, between my open thighs. He has blue eyes. Blue eyes. Younger.
Does Steve actually want a relationship, though? Unlikely. Maybe for Steve
“Just say it, just one time—”
The ice makes Tony hiss at first, but soon it starts giving him relief. Steve brings him an aspirin, and gets the sling from Tony’s duffle bag, as per Tony’s instructions.
But he needs to remind himself that it’s unlikely Tony will actually be able to have another child. Sure, he went into heat, and he could even maybe get pregnant, but bringing it to term, actually having the kid? That’s another thing. So many things could go wrong, and Steve’s hang-ups may never be eased up.
They stay like that for almost an hour, and then they hear someone walk past in the hallway, so they separate, smile, and wish each other a good night.
Steve smiles back.
“Yeah. He became manageable. High-strung, on edge, but not violent. It numbed him down. And then—”
“Tell him I loved him, okay? I love him. And Sarah. More than—”
“That’s half the reason he likes you.”
“Alright,” he says in the end, quietly.
Tony searches for him with his mind. He finds regret and an underlying sense of guilt that will probably take a while to get rid of, but there’s also relief and acceptance. Steve is accepting Tony’s apology. Steve is accepting that maybe he didn’t deserve all that. Not ten years of it, anyway.
“Oh, come on.”
, that’s not pleasant), scrambles on the floor away from Steve, sits with his back to the wall and brings his knees close to his chest; his eyes are screwed shut and he’s still gasping, trying to control his breathing with no success and he’s murmuring something that Steve can’t quite catch.
Red and gold.
Steve’s phone buzzes.
“I know maybe this makes me just as bad as him,” he says, and Tony thinks,
“Not as reassuring as you think it is.”
“I’ve been your roommate for two years now,” Tony answers him. “Surely, I could at least read if something is bothering you.”
They both arrive by Steve's apartment, and Tony sits by one of the worn-out couches. Steve looks around: no sign of his roommate, Bucky.
When Tony left, Steve found Bucky outside the apartment building, burning something  that looked like old clothes into a barrel. He inquires what Bucky has been doing. Bucky said that he is just making himself warm. As Steve is about to leave, Bucky asks Steve "Who was with you earlier?"

Sometimes, when Tony's brain go noisy at night and insomnia kicks in,
"I thought everything was a dream," Tony said, his hand reaching for Steve's cheek, which Steve takes and presses Tony's palm into his cheek. "I dreamt that we were dancing, just like we used to."
Steve lightly shoves his hand away. "Pot, meet kettle!" In answer, Tony sticks his tongue out at him. The way his eyes are half open from being so sleepy only serves to make it adorable, though Steve would never tell Tony that.
"Both of you," JARVIS chastises, "hold still!"
Rated: Gen
"Do you think you can…" Steve looks at him in the eye. "Can you be my accompanist?"
"Overthinking." Steve finally says. "Your brain is so noisy, it will not do you any favors."
This takes him back to the time when his father's favorite seat was  in the back row near the emergency exit. That spot had an accessible wheelchair bay area, and Howard knew that Tony would be able to see him clearly from that seat. Tony could feel his heart beating wildly inside his heart. He remembers the suffocating feeling of being submerged into the darkest depths of the ocean. The light fades,  sound fades, and all Tony can see is his panic-induced pounding of the keys. It must  sound terrible, but he can't hear it, and there is nothing to guide him. He is all alone in his watery grave.
"Fine," Tony gives in. "So, what piece did you choose to play?"
Steve is not brash, Steve is not loud.
"My apartment is nearby, would you like to stay there for a while?" Steve asks.
You sure?
A pause.
Tony recalls what Natasha told him a couple of days ago, about that feeling of your world turning colorful once you have feel love in your heart. Why is he feeling it now? The world around him is sparkling. The colors are turning vibrant. And perhaps at its very core,is the fact he has never witnessed someone play music so beautifully. Whatever this blonde is doing, it’s  touching his soul.
ass if I didn't love it so much."
"I know you're rich," Steve teases while carefully lifting Tony upright, "but I really don't want to have to explain to Pepper why we need to redo your rooms yet again."
- This is Tony's piece in the piano competition.
Ok, ok, you win.
Tony can see Steve's face. Is he disappointed in him? But he remembers Steve's words before they went on-stage. Steve believes in him, maybe it is time to ...
“Hey! Hey! Are you ok?”
-This is T'Challa's piece during the competition.
“Well,” Steve begins. “You are handsome, very easy on the eyes…”
Lots of demands, Lots of threats
The links to the musical pieces in this chapter:
in many ways.
Hmmm... none at the moment.
"My accompanist," Steve answers him. "The second round of preliminaries is two weeks from now."
Steve felt anger creep up his chest, the image that Tony painted in his story was enough to shatter his resolve and commit an act of violence on Tony's part. He tries to restrain himself and reaches out to hold Tony's hand instead. Tony accepts, to his surprise, and entwines their hands together, seeking comfort on each other's hold. They both shared a deep sigh as they finished the remainder of their salty noodle broth with bread.
“You are easy yet difficult to be with too...  “ Steve says, which made Tony wince a bit. “You can be selfless and selfish at the same time. You are an open book but can be a bit guarded at times. You are very confident, yet you always doubt yourself. You are the biggest walking oxymoron I’ve ever met. And if two years of being roomies had proven something, it is that not every day is smooth. There would always be good days and bad days… But, do you know what made me drawn into you?”
"Yeah," Steve said in defeat "It is him, but please, let’s keep it a secret for now,"
Somebody who always checks on Tony...
“And you won’t be?”
"What the hell?" Tony says over the phone. "Steve told you, didn't he?"
At this point, Steve is playing just for the sake of playing his music. Tony looks back down at the piano keys. The sheet music sheet  still looks blank to him. He debates with himself whether or not he he should join Steve in his performance. He’s  already made it this far. His hands start to play again.
“What?” Tony asks him as he stares into Steve’s blue ones.
"...And so," Tony continues. "I announced the closure of the weapons manufacturing department of SI, which infuriated Obadiah, the person I trusted the most, the person who was like a father to me when I've lost my parents that fateful December night." Tony proceeds to recount his tale, a string of unfortunate events at the posh hotel where he was drugged, beaten, violated and left for dead in a landfill away from the city.
Is anything bothering you?
"Tony?" Steve says.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Play..playlist?” Steve stammers then almost chokes on a piece of meat, coughing violently, prompting Tony to stand abruptly, his smile turning into a frown.
"Please," Tony says, stifling a yawn. "I didn't realize just how hungry I was until now."
However, instead of running towards him, Steve goes straight to Bucky, who congratulates him on his performance. Tony looks on at the scene unfolding in front of him. It feels like he is watching a romance movie, and they are the leads.
He catches a glimpse of Steve in his dark blue velvet formal attire, and he seems happy looking around  backstage. Tony's mind goes into a panic as soon as he remembers that Steve is a crazy fiddler.
monsters who come from his own company.
"I- I'm…" he looks over in  Steve's direction as the blonde goes through the doors that lead backstage. It has been a while since Tony has been here, and sitting in the audience  somehow diminishes the pressure he usually feels.
Have you eaten?
Steve says nothing,quietly urging Tony to go on.
It's safe...
His mind takes him back to his earliest days of playing the piano. He would slam the keys with such curiosity and they would produce the most awful sounds ever. He remembers how his father told him that the piano should be dealt with gently, he might have been around four or five years old at this time.
What Tony doesn't know is that Steve feels the same way about him too.
Steve smiles and reassures him. “No, you didn’t.”
He loves to hear Steve breathing.
Ok, maybe that’s too much of a stretch.
"What a bummer. I was hoping to invite him to get dessert," Steve murmurs in a low tone as he walked around in circles, trying to hide his disappointment. "But since he is not available, why don't you sub in for him and go out with me instead?"
“HAPPY NEW YEAR!” Everyone screams in unison. The fireworks set off into the sky, the musicians begin to play their rap and RnB songs, the confetti joins the white flurries in the air, and amidst the festivity around them, Steve and Tony’s hands were gently cradling each other’s faces.
Today is the day of the competition, and Steve must have been frantically looking all over for him. He thinks he told Steve about withdrawing the offer, but now it's too late. Steve needs him. But can he? Can he live up to the expectations?
Sitting up with a groan, he reaches for the zipper on Steve's left side. "Show me."
Steve is fully aware that both he and Thor would normally be almost fine at this point, except for the sheer weariness of not getting a single day off to recoup and recover. It's affected them in ways they hardly ever see.
The brunette teen laughs and proceed to tease them further.
Steve strolls down NYC's streets on his motorbike and takes a trip down memory lane.
Steve gives a forceful cough and clears his throat, then drinks water. “Oh, Tony,” he says breathlessly, then with a smile, he says, “I’m ok now,”
Except...
Steve's here.
Steve thinks. He notices a man a couple of meters in front of him, about to cross the road. Steve looks up and sees the car speeding recklessly. He runs and yanks the man's arm before the vehicle can hit him, thus saving the man's life.
Tony stirs beside him, and Steve thinks that he is cute with his tousled hair as it pronounces his curls even more. He greets Tony with a kiss on the temple, earning a blush from the brunet.
“What makes you think something’s up?” the other one says, albeit

There is something about Steve that makes Tony say yes.
"You have heard the piece countless times before, you may as well have practiced it in your sleep," Steve gives him a soft smile. "The music is within you, Tony."
“Home,” Steve said.
“Hmm?” Steve’s full attention was on him at once.

He is his own person when he is not on duty.
"May I continue?" JARVIS interrupts; his tone is impatient but not surprised. He is, after all, used to them—Steve gestures for him to keep going. "Sir is bruised up, as per usual, on the rest of his body, but he does have a few bruised ribs and a slight concussion. I'd like to see his cuts cleaned, and for heaven's sake, tape that gash above his eye again; it keeps reopening. Ice his ribs, give him some Advil, and put Sir to bed already!"
"Uhhh..m" Steve debated whether he should disclose Tony's identity. "A friend from college," he answers.
But as he turns around, Steve catches his wrist and gives him a smile. "You should join us Tony." he says.
They stared at each other for quite some time, and after a few moments of silence, Steve seemed to give up and tells his tale. “Sharon and I…” he begins. “We broke up after Halloween,”
Must be fate?
He hands Tony a cup of hot coffee, which the other man gladly accepts. He also prepares the noodles with hard-boiled eggs.
Tony feels somewhat sorry for Steve.
As a reminder, this beautiful piece of art is by LenkaVittoriaElisse16!
There's a pause, and JARVIS' voice speaks volumes for how done he is with both of them. "Am I your dad, your doctor, or your mother? I'm starting to get confused."
But this? He doesn’t know what to make of this.
“The love of your life?”
“Okay, hospital. But in New York. I don’t speak Russian. You think I can make it to New York?”
“I need to use the bathroom. Wait here,” Tony says, and leaves.
Steve shoots him a final skeptical look and follows Tony in the bathroom, closes the lid of the toilet to sit on it. Tony begins cleaning the burn on Steve’s collarbone, but the serum has already kicked in, the bleeding has stopped. Steve is trembling; there are goosebumps on his skin. Tony can’t fathom how he can be cold right now.
“I wanna eat fiorentina,” Steve says while Tony is walking a couple of steps ahead of him, clearly with a destination in mind.
On the dumb donut spaceship Tony realizes he’s lost the flip phone, and panic floods him.
Sarah makes a face. “But it’s fine now, right? You guys made up?” Her voice is so small and doubtful, it stomps all over Steve’s heart.
Steve slides his slick finger into Tony and the heat of him overwhelms him. It’s all there, the warmth he has missed all these months. It’s inside Tony.
There’s just one question left to ask. “Did he figure out the codes?”
“Yeah... wait, you knew this already?” Steve squints at him.
“We were together—”
, Steve wouldn’t touch him.
“Uhm,” Tony looks up at Steve, but Steve understands a word every five, so. Yeah. “C’erano i miei amici con me, lo abbiamo salvato insieme. Ascolta, come ti chiami? Dov’è la tua mamma?”
“Anything you want,” Steve murmurs.
Tony feels his chest give a jolt of pain that takes his breath away for a moment. He feels his left arm tremble, and tries to mask it by using it to massage the spot over his heart.
could ever glance twice in your direction with anything but mild annoyance, like you look at a cockroach you just killed with your shoe.
“I’m gonna be fine.”
“What happened? You okay?”
“I will. There’s a conference in December, I’ll stay at least a week. I’ll call you.”
As if life had been kinder to them, and had granted them this.
He did it all so they would stay. But they didn’t.
“You can do it. You can do anything. Come on.”
“I don’t...”
“I can’t do this, I can’t—” he says, pushing Tony away, starting to walk back to the shore. “I can’t, I’m sorry, I—”
“I don’t want to…”
Tony shifts Maria in his arms, taking her from under her armpits, careful that she doesn’t hurt her neck. He kisses her cheek this time, with more decision, making a little sound with his lips too.
Steve didn’t mean to say that.
It’s still early in the afternoon, so they drive to San Gimignano. It takes about forty minutes, and they start to see the towers of the little town since they approach the hill it’s built on.
“I’ll take that as a compliment.”
Tony doesn’t want to talk about what Steve needs to talk about, doesn’t want to say the words that would release Steve from these clutches. It’s an agony, the wait, the doubt, the not knowing. But there’s also some comfort in it: until Tony decides, Steve gets to do things that he wouldn’t be allowed when—
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he hears Tony saying, Tony, who is his now. He’s Steve’s, he loves him back. “I’m sorry, in the end I did something just as bad, I guess. I lied and I shouldn’t have. God, I’m an asshole.”
Bruce tries to explain. Steve almost can’t hear him over the pounding in his ears, the tension rushing out of him.
Being bonded, again, truly. Having a second chance.
“Are we still talking about the team?”
The man was a thorn in the side of pretty much anyone who was supposed to deal with him. The Shadow Pillar is a black site prison, miles and miles off any American soil. It’s not the first time that one of its inmates—international terrorists, dictators, people accused of genocide and crimes against humanity—gets killed in a dubious way, and it’s not the first time that such an event is swept under the rug without much thought.
Steve is not okay, though. Tony hurt him.
“Wanna feel you come all over me… taste you…”
“Tones, I know you’re angry. With reason. I’m just saying: be careful.”
It’s been a good life. He has a lot of regrets, but it’s been good, too. He saved the world. He helped people. He’s Sarah’s father, and that’s worth everything.
Tony chuckles and falls back onto the blanket, his arms behind his head, and closes his eyes.
“I love you. I am in love with you. In love. I want to be with you. In a relationship. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“Water?”
“What?”
Tony’s arms flail around for a moment before settling over Steve’s thighs, then he moves them up to grab Steve’s hips for better balance. Steve feels him swallow around him, trying to make saliva pool on his tongue, trying to wet the corners of his lips to make the slide easier.
Steve is very still for endlessly long seconds, paralyzed by stunned disbelief. “You’re not gonna do this, Tony.”
Then, Steve speaks.
They step outside, walk into the orchard. The day is sunny and hot, but the ground beneath their feet is still wet and muddy in places, where the trees are too thick for the sunshine to reach.
“I’m… I’m cold, Tony,” Steve says, lamely—all the more heartbroken that Tony forgot which form Steve’s heartbreak takes.
Steve’s arms used to be the safest place he could think of. He used to long for something like this, for one single real hug from him. He used to think,
“If you peel the potatoes, I’ll cut them up. So we can roast them,” Tony says, without looking at Steve.
And death came, and took Tony with her, and left Steve here, rotting away, missing half of his soul.
“Don’t waste it on me.”
Steve feels a warm liquid on his lap, it’s his come trickling out of Tony’s ass. God, Tony’s so full all the time. It’s in him, on him; he needs to take two showers a day. Steve wants to keep him like this as much as possible. Just— dripping with it, and then fill him up again.
“You came in my ass once, it’s not a big deal.”
Steve lifts his head, and sees the sky.
“Well, I sure don’t want that,” Stella deadpans, pointing at herself, “never wanted that in my life.
Tony imagines his hand touching the bond inside his mind. He finds Steve. He’s scared, more than anything else. There’s something shouting at him in his mind, alarms going off, and he’s fighting them with all his might. The compulsion is impossibly strong, but he’s so afraid of hurting Tony.
“Come on in, Tony,” Bucky says, and guides him in the kitchen. He starts the coffee.
The armor retreats into the reactor. Tony starts stripping and Steve tears his gaze away, fixing it over the heap of dirty designer clothes falling onto the grass.
“But why did she stay?” Tony chokes out, “She had money to her name, she could’ve—”
“I…” he says.
“No, Tony, I—“
The words shake Steve down to his core. Hearing Tony say that to Sarah was one thing, but having him say it again now, so seriously...
Steve growls again and then whines, still pressing Tony against the floor, keeping him still, grinding his hips against Tony’s ass now and then, but nothing more.
Steve scoffs. “Tony, I fell in love with you. I could list all the things I like about you, but the gist of it is… just that. I’m in love with you.”
“That’s why you’re chained up to a dirty wall.”
“You could breastfeed her this time around, too. We’d be the happiest family. Me, you, Sarah, and Maria. Perfect.”
“You don’t.”
They’re ugly thoughts, he knows. He knows he shouldn’t think about this stuff, especially not first thing in the morning. But he keeps thinking about it, about Steve having to invent this whole thing with sex every day—twice a day—so he doesn’t feel like he’s dating an archaeological artifact. And the only moments when Tony doesn’t feel like he’s crumbling into a heap of ash is when Steve is inside him, when he comes in Steve’s mouth, when Steve tells him he loves him and he’s not gonna leave him.
“Oh, very.”
“He passed out, and she’s—wait—yep, she fell asleep on the chair. It’s been awful, Tony. He white-knuckled it, maybe even had it worse once or twice in his messed-up life, but it’s been a fucking nightmare.”
Tony realizes immediately that he’s letting Steve hug him without flinching back as his first instinct. The thought makes him pause for a moment, leaves him with his arms still in his lap.
The chances of his daily wage being
"Tony, your hands-" she says as she carefully caresses them. "What if you injure your hand and can't play the piano anymore?"
When he is scared of the dark, he had a Captain America teddy bear that would guard him through the night.
Tony gives a small,
"What?" Natasha's voice is alarmed, and Tony watches her open her window, so, the two of them to can be face to face. "You have come this far Tony, now's not the time to quit."
“Hope you got us some cake too,” Tony playfully banters, as he sets up the table for them to dine in. He looks at the table cloth’s red and blue color scheme; he remembered getting it when Steve and he visited Ikea a couple of months ago.
“I haven’t been… God, I’ve been such a hypocrite. I accused you of lying but… I haven’t been entirely sincere either. I’m sorry.”
“No. About something old that can be used in an unexpected new way,” Tony says. Steve licks his lips, smiles to himself, and resumes reading his book.
“Dad said bad people hurt you.”
“C’mon. Fuck me. C’mon, sunshine.”
“I just wanted to say, Tony… I admire you. Really. As a person, and as an Avenger. Even when we disagree. I’m sorry if I ever made you think I had no respect for you. I’m clumsy with my feelings, with words, and I... sometimes, it feels like betraying her.”
It still makes me laugh so much.
Tony takes a step back from the bag and from Steve, who keeps looking at him with the most avid eyes. Tony wants to run away from that gaze—he’s sweaty, flushed, mad at his own gullibility, which isn’t something he thought affected him, but he has to come to terms with the fact that apparently, yes, it does. He’s just the pathetic Omega his father always accused him of being, ready to fall at any Alpha’s feet after sniffing some pheromones. Weak and gagging for it, always.
“Is there a position that’d make it easier?”
The bond is still there, still whole, but Tony never reaches for it with his mind, and he never feels Steve do it either. He wonders why Steve doesn’t ask some Wakandan doctor to break it.
They haven’t been dating long. After being Avengers members and friends for years, they finally pulled their heads out of their asses — as so many of their teammates like to say — and confessed that they had been in love this whole time. But, contrary to what Rhodey said when he first heard the good news, that had only made their flirting and general grossness around each other worse.
“You know what I mean!”
“I, I don’t—”
He couldn’t even hold Tony’s hand one last time, tell him that everything was going to be alright. It would have been a lie, yes, but at least Tony wouldn’t have had to die alone and terrified. It had been one of Tony’s worst fears, and Steve hadn’t been able to stop it from becoming reality.
“No, I just…” Oh, to hell with it. It’s the only chance he gets at being fucked by Steve Rogers, and he’s not going to waste it. Might as well try to get a good pounding. If he asks nicely, Steve will probably be kind enough to go along with it, he’s been nothing but patient with Tony’s nonsense so far. “It’s fine. I just didn’t expect you to be so—”
Tony shrugs and looks down at the carpet, Steve walks up to him, crouches down in front of him. Slowly, like Tony might break, like Steve’s heart might break, he places a hand on Tony’s knee. When Tony does nothing, Steve kneels between Tony’s legs, rests his cheek on the inner muscle of Tony’s thigh. Tony lifts his hand, uncertain, lets it hover in the air for a moment, then buries his fingers in Steve’s hair, kneads his scalp.
He forces himself to get out of Steve’s embrace in a natural way, but a shiver of loss and regret runs down his spine a moment later. Tony closes his eyes and waits for it to pass.
“It made me think about my mother. That she wasn’t happy either, I think.” He pauses to work attentively under Tony’s jaw. “My dad died before I was born. She had to do it all alone. We were poor, I was sick all the time. Then she got sick and died, and that was it. That was her whole life.”
He’s in love with Tony.
James Barnes enters the screen. He looks okay. His hair is short and clean; he shaved. He looks younger, healthier. Whole, even if he’s wearing a tank top that doesn’t hide the bad scarring where his metal arm used to be.
Steve lets him jerk away.
“Well, I—”
“I’m sorry I punched you. And that I called you Cap,” Tony says while he crawls into bed next to Steve. He buries his face into the hollow of Steve’s throat, and he feels Steve’s reply pressed against his cheek, besides hearing it.
“You’re a good Alpha,” he whispers against Steve’s mouth when the kiss ends, “and you’re a good man.”
“You’re not being yourself, though,” he says, struggling to talk.
“No, just, just stop. We’re doing this, okay? We’re
And Steve simply can’t stop himself.
“Why did you come back? Why now?” Steve asks, and he still can’t recognize his own voice.
“What?”
The press conference he saw on YouTube, almost a year ago now, still feels like a knife through his heart.
Tony huffs a small laugh.
Pain, excruciating.
Tony grips his left arm tight. “I—”
“That boy with the metal arm? He’s your friend from the war, right?”
One afternoon, just after lunch, Tony comes back to Avengers Mountain from a meeting in the city. A bit of a headache is blooming between his eyes, so he takes off his jacket and tie, unbuttons his collar, rolls up his sleeves, and splashes his face with cold water.
“No, you can’t. I don’t want you here. You’re so annoying when you’re worried.” He rolls his eyes. “I want you to stay there, with Tony, you guys talk, and fix things. Or try, at least. Honestly, Steve, the shit you pulled…”
He drags the boxers down Steve’s legs and tosses them on the chair, then gets naked himself, but before he can get back to the bed Steve is standing close to him, kissing him again, taking both his and Tony’s cock in his big hand and stroking them together, slowly, so the lack of lubrication doesn’t hurt either of them.
, the voice says.
“I don’t think it’d be enough this time.”
“I almost believe you.”
He puts the strop back in the leather case of his grooming kit. He towels the razor dry and puts it back in too, but leaves the brush and the soap out to dry on the windowsill. It’s so hot that it won’t take much time.
“I need you to say it, Steve,” Tony insists, but Steve doesn’t know what Tony wants him to say, what is it, whatever, it doesn’t matter, just, just—skin tongue slick fuck knot hole bond bite mate mine—
“Think about the day we went to Siena. It feels like it was weeks ago.”
Tony accepts it, because there’d be no point in trying to refuse, and because he really wants to try it, see if it tastes anything like Mom’s.
“There’s plenty of space—”
“You want to hold her?” he asks, and Steve nods. The way he does it, though, is as if someone is pointing a gun to his head and telling him to nod. Like he knows he shouldn’t want this.
He takes all the faith he has in Tony, and takes the last leap.
“No, it’s okay. He wants his space, I’ll respect that. He’s scared?”
She’s quiet for a while. “I thought I was sick. When I felt that thing.”
, an ugly part of his mind supplies, the opposite of helpful.
“It’ll be just a moment,” Tony says, again with the gentlest voice Steve’s ever heard him use. “Just to get in the water.”
Tony kisses him through his orgasm. He’s the most incredible thing.
They were civil for the sake of the battle.
Sarah gets up, still a bit reluctantly, but she leaves to go wash up and get dressed in her room.
Steve would love to visit the cities, but it’s unlikely Tony will want to go. Or that he will go for Steve’s sake.
He lets his shoulders sag.
The sketch is made with charcoal. It’s the cherry tree, but seen from a distance. Under it, two unrecognizable figures—one very tall, the other quite short—stand close, face to face. Maybe they’re kissing. Maybe they’re just pressing their foreheads together. Maybe one of them is whispering something into the other’s ear.
“I never wanted to make you afraid of me, Tony. I swear.”
Steve grabs at Tony’s clothes, yanks at his loosened tie, starts undoing Tony’s buttons but he’s not really in control of his strength at the moment and he feels some of them shatter between his fingers. Tony doesn’t seem to care, he’s pulling at Steve’s sweater like it personally offended him.
“Please. Come here,” Tony says. “This is a bit of a surprise, I guess.”
Steve breath catches in his throat. He swallows, nods—he can’t speak.
No. No, it doesn’t. It doesn’t. The man didn’t care. Anything he did or didn’t do was part of his sick power game, and there’s nothing deeper than that. Even asking Tony to join him as leader of Hydra was just to see if he could push Tony over that particular edge, if he could destroy him so completely, make him turn on his friends. He didn’t really want Tony by his side.
There’s been tension for months. Not the kind of tension they experienced on the helicarrier that first day, a different type. After New York they started talking, started agreeing, or at least disagreeing in a productive way; there were lingering touches and lingering gazes, soft smiles and whispered tactics, murmured ideas.
“Will do.”
Steve notices, just then, that he’s wearing a ring too. He knows Tony’s name is carved inside it.
“So why do you think Maria wasn’t happy? She had what she wanted.”
“Sometimes. A bit. You get used to it. I’m glad for the light though. The first few months after they got the old one out, I would… It’s stupid, but I’d wake up at night and panic ‘cause I couldn’t see the light.”
“Not, not alone.” Steve tries out the words, how they feel on his lips. It’s a new concept for him, not being alone.
“Uh... Okay. Thanks.”
“I don’t know. Not so much. The stuff Matt said about me at school… that I smell bad… I don’t know, I’m sorry.”
“Tony,” Steve says, voice gentle, “It was just a bad dream. He’s alright.”
Steve can’t even go to him and touch him with the excuse of checking those wounds, because he is chained to a wall with a broken leg and Tony doesn’t want to be touched by him.
“I can’t fucking believe no one told me she died. That week, what a mess. How did I miss that? Un-fucking-believable.” His voice isn’t as steady as he’d like, and he drops the knife in the sink with a clatter that sounds deafening in the quiet of the room. Steve, who was sitting in his chair, gets up and steps closer. He lifts a hand as if to touch Tony, but then thinks better of it, and sets it down on the countertop.
“Seems like everyone owns a villa in the countryside here.”
“Absolutely not! You’re my guests! And I don’t want people in my kitchen messing up with my system! You two go upstairs, take a shower or whatever. Come back around 8, alright?”
