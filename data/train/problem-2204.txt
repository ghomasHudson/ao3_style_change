When last we left our boys Sherlock and John had found their way back to each other. But things are never so easy...
The sadness of Sherlock's words was a gut punch to John, and he found himself wishing that all of Sherlock's past pains were his. When he'd first met Sherlock his brilliance had out shined his humanity at times, yet at others he was the picture of human kindness. And though he could be socially inept he was never cruel or hateful, unkind perhaps when provoked but never malicious. Malice was for fools. In truth everything that Sherlock did was an act of kindness. He didn't solve cases for notoriety or money. He did it to save lives. Sherlock looked down into his empty glass not ready to meet John's gaze. John had no words. What he did have was a near overwhelming need to hold Sherlock close and shield him from the world. And so he simply rested his hand on Sherlock's leg just above the knee and rubbed gently. Sherlock chanced a glance up and found a soft bright smile that spoke louder than any words could have. But John spoke the words anyway.
Sherlock I've told you, I have no problem answering your questions, I just don't thinkg we should get into it here, now, not like this.
"John you must try with all your strength not to die. I have..." Sherlock wasn't sure where he was going with this, he just knew he would say or do anything to keep John alive. "A secret...yes I have a secret to tell you which I obviously can not do, if you insist on dying."
John held him so tight Sherlock could feel his ribs give under the pressure, and then there where whispers against his neck soft and low like a lover should but the words where wrong.
Mercy didn't ask what John's definition of 'next to nothing' was, she'd worked in the field with him for years and 'next to nothing' was not in his playbook.
No one knew where they'd come from and apparently no one cared. The invitation of the mystery was too tantalizing for any amount of caution. Sherlock thought it was stupid. Who would want to play a game of risk and exposure with people you don't know? Mostly he was turned off by the prospect of people. The other bits where rather interesting if he were honest. But it didn't matter one way or the other because Sherlock wasn't one of the chosen students to receive a flyer on his door. Not the he wanted some idiotic invite to a childish game. Well maybe for the research. Into human behavior. Sherlock did know a couple of the people that had gotten flyers and was relatively certain that he could gain some decent (even if it wasn't completely accurate) information on the whole mystery from one of them. Sherlock took a deep breath and resigned himself to the fact that he was going to have to deal with Irene Adler. He sighed. He and Irene were friends of sorts. He'd known her for the two years he'd been at King's, and they got on well enough. She wasn't a complete moron and even though she continually made useless attempts to get in his trousers (that were by now almost obligatory)she did have a wicked sense of humor and an odd kind of affection for Sherlock and she was always up for a bit of mischief. So Sherlock didn't think it would be to much trouble to convince her to his plan.
“Lier!” Sherlock tried to fane anger but fell short of believable due to his radiant smile and infectious laughter.
“Cheeky Monkey.” John grinned and kissed back still holding Sherlock by the waist. “You’re going to blow my cover.”
There was no awkwardness. No fumbling, their motions were a study in perfection. John was first to shed his clothes and the sight of him naked and hard, stopped Sherlock cold. Holy fuck. Sherlock blinked for a moment stunned at the sight. He’d known, of course he’d known, but seeing was....mouthwatering. Sherlock came back to himself. He disrobed more slowly now, touching his own body in enticing ways and places making a show of his nudity. John was going to be formidable. But not yet, first he would have to endure.
Sherlock stopped just inside the temple just out of John’s reach. He was dressed in a black kurta that he wore with causal regal bearing. This...this impossible beauty...this relentless madman...was the last thing John had expected to find here. But find him he had and dear God how he loved this man.
“We’ll be at Tartarus in time for fireworks.” John squinted into the wind as he headed back to Baker Street.
The sound of the mobile was blaring to Johns ears. He had only fallen asleep an hour ago and the sun was barely up even now. Sherlock was like a twenty year old in a cock candy store. He reluctantly turned his face away from the honey scented curls he had been breathing in and gopped for his mobile off Sherlock's nightstand, his voice was ragged.
“CUT THE FUCKING LINK!” John ended the call by hurling his mobile against the wall with enough force to leave it in unrecognizable bits.
"Oh bloody fine." Sherlock sat his glass down closed his eyes, stuck out his tongue and tilted his head back as if that would help. John laughed softly and places the tips of his fingers under Sherlock's up turned chin trying to help him reach. Sherlock opened his eyes and held John's stare, closing his mouth and bring his head back down. Their eye contact was dangerous, and John could see Sherlock's Adam's apple bob nervously. John's hand stayed in place just a second longer than necessary. His thumb brushed Sherlock's jawline and then it was gone. Sherlock sucked in a somewhat ragged breath and looked down into his glass.
Sherlock undid his jeans and looked up at John through his lashes as he bent over and slowly slid his hands first over the lush curve of his ass down the backs of his thighs and over muscular calfs until he stood there in a pair of black boxer briefs that John was certain were illegal. Sherlock bit at the corner of his lower lip, he made quite the show of slipping his too long fingers into the waistband of his briefs and sliding them far too slowly over the growing bulge of his cock.
~Mr. Holmes, I enjoyed my time with your doctor so much. I think I'd like to see him again. Would you mind?~
“Stop. You’re half right. It’s not what I enjoy most. But I do like it, just with the right person.”
Sherlock was paralyzed. A bucket of ice water being tossed on him by a purple elephant would have been less shocking.
“Sherlock.” John fixed him with a wolffish deep blue stare that came to rest on Sherlock’s lush mouth. “You are fucking perfection.” John put a hand on Sherlock's jawline cupping his face and slowly rubbing the rough pad of his thumb over Sherlock’s slightly parted plush bottom lip transfixed by the motion as he spoke. “As much as I wish that I could bend you over this seat and fuck you to tears, we have a mission and I need you in full control of that brilliant mind of yours.”  Before John could drop his hand away Sherlock caught the tip of John’s thumb between his lips and sucked gently, John shut his eyes and pulled a hiss like breath through his teeth. Sherlock licked his tongue over the rough digit for good measure. John let his eyes drift open and held Sherlock in his lust filled gaze, a slow half cocked smile set hot butterflies in motion in Sherlock's stomach. The moment was more powerful then Sherlock could bear and he quickly sought to change the mood suddenly fully aware of the fire he’d been playing with.
“I’m fine Mercy.” John’s voice was choked with pain but firm. "How long was I out?! Is Methos, on the move?” John sat up on his elbows and then to a sitting position, patting his hands over his chest feeling for damage.
"Soon." Sherlock rolled away and went to the loo. "We have a busy day tomorrow." Sherlocks tone was playful. He came back with a warm cloth for John.
"Sounds...interesting. How would it work?" Sherlock held out his  long arm and shook his glass for a refill. John obliged and topped his own off as well.
"John I need you to go to that game. I believe it's important that I know everything that takes place from start to finish." Sherlock was urgent.
“Alright alright, just will you come?” Lestrade looked as if he were about to make one last attempt and that’s when Sherlock took action, he took the D.I. by the arm and lead him none too gently back down the seventeen steps.
"Come on then." John gestured towards Sherlock's chair as he took his own. Sherlock sat down and tried to compose himself. He cleared his throat.
"Told you." John threw back the rest of his pint and stood up. "I leave you in charge of the the boys. Don't let Pipin get out of hand and make sure Seth gose home with Liam."
John stared down into his empty rock glass, and weighed his options. One he could simply get up and let the slobbering cock of a man have the bar stool that he clearly believed was his  precious, or two he could teach him Newton's third law of motion.
John on the other hand said the words like he was born to them. When they woke in the morning under the sheets together with the sunlight barely there, noses brushing lips a whisper away. “I love you.” Midday over the rim of his tea cup. “I love you.” And so so late into the night spent with a hint of Gaelic in his voice. “God how I love you.”
“Yes well one can never be too...” he let the words trail off and waved them away dismissively. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Aren’t you just the bell of the ball. The Russian’s. The Russian’s wanted you. They wanted you very much. How did that feel?”
John made his way to the safe house. Once there he sat on the dingy cot of a bed and looked about his hot dusty surroundings. He was tired, not the tired of a long stretch of days, but weary of this life. He needed Scotland. He needed London. London was cool and beautiful right now, just like Sherlock. John picked up his mobile.
Once they slipped into Sherlock's bedroom, and down onto his lush bed, John took Sherlock in his mouth and the man fairy purred, aching his hips up to met John's mouth digging his heels into the bed whispering, pleading, praying John's name over and over, begging for release. But John would not be so kind, he pressed slick fingers into Sherlock's body, deep and rhythmic driving Sherlock mad. It was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen, Sherlock, pale skin dotted with bit marks, John's name on his swollen lips, and his cock flushed and hard against his belly. That was until Sherlock reached his long slender fingers around the thick length of Johns cock twisting and rubbing slick over the head.
John's mind had begun to wander toward his previous thoughts. Sherlock's innocent questions sounded anything but to John's brain which was currently enjoying cousin Brandabas's very fine scotch.  "Humm?"
“Hindi. I know. Fuck.” John had done his due diligence on Moran. He had been a solider, a rather good one in fact and now he was God only knew what and lover to a psychopath. What else Moran was John wasn’t sure but all of Johns training told him that Moran and his Magpie lover where not friends of the crown. Therefore not friends of his. The only solace was the fact that the most dangerous half of the criminally insane duo would be with John and not somewhere prowling around Sherlock. . “How long?”
"So which one was it this time Watson, the bird or the bloke?" Greg asked as he rounder the pitch after his lap.
"Vividly. It was right after you exposed his affairs. I thought he was going to kick you out on your ares that very second or strangle you to death."
“God woman! You’re just as vexing as you’ve ever been.” Sherlock tried to sound irritated but it was hard to hide the smile in his voice.
“He’s quite fit your mate, how did a Freak like you get a man like that to go anywhere with him? Did you pay him to pretend to be your friend? Caused you’d have to pay me.” Sally talked more to herself then to Sherlock.  “I may have a run at that one. May even have to thank you later Freak.”
“Drug trafficking in the Golden Triangle. You’ll have a deep cover partner.” Mercy’s silence was too long.
"You didn't text me. You came right here from the station house. Something's wrong. With John?" Sherlock ripped the paper from Greg's hand before he could truly offer it to him.
“Oh Tiger. Look at you all jealous. No, no I think the pretty one stays. He may provide us both some fun yet.” Jim straddled Sebastian sitting in one of the big leather arm chairs.
"Please John. Can we... can I...try again?" It was difficult for Sherlock to say the words but if there was ever a time for him to be humble it was now when this man the only man who would ever matter was about to walk out of his life.
"Project?" John questioned. Paul, just  looked at him again in that jerky sideways way he had, before walking off.
"What on earth happened to you? Who did this Sherlock? You have to go to the dean, why didn't you call me?"
That was a lie. Sherlock saw it clearly. The hesitation in his voice was the only confirmation he needed; the stumbling over the rushed words like a river over rocks. Along with the picking at his cuticles as he shuffled his weight onto one foot from the other, it was easy to see just how anxious really John was.
Maybe it was better that way. After all, that’s what the problem had initially been about. That was why they were standing alone in the middle of the park, facing one another at either ends of the path like the setup for a gunfight in a stereotypical cowboy movie. A very bad stereotypical cowboy movie, in which one of the cowboys wouldn’t pull out his gun. He’d let the bullet come to him instead.
“Sherlock has every right to keep secrets from you,” a small voice reminded him, while he lay stretched out across the sofa that night. “You’ve been a total bastard.”
The alley was dingy and dirty, with rubbish littering the floor and puddles of mush strewed along the side of walls. Before Sherlock could put John down properly, he'd leapt away from him and was looking very red.
"Oh, well, thank you anyway." He turned on his heel before making his way back down the corridor and through the double doors, leaving the two guards shaking their heads and tittering short laughs.
He’d even blamed Sherlock for Mary’s death, and Sherlock hadn’t had chance to explain himself before John steamrollered over their friendship with his mourning.
“You’re a Saint, John. Honestly. I don’t know how you put up with him. I’d have checked him in somewhere by now.”

Frowning, Sherlock put the badge back on and sat down opposite her, not being able to contain his glare while she fumbled around with forms.
“And then you follow it around and get to Baker Street,” Sherlock said. “Past The Landmark where you and Mary - I’m sorry, John, I know you’re trying to help but it’s really not –“
“But I can hear him coughing, John,” she had said the previous evening. “I need to make sure he’s looking after himself. I’ll make him some biscuits!”
"Think of it as payback for you punching me," he offered, before pausing. "Who told you about me?" He quizzed, eyebrows narrowing. John's smile dropped, and he frowned.
Sherlock nodded. He wasn’t quite sure what to reply to John’s anecdote; John’s consistent laments about Mary’s death had darkened any of the positive factors of their relationship. The usual husband and wife things had been overshadowed by their extended lives, and it didn’t help that Mary had done a runner to Morocco.
It occurred to John then that Rosie would fall down the typical trap of naming her child after a deceased relative. Which, John conceded, there wasn’t really a fault with, but somehow he felt that Rosie would be doing her unborn daughter a disservice to a woman who had brought about so much calamity to their lives.

Sherlock shook himself mentally, putting thoughts of John’s apparent anthropomorphism to the side, ready to think about a bit later on when he was less tired and less injured.
“You really need to get that cut checked,” he said. “Please. I know what I’m talking about, I’m a doctor.”
“You’re going to do great things, Sherlock,” John told him, smiling warmly. “I know you are. And while I’m at war patching up bullet holes, I know that you’ll be busy doing whatever makes you happy.”
“Actually,” John began, unfazed by the topic of the book. “I think I'm going to stay here for a bit,” Sherlock made a mental note of how quickly Jim’s expression changed again. Apparently John noticed it too, because he hurriedly began stuttering an explanation. “I want to find a book I was reading a while ago, when I was in Afghanistan,” he supplied. “My friend over there published it. Thought it might give it a read, if I can find it.”
His overall build was different to Jim's, too. Jim was wearing a bespoke, fine-cut suit. It was of a rich navy material; almost black; with not a speck of dust visible. His shoes shone, making the reflection of the lights above look like the moon against the black oxfords. It was clear that he was muscular underneath the suit, although not as strong as the man standing opposite him.
Mrs Hudson would have considered herself a fool if she hadn’t realised what was going on between Sherlock and John. She had known it the moment John had walked into Baker Street that day; Sherlock could offer some intricate deduction filled with needlessly scientific facts about John’s right shoe’s aglet, but she didn’t need any of that. She knew the expression of a man who was both determined and in love.
“Thanks,” he said, smiling at the memory stick as he turned it in his hand. “And you’re right. I haven’t been sleeping very well.”
"Things got a bit confusing," John offered simply, still smiling. "Come on, we need to get out of here."
He opened his mouth to make what John could only assume would be a derivative comment, but it got lost somewhere along the way.
“Would you ever have one?” He asked after a few moments of silence, punctuated only by Rosie's quiet squeaks and gurgles.
Absently, Sherlock wondered which part of the lie John was unsure about. He suspected the first part, but John neither confirmed nor denied those suspicions.
“Everything alright?” John asked, looking up at him as they walked side-by-side. “You look a bit agitated. We can stop.”
Sherlock leaned back and traced her thumb over her bottom lip. "I thought I'd give it a go," she mused aloud, just as John sat up and pulled Sherlock onto her lap.
A few paces in front of him, John stopped walking just short of a small puddle that had gathered in the dips of the pavement. It's leaf infested contents rippled as the wind skipped across it, seemingly bypassing John altogether and hitting Sherlock full on. It had only just stopped raining, but the air was still heavy and damp; clouded by the petrichor.
“I know.” Sherlock nodded, turning to face him. “But I didn’t lie to you. I just omitted the whole truth.”
"Yes...?" John nodded, frowning slightly as she leaned forward in a feeble attempt to get closer to it. If she pretended to be amazed at Sherlock's spectacular find, then Sherlock would either call her bluff or expect her to know every topic of the one under question. Neither of these options were especially brilliant, so John opted instead for the truth.
He imagined not feeling so alone when he woke up in the middle of the night with no one to talk to about what was on his mind.
Sherlock was crouching down in the centre of the river channel, bum almost touching the rippling current as rummaged around in the stream, turning over a pebble. Her dark brown hair glistened in the messy bun it was tied up in, and a smug grin settled across John’s face. She'd helped to wash Sherlock’s hair that morning.
"Urm...." She began, taking off her bag and throwing it into the river bank to join the cider. Sherlock watched her eagerly. "Rocks are eroded as they're taken downstream?" She guessed, and Sherlock nodded slowly. John bristled slightly, pleased she'd managed to get something right. "But this rock is not as rounded as the others, meaning that it doesn't belong to this section of the river? So someone's moved it? I don't know, Sherlock, I do Biology, English and History, you know I don't do Geography. I haven't done it since GCSE..."
John hung up and shoved his phone back into his pocket. He was back in his room, Sherlock having vacated it shortly after their stunted conversation and dived straight into the shower.
Sherlock took this opportunity to drink John in. His sun gold skin, wind burnt cheeks, tousled hair, and sparkling ocean blue eyes. He was handsome. John felt the heat of the scrutiny and it made him bold. He leaned close to Sherlock's slightly up turned face. "I can't wait to kiss you."
“Hello Love. I know you already live under a certain level of surveillance and protection, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to sleep at night. And I can’t do that unless my people have eyes on you while I can’t. So I’ve taken the liberty of setting up a few things in my absence. Please understand.”
Trousers that are suddenly in the way, Sherlock immediately begins to shed them rocking and pulling awkwardly on his knees finally exposing long limbs and long cock that John doesn’t hesitate to kiss and slid into his mouth. This wins John a satisfying jerk of Sherlock’s whole body, so he swallows him again and again in a fevered rhythm, Sherlock’s thighs quiver and give out, landing him on his back under a hungry predator. John practically rips off his own clothing.
"Why? So we can "get to know one another " find out each other's bad habits, and nasty little secrets, what's your favorite jumper, how I take my tea, that my parents are boring, or that Harry, is your sister, we've talked John. We've talked for years. And it has been agonizingly slow. "
"Mycroft, this is in large part my doing. It's important to me that I at least try to put things right. Send as many of your people as you feel comfortable with I won't antagonize a single one. But no matter what, I’m going.”
"We have to stop." John's chest heaved, his whole body felt taunt and hot, his arms shook from trying to keep his body aloft for fear that contact would be his undoing.
"This letter." John held up the piece of stationary that Sherlock could see was his favorite brand. "True north, always whatever. This letter." John felt silly repeating the words that had brought him to tears the day before.
Damp curls clung to the side of John's face as held tight a still shaking Sherlock. John kissed his neck, his shoulder.
"Besides, Lestrade, practically ordered us to "sort our shit out" it would be dereliction of duty if we didn't." Sherlock had walked away from John at this point and was waiting at the threshold to his room. "Coming?" He said over his shoulder giving John the most perfect view of his bottom.
It was him. He was on the floor in an incredibly small ball. There was no movement. No sound. Still silence. John moved on auto pilot, pushing up his balaclava and pulling off his tactical glove with his teeth ready to do what he'd done thousands of times, check for a pulse, the soft flutter of life flowing just beneath the surface. Please...
“No more then you’ve done to me.” Sherlock rubbed his curls against John’s face like a contented cat.
"Shut it while I think of my first question." John closed his eyes, trying to think of all the things he had always wanted to know about Sherlock Holmes. 20 questions wasn't going to be enough he mused.
"Fine. But we're going to need more scotch." John gestured for Sherlock to go make a new selection. With a raised eyebrow the younger man took off. Sherlock came back with a bottle of Macallan Sherrywood 40 year old single malt scotch that cousin Brandabas was sure to miss. Sherlock sank back down on the floor across from John in the same manner as before. Toes brushing waist band. He pored a rock glass for John one for himself and settled in.
"But it was obvious that Dr. Harlow, and the coroner's were working together and I should have seen the puncture mark behind the ear, They have been killing patients and selling organs on the black market for years and I missed it! I missed it and I'm stupid." Sherlock was almost whining he was so distressed by his mistake.
John literally fell over with a hoot of laughter sprawled  snorting on the floor in tears clutching his stomach. Sherlock watched confused and concerned. Winded and hiccuping John tried to compose himself wiping tears from his eyes. “No love I am not a virgin. Far from it in fact.” John tried not to let laughter trickle back in.
John loomed above standing by the bed and looked down at him. “Your wounds need to be cleaned and redressed. Sir.”
"I think he's something of a spy" Sherlock went to the desk where the man had been looking. "He was getting the lay of the flat, and making certain he had the right place." John watched as one of the officers couldn't take his eyes off Sherlock's bottom as he moved about.
“Where are we then?” Sherlock painfully pulled himself up to a sitting position on the cot he’d been placed on.
“Not my type.” Sebastian tried to remain stoic, but was losing the fight with Jim moving in just the right rhythm on his lap.
"Dose your friend have a name?" Now it was John who was turning on the charm, and woe betied anyone in his radius.
"Not happening. Until I can gain some ground on this I don't want any of you near it. All intel comes directly through me and no one moves on it unless I say so.  This is one danger I won't put any of you in the path of."
"Alright, alright. What was the question? Something about sleeping. Yes. Okay. So how do I sleep? Yes? I sleep...all over, and naked. All of the above and none of the above. There."
"No. He's...like an animal that's tasted blood. He's had you, so to speak. And he wants more. To finish what he started." Sherlock seemed to have trouble explaining the whole thing as if it where distasteful. "John, won't you just..."
John hesitated at the door for a second. There really wasn't any more damage they could do to each other was there. John opened the door and stepped in.
"You're such an idiot. I didn't leave because I stopped loving you,  I left because I couldn't stop loving you. Never have. Never will."
“I know just warning up the crowd.” Moran slouched down comfortably in his chair lit up a fag and singled for a coffee, the man was totally at home in this land. He knew the language and the coutumes as if he were born to them. That fact certainly gave him the upper hand in this opt. This long fucking opt that was falling apart at John’s feet. It seemed that everything that could go wrong had. It was no wonder then that things were not progressing as scheduled and it looked more and more like John would be here longer then expect. Fuck. All he wanted was to get back to somewhere even close to Sherlock. Fuck. But first things first.
"Mmm. True, but I can't pull the rest of the team it nearly got us all killed when I left. Kronos has their hands full with Yaponchik..."
I know what we're going through but please. Please. I can't breathe if I can't trust that you're safe.
"I know that feeling. Every time I close my eyes, you're there. You've always been there. Here." John fisted his hand in his jacket over his heart. The room was tiny, and if John just stretched out his arm he could nearly touch Sherlock sitting in a black swivel chair facing the mirror. John watched as Sherlock's eyes drifted closed and his head lulled. Then he spoke. His beautiful voice an angry hatful whisper.
"Dr. Watson, whereas we may both want the same thing, I'm the only one who can actually provide it. You foster chaos, and clean up. It's not the same as true safety."
Sherlock huffed. "I know. It's truly pathetic I've let myself fall so far." Sherlock sounded defeated as he waved a cigaretted hand in the air.
Sherlock took John's mouth and kissed him deeply before a sob of joy and mangled sadness escaped his own lips. The kiss was desperate, Sherlock was trying to give John all the love that swelled up in him that he would never be able to let John know he held.
John wondered around the castle unnoticed in the hustle and bustle. He glanced into the nave of the chapel at the chosen few in attendance. Friends he hadn't spoken to in months no matter how doggedly they tried to get in touch. John couldn't bare Mrs. Hudson's pleas for him to return, or Lestrade, and his constant updates on Sherlock's cases and his boredom, or Mycroft's thinly veiled threats and innuendos. If he couldn't be with Sherlock then he also couldn't live at the edge of his world. But this new knowledge had thrown him back in to it way over his head. John found the solar with Sherlock's initials on it. John smoothed his hands over his best midnight blue suit  (that Sherlock had given him and John felt was wildly over priced)  before stepped through the doors none too quietly. "I half expected you to be in some white frock. "
"Nope." Sherlock popped the "p" with a nice loud smack. John giggled. He always loved it when Sherlock did that. It was silly and endearing, not to mention just how lovely it made his already perfect Cupid's bow mouth.
"Sherlock, I love you. More then anything in this world. And I'm so so sorry for the things I've done to you. And if you let me I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. And trying my best to make you happy. I don't deserve your forgiveness..."
As it turned out the third time was the charm and they got the information they were after. John called in the pre planned air strike and his team was at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center by early evening the next day.
"Fine. Well...ok. So. In light of new developments I guess it's an unfair question. Admirable then."
Trevor scoffed and grinned. He was bigger then John and therefore confident in his persevered advantage. A common mistake, and Trevor's third.
"He lost ten thousand euro and he's looking to recoup it in an invite only private game back in London in two days time."
Sherlock skidded a bit in his efforts not to topple right over John as they clashed into each other. John steadied Sherlock by the shoulders holding him just short of arms length. John looked him in the eye and nodded. Sure he had Sherlock’s attention he started to speak.
"I don't believe you." Sherlock said defiantly with tears in his eyes at the mental picture of his broken Doctor.
"I don't know. You and a baby. Little boy, bright blue eyes. Thick curls. Maybe you should give it some thought. But for now considering what we do for a living maybe a dog. Children later, when things are less...."
“It’s the middle of the day with a house positively abuzz with people.” Sherlock made this observation as he toed off his shoes slipped languorously out of his jacket and crawled up the bed in a slinky hip winding motion that John knew well.
"Aside from the fact that I have a whole rugby team behind me? Me. I, can make you leave." The steel in John's voice was now unmistakable. Thomas heard it too.
“Please. Please don’t. If you do and I can’t be with you every second of every day. I’ll die. I can’t.”
“Ah, ah, ah. As a rule I don’t generally hit women unless they pick a fight. Are you picking a fight Sgt. Donovan?”
“It’s not a request. John Watson, is a high ranking SAS agent and more dangerous then you can imagine. If you align yourself with him you’ll put yourself in danger, not to mention jeopardizing whatever mission he’s tasked with. You can not see him!”
“I think I’d rather like other things in you as well.” Sherlock paused, giving John a hot focused look, his baritone laden with sex. "I want you.”
"Skyreholme. Near Appltreewick, Skipton, North Yorkshire." John was fighting back tears, his lips pressed in a thin sever line. "That's where we are."
Sherlock milled about the festivities trying to avoid as many chreey people as possible staying to the corners and keeping his eye on John who was now engaged in a very animated conversation with Lestrade, Hillsten, and Collins about rugby over football. Boys Sherlock mused. Sherlock took another turn around the room and nearly bumped into Molly.
John sat on the alter and watched Sherlock collecting scattered clothes he looked like a porcelain God in the wrong Eden.
Irene stepped back into the cool air of the hotel room, leaving the terrace doors open and the bright dessert sun behind her enjoying the mixture of hot and cold. She accepted the cup of tea that was offered to her and sat down across from her savior.
John laughed and rushed him. Grabbing Sherlock hard pulling him close by his clothes his arms, his hair, anything within reach in a savage kiss. This was the kiss John had been longing for since Sherlock’s little shower stunt. Their hands fought to grip and grind into each other. John finding Sherlock’s bottom and pressing into him. Sherlock moved his hands over John’s face and neck and shoulders.
A very indulgent look at Sherlock's bedroom (among other things) before he and John bed down for the night.
John scrambled to his feet but stayed as low as he could helping an unsteady Moran up. “Brilliant now let’s move out before we’re over run yeah.” John shouldered Moran’s weight and they headed away from strike zone.
The alley was littered with bodies, Sherlock frowned and gingerly stepped forward and around heading toward the figure standing at the opposite end of the alley. Sherlock was nearly within arms reach when John whirled on him lighting fast pulling him down and spinning Sherlock around with a knee in his back to keep him upright and a knife at is throat.
“Only for a second. Then he’d be crowding in with us and stealing your cigarette.” John said fondly and sadly.
"That's your takeaway from what I just told you? Odd family names?" Sherlock chuckled, and sipped at his drink.
Mercy was accustomed to delivering news of dangerous orders for sketchy locations with nefarious people, it was kind of her thing and she did it with just the right mix of tact and humor to make it acceptable. What wasn’t her thing was giving her brother information that would hurt him or throw him off his game. And if ever Mercy had seen a game changer Sherlock Holmes was it. John was the best. But love supersedes all in even the best of us.
John tipped his head toward the fire, and reached out to refill Sherlock scotch, handing it back to him he said.
“Hello Mercy. I’m leaving for Germany within the hour. Why the call?” John zipped his rifle case and took a seat in the black leather chair of his five star hotel room.
“Alright you prick.” John turned his back and Sherlock quickly resumed his position, but only for a moment. “Hale me a cab.” John said. Sherlock stepped to the curb and held up an arm and yelled “taxi!” And just like that magic happened. “Besides you told Gerald, you’d be there.”
"Uhuh." John pressed himself slow and deep into Sherlock and stopped. Sherlock bit his lips, squeezing his eyes shut his body trembled against John’s hips. “Not yet love.” John was enveloped in hungry limbs and soft wanton lips. "Let me have you a little longer." John whispered against Sherlocks lip."
Somewhere there exists a place were John and Sherlock have always been and will always be in perfect harmony. This is not that place.
John pounded a savage elbow once, twice, three, times into the side of the mans face, the man staggered reaching wildly for balance, John ripped the gun from his grip turned it on him and fired twice. John barely ducked a vicious in coming blow from behind seeing the burly man in his peripheral vision, John spun abruptly and forced his knife up into the mans solar plexus. He could feel the bone crack with the force of the blow and could have easily ripped the mans rib cage straight up and open. He didn’t.
John circled his own chair, clenching and unclenching his fist, chewing his bottom lip. John wasn't sure what corse of action to take. On the one hand he could...no he wanted to...no not that either. Just Sherlock. So fucking frustrating. Here. Alive and safe after all this time. John felt like he had been played for a fool. Sudden anger swelled to the surface and he rushed to grab Sherlock up out of his chair by his coat coller fully intending to shake the man, or pummel him, or choke him to death. But none of those things happened. Once he had Sherlock in his grasp, it was a dream come true and a screaming nightmare all at once. So near John could smell his familiar sent, feel the warmth of his lean frame radiate close to his own, see the frantic pulse in his throat, he wanted to cry, with joy and yell in anger. John was beaten. Sherlocks eyes where wide and panicked, just as he was jerked down into a harsh kiss.
Sherlock hesitated at the edge of John’s bed, fairly vibrating, fingers spidered up the bed sheet, he raised trembling hands to the sides of John’s golden weathered face, and kissed him slow and familiar, like a lover coming home after a long absence.
"Waiting for what exactly?" Sherlock purred suggestively, and flung the blanket off his naked body. John laughed, but couldn't help but notice the rose hues of arousal of Sherlock's skin.
“OH FOR FUCKS SAKE! YOU STUPID FUCKIN RUSSIAN BASTARDS! DO YOU NEVER GIVE UP?! DID YOU NOT SEE WHAT *JUST* HAPPENED TO THE LAST ONE?!” John screaming in fury his Gaelic accent bleeding through. John shoved his L9A1 in the small of his back and pulled a wicked looking hunting knife from his right boot. “Fine. If this is how you want to die, so be it. I’ll take him from you, slit your throat and watch you bleed out!” John licked his bottom lip, and bared his teeth a boiling rage corsed  through John’s vains making him more reckless and more deadly.
Sherlock had not missed John's use of the word "we" and he felt a thrill at the implications. Would that same "we" be pondering the thought of children one day? No, Sherlock couldn't think that John wanted those things with him. But why had he said we? It made no sense. John's next question snapped Sherlock's mind back.
"You're a doctor, think in clinical terms." Sherlock said decisively. John laughed. "What could you possibly find funny?"
"No, it's not this complicated because roles are clearly defined. I know what's expected of me, my partner, and the basic out come." John took a drink and was glad for the scotch running boldly through his vains. He was past the point of modesty.
"With the new information you got from Trevor, I was able to find out where our asset is currently located and roughly who put him there. It would seem that his captors are holding three civilian scientists along with Sherlock at the same location."

The door to Sherlock’s rooms were slightly open. Odd that. John pulled his weapon, and stepped inside.
"You've always been broken. So have I. Together is the only thing that fixes us. We where never ment to be apart."
"For what a doctor? I'll be fine. You can patch me up." Sherlock nodded and helped John walk to the sofa.
John sat up a little and Sherlock lay in the crook of John's arm and looked up at him. "You beautiful idiot. I have always been all yours. If this is what you want..."
“Nooo. No need to play the genius for me. I know who you really are Sherlock.” Victor ran his thumb over Sherlock’s lower lip and it made him shudder. Victor mistook the action for passion and not the revulsion that it was.
John mentally ran through the opt trying to ignore his own voice screaming in his head to fuck everything and tear the world apart to find Sherlock. "Track down Dutch, and get back to me." Dutch ran point on team Kronos, another SAS team that consisted of Dutch herself, Baron, King, Lord, and Priest.
“Tell me what you want?” Had John said “the heart from your chest” Sherlock would have carved it out and handed it to him then and there. They were both so raw from all that their whirlwind relationship had been. All the danger and the clandestine meetings.
"He's a civilian. In our safe house. It wasn't that long ago he was an asset." Bishop sat forward elbows resting on knees.
"Who?" Sherlock yawned his question and continued his hip motion, his hands now joining his travels along Johns back and shoulders, down to his bottom, and back up to start anew.
"It dose seem that not much occurred. But I have a feeling we're building towards something. Something wicked this way comes."
Sherlock thought he would cry, his heart beat was desperate. The world stopped, his breath stopped and everything focused into one blinding white hot point of surrender. Ever muscle coiled to the point of snapping he let go. “John, John....oh god fuck John!” Heat erupted between them as his cock spilled across their bellies.
"What are you doing here?"  Thomas asked as he an a couple of his mates sat behind Sherlock a few steps up.
"John, where are we? Some where in the contrary yes, but where I can't place the air. Is it Dorset, or maybe Cornwall. And the bees. There are bees somewhere yes? Why are there bees John?" Sherlock leaned heavily on the door frame, as he peppered John with questions, the short walk depleting what strength he had.
“There are other couples that mimic what we have. Why not them?” Sebastian didn’t really care, whatever Jim wanted he wanted. But he knew Jim enjoyed the game so he played along.
"When we...when I pushed you away all those months ago, from the second you where gone...I wanted you back." John paced slowly in front of Sherlock who sat legs Indian style on the sofa. "I hoped that we would find each other again one day. And if we did, I wanted a fresh start. Away from London. Away from our past, not forever. Just some place quite. If you don't like it...or you'd prefer to stay here alone, I'll understand. "
John tipped his head toward the fire, and reached out to refill Sherlock scotch, handing it back to him he said.
“Are you calling me a lier? And after such a long time apart.” Victor stood up from the sofa tall and imposing as always. Sherlock’s breath caught like a hot painful knot in his chest.
Afghanistan had made John a very light, discerning sleeper. He could tell the difference between the normal sounds of the flat from something out of the ordinary. This was the latter. John disentangled himself from a still sleeping Sherlock, wished he had brought his gun from upstairs, and creeped into the sitting room. The intruder was standing over the desk when John rushed behind him and placed the man in a choke hold. He struggled and sputtered as John increased pressure while trying to decide if he was going to break his neck or not. But John lost that option when the man swung his left elbow into Johns stitches dropping him to the floor. Sherlock had heard the commotion and rushed to the sitting room just in time to catch the man before he made the stairs. Sherlock ducked a blow and swung up into the mans jaw, staggering him backwards. He smacked his head on the table on the way down, knocking him out. Sherlock flipped on the lights to find John on the floor in a hep, bleeding.
“Getting you to stop seeing John Watson, obviously. Really Sherlock wheres your mind?” Mycroft was annoyed by all the talking.
"I don't know where his is." Johns voice broke the slightest bit. "Fuck you don't know where he is." John closed his eyes and made a sound that could only be called a sob. "Why are you here? Why are you here Mycroft? What the fuck do you want?" John leaned his head back on the sofa, eyes closed his glass resting in his lap, bottle white knuckled in his left hand.
"Brilliant work." John cut in and felt a surge of adrenaline, finally! "Send me the coordinates the extra bodies shouldn't be a problem..."
"Honestly you don't find it a bit strange that a third year from the states just abandons everything and leaves unannounced. His friends said he hadn't said a word about leaving. Quite the opposite in fact. They say he went to see the dean and oh...!"
Sherlock’s tongue was too skilled for words, knowing exactly how to lick and suck John into a blind frenzy. John thwaked his head against the stone wall hard and bucked his hips. He should have cared. But he didn’t. Couldn’t. All he cared about was cumming down that beautiful throat of Sherlock’s. He hadn’t  had anyone since Sherlock and it was all over so fast John would have been embarrassed had is brain been able to process anything other then “Sweet Holy Fuck Sherlock.” His body became one taut coil as Sherlock pressed John’s cock to the very back of his throat and swallowed him down.
"I'll take my doctors orders, but please tell me where we are." Sherlock's voice was weak and low from disuse.
“You know perfectly well what. Don’t play coy. Surely you didn’t come all this way just for little old me.”
John had long ago found that sometimes it was necessary to drug his assets for one reason or another. In this case it had been for the mans safety and comfort. As it turned out it had also save his asset from a long and dangerous ride and spared him having to watch John kill two fake Russian soldiers, at a fake Russian check point. So as he watched the man slowly coming to, he was confident that the ends justified the means. Let’s hope his asset felt the same.
John turned around to face Sherlock. “And I would let you. If it weren’t still mission critical.  Now keep what I’m sure is a lovely cock in your trousers for me just a little while longer.”Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed. John nodded and backed away before it was too late.
“And what is your thing then? I’d very much like to know.” She pushed her breast forward with zero finesse.
The air of mystery hung all around. Irene had arrived to a group of twelve that grew to a mir twenty.  The students were varied, and there seemed to be no discernible pattern. The questions and dares were random and all of what was to be expected from college students. By the end of the night Irene had given her bra to a lovely ginger girl she didn't know, there had been one strip tease, two silly dances, one slap, an exposed bum, a set of licked toes, and one young man had been outed as gay.
"What drama is this then? And is John part of that mass?" Irene went to the window and flung the curtains wide, when Sherlock didn't move Irene knew this was not his usual pout nor was John hidden beneath. So. She sat on the bed and waited. Sherlock's hand emerged from the mound he'd burrowed into. Irene passed him the cigarette without words despite her fire hazard concerns. Sherlock surfaced. A ceaseless stream of tears came from his red rimed eyes.
"Yes John." Sherlock rolled to his side and rested his mostly naked body against John. Jesus this was going to be a long night.
It’s all too much. Sherlock can’t breathe, he digs harsh fingertips into John’s thigh he trimbales and cries out as the stars behind his eyes seem to travel his whole body centering in his cock in an explosion of blinding white swirls around him. He hears his name being called breathless and desperate from a far off distance.
The entire team groaned and began to complain of sore limbs, and how they had run the play five times already and John was working them like the devil. There wasn't a clean one among them and most were at least a little bloody.
Helloo. TheColdEastWind here. It has been long and very long so let me just first say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and leave it at that. Now on a serious note, in this next chapter our story will be dealing with Sarin. It is a nerve gas, and absolutely horrendous. I don't go into any detail about its effects or what it can do, I just want to warn anyone who may feel uncomfortable with my usage of it.  Also there is mention of drug overdose, please heed all trigger warnings.
“No. You shouldn’t.” The words where out before John could stop himself.  Now it was John’s turn to blush.”Yes, you should. I have a job to do and I don’t want you anywhere near this.”
“And,” John turned to face Mycroft full on cutting off his attempt at threatening with his own steel conviction “if you send them my way I will send them back to you with their heads in a box! You have no one who can touch me. That’s not a boast, and we both know it. So unless you want me to burn through your people like paper dolls I suggest we cut the bullshit.”
"Indeed you did. And I told you, this isn't over." Sherlock said to the man and turned his back to leave. John didn't move.
Pope interjected clearly having Johns back. "It's a safe house where's the risk? And why he's here should be obvious."
"What's for the best? Tell me why he won't talk to me?! Dose this have anything to do with Shipton? Irene please. You're Sherlock's friend. You know what this is about."
“What will you do? What will you do after all this John?” Sherlock found that he was genuinely curious and could hold back the question no longer.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at his too thin reflection and grunted. His deep blue suit, his favorite suit, hung, where it use to hug. It was a disgrace to the art of bespoke tailoring. He felt awful may as well look the part.
It’s been nearly two months and you’ve not tried to get in contact with me, and now out of nowhere you ask me in a panic where I am.
I know this is crazy short, but it felt like the right place to break. Don't look at me like that, I'm still writing! I promise. Now for some numbers. 12.42 stone is 174lbs. And 170cm is 5'7. It makes no sense now,but trust me, it will come in handy later. Oh, please share your comments and let me know if you like the flow of the story. A thousand times thank you.
The wolf climbed back onto the bed and settled down. His whole body enveloped Sherlock and Sherlock found himself nestled in amongst the fur, completely safe as the wolf’s tail thumped gently on the bed.
I’ve written some prompts based on some songs, but please feel free to suggest something yourself. I’ll aim for each fic to be at least 1,000 words, the maximum being 5,000. Each fic will vary in length but I can’t make any promises on how long each individual fic will be.
As he attempted to calm himself down, his phone started to go off in his pocket. The vibration was a reminder that he wasn't enclosed, as was so often his irrational fear when suffering from a panic attack. He was getting much better at dealing with them though, and most of the time they merely caused him to be short of breath for a bit, in comparison to the vomiting he used to undergo.
The fact that Sherlock was aware of the technique and wasn’t criticising John for using it told John how much Sherlock needed it.
Within a few moments, they burst out into the open and Sherlock found himself gulping in the clean, crisp oxygen, sprawled out on the playground concrete with his Dad laying next to him. Raising his head, he watched on as the building he'd been standing in a few moments prior collapsed. Flames reaching into the air as the roof gave way, and smoke blossoming into the sky to join the pearly white clouds.
He’d been escorted out by security, leaving Sherlock on the floor, crying weakly. John had thought it was from the cracked ribs he’d given him, the cut in his mouth as blood mingled with saliva.
Sherlock hesitated. They were still shaking hands. He quickly retracted it. John could see that he was shaking.
She sighed quietly to herself as she heard the front door slam. It was almost sickening how often she had to get the hinges and locks fixed whenever John was around.
He imagined holidays where they could express themselves freely, away from the prying eyes of the man’s wife and away from the gossiping staff.
“Oh, but Sherlock, dear, you don’t look very well at all,” Mrs Hudson sighed, her voice dropping into that caring, sympathetic voice it always fell into when either Sherlock or John were ill.
“I’ll leave you boys to it,” she said, automatically gathering Sherlock’s empty mug as well as her own before she bustled off into the kitchen.
Therefore, by someone screeching his name, desperate to talk to him, having never met him before in a place where everyone knew his Ability, Sherlock couldn't help but panic.
16.	“Let’s not talk about hate when there’s hell to pay for your cowardice and my bad timing.” Our Perfect Disease, The Wombats
Sherlock frowned and reached over, feeling for the wolf. Instead, his hand fell upon a very hairy human chest. Sherlock stilled.
The staff also hadn’t said a word when Sherlock stole one of the cars, but that was a whole different story.
“No, Sherlock. The whole time I thought only of myself. Of how much I hurt. I didn’t think about how awful it was for you, what you had gone through. What had driven you to that-“
"You shit!" John yelled, grinning as she wiped away her now streaming mascara. Sherlock merely chuckled, still squatting in the stream and beaming toothily at John. John glared at her, but was unable to keep herself from giggling. "You're a complete and utter cock, you know that, don't you?" She chastised, before launching herself at Sherlock.
“Yeah, he’s fine. He’s been sleeping for most of the day. Yeah. No. It’s really not a good idea, Mrs H. Sherlock’s got it and I tested positive when I was last at work. No, I don’t have any symptoms. Asymptomatic. We can do our own laundry, but thank you for the offer. Nah, he’ll be fine. You know what he’s like. Okay. I think Sherlock will be fine in a couple of days so he’ll pop down to keep you company once he’s passed the seven day mark. Alright? Alright. Keep yourself safe. See you soon.”
John frowned slightly, looking between his daughter and son-in-law. They shared an excited smile with one another, Rosie’s hand in Tord’s and resting on the table.
He bounced down the stairs and held out his hand for Mike to shake. Mike shook it vigorously, utterly bewildered but grinning broadly.
With a gentle tug from Sherlock, the fire began letting off more smoke than was perhaps usual for such a small flicker, but it was enough. Within a few moments the alarm began screaming, sending the whole building in panic.
“Is that nice?” He asked, as a great furry head was pushed against his hand. “Is that good?” Sherlock chuckled and the beast moved forwards, and suddenly Sherlock realised that the sandpaper he’d felt was actually a tongue. It scratched his face again, and Sherlock chuckled. The thumping was a tail against the duvet.
He couldn’t believe he’d stumbled into his soulmate at the park, only for him to be a mutual friend. The normality of it made him want to puke. He may as well have met John at a wedding, it equated to the same level of mundaneness.
In each one of these ring binders were extensive reports regarding Sherlock and his Ability. He gently kicked one of them. If only he could get away with burning them. Then he'd have one less thing to worry about; aside from losing his temper.
"Break their neck of you want," they'd say to the newer members, "but break their neck by using your Ability and you're out."
John didn't say a word, nodding curtly instead at the silent communication between them both. Whether Sherlock had momentarily gone deaf or whether they were talking to one another telepathically was a mystery to him, but something had been said between and it was clear that John had been completely put-down by Jim.
Sherlock scrunched his face up. The only information his brain could supply was that it felt exactly like when he was a child and Redbeard would lick his face.
John’s shoulders visibly relaxed, and he beamed. He knew that Sherlock’s expression was aimed at the expectations of a new relationship, rather than the concept of a relationship with him.
“John,” Harry sighed. “There’s nothing wrong with you, alright? Now can you cut out your teenage angst bullshit? You’ll meet your soulmate. Just wait.”
He hadn’t suspected that when he deigned to look up at the man, that colour would suddenly rupture his thoughts and render him temporarily blinded by the brightness of the world.
Molly offered him a small, sheepish smile, which Sherlock did his best to return. It came out as a pained grimace.
“And you’re the opposite?” John questioned. “You… enjoy murder? And violence? Serial killers and beheadings?”
“Wizards are real?” He asked immediately. “What is a muggle? A muggle is someone who doesn’t know about wizards… Am I a muggle?”
It probably wasn't good to mimic a fire being started in a parliamentary building, but Sherlock didn't care. In fact, he rather enjoyed it.
He watched him thoughtfully as John jogged a couple of steps ahead. From this angle, Sherlock could clearly make out a few features of him that he'd previously overlooked.
The man’s voice faltered, his eyes softened. Where his brows were once furrowed they were now raised, something akin to wonder etched across his face.
“There are whispers,” Sherlock said, turning back around to face him. “Yesterday I caught a few of them, and I’m afraid I can’t be any clearer than that, as I am only beginning to put the pieces together myself. There is something dark on the horizon, John, and we are better facing it together than we are apart.”
“Oh, sorry. Off track a bit.” Sherlock smiles. “What I’m trying to say is that despite everything, no, because of everything, you don’t have to say what you were going to say because I already know.”
“There's a good boy,” Jim smiled, his voice thick with misplaced warmth. The condescension in his praise made Sherlock want to kick something; Jim pulled John forward, wrapping his arm around his neck and pushing the forlorn man into his torso, so as to act out one of the most false hugs Sherlock had ever been forced to witness.
A police car drove past, and Sherlock opened his eyes again. His eyes narrowed as he followed the car, and it pulled up next to a police officer hanging around outside a semi-detached house in the centre of the street.
“What for?” Sherlock asked, his right knee bouncing out of control. He pulled away slightly and looked up at John. “I’m fine, I’m sure I’m just coming down with a cold.”
“You’re not going to die,” Harry sighed, as John gripped onto her, his arms barely long enough to hug her properly but the intention was there. Harry rocked him gently. “I’m here to look after you, okay? Otherwise I’d have sent you out alone and locked the door behind you.”
“Drop it, Sherlock. It’s fine. I don’t care that you - I mean, it doesn’t matter that you... I’m going for a shower.”
He’d looked calm. Peaceful. And as he shifted John saw Sherlock’s eyelids flutter as he dreamed and John’s heart warmed a little.
Sherlock pulled his phone from his trouser pocket and John mimicked him. They exchanged numbers swiftly, and John smiled when he noticed that throughout their interaction Sherlock had developed a deep crimson blush.
“We’ll get on the A3220,” Sherlock said, swallowing thickly. “Urm. West Cross Route, I think. John, I can’t do this. This was a mistake.”
“That’s him?” John asked. He stood at Sherlock’s side. The wind rustled the trees standing like soldiers along the edge of the road, and above them another plane furthered it’s descent.
“No, I didn’t make it with Rosie,” she said, “it was on John’s fridge. It’s alright that I gave it to him, isn’t it?” She asked quickly, turning to John. “I presumed it was meant for him but you kept forgetting it.”
For one, his blonde hair was scruffy. It wasn't by any means long, but it stuck out at odd angles in great fluffy spikes. The back of it was flattened from where it had collided with the wall, but Sherlock distinctly noted the way it curled atop the boy's crown, like a tornado of blonde as it fanned out to the rest of his head.
The man smirked, glancing towards his colleague knowingly. As the silent words were exchanged, Sherlock quickly moved forwards and grabbed the walkie-talkie from the man's belt, before keeping it tightly in his grasp behind his back.
“I’m sure he’ll appreciate it,” John said, smiling despite his best efforts. “I’ll send him down as soon as he’s better.”
“It’s a lovely neighbourhood,” Molly piped up as she looked between Sherlock and John. “I worked at St George’s before St Bart’s and my old boss had a house in Southfields. He’d invite us over for BBQs and stuff. It is so different to central. Very different to Baker Street.” Molly sipped her wine and watched Sherlock, who remained silent.
Now, Sherlock was sat at the kitchen table, glaring absolute daggers at John while nursing a very potent hot chocolate with a shot of Bailey’s in it.
I didn’t say it in the first chapter, but I’m currently taking fanfic requests. These are totally free, and they’re being done in the hope of cheering people up during this chaotic pandemic.
“Okay. I'll send someone to pick you up in an hour or so. Is that alright, babe?” Instead of looking at Jim, John remained staring at the place where Sherlock had been. Jim noticed this, and his short-tempered fuse blew once again. “What the hell are you looking at?” He demanded, squaring up to John. John quickly backed out of his trance, going slightly pale as Jim took a step closer. There was hardly room for breath between them; John’s chest seemed to have stopped rising and falling under his thick jumper as he stared fearfully up at the man; his whole being frozen as Jim set ablaze.
Harry began sprinting, holding John close as he ran back through the forest as whatever it was that had caused John to scream charged after them, its feet hitting the forest floor like drums.
“No, you can't. Can you?” Sherlock said, smile faltering as he chanced a glance back towards John. His head was tilted slightly, face heavily lined with confusion, and there were those eyes again. Narrowed as he tried to work Sherlock out: it was so easy. So easy to read the hesitation. Sherlock sighed. “Well that's one thing I've got going for me, I suppose.”
“But what if you had?” John asked. “What if you had? And then you came back and I hurt you. I was so angry. I was so, so angry, and you were still injured. Mycroft showed me the files. I know the basis. Sherlock, that infection-“
Shooting up like a Jack in the Box, Sherlock stared in bewilderment as smoke began unfurling around the corner. Simultaneously, both Jason's and Isabelle's laminated pictures erupted into flames, and Sherlock yelped as the rest followed suit.
Sherlock stopped dead when he heard a crash, then a bang, and then a loud thud from the kitchen. The wolf growled at something, then trotted back in, holding a box of paracetamol in his mouth. It dropped the paracetamol into Sherlock’s lap, then sat down and watched him, it’s tail thumping on the ground again.
"She's, ah," he paused, leaning in slightly and keeping his voice low. "She's a bit particular about the badge... This is the third time I've lost it this month."
Sherlock shifted his weight from one foot to the other. His curls jostled in the wind and he pressed his nose into his scarf.
He estimated that Sherlock was late twenties, if not early thirties. Sherlock’s bed was a mess, and the radiator on full blast. John smiled. It was nice to see a space that was completely lived in. He had grown so used to his pokey flat, a place where he slept, where he ate, where he simply existed, that he had completely forgotten that people were supposed to enjoy where they lived.
John  been up for most of the night. Every time he closed his eyes remnants of Afghanistan exploded across his dreams and the shrapnel tore into his slumber. He’d woken sweaty, shivering, and completely on edge for fear he’d climb out of bed and step on an explosive.
Suddenly, his face felt scratchy. There was a weight pressing down on him, shielding him from the men. Something snarled and whatever was protecting Sherlock vibrated as another snarl sliced the air.
Sergeant Rose turned white. He was surrounded now. John, Sherlock and Lestrade stood directly in front of him, and more officers joining them in an impenetrable circle.
I apologize for the shortness of this chapter, but it's been a while since I updated so I really wanted to put out what I had done.
"Yes well if I'm going to be an idiot at lest I'm in good company." He winked at John and took a long sip.
“William you old so and so.” Moran was loud but that was the plan draw attention. Moran was putting on a show for his buyers with his rich Scottish contact.
It wasn't a request, it was an order. John was cold. Angry. Hurt. Sherlock did as he was told and awaited farther instructions. In the two years Sherlock, had been gone he'd had his life threatened numerous times, fear of death, fear of capture, fear of discovery had been his constant companion. But none of that came close to the chilling threat that was John Watson. Now this was not to say that Sherlock was afraid of John. Because he wasn't, and not because he doubted Johns ability to kill him with his bare hands because he did not. It was just that he had no fear that John would hurt him and if he did then so be it. It was John, after all and whatever he did was perfectly acceptable. Therefor Sherlock was afraid of his fate, but accepting none the less.
Deep cover. The words fell like rocks in the pit of his stomach. Undercover opts meant long stretches in the field which in the past had been merely part of the job. John had enjoyed slipping into a new skin becoming who he needed to be to get the job done. Now the thought of shedding who he was in this moment was physically painful. Johns chest felt full of lead. He squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose.
"Well, I guess that makes us stupid together, because I'm a doctor and I missed it too." John stepped right in Sherlock's path and held a glass of scotch out to him. Sherlock huffed, his shoulders visibly relaxed, and his lips involuntarily kicked up at the corners. He took the glass and just before putting it to his lips said.
“As Sherlock would say, was obvious really. You’re dressed alike.” They were. Both in all black jeans t-shirts and leather jackets. “You can’t stop looking over at him, he hasn’t stopped looking at you, and who’s going to put up with his shit unless they fancied him?”
Sherlocks eyes sparkled with a quality that only long pent up desire can manifest. He was lovely. Eyes like jewels, curls beautifully disheveled, lips hot and pink smiled up at John.
John knew that there had been some buzz in the underworld about a contract being taken out on a diplomat fitting his description that had attended a gathering at The Royal Palace, but he wasn’t losing any sleep over it. Two of the assassins contracted for the job had already missed their mark and paid dearly for it. Most had no idea who the diplomate in question was and the ones who did wanted nothing to do with the hit.
"Hello." John's voice was soft, his demeanor relaxed and the ocean blue of his eyes was a tranquil sea. "Ready?"
The assassin literally jumped from the shadows dressed like a ninja. He was not a ninja. John had fought real ninja. This man in costume was a far cry from the real thing. The fight was quick, and completely unwinable. SAS, didn’t stand for Always prepared, but it may as well have.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade?" A tall doctor called out into the waiting room, both Sherlock and Lestrade, stood as the man came toward them. "And this must be Sherlock Holmes, the great detective." The doctor was chipper Sherlock thought as he looked on in confusion at the mans proffered hand. Obviously this was the doctor who had worked on John, and equally obvious to Sherlock was the fact that he had very little regard for his patients. Lestrade took the doctors hand before things could get awkward and asked after John.
John looked up at the beautiful blood stained boy with the bruise forming over his eye and laughed. "First do no harm. I'm a med student and I can't in good conscience leave you alone like this. And looks like you're the handes one at the moment. Which is fine by the way. Now let's get you settled yeah." John took the keys from Sherlock and continued their walk.
"This. Here like this, with you." Sherlock held his breath, eyes fixed on John's face which he loved so much, and he was surprised to see there an expression that he was wholly unfamiliar with. At first Sherlock, mistook it for anger, the heat in John's eyes was near blinding blue sparks and he could see the heavy rise and fall of Johns breath, Sherlock felt his own pulse flutter, as the word 'lust' blared loudly in his brain. Sherlock looked away. John quickly asked another question.
John removes his mouth and says the word. “Nonverbal love. Nonverbal.”  This is said as John presses Sherlock closer and firmly rubs his cock through the rich fabric of his trousers.
John reveled in the sharp bit of Sherlock’s pelvic bone grinding into his hips while he stroked Sherlock’s dick bringing him to the brink. Sherlock begs, he pleads for more for John.
John laughed and shook his head considered this for a moment. “Fine, but if you try anything, I’ll put you on your ass.”
“But their morons.” Sherlock whined into John’s neck and slid his hands into John’s front jean pockets from behind pressing himself firm against John’s back.
“Let me stop you right there. Sherlock.” John closed his eyes and took a moment before focusing on his target. “Do you know how fragile he is? Your brother. Do you know that the petulant child act is more a bid for love then it is for attention? That his harsh brilliant deductions are a shield against a world that doesn’t understand him?” John briefly rested his index finger on his lips. “More importantly do you know that if you hurt him ever again weather it be inadvertently or voluntary I will creep into your home under the cover of darkness into the warmth and security of your bedroom and I will kill you.” A small fatal smile turned up the corner of John’s mouth. “Now I know you’re thinking this would be counterproductive because Sherlock would hate me for killing his brother. And you’d be right. Probably. That’s why he’ll never know. My four horsemen and I are expertly skilled in the clandestine arts.”
“Stay calm. I got you and you’re gonna be fine. Look at me. You’re going to be ok. Keep pressure on that and I’ll be right back yeah?”
Sherlock came back and sat on the table in front of John, with the kit open on the table next to him. He pulled Johns t-shirt gently over his head and just looked at him for a moment. Head tilted to the side, eyes a bit gazed, he placed his palm flat on Johns chest and closed his eyes letting his hand travel across his warm skin. John watched Sherlock become in that moment what he was sure was going to be a very sexual creature, in the near future, but not right now. John grabbed his wrist, hard. Sherlock's eyes snapped open, his lips barely parted, his breathing just a little erratic. John felt his body's instant response. Christ Sherlock was going to be a handful.
“The girl is a succubus John!” Mercy had been emphatic, she always was on the subject of John’s future. “Don’t be jealous when I’m a super spy for MI5 and you’re stuck living in Hampstead with your fat wife and five fat babies and you’re gray and balding from stress or boredom.”
Sherlock walked up behind John and snaked his arms around John’s waist, Sherlock rested his chin on John’s shoulder and breathed in the warm sent of his neck oaky and male mixed with the cool night air.
Smiling to himself, John took a tea towel to dry his hands and flicked the kettle on. He then set out four mugs and a plate of custard creams.
Of course, Sherlock had been well aware of his feelings for John for a while, but to read that it was at least in some way reciprocated was almost enough to make Sherlock forget that he was currently in self-isolation because of a horrid virus. He smiled to himself reread all of John’s notes.
"You're going to be in so much shit when they find out it was you," John said as they paused, making sure that they weren't seen by anyone outside. Sherlock shrugged.
Having regathered himself somewhat, he pulled it out to find a text from Mrs Merriweather, which he instinctively greeted with a groan.
The shouting had ended when John had pointed out that Sherlock frequently left him in the dark during cases, brought his attention back around to locking him in a lab in Baskerville, and then reminded him that he had actually saved Sherlock’s life the previous night.
John didn’t think Sherlock would turn down the offer to go to the zoo. There were elephants there, and he knew Sherlock liked elephants.
Sherlock frowned. The only sound in the flat came from John’s relentless chomping on the prawn crackers. With London essentially on lockdown, the streets were almost deserted. Where there was usually a quiet hum of activity wafting in from Baker Street’s traffic and pedestrians, today there was silence. It was eerie.
“Yes, but what if that’s not enough?” He asked, as John’s hand dropped back down to his side. “You need 10 years of experience to be hired for anything, and all the jobs I’d possibly like to do require at least 20 years of career progression. And what if I waste my time fighting for a job that I think I’ll love but when I get there, I hate it?”
“And what?” Sherlock asked, walking around his room and picking up bits and pieces that he’d abandoned throughout the week. “There was no big romantic gesture, Mrs Hudson. I made a comment about marriage…”
Whether he chose to admit it or not, Sherlock had always been somewhat defensive about the globe. It wasn't his globe, and therefore knew he shouldn’t be so protective over it. Yet, if he ever spotted a person pressing their dirty fingers to it, he would always feel his blood boil. This person, it seemed, was showing a particular interest in Australia.
The fight clubs he attended were ideal for him  however, because they meant that he didn't have to use his Ability, which was possibly the only rule going.
John watched him with concern, his hands stuffed in his pockets, shielding them from the cold January air.
John needed the background noise in the mundane situations to keep his brain from going to places that he feared. What those places were Sherlock hadn’t quite managed to assemble into a coherent fact yet – it wasn’t the war, per say, but throughout the years of their friendship John had started to develop more and more seemingly insignificant coping mechanisms.
Throughout the years, Sherlock had created an image of himself and projected it onto those around him. He was pleased when people considered him to be cold and calculating, and loved it even more when he irritated people through his arrogance. Sometimes he couldn’t help it, and sometimes he would rather not piss a person off, but most of the time the benefits far outweighed the consequences.
Silence hung in the air like smoke from a cigarette. Sherlock could almost see it. Hovering there, mocking him, making him cough. John had gone back to staring. The notebook was definitely still on the bed.
"What did Merriweather want?" Sherlock immediately quizzed, John stared at him, to which Sherlock responded with a raised eyebrow prompting him to talk. John sighed.
And then John had appeared and John… John had tricked him. From day one, John had totally and utterly pulled the wool over his eyes.
“Something like that,” Sherlock replied, hurrying into the room and kicking some loose belongings under the bed. “First aid kit is in the kitchen. I’ll be back in a moment.”
"I didn't!" Sherlock implored, growing frantic. Next to him, a potted plant where the children often used to bury their cars exploded into an angry fireball of flames, causing Sherlock to jump. He made a mad dash towards his parents, and this time Merriweather let him go.
“You’re unhappy with me because I’m an unfeeling machine and therefore couldn’t possibly understand that, sometimes, people get sad or they’re happy or they’re horny or they just need a hug,” Sherlock said. “I understand emotions, I have emotions. I would be a pretty awful detective if I couldn’t understand other people’s emotions; emotions are often the driving motive in crime.”
"Sorry," he managed, surprised at how strong his voice was. There was no trace of any misery behind his utterance, but he was glad for it. Being confident had always been his biggest lie; his most perfectly executed defensive mechanism that always sprung to life the moment he felt challenged. As it turned out, admitting defeat with John was another excuse for his over-exaggerated and completely false self-confidence to shine.
"Sherlock," she said, crouching down so that she was level with him. He couldn't pretend to like her. They hated one another. But coupled with the scare of the fire still burning away merrily in front of him, he was more or less forced to listen to her. "How did the fire start?"
From behind the shelf, Sherlock peered around the corner again. Both Jim and John had separated now, with John rubbing his face with his hand, smudging it a rich pink.
However, John didn’t follow him. He made no move to stop him, either. He hung his head, and as Sherlock halted, the stones beneath his feet grinding against one another as sandhoppers darted about around his feet, John began laughing.
Sherlock stood on the outskirts of the conversation, a deep frown sinking into his face. He looked between John and Mike, eyes narrowed, surveying them both closely.
White horses crashed over the pebbles and ran towards John’s bare toes. They halted, then retreated back into the murky depths from which they’d arisen. The wind picked up and with it more waves charged at the shoreline. Above them, thunder rolled across the dark sky, the cheering spectator of battle.
Mrs Hudson turned around and found, to her surprise, Sherlock standing in the doorway of the lounge, with Rosie fast asleep in his arms.
“You didn’t need to get her anything,” John had told him over the phone shortly after the parcels had arrived.
"Bring him in." She ordered, turning around to face Sherlock with her eyes sparkling. "What's his name? John Watson? And he's known for how long? How long? Dear me. Even though it's illegal? Teenagers, eh? Alright, yes. As quickly as you can." She winked at Sherlock, who shot back a scowl.
“It means that I’m the back-up,” Sherlock countered, following John up the stairs. “Granted it means that there isn’t much expectation of what I can achieve. Mycroft is supposed to be the great one, while I’m supposed to be happy. That’s the younger sibling’s job. That’s why you’re putting yourself through medical school while Harry’s gallivanting off to Ibiza with her latest girlfriend, being happy.”
Mrs Hudson could sympathise with the mourning of his dead wife, but there was absolutely no need for him to be that cruel to Sherlock.
“Just hear me out. I got another job, and by another job I mean I've been helping out Mycroft. This is on top of working at the surgery and working as your blogger - which I know for a fact you secretly like,” he added with a grin, and Sherlock was forced to chew back a guilty smile. “It's just a few evenings a week. Mainly it's sitting in bars and watching people, then reporting back to him.”

The crowds parted as several burly security guards marched through, two of them dragging a seemingly very rebellious teenager behind them.
Technically, Sherlock knew he should be weary of John. He knew almost nothing about the guy, after all, yet he seemed to know an awful lot about him.
Those were the good days. The good conversations. The days where they almost reached a version of normality with which Sherlock could live without complaint.
John hadn’t meant to lose his temper, but as his speech grew and as the storm clouds darkened and lightning and thunder moved closer to the shoreline something within John snapped. Maybe it was the alcohol, his cheek rosy from the whisky he’d been sipping by the fire. And Sherlock, sandwiched between John and the sea, was helpless in the tirade.
It was thick fur, almost like that of a wolf, and Sherlock frowned as he curled his fingers around a great clump of it.
John nodded. “Right,” he said, looking down. Then realisation dawned on him as he looked up. “You weren’t talking about me and Mary,” he said, and Sherlock’s eyes widened, horrified.
Running his hand over the antenna, Sherlock pressed down on the PTT button which sat on the the side of the device. He couldn't help but as he brought the device closer to his mouth.
“How can he say that?” He asked. “He hasn’t seen you since you were students. You could be a serial killer for all he’s aware. You’ve descended through friend, to acquaintance, and your relationship is now bordering on total strangers. He knows nothing about you anymore.”
The shower turned off downstairs and John sighed quietly. Sherlock had attempted to remake his bed, but pillows were in the wrong place and he hadn’t tucked the duvet in properly.
Everyone had protested at Sherlock having painkillers. Whether it was all for a case or not, he had consumed a fair amount of unsavoury substances recently and no one wanted to risk him falling any further down that rabbit hole again. Neither John nor Mycroft had forgotten that Sherlock had nearly overdosed on the other plane over a year prior to Culverton Smith surfacing at all, and neither had they forgotten accidentally stumbling across him in a drug den. Case or not, Culverton Smith or Augustus Magnussen, both John and Mycroft had recognised that tricky cases hadn’t been the only factor in Sherlock’s relapse.
Mrs Hudson sighed with all the contention of a woman who was simply bored with an argument, rather than a woman who had simply lost an argument.
John wouldn’t go on any cases with him for a while. John wouldn’t let Sherlock go on any cases for a while. They both pretended it was Mycroft stopping them from rushing off whenever Lestrade summoned them. Mycroft as Sherlock’s brother, and John as Sherlock’s disapproving doctor, had unanimously decided that Sherlock needed to rest. After all, he had: “quite literally been to hell and back and you haven’t really looked after yourself in that time. Don’t give me that look, Sherlock. You weren’t pretended to be off your tits, were you? You were also beaten up pretty badly - how’re John’s knuckles, by the way? I hope John’s apologised to you. And you were nearly the victim of serial killer. Again.” Was Lestrade’s verbal reasoning when Sherlock had informed him of the decisions that had been made for him.
“Everyone always talks about how perfect meeting their soulmate is and how clear the world becomes. Very few will admit the pounding headache as new chemicals flood the brain. They seek to  romanticise an event which is simply a universal, scientific truth. People have been known to faint, and of course there’s the odd seizure but I don’t think you’re at risk of that. What’s your name?” The man asked.
John felt that all in all, he had definitely encountered more than his fair share of bad days. He’d had some good days, too, though. Brilliant days, even. But it was when bad days flowed into the night, like a dim moon on a clear day that simply refused creep below the horizon where it belonged, that John really felt the effects of them.
Then, he had received a request for help from a kind British lady living in Florida. Sherlock had flown over and spent a few months unpicking her case. That lady then became his and John’s landlady, but before that Sherlock developed a friends-with-benefits type situation with a used car salesman, who he’d bought a car off when he realised he would probably be in Florida for a while.
At some point, Sherlock had fallen asleep. He didn’t remember drifting off, nor did he realise he’d been sleeping. He grunted at John in response, his face hidden by the duvet.
“I know,” he clarified, watching John intently. “I know because of the packet of ginger nuts in your pocket and the packet of cigarettes in the other. I know because you didn’t leave your suburban terrace with the intention of going to the zoo, having left Rosie’s trusty bag probably at the bottom of your stairs where you usually keep it.”
“John didn’t think I would be into that sort of thing. So, I told him what I wanted out of a relationship and he told me what he wanted, and we discovered that what we wanted was largely the same thing.”
“Is that why you’re moving out, then?” He asked. “Have your flatmates all had enough of you stealing their things?”
Sherlock felt distinctly ruffled. The man had left, but his actions and voice still remained hanging over Sherlock like an eerie phantom. What on Earth had just happened? He sandwiched his thumb in between the two halves of the book, standing up and gripping it with the rest of his fingers so as not to lose his page or drop it. The library was just as silent as it had been before, yet an underlying crackle of static electricity made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end; his spine rigid as though someone had stuck a wrought iron beam along the length of it. It was as though the rampant silent beast was afraid, and Sherlock had caught onto the fearfulness.
Harry leapt back over the brook and took John’s hand. John screamed at her, but in one swift motion Harry had scooped him up and was hugging him tightly, holding him close.
A home was supposed to be a place of relaxation; a home was supposed to be a place where a person was able to be their complete self with no hindrance.
"Mr and Mrs Holmes," she began, watching the family as they took Sherlock into their arms. "I have a proposition to make."

The day his wife died was a very strong contender, and he reasoned that he probably ought to name that day as the worst should anyone ask. It would be indecent to suggest that the day he had become a widow hadn’t been the worst day of his life. That’s just what people expected.
“But you’re a man of action, John. You’re a man who’s looked death in the eye numerous times and you’re a man who’s experienced more than your fair share of heartbreak. Having said that,” Sherlock looked up at the ceiling, considering his thoughts aloud. “Your life really is all the evidence I need that love is dangerous. I should have been recording all the evidence from day one, it would have made a wonderful experiment and subsequent blogpost. I dare say it would have been even more popular than one of yours…”
“Our text messages are inconsequential,” he countered. “Not everything is about sex, you know. She has a new girlfriend – and Irene wanted to introduce me to her girlfriend’s brother.”
He continued walking. Taking wide but slow steps as he went, aimlessly searching around for something to do. It didn't take long for his translated wishes to come true however, as  reached the reception which was teeming with people, when a shout erupted into the air.
“If you’re not a threat,” Sherlock called, “get off the bed and lie down by the wardrobe, facing away from me.”
The cottage was large, but not overbearingly so. Situated in a natural dip in the fields and close to a forest, they’d snapped it up immediately as the perfect place to retire.
“And I told you a threat only made you appear more guilty. The police have your name and your address. They’ll find you. They’re not completely stupid, though they do appear it most of the time.”
Sherlock had woken up one day in a cold sweat and heart palpitations. Mrs Hudson had phoned John to tell him that Sherlock was having a suspected heart attack, and that he should meet them at the hospital as soon as possible because Sherlock was weakly vomiting and the paramedics were on their way and it was the furthest John had ever felt from his practice because how could Sherlock be having a heart attack? How could he have not seen that Sherlock was at risk of one?
But it felt right. It was definitely right. This conversation was long overdue, and although Sherlock knew that there would be no turning back, he also knew that this was it. This was the big one. Really, John had always been his, just as he had always been John’s. They’d just never addressed it before. The admission of that truth and the verbal statement of wanting more was the beginning of a wonderful new game.

Sherlock chuckled at the last one. He closed the notebook and put it back on the bedside table. Through the closed door, he could just make out the murmurings of John as he talked to his patients. That warm, grumpy, impossibly helpful but also impossibly done voice.
John wasn’t sure whether he’d simply fallen over, or whether he’d been mugged. He’d found the man sat on a park bench in Russell Square.
John nodded. “Yes, I know,” he said, still frowning. Sherlock wondered how often he actually smiled. “It was in all the papers. They interviewed people in my regiment. I was interviewed myself. None of us knew her, but we all followed the case. Every time a head was found it was all anyone would talk about at base, but I don’t remember hearing your name mentioned at all. Dreadful business though, wasn’t it?”
“The surgery is a mess,” John said, practically yelling over Sherlock’s hacking cough. “I had Margaret on the phone this morning. They’re down to their last box of face masks and a coughing mother threatened to riot when she was stopped from going in. Will you be okay if I set up in the kitchen?”
“I didn’t realise how ghastly that wallpaper is,” he said, running his hand along it. “I suppose my landlord hadn’t met his soulmate when he decorated.”
Stationed in the middle of the army of shelving stood a large sphere. Blotched and mottled brown owing to the varnish; it lay entrapped in a brass ring that kept people away. It was the centre piece of the magnificent library. A large sphere that couldn’t be touched. It was essentially a mindless, strangely nostalgic object that Sherlock desperately wanted to run his hands over. Because he couldn’t touch it, it made him want to even more.
I hope that was okay! I wanted to rewrite their first meeting, but around the same time it should’ve happened anyway. If that makes any sense at all.
Nobody bothered him when he was with a book, and even when he was prowling the shelves in search of a new read no one gave him a second glance. Nobody spoke to him, either. It was as though he was invisible. He was never knocked; never chastised; never forced into doing the things that he didn't want to do. Mycroft didn't disturb him. He hadn't seen him since he'd first walked through the great wooden doors, in fact. Something that Sherlock was most definitely not complaining about.
“What are you?” He whispered. He brought his hand up, still following the fur, until it gave way to shorter, coarser hair.
“No, I mean, well, there’re two rooms with beds in. So you can have your own bed, and I can have my own bed, if you, if you want,” John was blushing, and Sherlock was grinning.
He looked up at the darkening sky, squinting at a gull as it flew overhead. He sighed quietly, mustering any small amount of strength he had to greet John’s argument and compose his own without accidentally offending John more than he already had done that day. Sherlock turned to look back at John, then launched into his proposed execution of the brewing debate.
Mycroft had gone in to tell Sherlock to get out. He recalled to John seeing Sherlock’s long, matted, curly hair. Remembered Sherlock chained to the wall, bent over uncomfortably with weak knees and blood struggling to dry in the dampness of the room. The guards wore fur. Sherlock only wore trousers. John had seen the pictures. The medical practitioner in him yearned to help, but he was forced to remind himself that Sherlock was no longer in that state. He was being force-fed cakes by Mrs Hudson, the adoptive maternal figure playing nurse to her distressed, and now very grumpy and embarrassed, son.
Despite the cold January air, Green Park was enjoying a day of idle walkers and cyclists, carrying them between Buckingham Palace and the Underground Station.
"Kid, get out of here!" One of them yelled, brandishing his arm for Sherlock to follow. "There's a fire!"
“Mph,” Mrs Safely had sighed absently as Sherlock stood on his tiptoes, clenching onto the front of the desk so as not to fall over. Even with being heightened by balancing precariously on his toes, it was still very difficult for him to see over and look at what the woman was doing. He was a very short child, and always had something to say about it when he acted as ‘piggy’ whilst playing Piggy in the Middle with his father and Mycroft. How was it fair that the smallest person was the one who bullied for their height? Tall people may have a few jokes thrown in their direction, but heaven forbid anyone be short. His growth spurt had occurred when he was fifteen. Now, he wouldn’t think twice before simply jumping over the reception and rifling through Mrs Safely’s files, but that was the present. The past was a different story entirely.
“No you don’t,” Sherlock puffed out a short laugh, stunning even himself. He hadn’t meant to say that. Definitely thought it, but most desperately didn’t want to say it. John leaned back slightly, eyebrows knitting together and jaw clenching. Sherlock decided to take it.
Today however, fate was on his side as her telephone began ringing shrilly in her pocket. Holding a single finger up to Sherlock, she rummaged around in her pocket before answering it.
Had Sherlock known John would walk by? Had Sherlock known about John at all? Was it fate, or was there something more sinister at play?
Soon enough, John Watson lay sprawled across the bed, butt-naked and snoring loudly. Underneath him lay a thick blanket of fur.
The notebook certainly wasn’t way he’d have chosen for Sherlock to find out, but he also had no idea of how he’d have told Sherlock anyway. If it weren’t for the government-ordered self-isolation he knew that Sherlock would have already fled, and even then he knew that the only reason Sherlock was actually paying attention to the new rules was he was scared of Mrs Hudson’s mighty wrath.
This man, with the bookshelves rigid as he walked alongside them was no Cheshire Cat: He was the bloody Red Queen.
Almost as soon as the topic had been brought up, Sherlock began feeling around in his pocket for the silver name badge that always caused him so much aggravation from Mrs Merriweather. Opposite him, John smiled wryly, pushing himself away from the wall and nursing his stomach. Maybe Sherlock had punched him a bit too hard after all.
“Are there others?” He asked. “Other creatures – I mean, people? If werewolves are real then surely there must be other people who aren’t werewolves but are something else.”
Branches cracked and snapped above them as the wind tore through the trees. John gripped Harry’s hand, eyes focused resolutely on the ground as he splashed through streams in his little yellow wellington boots. It was dark. Very dark. Their only source of light came from the torch Harry held. She pointed it at the ground, helping John navigate the uneven forest floor. Grey clouds had rolled across the sky and blocked the moonlight long ago. John’s legs were beginning to ache.
John started laughing again as they stepped out of the alleyway and John’s halls came into sight. A concrete cube, it reminiscent of the brutalist architecture J.G. Ballard wrote about. Small, square, tired-looking windows peered out across the campus from where they were set back in the pebbledash block. Regimented in their separation, they signified an equality with which John couldn’t quite connect. The rooms inside were all the same, all equally cramped and unhomely, designed in bulk to make life easy for the builders and the accommodation team.
“Sherlock, you were in pain,” John half-yelled. Sherlock didn’t flinch. “You were hurting. I didn’t ask how you were, I never once asked. I still haven’t asked. I presumed you were gallivanting off without me and I didn’t think for one second that you would be…”
“Look,” John began. “I'm not a rich man. Never have been, probably never will be. The money I get from the doctor’s is alright, but the debts mostly outweigh them. You listed all of the things you do for me. If it wasn't for you I’d probably been sitting in a council house somewhere, doing God knows what. All I know is that I’d be the most miserable bastard going.”
Sherlock screamed and gripped his Dad's coat as a pot of pencils exploded next to them; his Dad starting talking to him, trying to calm him down as he wriggled around in his grasp. Although his words went ignored, the fact that Sherlock could hear something other than the crackle and roar of flames was a comfort.
"At the end of the corridor there's a caretakers closet. I want you to lock yourselves inside it. Over."
There was still so much to say. There was still so much to discuss. But actions spoke louder than words.
“... What if I don’t want my own bed?” He tried, but immediately regretted it. This was exactly the kind of thing he did to make himself sound like a twit. No wonder John had gotten angry with him. “That was probably the wrong thing to say. Sorry. I shouldn’t have-”
The Thames churned beneath the cracking and crumbling Hammersmith Bridge, which disgruntled morning commuters marched across in drones towards the nearby Underground station, annoyed that they were forced to work in the time between Christmas and New Year’s.
Where had John gone? Was he okay? With a jolt Sherlock remembered being crushed, the distant shouts of “It bit him!” And “Run for at lads!” But in his confused state Sherlock struggled to put two and two together.
It was a small, squashed room. The bookshelf was empty, as was the wardrobe of which the doors were wide open. John shifted some boxes away from the bed so that there would be enough room for Sherlock to sit and for John to attend the wounds, then began exploring.
Sherlock scrunched his face up and rubbed eyes. “But, you weren’t bitten and you just became a werewolf?” He asked, and John laughed.
There was indeed a wolf lying on the floor next to his wardrobe. A great, massive, beautiful wolf. One of its ears was down, but the other remained up, listening to Sherlock. A thick and fluffy tail swished back and forth on the floor, and Sherlock stared at it in utter bewilderment.
Something slammed down next to Sherlock’s face and Sherlock opened his eyes. He stared in bewilderment at a large paw.
Not wanting to see the result of his clumsiness, Sherlock hesitantly glanced towards them, worry etched into his face.
Suit clad politicians stood stock still, clutching onto their cardboard coffee cups and forgetting about their own mundane business as they watched the resulting raucous started by the loud teenager. Sherlock (for his part) blinked, and despite the obvious appearance he needed to make; ducked behind one of the large pillars which ultimately blocked him from everyone's view, but more importantly from the growing angrier boy still shouting his name as he was hauled by.
His eye was still red, still sore, but seemed far better than it had done the previous day. The bags under his eyes had begun to relent, too, and John noted that Sherlock seemed to have had a proper shower and shave since the previous day. He smelt better. Was that aftershave he could smell?
The book landing in Sherlock's lap caused him to start suddenly. He was about to fire off a canon of profanities as he gripped onto the arm of the chair, glaring at the twat of a man before him - until he paused: Where were his manners?
The wolf crossed to the wardrobe and pawed at it until it opened. He then stuck his whole face in the wardrobe and began rummaging around.
The days his mother and father died were two very strong contenders. His father had suffered a heart attack while on holiday in Barmouth, and his mother had died in a car crash a few years later. The day he had been shot hadn’t been particularly fantastic, and the day Sherlock had thrown himself off the top of St Bart’s was most certainly a day John didn’t ever want to remember.
Keeping one thumb wedged securely on the page of his own book so as to not lose his place, he carefully picked up the stranger’s book and handed it to him.
John grabbed the notebook and scrunched it in his fist, the cover crumpling in his hand. He ripped it off, which loosened and bent the staples which bound the paper.
“We’re getting off topic” Sherlock said, his glare settling in again. “What happened? What is the normal way?”
“But we’ve decided to make one of our rules of our clear communication. If one of us is unhappy with something, we have to make it known and not bottle it up.”
The clouds began parting, allowing for specks of light blue to be seen in between the branches of the bare trees. A few metres away, the squirrel poked its head out of the hollow it had been hiding in. Claws clung onto the greying bark as it leaned forward, surveying the scene taking place below.
Sherlock settled back down, and for some reason he wasn’t at all surprised when the wolf curled up next to him. Sherlock shuffled a bit and rested his head on the wolf’s thick pelt.
Sherlock watched as the two men responded to the crackle of Bear 1's walkie-talkie, desperately trying to hold in a laugh. It wasn't often that he got to do stuff like that, and he loved it whenever he did.
Realising what John had said, Sherlock blinked, stepping away from him and lowering his hand completely. Honestly, he really had to work on how much one topic could throw him off.
'School Boy Sets School Alight' began to emerge, and his mum and dad had to assure him constantly that it wasn't his fault. The police weren't taking it like that, at any rate.
By far the most ludicrous of ideas was that John was the wolf, but that was completely absurd. Werewolves weren’t real, and if John was one Sherlock would definitely know about it.
“Using my surname to deflect from the fact that we’re soulmates and to listen to you in a more formal capacity? Smart. I live on this street, just beside the British Museum. I have a first aid kit there.”
“I imagine your flat is covered in paint, now,” he said, folding the paper and pocketing it. “You’ve changed your shirt three times today.”
“The same hotel room?” He scrunched his nose up, but before he had time to say anything else on the subject John was hurriedly covering his tracks.
Sherlock tried to lift himself out of bed but realised his mistake with a horrid jolt when he moved his leg. As yelled out in pain, John jerked awake.
They stood a few feet apart from one another, now, but it felt like the world was between them. John felt that he could almost see the curvature of the Earth for how distant Sherlock appeared and how remote they both were. It was as though suddenly all of London and the UK had vanished. There were no cars, no discernible noise which could bring John out of that moment.
“But, there are a few obstacles to overcome first. I’ve told John that we can’t do anything concrete until those obstacles present themselves.”
She had seen it in the faces of the protesters in the marches she had attended in her youth – that powerful desperation for change that came with the passion of the protest.
Beneath the ground floor however, it was a much different story. Long rooms stretched for miles, and Mycroft had once told Sherlock that right at the very bottom were dungeons where they kept troublesome children who wouldn't go to their meetings. Although now he though about it, that was probably a lie. But the building did stretch for miles under ground, and that was the only remnants of the old building.
“Mycroft's…” John faltered as Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Helping me?” He finished, shrugging his explanation. Sherlock shook his head.
They walked back to Baker Street from the zoo. The rain faded away and by the time they returned to Baker Street the clouds had parted and the sun was shining through.
He already felt as though he’d been shot in the chest though, so he supposed: ‘What harm would an imagined wound do?’
“Sir?” The man chuckled. “I’m much younger than you. And sir is so old-fashioned.” He turned his attention away from his graze and looked up at the man who was so desperately trying to help him. “Are you trying to get used to not being in… oh.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock said, taking the card off him and peeling the sticker off. He handed the card back to John. “Of course it’s our anniversary. 29th of January. It’s the day we met.”
Large blue eyes stared back at Sherlock, wider than was perhaps normal for them and shocked confusing rippling from his whole being. Dirty blonde hair swept across his head, untidily poking in different directions. Mrs Merriweather had completely missed John's disappearance.
"Something like that," John agreed, stretching his newly freed shoulder in small rotations. "We need to leave. They'll notice that we're not out the building and come looking for us, and then they'll realise that there isn't a fire..." John paused, glancing towards Sherlock momentarily, and Sherlock could have sworn he saw something along the lines of awe flash across John's face, even if it was for a fleeting moment. But it was gone as soon as it has come, and Sherlock found himself listening to John's finishing question of: "... And who will they blame that on?"
“And what?” John’s conversation (confrontation?) with the elder Holmes had left him more certain then ever that he was going to peruse things with Sherlock. And if the British Government couldn’t deter him then Mercy sure as hell wasn’t going to either.
Jim laughed at Sherlock’s cool demeanor but the sound was less like laughter and more like nails on a chalkboard. “I have a colleague who whole heartedly believes that brainy is the new sexy. From where I’m standing sexy, is the new sexy. Or is it the old sexy?” Jim seemed to direct the last part of the question more to himself then everyone else. “We should all sit, don’t you think?” Jim, started off towards a table by the window. Once they were all seated he continued to address his questions to Sherlock.
"John?" His voice sounded strange to him, far off and stricken. No answer. Deep shaken breath. "John please."
Sherlock hated himself for what he was about to do. But do it he must. He dressed swift and silent, picked up his shoes and paused. John. He lay on his back, his right arm above his head, his left out straight on Sherlock’s pillow, his chest was bare with the covers coming to rest at his waist. Sherlock burnt the sight into his mind and created a space dedicated to all things John. Walking out was so much harder then it had been to let John leave. Walking out felt like betrayal. Sherlock reasoned that’s because it was. John had been more then clear about his feelings and the fact that he was in no way interested in ending their relationship. But Sherlock simply could not believe that John would be able to love him once he took a good long reasonable  look at all that Sherlock had cost him. And so he took one last look. He slipped his passport into his inside breast pocket and left.
"There indeed." John raised his glass and offered to refill Sherlock's. He tilted his head in thanks and accepted.
“Look at the way he touches him Tiger. Such reverence. It’s like worship.” Jim said the words with a hot hatred that Sebastian found incredibly arousing. “We’re here because that’s ours. No one else should have that.”
(The City of Love) John corrected him no less perfect with a smile and a kiss to the back of the hand he’d been holding.
"Not my area. But why? Why is this part of me, this part of my life so important to you? Why do you care?"
“Well that’s just it then isn’t it John. I’m not playing.” Sherlock sipped his drink, and gave John a look.
“Sherlock please do try to be a little less dramatic. I’m not trying to kill anyone. I’m not responsible for the opts he’s assign and half the time SAS work is so clandestine that no one even gives them orders. They are on their own. But he will die Sherlock it’s only a matter of time. Men like Dr. Watson, are not retired. He’ll go the way all men do. And when he dose, you’ll be broken.”
“You. Clearly I’m not the one that misunderstood. I never once said that I was done with you. I said I was done with back alleys. I thought the warehouse was an apology for our last text conversation.”
“Apparently he is. Sherlock’s blocked somehow. I don’t understand it either. But I did receive a message for you when I attempted the trace.”
In John's line of work there was a general air of distrust, everyone you came in contact with was either a spy, an assassin, or a highly trained operative from one covert organization or another, so for Sherlock to be taken down by someone as workaday as Victor Trevor was both insulting and near impossible. Sherlock wouldn't have fallen for anything that Trevor was able to come up with on his own. Therefore Trevor had help. John was going to find out exactly who put him up to this and why, and heaven help them all when he did.
"What the hell?!" Said John and Lestrade in unison as they both walked quickly to Sherlock, John being the fist to reach him. Glancing over his shoulder not sure if he should go after the woman or not.
“If you didn’t fancy him brother,” Mercy kept talking over John’s bullshit denial. “You would agree.”
"Please...what?...Please...get the milk?" Johns voice was hushed and barely audible, but to Sherlock's ears it was a chorus of angels, he almost laughed with joy.
"Oh I don't know. Maybe...Buckingham palace. Never too late to pop in on the Queen, have a nice cuppa." Her tone was causal but she felt anything but. Thomas was a vile man. Outwardly he was lovely. Tall but not imposing, olive green eyes with flecks of gold and sandy blond hair. Just lovely. And vile. Like a brightly colored snake. The thought made Irene chuckle out loud.
This chapter is dedicated to Snowrabbit, who was looking for a little more John/Sherlock interaction. Now I’m not sure if this is what you had in mind...but this was already in the works when you asked. I hope it fills a need. A thousand times thank you for your request.
"Spot on. In fairness I have to tell you, we're not dealing with uranium. The facility is indeed a lab, but not a nuclear one, a chemical one. There are four scientists total Sherlock among them, their making...Sarin."
"Don't do that. It's not your fault that the coroners report was incomplete. You couldn't have spotted that. You knew the man was lying, it just took a moment to put the pieces together." John set about pouring two rock glasses of rich amber liquor.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. Just a little note here. A Maxim9 is a 9mm handgun with a built in suppressor. Not creating total silence, but close. Just one of John’s many toys.
Both men turned sharply toward the thick baritone and John had to wonder if Elliot where similarly effected by the dulcet tones as he was.
Sherlock always loved returning home, returning to London. Nothing made his heart jump the way London did. Well nothing that is except John. Anomalous John. Exactly what Sherlock hadn't known he'd been looking for. The thought made him smile, London made him smile, 221B Baker Street which the taxi had just pulled up in front of made him smile.
"A boy named Albus something, a first year. But there was no malice in it. He was laughing almost immediately after. The girl who slapped him was topless."
John gave a curt nod, pivoted on his heels and walked out. He made it about halfway down the narrow poorly lit black hall and just stopped, his own harsh words from months back echoing in his ears, and he laughed. No. Just no. He would not get the fuck out. Not now and not ever again. This had gone on long enough, and if one of them didn't let go of their stubborn fuckin pride, they would never find their way back to each other. Because they where both headed headlong for the grave.
The next three days were a hell scape of nightmares, vomiting and seizures. Sherlock's body was ravaged by fever and chills. Then came the incoherent sobbing and violent outbursts. John did his level best to stay out of the other doctors way, but didn't hesitate to pull rank if he didn't agree with the treatment. He stayed by Sherlock's bedside only leaving to shower once. By day four Sherlock was finally coherent and by his account ready to track down any and everyone who had a hand in this.
"I missed your cock inside me John." Sherlock dragged the words along John's neck. "Do you like it when I take all of you inside me John? Cum for me John. Cum inside me John pleeaassee!"  The last of Sherlock's breath a whisper hiss in John's ear all as he road John to his own breath taking climax.
“Not that easy.” Moran’s voice was choked and betrayed his pain. “Just a little rattled.” The grenade ripped the night air with lethal blinding force.
Helloo (peeking around the corner afraid you may throw something at my head) The Cold East Wind here. Remember me? I have a little something for you if your interested. Before we go back to kicking ass and extracting names, we drop in on our boys where we left them, at The Waldorf Astoria in Berlin.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. I know, it’s been far too long. I’ve recently started a new job, and I’m desperately trying to balance work, and the love of our boys. I believe I’ve found a rhythm now that should work. Fingers crossed.
So here we are. Nearing the end? From here...we’ll have to see. Beware, implied attempted rape, homophobic language and mild violence. Please forgive me for not doing a better job at trigger warnings. Promise to do better going forward.
Here was his genius with the most open and genuine, expression, playing across the plans of his face and yet he still tried to hold on to the last shred of arrogance. John couldn't help but smile. He had always wondered quietly in the back of his mind, in his most private times, what this defining moment would be like. Soft, was the word that came to mind. So that's how John approached it.
"This." John motioned around them indicating the warehouse. "You're not made for this. You’re made for plush sheets and moonlight and slow. God! So fuckin slow. Not...this. I just...can’t. Not with you.”
”I wasn't sure you'd come. I hoped.” Sherlock's voice low, tired and still raspy from trauma but so very sincere.
“Holy hell.” John rained fervent kisses over Sherlock’s mouth, chin and throat they nuzzled and bumped lips and noses in an effort to share each other from breath to heart beat. Sherlock pressed his cheek to John’s in what was almost a kiss coupled with the sounds of heavy breath and low moans.
"So, here we are." John turned from the storm outside the window and made an attempt to defuse the less than favorable situation they found themselves in. He knew that a frustrated caged Sherlock was not the man he wanted to be trapped with for the next however many days this storm had planned.
“No hold up at all. Methos, Silas, this is Sherlock Holmes.” John gave a slight bow between the two parties. “Now can we please get the fuck out of here?”
John had worked frantically to save his friends life as his own blood  blurred his vision from a gash in his head and stitched up a femoral artery on his knees in the dirt.
"Not my area. But why? Why is this part of me, this part of my life so important to you? Why do you care?"
“John.” Sherlock had misses saying John’s name out loud. “John, I need to get to this...ugh...the...I’m sorry, the truth or dare. Can we discuss this later?” Sherlock tried to hold up the flyer for emphasis.
“Really?” John arched an eyebrow with a crooked smile. “Hold that thought Kitten yeah?” John pulled out his Maxim9 and ducked around the corner knife still in hand. Sherlock hung back and listen to the sounds of the nearby fighting. John came back moments later with fresh blood spray across his face, knife covered in blood in one hand gun smoking in the other. “You were saying?”
“I’m hungry.” Sherlock let the thought register in the back of his mind, he couldn’t recall the last time he’d eaten let alone the last time he’d felt actual hunger and it made him laugh, which was a bad idea on several levels. First, it was excruciating, second it drew the attention of the men in the room, and if there were ever a group of men who’s attention Sherlock didn’t want it was these.
"I feel as though I have sufficiently told you all my secrets."  The deep thunder of Sherlock's voice made into smooth molten honey. John smiled wickedly without opening his eyes.
John gives him all he ask for and fucked into him header. Heart pounding Sherlock worked his hips in grinding downward circles driving John’s cock deeper for the love of God deeper! John pushed pushed pushed Sherlock’s hips back in sharp jerks and he met him thrusting up up up heels digging into stone knees bent.
Four days passed. His asset slept, ate and healed.  By day four Sherlock was himself again, a man that John had never really seen. John went to Sherlock's room to tell him he was wanted in a meeting so they could formulate a strategy.  The safe house was actually a hotel, so when John entered Sherlock's rooms and didn't find him in the main room, he moved about until he heard the sound of the shower. The door to the loo was wide open and perfectly aligned with the shower itself. The shower door was made of distorted glass but only managed to come up midway to the occupant's shoulders. John stood a little ways back from the door unable to look away. Sherlock turned in the steaming hot water and met johns gaze. His unruly curls were slick off his face, lashes wet, and skin pink from the heat. At the site of John standing there watching him Sherlock’s mind raced with possibilities. The one he settled on made him smile a wicked crooked little smile. John heard the hiss of breath sucked through Sherlock’s teeth as he touch himself, John could see the motion of Sherlock’s right hand through the blurred glass sliding down his lean angular body that John had become very familiar with and that hand begin to move. Sherlock bit his lower lip, and looked down his wet body, his left hand gripped the shower door, he looked back up at John, his breath was sharp, he closed his eyes and arched his back, his right hand moved faster, he looked back at John through half lowered wet lashes mouth open panting, huffing, his hand gripped the glass tighter, he sucked in one ragged breath after another, after another his head rolled back, his body jerked, his eyes fluttered and came back to rest on John who stood stone still. Watching. His breath was jerky, peppered with low moans, half cut off, Sherlock licked his lips, and tilted his head back whining soft low over and over one word. John. So sweet on wet lips. His grip on the glass door was the only thing that kept him from falling as his release claimed his whole body. Sherlock bit down on his lip red and swollen and nearly double over in jerky convulsions. He hung his head mouth open perfectly spent and looked up at John through his lashes with sparkling devilish eyes trying to regain his breath. John broke the silence.
"You’re taking the piss right? You're trying to keep me from something I want very badly. You had to know I would come." John seemed truly confused by the question. Both men remained posed to strike. This was never going to be a pleasant conversation.
They washed each other with dream like slowness. Neither in a rush to finish what their bodies had started, yet unable to stop the inevitable brushing against each in hot soapy rapture tethering on the edge. John enjoyed the progressive tightening of Sherlock’s every muscle the slight tremble of his thighs and his gasping breaths when John would slid there cocks across one another. He was beautiful. And John couldn’t keep his mouth off him a second longer. John slipped his hands down Sherlock’s thighs around to cup his bottom and then he went to his knees. Sherlock tried to pull away wanting to prolong this as long as he could. But John would not be denied his prize and took Sherlock into his mouth and held him there stroking his own cock unable to hold back the jerky tidal wave of his release as he sucked Sherlock down. John stood back up smiling at Sherlock’s spent beauty.  Sherlock kissed him. He licked John’s lips and searched John’s mouth for every drop of himself left there. They stayed that way, kissing lazily under the water locked together.
"Sherlock."  John was dizzy and vaguely confused. But one thing was crystal clear. This man was a force of nature. John was sure he'd never been this lost to another human being. So totally consumed. "Sherlock. I love you." So totally lost.
John gestures for Sherlock to move closer as he bent his knees and moved forward, Sherlock mirrored John's movements so that they were side by side Johns left knee pressed against Sherlock's right. They sat there for how long John was not sure. Silent. Foreheads resting together, Sherlock's tears soft and steady, his eyes down cast. His mind swirling with new information repeating over and over, not ready, not ready. Sherlock's breathing had become a little shallow and his pulse thudded wildly. But John was patient as the grave. He waited, and Sherlock eventually relaxed into him.
The next four days were rough for the criminal classes. John worked freelance, taking out two drug lords, one member of the Yakuza, and two known terrorist. John suffered a knife wound to the shoulder but other then that he was physically fine. His mood on the other hand had only seemed to darken all the more. He needed a break.
“That is if you’ll be around long enough. Like you said Sherlock has away of pissing people off.” Lestrade watched for John’s reaction. There wasn’t one.
Thomas true to his word had John expelled. It wasn’t long after that John enlisted so as to finish out his doctorate, but mostly to escape. He was angry, hurt and empty. His whole world was off kilter without Sherlock, and he needed an outlet. Afghanistan would be that.
"Oh darling, sleep was never an option." Sherlock's voice rumbled against John's shaft as he took him in his mouth.
“He speaks. Hello there Colonel Moran.” John never one to back down responded in kind. Jim, seemed to curl up next to Sebastian as he joined them.
“Sherlock.”  John hummed the syllables soft and low. “Sherlock.” Drawn out over long sighs, Sherlock knew that this was perfection. This was all there was and all there ever needed to be. John. Just John. And him. It was heartbreaking.
“Fine. So is this how things are going to go while he’s gone? One of you dropping in every so often to look in on me?”
"I. Think. We're. Done. Here!" Irene glared at Thomas's hand still clasped tight on her arm. "You let me know if we're not."
The man held up his head slowly coming back to his bleak reality. Three men had joined him at the table.
"Tea." Sherlock dralled in a tone usually confined to the bedroom as he sat down a cup on the table in front of the sofa where John had been napping. John felt the familiar jolt low in his belly at the hit of wicked in Sherlocks voice.
Sherlock took the seventeen steps in leaps and bounds eager to get back to the thumbnails he had waiting for him. On the top landing he stopped dead. The air was warm and full with a not an unpleasant but wholly out of place sent. Mandarin, osmanthus.
Was it 1800 something? Is that why it’s so cold? Is it cold? John’s fever consumed brain searched for answers.
Sherlock watched John's face by the fire light. He looked peaceful, beautiful, Sherlock had long ago catalogued every line of this mans face, every dusky blond eyelash, John's  lips curved into a soft smile and Sherlock realized that the watcher had become the watched.
So when the words came tumbling out of Sherlock’s mouth for the very first time in a harsh jurky groan while he was riding John’s cock like the devil, it was in fact perfect.
Molly piped in before Greg could speak. "I...I think she has something in her left hand...I...I thought that you maybe able to tell who did this if we can remove it." Molly smiled weakly up at an oblivious Sherlock. John noted this and felt horrible for the woman. They hadn't really told anyone that their relationship had changed though to most it had been obvious, but John made a mental note to find a decent way to break it to Molly. "I have a heat lamp. Shouldn't take more then forty five minutes. You could wait." Her eyes twinkled a bit.
“Not so much subterfuge Mr. Moriarty, as it is cautious apprehension. Force of habit you know.” John wore a chilly smile.
Sherlock slid down the wall just enough to bring them that final bit closer in all the right ways. John understood the action and hurried to wedged himself between Sherlock’s thighs pressing them as close as was possible. They kissed like battle. Each man hungrier then the other. Kissing dissolved into open mouth panting with their foreheads pressed together smiling into each other's eyes before the hunger would overtake them and the kissing would rage again.
John then licked his palm and cupped the head of Sherlock's cock, rubbing slick and precum from head to root. Sherlock white knuckled fist fulls of bed sheets. Two more fingers joined the first, Sherlock jerked his hips erratically fucking into John's palm in a panting frenzy. John teased and twisted his thumb and fingers lightly around and over the swollen purple head of Sherlock cock.  John was aching, his own cock so hard it hurt, leaking wet down to his balls.
"And that my love is how the dead will rise." John sat up and immediately cringed at the sticky cold feeling at his ear and the side of his face and chuckled.  "Shower?" John shuttered as he pulled his body free from Sherlock's heat.
“John please don’t mention my ass unless you have lecherous intent behind it.” Sherlock got up and joined John as he held the door open for him.
"Yes well if I'm going to be an idiot at lest I'm in good company." He winked at John and took a long sip.
John’s own brilliant smile and outstretched hand said it all. “DI Lestrade, I hear you’re the least incompetent of the bunch.”
“Willy nilly, what the hell?” John questioned through his bust of laughter, he twisted out of Sherlock’s embrace to face him, slipping his own hands into Sherlock’s back pockets pulling him close. “Love,” he began but thought better of it. “Sherlock I’m sorry. I never should have asked you to do something that I couldn’t. It was just...the only thing I could say right then. The only thing that fit yeah. Whenever you want to say those words I’ll be more then happy to hear them.”
“No, that would be evil. And stupid.” Sherlock offered a smile and the cigarette. Irene spread her hands in a conciliatory manner.
“I could have you right here, right now.” Hot breath tickled John’s ear and he could feel the proof of Sherlock’s words pressed up against his ass and had to create some space between them before just that happened.
Sherlock couldn’t help but think. “This is insanity.” Here he was the worlds only consulting detective rutting in an alley in Berlin with an assassin and loving it. Maybe if he weren’t constantly hungry for John every second they were apart, or maybe if this moment weren’t so perfectly exhilarating, maybe if the shock waves weren’t shooting through his body at the slightest brush of their cocks, maybe then he could pull himself (and his clothes) back together and find his way to sanity. John had other plans though. He grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and guided his large hand to nearly wrap around them both. John hissed at the feel of their cocks pressed together and jerked in Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock curled his fingers around them and stroked their cocks in this obscene and beautiful back alley wank.
"I know that, and as your leader, it's my job to not just complete the mission, but to keep my team alive in the process. See you in three days."
"Male." Sherlock glared at him, with a hint of impishness. John felt awash in heat at the single telling word.
”You knew I'd be here. Just like I knew the two of you would be here. What I didn't know was that he would be here.” John gestured with his glass to the young man on Sebastians right. ”Hello, Priest.”
Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose making sure it was only bloody and not broken. "Believe me when I tell you Thomas, you and your little clandestine trist where the farthest things from my mind." Sherlock cursed himself for his sharp words knowing it would earn him another good punch, but what was he to do? His mouth and his mind really needed to come to some sort of agreement.
"I've never really given it much thought. Children have always seemed like something out of the question for me. Therefore a desire one way or the other made little difference."
"Jesus." John hiss rolling his hips into Sherlock who jutted up to deepen each thrust. John braced his forearms on either side of Sherlock's head and kissed and marked a hot path over Sherlock's neck, and collar bones, ghosting words of love and forever over his rose hued skin, driving rhythmically and hard into Sherlock's center.
“No. I don’t. And when the time comes, I sincerely hope you won’t either.”  It was Sherlock’s turn to wink and walk away.
“Well you did." John could see that he'd shocked Sherlock. Good, he had intended for the words to sting. "Not because of the drugs. No. I don’t give two fucks about that shit. I'm disappointed because you didn’t trust me and because you never believe I loved you in the first place."
“Is ugly, I know and I’m sure you don’t want the things you’ve done we've done getting out and hurting the people you care about. So...let’s you and I together make sure that never happens. I need...well in a word, you. So...”
Lestrade's voice, broke through Sherlock's mind palace walls, bringing him sharply back to Barker St. John blinked awake and held his head up as well.
"I agree. Now if only I could convince him." John reach across the table for Sherlock's hand. Sherlock didn't pull away.
"Don't die. Lestrade, will be here any second." As if on cue, the blaring of siren could be heard growing louder in the distance.
Irene let herself in and stumbled into pitch blackness. She huffed and shut the door behind her. She stood in place and felt in her pocket for her cigarette lighter.  She flicked it creating a small circle of light, lit her cigarette and turned to flick on the lights.
“Copy that J.” What had been slated as a long term deep cover opt had turned into a near constant battle with every terrorist on the India Pakistan boarder.
Sherlock was in the kitchen only slightly bent over the table when John entered to continue their conversation. It was the eye contact this time that was John's undoing, changeable jewels saying all manner of roguish things. Well that and the pure sight of Sherlock standing there in his crisp white shirt cuffs rolled up, his hands splayed flat on the table one knee slightly bent and his bottom hugged in sinfully tailored black trousers. John took him right there on the table Bunsen burner and all. Pushing Sherlock down onto the table and grinding into his plush bottom, while John fumbled to undo the zipper that was keeping him from his desire.
Past. That sound. The sound of honey. Thick and sweet, heavy on your tongue. That sound was Sherlock.
"Or?" John pulled a round blue box from his breast pocket. "I didn't just come here to stop a wedding." He popped the box open. Inside where two white gold bands, one set with a single diamond, the other smaller and plan.
"Fine. But you do exactly as Lestrade says." Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes by way of answer, and darted for the stairs. He re emerged just as quickly, grabbing John by his shoulders and pressed kiss to his lips. Only to turn and rush back out.
"I've seen that box in your possession before." Sherlock said with a far away look on his face that said the gears of his mind where working quickly. "Three years ago. That's when I first saw the box. You were going to ask me...three years...but you never did..." Sherlock trailed off.
"This, of losing this. And losing you. I can't. I'd go mad." Sherlock tried to shake his head. John placed a steadying hand on his neck, and lets his thumb draw soothing little circles on Sherlock's jawline and earlobe.
It was a whisper, just like a secret. Sherlock went on. "I want your fingerprints all over my body, I want you inside me, I want to swallow you completely."  Sherlock's voice was a low rumble, each word sounded like hunger. John couldn't speak, couldn't think, all John could do was moan and lick and kiss and want. And right now he wanted to suck every one of  Sherlocks secrets out of him. John ran his mouth over the bulge of Sherlock's cock through his black cotton pants. Pleasure so intense shot through Sherlock making him arced sharply and thunk the back of his head against the wall. John repeated the motion, stroking him with his lips, as John then pushed his hands into the back of Sherlock's pants and kneaded his plush bottom at the same time.
"Jesus Christ!" Molly, staggered back against the double doors she'd just come through as she was met with the sight of John's tightly shut eyes and convulsing limbs bare bottom and thighs and his cock firmly down Sherlock's throat.
"I've never really given it much thought. Children have always seemed like something out of the question for me. Therefore a desire one way or the other made little difference."
Sherlock's eyes flew open and before he knew what was doing he'd rushed to the door. "John, I thought you'd be with your team."
“I do. I promise I do.” John sat up swiftly but carful not to pull them apart, and grabbed Sherlock’s face kissing his reassurance.
"I love...ahh...I love being studied. " John narrowly missed blurting out words that he's sure would send the younger man running in the opposite direction.
John’s control was no better lost to the heart pounding up and down on Sherlock’s cock, edging closer so quickly towards the boiling prostate orgasm. John encircled Sherlock’s throat with one hand, the other hand guided Sherlock’s hand to John’s painfully rock hard dick. John rocked on Sherlock’s shaft no longer up and down but grinding and jutting his hips back and forth his cock slinging in Sherlock’s clenched fist.
“Forever ring any bells?” John’s voice was hushed. They were close enough to feel each other’s heat, so close that their vision blurred to look at each other.
One of the large exposed brick walls was used as a projector screen, the items up for bid ranged from a dozen surface to air missiles to an actual Chinook, and everything in between. Each item was givens it's own brief description outlining it's capabilities then ten minutes where given to place bids. At the end of that time the next item was presented. The Sarin was last. It was presented with a video that was shot in the very cell John had been in less then a week ago. It was revolting. The group text went crazy. John had been in this line of work for the better part of a decade and he was very rarely surprised. The amount of people who wanted such a vile weapon and the price they were willing to pay surprised him. John made his bids watched the room and kept his eye on Sherlock. He glanced down at his winning bid. He knew he should have kept his eye on Jim and Moran but he simply couldn't be bothered. Sherlock made for the door before John. This was torture, being so close and not able to even speak to each other. It had been a huge risk for the few words they had exchanged, anymore would just  be inviting trouble. Sherlock trailed his fingers across John's table top and winked as he passed. The lump that rose in John's throat was accompanied by a renewed anger and drive to find and end the ones responsible for all that Sherlock had been put through. Though the man was still more beautiful then he had any right to be, his normally pale skin so like the hues of the moon, was waxy, his prismatic aqua eyes were dull, and he was thin. God he was thin. John hurt to watch him walk away.
“A second chance John. I’m not a good man. But I...I trust you, I do! More then any other person in the world. Please John. Forgive me." It was his heart and Sherlock offered it to John with both hands.
Sherlock watched John's face by the fire light. He looked peaceful, beautiful, Sherlock had long ago catalogued every line of this mans face, every dusky blond eyelash, John's  lips curved into a soft smile and Sherlock realized that the watcher had become the watched.
He pulled out his mobile and shot off a text to John. He turned the screen around and showed it to Victor before hitting send.
“Oh? Like who?” John waited for her answer and let the smile pull at the corner of his mouth. Sally misunderstood.
“Now? I have no idea. You see dean Grayson is Thomas’s uncle on his mother’s side. That’s their connection. That’s why people like me have been forced out of Kings. How Thomas had the power to expose and then get rid of whoever he wished. And Grayson, was all too happy to help his nephew, since he already had cause to hate me for his own reasons. I deduced his affairs with two different men, on two different continents. It was never really proven, but it was true nonetheless. So what now indeed.”
John looked back at Thomas, who was trying in vain to stop the flow of blood from his nose and curse at the same time. “You’ll pay for this Watson! You’ll pay for it and so will that little fuck boy of yours!” Thomas spat the words at the two of them, edging closer, Sherlock could feel John clench and unclench his fist at Thomas’s words, ready to finish what he had started, but Sherlock’s steadying hand on John’s for arm calmed him immediately. Sherlock tugged gently.
"I'm going to work them like dogs!" John winked at Sherlock and ran full tilt back on the pitch yelling. "I've got your captain right here boys!"
John rubbed his cock as he watched Sherlock crawl to the center of the large bed, he lay down legs slightly apart. John put his knees on the bed and sat himself between Sherlock’s thighs. John’s cock wet with saliva and precum slid between Sherlock’s ass cheeks rutting. Sherlock jerked and began to grind up into John's strokes. All the while a string of low baritone sounds drifted in the air. John stopped his motion with two firm hands on his ass. John couldn't help but sink his teeth into one plump cheek leaving a mark. The man beneath him yelped and almost jumped out of the grasp John had put on his hips. Almost. John held him firm and what followed was utter depraveity. John fucked his tongue into the heat that radiated from Sherlocks bottom rubbing the sensitive skin raw with the stubble of his cheek all the while skillfully ravishing Sherlocks most inner sanctum. Sherlock’s whole body shook, he was covered in thin sheen of sweat and his breath was harsh and ragged.
"You're right, it's not important finding him and bringing him home is. So...how do we proceed? I have a feeling this is going to be more then a one man job."
"Oh. Thats him isn't it? The one you've had your eye on but were too scared to talk to." Greg ribbed John laughing.
Soon I will have to credit all my good ideas to the brilliant conductor of light PatPrecieux. So if you enjoy our little moment of reflection you have only Pat to thank.
“Brillant. You're brilliant and it verifies depending on the turn of the day. Some days we rise. Others we fall. Today...I am risen." John flopped down on the bed arms open wide patting the pillow next to him. “Join me.”
"No. Really not that bad at all."  The mood in the room was shifting, good scotch, better company and a surprisingly intimate game. John grinned and moved on to the next question.
"Oh no you don't. No gorgeous deductions* for you right now. You're weak as a kitten."  John put his arm around Sherlock's, dangerously thin frame and guided him to a near by sofa.
Sherlock laughed. "No need. My sexuality is firmly in place." Sherlock guided John's hand to the proof of his words.
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed into the late night silence. Thomas. He quickly disentangled himself from a sleeping John and made his way to the far corner of the room before opening the text.
"Stuck in Switzerland. What do now?" Sherlock kicked off his shoes from his semi-reclined position on the sofa, taking long slow sips.
John had gotten them to a semblance of safety, but what he needed was to get them the hell out of Russia. That wasn’t going to happen for at least another four days or so, John finished bandaging his assets ribs, and moved to the burns on his thighs. They were not too deep and had basically cauterized themselves but they still needed to be cleaned and dressed. John worked slowly. Methodically. His patient could have internal burns from the electrocution, so the less the movement the better. The man hadn’t properly woken up since this ordeal began. His eyes flickered showing flashes of green and blue, like opal. A green eyed brunette naked beneath him. John huffed a rueful laugh. His assets injuries were harsh and he needed rest. So John settled next to the bed in the one room lodge and studied the sleeping figure before him. God he was young. As John had patched him up he’d wished he’d killed the Russian’s more slowly. There was also a lot of old scarring and John quickly found himself wanting to find the people who’d hurt this man and hurt them worse. To defile skin like that, so uniquely beautiful. John’s mobile brought him out of his thoughts before he had time to ponder them any deeper.
“My shoulder is infected isn’t it?” Sherlock asked sluggishly as the drugs began to closed his eyes.
John's eyes fluttered open, so dark and lifeless, not the bright ocean waters, Sherlock had fell in love with, these eyes where not Johns, this was not his John.
Sherlock set the lab on fire twice. He tried to tell himself that the mint green smoke he'd made had nothing to do with John Watson, but there was no point in lying to oneself.  Lapis blue eyes that danced between sapphire and midnight made thinking clearly a struggle. Some how Sherlock managed to get through the rest of the day without causing anymore damage.  He started towards the pitch and had to force himself to slow down. He felt silly for being so eager. Sherlock had always thought of himself as a man of science and reason. But then he laid eyes on John out there on the pitch running, wind in his hair, number 9 emblazoned on a jersey that seemed molded to his chest and the strength of his thighs...
“No No.” Sherlock stammered and John smiled and getting closer. “It’s not that. It’s just...the sun is no longer as it should be. It’s wrong. Because somehow...” Sherlock took a breath and stepped as close as he trusted himself to. “you’re the sun.”
Mycroft was powerless in the face of such pain. He wanted to make this go away but had absolutely no clue how to begin. He left.
“Cardinal needs you. It’s the St. Petersburg exchange. She’s too deep to contact you and too stubborn besides. She’s going to get herself killed.”
Sherlock moaned low into John's mouth as their kiss became a firestorm. Both being drawn into the blaze, caught up in the current. Clothing seemed to burn away. Once naked John rubbed his harsh stubble cheek over Sherlock's pale skin, leaving a trail of pink across his chest down his abdomen to the edge of dark curls. Sherlock yielded his body to John's desire and skill. And oh what skill it was. John left Sherlock smoldering over and over one well pleased kiss away from inferno.
"I'm going to explain this the easiest way I know how." John beckoned Sherlock to lean in closer as he spoke doing the same.  He slipped form his chair  and braced himself on Sherlock's knee. Nearly nose to nose, Sherlock was almost panting, his lips just the slightest bit parted. John closed his eyes and just marveled in the sent of Sherlock. The sweet heat of his breath, John filled his lungs and removed the last bit of distance between them. John lost his soul in that moment. Forever gone. Forever Sherlock's. Sherlock who's breath was soft, who's lips where soft, who's moan in the back of his throat was soft. John pulled back. He licked his lips and smiled. Sherlock sat quickly back in his leather chair wit a "thawp" noise. Pupils wide, cheeks flushed, running his fingers tentatively over his lips.
"I interrupted a private moment between a young man I use to room with and another young man he doesn't want anyone to know about. You see he's angry with me. He says I made him this way. Made him like men. His words not mine. And now whenever I see him he's either shoving me in a corner trying to kiss me, or shame me publicly as a whore."
“What!?” John stood up and reflexively grabbed his L9A1 from the small of his back as if the threat where right in front of him. “What happened...where is he...who has him!?”
“Thank you Athena.”  He and Sherlock had had this conversation not long after Sherlock had shown serious interest in the Doctor.
“I think it’s time for me to leave.” John collected his two drinks and shoved some money in a glass.
"Stop." Sherlock barely held up his hand. John felt his heart constrict, and he almost buckled at the pain. "In the two years nine months and four days we've been apart, I've had time to think. You didn't hurt me, you destroyed me. You successfully found my heart, cultivated it and then proceeded to rip it out." John had walked over to a near by chair to brace himself as Sherlock spoke, each word a blow that made him weaker and weaker. "That being said, it was no less then I did to you. Allowing you to believe that I was dead was...cruel.  I'm sorry. I wish I'd done things differently. I'd like for you to stay here wherever here is, with me, because like you, I believe we where never ment to be apart." Sherlock had moved off the sofa to stand directly front of John.
“And he hit the ground and his head collided with that step. And you were on him immediately, checking the bleed and calling for an ambulance. In less than a second you switched from solider to doctor and I, well, I found it amazing.”
“It’s not our anniversary,” John told him, flipping the card over in his hand. “And you left the price on the back.”
“Nothing of consequence.” Sherlock replied airily. “Tripped over while chasing a suspect. Quite spectacularly, I might add, but not a very interesting case.”
That was why John had found herself wearing shorts, because Sherlock made her feel better. They were white with a brown belt, and with her khaki shirt she felt a bit like an explorer, which helped her confidence a lot.
“Oh come on, babe, you know I didn't mean it like that,” Jim started, as John folded his arms across his chest. Jim leaned forward and wrapped his arm around John’s shoulder, pulling him closer into him so they were mere millimetres apart. Sherlock could see the tips of John’s ears going pink. “You're one of my best men; if you weren't then I wouldn't have promoted you as highly as I did. You being able to read as just a… bonus,” he grinned.
Slowly, cautiously, Sherlock let go of the headboard with his other hand and rubbed his eyes, pushing away all the sleep that had welded his eyelids closed during the night. He opened his eyes.
Honestly, if he’d known how good Sherlock was he’d have initiated a relationship years ago. Sod the politics, sod Moriarty, and sod every single thing that had ever stood between them. John was the happiest he’d been in years.
The top two shelves supported the ancient books, full of philosophies and guidance pertaining to people's Abilities. However, the very bottom shelf held brightly coloured red ring binders, all filed neatly and ordered properly.
“Fine, okay,” John said eventually. “Take my room. I’ve made the bed and I’ve left the radiator on. I’ll wake you up when dinner’s ready.”
“Okay, fine,” Sherlock countered, his usually pale cheeks slowly turning pink. “I do sometimes withhold the truth from you, but I’ve never once lied to you about… about that.”
“This is ridiculous,” he mumbled, watching the wolf as it bit the duvet and dragged it up over Sherlock’s legs again.
“Oh well,” the man smiled, and without so much as a glance towards Sherlock, departed back down one of the aisles looking somewhat dishevelled. The shelves remained mighty, forcing Sherlock to alter his theory.
Within an instant, the classroom door swung open and his father's arms were around him, picking the screaming Sherlock up and tucking him under his body as he stooped, protecting him from the billowing smoke. As they darted through the classroom and towards the fire exit, more eruptions of great powerful flames leapt up from other areas, completely unconnected to the corridor.
“You know you’ve ordered a main…” Sherlock started, brows furrowed as John shook his head and shoved the whole prawn cracker into his mouth before launching for a second.
Scowling heavily, Sherlock turned his head, and noticed that John had shut his eyes whilst he squirmed under Sherlock's weight, breathing heavily. He was acting as though he was in severe pain, and Sherlock momentarily entertained the possibility that he'd seriously hurt him, but that was dispelled immediately when Sherlock noticed that John was allowing himself to be controlled like this. After all, the original punch to his face had been solid and Sherlock had clearly noted the restrained force that had gone into it. There was a lot more potential behind that punch had John wished it to be there.
"What're you doing?" John muttered, still with his eyes shut and voice so low Sherlock could barely hear. The only reason he'd heard him in the first place was because he'd seen John's lips move slightly. "They'll know I haven't actually been in a fire," John continued, but Sherlock readjusted his grip on him (much to John's dismay), so that John was now facing towards Sherlock's body.
Opposite him, John brushed Rosie’s tufty hair with his fingers and fiddled with the velcro of her shoes, which were wonky.
John sighed quietly, looking down at his daughter who was now leaning back against him.!her little pink boots dug into his thigh as she wriggled and tried to turn. John let her, keeping a loose hold as she pivoted.
“Everything okay?” He asked cautiously, not daring to even look for the notebook or follow John’s gaze.
In short, the fact remained that Sherlock liked those confrontations. He could prove himself: prove that he was actually capable of looking after himself, despite what Mrs Merriweather often insinuated. But when someone wanted him and they knew about his Ability, that's when he worried. Too many past experiences had caused his anxiety levels to rise dramatically whenever the topic was brought up, so he avoided it as much as he possibly could.
Sherlock watched John thoughtfully. He knew that John’s words had been repeated many times, and that he had much more to say on the subject. He smiled slightly, listening to John talk.
Sherlock stared up at the man he’d collided with, and the man grinned down at him. In what little light drifted in from the busier street Sherlock had initially been running along, Sherlock noticed that the man had several golden teeth which stuck out amongst his dazzling white ones.
It was a freezing night. Frost was settling on the cars as puddles turned to ice and the mercury in the thermometer dipped below zero, but Sherlock had never felt warmer.
“Well, yeah. You really need to go to the hospital, though. I don’t have the right materials to make you a cast. It could probably do with x-ray, too. Plus we need to report the assault to Lestrade.”
Despite his aptitude for judging the moves people would make, John's fist colliding with the side of Sherlock's face momentarily disengaged him from all other thoughts running through his head. As such, he stumbled backwards, trying to regain his hazy balance. Even through the initial pain of being punched however,  it didn't take long for Sherlock's natural instincts to kick in, and he returned in full force upon the unwitting opposition, nestling his balled fist in the crook of John's solar plexus.
The room smelt like John. The tartan bedspread had been tucked under the mattress, uniform and military. Sherlock thought it looked more like the bedspread in a hotel, but then he considered his own, rarely made bed and decided he wasn’t able to judge anyone on how they made their bed.
The wolf looked up at Sherlock, tilted his head to the side, and then trotted from the room. Sherlock stared after it, then quickly checked the rest of his body for anymore serious injuries. A broken leg was one thing.
Once outside, John pocketed the cigarettes and the ginger nuts (they stuck out of his pocket awkwardly), and headed towards the nearest Underground Station.
John paused on the landing to the first floor and turned to face Sherlock, who very nearly collided with him as he went to take another step.
Sergeant Rose looked between Sherlock and John. It was a look John had been privy to on many occasions: “Is this man sane?”
Two tall glass bottles sat perched on the river cliff; the golden cider inside sparkled in the sun as the soft bubbles rose to the surface. The sunlight filtered through and refracted onto the freshly cut grass that swayed gently in the summer breeze. The light created flickering white shadows that danced on the blades, completely relaxed in the midday heat. One bottle was already half empty, but the other hadn’t even been opened yet. John sighed, making a mental note to put it in the stream until Sherlock was ready to drink it.
Sherlock often described his brain as a hard-drive. A machine. The component of a robot. John knew that Sherlock wasn’t a machine, though sometimes the reminder was appreciated. To see Sherlock dreaming humanised him slightly. But of course he knew that Sherlock was human. Of course he knew.
The robins stopped singing, deciding that they were no longer needed. Instead, they hopped along the path before flying into a local tree. Watching the scene from where they wouldn’t disturb it.
Sherlock would never talk to them about the anxiety attack. John found the blanket in the bin the following day.
The flat had been cleaned by Mycroft’s team. There was no dust, no dirty dishes (although that was thanks to Mrs Hudson, rather than Mycroft’s team), and there were absolutely zero hazards of any sort. Even the knife, which Sherlock used to stab letters onto the mantel piece, had been removed.
Something soft and thick collided with Sherlock’s face as the bed dipped awkwardly around him. Sherlock grabbed onto the headboard, his eyes still shut, as he felt as the duvet be dragged up his legs.
"I suppose," he reasoned. "But there're CCTV cameras everywhere these days, I don't think anyone can go for a full 24 hours without being watched by someone." He smiled, putting the book back into the Irish man's hands. "Come on, people will talk if they think the great Jim Moriarty spends his afternoons in a library. Especially seeing as most of the blokes who work for you can't actually read, they'll feel like you're betraying them,” John joked, but Jim shrugged, not seeing the funny side.
John watched him quietly for a few moments, but his mind was racing a mind a minute as impulses attempted to outrun logic, dodging and jumping over every sensible obstacle. His heart gave him all the adrenaline he needed.
The colour was blinding. The sky was a deep, periwinkle blue and the trees surrounding the park were a vibrant green. Puddles littering the grey pavement glinted in the sunlight and John could see everything. He smiled, completely in awe of the situation.
John frowned, taking a step closer to study the scar. “You were a victim?” He asked, brows furrowed together as his fingertips ghosted the scar. Sherlock was surprisingly warm, and he smelt faintly of burnt tobacco. “Of the Bethlem Beheader?”
“John Watson?” Mike laughed. “Blimey… What’re you doing here? Last I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. What happened?”
Each had been an easy case to solve (it took Sherlock less than five minutes for each, and that included typing his response), but the money he received was good and he used it to order Rosie some new clothes and a few toys. He had sent them to John’s address anonymously, but the stuffed bee and the story book about Marie Curie had given him away.
John kept Sherlock’s message in the top drawer of his bedside table, safe, the most sentimental piece to add to the collection.
“You don’t have any pressing engagements,” John said, folding his arms across his chest. “You were sitting alone, in this park, bleeding from about ten different places. I mean, you still are bleeding, but as your soulmate I have to insist that you don’t have any pressing engagements anymore. What you need to do, however, is either go to the hospital or allow me to attend to your injuries.”
“But what if I don’t?” He asked, looking down. “What if I’m one of those people who never meets their soulmate?”
“Look at me,” the man said, his rich, baritone voice anchoring John in the floodwaters of his thoughts. “It’s completely normal. This. Your brain is in overload. You’ve only seen grey for what, 34, 35 years? And now…” the man’s voice drifted. “Colour.”
Is this what it had come to, then? John lying straight to his face? Of course Sherlock had known about the phone calls. The nights where the doctor would vanish and return in the early hours of the morning, without saying a word. The quick glances at his watch, where after he'd then leave again. Sherlock knew that he always went straight to the telephone box at the end of the road. He knew that John was trying to hide something.
“We were on a case,” he said, knitting his hands together under the table. He twiddled his thumbs while he spoke. “And, well, you’d just rugby-tackled a man we were chasing. Do you remember? Over in Whitechapel.
“That’s not what I meant at all,” John bit back. “I’m unhappy with you because you’re an annoying, selfish, condescending prick.”
“Angelo’s…” Sherlock said slowly. “I said that women weren’t my area, and I told you I didn’t have a boyfriend.”
John took out his trusted notepad and pen and jotted down the date, time, and name. He knew full well that Sherlock didn’t require notes, so if he was directed into making them it meant that Sherlock deemed the case to be worthy of the blog.
He had been in relationships in the past. He had been in a very fulfilling relationship with his University’s rugby captain, and when said rugby captain was caught wanking off the scrum-half, Sherlock had fallen into a new relationship with drugs and subsequently drug addiction. He had enjoyed that relationship at the time, but it couldn’t last.
“Ah, hello Mr John and little Miss Rosie,” the man behind the counter said, smiling as John turned so that Rosie could see the man who had spoken.
"I've always wanted to burn this place down," he reasoned. John looked at him and grinned, and Sherlock found himself grinning just as brightly back.
John stormed back into the room, breathing hard and red faced. The phone was missing now, and John threw himself into his red arm chair, his hand immediately going to cover his face.
She paused to take one last look at the mass of black, to determine whether there was something there or whether it was her tired imagination playing tricks on her in the dark forest, but the mass had vanished. Harry sighed quietly and turned, with John in her arms, to begin the long walk back to the house and the safety of their parents.
,” John’s messy handwriting began, like shorthand elongated and warped into narrow italics. It was barely eligible.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, wrapping his free arm around Sherlock and holding him close. “I’m so sorry.”
Despite that however, Sherlock honestly didn't feel it necessary for Jason to break his Lego model, or to squeeze his milk carton over his head. Those (as far as he was concerned) were a bit too mean.
So, until John saw fit, Sherlock wasn’t working except for the few odd cases that drifted into his inbox. He had enjoyed solving a few of them: a vain woman in York was being catfished by her ex-girlfriend, who was using pictures of the victim but with photoshopped hair.
John had seen Sherlock cry on three different occasions. Really cry. Not faking it for a case, not when he’d walked into the kitchen while John was cutting onions. But genuine, full blown sobbing.
“Yeah, it was fine. Two missed calls off Harry. Mrs Hudson left some soup at the top of the stairs, too.”
“Hm.” Sherlock nodded. His blush deepened when John stood in front of him. They had been close before. Closer, in fact. But John could feel the electricity like static tense between them as he began to close the gap.
“I didn’t lie,” Sherlock said, watching an aeroplane as it disappeared into a dark grey blockade of cloud. “It was a misguided truth.”
John had fallen for it, Molly had fallen for it, the whole of Scotland Yard had fallen for it; the only people who recognised that Sherlock wasn’t as cold-blooded as he let on were Mycroft, Irene, and possibly Mrs Hudson although sometimes Sherlock wasn’t quite sure.
John’s eyes widened and he looked up at Sherlock, who was resolutely ignoring him. John was a crack shot, but he hardly knew why a gun would be a good idea in this instance.
John frowned. Sherlock wasn’t about to run away on him. No way. He’d been waiting far, far too long.
Sherlock made a feeble attempt to open his eyes, but they seemed welded shut and as Sherlock tried to push himself onto all fours, something large and heavy fell upon his back and pushed him back down to the bed.
“Why can’t you two just get along?” She mumbled, closing her copy of Death on the Nile on the first page, bookmark nestled securely in place.
“Sherlock, you make sure you tell me if John upsets you. If you don’t tell me, I’ll know anyway. I don’t want to see you get hurt again.”
John sighed and ran his hand through his hair. The bags under his eyes has grown heavier since Covid-19 has rolled into the UK.
7.	“The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have built me an empire, so don't even try to cry me a river. ‘Cause I forgive you. You are the reason I still fight.” - Throne, Bring Me The Horizon
Sherlock gave a non-committal hum in response, glancing up at John and offering her a smile before looking back down into the river. She snaked her arm around John's waist, planting her palm on her hip.
"Bundle up all the paper by the window," Sherlock ordered, throwing this collection of toilet paper onto the floor, and then watching as John did the same.
“It’s okay,” he said, turning his mug around so that the handle was in the right position to be grabbed easily. “You can make it up to me another way.”
She caught a glimpse of Sherlock beneath his duvet and reached out her small hands for him. John obeyed and lay her down next to the sleeping detective, who stirred and enveloped John’s daughter with the duvet.
Someone was rubbing sandpaper against his face. Sherlock tried to shove it away but he was so weak he could barely move his arm. He grunted, and the sandpaper stopped.
"'Came to find me'?" Sherlock repeated, scoffing. "You were dragged in by security guards, quite literally." He said, and some of his bubbling panic dissipated at the sound of John's laugh.
Sherlock could hardly register what he was hearing, but he knew that what he was being told paled in comparison to the bruise swelling on his arm.
That explained why he was so grumpy lately. If he was managing three(ish) jobs, then that was a good enough excuse for being snappy and short-tempered. The more Sherlock pushed him, the more infuriated he became. Of course he’d stormed off earlier, after such a little argument too. Sherlock was almost crying.
“I'm a doctor, of course I can read,” John scoffed. “And the highest promotion is ‘the boss’s boyfriend’, is it?” He asked as his scowl broke out into a smile.
He could feel nothing but pain. He wished they’d just knock him out, get it over and done with, but as he screamed in pain the kicks died away.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, lifting his head to look at John as he opened the door Mrs Hudson had closed on her way out.
Mrs Hudson and Sherlock were sitting opposite one another. Sherlock sat in his usual chair, and Mrs Hudson sat in John’s. Both of them had cups of tea and their sides, and Sherlock was holding a battered old paperback.
The next chapter will be up on Tuesday bc my uni is mean and demanding my full attention tomorrow (but hypocritical seeing as they abandoned us for six weeks for strikes but, you know, go off).
Sherlock took a step backwards as Mrs Safely stood up, making her way around the desk with a book clenched tightly in her hands. Her purple ballet pumps were silent on the floorboards, with Sherlock being equally as quiet as followed closely behind.
So, here’s what I thought: if anyone would like to request a fanfic, for free, now is the perfect time to do it! I’ll write it, I’ll post it, I’ll dedicate it to you. Because when the world is scrambling for answers and we’re all trapped inside to keep ourselves and others safe, we need to work together for each other. Some of us aren’t so lucky to have our own Sherlock or John to leave gushing notebooks lying around declaring their love for us.
6.	“No more lights in the skyline. No more plans in the pipeline. Only you make me feel right; it’s where I wanna be. Long days, we're together and these nights last forever. Could it ever get better?” sad songs, kwassa
But John’s heart was swelling with so much love for the bond his daughter and his best friend shared that he barely heard what Sherlock said.
He remembered Sherlock lying on the cold wet slabs of the pavement outside St Bart’s, his hair thick with rain and blood and John’s stomach churned as he too fell back onto the same pavement. Still alive but slowly dying.
"That's not important. Break." Sherlock responded, having a bit too much fun as he watched the scene unfold. "But what I have to say is crucial to your walking out of this building, so I suggest you listen. Over."
His clothes weren't expensive, as Sherlock had already noted, but with an apparently wealthy boyfriend he should be able to afford finer things to wear. Or rather, be bought more expensive things. Yet, he remained in the cheaper brands. Why was that? Was it all clothing from before they'd gotten together? Or was John really not much of a scrounger? But the shoes were expensive. Sherlock frowned.
“But I want to repay you,” John stated. “Which is why I’ve booked a holiday, if you’d be, er,” he shuffled awkwardly on his feet, looking at the ground with his hands stuffed in his pockets.
Black smoke blocked the lights like thick storm clouds cover the sun, and the corridor was cast into an unnerving darkness. The only light source being the orange flames running along the walls and catching onto the artwork displays.
“Hm, I did, actually.” Sherlock nodded, looking over the book cover. “Not enough murder for my taste, though. We’re reading Death on the Nile next.”
“I’m surprised you managed to hear anything over all the shouting,” Sherlock said, groaning as he pushed himself up into a better sitting position. John pulled his hand away and marched off to the kitchen, but Sherlock was pleased to spot a small smile playing across John’s face before he turned his back.
"Who is this? Over." Came the static response, both men somewhat puzzled as to who was communicating with them. As Sherlock watched, Bear 2 began hurriedly checking his belt.
Of course his mum and dad had worked it out, and Mycroft had simply sneered it at him as he passed by on his hunt for a glass of milk once they'd returned home. Although Sherlock did point out that Mycroft was a telepath, and therefore his coming to the conclusion wasn't as impressive as his own.
It was a pleasant, warm, gentle kind of the day where the sun fluttered down and rested upon the countryside. It wasn’t overbearing, it wasn’t too hot, and the breeze which rolled over the nearby lavender fields brought a freshness to the air. Changing his mind, John headed towards the garden and pulled out two more deck chairs. The day was too nice to stay indoors.
“You bought Rosie clothes and toys and a book about Marie Curie. Sherlock, she’s barely a year old. She can’t read. She likes cuddly toys and funny faces, she’s not interested in science.”
Sherlock supposed that, really, his soulmate ought to enjoy his deductions. They were a solid part of his work, and by extension is personality. When John had approached him, Sherlock had known that he wouldn’t back down. That he was acclimatised to violence. That he was a man born to help. Sherlock had known right from the off that there was very little that could deter this man.
They kissed slowly, softly, with all the gentleness of a flower petal fluttering down towards a bed of fluffy grass.
John took a deep breath, then shook his head and looked down. His hands clenched into fists at his sides, then unfurled themselves. Sherlock noticed that he was shaking.
“Hello, sounds brilliant. But it’s just myself and Erebus. The rest of the boys are scattered like the wind.” Odin’s tone was jovial.
“Mycroft. I haven’t done anything, so why are you here?” Sherlock didn’t turn from his music stand scribbling away and adjusting his violin strings.
"God save us from Cluedo!" John took a seat on the floor with his back leaned against one of the two leather chairs. They stood on either side of the sofa which was facing a fireplace almost large enough for John to stand up in. He kicked off his shoes, sat the bottle of scotch off to the side and let his head tilt back and to the side so he was facing Sherlock. "We could..." John rolled his hear side to side. "Oh, I know! We could play 20 questions."
John sat forearms resting on bent knees on the ground of a small rise that over looked the military base and the town of Sangin, where scattered columns of black smoke from the nights battles mixed with the pinks and purples of the rising sun. He’d been up since this time yesterday, the fighting had been intense and the casualties steady, so his morning coffee was doing little to keep sleep at bay at this point. He knew he should catch an hour or two before more casualties began to pore in, but the thought of closing his eyes to the monsters of his dreams was a less appealing thought then dropping dead of exhaustion. Most nights his dreams were riddled with broken and bloody screams and he would wake drenched and panting. Those were the nights John welcomed, those horrors were real, and he could lay hands on those demons in the day light and drive them away. It was the other dreams, the ones of eyes the color of winter rain fanned by dark lashes, as a musical swirling baritone uttered “John” that left him shaken and lost. There was no fight against ones own heart. John marveled at the mans grip on him still. He often wondered if he ever crossed that brilliant beautiful mind. The local landscape didn’t help matters much either. The over abundance of tall thin men with dark curls had sent John’s heart rate skyrocketing more times then he’d care to admit. But admit it he did. Six years on and John had had nothing more meaningful then a two night stand. Love was no longer his to give. Nor did he seek it. Because their was only one source that could fill his needs. So he would live his life out in the sun and sand and conflict, doing good where he could and hopeing each day a bullet would fill the hole in his heart.
