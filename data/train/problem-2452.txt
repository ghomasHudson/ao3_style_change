“Well, anyway,” the sommelier said, after a moment, “here’s the list of things I think he’ll like, but it’s just a guideline. Er… enjoy.”
"She's at work, where the hell do you think she is?"
It was beautiful. A little sloppy around the edges, but he could see where he should have been more careful. His hand was steady as he put the plate on the table.
When we pass the car, the machine stops and moves to get in, but I keep walking.
"Don't want to
"I did not." I shook my head. "I don't know what I was thinking, but I've carried them next to my heart since then, with you in mind. I didn't know the laws would change, I didn't know any of it would even be possible, but I have— you would not call me a marrying man."
he replied.
"Three surgeries do leave a mark," Sherlock remarked, running his fingers over the injury.
"The agar works like gelatine," Sherlock said, "but more quickly, and it's less horrible. You'll like this, I know you will."
"If you'd like me to," he said.
"Toilets are there," Mrs Hudson put in, pointing to the alcove.
"Do I strike you as the kind of man to whom things are done without my permission?"
"Where else would he be?" John asked.
“I’m wrong,” I gasp, “everyone knows!”
Of course Sherlock couldn't sacrifice a cook in the middle of dinner service without needing a replacement. The kitchen wasn't in chaos without Paul yet, but everyone had been working at a pretty good clip since they'd started and they would fall behind quickly. He couldn't let that happen.
I went back upstairs and sat in my empty sitting room, the cold compress held to my own face. It helped my jaw immensely, but I didn't feel better. Where could Holmes have gone? Had he rushed off to finish our case without me? At this hour? Why?
parents."
Sherlock grinned.  "But not by thinking about it," he said. He reached the distal end of the scar, halfway down John's arm where it curled around the back, and switched to John's torso. John's nipple was right there, stiff and peaked. "I'm glad," he said, giving it a little lick.
"I'm not sure what I've suggested."
"Well, I do; you pay half the rent."
Sherlock reached him and put a reassuring hand on his bad shoulder. John jerked away, clapping a hand over his mouth to keep in a whimper, and Sherlock let go in surprise. The loud blast of the fire extinguisher broke through the cotton wool in his brain. He turned away, mortified, and banged his hip on the corner of the cupboard. Sherlock said his name again, but John couldn't face him. He was already through the swinging door and into the dining room.
“No, thank you, Inspector,” I said, plucking at my damp collar and flapping my unbuttoned coat. “I think we shall walk. Watson?”
The tightness in John's chest eased, and he found himself smiling at the bacon as it began to sizzle. "Good," he said. "Me too."
He went down on one elbow above me, laughing against my mouth, and tipped his head back. “You’re quite serious,” he said, looking into my eyes.
"I need a barback and at least two other bartenders for the dinner rushes," Sarah agreed. "Are you going to serve food at the bar?"
“Yes, Sherlock?”
"Well, Harry, John," Mary was saying, "thank you for coming to your review."
"No," John said, "I liked that one. And they're in season at the same time."
I was sure I was blushing. I had no cause to imagine our relations would turn physical so quickly, but Holmes's demeanour did have an intensity to it I only recognised because I'd experienced it the night before.
That only made him blush harder.
go backwards. As soon as this New Scotland Yard is done with me I will finish the job I started two centuries ago. I should have walked into the sea, not into a vat of honey. I will not be forced to endure a minute longer than necessary of this hellish world—
I scratched my fingers in his pubic hair and stroked his outer lips as he sighed against my mouth. His hand not in my hair reached across his body to pinch my nipple. I dipped my fingers inwards; his quim was slick and soft, welcoming my touch. I felt him heave another breath and took the opportunity to bite his lower lip until he moaned. Then I turned my head aside and applied myself to his neck, alternately biting softly and sucking hard enough to leave a mark.
As we grew to know one another, as I became introduced to his work and the inner workings of his mind, my respect, awe, and fondness for him deepened.
He nodded, grateful. "Desperately."
The machine meets me on foot as I approach the gates to the churchyard. It says nothing, just holds the gate open for me.
"Harry!" John flailed, fully aware that they could be heard in the kitchen. "We're done here. Thanks for stopping by. When we're ready to open, I'll make sure you get an invitation."
Mr Simpson, stone-faced, grunted, "Don't know," and wouldn't elaborate.
I scratched my own fingernails in the hair at his groin, gently, touching the base of his prick almost accidentally with the V of my thumb and forefinger. He pressed his hips up into my hand, whining softly in my ear, until I took pity on him and closed my hand around the column of his cock. The sigh that came from deep in his chest was most gratifying. It had been such a long time, weeks, since I’d held him like this.
"I should," John said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward the bridge across the Thames and the distant South Bank. It was after nine, and the early morning start they'd had was dragging on him.
Lestrade appeared in the doorway. "John?"
as bad as the videos showed, even when he was in control instead of chafing under the yoke of someone else's ideas, then John would wash his hands of him.
He always followed it up with "doctor" or "fellow"; it was never such pure, distilled affection. "Discuss what?" I asked.
"Excuse me, just a minute," he said, signalling Lestrade, who stepped smoothly in to suggest a few things Sebastian might want to take pictures of as the sous-chefs worked. John headed for the office on a hunch.
The kiss regained its coherency, and Holmes caressed and embraced me as we subsided. I worked my slick hand out from between us and held it aloft even as I tried to keep him from relaxing into the mess I had made of my belly. We were suspended for a moment, breathing together. His body was warm everywhere we touched, and his smile was one of amusement and satisfaction. His hair was a wreck. Color still rode high upon his cheeks. I kissed his face and mouth, the former reverently and the latter deeply. He sighed and sat  up, easing himself out of me with care and stumbling off the bed to find a soft cloth.
The list of restaurants he had worked at since receiving his culinary degree was in the double digits, thanks to his abrasive personality and crippling need to be right all the time, and a slew of articles John found from various foodie magazines—
"I couldn't secure the scene," Lestrade told me. "I was the third Inspector called here. It's a right sight inside." He gave a dramatic little shiver, and I felt a tingle of fear at what we might be about to encounter even as my heart began to pound with excitement. "Gruesome" wasn't Holmes's favorite type of crime, because he always said the stranger the situation the more clear-cut the solution, but it did make for good entertainment literature. Not that I should be thinking of my publications at a time like this.
being married to you did the day before yesterday."
John smiled. "It's fine," he said. "It's all fine."
Holmes made a noise of impatience. "Quick, man!"
"You've watched me cook on telly, and I haven't cooked in over a year."
"I hate to see you in pain," I said.
John bit his lip. "Probably should let you," he said. "Go on, it's just a little stiff."
I bent to kiss his forehead. "If any man were an island."
Harry winked at him, grinning and cheeky, and went to prepare the griddle. John looked at the chicken, then at the guacamole, the salsa, and the beans that were soaking and still needed to be cooked. Everything in Mexico was eaten mashed anyway, he thought. He'd never been there. He doubted many of the judges had been. The rice, simmering gently on the hob, caught his attention again. If he forgot about it for too long it would be ruined.
reason, nor would they respect the choice. Marriage was for lovers. All the people who had fought long and hard in the courts would have disdained us for taking advantage of the institution.
"I can't fire you," John reminded him. "We're partners."
Sherlock went white. "Get out," he said. His hands had clenched into fists at his sides, and he was vibrating with rage. He pulled himself up to his full height so that he towered over Moriarty, and even John felt the urge to take a step back. "Get
"Very good, sir," Mrs Hudson said, hiding a smirk. "I do hope you decide to stay, Doctor Watson," she said, bless her. "I know how Mr Holmes would like a companion. Someone to share the rent with. Someone to keep him out of trouble."
"Watson, I say."
He raised an eyebrow at me, which made me blush, but he sat down anyway.
"Just fine, thanks," Sarah said. "I'll probably head out around three, so I can get to work by five."
Holmes’s fingers moved in my hair, restless, and above me I could hear him breathing hard. I glanced up at him; his nipples were stiff peaks, and his head was stretched back. The beginnings of a ring of bruises was visible on his throat. God damn the Cunninghams. I stroked Holmes’s cock as I sucked it, my hand slick with my own saliva as it escaped the corners of my mouth.
Sherlock shushed him. "Not in front of the sous-chefs," he said.
"Ultrasonic, eh?" John asked. He gave up on the chair and crossed the room to climb up onto the bed beside Sherlock.
"Holmes–" he protested, but I waved a hand in his direction.
"Fuck right off," John replied, walking up to him and poking a finger in his face. "What you said was totally inappropriate."
John licked his lips and stared down at the tub of pea butter for a moment. "Well," he said. "She wasn't exactly happy to see me, but she did come of her own free will. Unless Clara strong-armed her, which is entirely possible."
"Hm," said John. Despite his best efforts, he was visualising the decor of Fifth Northumberland in this space and coming up short. They'd definitely be starting from scratch here.
John blinked. "Not much. A bit. Kind of a naughties fad, wasn't it?"
"We'll go home this afternoon, perhaps," I said.
back: not his youth nor his old age. But could I be satisfied with a simulacrum? Is it close enough? I will not be rid of it. Now that it knows our secret, I do not want it replaced or destroyed. It is almost a comfort, to think that we know something no one else has bothered to learn.
"Well," John said, "I spent a semester in Afghanistan during university, and one of the things I took away was an appreciation for the cool days of spring, and for the way they prepare meat. I knew the pistachios would go well with the lamb, and the cous-cous was included to complete the meal without making it too heavy a dish."
"Not a problem."
"It is now," I lied.
"John," Sherlock said again, and John heard him get up from the armchair, "you can't just—"
," he says, resting his hand gingerly upon my belly. Neither of them are clean. "Never mind. We have another chance. You're going to love this world, Sherlock. Once you've learned it."
He places my hand upon his round shoulder and slides his palm up my ribs. I shiver at his touch. My blood pounds in my veins. This is deviant behavior more extreme than I have ever exhibited; of course Watson would be involved.
"I'll have to ask Sherlock. Probably not. Gauche."
Sherlock was standing in the kitchen, a slab of hardwood in each hand, atop which smoked an array of artisan mushrooms. He met John's eyes as John ascended and gave him a look that managed to combine relief and disdain.
sleep to tell me this.
No, women pose no threat; it is men I have to worry about now. I believe Watson had some small experience with men when I first seduced him— he knew where to put his hands, anyway, and didn’t leave the room in disgust when I suggested certain acts— but his attractiveness to men has obviously increased since we began our affair. He is appreciated in a way he wasn’t before, and it makes me burn.
"Fuck off," she hissed.
"Let's see how this goes first," he said.
"Brilliant," John said. After a moment, he went on, "He's got a grudge against you, hasn't he?"
Indeed, Sherlock only pushed harder, easing John's cock to the back of his throat. He held for a beat while John shuddered, and then pulled away slowly, lips dragging up John's length. He repeated the trick a few times, moving like molasses.
I took a coward's way out and escaped my old life, determined to wander the world until I had eroded everything that made me weak and soft and in love with him. Then came the news, through channels my brother had insisted upon, that his wife had died. All of the work I'd done unraveled, and I turned for home immediately. I couldn't let him be alone.
"Watson, of course," I lied. "He is the romantic, you know, and I am… oblivious to the softer emotions."
"Year and a half," John said vaguely, though he knew the time to the day.
here to keep you in line."
"Consider me warned," John said. A kiss would have suited him nicely, too, but that was definitely out of the question. He stood up and opened the office door to lead Sherlock out.
"Johnny," Frances said, "no need to be rude."
"Just think, Watson," Holmes murmured, giving me a squeeze. "It will never be 1895 again."
“Helping?” I asked. I kept my voice low, in deference to the hour.
"Don't talk to me about finances," Sherlock replied, obviously annoyed, "it's disgusting. Is it even safe for you to be here, in your delicate condition?"
The narrator and the ward moved on from manual stimulation to oral, and had begun to gamahuche each other in an ambitious-sounding
"I shouldn't have run off," I said.
," Sherlock said, with unexpected enthusiasm. He swung his legs around and sat up. "Is there something good nearby? I want lamb." His hair, disarranged by the friction of the duvet and the vehemence of his phone call, formed a frazzled halo around his head.
He waited until John had set his plate aside, stacked his own on top, and then stepped onto the coffee table and slid into John's lap.
Watson’s eyes widen. “He
We stood uncomfortably for a moment. Watson was rigid beside me. "I suppose you could call that a detour," I said finally.
He glanced at me sideways, trying to see if I was joking or not. I wasn't, not really. I hadn't planned on marrying again at all, and I certainly wasn't going to after this. This was it, even if I'd been right about our pragmatical reasoning.
Then there was the time I'd rushed to Lyons to rescue him from himself, his room littered with telegrams and the man himself in a heap on the bed. He'd felt so thin in my arms, the strain of the work tolling on him physically and emotionally. I made him go on holiday with me to Reigate, and, though the holiday turned into a working holiday, witnessing his revival was deeply satisfying. I have always enjoyed taking care of him.
Talk of his wife, and subsequently his children, distracted Mike sufficiently, and John could relax a little while he listened to the mundane family stuff of someone else. They were interrupted eventually by the waiter, placed their orders, and fell into silence again when they were left alone.
My hand not holding the book had drifted, and now lay on my thigh. My pulse throbbed between my legs, and as I read I found myself rubbing my thumb up and down along the seam of my trousers. It pressed the fabric of my trousers and drawers against the swelling head of my prick.
“I’m afraid I’ve interrupted you,” I said, more calmly than I felt.
"Yes," I admitted. "He got away into the alleys."
"I know what I'm looking at when I see it," Sherlock said. "You know how to run a restaurant. I want you to run mine." He started to grin as John's resolve wavered. "You know you want it.
“Ugh, for God’s sake,” Sherlock snorted, picking up the next plate, “have these people ever seen a tomato in their lives? Whoever did this is out.”
"Mycroft will be there. His assistant."
"I didn't offer you a lease," Sherlock said.
a reason."
Rather than stay and plead our story, Holmes grabbed me by the hand and took off; we ran for it like common street thugs.
"Oh, thinking ahead, are we?" John teased. "Bit ambitious?"
You're business partners now; isn't that what partners
"—And we need to move quickly. We need to get our menu finished. Did
"And wouldn't you like to keep it that way?" John asked. "Actually, I think they're starting to like you."
love it. Talk about a slap in the face."
If she didn't suspect me of indecent behaviour, she'd have the maid do it.
John shook his head. "Sometimes I'm not sure why he brought me in, if he's just going to buy whatever he wants.”
"Stay," Sherlock said, putting a hand on his hip when he started to turn over. "Just…" John felt the bed dip as Sherlock joined him, and then his shower-warm thighs brushed against the backs of John's. He had more lube, smeared onto John's overheated skin, and then two of his fingers sank deep into his arse again. John's knees skidded apart. He rested his head on his arm and breathed slowly as Sherlock fingered him, teased him, worked him open to be fucked. John could feel the nudge of Sherlock's cock against his buttock. Sherlock touched his prostate with more regularity now, getting him used to the sensation, and John moaned at every little flash of pleasure. He was too fucking old to get it up again right away, but if Sherlock played him right—and John was dead certain Sherlock could do that—he'd be hard again pretty soon.
She scowled. "That's none of your business."
"Sherlock," it was saying—a man, late thirties, perhaps early forties, definitely Public school— "despite your apparent desire to throw my offers to help back in my face, I can't help but notice that your very fine kitchen is absolutely packed with equipment, and that your allowance is entirely depleted this month, as is your advance for next month."
"That could just be the… the, er…"
"Little busy here, Sherlock."
He flashed me a grin. "I'm nearly there."
John grinned. "Good," he said. "You're brilliant, and amazing, and everyone coming tonight can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve, yeah? They're ready to be impressed, Sherlock."
"Well, she did drop by a few weeks ago to shout at me and hasn't been in touch since."
"Oh, well," Watson said. He was leaning into my shoulder, the warm bulk of his body pressing against mine and unbalancing me slightly. To correct the imbalance, I removed my arm from between us and put it around his shoulders. "Perhaps I did say that," Watson went on, "but I am rather drunk at the moment." As if to prove the point, he drained the bottle of wine. "Would it be rude to leave this here?"
"Women have never suited me. I'm sure you drew that conclusion on your own."
“Dr Watson has been arrested on suspicion of prostitution,” I said, “which is a gross and ridiculous insult. Dr Watson is my assistant.”
It was John's own fault for going into the kitchen looking for them instead of obeying his fire safety training, but he had been disoriented with sleep, and the radio and lights had both been left on.
"Your sister's Clara?" Sherlock asked, millimetres from John's ear. He was leaning into John's shoulder, holding a newspaper off to the side, and he smelled like coffee. "You didn't say she was a restaurant reviewer."
Working their way through the reds was a slower process; there were more bottles that Sherlock wanted to try, and now that he'd warmed up to the idea of three support taste-testers rather than just one, he made them each sip, savor, and report. Molly was getting giggly, leaning on Greg, and Greg was not much better off. John's palate was starting to become fatigued.
"Sherlock, I've told you it won't work."
John had pre-selected the thirty full orders from Sherlock’s working menu, but only about twenty of them made it onto their plates property. Molly and her assistant Toby made the best showing, plating twenty six orders properly, but it was mostly because she’d come up with the desserts herself.
“We’ll need your statement tomorrow, then,” Lestrade said. “I’ll send a constable 'round to take it down.”
Beside me, Watson is cold and still. My heart skips a beat and I turn over to grab at him, shaking him. Not again. Please, I can't, not again.
I had to stay close to my man. On a street known for peddling perversions, I didn’t want to loiter and give the impression I was a policeman, so I began perusing the boxes that stood outside the shops while keeping one eye on my quarry.
"We can do it in the morning," John said. "What else is there to get ready? You're the one with the menu. A little time alone to make some decisions might be good for you."
“John,” he said, his voice gone low and rough, “I am working.”
“You have
"It's what I was discussing with my brother. He made it clear that I ought to tell you the truth."
“No,” he said. “I need to sleep.”
John looked down again, entranced by the movement of Sherlock's hair across his forehead, the fan of his eyelashes against his cheeks, the slick drag of his mouth. Sherlock's tongue came out and licked at his fully exposed head, gentle as anything. He tongued at John's slit, licking away the fluid that gathered there in John's arousal, and John watched his expression flicker into bliss. He raked Sherlock's hair away from his face, blunt fingernails dragging, and felt Sherlock moan as much as he heard it.
"I don't think they'd like to hear you call chicken and waffles a fad," John said, dragging him inside by the elbow. "Come on, you'll enjoy it."
Sherlock was regarding him seriously when he lowered his hands. They stared at one another for a moment. Behind Sherlock, the contractor and his boys were working away, talking in undertones and providing a little background noise that eased the tension a bit.
"I may have implied to Lestrade that people
Number 221 was a short walk from the Baker Street tube station, and it was a damned strange place to think of sticking a restaurant. Marylebone Road was crammed with traffic, and Regent's Park was always full of pedestrians, but Baker Street itself was mostly corporate offices and residences. A few souvenir shops spilled their wares onto the pavement, and John passed a Tesco and a Costa as he walked up the street. Not exactly the classiest spot for a high end eatery.
The machine they have saddled me with is terrifying. A "compudroid," the young Lestrade called it. I do not pretend to understand how it works inside, but it speaks to me with Watson's voice as if it knows me. As if it knows
"Did you want me to say more?"
"The hood exhaust is going to take a week?"
"How clever
"He did! I convinced him to do it on the grounds that we ought to—"
His voice is so rough, reduced to a whisper, and I think,
He harrumphs and I can hear the pillow rustling. When I fit him back between my lips, his moan is reduced to a rumble.
"Any of it." I felt sick.
He opened his eyes in surprise. "Apologise?"
Sherlock huffed a sigh and hopped off the hot cupboard he'd been sitting on. "That was good, what you did the other day."
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes innocently wide. "No, no problem at all. Is she qualified for the job?"
"Sorry, old boy."
I blinked at him.
"What?" John asked. "What's that look about?"
"Regardless, I accept," he says, smiling.
The rest of the ride back to Baker Street was done in silence. Holmes and I alternately stared at one another and looked away, unable to maintain eye-contact but unable to resist seeking each other out. The cab coming to a halt outside our dwelling was a boon, and I jumped out first. Holmes ignored my outstretched hand and stepped onto the pavement, tossing a coin up at the driver.
"Sorry?" Watson asked.
"I'll be ready."
Holmes had gotten too warm, he said, and we'd taken our bottle outside into the lane. He'd left his coat behind. I looked around for it now, and found it hung up inside the door. Good. Anyway, we'd gone outside to sit on a wall. It had been quieter, and Holmes and I could more easily talk with one another. We spent every day together, and we'd decided to escape the crush of the public to have
"Not in wine."
"I don't think you know Harry that well."
“Out.”
Sherlock grudgingly showed the crew into the restaurant kitchen to perform the final—and, as John reminded him, legally necessary—installation work, while John laid out the plastic drop cloth in the dining room in preparation of the repaint. Mrs Hudson had been glad to see the wallpaper go, and even happier to help patch once it had been torn away, and now it was John's duty to paint the whole room white so that they could pick a final colour. Sherlock was pulling for an aubergine that John knew would make the room as crypt-like as before, but they hadn't come to blows over it yet. Personally, he was hoping for a shade of red.
When I climbed into bed beside Holmes only a minute later, he was already asleep.
"Ooh!" Sherlock let go and dropped himself back onto the bed. "It's a passion fruit juice alginate spherification as the yolk with thickened clarified juice as the albumen, served in a cracked quail's egg shell."
"I'm sorry," he says, misunderstanding, "I shouldn't—"
Sherlock was standing with his arms crossed, so John crossed his as well, and Sebastian arranged them standing almost back to back, with John's shoulder in front of Sherlock's. He crouched low and took a few shots from there, and then a few more straight on while Moriarty smirked behind him. Then he made John put his hands on his hips, and took a few more. They did some nonsense with some kitchen props, holding them menacingly, and then Sherlock reached the end of his tether.
"Gregson!" Sherlock snapped. "Get the deep fryer ready; I've given you a head start on their orders and they haven't even placed them yet. I'm doing you a favour."
"Sherlock," he said, after a table full of malbecs and cabernet savignons, "if you'd let us go for a proper drink, rather than trick me into doing an important tasting, we could stop for a minute and put something in our stomachs. Chips, maybe. We're doing this half of the room a disservice."
"I missed you terribly," I admit. "I'll never forgive myself for letting you go first."
Not yet. Reviews might make or break their first few weeks of business, but they were going to get more than from just Moriarty or the
We sank, entwined, back into the bath. It was still warm. Enveloped in comfort, we rested, silent, breathing together. I tingled all over with pleasure; aftershocks darted up my thighs. Watson's chin was hooked over my shoulder, his arms around my middle.
I let my head fall back to the pillow. My hand is still held in his. I rest my other hand on his warm, solid chest. "Perhaps not to bed a man, but to bed a machine?"
"Well, I think it's refreshing," I said again.
Sherlock sighed, "Hm."
him, I just needed to keep him. "The truth is it's much more complicated than your royalties, or our furniture."
“Lestrade came to fetch me,” I said, “to get you out.” I turned around to address the constable at the desk. “Hopkins! Release this man at once.”
“Shut up, Watson.”
John picked it up between forefinger and thumb, smelled it, and then sucked it into his mouth. It dissolved on his tongue, the tomato soup sensation and flavour striking him all at once.
Sherlock grinned. "You’re the boss."
I picked up the top volume and opened it. The frontispiece was a drawing of a young lady with her bosom exposed and her skirts drawn up to show her thighs and cunny. She was holding a switch in her hand, and was in the middle of beating the buttocks of a curly-haired man bent over a chair. He was in an apparent ecstasy of agony, for his prick was long and stiff from the beating.
John turned to it again and folded his hands behind his back. He shrugged. "It needs a bit of work," he said, trying to be tactful.
“Robbed a jewellery store,” I said. “Hardly worth my time, on an intellectual level, but it kept me busy.”
"That's bollocks and you know it."
"Through pitching a fit, Sherlock?" Moriarty asked sweetly. "You're so lucky to have
"Mm," John said finally, when Sherlock's cock was soft between them and he was overdue to pull out. He reached low to hold onto the condom as he moved away, and Sherlock passed him a tissue to wrap it in. He heard it rustle as it hit the bin. John's hips stayed nestled against his, his curly hair tickling the tender skin of Sherlock's backside, his belly against Sherlock's belly. Sherlock kissed his shoulder, his neck, and his mouth, tasting the difference.
"Jim Moriarty," the reviewer said with a smile, taking John's outstretched hand in a chilly grip. "Hi."
"Oh my God," Harry said. "You
John snorted. "Sherlock, she's not qualified."
them, John, especially if they come with the express purpose of shouting at
"No," Sherlock said, glaring at his phone. "It's going to be finished by Monday evening." He was texting furiously, his fingers practically bouncing off the touchscreen. He stopped and waited for a response. John watched, silent. He was glad he had insisted on contractors for the renovation, rather than let Sherlock do whatever he wanted to the building, but he wasn't going to gloat over that now. He scratched his thigh and waited. Sherlock dropped his phone onto his chest in disgust and rubbed a palm down the line of buttons on his shirt, across his abdomen. John tried not to see the flash of skin between his buttons. "God, I'm starving," Sherlock said.
"It was perfect," I say, and tighten my arms around him so that he can't pull away. "John."
"As—"
"I'm in the mood for Thai, if you're amenable."
I turned on him. The poor chap. He’d make a decent officer some day, but just then I needed him terrified.
"At least let me pay for the services you have provided me," I said, fishing in my pockets. He sighed and huffed, but when I produced a guinea he did not turn it down. "You are quite invaluable," I said. "Your usefulness to me cannot be overstated."
"I can't remember… that night."
He hadn’t seen that yet; with his back to me he really could only see my face. I bit my lip, hoping it might give him a hint, but he was focused on his razor once more. He shaved his cheek, the corner of his jaw, and I watched him carefully measure the length of his sideburns with the flat of the blade. Then he wiped the traces of shaving lather off his face with the towel, feeling for rough places. He found two, reapplied the soap, and scraped them down to the skin. The wet cloth followed, and then he bent close to the mirror to trim the bristle of his moustache with a pair of short scissors.
Sherlock threw himself onto the sofa and stretched out from end to end, resting his fingertips against one another beneath his chin. John hung his coat on the back of the chair at the writing table between the windows and sat down, rubbing absently at his shoulder.
"I'm afraid I misled you," I said, swallowing my ego. "When I suggested we marry."
"They loved the mousse," she said.
I couldn't quite fathom it. The description of the night I'd lost made it sound like it
He had me strip, and meanwhile went out to lock the sitting room door. It was nearly nine in the morning, and here we were getting undressed again. I straightened the blankets on the bed and reclined atop them. The quilt could get soap on it and be changed more easily than the sheets. Watson returned, closed the bedroom door, and brought the wash basin, mug, towel, and razor over to the bed.
I smile. I know more than enough tricks to remind to whom he belongs. I work his prick out of his drawers and weigh it in my hand. He sighs, his thumb against my forehead. He rubs it across my eyebrow, which I arch in acknowledgment— or perhaps in protest— and tightens his fingers in my hair. The oil in my hair is no match for my lover’s grip. I will look debauched, obscene. Anyone could see.
I slid my knee over his, bringing our hips closer together. "You're right that you'll be the first, but I've come to terms with the idea. Just…" I let my voice grow breathy, "be gentle with me."
"I'm fine," he said, waving away my concern with a flick of his wrist.
"So what the hell is he doing with you, then?" she asked, grinning.

"We won't need a reservation," I said, sitting back in the seat, "and we might as well eat after all that nonsense."
"Is this the part where I make you breakfast?" Sherlock asked, pouring. He sounded casual, almost flippant, but John caught a flash of uncertainty on his face as he put the cap back on.
, I read, my heart sinking.
He fit right into the whirl of the kitchen, here between Sherlock and Toni, the line cooks around them, with Molly on the other side of the room and Lestrade moving in and out of the dining room in John's stead. He moved a little more slowly than the others did, but they only hassled him enough to keep him going. His arm did start to ache after the first hour, his left little finger going numb, but Sherlock noticed at once and set him to refilling the piping bags and cracking the glass crisps into shards. As soon as his hand felt normal again, Sherlock had him back on the line, plating meals and adding garnishes right before the plates went out the door.
I wish we were home, so that I
When first I had met Sherlock Holmes, I had been wounded, ill, and alone. My family had nothing to offer, and my friends had left London for better, or worse, situations. I had hoped to find a situation or join a practice by the time I ran into Stamford, but it was more difficult than I expected, and my health was not strong enough to sustain a full-time position. I was despairing, and Sherlock Holmes looked upon me with such kindness, and read my history and my suffering without pity, that it was impossible not to like him at once. He fascinated me, and becoming his friend had been both a pleasure and an honor.
"Stop right there," John snapped. "When you're done having a snit, you're going to really like her. She wants to make ice spheres and she knows how to do that thing with Xantham gum that suspends bits of nonsense in a cocktail glass, so you can take your assumptions and you can shove them right up your arse. I'm not hiring on a whim, here, Sherlock. I'm trying to start a business. That's what you brought me on for. If you aren't going to let me do it the way I please, you can bloody well do it yourself."
I took it and drank deeply. It was good wine. I was certain we weren't appreciating it to its fullest. Watson took it back and put his mouth where mine had been, and I felt my body flush hot and then cold.
"Quite so," Watson agreed.
"Well, then? You're the expert, Sherlock."
"Most of it."
The narrator and the older man finished quickly, their orgasms improbably simultaneous and almost alarmingly copious, but I was disappointed rather than perturbed. I wished the scenes would last a little longer so that I could catch up. I reread the lines about the alcove-fucking again, up to and including the climaxes, and my cock surged.
"Thought you'd take to someone like that," John said, crossing him off the list all the same.
"Holmes," I said.
I frown up at its facsimile of a face. "What journals?"
"It's the most logical solution."
" Sherlock huffed. "When you're quite done having your
It was from Watson; he had run into an old friend from medical school and they had decided to stop and have a drink together. He suggested we meet for dinner later, and told me where he would be. Mrs Hudson hadn’t left the room yet by the time I’d read it, so I told her not to expect us to eat that evening.
Bless him. That was the only thing he ever truly worried about. "Yes, I had breakfast."
Sherlock looked at him. "You think we should get it."
"If you please," Holmes said to the constable, when he was done with that unfruitful interrogation, "bring Mr Ellis in before Mr Simpson is returned, so that they do not have a change to talk to one another." He took off his jacket and handed it to me.
Three days later, Sherlock was on the verge of regretting his convictions. They had started to rearrange the kitchen equipment, and John absolutely refused to let him have his rotary evaporator, freeze dryer, and dehydrator in the middle of the kitchen where they belonged.
It was not exactly fine. The prep took too long for Sherlock's taste, even though the cooks were working with techniques some of them had never tried before. There wasn't time to teach and test, John thought, staying out of the way at the back of the kitchen with his clipboard in hand.
"Deeper," he moans, entirely defeating the purpose of the pillows. As I predicted, he cannot keep this particular promise. I oblige him anyway, pressing my finger in as deep as it will go, and his whole body shakes. "Oh, there!"
John fought a smile. "You do realise how much you sound like a boy buying sweets on an allowance, don't you?"
“Look at you the way he was,” I grit out. “No one should.”
He went back to the worktop to pick the mint leaves to bits, and then started to chop the peppers. His grip on the knife was weaker than before, and it slipped once as he worked, shearing close to his fingertips. John swore under his breath. He put the knife down and squeezed his fist hard, then shook it out. The tremor was back.
The inn around us was noisy, and we didn't hear the innkeeper come back until he was right beside us again with a new bottle of Chateau Lafite. Normally I wouldn't indulge, but the Duncans had paid for our lodging and our supper and I was feeling particularly proud of our success.
"Ah, well, you always did like everything else."
There were pamphlets and photographs on the tables, books of all sorts, albums of lewd drawings, and folders full of loose pages. I moved slowly along behind my quarry, thumbing my way through stacks of books with suggestive titles like
Jennings returned, and we separated. The vicar had two young women in tow, obviously roused quickly from whatever their evening occupation was, and they both looked confused. That was understandable.
John couldn't pretend he wasn't on the stairs any longer. He stepped into the flat's kitchen doorway and surveyed the scene in front of him.
“Right,” I said. “Let this man out this instant, or I’ll be having words with the Superintendent.”
"The starch comes shooting out the ruptures," Sherlock said, "but the inside stays creamy."
He woke again with the daylight around the edges of the curtains, and Sherlock on his back beside him, stretched out like a starfish. The heat had come on, so John's trip to the toilet wasn't miserable. He felt silly being naked, even on so short a journey, and pulled his briefs on. Afterwards, he washed his hands, peered at himself in the mirror, and helped himself to one of Sherlock's dressing gowns.
Mycroft pursed his mouth in displeasure. “It might interest you to know exactly where the money Sherlock is spending is coming from,” he said, “but I’ll leave that to you two to discuss. I’d hate to see your funds dry up all of a sudden.”
?" he asked, ignorant of my private thoughts.
," Sherlock groused, and tucked the pen away again. "You never let me do what I want."
My head hurt too much to really celebrate my own achievement, so I turned over again onto my stomach and went back to sleep.
“John—“
He'd be begging for a second finger now, and in a way he is: humming and moaning into the pillow he has stuffed between his teeth and rocking his hips back onto my hand. I pull my finger out to introduce its neighbor and he shudders from head to toe.
"No, of course not!" I said.
"I do mean it," I protested, grasping both his hands in mine. Despite the chill in the air, they were warm. He squeezed back.
All the while, I fondled myself through my nightshirt, growing more and more intent on my seduction. He hadn’t the slightest idea what he was in for the moment he turned around. My heartbeat thumped in my throat and between my legs. I let my head fall flat back onto the pillow, losing a little of my view for the added benefit of fingers on my left nipple.
“Fine,” I gasped, unbuttoning my fly again and exposing my prick. I took it in hand and groaned as a fresh gush of clear fluid spilled over my fingers. Watson watched as I began to stroke myself, and then reached for the book.
were right."
John called the five chefs on his way to the Lamb and Flag, and each of them agreed to be at 221 at half eight the next morning. He didn't actually know if Sherlock had anything planned for them yet, but if Sherlock was going to spring things on John like that he'd better be prepared to follow through.
"Five or six," John said.
John came back in, clipboard in hand. He'd taken their order himself, negating the need for their actual waiter, which was a ridiculous concession. Sherlock would have to remind him of the
"Holmes," said I.
Moriarty was waiting in the kitchen, leaning against the prep table in the middle of the room with his arms crossed and his eyes fixed on the office door. Lestrade and Sebastian were nowhere to be seen, but John could hear Lestrade's voice out in the dining room, offering to arrange something for a photograph. The cooks had also disappeared, perhaps sensing that something was wrong and deciding wisely to get out of the way.
"I'm not just leaving them to it," Sherlock said. "That's not an option."
“Er,” I said, arching my hips into my hand.
"I'll call you tonight," he said. "When you're sober."
"I just said
"Ye-es," John said. "There was coffee, and you just said there was a lot to do today. Twenty minutes ago, that was you, wasn't it?"
watch one another's tables, especially with an intention such as ours. They'll want to know what's coming next."
"In the grand scheme of your friendship, it was not very long ago," Mycroft said. "He may still find that the reminder of it pains him, and unfortunately you are the reminder of it."
"How does that feel?" he asked. His fingertips were gentle upon my bare skin; I shivered hard. He stroked his thumbs up to the base of my cock and away again, and I felt my prick jump in anticipation. When he circled his forefinger and thumb around the girth of it, his palm against my pubis, the deep breath I'd taken shuddered out of me.
kitchen," Sherlock said firmly. He took his hand off John's knee, leaving a weird cool spot in his wake, and got up. He stood in front of John, nearly toe-to-toe with him, and offered John both of his hands. "Get up. We'll clean up the risotto and send everyone home."
is boring," Sherlock said, half-sitting up, and for a moment John was worried he really was going to leave. "And your cooking might sound boring, but you, John Watson, are not." He gripped John's socked foot with his opposite hand and squeezed. "You stimulate the imagination. You conduct light."
"Rather," Sherlock said. He fiddled with his shirt cuffs, rubbed the back of his neck, and then put his hands on his hips. "Our professional relationship is far more important than any kind of entanglement," he said firmly. "The restaurant comes first."
When I wake again, dawn has broken and spilled its grey light in at the window. I am lying on my side, facing the wall. Watson's hard body cradles mine, his arm across my ribs and his hand on my belly. He is warm and aware; as soon as I stir, he kisses my neck. The precision of the kiss is the last element that causes my belief in him to slot into place. No one but Watson would know what a kiss, given with such gentle pressure to so particular a spot, could do to me. Pleasure ripples down my spine, and I clench my hand in the sheet.
Mrs Hudson came out to see what the fuss was. Holmes let my hand slip from his elbow but caught my fingers in his.
"John! You can walk through any space in this whole—"
"Remind me to ring Paul in the morning."
"I'm glad you went to him," Watson said, "and not just… one of your secret hideaways."
"Where do we get one?" Watson demanded. "We'll go knock them up right now and have one drawn up."
"Dangerously," I admitted, feeling the tug of orgasm starting deep in my bollocks and being egged on every time his prick rubbed at my prostate. I could hold it off a little longer if I didn't focus on it, but the wave was approaching.
," John said.
"John," Sherlock said, his voice lower than John had expected. "I've been waiting for you for ten minutes."
Holmes laughed softly and wrapped his leg around mine. He wasn’t hard beneath his nightshirt yet, but the intention was unmistakable. He kissed me again, deeply and slowly, and whispered, "I’m sorry to have made you wait."
you've warned me, but you're not the one
you, I just want– Your company is quite agreeable to me. I find you are quite essential to my work."
Sherlock sat up, swinging his legs over the edge of the sofa and planting his feet on the floor. "You will," he said. He propped his elbows on his knees and regarded John with those piercing eyes, as if he were parsing and analysing each one of John's thoughts as John had them. "Yesterday I asked you whether you'd been taken to Portland Street or UCL after the fire."
"And I you," I replied, pulling back to look at him. We gazed at one another in the dark, smiling, and then Holmes worked his hand between us to touch the head of my prick.
He smirked and offered me the magnifier back. I took it, almost dropped it again, and put it away in my jacket pocket.
I wanted to kiss him even more now, damn him. I swallowed hard.
"I have made it," John said.
"They didn't see me, did they?"
I closed my eyes against that realization, but of course once it had risen to the surface of my consciousness it couldn't be ignored. I wanted him to never leave me, as he had done once already, and as Mary had done. Losing Mary proved even marriage couldn't stop someone from death, but people had treated me differently after her passing than they had after Holmes's. They had spoken more softly about her, seen my widower's weeds and given me gentle looks. I hadn't been able to mourn Holmes the same way, despite our much longer association. It was as if marrying him now could bring some of that back, gain me a little more respect as a man twice widowed and once revived.
A moment of contemplative silence, and then Sherlock said, "All right."
Sherlock got up and waved John into the apartment kitchen, which now looked even less like the kitchen downstairs and more like the lab Sherlock wanted to build. There were beakers and pipettes and flasks everywhere, and a microscope was sitting in the middle of the table. Sherlock pushed the mess aside and put a cutting board down in its place. He opened the fridge and rummaged around, coming up with a surprising array of fresh vegetables, considering how often Mrs Hudson scolded him about the sorry state of his pantry: onions, carrots, celery, peppers, garlic. Six tomatoes from a bowl on the sideboard joined the pile on the table, and Sherlock handed John a knife.
Watson tsked and shook his head. “Such a shame, what some people will do for money.”
"Now, look here," Watson said, immediately defensive, "my wife and I were really very–"
"Are you cooking at all with this new project, or…?"
“You,” he says, grinding his hips hard against mine, pinning me with the weight of his body, “are utterly mad.”
"Er," said Watson, "thank you. Was it, indeed?"
"Sherlock," John said seriously, "do you want to… stay here…? Or… go to bed?"
There was Vaseline in the night table drawer, deep finger troughs in it already. Holmes fumbled the jar open, scooped out a generous amount, and moved down the bed, taking the quilts with him on his narrow shoulders. I didn't care. He nudged my thighs apart and smeared some of the jelly between my buttocks, at the same time taking my prick in his other hand.
"I thought you were going to call me 'Sherlock' at home."
"John, put on a coat," Sherlock said. "We'll stand by the emulsifier with the pot rack behind us."
"As I said, it's rare that anyone interests me enough to stoke an amorous desire."
He took a breath. “No, it’s all right.”
"Well, you think that, but it doesn't make
My orgasm took me abruptly, surging upwards from low in my gut, and I spurted over my fingers with a stifled grunt. I drew it out, squeezing my cock from root to tip, and lamented the splash of semen on my shirt tails even as I trembled with the echoes of my pleasure. Damn.
"Oh, I see, it's all right if it's some stranger in a video on the internet, but if it's your
Sherlock showed him the spherification technique, which was even better than the liquid noodle thing, and John tasted beads of olive oil, soy sauce, milk, and wine; all the liquids Sherlock could find in the kitchen. Then Sherlock helped him make chocolate sauce ravioli, and John's exclamation of amazement when they cut them open on a plate made him chuckle.
"He'll write us a nasty review and we won't get a soul in here after opening night," Sherlock said, pressing his palms flat to the prep table.
“You do not disturb me,” he said finally, turning his head and pressing his cheek against mine. I nuzzled his cheek, kissed it, and then kissed his mouth. He opened sweetly to the gentle pressure of my tongue, but the angle wouldn’t allow me to kiss him as deeply as I wanted. Shame. I gave him one more little peck and then returned my attention to his jaw, his throat, and then the nape of his neck. I bit him again to feel him shiver.
John was naked by the time he got back, and he'd moved from the edge of the bed to the middle, his head on Sherlock's pillows. His cock stood up, hard and thick. Sherlock's mouth watered hard; the sense-memory of that cock in his throat sent the rest of the blood in his body rushing south. He was light-headed as he kicked off his own briefs and climbed into bed with John. John welcomed him back with a kiss, pulling Sherlock's legs so that he was straddling John again, but higher up, knees on either side of John's ribs. It meant Sherlock had to curl his spine down to kiss John, but it also meant that John could easily reach when he slipped wet fingers between Sherlock's cheeks.
I pulled off. “If you push my head down even once–”
The machine turns back to look at me. “It’s all of the information the human race has compiled.”
To think that I would ever be uninterested in learning anything. I was not made for this century.
John blinked in surprise.  Sherlock was smirking at him, practically teasing him, and it wasn't subtle.
It startled a laugh out of John, who curled his arm around Sherlock's shoulders and pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Ah, go on," he sighed, and Sherlock grinned against his neck, slipping his fingertips beneath the waist of John's pants.
His lips twitch in a very human show of amusement. "You haven't bedded a machine yet." God, he's flirting with me.
finished, and the decor will be simple. You're right about the aubergine being too dark; I think a light blue will suit very nicely."
He lifted his mouth away to watch his first finger disappear into my body. He swallowed hard, his eyes dark and intent. That finger moved in and out of me slowly, warming up the second sphincter, and I let the heat and pleasure ripple up my spine. I slid my heels farther apart. His mouth found the inside of my knee, where he kissed and then nibbled me gently. Then he bent over me again, braced with one hand on the bed at my hip, and took my prick into his mouth once more. His searching finger sank deep, touching that spot inside me that made me groan aloud.
“I beg your pardon?”
Greg raised an eyebrow at John, who shrugged. They were all a bit drunk.
"We're ready for you, gentlemen," Jennings said, from the altar. "If you'd like to proceed."
He didn't. He wiped me clean and draped the hot towel over me again while he rummaged in his supplies. I wanted to rut against the towel, I was so hard. Desire had flooded my body, radiating from my parted thighs out to my fingers and toes. My nipples were peaked and tender.
He didn’t, but the narrator and an unnamed school friend fell in with one another, and there was a scene of them kissing and reminiscing about their days in the dorms together. They began to fuck Oxford style, with the narrator’s cock pushed between his friend’s thighs, and my arousal spiked again. I pushed my hand into my drawers to tug at my bollocks, leaving my cock standing untouched. It twitched, heavy and stiff and aching to be stroked. The narrator reached around his friend and began to fondle his prick, telling him how much he liked the feeling of in in his hand, and I found myself biting my lip to keep from making a sound.
"Harry's gay, and has a lot of gay friends. Wait, did you look her up while I was gone? How do you know what she looks like?"
He chuckled and nibbled my ear. "I shouldn’t have to remind you of my capacity to think of two things at once." He worked his fist around the head of my prick, ratcheting my pleasure up.
Good Lord. I scrambled out of bed, found a dressing gown, willed my body into decency, and yanked open the door. “What’s wrong?” I demanded.
"I agree."
"John," Sherlock said, turning to face him, leaning with one hip against the table, "you have to forget about trying to get her approval. She's never going to be happy that you're successful without her. That's just who she is."
John put it on after his shower. It fit perfectly.
"Imagine the trouble we can get in now," said Holmes smiling.
went on he became more subdued. His mouth and the corners of his eyes got tight, and he corrected mistakes with brusque efficiency. He wasn’t happy.
I blinked back unexpected tears.
"Ah, he's not so bad. He just has to be in charge, that's all, and he doesn't suffer a fool."
"It would be a very shocking mistake indeed," he said.
He might be an arsehole, but it looked like he
He glanced at me. "Sorry, since when?"
"But if something were to happen to me! And the money you've made directly off your clients; you don't work alone, you know."
"No, it's lovely, and I'm mad for your touch, but it'll be easier if you let me— and then you can—"
Mary didn't look impressed. "Is that all?"
I stand on the bank, soaking wet, shouting myself hoarse. My coat is heavy on my shoulders. I’ve lost it. I’ve lost my link. I’ve lost him for good now.
you."
"I don't think you telling me that while you're sitting in my lap is exactly fair," John said, and his hands came to rest on Sherlock's hips.
"I see," I said softly, taking the trousers and putting them on the settee. He let me unbutton his linen shirt and ease it off his arms. The bruising on his ribs caught my attention first: he'd been kicked at least once in the fight. He shied away from my fingers. I turned my attention to the gnarled pink scar that made up the front of his left shoulder. It was magnificent, and horrible, and I kept my face neutral as I looked, for he was watching me. "It does look inconvenient," I said finally, glancing back up to meet his eyes. "I shall certainly help."
I must have fallen asleep there on the grave of my dead lover. The next thing I am aware of is being nudged gently by a toe in the sole of my boot. A woman in a clerical frock stands over me, and she frowns when I open my eyes.
“Good,” Sherlock said, turning around suddenly, “because we’re going for one.” He looked John up and down. “You’ll have to do for now, but you really should start keeping some clothes here.”
Let me say now that the sexual appetites of women have never been very interesting to me, but I could appreciate the enthusiasm.
Sherlock sighed deeply, aggrieved. "Good lord, of course they're invited. Tell Mummy—"
"What did she want?" Sherlock asked finally.
Sherlock obliged, getting in behind him, and once the shower curtain was safely closed, Sherlock gathered John in his arms to kiss him again. He turned so that John was shielded from the spray, taking the brunt of it on his shoulders, and John muttered, "Oi!" into his mouth. He felt Sherlock grin.
After supper on the last day of the year, Sherlock Holmes and I left our cozy sanctuary of Baker Street and the crackling fireplace for a long ramble through Regent's park, arm in arm. I relished the warmth of his body next to mine as we reminisced about the past year, and clasped his hand in mine around my elbow. We had worked on a great number of cases that year, and thinking back on our successes and the people we had helped brought a warm glow to my heart even as the winter air chilled my nose and my toes in my boots.
I’m blushing now, embarrassed at my jealousy. He finishes doing up his own buttons again, tucks in his shirt and fixes his braces. I help with his waistcoat, silent, cheeks flaming. We are neither of us respectable anymore, but the quick application of our coats and hats will save us from being ejected from the club indefinitely.
"You were saying earlier that married people always know where the other one is."
"Really? I thought you'd like a smoky taste."
John risked a glance at Sherlock, who was beaming around at the dark interior. "Yes, well," he said, "nothing's settled yet."
John had never been called a coward before, not even by his sister. And yet, Sherlock had made it sound nothing but affectionate. John was
"Hmm," Sherlock said.
"Well, maybe, but the space is ideal," John said. "The building is deeper than it looks from the front, and we've got plenty of space for a really state-of-the-art kitchen."
His reply was a muffled grunt.
"He won't work with me," Sherlock said, going down the list. "She's an idiot, this one's not a real chef, and that one's a stalker. I've seen their name on a few forums, raving about you."
felt different. Holmes looked at me differently: although I couldn't identify what was different about it. He looked fond, and sly, and sometimes a little disappointed. Perhaps he always looked at me like that.
I had to clear my throat twice. My cock felt heavy in my drawers and my heart was pounding. "Yes," I said, "Dr Watson was just reminding me of a-another case, with certain similarities to this one, during which I made a-an error of judgement." I dropped my voice to a whisper. "
That was the last thing I remembered: sitting with Holmes out-of-doors, the noisy inn behind me, watching him drink wine straight from the bottle.
He had kissed me. Tonight. He had kissed me on purpose, in the street, in celebration. His emotions had been running high, the excitement of the chase had set him off, but he had done it quite intentionally. And, most importantly, I had liked it. I had liked it very much; so much, in fact, that thinking on that kiss made my blood pound in my ears. Thinking of the press of his body in the doorway, and the weight of him on my lap in the cab, made the blood pound between my legs.
He's still shaking when I pull away, wiping my mouth on the back of my hand and easing my fingers out of his arse. He pushes himself up to his knees, sitting back on my chest. His prick is still hard; it bobs between us. He rubs both hands over his face, down his body, and transfers his touch to my chest and neck.
"Of course they're men's rings. Give me that." I took the one he'd picked up and put it on my own hand.
"I don't mind people knowing; I get the impression everyone's been waiting on us to do something like this, and your reputation protects you from too much scrutiny."
Watson finished the scene and closed the book. I heard him put it down on the table and then the rustle of the pillows as he shifted on the settee. When I opened my eyes, he was smiling at me.
"Good evening," he said, "how are you enjoying your meal?"
I couldn't help smiling. "Why?'
. I had to stop you before– before I led you astray."
John shook his head in confusion.
Mary responded almost at once:
He trembles with laughter, and waggles his hips. I screw my finger inside him, changing the muffled chortling to a gasp of pleasure. I do it again, for that would be the next thing he'd demand. He is gratifyingly sensitive, inside and out, and I can read the twitches of his body as easily as he reads a woman's marital situation. It's not a skill I consider publishing, though I admit to owning a few of that sort of book.
His fingers are rubbing against the band of my drawers. I swallow hard and slide one leg up, planting my heel on the bed and spreading my thighs apart in invitation. My cock feels heavy and thick, long neglected. I start to laugh at the thought that it has been two centuries since the last time I had an orgasm.
"Harry's coming," John said. "She texted me to say so. And Mary Morstan."
John led him into the office and closed the door, and then kissed him soundly. He pressed himself full-length against Sherlock, and Sherlock sank back against the door to receive him. His tongue was warm and insistent and Sherlock melted into it, sliding his hands up John's back and returning the kiss.
"John
“I need a distraction,” he said into the top of my head. I wrapped my arms around him, my hands underneath his shoulder blades, and pressed my cheek to his chest. His heart was beating steadily, his ribs rising and falling as he breathed. Having confirmed his humanity, I picked my head up again and looked into his eyes. They were red with fatigue.
"Sherlock," John warned.
"I said I can't remember the night we got–"
Sherlock pulled back, breathing hard, and glanced up at John. It wasn't a coy glance; he wasn't checking to see if John was watching. In fact, when John met his eyes, Sherlock flushed more deeply and busied himself with the task of sucking John's brain out through his dick. His lips parted and he engulfed John. John gasped at the incredible hot, wet sensation of Sherlock's mouth sinking down around him, and his hips jerked against his own volition. Sherlock didn't flinch, just took the extra inch of John's prick with grace, and John fell back, panting, "Sorry, sorry," even though he could tell Sherlock didn't mind.
"Oh, I'm sure you were, dear," our housekeeper replied kindly. "Have you figured it all out now?"
"Because we need to talk about your inappropriate and totally unnecessary jealous streak," John said, taking off his coat and hanging it up behind the sitting room door.
“My– what?”
He sat back abruptly. "What?"
Holmes laughed and kissed me again. “Come on,” said he, “up you get, then. No more laying about.”
I wished I could remember the night before better. If I wracked my brain, I could come up with disjointed images: being at the church, hand-in-hand; being at the inn, celebrating; being arm-in-arm somewhere outside, laughing; hauling a very drunk London detective up the stairs to our double-bedded room.
"Can I see you in the office for a moment, please, Sherlock?"
kitchen." Sherlock's hands slid up underneath his T-shirt, pushing it up his torso until it was stopped by John's arms which were still wrapped around Sherlock's body.
"A little over a month," John said, glancing at Sherlock. Sherlock didn't return the look: he was glaring at the reviewer, and the malice in his eyes said
“Please,” he whispers.
"Watson, kindly do not insult me so soon after I've sprung you out of gaol."
There was a knock on the door that made John just about jump out of his skin. A moment later, Sherlock was silhouetted in the opening crack.
“Hmm?”
John smiled. "So you landed on your feet, then," he said. "That's good."
Sherlock shivered, his head falling back to give John room; he slid his hands up John's arms, under the sleeves of his shirt, but just as he reached John's shoulders John flinched away, jerking his left arm out of Sherlock's grip. He didn't pull away altogether; instead he hid his face against Sherlock's collarbone and breathed out hard.
Sherlock stuck his head into the office. "John, I need you."
Sherlock breathed in sharply through his nose and went rigid, standing up straight and stiff. John glanced at him. Nerves? His face was like stone and he looked about three inches taller. Had to be nerves. The last time Sherlock had been named in a food review, it had been mixed chastisement and praise. This first interview for the new restaurant meant a lot to him.
"Thank you," he managed.
"Mr D'Arcy," said I, reaching up to shake his hand. "How are you, my good fellow?"
"I was in that kitchen longer," Sherlock protested, and let go of John to bend his head back under the water. John was captivated, once again, by the impossible length of his throat, the smooth expanse of his collarbones and chest. Sherlock's forearms were scarred with little burn marks and cuts, the toll exacted by time spent around hot oil and sharp knives, but his upper body was so flawless it made John's jaw clench with want. He applied his tongue to the water running down over Sherlock's shoulder and Sherlock murmured in warm appreciation.
parents.
"You might want to put on pants, too."
A little desperate noise slipped out between my teeth, and I opened my eyes to look down at myself: my hand circling my prick, the red tip poking out above my fingers, gleaming in the light from the fire. I began to frig myself slowly, my hips rocking on the settee to push through my fist. My nipples were hard beneath my shirt, and pinching them made my cock twitch in my grip. I was leaking, so aroused my fingers were slick, and my fist moved faster and faster as I squirmed and rocked.
"Hm," he says, settling in to sleep. He yawns and hugs me tighter. "No, I probably won't."
"It would save us both a lot of time. I wouldn't be forced to make decisions without you when you're running late."
The water was starting to cool when he finally turned it off and got out. It was past midnight. He dried off and slipped into the bedroom. John stirred as he found his pajamas and dressed, and lifted the corner of the duvet for him. Sherlock couldn't hear the traffic noise from Baker Street; instead, John was breathing quietly beside him, his head propped up on his folded elbow. Sherlock turned to face him. He could see John's eyes gleaming in the dark, open but unfocused.
"Save that for the summer," he said. They were in the flat; John had been moving details on their logo design around by millimetres for what felt like hours. Sherlock shoving the notebook in his face had been a blessed relief.
"Thank you for taking the time," I agreed. I wondered if they could tell how drunk we were. Watson was hiding it well, although he wasn't very steady on his feet.
"The bloody noodles," John said, grinning.
"Do you have anything to… ease the way?" I whisper.
"The jar is in your bag."
"All right," John said. "We'll come back to that one when the summer's over and we haven't made complete fools of ourselves."
"Is this another toy you want to buy?"
"I know," Watson said. He accepted the bottle again. It was almost half gone.
"Your scribbling has led to my reputation, and you know it," I said. "All that work you did while–" I stopped, unwilling to remind him of Switzerland again so soon. "Anyway, it's not just me that people expect to see. Remember that butler who collapsed on the hearth rug? 'Dr Watson, you have to help me?'"
"Hm," Sherlock said. "Stay here for tonight, then. You're the one who said I should get more sleep."
John laughed, squeezing Sherlock's thighs with both hands. "Christ, I'm glad there's no one downstairs to hear you," he said.
"Hm."
"Find us a condom and I will," John said. Sherlock was off his lap in an instant, rummaging in the dresser. There had to be some
"I started bringing in some of my equipment—"
I waited until Watson had overpowered Williams entirely, and then said, “My dear fellow, you have quite a gift, don’t you.”
I bit down on the knuckle of my first finger as I pulled at my cock, his low, steady voice washing over me. He read slowly and deliberately, glancing at my face and my working hand for feedback. I closed my eyes, picturing the boys vividly as they stroked one another. I circled the head of my prick with my fingers and rubbed it fast and hard as the narrator and his friend worked themselves up to the peak. Watson’s hand found my thigh, and then slipped between my legs to squeeze my bollocks. Surprised pleasure arced through me and I cried out as I spurted, my thighs flexing, my shirt ruined.
"No, something's definitely burning. Where's Sherlock?" Sherlock was at the flat, doing an experiment, refining a process. They were supposed to take photos of the food for the website tomorrow. He'd wanted to start getting it ready the night before. "I have to warn Sherlock."
and subsequent hiring, with the set-up of the dining room. They wouldn't have to put off hiring the waiters, especially if they were going to go with Agency staff, but everything that got pushed back would skew their timetable more and more. John's stomach sank low.
