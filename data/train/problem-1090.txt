“Of course,” John said, leading him over to one of the occupied tables and pulling back the white sheet a fraction.
After about twenty-five minutes had passed, there was a loud creak of a side door somewhere in the gallery followed by the sound of quickly-approaching footsteps. A small, short man walked into their view and sauntered up to the painting, looking as confident as can be. Sherlock smirked.
There was a light knock at the door and John turned to find a middle-aged man dressed to the nines in a deep grey suit and blush pink tie.
Sherlock immediately snuggles up to John’s side, wrapping one long arm around John’s waist and holding him close, one of his legs tucked securely between John’s thighs. John lets his hands wander across Sherlock’s back and shoulders, moving up to tangle in his hair and then back again in a rhythmical cycle. Sherlock nuzzles closer until his face is buried in John’s neck, his nose brushing back and forth against the skin there. John tips his head and presses a kiss to the crown of Sherlock’s head, causing him to hum and shift closer still, until the entire length of his body is pressed against John: all hot, soft flesh and glorious angles.
“No,” Sherlock insists, his voice rumbling in the crook of John’s neck. “Wouldn’t have it any other way,
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. He set his empty mug down beside his chair and shuffled towards the fireplace. Within minutes a fire was roaring, sending wonderful ripples of heat shivering through the air.
when their eyes met. After that, Sherlock’s eyes remained glued to the information the pages contained until he found what he was looking for.
It seemed John also returned said aforementioned feelings of camaraderie. Intriguingly, from what little he could remember about their adventures together, when Sherlock said to jump, John simply asked
John rolled his eyes, but stepped towards Sherlock, tentatively taking his outstretched hand. Sherlock guided John’s other hand to rest just above his waist, then found John’s shoulder with his own hand.
“Oh, come on,” Lestrade said. “We would.” He gave Anderson a swift and not-so-subtle elbow to the ribs.
“This.” Sherlock held out a piece of paper. John took it, squinting in an attempt to read the too-tiny print.
“Hmm,” Sherlock offered noncommittally, not looking up from the spot on the floor he had been staring intently at for the past hour or so.
Sherlock only gave a sad shake of his head. He reached up and placed his hands over John’s, gently prying his coat free from their ironclad grip one finger at a time.
“Jesus Sherlock,” John said, running a hand down his face. “Come on.” He reached down, attempting rather unsuccessfully to drag Sherlock back onto the seat.
Like he was simply caught up in a euphoric dream, shapes and colours and sounds floating around him in elusive motions and causing his head to swim. Yes, John had moved back into Baker Street, bringing Rosie with him to share the upstairs bedroom. Sherlock was indeed grateful for the company they provided and on rare—okay, many—occasions, he had offered to care for Rosie while John was out.
The plane had one single passenger, staring forlornly out the pristinely polished window, not bothering to stop the tears from flowing freely now that he was alone. He was lost in the depths of his mind palace, the last encounter with his best friend stuck on repeat.
It appeared that was all the encouragement Sherlock needed to swoop down and capture John’s mouth with his own. The kiss was much less chaste this time around and John let out a rather embarrassing moan as Sherlock’s tongue conducted an exploratory search of his mouth.
It was a chilly winter evening. Mrs. Hudson had dropped off tea earlier at two twenty-one b for John and Sherlock and had made sure to tell them ‘you boys better bundle up tight tonight, it’s going to get cold out there,’ before heading off to bed herself.
The doctor led them to a small room near the back of the hospital. John lay on the singular bed inside, a white sheet covering him from head to toe. Sherlock strode forwards and yanked the sheet off of John’s upper half. His skin was so pale it was nearly grey and his chest was bare, save for the deep red stains his blood had left.
Sherlock groaned as he stirred, the sound vibrating through John’s stomach where Sherlock’s face was still pressed into him.
John’s fingers tightened around Sherlock’s and he knew, because of course he knew, exactly what Sherlock was thinking.
The door creaked open quietly, pulling him from his thoughts. A man crept through, clearly trying his best not to disturb him. Studying the man through squinted eyes, he figured by his gait and the clothes he wore he was most likely a doctor of some sort.
He didn’t remember much. His memory was rather fuzzy and he kept drifting in and out of consciousness. Judging by the bright lights racing past overhead as he was wheeled down the hallways, he could confidently deduce that he was at the hospital. It was bad then. Really bad, judging by the way his entire body was screaming in protest.
All the public places; trains, parks, stadiums. But no sign of the bomb anywhere. It wasn’t like Moriarty to bluff. There
Three days later, Sherlock solved the case and went back to writing his blog—even though no one ever actually read it—and searching for a new supposedly unsolvable case.
“This,” Anderson said, gesturing to a yellow tarp covering the body just a few meters away from where the men stood.
John and Carter were now edging dangerously close towards the embankment of the Thames—completely oblivious to their proximity to it—their focus resting solely on their brawl. Sherlock stumbled towards them, still clutching at his nose with one hand. It was possible he’d even got a concussion from the sheer force of the punch.
He steers John towards his bedroom before he is able to protest further and thankfully leaves him to change in privacy. Once he is dressed, he lets Sherlock back in.
Mycroft scoffed, his lips curling up into amusement as though he’d just been told a particularly funny joke.
John vaguely heard the lock of the room click open and footsteps approach, but Sherlock didn’t give him time to register much more than that. He hooked his legs around John’s ankles and pulled him down, unceremoniously smashing their lips together for the second time that day. John only spluttered for a brief moment and then he was kissing back just as exuberantly as Sherlock was and fuck it if this was all just an act. It was a pretty damn good one. Sherlock moaned into his mouth before pulling back slightly and rolling his hips once in a teasing sort of motion.
Apparently, sleeping curled up on top of your friend like a pretzel did not do wonders for one’s back.
“No, course not.” John dips his hands under the sheet and slides them up Sherlock’s back. “But Sherlock, if you wanted something, all you had to do was ask.”
The cab ride was awkward at best, with Sherlock staring resolutely out the window the whole duration of the ride. Somehow of their own accord, their hands managed to find their way to one another, silently tangling together on the seat between them. Neither man moved to pull their hand away—John figured that, at least, was a good sign.
Thankfully, Lestrade finished with them quite quickly and sent them on their way. Sherlock was gone in a flurry of Belstaff and already climbing into a cab when John caught up to him outside the hotel.
Moriarty tumbled backwards over the side of the bridge. He smiled serenely as he fell, never once breaking eye contact with Sherlock. When his body hit the water with a sickening clap, Sherlock keeled over and collapsed to the ground as a searing pain engulfed his body, feeling as though it was
The weekend couldn’t come fast enough for Sherlock. It was only a mere few days, but it might as well have been an eternity. At last, when the weekend finally rolled around, Sherlock ushered John out of the flat after leaving Rosie with Mrs. Hudson and hailed a cab.
Sherlock pinched John’s nose and leaned down. Sherlock hated it. He hated every moment. He hated the first time his lips touched John’s. He could almost taste the blood, the fear, the pain on John’s lips as he exhaled, filling his lungs with air.
John couldn’t stop his mouth from falling open. That seemed to be the effect Sherlock often had on him.
But his blood had gone cold, freezing him in place like a marble statue. He should have told him, but then Sherlock surely would’ve stayed. And of course that was what John wanted, but he trusted Sherlock. Trusted him with his life. He’d never trusted anyone more, not even the other members of his team in Afghanistan, and that was saying something. If Sherlock truly felt he needed to leave, then he probably did, as much as it pained John to think about.
He settled back into the chair with a sigh and continued reading. The reading seemed to be the only thing that would even remotely calm his sporadic heart rate.
When John is satisfied with how thoroughly kissed Sherlock looks, he begins to make his way down his neck to his chest, then belly, and then lower yet. Sherlock gasps and mumbles an unintelligible string of words which may be curses, praise, or declarations of love. To be honest, John would be quite fine with any of those. Sherlock finally stills and John halts his ministrations, glancing up briefly through his eyelashes to make sure the man is still alive. The sight he’s met with makes John’s breathing stutter and he pauses for a moment from the steady rhythm he’s created with his mouth and tongue: Sherlock is biting down on the back of his hand, his entire body trembling.
“Sherlock?” John called into the darkness, picking up his speed as he moved through the flat. He was immensely grateful he knew the place so well, so he was quite confident that he wouldn’t walk into anything in the dark. “Sherl– oh
Mycroft stepped forwards and placed a hand on Sherlock’s arm. There were tears in his eyes. Even Mycroft wasn’t that good of an actor.
John couldn’t help but grin back. “Never thought dancing would be something you’d know how to do,” he commented.
” The detective kicked a stack of boxes, his coat billowing out with the motion. The frozen cardboard of the boxes echoed throughout the freezer as they collided with one another, scattering in a multitude of directions.
A twig snaps to their right, and Sherlock’s arms tighten around John, effectively pulling him closer. Marcus stumbles into sight, his figure just barely visible in the dark. Moonlight glints off the large knife, giving it a deadly glow in the dark of the forest. It is quite clear from the way the man constantly stumbles and curses that the drugs are taking their toll, and it won’t be long now until the full effects have vanished and he can be easily subdued.
Sherlock stumbled backwards, just barely catching himself as momentum threw his body unrelentingly towards the ground.
Sherlock’s heart pounded in his chest, begging to be set free from the confines of the jail cell that was his rib cage. He found he was struggling to breathe—how unpleasant—and was stricken with the inexplicable feeling of his heart being torn to shreds, stomped on and thrown away, with the whole process in a constant cyclical repeat.
When John peeked into the sitting room from around the corner of the kitchen a few moments later, he was delighted to find Sherlock slurping down the soup, albeit with an amusing combination of a pout and frown worn on his face—how he managed to make such a face whilst eating and managing not to spill anything, John would never know.
It had only been a week—arguably the longest, worst week of his life—since he’d watched as his best friend flung himself from the rooftop of the hospital. John could still hear the resounding crack of Sherlock’s body hitting the cold pavement, his warm blood pooling into the concrete. It was a cruel image his mind couldn’t seem to shake.
It is Sherlock’s mouth, his lips against John’s. It is Sherlock’s breath that fills his lungs. It is Sherlock’s warm weight draped across his chest that calms him. It is Sherlock’s presence that comforts him.
John clenched his fist. He didn’t so much as flinch as his fingernails dug into the soft flesh of his palm, surely drawing blood.
Sherlock buried his face in his coat, unwilling to meet John’s gaze. His breath caught in his throat as everything came back to him in an unbidden rush, as though the floodgates in his mind had just opened.
“Sherlock? How did you get here?” John asked, walking up to him. “Wait. Let me guess: you knew he was staying here from the…dust particles on the clothes he was wearing? And the way he’d styled his hair with products from the hotel. Probably also from the pillow marks on his face specific only to the pillows used at this hotel.”
John finally releases Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock leans forwards, panting into the other man’s neck. His curls have never looked so debauched in his life, John thinks, and he
The cold that comes next is positively unbearable. Worse than anything John has ever experienced. His heart is twisted and shattered and Sherlock takes it with him as he pads his way downstairs.
When he turns back to Sherlock, he nearly dies. Sherlock has bent his knees up and let his legs fall open against the cool sheets, offering himself completely to John. John swallows and licks his lips before he crawls up Sherlock’s body, coating his fingers in the slick liquid as he goes. He nips at Sherlock’s lower lip before taking it into his mouth and sucking on it, dropping his hand between Sherlock’s open legs.
“What did he say?” Sherlock asked, thinking aloud. “’Lovely to make your acquaintance. I want you. Kill everyone you love.’”
John did not sleep well for the following three nights, although he convinced himself that that had absolutely nothing to do with the lack of consulting detective in close proximity. They hadn’t spoken a word about what had happened that night after the Thames, and John had decided that it definitely crossed well beyond the lines of friendship.
The second Martin McDonald—according to Sherlock’s deductions, the culprit in a particularly gruesome murder—advances towards Sherlock a few days after the couch incident, John intercepts him without a moments hesitation. He tackles him to the ground where Martin pulls a knife out, waving it wildly like a feral animal in John’s direction. John just barely manages to dodge the first and second lunge of the knife, the gleaming blade flashing in the bright moonlight.
“Going to be chilly tonight,” John said, glancing across the room to where Sherlock was precariously perched in his chair with one leg draped over the armrest.
“Sherlock,” John repeated, determined for his words to get through. He reached up to remove Sherlock’s hands, then decided better of it, dropping his hands back to his sides. “I don’t blame you, Sherlock.”
John startled awake, his throat tight and eyes bleary. He sucked in a breath, relishing in the comfort Sherlock’s scent brought him. Perhaps if he just stayed there, in Sherlock’s bed for the rest of his life, he’d somehow be able to survive this.
He turned to see John looking at him in horror as though he were a mere stranger, no better than the criminals they captured. Perhaps he wasn’t.
Sherlock’s face relaxed in an instant, a clear picture of relief noticeably washing over him as John slid back under the covers next to him—and if he was a bit closer to the detective, well, neither man cared to point it out.
He flails his arms around until one hand lands in something plush and soft. His lungs slowly fill with air as oxygen is pushed gently into his mouth. The air is glorious and warm and like no air John has ever breathed before. It makes him feel calm. It makes him feel whole.
Once the dressing gown has been appropriately discarded, John climbs back on top of Sherlock and the kissing resumes, this time along with the glorious slide of flesh against flesh, hands roaming through hair, across arms, bellies, chests, thighs.
“Sherlock?” Lestrade managed to say despite the shock of seeing a dead man standing in front of him.
“Did dance you want?” Sherlock asked eloquently. He cleared his throat and gave his head a slight shake, then tried again. “Did you want to continue? Dancing I mean? Get a bit more practice.”
John smiled to himself, though it was a hollow, sad thing, devoid of any emotion that resembled so much as a single modicum of happiness. His eyes were drawn to
He paused, realizing with a start that the door to his room was open—he hadn’t thought Mrs. Hudson would go in there at all, not even to clean. He usually wasn’t that wrong in his deductions. He crept forward slowly until he was standing in the doorway. His heart lurched, feeling quite unpleasant, as though someone was quite effectively trying to squeeze the life straight out of it.
“Yesss– Jawwwwn,” Sherlock slurred, stirring slightly in his sleep. “You’re brilliant,” he muttered before rolling over and falling silent once again.
John paced around the kitchen as he waited for the water to boil in an attempt to free his muscles from the stiffness they were currently being incapacitated by.
John tipped his head back to look up at the sky. The stars were rather beautiful tonight, shining much brighter than normal against the intensely luminous lights of London.
After what felt like hours, John finally saw the blinding swarm of police lights as the cab pulled up near the crime scene. He paid the driver with shaking hands, not bothering to wait for something as inconsequential as his change.
John chuckles and pulls Sherlock in for another kiss, this one much less innocent than the previous few they’ve just shared.
John carefully lowered himself a fraction, still keeping a fairly respectable distance between them.
John paused his reading to glance at him—sure enough, he was talking in his sleep again. He seemed to be doing that quite a bit and John found it rather interesting to hear what he had to say. It always seemed to be something to do with the story he was reading, as though Sherlock’s mind was inserting himself into the book.
“Right, just out of curiosity,” John said. “How did you determine all that? What did you see that told you all that?”
John clutched at his side as he regained his breath, and when his eyes met Sherlock’s this time, something different passed between them. Something entirely new. Something
Because of those three days, sixteen hours, fifty-one minutes and seventeen seconds, they never have to live another moment without knowing how utterly deep their love for one another truly is, always has been, and always will be.
John pulled Sherlock towards him and pressed him against his chest, wrapping both his coat and his arms around the detective and rubbing his hands up and down his back in an attempt to warm him from the friction. Sherlock ducked his head and pressed his face into the crook of John’s neck, snuffling pitifully as he did so.
When John caught up to him, a pang of dread spread throughout his body, settling unpleasantly heavy in his stomach. Sherlock had his palms against the now shut door of the freezer, his forehead pressed up against the cool metal.
John pulled his coat tighter around his body, willing the warmth to stay shut away. Sherlock flipped up his coat collar, the tip of his nose already turning an alarming shade of pink.
Sherlock allowed himself a few more precious seconds to bask in the moment before he reluctantly stood, making sure to safely tuck the memory away in his mind. He headed to the kitchen table, inhabited with most of his equipment and experiments, and started quietly packing things away into the small bag he’d brought.
Mrs. Hudson opened the door of the flat for John and motioned for him to set the box down beside the couch.
Baker Street was entirely different now. It was empty. Even with Mrs. Hudson and Rosie around, it no longer felt like home. Sherlock supposed it never would.
A single glance at Sherlock reveals that he is deep in thought—at least he seems to be, as far as John can tell. One can never be quite sure when it comes to Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock raked his fingers through his hair, his thoughts running a mile a minute, like an out of control train thundering down the tracks with no means of stopping. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught John clenching and unclenching his fist—a nervous habit, Sherlock had learned.
Sherlock sounds completely wrecked and John groans before climbing back up Sherlock’s body and kissing him soundly, trying to convey all his emotions into the one action of lips and teeth and tongue.
When they finally pulled up outside two twenty-one b, John thrust money at the driver, ensuring to avoid eye contact with him and not bothering to take his change.
Before he could reach the two men, the edge of the embankment crumbled under Carter’s feet and he tumbled backwards, clutching at John’s jumper and pulling him over the edge as well.
Overhead, a small plane passed through the starry sky like a sleek silver bullet, the cacophonous rumbling of its engine intensified by the alcohol roaring in John’s ears.
“Hmmgh?” Sherlock moaned, blinking sleepily a few times and only hesitating a moment before reluctantly removing his head from its perch on John’s shoulder.
John gives him one more quick kiss, leaving the promise of so much more in its wake, and then stands, pulling the detective up with him. They stumble down the hallway as their kissing resumes, John guiding Sherlock—and also mostly holding him up because it seems his legs have stopped functioning altogether.
“It’s been removed. Quite forcefully, by the looks of it,” Sherlock deduced, gesturing to the sharp, mangled metal around the space were the missing handle had once rested.
“Yep, just fine,” Sherlock squeaked as he sidestepped John and made a rather desperate beeline for the elevator.
Richard procured a gun from the waistband of his jeans and took aim at something out of John’s view—most likely Sherlock. The doctor’s heart skipped a beat and he raised his own gun and gave the trigger a squeeze without so much as a moment’s hesitation. The resounding
John’s breath hitched as he suddenly found himself standing in front of Sherlock’s bedroom door. Since the door was shut, he assumed Mrs. Hudson hadn’t been in there since–
Sherlock shivered as they stepped out into the February snow, the ice crunching beneath their boot-clad feet. This did not escape John’s attention.
“Hiding in plain sight,” Sherlock said smugly, though there was a hint of blush rising on his cheeks.
As diligently as he tried not to wake Sherlock when he laid the blanket across the bed, the detective shifted, causing a new handful of shivers to wrack through his weakened body.
John just managed to avoid the inordinately large rock that had been flung not so kindly in his direction by one Carter Mills; a dangerous serial killer who they were currently attempting to apprehend. The brave doctor pulled his gun out, only to have Carter tackle him to the ground—he was a large, unnaturally muscular man who towered over John’s stout figure. The gun went sliding across the concrete and bounced down a hill to land hidden away in the long foliage at the bottom.
John wakes the next morning to the odd sensation that he is being watched. He slowly peels his eyes open only to see Sherlock sitting cross-legged on the bed, staring intently at him. John blinks under the scrutiny.
After scanning the lobby with gazes similar to that of a hawk, the men finally left, disappearing into the elevator. John kissed Sherlock for a moment longer—just in case the men happened to come back—before he stepped back. He kept one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s skinny waist, the other holding onto the front of his coat, seeing as it appeared Sherlock wasn’t currently able to support his own weight.
Just as quickly as the moment began, it ended as John blinked, ripping his eyes from Sherlock’s and clearing his throat far louder than was necessary.
Sherlock flinched slightly as John’s hand entwined itself into his hair, but he made no move to stop the action. John studied Sherlock’s schooled expression closely, attempting to do some deducing himself. Needless to say he quickly found that he was rather unsuccessful in that area.
When he finally woke again, he reluctantly peeled his eyes open to reveal he was in a small—and thankfully dark—room. His head throbbed with each beep from the cardiac monitor and his mouth tasted like it had been used as a garbage dump while he slept. His entire body ached something awful and– Why couldn’t he remember anything? What had happened? How had he ended up like this?
and oh so familiar. Sherlock’s stomach did a flip, every cell in his body screaming at him that something was very, very wrong.
Sherlock throws an arm across his eyes, his toes curling into the sheets and mumbles something rather unintelligible, though John makes it out to be something along the lines of “don’t you dare stop.”
After a long moment of tension-filled silence, the cabbie gave an indignant huff and turned the heat up, as requested.
John’s finger twitched against the cold metal of his gun—a nervous habit. He rounded a corner of particularly tall boxes, checking one way, then the other before proceeding deeper into the icy depths of the freezer. He turned another corner, backing his way down the lengthy row of boxes.
The detective shrunk back slightly before he set to straightening his suit, averting his eyes from John’s.
Sherlock glanced up at John, confusion clearly written across his features. “Are you feeling alright, John?”
They hadn’t spoken a word about how they’d fallen asleep the day before, and a heavy silence hung in the air between them, weighing both men down with unspoken words, suppressed feelings, and a multitude of emotions neither wanted to sift through. Truth be told, John ‘I’m not gay’ Watson was surprisingly alright with falling asleep entangled in Sherlock’s long limbs, though he would never outwardly admit that to anyone—especially himself.
Sherlock glanced behind him to find John was off in the distance, still running towards them. His brows pinched together in confusion: hadn’t John been right behind him?
It only took John a moment to notice the purposeful space left at one end of the couch, enticing him over. John accepted the silent invitation without a moment’s hesitation, dropping onto the cushions beside Sherlock.
John slides into bed and mumbles “stay on your own side,” and he rolls over to face the wall before his traitorous arms and legs and other bits can ignore his mind and give into the temptation of
John rolled his eyes, but decided against arguing further and dutifully followed Sherlock up to room twenty-one.
In one swift movement, John disarms Martin, the knife bouncing along the ground and over the edge of the embankment, landing in the Thames with a
“Anything?” Sherlock asks. John doesn’t miss the suggestive tone of his voice or the curl of his smile against his bare shoulder.
The loud wail of sirens cuts through the air, making both men jump. Lestrade arrives and sends his men to pull out a successfully subdued and rather disoriented Martin McDonald from the icy water, then orders John over to the paramedics.
“Come on!” John shouted, tirelessly performing CPR on Sherlock while barking orders at the rush of nurses and doctors that were swarming the room.
Sherlock nods, then proceeds to insist that John needs to go home to warm up and that paperwork and such can wait until tomorrow. Thankfully, Lestrade doesn’t bother to argue, and soon they’re both sitting in the back of a cab, on their way back to Baker Street.
Sherlock replaced John’s hands back at his side and let his fingers slip from John’s. He backed away slowly, feet shuffling across the wooden floor as though he might risk changing his mind if he moved any quicker.
Sherlock takes a step towards him, opening his mouth as though he’s about to say something, but then snaps it shut just as quickly. John eyes him for a moment, studying his expression in a futile attempt to deduce it. He fails. Obviously.
“I’m not sure,” John said, glancing around the police station as if Sherlock would magically appear at any moment. “He wandered off some time ago. Said he had something to see to. You know how he is.”
Sherlock was only vaguely aware he was yelling. Mycroft laid a hand on his arm and Lestrade stepped forwards, his hand coming to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Thrilling at least, until they wind up exhausted in the pitch-black woods still being relentlessly chased by Marcus, who, it seems, won’t be stopping until Lestrade and his team manage to find him or he drops dead from exhaustion, the latter of the two being far more likely at this point.
Seemingly snapped out of his trance-like state, he flops nonchalantly into his chair with his limbs splayed out at the most awkward of angles, though something about him still seems...off.
John lost track of time as he made a feeble attempt to drink away his consulting detective-shaped sorrows. Unfortunately, the alcohol only succeeded in making his head spin and his vision blur, doing little to dull the sharp pain in his heart.
He tugged the blankets higher on Sherlock’s body until his head was the only thing visible in the dim light and rubbed small circles across the detective’s back in the hope that the friction would help warm him, however marginally. Sherlock hummed softly in appreciation.
John curled into his own chair, sipping his tea in long, burning gulps. The flat was unbearably cold. It had always been slightly drafty with poor insulation, but it seemed far worse now. John shivered despite the warmth from the tea.
Sherlock reached for the doctor as he turned to leave, his long fingers ice cold where they wrapped themselves around John’s wrist and held fast, unwilling to let him go.
“Oh my,” Mrs. Hudson gasped, staring at the two of them from the doorway with her hand held across her heart. “Sorry to have interrupted you boys.”
“Sorry, what was that?” John asks, futilely hoping that the detective won’t deduce his thoughts from the blush rising on his cheeks.
John laid his head against the back of the sofa and shut his eyes—he supposed he could use a nap as well.
They sat in companionable silence for a while before John started to shiver fiercely, unable to control it. Sherlock felt the tremors, glancing over at John with pure concern laced through his silver-blue eyes. He shifted the tarp, double checking that there were no areas where any cold could get through. Once he seemed satisfied, he hesitantly wrapped an arm around John’s shoulders, pulling him closer against his delightfully warm body.
John blinked, only just realizing his face was damp, his eyes spilling over with hot, salty tears. His heart clenched and he curled in on himself in Sherlock’s chair, pressing his face against the edge. He took one deep breath after another in a futile attempt to stop his sobbing lest he wake Mrs. Hudson and–
John stuffed his head under his pillow, pulling down hard on the sides in a futile attempt to drown out the din of the storm. He rolled over with a sigh: the bedside clock told him it was currently 3:26am. With another exasperated sigh, he pulled the covers up to his chin, shut his eyes. Opened them. Squeezed them shut. Put his hands over his ears. The storm continued to howl outside as if it was mocking him, the rain pounding relentlessly against his windows.
John started at the back of Sherlock’s head, quietly considering his options: he could kick Sherlock out of his room with some relatively lame excuse about
“Right,” Lestrade repeated—it certainly didn’t take a genius to deduce the gist of what had happened.
Sherlock blinked groggily as he stared up at John—it was all too clear that he was seriously struggling to stay awake, but he was trying to fight the weight of sleep nonetheless because it had been John who’d requested it. Sherlock had never been one to refuse a request from John. John’s fingers lingered on Sherlock’s neck for a moment longer and he only hesitated for a brief moment before brushing the stray, curled strands of hair from Sherlock’s face. John could have sworn he saw the corners of Sherlock’s mouth curl up for the briefest of moments, but it was probably just the adrenaline coursing through his veins. Yes, that was certainly it; just the adrenaline.
John waited. And waited. And waited. He heard nothing from Sherlock. He wasn’t even sure if he was still alive. Try as he might—and try he did, indeed—he was unable to get any information out of Mycroft. And still he waited. He waited until the question of
“That’s alright. Perfectly normal. You just focus on resting right now.” The man glanced at his watch. “I’ve got some time, I’ll keep you company.”
John reached up and, not wanting to disturb Sherlock’s privacy, tentatively knocked on the door. The whimpers stopped almost instantly, turning instead to muffled sniffles that John was sure Sherlock thought he couldn’t hear.
With the drugs flowing through his veins and the scent of John surrounding him, he could almost hear him. See him. Touch him. Not quite, but almost.
“What? Are you ill?” Sherlock asked, crinkles appearing across his forehead as he attempted unsuccessfully to deduce what was going on.
Much to John’s disappointment, Sherlock settles at the opposite end of the sofa, rather than next to him as he normally does. Okay, up against him. Okay, more like
Sherlock wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He wanted to run far away to a place where John was alright. But instead he leaned down, pressed his lips to John’s—which had gone alarmingly cold—and exhaled, pushing his air into John’s lungs and breathing for him.
John groaned as he forced his stiff limbs to climb the stairs up to two twenty-one B. The way Sherlock was moving, just a few steps ahead of him, without his usual feline-like grace was indication that he was feeling no better than John. Sherlock’s deduction had been alarmingly accurate: Lestrade had been at the warehouse by nine the next morning.
“It’s alright,” John assured, setting the book down and moving closer to his side. The cardiac monitor blipped in protest as Sherlock’s pulse elevated.
Before he knew it, the paramedics were at Sherlock’s side, telling John to back away so they could do their jobs. Their words were indistinct as they filtered through the haze of his mind. As he pulled back slowly, reluctantly doing as they asked, he felt a hand catch his and hold fast, refusing to let go. Sherlock had a surprisingly strong grip considering he’d just been drugged with what could be assumed to be a particularly potent mix of chemicals.
John had finally put Sherlock to bed to sleep off the lasting effects of the drugs, and had just managed to get nearly three whole hours of sleep himself when–
Sherlock stares at him with wide eyes and a slight frown that John thinks is rather adorable. The detective nods once, sits down in his chair, then promptly rises to pace around the room until he finds himself hovering over John again.
clue, did he? It baffled John how someone so smart could be so stupid when it came to particular matters.
Sherlock nodded once and then made his way down the hall to the bathroom. It had been hours, and they’d heard nothing about John. Thankfully Mycroft had ensured only the best doctors were working on him. But
Sherlock pried himself off the door and pointed at the remnants of where a handle would have once rested.
He feels warm and content and rather happy as Sherlock dries him off and helps him dress before tucking him into his bed. It’s rather odd though—as soon as Sherlock leaves his bedroom, it was as though he’d taken all the heat with him, and John’s shivering resumes, making it incredibly difficult for him to actually fall asleep.
“Am I? Thank you John,” Sherlock said, looking so truly, genuinely touched that John didn’t bother to correct him.
Sherlock’s eyes found John’s and he smiled weakly, his face alarmingly pale. “We stopped it, didn’t we?” he mumbled before his head lolled to the side.
“I’m sorry. John, this is all my fault. I should’ve seen the blood trail was a trap,” Sherlock apologized. “Stupid, stupid,
“It will be important to conserve body heat.” Sherlock’s eyes darted around the room and John could nearly
he’d thought to himself: a potential flatmate that he didn’t want to strangle within seconds of meeting. Perhaps this could prove to be a fruitful arrangement after all.
“I’m not real. I don’t exist,” he whispered, his breath ice cold where it ghosted across Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock finally released John, sitting up to look just slightly to the left of his eyes—due to his profound embarrassment, he absolutely refused to look John in the eye. To John’s surprise, he found Sherlock was actually
John swallowed as he turned the knob with a shaking hand and gave the door a gentle push. He squinted in the darkness; it seemed he’d been right, a thin layer of dust that wasn’t present in the rest of the flat had settled on everything in the room. John sucked in a breath as he stepped across the threshold into the room—and nearly tripped on a multitude of plant pots, each filled with a small, pure white flower. The pots all had a different amount and type of soil in them—experiment, then—and John found himself breaking out into a fit of slightly hysterical laughter. It was so utterly
Sherlock gazes at him intently, the epitome of puppy dog eyes. John sighs. Sherlock is about to win this unspoken battle. Sherlock always wins.
John has the sudden, inexplicable—okay, maybe not so inexplicable—urge to smash his head against the nearest wall. Repeatedly.
John has tried—and subsequently failed—to imagine what Sherlock had done in the few days he had been missing for.
John leaned forward slowly—giving Sherlock plenty of time to pull back if he wanted—and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder. Shortly after, they found their fingers had entwined with one another of their own accord, though no move was made to untangle them.
John’s breath stuttered to a halt. “What– What are you saying?” he asked, though he was quite sure he already knew what Sherlock’s answer would be.
“I just thought you boys might want a cuppa, but I’ll just come back later, how’s that? Or maybe I’ll just come by in the morning.” Mrs. Hudson, apparently forgetting altogether that John was in fact, getting married to a
“It’s not like we’ll starve in here,” John said, glancing around at the multitude of boxes of ice cream treats—too bad ice cream sandwiches, frozen fruit bars and fudge bars couldn’t help them escape the confines of the freezer.
John smiled and raised an eyebrow at Sherlock. Sherlock wrapped a long arm around John’s waist and dragged his fingertips across the waistband of John’s jeans until– Ah yes, there was his gun, nestled safely into the back of his jeans.
John carefully opened the door of two-twenty one b, wincing at the creak that echoed through the hallways as it swung open. He paused a beat, holding his breath. When he was sure Mrs. Hudson was still fast asleep, he crept into the sitting room, eyes darting around the space. Just as Mrs. Hudson had said to him in the cemetery, she hadn’t touched a single thing, save for a bit of dusting.
John peeled back his sheets, reluctantly leaving the warmth of his bed and began to make his way downstairs.
“Sherlock,” John repeated, gently shaking at his shoulders. “Stay with me. You can’t fall asleep, I don’t know what he gave you.”
“That’s the bloody point!” John shouted. “Moriarty is playing you. He knew you’d never figure it out. Who do you love most?”
“I’m John,” he said, reaching out to place a hand on his pale wrist—whether it was meant to check his pulse or be a comforting gesture, he wasn’t sure.
Sherlock’s breath hitches. His long fingers twitch against the warmth of John’s skin. It looks like he’s about to cry, John thinks. Sherlock Holmes doesn’t cry. He doesn’t feel. Apparently, both of those things are not true when it concerns John.
“My brother had a brilliant mind. He could’ve done anything he set his mind to. Could’ve helped people. Caught criminals. Cured cancer. But did he? No,” Mycroft said with disdain. “Instead he turned to drugs. Got hooked. Said it helped quiet his mind. Ironic, isn’t it?”
of them before snuggling closer to John and resting his head on the doctor’s shoulder. It appears he plans on staying the night there, then.
“You know,” she said. “You two would have got on real well.” She turned around from where she was surveying the flat to give John a wink.
At some point, he found himself in the back of the ambulance at John’s side, clutching at his hand as they raced through the streets of London. The paramedic sat back and said something about the fact that they’ve done all they can until they reach the hospital and that John is in somewhat stable condition and he’s lucky that Sherlock was there.
So when Sherlock sinks into the water behind him, wraps his long arms around John’s waist and pulls him in against his chest, John happily obliges and sinks back into the comforting heat of his flatmate’s body.
John thinks he hears Sherlock shriek and then there’s hands clutching at his shirt and his arms, dragging him out onto the bank. Sherlock’s face hovers above him and John thinks he’s never seen Sherlock look that
“Yes. Yes, of course,” Sherlock said, taking the smallest steps he could possibly manage back towards the couch.
From the small amount of time he’d spent with Sherlock, he could tell that he was quite human indeed—unlike his insensitive, callous brother.
Sherlock slid off the seat as the taxi started moving until he was crumpled into a heap of limbs on the floor of the taxi.
Outside, the rain still pattered softly against the windows, creating a soothing lull of calming noise. Sherlock shifted, rearranging his limbs on the couch until he was pressed against John’s side, nuzzling into the doctor’s neck.
John had fallen asleep as soon as his head had hit the pillow. Apparently almost freezing to death is a rather exhausting feat.
John very quickly discovered the address Sherlock had sent him was the address for a hotel—most likely the same hotel their victim had been a guest at. John spotted Sherlock waiting in the lobby almost immediately.
Sherlock’s gaze softened, the worry on his face visibly relaxing now that he knew John wasn’t angry with him.
John forced himself to suck in a deep breath. “Promise me,” he whispered. “Promise me you’ll come back.”
That was when he got the text. It was from Lestrade. It was clear even to John it had been hastily typed and sent.
John manages to kick the door of his bedroom shut and deposits Sherlock on his bed, laid out in the middle with his dressing gown flowing around him like an ethereal work of art. How is it possible, John thinks, for someone so infuriatingly
Sherlock clings to John as if his very life depends on his existence. Perhaps it does, John thinks, filing it away for a later discussion.
Sherlock’s eyes were fixed directly on him now, staring at him with a hungry sort of longing that made John’s breath catch in his throat. For a period of time that was far too long and yet not long enough, they simply gazed at one another, eyes locked in some form of an impasse. John had stopped breathing altogether and he was sure if he pulled his eyes from Sherlock’s, he’d find that he had ceased to breathe as well.
They let him pass by, then wait a few moments, just to make sure he hasn’t somehow turned himself around and headed back towards them.
“Ah, yes. You must be Mycroft Holmes,” John said, replacing the clipboard he held and holding out a hand for Mycroft to shake.
John smiles into Sherlock’s neck and whispers, “so are you, love,” into his ear, causing Sherlock’s entire body to shudder. John carefully peels himself from atop Sherlock despite the detective’s many protests and pops downstairs to collect a damp flannel from the bathroom. Once John has cleaned them both off—which takes far longer than it should have, seeing as he is forced to stop every few seconds to kiss a demanding Sherlock—he lies back down, tucking the covers around both of them.
it was, only that he could get drunk from it. John snuck out onto the fire escape of Mike’s flat with his bounty in hand.
“And I’m not arguing with you right now. We do this together,” John insisted, dropping to his knees next to Sherlock in order to study the bomb.
John leaps out of bed and dashes down the stairs, the telling trail of smoke leading him directly to Sherlock’s bedroom. John bursts through the door to find Sherlock dressed in only a worn, old t-shirt and pyjama pants standing over his bed, which is indeed smoking. In his hand is what appears to be a recently-emptied glass of what was hopefully water and not some other noxious chemical.
“Goodbye John,” Sherlock said, his voice trembling something fierce. John could have sworn he saw a steady stream of tears falling down Sherlock’s cheeks, but it was far more likely that he was just seeing things in the pitch-black. The alternative made his heart clench and rip and tear in an attempt to escape the bounds of his chest.
Mycroft’s expression didn’t change at all—either he was very skilled at masking his emotions or he simply had ice where his heart should have been. Something told John it was more likely to be the latter.
“I’m calling Lestrade.” John pulled out his phone and dialed. “We’re going to need all the help we can get with this.”
A few moments passed in which John looked for something, although he wasn’t quite sure what that ‘something’ was.
Sherlock smiled to himself when he heard footsteps—albeit angry ones—thunking across the floor of the upper level of the flat. Seconds later, John appeared at the bottom of the stairs, arms crossed in a stance that was presumably meant to convey a certain amount of distain.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to John’s for a moment, a slight glint rising in them, before returning to rest on the left side of his face. John wondered what Sherlock saw reflected in them.
One particular evening, John had just returned from a grueling double shift at the surgery, and he made a beeline for the sofa where he promptly sunk into the cushions with a sigh. Sherlock was slouched in his chair, limbs askew and eyes closed, but he must have heard John come in because the moment he’d settled on the sofa, Sherlock sprung from his chair to join him. To be honest, after the day he’s had, John wouldn’t mind a bit of cuddling—all completely platonic, of course.
John makes sure to shut and lock his bedroom door to prevent Sherlock from wandering back in—unlikely as it is, the man does have no concept of personal space—and he quickly and efficiently takes care of the rather inconvenient side effect waking next to Sherlock has had on his body. He is unable to stop himself from gasping his flatmate’s name and claps a hand over his mouth as the waves of pleasure course through him.
“That’s all right, I suppose,” John said. “Lestrade knew we were coming here, he’ll figure out we’re missing and come looking for us.”
He let his fingers wander back into Sherlock’s dark curls, gently massaging his scalp. Despite being as smart as he was, John figured even Sherlock’s mind wouldn’t remember anything once he’d sobered up.
When they arrived at the crime scene—which thankfully was inside a warm building, sheltered from the rain and not a single freezer in sight—Donovan ushered them towards Lestrade, who was standing over a body, mouth tight in a grim line.
Sherlock stirs, roused by the movement and gives a small hum of approval, snuggling deeper into John’s neck, his lips now brushing the sensitive skin there. John relaxes bonelessly into the sheets, feeling more at ease than he has in– well, ever, really, if he’s being honest with himself. He silently resigns himself to being content—okay, quite a bit more than content—with having a lie-in with his flatmate. His friend. His
“Is that the one where he pushes his archnemesis right off the bridge?” she asked a bit too enthusiastically.
But other things were different too. There were unnecessary, lingering touches. There was eye contact, completely unabashed. There were private, little smiles, meant only for the other to see. They were happy. They truly were. Somehow after everything, they were inexplicably, happily content with their new life.
John tucked the worn blanket under his arm, taking care not to trip over the ends as he crept back into Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Are you even listening to me?” Sherlock huffs and shifts in his chair, the dressing gown—and his legs, for that matter—falling slightly more open, as though it’s a silent invitation.
The silken fabric of the dressing gown bunches and wrinkles under the assault from Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock purposefully turns his head away, unwilling to meet John’s eyes as he speaks. “I don’t like leaving you alone. It– worries me.” Then the words come out in a rush, like a dam breaking somewhere deep inside Sherlock, allowing all his thoughts to flow out freely. “I know I’m only in the next room but if there was an emergency I might not get here in time and you have to be alright because you can’t be not alright John please understand I want to keep you safe
“We’ve got all the time in the world,” John mumbles into Sherlock’s hair. He’s not sure why he says it, but he does, and it feels
Oddly enough, the Sherlock in his memories was nothing like the Sherlock he remembered. He had no recollection of John, yet he seemed to be Sherlock’s– friend? That couldn’t be right—he didn’t have
the next day, winked at them before disappearing from the room and making sure to shut the door behind her.
“Would you happen to know where I’m supposed to go, young man?” the woman asked. “I was told to come this way to pick up some belongings of a– friend.”
They lay there in companionable silence for a while—besides the storm battering against the walls of the flat. The room lit up suddenly with a bright flash of light, followed directly by a deafening
The taxi hit a bump, jostling John from his thoughts and causing Sherlock to snuggle even closer to John, if that was at all possible.
Once Sherlock had deemed it safe enough to let go and that John was no longer in risk of falling, he did so.
There was a splash in the distance and Sherlock followed the sound through the dark like a bloodhound locked onto a scent. As he neared the source of the sound, his eyes came to rest on a body floating face down near the shore. A brilliant red was diffusing through the water that surrounded the light hair, tainting the otherwise crystal clear water a deep, sickening scarlet.
John took a deep breath before returning the gaze, staring straight into Sherlock’s eyes. John stumbled distractedly over his own feet, but neither man seemed to take much notice. Sherlock’s only response was to shift his hand so it no longer rested on John’s shoulder, but on his back now, pulling him in even closer still. And who was John to say no?
John cried until he felt he had no tears left, and then cried even more, until finally he slipped away into a grief-stricken slumber, not at all peaceful by any means, but made somewhat bearable by the constant scent of pure
Sherlock shifts and John can feel his eyelashes flutter against his neck as he wakes. Sherlock stills as he realizes his body is tangled with John’s, then seems to relax into John when he realizes his arms are also wrapped around him, returning the embrace.
It was rather funny, thought John, how he could feel so alone while surrounded by so many people. But in a room filled with all the people who loved him most, the one man who truly mattered was missing, his absence leaving a large void in John’s heart that only seemed to grow by the second. It hurt so much it was positively
. He liked having Sherlock’s slender body so achingly close to his. He liked Sherlock’s long limbs wrapped around him, entrapping him. Claiming him.
“Yes, I think I can,” John said, finally releasing his grip on Sherlock enough so that he could look at him. Sherlock refused to meet his eyes.
The man took a step forward, then another, then mumbled something that Sherlock couldn’t quite make out due to the mask and the considerable distance left between them.
“Sherlock, if you want me to pass you your phone, it is right there on the table,” John pointed rather aggressively at Sherlock’s mobile, which was indeed resting amongst the haphazard clutter on the kitchen table.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two-two-one B Baker Street.” Sherlock gave him a playful wink before sauntering off down the hallway.
When it became clear after a moment that John would not be releasing Sherlock anytime soon, he began to relax slightly into the embrace, and even wrapped his own arms around John, resting one across his back and the other against the nape of his neck.
“You shouldn’t be going out like this, especially not in this weather,” John warned as they donned their coats, handing Sherlock his scarf rather forcefully.
They had been running through the streets of London in pursuit of one Marcus Wallman for their latest case, although somewhere along the way, the tables had turned quite considerably, and now Marcus is the one doing the chasing. With a knife. A very
“Relax,” John assured him. “It’s alright.” When the worry didn’t seem to have any intention of leaving Sherlock, John added, “I’m staying. Go back to sleep.”
John hastily undoes the top few buttons of his nightshirt before he can get a chance to actually think about what he’s doing. He takes Sherlock’s hand and slips it into his shirt, placing it right over his heart. His heart is beating wildly like an out of control train and he’s sure Sherlock can feel it too.
“Yes, that’s my name,” Sherlock said slowly, as if he were explaining something to a small child. His eyebrows furrowed as he took in the look of shock on everyone’s abnormally pale faces. “Have I missed something?” he asked, genuinely confused.
“Oh!” the woman exclaimed, her swollen eyes lighting up in recognition. “You must be the doctor who kept him company! The receptionist told me how you always visited him on your breaks. Said you read to him?”
“Sherlock?” John questions, because this behavior is getting far too strange for John to handle without going mad himself. “Are you alright?”
It took three weeks for John to stop picturing his best friend’s body lying on the cold pavement every time he closed his eyes.
The following few weeks are comprised of heated gazes, lingering touches, considerably closer proximity at crime scenes—at a particularly gruesome one, they even allow their fingers to brush together—seemingly purposeful caresses, fingers brushing against one another as tea is passed back and forth, and Sherlock constantly insisting that he’s cold and snuggling up next to John on the sofa, despite the fact that there is always a blanket draped across the back of the sofa. Apparently retrieving said blanket would require too much focus to be redirected from whatever case Sherlock happened to be in the midst of solving at the time, so John didn’t bother to make a fuss about it.
Sherlock squirmed under John’s hands, but he held fast, making sure they were angled just so, so that Sherlock’s face wasn’t visible to anyone from the lobby. Judging by the slightly disturbed looks on the faces of the four men as they glanced in their direction, it was clear that this was certainly the best way to ensure the men didn’t bother them. Meanwhile, Sherlock was
He is met with soft, rhythmical puffs of breath against his neck from the now-sleeping Sherlock. John smiles and soon follows Sherlock into slumber.
“He never did want a grave,” Mrs. Hudson said as they strolled through the cemetery. “This was all his brother’s meddling– It’s this one, here.”
“Let me help you, John,” Sherlock says softly, moving to remove his coat from John’s shoulders. John shies away to the best of his ability, considering his slightly frozen state.
The singular thought of it alone was enough to make him curl his lip up into a sneer and run quite quickly in the other direction.
“Shh, it’s okay Sherlock. Breathe. I need you to breathe for me. Can you do that?” John mumbled, trying to reassure Sherlock before he started hyperventilating.
Sherlock sleeps beside him again that night. They don’t talk about what happened in the morning. It is as though it’s been forgotten, pushed back to the depths of their minds.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he uttered an “Oh no,” before he was gone in a flurry of swishing coat. John forced a breath of air into his starved lungs before picking up a jog in pursuit of the detective.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock said, the faintest smile ghosting across his lips at the slight comfort of the familiar normalcy.
“Moriarty.” The word slipped off his tongue and through his lips like oil, leaving behind a taste of fermented death in his mouth.
John’s eyes darted wildly around the space just beside Sherlock’s head, unable to look him in the eye. He could
“Good day,” he said in a cheery falsetto and slipped from the room, leaving John stunned into silence in the middle of the morgue.
“No, I’m fine Sher–” John pauses when he sees the way Sherlock’s face falls slightly. John sighs. “Tea would be nice.”
In one swift motion, John lifts Sherlock up and onto the table, his legs instinctively wrapping around John’s waist and his ankles hooking together behind John’s back. John’s sweatpants go flying over his shoulder in the general direction of the sofa and he buries his fingers in Sherlock’s disheveled hair and pulls him in for a searing kiss.
Or perhaps after a case. Adrenaline rushing through their veins, still high from the thrill and it would be too much to hold back. They would meet halfway, pressed up against the walls and then...
He could feel small, weak puffs of breath against his face, unassailable proof that John was there. He was alive.
The man pivoted until he was facing Sherlock, still humming that same tune. He had a mask on, covering everything but his eyes, which were dark and cold and
“’M like you, John Watson,” Sherlock drawled as he clambered into the taxi, maneuvering his long limbs with the grace equivalent to that of a hippopotamus. “You very nice.”
“All ready,” he announced, showing John the screen of his phone which was indeed set for exactly five minutes.
John quirks an eyebrow. This is new. Well, Sherlock telling him how to write his blog is not by any means new, but he’s never done it in such a
Even though Sherlock’s eyes hadn’t slipped south so much as once while he was undressing John, the doctor can’t help but steal a brief glance downwards. The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirks into a lopsided grin, his eyebrows slightly raised. John can’t help but grin back before Sherlock helps him sink into the pleasantly hot water. Perhaps it’s because of the cold, or perhaps it’s simply from the events leading up to this day, but John decides that he’s rather tired of attempting—and failing—to hide his feelings from his flatmate.
“Tea?” he asked, glancing into the sitting room where Sherlock was already wrapped into a ball on his chair, head buried somewhere beneath his coat.
John glanced up to see Sherlock frozen like a picturesque statue, staring at something across the lobby.
Sherlock shut his eyes and steepled his fingers under his chin, preparing to sort through all the newly unearthed memories he’d retrieved whilst asleep. He still didn’t remember why he was in the hospital, though. He assumed it must have been a particularly dangerous case they’d been working on that had gone wrong and filed it away for further investigation at a later time.
Sherlock strode to the bed and slipped under the covers, unceremoniously dragging John on top of him. John just barely managed to catch his weight on his arms, which were currently situated on either side of Sherlock. As Sherlock arranged the sheets over them just so, making it look like they were fully nude, John desperately tried to slow the beating of his heart lest he have a heart attack right here on top of Sherlock.
“Her purse,” Sherlock pointed to a large brown leather bag resting on the ground a mere few meters from the victim.
If John didn’t know any better, he’d say he was shagging Sherlock senseless. And he is rather proud of that fact; that him and him alone could stop that brilliant mind of Sherlock’s, no matter how fleetingly.
. Well, okay, he’s not so much eating as licking his favourite jam from his fingers in an unnecessarily seductive manner that’s about to make John spin on his heel and head back to his room to take matters into his own hands—quite literally—for the second time that morning. But Sherlock is
John took a sip of his tea before setting the mug down on the side table and returning his full attention to the newspaper. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock flitting around the flat, his silken housecoat flowing dramatically out behind him. He paused to scribble something in a notebook at the cluttered kitchen table, then turned with a dramatic
Sherlock rolled his eyes, although there was a suspiciously joyful glint to them. “There’s nothing wrong with me John. It’s for an experiment.”
Sherlock tilted his head sideways in a questioning glance, his sleep-tousled hair falling over to rest on one side of his head. John forgot to breathe.
” Mycroft sneered at the mere mention of the name, then turned on his heel and made his way to the door.
By the time John had returned to Sherlock’s bedroom, computer in hand, the detective was fast asleep, his face pressed deeply into the pillow and the covers pulled high around his shoulders. John slid on top of the covers on the opposite side of the bed, resting his back against the headboard and being careful not to jostle the bed too much and risk waking Sherlock. He looked positively peaceful when he slept and far younger, John noticed—the lines of concentration that were so common were nowhere to be found. John smiled to himself at the sight.
The woman was older and her auburn hair swirled around her head in slightly unruly curls—her red and puffy eyes did not go unnoticed.
He slipped in and out of consciousness for a while after that. When he finally managed to peel his eyes open, he found a wide array of doctors and nurses huddled around him, tirelessly working away. Whatever happened must have been quite serious. The sporadic beeping of a cardiac monitor made his head pound something awful, and thankfully he passed out once more.
“Best friend,” Sherlock said again, as though saying it out loud would somehow make it more official. A rare, genuine smile spread across his face, saying more than his words ever could about his feelings towards this new title. “I like it,” he announced, his eyes gleaming as he smiled at John almost as brightly as they did when he was solving a particularly complicated murder.
John shivers and wraps his arms around his middle, curling up as much as possible where he’s seated on the back of the ambulance. No less than a moment later, something soft and heavy and undeniably
“I’m not joking,” Sherlock said. “Think think thinkthinkthink. Oh!” he exclaimed. “That’s brilliant!”
John gave in to the temptation shortly, dropping his head to rest against the warmth radiating from Sherlock’s shoulder. As though he’d been waiting for it—perhaps he’d already deduced it would happen—Sherlock dropped his head to rest on John’s, burying his nose deeply into the warmth of the doctor’s hair.
with me that I ‘zoned out,’ as you would put it, instead of holding a simple conversation with you.”
And then Sherlock is gone, his leg removed from John’s waist. His head gone from the doctor’s chest. And the man himself is sliding out from under the covers and
“Hey.” John gently pushes against Sherlock’s chest until he can look at him. “What’s this?” He gestures towards the brightly lit laptop screen.
As John is wheeled out of the house on a gurney—only slightly cognizant—Sherlock will run over to his side and clutch at his hand. This is where he will stay for the better part of the next three weeks. Lestrade is happy that he’d asked four separate officers to keep Sherlock away from the house until the suspect had been apprehended—judging by the way Sherlock is currently glaring at Clyde, he surely would’ve killed him if he’d been given the chance.
“Quickly,” Sherlock hissed, the footsteps nearly outside their door. “Pants can stay on,” he added, though it brought little comfort to John.
For the longest time, John heard no movement from the other side of the paper, aside from Sherlock taking a few steps, presumably to return to his notebook. It was because of this presumption that John was especially surprised when the couch dipped slightly to his right. Suddenly, a glorious warmth was pressed up against his side as Sherlock curled his legs up onto the couch, leaning against John. His head found a place to rest on John’s shoulder.
” John breathes, and Sherlock hums, the sound vibrating against John’s hand and sending all his blood rushing southwards.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Moriarty’s voice purred through the phone. “How lovely to finally make your acquaintance. We are going to have so much fun together.”
Sherlock crept up the stairs, studiously avoiding the left side of the second step, middle of the sixth, right of the eighth, and the tenth step entirely—the less noise he made the better. He was surprised to find the door of two-twenty one b open a jar—Mrs. Hudson must have got distracted and forgotten to close it; she was rather scatterbrained at times. As he’d deduced—more like overheard at the cemetery—she’d continued to clean and dust the flat, yet hadn’t moved any of his things.
“Alright,” Sherlock began. “You’ll be leading, obviously. So first, take a step forward with your left foot.”
Sherlock finally settled on picking up his violin, turning his back to John as he stared blankly out the window, playing a melancholy tune that just barely managed to drown out the wind.
Sherlock gave a small sound of disapproval, and John found himself suddenly pressed insistently closer against Sherlock, the sides of his Belstaff wrapped around John’s body. It was an awkward position for John with most of his body weight leaning against Sherlock; his head was forced to be tilted uncomfortably, his muscles screaming their protest.
—he wondered if Sherlock was still alive. If he remembered his promise, whispered in the darkness in that single stolen, vulnerable moment. Eventually, John moved on—with his life, perhaps, but never his heart, for his heart would belong to the great Sherlock Holmes until the end of time itself.
“Cold?” John asked as he reached for Sherlock’s forehead. “God, you’re like ice, come here Sherlock.”
John paused his reading to listen to the faint mumbling nonsense coming from the madman’s lips. Suddenly all at once, as though a switch had been flipped in his brain, the words became completely coherent—although a bit slurred with sleep and the drugs the hospital had given him.
“No. No. No.” Sherlock could hear himself repeating. He could physically feel his world shattering down around him, the shards digging into his heart until it burst, wide open and flayed and completely, utterly broken.
His question was answered with a deafening silence that was quite unusual to be coming from the great Sherlock Holmes.
A few moments later, there was a creak followed by a gasp that could barely be heard over the volume of the music. John and Sherlock pulled away from each other almost instantaneously, like two opposing magnets repelled by one another.
Sherlock was sprawled out on the couch with John resting on top of him, in between his legs. John’s face was nuzzled in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and one of his arms was lost somewhere underneath Sherlock’s body, the fingers of his other hand tangled into his dark curls. Sherlock’s head was tilted slightly so that his nose was buried deeply in John’s hair, both of his arms wrapped around John, holding him tightly against his chest.
With a sigh, John untangles himself from the grasp of Sherlock’s possessive arms and legs and body, and carefully slides out from under him, taking care to replace the blankets, tucking them around Sherlock’s lithe frame. He pulls on an old pair of sweatpants just in case Mrs. Hudson decides to make an unscheduled appearance in their flat and heads downstairs to use the loo.
“Oh, of course. I can get them for you,” John said, holding the door open for her as they made their way back into the morgue. “So sorry for your loss.”
“John?” Sherlock asked. His vision had blurred, making John’s face look distorted and hopefully paler than it actually was. Hot tears ran down his face and dripped onto the floor, mingling with John’s blood.
The funeral had been dull. Certainly not fit for someone as incredible as John. He would’ve hated it, Sherlock thought bitterly. He’d left the church early, in fact, to go sit at John’s grave. He’d sit there and talk for hours, as he’d been doing almost every day. He hadn’t fully realized what he’d done to John that day he jumped off the roof at St. Barts hosptial. Now he understood.
And it was. But this one was different. This one was dangerous. Even more dangerous than what Sherlock was used to. John couldn’t help the rising dread in the pit of his stomach.
“What the hell are you doing in my bed?” John asked, trying not to feel a pang in his chest at the puppy-like eyes Sherlock was currently giving him.
“Although I’m beginning to think jumping out the window may very well be our best option,” Sherlock added.
“But– You– What if–” Sherlock stutters for what John thinks is probably the first time in his life, then says, “
with Sherlock Holmes. And that’s alright, he thinks, feeling perfectly at ease with the startling fact he’s just admitted to himself.
“Hmm? Yes, I have to get back to work,” the doctor said, replacing the plastic chair in its respective corner.
With a nod John set off, diligently searching for anything of the sort. He was immensely grateful being stuck in here with Sherlock—best chance not to freeze to death, and if he was being honest with himself, the company wasn’t half-bad either.
Sherlock had left the flat early that morning before John was up. He’d left the case files on the cluttered table for John to read over along with a note:
Sherlock hovers while John sits on the back of the ambulance, teeth chattering despite the blanket the paramedics have wrapped around him. The detective keeps sending him sidelong glances then frowning and looking away before repeating the cyclical process all over.
Sherlock insists on tucking John in—“Drafts John! You could get a chill”—then hesitates, hovering near the doorway. John is quite sure Sherlock is prepared to stand there all night long.
Sherlock surprised John for what was likely the millionth time that day when he reached up and slowly brushed his thumb across John’s bottom lip, his eyes darting between John’s eyes and his lips.
The curls gave a slight bounce that John took to be a nod of his head. The room was seemingly suspended in a state of deafening silence, the sound—or lack thereof, rather—rang hollowly in John’s ears.
like him. John sucked in a deep breath, inhaling as much of Sherlock’s scent as he physically could, desperately trying to commit every ounce of it to his memory.
And so, if they stayed in bed for the rest of the day—and perhaps the next day as well—who could blame them?
It was the longest elevator ride either of them had ever been on. Sherlock was nearly as white as a sheet and John felt as though the deafening silence might just wrap itself around his throat and hold tight.
John decided he would actually very much like to find out what it was like to be completely and utterly destroyed by Sherlock Holmes.
” John knows he’s going to regret this. In fact, he already does. Yet he doesn’t. It’s an awfully bad idea, this.
John sighed. “Sherlock?” he asked slowly, leaning down until he was almost eye level with the detective. “What are you doing down there?”
“They’re gone now,” Sherlock mumbled in between gasps for breath and gave John a gentle push. The doctor obeyed, rolling off of Sherlock.
“Sure.” John limped towards the victim’s side—apparently, having a rather significant amount of weight cutting of the circulation of one’s leg, which was previously ailed with a psychosomatic limp, for more than five hours was a bit not good.
John thought incredulously. He tugged impatiently at the fabric until he finally gave up and simply ripped the shirt open, sending the buttons flying in all directions.
Sherlock is staring at him now, hovering above him, the corners of his mouth pulled downwards into a small frown of concern, his cheeks flushed and rather adorably rosy.
John let himself enjoy the feeling of his fingers running through Sherlock’s hair until his soft smile was instantaneously removed from his face. They were stopped in some traffic and the taxi driver was currently looking
The remainder of the drive to Mycroft’s private plane was in a grim silence that filled the whole car, entwining itself around each occupant as if it were death itself.
John could have sworn Sherlock tried to burrow his face even deeper into John’s neck, muttering something that sounded an awful lot like ‘damn it.’
John gave him a sideways glance, their noses nearly brushing against one another. “Is that a good ‘hmm’ or a bad ‘hmm?’”
“Did he really solve all those cases? Most of what he said in his sleep didn’t make much sense, but– Did he really save all those people?”
“Thanks?” Lestrade said, his confusion evident from the telling lilt at the end of the word—Sherlock had long since decided confusion was most likely the man’s main state.
“He knew we were following up on a lead, not actually pursuing the killer who happened to be here. It’s late, he won’t realize anything’s amiss until we don’t show up tomorrow morning.”
“Yes, as you’ve said. And I was actually planning on going to bed following the proceedings of this experiment but now it seems I don’t have a bed.” Sherlock pauses, studying his bed for a moment. “Well, a usable one,” he amends.
It was glaringly, blatantly obvious how they felt for one another. Not just in this moment, but in all the subtle looks. The unnecessarily extended periods of eye contact. The simple things they remembered about one another. How well they knew each other, like they were two halves of a whole.
By mid-afternoon, John insisted that Sherlock at least try to eat some reheated soup that Mrs. Hudson had brought up with the tea earlier that morning, saying ‘nothing heals like my chicken soup recipe, so eat up dear!’
The bed dipped and rustled as Sherlock shifted closer to John until he was pressed up against his side. He draped an arm across John’s stomach and nuzzled into the crook of his neck, unable to stop himself from letting out a small sigh. In turn, John wrapped his own arms around Sherlock.
A single tear ran down Sherlock’s cheek, shining in the dim light like a shooting star across the darkness of the night sky.
There is a crash as Sherlock’s laptop is knocked off the desk by his hip and it clatters to the floor. Neither man takes any notice. They continue kissing and kissing and kissing and then they kiss some more, the kettle long forgotten.
and how easy would it be to just sidle up to him and– John’s eyes trail hungrily down Sherlock’s lean frame. It seems Sherlock is wearing absolutely nothing under his deep blue dressing gown, judging from the way it’s riding indecently high on his thighs and dropping open to create a vee at the neck, both places revealing planes of soft, pale skin just waiting to be touched, mapped, kissed, sucked,
Sherlock blinked, dropping his hands to his sides, his piercing gaze landing directly on John, who was unfortunately still staring at the delightful wonder that was Sherlock Holmes. John ripped his gaze away and snapped up his paper to what he hoped was a height that would cover his reddening face.
They soon fell into an easy rhythm together, dancing through the flat and somehow managing not to knock any furniture over.
John rubbed gingerly at his eyes, still red and puffy from crying for who knows how long before he fell asleep. He blinked, letting his eyes gradually adjust to the darkness of the room. His gaze wandered to the flower pots.
“Ohh,” Mrs. Hudson said in a conspiratorially hushed whisper. “It’s alright dear, I won’t say anything.” She mimed zipping her mouth shut and throwing the key away.
Another nurse solemnly switched off the monitor, plunging the room into a deafening silence that bounced off the walls and threatened to consume each occupant whole.
“Lucky we don’t have a case, eh?” John said. “Or you’d be dragging me around the city in the middle of this storm,” John gestured towards the window where the wind was howling fiercely outside.
John silently wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, his other hand finding its way into the mop of dark curls atop Sherlock’s head. He was lulled asleep once more by Sherlock’s light, rhythmic breaths filling the silence of the bedroom.
John hastily finished examining the body and headed off in search of Sherlock, masking his returned limp as much as possible.
“I can– achoo! Hear you,” came a grumble, muffled considerably by the heavy material of the sweatshirt.
They lay like that for a while, tired and spent and sated until Sherlock finally murmurs, “John, you are absolutely–” He pauses to take a breath. “Brilliant. Marvelous. Amazing. Incredible. Fantastic.”
Time for stolen kisses in dark alleys. Time for sleepy kisses in the morning. Time for kisses that speak more than words ever could. Time for heated kisses that promise much more to come.
When the cab finally pulled up outside Baker Street though, Sherlock ripped his hand from John’s and disappeared into the flat before John even had a chance to blink, leaving him to pay the fare. Typical, though at least some of their familiar normality had returned.
And so John does take Sherlock’s hand, and they run off into the night together. Once they’ve gotten back into the city, their hands remain tightly clasped together. They don’t let go until they’re back in their flat and forced to part only to go to their respective bedrooms for the night.
He clenches the sheets into a fist in his free hand, trying to ground himself as much as possible. He tentatively opens his eyes to find Sherlock’s wide blue eyes only a mere few centimeters from his own. It is then that he realizes he isn’t being smothered, he’s being
John thinks over his options for a few moments before he realizes Sherlock’s breathing has evened out. It seems he’s actually fallen asleep. On John’s shoulder. Pressed entirely against John’s side.
John craned his neck to look down at Sherlock, who’d apparently fallen asleep at some point on his shoulder. He could feel Sherlock’s chest rise and fall against him with every steady breath he took.
He managed to slip back into a peaceful sleep filled with more recovered memories of himself and John running about London solving the most gruesome of murders and the most heinous of crimes.
The alcohol burned pleasantly as it made its way down his throat, contrasting against the chill of the night air.
John closed the gap between them, pulling Sherlock into his arms. The detective responded in kind by wrapping himself around John until they were so entwined, John wasn’t sure they’d ever be able to untangle themselves from one another. Not that he’d want to. He’d be more than content to spend the rest of his life like this, in Sherlock’s arms, and he was quite certain that Sherlock felt the same.
John was quite glad Sherlock couldn’t see his face, because for the next forty-three seconds or so, he wore an expression best described by his mother as one he could ‘catch flies with,’ his mouth agape and forming a lovely ‘o’ shape.
“Why Sherlock? Why would you do that?” John asked once he felt Sherlock was not in immediate danger of losing consciousness from his panicked, sporadic breaths.
It was an awfully transparent excuse, but that fact was easily ignored with Sherlock pressed so close against John.
John spread out a blanket in front of it while Mrs. Hudson arranged the flowers she’d brought accordingly before settling down next to him. John pulled out his book and turned to the page he’d bookmarked.
John gave Sherlock five minutes to change into something decidedly more comfortable than his suit and after six minutes and one thoroughly frustrated ‘harumph,’ John gave up and knocked on the door.
The cab turns a rather violent corner and John nearly knocks his skull against the window. He’s startled when a hand comes to rest atop his own. It seems Sherlock has been unbalanced as much as John from the harsh corner that the cabbie has just taken, and that this motion is solely meant to be a steadying one. At least this is what John thinks. But then Sherlock’s hand stays there and John thinks that perhaps, there is more to that rather suspicious gesture than meets the eye.
When John woke next, it was not of his own volition—Sherlock was still draped across John’s lap, but he was shivering fiercely, his entire body shuddering against John.
“Right– Sherlock?” John leaned forwards in his chair, ducking his head and trying to establish eye contact with the detective. “What are you doing? Counting all the dust particles on the floor?” God knows he could if he felt so inclined, with that incredibly glorious mind of his.
“That’s fine then, I’ll just call Lestrade. Get him to pop down, and we’ll be on our way,” John said with forced cheerfulness.
“We’ll need to stay warm,” Sherlock said, his mind seemingly kick-starting into action. “It’s likely Lestrade won’t come until tomorrow morning, that gives us–” Sherlock checked the time on his phone, “–eight hours, give or take an hour or so—Lestrade’s mind is impossibly slow.”
Despite all the experiments that ended with a potentially harmful smoke lingering in the air, or how many things Sherlock had deemed necessary to lick at a crime scene, John had never seen the man quite so sick. Or sick at all, for that matter.
Sherlock pulled the sheets up to his chin, as if it were possible to simply hide from all his problems.
John is still busy silently mourning the distinct lack of Sherlock’s immediate presence when something shifts against the underside of his thigh. He looks down to see Sherlock’s toes wiggle once more in a clear attempt to work their way underneath his leg. He gives Sherlock a halfhearted glare for a moment before relenting and allowing Sherlock to slide his toes under the warmth of his thigh.
John ignored the retort. “What kind of experiment are you doing that involves– this,” he gestured between the two of them.
Sherlock sneezed rather forcefully two more times and burrowed down as far as he could into his Belstaff, his shivers becoming more and more violent and all-consuming by the minute.
“Hug. Me.” Sherlock repeated as though he were speaking to someone mentally deficient—which was almost everyone, as far as Sherlock was concerned.
After a series of utterly uncountable minutes passed by, John’s head gained some modicum of control back from the vicinity of his heart—and certain other places—that were currently making decisions for him, however unwise they may have been. He pulled back ever so slightly in order to speak properly.
He heard the crunch of gravel beneath the tires before he saw the sleek black car, pulling up to the curb beside him. He hastily swiped at his cheeks before clambering into the back seat of the car.
They’ve just climbed into a cab, heading back to Baker Street after a particularly taxing case. Sherlock slides in first but stops for some reason unbeknownst to John near the middle of the seat, leaving the doctor to squish in rather uncomfortably on the remaining portion of the seat. He is currently pressed from shoulder to leg against Sherlock, who seems to have no notion of moving further over anytime soon.
“I’m locked in here with the smartest, most brilliant man in all of England, I think we can figure something out,” John insisted.
Sherlock’s head spun violently, making him feel as though he were stuck on an out of control amusement park ride.
John sat on the sofa, his laptop open on his lap, typing up a new entry for his blog. This one was bound to be particularly exciting, seeing the week they’d just survived. He heard Sherlock dragging his heavy feet across the floor before he saw him, slinking towards the couch.
Three days, sixteen hours, fifty-one minutes and seventeen seconds. That was how long Clyde Bryant had held John in his basement—apparently it was becoming a rather well known fact that in order to get to Sherlock Holmes, one only had to threaten John Watson. But, in approximately thirty-two seconds, Lestrade would be pounding on the front door of the residence of one Clyde Bryant.
“John,” he manages to gasp. “Here. Come. Here. Going to. Have to. Stop that. If you want. This. To last.”
There was no fooling the great Sherlock Holmes. John unclenched his hand and stuffed it under his leg.
Sherlock lifted a tiny remote and pressed a button on it. A light, classical melody filled the room.
“So, I’ve studied the pattern the thieves have been following,” Sherlock said once they were inside. He grabbed John by the elbow and dragged him off in the proper direction. “They should be here in the next thirty minutes. All we have to do is wait.”
They laid there for a while, simply watching each other. They seemed to be gravitating towards one another and before John knew it, he could feel Sherlock’s warm puffs of breath ghosting across his face.
John followed Lestrade past the police tape in a haze, only a single thought running through his mind on repeat. Over and over.
When they finally pull back flushed, breathless and panting for air, Sherlock speaks. “I promise to never let you out of my sight again.”
Sherlock immediately dropped to his haunches, silver-blue eyes taking in every single detail, looking far too cheerful considering the circumstances. Then again, the man did equate murder with Christmas.
Sherlock thought to himself. Much to the dismay of a fairly irritated Mycroft, he resumed his idle staring out the window—it had far more promise of being interesting than what his brother was saying, anyhow.
“So sorry,” John said, his voice coming out an octave higher than he’d meant. “Ahem. It– it was the only thing I could think of. They’re gone now,” he added, nodding towards the lobby.
Sherlock gave a sharp nod, turning his focus back to the venomous spider on the other end of the line.
containing the meager belongings that had been on his person when he was admitted to the hospital and passed it to Mrs. Hudson.
John’s fingers went completely limp and slipped from his. His breaths stoppped. The monitor flatlined. Sherlock was shoved out of the way and the world blurred once more.
Sherlock makes John lunch—originally meant to be grilled cheese, but after a very minor kitchen fire, turns into sandwiches instead—and after the fire department leaves, Mrs. Hudson makes sure to bring them soup for dinner to avoid any further incidents.
of thunder. Out of the corner of his eye, John caught Sherlock staring at him as though he could read every line of the doctor’s face. John shut his eyes as another blinding flash lit up his bedroom, the resounding
After taking a moment to compose himself, he changes into clean clothes and makes his way downstairs, completely and utterly unprepared for the sight awaiting him: Sherlock is spread out in his chair, all gorgeous angles and long limbs, and he’s actually
Sherlock swiped at his eyes with his sleeve and looked back at John’s face. His eyes were shut, lips parted slightly in a silent gasp of pain. His chest was still bleeding profusely but more importantly, it wasn’t moving. John wasn’t
“No. Hospital. Bad. No.” Sherlock glanced up, his eyes suddenly far more alert than any drugged man’s eyes should have been, seemingly piercing directly into John’s very soul. “I wan–” Sherlock stopped and squeezed his eyes shut, his forehead wrinkling in concentration. “I wanted t’ go home. With you.”
They finally reached the flat, ending their perilous journey that was the stairs. John immediately moved to the kitchen to put the kettle on. He was cold. Colder than he’d ever been. The cold from the freezer had sunk deep into his bones and burrowed further still, into his very being and settled there, seemingly not intent on leaving anytime in the foreseeable future.
And– Oh god, John suddenly sees those three days he’d been missing for in a different light. Sherlock must have been frantic. Hysterical.
his mind told him. His bloody experiments. His chair. His bed. His memories. For the first time, John wished he could have a mind like Sherlock’s, so he could imprint their time together permanently into his mind. He’d never want to leave it.
They drove in silence, save for the occasional sniffling coming from the vicinity of John’s neck. They were nearly back to the flat when Sherlock spoke again.
“I was told to come down here,” the man said, his eyes flitting around and boring into everything they saw, his lip curled up slightly.
Tedious. Yet he gave a small nod anyways—not willing to risk moving too much in his current state—and shut his eyes, letting John’s soft voice carry him into a peaceful sleep.
Sherlock set her down in her playpen and walked away. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He wanted to shout. It was too much. Too soon. His heart far too broken and open and raw to even begin to attempt to give Rosie an explanation.
Sherlock shifts and sighs into John’s neck then smacks his lips as he wakes, rubbing the haze of sleep from his eyes. His eyes meet John’s for a moment and he gives the doctor a small, tentatively genuine smile. And then John is lost, floating in a sea of the blues and greens and silvers of Sherlock’s eyes and maybe he really will die from this love. Maybe it will burn him up, from the inside out. Take him apart piece by piece. Bit by bit. What a lovely way to go, John thinks.
His phone buzzed with a new message alert just as he left the station. The message was an address, followed by the initials
“Amazing,” John breathed, the praise slipping from his lips before he had any chance of stopping it.
Apparently that is all the motivation he needs, because he’s crawling forwards and swinging a leg across John to straddle his lap.
Martin pauses for a moment, his eyes following the trajectory of the knife before returning to meet John’s. They are cold and dark and completely
Because they are all of that. But they are also so much more. Their relationship, whatever it may be, completely transcends any and all labels. Because John Watson is not, in fact, gay—despite what seems to be popular opinion. But John Watson is indeed completely and irrevocably
“He’s somewhere in here, then?” John asked, gesturing to the freezer filled with boxes upon boxes of various ice cream treats.
It was a lovely Sunday afternoon, the warm sunlight streaming through the windows of two twenty-one b casting ornately intriguing shadows across the floor. John was lounging on the sofa, very much enjoying the book Lestrade had gifted him—‘How to Survive Your Roommate’—until he found he had a lap full of said roommate—rather, Sherlock’s head at least. John idly wondered how he did that: sneaking around the flat so quietly without that even being his objective.
“Fine.” John pried himself from Sherlock’s grasp despite the litany of complaints from the man and slipped away into the kitchen, but not before shoving the bowl of now lukewarm soup insistently closer to Sherlock on their coffee table.
“You better find it, Sherlock. Time’s running out,” Moriarty said in a sing-song voice that made Sherlock want to vomit and punch the man at the same time. Or vomit on him while punching him.
As John took a step forward with his left foot, he stretched a bit further and covered a bit more distance than Sherlock’s step back, bringing them slightly closer together. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock noticed this or not—he was the great Sherlock Holmes, of course he noticed—but the action received no protest.
With a sigh, John shifts and resigns himself to being decidedly uncomfortable for the duration of the trip home. He shifts again, his knee pressing into Sherlock’s. His left arm is presently being squished in-between his and Sherlock’s bodies, and it would be much more comfortable if he could just swing it across Sherlock’s shoulders and rest it there, but that would certainly lead to all manner of issues that he really doesn’t want to have to deal with right now. Instead, he settles for awkwardly curling his arm inwards, his hand braced against his thigh. John gazes out the window, taking in the busy streets of London in an attempt to distract himself from the uncomfortable position he’s been forced into.
Afraid of what he might do if he stayed, John stumbled backwards and up the stairs mumbling another goodnight to Sherlock, who remained seated on the couch. John could feel Sherlock’s gaze follow him all the way up the stairs.
John clenched his jaw, methodically flexing his left hand. “What,” he said, though it wasn’t really a question of any sort.
Sherlock nearly leapt out of the cab before it came to a complete stop and disappeared through the door in a wild flurry of Belstaff.
“Hold on, I’ll grab the blanket from the sofa.” John popped into the sitting room and retrieved the blanket. It was thin, but at least it would provide an extra layer of warmth for the detective.
And if he wraps his arms around Sherlock, it is merely for the practicality of comfort, and absolutely nothing more.
“Hey,” the man said softly when he realized that his eyes were slightly open. “The only emergency contact you have listed is your brother–” He squinted at a clipboard in his hand. “–Mycroft, and we can’t get ahold of him right now.”
“Sherlock?” John gasped, staring at the detective whose wide eyes indicated that he was clearly just as shocked as John was. “Jesus, I could’ve shot you.” John leaned forwards in an attempt to catch his breath.
Sherlock slumped to the floor as the masked man ran off­—the Cold-Blooded killer, they were calling him. John ran to Sherlock, dropping to his knees by his side.
Anderson stepped forwards and folded back the tarp until the body was fully visible. Even though the body was facing away from them, obscuring its face from view, the black curls were instantly recognizable. As was the long, black coat that lay limply around the body, no longer flowing gently in the wind in time with every step Sherlock took.
“Tea sounds lovely,” Sherlock said, though it came out in a garbled mumble through the thick wool of his coat.
Sherlock splashed his way over to the body, his heart pounding in his chest. He effortlessly turned the body over to discover with great relief that it was Carter. He must have hit his head when he tumbled off the edge and into the water.
“Ah. Lovely,” Sherlock said, his words still slightly slurred from the long-term effects of the drugs. “John?”
The cardiac monitor beeped a series of rapid blips before returning to a relatively rhythmical pace.
John threw on a couple of extra layers under his coat, his body still feeling the reminiscent sharpness of the icy freezer. Judging by the way Sherlock’s coat strained at the seams, he’d either just completed an extremely effective arm workout, or he’d done the same.
Sherlock shifted closer to John’s side and studied his face. He looked pale, so so pale. His face was twisted up in a contortion of pain and he was cold. So cold. That was the shock, they told him.
Lestrade was almost instantly at his side, briefly placing a hand on his arm. The action was most likely meant to be comforting, but given the situation, it only made John want to punch the detective square in the face.
John glanced down, his face heating to find that at some point in the night, Sherlock had curled up against him, his head pressed into the side of John’s stomach. One of Sherlock’s arms was slung across John’s lap, his fingers curled tightly around John’s hip, ensuring that he couldn’t move anywhere.
“Body,” Sherlock said, pointing downstream as he walked past Detective Inspector Lestrade—he was not as incompetent as the rest of them, but still utterly useless all the same.
“Sherlock?” John repeated, only to be met with a deafening silence, save for the low mechanical whirring of the freezer’s motor.
And then suddenly, the side of the bed that was behind John creaked and sunk under a weight. John rolled over, too shocked to continue pretending to be fast asleep.
John glanced at the bedside clock: nearly four in the morning. John sighed. Neither of them were going to get any sleep like this, he decided as he wrapped Sherlock into a cocoon of blankets and gently removed him from his lap, placing him back on the opposite side of the bed before slipping out of the room as quietly as possible. He made his way upstairs to collect the large blanket from his bed—it seemed they would need all the warmth they could get for the rest of the night until Sherlock’s fever hopefully broke in the morning.
He was physically going to keel over and die right there if he didn’t kiss Sherlock and touch Sherlock right about now. And then John is moving of his own accord and he’s straddling Sherlock, who lets out a surprised gasp.
“John?” Sherlock sobbed. He collapsed across John’s cold body, barely registering Mycroft ushering everyone else out of the room. Time blurred until it was no longer a thing, but a mere concept of a thing. And still Sherlock stayed by John’s side and he cried and cried and begged and cried some more. John didn’t hear him.
Footsteps echoed from the hallway, getting closer by the second. Sherlock eyed John for a moment before reminding him, “make it believable,” to which John gave a nearly imperceptible nod.
Sherlock lets out a breath, the air puffing warm and damp across John’s face. He shivers, only just realizing how cold he is. Sherlock leans in closer and–
Even though this world might not be real—might be entirely in his head—at least he had John. A best friend.
“Sherlock. I know he’s gone and you loved him very much. We all did. But you can’t bring him back. You should be ashamed of yourself.” She took Rosie on her hip and headed back downstairs, slamming the door behind her.
Instinctively, he took Sherlock’s pulse—it was faster than normal, but not alarmingly so—silently thanking God for his extensive in-combat medical training.
It wasn’t until John paid close attention to Sherlock’s slow, even breaths against his neck, and the steady rise and fall of his chest pressed against John’s side that he realized Sherlock had fallen asleep in his arms. John suppressed a soft chuckle, suddenly determined not to wake him from his sleep that was decidedly more peaceful than it had been before.
He was doing this for John. For Mrs. Hudson. For Molly. For Lestrade. For everyone. Hell, maybe even for Anderson, though the thought sent quite a conflicting, confusing pang of unnamable emotions through him.
So when Sherlock saw an opportunity to return to some form of familiar normalcy, he leapt at it headfirst.
to be anything but. John makes quick work of his clothing, tossing it onto the floor while Sherlock watches intently, his hungry eyes tracing along every plane and curve of John’s body. Sherlock’s chest is rapidly rising and falling at such an alarming rate, John is genuinely concerned that the man might actually hyperventilate.
“Ah,” Sherlock said, pulling the covers off him and swinging his long legs over the side of the bed, his head hanging unusually low.
Sherlock huffed, the heat of his breath against the crown of John’s head inexplicably warming his entire body. “Let them,” Sherlock whispered, his lips tickling John’s head as they moved against it.
Sherlock was sitting in a heap on the ground, his limbs bent at awkward angles that must have been impossibly uncomfortable, and his bed sheets were wrapped around his body, constricting his movement even further. His eyes were red and puffy, and there was evidence of tear tracks that had been hurriedly wiped away running down either cheek.
After far too long, they finally managed to catch their breath, breathing heavily and trying far too hard not to break into a brand new fit of laughter. John wiped the tears from his eyes and looked up to find the corners of Sherlock’s eyes were still delightfully crinkled, his lips curled up into one of his rare, genuine smiles—one that seemed to be reserved for John and John alone—and–
