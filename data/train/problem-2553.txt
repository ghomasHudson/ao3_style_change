"I just thought it would be fitting to have you both as archangels,  joining the other appointees I saved from the Empty."
It was a soft, chaste kiss. Their lips, both dry and a little chapped, moved against each other for what seemed like only a split second before Cas was pulling back.
Dean was moving before his brain even registered what was going on. Which was probably a good thing, because if he'd given himself any kind of warning, he would have probably flung himself out the door instead.
"You're such a little shit sometimes," Dean said, breaking eye contact and looking down at his lap, where his hands clasped and unclasped nervously.
"Sammy," he said over his shoulder, and the tall one with flannel and long hair looked back at him, "Can you brace her while I cut the belt, so she doesn't fall on her head?"
Dean nodded and looked down at his beer bottle, peeling the label to give his hands something to do.
Dean leaned down and got Cas' shirt unbuttoned and off of him, then reluctantly sat all the way back at the foot of the bed so Cas could shimmy out of his dress pants and kick them off onto the floor.
When she opened her eyes, she was standing in front of a hospital ER entrance, and Cas was no where to be seen.
With a sigh, Sam continued, "All we can do now is launch a siege against the largest congregations of monsters that we've come across. Take the fight to them." Sam held up his copy of the sheet that had been passed around. "On this sheet, you will see color-coded areas. We'll be separating into teams, with each team assigned an area by color. We're going in heavily armed with every weapon we could possibly need, as well as body cams and satellite phones."
Lizzy snorted through her nose, "Got it. Well, thanks again. If I ever see you guys again, I hope it's under better circumstances."
Once she'd collected herself again, Claire whispered, "Okay, it's not a full moon tonight so they should only be able to change if they're purebloods. And I highly doubt this bunch of rednecks are purebloods. I'll go in through the front, and you go around the back and head to the basement to rescue the victims. Hopefully they haven't been bitten, but if they have you'll just have to keep them from eating their first heart so we can try to cure them. Shit, and also somehow get the blood of the sire wolf, which I guess could be any of these idiots. Can you handle two wolves on your own?"
"Listen, Cas," Dean continued, looking back up and holding Cas' eyes. "It was seriously just luck that the Lance of Michael didn't poof you out of existence, the way it would a demon. It bought us some time, but only a handful of minutes. If it wasn't for Crowley, who just
"Yeah," Dean agreed, fidgeting and scuffing one of his boots on the shiny floor. "But around me, they seem to always go bloody, and before their time."
As he climbed into his truck, he felt a flicker of guilt. He'd promised Dean that he wouldn't do this. But then he remembered the look of peace on Dean's sleeping face, and his mind was made up.
He let Dean go to voicemail again. He knew that he'd have to face the man he loved sooner or later, but Dean had to understand that this was important. What Castiel was doing was important, because he was making the world safer. For Dean, for their broken little family, and for all humans.
"This can't be happening," he said, automatically looking up at Dean, as if waiting for his big brother to make everything okay again.
This time, Cas sighed. "Dean, you know how these things go. I can't promise not to almost die, and neither can you. It would be a promise that none of us could keep. Not just the two of us, but also Sam, Mary, or any hunter."
Patience came running and immediately saw Jody sitting on the kitchen floor, a hand over her mouth, and tears running down her face.
"Uh, Dean?" said the guy with darker hair and the stupid trenchcoat, "It just became abnormally cold, and there appears to be an apparition watching you."
It was hot, and her long hair had come out of its bun and acted like a damn blanket hanging over her, which made it even worse.
"Cas," Sam said quietly, "Please, come home. Jody, Alex, and Patience have split up and are on the run. We've reached out to all of the hunters from Apocalypse World, and asked that they do the same and keep spreading this information to their contacts until everyone knows. If you come back to the bunker, we can work on the rest together."
When Dean had the Mark of Cain, it sucked. It sucked donkey balls. Now, in retrospect, he knew that a lot of it was on him. If he hadn't been so angry all the time, if he hadn't been so weak, maybe he could have lived with it for as long as Cain himself.
With his arms resting on Cas' shoulders, and their foreheads touching, Dean murmured, "I'm glad you were my gay thing."
"I'm in the dungeon," is what he finally said. "I need you to come down here. I...I need to show you something."
"You should listen to the kid and stop yelling," Dean said, a fond smile on his face. "It's not that serious."
"As I said earlier, there are rows and rows of books here about how you die. You, specifically. But you know what's really interesting?"
After he'd gotten himself back under control, Dean reached in for the piece of paper laying, neatly folded, on top of Donna's bloody hair.
Claire shrugged. "I mean, only for an hour or so. The change took longer than that, but I only completely wolfed out for about an hour. I fought Sam and Dean, but they managed to get the cure into me anyway."
After that, prayers did come every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes it was direct, like that first one, but sometimes it was just a feeling of longing that made Castiel wish that he could punch his way out of his prison and be with Dean again. Other times, Dean would be dreaming about him, and he'd be able to pick up on feelings and scenarios that made him hard as a rock, despite his current situation. One morning, after such a dream, he received a direct prayer from Dean asking if it would be too weird to have prayer sex. He couldn't answer, of course, but Dean proceeded to take himself in hand and broadcast all of the dirty things he would do to Castiel once they could free him. Castiel finally relented on that morning, after a (frankly dumb) promise he'd made to himself to wait until he could be with Dean again, physically. He lowered his fly and pulled himself out, then stroked himself to the rhythm that Dean was broadcasting. If he let his mind wander, he could almost pretend that Dean's pants and moans were really in his ear, instead of just in his head. He could pretend that Dean was there with him.
"I needed to tell Dean something important, and since I could sense his unease about you being an angel again, I thought now would be a good time."
"That's just my Uncle Johnny," she found herself saying. "Don't worry about him, he's probably just making sure you guys aren't gonna murder me or something."
Sam knew he'd have to have a difficult talk with his brother, eventually, regarding Jack. But for now, they all needed time to mourn.
And then he pulled Cas by his tie, closing the inch or so gap between them, and their lips finally met.
The only difference between this room and many of the others was the absence of one younger brother, and the presence of one moping, fallen Angel of the Lord.
The Mark sang for revenge against whoever had killed the rest of his family, but the Ma'lak box was unmovable.
Under normal circumstances, Dean would have bristled at that. But after losing Cas and literally everyone else, he couldn't find it in his heart to care that they were finally out of options.
"Um," Jody interrupted, "I'm not trying to get in the middle of anything, but Castiel has powers that we could really use out there."
Anyway, that's how she found herself, at age 24, trapped by her seatbelt in her overturned car, somewhere in bumblefuck Kansas, after some drunk driver ran her off the road.
Cas jumped into the conversation, keeping his voice low as well. "Would Kaia have come here? And if she did, why would she come alone?"
They drove back to town together; Winchester, Winchester, and Kline. Dean chuckled to himself, thinking that they sounded like some kind of law firm, except badass.
Cas seemed to pick up what Dean was putting down, so he bent at the waist enough to shrug out of his trenchcoat and suit jacket. By the time Dean was down to his boxer-briefs, Cas had his tie off but was still struggling with his button-up.
"Dean," Cas said, resigned, as the other man ran to him, "You weren't supposed to see this. I was trying to spare you."
As she walked away, she started in on the speech she gave to everyone she managed to save, especially young people, about how they should
Sam huffed a small laugh at that and said, "I have no idea. Eternity sounds impossible, but then again I'm only human."
"Jody's in the kitchen," she said. "She hasn't left this whole time, and she won't let me or Patience see what's in the box."
Castiel started walking toward his friend, feeling the telltale threat of anxiety blooming in his chest and making his stomach drop.
"You almost did," Cas agreed, "But you didn't. You controlled yourself. I'll be able to do the same. Besides, the First Blade is gone..."
Lizzy huffed in amusement, "Sam and Dean again, huh? Sounds like they get around. Have you met the angel, too?"
There was a stretch of silence, but then she said what they'd all been afraid of since the moment she started talking.
He opened his mouth to let out a litany of verbal abuse towards Death, God, Heaven, basically everything he could think of, but Billie started speaking again before he could.
Castiel blinked rapidly, staring out through his windshield at nothing. He'd just seen Donna not too long ago. How could she be gone?
As they came closer to the location, they noticed what looked like rivers of blood flowing between the cracks of a derelict parking lot. Dean, who was walking ahead, stopped and put his arm out, signaling for everyone else to do the same.
He had remade Dean from just a damaged soul. Someone with the power to do that never should have rebelled against heaven for
"There's nothing to say," Castiel replied, not looking at Dean. "I'm going to find these vampires, and I'm going to kill every single one."
. It was hard to ignore his chemistry with Cas, the affection they both felt. Maybe it was Dean's denial, or even Castiel's, but it had always felt like a friendly, platonic love. Not romantic. Dean met Cas in the last semester of their senior year; he transferred from some private fancy private school a couple states over. Dean had been shoving the still-warm coals of a late teens crush into his pockets since they graduated nearly fifteen years ago. Just when Dean thought he had it all figured out, his feelings for Cas in particular, Lisa Braeden asked him out. It was supposed to be a one-time thing to scratch an itch of sorts.
Dean swallows thickly. He looks everywhere but at the other people in his living room, gaze settling on Cas’ hand, warm and real and reassuring in his.
. Dean vaguely registers the whoops and phrases of congratulations when he leans down slightly to kiss Castiel, grip firm on his waist.
Dean regrets the large Christmas tree Cas bullied him into getting. Kind of. The tree is large and over-the-top, probably a bit too much for their first Christmas as a couple. It’s worth it, though, seeing his bright smile, how happy it makes the man he loves. They take another half hour to finish. Sam and Eileen come home just when they finish, hands full of grocery bags.
After eating, the large group migrates to the living room, where they mainly mingle and chat amongst each other. Dean’s confused for a moment; when did they invite so many people? He sits next to Castiel, gripping his hand to fight the mounting anxiety. He’s not sure if he can do this. If he can stand in front of just about everyone he knows and ask Cas to marry him. Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, sensing his anxiety. Even without his grace, Cas knows Dean better than Dean knows himself. He gives a small smile. Dean lets go to stand up from the couch. He leads Cas to the middle of the room and takes a few deep breaths. Cas tilts his head, adorably confused. With every pair of eyes on him, Dean clears his throat before speaking. He's never been this nervous. It’s scary as hell.
of it all filled a hole in Dean's heart he didn't know existed. Kissing Cas felt like taking a deep breath of cool spring air, like the first bite of a warm slice of apple pie a la mode.
When the movie ends, Cas is asleep again, and Dean’s near to dozing off himself. It’s not particularly late; Dean’s watch reads 10:30 p.m. He doesn’t want to wake Cas. Sam and Eileen head to bed not long after, heading off toward Sam’s room together. Cas snores, clearly sleeping well.
It's quiet when Dean finishes speaking. Cas takes a moment to study Dean's face, the freckles below his beautiful green eyes and the relative smoothness of his complexion. Dean's cheeks are still faintly pink; the few moments between now and when his face went adorably red did nothing at all to mask how flustered he feels. Maybe Dean's had a crush on Cas the whole time they've known each other, since they met in high school and became inseparable since. Maybe being with Lisa helped him see that. He wasn't using her to sort out his struggles with his sexuality by any means. It just happened that being with her and getting his heart broken was what helped him see past the trauma that tormented his youth, all the denial of who he truly is. Sam's going to get a kick out of it when Dean finally tells him he's bisexual. They won't be as surprised to hear Cas was the one to make the first move, though. Dean didn't make a habit out of sweeping, romantic gestures; the few special dates he'd cooked up for Lisa ended up being the extent of Dean's romance skills. Rather pathetic, really, but he tries.
Dean's brain short circuits. He hastily types out a text back, imploring his friend to come by his apartment when the sun was actually up, when Dean might be sober enough to use his brain.
not that jerk he hooked up with once or twice in a shitty, hole-in-the-wall gay bar two hours outside Bumfuck Nowhere, Kansas.
Dean had kissed Lisa plenty of times in two-and-a-half years, but her lips could never compare to Cas', the soft pressure and overall
"I thought you'd never ask." Cas twirls one of Dean's hoodie strings around a pointer finger lazily, flopping down on the couch, imploring his companion to join him.
“You're beautiful, you know that?” Dean blushes furiously at the compliment, still not used to the kindness of a lover’s spoken word.
That one date turned into many and, soon enough, Lisa was moving into Dean's apartment. All the while, despite Dean's street smarts and repressed emotions, it had never occurred to him that Cas might have
They part several long moments later, lips kissed red and swollen slightly, acheeks tinged bright pink.
Before Cas can say anything else, Miracle comes in, the telltale pitter-patter of his paws on the hardwood floor alerting his owners. He jumps up into Dean and Cas’ laps. Cas scratches behind Miracle’s left ear the way he likes, earning an appreciative rumble back. Dean mutters something under his breath to the dog that Cas doesn’t quite catch. He’s sure Dean hadn’t meant to get so attached to Miracle, yet he diligently plays fetch with him and cuddles the dog instead of him when Cas is gone, as rare an event as that is. It’s cute, much like Dean himself. Not that Cas would ever admit that. Some sentiments ought to stay buried when they are grossly endearing.
Dean's room-well, the nightstand and dresser-stood bathed in moonlight and littered in bottles, mostly empty of the various flavors of alcohol they once held. The clock on the nightstand reads 1:30 in neon green light. Dean, meanwhile, lay on his bed, face lit by the phone screen in his hand. The room, what he can see of it in the dark, spins where he looks with his gaze changed by the whiskey. It's been a rough two months since Lisa dumped him, and a rougher two weeks since she finally moved all of her stuff out of Dean's apartment. Sam said it might take him awhile, but he's sure his big brother will be okay soon.
“Dean,” Cas sighs more than says, turning to more easily touch his lover. His hand comes up to the other man’s face, gently cupping his stubbled jaw before leaning in for a kiss.
“Tree looks good, guys,” Sam remarks, looking at the hunk of wood covered in lights and various ornaments. There’s a couch, two recliners, and a few other pieces of furniture in the room along with the TV and entertainment center. Eileen says something that Dean doesn’t catch. Cas fills him in, speaking softly into the shell of his left ear.
The night ends with the others piling into their cars for the drive back home, or else to a spare bedroom for the night. Dean stays with Cas after everyone else has left the living room. They’re seated on the couch again. Dean has an arm around the other, keeping him close. He wonders when he fell for Cas, when the moment he thought I love you for the first time was. It doesn’t really matter, now that they’re honest with each other and themselves about their feelings. Dean remembers when he bottled up his feelings, trying desperately to be someone he’s not. He remembers how awful it was when the Empty took Cas, how incomplete and like a puzzle with missing pieces he felt. Castiel is back, he’s back for good, he’s not leaving. He might need a little push sometimes, a plea to stay. Dean might need a reminder of the truth sometimes, too, but he’s finally sure of what he wants.
They know it’s not healthy to rely on each other the way they do, the way they always have. Especially when Sam went to Stanford, Dean worried about his baby brother. Dean used to wonder if a normal life would ever be in store for him and Sam, or if he could give Castiel the life deserves. He’s been thinking about it since their run-in with the Empty.
“I’m allowed a few secrets, sweetheart.” Cas ignores the way his heart flutters at his boyfriend’s--no,
Dean pushed the Lisa-related thoughts out of his mind, aimlessly scrolling through his Twitter timeline. He was still pretty new to the concept of social media. Having not grown up with it, neither Winchester brother had been much for social media. Until Sam met Eileen, that is. She was one of the reasons Sam even had an Instagram account; he mainly posted half-gross, half-cute photos or videos of himself and Eileen, or their dog. Dean's happy for them, really, but he can't help the nagging self-deprecating thoughts that spring up when he remembers his loneliness. He has friends, okay? Lisa might not be the one, but damn it if she hadn't seemed like it. In the beginning, everything was okay, until Dean realized mere months away from their three-year anniversary, with startling clarity, that he might be bisexual. The revelation was enough to drive Lisa away, though Dean was pretty confident in Lisa's lack of homophobia before he came out. He wasn't terribly surprised, at least. Maybe she was telling the truth when she claimed she's fallen out of love. That didn't stop it from hurting like hell, watching her place her key to
Honestly, Dean isn’t sure what exactly he’s doing. It’s December 24th. Christmas Eve. The house is quiet. Dean, Sam, and the others they invited agreed upon staying at Dean and Cas’ place, a reasonably sized craftsman not too far from the Men of Letters bunker. Sam went out for a grocery run with Eileen twenty minutes ago. Cas is on the couch next to Dean, head leaning on his shoulder. The shoulder that bears Cas’ handprint. He dozed off in the middle of decorating the Christmas tree. Dean doesn’t blame him. He should’ve put music or a movie or something on. The quiet makes falling asleep easier; both he and Cas went to bed late last night following their long return drive from helping a fellow hunter with some creature or other.
Cas doesn’t reply. Dean doesn’t need him to, not when he can hear the steady beat of his technically-not-one-anymore angel’s heart and feel the rise and fall of his chest with every breath. Yeah, Dean likes being the little spoon some nights.
“Will you marry me?” Cas nods immediately, breathing out a yes. Dean slides the ring on his finger, a simple silver band inlaid with a trio of stones. Engraved in the metal is a phrase they’re both familiar with:
“Nope. Come on, let’s go.” Dean stands up and grabs both of his hands. Cas doesn’t bother resisting Dean’s help in rising from the couch. He follows Dean to their bedroom, dark without the lamplight. Dean flips the switch to the nearest light fixture. Cas resists the urge to sleep fully clothed, but changes into pajamas alongside Dean, slipping into bed with him a few minutes later, letting the other hold him, face pressed to his chest. Before, when Cas was an angel, he could sense Dean’s life force in his soul. Now that he’s powerless and human once more, the sound of his lover’s heartbeat in his ear is all there is to reassure him.
“Yeah. Hang up the towel, leave the hunting to the younger generation. I’d like to spend some time with my husband, my dog, our… Kids. Claire and Jack, you know. They’re older now, and Jack’s friggin’ God, but it wouldn’t hurt to see them more often.”
Dean's lips meet Cas' in a short, sweet kiss. A chorus of angels singing plays in Dean's brain, a fitting backdrop inside to his outside.
It’s weird for Dean, having been the one to pull Castiel from the Empty, as he’d been dragged out of Hell itself. Cas is still adjusting to being human in the six months since Dean rescued him, still working out how the human body works. Like he didn’t rebuild Dean Winchester from atoms up. Like he hasn’t lived with Sam and Dean long enough.
" Cas' voice breaks up Dean's reverie, pulling him gently into the moment. Here, on the gray couch he didn't even want until Lisa bought it, in the apartment they'd shared until fairly recently. Cas sighs, waiting for Dean to come back to him. He shakes his head to clear his mind before he speaks. Cas smiles, a comforting sight in all the new-ness of their current situation.
The next morning, Dean gets up early. Miracle goes for a walk after his breakfast. Dean lets Cas sleep, gently detangling himself from the gaggle of legs and arms they’d become overnight. Dean feeds Miracle, then starts on food for his human companions. Sam and Eileen come out at about nine for coffee and breakfast, sitting at the closest table together. Dean smiles at them, happy for his little brother. Eileen treats him well, kind and gentle usually, but unafraid of calling him out if ever he messed up, which wasn’t often. As cheesy as it sounds, Dean often thought that loving Eileen made Sam better and helped him loosen his end of the codependent relationship he shares with his older brother. It was hard not to depend on each other with John Winchester’s downright abusive, neglectful parenting. The brothers would always be close, even if it took them a while to get their relationship to some form of
on the coffee table and leave, promising to return to collect her things. Dean didn't ask who'd she be staying with until she found a place, or if she already had something lined up. Those things were part of information Lisa wasn't offering. It was kind of pathetic, Dean thought, to wallow in despair after your girlfriend of nearly three years breaks up with you because she just—doesn't love you anymore. It wasn't like Dean tried to be what she said she wanted, that he loved her enough to change for her. Lisa wouldn't have that, though. Dean simply isn't what she wants, a '50s-esque hunk to come home to her. Nevermind that the pinnacle of a happy life for Dean Winchester doesn't involve a wife, kids, a large house with a white picket fence. At least, it did when he got dumped.
Maybe he just wants Dean to show him how to live, truly live, not just make do with pining away after a man he shouldn’t have even fallen for in the first place. Dean’s lucky Cas fell for him, though, what with all the times he could have left. All the times he could have said goodbye and meant it, really meant it. All the times he died or straight up left over the years, he’s always come back, some way or another. Even when the Empty took him, Dean did everything in his limited power to bring him back. It turned out that coming back to Dean cost Cas his grace. He didn’t complain at the loss, only welcomed the warm embrace Dean pulled him into when they came out of the Empty and let Dean kiss him breathless with a whispered admission of love. Cas snores loudly, interrupting Dean's rambling thoughts. He stirs, blue eyes opening slowly.
“Me neither.” Dean kisses him languidly to savor the taste of his strawberry chapstick, delighting in the way Cas smiles into the kiss. Miracle jumps off the couch when they shift to move even closer, fully making out in their living room. Dean doesn’t mind when Cas’ hands find purchase in areas of the body he knows like no other, fingertips ghosting over the warm flesh under the soft fabric of the gray hooded jacket Dean’s had for years but hardly wears anymore.
? Surely being friends for fifteen years is enough, right? Do you want to risk fucking up our friendship?"
He maps her body with his hands, slowly, like he does every day since she got back. Eileen lets him, a little smile on her face, watching his face and taking in every small movement of his. They don’t talk. They sign sometimes. They mostly soak in each other’s presence because they lost each other twice and the memories are painful.
“Our relationship was always special.” Nick laughs. “ The sex came later but we always told each other everything. Mostly we share someone. But sometimes… it grounds him I think. Sex I mean. And I want to be the one who grounds him. “ He smiles at Sam. “With help, maybe. ”
The next three hits are crashing his balls against his body. Sometimes he wonders if it’s too much, but he trusts Lilith to be careful. Last time, she stepped barefoot on his cock, but kept most of her weight on the floor when she went for his balls.
She hums, seeming to think, then she removes the wand. Her lips curl into a smile. Another slap lands on his dick. It throbs and he cries out. She doesn’t stop there. She gives him a dozen of harsh slaps that make him sob and grab the sheets so hard he’s afraid to tear them.
I'm late, I wrote a Witcher porny fic yesterday and I didn't have any inspiration left for the Kinktober. I'll try to catch back tonight !
He removes his fingers and lands a firm slap on his slit, catching the clit with the tip of his fingers. Castiel yelps and thanks him. The slaps are loud, with how wet he is and he pinches his clit every now and then. He can’t even pull on it anymore, as it’s too slippery.
Sam’s dick twitch at the sight. They’re so identical and yet very different, his brain is still confused. It’s easy to notice the differences, but when they don’t move or talk, they make a troubling image.
It’s the first time they talk without any animosity. They share a genuine smile and link their fingers. Maybe they’re gonna stop arguing. And maybe they’ll fuck in Gabriel’s bed because the little fucker deserves it.
“Oh no, I’m so sorry.” Meg shakes her head. Lucifer is still a friend of hers but he can be an insufferable bastard when he wants. She never heard of Kelly, but then, it has been some years since they haven’t talked properly.
Dean turns his face away, fists clenched. His heart is beating fast and he has a hard time keeping his breathing under control.
“You’re being so good.” Wet sounds echo in the room. “A bit of lube and I’ll fuck you. You want my knot, right ? “
They go back to kissing, deeper this time and with more force. It’s not his first kiss but he’s not very experienced and he tries his best to follow Dean’s lead. He feels a hardness against his hip. That’s a first. But strangely, it doesn’t alarm him. They begin a slow rocking motion, rubbing against each other and kissing. It’s becoming really hot under the sheets but it’s so nice that he doesn’t want to get out.
She can’t get enough of Lilith and the way she sucks on her tongue and bites her lower lip. Of her open-mouth kisses when she’s close to orgasm.
He stops. Charlie asks him what’s wrong but he can’t hear her, too shocked by the person walking towards the fighting siblings. It’s Lucifer. How lucky is that ? He even managed to make them call down. He didn’t hear what he said but they begrudgingly apologize and leave.
He can feel the rush of blood towards his dick, making the organ swell. She sucks on the head and his hips buck. Pleasure. He never felt that. He’s not sure he likes it.
He’s riding two alphas at once, who are stretching his hole with their large knots, while another is kissing him, plundering his mouth, moving with the two omegas sucking on Lucifer’s nipples. The two alphas pull out once their knots deflate, a mess of cum dripping out of his stretched hole. Two others take their place. This time, Lucifer is serviced on his back, resting on the first alpha’s chest, while the other kneels between their legs.
They sneak in the bushes, giggling like they’re teenagers at a sleepover. The spot is perfect, hidden from view and as comfortable as a garden corner can be. Which is rather comfortable actually, with the grass underneath and the brick wall for convenience.
“And there’s a proof he’s an angel ! ”  Marcus said, holding a long white feather towards the priest. Father Milton took it and examined it closely.
In the end, it had gone right. Lucifer had made a few frowny faces at some explanations, said that humans were weird, but he hadn’t said he didn’t like it. Maybe he just liked to toy with Sam too much. “Its just fascinating how your body reacts when you’re having sex. Orgasms especially. Make your brain useless. It’s ridiculous.” He had said once, then had proceeded to make Sam cum three times in an hour. Angel mojo could be brutal.
Sam warned him about his brother, telling him that he could be rude sometimes and not to take offense. There’s something raw about him, but he gave a warm welcome to Castiel and he’s friendly without being intrusive. He’s very different from his brother, but both of them are easy to be around.
“It was a joke. I was telling Benny I used to pretend I was a monster hunter when I was a child and he gifted me this.”
He climbs on the lap of an alpha, who buries strong hands in the small feathers close to his back. He pants, riding him and flapping his wings. He can feel an omega mold himself to his back, face in the right wing and slide his cock along the alpha’s. They both fuck him hard and deep, sucking on his neck and pulling lightly on his feathers. He’s soaking their legs, gushing as he cums, again and again. Demons don’t have wings, but they sure do know how to take care of them.
I'm back for Kinktober ! I made my own list this time and I'll try to do like last time, with different pairings completing the two main ones. Main ones being Destiel and Samifer. I'm gonna throw in Kelly, Meg, Lilith, and I'm also planning for John and Benny, maybe others. If you hae requests, hit me up !
“And I tell you he …” Theo made a digging gesture with his hands, then brought them in the air, along with a whistling noise. “popped from down there !”
“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”
“Yeah your hole is hungry, I know. You’re opening up so easily. I’m already three finger in and you’re sucking me in like you’re trying to eat my whole hand. ”
He leans his head on her chest and she cradles his head, stroking his hair. He feels redeemed with her, his sleep deep and undisturbed by nightmares – that hadn’t happened in years.
Dean slides his lips on his cheek, closer and closer to his mouth. He’s slow, making pauses to check Castiel’s reaction. Castiel turns his head and presses his mouth against Dean’s. They kiss a moment like that, mouths closed, small presses of lips. A hand slides in his hair, pulling him closer in the same time that Dean licks his lips. He opens his mouth and let Dean enter.
Lucifer had loudly complained about Sam’s deception, thinking it would be a one time thing. It wasn’t. Sam ate in his lap, his firm ass glued on Lucifer’s hard dick and when the long-haired put his bowl down, he had thought he would finally get an orgasm but Sam had simply got off his lap and went to their room to take his bag.
He tries. He’s trying so hard. Not to feel like he has to be that image of masculinity, like he has to use humor to squirm his way out of things, like he has to hide. He’s with Castiel. There’s no need to, because the angel would never hurt him.
There are no rules here, that dictate what you should want. Omegas fucking alphas is not frowned upon here. Sex is celebrated, and for that, there’s no hierarchy.
He shakes his head because he’s not much of a TV person and he doesn’t have the mindset to read. He turns away when Dean removes his pants and gets in the bed. It seems small in the end. Castiel slides under the sheets, shutting the light off. He can feel Dean’s presence beside him, warm and enticing. He turns in his side, trying to get comfortable.
She does and he shouts out, pressing the back of his head in the pillows. Her free hand settles on his stomach, grounding him while she sucks him in short occurrences.
“You have no idea how long I’ve dreamt of having you. But you don’t want me, do you ?” He only arches an eyebrow at her.
They stop and he pants, trying to stave off his orgasm. They busy themselves in the mean time, kissing and fingering each other. Their holes are wet, shining with lube and theirs cheeks are flushed when they turn back to him.
His last patient was Zachariah, a librarian who had chronic respiratory issues. He often forgot to wear a piece of fabric around his face when he went trough old dusty books, which didn’t help. He liked to go on rants about the decadent youth and the coming Apocalyspe.
Castiel is slumped on his chest, breathing loudly, a satisfied smile on his face. He pets his boy’s hair gently.
was new to him, and Dean had only seconds to react before the Empty started to pull Cas away from him forever.
"Whoa," Sam said, as he walked into the room and let the door close behind him. "Why's it so dark in here?"
Dean gave him a squeeze and said, "You have nothing to be sorry for. You weren't there, and you couldn't have known what would happen. This was all on me."
What would that even be, for Claire? A time before she was ten, when both of her parents were still alive? Or maybe a time after she started living with Jody and Alex? A time after she met Kaia? The rest of it...Dean knew that the rest of it, that part in the middle, didn't have any happy memories for her.
Thankfully, she was already covered in a white sheet from the Impala's trunk (you never know when you might need one for a hunter's funeral) so everyone else was spared the horror that had been done to her by those vamps.
"Hello," Jack said, raising his hand in a shy wave, as if he wasn't actually the most powerful cosmic being in existence..
It wasn't long before Cas pulled away again, just enough to speak. Dean watched the angel's eyes, saw the hope and the fear and the desire.
That gave Castiel pause. It felt like only yesterday that he and Sam were searching for Dean as a demon, desperately hoping that they could find him and cure him. They would have done anything to bring him home.
"I can do it this time," Cas finally said. "We'll have plenty of time to practice doing it the human way, later."
Dean got right up in his angel's face, brow furrowed and eyes angry. "You don't get to make that decision for me. There's been too much of that over the years, and it stops now. I hate this, and it hurts like hell, but I deserve the chance to say goodbye."
"It's something that they all say," Cas began, and Dean knew this was going to be hard, given the fact that Cas looked like he was about twenty seconds away from bolting.
Sam will never know what was said. It's not for him to know, unless his brother wants to confide in him, which he won't. So just after sunset, with the sky holding the last remnants of orange and pink, as Dean turned and walked back to the bunker without a word to anyone, Sam walked over and crouched down next to the box.
Sam and Bobby carried Patience out of the dungeon, leaving Cas behind with his sigil still on the door. They had decided that it would be best to bring the Ma'lak box to him, instead of the other way around.
Deciding that he'd teased enough, Dean reached down and placed his palm flat against the bulge in Cas' pants.
Cas returned the hug, burying his nose in Dean's neck and breathing him in. He had clearly showered recently, because he smelled like the shampoo they shared.
Dean's head hung down, his hands were clenched into fists, and his eyes were fixed on the filthy carpet when he said, "You almost died today."
Castiel squinted at him, tilting his head in that way that meant he didn't completely understand your stupid human bullshit.
Sam stood at the top of the stairs between the war room and the library, facing the handful of hunters that had gathered at the bunker.
Now that they were both down to their underwear, Dean leaned back over Cas and slotted their bodies together again. Dean gently, reverently, touched the spot on Cas' abdomen that had been pierced by the Lance of Michael, and rubbed a warm hand over the smooth skin.
And then it was over. Cas was gone, back into the void, and probably back to sleep forever, unless the Empty decided to be petty and hurt him. The thought made Dean want to vomit.
Claire slapped a hand over her own mouth again, to cover whatever noise she was about to make. She slowly removed it before saying, very quietly, "Yeah, you could say that."
"Hey," Dean said, trying to sound as upbeat as possible. "This was a no-strings-attached win, so no crying."
"I prayed to Chuck, after you...after that time. I begged him to bring you and mom back." He huffed a small laugh through his nose. "I even asked for Crowley back. But there was no answer, because of course there wasn't. I already knew how to live without mom, but I'd never had to live without you, not for any real length of time. And it turns out, I didn't want to."
Sam came back alone to heft Dean into his arms and carry him to his room. As he turned to leave, he took a look back over his shoulder at Castiel and said, "Cas, are you sure about this? We've all been responsible for mistakes and terrible accidents. Me, more than most. I know it looks
Dean kept opening and closing his mouth, at a loss for words. Nothing Billie was telling him made sense. Cas had only ever been brought back before because God, Chuck, found their story more entertaining with Cas in it. Because he was never supposed to be in it to begin with. For all Dean knew, Chuck could have been the reason that Cas' vessel was saved when the Leviathans left, and was most likely responsible for that bitch Naomi grabbing Cas from Purgatory to hack his brain. But just to come back from...from what? From where? Without Chuck involved?
"Ishim said what he did because he knows. Demons and angels alike, they know I'll always choose you. Every time, every apocalypse, I will
Cas nodded. "I did. It was the last thing I heard. And I want you to know that it would have been enough. I don't expect anything from you now that I'm back. Whatever you want to give is enough."
After criss-crossing multiple states, Jody, Alex, and Patience had made their way back to Kansas around the same time that Walt and Krissy Chambers arrived. Bobby, Charlie, Stevie, and a number of other hunters from Apocalypse World had helped to spread the word and had rolled in the night before, and Max and Alicia Banes had just arrived that morning.
Cas spun around at that and said, through gritted teeth, "The Mark is going to be an advantage. I'll be stronger, able to kill more of them."
Cas and Patience were no longer in the war room, which was kind of weird. But he'd worry about it later, when the grief wasn't so fresh. He was honestly surprised that they were holding it together as well as they were. Sobbing and dissociating notwithstanding.
He sighs happily, sinking down on the length. The slide is easy. Castiel helps him to ride him, hands on his hips and mouth in his nipples. His hole is doing squelching sounds, both from lube and Benny’s cum.
Nick is on his back, legs bent, and he looks at Sam with hungry eyes. He kisses him before guiding his dick to the waiting hole. He sinks in a tight, wet heat with a moan, echoed by Nick.
He clenches around the bottle, wondering how Hot Tall Guy’s dick looks like. Is it proportional ? Is it small and cute ? Is he cut ? He probably trims. Or shaves ? He wants to know the sound of his balls hitting his ass.
He’s very sensitive now he’s five months into his pregnancy. He craves sex all the time and the lightest touch sets him ablaze.
“He also liked to say that you and he had the same taste.” She stops, facing Meg, her head tilted in an unasked question.
Being an angel, Castiel didn’t need to eat. He didn’t particularly like it either, unlike Gabriel, who couldn’t stop gushing about his latest culinary discoveries. He had never understood why the archangel liked so much being in a human body. He mingled with humans easily, so much that Heaven had a few scares of having some nephilims running around and he often went to Earth with Balthazar. He politely accepted the plate and they ate in silence. Castiel thought humans were fascinating, but he liked better to look at them from afar. Encounters with them were mostly awkward. But he had good hope this time. He was going to get used to it.
“You have no idea how long I’ve dreamt of having you. But you don’t want me, do you ?” He only arches an eyebrow at her.
Thankfully, they also had some achievements in town that could weight in the balance. The young Alfie had become quite interested in becoming a priest, despite his young age. He was only eight, but he dutifully learned all the prayers, texts and songs, and liked to help Father in service. The old priest was thrilled to see such enthusiasm, ruffling the boy’s hair and singing his praises to his parents.
He hears the man grunt, stilling inside him and pat his ass. No, he’s not patting him. He’s pressing something into his skin.
He had been the first one to condemn Linda and her being with child out of wedlock. And he frequently refused medical treatments, claiming it was not what God would want. Noah tried his best to help him without chemicals – which disappointed him because he spent a lot of time making research and gather information from other countries. Even Father Milton was enthusiast about his progress.
“I’m alone this week. I’m gonna need a hole to fuck, so I’ll be coming back. You should prepare yourself, because I’m not gonna do it. ”
The weather was being tempered with. The dryness wasn’t natural. He understood better the reason of his presence.
Today is no exception. He has just the right way to squeeze the base of his dick and stop his orgasm.
He nearly breaks the door. It bounces back on the wall and he has to stop it from banging him in the face. His mouth drops open.
“You ready Cas ?” Dean asks in a low voice. Castiel nods and presses on the little ball in is hand that makes a squeaking noise. His safeword. “Good. Have a good night, angel.”
Lucifer is often depicted as a sex-crazed demon, father of lust or other things like that. When he and Sam got together, the human wondered. Who wouldn’t ? He had felt a bit nervous, thinking he would have to keep up with a millennia of experience.
These days, all he wants is to stuff his ass. He always liked anal fine, had been penetrated by boyfriends – he still got off thinking of Nick and his wicked hips roll – but his last girlfriend had made him dive into ass play head first. Those things certainly aren’t written all over one’s face because no one would think Kelly was into these things. He had been fooled like everyone else, before being pleasantly surprised.
He strokes it, making Castiel whimper. He doesn’t get hard anymore. It’s still good but he learned that erections weren’t mandatory to feel pleasure. His cock is still sensitive and his ass gives him more pleasure that he can hope for.
Picture a young Mark Pellegrino Lucifer. If you can't, go see BrieflyMaximumPrincess's tumblr, there are photos !
He chases his pleasure, face buried in blond hair, his waist trapped between strong legs. He spills in him, grinding until he’s totally spent. He slumps on Lucifer, enjoying the feeling of hands in his hair.
There’s movment at his left and he jumps. Hot Tall Guy sits next to him. Hot Tall Guy who’s never late and always sits in the front row. He looks like he ran here. He wonders what happened.
He can’t. He hears Dean breathing and can picture him, almost naked and so desirable. He wants to touch him so badly he aches. It’s not even sexual. He feels more of a sensual attraction, a need to snuggle against him and let his hands explore the naked skin, feel a tight embrace and hold him all night. He barely breathes, afraid to give something out.
He savors the sensation of the beard chafing his sensitive skin, that will probably will leave burns if he stays between his legs long enough. He generally does, taking his time to open him up, sliding his tongue into him before adding fingers.
with Lucifer. He can’t help it. He had heard of him before -never in good terms – and the first time he saw him up close, he was smitten. The blond gave him a nonchalant look then his blue eyes had sparked with interest. He’s not sure how they came to fuck but he’s sure not going to complain.
She strokes the length with her lips, from base to top, until he’s out of her mouth and then she does it again and again. He squeezes the hand she slid in his, his toes curling from pleasure.
Lucifer is not trying to be a rebel. But every single thing he choses is seen as weird, scandalous or wrong. He’s not doing it on purpose. To be honest, it’s annoying. Besides, people talk but he’s not doing anything to hurt anyone, so it is not justified.
She rides his fingers until she tenses and cums, with a little sound that he knows he wants to hear way more often.
“It’s not mine.” He says very quickly. Castiel arches an eyebrow. “Well, I mean, uh, it is. But I don’t, you know, use it.”
“You have to be strict. He got punished when he was bad, right omega ? A few weeks in chastity belt every time he touched his needy cunt. Mouth use only for talking back, spanking for complaining. ”
“I knew you were a dirty slut only waiting to be roughened up.” Lucifer pants, his thrusts becoming uneven. “You’re gonna swallow like a good cockslut ?”
He squirms in his seat, that he always choses in the back, so that there are less people. He bites the inside of his cheek, because
They grind against each other for a while, savouring the sliding of skin and the warmth of their embrace.
She wraps herself around him, her embrace tight and warm. It’s comforting to be with her, who looks at him and manages to see the best. She doesn’t see him as the wicked bastard most people make of him but she doesn’t think him weak either. He can relax and be himself around her, forget his father and his brother, his mistakes and his anger. She makes him better. He wants to be better for her. He knows she wants a family and he hopes he can go past his fears and maybe be a good father later. He’s ready to try.
Sam grabs his face and kisses him. Lucifer groans in his mouth, arching his back. Sam slides a hand above the stocking, caressing the unusually smooth skin. He pulls up the skirt, Lucifer’s legs coming up to encircle his waist. Fuck. He’s wearing lacy panties, the fabric stretching with his erection. He’s still not talking, and Lucifer is frowning at him.
Lucifer wraps his limbs around him, purring loudly. He always hid that ability, because it’s rare in alpha’s and never that loud. He used to be ashamed, self-harming over it in an attempt to get rid of it. It never worked and now, he embraces it. Sam loves it. Doesn’t tell him how he shoud
“Oh,I don’t want to bother you. I have to…well, see my options. But I’ll get out of your hair soon.”
He cums with a curse, pulsing inside Dean. He takes his breath, forehead on Dean’s shoulder before kissing him gently.
Sam has been distracted lately, as everyone noticed. He’s distracted at work, he’s distracted with his brother. Dean snapped and asked him what was going on but Sam kept his secret.
Castiel bends to kiss him, then curls his hand around Dean’s throbbing dick. A few strokes are enough to make him tip over the edge and he comes with violence, shaking all over.
They both look at him. For a few moments, no one moves. Then Nick comes back closer and hesitantly kisses him. Sam dives into the kiss then pulls back and turns to Lucifer. They kiss, Lucifer biting his lip until he hisses. He pulls back, and Lucifer cups Nick’s cheek before kissing him too.
His head is spinning. It hurts so good and he wants to savour the feeling but his balls are tightening and he’s been on the edge for some time already. He tries to push it back, because she hasn’t given him permission yet.
He climaxes. His ears are buzzing, his muscles clenching, semen being expulsed in waves and he thrashes in the cuffs, moaning loudly. It’s ecstasy. It’s terrifying.
He manages to agree without stammering. He leans on the door of the bathroom once he closed it. Fuck. What did he just agreed to ? He should have taken the couch. But Dean’s right, it’s tiny. On the other hand, he’s already affected enough by Dean and he’s not gonna get a wink of sleep if that man is lying next to him. Why did he have to be so sexy ?
Sam curls his hands on his hip bones and thrusts into him, meeting him halfway. Lucifer rides him with abandon, beautiful with his hair all tangled and sticking out in every direction, eyes gone dark with pleasure. He wants to kiss him but he’ll wait. For there’s a hand carefully wrapping around his throat.
Her ex-boyfriend is currently getting kissed by his new husband, getting praises for everyone. She’s glad he found the right person. She doesn’t have to like the guy. (She doesn’t hate him, but Dean has a way to get on her nerves. He’s lucky that Castiel is such a sweetheart because otherwise …)
When John suggested getting him pregnant and pretending it was Dean’s, he thought of saying no. But it kept him up at night. The idea of having John’s pup growing in his belly. So he said yes.
He’s calm, drinking and crossing his legs, lying back on the couch to look at Sam. He remembers him being handsy, impatient and bossy. But he also likes him like this. He grew up after all. People change.
He soaps himself to the thought of Dean’s smile and hard abs. He’s distracted and drops everything, from the shower gel to the shower head. It falls on his foot, of course. When he dries himself, he looks at his face in the mirror. He was already told he was a beautiful face – angelic was the term that stood out actually – but he never dwelled on it. Now he wonders. How does Dean see him ? Like any man, he guesses, so his face doesn’t matter. He should stop thinking about it.
“Cas, I’ve known you for twelve years and it’s taken me almost all of those years to get my head out of my ass and realize how I feel about you. I love you so much. Loving you has changed me. I-I can’t think of anyone else I’d rather spend my life with. If it weren’t for you, I’d still be in Hell.” Dean looks at Cas for a moment to gauge his reaction; he sees teary eyes and an expectant expression. He sucks in another breath and continues,
He likes her. Even if he huffs and pretends not to. The first time they kissed, he felt shaken. It was good. She felt safe. He rarely felt safe. She pushed past his walls and even if it doesn’t come naturally to him, he opens up to her, slowly.
His cheeks are red from humiliation but he ruts again the man’s leg, face buried in his stomach. He climaxes with a strangled cry, creaming his pants.
Sometimes he wonders if the other alphas are truly like that or if they hide it like him. He doesn’t make a show of it either but he’s not gonna let himself act likes he wants to in public.
“Or maybe you should ask Bobby to give you another kind of job at the garage. Entertaining the men waiting for their cars by giving them a hole to dump their cum into ? ”
Dean complies, and Castiel proceeds to map his body with his mouth, his kisses leaving a tingling trail in their path. He’s reached the side of his knee when Dean loses patience.
He does like it. It feels soft and pretty. His dick is barely contained by the fabric though, it’s a bit uncomfortable. But they don’t make those for men, so he took what he found.
“Can I kiss you ?” She asks, her voice low and a little bit unsteady. She’s too turned on to get a grip.
Besides, that may be a bit cliché, but Lilith is kinda the bad girl of their promotion, with her heavy make-up and her love for skipping classes and hanging out with shady people. Rumours say she is involved in drugs and illegal car races, on top of fucking her way here and there. Kelly heard a lot of things and she wonders how much of it is true. People like to make up things when they don’t know the truth.
The blond presses his lips together and buries his face in Sam’s hair. He can feel his shoulders relaxing.
Lucifer sighs once he’s in the elevator. He loosens his tie and unbuttons his vest, glad to be finally home. It’s tiring to be at social gathering for work. There’s always those useless displays of power, alphas showing off and omegas being impressed, while betas awkwardly try to find their ground. There are more omegas like Rowena now, but he hasn’t met an alpha who was a knothead yet. And he’s not changing that.
He crosses his legs, trying to look focused on what the teacher is saying. But it’s hard when the improvised toy is sitting right on his prostate, making him hard as rocks. He loves being full in public. Besides it’s more interesting than listening to Mr Walker.
“Was it Lee?” A finger slides on him and he gasps, trying to clench around it but failing because it’s too slick.
He’s alive and solid in his arms, and it still surprises him. He has still has difficulty to let him go, as if the angel were gonna disappear if he looked away.
Kelly Kline was expecting, her round belly adding to her usual glow. She was very appreciated in Lebanon, and if her husband had the official post, everyone addressed her as Mayor too. She was actually more assertive and more energetic than Nick, but she hadn’t wanted the post, for she claimed to everyone that she just wanted to be a mother. To what many people threw back that she was already the town’s mother. Nick was a quiet man, who always tried to listen to requests. But he always turned to his wife for decisions. They shared the role with balance. She often came to pray, to Father delight.
He climaxes, staining the panties and dripping on Castiel’s hand. The angel kisses then nuzzles his cheek.
Dean shakes his head, and he has to wait a few seconds to talk, because the bite he took is too big.
He feels lost. His belief in God has always been a beacon to him and he was certain of wanting to be a priest. Now he’s not sure anymore, and he’s even doubting believing in God altogether. Everyone has doubts. That’s why he was told and he knows it’s true. He had doubts before, but never like that. It’s different. He feels like he should be doing something else, that there’s another  thing calling for him. He doesn’t know what. His teachers are disappointed, even if they told him to do as he wanted. They always told him that he was one of the most promising student. He knows that he has a gift to help people, or so many people said. Is it selfish if he wants to have some time to himself ?
Crowley is finally back and with him is – Meg feels a bit hot suddenly – the most pretty girl ever. She gapes a bit before she can introduce herself. It seems going through the wedding Mass had been totally worth it.
She gently pushes Kelly against the wall and kneels on her vest, pushing up the green lacy dress. She kisses her mound through her underwear. She can feel she’s wet.
Dean takes deep and slow breathes – once again, he doesn’t have to to, it’s not his body, but not being human anymore is weird sometimes. His tongue traces the angel’s bottom lip, and Castiel opens his mouth, deepening the kiss.
John makes him lie on the bed and teases the head of his dick with small licks. Then he takes it in, sucking on the limp flesh. He sneaks a hand to Castiel’s chest to play with his nipples, making them harden and rolling them under his fingers.
Her hands slide on his back as he enters her and they rock slowly together. Her mouth is hot on his neck and he moans in pleasure as he slides in her wet heat. She smiles at him and every time she does that, there’s a pulsing inside his chest, that says
Sometimes he wonders if the other alphas are truly like that or if they hide it like him. He doesn’t make a show of it either but he’s not gonna let himself act likes he wants to in public.
He gulps and stills his legs, open to let her between them. The sheets are soft under Lucifer’s naked body, but they’re getting damp with his sweat.
“It happens that…” Nick goes on. “We share. Sometimes. And he did talk to me about you when you two met. I could describe your dick to the smallest detail. I would like to see it for real.”
“I’d like to see you use it.” Castiel finally says, his low voice gentle. He knows how Dean works. Knows that he has to push through his walls and reassure him at every turn.
Then finally, Sam pushes his cock into him. He loops his arms around his middle, holding him tight against his chest, slowly thrusting inside him.
They kiss, and she clings to him as she comes. He can’t get enough of her. He’s never had this, such a sweet, healthy relationship, but without excluding the bad parts of his life. He’s still afraid to see her disappear. She deserves so much more, he wants to give her the world.
He still wants to help. There are so many things to fight for, so many people to support. He just has the feeling that the religious institution he’s dedicated himself to is not enough anymore for him. He needs a bigger space, to see other places. Or maybe he’s tired of the hierarchy and the rules. He kept close to the progressive side of the church, because he’s convinced tradition is too oppressive. But as time goes by, he wants to keep his faith a more private thing. Or maybe he doesn’t believe anymore. He’s confused about that.
“Look at you, so pretty, so brave for me. I love you Dean. All of you. And you’re so hot with those panties. “
He pulls out and lets Lucifer take his place. The blond lowers himself to kiss his brother, tangling their bodies. They wrap around each other, their tongues rubbing together. He’s wondering if they’re putting on a show because he’s here or if they’re always like that.
“It’s not mine.” He says very quickly. Castiel arches an eyebrow. “Well, I mean, uh, it is. But I don’t, you know, use it.”
The demons obey and put their backs into it. He’s getting pounded into oblivion, slick running down his thighs and gushing out of him. His body is torn apart by violent orgasms that make him light-headed.
He can see them kiss from where he is and it turns him on a lot. He does his best to last, aiming for Lucifer’s prostate. His efforts pay, the blond getting louder and cursing and praising him. He finds a hand already working when he goes for Lucifer’s dick and he shares a smile with Nick.
He thrusts harder in the pliant body above him, throwing him Castiel around like a ragdoll. The younger man cums, his orgasm explosive and stretching with John keeping in fucking him through it. Cum dribble down in John’s belly, being milked out of Castiel forcibly.
But he adds more lube and lines up his dick before pushing in. He waits a few seconds to let Lucifer adjust. His dick is thick and the blond swears, because it’s fucking good and he doesn’t want to cum just with that. He breathes and clenches around Sam, making the other man hiss.
Kelly is his opposite. She’s full of love, she likes to get to know people and she gives so much of herself every time that he wonders how she still has something left for herself. She got under his skin, without forcing his hand but not letting him slip away.
Lucifer sighs dramatically when Dean and Bobby go in the garage talk about cars and Sam rolls his eyes at him.
He’s a bit impatient. He would have liked to draw it out more but he can’t wait. He pulls Lucifer’s pants down and nuzzles his hardening cock. Satisifed by the sharp intake of breath above him, he licks a wet stripe on the head before wetting it entirely.
He presses his mouth to hers and they kiss, hands tangled in each other’s hair – she likes her hair, never said it’s too long. She gets him like no one else ever did and he can’t believe how lucky he is that she loves him back.
The grip in his hair is painful now and the only reaction his body has is to leak more pre-cum. No one has ever used him like that and he loves it. It turns him on even more to know that Lucifer is nothing like that with his wife. She gets the cuddles and the pet names. He’s gonna be the dirty secret who gets fucked hard and quick.
When he’s home, he takes it away and caresses the bruises that mark his throat. The skin is extra-sensitive and he pokes it, making his dick twitch. Hickeys are splattered all over his shoulders, on the inside of his thighs.
It turns him on even more to know that Lucifer is nothing like that with his wife. She gets the cuddles and the pet names. He’s gonna be the dirty secret who gets fucked hard and quick.
He’s getting hot and his erection is getting harder to ignore. Hot Tall Guy gives him a little smile and there it is –
Sam sits on the bed, Lucifer in his lap. He fumbles with his pants, managing to pull his cock out. Lucifer hums in approval and grinds against him, then removes his top.
He kisses his jaw, peppering kisses on his open mouth. “I could kill you and you’d let me. Just so I can have a better orgasm.”
“I don’t want to spoil him, but I let him cum a few times a month. You’re cumming today, omega, say thank you to Benny.”
Benny nods eagerly, his dick stiffening in his pants. Castiel is a beautiful omega and a lot of alphas are jealous of Dean. Benny hasn’t found an omega he wants to keep yet and he’s happy to watch the two of them.  Dean takes the clamp between his fingers and pulls slowly. The omega whines, eyes already glassy, his empty cunt dripping on the leather couch. He doesn’t try to close his legs anymore. Every time he did, he got a brutal pussy spanking, which gave him a taste for pain and persuaded him to keep his legs open.
The crops were getting drier everyday and the general mood wasn’t good. The animals too were nervous, and that had caused some accidents. His next patient, Mrs Harvelle, had been injured by one of her cows, which had panicked in the barn for an unknown reason. She had a broken leg and she was even more grumpy than usual. He checked her leg, which was healing just right, thankfully. She also asked him about the newcomer. Everyone knew and they were all curious. It was rare to see new faces.
But she’s here, in the green skirt that show her legs and a top hugging her chest. They like to call her a slut, but truth is they’re all afraid of her. Kelly can’t help but be a bit impressed. She’s confident, so comfortable in her body, and she has a sharp tongue, not afraid to make her mind known. She doesn’t take shit from anyone.
He can’t bring himself to think rationally. Can’t think about how he’s going to sleep with Kelly’s husband behind her back. He can only think how hot Lucifer’s mouth is on him, how good it feels when they grind together.
Then there’s a tongue on his rim and a beard on his thighs. John circles his entrance, sucks lightly between strong licks. Castiel wriggles, moaning louder. He fists the sheets, rubbing himself on the older man’s tongue.
“Father Milton is too soft. If an angel is really among us, then he will re-establish the right order.”
“Yes.” He sobs, pleasure sparking in his lower belly. Sam is hitting all his sweet spots and it’s mind-blowing. “Yes, please, alpha ! ”
He has different lubes, according to what he’s feeling like. The only things is he can’t bring himself to buy proper sex toys. He could -maybe he should – but there’s something about taking a random object and stick it inside him. He doesn’t take any risk, he doesn’t want to end up in the ER of course. But he doesn’t choose his deodorants according to their sole scent anymore. He buys small cans of paint, even though he’s no artist. And yes, he buys cucumbers a bit more often than usual.
He’s nervous. Trusting people doesn’t come easily to him, all the negative experiences sticking at the back of his mind. He tends to avoid people in the street, doesn’t engage in small talk with others and doesn’t believe in true love.
Lucifer wants to be carried, because he’s a brat who needs attention of course. He missed him. Nick leads Sam by the hand until he sits on the bed, Lucifer still in his lap.
Castiel is holding a giant tentacle-shaped dildo, red and purple. He would have said it was something else, but really, it just looks like a dildo. And his boyfriend is poking it.
Hell welcomed him, giving him everything he has always been deprived of. He can do whatever he wants, he has to bow to no one and his demons would do anything for him. Like throwing giant orgies for his heats and worshipping his body for days.
Lilith slides a hand under his shirt and he wiggles to escape her touch, even if he knows it’s useless. The sensation is strange, his body taking the stimuli like a human. It’s more intense. Or maybe it’s the knowledge that she could hurt him like that.
Sam rolls his eyes and picks him up. He walks to his room and drops him on the bed before going through his drawer.
“Who wouldn’t ? “ She blurts. Then she bites her tongue, because that was probably a bit rude. “I don’t mean…sorry.”
Kelly sends a pleading look in her direction. She ignores it, turning the page she finished reading.
A few people dared to raise the issue of Dean Winchester, who had come back in town a few years ago. The poor boy had lost his mother young and their father hadn’t been much of a good father for his two sons. When he had disappeared, the youngest was barely of age. They had left to find him. Only one of them had returned. Dean had changed a lot, and his attitude wasn’t the one of the well-behaved child he could have been. He had turned to drinking, like their father and had begun many fights in bars. From what people had gathered, Sam was dead. And rumours painted Dean as his killer. A lot of rumours had followed him and it never gave him the good role. His name had become the new threat to make children behave, and young women were told not to get too close. The Winchester’s house was apart, a wooden structure in the forest, next to the lake. The family had always been a bit distant. Dean almost never came down in town. When he did, he knew he wasn’t welcome. His isolation stopped the inhabitants from giving him too much trouble. They ignored him and he ignored them, and everything was fine.
She does it again of course. Her little clit is spasming every time, and it’s so cute she wants to do that all day long.
She keeps pumping her hips, smashing their dripping slits together. His muscles spasm and he cums against her, shaking from head to toe, his dicklit twitching. She kisses his jaw, combing his hair back out of his eyes.
He can’t believe his luck. But he only has a short break for lunch. Lucifer senses his dilemma and offers his number.
“Sorry. I lied to you. It happens a lot, people mistaking me for Lucifer. And it’s not always this nice. Usually, people try to punch me in the face.”
That’s really not how he thought his day would end. He’s not gonna complain. Lucifer is already grinding on him, making his dick harden. Nick is shyer, keeping his hands in his lap.
He fumbles with his pants, letting them drop around his ankles. He turns, bending and offering his ass. Castiel kneads his cheeks, exposing his hole. He knows it’s open, wet with cum and clenching on nothing, begging to be filled.
Lebanon was a small and quiet town. It had been quite of a dark decade for the inhabitants, with the poor crops and several diseases. They were doing better, but summer was hot and dry this year again, and it didn’t bid well for the next winter. Father Milton had led many Masses to cheer everyone up and encourage them to pray and repent ; sin could lead to disasters but God was forgiving and would surely hear them. The only thing that they could do was admit their faults.
She does it again of course. Her little clit is spasming every time, and it’s so cute she wants to do that all day long. Kelly is a sobbing mess when she stops and turns the egg off.
Lucifer slumps on him and he wraps his arms around his waist, kissing his temple. They say nothing for a moment, then Lucifer speaks, his voice hesitant.
He loses the clothes as he makes his way to Sam’s lap, where he curls up, nose tucked in Sam’s scent gland. He breathes in, relaxing, while Sam strokes his back.
He knew, yes, maybe. He had hoped at least. But it was still something to hear the words from Castiel
He’s feeling light-headed, his dick dripping with pre-cum. Sam’s body is warm, strong and hard around him, keeping him in place and driving into him exactly how he likes, deep and rough. His knot is swelling, catching on his rim. He’s grateful that Sam is ready to fulfill his fantasies.
“What would you like to do ? I could use some help, if you’re interested in healing people. Can you read, by any chance?”
Telling his father he was tyrant and a paternalist prick was the truth after all. Deciding to start a strike in his middle school because a teacher had called his brother a racist slur was the only thing to do. Punching Crowley in the face because he doesn’t like the guy…was maybe a bit misguided, he can admit it. Being bisexual however, is no one’s business and is neither disgusting nor a phase.
Sam narrows his eyes and pushes Lucifer to the table, then gives him a firm spank. Lucifer yelps and tries to squirm his way out but Sam plasters himself to his back, pressing his hard-on against him and kissing his neck. Fuck.
He feels Dean – he guesses at least – pour some thick lube inside him. Another man fucks him. The cock is larger but shorter, and he kneads Castiel’s asscheeks.
She could be imagining it. But that tone ? She knew what she was answering to. Meg clears her throat and gets a bit bolder.
“Oh Sam, you are good at this. It’s good to know that those fingers are more than book holders. Come on, fuck me. “
He grabs him, pulling him by the trenchcoat. He kisses him, deep and slow. It took him so much time to do that so easily. Not to think of his own barriers. To just enjoy what he has and not be afraid to ask for he wants.
They’re both moaning and panting, the slap of skin echoing in the room. He strokes Lucifer’s dick, right on the head until the blond shouts and comes on his chest, shaking. Then he grabs his hips and thrusts in him, chasing his own orgasm, Lucifer encouraging him.
It’s a wonderful date. Meg is not fonder of kids than Crowley but she makes an exception for Jack – hopefully, he’s still be cute when he begins to talk.
When the doctor came into the room, the man was awake. He was sitting with a very straight back, hands flat on the sheets.
Lube is getting everywhere and he can’t care less. Lucifer is pliant under him, moaning and panting, cursing and calling his name. He managed to make him come a second time and is working for a third, plunging slowly in the wet heat of his angel.
Sam likes what Lucifer does to him. It’s pleasurable, ok, it’s mind-blowing, but he’s getting more and more frustrated to see how unaffected the angel is.
Lucifer tests the resistance of the cuffs, pulling again, but it only hurts more, so he stops. The chains are pretty short and he’s eagle spread on the bed, barely able to move.
He faintly feels her stroke his hair and whisper how good he was. She sits next to his head and he nuzzles her thigh, high on pleasure and pain. She takes a soothing balm on the nightstand.
Finally, the door opens on a bare-chest, short-haired man, who’s chewing on a burger he has in hand. He has never seen Sam’s brother but in photo. The image on the phone screen didn’t do him justice. He’s really handsome, and Castiel feels suddenly shy, affected by the man’s charm. He resolutely looks at his eyes, trying to ignore the muscled torso and the tattoo on it.
He doesn’t know Hot Tall Guy’s name. He has long brown hair, is always wearing flannel (it's dreadful, but his hotness gives him a free pass) and usually has a serious and focused face unless he’s smiling, making his dimples appear. Lucifer wants to eat him up and climb him like a tree.
Apparently, they chose who is the first to go. Two hands settle on his hips and his hole is breached, making him moan. The man fucks him slowly at first, then harder, making comments about his tightness.
From here, it’s a blur. Two other men fuck him then he’s left alone in the room. He can hear then laugh and drink, maybe watching football. Sometimes, one of them comes in to fuck him. More lube is added, making a puddle under his ass.
She doesn’t know when she got so close. She’s pressing Kelly against the table and her lips are inches away from her face – it’s a purple shade today.
Getting in college had been a relief. It was heaven to be away from his father and for the first time, he had a space on his own, where no one could barge in unannounced. Like, say, a little brother named Gabriel busting the door open when he was shaving his genitals. Ugh.
Sam is speechless. He’s happy to have found him. But he also really confused by the twin, Nick, who kissed him a minute ago and who’s currently watching them with a little smile.
Thankfully, Bobby comes too, which make a distraction. The old man is still a bit distrustful of him but at least he’s not antagonizing him at every turn. He hands him a beer and politely asks about his job.
Sam sneaks a hand on Nick’s chest and rubs a nub under his palm. Nick tightens around him and whines, shaking his head.
Trust Lucifer not to do things by half. He thrusts his tongue inside, like he knows the blond likes. No need to go slow, if he prepared himself, it means he wants it quick. But Sam likes to eat him out, so he draws it a bit, making out with his stretched hole, a hand stroking his dick, the other caressing the garter.
It’s not his day. Chuck and Amara are still arguing in the hall. He groans, then tries to relax his face.
It’s already a hardship to visit Sam’s brother but he usually doesn’t have a fucking hard-on that he can barely hide.
Kelly writhes on the bed but obediently keeps her legs spread and her arms above her head. She’s soaked and flushed, her breath irregular.
He doesn’t like Sam. He’s too prissy. He’s too tall. He has ridiculous eating habits. He has the muscles of a fitness model and Lucifer wants to fucking climb him like a tree. Now his tongue is in his mouth and his hands on his ass, he can admit it.
Kelly would probably like to be more like her. She’s so pretty, with her curly blond hair and her dangerous smile. Kelly is nothing like her and sometimes, when she thinks about it at night, it makes her sad. She doesn’t really know why. She doesn’t want men falling at her feet and she doesn’t want to scare people. Maybe she’s disappointed because Lilith would never want to be friends with her. That’s a weird thought and Gadreel frowned when she said that to him. A girl like Kelly shouldn’t want to be friends with a girl like Lilith.
Dean nods, kissing him on the nose, chucking when he sees the clock on the nightstand. It’s barely 10pm.
Meg takes a sip of her champagne, watching the guests laugh and eat. It’s a beautiful wedding, she has to admit. She’s not a sentimental, she didn’t cry. She just had something in her eye, probably mascara, she shouldn’t have put so much of it.
Her lips are soft and her mouth hot. She knows how to kiss, for sure. Kelly’s knees are getting weak and she timidly puts a hand on the blond’s waist. Lilith cups her face with both of her hands, deepening the kiss. When she steps back, Kelly is pretty sure her brain has turned to mush.
Since then, he hasn’t stopped. A wandering hand when Lucifer was brushing his teeth, a heated kiss before taking the wheel, a squeeze to his crotch when they got to Dean’s… He can’t think of anything else. Which is good, because Dean is little shit who still hates him and thinks he’s going to somehow be a bad influence on his baby brother, but also bad, because he’s distracted and he doesn’t want to embarrass himself in front of Mr Bi-disaster. Who still hasn’t gotten his head out of his ass and realized he’s in love with Castiel, his co-worker. It’s annoying, pathetic and infuriating, and Lucifer has other things to do than put up with Mr Daddy-issues (yes he has a lot of nicknames for Dean. No he’s not gonna admit that one also applies to him.)
He wraps a hand around Dean’s hard length, slow strokes making an orgasm build then goes faster when the human begins to moan louder. Dean comes with a strangled moan and Castiel’s name follows right away. He cradles him, stroking his hair when they’re on their sides.
It always moved him when a human showed that much deference for their Father. He was introduced to different people then, Nick, Kelly, Jodie and some of the villagers who had found him. Some were excited to come and shake his hand, whereas some stayed at distance, with some fear in their eyes.
It makes a strange feeling bloom in his chest when Lucifer says things like that. He’s scared of what it means. He can’t hope to be the only one for him, he’ll only get his heart broken. That’s why Dean would say, probably.
Sam takes pity on him. When Lucifer had went to Sam’s home and had seen the guns, all his puns about getting Sam’s winchester took another meaning. He had nagged his boyfriend until he promised to bring him one.
“I’m taking it.” Castiel concludes, packing it in his bag. He recognizes the interested twinkle in Dean’s eyes.
She doesn’t know when she got so close. She’s pressing Kelly against the table and her lips are inches away from her face – it’s a purple shade today.
The strange man thanked him and Noah went to see the Mayor. He was with Jody Mills, who was in charge of global defense of the village. No one would have ever wanted to cross her, both because she was absolutely kind and because she was so good at fighting that she could have scared anyone. Bandits never understood what was coming to them.
He often thinks of Lucifer. He had met him in a bar and he had been attracted to him immediately. Confusion had stopped him from talking to him but the blond had taken things in hands, sitting in front of Sam and bluntly asking if Jess and him were a couple. Jess had laughed and told him that no, they had dated but it was over and that she was happy to give him away as long as he was taken care of. She had winked to the blond and left them alone.
He aims for the clit, crushing it on the omega’s pelvis with his palm. Castiel is thrashing, drooling from both his mouth and cunt. His eyes are rolling back, his moans loud and desperate.  Dean smirks and presses a hand to his throat, enough to make the omega feel light-headed. He also likes to see the bruises afterwards.
“You have no idea how long I’ve dreamt of having you. But you don’t want me, do you ?” He only arches an eyebrow at her. “So disdainful of us humans. You want my help but you despise me.”
“My name is Castiel.” They shook hands. The priest had a steady flow of energy. Castiel could see he had a hard childhood, having lost his mother young. There were also very lewd thoughts in there, but nothing that could alarm him. Father Milton seemed to be a good man, sincerely worried about his parishioners.
She melts the day Lilith slides a hand in her pants, never stopping kissing her. She learns to recognize the blond’s panties only by touch, eager to put her hands under her skirts. Sometimes there’s no panties, when the skirt is longer. Because Lilith is obviously a bad influence on her, they have sex in the library. In a closet at a party. In an alley one night behind a bar.
“Cum for me Lucifer. I’ll show you how to be human. You’ll be more than an angel, more than a demon. Let me give you back what you gifted me.”
It’s better than he expected. He sinks a hand in her hair, pulling her deeper in the kiss. His hips follow her rhythm, the sliding of their pussies making a wet sound that turns him on even more. His enlarged clit catches on her small nub, and he can feel how hard she is. It makes him want to put his mouth on her too and feel her hard little clit under his tongue.
He can’t see but he can assume Dean finally got the cum lube out. It must be a sight. He groans around the gag and wiggles under the man, earning him a light spank.
He doesn’t stop. He goes as far as he can and bobs his head up and down the length, hands on the squirming hips. He’s delighted to hear Lucifer falling apart.
John smirks and speeds up, watching Castiel’s dick bounce in rhythm, the soft member slapping his belly.
They both shut up but don’t stop sending each other deadly glares. Why did he come again ? Tonight’s sex better be worth it.
The cold and hard metal sinks into him. Because Sam is a good boyfriend like that, he knew exactly which one Lucifer would like best. It’s short but thick.
Castiel likes to open him with his fingers. Sometimes they use lube, for the sake of it, sometimes they just wish it already prepared. Dean can’t be hurt anymore, but it’s nice to go through the motions. Castiel kisses him, and adds a finger, making him gasp in his mouth.
Dean grunts and eats his pie like he’s in a speed contest. Then he chokes and hits his chest a few times.
He could read and speak any languages. He recognized all the plants pictured in the book and he was amazed at the amount of information humans had gathered. Anatomy was trickier, because he didn’t know that much about humans. He could heal them with a thought, but he didn’t know how their body was made, which bone was next to which or how they reacted to diseases. He had seen the plague, but apart form that, human bodies always surprised him.
He’s alive and solid in his arms, and it still surprises him. He has still has difficulty to let him go, as if the angel were gonna disappear if he looked away.
They set a slow rhythm, trading soft kisses. Dean hugs the angel tight, nose in his hair. Castiel doesn’t need to be an angel to know he’s hiding how his eyes are watering. He gets like that sometimes, when Castiel is too soft with him. He was afraid he had broken him the first time. Now he’s glad to be allowed to witness that.
Dean threw his arms around Castiel, squeezing tightly. "I'll never move on from this, Cas. You have to know that. I may have to put you in this box today, but it's not gonna be forever. As soon as we have this monster situation handled, I'm coming to get you and we're gonna find a solution."
Lizzy thought about it for a moment. "Well, he gave me five gold dollar coins when I turned five, and I carry one around for luck."
She checked that her gun was working properly, and made sure that she had at least two more mags filled with silver bullets.
From his position on the floor, where he'd landed after Cas pushed him away to protect him (again) Dean could think of only one thing to say:
When Castiel got sent to Dean's voicemail, on all three of his phones, for the fifth time, he slammed down the payphone's receiver and retrieved his quarter.
Cas looked down at their feet for a few seconds, then looked back up at Dean. "I promise," he said. "I will protect Patience with my own life. But, Dean, if you don't come back...," he paused, and his eyes flitted to the wall behind Dean's head. He looked unfocused as he absently touched the Mark hidden underneath all of his layers before continuing, "...I don't know what I'll do."
Jack was feeling a bit tired from all of the excitement (and bacon cheeseburgers) so he announced that he would also go get a bit of sleep.
"Why would he do this?" Castiel said into the ether. It was barely a question. He knew Dean well enough, had once held his broken soul in his own hands, to know that there were many reasons he would do something so stupid and reckless.
Just as Dean opened his mouth to argue, the overhead lights started to rattle and pop. Fuses and generators blew. The entire barn shook like it was about to come down around them.
A torso with what looked like its heart ripped out, some limbs that looked like they'd been chewed on by animals, and no head to be found anywhere.
For a few tense moments, there was only static. Finally, blessedly, Dean's voice came over the line, "On our way to regroup. Over."
"No, we didn't," said Sam. "But we wanted to make sure you were okay, and we also wanted to let you know that we helped your Uncle move on."
"That's not necessary," Castiel said, looking at Dean with more intensity than usual. "I can see your soul. I know it's really you."
Sam continued, "If you look at the sheets we've prepared, we've done extensive research into where the biggest nests and packs are assembling. Many of you have helped provide this information," Sam paused and nodded toward Cas, "Including Castiel, who has been working tirelessly for almost a month trying to clear out as many monsters as he possibly could. Unfortunately, their numbers are too large and getting larger. That's why I made a call that I definitely never wanted to make...to the British Men of Letters."
It had to have been several hours before Castiel heard the rumble of the Impala. His heart started beating a bit faster in a kind of Pavlovian response that he didn't feel like dealing with at the moment.
"Anyway," he continued, "Picture a life where almost everyone you've ever loved is dead. And not only that, most of them are dead because of you. Because they loved you, but you couldn't protect them. I am so fucking tired. I've had to burn the only man who ever treated me the way a real father should treat his kids. I've had to burn an innocent girl that I loved like a sister. A prophet who was
"Dean," Cas said, keeping his tone neutral, "Be reasonable. They'll know that a monster didn't do this. These are accomplished hunters with years of experience, and some of them are experts on angel damage."
"Cas," Dean began, looking up, but still fiddling with his bottle. "This last time...I thought that was it, man. You got an angel blade through the back. There were these scorch marks on the ground, and I couldn't...that's insta-death for angels. I've seen it, hell I've
Lizzy looked around Sammy and saw her Uncle. Normally, when this happened, she just pretended that everything was fine. But considering she was still trapped in her car, which was probably totaled, and she might have a concussion, everything was already not fine.
It's Cas that pulls away after a few quick pecks, muttering a curse under his breath before speaking louder so Dean can hear, "That was worth the wait."
Charlie comes to hug Dean first, then Cas, grinning widely all the time. Dean guesses she’s as excited about the whole thing as he is, her joy present in her bright smile.
Sam and Eileen planned on staying in the bunker permanently to build a network of hunters and make the vast complex better suited for modern hunters in need, be it shelter or knowledge or whatever else. Sam in his habit of worrying is nervous about it all, but Eileen’s not; she’s sure enough in the safety of their future for both herself and Sam.
Dean, though. He’s not sure what he wants. He hasn’t talked about it with Cas at all, merely turned various ideas over and over in his mind. He’s hoping the rest of the day will go well. There’s a question that’s been sitting in the back of his mind for months. Dean wants to marry Cas, he’s sure of that much, at least. Whatever happens after... Well, he and Cas will figure something out. Together. A house with a white picket fence and a large kitchen and backyard for Miracle sounds nice.
Dean pretended to glare at them both. "I almost die and now Cas has jokes. Just put me back on the rebar, I'll wait."
With a gentle nudge, Dean tilted Cas' head slightly so he could deepen the kiss, and Cas relaxed his shoulders and wrapped both arms around Dean's waist, pulling him even closer. Dean reached up and wound his arms around Cas' neck.
The bunker was a bit overwhelming in size, so they'd been known to call each other's phones rather than walk up and down each hallway, yelling. When Castiel's phone rang, he knew it was time. Pulling it out of his pocket, he let out a relieved breath when he saw the caller I.D.
Cas looked a bit haughty as he said, "Jealousy is beneath me. It's not about who had you first, it's who has you now."
They had lost Alex, Walt, Krissy, Stevie, and a total of three other hunters from Apocalypse World that they personally didn't know that well.
The room was now completely dark, except for some outside light finding its way past some cracks in the closed curtains. It was also silent, outside of Dean's panting breaths, which were starting to come back down to normal.
Turning to face Dean, with a hundred-watt smile on his face, Jack said, "Dean Winchester, when your time on Earth is over, will you be one of my archangels?"
Castiel started the engine, then reached over to the glovebox to grab the mixtape that Dean had made for him a few years prior. With one last look around, he popped it into the tape deck and left the bunker behind.
The last prayer Castiel ever got from Dean was more of an emotional outburst than actual words. It was sheer terror mixed with the longing that Castiel now associated with himself, when Dean was missing him especially hard.
He unfolded it and read out loud, "Dear Hunter Bitches - Some folks from our pack knew some of the vamps in the nest that you destroyed, so this is payback. You see, there are a lot more of us than you, and we've all decided that it's open season on hunters. You think them killing two of yours was enough? You think this Minnesota bitch will be enough? She took out three of us, so we pulled her into three pieces. We're coming for all of you: Wolves, Vamps, Djinn, Shifters...we're all coming for you and your people. See you soon."
Sam laughed a bit and said, "Fair enough, Lizzy. Like we said, we kill monsters and save people. At least, that's the goal. We help people dealing with the supernatural, because regular people and cops can't recognize a werewolf attack or a vampire."
Dean had to stop again. Billie regarded him without malice as he took a moment to choke back the lump in his throat and blink away unshed tears.
"I love my brother. You know how much I love him. But I couldn't do this without you. I didn't want to do it without you. Sam's smart, and he's great with Jack. He would have been okay. But I wasn't ever going to be okay, not ever again. Losing you hurt every time, but there was always that small hope that you'd be back. I guess I convinced myself, after every time, that all I'd have to do is wait, and you'd come back to me. To
"Nothing," Dean assured him. "I just don't want to come yet, and I was well on my way. You're fucking awesome, man."
"Jack, there is...something I want to ask of you. And I'm sorry, I know you don't wish to interfere with Earth, but it's important to me."
He stepped down the rest of the way into the war room, and began handing out bodycams and phones marked with different colors of electrical tape.
"I'll do it," Sam said quickly, without looking at any of them. He got out of the car without taking his eyes off the house, and was already knocking on the door before any of them had a chance to react.
"I refuse to do this without you," Dean mumbled into Castiel's shoulder. "Do you hear me, you sonofabitch? I would rather be buried with you than go on without you."
Castiel's head whipped up from where he'd been sitting, perched on the edge of the bed closest to the door, reading something on Sam's tablet.
After jerking his hips up into nothing for several minutes, Cas finally growled Dean's name between kisses.
Slowly removing his hand from his mouth, and moving it up to pull at the longer hairs on top of his head, Dean's voice cracked when he said, "Cas, please tell me this wasn't you.
The taller man wrapped his arms around the angel and hugged him tighter than was strictly necessary. Castiel brought his arms up to tug at Sam's sides, returning the hug as fiercely as he could, but his brow furrowed even more in confusion as the hug went on.
"What?!" Cas snapped. "You're leaving me behind in the bunker?! You need me out there, Patience would be perfectly safe here on her own!"
Her truck was somehow still running, but other than the usual cache of weapons she carried around for work or deer hunting, there was nothing. Also, no one could find her cellphone.
"That's it," Jack confirmed. "During any down time, you'll have free reign to visit your loved ones, spend time at whatever home you desire, and enjoy your afterlife in any way you see fit."
Lizzy re-sheathed her machete on one hip, and checked that the safety was on before she holstered her gun on the other hip.
"Okay," Dean finally said, still pacing back and forth just inside the doorway. "No one else has seen her, so we need to come up with a story. She left the bunker and had a run-in with some monsters. We give her a hunter's funeral with the others." He paused for a moment and then said, his voice sounding unnaturally devoid of emotion, "Well, except for Alex. We...we couldn't get Alex."
Castiel looked at him for a long time, just a breath too long, before quietly saying, "I promise, Dean."
"Well, we both want Sam and Dean to live happy lives here on Earth. It'll be easier for Sam, because he's stopped hunting before, and he has a human lover. Dean, on the other hand...it's just a bit more complicated."
"Wrong," said Claire. "There are six. Two of them are in the basement with the victims. Did you even stake this place out first?"
Slipping by everyone who was still crying, Eileen and Cas gently placed Kaia next to her girlfriend.
Dean had experienced some very traumatic pain in his life, but being stabbed in the back by a broken piece of rebar was pretty high up on the list. If he had to guess, it had probably punctured a lung.
The bloodbath wasn't even the worst of it. Twenty vamps against the four of them, plus Cas having the Mark? Not great odds, but certainly manageable. They all survived to tell the tale.
As the nurse turned to go, she paused at the door and said, "Oh, by the way, your brothers have been waiting to see you if you're feeling up to it."
"Of course it's me," Cas said. "The Mark didn't make you have sexual relations with anyone you didn't want to, did it?"
"I doubt that, Sunshine," he said. "Although, we've had some close calls lately, so I'd better make sure you don't die."
"Dean," Sam said, in his most gentle voice, "We don't have a choice, unless you want Eileen or Cas to squeeze in there."
Dean had been traumatized in his life more times than he could possibly say, but as he sat on the floor and cried, he had the errant thought that this was probably going to be the thing that finally killed him.
"Cas!" Dean manages to say as Castiel shoves him roughly up against his own bedroom door, the nickname punched out of him as he made contact.
"That's understandable," Donna said. "Give her time and space, and she'll bounce back. You all will."
Sam walked over, and Dean could tell when his brother finally realized that something was seriously wrong.
Dean fidgeted a bit, shifting his weight from foot to foot, until finally walking over to sit next to Cas.
But as he watched Dean go, he let himself cry for his brother, too. He was already grieving the Dean from yesterday. The Dean before Cas fell to the ground, his broken wings burnt into the dirt around him. The Dean before they watched Mary get dragged back into Apocalypse World with Lucifer.
He considered, momentarily, that his conversation with Billie was just a dream. But no, it had felt too real. He also doubted he would have dreamed up Billie as the new Death.
Lizzy huffed a small laugh and rested her hand over her purse. "That's okay, I needed an upgrade anyway. I can't thank you guys enough. I mean, you don't even know me."
Short Hair started cutting the seatbelt, while Sammy situated himself under Lizzy, holding onto her shoulders so that gravity wouldn't bring her down on her head. She may already have a concussion, for all she knew, so no need to make it worse.
Tilting his head in a move that made him look just like Castiel, Jack waited for the angel to continue.
Castiel had a feeling, deep down to whatever counted as his soul, that this hunt was going to be bad. He finally let go of his carefully collected demeaner and raged and thrashed inside his metal prison. He used all of his angelic strength, plus anything extra provided by the Mark, in a desperate attempt to get out and get to Dean before it was too late.
Castiel nodded and looked down, already knowing that Dean was right. That move was right out of the Dean Winchester playbook.
Charlie had plopped down into a leather armchair and was staring off into the distance. She hadn't said a single word since they'd all regrouped on the road back to the bunker. Bobby had whispered that Charlie was thinking about dating again, because of how much she'd liked Stevie.
"Thanks, Uncle Johnny!" she yelled, sarcastically, as she continued to fight with the seatbelt. She had no idea where her purse was, it had probably flown out of one of her open windows, so she couldn't even try to grab her phone.
"Thanks, Cas," Sam said, voice thick with unshed tears. "We're gonna go ahead and lower the box now. But I swear that we'll see each other again someday."
"Then it is what it is," Dean said, already knowing that it wasn't what Cas wanted to hear. "No more God, no more miraculous resurrections. Sam and I are just like any other hunter out there now. You think Walt has an angel in his pocket?"
"My purse," she managed to say through clenched teeth, "It would be in my purse, but I lost it in the crash."
"Hey," Dean said softly, putting his hand on Cas' shoulder to make him stop for a second. "I'll go with you. But we need to be smart about this. The Mark..."
"I actually think that's my greatest regret," he said, voice thick with emotion. "Sam should have been a lawyer. The egghead would probably have his own firm by now. He'd be married, have kids, the whole thing. The apple pie life he deserved."
Later, just before dusk, Lizzy kept her word and went back to the spot where she'd left the other hunter, but Claire was gone.
Dean felt Cas' warm hand on his left cheek, and then he could suddenly breathe again. He took a shallow breath, then a more full one, and rolled himself onto his back.
"Jody, Walt, Bobby, and Krissy will be team Blue. Charlie, Stevie, Alicia, and Max will be team Yellow, with Max able to provide some magical back-up if needed. Dean, Eileen, Alex, and myself will be team Green. The rest of you are team Orange. Patience, I'd like you to stay here and concentrate on any visions that might help us. Cas will stay with you to protect you."
died for us, and even though I didn't know his plan, I still should have been able to stop him. To find another way. Because that's what we do, right? We fight, and we bleed, and we find another way. A better way. We were barely even friends and he still..."
"I know," Sam said, raising a placating hand, "But you have to understand that this is for the best. Cas can still give us plenty of help from here. He's memorized most of these lore books, so I'd definitely count on him for information in a pinch."
"Sammy," Dean said, his voice thick with emotion, "I can't tell you it's gonna be okay. I ain't gonna lie to you. But it will get easier."
Cas slapped his left hand over the mark on his right arm. It pulsed painfully, wanting revenge for Claire, Kaia, and Donna.
Lizzy was a bit perplexed, but she still needed help, and these guys seemed like they knew what they were doing.
That was all it took to send Dean over the edge. He gave one final, deep thrust, and filled Cas completely.
Lizzy practically collapsed with relief. "Thank you so much. I'm actually already in town to support my friend, so I guess I'll see you soon."
Tears began to run down Patience's face. "Alex," she said, in barely a whisper. "It was Alex. She wasn't looking. She was on the phone with me, and she wasn't looking..."
With one last look over her shoulder at Claire, Lizzy exited the woods and took the kids to her car.
The Impala pulled up just under five hours later, which suggested that Dean had broken at least a few traffic laws.
"I hate this," Castiel said as he watched Dean fly around their room, throwing supplies into a duffle bag on the bed. Dean usually packed with military precision, but there was an anxious buzz coming from him that was putting Castiel even more on edge.
Claire sighed. "Yes, but only under certain circumstances, and there's a chance it will kill them instead of cure them, but I'm here aren't I?"
Back at the bunker, Sam and Eileen immediately excused themselves to Sam's room, looking as worn down and exhausted as any other two people might look following a funeral for two teenagers who had their whole lives ahead of them, and who were like daughters to them all.
Castiel put his arms around Dean, and hid a frown in the hunter's shoulder. He knew what that particular turn of phrase usually meant.
Once they were back home and safely inside the bunker, Sam turned to the new happy couple and said, "This has been...interesting. I'm super happy for you guys, but I'm exhausted, so I'm going to bed. Just...try not to blow out all of the lights in the bunker."
There was a huge wolfpack that popped up in Stillwater, and it took all of the pull she had to keep her officers out of it. They still didn't understand why, so there was a little bit of broken trust.
"Anyway," Donna went on, "I just wanted to call while I had a minute, but I have to get back to work now. We've had some B&Es around here lately."
It had been a while since he'd gotten laid, and even longer since being with a man, but Dean figured it was like riding a bike. Especially when that bike was nearly six feet of beautiful, infuriating angel.
There is no sound in the Empty. There is just the whooshing of air from a door that he would have given anything to slam closed. If the black goo winding its way around Cas made any sound, Dean couldn't hear it. His focus, laser sharp and ringing warnings in his head, was on Cas' face.
"Let me," Dean said, and his voice sounded foreign to himself. Like whatever was happening at this moment was so important, so monumental, that he would be changed when it was over.
Cas rolled his eyes. It was part of the game they played, and he realized that he had nearly lost this when he left.
With a sigh, Castiel gave Dean one final squeeze and whispered close to his ear, "I'm sorry, Dean. I love you."
"Hey, Cas, I'm so glad you're okay," Sam said in one rushed breath. "Dean's been worried about you, you know."
At some point, she must have dozed off from heat and exhaustion, because the next thing she knew there was some crashing in the bushes around where she'd landed, and it was nearly dark.
Dean sighed and turned to the tallest of the three. "Sam, do you wanna give her the talk? She already knows about ghosts."
"Thank you, Dean," was all he said as he took Dean's right arm, and Sam took his left, and they gently pulled him away from the rebar.
Dean was unable to completely stamp down the fear rising in his chest. Living to middle-age (barely) always waiting for the other shoe to drop will do that to a person.
There was no use in delaying the inevitable. Wasn't there some kind of saying about how when it rains, it pours?
Cas huffed an annoyed breath of air out of his nose, which he only did when he was reaching the end of his patience; usually with Dean. In fact, almost exclusively with Dean.
After a beat of silence, Dean said, "So when I croak, I go up to Heaven 4.0 and just help you with Heaven Business? That's it?"
! He's just learned how to float a pencil, and he only woke you up by accident! How were any of us supposed to know what he's capable of?!" yelled Sam.
"I'm tired," he finally said, voice rough. "Do you have any idea how hard it is to wake up every day and choose life, when your life has been a living hell since you were four years old? But I always told myself that I had to stay alive, because I had a purpose. At first, it was that I had to protect Sammy, and I ended up raising him. And I don't regret that, not for a single second. Hell, Sam is probably the best thing I've ever done. Then, I had to follow in my old man's footsteps. I had to stay alive for him, especially after Sam left. I had to do everything he said; I was expected to have his back and kill whatever he pointed me at. Then dad was gone, and I had to stay alive to save people, and keep a closer eye on my brother. Without dad, there was one less hunter out in the world killing all those evil sons-of-bitches, so I had to step up. I pulled Sammy back into the life, completely."
Eventually, his very human and now fully functional lungs required air, so Dean had to reluctantly pull away.
Dean had to push it down so far that it choked him. The pounding of his heart didn't matter. The bile trying to bubble up in his throat didn't matter. The only thing that he could allow to matter was any plan at all that would help them defeat Chuck.
"Come on, Jack!" Dean called over his shoulder. "When we get back to the bunker, we can celebrate! We'll get you a nice recliner and a big screen TV for your room..."
Castiel sighed, hugging Dean back just as tightly, breathing in his scent and memorizing the shape of his body for what may be the last time. Castiel was no stranger to desperation, but he had given up entire armies for the man in his arms, so there was no way he was going to stand for more of his self-sacrificing bullshit. It was clear to him that if he could lose control to the point of killing an innocent girl - a friend and fellow hunter - he could and would lose control until he eventually killed everyone he'd ever loved. Including Dean.
He choked a bit on the nickname, which made Castiel smile with a happiness that was rare for him. Dean wanted to see it all the time.
Sam smiled at the scene, then turned around and started walking back to the Impala with Dean and Miracle.
His phone buzzed again immediately, and he ignored it again, climbing back into his truck and getting ready to head out to the next town.
Finally, Claire straightened up again and said, "Yeah, I know him. He was just at my house for dinner the other night. Wait, did you just compare me to Dean? I'm insulted."
Cas gave him a patient smile and said, "All I want is for you to live a long and happy life. I'll stay by your side for as long as you'll allow it. And if you want to get married, I'm not opposed to that."
When the car pulled up and stopped, he squinted at it in confusion. There was only one person seated inside, and that person cut a tall silhouette with long, shaggy hair.
"Ew, Gadreel?" Dean said with a grimace. "And Anna? Nice girl, er, angel. But I hope that won't be weird."
When she was 8, her Uncle suddenly died, and she started seeing him everywhere. He'd move things around the house, but he could be more destructive than that, like when he pulled their mailbox straight out of the ground and threw it into a ditch.
When his lips landed on Cas', the angel didn't immediately kiss him back. He seemed frozen, just for a moment, before he registered what was happening. When he finally started moving his lips against Dean's, it was the eruption of a decade's worth of silent pining and unresolved sexual tension.
Lizzy looked between Claire and the two young children, a brother and sister, who were obviously traumatized.
Dean started violently shaking his head, "No, Cas. No. You have always been the best of those sons of bitches."
"Please don't make me do this, Cas," he said, his voice thick with emotion, "Please don't make me lose you, too."
"I mean...if you even cared to be with me that long. Shit, we haven't even talked about the love confessions or the kissing, and I'm acting like we're getting married."
Dean moved his other hand up to his hair as he began pacing, and Castiel feared that the love of his life was about to have a full nervous breakdown. He'd seen Dean's soul in hell, after decades on the rack, and he'd swear that this was worse.
If you'd asked Dean just a few seconds ago if he had a possessiveness kink, he would have laughed and said hell no. Now? He swallowed thickly and tried to think about baseball, because the thought of Cas
"What?" Cas says before attacking Dean's jaw and neck with lips and teeth, while holding Dean's wrists above his head.
"Don't apologize," Dean said, though he wouldn't take his eyes off the table. "You've been busy, I get it. It's just...now we can't grow old together."
At that, Claire slapped a hand over her own mouth and doubled over, letting out a series of snorts through her nose.
"Cas!" she exclaimed and practically jumped on the angel, wrapping her arms around his shoulders from behind.
He skidded to a halt just outside the open door to the dungeon, and saw Castiel stepping into the Ma'lak box that he'd insisted Dean make in case this happened.
He heard Cas chuckle a bit at that before saying, "You Winchesters, and your family, and the family we made...you're the best of them. As long as there's a Winchester alive, there's still hope."
"Dean," Cas began, in a tone more gentle than usual, "I'm actually safer than most. I can usually heal myself, and others; and even when I can't, there's still a good chance I'll pull through. I'm not without my grace, you know."
Sticking the quarter back into the slot, probably harder than was strictly necessary, he dialed Sam.
"Werewolves. But there's more. The monsters are working together now. Wolves, vamps, shifters...all of them. And they're gunning for hunters. We're no longer a clean-up crew, man. We have to go on the offensive."
Castiel's face softened at that. "You're right," he said. "I'm sorry, Dean. But the sooner we get this over with, the faster we can move on from it."
Once he felt he could go on without breaking down, he looked back up at Castiel. The angel had a patient smile, and Dean knew that Cas would never rush him. Not with this.
Taking a single step closer, Billie said, "When I became Death, it came with more than just the burdens you'd expect. It made me aware of a bigger picture. It gave me clarity. Unfortunately, you and your brother are important. You have work to do."
"I know, Sam," Castiel said, keeping his tone even, "And for that, I'm sorry. You can add it to the list of my transgressions if you must, but I have to go into that Ma'lak box soon, before I can hurt anyone else."
