They got a table and settled down, and Dean took yet another deep breath, trying to calm his nerves.
Dean and Sam helped set the table while Cas got all the food out and they all sat down. “How was your day, Sam?” Cas asked with a listening ear and Dean couldn’t help but smile as he watched them interact. It was like they were the family that Dean and Sam never got. They laughed and ate and just enjoyed each other’s company because honestly, they were all they had.
“W-what… what can I get you guys to eat?” She finally said, just ignoring the whole question together. Cas suspiciously looked back at Dean, and he sighed, knowing that that was all he was going to get out of her.
“Get this off.” Cas practically demanded, and Dean followed suit, looking at Cas with wide eyes. Dean was breathing heavily, everywhere that Cas touched tingled like fire. Once Dean’s shirt was off, Cas brought them together, bare chests touching. Dean gasped in air as their skin met, and his blood boiled underneath his skin.
When Dean and Bobby walked into the room they were met with Ellen, Jo, and Garth crowded around one laptop. The look on their faces told him that absolutely nothing good was going to come from this night. He wouldn’t be surprised if he were covered in bruises and cuts tomorrow morning.
Dean put his head on the steering wheel, taking in a deep breath. He took a second to let the tears run down his face, the tears that had been threatening to come out since his dad had walked into the kitchen. He silently sobbed, trying not to wake Sam up in the back. He took a deep, labored breath, and then got himself together. He wiped his tears, wiped his nose, and gave himself a mini-pep talk.
School went by without any more incidences. No shady demons, no soul mate interruptions, no calls from Bobby, no calls from Sammy’s school, and a nice calm lunch with his friends. Dean was feeling good. He had a lot of things lined up in his life right now and everything seemed to be playing out in a way that was actually going to work out.
“I’m fine, Bobby. Cas is…” Dean trailed off, wondering how on earth he was going to explain it. “Fine. Cas is fine. I’ll explain more of it to you guys when I see you. Meet at the Diner tonight?” Bobby grunted, and Dean could almost see his face.
“His wrist says what?!” Charlie hissed, grabbing Dean tightly by the arm. “It says DW!! Why is my life so shitty?!” Dean yelled, hitting his face. It was the end of the day, and they were walking back out to the parking lot together.
“Sam what would you think about coming to live here with your dad?” Cas asked gently, treading lightly due to the riskiness of the question. Sam looked up, confused. “We live here already?” Dean and Cas knowingly looked at each other, and Dean smiled. “I guess that’s a yes.”
He decided to grab the clothes that lay next to the spot he was just asleep and quickly change, getting out of his jeans and sweaty t-shirt. He drank from the cup of water that was left on the bed side table, not caring if it was old or new.
Dean couldn’t even watch Castiel’s face anymore. He grabbed his backpack and bolted to the door.
“I-I’m sorry, Cas I just-” Cas shushed him softly. “It’s okay, Dean. Are you okay?” Cas asked, and Dean shrugged. “I-I dunno… I haven’t had a nightmare like that in awhile. I guess it’s just nerves from graduation coming up.” Cas rubbed his shoulders. “What was it about?” A shiver went up Dean’s back.
“He does not mean to use it for bad. He’s scared of it, scared of angels, scared of us. If I healed him, something I so desperately want to do because he is beyond hurt, he would freak out. If he even suspected I was a nephilim,” Does he even know what a nephilim is? Cas asked himself. “He would run away. I’m so scared of that. What if he runs away, Gabriel?” Castiel asked, voice quiet and subdued.
“My mom is a human. My father is…” Cas trailed off, trying to put things more delicately. He wasn’t gonna get there, though. “Well, he’s an angel. They gave birth to four kids, and we’re all nephilims.”
“I-I… I just-” “Don’t you dare ever think that!” Cas hissed putting his arms on either side of Dean’s body and pushing him against the wall. “Why would you even think that about yourself, Dean?!” He sounded angry, but Dean thought it didn’t quite sound the angry that his father would get. There was so much concern and worry and it made Dean dizzy with confusion and warmth. “You’re amazing, Dean! You’re smart and you’re one of the best father's I have ever seen and you’re cute and your freckles make me want to ki-” Cas suddenly cut himself off, shaking his head. He probably shouldn’t have said that.
“Hey, you’re the one who slept for two hours last night. I think you need a nap.” Cas laughed and brought Dean back to his bedroom.
Thinking about that was difficult, though, so he put it on the back burner. He could worry when he got home. Maybe touch up his sigils, add a couple, put more salt around the door, whatever. And, a lot of worse things could have happened when he was sleeping. He just didn’t know what type of creature could spontaneously heal someone. At least he wasn’t killed in the middle of the night.
“And Dean, I swear you make me wanna scream you’re so hurt and all I want to do is help you and be with you-” That was all Dean heard, and that was all it took for him to lose control of his thoughts. The next thing they knew, Dean leaned up and pressed his lips to Cas’s.
“That sounds like an excellent idea. We can talk about everything tomorrow.”
“We can talk about this later. Just tell me about the good things.” Cas smiled.
“Hi Sammy,” Bobby’s gruff voice never really got the hang of the whole baby talking thing, but Sam didn’t mind. Dean smiled, relishing the moment of peace. Then Ellen and Jo came out with dinner and they all sat down and Dean realized that even if he didn’t have a dad, he still had a family.
Dean nodded into Cas’s shoulder.
“Hey son,” Dean felt an odd settle in his stomach when he heard Bobby call him son. “Hey Ellen!” Bobby called out and there was a faint response from the kitchen, but they weren’t too bothered to actually listen.
He shrugged, not looking too far into it. It was way too early for him to think about things like that. Then again, he couldn’t really think anything was weird with how his life was going right now. So, he ignored it and got up to get ready for the day.
Dean pulled back slightly, feeling Cas pull in a deep breath as he opened his eyes. “We shouldn’t-” Cas shook his head, pressing his lips against Dean’s again. “I know.” He whispered out, still leaning forward and repeatedly brushing his lips across Dean mouth. Dean opened his eyes and looked up at Cas’s eyes. “You…” Cas pulled back to listen, with his arms still wrapped around Dean’s waist. “You aren’t mad?” Dean’s voice was soft and cautious, and Cas furrowed his eyebrows. “Why would I be mad?” He asked gently, moving his hands up Dean’s back to the back of his head. “Well, because I…” Dean trailed off and blushed a deep red color, and Cas almost cooed at how cute it was. “I kissed you.” Dean’s voice dropped about three decibels and Cas was lucky he even heard.
“Hi Misser Novak.” Cas’s heart melted. “Hi Sam…” Dean walked out of the room. “What was your nightmare about?” He shouldn’t have asked, he really shouldn’t have, but one, he was beyond concerned about Dean and Sam’s welfare and two, he just wanted to know about Dean. “John.” Sam spoke quietly, getting up and crawling on to Mr. Novak’s lap. He was stunned for a blunt second, but then he quickly recovered. Cas remembered Gabe mentioning something about John, and his stomach drawled in. “Wha-”
Dean’s heart caught in his throat. Sam being a priority of anyone made his thoughts stutter to a stop. This was it for Cas, the way he was talking. Utmost priority: Dean had never been someone’s utmost priority. Not even his father’s.
He needed to go in there. If Cas found him there in the morning, he would be so upset. It would just be better if he went in now and said that dinner had ended early and that he wanted to be with him. That would be a little out of the ordinary, but it would be better than what actually happened.
Dean thought for a second, wondering if he missed anything. “But he didn’t say anything at all about the monsters.”
“Food.” Cas moaned, feeling Dean’s hunger. He was surprised Dean was not skinnier by how much he didn’t eat. “So hungry, Dean. Not nearly enough food for you. You need to eat.” Dean nodded.
“Daddy!” Sam shouted and was in Dean’s arms in about three seconds, and Dean laughed softly. “Hey bud, how was your day?” Sam launched into a whole energetic conversation that Dean just didn’t have the mind to listen to today. As he made his way back to the car, his thoughts ran from John to Sam to Mr. Novak and Dean couldn’t quite tell which emotion was coming from where. Dean muttered a ‘yeah, cool Sammy,’ as he buckled Sam into the car and shut the door, quickly running to go get in the drivers seat and make it to work.
“I…” His head spun and he was suddenly on the ground, everyone surrounding him. “Dean!” He heard over and over again, but the voice was too far away for him to even understand it.
Dean woke up to a ringing phone, displeased with the shrill noise cutting through his sleep. He chose to forget about it and try to close his eyes, but he was too awake now. He sat up in bed, confused, when everything seemed a little bit different. He remembered a dream he had last night where Cas came and saved him from John, but everything felt so real. He could almost feel Cas under his fingertips.
“Yeah?” Cas whispered, grabbing the back of Dean’s head and gently guiding him back down to the pillow. Dean followed without any hesitation.
“You’re kidding. You’re joking, Dean. Angels don’t exist. They’re just… folklore-”
Breakfast… well, more like lunch, was amazing. Dean hadn’t had a homemade breakfast like that in forever. Sam was so happy, and Cas had “slipped him” extra chocolate chips. Sam had been up since 8, and Cas got up with him. They spent the morning playing with the bag of toys Dean had brought to Charlie’s the night before, eating granola bars, and then they started to cook breakfast for Dean. Dean liked seeing them together, but it was scary. It was uncomfortably scary. Around 3, after they’d watched a movie and a couple of tv shows, Sam was sleepy enough that Dean could put him down for a nap without any problems.
Then he saw the diner. Saw him in his uniform, saw Sammy asleep, and then suddenly saw Ellen coming in. He saw the whole scene play out in his head, saw Dean hide from his father, saw all the things Dean imagined John was going to do with him, and then saw him get in his car. He saw him sob in his driveway. He felt Dean think that he was a burden, that he was going to
Dean turned to his angel and did kiss him. He moved his hands onto Castiel’s cheeks. The angel laughed as he tugged on Dean’s jacket and brought him even closer.
“I have to,” He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Castiel’s smile didn’t leave, “I’m sorry, Dean. I’ve caused you so much pain for the last decade,” he laughed, “The last few years with you, with Sam and Jack, have been the best years of my life. I was an angel of the lord, always following orders. But you taught me freewill. And we made a difference.” There were tears in his eyes, “You never gave up, in the face of the devil and god. Stay strong, Dean, for me.”  Dean's green eyes were filled with tears and he didn’t bother wiping them away. He was falling apart. Dean stood there speechless in front of Cas. “Don’t cry.” This was the first time Castiel saw him hurting. Cas smiled, as he wiped away Dean’s tears.
“Okay,” Sam replied, “But if you need a break, just ask.”
“Well, it’s still morning, so we could stay in bed a little longer,” Cas asked with puppy dog eyes.
Sam chuckled, “Dean, you sound really drunk.” Eileen laughed as she held Sam’s hand. Sam noticed something yellow and fluffy underneath the table. “You kept the dog?”
“She’s alive.”
“Cas!” He woke up to Dean urgently shouting his name.
He rolled over, thinking about him. Cas was always there for him, his guardian angel. Sometimes Dean found it annoying but he knew that nothing bad would happen because he was protected.
“You’re just too damn stubborn to accept that you love someone!”
“No!” Dean  yelled as he ran after Castiel, but the angel pushed him away, knowing that he would try to save him, leaving a bloody handprint on Dean’s jacket. He watched the darkness grab the man he loved and in a blink of  an eye, Castiel was gone.
He picked up the angel’s head and laid him on his lap. Jack, Sam and Eileen rushed over to Dean and Cas. “Jack! What’s wrong with him.” Dean was worrying about Cas.
Of course. Dean said, “Yeah what about last night? About how you carried me like a baby to my room?” Dean asked.
“You guys just arrived?” Sam said as they got out of their car.
The angel tried to speak, “I wanted to talk to you about last night.”
Once they pulled up to the motel, Dean dropped off their bags and then they headed to the police department to gather information about the killings.
Cas knew that Dean put up walls, he guarded himself and those walls came crashing down when he was drunk. It was like he  could see the real Dean without the masculine exterior. The angel so desperately wanted to know if the hunter actually felt the same way. But he would never admit it even if he did, that was just the type of person he was.
“Because it won’t end well, Cas!” Dean yelled back “Everything felt so real, what I said…what I felt...what I thought about doing to you! I will not admit these feelings in the hope that they would go away!”
Castiel turned red when he heard the Winchester say those words. He was at a loss of words. When Cas said that, he thought that he was going to die, he confessed his love for Dean. Not as a brother but someone more. Dean probably thinks that he meant it as just a friend.
“Whatever, man,” Dean said as he turned around and prepared his weapons for a hunt. Please, forgive me, Cas. I’m sorry for hurting you like this. You don’t deserve me.
“I-” Cas tried to say, “It’s nothing.” Dean could tell that Cas was hurting and he felt the slightest bit guilty.
“That felt good,” Castiel said as they headed back to the motel.
Sam knew that something was amiss with Dean. He knew that Cas and Dean had a profound bond, because he was the one who raised him from hell. But just seeing his brother like this, made him worry.
They both got out of the car and turned around to greet Sam and Eileen.
“Eileen. She’s-”  Sam asked,
Dean carried his angel inside the bunker and let him rest on the couch. He stayed silent as Jack and Sam talked about what would happen next. He really didn’t know what to say. His angel was no longer an angel, he was human and that was something that Dean could not grasp the idea of.
“Wait, that’s not right,” Jack said as he lifted his hand above Castiel’s head.
“What?” Dean asked from his corner as he was busy cleaning his gun.
“Because it is. I love you.”
“Yeah, now,” the hunter said as he got up and went to put his clothes on.
“Fuck!” Dean cried, “I couldn’t save him.”  He put his hands on his head, trying to hold it together. Without his angel, there was no hope in defeating Chuck. There was no hope left in his world. The one person who meant everything to him, other than Sam, was gone.
“Yes.” Jack smiled.
“Stop that,” Dean said, clearly embarrassed.
“No need to thank me, Cas.”  Jack responded.
“Well, you going to say anything, man?” Dean asked.
“So everyone’s back, Jack?”  Dean asked. As he looked around at all the people that appeared.
Cas didn’t know what to do or how to react to Dean’s actions. Then Dean pushed him away, “Well anyway, I’m tired.” He said. He let himself fall back onto the bed and turned away from Cas. “Night, Cas.”
“Go on without us. We ummm got stuck in traffic.” Dean lied. And Cas just looked at him, confused as to why he lied. “Bye and stay safe, Sammy.”  He hung up the phone and got up from the bed. “Alright, now we’re leaving.”  Dean said as picked up his bags.
He figured that he’d just pretend that he didn’t remember what had happened last night. He clearly remembered everything, every action, every feeling.  He remembered how red he and Cas were, and it wasn’t because he was drunk, he remembered staring at his lips, thinking about moving in and touching them with his own.
“He made us stop for pie,” Castiel said and Dean gave him a smile and Sam laughed.
“Dean,” Castiel said as he tried to find his balance. Dean went over to him and helped him get up. Castiel turned to Jack, “Thank you.”
“ I don’t know what came over me. I usually don’t fall asleep like this.”  The angel replied.
“What?” Dean asked.
“Cas.”
“You have anything to say?” Cas asked.
Cas’s smile didn’t disappear, “What?”
Dean seemed concerned about Cas, “You good? You need an angel doctor or something?”
“You sure you okay?”
Okay, I did not expect that.” Castiel said in his usually monotone voice.
“Why’d you lie to Sam?” Cas asked as he finally got up and put his clothes on.
It must have been hours, they all drank and talked, for once not having to worry about the chaos in the world. Dean said, “I’m gonna -hic- head in now,” he pushed his chair out but stumbled a little.
Castiel laughed, “I’m good,” he said as he rested his arm on the window and stared out into the darkness. It reminded him of the empty. Living out horrible memories, being alone.
“Okay.” Dean said, sternly and he sat up straight and looked at Cas, “What the hell is wrong with you? And don’t give me that bullcrap that you’re fine because after a decade of knowing you, I know when you’re lying.”
Dean awoke to the sound of Castiel snoring. He smiled at his partner, now realizing how pretty he was, he brushed Cas’s hair out of his face. Then it hit him. He fucked an angel. This wasn’t just a one night stand that he could just run away from. He just fucked his closest partner.
He opened the laptop and decided to take his mind off of Dean by searching for cases that he could do. He found a case about children being abducted and leaving a trail of bodies drained of blood, most likely vamps.
Dean was already at the top of the stairs with his bags full of clothes and weapons, when he called out to Castiel. “What are you waiting for, Cas? Let’s get going.”
Dean needed to ask Jack, the new god. “Cas. Can you bring him back?”
“Cas, don’t do this,” Dean whispered, “Please don’t.”  Dean never showed when he was hurting, he wanted to seem stronger. But, Cas knew, he saw it. The sadness. There was loud pounding on the door outside, Death was coming.
Dean waited until Cas left, and loudly sighed. Fuck. Most of the time when Dean drinks, he’s careful and doesn’t let any of his secrets spill. But, last night he fucked up. He told Cas that he loved him.
Jack said, “Yeah. He’s no longer an angel.”
He smiled when he saw the angel in his trench coat laying on the floor, “Ow” he mumbled.
Castiel smiled as he felt the hunter’s warm lips touch his. “I know.” They kept kissing and lost track of time. Until Dean’s phone rang which startled them both.
Cas woke the next morning and found himself in the guest room of the bunker. Angels don’t need to sleep but Cas slept anyway. He would stay up all night thinking about what Dean said to him ‘I know how you meant it, angel’. His first thought was Dean.
“You think you’re the only one to know if I’m lying? Why do you keep burying this, Dean!?” Cas was practically shouting. “Why do you keep lying, not only to me but yourself!?”
“Hm? No, I didn’t. What did you say?”
Dean knew where this was going and he did not want to go there. He didn’t want to admit that he cared too much. “Just that I wasted so much tears. Not that you weren’t worth it but I shoulda known you were coming back,” Dean gave an innocent smile that pushed Castiel away. “Why?”
“ We don’t have to tell him,” Cas said, thinking about what Dean had said earlier.
“Nothing seems to be wrong with him.” Jack said.
The angel smiled. “It’s nothing, Dean.” When they had revealed all of themselves to each other, the hunter leaned into the angel’s face and passionately kissed his lips. The angel kissed back as he slid his hands across his body to Dean’s ass and gripped it. He was a moaning mess and the hunter laughed, which made the angel turn red.
Castiel laughed at the thought and Dean asked, “What? Do I have something on my face?”
Dean smiled, “Let’s go home.”
“Nevermind,” Cas sounded disappointed.
Dean knew deep down that he loved Cas, but he refused to accept his own feelings. He wasn’t gay, was he? He had loved women before, Jo, Lisa, Cassie. But those relationships never worked out because of the family business, or that’s what he let himself believe. Cas was also an angel! How could he fall in love with an angel!? A human and an angel, it wouldn’t work out anyway. So Dean decided he should bury all feelings he had towards Cas and just pretend that nothing happened and nothing will happen.
“I- Okay.” Cas said as he turned around. He decided to wait until later to ask him.
“Yeah it's better to not be alone. Eileen and I will hold down the fort,” he smiled as he finally took his eyes off his book and looked at Eileen, she smiled. “Both of you stay safe.”
“Hey, get off my angel,” Dean said he pushed Sam away and hugged Castiel, his face, red. Both Sam and Cas laughed at drunk Dean.
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you.” Cas’s voice started to break, “ I care about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
“What? I’m making you feel too good?”
“I said, you need to get some rest. You’ve been sitting here just staring at him for over an hour.”
“Wait what?” Sam asked, “You sure?”
He passed Sam and Eileen eating and reading in the kitchen and said hello. They acknowledged that he was there but didn’t say anything back.
They heard a car pull up behind them and looked. It was Sam and Eileen. Dean pulled away from Castiel and the angel could tell that Dean was embarrassed.
Jack held up his hand and to check on Castiel to see what was wrong.
As Dean was doing that, he moved his lips to the angel’s neck. Castiel felt the nice warm touches on his neck. Cas, then started to take off Dean's clothes, first his leather jacket, then his flannel, and lastly his shirt. As he removed all the layers from the hunter, he could feel Dean’s wall starting to crumble and he could see who the Winchester really was.
“Stop making me want to kiss you right now.”
“Come on, Cas. Let me go,” he said as he tried to pry him off. “We should head back to the bunker.”
Cas laughed, “Then kiss me, Dean.”
Cas yelled, to notify the others that he was going on a hunt, “Found a probable Vamp case. I’ll be back soon,” he said as he closed the laptop.
“That’s not what I meant, Cas,” he nudged him, “like emotionally, are you okay?”
For now, he focused on driving, trying not to think about Cas. He does not like Cas in that way, that’s what he kept telling himself during the whole car ride.
“So you do remember!”
“No. I said I’m not leaving,” Dean said sternly without looking back at his baby brother.
It took a minute for what just happened to register to Cas. Then he responded, “Night, Dean.”
“Yeah,” Dean tried to hide his emotions but the angel saw right through him. “I love you, Cas. I finally admitted it, I’m not drunk this time. You happy?” Dean said, “So yeah I can’t just admit that to my baby brother.”
“What do you want to do when we wake up? We have the whole day.” Cas asked Dean, and Dean thought for a second,
“Hi guys.” Dean’s voice was small. Ellen gave him an expectant look.
“Dean,” Castiel greeted, and Dean shyly smiled towards the ground.
And then Dean was alone, standing in the middle of a crossroad, more than confused.
He had looked at way too many books and he had to take a break. He also needed money for the week. So he went to work.
“You want me to share my grace with you again? That’s what I do. My grace is a part of who I am, the part that makes me half-angel. When I heal you, I allow a part of it to envelop you. When it happened this morning, it felt like something I had never felt before. I would like to do it again, right now, if that’s what you’re talking about.” Dean wanted to laugh at how formal he sounded, but Dean was just excited to hear that it made Cas feel the same way. When Dean nodded, Cas grabbed the back of Dean’s neck, and brought them into a kiss.
He reached up and lightly set his fingers on Mr. Novak’s, and in the blink of an eye, he was somewhere else.
“A father?!” Gabriel raised his voice, and Castiel sighed.
The ride to the diner was quiet, as Dean thought about exactly what was going to happen. Scenario after scenario went through his head, almost taunting him, telling him he was going to lose the only family he’d ever had. Sam had fallen back asleep in his carrier, and Dean’s heart leapt into his throat when Cas had turned around briefly to check on him.
Dean scrunched his face up, mocking him. “Well, fine, but if you get lost don’t come crying to me!” They both laughed and it felt so natural and familiar. Dean said goodbye again, getting in his car, and going to lay down for a little bit. He hoped that Castiel didn’t see what had happened last night, but he could really only hope.
Cas couldn’t help the grin that spread over his face and Dean felt his throat tighten. “My letters are DW. Like… Dean Winchester.” Dean shrugged, trying to keep everything nonchalant. He just didn’t want to show his hope right now, and he couldn’t forget about the fear that climbed his spine at the thought of Mr. Novak knowing his past.
Cas couldn’t help but find Dean’s words endearing, but he wondered if that was truly what Dean was doing. He knew that Dean was notorious for covering up the truth, and for doing ridiculously dangerous things all the time. Maybe he was out on a hunt, but he was still healed. Cas hoped that he hadn’t really noticed.
“Three. We’ve saved three people. All the others, at least fifty of them, are missing. We don’t know where they’re going or what they’re doing. We’ve investigated, we smelled the sulfur, we saw all the signs, but nothing about the person. We haven’t been able to track any single one of them.” Ellen fret, and Jo consoled her mother, who was visibly upset.
“We’ll see what I can get away with-” Cas shook his head, pulling back.
Dean had just turned on his heel to leave, to go drive his car somewhere that he could just sleep for the night and reconvene in the morning. His dad would at least be passed out, hopefully somewhere dead by then. That’s when Cas’s front door opened, letting out all the light, and shining it right onto Dean.
“Those are weird questions, yes, but I don’t think Charlie’s weird. I’m twenty three, and yes, I have a house.” Cas responded inquisitively, and Charlie made a happy noise. “Well, that’s certainly good. Twenty three is young, yeah?” She turned back and gave Dean a look and he literally wanted to stab her right now.
Dean gasped as Cas removed his grace, and he shoved his face into Cas’s neck to avoid looking at him. Cas’s stomach was in knots, flipping and turning around, and he hugged Dean so tightly.
He walked into his classroom, clenching his teeth when he was the only one there. “Good morning,” Mr. Novak spoke, looking down at his papers. Dean took a sharp intake of air. “Hi Mr. Novak.”
Dean shoved the shovel into the ground, digging a hole while Bobby prepared everything. When Dean was finished Bobby stuck the box in the hole, finished with a picture of himself. Dean pushed dirt back over the box and took a deep breath.
“Don’t.” Dean mumbled into Cas’s chest as he probed further, and Cas pulled back. He had never denied Cas an entry, and it hurt a little bit.
“It looks a little better.” Cas decided he wasn’t going to bring up how he got the bruise, but it was still very much on his mind. “Who’s this?” He changed the subject, and Dean actually let out a smile. “This is Sam. Sammy, buddy, can you say hi?” Sam waved shyly, and Cas smiled at him. “T-thank you for finding him, he usually doesn’t do this…” Dean awkwardly laughed, and Cas tried to laugh along with him.
“When you… healed me, that…” Dean knew exactly where he was going, but didn’t quite know how to get there. He wanted Cas to heal him again, to be with him in his body. It felt so nice, so calming, and he wanted it again more than anything.
He saw toys on the ground, and it was very obvious that a young child lived there. Legos were spread across the entire room, and Cas could vaguely recall a memory of Dean’s that involved a lego injury.
“Where is he?” Bobby demanded, and Dean put his hands up.
He rubbed his eyes for a brief second of peace, a second where his mind wasn’t running a marathon or screaming at him. But then that all started up again, everything he had to do needling the back of his head.
Cas put on his own pajamas but found that he couldn’t rest. He dialed Gabriel’s number and stepped out the front door.
“Dean, what happened?!” Cas gasped, and Dean cringed, closing his eyes gently. “I… I fell down the stairs.” Dean tried to add in a laugh there, but it felt awkward and they both knew it was fake. Cas looked at him skeptically, but tried to move on knowing that if he thought about it, it would just make him more upset. “Can I help you?” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand, and although Dean slightly pulled back, he allowed the close personal contact. Cas gently lifted his hand and the ice pack off Dean’s face, and winced. Cas let his fingers trail across the edge of the bruise, and poor attention deprived Dean almost let out a moan of acceptance.
“Sounds good. I’ll see you next time?” Gabe shrugged. “I think I’m gonna stay for a little bit. Maybe translate a little. Have dinner with you. Make sure you actually see this whole Dean thing through.”
able to want something as unholy as him? He opened his eyes, plagued with too many harmful thoughts to get any more rest.
Dean cleared his throat. “You’re wrong. She is weird.” Dean expressed, and Mr. Novak let a natural laugh flow through the room. “Whatever you say, Dean.” Dean felt an odd sort of pride for making him laugh. There was a moment of silence before Mr. Novak’s eye began to wander.
Castiel saw something he found very startling. Dean had an angel blade, something Cas had never seen in real life,  in his car, wrapped up in a cloth that had all kinds of sigils he had never seen. He had books in his passenger seat about Enochian spells for summoning an angel. He could feel Dean’s intentions too. Dean did not believe in angels and was confused why someone would tell him they exist.
Castiel was not scared. He was angry. He was shocked, and jealous, and just protective and he needed to feel Dean under his fingers, just feel his heartbeat because he was so lucky Dean was still alive and breathing. He had seen every time that his breath was almost taken away.  He was livid because if he had just known, if he could have met Dean earlier, he could have healed him and stopped his pain.
“I, um…” Dean trailed off, restlessly shuffling his feet, unsure of how to say goodbye. Something in him was telling him to lean over and kiss him, but he thought it was far too soon to even think of that.
“Thanks Cas.” Dean mumbled, and Cas stood up, reluctantly going on his way.
It was the first time he’d hunted with somebody other than his father, and it was the first time he actually had a good time. It was a long step towards the healing process and Bobby told him that the next time he was in town they’d hunt again. Dean was actually looking forward to that.
Dean turned and looked at his new assigned table, two men sitting at it and Dean took a deep breath, preparing himself to kiss up and pray for tips. Dean slipped over and rubbed his eyes, smiling brightly.
Castiel could not lose him after only just gaining him.
Dinner continued like this. They talked and got food and Sam only interrupted one more time to show Dean that he spilled juice on his shirt. They laughed and Castiel talked about his brothers and his childhood, and it was overall a very pleasant evening. Dean could see himself doing this for the rest of his life.
The familiar low voice should have woken Dean up, but it didn’t. “We were hoping for dinner?” Cas asked, looking at Gabe for assurance, and they both nodded.
Cas quietly made his way towards Dean’s bedroom, pushing open the door. He could hear Dean’s soft breathing, but felt something off in the air. The atmosphere felt cool and he could feel the fear in Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam and him had frequented Cas’s apartment on the weekends. Dean thought back and it had been awhile since Cas had gone to his. “You guys need anything?” Cas snapped Dean out of his thoughts and Dean shook his head. “We’re good. I got paid last week so we’ll be good.” Cas looked up at Dean and smiled.
Dean finally grabbed his keys but it was too late.
“It was nice meeting you, Castiel. Next time I’ll be up for more conversation.” Ellen went back into the kitchen, leaving Dean there alone with Cas.
“He-” Cas started, bringing himself back together. “He has an angel blade. And I don’t know where he got it.”
“I… don’t think I…” Dean trailed off, totally speechless. He had no idea what to say. His mind was quiet, too. He just didn’t know what to think or say and Cas was sitting there watching him with such blue, concerned eyes.
“Angels. What a joke.” They walked back to the car together in silence. “We’ll get him next time.” Bobby spoke, but Dean was left with the feeling that something good wasn’t coming.
The silence that followed was comfortable, no matter how uncomfortable Dean felt at the moment. As they approached the diner, Dean’s stomach did more than flutter: it flipped and tumbled all in his body. He saw Bobby’s truck and Jo’s car and his heart started beating faster now.
Hi :) Thanks so much for reading! If people like it, I'll definitely continue. Thanks again! Much love-
“You think I will see Samuel as a burden.” Dean was astounded by Castiel’s forwardness. Dean nodded, carefully watching his facial expressions.
“Cas?!” It was more of a demand, and not a question. Cas looked over at his brothers to make sure none of them were going to try something. He looked back over at Dean and sent him a look that practically screamed ‘get out of here’. He desperately wanted to go to Dean, to grab him and to get him as far away from here as he possibly could, but he could not leave this. This was too dire.
“The second thing is, the next time you see John-” He made sure not to say your father. “I want you to call me immediately. As soon as it’s safe. I will come to you, immediately. I can’t stress this to you.” Cas’s voice was deep, and grovely, and Dean bit his lip. “I want to be there. I want to keep you safe.”
“I, uh, I’m his English teacher.” Jo paled a bit and pulled back. “O-oh,” She nervously laughed, tapping her fingers against the side of her body. “Well, he’s practically my family. My best friend.” She turned around and looked at him, smiling softly. “Why does he pay rent? Where does he live?” Cas knew he was pushing his luck, but Jo seemed somewhat compliant. “He lives in the apartment building a couple streets down.” She knew she was going to have to cut off this conversation soon. “Where are his parents?” Jo’s face completely paled, and her thoughts stuttered to a halt.
“Hello darlings,” A voice from behind started them and they whipped around, met with a shorter, round faced man with red eyes. He blinked and they were normal color. Dean lifted the gun and shot, but the gun suddenly flew out of his hands.
The phone went dead and Dean was left standing there, puzzled and more than bothered. Lucifer was not a common name, and Ellen had already mentioned it. It had to be Cas’s brother, so why does his name keep coming up?
Ellen shrugged, standing up to head back to the kitchen. “Well, we’ll give it time. Maybe he’s just not ready to talk about the world of creepy crawlies.” She set a hand on the back of Dean’s head, lost in thought. “I’m gonna go get ready for the dinner rush. You get ready for your date!” She smiled, sending him off. Sam toddled off after her, and Dean took a deep breath, trying to relax.
“Ellen, if demons exist, why don’t angels? Trust me, I went through the same thing. I’ve seen it. I saw it in his memories. I didn’t know why it was because we’ve never seen any of them. I saw light, and blue, and felt it. He healed me. Bobby, he healed my broken ribs from that demon. I had something called smiting sickness last night, and Cas said he didn’t know why I got it so bad but he knew it had to be something with Lucifer. He can help us. I promise. I saw his whole life, and I know he’s my soulmate.” Dean was trying to hide the raw emotions in his voice, but his family could hear it.
“Possessive already, Cassie? How is he otherwise?” Castiel almost swooned, grabbing his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean felt ill enough that when Castiel told him to get into bed while he went to check on Sam that he fell asleep in the quickest amount of time he ever had. By the time Castiel got back Dean was curled up under the blankets without even changing clothes. He smiled softly at Dean, grabbing a change of clothes and putting it on the other side of the bed for Dean in case he got up in the middle of the night.
Arms trapped him against his car and his breath caught in his throat.  “Dean,” Cas whispered out, hands curling around his waist. Tingles shot up Dean as Cas repeated his name again. “Dean, Dean,” He started and Dean started to shake.
“I think I want to go home. Not really into going back to class now.” Cas nodded, understanding.
“Please, Dean, please can we call the police? It’s been so long and you said last time-” “No, Cas! He’ll kill me! Or worse, he’ll kill Sam! What if he knows about you, too? What if he’s been following us and fuck-”
Cas looked back, wanting to go and be with Dean. He also wanted to see the angel blade in the cloth that was in the side pocket of the driver seat, but maybe he could talk to Dean about it later.
“You… my letters… are, ah,” Dean paused for a second, nervously tugging at the bandages on his arms. “CN. Like… Castiel Novak.”
“Can I please see?” Cas begged, and Dean just shook his head more. Cas regained his composure, and started to guide Dean up the stairs. He got them into the house, and shut the door, and Dean hadn’t lifted his head once. Cas’s heart nearly stopped when he started to feel a wetness on his shirt.
“It’s kinda hard to look cute when you’re running around taking orders.” Castiel shook his head, chuckling a little bit.
Jo ran over to him and grabbed his arms, pulling him up. She brushed him off, and looked him dead in the eye.
Dean knew it was coming, but he appreciated it in some twisted way. He nodded and Cas got the hint to drop the conversation. So he opened the door and gestured for Dean to do the same.
“Goodnight Sammy!” Dean tucked Sam in and Cas gave his wave. “Sweet dreams, Sam.” Cas gently set his hand on Dean’s shoulder, pulling him off the bed and standing. They went and shut the door, and Dean awkwardly made his way over to the couch.
Dean soon felt good enough to lift his head and open his eyes but he was met with nothing but total blackness. He took one hand and rubbed them, hoping to see anything, but nothing came of it.
“What does all of this mean? I just... are you from heaven? Do you have powers? Do you ever die? Or get sick? I don’t understand-” Cas cut Dean off.
“Gabriel certainly is a character.” Cas made an annoyed face, and Dean tilted his head.
“Dean, I-I… have a question.” Mr. Novak started, even though he had no idea what he was going to say. Dean looked up and nodded, clenching his jaw a little bit.
It didn’t get better after a minute and he stood back up to see if that would help but it didn’t. His world spun even worse and he desperately closed his eyes while he was standing.
Dean looked over and smiled at Cas, who gave him the puppy dog eyes along with Sam. “Alright, alright.” Sam cheered and ran over to Cas who leaned up and grabbed the cookie jar and shared a cookie with Sam.
He desperately tried to find someone to watch Sam because he was so worried about Sam meeting his soulmate, but he couldn’t find anyone. Now he just hoped that Ellen could keep him in the back for longer than twenty minutes.
“Me.” He was breathless, touching his initials. “This is me. This is… mine.” Cas moaned, and Dean nodded. “Such a good brother, Dean, such a good father. Such a good boy.” Castiel whispered sweet things in his ear, and tears filled Dean’s eyes because he couldn’t stop them this time. He hadn’t gotten attention like this since… well, forever.
The whole world spun around him and the only thing he could really see was everybody getting out of the house. He tried to get up and follow him, but he just couldn’t will his legs to actually work. His body was not responding to anything his brain tried to tell it.
“He’s a hunter, with a seriously dark past. Like, think of the worst life someone could live and that’s pretty much what Dean has lived through.” Gabriel sat down on the couch as Castiel kept speaking. “He’s got this dad who is really, truly one of the most terrible people to ever set foot on this Earth. And just the sheer danger of the hunts that disgusting father took him on has me right on the edge. He has so many scars that I can’t even fix because he would lose it if he figured out I’m a ne-”
But now here he was, at Mr. Novak’s door, wanting to cry. Charlie stood behind him, hand on his shoulder.  Nobody else was in the room because class didn’t start for another ten minutes, and as much as Dean knew he should walk away and just come back later, he found himself with his hand on the door knob. He took one last look back at Charlie and she ushered him forward.
Cas’s hand found the back of Dean’s neck and the other fell to his waist. Dean leaned into it and Cas’s entire body was buzzing excitedly. Their lips moved in unison, just slowly exploring and feeling the closeness of each other. Dean’s skin was smooth and Cas couldn’t help running his fingers over the back of his neck.
“Fine, fine!” Jo brushed him off, but she smirked at Castiel. “Sorry you got stuck with this grump.” Dean sent her a death glare, and she grinned.
When Mr. Novak heard Dean’s voice, his eyes shot up. They made brief eye contact before Dean had to look away, too afraid to blush. He’d never been shy like this, but when it came to Mr. Novak, he could barely even speak.
Everything suddenly made sense; this was why Dean lived with his little brother in a small apartment, and why he had a job, and why he was always bruised and always looking so hurt. “You shouldn’t have to do this by yourself Dean. You don’t deserve this.” This caught Dean’s attention and he turned his head to face him. “What?” Dean asked again, knowing that he couldn’t have heard that correctly. Sam didn’t deserve this, no, but Dean definitely did.
“Dean?” Gabe asked and Dean froze up. “Uh, well, um-” “What?” Cas asked and peeked his head out, and when he saw it was Dean, his eyebrows scrunched. “Dean?” He stepped out in front of Gabe. “What’s wrong?” Concern promptly crossed his face and Dean’s bottom lip wobbled.
“Yeah, Sammy, it’s time for bed.” Sam let out a quiet groat, showing his displeasure at bedtime. “Sorry buddy. The rules are the rules.” Dean picked Sam up and carried him over to his room and then to his bed. Dean knew they were lucky enough to even have separate rooms, let alone separate beds. Sam was already half asleep as Dean tucked him in tight, and he smiled softly at his brother.
“Alright, I’ll get some research done now. Call me if anything else happens.” The line went dead and Castiel found his way back inside and to the couch. He set his head in his hands, taking a deep breath to try to steady his nerves. He grabbed the book on his coffee table and read and read and read.
Dean’s heart stopped for a second, but he quickly willed it to start working again. Mr. Novak’s first name was Jimmy. It didn’t start with a C. It was just a whole coincidence, no matter how painful it was, he had to squash that hope as quickly as it had come up.
They talked about Dean’s work and how Charlie might visit him this weekend, until they finally got to Mr. Novak’s classroom. “Okay Dean-y, I’ll see you later?” Dean nodded, taking a deep breath.
Dean tried to salvage something for his breakfast, but he couldn’t. He only had enough for Sam’s dinner tonight, and maybe if he got lucky, a little bit for himself. He would just have to eat a lot at school today. Maybe steal an apple.
Dean had a full 12 hour day, knowing that he had to meet rent tomorrow. Ellen had gladly accommodated, with generous three half-hour breaks with food. It was a busy Saturday, though. Dean was running ragged around the whole restaurant, really just trying to keep himself from either rolling his eyes or bursting into tears.
“I guess you should get goin-” “I don’t have a car, but I can have my brother pick me up tomorrow morning… if that’s okay?” Relief went through both of their minds, and Dean settled down. “That’s more than okay.” Dean blushed a deep red color. “Then you can sleep on my bed, and I can sleep on the couch.” Cas shrugged. “I’m fine wherever, Dean.” Dean went over and checked on Sam and saw that he had fallen back asleep, and he sighed happily. “I’m sorry. He gets these nightmares.”
Dean thought for a second and shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t really care. So you’re coming over tonight?” Dean asked, hesitant for a second because sometimes Cas would just pop in without a single word. “Yeah, we haven’t had dinner in awhile at your place.”
Dean couldn’t take this. Not today, and most definitely not in the emotional state of mind he was in. He was either going to pass out or burst into hysterical tears, and he needed to stop this before questions went too far. He needed to get Sammy, and he needed to get out of here. He needed to get so far away that he’d never even have to think about his father again.
Ellen ran out with a glass of ice water, and Dean took sips of it to get the taste out of his mouth. Sammy was now awake and sitting at the chair next to Dean, and Dean sighed and laid his head down on the table, again. His everything throbbed and ached and he just wanted to sleep. “Do you think you can drive home by yourself, Dean?” Ellen rubbed his back comfortingly, and Dean stood up on his shaky feet. “Yeah,” But as he went to go get Sammy, he stumbled and had to hold on to the tables.
“If I promise not to look, can I make you feel better?” Cas asked, and this one was met with some hesitation from Dean, not just an outright denial. Dean started to nod his head gently, and Cas sighed a breath of relief. Cas lifted his hand and tangled it in Dean’s hair, allowing some anxiety relief to permeate through all the emotions. Cas tried his hardest not to look, but he could feel some terrible things. Dean was so scared, so concerned. For him and Sam.
Dean flopped back onto the bed and shut his eyes, trying so hard not to think about what was going to happen. He literally couldn’t even put himself in a place to think about it. He felt Cas’s hand brush across his cheek, and when Dean turned his head, he was met with an uneasy look.
“It’s not normal. It’s more normal than some of my other problems, though.” Charlie laughed this time. “That’s true. C’mon, I’ll walk with you that way.”
i'm terrible love you guys
“I’m a friend, honestly, stop it with that biblical mumbo jumbo. I come bearing gifts.” With a snap of his fingers, he was holding a knife. He offered the hilt to Dean, but Dean simply looked at it warily.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighed in relief, silently travelling through the school because he felt like the less noise he makes, the better. Dean finally made it to the teacher’s lounge, and he visibly relaxed. He peeked his head inside and almost cried out in happiness when he saw that no one was in there. He snuck in, keeping close to the walls in case someone walked by. He opened the fridge, smiling successfully as he saw the ice pack. He reached in and gently pressed it on the side of his face, slumping in relief. He closed the freezer and allowed himself a moment of peace, before-
“Just touch him. That’s it, you don’t need to do anything else. I promise it’s worth it.” Cas felt a sudden touch of sympathy for his brother. “I’m sorry Gabriel. You’ll find your soulmate some day.” Gabriel smiled, and although Cas knew it was genuine, he could still see the sadness.
“What were you doing in that house?!” Dean raised his voice, but he couldn’t hide the fear. Cas frowned, standing up and towering over Dean. Dean just rushed in the opposite direction, until his back pressed up against a tree.
Gabriel’s voice had a tinge of irritation in it and Castiel decided not to press any further.
“What’s wrong with Lucifer?” Dean asked, and he could see Cas physically tensed.
be patient my dudes i am so sorry i don't update too much
“I’m sure of it. Anything concerning Othello is definitely a weakness of mine.” Dean looked down at his watch and cursed the whole concept of time. He would much rather just stay and talk to Cas.
“Why do you keep stumbling over your words? Just how tired are you?” Dean shook his head and Cas sighed gently. Dean exhaled and leaned into Cas, wrapping his arms around his body. “Are you sleeping here tonight?” Cas asked smoothly, and Dean nodded, hiding his face in Cas’s chest. Cas shut the door behind them and found Gabe tucking Sam under blankets on the couch.
“Prove that you’re-” Jo didn’t even need to finish the sentence before Castiel used his grace to heal Bobby’s hurt back. Blue light emitted from Cas’s hands and settled onto Bobby’s lower back. Bobby straightened up as he felt the temporary sting, but it was followed by relief. He lifted a hand to his back, face full of disbelief.
“You told me you love me last night.” Cas finally opened his eyes to look down at a now nervous Dean. “No way… did I?” The red blush that covered his face was priceless. Cas laughed a little bit and lifted thumb and stroked his cheek.
“What’s the worst that can happen, Dean? Nothing. Just give him a little touch.” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, very sure he wasn’t going to cry. He couldn’t cry. “We’ll see, Charlie.”
“Yes.” Dean whispered against Cas, and he couldn’t help the smile that bloomed onto his face. “Sammy’s gonna be so excited.” Cas pulled back and pressed his lips to Dean’s. “Can you believe we’ve been together for six months?” Cas mused to him, and Dean nodded. “I can believe it only because I was crushing for you for so long and promised myself if I ever got the chance to be with you, I would never give it up.” Dean admitted and Cas couldn’t help his heart from swelling.
don’t  even ask me how i decide when to update
“Do you have a brother named Lucifer?” Ellen asked, and Dean was kind of creeped out because he knew that Cas did have a brother named Lucifer. Cas nodded again, confusedly tilting his head to the side.
“Daddy,” Sam started as Dean turned around to back out of the parking spot, and Dean made a little sound of acknowledgment before Sam continued. “Why did John hurt you?” Dean let out a quick breath, knowing this was long coming. “I don’t know Sam, but we don’t have to worry about him anymore. He’s gone.” Sam nodded, trusting his dad, but Dean didn’t even know if he could trust himself on that subject.
“This is Lucifer. I think he’s building an army of demons.” Dean diverted his attention over to the wall. Underneath the picture of Lucifer was a picture of Crowley, the demon who Dean had met the other night. It seemed so long ago.
“No need to get an attitude with me. We’re all confused. What were you doing there last night?” Ellen kept going, and Dean felt guilt settle in his body about how he talked to her.
Dean had been avoiding Mr. Novak at pretty much all costs; he was scared. He had never really opened up to anyone about his feelings, let alone cry in front of someone other than Sammy. He wanted to leave so badly ---wanted to leave and never come back. But that wasn’t a possibility. Sammy and him were stuck here for a long time.
Being thrown to the ground had bruised one of Dean’s ribs and scraped up his forearms pretty well. There wasn’t much that could be done, unfortunately. He wrapped bandages around his arms and tried to take tylenol every four hours. Hopefully that would be enough to get him through it.
“Wow Sammy, that’s a cool spatula. Maybe you should go give it back to Ellen?” Dean suggested, but Sammy made a defeated noise. “I wanna stay out here with you.” He whined, and Dean flinched a little bit.
“You sure have a fixer upper there, Cas.” Gabriel whispered, reaching out a hand and placing it on Cas’s shoulder.
“What’s wrong?” Apparently Dean’s poker face wasn’t great because Cas could immediately tell something wasn’t right.
“Do you want to go lay down? It feels like you might need a nap.” Dean had been dozing off during the last tv show they had decided on, and Dean smiled a little bit. Cas stood up off the couch, and grabbed Dean’s hands.
Cas looked at Dean’s face, soaking it all in. He could count every single freckle on Dean’s face and when he finished, just start over. He wanted to reach over, to brush his thumb over Dean’s lips and feel him.
Dean’s throat felt like it was closing up, and he felt like his whole world was imploding in on him. He was going to either burst into tears or pass out. He was in science class when someone had accidentally pressed on the scar on his back, causing him to flashback and push him over the edge. He was having a full blown panic attack. His heart was racing and thumping in his chest, and his whole body was trembling to an intensity that scared him half to death.
“We don’t have to. I have an extra room at my place, and it’s closer, so you guys could just sleep there. I can drive you back there in the morning.” Cas seemed like he had it all figured out. Dean couldn’t really find it in his heart to argue or come up with any other suggestions, so he just nodded.
“How do you feel?” Ellen asked as they approached the house and Dean shrugged. “I’m not sure. I just don’t know how I went downhill so fast and then get back up and be fine. I really feel okay now. Maybe I just needed to get sick.” Dean tried to get through it, but he still felt off. He played it off as nerves.
“Nothing… just need some fresh air, I think.” Dean clenched his jaw to try to help relieve any of the tension.
Thank you SO so so much, all of you <3
Dean hesitated for a second and that’s when Cas knew it was more. Cas reached his hand out and rested it on Dean’s waist, pulling him down. “You can tell me anything, Dean.” Cas whispered, rubbing his side gently.
“I just don’t know,” Cas started, looking down at his hands that were folded on the table. “I just want to help.”
“Hey, guys…” Dean trailed off, pointing up at the lights. Ellen pulled over, and they all got out of the car. Dean grabbed the holy water in the flask in his pocket and gripped it hard. The night really was cold, colder than usual for Lawrence in October. It all felt… weird too. Everything felt weird.
“That’s a great idea. Dean, I’ll pick up Sammy and help you put him in the car.” Jo started, and Ellen helped Dean up and over to Cas. “Thank you so much…-” Ellen started, and Cas smiled at her. “Cas.” Ellen nodded and smiled up at him. “Thank you, Cas. We really appreciate it.” Ellen sent Dean a death glare, and Dean mumbled a quick ‘thank you’ under his breath. Ellen slowly let go of Dean to make sure he was standing alright, but when he hunched over, Cas reached forward and wrapped his arm under his shoulder, keeping him up. Dean may have blushed, but it could have easily been blamed on the sickness.
“I don’t know.” Dean averted his eyes back out the window as Cas drove. “What…” Dean trailed off for a second, pausing to collect his thoughts. “What are you going to do?” Cas smiled gently at the thought of Dean wanting to spend another day with him.
But now Dean was running and Cas was running after him. Dean finally made it to his car, fumbling in his backpack to try to get his keys. His heart was beating out of his chest and he felt like he was going to throw up but he swallowed all of it and just tried to get his keys. “C’mon,” He mumbled rummaging through his backpack, unable to find his keys. Little did he know that was Cas’s doing because he was willing Dean’s hand to not grab them.
Dean threw his head back and laughed. “Yeah, I sure hope my soulmate’s name is Cookie Nonster. That would be fun. Now let’s get your bag all packed up so we can go get you to school.”
Dean sat at the edge of the bed, back tense, stomach in knots. Cas could feel his apprehension, and he hated it. He wanted so badly to take this away, to make this better, but he knew that was not going to happen. Dean needed to tell these people who he was, and why he was on their side.
Cas was sitting in the kitchen, sitting at the counter. Dean rubbed his eyes and made his way over to Cas.
“Shit,” Dean whispered out curses as he stumbled tiredly to the boy’s room. Cas slowly peeked into the room and saw Dean pick up Sam and hold him close to his chest. Sam sobbed violently into Dean’s chest and Dean rocked him back and forth, whispering sweet things into his ears. Cas’s heart broke at the sight, and he bit his lip and tried to keep from saying anything.
Dean gently patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry about it. I think we’re gonna go to Cas’s tonight.” Dean flinched because he hated dropping in on people and he didn’t have his phone so he didn’t even warn him. His house was just too close though and his father may see the Impala if he drove by. At least Cas was about fifteen minutes away from the restaurant and he had private parking. That meant there was no threat from his father.
Dean nodded slightly, but Cas knew that was consent for healing. Cas leaned forward and set his lips on Dean’s forehead, allowing his grace to run through Dean and rest his uneasy stomach. Dean felt a slight discomfort at the new feeling in his body, but he felt Cas’s energy in him. It was inside of him, soothing his ailments, putting him at ease. It was unlike anything Dean had ever felt. He lost himself to the feeling. Cas remained for a second longer than he usually would, simply because he could feel Dean’s aura. Before, when he’d healed him, he was quickly in and out to not create a disturbance. In this state, he could feel Dean’s soul flush with his, and it was an indescribable feeling.
A perplexed look crossed both of their faces.
“That’s not a demon, is it?” Dean asked, watching as it disappeared into the night. Cas shook his head, knowing that was Lucifer escaping. He cursed internally, knowing that Michael was going to come out any minute and be upset with their failure. Cas had to get Dean out of there, though.
“Are you okay?” Cas asked, for the third time the entire fifteen minute ride, and Dean actually cracked a little smile at it. He had never had someone so worried about what he was thinking.
Cas’s leaned back to look at Dean’s eyes, and he could tell Dean was left breathless. His eyes were shut, his mouth slightly open, and Cas made sure he would remember this moment forever. Dean’s eyes fluttered open, and his cheeks suddenly became very rosy once he realized Cas was looking at him. Dean cleared his throat, and turned to face the counter. “Thank you.” He mumbled, and looked over at what was cooking. He felt lighter, much better than he had in awhile.
“Sammy you can go get a lollipop from the kitchen.” They had a candy stash that Sam could go get if he was having a good day. He squealed excitedly and wiggled out of Jo’s arms, running into the kitchen.
“He’s resting now, seems to have gotten over the stomach distress. I have no idea why that happened to him. I’ve never seen a case of smiting sickness so severe, even after all of our exploits with those demons.” Castiel felt unease as he thought about why Dean could be feeling that way.
“Is Sam in here?” Dean asked, gently setting his hand on the doorknob. Castiel nodded, and stood up from the couch to walk over.
“I can come back Sunday and we can keep going. In the meantime, try to crack that angel tablet. We’ll come back together on Sunday and see what we’ve found.” Cas nodded and walked Gabe to the door.
“It’s a long way to drive to see if Dean’s here. He’s not. I don’t know where he is now.” Jo responded and Dean was beyond grateful. He parked in the employee parking lot behind the restaurant so he didn’t have to cross his father’s eyesight.
“What time’s it?” Cas’s words were slurred with drowsiness because he stayed up last night longer than he would admit to look at and feel Dean in his arms. “6:30… we have like a half an hour.” Cas opened his arms up, inviting Dean to snuggle back in. Dean gladly accepted the invitation and hopped back into bed, setting his hands on Cas’s chest.
“Yeah Gabriel? Come over to my house now.”
They still tried to keep their distance at school and they went separately, knowing that they could get in trouble, but they weren’t too worried. Dean was nineteen and they were already moving, and Cas had already told them that he wasn’t going back next year.
A scene started but then it got too fuzzy to see. A bright, searing light filled Dean, made him feel airy and vulnerable. It hurt, but not quite in a bad way. Then, as quickly as he’d seen all the memories, they vanished right before his eyes. And then he could see the horror on his soulmate’s face.
“I think you’re the one who needs it.” Dean followed along, a feeling of content that settled right into his stomach.
Cas grumbled into his mouth but Dean didn’t really care what he said. Cas rubbed his hands up and down Dean’s back and decided to slip his hands up Dean’s shirt and grab him by the waist. Cas’s hands stopped when he felt the lump on Dean’s back and his flinch. He pulled back immediately.
He was terribly nervous to see Castiel tonight because he didn’t know if it was a date or not. He sat and debated for about a whole hour what he should wear. After that long debate, he just decided that he should wear his uniform in case Ellen wants him to work after. His uniform was a black long sleeve shirt, black pants, and a white apron.
“Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satani-” With a wave of a hand, Dean was thrown hard onto the ground and all of the breath left his lungs. Gravel ground into his forearms and he was momentarily blindsided from the pain. A sharp ache plagued Dean on the right side of his chest, but he ignored it as best as he could and looked around for Bobby. He had been thrown the opposite direction and Dean heard the demon laugh.
He didn’t have anywhere to go. He was so scared that he had started to, unknowingly, make his way to Mr. Novak’s classroom. He held back the tears as much as he could and tried to look normal as he walked through the semi-empty hallways. He kept his eyes on the ground, and his hands behind his back to hide the shaking. He finally made it to Mr. Novak’s classroom and bit his lip as he saw it was empty of students. He opened the door gently and made eye contact with Mr. Novak, and he immediately stood up. “Dean-” Dean cut him off, his shaky voice trembling in fear.
Charlie sighed. “Okay, Dean. Whatever you think. Want to go pick up Sammy? I could use a ride home.” Dean smiled. “Now that, I can do. Let’s go.”
He remembered why he had woken up an hour earlier than usual- his phone had rang. He grabbed it, seeing three missed calls from Bobby with numerous text messages.
“What can we do?” Dean asked, gesturing to Bobby and himself. Ellen looked over at Jo.
Gabe groaned. “Stop rambling. I have a book for you.” Gabriel handed over the book and Castiel’s mood darkened. “You found it?” Gabe nodded, being serious himself for the first time in a long time.
“Hey,” Dean’s serious voice caught Cas off guard for a second as he got into the bed next to Dean. “When you, um…” Cas turned totally towards Dean, patiently waiting for him to collect his thoughts. Dean shyly covered his face with his hands, and Cas reached forward to grab them.
Jo trailed behind them with a half-asleep Sam in her arms, and Dean sighed as he wondered what he just got himself into.
“Dean,” Cas cooed, holding him close. “I don’t think you can stand up yet. Would you like me to help you move?”
“I have to run to class. I’ll see you later!” Dean took off, leaving Cas watching after him. Although Cas wanted to ask him to do something tonight, he had something more pressing on his hands that he had to get taken care of with Michael.
Bobby sighed a breath of relief.
Then he felt the death of Cas’s father. The sadness, the grief, the mourning were all a little too familiar for Dean. After the death of his own mother, he could pinpoint those feelings anywhere. But time moved on and he felt Cas move on, get his teaching job, and buy a house.
“Fine by me, darlin’s.” Ellen hopped back to the kitchen, checking to make sure Dean was alright before leaving him there. Cas sat down at the table that Jo showed them to, when his eyes caught a familiar body leaning over a chair in what looked to be a very uncomfortable position. He could tell by the way his body was lying, and hell just by the contours that it was Dean.
“I don’t know whether that’s impressive, or just a testament to her personality.” They both laughed, and Dean couldn’t help but get uncomfortably hot. He rolled his sleeves up and set his hands back down on the table. Cas’s eyes travelled down to where his initials were etched on his skin. The bandages were higher now, but he could still see the scrapes.
“It’s my English teacher.” Ellen pulled back, and it got oddly quiet. Dean sat there, stiff and waiting for a response.
“I don’t know, I…” Deserve the pain. That thought brought him to an impasse that he had been at many times. Don’t deserve Cas. Don’t deserve to be fixed. Damn, that was not a fun thought. Dean blinked up at Cas, trying not to think those things. He knew that was John, in the back of his head.
Gabe gave her a weird look, and Dean internally panicked. “His… room is through that door, down the hallway, up the stairs and then the second one on the left.” Gabe gave them a smile and a wave, on his way. Charlie squealed.
“What are you reading?” Mr. Novak was suddenly in front of him and Dean had to swallow the growing lump in his throat. He laughed nervously. “Some ancient folklore about vampires. For… uh-” He could not think of a single excuse. “Science.” He wanted to hit himself in the face.
Dean took a deep breath, taking his hand off the doorknob. “No.” She grabbed Dean’s hand and dragged him through the door. “Hi Mr. Novak! Here I am, with Dean!” Charlie practically shouted and he looked up from his desk and Dean immediately looked at the ground.
“Thank you, Gabe.” Dean spoke tenderly, and Gabe smiled. “Of course Dean. I’ll see you guys later, okay?” They said their goodbyes and soon Gabe was gone, and Dean was curled up in Cas’s bed. Cas went and checked on Sam one more time after cleaning the kitchen up after Gabe and himself.
“Like a month. I don’t really know.” Ellen rolled her eyes from the kitchen. Dean was puttering around, cleaning up tables and asking his customers if they were okay. He was bored and Sam was already asleep in the back room so he didn’t even have to worry about him. It didn’t help that he was so tired he couldn’t even think straight because he hadn’t been sleeping.
“Whatcha thinkin’ about?” Dean asked, sitting on the desk next to Cas’s hand and Cas looked up at him. “Nothing much,” Cas yawned and leaned back, stretching his back. “I was thinking about dinner tonight. What do you want?”
“Yes, Lucifer. C’mon boy you gotta come over right now.” Dean sighed, but essentially decided that he was going to go over and check on Bobby.
“My brother Michael has been leading my brother, Gabriel, and I to try and stop Lucifer. We weren’t even exactly sure what he was doing until we saw what happened last night. He is building an army of demons, but we aren’t sure why. Michael is getting in touch with the other nephilims in the area to see if they’ve heard anything. Gabriel is researching the actual demons, summoning any he can to talk to them. I am dealing with Dean. I need to know why he got so sick last night, and why a demon named Crowley gave him an angel blade.” Cas was straight to the point, but the others in the room just sat and stared at him.
Dean was still shaking violently, trying to recover from the hit he just got. He always got so worked up after all this, knowing that one day he’d have to go back and it could be twice as bad. Dean sat in his car in the parking lot of his school, contemplating even going in. The last time he’d skipped school, his landlord caught him and almost called the police, and Dean was not willing to risk a call like that. So maybe he’d just sit here until his adrenaline was pumped out of his system, or maybe he’d fall asleep. All he needed to do was wait until Sammy got out of school so he could pick him up.
“Goodmorning Charlie… Dean.” The way Mr. Novak said his name made Dean’s stomach twirl. “How old are you, by the way? And do you have a house?” Charlie asked, and Dean was mortified, but he managed to keep his face straight. “She’s weird. I don’t know why she’s asking that.” Dean pushed out, smacking her back, and her grin just widened.
Bobby choked back a laugh. “Your English teacher? Boy, you are certainly a hoot. How old is he?!” The humor in Bobby’s voice relaxed Dean considerably. “He’s… on the younger side, but older than twenty two I’m pretty sure. I know, I certainly am a… hoot.” Dean responded, soft smile on his face.
Dean’s throat definitely had a lump and as he tried to swallow it, some tears pooled in his eyes but he quickly pushed them away. Cas had said such amazing things about him, things that he’d never been told, things that he’d never felt about himself. And for one second he let himself think about their future. A house, Sammy with two parents, a dog, maybe a cat to snuggle around, doing a hunt here and there. And it felt better than anything he’d ever felt.
A mind-splitting ache worked it’s way into the back of Dean’s head, starting at the base of his neck and wrapping all the way up to his temples. Dean assumed it was the combination of the light and the noise that made this happen. He tried to move, tried to do anything, but he couldn’t.
It was a quiet night, and Dean was thrilled about that. The restaurant was insanely quiet with Sammy in the corner, fast asleep, and with the small, but efficient, staff around the table. Dean’s head rested on his arms as they tiredly conversed about anything that came to mind. “How’s school, honey?” Ellen would ask him and he’d respond with a sentence or two about how much homework he had or how hard his classes were, and she’d be pretty satisfied… but he’d never tell the truth.
“Don’t I always owe you one?!” He could vaguely hear Charlie’s cackled from his car.
“I’m sorry you didn’t have the time to tell me on your own.” Cas apologized, and Dean could hear the sincerity in his voice. He knew it wasn’t Cas’s fault, but he wished he never even had to tell Cas about his dad. Just say he passed, and get over it. But that’s not how life goes.
Come to think of it, Cas had not brought up the memories of all the hunts he had been on, which lead Dean to believe that Castiel already knew about the monster world. To any normal person, they would probably be thoroughly freaked out if they just saw that everything they were ever afraid of is real. Cas had to know, but he didn’t want to talk about that now.
Dean sighed in relief, and spun on his heels back into Cas’s room.
“Dean, I will never pressure you into anything. Tell me when you’re ready and I will be right beside you.” He very deliberately put his hand on Dean’s clothed shoulder and the softness in Mr. Novak’s voice went right to Dean’s head.
Dean was thankful it was Friday because he worked all this weekend at the Diner, so Ellen would probably give Dean all of his tips because she knew how tight they were on money. Jo would probably even give him some of her tips. Dean was just so lucky to have them. Sometimes Garth would even pay him to do research for a hunt, and that was Dean’s favorite. He was researching something about ancient vampires now.
“I-I,” Dean started, and Mr. Novak immediately looked up, knowing that this was the first time he’s ever really heard Dean’s voice. “I would like to read the book you have on the shelf over there… would you mind if I borrowed it?” Dean’s voice was quiet and soft, but Mr. Novak couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face when he heard it. “I would love to let you borrow it. It’s one of my favorites.” Mr. Novak hopped up and went over to grab To Kill a Mocking Bird and handed it to Dean without a hesitation. “Perhaps you could even keep it if you like it enough. I’ll leave it up to you.” A real smile perked up on Dean’s face, and Mr. Novak would tell you any day, that smile is still burned into his mind.
“This is Crowley. His second hand man, but I think he’s trying to betray him because he gave you that blade.” Dean was confused as Bobby frantically turned to him. “You still have that blade, right?!”
“Was it uncomfortable, Dean?” Cas’s forehead wrinkled a bit in concern, and Dean shook his head quickly.
“You’re a fucking failure, Dean-” Dean was distracted enough to not duck beneath his father’s fist, and it collided with the side of his face and knocked him to the ground. Dean gasped in a deep breath, immediately feeling that the hit was going to leave a killer bruise. Dean crawled out from beneath his father’s legs, knowing that if he could get out of the house before his father got him, he would be out of the clear. Dean sprinted down the stairs, holding his face with one hand and angrily wiping his teary eyes with his other hand.
“We have to leave, Dean. Do you want to leave Sam asleep or wake him up?” Cas asked, and Dean groaned loudly.
“Get him in here.” Bobby growled out, his gruff voice almost triggering Dean. Dean hopped off his seat, heart beating wildly in his chest. He peeked his head out the door and found Cas sitting on the bench outside the restaurant with his head in his hands.
“Do you want me to make you feel better?” Cas asked in a whispered voice, and Dean looked up at him with big eyes. He didn’t know if he wanted that. He didn’t know how it would make him feel, being healed by something. The thought didn’t sit right, and Dean was trying to figure out why.
“I’m sorry for not telling you.” Dean mumbled sweetly, and Cas smiled softly. “And I’m sorry for thinking all that stuff. I just get so scared.” Cas leaned forward and pressed his lips to Dean’s swollen ones.
“Dean, you can answer me. You’re completely safe here.” Dean swallowed the lump in his throat and tried to stop the tears from even filling his eyes. “Dean…” Cas tried to talk as softly and as calmly as he could- he just wanted Dean to open up so he could help. “Did your father leave that bruise on you earlier this week?” Dean, still looking the other way, nodded before he could even think about what he should answer with. Cas drawled in a sharp breath.
“What’s goin’ on?” Bobby asked, and Ellen set her head in her hand.
“Who is it?!” Ellen exclaimed, and Dean dragged Jo over to the table her mom was sitting at. Sammy came running out, content with a lollipop in his mouth. Dean handed him a book to go look at. Dean, Ellen, and Jo settled at the table and talked with hushed voices.
“Uh, w-well, uh- nevermind, noth… nothing.” Dean turned around to go back to his car but Cas grabbed his shoulder and turned him around. “I… I’m sorry to inter-interrupt.” Gabe took a step towards him. “You aren’t interrupting. What’s wrong?” Gabe reached over and grabbed the sleeping Sam out of Dean’s arms and went into the apartment, leaving Cas and Dean alone.
“It’s no problem, really.” Dean wanted to melt into a puddle of nothing because he was either embarrassed or so affected by this stupid little crush. “Can you say thank you Sammy?” He looked to Sammy, and he muttered a quick ‘thank you’, and Dean smiled again. “Anytime, Dean, if you ever need anything, come find me.”
“We’ll have to go back to my house.” Dean sighed, really not knowing what to say or do. He felt so off and out of it, he kinda just wanted to take a break from the world and not think about anything for a little bit.
The light steadily got brighter and the noise increased until it was almost unbearable and Dean was not sure whether he was crying or screaming, but he could feel it in his throat. Dean shut his eyes as tight as he possibly could, covering his ears. He could feel the tears on his cheeks, and he just wished that he would pass out so he didn’t have to deal with it anymore.
Cas did the only thing he could think of; he wrapped his arms around Dean and brought him into his body. Dean’s arms hung loosely around his body, surprised by the hug he was brought into. Cas simply hugged him tighter, and Dean reluctantly gave in, wrapping his arms around Cas’s torso and crying into his shoulder.
“I love you too, if you couldn’t guess.” Cas pressed a sweet kiss on Dean’s cheek. “But I think I love you more.” Dean was delirious and Cas couldn’t help but laugh. “You are too cute. I’m gonna tell you in the morning how much I know you love me.” Dean nodded, and he pressed a kiss to Cas’s lips and snuggled into the blankets to fall asleep.
“I’m sure you’ve met me before! You know, with Dean’s memories and stu-” Dean cut her off. “Jo! Stop, oh my god.” He muttered, but Cas’s smile did not falter.
The last time he’d been on a hunt was a month ago when Bobby had come by and asked for help. Charlie watched Sam for the day, and they went and hunted down a ghost that was haunting some gym.
The flutter in Dean’s stomach intensified ten fold, and Cas hadn’t even offered a part of his grace. Anticipation swirled Dean’s foggy mind, and when Dean pushed one of his legs between Cas’s to get closer, Cas took in a sharp inhale of air. The world around him started to buzz, started to feel different, and things started to disappear. Dean couldn’t feel the bed beneath him, or the air surrounding him, he could just feel Cas. Cas on his body, in his body, around his body.
i moved into college so i won't be updating as much but i literally love this story way too much to leave it!!! thank you so much for all your comments!!
“Dean, you can call me whatever you want.” His hand reached out and gently grabbed Dean’s, and Dean’s heart just about stopped. Cas’s thumb rubbed circles across Dean’s skin and Dean had never felt more alive than in that exact moment.
“Bullshit!” The laugh extended to the others in the room, but Dean simply rested his tired head on his elbow. When they noticed he was not laughing, Ellen gasped.
When Dean left the room that Sam had been sleeping in, Cas was watching him closely as he walked over.
“I’m going to go to school, and you go to sleep. Sammy and I will stop here on the way home to pick you up for some dinner. Then we can talk about all of this Lucifer business. Does that sounds okay?” Bobby appreciated Dean to the moon and back.
“You can’t drive, Dean.” Jo went over and helped him back to the table, and then went to go get Sam. Dean bit his lip and looked up at Ellen with sad, teary eyes. “We’ll find a way to get you and Sammy home, honey.”
The line went silent, and Dean let out a shaky breath. He was still concerned, and he dialed Ellen’s number.
“Was that all, Dean?” Cas was getting somewhere and was hoping he would get more information.
“I, um-” Dean cleared his throat, looking at Sammy. He awkwardly shuffled his feet, taking a breath.
“Yeah.” Dean slurred, pushing his face into the pillow and going back to sleep. Cas clenched his jaw and pulled away, even though he didn’t want to. He wanted to spend the night with Dean, just watching him and holding him. Now he was really starting to sound creepy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Does it…” Dean trailed off, reaching his hand up and putting it on Cas’s that was resting on his shoulder. “Does it hurt you?” Cas shook his head immediately.
The same bright light from before lit up the upstairs and Dean was struck with the same illness he had felt before, perhaps more intense. It debilitated him.
“Rest, Dean. I won’t be leaving anytime soon.” Cas kissed the top of Dean’s head, and Dean was asleep before he even knew it.
Castiel was on the other side of the school, grading the last of his papers when there was a knock on his door. He looked up, smiling at the sight of his brother. “Gabriel!” He exclaimed, getting up and going towards his brother.
Maybe it was.
Dean hurried back to the kitchen and checked on Sam real quick, who was sitting with his coloring book on the counter and pretty much minding his own business except for the occasional question. Dean sighed in relief for what had felt like the millionth time today, and checked the clock. Ten more minutes until he was out of here. He straightened up and continued on, pushing himself for those last ten minutes before his shift was over.
He didn’t know what was wrong with his father; Dean would be proud to have a son like Sam. Dean on the other hand...well, whatever. Dean knew it was a trade off and he didn’t deserve it. “Goodnight Sammy,” Dean leaned down and pressed a kiss to Sam’s forehead, and left the room, quietly shutting the door. Dean yawned and stretched his back, grabbing his new, borrowed book, and crawling into bed for some alone time.
That stopped Gabriel right in his tracks.
“I can’t give anything to you, Cas.” Dean’s words dripped with sadness, and fear, and Cas’s heart broke. “I just take. I take your money, I take your food, I take your room, your house-”
“Shh,” Cas shushed him with a soft, calm voice knowing that he had to be the adult in this situation. “Everything is okay, Dean.” Dean shook his head, trying to shake off the memories. “It’s okay. We’re here and we’re safe, yes?” Dean nodded his head but Cas wouldn’t take that. “Respond to me with your voice, Dean.”
He started the car and left as fast as he possibly could without drawing too much attention to himself. Thoughts were running a million miles through his head. Why had his father driven over more than an hour to look for Dean? He told Dean over and over again that he never wanted to see him again and Dean was just a mistake, so why would he come looking for him?
Dean squinted his eyes, trying to see. The room seemed empty, and they all lowered their weapons. That didn’t mean they lowered their guards, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean!” Charlie called, running over and jumping on his back. “Hi Charlie.” He shook her off his back, putting her softly on the ground. “I got you a granola bar. Sorry it couldn’t be more.” Dean smiled gratefully.
“I missed you last night.” Cas stood up, now eye level with Dean. Dean felt a blush climb his neck to his cheeks. “Yeah, it was a little weird that Ellen had me work yesterday. Thursdays aren’t my day to come in.” He shrugged and Cas leaned forward so Dean could feel his breath on his lips. “Maybe we can make up the lost time tonight?”
“I’m scared. And nervous. I didn’t even know angels existed, and now I have to be soulmates with a half-angel. I don’t know what’s going on.” Cas held him tighter, encouraging him to keep going.
“I know you are.” Dead stated, perhaps a little shortly. He knew that Cas was sorry. He didn’t really need to hear it.
“What is it?” Dean turned to Cas, knowing that he had the answer. Cas made his way over and sat next to Dean. He put his head into his hands and Dean felt bad. Cas was obviously upset, but Dean was too scared to reach over and grip his hand, so he stayed pressed against the tree, heart beating wildly in his chest.
“That’s not true, Dean. We both know that.” Cas took a deep breath.
“I don’t know.” Dean muttered.
“My father showed up at work today looking for me.” Dean buried his face in Cas’s neck, just wanting to be close to him. He felt Cas’s body tense and his breath hitch, and he worried for a second that he had done something wrong. “Is that why you came? Because you’re scared to go home?” Dean nodded.
“I-I… I, um, w-well, I just…” He trailed off and really couldn’t think of anything to say. He didn’t want to tell the truth because he was so embarrassed and nervous, but he knew if he lied Cas would just be confused. Cas was already confused, though.
Dean stayed still for about two minutes after, and Cas just held them as they stood up. When Dean finally started to stir, Cas held his breath.
“Hey buddy! You wanna go to the Diner for dinner? Uncle Bobby’s gonna be there!” Sam excitedly jumped up and into Dean’s arms, letting out a scream of happiness. Dean smiled and grabbed his car keys.
“I did not see that memory. Should I legally change my name to make him happy?” Dean couldn’t help but laugh that time too. “You’d have a hard time as a teacher.” Castiel laughed even harder, and Dean could literally feel the tension leaving his body.
Dean mumbled something incoherent, and Cas just sighed. “Dean, honey, wake up!” He exclaimed, and finally Dean’s eyes opened. He reached up and grabbed his chest, sitting up straight in bed. He looked around, fear in his eyes, until he saw Cas. A little pang of love went through Cas’s heart when Dean’s eyes softened.
They managed to get to Dean’s apartment, Dean practically entangled in Mr. Novak’s limbs with Sam following closely behind. Dean got the door open, and they flooded into Dean’s little, but homey apartment. “Go to bed, buddy.” Dean just managed to lean down and lovingly tap Sam’s head and send him off to bed. Cas practically dragged Dean to the couch, plopping him there and looking at him. “Do you have a thermometer?” Cas asked gently, and Dean nodded, weakly pointing to the bathroom.
Dean cut her off.
Jo was washing his face off, Bobby was making sure he was staying up, and Garth put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Ellen watched around to make sure that nothing was going to attack.
“I can drive him!” They were all startled by the anonymous voice, but Dean almost instantly knew who it was. He closed his eyes as tightly as he could, pressing down on them with his fingers. “That would be great.” Jo chimed in, and Ellen looked a little bit confused. “That’s Dean’s English teacher.” Ellen looked a bit more relieved.
“Dean, you give me so much. You make me smile. You make me laugh. You make me feel like I have a reason to be on this earth, to be here with you. You do not take from me. You add to me. I don’t want to hear that again, and I will remind you everyday.” Dean wiped his eyes free of the tears, and nodded at Cas.
“Dean, please let me-” A loud ringing cut off Mr. Novak’s voice and Dean’s throat suddenly felt like it was closing up. Dean looked up at his eyes, and before he knew it, tears were streaming down his bruised face and they wouldn’t stop. Cas’s heart broke, and a feeling of dread spread through his body. “Dean,” He choked out, causing Dean to feel even more panic through his body.
“It’s bad to have a crush on a teacher, it’s even worse to have him first thing in the morning!” She laughed, shoving it in his face. Dean shot her daggers, but ultimately smiled. “Hey, at least it’s a normal problem, right?” Charlie asked, rubbing his arm. Dean groaned again.
There was nowhere Dean could go. Did he need to go park in the woods and sleep there? That was probably the next best option. He was in fight or flight mode right now, his stomach twisted and twirled
“Karen was my soulmate. But, I don’t think that’s why you’re asking… Did you find your soulmate, Dean?” Dean blushed darkly, reaching up and covering his cheeks. Bobby laughed a little bit.
“Sam told me he wants your name to be Cookie Nonster.” He smiled as Castiel burst out laughing. His hand squeezed Dean’s a little tighter.
He was being carried out of the house, and into the cool night air where there wasn’t a piercing roar in his ears or a blazing light. Dean faded in and out, but he thought he heard people’s voices. He couldn’t understand what they were saying or even register the words, until-
But, Sam went willingly today, grabbing his backpack and toddling into the school. “Bye daddy!” He shouted behind him, disappearing into the building. Dean sighed softly, shutting the door and getting back in the driver’s side.
Hi guys, I just wanna say thanks so much for reading and commenting and leaving all your kudos, it means so much to me <3 If you ever want to request something, you can leave an ask at my tumblr <3
He heard Dean turn on the sink, presumably to wash his face, and Cas waited with his breath caught in his throat. Dean filled a cup of water, and drank it all, trying to hydrate himself a little before he had to go face Cas. He cursed himself for acting like this, when he could have acted like everything was fine. He could have just come in and said that he wanted to sleep over, or he could have left and slept in his car. This is absolutely not what he wanted. Dean took a deep breath and turned off the sink, and walked to the door. He set his hand on it, cautiously turning it.
“I’m just-” Dean was cut off with the burden of having to duck below his father’s balled fist, and with as many times as he had to do this, it just felt normal. “I just have to get clothes.” Dean slunk past his father, running up the stairs into his old room and grabbing the rest of his clothes. He could hear his father stomping up the stairs after him, and he rushed out of Sam’s room, ignoring the empty bottles of whisky and vodka.
“It’s just… So much information to take in. And I don’t… want to go to my apartment yet…” Dean had no reason to be saying all of this truth, but it kind of just felt right to say at the moment. Castiel nodded in agreement.
The bell at the door rang and Dean turned his head and was greeted with a perfectly disheveled Castiel.
“I should get going anyway.” Gabe closed his book and stood up, and Cas let out a deep breath.
Dean paced around Cas’s room for about a half an hour before Castiel made him sit down. Dean didn’t want to go to the diner, didn’t want to explain any of this. He was imagining all the things that could happen, all of the ways they could respond. And he thought about Sam. Would Sam grow up with Cas, a half angel?
“Yay I get to see Lucy! And Mrs. Milton!” Sam exclaimed, hopping out of his seat and grabbing his homework folder. Dean grabbed Sam’s extra clothes, water bottle, and lunch and shoved it in his backpack. Dean grabbed his backpack and his car keys, then shut his apartment up and watched as Sam ran down the stairs to the car.
“Dean!” Cas shouted, only barely able to see him. “Please, please,” He mumbled, hoping that Dean would stop, but Dean kept going. He did everything in his power to get Dean to stop but Dean was too far away.
Dean walked out of the room with Sammy in his arms and made eye contact with Mr. Novak and briefly looked confused. Realization then crossed his face and he visibly relaxed, walking over to the couch and settling down, Sammy wrapped in his arms. Cas went over and cautiously sat next to the two, and Dean debated putting his head on his shoulder but decided against it.
Dean quickly launched forward and wrapped his arms around Cas’s torso. Castiel responded as quickly as lightning, drawing him into his body and squeezing him tight.
“Sammy usually sleeps for about an hour when he naps like this, so I’ll set an alarm for forty five minutes.” Dean set the alarm on his phone and crawled into bed while Cas walked into the bathroom. Dean rubbed his face and pulled the blankets up over him, not feeling as weird as he thought he should. Cas came out of the bathroom and smiled gently when he saw Dean all curled up under the blankets.
Gabe actually looked worried as Castiel approached him. “What’s wrong?” Gabe furrowed his eyebrows and Castiel unlocked the door, pushing him inside.
to avoid telling Cas what had happened. He felt the guilt, felt the shame, felt everything Dean had felt from the minute he had showed up on his doorstep, to right now. Where he felt scared. And ashamed.
your soul mate's pain. That's what I had to do and I just couldn't do it anymore. ”
“No, it… I-I want to do it again.” Dean finally got it out, and Cas tilted his head a little bit.
“Well what, Ellen? I already told you. He’s a nephilim. You’re going to have to be more specific than that.” Dean was getting a little snappy, and Ellen drew back a little bit with the look on her face.
The silence settled in heavily, and Dean wanted to break it but everytime he tried, his throat would swell up and he would get all flustered. Mr. Novak gave a quick, bright smile towards Dean and Dean gave a half-hearted one back, trying his hardest. Mr. Novak took it gracefully, but when he went to go sit back at his desks, images of the boy’s soft, scarred skin kept popping into his head that he could not seem to shake out.
Dean curled up a little more, trying to go through this wave of nausea without an issue.
“I’m so sorry you had to deal with that, Dean. I felt how scared you were. What…” Cas took in a deep breath, trying to control himself. “What you thought he would do to you if he found you.” Dean shuddered, remembering that as well.
“They are safe. They found safety while you fell unconscious. I got you out the house and they met up with us out there. I told them that I would take care of you and they shouldn’t worry.” Dean knew he should be asking more questions but he didn’t have the mental capacity right now.
“Daddy’s stomach hurts.” Sam nodded at Cas, and Dean laughed a little bit. “Daddy’s stomach hurts a lot. Can you help me get off so I don’t hurt him?” Sam reached his arms out to Cas, and Cas reached forward immediately and set him on the ground. Sam ran over to the living room, and grabbed his legos to play on the floor. Dean watched him and smiled a little bit, thankful for such an intuitive little brother.
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat.
“I didn’t say I saw a real therapist.” Dean assured, and Cas rolled his eyes.
Sammy was set up at the table in the corner with all the coloring books he could have, his blanky, and Jo and himself would go over there as often as possible to make sure he was okay and entertained. Sam was such a good boy, and Dean was so proud that he could at least comprehend that he had to be on best behaviour the whole day. Dean kept a close eye on him, always, despite the fact that he was so well behaved. Dean sighed, turning away and trying to keep his cool.
“Well, that sounds like a you problem, buddy.” Gabe went back to looking at his book, but Cas had this feeling in his stomach that he couldn’t ignore. He could not pinpoint what it was.
“DEAN!” Dean abruptly heard a voice from above him, and he was being picked up. He clung to whomever -or whatever- was picking him up as tight as he could, not opening his eyes. His fingers grabbed his savior’s clothes and balled it up, trying to distract from the pain. Everything on his body hurt.
Bobby soon joined him. “We should get out of here, Dean. And look at that weapon.” Dean shook his head, still out of it. “He called it an angel blade. Said it came from… angels.” Dean spoke, and Bobby huffed.
Graduation was in a week and although Dean had already moved, they were looking for a house out in Colorado. Dean had some friends out there and Cas had always loved the mountains, so they decided to go there. They also had nothing to lose. Cas’s lease was up in four months so they had already begun to look for houses.
“Now we can finally translate the tablet that Dad left us.” Gabriel nodded, taking a deep breath. “I still need to find one more book for the Demon tablet. But you can start on the Angel one.” Cas nodded.
The man in front of him facepalmed. “Yes, yes. Shit I’m sorry. Castiel Novak. Mr. Novak. I’m his brother, Gabe, and I just need to give him this stupid book-” He held out a book on translating Enochian and Dean pursed his lips.
Castiel stopped him right there. “He’s a senior, and he’s actually nineteen. So, yes, he’s legal.” Gabe wagged his eyebrows. “So you’ve looked.”
All of Cas’s memories flashed before his eyes; his big family, loving dad, an absent mother, piano, books, four years of college, fun memories with roommates, but then he saw snaps of something he wasn’t expecting. Stuff like his stuff. He saw a demon, or two, but he couldn’t really be sure. Then they just continued. Dean felt happy, and light, and he could tell that Cas had a life that was worth living. Loving brothers, a loving sister, dogs, cats, just everything that Dean had never had.
“The third thing is, the second you feel like you are a burden to me, that you are
“You can look.” Dean croaked into his neck, and Cas’s grace immediately took over Dean’s body. He saw that morning, when Dean was worrying about rent. Cas was so confused that Dean could feel it through his grace. He saw Dean call Ellen, tell her that he needed about one hundred extra bucks to make rent. Ellen said to come in that night, and he could feel Dean think about lying to himself. Cas held onto Dean a little tighter, and Dean shut his eyes as tight as he could.
Cas sat next to Dean on the couch, heaving a sigh. He leaned over and pressed his lips against Dean’s forehead and slipped his hands up his shirt, helping him take it off. “Turn around.” Cas demanded, and Dean closed his eyes as he turned around and showed Cas his bruised back.
“For about two years after he would drag Dean on these hunts for the demon that killed his mom, but Dean would just get hurt. And he’d have to scramble to find a safe place for Sam while he hunted. Then his father would leave him wherever, making him find his own way back home. Now, his father just beats him senseless whenever he sees him. Last time he actually,” Cas shuttered and he felt physically ill.
“Really? Did you see anything else like our stuff?” Jo asked, and Dean shrugged. “I only saw demons. But, he didn’t say anything about what he saw in my memories. He didn’t even seem surprised. He was mostly just…” Dean coughed, closing his eyes. “Upset about everything else.”
“You asking me to move in with you?” Dean’s words were a little slurred and Cas laughed a bit. “Maybe when you’re well rested I’ll ask again.” Dean settled back into Cas. “It’ll get us ready for when we move to Colorado.” Dean couldn’t help but smile because he would be far away from his father and close to the man he loved.
“Although many of your memories were not happy, I can feel how you take the best of your hardships. I felt your undying love for Sam, your devotion to Bobby and everyone at your workplace, your willingness to protect and help others without even knowing them, and your sheer ability to move on. I… may suggest later on that we talk to a professional about them,” Cas may have powers, but not the powers to help Dean cope with his father’s abuse. He’d need a lot of help with that. “But you are truly an amazing person. I could see that.”
Ellen flinched, reaching her hand out and setting it on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, Dean. Did you guys talk about it?” Dean shook his head vehemently.
Jo went out there and he could hear the gruff voice of his father saying, “Where is that boy?” Dean practically sprinted into the back room and grabbed Sam, shushing him to make sure he wouldn’t make any noise.
“No… I don’t think so. Garth told me that Ellen has been tracking a wendigo about an hour away, but that’s really it. I’ve heard nothing about deals.” Dean always tried to be quiet when talking about hunts around Sam.
Castiel was confused and scared, but he knew Dean did not have malintent.
“Half-angel. Nephilim, he calls himself. Same with his brothers. His father was an angel. Mom was a human.” The silence that fell on the room was nothing like Dean had experienced with these particular people before.
Dean’s heart jumped into his throat as Cas gingerly pressed his lips onto his. He quickly pulled back, however, leaving Dean wide eyed. The farthest they had gone was kissing, maybe a little making out, but something about this left Dean’s stomach fluttering with butterflies. He promptly shook them away and responded.
Cas reached his arms out and grabbed Dean’s shoulders, pulling him into a hug. Dean tensed for a second, but after a good moment, he melted into Cas. Cas took a deep breath, hugging Dean tighter.
“We can go to your diner? We can meet there at seven. And you choose whether or not to bring Sam.” Cas suggested, and Dean nodded enthusiastically. Dean could not believe how understanding and kind Cas was being to him about the whole thing. He was endlessly grateful, but still surprised.
“Next time I’ll text you so you won’t worry.” Dean looked up through his eyelashes to look at Cas’s eyes, and Cas looked down at him fondly.
Castiel sighed and rubbed his face over his forehead.
“You ready?” Ellen whispered, and everyone gave their signals. Jo kicked the door open and Ellen and Bobby went first with all of the others following. Inside, the room was completely dark and they couldn’t see anything. Garth got his lighter out, lighting it so they could see.
“What if I just…” Dean trailed off, truly out of ideas. The truth was probably the best thing in this case.
Dean was mumbling in his sleep, and although Cas couldn’t hear the whole thing, he got bits and pieces. He heard Sam’s name, and he heard Dad, but that was about all he could get. He decided he had to end this.
“Dean we should totally-” Jo was cut off by the sound of little Sam getting up and making a noise of discontent. “What’s wrong bud?” Dean asked, and Sam ran over and climbed into Dean’s lap. Dean laughed and held the extremely tired child in his arms and Jo continued. “-take a road trip when we graduate. You, me, Mama, and Sammy and maybe Charlie and I don’t know-” Dean listened to her rambling as she went on about road trips. Once she was finished, her and Ellen started arguing about where they wanted to go, and that’s about when Dean spaced out.
“Hi, my name is Dean,” Dean spoke cheerily, keeping the fake smile plastered up on his lips. “-and I’ll be your server today. Can I start you off with something to drink?” He looked down, his eyes being totally cut off by Mr. Novak’s bright blue eyes looking up at him. Dean immediately took a step back, planning a quick escape, but then shaking his head. “Dean?” Mr. Novak’s eyes sparkled up at him with confusion, and perhaps a tint of worry. “Hi Mr. Novak.” Dean shyly looked to the ground, swallowing roughly.
“It seems like an invasion of privacy, I know. I promise you it’s not intentional. I think my father had something to do with it, though I’m not sure what. But when my oldest brother met his soulmate, my father seemed extremely… worried, and had some big talk with him. Michael is the only one who’s met his soulmate. Well-” Cas flashed a smile at Dean. “Now the two of us. Lucifer and Gabriel have not.”
“Dean. You need to go now.” Dean hopped off the counter, landing on both of his feet. “John is here. He’s looking for you. I told him I haven’t seen you in months, heard you went out west. Go out the back. Jo can bring you your other stuff at school tomorrow.” Dean’s heart was straight up in his throat.
“What’s a soulmate?” Once Sam was settled and strapped in, Sam asked. Dean stopped to think about it. “It’s the person you’re supposed to spend the rest of your life with. The person you’re supposed to love and marry.”
He sat on the edge of the bed, setting a hand on Dean’s bare-skinned arm. A blue light emerged from Cas’s hand and wrapped around Dean’s body, healing every single ailment. Dean moved in his sleep, but Cas was sure it was just due to the momentarily uncomfortable sting that can be brought on by healing.
“How did you figure this much out? I just saw you like five days ago and none of this stuff was here.” Dean asked, but Bobby simply shook his head. He pointed to a picture on the wall of a dark haired man. Dean, although in Cas’s memories he had only seen Lucifer as a young kid, could see how it could be Cas’s brother. Dean grimaced.
He snuck into school, ignoring the glaring secretary. He always got that glare when he was late so he was used to it by now. He went off to his third period class, hoping not to get called out or noticed. It was obvious that wasn’t going to happen when he met eyes with Castiel, who was walking down the hallway.
He sighed and went to stand up but he felt Dean stir in his sleep, so he waited another moment to not disturb him. Dean, however, did not get that memo and sat up in bed. He looked confused and Castiel froze and held his breath.
It was a mind numbingly silent ride to Dean’s apartment, as Dean sat in the front next to Cas and Sam was curled up in the back seat. Dean wanted to make conversation, he felt like he owed that to Cas, but whenever he would try his throat would close up and butterflies would swarm through his entire body. He was sick, as well. His head throbbed with an oncoming migraine, and his stomach swirled with what was most commonly known as nausea.
Dean ran over and grabbed Sam out of Cas’s arms, and Sam excitedly wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. “Sammy,” Dean scolded, trying to ignore Mr. Novak for the second. “I told you to say keep up with me. Did you walk off?” Sam simply put his head on Dean’s shoulder and stayed quiet, causing Dean to sigh. “I’m sorry, I really am.” Dean said and tried his absolute hardest to avoid eye contact with him, knowing that Dean hadn’t acknowledged the conversation they had had about the bruises. Cas cleared his throat, and Dean’s eyes flashed up to his.
“Do you have your marking?” Mr. Novak blurted out, and Dean flinched. He knew that this is what it would come down to. He wanted to lie, was planning to lie, but he couldn’t when he looked into Mr. Novak’s eyes.
“I say we go to a crossroad and summon a demon. Then we perform an exorcism and hopefully that’ll keep it away.” Bobby fiddled with his map and Dean leaned over, pointing to the only crossroad he knew about. Dean looked out the window, setting his head on the side of the car door.
Ellen ran out almost immediately, hearing the commotion, and looked at Dean with a sad face. “It’s okay baby. I’ll go get you some water.” Dean leaned forward and grabbed his stomach, closing his eyes tightly and pretending that none of this was happening. He grimaced as a jolt of pain shot through his head, and he knew he was sick.
i know it's short but i'm still terrible and still love you
“What are you doing here?” Dean pulled back, moving his legs to stand up. He was so shaky though that he couldn’t support his weight. He fell forward, back onto Cas, and Cas caught him.
“That’s okay. We’ll talk about it later.” Cas turned the light off and snuggled back in with Dean, hoping that he would at least hint at what his dream was actually about in the morning.
“What’s going on over there?” Cas had pancakes in the oven keeping warm, and the pan was still hot. Dean’s stomach growled, and Cas smiled brightly.
“If you’re lucky.” Dean hopped down from his desk, gave him a quick pat on the chest and turned to walk out the door. “See you tonight!”
“How come you got to see my whole life, but I didn’t get to see yours?” Dean passed his previous comment before Cas could say anything. Cas looked like he thought for a second, and then reached his hand and set it on Dean’s.
“Okay. I’ll be there in like an hour, because I have to drop Sam off at school. Whatever you’re involved in, I don’t want him anywhere near that.” Dean exhaled, but Bobby didn’t really care.
“Please? Give me something?” Cas asked, and Dean got tired of his probing. Dean sighed, and simply leaned forward and pressed his lips to Cas’s. Cas grumbled in his mouth for a second, and Dean just pressed harder.
“He’s encountered entirely too many demons. I plan to never have him near one again.” Gabriel laughed a little bit.
“What are you thinking?” Cas inquired softly, and Dean’s breath caught in his throat.
He got out of the car and picked Sam up, holding him close to his body as his nerves made him shake. He was so nervous and so sorry to be knocking on Cas’s door at ten o’clock at night without any warning. He really hated going to Cas’s when he was emotionally vulnerable  or scared and he avoided it at all costs, especially out of nowhere.
The door opened, and he was met with an extremely pale, worried-looking Cas. Dean’s bottom lip wobbled for a second, but Cas had made him feel a little better with his grace and presence.
“Thanks Bobby.” He muttered, looking back out the window and Bobby couldn’t help but smile at him.
“Why do you not like the idea?” Cas asked, curious but understanding. Dean bit his bottom lip hard, eyebrows furrowed.
“Is that Dean Winchester?” Cas asked his waitress quietly and politely, and Jo looked back to look at him. “Oh yeah, that is him.” Cas took this as a chance to try to gain some insight, as Gabe suggestively wagged his eyebrows at him. “Does he work here?” He asked, and Jo smiled a bit and nodded. “Yeah, full time outta school. Helps him with rent.” Cas noted that Dean even had to pay rent, unlike most high schoolers. “How d’ya know him?” Cas cleared his throat.
“Daddy,” Dean turned to him, shaking off his hunger, giving him his full attention. “What are the letters on your wrist? My teacher has them too.” Dean smiled softly, knowing this day would come eventually. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t prepared for it.
Dean managed to grab the holy water out of his pocket and keep it close. He splashed his own face, hoping to keep himself from being possessed. The demons seemed to not want them, though. They barely even cared about the humans. Dean watched as a constant stream of blackness found its way upstairs.
Dean shot up in bed, heart racing out of his chest. He was on his feet in a matter of seconds as he searched the room and made sure nothing was there. His eyes landed on the clothes that were neatly folded on the side of the bed and he let out a shaky breath remembering the events of the night before. He looked at a clock and it flashed 5:15am.
“Shh, Charlie!” He scolded, pushing her towards his car, covering her mouth. They got in his car, and Charlie screamed again. “No way! This is so weird! How old is he even? You’re lucky you’re lega-”
“Breakfast.” Dean responded, barely able to even get that word out. Cas agreed wholeheartedly. “Pancakes.” Dean whispered again and Cas was just so excited that they were there together that he would have said yes to anything.
hunt makes me feel physically ill. I would never let you get hurt, let alone killed.” Cas could feel himself going on and on and on but he didn’t think Dean minded. Maybe Dean even liked this positive attention for a change.
Cas lunged forward and wrapped himself tightly around Dean.
“What on earth is an angel blade?” Garth asked, breaking the silence that had fallen over the group.
“I’ll just get you guys some water.” She went off and Dean bit his lip. “She’s always like this.” Dean mumbled, trying to get over this embarrassment. “That’s okay. She’s quite delightful, actually.”
Dean managed to make his way to school while thinking about a million other things on his mind. He parked his car and grabbed his stuff, getting out.
“I know.” Dean murmured, gritting his teeth. “I just… don’t want to. It was all a little too much.” Cas huffed out in a little bit of annoyance, but he could still understand. He just wish Dean would talk to him more than he does.
“Don’t ever think that. We can work past this, Dean. We can get through this and live our life.”
just a STEM major who writes her frustrations out i know this may not be perfect but thank you guys so much for all your support!!! much love
“Anytime I will be here for you. Goodnight, Dean. Sleep well.” Cas leaned down and pressed his lips to Dean’s forehead, and slipped out of the house with the thought of Dean sticking around for a long, long time.
“He has nothing to do with this. You stay as far away from him as you can.” Cas growled, and Dean put his arms out and ushered everyone else out of the room.
Dean noted that he really didn’t feel well. His stomach hurt and his head throbbed, and he got a sudden wave of fatigue that urged him to lean forward and set his head on the table. He let his eyes close as their voices soothed his never ending nerves. Before he knew it, he was fast asleep, with a little sleeping Sammy in his arms as well.
“Huh. That’s weird. Meet me at the Diner? Jo can watch Sam while we hunt and I can pay for your dinners.” Bobby really knew how to talk to Dean.
Gabriel answered the phone with an exacerbated voice.
“I’m in love with you, Cas.” Cas’s heart stopped. “What?” Cas’s stomach filled with butterflies and he was so surprised by Dean’s tired confession. “I’m so in love with you it hurts.” Dean murmured and Cas pulled back. “No way. You just sleepily confessed your love for me. I thought it was gonna be way more complicated than this.” Dean laughed, even though he didn’t quite know what he was laughing at he was so tired.
Dean really considered just turning the other way and pretending that he didn’t see him, but it was too late for that. Castiel gave him a soft smile, but there was a crease in his eyebrows that Dean could identify as worry.
He smiled nervously and set the stuff down on the table besides the couch, and looked at Dean. “It took forever, I know, I’m sorry.” He smiled apologetically and Dean simply shook his head. Dean almost stared at him in awe- nobody had cared for him like this since his mother was alive, it was almost like he forgot what it was. “Th-thank you…” Dean looked down, folding his hands together and blushing as bright as a tomato. Mr. Novak gently placed his hand on Dean's shoulder, noting the subtle flinch that Dean had whenever he even moved towards him.
He reached over and grabbed his phone, seeing four missed calls, all from Ellen and Bobby. “Fuck.” Dean groaned and fell back into the bed, dialing Bobby’s number and putting the phone up to his ear. The phone rang a couple of times, and Dean was met with a very concerned Bobby.
“If there are other nephilims, why… why aren’t you soulmates with them?” Cas sat up suddenly and started Dean.
“Sammy!” They both heard Dean shout, and Sam started squirming. “That’s him!” Sam exclaimed, and Cas ran to the end of the aisle and met eyes with the one and only Dean Winchester. Dean paled for a quick second, but then visibly slumped in relief when he saw Sam. It all connected in Cas’s head now; this was the little kid that Dean had held at the restaurant he worked at. But had he called him daddy? Cas must’ve imagined that.
“You want me to heal you again?” Cas asked, a little confused. Dean felt the blood rush to his face and Cas could feel the heat coming from Dean’s body.
“You have to sleep, Bobby, you can’t do this to yourself.” Bobby gave him a forlorn look, and Dean just gave him a sad smile.
“Who is this guy?” Bobby asked, and Dean wanted to hit his head against the window. Dean looked at him. “It’s my stupid English teacher.”
“We talked a little bit about Sam. He mentioned the money issues I’ve been having, and how concerned he was about me not eating anything. He didn’t mention John, but he did acknowledge that I had family issues. He made it very clear that he wouldn’t pressure me into anything and I can set everything at my own pace.”
He knew this was going to happen one day. He knew it was going to be like this, and he considered himself lucky that he wasn’t in the room when his dad came in.
“You look cute when you do that.” He smiled and Dean laughed a little bit.
“This is Sam.” Dean took the chance to introduce Sam. Castiel smiled and gave a small wave.
“No,” Dean started, reaching up and rubbing his eyes. “He hurt me pretty bad. That’s where I got all the scrapes and broke the rib. I was trying to exorcise him. Then…” Dean trailed off, and Cas knew that this was the information he would need.
“Mama I really want to go to Colora-” Jo was cut off by the bell that was attached to the door, and she immediately got up to greet them. “Hi guys! Welcome to the roadhouse, are you guys coming in for dinner or just drinks?”
Ellen popped her head out of the kitchen towards the end, trying to get a good look at Castiel.
“What?” Castiel asked, and stepped out on the front step. Dean gave him a little smile, but with his pale face and the emotions he was projecting, he knew that was not a real smile.
“I’m fine. Just… lonely, and bored. Got into all this stuff and I haven’t slept in a couple days, and-” Dean cut him off by putting both hands on his shoulder.
“I know. That was horrifying. I have never seen him look like that. If Dad was here-” Castiel took a sharp breath in and decided not to finish that sentence. “What are we going to do? What happened after?”
“Cas, did you heal me? Like, a couple nights ago or whatever. I woke up and everything that hurt the night before didn’t hurt anymore.” Dean tried not to make it sound like an accusation, but that’s really what it sounded like. Cas tried to find a way to fix it all.
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Dean’s small voice responded, and Cas stood up and they made their way over to the bedroom. Dean lifted up the corner of the blanket and slid in to cuddle up and Cas made a noise.
Cas reluctantly walked over to Dean and set a hand on the back of his neck, and Dean froze up. Cas held his breath until Dean lifted his head and looked up at him with red, tear stained eyes and Cas bit his lip. Dean suddenly shot up out of his seat, trying to hold in the tears, but failing. Tears streamed down his face, and he shook his head. “I-I’m sorry…” Dean trailed off, and Cas shook his head. “Don’t ever, ever be sorry Dea-” Dean launched forward and wrapped his arms around Cas’s torso, and Cas almost immediately reacted.
“I see a therapist.” Dean shrugged, trying not to think about the compliments, and Castiel scowled at him.
Dean cleared his throat to keep the tears from forming in his eyes. “Okay, Cas. We can talk abou this. John just have me so wrapped around his little finger that I feel like he can snap at a single moment and everything I love will be gone.”
“It’s very nice to meet you, Sam.” Castiel spoke softly and Sam giggled into Dean’s shoulder. Dean picked him up and placed him back on the ground. “Go give the spatula back. Ellen can’t cook without it!” Dean gestured back to the kitchen and he was actually surprised when he ran off.
He decided to take one quick look and was horrified to find that Dean was dreaming about his father chasing him. Cas reached up and rubbed his eyes, knowing that he had to fix this.
“Of course I can! Want me to pick him up from daycare?” She bit into the apple, and Dean nodded enthusiastically. He reached forward and grabbed her into a hug, and she had to laugh. She hugged him tighter, taking in the moment. She had never been with Dean when he was this happy and carefree. She couldn’t even recall a time that Dean had willingly hugged her.
“Yeah, Lucifer’s done some weird things. Been coming up a lot recently in our research.” She shot Dean a look, and Dean scrunched his eyebrows together. He wasn’t quite sure he knew what she was getting at, but he knew it had to be part of a hunt.
“Bye baby, be safe. Don’t go home tonight, go somewhere else. Maybe Cas’s. He’ll look at ours. Lock up behind yourself.” Ellen kissed Dean’s cheek and pushed him out the door. Dean rushed to the car and strapped Sam into his kiddie seat. “Daddy? What’s going on?”
Dean was already fearful. Cas could feel that. He could feel the way Dean thought Cas was just going to abandon him because of his past. Dean thought that Cas was going to leave him in the dust, to make him go back to his father, to make him hurt more than he already did. Cas not only planned to never, ever leave Dean, but he already vowed never to let anything touch him ever again.
Dean’s jaw clenched. Things like this don’t just happen, especially to people like him. Maybe if he was normal, he would call it a miracle, and go on with his day, but he couldn’t do that. He knew he had really hurt his chest and last night before he went to bed he clearly remembered the sharp, lingering pain.
“I saw a lot, Dean. Enough to know that it was a complete violation of the privacy you wanted.” Castiel sounded guilty, and then Dean felt guilty that he was making Cas feel like that. “It’s not your fault-” Cas cut Dean off.
“Whatever, Dean! Just get here!”
“Sammy baby it’s time to go to school.” Dean shook Sam gently and the groan that came out of his mouth made Dean laugh. “Cas made pancakes for brea-” Dean didn’t even have to finish the sentence before Sam shot off the couch and into the kitchen, into his normal seat. “Goodmorning.” Cas laughed as he brought his plate over and set it on the table.
“It’s happening every night,” Jo added in. “Someone else goes missing. We can’t find any links at all. Just random people, randomly getting possessed.” Dean took it all in, knowing that something was going to happen, but ready for it.
“It’s alright. I was just worried that something had happened.” Cas confided, and Dean laughed, brushing a hand through his hair.
“You okay, Dean?” Bobby asked, starting the car and pulling out of the parking lot. Dean sighed heavily. “I don’t know…” Dean responded, closing his eyes. “Was Karen your soulmate?” Bobby was blindsided by the question.
“Dean,” Cas pleaded, reaching down to grab his chin, but Dean resisted. Cas’s concern was at a whole new level, because he’d always been able to console Dean. Even that night a month ago. This was something much deeper.
“I know you’re scared, but I’m sure…” He looked at Dean, reaching out a comforting hand. “He’s probably been through stuff too, Dean. It’s okay. You guys were made for each other. He can work past whatever you give him.” Dean blushed darker, kind of embarrassed to be getting a lecture.
Dean could not believe his soulmate was half-angel. Half-something Dean didn’t even believe existed for the last nineteen years of his life. Cas liked him, too. Cas seemed to genuinely care about him, and how is something that
