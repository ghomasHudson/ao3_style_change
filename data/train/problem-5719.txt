Carol’s lips part but Tony beats her to the punch.
“Then, they’re idiots too. Shallow idiots.”
“My boyfriend,” Steve repeats warmly like he’s genuinely talking about the love of his life. “Tony looks beautiful tonight, doesn’t he? I mean he always does but you know, tonight's—”
Tony ignores them, his eyes sparkling with pure joy. Or at least, something close to it.
hate. Dad wouldn’t stop comparing me to him and fuck, I hate him too. Fucking asshole.”
“I’m pretty sure
His hand's shaking as he tugs the blanket down to check on his heart, his repulsor pump, before resting his fingers at his pulse point.
Steve blinks, his lips parting to speak when Tony beats him to the punch.
Steve pauses, his blazer halfway off his shoulders. “What?”
He shrugs on his leather jacket, pulls on the tightest pair of jeans he owns, and heads to the nearest club he can find.
“Wait, what?” Steve says out loud. No one seems to notice his outburst.
“We don’t even have any plans!”
,” Tony corrects him. “I kiss people when they give me coffee. ”
Steve’s eat-shitting grin widens. “I don’t need proof. I’m Captain America.”
Or Steve.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs. “Hey, look at me.”
He wonders if Rhodey knows. Pepper. Carol. He doubts his heart could take it if they actually do.
“Freya?” Tony squeaks. “Freya as in the goddess Freya?”
It takes a while to get him to warm up to Steve. A lot of cookies thrust his way. A lot of doodles stashed in nooks. A lot of invitations down to the playground where they could play pirates.
The arm around Tony immediately disappears.
“So,” Tony begins, “which one’s your favorite?”
The hope on Tony’s face instantly vanishes. He hastily jumps to his feet, brushing the blades of grass clinging to his pants. “I knew this was a bad idea. I mean, you definitely took it as a joke and you totally didn’t mean to—”
“He shouldn’t.”
Tony shrugs his shoulders, taking a sip of his coke. “Don’t be. Never wanted to be a part of that. Sides’, it’s not SI anymore.”
Steve would say something like, “He's the man who revolutionized green energy,” or “New York not being underwater right now? All Tony. He saved the city on his own,” and Tony would be shambles, blushing beet red.
“Still a stick in the mud, huh?”
Or maybe not.
And that’s when he realizes one thing Tony hasn’t bothered to bring up.
Natasha crosses her arms in front of her. “Do I have to spell it out for you?”
Thankfully, Tony doesn’t follow.
“—and also the fact that you’re apparently crushing on me and never said a word—”
Steve steels himself, taking in a deep breath. It’s fine. He’ll get over it. He’s always pegged Tony as unattainable, anyway. As long as Tony’s happy, Steve’s happy.
“Danvers,” Steve says shortly, his brow creased. It’s the same frown he shot Reed and Hammer not long ago. “I didn’t expect you to be here.”
“It was,” Tony agrees, his hands splayed over the keys in front of him. “Remind me to show you The Fantasticks one day. But if this is your plan on getting me to sing again—”
Thor goes next, claiming seniority because of course, he does. No one bothers to argue because he’s the God of Thunder.
Tony ignores him, fixating on the hundredth tabloid headline about him and Steve on the screen in front of him instead.
As he steps away from the spotlight, the crowd before him shifts, masking Steve from his sight. But Tony has his spot pinned down the moment he gave his speech. He’s pretty sure he’s—
He doesn’t think about how Tony should be pinning him to the couch and kissing the life out of him.
“I— No. Just let them in. They wouldn’t let me hear the end of it if I don’t.”
“I mean, he isn’t entirely wrong,” Tony replies. “I mean, out of all the toy lines, I think we’re the best examples of that.”
Once again, all eyes are on him. A snicker fills the awkward pause. Steve makes another note to triple the drills for Clint.
“Tony—”
She purses her lips. “That you think you don’t deserve anything good.”
Steve stills for a moment. “You want to stay engaged?”
With a freaking ring inside.
Island?”
Steve follows after Tony’s descent, the notes coming from his fingertips deepening, the melody turning languid and longing. Intimate and forlorn.
“Do I need a reason to play?” Tony counters half-jokingly. Once again, Steve’s eyebrows frown in suspicion and concern. Tony almost caves in. “Needed a distraction and I didn’t feel like tinkering. This is the next best thing.”
“And pray tell, what’s in my head?”
Tony snorts. “They’re both the same.”
But that doesn’t matter. Tony’s type isn’t from the army.
Tony grins. “It’s a really good pun.”
“It’ll heal.”
“Clint’s room?”
Steve huffs in frustration as Link swerves off the map for the millionth time. He doesn’t usually suck at Mario Kart but for some reason, he’s finding it hard to concentrate.
Now they sit in the same booth, waiting for their order in awkward silence as some indie song spins above their heads and drunk patrons scream at the top of their lungs.
“I know. Still, I shouldn’t have—”
Steve frowns. “Explain—”
Tony cocks his head to the side. “About a hundred cans of beer left in the pantry? Yup.”
She’s as beautiful as ever, dressed in a dress shirt and jeans, her blonde hair tied up in a ponytail, and a smile that could light up a whole city. Out of all the few people he’s dated, Sharon’s his favorite. It probably helps that they started out friends before Steve asked her out.
“Yes,” Tony blurts out. “I’d love that. Yes. Everyone misses you terribly, including Jarvis.”
“Yeah. If you’re into endangering the whole mythical community.”
“And your dad?”
“Down to the gym?”
“Absolutely. One hundred percent idiotic fools. So, if you’d—”
Reed hums. “When Susan first asked me out, I remember being puzzled. She could have anyone but she chose me and she continues to choose to stay with me after everything. After what I’ve done to her. The mistakes—”
“Technically it is,” Jan points out, cheeky smile on.
Okay, so she’s pretty
“Yeah?”
Now that she’s facing him, the stranger’s features strike a chord in him but not strong enough to help put a name to her face. Maybe he’s seen her in pictures or the paper. Maybe he’s passed her by on the street or a coffee shop or even at the bar a couple blocks away.
“Actually, he’s with me.”
“—to drink coffee. I know, I know. You’ll tell Steve if I do. Which, by the way, is—”
“Can you tell me why?”
“Everyone’s in on it?”
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Yeah, but where’s the fun in that? I need to stretch my legs. Plus, it’s more fun to scare the humans.”
“Worse, I’ll tell the Invaders you used to drool all over the maps.”
The response changes. Most of the time, Tony would say, “I hate it there.” Sometimes, it’s, “The kids hate me.”
It’s bad enough that the actor for Sherlock looks exactly like Tony, but the fact that a guy that looks like Tony is blatantly pining over his married best friend is just…just…
Endgame Tony who’s spread-eagle on a Captain Marvel pillow, with Steve by his side.
Tony imagines a young and tiny Steve seated in front of a dusty piano, his eyebrows knitted together as he stabs his fingers onto the keys. A faceless woman hovers over him, teaching with a kind murmur. “She sounded nice.”
Clint scowls. “Haha. Very funny, guys.”
Warmth spreads across his chest. “Your fiancé appreciates that. And his butt too.”
Carol snorts. “Please. If anyone’s lucky, he should be.”
“Oh.”
, his brain chides.
Steve couldn’t argue with that.
Unlike Steve, Carol, yet again, takes it all in stride. A fond smile graces her lips as she turns back to her pancakes.
That isn’t brand new information. Tony’s heard Miles and Kamala discuss it a couple of times before. But to actually hear it from the source, from the man himself—
“You slept with Bruce’s cousin,” Natasha interjects.
High school is surprisingly more bearable.
Steve wonders how long has Carol and Tony been together. Was it after the Avengers reassembled and Carol and Tony were friends before that? Was it during the dissemble when Carol and Tony fell into each other’s arms? Or was it before everything when Tony proposed that he and Steve—
Tony flashes a toothy grin that might or might not make Steve feel lighter. “Hey yourself.”
Warmth blossoms in Tony’s chest. “I know how to keep a secret.”
Tony’s eyebrows knit. “Yeah, Carol. I don’t mind helping you guys—”
Steve’s blush darkens. He rubs the back of his neck, his eyes drifting to the ceiling. “Oh. I thought… I thought we could go in together since we’re both supposed to give a speech. So I thought—”
This cycle goes on for several years.
With a shaky hand, he raises it to his chest tentatively.
Zola’s brow furrows, glancing behind him. “I see your friends have found us. No matter. Red Skull will take care of them. I, however—”
Cap frowns. “Alright. But still, you don’t have to—”
“You have lots of friends.”
But then, Obadiah Stane is whisking Tony away and as quickly, Howard’s at Steve’s side, his eyes drunk with anger.
“No. But—”
“Uh-huh.”
Much to both Steve’s delight and displeasure, Tony’s dressed in his usual combo of tank top and jeans. As much as Steve loathes Tony in pressed suits (Tony in a suit and tie shouldn’t leave Steve speechless, it’s horrifying), this outfit is so much worse. Tank tops always do an amazing job at showing off Tony’s lean body and toned arms.
“You obviously—”
“Um,” Steve begins.
Steve’s expression hardens. “No.”
has to be a dream. There’s no way Tony would—
“No, they won’t.”
Tony blinks.
clear out before I die of— Ow!”
With a jolt, Steve snaps back and opens his eyes, meeting Thor Odinson’s smirk.
And Tony steps out.
Tony sighs, snatching up his can of soda. “Fuck off, Nat.”
Steve shouldn’t be surprised that Tony brought Sharon up, given the fact that they both mutually ended their relationship a couple months ago. And as much as he loved Sharon, Steve was definitely not picturing her walking arm-in-arm with him.
“You know…” Steve waves his hand around. “That he’s dating Carol.”
“Hell
Steve shakes his head. “Don’t worry,” he promises. “I’ll be yours before you know it.”
“Well,” Tony begins, tilting forward until their faces are inches away from one another. “I can totally manage that. But first. Coffee. Nat told me you like the diner down the block. I was gonna get you a slice of pie from the place but then I’d figure we could make a date out of it. I mean after you’re done closing up, of course. And if you want to.”
’ on the inner ring.
“And there it is.”
The way Steve stares at him is both comical and flattering. “Wow,” he says with a low whistle. “You really are a genius.”
Arms that can bench press Tony any day.
“Well, I guess it’s better than Johnny’s wish,” Tony mutters, who somehow thought it’d be a wonderful idea to write, ‘Congrats on the sex!’ in flaming letters. Tony doesn’t think he’ll ever live that down.
“Miss Romanov, Mr Storm, and sir.”
Steve grins sheepishly. “Nat insisted I did. She taught me.”
An ear-piercing whistle cuts everyone off.
Neither of them makes a move for a long moment. For an excruciating moment, he expects Steve to finally put Tony out of his misery, to seal their lips together. Instead, Steve shifts his attention back to the piano.
“But then, I realized I’d just be using him as a replacement for you.”
He’d think that being Captain America and the leader of the Avengers, he’d have some form of respect and authority over them. But
Clint snorts. “Wouldn't surprise me. Bobbi would take any opportunity to embarrass me. It's cool. It's all lies, anyway.” He grins, patting Steve on the thigh. “Sides’, gotta keep our great leader’s spirits up. The sulking's just—
They usually take turns getting dinner together. While Tony leans towards more expansive and refined options, Steve’s tastes are much simpler. This year, he's opted for burgers and fries for himself and a homemade blend of cow’s blood, pomegranate, and strawberries for Tony. Just the sight of the crimson liquid being poured into his wine glass has Tony salivating.
Bucky’s eyes flash, something dark and angry behind it. “Stark—”
“I mourned you!”
“You threw the blue shell!”
And that’s when everything comes crashing down on him.
Tony swallows down the emotions bubbling inside of him.
“I’m going to make this clear so you’ll stop treating poor Carol terribly because she didn’t deserve the cold treatment you’ve been giving her. Let’s get one thing straight, Carol is and will always remain my friend. I do not plan on kissing her or dating her because one—”
“Yeah, but I’d figure you’d prefer someone like Thor. Someone more wholesome. Heroic.”
“And we’re toys based on those movies.”
“I’m leaving,” Tony blurts out the next day.
“Okay.”
Clint lets out a low whistle as they watch the spaceship disappear into the horizon. “Damn. If I were Tony, I’d never come back from Asgard.”
And that’s how Steve gets his first break.
A deep blush starts creeping up Tony’s neck and covering his cheeks, but he doesn’t seem fazed by the action.
Tonight, he’ll give it as good as he can give. Tonight, he’ll give Steve anything and everything he's ever fantasized about and wants.
“Am I boring you, Mr Stark?” Zola intones as he saunters over to Tony’s side, a syringe in hand. “You haven’t said a word since you were brought to me.”
“And not because you were on the run?”
Steve isn’t one to make a deal out of his birthday. In fact, he rather not celebrate it at all. Despite Tony coming to his defense, the rest of the team insisted on a big birthday bash this time just because he was going to be a centenarian.
Years fly by. Steve goes to art school.
Immediately, Steve yanks away from Tony’s touch, jumping to his feet.
Tony swallows the bile crawling up his throat. “I couldn’t find you! I thought you snuck away. Got yourself killed out in the field. And all I could think was how much I wronged you and you died thinking I hated you and thought you weak when that’s the furthest from the truth and I—I—”
Tony gestures towards the wall of framed photographs behind Steve. “Look.”
“Okay. Hypothetically, let’s say he winds up on your doorstep. Asking you to take him back. Would you?”
“But Barnes—”
“You don’t need to—”
“Seven, sweetheart,” Steve corrects gently and wow, that should not do things to Tony’s chest. Nopeity nope nope.
has Barnes. Stupid precious Barnes and his dry hair and his smoldering gaze and murderous—”
Steve freezes, his brain finally registering the palm pressed against his cheek and the light sting.
Tony’s well aware of Steve’s short temper. Hell, he’s been on the other end of Steve’s anger more often than he’d like. The thing is Steve hardly loses his temper or even swear, especially in public like that.
“Hey,” Tony cuts in softly, cupping Steve’s jaw. “I’m cool with it. I mean, now that I know that the feeling’s mutual and all. Still, you could’ve taken me out to dinner first before springing that on me out of the blue—”
Steve rolls his eyes playfully. “C’mon, Anthony,” he says, slinging his arm around Tony’s shoulder. The gesture almost makes Tony’s knees buckle. “We’re running late.”
Is Johnny
He still holds onto that thought when that faithful evening arrives. Just as the clock strikes six, a spaceship lands onto the tower’s helipad. A woman dressed in armor steps out of the spaceship, one hand resting on the pommel of her sword, the other holding a bouquet of flowers.
“Bucky!” Steve yells over the comms.
“I know,” he groans. “But the stocks—”
“Never thought I’d see the day. Let me tell you, tonight’s gonna—”
“Bingo.”
Sam and Natasha kick their asses for him.
And maybe in another life, Steve would’ve actually asked Tony out instead of—
It would suck if Steve agreed to this and found out Tony was truly joking five years down the line. It would suck a lot. But it’s a notion Steve had prepared for the moment they met.
“Good,” Tony murmurs. “Very good.”
“You want us to be mates?!”
“Oh,” he says, burying his face and heartbreak behind his mug. “It must've— Must’ve been amazing.”
Tony quirks his lips to the side indulgently. “Maybe. I'll think about it.”
Tony’s eyes dim. He pulls away, leaving Steve cold.
He squeezes his eyes shut because he can’t look at her, can’t let her know how much he fucked up, how much he—
“Open it,” he hears Tony repeat, this time in a much gentler tone.
But then he hears a familiar giggle behind him and then he loses focus.
“I’m so—”
“Tony,” Steve breathes into his neck.
is ashamed.”
Tony waves his hand. “Don’t worry about it. They’re chicken. Chicks in a blanket.” Kamala giggles at that. “There’s no pork in the food. There's no alcohol in any of the food either. Or drinks.”
Natasha immediately curls her fingers around Clint and Thor’s wrists, tugging them towards the elevator. Bruce hurries after her. “And there’s our cue.”
“So you and Steve got fake engaged for the sake of your company,” Carol says drily.
“They’ll kill you,” Steve says, wrinkling his nose as he wedges it between his teeth before offering to light Tony’s.
Tony scoffs. “You say that now, but when I have you screaming my name—”
Something curls in his stomach. Something indescribable but hot. He elects to ignore it.
Dinner goes without a hitch, after that. They fall back into their usual topics of conversation of work and friends, making sure to steer clear of any talk of romance and mates.
Hulk harrumphs, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “Was a fluke. Carol just got lucky.”
Seduce.
“I love you.”
“Thank god,” Tony breathes out. “I doubt a concussion would be a turn-on for you.”
“Did you hear?” Sam begins during their weekly lunch date. “Tony Stark’s back in Manhattan.”
“Steve,” Tony chastises, his cheeks burning once again. “Not in front of everyone.”
“No, they’re not!”
The punch doesn’t come.
Steve manages a smile, his brain short-circuiting for the bazillionth time tonight. “Thanks.”
“I took a nap!”
“We do not mean to insult your intelligence, my friend,” Thor replies. “We assumed you will not be amenable to our proposition.”
But it doesn't beat the ones about Steve and Tony's ‘love affair’.
Tony’s frowning, looking unconvinced. Steve’s well acquainted with Tony’s issues when it comes to love, be it for himself or letting others love him. Countless times, he’s tried to change this, change his mind. This time, he’s going to make him see.
“Then what’s with the cold shoulder you’ve been giving me these past couple of years?” Tony demands, shrugging off Steve’s embrace. “You couldn’t stand the sight of me. I— I know I fucked up the last time we met. I know I coddled you too much. I shouldn’t have done that. Shouldn’t have smothered you. You deserve better than that. But I just— I know you don’t love me anymore—”
With bated breath, he lets Steve whisk him off his feet.
Tony finally sighs. “Okay. Fine. Caroline Susan Jane—”
Steve needs to get away. Away from Tony and Natasha and Johnny freaking—
“You know you could get the drinks at the bar for free, right?”
Tony would’ve buried his face in his hands and let out the loudest scream, let out a stream of curses. Maybe even thrust his fists against Steve’s broad chest. But thanks to Miles and Kamala, his armor is a goner.
“Don’t Sharon me,” she says, toeing the beer cans at her feet. “C’mon. Let’s get you cleaned up.”
“Think what?”
“He won’t wind up on my doorstep.”
Tony scowls, his heckles and humiliation rising. “Look, Cap. I’m a big boy. I can handle playing second fiddle. I’ve always had my whole life. No one wants me. No one loves me. So don't act like you do. So get out of here and see your fucking soulmate and leave me to—to—”
He almost snorts out loud. He can imagine what Tony would say if he knew what’s going on in his mind right now. A drama queen, he’d call him. Or maybe just this once, he’d indulge in Steve’s overdramatic musings. He would.
He should be happy for them. Sharon’s his cousin, after all. She deserves everything and good. So does Steve.
“If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve called this creepy,” Tony begins, gesturing at Steve’s paintings.
hates that his friends know him so well.
Tony waits.
“I see,” Thor says, his gaze darting between the both of them. “I suppose I could leave you both here to indulge—”
Clint smacks his lips together. “Well, yeah. But—”
Steve gets countless letters from Tony after.
“The sun just set, actually.”
“Oh?”
It comes to a head one lazy Sunday afternoon.
“Tony?”
And that’s more important than anything else.
Bruce shakes his head fondly.
As usual, silence answers him.
The gears in his head screech to a halt.
“Fuck you, man.”
Steve nods, leaning forward to take a good look. “Well…”
Once again, Tony sighs, his fingers rubbing at his temples. Steve expects a lecture after. What he gets instead is Tony on his tip-toes, pecking Steve on the lips.
“Later,” he says, pulling away. “I need food in me. Can’t think on an empty stomach, you know?”
“I have a date for you.”
“Didn’t peg you as a nature kind of guy.”
“No shit.”
He pulls Tony against his chest and plants the shortest but most passionate kiss Tony has ever experienced onto Tony’s faceplate, where his lips should be.
So with that thought in mind, he fixes his tie, squares his shoulder, takes a deep breath, holds his head high, and—
His train of thought is cut short by a quiet harrumph in front of him.
“Yup,” Tony replies, feeling a little hollow. “The best. Had fun with Endgame Tony?”
Endgame Steve beams. “Thanks.” He nudges Tony in the ribs, a hint of playfulness in the gesture. “You should tell him.”
Surprisingly, Steve isn’t the most fascinated by the art hanging in the hallways. He’s much more taken by the planetarium, especially the space theater.
“No!”
For the rest of the day, Steve feels like he’s floating on air. Everyone else mercilessly teases him about it. He could barely give a shit.
“Thanks.”
“No,” Steve blurts out. “I just— I mean, I forced you into this.”
. Everything is just so fucking
She’s just a friend he needs around, another friend to keep him sane, to keep him from reaching for the bottle.
Captain America freezes. Tony's breath catches.
Well, he supposes he is giving the card to Tony. Just not in the way he would’ve liked. And that sucks so fucking much.
“He’s
a part of the Air Force. Or used to be, at least.
Tony gets to have two of the last people he wants to see in his way.
“Don’t. I don’t care about all that,” Tony insists. “I don’t. I’m happy the way I am now. I have a business that’s doing fine. I have friends who care about me. And I have you. And that’s all I need. As long as you don’t regret it. Regret everything.”
Tony groans, snatching a pig in a blanket from a passing waiter. “Not you too.”
“Only for you,” he says and god, he’s said too much.
Tony deflates. “Oh.”
Zola sneers. “I do think that I prefer you this way, silent and pliant. I think I will like you more when we finally make you the next baron.” He sighs, pushing his slipping glasses further up the bridge of his nose. “Such a shame about your father. Now, anything you would like to tell me before we begin?”
Tony’s grin turns smug. “I know things.” He pauses. “Well, Nat told me. Nat told me a lot of things about you. About your art and uh… Yeah.”
Tony’s lips quirk to the side. “Uh huh. You’re cute when you’re jealous.”
He nods.
“Just good?”
His gaze drifts, narrowing onto Jan, who’s thankfully out of Steve’s line of sight. Her smile dims as soon as their eyes meet. With graceful poise, she saunters over.
his life?
God, Steve's stupid. He's so fucking stupid.
“It’s morning. Also, gummy bears don’t count.”
“No,” he snaps before wincing. So much for staying cool.
“Huh.” She tilts her head to the side, squinting up at him. “What’s with the long face? C’mon. Turn that frown upside down.”
The doors shut. The train moves. The scent doesn’t fade.
He’s going to do it. He’s going to—
They lapse into comfortable silence after that, letting Bruce Springsteen croon them all the way to Central Park. Steve takes the opportunity to run things through his head.
“Cold?”
“For what?” Steve asks, angling his body towards Tony. “The arm?”
“That’s more where that came from.”
Natasha smirks. “Wanna bet?”
“Which you didn’t,” Natasha points out, arching an eyebrow.
Fuck, Thor’s got him there. Tony would never turn down opportunities to prove that magic is nothing compared to science and technology. Thor’s feeding the competitive streak in him. Judging by his cocky smirk, he’s aware of it.
“You can play by ear?” Steve asks, cutting through Tony’s train of thought.
, he wants to say.
, he’d be alone in his bunk, sketching out Ma and Tony and god, he’s a f—
Tony’s on his fourth cigarette and Steve on his third before the silence is broken.
He’s been through enough to know that a situation like this calls for the public spotlight. But it’s worse when it’s just Steve and him together, sitting on a lumpy couch in a stuffy room on a late-night talk show.
“Is it weird that Bobbi kinda reminds me of Steve?” Clint pipes up.
“This…” He gestures between the two of them. “This…thing. You know.”
Not at all.
Tony snorts. “Apparently, they all have ‘places’ to be.”
It’s a set of color pencils, the kind that costs a lot. Ma had told him they couldn’t afford it when he asked her.
“What?”
Fuck, how could he forget? He’s been planning this shindig for days, weeks. Not to mention the fact he has a very important plan to carry out at midnight. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (well, yearly but whatever).
He always knows how to take Tony’s breath away.
Tony expects Steve to be elated, relieved.
“I see you met Steve,” he says, sounding more energetic, like he always does when the caffeine seems to be working its magic on him.
Party Pooper turns his attention towards her, sneering. “Have you seen the movies? They hate each other.”
But then again, Steve has no reason to lie to him. Definitely not to spare his feelings, feelings that Steve has disregarded time after time again.
“Tony? Is that you?”
“No,” Tony repeats, this time quieter, softer, and all too loving. “I do. I do feel the same about you. I’ve been in love with you since we met too.”
‘Ours’ become ‘his’, ‘hers, or ‘theirs’, and ‘mine’. Old haunts become memories until the time is right. Nostalgia hits in waves until it just fades altogether.
“I’m bi.”
Tony switches his pleading look over to Dugan. “C’mon, Dugan. Help me here.”
Maybe this isn’t such a good idea, after all.
Finally, Steve flops onto his back, peering up into Natasha’s eyes. “I know,” he says sincerely.
“Fuck,” Tony breathes out when they break for air.
A part of him is happy, happy that his friends are happy, that he’s proven his father wrong yet again, that he’s becoming himself again, to the man he was before Howard pushed that glass of whiskey into his grubby, six-year-old hands.
“Bedroom?” Steve offers.
“Not yet. There’s something—” Tony cuts himself off. “Hey, we should get some hot dogs. Bet you’re starving.”
“I wanted to. You don’t know how close I was to jumping onto the nearest train and—”
“Uh-huh. Sure it doesn't,” Clint drawls, propping his legs on top of the coffee table. Bruce immediately nudges it off. “Us thinking of setting up the guy you’ve been pining—”
His heart skips a beat. “I was afraid.”
Tony barks out a laugh and pulls her into a tight embrace. She smells like jasmine and old books and sweet peach tea.
Tony scowls, pushing away but Thor’s hand moves to clutch his shoulder.
All he can think of is that Tony isn’t pressed next to him playing. Tony isn’t cursing and yelling along with everyone else. Tony isn’t flashing that smirk of his at Steve when he overtakes him.
Usually when Steve returns from his morning run, the main living room and kitchen are deserted, save for the occasional sighting of Tony grabbing his seventh mug of coffee or Bruce at the stove, whipping up breakfast to feed a whole army. That is, if he isn’t Hulked out. Then, he’d be out like a log.
But then he remembers and suddenly he’s crumbling to the ground because all he can think of is Steve pressing him against that door that’s miles and miles away and kissing the life out of him.
“Fine,” Steve blurts out without a thought. “I just— I’ll pay for it. Later. Yes! I just— I need to go.”
Steve really,
“Then, why?”
Steve groans. “Seriously? You too? Am I the only one that thinks this is just—just—”
“You know…” Tony gestured vaguely. “You and Sharon.”
Fury asks to see him, to see them.
Tony nods, sucks in a breath—
“How was it?” Bruce asks, fatigue lacing his tone.
He averts her gaze, tears threatening to spill from his eyelids. Warmth on his shaking fist forces him to meet her halfway. “He loved you,” she murmurs, her own eyes glistened. “Loves you. Misses you.”
Tony’s nervous. Why’s he nervous? He has no reason to be nervous.
He nods.
“Fuck,” he groans, burying his face in his hands. “This is so embarrassing.”
has to refrain from doing a happy dance.
Steve’s friends have always told him how transparent he could be with his feelings. If Tony doesn’t know how he feels before, he knows now.
“What is it? A dime?”
Steve frowns. Missed out? What did she mean by that?
Steve never did either.
Another round of bullets and screams cut him off, this time louder and closer. Before Tony knows it, the door shatters, showering Tony and Zola with splinters.
“Truth,” Natasha agrees solemnly.
“Tony—”
“Mr Stark is my father,” Tony corrects and god, he’s dialing up his stupid charm that is irresistible to none and Bobbi is falling for it. “Call me Tony.”
It hits Steve square on the nose.
When Steve exits the bathroom, one of the last things he’d expect is to find Natasha sprawled over his bed, reading a magazine.
Tony’s eyebrows knit together, concerned. “Uh, Cap? I don’t think that’s a good—”
So no one should blame him for almost walking into a wall when Tony fucking Stark shows up at his mother’s bakery one Friday night.
“I know,” Steve murmurs, thankfully changing the subject. His shoulder sag, whether in disappointment or relief, Tony doesn’t know. He hopes it’s the latter.
Steve stills. “Tony, I don’t—”
Heat blooms on Tony’s face. “Thanks. You, uh— You look good too.”
That’s not much talking after that.
“I don’t know. I just— Steve’s Steve, you know? He’s Captain America. And I’m just—”
Steve shakes his head. “I think I can remember enough to chime in. It was… It was really nice. I like it.”
Now’s a very good time to dig that hole and stick his head in there, Jesus Christ.
“Something for a special someone, huh?” he asks, hoping he doesn’t sound as disappointed as he feels.
Tony’s so much older now, with wrinkles and laugh lines and a goatee painted on his face. His eyes and smile are as bright as the last time he’s seen them in person.
With a quiet intake of breath, he steels himself and turns around.
“Sir, I do not think it wise—”
“Give him time to cool off,” Bruce replies tiredly.
“You’re not answering the question.”
“Yup. Just peachy.”
Tony cocks an eyebrow, wishing he had his helmeted head screwed on. Instead, he lies back down on top Miles’ pencil case. “Jealous? Why would I be jealous?”
Reed inclines his head. “She loves me. It never fails to astound me that she does. I used to think that I didn’t deserve her, that she deserves better. That’s how you feel now, am I correct?”
“I could get them to leave—”
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Steve says. “I was actually going to say I’ve been in love with you for four hundred and ninety-nine years and five months. So.”
“Sir? Your heart rate is accelerating.”
“Could do without the full name.”
“Had fun?” Clint drawls.
Tony scoffs. “Uh huh. Sure. She beat you
And that’s the moment Tony realizes what Steve’s endgame is.
But that was before he knew of Carol. Carol who could’ve been wondering where her boyfriend is. Carol who Tony might’ve made plans with. Carol, who Tony is—
If heartbreak is like scars, Tony would have a million of them marring his skin.
“Secret identities sure are fucked up, huh?”
Steve blinks, startled. “What?”
Tony nods. “Howard always thought music was a waste, especially on someone like me. Which is funny considering how much he resented me for being smarter than him.”
Steve frowns but his tone is still a little teasing when he replies. “I didn’t think the thought of us dating would upset you.”
“But what if you end up falling for someone else?”
Speaking of Johnny Storm, he swaggers inside the gym like he owns the place, his smug grin ever plastered on. He has an arm around Tony’s shoulder, a detail Steve tries hard to ignore. Thankfully for his sanity, Natasha trails in after them.
Steve grins. “Deal.”
But the problem is that, well—
Steve rolls his eyes, chasing after Tony’s fingers again. This time, the glove parts, revealing a weathered hand. It’s warm.
Steve blinks, snapping out of his stupor. “What?”
“Not my fault you can’t tell the difference between a joke or not,” Tony replies, injecting as much mirth as he can. “How long have you been there?”
“Apparently, you look at him with, and I quote, ‘A glare so deathly that it makes Scott Summers’ optic beams look harmless.”
But that’s the thing about the imagination, they’re just figurative. Most of the stuff that swims Steve’s brain has a very,
God, let him be happy. He deserves to be happy.
“Don’t you worry that pretty head of yours,” Clint says, miming a zipping motion over his lips. “I didn’t tell a single soul.”
“He is. But he isn’t just you. You’re also Steve Rogers. And that’s the man I fell in love with. Not Spangles.
Miles’ smile fades and god, if only Tony wasn’t six inches tall and made out of plastic, he’d shove his gauntlet in that kid’s face. It doesn’t matter if he’s six. No one makes Miles sad.
“Yeah?”
dark-haired, bright green-eyed with a dimpled smile. And judging by her track record
“It’s fine—”
Steve blinks through his tears as he cups Tony’s cheek. “If it makes you feel better, you ruined me for anyone else too. Fuck, we wasted so much time. So much fucking time. We’re fucking forty-two, Tony. I can’t—”
Tony should’ve known better than to dream.
“What makes you say that?”
Someone seems out to get him, huh?
eyes.
“Yeah, yeah, it’ll be on me,” Tony interrupts, quickly continuing before Steve could interject. It’s weird how he can be a little too earnest about certain jokes, especially when Tony gets all self-deprecating. They’re just jokes.
After that, things take a turn for the weird.
He hates how that even living in a big city like New York, he keeps running into Steve fucking Rogers.
Kamala’s still giggling as she replies, “Wow, I didn’t know Hulk loves them so much. Wish I was there to see it all happen.”
Dugan shrugs his shoulders.
If he does, Tony doesn’t say it. He just flashes him a two-finger salute, throws out a, “See you on Monday, Rogers”, before heading out into the night, leaving as quick as he came.
“I am Iron Man,” he declares to the world after.
But then Tony walks in with his hair coiffed and his suit pressed and god, he’s breathtaking.
When he finally gathers the courage to, Tony’s long gone.
Tony shrugs. “Don’t be. I had fun. And I got to see Asgard. I don't regret a thing. Anyway, we’ll see what’s in store for me next Friday. Who knows? Maybe it’ll be a disaster.”
And it’s all good and dandy, seeing Jan and Sharon become best friends.
Steve shrugs, passing one of the mugs to Tony. “Heard you come in.”
Steve’s worked on a couple of SHIELD missions with her. She’s wonderful to work with – strong-willed, friendly, and professional. He has nothing but praise for her in reports to Fury.
Neither of them makes a move nor a sound, save for their shallow breathing. Steve’s expression isn’t just soft now. It’s filled with wonder. Hope. Fear.
Steve’s pretty sure his supposed death has a hand in it this time. He’s not sure what to make of that. Neither can he comprehend the odd flicker in Tony’s expression before it’s gone.
Oh fucking god.
“Don’t ‘Carol’ me,” she says, hopping onto the kitchen island and crossing her arms. “How could you?”
He breathes a quiet sigh of relief when the credits begin to roll and moves to make his exit. He would've succeeded if Clint hadn't decided to play pinochle.
Tony’s breath catches at the reverence in Steve’s tone. “Figured you’ll like that kind of sappy thing.”
“Tony,” he corrects for the millionth time. “Call me Tony.”
Like sure, he likes Peter. Likes him a whole lot. In fact, he and Peter were bought together as a Christmas present for Miles. They have the strongest bond out of all the toys.
Steve signs up immediately.
Until they all pile into the elevator.
“Uh, morning.” His eyes narrow as a mug of steaming coffee is pushed his way. It’s not his mug, the standard white one that they have on standby. “Thanks.”
“Traitor.”
Steve stills next to him. “Me too.” He pauses to suck on his cigarette and then quietly breathes out, “There wasn’t a day that passed that I didn’t think of you. When I didn’t miss you.”
? “He didn’t? Damn. And I thought we’re friends.”
Fortunately for Tony, Hank doesn’t bother pursuing the subject. “No, I—I get why you kicked me out all those years ago. And I just… I’ve accepted it and I’ve moved on. I’m not mad about it and I’m just… I’m sorry about Monica.”
“Yeah. And your arms. And your…” Steve's cheeks begin to heat up. “...butt.”
“Cut the bullshit, Ty,” Tony snaps. “We both know you know this is Steve’s.”
They should talk. They
“Shit,” he breathes out. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know—”
Tony arches an eyebrow. “Is there something you’d like to tell me, Romanoff?”
“Gotta admit,” she says, cutting through Steve’s train of thought. “Kinda hurt he didn’t recognize me.”
Steve doesn’t get to reply because their path is blocked once again, this time by an elderly couple.
But then, he could just keep his eyes closed and stay in bed. He can’t remember the last time he got a decent day of sleep. To take that away from him is daylight robbery.
“Really,” Steve echoes. “Why did you think I wanted to be fake engaged to you?”
Thor's choice is an Asgardian by the name of Sif, a close friend of his. Steve doesn’t know much about Norse Mythology but he swears he’s heard of her before. And not because Thor mentioned her.
“Bull,” Tony says without any heat. “Now, enough talking. We should get some sleep while we can.”
Steve laughs unsympathetically but offers a hand. “Wanna dance?”
Oh right. That.
“Anyway,” Tony says as he pushes Steve out of the elevator, “I’m going to go back to work. Okay? Okay. JARVIS, workshop.”
“What?”
“—along with your apology to Carol—”
“So?”
Natasha surveys him with a cocked eyebrow. “You know you don’t need to kiss him tonight, right?” She plants herself against the vending machine, crossing her arms. “There’s no time-limit to tell him how you feel.”
For a moment, Tony didn’t say a word. He tentatively dusted the crumbs off his T-shirt. “Let me guess, hot dog not doing it for you?”
Steve cups Tony’s jaw, a feathery caress as his lips give and take. It sets Tony ablaze.
He doesn’t hear about the move until weeks later. And even then, the news isn’t even from Steve himself.
He doesn’t bother lifting his head up to greet them, choosing to burrow his face further into his pillow. The bed dips in various places. A soft hand cards through his hair.
“Tony—”
“We are not telling them,” Steve murmurs.
“I’m in love with you.
At some point in the night, Jan’s pulled into a conversation with some big-name designer, leaving Tony to explore the gallery alone.
Tony feels the words in his throat shrivel up, all of the memories of the past days, weeks, months, years, flooding his mind.
“Jesus,” Sharon says when she finds him drunkenly drenching his canvas in shades of brown. “Bucky and Sam were right.”
“You’re insane,” Bruce comments as they watch Bobbi Morse pull up to the curb.
Miles’ savior hardens, hands on her hips. “They don’t. They like each other. They went back in time together.”
“Oh,” she says, laughing. “This will be fun.”
“—but I never stopped thinking about you. Sometimes, I’d think about what could’ve been. More often than I should. I used to wonder why I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Why I could never stay, let anyone stay.” Tony sighs into Steve’s shoulder. “You ruined me, Rogers. You ruined me for everyone else. And I hated you so much for that.”
Which means sharing the same bed.
For the third time (or fourth, who knows at this point), Steve basks in Tony’s compliments. “Yeah. Wanna know something?”
Tony blinks. “Are you crazy?”
But still, Steve can’t wrap his head around who this is. A friend, maybe. One Steve hasn’t met before. Or maybe this person isn’t Tony’s friend. Maybe it’s one of Hulk’s secret pals or Natasha’s or—
Besides, Steve can handle things. Steve with the broad shoulders with arms that could probably bench press Tony if he asked. Steve who could tear limbs apart as easy as breathing because he’s a freaking—
“Still. You can’t help it sometimes, you know.”
“Things won’t go south.”
Steve pauses, his glass of orange juice halfway between his lips. “Wait, you knew it was a sham?”
One dark morning, Tony wakes up to Steve’s arms around his waist and his nose buried in his neck.
to be dreaming.
“Something wrong?”
“I know—”
“I figured you’d say that. So, you know.” Tony climbs up to his feet, pulling one of his desk drawers open and reaching inside. “I didn’t lock myself up for no reason. Here. It’s not vibranium but uh, hope you like it.”
Bruce gestures downwards. “Your chopsticks.”
He stills and turns. The flashes of light and chatter around them don’t stop.
Now, Steve’s not just out of Tony’s league or ballpark. He’s out of his fucking orbit.
Tony frowns, incredulous. “Seriously? You were jealous of Hammer too?”
Tony's eyes widen. They're so
The bright smile slips off Steve’s lips. At the exact same time, the train comes to a halt.
Tony comes home. Waits until midnight. Tiptoes over to Jarvis’ room. Begs him to give him a ride over to Steve’s. Climbs the fire escape to Steve’s room.
“He was crying during the fight scenes. And for half of the movie.”
Kamala gnaws at the bottom lip. “I saw the pigs in the blankets over at the buffet table and I was wondering if they’re, you know...”
“Tony! I—”
the one who’s out of your league. Fuck, I’m not even in the same ballpark as you. I’m like on the other end of the planet.”
Steve frowns. “Unless we have an emergency. Why?”
When they finally tumble into Tony’s penthouse, he lets a sigh out of relief and undoes his tie. Steve doesn’t take his eyes off him.
Steve whirls around, clutching his heart. “Ma—”
Hammer’s cheeks flame, his jaw clenching. “Well then,
Steve’s cheeks turn pink. “Um, you look—” He gestures to Tony’s body. “You look good. Yeah.”
“Yeah. Ororo and Jan said they forgot they had a reservation at some fancy-schmancy place, Bruce had some idea he needed to write down immediately, Peter went out to get some photos of Spider-Man for the Bugle, and guess where Logan went?”
“Tony?”
“Wanna hang out?”
Steve grins as he tilts his head forward. “Guess I do.”
Tony chuckles, leaning over to press the keys at Steve’s side. He tilts his head, meaning to grin at Steve, squeeze a joke between the notes from across the stool. He’s greeted by a pair of starry eyes and a tender smile. Their noses barely ghost one another’s.
Tony doesn’t get it. Like sure, Endgame Tony’s helmet can flip open thanks to the button by his thigh. And sure, the armor comes with cooler upgrades (the fact he has an energy blade and a nano shield irks Tony) and sure, age might be a good look on him but—but—
Natasha’s threat (Tony has no doubt it’s a real threat. It’s Natasha, after all) happened a couple of days ago. Tony hasn’t bothered acting on her words.
“I think I saw a motel not far away from here,” Sam pipes up. “Several miles ahead. We could stay there for the night.”
A stupid, stupid—
“Which he will,” Natasha counters. “You’ve been set on proposing to him for so long. What changed?”
Sharon hums as she takes a long sip from her cup. “Ten.”
“Hey,” Tony says, offended. “Besides, my—
Steve’s eyelids flutter, his lips parting. He… He doesn’t know how to feel about that. One thing’s for sure is that he’s definitely going to have words with her later. A lot of words.
“Oh.”
He can hear the smile in Sharon’s voice. “Forgive me?”
Steve smiles in spite of himself. “Lead the way, Shellhead.”
Tony lets out a hollow laugh of his own. “The board’s going kill me.”
Steve scowls. “So now that I’m big and strong and not helpless—”
“Excuse me, you wanted me to—”
Their lips part at the impact and Tony couldn’t help but break into a giggle. Steve follows suit, burying his face in the crook of Tony’s neck with ease, like it’s where he belongs.
“So?”
Steve cocks an eyebrow. “Wouldn’t it make more sense to get something your person would like?”
Tony bites back a retort, taking the opportunity to drown in his black and non-alcoholic coffee.
“Nah. You were sleeping so soundly. Didn’t have the heart to wake you up.”
going to—
Tony has to come back. There’s no way he’d stay in Asgard. Everyone he cares about is here on Earth. He wouldn’t stay for the pretty sights, the advanced technology, or even the stunning strangers.
They’re in bed when he says it, after another quiet bout of lovemaking.
“I did!” Tony exclaims before frowning. “Or at least, I thought I did.”
“Stay,” Tony rasps.
Each time, Tony talks about how much he misses Steve.
Steve winces, his whole face now turning crimson red. Hell, even the tip of his ears is a bright shade of blush. It’s goddamn adorable.
Carol’s eyes narrow. “You do?”
“Kiss him!” a third fan screams.
“Yuppers.”
Hell, the only reason why they’re here or even donating to the foundation is only because they’re huge Captain America fans. Or in Mrs Burke’s case, a huge Captain America
But Endgame Tony has awful,
When Tony flies through the wormhole, he tries getting in touch with Steve.
“I know that now,” Tony echoes, grinning as he snakes his arms around Steve’s neck. “Now I have you.”
Tony jerks upwards, his fingers accidentally playing a discordant chord. The reprimand on his lips dies out when he sees who’s at the door.
Steve Rogers who’s Captain America.
“Jan van Dyne, right?” Steve asks. “Been a while since I heard from her. How’s she?”
“So, um... Are you going to do it?”
Tony raises an eyebrow, peering at him from his mug. “Do I?”
Thor beams, his hands on his hips. Tony half-expects lightning to shoot the space behind him. “I challenge thee to a race across the country!”
Steve winces. “Well, not exactly.”
It all happens in a blur. One moment, he’s yelling at JARVIS to boost his thrusters. The next thing he knows, he's pushing Barnes away from MODOK’s lasers and then pain, so much pain and there’s so much yelling and why is Steve screaming? Why is he crying? Tony just saved his soulmate’s life? He should be grateful. He should be thankful. He should—
“As friends,” Tony says. He shrugs his shoulders. “Apparently our relationship is best left platonic.”
Eventually, they break apart to catch their breath. Tony’s fingers ghost his reddened lips, his eyes wide. “What—”
Steve grins. “Meet you outside.”
Well… Fuck.
Steve blinks, following his gaze. The chopsticks in his grip are in pieces. His cheeks begin to heat up.
Steve’s brow furrows. “Is that Georgia On My Mind?”
Tony scoffs. “So the usual then.”
No, it’s
“But she was fun,” Tony continues. “It was fun.” He shakes his head, slapping Clint upside his head. “God, I can’t believe you fucked that up.”
“But did you think that? Did you really think that I— I—”
“I have high hopes for you, Romanoff.”
Steve’s lips quirk to the side, draping his arms over the railing. “Including your boyfriend?”
“Bedroom,” Tony agrees.
He can’t remember the last time he’s felt like this, the last time anyone could make him feel so warm, so safe, so
Tony frowns. “Rooftop? Why are we—”
“Jesus fuck, Cap,” he says, clutching his arc reactor. “Didn’t your ma ever tell you to knock?”
Tony swears he sees Steve’s smile waver and his fingers flex for a second.
There’s a knock on his door. Tony opens it.
Tony’s heart stutters again at the odd look Steve’s fixing him. It leaves him breathless, ready to pull him closer and press his lips onto Steve’s. To tell him that he couldn’t give a shit if he stepped on his foot for the rest of their lives.
He didn’t bother leaving his post from the vending machine. All he did was think about all the ways things could go wrong if he confessed his feelings to Steve like an idiot.
“Fine. Bruce and I—”
Tony knows. Oh, he definitely does. But he’s not ready. Not yet. Not now. Not ever.
Tony loves with all of his heart. He loves and loves and loves until his body bleeds of it. And each time his heart breaks, he lets himself bleed and bleed until he can finally pick himself up and try again.
“Woah, woah. What the hell do you mean I know?”
Tony’s lips quirk to the side. “You like me, huh?”
Steve couldn’t help but cackle as Tony storms out, striding to hurry after him.
“So what?” Natasha asks. “Clint and I are close. You didn’t think we were dating, did you?”
Or maybe his brain is making him think he knows her.
“Yeah.”
Steve frowns. “I’m not—”
“—fuck you!”
, another part of Tony refutes. He decides to ignore them both.
“I’m not,” Steve says, feeling a little offended.
Is Tony trying to tell him what Steve thinks he’s going to say? Is Tony finally going to tell him that he and Carol are dating? He did mention Carol, after all. Steve can’t imagine Tony being this nervous about anything else besides—
Tony scoffs as he watches Steve walk off.
“Dumbasses," she mutters, rubbing her temples wearily. She pins him with a scowl, her emerald gaze inciting fear in Tony's weak heart. "Seriously. You boys need to talk. Clear the air. I promise you. You'll like what you hear.”
“But—”
It's stupid how a dumb comment like that sends him spirally. Hell, Barnes didn't sound mean-spirited or anything. He doubts Barnes is capable of being mean-spirited.
, Steve!” Tony yells. “Years! I never heard from you! I called and begged and fuck, you could’ve sent me a letter or two! Could’ve told me you were alive—”
It’s a simple gold ring, with a familiar scrawl engraved on the inside.
“Well, good for you.” Tony straightens, smoothening his vest. “Now if you’d excuse me—”
“You know who I am?” Steve squeaks out.
Tony helps.
But right now, as he stares into Steve’s blue,
Steve could barely fight off the grin creeping up his face. “Now, what makes you think I have anything to say?”
“Yeah, ‘oh’.” Tony shakes his head. “I know I said you’re cute when you’re jealous but you’re also kinda mean when you’re jealous.”
Steve’s eyes widen, his lips parting. It’s times like these that the vampire that turned Tony all those centuries ago actually sucked him dry.
“—sure you have places to be and people to talk to—”
“Moral support.”
“We’re fine,” Tony cuts in. “We just had a disagreement, is all.”
“I should’ve told you I love you,” Steve says before tossing back another shot.
jealous. And I’ve been jealous for a very long time of Johnny. I want to be the one you flirt with.”
“Why not? It’s you.”
The other eyebrow arches, his lips twitching. “All-American blue eyes?”
Steve tries not to think about him.
Endgame Steve sighs. “Why do you think he grew that beard out?”
“You think so?” Steve asks.
“I think Tony meant a different kind of fun,” Bruce offers.
Then again knowing him, Steve probably felt bad about leaving Tony alone since the rest of the Avengers aren’t around to go with him this time, with Natasha away on a SHIELD mission, Thor in Asgard, and Bruce on a date with Monica.
It's not a surprise to find the rest of the Avengers are lounging in Tony’s penthouse when Steve and Tony return. Definitely not a surprise to see them with smirks on as Steve stumbles in with Tony’s legs wrapped around his waist.
“This is amazing. Damn, Rogers. I heard you’re great at art but this is so much better than I thought.”
“I guess. But we’d be together. In a relationship. Until you get sick and tired of me—”
Kamala blushes, her cheeks almost the color of her shalwar kameez. “Thanks. I told my mom I was going to a friend’s party and she took me shopping so uh… Yeah.”
“Marry me?” Steve asks, his smile bright like the sun.
“Oh nothing,” Tony replies. “Just… Just didn’t expect you to swear, is all.”
Steve snaps out of his reverie. “What?”
This is the moment Tony expects Steve to freak out and realize what he just said and done. It’s one thing to out yourself as bisexual. But to say you’re in a relationship with the Merchant of Death?
Tony doesn’t speak for a long moment. “It was good.”
“Don’t Tony me,” Tony snaps. “Just fucking tell me.”
“You love Barnes. And I know he means a lot to you. I couldn't just watch you lose the love of his life again. Not when you've just found him.”
“Idiot,” Steve says fondly. “Then why did you think I was jealous of Carol? Of Reed?”
“A long time coming,” Tony amends. Steve huffs at that. “But still nice too.”
He could feel Natasha’s studious gaze on him. “Tony’s pansexual.”
“Verily. You look dashing.”
Steve rolls his eyes, his smile thinning. “Acting like I hate you was one of the hardest things I’ve done,” he whispers, as if afraid of his own confession. “You have to know that. You don’t know how many times I wanted to rip my cowl off and tell you.”
“Tony—”
Sam scoffs. “Please. No one could forget you, Rogers. Least of all, him.”
“Why are you slapping your face?”
Besides, what’s the point? Some wacky shit would happen or someone else would drag him into another conversation. It’s like a sign from the universe telling him that Steve and Tony aren't meant to be.
Thor's grin widens.
“Don’t you dare,” Tony bites back. “Mute.”
“Steve. Help!”
Steve’s pulse skips. “You didn’t have to do all that for me.”
telling anyone about his size kink. It’s already bad enough his own friends tease him mercilessly about it. He doesn’t need to add Tony to the mix.
“Well, Shellhead?” Steve murmurs, his grin plastered back on. “Marry me?”
But Steve can’t be here. He can’t. The brass wouldn’t let him in the army, let alone on a suicidal mission to rescue Tony.
fucked up.
Touches as light as a feather begin to creep up Tony’s right arm, leaving goosebumps in their wake. He would’ve jerked back in surprise if the scent of Steve’s mint shampoo hadn’t wafted through the air. The music slowly dissipates the higher Steve climbs, ceasing when his hand rests under Tony’s chin.
“Very funny. What’re you doing here?”
His face turns white.
“Seriously?” Steve breathed out. “You want us to get married?”
“Nope. Not in the slightest.” He sighs against his lips and fuck, he is warm and he smells faintly of pine and vanilla – a combination Tony never thought could make him weak in the knees. He can’t imagine how overwhelming it’ll be when the scent blocker fades away.
“When does it end?” Tony whispers.
Steve raises an eyebrow in doubt. It’s a well-known fact that everyone
“It can be a belated birthday present,” Tony amends. “Trust me. It’s worth the wait.”
“Go where?”
“Just open it.”
“I am not—”
Once, Tony rents the American Museum of Natural History for the whole day. Steve’s frantic when he finds out.
There’s a softness behind his eyes, full of affection and warmth, one that Tony has never seen in them before. Or maybe it’s always been there. He just chose not to notice.
Because the person on their helipad is someone he would never, ever picture being a potential partner for Tony.
“We’re toys,” Endgame Steve says exasperatedly. “It doesn’t matter which franchise or media we come from. Besides, your Steve’s from the Infinity War line.”
Tony follows suit. “Guess we are.”
He doesn’t wait for him, doesn’t look up to see his reaction, dashing off to find Jan so he can get the fuck home.
Bruce pushes his glasses further up his nose. “Got them a reservation at Le Bernardin.”
Steve mirrors him, pressing Tony closer to his chest, his heart feeling like it's about to burst. “Now you have me.”
“No. But—” Tony pauses, frowning. “Don’t look at me like that.”
“Captain,” Steve repeats. “Not Cap.”
Even so, Tony has been unattached for as long as Steve has known him. Or at least, to his knowledge. He’s never seen Tony have company over, save for Pepper and Rhodey whenever they could spare a second out of their busy schedules.
That should be the end of it. Except it isn’t.
“You’re neither. You’re a dork.”
Steve rolls his eyes, nudging him in the ribs affectionally before offering his arm.
It’s moments like these that remind Tony just how young Steve is. He may be almost a hundred but he’s also in his late-twenties too. It’s another reason why Tony wouldn’t be good for him.
Carol huffs. “Okay. So let’s say he winds up on your doorstep—”
“Well. Okay then.”
Unsurprisingly, the pillow is yanked out from under him. His head hits the mattress with a soft thump, a quiet groan tumbling out of his lips.
“I actually came up with it while I was eating a jar of Nutella. The large one. And before you ask, it’s not the humongous one. It’s the… The medium-sized ones? They’re bigger than the thirteen ounce ones.”
“Hey, I can be a team player,” Tony interjects. “I’ll keep things simple.”
“Good for you,” Steve says dryly.
Tony frowns. “Don’t think so. JARVIS?”
He snickers. “On the bright side, you got me now.”
Steve almost drops his own mug. “What?”
Tony waves a hand in dismissal before cupping Steve’s jaw. He couldn’t help but lean into the touch, basking in Tony’s touch, Tony’s warmth.
Tony laughs. “You make him happy. And that’s all that matters.” He pauses, something terrible crossing his thoughts. “Does anyone—”
“You’re Stark’s kid.”
Much to Steve’s mild annoyance and Tony’s glee, Steve does end up screaming Tony’s name later.
“You’re right,” Miles whispers in awe as Cartoon Steve screams Cartoon Tony’s name for the gazillionth time. “They like each other.”
Tonight, there seems to be less bustle around them. Vehicles roam at a snail’s pace instead of a standstill. People don’t move in compact crowds. Tony can hear himself breathe. It’s a good night.
Steve rears back, crossing his arms in front of his chest as he shoots Tony a look that’s both ruffled and impressed. “Tony!”
Steve makes a mental note to double their drills during the next training session.
“Why not? ‘Tis a fine name!”
Tony should say no. He should haul Steve to his feet and tell everyone to scram, tell them that this is all a misunderstanding. He should toss the ring far, far away and make a run for it.
Hammer’s frown deepens, pouting like a three-year-old getting kicked out of the sandbox. “How long?”
Steve scowls, placing his hands on his hips. “What do you mean ‘why not’?”
Kamala had invited Miles over to her place for a playdate and Miles had agreed, packing up his toys for his visit, including Steve and Tony. To say Tony’s excited and curious is an understatement.
“You don’t drink blood.”
He slams the door shut and smashes the bottle against the wall, ignoring the thumping behind him.
Tony barely spares any of them a second glance.
When Steve gets honorably discharged, he goes back to Brooklyn. Back to a world he barely recognizes.
If only Steve’s as suave as he in his writing.
God, he can’t wait to see what the headlines are going to say tomorrow.
convinced me to make my own ring, because you know, it’s supposed to be more meaningful or something. The ring’s made out of vibranium, by the way. I know, I know. Cliché. And yeah, blue’s cliché. But in my defense, your favorite color’s blue so I thought, ‘why not’? And—”
It’s only when they’re sitting in the escape pod, staring into the vast depths of the galaxy, does Steve let everything sink in.
“Oh. I used to crash at Tony’s place back when you guys were broken up.” Carol shrugs. “It was really quiet then since you know, no Avengers.”
Of course, he had been terribly wrong this time. Because here he is, strapped to a table in a Nazi base and his repulsor pump in dire need of a recharge as he waits for Arnim Zola to turn him into the next Baron Zemo.
“We’re not going to get married, Thor,” Steve says exasperatedly.
It’s nice. He’s
The urge to hurl is strong. He deals with it by pushing Steve onto his back.
And god, the beard. The goddamn fucking beard.
It’s weird to have Tony flirting at him this blatantly. Not unwelcoming. Just weird. Steve can’t remember a time where Tony did this with him.
“Mm-hmm.”
He shakes his head, whiling that thought away as he heads for his bedroom door.
Steve scoffs. “Let's not pretend that you wouldn't laugh at me if I was in your shoes.”
Tony grins and starts again.
A stranger – tall, blond, and beautiful – sits next to him, dressed in a button-down and khakis with the softest smile he's ever laid his eyes upon.
Steve groans.
Tony nods. “I think I know what you mean.”
She arches an eyebrow. “Army guys and I don’t really get along but I guess we could probably work something out. If Rhodey and Tony find you alright, so can I.” She turns away, reaching for the pancake batter. “So, what has Tony said about me? Good things, I hope.”
“Hey, I have the right to gloat about it. You're as bad as Reed when he gets into the zone.” Johnny smirks. “Even Sue could hardly tear him away from work.”
“She died around the time I started art school. Bronchitis.”
“I just— You both looked close to each other and the flirting—”
“You do, you know? All of us do. I know what’s it like to feel like you don’t deserve things. I get it.” She wipes the grease off her fingers with a napkin, his eyes still trained on him. “I still feel the same way too.”
“Or,” Steve begins, slipping his hand in Tony's, “we could get everything done, order takeout, and maybe hang out. In my room. If you want.”
“You called me one just this morning.”
Tony expects Steve to kiss the way he fights – dirty and quick and furious. Instead, it’s soft and languid, warm and familiar. There isn’t just heat in the kiss. There’s also affection, assurance. A confession.
Tony highly doubts that.
“Don’t need to thank me, Mr Stark,” Cap replies, sitting a short distance away from Tony. The gesture shouldn’t have stung as much as it does.
Tony rolls onto his back, his eyes glued to the ceiling. “I think you already know the answer to that.”
Ever since they watched the sunset perched on the edge of Miles’ window sill like a pair of idiots, Steve’s taken every opportunity to seek Tony out. Whenever Tony isn’t occupied with someone else, Steve sidles up to him to initiate conversation about anything random, from the latest beef between Sam and Bucky to the differences between cupcakes and muffins.
“I’m not—”
And because Reed’s his friend and Tony loves him, the words tumble out of his lips before he can stop them.
Tony stares at him with disbelief. “You’re insane.”
“You idiot.”
It’s something that’s happened ever since Afghanistan, intensified after the Battle of New York.
Tony nods but doesn’t seem convinced. “Okay. But did you—”
The mind and the eyes make an awfully creative pair.
Steve couldn’t help but huff. Tony can be overly dramatic and sulky and pouty when things don’t go his way. It’s infuriatingly adorable.
Tony puts on a thoughtful look, whistling lowly. “I won't lie, you got me intrigued. Sure. I'll do it. Just name me the time and place and I’ll be all theirs.”
As if on cue, Steve’s cheeks heat up.
“Hey. Take it easy.”
Once again, Tony’s blanketed in darkness, save for the dim light filtering from the outside. He could feel Steve settle down next to him, their thighs brushing. Tony barely suppresses a shiver at the contact. “Any particular reason you’re playing on the lower pitch?”
“You like it?” Steve asks, his voice oddly husky.
. “We need to talk.”
But then he notices Carol next to Tony and his heart drops and his nerves begin to flood in.
“I thought I did!” Tony protests, sounding genuinely upset. “C’mon, Spaceface. I would never,
“I thought… I thought I was going to lose you, Tony,” Steve murmurs, giving Tony’s hand a squeeze. “I couldn’t… Please, don’t send me away. Not again.”
But then he remembers the chips Pepper framed up in his bedroom and all the encouraging things people have said and takes a sip from his mug instead.
And it’s nice. Nice to see Steve’s stupid smile directed at
Tony snorts. “Don't mind him. He’s just upset you interrupted us from having life-affirming sex.”
Tony stares at it, drumming his fingers on his lap before he replies.
“You are excused.”
“Yeah. Clint, uh… Clint told me what you were planning to do tonight.”
“I don’t think he’s angry,” Peter’s voice suddenly pipes up next to him, snapping Tony out of his reverie. “I mean, he keeps giving you these sad puppy dog eyes, which are by the way—”
Tony wakes up with a start, his pulse racing.
Steve raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything. Tony hates that they’ve been reduced to this – strangers who tell each other lies.
“I guess the same reason why I wanted to kiss you tonight.”
Sharon cocks an eyebrow. “Really?”
Thor’s brow furrows. “Why not? In Asgard, it is not unlawful to court former lovers of comrades or friends.”
,” she said quietly. “Your father is wrong. You sound like an angel.”
Steve thinks of pulling him into one last hug, thinks of finally telling him everything, thinks of pressing his l—
And since Tony doesn’t deserve, he doesn’t ask.
“Wait,” Steve says, pulling away from Tony’s neck, “before we go further, I need to tell you something.”
“Uh… Aren’t you?”
“It’d look good on you,” he says when they stop in front of the hundredth clothing store.
Tony shakes his head. “Reed, he—”
“I’m in love with you,” he says, easy like breathing.
“I might. Just to give it a go.”
“There’s this guy I hate,” Tony says, his voice sluggish. “Really,
“You sure?”
“Your art is more recognizable than you think it is.” She pauses. “Tony loves your art too. I don’t know if he knows it’s you but knowing him, he probably does.”
For some reason, Tony insists on going on some weird trip down memory lane. He first takes Steve to brunch at the diner they first ate at, then drives him down to an indie theatre showing the whole Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the first set of modern movies he’s seen, before a quick trip around MoMA where they have spent hours admiring familiar artworks and the latest collection.
Tony snorts. “Sure. I bet that’s the only reason why you ordered three slices of apple pie.”
“You look like you wanna dig a hole and shove your head in it like an ostrich.”
Fuck, he really is the same old Hank Pym.
“You act like I’ve never walked a hundred yards before.”
Surprisingly, Tony looks downright impressed. “Gross. Gross but cool. Doubt your stomach liked that.”
“Have fun, boys!” Clint calls over his shoulder. “Use protect— Okay, okay. I’m going. Jeez, Bruce. Chill—”
do that again! I—”
“I didn’t know you’re pan.”
“I’m taking you out to dinner,” Steve replies, grinning. “Figured dinner is long overdue.”
But tonight Steve isn’t complimenting him as a teammate as a friend. Tonight, Steve gushes about Tony like a teenager in love. It’s something Tony never knew he needed.
Steve shrugs. “What can I say? I live for gossip.”
“No.”
eyes. Tony makes a mental note to reexamine that later.
“Yeah?”
“Uh, nothing. I was just…”
“The puppy dog eyes. You know I hate—” Steve flutters his eyelashes. “Ugh, fuck you, Steven.”
But then Kamala’s smile wavers with each passing second and Tony’s heart clenches at the sight of it.
Tony freezes. The noise around them grows louder.
Heat spreads across Steve’s cheeks. “Uh, yeah.”
“Oh no, you don’t,” Steve interrupts, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder. Years ago, Tony would’ve shrugged him off. Now, Steve’s glad Tony’s willing to let Steve touch him, let alone hand him things. “We’re having breakfast. Bruce's making breakfast tacos and you are going to join us.”
Tony's pretty sure his jaw is hanging the same way Mr Burke's is. Not for the same reasons, he's sure, but he's still stunned. It’s one thing to fake a relationship to ward off idiots like Hammer. There’s no reason for this whatsoever.
“Oh,” he says instead and returns to his canvas.
JARVIS pauses. “Would you like me to contact Cap—”
Steve inwardly scoffs. More like his unconscious volunteered for him. But he’s definitely not going to back out now. Not when Carol is his opponent.
Steve paints, wins awards, and fights off the pain called loneliness.
Tony whirls around, clutching his heart. “Jesus fuck, Barton. The hell are you doing here?” He frowns. “And why’re your clothes not stained with grease? Hell, why’re you even dressed up? I didn’t even know you own a button-up.”
Steve isn’t always lonely. Sometimes, his friends set him up with strangers and acquaintances. Other times, he takes someone home for the night.
“Don’t play dumb with me. That hostility with Carol. What’s that about?”
The melody eventually peters out as Tony’s fingers begin to still, the ache in his heart getting the better of him.
Anyone who says this is dead wrong.
God, if he only knew. If all of them only knew.
Tony sighs as Maria begins to bore him out of his mind.
And just like that, Steve’s anger dissipates.
. I can’t believe you’re attracted to a corpse. A fucking corpse!”
“Or at least someone you’re attracted to. ‘Cause let me tell you, nothing kills the mood better than—”
“Yup. We’ll grab dim sum for brunch.”
“I mean, I get Nat ‘cause you know, super spy and stuff but I thought she was pulling my leg—”
Steve rolls his eyes and beckons him over.
“Seventy-five.”
Steve’s shoulders sag but his blue eyes are still stormy with anger. “Jesus, Tony. I told you to drop it.”
“I think he had enough,” Tony admits a month before freshman year. “Mama finally convinced him to let me go to school with you.”
Steve grins, his gaze fond and heated.
“Holy shit. You’re amazing.”
Steve’s so screwed. Not only is Tony smart and hot, but he’s also considerate as fuck. It’s a tragedy that he can’t have Tony, more so that he’s going to lose him to someone else.
Tony can’t remember the last time he’s stepped inside. He probably could count the number of times he’s been here on one hand. Considering the cleaners’ weekly appearance, it shouldn’t be surprising that it’s neat and dust-free, from the wooden floors to the ceiling.
Tony breaks the kiss, tilting his head upwards. “Uh, JARVIS?”
Steve drifts down to meet Tony’s, the sight of those blue,
Because Tony’s on a date. And Steve’s stuck here without him.
Tony’s probably laying it on too thick (why, Steve has no clue), but he’s going to take all he can get because he’s a weak,
but it’s flirting all the same. If Tony wants someone to flirt with him, Steve’s his guy. In fact, he could—
Tony ignores the smug and knowing looks his fellow toys send his way and he definitely ignores Steve’s burning stare.
Tony should storm over, shake Cap's shoulders because it doesn’t make sense. Nothing makes sense. He can't be the same Steve Rogers Tony's in love with. Steve Rogers was funny and warm and everything Captain America isn’t. He’s full of light and love and deserved more than being a country’s propaganda.
ruin my music? For shame, Rogers. For
Steve arches an eyebrow, looking both curious and outright devastated at the same time. “Get along?”
As usual, Steve kisses back with the same intensity, pressing Tony closer to his body. He tastes of coffee and salt and everything Tony adores.
“We should watch a movie next week,” Tony begins. “In the cinema. It’s been a while since we went to the cinema.”
“Mm-hmm. Howard’s spawn. That’s me. Yup, yup.” He swipes the steaming mug of coffee off the counter before striding away. “Now, uh, if you gentlemen would excuse me, I’ll be going now.”
Tony scoffs, crossing his arms in front of him. “Excuse me. I am
But then he hears a quiet baritone next to him and then suddenly, he’s seized with the need to hear, see, know.
nothing. I can guarantee you Steve isn’t into Bucky in the movies either—”
When the Stark name begins to mean something, Steve and Tony hardly have time to themselves. There’s always someone by Tony's side. They ask for tutoring lessons, offer up their lunches, bat their eyelashes.
“What’re you—”
“Hey,” Miles’ mother begins, popping her head into the room. “Dinner’s ready.”
Natasha scoffs. “I don’t believe you. The Steve I know is too stubborn for his own good. The Steve I know has been pining over Tony Stark since you guys met but never made a move because he’s an idiot. The Steve I know thinks that this proposal is the only chance you might have with Tony—”
“I highly doubt that. No one but you could build it.”
Then it hits him. She doesn’t smell of sandalwood or vanilla. She smells of peonies and apples.
Fingers latch around his wrist. It’s warm, comforting, and all too familiar.
“How?” he whispers.
“What New Year’s Eve part—” Tony’s eyes widen, the words finally registering in his head. “Oh fuck.”
, Steve thinks hysterically.
And then suddenly, his hand is no longer gripping the countertop.
Steve nods, a small smile forming on his face. “Been a while, huh?”
“I don’t need super soldier memory to remember it,” Steve replies, sounding oddly petulant and mournful at the same time. Then again, Steve has been petulant and mournful since the first moment Miles pulled him out of his box. Acting like Tony’s biggest enemy and regret simultaneously.
“Tony—”
She snorts, tucking her feet under her. “Fine. Spoilsport.”
His lips tug to the side, staring at him with stark disbelief.
“Tony—”
“No! I really—”
“It’s fake.”
“Nope,” Steve replies, holding his hand up. “Not even close.”
“Gotta admit,” Tony says as they settle onto the ground. “I missed coming by here.”
He flounders over to the vending machine, feeding it a dollar.
“Oh, I know. She told me about your...thing a couple of years back,” Bruce says flippantly. “I’m fine with it.”
Tony stares at it for a brief moment before gingerly taking it from her. From where Steve's standing, they look like ordinary daisies but Tony immediately brightens up at them. “Wow. Honestly, I’m not much of a flower guy but these look amazing.” He buries his nose between the petals, sucking in a breath. “They smell amazing too.”
“Why not?”
“They’re just being mother hens,” Tony says, rolling his eyes. “Ignore them.”
“Fuck off. It’s morning.”
“And… And I’m okay now. I'm fine. Alive. You can go now. I'm sure you’ll rather be with him right now. You could call Nat in or Bruce or—”
Tony shrugs. “Gotta beat everyone to it.”
Steve perks up at the question. He does it a lot whenever Tony tries to make conversation with him, which is hardly ever. “What’s weird?”
“Yeah, Cap,” Clint adds, smirking. “Why’re you so— Ow!”
Steve whips his head up in surprise. “What?”
Now, MODOK and AIM seem to be in the mood to do just that.
Steve licks his lips, the flush on his cheeks darkening. Tony’s never wanted anymore as badly as he does now.
And that’s when he realizes he’s sprawled on the mat, Tony holding his face in his hands.
Steve smirks. “Yes.”
Tony groans, burying his face in his pillow.
Steve blinks, his eyes drifting to the sky.
“You’re laughing with your eyes. That counts.” Tony wiggles on the spot and unfortunately rolls off the mountain of lights in the process.
“Tony—”
“Five!”
“It’s cute to see you blush. Your ears get all pink and you duck your head like—” Steve’s grin widens. “Yup. You’re doing it right now.”
The other three are much smugger about the whole thing, clapping them on the shoulder and telling them under no circumstances can they have sex anywhere but their own bedrooms. Steve has never felt this mortified and turned on in his life.
“I mean, I wouldn’t have kissed you if I didn’t. Or let you win at basketball—”
Dashing is a total understatement. Steve can’t even find the words to describe Tony. With his hair slicked back and dressed in a two-piece, he can’t remember the last time he’s seen Tony this put-together. Then again, Tony always looks put-together, always looks like he’s dressed to kill. Impress.
“Maybe I just needed to find the right partner.”
Steve juts his chin out, wiggling his fingers in anticipation. “Fine. I’ll show you reflexes.”
“You should. You deserve them.” Tony glances away before Steve could reply. “These cookies any good?”
“You have a ten am meeting with Miss Potts and the board members,” JARVIS answers. “You also scheduled a video call with Colonel Rhodes at noon.”
This time, the smile that spreads across Tony’s lips is soft. Genuine.
“But I have—” Tony scowls. “Stop that.”
Relationship? Nothing.
“Only because I told you too. You came out of the workshop to grab more coffee!”
“Tony,” Steve begins, beaming in a way Tony has never seen before and fuck Tony’s heart is shattering again, “this is Bucky. Bucky, Tony.”
Tony could barely conceal his snort.
“What?”
“Well, all the cards we sell here are all handmade by me. So.”
It’s huge. Steve thinks they could fit two zoos in it. Tony thinks three.
He looks like he’s just seen someone die.
But then suddenly Carol’s at his side, excusing the both of them and drags him over to where the food is.
“Thank you.”
“Don’t.”
Tonight, his dreams are neither of those instances. Instead, it’s one of his favorite memories – the both of them playing the piano in the old Stark Mansion. They don’t do it very often, his mother usually away on business and Tony himself at school. But they always manage to squeeze in an hour or two whenever their paths cross.
Slowly, Tony finds himself growing accustomed to the dates, even though he knows he shouldn’t treat them as real dates.
“Yeah. He’s as gone for you as you’re for him.”
“Yes, we will,” Tony hisses back.
“I don’t mask my heartbeat,” Steve counters. “C’mon. You’d had to know how it races when I’m around you—”
It feels like a homecoming.
“But have you
Carol chuckles, rubbing circles over Tony’s back. Steve quickly glances away. “Let me guess, happens every day?”
finger.
“You heard me. We need to end this—” Tony gestures between them. “This—thing. We can’t be fuck buddies anymore.”
eyes are boring into Tony’s and they’re slowly dilating and all Tony wants to do is press him down. Hold him down and lean forward to—
Maybe it’ll work tomorrow.
“You think so?” Tony asks.
“He won’t remember me.”
“You think I don’t like you back?”
Why someone who looks exactly like Steve?
Which is probably why he thought Wanda being stuck in—
Tony glances out of the window, nursing a mug of hot chocolate. It’s two in the morning. Ten at night somewhere else. The perfect time to pop into the nearest liquor store and purchase their finest bottle of whiskey.
Tony takes them all gingerly, offering a shy smile and thanks of his own every time.
Steve who has the same startling blue eyes as Captain America.
With care, Tony begins to pull his arm away. Steve catches him halfway with a puzzled look.
Tony clears his throat, his gaze to the ceiling. “Look, can we forget everything that happened the moment I woke up? ‘Cause the last thing I need is Barnes’ fist in my—”
“I never wanted that,” Tony says fiercely, dropping his tablet onto his lap. “I never wanted to be CEO of a company with blood on its hands. I never wanted the spotlight. I never wanted…” He sighs, raking his fingers through his hair in frustration. “I never wanted anything or anyone but you.”
“Can it.”
Steve cocks an eyebrow. “To what?” he asks, a hint of challenge in his tone.
He scowls. “Why’re you guys following me?”
The wine, the beer, the whiskey. They should’ve helped heal him. Or at least, help numb the pain.
Since all the instruments in the tower are either bought by Tony or inherited from his mother, they’re all kept in his apartment. He did consider shifting them down and building a communal music room for a time, but immediately discarded the idea when he found out that he was the only musically inclined Avenger.
Steve swears there’s a flicker of disappointment that crosses Tony’s face before it vanishes.
Steve hums, wrapping his arm around Tony’s waist to pull him closer to his side and oh, that’s nice. Very, very nice.
“And romantic,” Natasha adds.
Tony imagines himself making a dumb quip about the predicament they're in. He could imagine Steve breaking into laughter, imaging Steve tossing his work away to kiss the life out of Tony and—
“Tony,” he says, sounding a little shy. “Hi.”
“Is he happy?”
Heat crosses his cheeks. “I don't think that's why they're looking at me,” he says, gesturing to their arms.
“Easy for you to say. You’re both from Endgame.”
He groans. “I knew I shouldn’t have called myself ‘Roger Stevens’.”
He doesn’t think about how Tony should be sitting across him, stuffing his face with coffee and waffles.
Tony blinks. “Wow. Oh wow. Okay.” He gives Steve another peck on the lips and nuzzles his cheek. “C’mon, put me down. Let’s go.”
times. I know you’re stubborn but you could’ve just taken the loss. Or you know, not butt in in the first place.”
She lets out an annoyed huff. “Okay, guess I was wrong. Look, you shouldn’t assume—”
Sucking in a breath, Tony braces himself, counts to ten, and spins on his heel.
“Yeah,” Tony murmurs as he leans forward. “Yeah, there really is.”
They lapse into an awkward silence, which is unusual for them. Steve hates it when this happens. They barely even got into a disagreement.
“Like I get you and Carol don’t get along because of some petty rivalry but— Oh.”
Steve’s brow furrows. “Is it so hard to believe that I’d be mad at him for talking shit about the guy I’ve been pining for years?”
Tony sighs, shaking his head. There’s a hardened determination in Tony’s eyes. Steve doesn’t know what to make of that.
Just like that, the words turn to ash in his mouth.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that.
“Like you said, I’ll always come for you.”
“Did I miss something?” Tony asks, his amused voice floating into the room.
Tony’s eyebrows arch. “I can’t—”
Tony breaks into a grin as he begins to play. Steve echoes the melody, his lips melding into that boyish smile Tony both loves and hates.
“Can we not talk about this right now?” Steve interrupts, his time firmer. “Please?”
Tony wills the thought away. He’s not going down that path. Not at all. After all, they’re freaking toys. All of that doesn’t apply to them. It doesn’t explain Steve’s weird demeanor around Tony. But that’s Steve’s problem, not his.
“Just saying the truth, is all.”
“Traitor,” Tony mutters. “All of you, traitors. Ganging up on me.”
The days after are absolutely miserable.
And just like that, he remembers.
Steve scowls. “Yes.”
“And just when I thought I had one over him,” Tony mutters.
“‘Tis a pity.” Thor sighs. “Once again, Midgardians prove to be the oddest species I’ve known.”
How the fuck did he forget?
a journalist asks him once. It’s an interview done via email about an upcoming exhibition he’s participating in. The theme is ‘Love in Color’.
And then there’s the man.
An awkward silence fills the air. Tony has never felt so out of his depth in forever.
The smile on Steve’s face slides off. “Tony—”
“Then, you know what I think about you,” Steve replies. Then his voice drops lower, a little husky to Tony’s ears, his eyes half-lidded and dark with promise. “And how I feel about you.”
Then, Tony’s up next.
Just as quickly as the anger appeared, it vanishes from Steve's face, replaced with hope and caution. He's looking at Tony as if his heart is in Tony's hands and not the other way around. Which can’t be true because in what world does Tony have Steve’s heart?
“About what?” Tony counters, irritation slipping in. “You gotta be specific here.”
“Nope. I really like to keep my brain inside my head, thanks,” Tony replies hastily. “Besides, I’m meeting with her for lunch next Saturday and—”
He turns away and gets to his feet, picking his clothes and pieces off the floor.
“It is,” Natasha agrees. Tony starts at that statement but then remembers
All his life he’s been told he could never be enough to be like Steve. What makes him think he could even compete to be enough
“Okay,” Carol says as they lay on the cold hard ground in his apartment. “Indulge me for a bit.”
He doesn’t think about how Tony should be by his side, laughing at a joke Sharon made.
Thor grins. “The most. It is missing the delicacies and mead from Asgard. Fortunately, the food is excellent enough by Asgardian standards. Give my regards to the caterer! However, that is not why I am here to speak to you both about.” He tilts his head in Kamala’s direction. “I was wondering if you could spare Tony for a moment.”
“See something you like?” Tony teases, leaning against the counter.
Tony frowns. “He… He likes art. So I guess something artsy?”
Tony’s in front of him again, flashing a nervous smile, one that Steve couldn’t help but clumsily return.
Tony stills, his heart freezing in his chest. Steve seems to share his shocked sentiment, his startling azure eyes wide under the warm sun rays. Tony inwardly curses Hasbro for giving Steve his signature baby blues because, god. Just, god.
“Thanks. I got them last week from Pep.”
Steve’s leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the Crew’s Quarters, raising a glass in Tony’s direction.
It takes everything in Tony not to scream. All he could do is stiffen in place, the melody he’s playing coming to an abrupt and dissonant halt.
Steve groans. “God, I keeping saying the wrong things,” he mutters before raising his voice. “I thought so. At first. I mean, what else can I offer? I’m just a kid from Brooklyn. No one special. You could have anyone. Why settle for me?”
“I thought you hated me.”
many things he wants to say. All the words and sentences clash in his head, swirling around in a whirlpool of anxiety, hope, and fear.
Steve spins around, his cheeks warming further. “Ma—”
Once, Tony would’ve chalked Steve’s behavior up to the alcohol. But then he remembers those blue eyes staring him down in the middle of New York, a man with gold running through his veins, and clenches his fists.
“We were both stupid,” Steve corrects.
This whole night better not be a dream or AIM or some stupid villain playing tricks on him. Because this—this—
Steve swears his arrhythmia is going to get him before the night ends because holy
Steve falters, withdrawing. Tony quietly mourns the loss of his touch.
“Well, they’re idiots. Whoever they are. Because you—” Tony's gaze softens. “You deserve a million gifts.”
And jeans. Don’t get him started on jeans. They never, ever fail to accentuate Tony’s—
Steve takes the ring out from the velvet box gingerly, as if he’s afraid it’ll break. “You’ve always had my heart,” he murmurs as he examines the inscription on the silver band. “Wow.”
“Fuck.”
“Jan?”
“I could turn them away if you’d like.”
“No, it’s not!” Clint exclaims. “We didn’t—”
Steve snorts, shifting in place. “That was awful.”
“Seconded,” Tony chimes. “I mean, as hot as it would be to fuck in space—”
Warm light gradually begins to fill the room as Steve shuffles inside. Tony could guess what it must be like to step inside the room for the first time. It must feel foreign, considering he’s a Stark. Starks are all about science, not art.
His mother is thankfully nowhere to be found when he ducks into the back office. She’s probably in the bathroom.
Steve scowls. “You’ll never let that go, huh?”
He gets a C note in response.
“I know what you’re trying to do.”
Tony doesn’t think he’s ever seen a more stunning sight in his life.
Something floods through him but Steve pushes it away before he can figure out what it is. “Then shouldn’t he be here instead of you?”
“Can we not bring that up?”
Fuck, why did Steve even say that? What was the point? He could’ve easily stared Hammer down. H didn’t need to lie at all. He didn’t need to lie about the flecks of hazel in Tony’s eyes when sunlight shines down from the right spot, about how he finds Tony’s sleepy rambles adorable, about how he’s been in love with Tony the moment they met.
And yet, there’s the rational part of Steve telling him that this has to be a dream because Tony’s taken by Carol and Steve’s… Steve’s…
Steve huffed. Another reason why Tony would never, ever go for him. Because they met as Captain America and Iron Man, not Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Not to mention the fact that Tony grew up as a Captain America fan.
Steve stills, his heart leaping in his chest. “This has nothing to do with me.”
Tony rolls his eyes, flinging the covers off his body. “I’ll be there. Don’t worry your pretty little head about me being— What?”
Steve would’ve thought Natasha’s making a joke if Tony hadn’t blushed.
Kate crosses her arms, shooting Clint a scowl. “This dummy here wouldn’t stop pestering me for a rematch.”
For a long moment, neither of them breathes a word out. Tony keeps his gaze trained on the horizon and hopes his fingers would stop shaking soon.
The rest of Show and Tell goes without a hitch and before Tony knows it, he’s back to sitting in total darkness for the next several hours. His favorite activity.
He is never,
There are camera flashes everywhere. Journalists who’re eager to speak to him. Superheroes from different factions mingling. It’s all overwhelming.
Tony nods, looking chastised. “Right shutting up now.”
Tony takes a much-needed step back. “You two have fun,” he says before shooting them a half-hearted wink. “But not too much fun.”
“I know you’re not sick,” Aunt Peggy says much later when everyone has left. Or at least that’s what she says.
Tony stares at him in disbelief. “God, do you hear yourself right now? Does it make sense to—”
“You make her sound badass,” Clint says.
When Tony wakes in the morning to Steve’s beautiful face and beautiful smile, he knows it’s time to end this.
“I am not sulking,” Steve snaps.
From the moment they’ve met, Johnny seems to have taken a shine to Tony, following him around like a lost puppy and flirting with him like there’s no tomorrow. It's bizarre. It's not like Tony's friendship with Reed, which is built on science and research. They barely have anything in common, besides their reputations as ‘playboys’.
They both beat steadily under them.
But it doesn’t matter what they think. Because Tony’s dressed up. Tony’s dressed up and absolutely gorgeous. Just for Steve.
They try their best to navigate their way over to Tony’s bed without breaking their make-out session. It’s a little difficult considering the mess, but they manage to tumble onto the bed without any injury.
Endgame Steve shrugs his shoulders. “That’s the movie. We’re toys. We don’t have to conform to what the movie says. Besides, Pep’s cool with it.”
Steve’s glower deepens, his fingers digging into Tony’s hand. Tony would’ve said something if he isn’t too busy freaking out over Steve’s sudden anger. “This isn’t funny, Tony. Bucky and I— We’re not a thing. We never have been.”
He knows there’s more to the story, more he needs to know, should know. Then again, maybe he doesn’t need to know. He’s going to die soon.
Oh, how he longs for those quiet moments. The thought of laying his head on Steve’s lap as Steve reads and Tony works sounds like heaven right now.
Tony barks out a laugh, a retort on the tip of his tongue when Steve silences him by brushing his lips against Tony’s. Just like the kiss before, it sets him on fire.
Above them, The National is finishing their ninth sad song of the night. Somewhere in the distance, several voices are butchering the birthday song.
Again, Tony’s train of thought disappears. Because this can’t be real. Can’t be at all. Steve can’t be in love with him. Steve can’t—
“A dumb dog who chose a bloodsucker as his mate.”
“Please,” Tony said, snorting. “Billionaire here.”
Tony nods slowly, as if it physically pains him to do so. “Yeah. James Barnes, right? I think you call him Bucky?”
Steve snorts. “Yeah.”
It's a tempting offer but Steve knows that it's the wrong thing to do.
Natasha arches an eyebrow, peering over her magazine. “Did something happen between the three of you?”
“Hey—”
Just like with every one of Tony’s invitations, Steve perks up at the idea. But then he remembers golden blonde hair and startling blue eyes and he deflates.
“Stay. Stay with me.”
taste of blood,” Steve breathes, tightening his grip on Tony’s waist and god, Tony wants. He wants and needs everything.
“T’was a marvelous contest!” Thor says, grinning from ear-to-ear as they land on the helicarrier. “We should do this again! This time we will—”
Steve’s lips part and then shut.
Cap doesn’t rise to the bait, keeping his attention on his shield instead. Tony takes the opportunity to inch towards his clothes. They’re not as dry as he would like them to be but Tony needs to get dressed before the captain sees—sees—
Thor strides over with a flock of people tailing him. There’s a broad smile plastered on his face, one that promises mischief and challenges.
“Tony told me to check on you. Said you randomly disappeared on him and Carol after breaking the bar table.”
“No, you’re not. I—” Steve chuckles. “I guess we’re both idiots.”
The air hangs heavy between them as Tony resumes playing, his gaze trained down. “My mom and I usually played together. She’d be on the higher pitch and I’d be on the lower. This piano’s actually my mom’s. Had it moved from the mansion when I moved out to Malibu. Had it moved again when I moved here. Yeah.”
Just thinking about the whole thing sets him on edge. The self-satisfied grin on Carol’s face as she downs Steve for the fifty-eighth time, Thor’s roaring cheers, Natasha’s disapproval, and Tony’s—
“We did,” Tony agrees. “But that means we have the rest of our lives to make up to each other.”
Tony shrugs. “It’s one of the few things, skills, I don’t flaunt. Not something people are interested in, anyway. Not gonna sway any board members by playing fucking Für Elise for them. Sides’, there’s a high chance I wouldn’t even play. Well, maybe if you get me drunk enough and near an instrument.
“If you say so, sir.”
Even the strange looks Steve used to shoot Jan and Tony have ebbed away. This time, he seems more genuine with his smiles and tone, even if they waver every now and then.
“Tony did tell me most of the stuff online about him is crap.”
Steve shrugs. “If it helps, she only agreed to the whole thing since she has an ongoing bet with Fury.”
Bruce gives Steve a once-over. “You look sharp.”
If Tony had any lingering doubts before, they’re all blown away in the storm.
The kiss this time is longer but as soft and warm, and so much better than Steve imagined. He is one lucky,
gone. Just ask Nat or Carol. Heck, ask anyone. Even Sam can tell you I’ve been gone for you and he hasn’t been on the team for long.”
“They’re one of the worst things mankind has—”
“Oh nothing,” he says, shrugging his blazer on. “Just thought that’s nice of you. To do that.”
“Same old Tony.”
“When she’s not embarrassing me, sure.”
Tony glances at his king-sized bed with doubt.
Peter straightens. “Yes, sir.”
“Steve!”
Steve’s fears only get worse as the days go by. Unlike the rest, she’s tight-lipped, refusing to divulge the identity of Tony’s date or any details about the date. The only thing she’s willing to share is that she'll be stopping by the Tower to pick Tony up.
“And that’s the problem. People only see me as Captain America. No one bothers to get to know me behind the mantle.”
Tony shakes the thought away. “You want me to lead or—”
“No, it’s not—”
That’s how Steve and Tony have their first kiss.
When Tony opens the door, he doesn’t expect to see James Buchanan Barnes on the other side.
Steve’s eyebrows shoot up. “How did you know it was me?”
“It’s fine, you worrywart. Go give Steve your present.” She flashes Steve a warm smile. “Happy birthday again, Steve.”
“Is this some kind of sick joke?”
Things have been better lately, but only because both of them have been avoiding the elephant in the room, electing professionalism whenever their paths cross.
“You sure?”
“I can take the floor,” Tony says as he exits his bathroom. “I’ve slept on worse.”
“It might’ve gotten to a point when you couldn’t,” Steve says quietly. “Howard could’ve snapped and… I didn’t want you to do that. Not for me.”
But it’s different now. Now, Tony gets to reach over and hold Steve’s hand. Now, Steve gets to kiss his cheek. Now, they get to look at each other like they’re head over heels in love.
It’s already bad enough she’s around. Now, she’s taking up all of Tony’s time. Tony who has stuck to her side ever since the party started, Tony who kissed Carol on the cheek (life is so unfair) and teased her about her cat, Tony who shoved slices of pineapple and ham pizza at her  even though Tony absolutely loathes pineapple on pizza but Steve loves it, and sure, Tony gave him the one with the most pineapple but—but—
It’s a great time, overall. It’s always fun meeting new toys and swapping stories with fellow Tonies is always a blast.
They had gone out for lunch like they usually do when both of their schedules align. Their lunches usually differ depending on who’s craving what. Since Steve was in the mood for a good old-fashioned hot dog, they snagged some from their usual hot dog stand and headed to Central Park, snapping up a couple of milkshakes along the way.
“You’re pretty obvious about your feelings,” Steve replies. He moves to take Tony’s hand in his. “You look at me like I’m worth something—”
Nope. No sirree.
“It was pretty good,” Tony agrees. “But not enough to warrant a second date though.”
Tony tells her that. She shakes her head, shushes him and rocks him to sleep like she did all those years ago when he was young and felt like something.
Steve’s first instinct is to yell a resounding ‘no’ and an ‘over my dead body’ before hightailing out of the building. There is no way he’s going to help Tony get the person he’s been pining for.
Steve almost spits out his coffee.
Hulk grunts before shifting into Bruce.
Tony’s brow furrows. “You hate dancing.”
“Nothing!” he exclaims, his voice a couple of decimals higher than usual. “I just— Yeah.”
“You were jealous,” Tony says, a smirk forming on his lips. “Steve Rogers was jealous of Justin Hammer.”
“Did Howard—”
Steve finally breaks.
Tony turns the basket around and pushes it away from him, allowing Steve to take in the cards without snapping his neck. The little gesture makes his stomach churn.
Steve couldn’t help but break into a smile of his own.
“Wha—”
“Why not?”
It’s times like these that he wishes he could drink. But then he remembers the promises he made to his friends and he slumps his forehead against the machine.
Steve's eyes widen, his mouth parted. But then the doors shut and just like that, Tony's left alone with a shattered heart.
They both freeze.
“Ugh, you know what. Pretend I didn’t say that.” Tony’s grin melds into something softer, which definitely doesn’t make Steve’s heart skip. Not even in the slightest. “Anyway since we’ve been kicked out, wanna head up to my place? We can play chess or watch a movie or—”
Steve cocks his head to the side. “Aren’t we already? Why do it tomorrow?”
“Clint Francis Barton,” Natasha whispers. Steve’s certain he wouldn’t have heard her if it wasn’t for the serum, “you’re insane.”
“Go on.”
Steve doubts that. A lot.
“I can hear you think,” Steve begins, his eyelids still shut. He holds out Tony's blazer.
A shower definitely didn’t warrant that behavior from him, that’s for sure.
Steve blinks, his world coming to a standstill. “You— You do?”
“Good. Good.” Tony grins. “Anyway since we got out of cleanup duty, how about we—”
“Then how can you be so sure they’re dating?”
“They can wait another day," Tony dismisses. “Or night. We could definitely make it back in time.”
Just as he predicted, Tony wins.
“I know,” Clint says wistfully. “I know.”
“Sure you can,” Steve says before brushing his lips against Tony’s cheek.
Someone who’s Tony’s soulmate.
And maybe he was once upon a time. A time when he didn’t know Steve Rogers.
Her features soften. “Penny for your thoughts?”
get together, Steve tries not to be bitter about it.
“So,” Steve says later that night when they’ve returned home. “Had fun with Endgame Steve?”
Pushing away every thought in his head, Steve forces himself to focus on detangling Tony from the clutches of pumpkin lights. Thankfully, it isn’t as complicated as Steve thought it would be.
Or at least, for a day.
Bucky sighs, wiping his face. “Steve’s not gonna like this.”
“I don’t know!” Tony shrieks.
“Are you?” Tony asks, his emotions finally getting the better of him.
, on the other hand, tried to kiss me because you wanted to one-up me. Am I right or am I right?”
Tony’s lips thin. “Yeah. I guess. Anyway, not the point. I didn’t come here to prod at you. I just wanted to ask if you want to grab breakfast with me. You missed it today.” His eyebrows knit together. “You hardly miss breakfast.”
If only Steve could agree with him.
Steve feels his cheeks heat up. “I’m a nobody. A nobody—”
His stomach betrays him with a sudden growl, freezing him in his tracks.
Steve and Sharon. The golden couple. With their perfect blonde hair and perfect blue eyes and perfect teeth and perfect everything.
“Did it work?” Thor asks.
Tony hums as he snakes his hands around Steve’s neck. “This bloodsucker is also in the mood to suck something else.”
This time when Tony opens the door, he finds a letter on his doorstep.
Considering his friends’ habits, it’s weird for the place to be void of people and noise. Even at this time of the day, there’s always someone hanging around. Thor and Clint would be perched on the couch, playing some video game. Natasha would be leafing through a book or magazine.  Steve would be curled on the loveseat with his nose buried behind his sketchbook. Bruce is an occasional sight but when he’s around, he’d be scrolling through his StarkPad and quietly talking to himself.
“Um, well—”
Tony couldn’t help but roll his eyes. The Burkes are one of the last people he’d want to run into. They’re one of his father’s old business rivals, a rivalry he could barely give a shit about to even continue. Yet somehow, the Burkes never seem to let it go, constantly feeding his backhanded compliments and stealing his contracts.
“I am making sense,” Tony insists as he stares up at Steve, dazed and awed. “You like me. Romantically.”
Tony sighs, sinking back under the covers, sinking back under his self-loathing and misery. “You and me both.”
“Uh-huh. Sure you are.”
Her eyelids flutter in puzzlement. “Dating? They’re
There’s an exhibition at the MoMA being planned in celebration of the superhero community, from the Fantastic Four to the X-Men to the Avengers.
“Everyone’s right,” Endgame Steve mutters. “Being oblivious is a Tony Stark trait.”
“Why?” Steve asked. “Is this a financial benefits thing?”
Just like before, Steve’s blue,
“What? I can’t be the only one that could feel the tension between the both of them. Which by the way, you can cut it with a knife—”
“There’s an afterparty.”
“It’s fine.”
Johnny waves his hand around in dismissal. “Oh, you know. Thought I’d get Tony to take a break. Figured he needs some fresh air, maybe some eye-candy to ogle.”
And like she said too. If Tony isn’t meant to be his, Steve will just have to live with it. He’s done it before. He’ll do it again.
“Ready to go?”
The media. The
Steve makes quick work of the remaining wires and not before long, Tony’s free. Tony takes Steve's outstretched hand, letting himself be hoisted to his feet.
“Just get naked, Steven.”
“Yikes is right.”
“Morning!” she greets cheerily as she deposits a pancake onto an empty plate.
He groans, squeezing his eyes shut.
Something heavy settles in his chest, something Steve knows all too well. Something he has feared all these years of secretly loving Tony from afar.
“Ah, Captain Danvers,” Thor begins. “I believe it is my turn to—”
“You didn’t tell me you were having a pizza party,” Tony remarks coolly.
Steve clamps up but only for a brief second. “He doesn’t like it?”
“Of course I’d notice,” Tony exclaims, sounding surprisingly offended. His eyes soften, his voice lowering. “I’ve always noticed you.”
Steve’s requesting access to Tony’s room.
Nothing was out of the ordinary then. The two of them just sat and ate and chatted about everything under the sun. Life was good.
Steve hums. “Call it a hunch,” he drawls before pulling Tony into another kiss.
Steve grins fondly, reaching over to give their clasped hands a reassuring squeeze. Tony's heart flutters. “He hates it when I gush. Makes him all nervous and gooey.”
“It was nice talking to you,” Steve begins, rubbing the back of his neck. “I had a great time.”
“To save my hide from the board and press?”
“A splendid idea, Barton!” Thor cries, a little too enthusiastically. “I am certain we would have the most fun!”
“Say what?” Tony asks.
“This isn’t a pity date, is it? ‘Cause let me tell you—”
“I’m not trying to stop you from—from falling in love,” Steve says, the words heavy on his tongue. “I just— Well, I— You know—”
It’s just that Steve planned on proposing to him the day after tomorrow.
“I know.”
“You know you could’ve called, right?” Tony snorts. “You always were a dramatic asshole.”
“No! He’s not— I’d never— That’d be like dating your brother! Gross!”
“He’s a part of me.”
Of course. Of fucking course.
Steve exhales, his eyes fluttering shut. “Didn’t Tony tell you?”
Jesus, how the hell is he going to move on? How the fuck is he going to survive seeing Tony arm-in-arm with his new boyfriend on Monday?
She sighs. “I know. It's hard sometimes. To stop feeling that way. But really, talk to Steve. Tell him.”
“Hey,” he manages, inwardly cringing at how breathless he sounds.
“What makes you sure they’re not dating?” Steve counters.
Natasha just smiles serenely.
“Dad said no,” Tony replies the day after. “But he’s out of town next week and Mama said I could come over.”
A wide grin spreads across Tony’s lips. “Ah ha!” he cries out, jabbing a finger in Steve’s direction. “I knew you were hungry.”
“Can I take you to dinner?” he breathes out.
Steve can vividly recall how it all began.
After his third successful exhibition as Roger Stevens, Steve finally decides to commit.
But he must’ve said out loud because Tony’s letting out a quiet chuckle. “That’s because I’ve been crushing on you ever since we met.”
Steve sets his controller down, tearing the wrapper off.
“C’mon, Tony,” Hammer urges, draping an arm around Tony’s shoulder, and fuck, he wants that slimy thing off him right now. “Stay. Let’s chat. Grab a drink.”
, he titles when he finishes it and puts it up for sale online.
That’s okay. She’s not meant to replace Steve. Never was to.
Steve’s looking at him with an incomprehensible look, his lips parted. All of a sudden, Tony feels self-conscious.
Tony snaps out of his reverie, breaking into a smile of his own. “Steven.”
“I— Uh—”
Tony stumbles, almost tripping over his own feet. Sharon steadies him with a tight grasp. After all this time, she’s always there to catch him when he falls.
Even if she has blue eyes a couple shades darker or smiles at Tony like he hangs the moon and the stars in the sky and makes him feel like he’s worthy.
Steve tries not to think about it as he throws himself into his work. Dwelling on it, wondering about it, would just make the whole thing worse.
“Okay.”
“Steve,” Tony begins exasperatedly. “I’ve been out for years. It’s all over the internet.”
In loopy black ink, is his name.
“How’s my bestie doing?”
He smiles faintly. “Something like that.”
Out of the corner of his eyes, Natasha rolls her eyes.
It’s a bad idea. A very,
“Captain Rogers, Mr Odinson, Mr Banner, Miss Romanoff, and Mr Barton are requesting entrance.”
Tony blinks, his mind still frazzled. “What?”
Steve doesn’t dress up often and since they’re meeting up on the rooftop, that could only mean one thing.
“Don’t you dare—”
Maybe Tony would decide to stay and live among the wonders of another planet. Maybe Tony decides that Sif and him would make a great match (Steve has his doubts) and gets engaged on the spot. Maybe Asgard and its people are no match for Earth and Steve.
“I can tell.” Tony’s eyes dart to Steve. “Well, you cleaned up nicely. Gotta hot date yourself too?”
Steve’s footsteps must’ve been loud because their head twists behind, a pair bright blue eyes eyeing him with genuine warmth.
Steve leans forward, craning his neck to catch a glimpse of the front. “Ah. That one.”
Tony can’t— He can’t be—
Somehow, some-fucking-how, Tony always seems to chase away the people he cares about.
It was also the last song his mother played and sung to him. December 16th, 1991. The day Tony had been home for the holidays. The day his parents had decided to leave for the Bahamas.
“You know I’ve moved on—”
Steve groans, burying his face in his hands. “Oh god.”
“What I want,” he murmurs, slipping onto Steve's lap. Tony drapes his arms over his shoulders, brushing his lips against Steve's ear, “is for you to fuck me into this mattress.”
Tony exhales heavily. “I’m not saying it isn’t. God knows that everyone needs all the support they can get. It’s just that we shouldn’t. It’s not right. I may be pan but you’re—”
. But at the same time—
eyes.
“Steve—”
Steve Rogers who decided that he wasn’t worth the effort anymore.
“You sound upset,” Steve counters, sounding serious now. “If you want me to stop, I can. I would’ve stopped if you told me before. We can go back in and tell everyone the truth.”
Tony purses his lips. “Well, you do say a lot of shit when you’re mad.”
Despite Tony’s protests, he later finds himself sprawled on Natasha’s couch with a box of pepperoni pizza between them.
Tony almost breaks down.
“I don’t mean that she salutes the flag before she sleeps. Unless she does it now but—” Clint pauses, shrinking at Natasha’s scowl. “Like think about it. They’re both blonde and blue-eyed. They’re both SHIELD agents who’re obsessed with leather and motorcycles. They’re both hot and smart and witty as hell. I could go on—”
Tony whips his head around, staring in horror as that giant egghead aims his lasers in Barnes’ direction. Barnes who's moving too slowly for an assassin.
“I didn’t cheat. How could I—”
“Does it look or sound like I’m joking now either?”
“Oh yeah. Did you take the ring?”
And to give Steve more initiative to spend time away from here? Absolutely not.
“Great,” Clint groans as soon as the elevator doors shut behind the Fantastic Four. “Clean up duty.” He perks up, his shoulders taunt. “Dibs on not doing clean— Ack!”
“Not if I propose first.”
“I mean, she is part Kree—”
He shrugged his shoulders, casting Steve an odd look. “Maybe. One day. Besides, never say never. You guys have gotten back together before.”
He can't find it in himself to finish that thought without his stomach churning. Yet his traitorous brain won't stop imagining Steve kissing Barnes the way he kissed Tony, touching Barnes the way he touched Tony, telling Barnes—
, Steve replies, easy like breathing.
Tony falters, his lips parting as he stares at Steve with an unreadable expression.
Steve’s eyes narrow, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “You’re messing with me, aren’t you?”
