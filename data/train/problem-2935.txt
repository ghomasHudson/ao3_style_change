a Trump fan.”
Castiel didn’t think so, but he also didn’t think that Dean was ready to say it, no matter what he felt.
“Yeah.” Dean smiled tightly. “Have a drink with me, Cass?”
“So,” Castiel said. “Where’s this sandwich place?”
“Is this where you tell me to be patient again?”
Castiel blinks at the ceiling. Dean mutes the television.
“Right. Sorry.”
he married,” with heavy emphasis. She spoke wistfully of her “hag days” on the other side of the Golden Gate and got way too into helping Castiel dress up in drag that one Halloween. Meg joked to him that she was the reason he’d turned out gay.
“You too.” Dean swallowed. “Nice handshake.”
“Oh yeah?” There was a glint in Charlie’s eye that Dean didn’t like one bit. “Dean, if I didn’t know better, I’d say you’re coming off a little jealous.”
“Night, Dean.”
Dean wiped away his tears; the smoke in the skyphos had begun to trail off. Above the strip mall at the edge of the parking lot, the violet sky was streaked with copper and pink and gold.
“What is?”
“Okay, I guess. Since you asked nicely.”
“Well, I did say I could help you while I’m here.” Castiel gestured back to the chicken run. “I could gather the eggs. It can’t be too hard.”
That’s another part of being in a long-term relationship, he thinks with a wry smile. Putting the hard stuff off for tomorrow sometimes.
“Dean,” Sam said, softly now. He’d followed Dean into the kitchen and was leaning his hip into the island, his phone in hand. “Calm down, okay? Sorry, I forgot how serious you are about this whole social media thing.”
“I did.”
Dean looked down the aisle of the restaurant; Castiel had made it to the end and was hovering in the hotel lobby.
Sam cocked his head.
“You’re the man you are because of it. And I’m in love with that man.” Castiel leaned across the gap between the deck chairs and pressed a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips. “I’m so in love with that man.”
“Because you’re getting used to me.”
“These assbutts saying Warren should drop out so Bernie can ‘have’ her supporters. Like he’s entitled to them.” Castiel rolled his eyes in the office window’s reflection. “Snake emojis. Dumb takes. This is why I stopped writing my blog. It’s amazing how toxic intra-left fights can get.”
Dean beamed up at him. His eyes were such a beautiful green, like the leaves of a coast redwood with the sun falling through them. And those full, pink lips, always slightly parted, hanging on Castiel’s every word. And the light dusting of freckles across his cheeks, and how Castiel dreaded to wonder where else he had freckles, and the sorts of secret patterns they formed, waiting to be mapped—
Jack huffed and made his way down his hallway.
“I’m not trying to look sexy, Sam. Aprons are practical.” Dean patted his hands dry with the dishcloth on his shoulder. “Why would I give a crap about what some dude finds sexy, anyway?”
Jack hopped off his stool, placed his bowl and spoon in the dishwasher, and stretched in the rhombus of golden sun through the skylight. He tossed his blond hair out of his eyes.
a different building at this point,” Dean said. “Wait, was Donna still adding the insulation when you went to DC?”
“I was perfectly behaved last time.”
Dean spent the late afternoon and evening cleaning the house. He vacuumed the first and second floors but didn’t bother with the third, which was a single huge attic that the last three generations of Winchesters had relegated to storage space. He dusted the oak bookshelves, the mahogany tables and cabinets. He scrubbed the three bathrooms and the mudroom. He opened all the French doors to the deck to air out the house. It was still early enough in the year to not have to worry too much about bugs.
They ate for a while without speaking. Castiel’s voice was hesitant every time he asked Dean to pass him something. Dean wanted to slam the table and order Castiel to stop apologizing, but he knew that he’d only be venting his own frustration and not comforting him. After what felt like hours, Castiel’s mood finally turned on its own when the subject of Jack came up.
“Right,” Dean said skeptically.
“Still. Better?” Dean raised his eyebrows. “It’s better than before, right?”
Someone on the lawn below turned up “Livin’ on a Prayer,” and the room came back into focus in front of Dean. He stopped clenching his jaw.
“Yeah, Kelly.”
“Something wrong?”
Maybe Castiel didn’t have anything to worry about. Maybe Dean, with his prolific record of conquests and vast sexual experience, would take care of him, stop him from humiliating himself. Castiel hoped so, at least.
“Text me when you get there.”
“Huh?”
“Hang on.” One of Castiel’s shotgun-tentacles squeezed Dean’s waist. “Be patient.”
“Hmm.” Dean spread open Castiel’s shirt and kissed a line down his chest, his abs. “And now?”
“How do you want to do this, Dean?” Castiel looked up once he reached Dean’s boots. “Should we go to your room? I can fly us there.”
2 cloves minced garlic
“Don’t jinx me.”
Dean got the tent up just in time for the drizzle to start. He was setting up the tables and banners when he heard Charlie and Kevin laughing towards him across the grass.
“I don’t play basketball.”
Dean retrieved the wedge of parmesan from the refrigerator and a small-bore grater from the cabinet. He set them on one of the island’s chopping boards.
“Unless you want me to.”
“Bobby, what happened? Where are we?”
Dean scratched his neck. He looked around the library, then up at the bunker’s entrance.
Dean turned onto the path of red oaks and parked beside Sam. Sam and Castiel were waiting for him at the bottom of the brick path that led to the front door; Sam was holding a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread, Castiel a sheet pan of what Dean assumed was the lasagna he’d mentioned.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he says again.
Dean heard him stand up. He groaned, whiny and indulgent, with another stretch. Dean looked down at his lap.
“You’ve hardly eaten anything.”
“I actually meant I should get some shut-eye.” He rubbed up against Castiel’s side. “You don’t want me operating farm machinery while I’m sleep deprived, do you?”
Castiel returned his laugh, then detached from him and started changing into pajamas. As much as Dean had appreciated all of Castiel’s gifts—the chrome gelato maker, the custom apron emblazoned with a black 1967 Chevrolet Impala, the food-themed novelty socks and boxers and pajamas, the portable fridge for Baby’s trunk—he knew there was only one right answer.
“I don’t issue empty threats, Samuel. Pull your finger out.”
It was nearly five when they got back to campus, and Castiel was worried that the shared kitchen on the dormitory’s first floor would already be in use. Fortunately, it was deserted, and he and Dean spread out their haul from the farmer’s market across the counters.
Castiel finally turned to match Dean’s eyeline. “Yes.”
“I know it because it’s a cooking term.”
“Ready?” Dean flicked on the radio, but immediately switched it off when Ariana Grande poured out.
Castiel reached across the front seat and lay his hand on Dean’s thigh.
Castiel patted Dean’s arm. “Tell me.”
“Nah, only a couple minutes. Charlie gave me an hour for lunch, so we can take our time. Your order’s my first one when I get back, anyway.”
Castiel looked up. “You’re not alone. I’m here.”
“That’d be perfect. Anna—my sister—should be driving back to Seattle Sunday morning. That’ll give me a few hours to straighten up the house before you arrive.”
“Hi,” Jack said, his voice muffled by Castiel’s embrace. “Ow, Dad.”
“Yes?”
“Did you—” Dean handed the phone back to him. “I mean, you seemed kind of upset about that. You said you’d tell me why when you got back.”
“It’s about eight inches long, stiff, and rainbow-colored,” Sam said.
“You’ve got nothing to be sorry for,” Castiel said. His voice came out lower and sexier than ever, and Dean blushed at his bowl of cereal. Good thing he was facing the counter instead of the kitchen table.
“Hungry?” the man says again, and Dean nods. “Let’s go get something to eat.”
Dean jerked the tie; Castiel rocked forward and back with a self-satisfied grin on his face.
there’s more to life.”
“Yup, definitely saw those guys. The bears, I mean.” Dean opened the window to the cool evening air and tumbled into bed. “That doesn’t explain it, though. I mean, you’ve always grabbed my attention.”
“I love you.” He paused dramatically. “Because you’ll stand in front of a crowd and tell them all the reasons you love me.”
“Thank you, Sam.”
Dean let go of the broom with a clatter and raced down the stairs. At the threshold, he dove into Castiel’s arms, and Castiel staggered back with the force of it.
“Don’t know. Clean up? Work up to round two? Fly somewhere on your shiny new wings? I guess we can’t do all three.”
Castiel was silent. When Dean looked over at him, he was shaking his head, his eyes shut.
Dean shrugged. “I guess. Maybe I’m just used to it by now.”
Dean picked up his spoon, offering Castiel a small smile. For some reason, he couldn’t get the way the prince had looked at him out of his mind.
"I will."
“Do all three of us really need to be here?” Charlie said, once the sun had peeked out tentatively from the clouds and people were trickling onto the boulevard.
“Red, gold, and green,” Castiel murmured.
“Thanks, Kevin.” Dean hung the keys on their hook. “I appreciate it.”
“Beats me.” An irreverent grin played on Dean’s lips, and he opened his eyes. “Just tell me what to do, Cass. I’ll do whatever you want. You want me to book an appointment with one of the shrinks at the counseling center? I’ll do it.”
“In case you’re wondering, you’re just as good-looking upside down,” Castiel said.
“I’m not 100% sure yet. It depends on whether the general insurance team can finish before then or if they need more time.”
“Oh.” Castiel rubbed his nose. “I did say that, didn’t I?”
“She’s mimicking a bird. It’s not French. There’s no translation.”
Castiel made a contemplative noise, one which suggested that he wanted Dean to say more. For a while, Dean stared at the moonlight on the ceiling. He tried to picture all the constellations there, hung by a Castiel freshly back from astronomy camp. He thought about a teenage Castiel smoking behind the science building and being serenaded by a dirty blond kid who didn’t want to label himself. He thought about Kelly where he was now and about Jack loping down the stairs of her house in his salmon shirt and white chinos. He thought about Castiel in the same pink and white, tears in his eyes, telling Dean that he was falling for him.
Castiel stopped at the vista overlooking the cove and leaned his elbows into the stained-walnut banister. Above their heads, the staircase’s mammoth crystal chandelier glittered asymmetrically like the stars of the universe. It was too dark outside for them to see anything in the windows other than their own reflection, and Dean realized how small he and Castiel looked right now, pressed together in the house’s vastness.
Dean feels a flash of irritation. He knows Castiel doesn’t mean to be terse, to reject intimacy. It’s just his demeanor to ask for clarification when he’s not sure of something and to use as few words as possible to do so. It’s not his fault that for Dean, just asking to be touched is a fathomless display of vulnerability.
“That’s the point, idiot,” Dean whispered, kissing Castiel’s earlobe by way of apology. “Now call me your righteous man and any other silly pet names you’ve got stored up.”
Their morning was productive, notwithstanding a false start when Sam overzealously mulched a row of berries with what looked like four inches of pine needles. He found his footing quickly, though. Dean praised him judiciously, teased him mercilessly, and at times it felt like they were back in the years before he’d gone off to Stanford.
“‘You guess?’” the Empty snapped. “How else would you be here? By the void, I thought this angel was dense, but you’re an entirely new level of stupid I didn’t know existed.”
“The point isn’t our orientation,” Castiel said finally. “The point is that we wanted to be open about what’s going on. Dean and I, we’ve had our share of misunderstandings—”
“Come here,” Dean insisted.
“Yeah, well.” Castiel shrugged. “I’ve already told you a lot about my father. And Jack.”
“It was the same with the loan. I didn’t think anything of it. For something as significant to me as your livelihood, it just didn’t enter my mind to second-guess my course of action.”
“Put an extra spoonful in that one,” Dean said. He peered into the refrigerator to check the weight of the turkey. “Cass likes his coffee strong.”
“Poor baby,” Dean said, finishing off his drink.
Now it was the man’s turn to laugh. He plopped onto the stool to Dean’s left and leered at him.
They divided up the tasks: Castiel cooked the rice and sliced the tofu while Dean plated the mizuna and kimchi. For not having thumbs, he held a serving spoon well enough.
“Skyline Drive,” Dean said. “Yeah, I’m planning to take Cass there in the fall. I think he’ll love the colors.”
Dean’s breath stalled. He sat forward on the couch cushion. Crowley glared at him and jumped off his lap.
Castiel fluttered his lips and made his way to the tripod. He started counting down.
The next six hours passed in a blur. As usual, everything took longer than expected, with the turkey presenting as the standout slowpoke. When 3:30 rolled around and it was still going, Dean started pacing.
“Cass.” She stood on her tiptoes to hug him. “Hi.”
“We’ll work on that.” Dean hovered his ass over Castiel’s cock, then leaned down for a gentle kiss and a brush of their noses. “I’m really looking forward to working on that.”
“Hmm?”
“It’s supposed to be Thai basil, but Food Land only had regular basil,” Castiel said sheepishly.
The last day of June was a Sunday, and Sam brought up Eileen over dinner.
“Oh, right.” Castiel released the pose, coming up to a neutral standing position. “How was work?”
“Guess Yuri’s home,” Castiel said. “He usually goes to the comedy club on Friday night to watch the headliners.”
“Because.”
“Hmm,” Dean said.
🌽🍅🥦🌶🥔🍆🥕🥬🥒🍓🥑
“Oh, God. I can’t look.”
Dean shook his head.
“Hmm,” Castiel muttered. “Well, I suppose I could consider forgiving you.”
Dean leaned in over their makeshift table, and Castiel kissed him after only a moment of acting put out.
“If you don’t talk, I suppose you can’t tell me your name.” Castiel paused. “Do you have a name?”
Dean plugged in his phone on his desk. “Jack’s fine. Everyone else is gone, though. Looks like Chuck got them all while we were in the Empty.”
. “You ever been up that thing?”
“You feel like reading me something?”
It was too warm for a fire, so Dean immediately proceeded to the staircase. His shower beckoned.
“Oh well.” Dean shrugged. “Worth a shot.”
“Yeah.”
“Just a cup of water.” Castiel flipped Dean’s wallet shut with the back of his hand. “And I’ll get this.”
“You know how you said you could get used to me cooking for you?” Dean sat back with his coffee cup. “I could get used to this. You taking me out to eat.”
“No, Meg. Not on the mouth.”
“I knew you’d like it. All the squires knew about your sweet tooth. If any of us wanted to gain your favor, we’d present you with a gift of honey sticks.”
8 ounces fresh morel mushrooms
“It’s nice seeing them together,” she said. “He’s always different when Cass is here.”
“You have to ask that?”
The skin above one of Dean’s eyes quirked up.
“That’s nice of her. So, where are we going?”
Dean’s eyes grew huge. The green of his irises flashed with unearthly light.
He marched into the dining room and tore through to the front end. Charlie was tabulating something at one of the registers.
“Yeah!”
Dean added a confident nod to punctuate his statement before grabbing his towel and heading for the shower.
Some unreliability in
“Yeah, Dean—”
They spent most of their time trading stories about old friends, travel destinations, embarrassing situations—the sorts of things, Dean clarified to Castiel, that people talked about on a second date. Upon finishing two glasses of wine, he even confessed to finding it sexy when Castiel spoke French.
Nevertheless, that night, when his phone buzzed with Castiel’s text, Dean replied instantly.
He waved and closed the door, and Dean made his way through the darkness to his bathroom. He showered, brushed his teeth, and crawled under the covers, feeling the tingling of his skin where Castiel had gripped his shoulder until he finally drifted off to sleep.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean said again, through gritted teeth. “How much is left?”
Dean stared down at the sunset in his glass as a pregnant silence settled between them. Eventually, they were interrupted by the squeaking of the screen door.
Dessert was homemade strawberry ice cream with the few fresh strawberries left from last week’s surplus cut on top. Castiel made noises that sounded downright filthy as he licked his spoon after each bite.
“You sure?” Dean kissed Crowley’s head.
Dean grinned. “Yeah, our great-granddad built this greenhouse in the twenties. Part of the process of remodeling and adding to the original building.”
“Alright, put that away. You want French toast for breakfast? I made my orange huckleberry bread yesterday.”
Dean nudged Castiel’s side. “Seems to me like you don’t love me enough.”
Dean snorted. “So you’ll take me down with you? Thanks a lot.”
“Okay,” Dean said, as he washed his hands. “First thing, preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. After you’ve done that, take your kitchen scissors and snip off the radish tops, then the little white stringy parts at the bottom. Put the tops aside for later. When your radishes are ready, rinse them well and let them dry on a kitchen towel.”
He was pretending; that was obvious. Focusing on the mission, the case, until they’d seen it through to the end. Once, before he knew him as well as he did now, Castiel would’ve been crestfallen at Dean’s swift dismissal of the moment Castiel considered his perfect happiness. Now, because he knew Dean felt the same way, because he knew that that was
“There’s plenty of space.” Castiel kissed his cheek and nudged him down the stairs. “Let’s fill all of it.”
“You and Eliot could get together and give Max and Stacy a taste of their own medicine.”
“Yeah.”
“I’m not trying to get rid of you, but…I thought you had to get back to work?”
Right after that, there’d been a warm wind through the Impala’s open windows. The incongruous rumble of a thunderclap in the clear night. A spectral, ice-blue light directly above. Finally, a high-pitched whine that grew in volume as Dean floored the accelerator. He’d made some crack about aliens to a wild-eyed Bobby. After all, every hunter knew they weren’t real.
“You mean that whole
“Well, speaking of drawing, I should give you your birthday present now.” Jack walked to the couch and unzipped his backpack.
“No, it’s fine.” He stroked the bag’s side. “Were you in the military, Dean?”
“Yeah. It’s absurd, of course. I take this trip every year; everyone knows about it way in advance.”
Dean wavered. He looked at the canteen and licked his lips.
“I like the wine,” Dean said. Had he already said that? He couldn’t remember now.
“I’m sorry I keep reminding you of the ways we’re different,” Castiel said, once they separated. “I’m not doing it on purpose.”
“Yeah, that’s right.” Castiel paused in the kitchen doorway. “30 to 40 minutes? Perfect.”
Castiel realized that in his ecstasy, he’d neglected Dean’s cock and ass. He immediately returned to his duties, caressing Dean’s branded cheek apologetically.
“Okay.” Castiel tilts his head. “How funny that you led us here. This is where I’m staying.”
“You know, I’m wondering.”
“Can we go to your room?” Dean says. “I’m exhausted.”
Castiel flapped his arms listlessly. As if by magnetism, he drifted towards Dean in the stillness.
Dean chuckled and stuck the earbud into his ear.
It sounded strange coming from Dean’s mouth.
The night before Valentine’s Day, a little more than three weeks later, Dean was sitting on his and Castiel’s bed in their hotel room in Charleston, watching the news. They were on the return leg of their cross-country trip and due to arrive back in Winchester on Sunday, and Dean was quite honestly ready to get to work again. A three-week vacation was too long for him. Or, maybe he just wasn’t used to getting time off. That was Castiel’s position: he was adamant that Dean deserved more leisure time and that he’d get used to it once all the renovations to the farm were completed. Dean joked that Castiel just wanted him to himself as much as possible. Castiel didn’t bother denying that.
They sit at the booth closest to the bathrooms. Dean orders the steak, bacon, and over-easy eggs, short stack of chocolate chip pancakes, and strawberry milkshake. Castiel orders a black coffee. The jukebox in the corner’s playing “Come Go with Me,” and the waitress sways her shoulders to it as she takes their menus back behind the counter.
“What?”
“Thank you for being inclusive,” Castiel said.
“That’s infatuation, not love. You’ve always been this way. Any charity case with a sad story and a pretty smile turns your head. Too much heart was always your problem.”
“I can’t believe this.”
“You’re welcome, baby.” Dean nosed up from his pillow for a sleepy kiss. “I fucking love when you call me sweetheart.”
Castiel laughed as he climbed up. He held the mint green tube over Dean’s ass, pried Dean’s hands away from his knees, draped his legs over his shoulders. Dean guided him to his hole, and Castiel drove home.
Dean stood and began clearing the table. “Whatever. Maybe this dude will bring in some of his followers who like food pictures.”
“No.” Maybe it was the guy’s English accent, but Dean felt like there was a subtle dig somewhere in there. “I’m not a hobby farmer. I run a full-time operation.”
“No, but I didn’t always know you as well as I do now. And if it wouldn’t have changed anything, why does it matter that I didn’t tell you sooner?”
“I know. And I will.”
“Will you tell me now?” Castiel said, loud enough for his voice to carry to the kitchen.
“Tell me.”
“For hiding Jack from you.”
“Oh, please. He’d probably fumble it.” Rowena looked around. “Where’s Castiel?”
“Yes, he’s my boyfriend.”
“And?”
Dean nodded his assent into Castiel’s shoulder. “Yeah, that sounds awesome. Hey, come with me. I want to show you something.”
The doorbell rang as soon as Castiel finished sending the video to himself, and he went to answer it while Dean cleaned up the island. They took their curry and noodles and spring rolls to the living room. Last night, during one of the conversations they’d had while watching nature documentaries, Castiel had admitted to never having seen
“Man, I just love being right.”
¼ cup chopped dill
“Ugh.” Castiel shuffled to the coffeemaker. “No teasing until I’ve had my first cup.”
“Maybe we will, then. But we’ll trade off meal duty. It shouldn’t all be on you and Cass.”
4 garlic cloves
Hannah stared at him. “What?”
“He must be busy.” Dean wouldn’t look at him. “Is this everything?”
“What’s the matter?”
“What do I do after you fall asleep, then?”
He worked for hours, and none of it was very good.
“Dean?” Castiel said.
Castiel blinked. The first verse of “I Want to Know What Love Is” was playing, and Dean hummed along to it while waiting for Castiel's answer.
Dean led the way down one of the piers. He nodded at the green-hulled, wooden-rigged sailboat at the end.
“I did not,” Castiel protested. “I kept my hands to myself. I was a perfect gentleman.”
“Tact isn’t your strong point.”
Castiel laughed. He plucked the cocktail shaker from the crook of Dean’s elbow.
Dean shivered. His head was nodding vaguely, involuntarily, with how hard his heart was beating, struggling to send fresh blood to his overwhelmed brain.
“Dean, that was…you were unbelievable.”
They kissed again, and Castiel slapped Dean’s rear, pushing him towards the staircase. Halfway down, Dean yelled into the living room to see if Sam was hungry for dinner yet, so he didn’t notice that Castiel had lingered behind on the landing until he was almost to the kitchen.
“Uh-huh. Not that that really proves anything. Besides, I wasn’t referring to Meg.”
“You want to ride back with us, baby boy?” Castiel said.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I can’t even look out the window without you taking me to English class.”
“Uh.” Dean’s eyes darted back and forth as he tried to come up with a lie. “I think I ate some bad bar food.”
“What?”
“Yes,” Dean said. He took in a sharp breath, feeling the prickle of gooseflesh on his neck and shoulders and arms. “You can, uh, examine me. As long as you tell me what you’re doing before you do it. And stop if I tell you no.”
Castiel glanced up at Dean. Dean shrugged.
“Mine,” Dean growled, right as the first hot jet of come splashed onto Castiel’s eyelid. “My slut.”
“Not saying I will. I haven’t made up my mind yet.”
“As if I’d forget.” Sam refilled his coffee and sat on one of the island’s chairs. “How’s the farm doing, anyway?”
He was such a glutton and a rube. He had no idea what Castiel saw in him.
“I don’t need lessons on normal behavior from you,” Rafe shot back, without turning to him. “And you have to admit, it’s a funny coincidence. Being strictly into women until our brother came along.”
“Well.” Dean shrugged. “I love Cass.”
“When you told me about how you found him.” Castiel shook his head. “I’m so sorry I dredged up that memory for you again, Dean.”
“Really?” Dean lowered himself to the wooden bench and rested his head against the railing. The night breeze licked the sweat from his nape and tickled his hair.
“You always do what you put your mind to. You’re amazing.” Castiel turned to him. “You know, I’m stashing all the loan money you’re paying back in a side account. I’m calling it our vacation account. No, I don’t want to hear any complaints. You don’t get to tell me how to spend my money.”
Dean walked to the hallway, closing the door behind him softly. He made his way to the stairs like he did every morning. Today, though, he’d slept in long enough for the horizon to be visible from the Palladian window, and he stopped at the overlook to gauge the weather. There was still some wind and drizzle, but the tempest had calmed since last night. Maybe that had been its crescendo; maybe tomorrow would be dry, even sunny.
Castiel pulled open the bag of tortilla chips in his lap and handed it to Dean. “Try it. I’ll get you a glass of water.”
“Um…no, actually. Honestly, I should. I don’t have the excuse of being a first-year associate running on no sleep anymore.”
“I said that I don’t think you’re short-staffed. I think you planned all this out to spy on me. I’m sick of you, and Kevin, and Jo, and even Sam—”
“Wouldn’t miss it, Dean-O.” Gabe winked.
“Man.” She fluttered her lips. “You two are so dramatic.”
Dean took a deep breath and sat back on the sofa, handing the letter to Castiel.
“Yeah.” Dean stroked his back. “I’ll tell you everything we talked about, don’t worry.”
“Okay,” he said. “You really want that?”
“I see. I suppose that’s not surprising.”
“Yeah, the one with the angel fountain out front.” Castiel smoothed the sleeves of his blazer. “Dean….”
2 small bunches of radishes, including tops*
“Is it a living wage?”
“Your body is tensing. Drawing inward. Something’s changed.”
“Your head’s not spinning, is it? No nausea or anything?”
Castiel smiled. “Because of the huge, greasy portions?”
“There you are.” Castiel furrowed his brow. “What took you so long?”
Dean smiled. He patted Castiel’s arm to get him to turn around to the hallway.
Dean perused the refrigerator for half and half or, failing that, milk. His search ended with a sigh.
—but it came out an observation, a declaration. A claim. Castiel stared at him, his bottom lip caught under his teeth and his hand still gripping Dean’s shoulder tight enough to leave a mark. The ocean of stars above their heads swam in his eyes.
“Forty minutes,” Dean said, to the question on Sam’s face. “There’s some chips and salsa on the coffee table if you’re hungry.”
“I don’t blame her. It’s an eight-hour drive.”
“Hmm. Okay, show me what we’re looking for.”
“I thought you said you didn’t have housemates?”
“Welcome home, son. I’m sorry I’ve been so busy. I think I saw your car get here last night.”
Dean’s hands moved again. He ran them into Castiel’s hair, tugging gently as he went and grabbing fresh handfuls of it whenever it slipped through his fingers. He reached the tips and started over again. Castiel rolled his neck and hung his head, preening for him.
“Careful,” Castiel said, as Dean pushed himself up by his forearms. A second tentacle, about the width of a shotgun barrel and at least six feet long, rose up from Castiel’s side and curved around Dean’s waist to support his lower back. The tentacle that had been at his wrist made its way to his left shoulder, resting there. Almost like it was trying to comfort him.
“Wait. You knew?”
She was already heading for the tray return before Castiel could respond, though he knew it was likely pointless now anyway. Of course, Dean scowled when Meg showed up in their doorway a few minutes later, and he grumbled to Castiel on the walk to the parking lot a few minutes after that.
As Castiel had expected, Dean was thrilled about the pumpkin. He picked it up and tossed it back and forth in his hands while rambling about carving jack-o'-lanterns with Sam and corn mazes outside Topeka. He suggested a road trip to Manchester for leaf peeping and a return to the Burlington farmer’s market for fall produce, and Castiel said yes to all of it.
“Nah.” Dean took a long swig of his beer. “Me and Lisa, we’re kind of…taking a break.”
“That’s bacon for me. Find me a plant that tastes the same, and I just might join you and Sam on the dark side.”
Dean pulled his mouth free and took in as deep a breath as he could manage. “I’m trying.”
Dean threw open the narrow door to the belvedere, letting in the sun and wind. He clambered back down, wiped the dust from the telescope with the thin cloth that covered its top half, and lifted it with both hands. It wasn’t as heavy as he remembered. Then again, he wasn’t 13 anymore.
Dean felt the syllable more than heard it, a rumble inside his angel’s chest. He nodded.
“Yeah.” Dean scratched his cheek. “Um, I was actually thinking of taking the day off tomorrow. Could show you around the farm. Then we could maybe go into town. Grab lunch or something.”
“Yeah, thanks, Sammy.” Dean finally looked up at him. “You came through.”
Castiel chuckled. He glanced at Dean.
“Really?”
He felt filthy from spending the night in the wilderness, but a shower would have to wait. He’d promised his guest coffee and breakfast, and he was going to deliver.
“Jack’s already here? I didn’t see his car in front.”
, partners? I got a vibe from Donna.”
Castiel shook his head. “It’s okay, Dean.”
Dean swiveled in his seat to watch Castiel ascend the stairs, turning back when he heard the glug and fizz of the champagne bottle.
“Huh. Maybe you just have a good moisturizer routine, then.”
“I’m just, um, showing you how much that moisturizer you gave me is helping.” Dean rubbed both of his hands over Castiel’s right one. “See? Soft as a baby’s butt.”
“Ah. Right, of course. Well, don’t mind me.”
“Hell yes. Hey, I wonder—” Sam fished his phone out of his slacks. “Let’s see how many likes your post’s gotten.”
“Like Cass?” Benny says. He smiles, baring his teeth just a fraction of an inch. He knows Castiel can see him in the dark.
“I—” Castiel’s tentacles flushed a shy pink. “I looked up human mating on your internet while we were talking just now. My attention can be divided among multiple activities.”
Dean raised his eyebrows; that hardly narrowed it down. As far as he could tell, the majority of the swim team seemed pretty fruity. Although, he was sure the hockey team had them beat in that department. Something about the way they always talked about the size of each other’s thighs and butts and how jeans never fit them right.
“We passed each other at the entrance when I got back from my run.” Castiel slathered a slice of toast with peanut butter and immediately crunched into it. “Mmm.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, after a beat. “Yeah, I’ll ask him.”
“Well, he wasn’t meeting chicks later.” Dean thrust his hands under the water once Castiel finished. “It takes at least a day to get garlic out of your fingers.”
Castiel looks up from his coffee and smiles. Dean’s come back to his order. Steak, bacon, and over-easy eggs; short stack of chocolate chip pancakes; strawberry milkshake. They’re sitting in the booth closest to the bathrooms. It’s held up well. The jukebox in the corner’s playing Tom Waits.
Next, he searched for spectral phenomena. Ghosts, poltergeists, wisps, orbs, shades, revenants. He’d seen the creature outside a graveyard, so some connection to the dead—or the undead—seemed logical. But none of the images or descriptions seemed to line up with what Castiel had seen.
*The amount of sugar is mostly down to personal preference. I usually use between ½ to ¾ of a cup for a batch this size—aiming for the lower end of that range if Sam is with me, since he complains about refined sugars. Also, keep in mind that you’ll be adding powdered sugar at the end, which will sweeten it further.
Castiel fixed Jack with his gaze for a few more seconds before relaxing back into Dean. Dean patted Jack’s back and chuckled.
“Yes.” Castiel started transferring the bag of frozen foods to the freezer. “Anyway, we’re in a small town in Idaho. I don’t think they have ‘weird natural versions’ of Lucky Charms at the grocery store.”
“Dean, you’re not doing this because—”
“Well, here’s a song for you. This is ‘Feel Like Makin’ Love.’”
“It’s not your fault, Dean. It’s Dad’s. You’re the only reason I’ve been able to do as much with my life as I have.” Sam leveled his eyes to John and Mary’s wedding portrait; his lip twitched. “Cass, how about you?”
, Dean wrote back.
“I’ve always taken him for granted. I never liked telling him how—how I felt. That’s what that prayer was about. The one he mentioned to you earlier.”
“Well, you know me that well, at least.”
“Yeah?”
“Assuming I
“How’d you, uh—” Jack hesitated. “How’d you meet my dad?”
Dean patted his arm reassuringly.
“Mhm.”
“What?”
Neither of them talked or moved for the better part of a minute. Plaintive music soared from the television.
“I’ll try to restrain myself, then.” He started down one of the rows of crops, and Dean followed him. “Are these all things for the farm? I guess they must be.”
“They find a way. They’re relentless.” Cain put his hands on his hips and gazed up at the sky. “You almost admire their tenacity.”
“I love you,” Castiel says, after a while. “You know that.”
“I like it. It sounds more meditative than mindless.”
“I don’t know. Seems like he gets away with everything. Doubt they’ll nail him.” Dean patted Castiel’s thigh. “I’m going to jump in the shower, angel.”
“I’m not a doctor, Dean. I’ve got years before that.”
Castiel stopped midway through pulling up his T-shirt, his back to Dean.
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup + 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
“Whoa, hang on.” Dean played with the handle of his coffee cup. “I never said I’m gay.”
“Told you I’d make it good for you.” Dean winked.
“I don’t know,” he said.
“No idea what this could be,” Dean muttered. He pulled at the flaps, revealing a sleek black rectangle swaddled in air cushions.
Castiel tilted his head. “Sammy?”
Abruptly, Castiel stood and began repacking the first aid kit.
“Fuck you, Sammy.”
“‘Just don’t do anything you can’t take back.’”
“We’re desperate,” Ellen said. “Blue-Eyes is punishing us because our offerings stopped. Our crops have failed; our stream has dried up. What do we have left?”
Dean clenched his jaw. The hand holding his phone trembled, and he nearly dropped it.
“I know I crossed a line.” Castiel finally glanced up at him, his eyes rimmed in damp red. “If it’s possible, I hope we can just go back to the way things were before.”
“I don’t think so.” An angel blade falls into Jofiel’s palm. “I like it here.”
“Yeah. Did you…go out with a lot of guys in high school?”
“I know.” Castiel tilted his head apologetically. “Can I ask
They walked, Castiel leading the way this time, out into the bright afternoon.
Dean left the leaves to steep. He walked to the linen closet underneath the staircase and loaded up his arms, then headed up the stairs to his old room.
Dean threw his socks into the hamper. “You really didn’t peek?”
Dean wiggles down into the dirt, punches his jacket to fluff it up.
“That’s an open question.” Castiel held the door for him. “Wow, catch that sun.”
"I can do it."
“We usually eat there, in the park. There’s a nice view of the sunset and Little Providence. Well, the Providence Yacht Club’s in the way, but it adds to the milieu.”
Dean’s eyes widened. This was too good to be true.
With so little left to pick, Dean had told the workers not to show up until 6:30 today, an hour later than usual. That was an unintended mercy. Not only had he had a restless night’s sleep, but his head still hurt from too much whiskey. He was glad for that. He deserved it for how he’d acted.
Dean snorted. “That easy, huh?”
“Can you put this in your bathroom?” Castiel handed him the toiletries.
“You wouldn’t understand. You’ve always been stereotypically masculine. People haven’t been making fun of you for being less of a man since before you knew what sexual orientation even was.”
“Oh, I don’t mind.” Castiel gazed down the length of Dean’s body again, slower this time. “You’re not exactly a chore to look at. Nice
Castiel slapped Dean’s other cheek, using enough force to leave a mark this time. Dean moaned again, and Castiel felt a light drizzle of precome on his collarbone from Dean’s heavy cock.
“Oh, me now.” Sam pored over his pile. “Hmm, which one?”
“Okay.” He filled his glass again. “Well…I should only be half an hour or so.”
“Goodnight, Father,” Castiel said. “Happy Birthday.”
“In case you want to make good on your offer to help me throw bales of hay around.”
“I just saw someone I knew on the way there. Got sidetracked while talking.”
“Good morning.”
“Dean?”
Many long-running television series have final episodes that disappoint, divide, and even offend fans. A casual perusal through media in recent decades reveals it as a cliché at this point, with certain of them transcending their fandoms and becoming broader pop cultural shorthand, usually in the negative—think
“Do you want Jonathan and me to come stay with you for a few days? Or just me, even?”
Charlie shook her head. She was wheezing with laughter.
“It’s from the fifties. People weren’t as sensitive then. Wait, what am I saying? No one knows you exist, so they’d be just as insensitive now. Try not to hold it against us. Let’s just watch something else.”
“Then…what?”
Dean crossed his legs. He could hear Castiel’s bass rumbling somewhere within the house, though he couldn’t make out most of the words.
“You said we’d talk today.”
“For sure. Man, I can’t believe you guys have your own beach and pier and everything. I’ll be like a kid in a candy store. Actually—” Dean checked his watch. “Yeah, speaking of stores, we should probably head back to Food Land. My hour’s almost up.”
“No, I didn’t mean it like that.” Jack hugged him again. “I was just kidding. I’ll try to learn some words before we go. Remember some of the words Anna taught me. Maybe we can practice together.”
“And I don’t know why, but I worry about you. That something could happen to you while I’m gone all day.” Dean rubbed his hand over the lower half of his face, blinked away the embarrassing pricking in his eyes. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“No, no. Not at all. You’ve just been dropping hints about going to a restaurant for weeks now.”
“I hope you’re treating him well,” Yuri continued, his voice lower now. “His last boyfriend was a jerk who only cared about his money.”
“I’m sure Dean’s marvelous cooking had more to do with it.”
“Well, everything worked out.” Dean stretched his arms to the ceiling. “Damn, I can go directly from bed to the shower today. This is the life.”
“Unhand me,” Castiel growled, his voice going even lower than normal. “Have you forgotten yourself?”
Dean beamed at the fact of a kitchen with multiple refrigerators. Castiel, however, already looked ready to quit the situation.
They were scaling a pile of boulders, and the creature grunted in response.
“Well, things like that don’t define us. I’m most of the way through my PhD and we still found each other.”
“How’s Sam doing?”
Add the oil and onions to a Dutch oven. Heat on medium heat for about 10 minutes, until onions start to turn translucent. Mix in the leeks and cook for another 5 minutes, then mix in the garlic, bay leaves, paprika, and smoked paprika. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and have lost most of their moisture. If any of the vegetables start to stick to the bottom, lower the heat to medium low.
"You will, don’t worry. I mean, I'm always down there, so feel free to come with me whenever you have some time."
“Three. No, four.”
“You’re way better than Dad. It’s like he tries to be terrible or something.”
“I’ve always thought it’s romantic.”
“Uh, well….” Sam fidgeted. “I wanted to hang out, that’s all.”
“I usually try not to think about it when I get a day off. When you study the same thing for six years, you end up needing that mental space.” He chewed thoughtfully. “I don’t mean to sound so negative. It’s a project that studies comparative refugee and asylum regimes over time, so it’s like my days off aren’t even days off. Serves me right for making ‘attending pro-immigrant protests’ what I do for fun. That was the third thing you said people talk about on their first dates, right?”
“Well, up to you.” Dean leaned down into the stretch and grimaced. “You’ve got your shit to take care of, so do I. We’ll make it work.”
Castiel nodded, then left for the bathroom. Dean hadn’t been lying. He was almost looking forward to seeing Meg’s smug face. After the day he’d had with Castiel yesterday, he definitely felt like he’d gotten one over on her. Maybe he’d drop a few hints about it and keep her off balance.
“It’s the ‘rusty nail.’” Dean said proudly. “The one you wouldn’t stop complaining about every single time I had to come in here for something in the last two months.”
He’d really have to find a way to get Dean into something that fit him better. Something that showed off the swell of his calves and the precise angle of his bowlegs. Not to mention his…other features. A boy who spent all day on his feet, pushing a heavy cart from aisle to aisle, was bound to have a toned, shapely rear. One that just begged to be—
“Everything, huh?”
“Oh, right. It’s really good the next day. Better, even. So don’t be afraid of making a lot, because you’ll love the leftovers.”
“Alright.” Dean grabbed the nut bowl out of Sam’s hands. “But don’t leave me alone with him for too long.”
“And that isn’t how I think about you. Not even close. I look up to you, Dean. So much. I mean, you spent years of your life picking berries so I could stay in school. I can’t describe how much that means to me.”
“You look good too,” Castiel interjected.
“I’m sure he thinks so. He’s doing a master’s in public health at GW. He probably should just stick to that.” Castiel started ascending the staircase.
“I just don’t want to label it. I’m having a good time. Whatever this is, I’m having a good time.”
“A taboo?”
“‘To return home at eventide with gratitude,’” Castiel said, ignoring him. “‘And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.’”
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean and sniffed. After a few seconds, he nosed up to press a kiss to Dean’s lips.
Dean peered at him. After a few seconds, Castiel averted his eyes.
“Cass, no. I can’t accept that. It’s too much.”
Castiel wiped his eyes along Dean’s wrist; Dean leaned forward to press a gentle kiss to his lips. When he relaxed back into the couch’s corner, he pulled Castiel with him. They lay chest to chest, and Dean soothed Castiel’s back with both hands.
“Wilderness, yeah. There’s the main town, the two villages on the southern and northern tips, a few cranberry bogs. Houses along the ring road and the north-south road. Most of the rest is trees.”
“And they say chivalry’s dead.”
“Not just tentacles. They’re there, though. To the extent that my true form can be said to have physical features and not just comprise an intent, anyway.”
“He doesn’t beat around the bush, does he?”
“So, if that’s what he wants—hypothetically, I mean—I’m thinking I’ll decorate our room, light a few candles, put on some good music, get some flowers…what else?”
“Raphael!”
“Honestly, I was glad you took the lead there. I had no idea how to pronounce any of that.”
“No, Maine doesn’t have any cases yet. But it’s only a matter of time.” Castiel looked at his phone. “I wonder if our venue will be okay. Who knows if this’ll still be an issue in June.”
“Me three,” Rowena said airily, appearing at the bar with a white cube that was nearly the size of her torso. “May I put this down somewhere?”
Castiel held the mead up to the candlelight, peering at it in wonder. Dean grinned.
“Typical,” Castiel sighed. “Wait until she finds out I’m more into cocks than hens.”
🌽🍅🥦🌶🥔🍆🥕🥬🥒🍓🥑
“Yeah, I was just about to leave.” Yuri beamed. “Can I test some of what I’ve got for next week while I have you here?”
As Dean made his way down the list, his anticipation chilled into dread. It was definitely looking like C. Novak had a wife after all. Seemed like she was returning home from a long business trip or something. Champagne and roses and a sweet-smelling bath. A picture-perfect reunion.
Later that night, as Dean was working on the recipe blog post in his office, Castiel came up behind him and kissed the crown of his head.
“I think you have ghost sickness,” Cas said.
A few nights later, Cas found Dean sitting at the kitchen island at around eleven, eating leftover pie. Cas walked past him to the freezer and pulled out a small container of ice cream. He dished himself up a small bowl and caught Dean’s eye as he licked the spoon clean. After replacing the container in the freezer, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the small packet, deliberately sprinkling it on his dessert.
He didn’t know who leaned forward first, but it just kind of happened. Like gravity. They were standing there, then they were standing closer together. Then, he blinked, and they were nose to nose. Cas’ breath fanned over Dean’s face, once, twice, then they kissed.
“My own brother!” he rasped out, glaring.
Everyone came to look. One of the deer stepped over to the other one and sniffed its nose.
“I did not say that!” Cas started. “I said she’s interested in Dean!”
Cas was
Guy was the last to leave, and he turned to Mary at the door. “Enjoy your rum,” he said, then left, leaving her alone.
But he was also not willing to let Dean get away with his actions in the movie room, and especially with the lasagna. Actions had consequences. So he had decided, not long after that event, to get a little bit of petty revenge, and see if he could make Dean as uncomfortable as he had been. Just for a little while.
“You don’t seem fine, Dean. Is there anything I can do?”
This guy really was perceptive. Dean shook his head. “No,” he said. “My interests lie… elsewhere.” He imagined Cas hearing this conversation and felt his face heat up. He was so distracted that he didn’t even notice Guy sidle closer.
During dinner, he suggested they watch a movie. While Jack and Sam made popcorn and Cas finished up the dishes, Dean headed to the Dean Cave, ostensibly to set up the movie. Once there, he grabbed the jar out from where he’d hidden it, and pulled the old quilt off the back of the couch. Quickly, in case the others arrived, he spread some of the herb from the jar on the quilt, before closing the jar and hiding it away again. Then, he rubbed the leaves into the blanket the best he could, and then refolded it so the angel-nip was on the inside, and replaced it on the arm of the couch.
His eyes followed Castiel’s hands as they worked loose the buckle of his pants. Castiel let them fall, and pushed his boots off with his toes before stepping out of the whole works quickly, eager to get his hands back on Dean.
They both burst out laughing.
Dean made a sound sort of halfway between a laugh and a cough. “So like, if it was just us hanging out and I gave it to you, it wouldn’t be so bad?”
The cloth moved lower, over the bottom of his ribs, his belly, his navel, lower, catching a little on the bit of hair that led into his underwear. Which was getting tight.
He stalked over to the adjoining door and knocked. “Dean, you have company!”
“Cas… I… You know you’re my best friend. And I think maybe… except for Sammy. I guess. You’re probably the only person… the most important… I mean. I guess what I want to say is that ever since Purgatory, well, maybe before, and. Well. Then I guess you died and I couldn’t take it, man. And then you came back but all this stuff, and what I want to say is…”
Sam came into the living room, but he didn’t smile. He just looked a little disappointed when he saw that there wasn’t any room left on the couch.
Cas, of course, finished with the werewolves, and rushed to Dean’s side immediately. Dean, slightly stunned from the ghost passing through him (plus Cas’ badass fucking moves) meant that he wasn’t quite able to stop Cas from grabbing his face and looking into his eyes. “Are you okay, Dean?” the angel asked, anxiously.
“Just to be safe,” Cas muttered, and slid his fingertip into Dean’s mouth.
Cas squinted and tilted his head in confusion, before apparently deciding that Dean was being serious, and handing him his plastic bag. Dean looked at it for a moment, then shrugged. “Which room, Cas?”
“Me too. When I saw you licking that angel-nip off your hand, I wanted to put that shit on myself just so I could hear you make that sound up close.”
He raised his hand and began stroking the blanket, and then a minute later, he slid it off the arm of the couch and buried his face in it.
Maybe it wouldn’t have happened if Sam had been along, but then again, that was probably for the best.
Cas wasn’t blind. He knew that Dean, perhaps only subconsciously, held some small attraction towards him. But Dean had never said anything, nor indicated he was interested in anything other than the friendship they had, and Cas was unwilling to jeopardize their relationship by indicating that he’d noticed, or that he himself felt similarly. He’d rather keep things as they were, rather than risk losing Dean altogether. He’d long ago accepted that a more intimate relationship with Dean was something he could never have.
“I owe you one,” he said, before turning to go into his room.
Sam snickered and headed to the other adjoining door. “I’ll let you sort this out. Meanwhile, there is a beautiful woman on the other side of this door waiting for me.” He threw the door open only to be met with shrieks as a wet and naked Rowena ran over and slammed it shut in his face.
The first time Castiel had been in the empty, it had been just that… empty.
Cas leaned towards Rowena. “I call ‘dibs’ on the ski instructor,” he whispered, using air quotes.
He ran his hands slowly back up to Dean’s neck, avoiding his ass for the moment, and Dean let out an unearthly groan of pleasure that sent shivers down Castiel’s spine. Back down again, nudging the waist of his underwear down a fraction of an inch, then back up again. He leaned down, hovering near Dean’s ear and paused.
Castiel could only nod. Being separated from Dean was like having a limb missing.
“Interesting. Very interesting,” Dean said beside him. Sam peered at him suspiciously.
So he mixed a good tablespoon into the sauce, a bit more into the garlic butter, and for good measure, sprinkled it over the top of the cheese before he put the whole dish in the oven. An hour later, he yelled for everyone to come for dinner.
Dean reached for his gun, which he didn’t have, but before he could do anything, Cas had walked over to the leviathan, only instead of smiting him, he just stood close to him and announced, “Everyone, this is Guy, our ski instructor.”
“Oh, Cas, I’m so sorry.”
Everyone turned to leave.
Yeah, okay, he could see how that could be kind of a shitty thing to have happen in front of your family. Even if he did like watching it.
Cas wasn’t exactly sure how to react. He wasn’t exactly angry. More like irritated, he figured. And it wasn’t like human drugs, where he couldn’t function or react to danger, or even develop a dependency. He was mostly just embarrassed. He sighed.
“Nothing, yet. Just wait.”
Sam picked it up right away, and was confidently doing blue runs by the second day and was already talking about getting his own skis. Castiel was skeptical at first, but he picked it up easily, saying it was the closest he’d come to flying since he lost his wings. Despite that, he spent most of the weekend on the bunny hill with Dean.
something that he hadn’t let himself want almost since the moment they’d met. He could feel the electricity of it coursing through him, the need for him building and he arched back in an attempt to get as close as possible.
As soon as they were alone, Dean turned to Sam.
“AGGhhhh!!! Get out!” Cas yelled. His eyes flared for a moment. He’d had more than enough for one night. Sam fled with his champagne clutched in his hand. Dean turned to Cas, but before he could say anything, Sam stuck his head back in the door.
“You should still talk to him.”
Cas stood up. Apparently, Dean had been closer than Cas had realized, because he almost fell over. When he straightened up, he moved away from Rowena to the other end of the couch. Fine by Cas, this way there would be room for Sam. “I’ll get it,” Cas said, and headed into the kitchen.
“Oh, fuck, yes, Cas,” Dean groaned.
He brushed against Dean’s prostate, and Dean swore, loudly, before choking out a raspy, “more,” and Cas responded by scissoring his fingers apart, opening him up.
He called out for Sam and Dean, but there was no answer. He made his way to the dorms. The lights were dim, and he had spent enough time here over the years to realize he was alone. He made his way to his room.
He paused. “Are you alright?” Castiel asked.
Despite what Sam and Dean thought about him, Cas did, in fact have a good sense of how the sort of prank wars the two brothers engaged in occasionally functioned. He also had a good idea of how to best get a little payback for Dean’s actions with the false ironwort. He was a soldier. He’d been created to strategize and outflank his opponent. And he was perfectly willing to use the endowments God had given him as an angel to his advantage.
It was a good thing he’d seen it before, because he wasn’t paying any attention. Instead, he watched Cas. It was a slow start, but worth it. Cas was watching the movie at first, but he kept sniffing and glancing to his side. After a few minutes, he began to lean over a bit, gradually getting closer and closer to the quilt, until his face was practically buried in it.
His decision made, Castiel wasted no time. He grabbed another change of clothing from Dean’s room along with a pair of sneakers he had never seen Dean wear, threw a few snacks in his bag as well, helped himself to a knife and an angel blade from the armory, then got in his truck and left.
Dean nodded. Definitely too many clothes.
That was a mistake.
Guy’s eyes lit up. “Oh, you speak French too?”
“I think so,” Sam answered. “Hey Cas, does this ironwort smell off to you?” He handed the open baggie to Cas, who took a sniff. His eyes widened and he took another, deeper sniff.
“Sam looks nice too, Rowena, don’t you think?”
“I’m sorry!” Sam said. “I had the wrong room!”
Sam looked guilty again. “How long will that take?”
Suddenly, Cas remembered something. “Oh, I just realized I can’t go.” He glanced guiltily at the brothers. “I told a friend I would help with a translation of some Enochian spells, and I’ve already postponed twice.”
He’d been full of energy when he left Kansas, well fed, and rested as though he’d slept for weeks. Or months. As it happened, he’d been gone just over three months, as he discovered once he’d turned on the radio in the truck.
“Nothing, just talking.”
“I may need something longer for a more accurate reading,” Cas muttered against Dean’s ear.
“Ohhh. Yes.” Cas cleared his throat. “It’s a herb. Mostly harmless. In the mint family. It’s good for cuts but not much else. It does have one property though.” Sam watched as red started to rise up Cas’ face. “It… uh… smells really good to angels.”
Sam started, jumping to his feet, machete in hand. His arm was raised, but he lowered it a moment later in confusion. “Cas?” he said. His voice sounded broken.
Dean stood outside the adjoining door to the right hand room and took a deep breath, getting up his nerve. He could do this. He knocked gently on the door.
“Ungh, yeah,” Dean moaned.
“I want to go to your room,” the angel said. “I want to see if there’s anything I can do that will make you make the same sound.”
Sam figured he had a fifty-fifty shot, so he took a stab at it and opened the door to the middle room and flicked on the light.
Guy greeted Sam and then turned to Dean, fixing him with a smile that still reminded Dean a little too much of Dick Roman for his own peace of mind. “Enchanté,” he murmured. “I was just in the kitchen putting the supplies away. I have a menu planned for you all today.” He listed some fancy dishes he was planning to make.
“I think you’re healthy,” Cas said, solemnly.
“It would be better if ROWENA HAD THE HOTS FOR SAM,” Cas repeated, loudly.
“You’re right, we should get you out of some of these clothes. You do have a lot of layers on.”
A moment later, Sam’s head popped out of his door, followed almost immediately by Dean’s.
“Are you sure it’s not harmful?”
“Fuck, yes,” Dean replied. He didn’t move though. Instead he just kissed Cas again, until eventually the angel grabbed onto his shirt and started tugging, and they just sort of stumbled their way to Dean’s room.
Dean rose to meet him as Cas began a steady glide in and out of him, and he lowered himself down to his elbow, pressing his body more firmly against Dean’s back as he moved within him, mouthing at his shoulder and neck, letting his tongue trace along behind his ear and to his jaw.
“Well… no. But when Rowena was flirting with me, he got jealous and dragged her off.”
Cas frowned at her. “He’s been pretty down, lately, after the last year.”
“Even better! You know how I’ve been saying we should take a holiday? Well, I have it right here! A three day weekend in Breckenridge, with a private lodge, and lessons from an Olympic champion!”
Once things were set in motion, Castiel was able to take some time to visit some of the souls he’d met on earth. He visited Charlie, Kevin, and Bobby, but he saved Mary for last. He’d known her best of all, in some ways, having met her later in his time on Earth. She had been part of his life when he’d been most fulfilled, living in the bunker with Jack, Sam, and Dean. He’d been more human-like by then, less the angelic force he’d been when he’d met Bobby, and he loved her like family in a way he felt with nobody else besides Jack and the Winchester brothers.
“In the hallway?”
Everyone stared at each other in silence for a moment until finally Dean spoke up. “Look, we could talk about this all night and figure it out, but I think we’ve all been embarrassed enough for one night. Let’s just all go to bed. In our
Dean’s hand clenched randomly on his cock as he focused all his attention on where Cas was fucking him, all pretense discarded. He could feel his orgasm building with each stroke, partly elicited by what Cas was doing, but mostly caused by the fact that this was
“Excuse me!” Guy said loudly from the bed. “But could Dean and I
Finally, he could stall no more. He sat on the bed and rubbed the back of his neck. Cas gingerly sat down on the end of the bed, perched like he was ready to bolt at the slightest provocation.
his form. He knew that he could exist on Earth that way, but he’d never be able to be as close to people as he had been in the last few years.
“Hey, have you seen a couple of feds here in town?” He hoped the boys were using the FBI cover on this case, because if not, he wasn’t sure what he could try next.
“As you know, I’ve been working to repopulate the angels with converted human souls. I think I’ve found a way to reverse the process. The other times you were ‘human’, you weren’t really human, so much as graceless to the point that the core of your grace, your essence, was basically functioning as a soul. If you want, I could convert your grace into a genuine human soul. After that, resurrecting your body is simple, and I would simply place your soul back in your body. You’d be fully human, permanently. You wouldn’t be able to steal grace, or hear angel radio, you’ld age and die, and your soul would be weighed by Anubis and sent to Heaven or Hell.”
He waited a week or so before he tried again. This time, he wanted to be a bit more subtle.
“It smells… it smells…” Cas sniffed the bag again, practically shoving his nose inside. “It smells so good. I don’t think this is ironwort.”
“Me too,” Dean, Cas, Guy, and Rowena all said at once. They all followed Sam out of the living room.
Cas tipped his head back with his hand to his mouth, chasing it with a water bottle he produced from his other pocket, and then proceeded to
He was freezing, lying in the pitch black on a cold floor, and for a moment, he thought he was in the Empty again. But it took only a moment to realize he was actually able to feel the floor beneath his fingertips, cold concrete, and as his eyes adjusted, he realized it wasn’t as dark as he thought. A sliver of light came from what looked to be a door left ajar.
Shit, Cas looked hot standing there, backlit from the bathroom, his hair all stuck up and his sleeves rolled up, exposing his taut biceps. They were probably so firm from all the… like… knife fighting. And smiting. Dean swallowed hard.
and Dean fucking loved it.
“It looks like they’re kissing,” Mary said. “It’s so sweet.”
Cas slipped his finger into Dean’s mouth.
“How is your rum?” he asked her.
Dean’s hands clenched in the bedding and his hips lifted, and Cas bent over Dean, letting his mouth brush over the curve of Dean’s ass and up his back, letting his tongue trail up his spine. He picked up speed, bracing himself with his other hand as he hovered over Dean, his own hips twitching, frustrated.
Mary blushed.
“Dean?” he whispered.
He slowly came down, and Cas slowed his movements, but he didn’t stop. When Dean was able to open his eyes, it was to find Cas still watching him, a lazy smile on his lips.
Cas and Dean didn’t talk about it again, but Dean still thought about it a lot. About Cas, licking the plate, licking his fingers. Burying his nose in the bag. The
“So, you’re a ski champ
“Mary said that?”
“Unnggh…” Dean moaned, and Cas smiled a little.
He got unsteadily to his feet, realizing as he did so that he was completely nude. He made his way to the door and pushed it open, realizing immediately that he had woken up in the dungeon of the Men of Letters bunker. He smiled in relief. He was home.
“Really? Is it gonna hurt him?”
something he’d never done as far as any of them had ever seen before.
Guy caught Dean’s eye, and raised one eyebrow as if to say, “see?”
Castiel stood, shrugging out of his coat and suit jacket. He hesitated a moment, before rolling up his sleeves. Dean watched him intently, his eyes wide. Castiel went to wet the cloth again. While the water ran, Castiel looked at himself in the mirror. He was definitely flushed, and it wasn’t because of any ghost sickness. Honestly, he was surprised he had enough blood left in his body to flush his face, since so much of it seemed to have collected in his vessel’s penis.
“Well, technically…” Dean said.
“Hey, Cas?”
Eileen called. She had a case. Sam left without Castiel, although he tried to get him to come along. Castiel didn’t want to hunt.
“That’s good.” Dean wished he could feel that way.
Everyone was staring at him. Dean looked around frantically. When his eyes landed on Guy, he snapped, “Get the hell out of my bed!”
Dean jumped as Rowena spoke right behind him. He hadn’t even heard her follow him up the stairs. “Brilliant! My room is right next to yours!” She walked past him and entered the room on the right. Sam was right behind her on the stairs, lugging all her luggage with him.
Cas just shook his head at her and ushered her out of his room, muttering something about how humans, even witchy ones, seemed way too obsessed with sex.
“That you are, Sammy,” Dean laughed. “Seriously, though. Rowena? I mean, sure she’s hot, but she’s also kinda witchy.”
He felt Cas shift, moving his outside leg over Dean’s and moving up so he was kneeling between Dean’s thighs, and Dean opened further to accommodate him. Cas sucked in a breath, and finally,
“What?” Mary said.
He worked his way down Dean’s back once again, and when he reached the offending underwear he hooked his fingers into the waistband and slowly tugged them off, creeping backwards until he reached Dean’s feet. He slid them off and tossed them aside, kneeling with one leg between Dean’s and working his way slowly back up, one big hand on each leg, thumbs and fingers working the muscles in his calves and thighs.
“It’s me, Dean,” he began. “This is so hard. I have been keeping this inside for what seemed like forever, but I guess with everything being so dire all the time, it never felt like the right time. I know we’ve had our differences in the past, our trust issues. But with all we’ve been through, I am starting to realize we have to grab happiness when we can. And so, I wanted… I needed to tell you… I love you.”
“And now we’re going to say goodnight to Rowena,” Dean added.
Another moment passed, then Guy’s head popped out of his room.
He let his other hand roam, tweaking his nipples and hips and thighs.
Everyone started shouting over each other at that, louder and louder, until they were all silenced by a loud whistle from the doorway. Everyone stopped and turned to see Mary Winchester standing there, her fingers in her mouth.
There was nobody there but each other, so they both shrugged sheepishly at each other, said good night again, and went back into their rooms.
She turned and headed back to her room.
Guy winked at him again. “I guess I’ll see you later, then.”
But with the events of the last few months, it was in an uproar. Angels and demons of all kinds had woken up. Some wandered, calling out for companions, while others fought, old grudges awoken just as easily as those who held them.
Mary sighed.
The door flew open, and Dean stood on the other side. He looked like he was about to tear into Sam again, but then he saw the ski instructor.
Sam walked up behind his mom and tapped her on the shoulder. She jumped, and Sam took a step back with his hands up.
So he brought his hands up to Cas’ face and tilted his head a little bit and kissed him harder. Might as well go for broke.
“Yeah, pretty shitty,” Cas said. He frowned. His mellow mood was fading quickly. He sat up. “Why would you do it?”
Sam pulled the bitchiest face Dean had ever seen, and then turned on his heel and left.
“I was. I just thought I would see what you were doing first,” Cas answered.
“You sound like a wonderful mother,” Guy said, beaming at her. “And you look so young, too!”
She turned the volume down an infinitesimal amount. “Sorry,” she said. “I had a cold last week and my ear is still plugged up.”
examination.
Cas thought about it. “As long as you ask, Dean. And don’t just spring it on me.”
It was just as he’d left it. A framed photo of himself and Jack, a few odds and ends he’d picked up over time, a notebook. Nothing else. He didn’t have his phone or his angel blade, those having been on his person when he’d been swallowed by the Empty. He didn’t even have any clothing.
Before he drove away, Sam hugged Castiel. “I’m glad you’re here. I’m sorry.” Sam said. He drove off. The dog went with him.
Dean couldn’t even respond. He just leaned back onto the door as Cas licked at the side of his neck, behind his ear, then the front of his throat. His hand worked its way under the shirt Dean was wearing, but when his mouth got to the collar, he gripped it and tugged in frustration.
Dean who if he was being honest with himself, kind of wanted to punch him in his stupid angel face right now, just bit out a terse “I’m fine.”
“Mm. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean looked at Cas. Cas looked back, his blue eyes shining, and everything Dean was was reflected back. Cas’ hand came up to touch his cheek. “Me too. Dean, oh, Dean! I never thought!  Maybe this weekend, I considered that what I wanted wasn’t going to happen, and maybe anyone would do.” He laughed a bit. “That was silly.”
“I am concerned I may catch your... fever.”
“Are you okay?” Sam asked.
Sam’s glare at Dean intensified. Dean ignored him, but Cas was unsure. “I don’t know if there will be enough room.”
Dean made a lot of sense.
“You’re still pretty hot. Uh, warm.” Cas said.
Cas’ hand left Dean’s ass and when he felt a finger press to his lips, he was disappointed for a moment, but when Cas said “Wet it, please,” he eagerly opened his mouth and sucked him in, slurping his finger and swirling his tongue around the digit.
He was something other, and his hands could kill as easily as they could heal. It terrified Dean, but in a way that sent tingles down his spine, sent heat through his veins.
“Can you all keep it down? I’m trying to sleep… hey! My ear popped!”
He just wouldn’t be able to feel it.
Cas steered him towards the bed, and Dean complied.
“It’s about freaking time.”
Castiel saw the creation of the paradise Jack had shown him when Kelly had taken his hand so long ago.
The bathroom door opened in a whoosh and Dean’s heart fell into his stomach… then it shot straight back up and entirely out of his body, because it wasn’t Cas standing in the bathroom doorway.
Dean was not threatened by Sam. Not even a bit. “All I said was, that it’s interesting.” He smiled at Sam, then winked, before heading out of the room.
“I don’t know if I will be able to judge your temperature accurately without a deeper reading, and I am going to need a more effective lubricant for that,” Cas said.
Even Sam noticed Cas’ unusual gluttony. He stopped eating and just watched as Cas shoveled it all in, then his eyes widened as Cas proceeded to
For a second, he was relieved. He saw Dean, standing against a post, his head bowed. But his relief was short lived. At his feet sat Sam, surrounded by the corpses of vampires, and he was crying.
Dean didn’t even pretend. He closed his eyes and sucked Cas’ finger into his mouth, biting gently to hold him in place, then ran the tip of his tongue up one side and down the other. Cas pulled back slightly, and Dean moaned, and Cas
“We can go to my room.”
Just then, Dean strolled in. “Hey, Sam, welcome back. Hey Cas.”
So, as much as Cas was enjoying himself, it wasn’t worth disrupting everything.
“I am,” Guy replied.
“Okay,” Sam said over the phone. “I saved that website on my computer. Just go into past orders, and find ironwort.”
“Can I smell?” Jack piped up. Without waiting for an answer, he bent forward and took a sniff. “That smells really nice,” he said. “I like it. I hope your spell works, Sam,” he said, before turning on his heel and heading towards the kitchen.
Cas said something in French to Guy, and Guy finally stopped staring at Dean long enough to reply. They spoke back and forth for a moment, and Dean noticed that Cas did not take his eyes off Guy at all the whole time. It was irritating. Finally, in order to break up the conversation, Dean just blurted out the first thing that came to his mind.
“I would enjoy it more if it had Wi-fi.”
“Just needs a bit more rum,” Mary replied.
He crept quietly through the back door, listening for any sign of danger and waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dim light.. He knew he could be just as easily jumped by a Winchester as by a monster, and a Winchester was twice as dangerous. His sneakers made no noise on the dirt floor, and he bent low as he crept past the old stalls.
He didn’t think he would be able to handle it if Cas got into his pants right now. And honestly, he wanted a turn exploring Cas’ body as well. He wanted to see what was under all those layers. Investigate at his leisure. So he yanked Cas to his feet and began pulling him out of all his clothing.
Castiel had visited Jimmy and Amelia as well, and although there were no bad feelings between them, it didn’t change the damage he’d done to the Novak family.
“Please don’t go.”
“Jack is only half angel,” Cas said. He stared at the bag, then shook his head and looked up at Sam. “It’s definitely not going to work in that spell, though. It’s not good for much else, unless you wanted to make a particular kind of incense.”
“I’ll call you later, I’m driving,” Sam said, and hung up.
There was a pause, then Cas answered. “Good, actually. I feel, mellow, but not like I’ve been drugged or anything. More like… like I’m limber and warm. I think I needed that stretch.”
Dean looked at his brother, waiting seductively in Cas’ room, and felt a fury he hadn’t felt since he had the Mark.
“Oh… that sounds like heaven!” Cas said. “Fresh air, nice views. Curling up with a blanket by the fire with a steamy drink…”
The baby, Dean, was born, and Castiel held him the next day. “Say hello to your Uncle Cas,” Sam said. Castiel looked into his watery, unseeing baby eyes and smiled.
Suddenly, Sam stood up. “Well, I’m off to bed.”
“I’m sure she would understand-” Sam began.
“I know you’re unhappy, Cas. I want to help.”
Sam looked at Rowena. “It almost makes you feel romantic,” he sighed.
Fuck. That came out wrong.
Cas gripped Dean’s hip tightly, moving his knee to get better leverage, and the angle must have found that spot inside Dean because he sucked in a breath and gasped, “There, Cas, yes.” Cas endeavored to comply, angling his hips to let his cock stroke against Dean’s prostate, and Dean let his eyes close as he
Cas leaned forward, paused, just shy of Dean, and Dean could feel his breath, he could feel the sheer electricity of him, and he leaned the rest of the way and let their lips brush together.
Besides, it wasn’t like he had the opportunity to touch Dean that often. To take care of him. So, as long as he could reasonably get away with it, he would.
Everyone greeted him, with apparent friendliness. The guy, “Guy,” was only looking at Dean, though. Dean stared back, and it took him a moment to realize he wasn’t actually Dick Roman, he just really resembled him. He could have been his brother. Dean sidled over to Sam. “Does he look like anyone you know?” he asked.
“I may need to remove your remaining undergarment, if that’s all right.”
“I know, I’m awesome,” Dean replied.
Cas’ room was dark, but just as Cas fumbled for the light switch, there was a loud POP. When the lights came on, they revealed Sam, shirtless, in Cas’ bed, with a bottle of champagne spewing all over his chest and lap. As soon as he saw who it was, Sam started desperately trying to keep the champagne in the bottle, but only succeeded in spilling even more of it.
Castiel hurried down the hall to his and Dean’s bathroom. As soon as he was out of view, Jack slumped against the banister and exhaled.
“You….” Dean rubbed the book’s margin. “You know Cass means a lot to me.”
“I don’t think so,” Dean chuckled.
“Okay.” Castiel entered a sitting pose, rolling his neck in circles once he was upright again. “This weekend.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Do I deserve to die? For what reason?”
“Pink suits you.” Castiel winked. “Isn’t this perfect timing?”
“Uh—actually, uh—”
“What, you’re mad at me too now?” Dean crinkled up the bag and returned it to the cabinet. “Can’t do anything right around here, I guess.”
“Oh, talk about me like I’m not here.”
Dean nodded again, opening his eyes this time. Castiel was staring up at him, his brow furrowed in concentration. At his back, the tentacles that weren’t on or in Dean swarmed around wildly, sparking with spasmodic fluorescence.
“And to think, I knew you when you were just a small fry who liked flirting with random men on Instagram.”
“What did
“It feels good when you press against it,” Dean said bashfully. It was ridiculous that he was even still capable of shame, considering that he was willingly allowing alien tentacles to plunder his cock and ass while a half-dozen others were suspending him in the air like a marionette.
Blue-Eyes was the sixth dragon he’d faced down and—depending on what Dean found upon investigating the lair—either the fourth he’d killed or the third that had slipped his grasp. This one was by far the largest of the six, and distinct in several other ways besides. He hadn’t attempted to fight back, even just with his wings or claws. He’d expressed regret for the hardship he’d caused for the villagers. He’d attempted to reason with Dean. All of this was unheard of.
“Huh.” Dean took another bite of his panini. “That all about Mike?”
“I’m going to take a shower,” Dean said, after a minute or so of Castiel leaning against him.
“But if it sees everything, it can’t help it.”
“I didn’t think I’d have many guests. Which was true, until you came along.” Castiel returned to the hallway. “Speaking of my office, that’s the last stop on the tour. I suppose you’ve sort of seen it already.”
be careful. I’m following you.”
“It’s unfair,” Castiel said, once he couldn’t bear the silence any longer. “That you had to drop out.”
“Sam taught me that much,” Dean said. He flashed Castiel a wry look over his shoulder. “That’s why you’re standing behind me, right?”
It was a short video; there was nothing complicated or special about granola. Dean didn’t know why people bought it prepackaged in the first place. Once it was out of the oven, Dean poured himself a glass of whiskey and went out to the deck to sit. It was fully dark now—the moon was new, so the stars were all there was.
“Perish the thought. Your grandfather had excellent taste.”
“But…maybe I’ll see you tonight?”
“Ah. North Dakota?”
He really didn’t. A private sailboat ride on Lake Champlain—one that’d been kept a surprise, to boot—seemed pretty much the epitome of a “cheesy date,” to use Meg’s term.
“You make me happy.” Dean lay his mug to the side and nuzzled Castiel’s neck. “That’s all I need.”
He was talking about Charlie, of course. Her job as the day shift front desk manager at Le Petit Oiseau included scheduling and reservations for the entire operation. At least she didn’t have any involvement with the restaurant outside of that and would have long since gone home by the time he and Castiel arrived on Friday.
“I know. I just wanted them for—for—” Dean gulped. “Cass, I want you to know that I’m not just sorry about last night. I want you to know that I get it more now. The—the meaningful connection thing. You and me, it’s not just about sex. It shouldn’t be, and I’d never want it to be about that. It’s like, um, this song.”
“Okay.” Dean held up his hands, pushed back his chair. “Okay, you’re right. I’m sorry. I’ll be a good boy and work on my spreadsheet until dinner.”
The guy laughs. His breath billows out in hot, sour clouds that dissipate into the wind and snow. He smells like cheap vodka and stale corn chips. Dean wonders if he’s laughing at his prices or how he blurted them out artlessly or something else entirely. He’s never done this before, so he’s just copying what he’s seen.
“Yes, you’re probably right,” Castiel said, though the tone of his voice indicated that he didn’t think Dean was right at all. Dean didn’t know how to interpret that.
*If you can’t find radishes with tops, that’s okay! Use about a cup of another leafy vegetable, like spinach or arugula, or half a cup of an herb like flat-leaf parsley or basil. This dish is also just fine with radishes alone.
“It’s when one guy licks his tongue around the other guy’s butthole,” Dean said, after a beat. He mimed the action with his tongue. “Sometimes he even sticks it inside.”
“I like this spot, Dean.” He stroked the window column and gazed in the other direction, where the state route led north to the border with West Virginia.
After a few seconds, he felt Castiel’s hand on his shoulder.
He switched out a word.
Castiel tilted his head. In spite of his tense nerves and hammering heart, Dean couldn’t help but smile. That confused head tilt had been one of the first things Dean had noticed about Castiel, back when they sat next to each other in the rear corner of sophomore geometry.
“Dammit,” Dean grumbled.
They lie there and watch cartoons for a while in silence. Outside, the snowstorm whips along the motel’s walls and whistles under its balcony. Dean hopes that the wind doesn’t wake Sam up. They both have school tomorrow. It’s the last day of school before Thanksgiving break.
Said driver, a guy in his mid-thirties with messy chestnut-brown hair and expensive-looking aviators perched on his nose, managed to exit without scratching Dean’s most prized possession. He thumped the door shut behind him and peered around the parking lot with his hands on his hips. Definitely an out-of-towner, if the Swarthmore T-shirt and flashy ride hadn’t made it obvious enough.
“If anything, that’s just a sign he really means it.” Castiel paused. “Wow. I knew he liked you, but—wow.”
“Please fetch us breakfast,” Castiel said, attempting to return them to some modicum of propriety. “I’m hungry.”
“She’s actually not that bad. She might even take a liking to you. She has a thing for salt-of-the-earth types.” Castiel checked his watch. “We need to get out of here. Let me just quickly check my hair.”
Gently, Castiel cupped his chin, brought his gaze back to him. A hot tear rolled down Dean’s cheek.
“Yeah, disappeared.” Dean held out the list in front of them. “You still want the kale chips?”
Dean almost slipped on the war room’s sleek tile floor in his attempt to comply. Anything to get his angel’s dick inside him again.
Dean just rolled his eyes. He bucked his hips a little, insinuating his dick between Castiel’s lips again. They sucked each other in quiet for a while, until Dean maneuvered himself on top of Castiel and looked down between them.
“Maybe they’re as intrigued by you as I am.” Castiel returned his phone to the pocket of his sweatpants. “What are you making?”
It’s only part of the truth. He doesn’t want Castiel to know where Sam is because, as nice as Castiel seems, protecting Sam is too important. But it’s more than that. He doesn’t want Castiel, a normal guy with a normal family, to find out that Dean lives in a seedy motel with his 10-year-old brother and no parents to take care of them.
“I like that song ironically.”
“Dean!”
“Damn.” Dean gulped. “I should say that’s corny, but it kind of sounds like you mean it.”
“Actually—” Castiel looked down at the carpet. “If you’d stayed and eavesdropped a while longer, you would’ve heard the rest of what he said. He can’t overrule Bartholomew, but he’s offering to give you the money from his own accounts. I’ll pay him back in a couple years.”
“No,” Castiel agrees. “I became addicted to you long ago, Dean. Open your pretty mouth.”
“You and me.” Dean’s Adam’s apple bobbed against Castiel’s shoulder. “Like this.”
“I remember bits. Flashes. Light, everywhere. Being carried. A hand on my shoulder.”
“Jack’s always been good at eating his vegetables. Even as a baby. Unfortunately, he likes junk food, too.”
“Huh.” Dean watched Castiel’s hands. “What are you thinking you’ll do?”
Dean thought.
“Hello?”
“Oh, that’s a shame.” Castiel leaned towards Dean. “She’s visiting family, then. I’d hoped you could meet her.”
“Yeah, so now comes the rolling. You want to take the tortilla out of the sauce—”
Okay, maybe he has the tiniest sliver of an angel kink.
Castiel tsked. “It’ll be fine. Anyone who really wants to know who I am can find out pretty easily. It’s not like I’m in witness protection. Besides—”
“Yeah, it’s a long story. Point is, it’s just me and Sam now. I’ve been his guardian since I was 18. Kind of been the one looking after him for longer than that, though.”
Once they were in position, Sam lit the match and threw it in. Polychromatic smoke billowed up, wafting in the gentle breeze.
Castiel sipped his coffee and shrugged. “It’ll still be good tomorrow. We can have it before we drive to Charlottesville.”
They spent the rest of the afternoon getting Dean’s costume ready. The trench coat fit Dean almost perfectly, which Castiel supposed made sense, since it had always been a little bit loose on him. Putting that aside, they measured and cut tail-holes in a pair of boxers and one of Castiel’s roomier pairs of blue jeans.
“I’ll get it,” he volunteered.
“Not ‘get used to it’ as in
Castiel draped his T-shirt over his closet door. He always did that after he’d been on a run or a bike ride—that way, his sweaty clothes would dry off before he chucked them in with the rest of his laundry. Funnily enough, that didn’t stink up the room at all. Castiel even smelled good when he was sweaty.
“Okay. You want to talk about it?”
“You put down angels all the time—not as much as you used to, but you had so much scorn for Jofiel today. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself every time we’ve had to kill an angel, but I don’t think you feel much empathy for them at all. I know angels have made mistakes, but we still have value and worth. And not just in bed.”
“You’re just clear-eyed about his flaws.”
“Almost never,” Dean conceded. “But you know the first morning I let myself sleep in will be when disaster strikes. It’s the way of the universe.”
“Why’re you saying this?”
“I was younger than her. Like you and Castiel. Well, she was six years older than me, so a little more. Most people in those days thought six years was a lot when the woman was the older one. Maybe they still do.” Chuck smiled wistfully. “It didn’t help that I was shorter, too. Honestly, I don’t know what she saw in me.”
“The guy in front of our dad had a Colt Single Action Army on his hip. Sam lifted it without either one of them noticing, but of course the dude checked his holster as he was walking out. He laughed it off, even gave Sam one of the snacks he’d bought, but Dad was pissed—with Sam for doing it, with me for not watching him. I think he was afraid of what might’ve happened if the gun accidentally went off and hurt one of us, but Sam was too young to understand that.” Dean ate the last bite of his sandwich and balled up the wax paper. “Sam stopped practicing magic tricks after that.”
“I don’t know. That’d be like him losing half his personality.” Dean switched off the light and started down the short hallway that ended with his bedroom. “Another bathroom here, on the left. This is the one I use, since it’s right next to my room. Feel free to use it, though.”
“See you back at the room, maybe.”
Like Cass. Cass was a good person, yet he knew more about politics than anyone Dean had ever met. He'd vote for Cass for president.
“Dean seems trustworthy, but we’ve only known him for a short while.” Castiel made a right into the Food Land parking lot. “What would you send him, anyway?”
Dean took a deep breath and reached for his coffee. To his left, Castiel seemed to be absorbing this—either that, or gathering his own thoughts.
“The veterinarian says he needs to lose a few pounds,” Castiel said.
“Because…because I’m returning there to scout for the dragon anyway. This way, I can protect you.”
“No, only my hectocotylus.”
Double shifts exhausted Dean down to his bones. He stripped off everything but his boxers, stumbled and groaned, and fell into bed. He couldn’t even be bothered to brush his teeth. He’d take care of it in the morning.
“Plus, it’s cooler in the truck.” Castiel grabbed the front of his blue floral shirt and fanned himself.
“I love you too.” Castiel smoothed his fingers through Dean’s sweat-soaked hair. “But…it doesn’t look like the Empty took the bait.”
“Yeah. Charlie’ll be back soon, anyway.”
“Oh!” Castiel nodded sagely. “You’re right, Dean. For me, whether she wins or loses the nomination, Elizabeth Warren’s really the breakout star of the Democratic primaries.”
“A new car for his sixteenth birthday?” Dean raised his eyebrows. “I bet he’s popular with the ladies.”
“Yeah, but…it’s his birthday, Cass.”
Dean looked up from the menu. Castiel wasn’t looking at him; he’d twisted in his seat to sniff a cluster of roses behind his shoulder.
“Wow.” Dean shook his head. “You’re right, I can’t believe that. Dick move.”
“You know what I really like? Hearing you say ‘we’ and ‘us’ when you’re talking about the farm.”
“Well, you kind of are a nerd.” Dean hugged his waist. “Good thing I’m into that.”
“Really?”
“Sire?” He crouched down to the bed, lay his hand on Castiel’s arm. “What’s wrong?”
Meg leaned forward with interest.
Castiel nodded. “I’ve sort of had a thing for you for a while. If it’s not too weird to admit that.”
“Hey, bitch.”
“Let me finish. I want to start an organization that combats hunger and food insecurity in Winchester. We’ll do this by working with area farmers to secure their excess produce for local food pantries. We’ll give them the funding they need to meet any labor shortfalls and invest in greater productivity. And maybe this organization can partner with your channel, you know? We can raise awareness and you can show your audience the difference cooks can make in their communities by helping to alleviate food insecurity.”
“No more shame, Dean.” Castiel eased him away, stood him upright again. “You’ve spent too much of your life that way. I don’t want you to hide any part of yourself from me. I love all of you. There’s no part of you I don’t love.”
Well, enigma was a strong word. Dean was just curious about him, and if he was right about the feelings he was developing for Castiel, he’d prefer to find out any nasty surprises sooner rather than later.
“Goodnight,” Castiel said simply. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
1 teaspoon brown sugar or maple sugar
“You want this on the rotation, then?”
“Fair point.” Castiel stroked Dean’s skin with his thumb just above the ice pack. “If you’re thinking of moving away, you don’t have to stay because of me. I’ll miss you, but—”
“There’s something I’d like to say, too,” he said.
The dad paused midway through taking off his aviators.
“I don’t mind that you’re a virgin.” He laughs again. “You’ll have to grow up sometime, little boy. Why not let me pay you for it?”
Dean snorted. He rubbed his hands along Castiel’s.
Dean pursed his lips. “There’s still plenty more I could teach you.”
“Not—not yet.”
“Enough, Meg.” Castiel returned his phone to his pocket. “I need to finish eating and then meet Dean.”
In one fluid motion, the creature scooped Castiel up and held him against his chest, one arm behind his shoulder blades and the other beneath his knees. He pivoted and continued up the hill.
“Your sappiness is contagious, what can I say.” Meg stood up with her mug. “I’m going back to forage. You want anything?”
Dean started. In his peripheral vision, he saw Luke boring that same simper into the side of his face. He took a moment, remembering Castiel’s admonition that Luke loved nothing more than a reaction, and decided to ignore him.
“Hey, Jack,” Castiel called.
“Yeah, but that’s not easy. First, the fields have to be retrofitted for average people, not to mention small children. We’re on a grade, which means there’s even more to think about in terms of safety than on a flatland farm. Second, we’ll need staff—probably almost as many as if I were just employing pickers. Third, we’ll have to redo all our business insurance to cover liability for guests, and that’ll be expensive. That’s just for starters. I can think of a dozen other things.”
“Yeah.” Dean cleared his throat. “Sorry, just thought I saw someone.”
“Okay. Dean, you hold one handle; Cass grabs the other. Remember, Dean—no thoughts other than Cass for the entire time I’m chanting. Otherwise, we can’t try again for a year.”
“You should go to him. He’s probably cooled off by now.”
A long silence passed over their table. Sam chewed his food, seeming to mull something over.
“You know, start of summer? All the out-of-towners crowding into their vacation homes, sunbathing on the lake, hiking the happy trails?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows. “Dude, for the next three months, this place is loaded with California chicks looking for a summer fling. And once fall rolls around? They head back home, never to be seen again. No mess, no tears, no ties.”
“Oh.” Castiel turned to the pan, flipped the tofu steaks. “That’s okay. You don’t have to.”
They walked down to the parking lot behind the chapel. Castiel’s car was at the end of the first row, and he started drifting towards it out of habit.
“I didn’t know you liked the Who.”
“Let he who is without stinky socks cast the first stone.” Castiel lay his watch on the bureau. “I’ll do the laundry tomorrow. And I’m sure the ducks and chickens will be happy to see me again.”
“She doesn’t
Neither of them moved for several seconds. Through the open door at the end of the hallway, Dean could see the curtains above his old bed drifting in the warm breeze.
Castiel took a deep breath. Maybe this thing with Dean didn’t need to be going anywhere. Maybe they could just enjoy each other’s company right now and figure out the rest later. That sounded…very nice, actually.
“Just dial it back a little. You can’t force anything. Let him come out of his shell on his own.”
“This is farro.” Dean picked up a clear bowl and showed it to the camera. “It’s an ancient grain. Really nice and chewy, with a nutty flavor that’s pretty distinctive. It used to be hard to find outside of big cities here, but it’s more common now.”
That was enough time to set the vase of flowers at the center of the dining table and scatter and light the candles around it. There was a good mix of them—tall beeswax ones, stout bayberry ones, tiny tea ones. With the sun slipping under the western ridge by now, they made up the balance of the light in the dining room. Dean stared at the dancing flames, shaking his head in disbelief.
“Like a fine wine, yeah, yeah.” Castiel swallowed down the rest of a mozzarella stick. “Brat.”
Dean straightened up from behind the bar and beamed, placing a few Collins glasses on the counter in front of him.
They both looked at the towel for a moment. Only 12 hours had passed since his and Dean’s late-night conversation, but Castiel had already imagined the way this would go. He’d seen a few videos, after all, and he thought he might be able to emulate them.
“Also, it’s a little adversarial to count someone else’s drinks.” Castiel tutted his disapproval.
Castiel rolled his eyes and started the car. He only had ten minutes to get back to campus, find a parking space, and sprint to the third floor of the humanities building.
Dean curled his arm around Castiel’s waist, rubbed his side.
“Gently,” Dean reminded him.
Castiel led him past the linen closet, pointing it out. Dean’s feet squished wetly on the hardwood. When they reached the bathroom, Castiel switched on the light inside the doorway.
He pointed at the
“Hang on,” Dean said. “I’ll unlock your door.”
“A book?”
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugged. “Doesn’t mean she’s not annoying.”
Dean lay out the spread on the roof between them, and they ate straight from the containers. Castiel tried a bite of everything before he fully dug in. When the car radio started playing “Dust on the Bottle,” Dean snickered.
“Nah. Come all the way up here for a job, I’d rather work until it’s done. Means I get back to Louisiana faster.”
Castiel awoke in the twilight before dawn. The room was blue-tinged grey, the color of the horizon just before a storm, and the breeze through the casement window above the bed was chilly. Underneath the covers, though, everything was warm.
“Well, maybe we’ll see you later,” Castiel said to Kelly. “Friday, otherwise.”
Dean leaned in, and Castiel pushed the huckleberry past his lips before planting a kiss there. He held Dean by the cheek as he stepped away.
An unreadable look settled over Chuck’s face for a few seconds. He tapped the neck of the whiskey bottle.
“They only yell at each other sometimes. You just had the bad luck of coming to one where they did.”
“For heaven’s sake,” Rowena groaned. “Talk about your lucky day. You already got engaged to the youngest and cutest of the Shurley brothers, how much more do you need?”
Dean could feel Castiel’s eyes on him, but he didn’t look up from his pancakes. He felt heat rising to his face and he didn’t know why.
“Yeah, I started this thread on a gay forum. Said I was looking for advice on having anal sex for the first time and that I’d be the one playing catcher. And that my boyfriend was on the larger side of average. Got a few replies like those, but most of the dudes were really nice.”
His knees buckled, but Castiel caught him just in time. He lifted him into the air, spinning him around so they were facing the same way again. He laid him down beside him.
“My shirt,” Castiel said mournfully.
“It’s no big deal, Cass. What kind of worthless roommate would I be if I didn’t throw you a little shindig?”
“Can’t we?” Castiel stretched his wings. “Hang onto me, Dean.”
As they emerged into the sunshine, Castiel turned to Dean and watched the light spread across his profile. It was a bright, breezy day, with only a few popcorn-shaped clouds drifting in from the west and the scent of rain barely lingering in the air from last night’s downpour. He, Anna, and Jack had spent the evening watching a ponderous superhero flick—letting Jack choose was the only way he’d stick around for an entire movie—and Castiel had fallen asleep on the sectional, lulled by the patter on the lake house’s roof. As a result, he’d woken up with a slight crick in his neck today.
Suddenly, Sam could see it. The resemblance to Dick Roman. Huh.
“Rowena??!”
“This is really good,” Jack said. He looked like he was enjoying it a lot, albeit not quite as intensely as Cas was.
Mary laughed. “I made these for a Christmas party once. I knew your father was coming and I wanted to ask him out. I was hoping it would stiffen my nerves. Just think, if it weren’t for these, you boys might not even be here. In the end, it’s the things you don’t try that you end up regretting, even more than your failures.” She sighed happily and looked at everyone sitting together, sipping their drinks. “It sure is nice, here in this cozy place, being surrounded by family. We don’t have enough times like this.”
Guy didn’t reply, but that was because Dean chose that moment to come into the living room, dressed in his hotdog pajamas and dead guy robe. Guy straightened up.
a gourmet chef?” Dean asked, skeptically.
Cas cut his thoughts off before they got out of hand. Yeah, he could definitely see the appeal in that.
“What did you win?”
“That way, north,” Cas said, pointing.
Dean burped as he opened Sam’s laptop, which he had left behind for Jack to use while his was being repaired. Dean blinked a little. In all honesty, he was a little smashed. He’d been drinking tonight, maybe a bit too much, but it was fine. It was fiiiine.
“I do not believe Rowena is exactly your cup of tea, is she?”
“We just ran into each other here.” A faint frown flickered across Cas’s face. “I was on my way to the kitchen.”
“Amateur,” he snickered. He didn’t want to get Sam on his case before he could have a chance to truly mess with Cas, so he didn’t actually take any of the baggies. Instead, he grabbed an empty jar and poured a little out of each of them into it, before sealing it up tight and putting the original jar back where he’d gotten it.
Dean was saved from any further uncomfortable conversations by Sam coming into the room, carrying a tray of mugs. Dean realized suddenly that maybe he should ask Sam about this. Alone.
The next morning was a little awkward, but Guy turned out to be an exemplary instructor, and everyone had a great time.
As soon as he was inside, he realized what the problem was. There was light and sound coming from the bathroom. Maybe this would be better. It might be easier if he didn’t have to look Cas in the eye.
“Maybe you’re right.”
“Is your room not satisfactory?” Guy asked.
Cas grinned. “Pretty much anywhere without any light pollution. Maybe down one of these gravel roads here.”
“Do you actually put butter in the rum?” Cas asked.
“What are you doing in here with Guy?” Dean practically shouted.
Cas knew he should be angry. And maybe he would be later on, but right now, he still had kind of a mellow feeling in his blood, despite his embarrassing display, so when Dean knocked on his door, Cas called out for him to come in.
“You’re a little warm,” Cas said. “We better get you back to the motel. I can’t heal you just yet because I had to smite all those werewolves, but I don’t think it’s an emergency.”
Next to him, Cas shifted, reaching into his pocket. It was dark as hell out, and the quarter moon didn’t provide enough light to get more than the shadowy contrast of Cas’ features, but Dean’s mind filled in the blanks. He heard the crinkle of soft plastic.
In all the chaos, somehow, Jack found him. The Shadow wasn’t pleased. It knew the cause of the noise was Jack, and it wasn’t inclined to do anything to assist either him or Castiel, but it held no power over him now that he had the full strength of both Chuck and Amara within him.
He was practically bouncing as he got out of the truck, but he was quiet. He wasn’t entirely sure what the boys were hunting or whether they had set an ambush or what, so he figured he had better be quiet about it as he made his way into the barn. He was human now, and vulnerable.
He went back to the kitchen and managed to find some food, and as he ate, he considered his options. He had no phone, but his truck was still in the garage, and he knew he had one of the Winchester’s unlimited credit cards in the glove box for emergencies. He could wait here for Sam and Dean to return, but he was impatient, and besides, he might be able to help them on the hunt. It was a long drive, but he figured he could make it to Ohio in about eight hours if he drove like Dean.
“You do look a little flushed. You should probably take those pants off, just to keep cool. The shirt too. You know. Just to be safe.”
It was making it so that now whenever he looked at Cas, he couldn’t think of anything else. He couldn’t bring himself to mention it to Cas, though.
” he finally came, spurting out his release onto Dean’s stomach and chest, while at the same time, the room went dark as it was suddenly filled with dark feathers that blocked the light and knocked items off the end table.
Cas groaned and covered his face. “It probably wouldn’t have been so bad, if it had just been in private, instead of in front of everyone.”
As soon as he was gone, Sam turned to Dean. “What the hell, Dean! You’re making a fool of yourself!”
“May I?” Castiel asked, and Dean nodded, so Cas began wiping Dean’s face and neck with the cloth. “We have to bring your core body temperature down,” Castiel fibbed.
“No, wait,” Dean started, but Cas held up a hand.
It was a twenty minute drive back to town. Dean had no way to stop Cas from driving his car, but as it happened, watching Cas with his hands on the wheel of his Baby was almost as exciting as the smiting had been. Probably why he hadn’t let it happen sooner, Dean figured.
Mary had fun for a bit, but she got bored quickly. When she spotted some snowboarders, she suddenly wanted to try that instead. Guy was offended, but he helped her exchange her equipment anyway. He drew the line at instructing her, though. In the end, a bunch of teenagers took her under their wing, and by Sunday afternoon she was trying out the rails in the feature park.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Mary, you need to turn that down.”
The next evening, he got his first opportunity.
“If you have to, Cas.”
let his hands rest on both of Dean’s ass cheeks, his fingers pressing in and his thumbs brushing impossibly close to his hole.
Once inside, Cas grabbed Dean by his shirt and spun him around, shoving him up against the door. Dean let out an Oof that turned into a moan. Cas was
Sam, however, did notice, and gave Dean a hard look.
“I think… maybe Cas likes me,” he stage-whispered.
“GET OUT!” Cas and Dean both shouted.
As Jack spoke, Castiel could feel his hope swelling within him. He could be human, truly human. He could stay with Dean, live a life, a
“Yeah, just, uh… my muscles are really sore. Probably from the paralysis, or whatever.”
That didn’t make even the minutest amount of sense, but Castiel wasn’t about to argue, so he got up and started unbuttoning his shirt, taking note of Dean’s wide eyes and the flush of his cheeks as he undid each button. When he tossed the shirt aside, Dean licked his lips. His eyes ran up and down Castiel’s body, and he could definitely feel the heat of it warming his skin. He rolled his shoulders experimentally, and Dean let out a soft groan.
And besides, he was almost out of false ironwort.
But he could sense the energy and agitation coming off Dean in waves the whole drive back to the motel. And when he’d made that comment about ejaculation, he wasn’t entirely certain what the response would be. But the next day, cooped up for hours in the Impala next to a man who was clearly uncomfortable, twitching and tapping his fingers, brought Cas to the realization that seeing Dean like this was pretty much better than anything else he could think of. A few more uncomfortable moments, and they’d be even.
“Oui!” he said.
Castiel didn’t know how to bring the situation up with Jack, but Jack was God, and he was in all things, and he knew anyway. It wasn’t long before he came to Castiel instead.
But he could be near Dean. He could talk to him, spend time with him.
Once back in Heaven, Castiel could feel the difference. Jack had already begun the work of tearing down the walls, releasing the human souls to a free and open world where they could interact and be happy. With Castiel’s advice, boundaries and systems were set in place to provide the human inhabitants with everything they needed to be happy. Jack set to work selecting certain human souls to be converted to angels to help sustain and protect heaven, and finally,
They arrived in the living room to find a stranger there, burdened down with bags and bags of groceries. Cas rushed to help, taking most of the bags and revealing the stranger’s face. He was… wow. He was very aesthetically pleasing. Glossy brown hair, green eyes, and a toothy grin… Cas suddenly decided to reconsider his opinion about human obsessions. This man looked like a perfect jumping off point for Cas to test out human relationships.
He took a breath, gritted his teeth, and looked at Cas.
Cas kept his eyes on Dean’s at first, but soon they drifted shut. His mouth parted, and his breath quickened. His hips jerked, and he wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist. Not stopping him, but just holding on.
“Are you his babysitter, Castiel? Dean is a
He looked around, noticing with curiosity that Dean had a half-finished job application sitting on his desk. Was he hoping to get out of hunting? The thought pleased him.
“You’re looking a little flushed. Your pupils are dilated too. Let me check if your temperature is still high.”
They watched each other another few moments, an eternity, a second, and Cas let his hand rest on Dean’s face, his thumb tracing his cheekbone, his lips. Dean crept closer and Cas let his legs tangle with Dean’s. Maybe they would kiss.
“I won a one weekend rental of a deluxe private ski lodge, complete with lessons from a former Olympic champion!”
Dean backed up so fast he fell onto the bed.
Dean was losing his mind as Cas slowly worked his way around, his fingers digging deliciously into his waist, his hips, and his thighs, then back again, avoiding his ass completely. His cock, impossibly hard, was leaking into the bedding, and he pushed back against Cas’ hands, not only to release the pressure on his aching dick, but also to encourage Cas to maybe, possibly, narrow down his focus to a somewhat smaller range.
Dean knew Cas was unlikely to sleep in this motel. Despite what people thought, he had noticed the changes in Cas the last few years. He didn’t heal as quickly. He ate a little, and slept a few hours a week, albeit only in the security of the bunker. His vessel was changing too, softening around the jaw, lines around his eyes. Dean didn’t think occupied vessels aged, but the angel part of Cas was diminishing.
He reached out a hand and placed it on Dean’s arm, and Dean almost fucking lost it. He gritted his teeth and glared at Cas, who looked at him with those stupid wide blue eyes and his stupid messy hair and his stupid fucking lips which parted just a bit and a faint little sound came out like a soft breathy “oh” and Dean suddenly decided kissing him couldn’t possibly be any worse for their relationship than punching him would be, so he just leaned forward and
“Apparently it’s like catnip. For angels.” Sam said.
Cas took it upon himself to introduce Guy around the room, finally stopping at the two brothers. “This is Sam and Dean Winchester,” Cas said.
“I’m sure. I think the closest analogy would be to the effect catnip has on cats. Completely harmless. Just a temporary good feeling.”
Mary was standing at the stove, stirring a pot with one hand and hitting herself on the ear with the other. Cas walked up beside her. She startled a bit, but relaxed with a small laugh when she saw it was him. Cas normally knew better than to sneak up on hunters, but it had been too easy the last few days with Mary’s ears. And he’d already given up on offering to heal them, there was no point in bringing it up again.
The door banged as Sam came in, carrying several suitcases, and followed by Rowena. “I don’t mind,” he was telling her, trying to keep his grip as she brushed past him and looked around.
Fuck, fuck, that was the most amazing thing Dean had ever heard.
It worked, thank fuck, and he felt his eyes rolling back into his head as Cas’ hands, currently situated at the top of his thighs, slid higher than they had to this point. Dean felt his thumbs creep down between his legs, and he let them fall open a bit as Cas pushed them apart with his thumbs.
“We were just saying goodnight,” Cas answered.
It didn’t take long to wear off. By the time Cas stopped moaning and sniffing, Sam had the baggies wrapped back up, and less than fifteen minutes had passed. He looked between the brothers and grimaced. His face was a bit red. “My apologies,” he said, with a kind of embarrassed chuckle.
Cas smiled a little, and his eyes crinkled a bit at the corners, and it was captivating. Dean looked at him for a long time, until he finally came to the realization that they had probably done this a hundred times before, just watched each other. But this was different. Like the air was charged between them. No, that wasn’t right. The air had always been charged between them.
Suddenly, like in the kitchen, he let out a deep, visceral, throaty moan, that went directly to Dean’s dick, and with a kind of soft
“Well,” Mary began. “I wasn’t sure about her at first, what with her being a witch and all. But with all the things that we’ve gone through in the last few years, I have certainly come to appreciate her.” She peered up at her son, who was looking down at her with wide, hopeful hazel eyes. Her youngest son really was such a kind boy. She wanted nothing for him but happiness. She leaned in conspiratorially. “I think she has the hots for you,” Mary said.
his wings appeared, inky black, even in the dark of the night.
Which was lasagna.
Just this once.
Just to be safe.
It was true. They hadn’t had much time off lately. Sam had been thinking something a little more tropical, rather than Colorado in February. But free lodging? He’d take it.
fully grown man, and I think he can decide for himself. Besides. Maybe I am looking for something a little more fun for once.”
Guy shrugged in a very French looking sort of way. “I don’t know. But, may I venture to say, it didn’t look like you enjoyed Rowena’s flirting very much, either.”
“I don’t think your friend Cas likes how Rowena was flirting with you,” the ski instructor said, his weird, Dick Roman-y smile sending shivers down Dean’s spine. He really didn’t understand how nobody else saw it.
And Cas looked just as scared.
Eventually, however, the sticky mess under Dean grew uncomfortable, and he moved slightly. Cas rolled off him and to the side, facing Dean. He could feel Cas watching him, and eventually he opened his eyes and looked back.
smoothly, and it reminded Dean of…
“I’d love a beer,” Mary replied. Cas rolled his eyes and reached over to turn the speakers down himself.
“I heard it from Cas,”
“I can heal that,” Cas offered. She waved her hand at him. “It’s almost better. Save your grace.”
Rowena scowled at him but stood anyway.
“It’s a bit small, but it has a nice view.”
“D-Dean!” Cas’ fingers tightened on Dean’s hip. It would bruise later, mark him, and Cas slammed into him hard, pinning him down, stiffening, as heat flooded into his ass. Dean pushed back against him, desperately, on the brink, and Cas’ hips flexed one more time, his cock slurping wetly into him, hitting his prostate and pushing him over the edge into oblivion, his body tensing and shaking as he spilled into his fist.
“What were you doing in Guy’s room?” Sam asked.
Rowena moved next to Dean and ran her finger up his arm. “I bet I could create a better view with a little magic,” she purred. Dean didn’t reply, but he did shoot a glare at Sam.
beds.”
Nobody ever said Dean was a nice guy. Or that he was above pulling a prank every now and then. So nobody could get mad at him if he played a little joke on Cas, especially after all the shit they’d been through. After all, they were family. And if he wouldn’t hesitate to pull something like this on Sammy, given the opportunity, then nothing should stop him from pulling something like this on Cas, right?
“You’re pretty handy at that,” Cas said. “A chef, and a ski champion? You’re very accomplished.”
“Jack seemed to like it.” Sam sniffed it again. It just smelled like faintly stale mint.
Maybe it was easier this way. To pretend that this wasn’t what it was, to leave it unacknowledged. If they addressed it, then things might change, but if they just pretended, then it wasn’t anything. Nothing important. Nothing that could come between them.
“How are you feeling?”
Walking up the bathroom door, he began what he’d been wanting to say for what seemed like his whole life.
Sam eventually managed to summon his ghost, but he was still a bit pissy about the whole thing, so when a case involving a possible vampire popped up in Minnesota, Dean let him stay behind and grabbed Cas instead, and they drove the eight hours to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. They checked into a motel, and set about the business of tracking down the nest.
Mary cut him off. “It’s definitely not your imagination. He tries to hide it, but everyone pretty much knows. Well, almost everyone.” She laughed. “From what I understand, he’s felt like this for years. I keep trying to tell him, though, that if he thinks it will make him happy, he should just go for it.”
“Are you sure?” Cas asked.
When everyone arrived, he directed Cas to sit on the end where the blanket was. Sam took the other end, with Jack in the middle, and Dean took the armchair and started the movie.
Cas looked up as Dean came in. He was on the phone, with Garth, Cas guessed. “Mom, can you turn that down? I can’t hear.”
“Dean, you don’t have to worry. Your family seems very accepting. It’s okay to admit your orientation. I think they all know anyway. Your mother told me.”
Satisfied, he picked up his dish and stated that he was going to eat it alone in his room. He tried not to laugh at the sputtering sounds that came out of Dean’s as he walked away.
Rowena appeared at his side. “I’m pretty sure that’s the only one you’ll need,” she said.
Ugh, this was hard. At least the website autofilled suggestions. Blearily, he scrolled through the list. Finally, he found it. False Ironwort. Awesome.
Dean followed Guy down the stairs to his room, where he opened the door and stepped inside, flicking on the light.
“I love that sound you make,” Dean said against Cas’ mouth. He felt his lips curl into a grin.
Dean looked puzzled for a minute. He rolled his eyes around in his head for a moment, trying to remember, and Sam sighed in exasperation. Finally he remembered. “Oh, the thing, with the thing. With the plant website. Yeah, I ordered it.”
Mary didn’t seem to have heard him. Cas decided to go back to the living room and wait until it was ready.
With that in mind, Castiel headed into the bathroom to retrieve a washcloth, which he dampened with cool water and brought back to Dean. He only hesitated a moment before he sat down next to Dean on the edge of the bed.
Of course, that meant Dean was a tiny bit distracted while the ghost tried to defend its bones, and it swooshed right through him just as he dropped the matches in the grave. It wasn’t able to save itself, but it did disable Dean temporarily.
As he watched Cas drive, his fingers wrapped around the leather of the steering wheel, Dean became aware that control was gradually returning to his body. First his fingers and his toes, then his legs and arms, then his torso, thank god, because he was a little uncomfortable and needed to shift a bit because the left side of his ass was starting to ache. Then, just as they pulled into their parking spot at the motel, he was able to move his face. By the time Cas stopped the engine and came around to the passenger side, Dean was already getting out. “‘M fine, Cassh,” Dean said, only slightly slurring. “I can walg.”
Rowena had brought very aerodynamic skiing clothes with her, and looked stunning with her fur lined satin coat. However, under no circumstances would she leave the lodge. Instead, she sat by the fire and let handsome young men buy her drinks. Sam considered dragging her outside and tossing her into a snowbank, but since she had actually made it into his room the second night, he didn’t want to jeopardize that.
“Hey!” Guy said. “You’re not the Winchester I want! Where is Dean?”
“Dean,” Sam warned, but he didn’t get any further. Suddenly, Cas let out a loud moan, and then without warning, it was like an explosion went off, and the kitchen was full of black feathers.
“Well. That sounds like a start, then.”
Castiel ran the cloth down the length of Dean’s spine, then back up to his neck, slowly. Down again, on the right side, then back up the left, then down the middle again, a little lower this time, nudging the waistband of his underwear down a little. Dean let out a groan.
