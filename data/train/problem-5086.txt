“No way!” she returns. Peter groans in frustration, his eyes meeting Harry’s, who just seems amused. It’s obvious that the guy knows exactly what kind of role Felicia has been playing in Peter’s life in the past few weeks.
“Come on, let’s get you inside. We’ll explain everything to Tony and maybe he can help us getting you home.”
“Everybody’s at home, it’s ten in the evening,” Gwen explains when she sees Peter look around in confusion. “And the Avengers are in the common room, I expect. But I’m sure we can find Tony in the lab.”
Of course, there’s always a thorough background check for every kid that has come in there so far, and of all the twenty that have asked for a scholarship, he’s only had to refuse three of them who quite obviously came from wealthy enough descend to pay for the education themselves. Tony’s not an idiot, and he’s aware that most parents just tell their kids to try it, but there are certain rules to it that even he has to follow, no matter how much he might like said kid’s attitude.
“I didn’t! I got someone chasing after me, but I saw you two holding out your hands like idiots so I figured you could use the drive. Come, come and follow me into my absolutely safe adventure. If you’re lucky, you might get to see an angry mutated wolverine, but don’t worry, he’s almost harmless!”
“And this Peter, what is he like?” Steve asked curiously, probably to make sure Yaël hadn’t befriended two psychos.
“What, no, you can’t leave it here?” Peter calls out in middle of his class, earning him a detention after that and the confiscation of his journal until the end of the day. Still, the journal is empty after this one; no more notes are written. This is it; the last thing she wrote down before she died.
“I don’t have a death-stare?” Steve asks, frowning with a slight grin on his lips. Peter copies him, feeling the light air going on here.
“Uh uh uh!” Tony suddenly starts, holding out a finger with red all over his face. As he marches towards Peter, Steve pushes himself off the counter to get to his partner. “You’re not talking this time.”
Tony snorts, but there’s no humor in it. He can only laugh at the idiocy in this whole situation. It suddenly sounds so simple, and for a moment Tony regrets not taking Peter along and inviting Steve to come. Right now, he doesn’t care about his own well-being. He just wants his son to get another chance at seeing Steve again.
“Did you mean it?” he then asks quietly right before Steve can walk away. The super soldier stops in his tracks before turning around, eyes full of confusion. “When you told me you love me. Did you mean it?”
“Okay, I would say you’ve lost me but I wasn’t really ever following. What are you nerds on about?” Natasha pulls James’ head back again after he’s been leaning forward to point at Sam. James follows suit, leaning his back against Natasha’s legs.
The next person he sees is Mr. Toomes himself, sporting a bruised cheek and black eye. The moment he sees Peter, he grins widely.
After a friendly discussion over favorite Avatar-characters (Wade fanboyed over Toph, while Yaël admired Zuko) and some sandwiches, Yaël kicked the guy out. She jumped into her moldy shower, tried to brush her hair, cleaned her teeth and planted herself face-down in bed. She fell asleep like that for a few minutes, woke up with a sore neck and then dug herself under the blanket.
Now completely awake on this Saturday morning, Peter searches for his phone to check the time, seeing that it’s eight in the morning. He didn’t particularly sleep in, but it’s also not like he went to sleep late. Or did he? He can’t even remember if they finished the movie…
I have yet to watch Infinity War (tomorrow), but I'm glad I got to finish the story before I went to see it. Sadly, I didn't get to make my own two deadlines (being the 25th and the 27th) due to my lack of realization that I work in a hospital and don't have the freaking time to write as much as in the weekends!
These kind of answers make Steve go silent.  He starts bringing a notebook and a pencil sharpener.  He collects all of the pieces of pencils around the shop and sharpens them over the waste bin.  He then sticks his face in his college-ruled spiral and starts scribbling.
The mechanic stills in Steve’s arms.  He commits Peter’s sad figure and heavy words to memory before he gathers himself and takes Steve’s face in his hands, kissing him delicately on the cheek.
Steve kept his gaze, expression softening as he reached forward with a wavering hand and rubbed his teammate’s back.
He had done this before with the not-real Steve.  Generally it was in a moment of desperation when Tony was at his worst and allowed himself to give into his fantasies.  But he never imagined his first kiss quite right. He never felt the hesitation before the heat took over and
“Believe me, I have been trying to get him to go on dates for years. I would ask you for suggestions, but I know your flings pre-Iron Man were destructive in nature and Pepper has been your gal ever since. You two still on hiatus?”
“A lot has changed on the outside while you've been here living pretty with Steve. The helicarriers would probably be the least of my problems.
“And since this was a code green, Banner won’t be around anytime soon.”  Tony looks up at the ceiling before leveling his gaze with his leader.
He expects he's freezing, but his skin feels hot against his busted suit.  He loses another few hours after he manages to roll over on his side and vomit.
“I-I’m not afraid to hit you, old man.”  Tony feels his dick tremor again as Steve brings his soiled hand up to his mouth and starts to lick up his mess.
The lieutenant colonel disappears back up the stairs.  Tony looks down at the open arc reactor on his work table, then down to his dirty hands and ripped sweatpants.  He also notices the tear in his jacket where his nanobots previously held his guts in place. Now a thick layer of gauze covers the wound, shaded in a crusty maroon hue.
Tony only manages to nod before an intricate green circle encircles Strange’s wrist and twists.  Tony loses his grip on Steve. His mind reels and a memory of fallen allies surrounds him, Peter’s crumbling body now among those few friends.
“Okay, seriously, I hate magic.  Are you two here just to do our job and shame us?  And this scruffy looking nerf herder bit you got going is great, but it’s definitely no Captain America pinup.” Stark gives Steve a wary look before he reaches for Tony's arc reactor with wonder.
“Maybe whatever the younger one planned to hit Vision with rebounded.  They seemed determined to give him some sort of sexual identity.”
New York is a shit show. The post-Loki repairs are in order, and Tony is just glad all the mess of the battle left his workshop at Stark Tower intact. Once he sets orders to begin Damage Control, Tony descends to his haven and takes residence at his workbench as he begins to mentally prioritize all of the necessary updates for the Iron Man suit.
I'll give you the wedding! It's going to be there in a timestamp! I just didn't really want to write it down in either Tony's or Peter's POV. But I promise you, you'll all get the wedding even the Guardians of the Galaxy travelled across the Galaxy for!
There’s nothing much on, really. The news doesn’t have much to announce, and the weather forecast can only say that they can expect snow tomorrow. After coming to a full loop of changing the channels, they just turn off the TV and take out their cellphones.
Before realizing it, Tony throws the blankets off and jumps out of the bed with a speed he didn’t know he had. By the time he’s in the hallway, he sees Nat and Wanda already heading towards the bathroom with their towels in hand. Sam is carrying some things out of the Quinjet, and Clint is popping open a beer.
“Uh, apparently I had been the Hulk ever since the Ultron-business. They used me as a gladiator of sorts. Thor and the Hulk had fought in a battle, but I don’t really know how that ended. We both survived at least.”
Hilde lives in the Compound, mostly lacking any other place to live, though she has been thinking about returning to New Asgard to help with the construction of the city, rejoining Thor and Jane back there.
“Dude, look at me,” she said as she pointed at her breasts. “These two are almost falling out of there. It’s way too tight!”
Yaël’s proud face fell down when she saw a woman walking in. She looked like a female body builder in full armour. Her hair was pulled back in a firm knot, which made her look even more sternly. So, Yaël obviously failed at picking open the lock.
“I must say, I was quite shocked to hear she was suddenly staying here. Did something go wrong?” X stopped in front of the door.
“Aw, well, thank you!” Yaël huffed as she full-force kicked one down and immediately planted her sword into its chest.
“Are you alright, dear?” Susan asks next to him as Peter shifts in his seat nervously again. Peter turns his head, looking right into the woman’s blue eyes. She’s put up her blonde hair into a high ponytail. She’s dressed in normal clothing, so Peter can easily catch the wedding ring on her left hand.
“Uncle Steve, huh?” Tony returns, smirking a bit at Steve. It disappears again the moment he sees Steve’s sad look. Then Tony stands up, making his way to Steve’s couch and sitting down next to him.
Id-Jit rolls up to Tony, holding up a framed picture that must have fallen along on the ground when he cleared the desk. He pulls his legs back, reaching for the frame and taking it from the bot’s simple claw. A short look at the picture of him and Peter in Disneyland makes something well up in his throat. It had been such a good day, the two of them careless and unknowing of everything that was waiting ahead of them.
“Call an ambulance,” he starts after a few seconds of thinking. “Tell them what happened, and to be as discreet as possible. Give them instructions to go through the garage, and take them through the private elevators – you know which one. Then after that, call Pepper, let her know what happened and let her prepare herself for the possible press they might get. You can try and keep this completely anonymous, but there’s always a chance that somebody will find out.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t say anything sooner. I thought it was just another common cold,” he apologizes. Tony shakes his head.
“Uh-,” Peter gets out, feeling the air escape his lungs. The man in front of him – Steve Rogers, Peter reminds himself, since he’s not in uniform right now – just chuckles as he leans against the door.
Peter remembers vividly shooting out his web, seeing how it reaches her slowly, but not fast enough. She falls down more quickly than the web goes. But eventually, it does make contact, and Peter pulls up.
, but I kind of need some proof for it, you understand?” he stumbles out. Dr. Cho doesn’t look up, instead removing the ninth shard.
“There’s been a bombing caused by multiple robots in the streets somewhere near Corona,” Tony explains as he sees it all happen. “They look like Doom’s work.”
"Language," Steve said dryly as he reached his hand to her to help her up. Yaël took his hand and stumbled back to her feet. "What were you doing?" he asked her with a firm face.
“How- this could never be a mistake!” Steve counters quickly. He jumps up as well, grabbing Tony by the shoulders to turn him around. Tony keeps his gaze lowered as he zips up his pants. “Tony, don’t tell me you actually feel what we did is wrong?”
He wants to speak, but his throat is hoarse and hurts when he tries. Instead, he tries to swallow and shakes his head.
Tony shudders visibly. Steve looks at him sadly before pulling him into his arms, into a strong embrace. Kissing him on the head, his eyes meet the others.
EDIT: After some long thinking, Caspinn and I have decided to change the story up a bit so it can be compliant with Infinity War. A couple of parts will be edited in this story, and the timestamp that has been posted on the matter will no longer be relevant. You can still read it in case you want some angst, but it will no longer be completely compliant to the story! (Not everything will be different, otherwise I would have to change this entire story as well. Just, a lot of things).
His reaction upon seeing the pizzeria in front of him in what must be a very familiar hallway is priceless. Steve has his mouth fallen open, eyes open wide, as he stares at the windows he recognizes, along with the name of the place, the little flowers drawn with an artistic hand against the door, where now a plate is put up with ‘PUSH’ written on it.
He rolls his eyes, trying to ignore it. But as it is, it’s all around him. People making out in the middle of the street. Magazines, posters, books. The movies, TV-shows… It always over-glorifies it in a way that Peter would never really comprehend…
Because, in the end, Tony still hurt Steve, punched him in every way possible. Out of anger. It never should have happened. Another reminder that he’s, in fact, worse than his own Dad.
Peter shoots up, already on his way out when suddenly he stops in his tracks. Then, without saying anything, he pulls out his wallet, opens it up, and takes the small glass test-tube he’s taken to always carry around with him.
Johnny has no concept of personal space. He comes up to Peter, hugs him and barely even lets him go while he starts telling him with a large slur how he’s so glad Peter wants to hang out with him, or how he’s just ready to change up his life and make something out of it. Peter tries not to think too much about it.
“What, did somebody step on your toes, Wolfie?” Tony asks jokingly. Logan turns around, throwing him a wicked grin that makes Tony realize he should probably have kept his mouth shut. But, ah, he’s always known for running his mouth. It’s a talent, he supposes.
“Me? Uh, not really. Ned has stuff to do, and I don’t really have any other friends available or that I want to hang out with,” Peter shrugs, clearly meaning Wade with the last one. Tony then looks up, unimpressed. “Oh, you mean-? Uh, yeah, maybe? I always have the suit with me, so…”
When they get to the vows, Steve had forgotten about the fact that Thor’s speech is close to eleven minutes long. He feels a bit guilty that he didn’t warn him more about it, but Thor’s just very stubborn.
“When I was about your age, I could still walk, Yaël. Now tell me how you are?” he always sounded so kindly even when he had to ask her the same question twice.
“Because I have a son who lives here, with his Aunt,” Tony says, looking a bit sad despite his smile. “I hoped I could see him tonight before I had to leave again, but he wasn’t home.”
“Yeah, no shit, if you slip out that small bit about having a teenager in the house. No wonder they’re trying to get some bit of information.”
Steve gives him a long look. “You really love the other me, don’t you?” he asks. Tony bites his lips together, but doesn’t respond. Because he does, he does love Steve so much. But his behavior in the past few months, the way he dealt with the aftermath of the Infinity War… Tony said some things that he shouldn’t have. It’s his own fault that he pushed Steve away to New Asgard.
“Oh, sorry,” Tony returns. He sits up again, not keeping his eyes from Steve as the guy sits up a bit. As Steve observes what happened, Tony tries to get an outside look. He taps into a nearby camera going live, and looks at the feed currently being broadcasted.
“Your Uncle never died, Peter. Though it was a close call. He got a heart-attack the day the police came to tell them you had died. It’s only lucky that he made it.”
Tony shakes his head. “You can’t ask that of me,” he whispers out. “I would never put anything before you.”
Huh, Peter never really thought of it that way… Would he really be next in line to inherit his father’s company when he’s older? He doesn’t even want to think about that. He’s not a business-man, and he wouldn’t really care about all that money.
“You question my memory?” Thor asks with a frown. Steve drops the papers back on the desk and holds up his hands in defeat.
“I’m being a good friend,” Steve returned, unimpressed by Tony’s words. Once the elevator stopped at Tony’s floor, Steve pushed the chair forward again. Tony threw his head back, looking up at Steve from underneath him.
“I think that might be for the best, for now,” Natasha assures him. She leans forward to squeeze into his hand. He doesn’t react to it.
Karen says in his ear. Peter can’t even respond to stop the command. Meanwhile, Strange walks down to where Bruce is now standing, giving him a once-over. Peter hums, and makes other loud noises if his mouth can’t be opened, but Strange doesn’t let go.
“Alt bra? Wow, detteermoro!” Wade answered her ‘How are you? Wow, this is fun!’ in fluent Norwegian. How did he even…?
“Oh, and what may that be?” Yaël crossed her arms. She had decided this Grandmaster wasn’t a friend of hers.
They’re good at it; calling, pretending to be happy, like there’s nothing wrong at all. It’s frustrating in every possible way. Just the day before, he got scolded for ignoring Cap’s orders, got kicked off the team before he even got to be part of it. And yesterday he could bite through it and stay with his injured Dad. Now, being Spider-Man but without a mission, he feels angry.
“Pep, honey, sweetheart, light of my life… Can you just not today?” Tony groans. When he opens his eyes again, he can see said woman standing there with her hands on her hips, along with Rhodey who is just looking at him sadly.
“Okay, I’m sure that’s gonna end up great,” he offers a bit in sarcasm. Wanda giggles, and Vision shrugs. “Actually, I’m a bit surprised Steve would even agree to this, even. Maybe dad’s rubbing off on him.”
She dialed Fury’s number and started raging as soon as she heard the cracking of someone picking up.
“Miss?” the man frowned a bit, he looked worried. Why wouldn’t Yaël be alright? As she tried to nod, the girl noticed that she suddenly couldn’t move anymore. She forgot about the house, the man and the woods for a moment. What the hell?!
What? Peter jumps up to take a look at the screen, frowning immediately when he sees what Ned is talking about.
Peter waves at the rest of the team, smiling back at Wanda who winks at him. Once most of the people are outside, Peter feels like there’s a whole lot more air to breathe in here. Tony looks less tense, as well. Especially now that Steve is standing behind him, his hands on Tony’s shoulder.
“No way!” he calls out, yanking the box out of the bag and looking it over. There it is, the newest phone with 1TB of storage memory, a killer camera and to put it shortly just the fastest thing out there so far.
“Why would I braid your hair?” she asked him casually while following. He was walking towards the little house where he walked out a while ago when she dreamt like this.
Yaël sat down and gave Steve his glass. It was quiet for a moment as he stared at her. Not in a creepy way, but it was clear that he was looking for answers.
“We weren’t finished training,but… that doesn’t matter now,” Professor X turned his wheelchair towardsYaël “What does matter is that we can’t give you too much information about before you lost your memories. The doctors said that remembering things too quickly could cause trauma.”
“Thank you, Sharon,” Tony mutters against her shoulder. Then, he pulls back, putting his hand on Peter’s shoulder while using the other one to rub the tears away from his face. “This, uh… this is my son, Peter.”
Right, Yaël was dreaming, she reminded herself. This wasn’t real. She was curious though… what was the man reading? She stared at the book, hoping that the guy would move his book so she could read the front.
Horrified, out of breath and with a heart beating too fast, Tony looks up at Steve, who seems equally shocked by what just happened. Then, Steve pulls the shield away, throwing it to the side and leaning down onto his elbows as he tries to catch his breath.
“ANTHONY EDWARD STARK!” somebody shouts in the background. Tony flinches upon hearing it, not used to having his full name spoken out in such a manner. Normally, it meant that he got trouble from his own Dad.
a voice says, seeming to come from the ceiling. Peter has heard of FRIDAY, so he’s not too worried about the sudden appearance of the voice.
He could wall-crawl to Bruce’s floor, take the elevator from there on. Then the two here won’t see him leave, and he won’t have to swing his way away. Crawling down the entire tower would take too long, especially with Peter’s ribs aching like this.
“Hey asshole!” he hears somewhere in the back. Peter’s vision is still too dark to see anything, but he would recognize that voice everywhere! He rubs at his eyes, noticing that he’s lost the mask somewhere in the process. Shit, he needs to find it again! Meanwhile, there’s the sound of fighting in the background. A small explosion, somebody crashing against something.
The next morning, Yaël got a call from Diego with the message that if she didn't show up today, she'd be fired. In compensation, she worked a lot of extra hours in the following few days. On Friday, when she finally got home, she took a shower and put her pajamas on along with her fluffy socks. Once seated on the couch she received a text from Wade. A bit ashamed for not texting him earlier, due to her long working days, she opened it.
She signed at the black-haired man to follow her, using her one hand to follow the walls and the other to pull the cord with which Lopt’s hands were bound. After the next corner had to be the huge, wooden doors with two guards in front of them. As soon as the guards saw them, they raised their elements just out of precaution. Yaël heard one’s air turning like wind and the other one’s steered fire crackle.
“He cut his hand on a broken bottle I think.” Peter takes bloodied hand and lifts it up to remove the bloodied tissue. It sticks everywhere, and Peter gets blood all over his fingers as he takes it off. The bleeding seems to have stopped for now, so that counts at least for something.
Peter thinks back on Yaël, the day that Wade brought her to the compound, appearing broken and lost. As he explained it, Wade accidentally blew her place up, throwing the girl out of the building due to the explosion. She hadn’t been found until late in the evening the day afterwards, and she’s been living at the compound ever since.
He knows that Tony had to keep himself from laughing when he, too, got a look at it. In full embarrassment, Peter had admitted that he got drunk the evening before – which already earned him a scowl from Tony and an added warning from FRIDAY, who says that the reason he’s been feeling so horrible is probably because of the combination of his pills and the alcohol – and explained how one of the girls manipulated him into dancing in drag like that.
Dr. Strange has changed a lot since the last time Peter saw him. It probably starts with the clothes. Since when does the man, the Neurosurgeon of the year, wear a cape? And orange gloves? What the hell is this, even?
Steve asks. Peter nods and gets off his chair, resting his hands back in the pockets of his hoodie as he starts walking towards the door. He knows he’s looking like he’s up to no good if he’s walking around like this, but people know him by now.
Okay, yes, he was the one and only Spider-Man, which isn’t normal at all, but he was also just a normal teenager with normal problems. He wasn’t arrogant for being some kind of superhero, or for being over-intellectual.
“I’m here now, and why don’t you sit down?” he asked her calmly as he signed to her sofa. What did you see? You can tell me. Yaël heard X’s voice in her head as soon as she sat down. She jumped a little, she forgot he did that.
Hesitantly, Steve gets up, his hand coming to rest on Tony’s shoulder to guide him up as well. May stays seated the longest, only getting up when Tony and Steve are almost through the door. They don’t go too far away, keeping the door open while they gather together in the hallway.
“About how you became who you are today? Wade says it’s quite a lot, and I’m finding myself curious, to be honest.”
Tony gives Rhodey a wink before he closes the box with the suitcase in it, lets the armor surround him once more, and flies up in the air.
“If he’s anything like you, I don’t doubt that,” she returns. “Listen, Tony. Again, I didn’t mean to insinuate that you only care about Peter; it’s normal, you’re his dad after all.”
“It’s not like I’m on the field, anyway…” That was what bothered her the most. She wasn’t even an Avenger, she was nothing but a freaking mosquito who accidentally got stuck in the maze called the accords. “The only reason I wouldn’t sign is because Steve isn’t.” She should chose her words more carefully with topics like these, because immidiatly after she said that, everyone looked at her a bit strangely. Great.
When he washes his hands, Peter takes a good look at the person he sees in front of him, actually a bit surprised at the weight he’s gained again. In comparison to how he’s been back in September, it’s a good difference.
While jumping to pull up her pants, she stumbled over her alarm clock. How much time did she have left before she had to leave for work? Oh, it was around seven am, so she still had an hour, good!
As Peter is hanging there in the air, he quickly thinks back of his phone-call with Mr. Stark. However short it had been, Peter could have sworn it sounded like the guy was flying. Is it possible that he was in pursuit for the Goblin, and tried to get Peter away from the roof to make sure he was safe?
He’s aware of the others looking at him in a worry. He knows they’re shocked at his sudden lack of hearing them. But Peter can’t think about that. Everybody’s alive. Venom’s gone. Peter’s fine.
Yaël opened her eyes and stood in the familiar forest once again. Okay, so she fell asleep, oops. She’d surely have a sore neck the next morning from sleeping in the sofa.
“Maybe he just…doesn’t want to meet you.” Auch, why the hell would somebody just reject her like that without giving her a chance? Unless…she once got a chance?
Wow, he really wasn’t expecting this; Steve Rogers and Yaël? Together? He wouldn’t have expected it from the Captain, really. But then again, what does he know about the man?
“Don’t, the painkillers only work for five minutes,” Steve quickly warned him. He tried to sit up for a bit, clearing his throat. Despite the serum, it still hurts a bit due to being intubated during surgery. He still can’t believe it; he’s had surgery… He wouldn’t have thought that possible, really.
Tony nods, trying to sit up a bit. “There’s, uh, the emergency lever to manually override the suit. I can’t…”
“I got an automatic message from Mary,” Tony admits, figuring it’s best to get it all out at once. Steve frowns a bit, stopping the movement from his hand for a few seconds before resuming. Then he nods.
“I got them off your back, don’t ask me how. They’re just grateful that you got the man, and they don’t want you to sign. Not yet, at least,” Tony assures him. He taps his watch two times, and suddenly the pillar opens up. There, a shiny, new suit lights up. Peter’s mouth falls open, because this… this isn’t-? Wait, what?
“I’m already on it. Trying to track him down for a bit, see if he has any patterns he follows. So far, my deduction is that he still goes to school.” Tony’s finger goes up, poking Steve on his chin. Steve slaps his hand away, but Tony just started to snort and poked him even more. “You know, you would look pretty hot with a beard.”
After a while, there's a door opening further away. Peter turns his head to the side, but he can't see anybody yet. It must come from the hallway.
“Lie with me for a few minutes, alright?” Steve asks. “Take a breather, and after that we’ll search for the woman.”
“For crying out loud, Stevie, who takes it up the ass?” James suddenly asks. Steve’s whole posture changes after that. He stands still, eyes wide and mouth fallen open. As if it’s just a picture of Steve standing in front of them, he’s unmoving.
Tony smiles, taking it from his son’s hands with a thankful nod. With his hands now freed from both their grasps, it’s easier to move around again. But, before he can turn the tablet on, he drops it on his legs, pulls down the blanket and takes a good look at his stomach.
“I didn’t take it off for the entire evening,” Peter mutters, recalling how happy he’d been to finally have the chance to see the expo. Of course, he had been a bit disappointed, as well, after walking around there the entire day but not coming across his favorite hero.
Tony frowns, he wants to ask what happened. When he tries to think of what he remembers last, it’s mostly blurry. He’s aware that he’s in the same room he’s been in for the past few days. When he looks outside, he sees that it’s raining. He’s surrounded by doctors, none of which he can really tell by name – Dr. Palmer handed his case to the specialists, so he hasn’t seen her in… he doesn’t even know.
“Who do we have here? Care to join us in the next match, mini-Stark?” Clint jokes without removing his eyes from the screen. Peter, who has just entered the room with a bag of chips in his hands.
Johnny snorts but jumps up from the table. “He thinks I’m pretty,” he jokes. Then he nods towards Peter. “We should hang out once or twice.”
“Oh, jeez, Wade, please shut up for a second,” Yaël opened her eyes and turned to him with a wide grin. Next to her bed, professor X sighed.
Tony and Bruce did their computer-business. Steve, Clint, Natasha and Thor worked out in the gym, trying out the newest equipment Tony made them. There were some moments where Bruce would join them for lunch or dinner, and there were occasions where some of them would help out the two geniuses as much as they could, but frankly the only one with a bit of skill in that department was Natasha.
“We’re coming!” he returns. He can see Shuri say something, snickering as a result. Peter looks embarrassed, punching her (gently) on the arm and hissing something in return. It’s fun to see them joking around like this; it’s a complete opposite sight of the Peter they’ve had in the house for the past week.
Peter rolls his eyes. “That’s what you say every meeting,” he states. Tony then just shrugs. “Anyway, drive safely, alright?”
He’s been asleep for only about an hour or two. To be honest, the moment he reached Tony on the phone, he’d been trying to talk things through, to get everything out. But then Tony hung up, and Steve kept trying again and again. Around three he decided it was no use, so he gave up.
Then she walked back to her sink and put her hands in the water to test if it wasn’t too hot. She frowned. “You have to be shitting me!” she growled. The water was still cold. Yaël ran to the shower and tested the water there. Cold. Oh, she was so going to call Fury! She had to call him anyways to hear if she finally could contact Steve, because she still got no news from X nor Fury about that.
And when he did, stupid as he was, he used it to teach Flash a lesson – causing for him to break the basketball ring, and earning himself community service. Uncle Ben was pissed – but not pissed enough to stop embarrassing Peter when Gwen came along to ask if he was expelled.
“Hey, buddy,” he says in return. Then he looks down at the suit. It’s no longer green, now, Peter realizes. The suit is completely black, with hints of blue on certain parts at his arms and hands. “Like the new look? Your dad made it a while back, but I’ve always refused to wear it.”
Eddie snorts, the mask disappearing from his face again. It looks horrible, the murder that’s suddenly come in Eddie’s eyes. Peter can’t for the life of him figure out where it even comes from. He’s never had much trouble with the guy in the past, right? Sure he was almost always a part of Flash’ bullying party, but he never particularly addressed Peter on any occasion has he?
“You guys really do that, don’t you? Using sex as leverage?” he asks playfully. Steve’s cheeks then turn red, even more embarrassed than earlier. “Peter, your dads are adorable.”
Yeah, despite the heavy toll the war against Thanos has had on the whole gang, it seems like they’re more alive than ever now. Peter smiles as he sits in the common room of the Compound. Scott and Clint are racing each other on Mario Karts, while Bucky and Sam are cheering on for them on the couch next to them. Natasha has found a comfort in baking pies and cakes, which is where she suddenly spends all of her time in. She even offered to make Peter some stuff for the little party, and while Peter has assured her that she doesn’t have to do it, she’s still busying herself in the kitchen with Vision helping her out. Hilde, Hope and Wanda are playing cards, while Bruce is watching and offering his ideas to the group.
“Please, Steve. I know you love each other. And I know it’s been hard on you to realize that this world doesn’t
that gets hurt. It’s the people around him. In the background, he can hear the guard cracking his knuckles. Peter tries to dim away the sound, not really enjoying the sound of bones cracking. He’s heard enough of that, already.
Happy rolls his eyes and walks back, reaching out to a door knob and heading into a room which Peter thought was just a closet. Gesturing him inside, Peter realizes it’s a whole other part of the room, almost three times the size of Peter’s own bedroom at the apartment.
“Crap,” he mutters. He looks up, shooting up two webs into the air, and pulling himself away from the people surrounding him. Countless thoughts are going into his head while he swings, but he can’t really seem to focus on one in particular.
“I’m afraid he is,” Johnny says apologetic. Tony looks down at the small child, their eyes meeting and not letting go. Then little Peter puts his hands on Tony’s cheeks, and starts giggling.
Tony snorts, amused by her cheerfulness. “Yeah, well, Steve kept on pushing my worries into my face and I was tired of assuring him that I didn’t blame him…” Tony scratches his head while he takes a deep breath. Nakia, T’Challa and Rhodey give him a long look while they wait for him to continue. “I just… needed him out of here before I started blaming him anyway.”
Yaël shrugged, she had no problem with this subject. She had her needs, but did that mean that she had to be in a relationshit-uh-ship? She knew it would sound weird if she’d tell it to Peter like this, like she was some sort of slut. Weird or was she raised to never be loved? She grew up on a planet where every man knew that she was banished, where everyone looked at her like she was the devil himself. Yaël was supposed to never get kids, let alone a husband.
“Oh, right,” Steve says, pulling his hand away. Tony copies him, letting his gauntlet surround his hand once again. Then he puts the helmet back up. “Lead the way, Bucky.”
Tony holds up his thumb again, and after that the hosts head back out once more. After that, the team works on them for a few minutes more before they’re released from the chairs. They’re guided away by the wardrobe-team. Tony can’t help but snort the moment he sees his uniform. He hasn’t tried it on, yet, and he knows he’s going to look extremely ridiculous, but… it’s worth it.
MJ drops her fork and her bottle after that, and her eyes open up wide. Peter notices a small blush appearing on her cheeks. Is she- is she flustered? He’s never seen her react this way, it’s weird. It would assume that she’s an actual human being with emotions.
Wanda and Sam feel like Steve’s not where he’s supposed to be. Steve wants to shout it out when he hears their hesitation on it all, but the three of them agree that they can’t just ignore T’Challa’s wishes and storm off without a warning. Besides, they have no plane to fly.
“You- I’m sorry, you’re going to… what?” Steve had asked, wiping a tear away. His smile quickly disappeared when he saw the dry look Natasha was giving him. One that could indicate that she was messing with him, but might as well mean that she was ready to kill him on the spot.
see the answer inside Tony’s head, neither of them has thought to ask me,” Wanda says with a playful grin on her face. Natasha and Vision give her a long look before bursting out laughing.
“So, what are they both annoyed about?” Yaël heard Scott ask Charles. Like she couldn’t hear them, idiots. Steve’s fist flew to her direction and because of the distraction, Yaël dodged it almost too late. They had been training for two hours now.
As Flash speaks, his friends start laughing. He hears some hands clap together in high fives, and Peter feels his cheek redden. When he tries to stand up, there’s a sudden foot resting on his chest, keeping him down.
Steve lets out a long breath, but then closes his eyes and lowers his head. He nods. T’Challa smiles again.
When X visited her to help her out with the dream, she had been cleaning all day, trying not to scratch her own hand open. So Yaël needed to distract herself. After pulling off her socks too, she started walking around in the room, barefoot on the cold tiles. While walking around, she picked up a magazine and started looking at pretty clothes.
“I-I- he was my b-best fr-friend,” Peter stutters out, stumbling over his words. “H-he’s one of the only p-people I’ve got left from w-when I was a k-kid. I don’t want t-to lose him, too.”
When the phone suddenly starts ringing, he startles, pulling his hand back just a tiny bit. On the screen, a number appears, but one unfamiliar to Tony. Not a lot of people have Tony’s personal number, so he wonders if this could be a mistake? Carefully, Tony takes the phone, and presses the ‘answer’ button.
“People do them all the time!” Peter counters, realizing his breathing heavily from the sudden nerves.
“What do you mean; he had a panic attack?” Yaël was walking home from work when Wanda called . “Did he forget his meds?”
“Sick love, yo,” Yaël answered dryly. It didn’t happen a lot, but sometimes the teenagers got into each other’s hairs and dealing with angry, moody, hormonal, teenage mutants wasn’t always that easy. Most of the time it was X who calmed them down, sometimes by forcing their brains of course.
In front of him sits Wanda; she’s still looking pale, sitting close to a man she’s never met in her life. Tony wonders if she knows the crap this man has pulled towards Bruce, but he figures she doesn’t. Nobody in this room really seems to be aware of it; Bruce never spoke of it, and Tony never mentioned it before. In truth, when he learned that the one and only Thunderbolt Ross ended up being Secretary of State, he’d been a bit surprised.
Yeah, a lot of people know the lyrics. The ones who do sings along with it. Tony pretends to throw his shield away, supposedly ‘losing’ his balance and tripping forward to that VIP deck. Once he gets to where Steve is seated, he goes to sit down on his lap, throwing another hand over his shoulder and holding the shield up to their faces while he kisses him on the mouth. After that he jumps back on his feet.
“Man, that was the longest meeting I’ve ever had the displeasure of attending,” she muttered out. When she suddenly noticed Steve and Natasha standing there, practically holding hands, she let out a little ‘oh’-sound. “I’m sorry, I must have gone off the wrong floor?”
“Oh no,” Peter groaned, his cheeks turned red once again. He had clearly been trying to avoid that subject, but unlucky for him, Yaël wasn’t quickly ashamed of these kinds of conversations and she felt like she just had to clear this ‘unspoken’ thing out, or they’d both be thinking and asking themselves questions about it for the rest of their life.
Harry then winks at the teacher and hurries to the empty seat next to Peter. He gives Peter a wink as well, and then he starts to take out his books. While the teacher is starting with explaining his plans for today, Peter leans towards his former best friend.
There are surprised gasps around them. Neither of them reacts to it. Peter barely even notices when his hands go up, resting on Johnny’s middle. He’s barely aware of himself leaning into the kiss, allowing Johnny in, both of them breathing heavily.
“We are all different paths, different memories you can chose to follow. You can choose who you want to follow tonight.”
“Oops,” she mutters, seeing the destroyed thing in front of her. She goes to the side to pick up her water bottle, and takes a large swing of it while putting her hand on her hip. After the bottle is empty, she takes a few long breaths before looking up. “FRIDAY, where are James, Clint and Sam right now?”
“Hawkeye is taking care of him.” Steve had followed Yaël’s gaze as soon as they stood still. Hawkeye… That name rang a bell… somewhere… maybe…
“I might have been told that a few times.” Steve then carefully puts Tony down on the bed, giving him a small smile. That playfulness of before suddenly gone from his face, and instead some uncertainty taking its place. Before Steve can pull away, Tony reaches out for him, putting a hand on Steve’s cheek and looking him into his eyes.
“Do you seriously expect me to believe this?” she asks angrily. “So, what, you put on some make-up to make yourself look older, bleach your hair? I know you’d do a lot to get what you want but I would never have expected you to sink so low.”
Typical Asgardian gowns. But each of them with a hint of their superhero personas. Steve has to admit that he loves the red fabric, decorated with golden ornaments. He’s pretty sure Tony’s going to look amazing in it.
“Guys! I was searching around for a Christmas present for Tony but I don’t have any ideas! What do you buy somebody who can afford anything?”
Peter decides to help out. He hurries to the kitchenette as well, taking out the glasses they’ve prepared and handing a few to Harry.
“Yeah, I’m sure it didn’t come back to him if he threw it,” Peter jokes, and Aunt May snorts before leaning forward some more. When some random guy passes them by and takes a good look at his aunt, Peter frowns at him.
“Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth,” Tony admits his frustration, actually meaning every word of it surprisingly enough. “But I don’t want to see you gone. We need you, Peter needs you.
Taking off his suit goes easily. Peter’s almost experienced when it comes to this. In just a minute, the thing is already folded back into his bag, and Peter already makes his departure from the toilet, though not without washing his hands. Mr. Stark notices a lot of things, and if Peter’s hands are not a tiny bit wet, he might think something more went on here.
“Steve, my own students are way more suitable to give these classes than I am,” Yaël countered with a grin.
But even that movie portrays his Dad the very way he used to be. And while it gets better in the ending, Peter still thinks it pretty much sucks in the beginning. Enough to make him want to walk out of the theater. Not only because of the sex-scenes, but mostly because of the fact that that actor is supposed to be portraying his Dad being in very… creative positions with other women.
“Peter, how did your mother know?” Tony asks. Peter blinks, appearing extremely disoriented. He’s sagging forward for a bit before May holds him back.
Tony’s had his doubts about Felicia. Especially since she seemed to just come into the picture when Peter had only just broken up with MJ. At first, he thought she was nothing more than a rebound girl for him, but with the way Peter is it would be a stretch, really.
, Tony thinks to himself. Only, last time, there had been somebody sitting next to him. Right now, he’s all alone in the room. Tony blinks a few times, trying to get used to the darkness and see if there
Steve has to admit that Natasha has a point. But… when it comes to Tony, he just never really thinks rationally.
“But the real reason I don’t like him isn’t actually that… That was your mother’s problem,” Aunt May admits. She starts walking again, this time not looking Peter in the eyes.
“Sorry! I was gonna come in normal clothes but I forgot they burn off when I flame up,” Johnny explains his appearance. Peter shakes his head, grinning towards Johnny as he pulls him into a hug.
I wanted to say; I never intended for there to be a coincidentally between Peter's homeless shelter and FEAST, but after finishing the game I decided to make it one and the same. When I found out about FEAST, I was rather happy that I could put a name on it and dig even deeper into it. I decided to base a couple of more things on the game, and possibly the movie after I've seen it (yeah, so only five theaters in my country played it, which was annoying as Hell since mine wasn't on that list, meaning that we've had to wait a bit until we could finally see it) I'm so freaking curious about it!!
Yaël walked to the corned and glanced to what was behind it. Right at the same time, she heard Korg mumble: “Hey, what’s this?” behind her. There, on the ground, laid Loki, stunned by the electroshocks that constantly went through him by the device in the neck.
“I have news,” Steve suddenly said, pulling Yaël from her thoughts. She looked up smiling, unable to hide her relief. ‘I have news’ sounded like he was going to talk about himself. “Tony and I… we are to-tog-, well, we are in a rela- eh-“
“Buzzkill,” Peter mutters. “But you’re right, I should get some sleep. Tomorrow I need to figure out a way to get Karen back into the mask.”
“Don’t get me wrong, you’re still an intern,” Mr. Stark says as they start walking towards the entrance. “I’m just assigning you as my
“Hey! Don’t walk away from me!” the other person, a man, shouts. Michelle snaps something back in a lowered voice. Then, eventually, she starts walking off carrying her bag over her shoulder and keeping her thick coat closed with her hands. Peter follows her with his eyes for a short while until she’s passing a corner, and then he leans back on the roof.
And right before she saw Loki’s apparition turn to dust, Yaël managed to ask: “Wait, did you tell me you want to leave this planet so I can go with you and go back home?”
“So, what’s new in your life after all these months?” Yaël asked after she wiped away a few joyful tears. By just asking that simple question, it seemed like she just crushed his good mood. His smile quickly faded. Suddenly, Steve looked ten years older, yet he still tried to look happy…and failed.
The nurse gives him a sympathetic look and then reaches out for his shoulder. “The doctors will be here shortly. You can tell them what you just told me, alright?”
“None of this is my mistake!” Yaël saw fury flash through Nilla’s eyes and already put herself in a defensive position, ready for the fire. Right when Nilla moved her leg to steer fire, Yaël already blocked it with water she pulled from the sink.
Peter doesn’t know enough of it to really put anything together about it. All he knows is that Tony considers him too young to be getting involved with this, so he’s kept out of it, mostly.
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter returns. He clears his throat, looking down at his feet. There, he notices the first snowflake starting to fall down. The breath in front of him forms its usual cloud, and his lips curl up in a light smile. “You know I’m not angry at you, right?”
So Ton finally moves. Everybody stays quiet, holding on to the toast as they all seem to realize it might not be over so soon. Impatiently, they wait for Tony to reach the door. Even Peter starts shuffling on his feet, a bit nervous. Harry snorts, next to him, finding his fidgeting amusing.
“Steve,” he starts, taking a few breaths. But Steve’s no longer awake, and Tony is left alone in this discussion. He clears his throat before getting back to the living room where he sees Hilde already carrying Sam as well.
“Dude, you and Stacey were over before he even went out with her,” somebody in the crowd says. Probably one of their old friends. Peter only vaguely recognizes him in this state. He squeezes his eyes shut for a bit, rubbing them with his fingers while he takes in that last sentence.
And it’s not like the choice is immediate, but whichever internship he’ll chose will give him possible advantages, so it seems. But, once again, choosing wrong now can only give him the best answer on what his definitive choice will have to be once he graduates high school.
hot,” the Cat mutters against his mouth, grinning widely. Peter doesn’t respond, letting his hands rest on her back, sliding them lower and lower until they’re grabbing her ass instead. She pushes herself up against him, causing for Peter to groan.
“Two months later, they get married at the beach in Malibu. And from then on, they are known as Steve Rogers-Stark and Tony Stark-Rogers.”
“No! We’re not-! Not that!” Steve quickly counters, finally opening the door the moment Tony’s back on his feet.
“Damn right!” Steve says from a bit further away. He gestures for them to join. “Come, let’s take a pizza and watch a movie!”
Rhodey, Bruce, Mantis and Peter nod. May looks a bit unsure, though she, too, gets out a nod eventually. It’s unspoken though already fact that she’ll be teamed up with Rhodey. To defend herself, Tony gives her a gun for stunning.
“Not that I want back; I’m too young to own a company! Jeesh, if we’re 2016, that means I’m 18 now, right? Who in their right mind would pass me down a company now?” Harry picks up another pizza. “When I can get out of here, I’ll pay the current board members a visit, see what we can arrange. Maybe something for later.”
“Let him go, then,” she says, waving Peter away without even looking at him. Peter stands up immediately, grabbing his bag again while standing at the door. The other man doesn’t even look at the two others anymore, instead walking towards Peter with a smirk on his face. When Peter meets his eyes, he can see some sort of playfulness here.
“They have noticed that you get a lot of media-attention, in a very bad way. And you using your powers started freaking people out since they haven’t forgotten what had happened during the Chitauri attack, Yaël.”
His phone has been going crazy the entire day, mostly people tagging him in posts and Ned and Wade asking questions he’s been ignoring. Ever since he’s woken up, he isn’t feeling like facing other people. Especially with the way he’s started his day – that’s something the two of them are going to have to talk about, but then again, there’s a lot to discuss, anyway.
“Yet the Vulture still managed to break into your quinjet?” Steve counters, unimpressed. Tony gives him a glare before rolling his eyes.
Lopt signed her to follow him. As they walked closer towards the light, which appeared to be a campfire, she saw herself lying next to it. Her other-self woke up and started looking around. Of course, this past-version of her couldn’t see her actual self and Lopt standing there. The other Yaël looked terrified as she discovered she was completely alone in a dark and deep cave.
“What’s wrong, Petey?” Steve asks, leaning a bit against the door. Tony shuffles up behind him and wraps his arm around his middle. After all this time apart, all he wants is to just be close for a moment.
“Hey, good idea! I’ll add her to the list,” Tony quickly interrupts him. Bruce wants to protest and probably say that he didn’t actually mean it, but Tony doesn’t give him the chance. He quickly sends the message and then leans back in his seat.
Mercy wasn’t something Steve asked for at all. He never wanted it. He requested something different. When he signed the contract with Tony to be his omega, Steve thought it would be a one and done. He treasured each moment of their time together. As soon as Tony knotted him, as soon as he took him on the bed from behind, Steve knew. The flush of heat from his gland, the spread of it like fire in his chest and through his gut. He shuddered and tried to figure out what was happening to his body. But it became clearer the longer they were together. His gland reacted to Tony.
Clint strode right up to Tony, leaned down, and stuck his face right up to Tony’s face. “What the fuck do you even know? I have children. I have a wife. They depend on me. Do you think, for even a second, mating with Natasha stopped me from loving them?”
He should really rest, because his head pounds and he feels a little like he’s floating, like his body is too light to stay on the bed. “I’m not sure I have a family anymore.”
By the time he accepted there was no real answer, the sun had risen and he was staring out at the gleaming mountains of Manhattan. Brooklyn faded away but the feeling of Tony in his arms lingered. Getting a shower and shave saved him from having to think about the blissful feeling he had – just lying there with a man in his arms, nuzzling and being close. He rinsed away the feeling, shaved and prepped for his meeting. He dressed and then went to the kitchen to find Sam already frying eggs in a pan.
As soon as Steve reappears, Tony is nearly climbing him. “Sorry, Tony. I didn’t think. That was so – damn. I’m really sorry.”
“True, but you are able to do this. You’ve explained how you did it before. All you need do is open the entrance to his soul like you did before.”
“It’s okay, Buck,” Steve says and grips his shoulder. It’s the wrong thing to do because Bucky rears up and shoves Steve away. Staggering back, Steve pitches over the wooden chair he’d been sitting vigil on and tumbles to the floor.
“You-I,” Steve said, peered over his shoulder as if he expected someone there. “Can I come in? I kind of would like some company.”
He might hear his name called a few times before he finally looks up from his crouched position in the chair next to Steve’s bed. It’s Bruce. He blinks a few times, rubs at his eyes. “What time is it?”
“Felt it, heard it. Yeah, something like that. It wasn’t a direct thought, but the feeling was clear. And shit, Steve, no, you are not alone,” Tony said and squeezed his hand.
“They did a study once. Found that very symmetrical people are considered beautiful. You’re pretty symmetrical.” Tony pretends he didn’t just tell Steve how beautiful he is. Instead, he explores further, touching the bridge of his nose. “Your nose isn’t perfectly straight is it?”
Steve cannot answer, cannot respond as he studies the device which is larger than a silver dollar but smaller than a cup’s saucer. “What is that?”
He crosses the room and shakes his head. “This is not for you.” Planting himself in-between the bed and the omega might seem like a sham. The man has several centimeters on Tony, and his muscle mass has improved greatly over the past week. “You are not invited to my bed. We are not lovers. We are alpha and omega. You are my warrior and I am your lord. That is our relationship. Do you understand?”
“And it’s the terrorists that killed your fiancé fault. But we can say that until we’re blue in the face and it’s not going to convince either one of us, is it?”
“I left.” His words rasp. “I went back in time. It was terrible not to have you even if you weren’t mine.”
While he’d challenged Stark the first time he’d met him, he finds himself on the opposite side of the equation.
“No, I’m just wondering if we could have some music so I can do my shopping list while you busy yourself down there.”
“That’s not true,” Steve hisses. In some ways it’s like talking to his own conscience. That little niggling voice in the back of his head that murmurs fears and worries about truths he never wants to face. “I knew you, Buck. I know you. You’re a good man. You always were.”
Steve found himself listing to the side and Tony eased him down. Chills ran up and down Steve’s spine and raised gooseflesh. Steve bit back his fears, Tony didn’t need to know them. Tony put his warm hands on Steve. “Sleep, I’m here.”
“Upstate,” Sam said. “That’s what Nat said.” He gave Steve the address. “She said to approach cautiously – they have traps set.”
“And according to my protocols to safeguard the prince’s wellbeing and knowing his current mental health state, you are defined as a personal assistant to the prince.” The AI almost sounds put out.
“How long is the contract on the house for?” Tony never pays attention to details like that, his life is orchestrated by unseen assistance and AIs.
“Wait, what? You have one?” Tony asks and the stunned feeling radiates upward numbing him from his toes to the crown of his head.
“I don’t think that’s how this works,” Steve replied. He wanted Tony out; he had things to do like pack and go to DC and forget that he woke up seventy years in the future to fight aliens- from OUTER SPACE.
Later Steve learned about vampires and their special powers. About how Thor summoned the thunder and lightning. It seemed too magical to be real, but it was. He’d witnessed it more than once. Natasha had other powers, where she could literally fade into the shadows. She called it realm hopping. He wasn’t sure what that even meant. Yet, he’d witnessed her disappear. He figured she must be older than she looked, much older. Some said from the early last century, others pinned her as the lost daughter of the Russian Czar. Who knew?
“I’m not even sure what this is. I don’t know how to pick anyone? Strange said it would just come to me,” Steve replied and his wrist hurt again, as if just being in their presence caused something to flicker and burn. He pulled the cuff of his sleeve up again and Bruce bent over his arm.
“Y-yes. That’s exactly it.” Steve nods and clips the bracelet back on his wrist. He checks to see if it’s been activated and, thankfully, it hasn’t so Clint and Thor won’t be bursting through the door trying to save whatever virtue he has left.
“Yeah,” Tony says and flops back again, adjusting the sheet so it does cover him. “He’s not as good as you.”
Tony never flinched. As if a spirit from a different world possessed him, Tony raised his hands and the heated power flaring in his chest, spread outward to his hands. The beam of pure energy shot out of the palms of his hands where they had nailed him to a wooden cross. The fire hit Ross squarely in the head, decapitating him instantly. Without thought, Tony spun around and shot Pierce and the doctors. The agents fired but Tony blocked their bullets with a blast of energy that slammed their bodies to the wall, breaking their fragile necks. In seconds it was over. They were dead.
Steve scoffed. “For God’s sake, Tony. I am trying to protect you, my pack, everyone. That’s my job. I signed up for this. You never did. You don’t have to do this, I do.”
Now he has to drag his ass back down and find a source of water. It can’t be too far. In the distance he sees poppy fields and they need water. The farmers in the area must have a source of some kind. He gives himself a few minutes to rest. He hasn’t eaten all day. He doesn’t want to mention his hunger again, because he’s wary of Blu leaving. It’s getting to be late afternoon. He doesn’t want the lion away from him. It strikes him as odd how much this lion and his little stuff toy represent security to him.
“Those are black cherries.” Tony smiles and it charms his eyes. “Not the real thing, but as close as we can come these days. I may have mentioned to the chef that you liked black cherries.”
The man smiles. “Doctor Bruce Banner, heard you were looking for a doctor. Didn’t think you needed one right away, though.”
“Yeah.” Tony leans against the back wall of the storage closet. “This has to be Romanoff. I gonna hate killing her.”  His eyes are lowered, and his hands are useless in his lap.
“Well, guess we’re stuck here. Rest of the team isn’t coming for our little holiday, teambuilding exercise.” Steve waves his arms to indicate the massive lodge they rented for the team and some support members to spend the long February weekend.
He doesn’t last long and the bittersweet flood of semen gushes into Tony’s mouth. He drinks it down and then kisses and tongues Steve’s balls. Steve tries to get up, tries to reciprocate, but Tony isn’t having any of that. He’s focused, driven – more so than he’s ever been on any problem or equation.  He continues to kiss up to Steve’s mouth and shares the lingering taste with him. His hand finding Steve’s cock again – and unsurprisingly it’s hard, answering Tony’s ministrations. With some lube Tony finds in its usual place under the pillow, Tony begins to tease Steve.
“Well, something like that, but not really. Mom was a free thinker.” There’s a wistful longing in Steve’s tone that Tony files away for later. He’d like to know what it means someday.
Tony takes the bracelet from Obie and gives it only a passing glance before his gaze rests on Steve. He inhales deeply, and then slowly exhales. Handing the bracelet back to Steve, Tony says, “That’s not Kree technology. That’s a standard locator beacon wristband. It’s driven by a crystal that homes to the artificial gravity core of the station.”
After their time in the cabin, a place that Strange spoke of as the Learning Hut, Tony separated himself from the rest of the soul pack. He went through his Mantra, adding in that he wanted privacy and peace. It always worked and helped him maintain a sense of self. He needed time to process what had happened.  When he finally got out of the conference room and escaped to his penthouse apartment, Tony sequestered himself in the small room off to the side of the main lounge. He thought of it as his study but hated to call it that because his father had a study off of the main living room of their house on 5th Avenue.
“Let’s go. We don’t have a lot of time,” Natasha said. “Can you get these off of him?” She’d turned to Clint and he shook his head.
“Assuming. I made you go and get condoms and lube because I assumed we were going -. Well, it’s not romantic at all. I wanted our first time to be romantic, not this.” He eats more of his cheeseburger to stop his mouth from spitting out all his secrets.
She escorts him to the door and picks up some cookies along the way. She wraps them in a paper napkin and tucks them into the paperbag. Before she gives them to him, she tells him she’ll get him an extra napkin from the kitchen. She disappears and comes back only minutes later, handing him the bag. “For the road.”
“Well, I guess I could just jump on the bike SHIELD gave me and wander around the country for a while.” Absently, he flipped through the printed pages.
“Yes.” Steve can’t make assumption what thoughts Tony’s specifically talking about, but this confirms his theory. “The connections must be a little leaky.”
As he climbs back to his feet, Blu nudges him again with his big snout. Teetering, Tony does not have enough balance with his injured arm and painful ribs to keep standing and he falls again. With a huff he goes down and Blu swishes his tail; his mouth open in a terrible grimace.
He regards her silent admonishment, shrugs, stoppers the crystal decanter, and then says, “Maybe later. Come, Sheriff, sit.”
“Probably. You passed the tests. He likes how you treat me. I like how you treat me.” Tony hadn’t meant to say the last part out loud and Steve, thankfully, had only paused for a second before he carried on with the more mundane part of their work. He never mentioned Tony’s slip up.
Steve released him then and sidled underneath Tony. Looking up at Tony as he panted over him, Steve opened his mouth and then gulped down Tony again. This time Tony couldn’t hold back and as soon as Steve worked his throat around his swollen cock, he came. Steve swallowed as much as it could of the bitter seed until it frothed around his lips and he came into his own hand as he stroked himself.
“War games!” Thor said and picked up his glass as if to throw it, but Sam caught his arm and shook his head. “Oh yes. No throwing in front of the little ones.”
Tony doesn’t want to know why the man needs to be soothed or when for that matter. Before he can comment, though, Bruce continues, “No, Tony, listen. It’s the Kiminshy Proposition.”
The shock on Tony’s face cut through Steve hard, faster than any knife or weapon. Steve wanted to cross the distance, he wanted to take Tony into his arms, but the courage, the bravery he had always been heralded for – that reservoir he could always count on – just wasn’t there. He curled up and hugged his arms around himself as he watched Tony deflate with his words.
Tony wipes away the soap from his eyes and says, “I think we should get out before we drown in a bathtub.”
Tony made a small hmm sound and then tilted his head as he examined the brand, both the wristlet and the swirl with the green dagger representing Bruce. After a full minute, Steve sighed and said, “Are you going to do it or not?”
The wildness in Steve’s eyes like a prey animal knowing full well he’s trapped by a predator triggers Tony to act. Even if he’d wanted to stop himself, there would be no way in hell he could have. He leaps forward, grabs Steve’s shirt, and yanks him close enough to plant his lips on his mouth. For a moment, there’s no response at all. The shock overwhelms both of them – Steve too surprised to move, Tony too terrified to act. They stand there, frozen by fear and disbelief.
Steve closes his eyes and clamps a hand over his face. “Yeah. Not anymore. I can’t feel it. Not the pathway. It’s gone. Feels like someone cut off my limbs.”
“Well, the universe and your astral projections think differently,” Sam said. “Maybe, maybe you should go check out places in New York to live and visit with him. Then maybe we could think about what it means to be a soul pack.”
“I’ll take them out.” He hurries back downstairs and finds the oven mitts to pull out the potatoes. He puts them on the back of the stove where he feels heat coming out. When he goes back to join Steve, he reports, “Potatoes are on the stove, near the back to keep them warm. But I think the chicken will be done soon too.”
The vital signs drop over the HUD and Tony screws up his face, trying to make sense of what he’s reading. “How many appendages, JARVIS.”
The construct staggers to its feet, one knee bleeding copiously. Clint limps toward Steve, his face contorted in pain. The bizarre haircut is gone. The sword replaced with arrows. Steve grabs for the bag, but Clint falls and the agony of his wail echoes in the air.
“You look as tired as I feel, buddy.” He waves the lion over and wraps his arm over his shoulders. “Let’s go get a bath.”
He had nothing to say when they entered the field and a jet waited. He wanted to rage that the idiots waited for them instead of bringing Steve to the Tower immediately for emergency care. When he raced up the rampway though, he didn’t find either Barnes or Steve in the jet. A blonde headed woman sat at the controls while Natasha waited for him near the rampway.  The pilot had a headset on and whirled her index finger in the air as she directed, “Get it in line. We don’t have much time. The other jet is well on its way.”
Steve froze his features, didn’t react to their incendiary words. “From my understanding, , in the United States, humans killed by vampires for their blood is far less than the number killed by guns.”
Steve extricates Tony from him but grasps each of his shoulders. “You have nothing to be sorry about Tony.  To know something so terrible and to have to deal with it on your own, I don’t know how you did it.”
“That would be nice. Thanks.” He settles in the pilot’s chair and Tony sits next to him. He pulls off his helmet. There’s not much light but enough for the job. He just needs it straightened.
There he goes again, using the royal we, they. Is he really determined to get Blu away from here as well? This is a fine and quiet place for the lion to live his days. There is no one around for at least a few miles. Sure, the poppy farmers aren’t far but what would they be doing exploring the inhospitable rocky hillside. No poppies could grow here and from what Tony’s seen there are no villages close. A lion could live out his days here and be safe.
It was so much more than Tony could have dreamed. He stands in front of the cross now. There are spots of blood on the metal grooves. The grooves have tiny spikes at the nipples and at the waist. Steven particularly liked the nipple spikes and rubbed against them in a kind of ecstasy as Tony came.
Again, Steve lays a hand on his shoulder and pushes him down. “You’ll eat, and rest. I got them to give you another day to recover.”
“That’s precisely why we have to do it now,” Steve said. The towel he wore slung low on his hips and the water from the shower still glistened over his shoulders and pectoral muscles. He looked delightful and Tony wanted time to devour him. The hunger to taste was no longer there, but it was – in a different way. They’d slowly made their way back to each other. Tony never bit anymore, not even a nibble. That one afternoon on the balcony resonated with Tony, the way they fit together in the softest, most tender way. It helped Tony accept his new transformation as well as led him toward a vision of a future with Steve. Though they hadn’t made love, it had felt like it – more so than it ever had for Tony. He needed that connection. From that afternoon until this morning, they hadn’t strayed from one another’s side. The intimacy of being with Steve deepened Tony’s connection with him.
On the plane ride back to the States, Steve sat next to Tony and spoke to him in quiet tones. He often bowed his head and didn’t meet Tony’s eyes. “It’s hard for me to do this, Tony.” He clenched and unclenched his hands until he spread them out onto his thighs. Tony had remained silent, allowing the space that Steve needed to gather the courage to speak and explain. “I was taught it was wrong. I understand that it isn’t – wrong that is. But when I- when I want to I feel.” He stopped and flinched.
“Even if he offered, I don’t think I would take it.” The thought of being in Tony’s orbit always clenches something deep under his sternum, but also means that Steve accepts the idea of being an escort for Tony – and nothing more. That fact hurts and he shouldn’t even consider it. He rushes in to explain, “I have a lot of other clients that need me. I mean Captain Wilson comes to me exclusively now. How would it be just to abandon someone like the Captain?” He shakes his head. “No, I couldn’t do it.”
“Thanks.” Steve beams. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever seen him so relaxed and so happy to share something with him. Most of their days together consist of brainstorming and problem solving. He thinks the look of Steve in hard concentration might be the one he knows the best. This glowing expression is new, and it warms something deep in Tony’s chest.
“What was that all about?” Steve asked as he shuffled the map Clint had laid out on the kitchen table. The dirty dishes were stacked on the counter next to the sink.
“No, but he will,” Natasha said. She hesitated but stood up and lightly grasped his hand. “I don’t want to upset you. But things are different now with Tony. What he went through, what you went through, changes everything.”
A hail of bullets peppered the walls above Steve, and Tony knocked the gurney away from the wall. Tugging Steve, he pulled him down to the floor and covered him with his own body. Steve grunted and shivered against Tony. He was probably going into shock. Tony cursed and then felt the frustration gather under his breastbone. The heat flared, and he kicked the gurney until it was out of the way. One hand on Steve, Tony raised the other and a flash of brilliant white light blinded everyone. The agents firing on them dropped to the floor, dead. Blood leaked out of their ears and their mouths. For an instant, Tony worried about Clint – had he killed him as well? But he heard a muffled
Something about Steve’s attitude must tip Fury off because he backs away and down, stepping out of Steve’s path. “Okay, Commander, do what’s necessary, but remember.”
“We do. We know he just cut us off. I couldn’t feel him. Could you? Like a wall. He constructed a wall. I didn’t even know he could do that,” Natasha said. “I didn’t know anyone could do that.”
Once freed, Clint sat up and cradled his head in his hands. “What the hell happened? I feel worse than the post-Loki crap.”
Steve only laughed. They traipsed back through the corn, the armor following in the air. Clint grumbled how they had no respect for the land and the work a farmer put in, but seemed to reflect back their happiness.
“You might need it. If we call you for help, call him. He has the connections,” Steve said and clasped Sam’s hand. “I really appreciate it, Sam. If push comes to shove and it’s between saving yourself and saving-.”
“Relax,” Sam said. “I don’t want to be there anymore than you want me there. Can someone teach this dude about that Soul Mantra thing.” Sam rubbed at his temple and squeezed his eyes closed. “It’s like a buzz, a very loud buzz. He’s giving me a headache.”
“You’re delusional,” Tony says and again it’s a strike that doesn’t hit its target with her. Rarely anything does.
“Don’t say it, don’t God damn say it. I don’t need my rest. I’ve been well for a long time now, you keep me waiting and doing nothing but watching the tumbleweeds blow down the damned street of the town.” Bucky slams a fist against the window frame. The uneven glass rattles. “You picked Clint as your deputy. Clint.”
“He reuses the grinds. He’s uncultured,” Darcy says and pats Sam on the shoulder. “What will you have to eat?”
“No. He’s a man seeking redemption, but he won’t admit it. He won’t tell anyone he’s Iron Man. He keeps it secret.” Steve shuffles the panels and shows Tony some of the storyline.
“I could instruct you on a whole lot of other things,” Tony whispers as his tongue dances along Steve’s ear. “Lots of other things, more important things.” He blows against his ear.
Steve settled back in the chair at his kitchen table. He spread out the papers again and his writing tablet. “Well you are not the first to tell me that, but I don’t know Sam. Everyone’s happy.” That – right there, he told himself was the overstatement of the century.
It’s bad enough that when Tony woke up from another drug induced nap he panicked from not knowing where the hell he was.  Two things terrify him as a blind man. One was not knowing where the hell he was, the other was the idea of losing his mental capacity and being vulnerable to the outside world. In some ways he feels like the world within his brain is the place he lives while the world he cannot see is beyond him, like a nebula in outer space. Waking up and not knowing where he was and feeling groggy on top of it sent him into a tailspin. Now, as he sits in the clinic – in a damned hospital bed as if he’s infirmed – Strange, Pepper, and Rhodey discuss his case as if he’s not even in the room.
“Okay,” Steve says. He knows this is part of the deal; Natasha had informed him of the contract’s stipulations.
“No one act,” Steve commanded. He heard a quick exhale from Natasha but managed to ignore it as he faced Iron Man. Bucky stood behind Steve, only about a meter away. “Tony.”
Before Tony can respond, a pain like a bullet through the brain hits him hard and he hisses. Dropping his wrap, he cups his face in his hand and tears the glasses off. He hears the clatter of a dish and Steve is standing next to him.
“With the scepter in play, we have to assume so,” Fury confirmed. “Plus remember, their country’s been preyed upon not only by Hydra but by a corrupt and dictatorial government. They went to von Strucker as -.”
Tony settles into the chair, leaning back but Steve is the one to trigger the mechanism to help him recline. “Thanks.” Tony thinks he might say it out loud but when he gets these types of headaches it’s nearly impossible to tell. His hearing roars in his head and he feels like every nerve in his body tingles.
“No. I am not.” Yinsen stands up and goes over to a little table that has a single burner hot plate. “Now, can we try the soup again.”
Blu licks his lips and then bends down, carefully clenching his jaws around the armor. He manages to hold a large chunk of it. Tony pulls the rest into his arms, his wrist aching and his ribs on fire. He needs to get help soon. Trudging up the hillside, hauling heavy metal alloy pieces doesn’t help much. By the time they get to the shelter of the overhang that Tony indicated, he drops to his knees and the armor clatters to the hard ground. His breath comes in shallow pants. It hurts to breathe. Blu sidles up to him and licks his face.
“Steve?” He hurries to the stricken man’s side, and orders the faceplate lifted. “Damn it, I knew you were alive, I knew you were real.”
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs, dropping his hand he sits up. “Did he say what it’s about?”
“He brags about it, what kind of gentleman does that?” Steve says. “He’s trouble. And he disappeared during the war, did you know that? Supposedly went on some kind of secret mission for the Union, ended up being found like three months later. He didn’t do anything for the war effort after that. He just up and stopped. Privileged rich boy.”
Tony gets in position and Steve leads him to the table, helping him adjust the chair to sit down. As he does, he tells Steve to sit to his left. A scrap of the metal chair on the wooden deck and then Steve’s settled next to him. Vision sets the platters of food on the table with dishes and glasses of pink lemonade, he narrates all his actions before he departs.
Steven blinks rapidly as if to clear away the sorrow. “It isn’t you, my lord. Just memories of a different time.”
The prince is something different –he can only describe it as a sensual response. The prince’s body moves and reacts to Steve’s ministrations like an instrument being played. Taut muscles sing under his hands and then release as he strokes and touches. Each time, Tony lets out the most beautiful gasp of air that sends chills down Steve’s spine.
The media talk about it for days and Pepper is elated about the positive press.  The Board of Director’s meeting that followed had been a buzz with the news and remained upbeat about the direction of the company even with Tony’s recent absence. They saw the marriage as  sign of Tony’s new stability.
Tony’s standing in an underground hidden facility. He has a holograph projected above him in his workshop and Steve can see the battle plans he’s laid out. He wants Steve’s opinion but all he can think about as he stands there like a ghost visiting a life he can never have again, is how very beautiful Tony looks with his hair disheveled and his face marked with grease.
“Maybe he wants to have sex?” Bruce states this as if he’s talking about Tony taking Steve out for an ice cream cone and a walk in Central Park. Tony nearly swallows his tongue. He’s not ready for this conversation, not with Bruce and especially not with Steve. When Tony doesn’t respond, Bruce looks away from the pile of tangled wires and studies him instead. Being under the scrutiny of a man about to burst into a green rage monster at any minute unsettles Tony and he inwardly cringes but manages to keep his false facade. Bruce ignores him and asks, “Do you want to have sex with him?”
“Huh, I was just thinking about that. Fractals are complex patterns that use the same shapes over and over again to create an intricate design. I used a pattern similar to fractals in order to create the reality of the entrance. Cool, you know about that.” He slaps Steve on the shoulder and heads toward the house.
“And you wonder, are they worth it? Are they worth the sacrifice?” Tony asked, and Steve caught sight of a single blood red tear fall and drop onto their clasped hands.
As if Thor reads his mind he says, “You may always love her, but you should not put her on some pedestal. She wouldn’t want you to never love again.”
“Even as a lion. Except for when I was captured. I did what I wanted to do. I helped who I could. I searched for an answer to why it happened to me, and I did what I thought was right.” Steve touches the band. “Right now, this is right.”
Tony grunted and took the offered mug. He wasn’t going to drink it, not really, but without a thought he sipped it. He had to admit, it tasted divine. “What’s with the hoodie?”
Steve watches the bubbles around him, slowly dissolving into the water. He knows looking up at Tony will end him, so he keeps his focus on the foamy bubbles. “For a long time, I had myself and no one else to look out for me. Bucky left for the war, I couldn’t depend on Peggy and Mike, because they had the orphaned kids to worry about. I’m an adult, I had to do it on my own. It was just me, Tony. I took care of myself and I learned that people can be pricks, no matter what. They use and abuse you and you have to learn how to stand up regardless of how many times they knock you down.”
The prince smiles. “Come, Steve from the Widow’s Brothel. Let me get you something to eat and something to drink.”
Steve smirked. "Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?"
He seethes. “Yes, it’s Tony. Tony’s a complicated person with complicated issues. Working this assignment has been challenging.” His mind races as he tries to figure out exactly why he’s here, what he needs. It comes to him. Steve bites back his lips, not sure he should ask. There’s no way out now. “I need a favor.”
“I could have. But what more would that have changed? Your parents would still have died at his hand, because our past wouldn’t have changed.  How can I continue to add timelines to suit my purposes? How can I play god like that?” Steve stands and the old tree rumbles next to him. “There was no other way.”
Steve finishes for him. “I see you for you. For Tony, not the prince.” He cringes and adds, “Well not just a prince.”
“Want to feel you. Let me feel all of you.” Tony’s desperate and begging. Steve’s never really seen him like this. Maybe it’s because he knows they don’t have time anymore. This is all they have left.
“It isn’t. I can feel it. It’s all over you,” Bucky said and squeezed his eyes closed. He fisted his hands. The struggle he underwent pounded out of him. He tried to control it. “God, Steve.” His eyes flashed open. “You know what they called that back then? You know that it was illegal? That you’re a damned-.” He stopped and choked on the words.
After nearly a year, he’s on his way to finding Steve. Why should he be concerned? The man left him high and dry and never looked back. For Christ’s sake, Tony thought he’d died in a damned fire. He found out the truth of it when Natalia or Natasha or whatever the hell her name is walked into his life and turn upside down the unsettling reality he’d been finally able to accept.  It took some time to get her to spill the beans. In other words, it took Tony finally nearly dying again because of the poisoning in his blood for her to come clean. As he watches the sights of the city run by him from the cab window, Tony recalls how he’d finally broken down and she along with her boss man finally came clean.
Even with the hot water cascading over him, he still shook like he was standing outside in the chilled and sleeting rain. God, what a fuck up he’d become. He scrubbed at his face, cleaned his hair, his entire body. Once he was done, he turned off the faucets and pulled a towel from the rack. He stood there, in the marble shower with the towel pressed to his face. He pushed it into his eyes until stars burst. He wanted that reality or whatever the hell it was. He wanted it to be real – somehow. He wished for Steve to want him like that and not see him as some deviant or perversion of normal – whatever the hell normal was.
“Yeah when all the soldiers came out of the foxholes and shared tea and cookies and played games. Sang Christmas carols.” Steve nods. “Yeah. We’re all human.”
Steve looks away and Tony spots the tears in his eyes. “I’ve spent several lifetime’s looking for my place. As a sickly man, as a soldier, as a beast among humans, and now as – whoever I am now.” He brings his gaze back to Tony. “When I saw you in that cave, everything about you changed me. I saw how hard you fought, how determined. I watched as you built a miracle machine from scraps. I followed you out and protected you because you deserved it. When you came back for me-.” He pauses and swallows hard. “When you came back, I thought I’d died and finally gone to heaven. Here you were, back and saving me. You didn’t leave me. You came back. I did everything I could to show you how much it meant to me. How much you meant to me.”
“I supposing this is a unibeam burn,” Tony says as keeps his eyes away from Steve’s gaze. He keeps his hands deftly busy as he speaks. “Was it the armor or did he just zap you with something else that was similar.”
He frowns. He could probably convince local authorities that it’s Avengers business, but then when nothing happens it might get back to Steve. It would get back to him anyhow. It’s not like he isn’t going to notice Tony leaving. He curses. Well there’s nothing for it, he’s stuck here.
“So sparring right now is out.” Tony crosses his arms and studies his companion. “How about a bath? I bet you would enjoy a spa bath and a massage.”
“Well, I can’t build the bomb they want and I don’t want to die, so you’re going to have to live to help me out here,” Steve says and tries to rinse a little of the wound. The wires spark but don’t do anything more insidious than that.
“Well, he always likes to make a big deal about donating. It’s a way to get his money for the Foundation. Oh and the Odinsons from Norway. They are big on clean energy,” Pepper finishes.
“How does it work?” Steve muttered as he closed his eyes. “You know, the toxin, the antidote. Even the coagulant. How does it work?”
The word caste jars him a bit, but that’s the truth of it. “Omega.” He pauses and then adds, “Sub-omega.”
“Quantum entanglement happens at the sub-atomic level. Newtonian physics applies on the macro-level.”
When Steve looks at him again, their sights line up and Tony’s world shakes beneath him. “What if I lose everything?”
With a crescent moon shining down, Tony spots Blu walking back to their camp. He throws down a fish next to his feet. The lion is soaking wet with a disgruntled, disgusted look on his face. Tony smothers his laughter. Apparently, lions don’t like to fish. Still, he’s grateful for the meal. He goes about cleaning it. He’s only done it once before when he went on a trip with Rhodey in college. His friend taught him. It was the one and only time Tony ever fished.
Steve clenched his jaw as he snapped the shield up into his hand by a quick kick. He cracked the shackle off and hissed, “It kind of feels personal.”  With that he turned around to open the door only to see a mass of agents in full military garb racing toward him. Spinning, he sliced through the cable wires of the elevator with the shield’s sharp edge, and it went into freefall. The brakes slammed the car to a stop, screaming against the friction. He went to the doors to pry them open since the car stopped between floors. Even as he did he spotted more troopers coming to attack. He pressed the doors closed again. The commander of the company outside the door warned him to come out, that he had nowhere to go.
Bruce watches him with a dull look in his eyes but doesn’t complain. Once he finishes, Bruce points to the small bistro table set he has set up in the corner of the small kitchen.
Steve enclosed Tony in his arms and kissed the crown of his head. Through the waves of their souls, he detected the halting, quiet despair shadowing Tony. “You need to sleep.”
Tony clasps a hand over one of his hands. “Listen to me, this is the way to do this. I will be responsible for you. Your team will be pardoned and you stay out of prison. I am not even dragging your friend along with this. Wherever he is, he stays. That’s the deal. It brings people home. Don’t you think that Clint wants to go home, or Scott?”
“You thought wrong,” Tony said and shoved past her. He didn’t want to face his own demons, and he wasn’t going to face ones she challenged him with right now. “Where is he?”
Tony might have walked away, but something in his partner’s eyes dared him not to, begged him to stay and change his perceptions.
He grabbed the notebook and started to write furiously about all the things he learned. He used his pencil to make Xs on the map on all the sightings he’d read about Blu the Lion. Maybe the lion was just trying to get home. Back to Africa. What little Tony knew by the end of the afternoon amounted to a circuitous route through Europe.  Tony looked at his stuffed toy.
Tony bolts up out of the bed and stands close to Steve. He’s facing slightly to the left of him. “Don’t you think I know that. Don’t you think I get it? When this first happened to me, I wasn’t a stranger to migraines, seizures, whatever the hell. I had a serious traumatic brain injury. Geez thanks dad!” Tony spins on his heel and steps away from Steve. “Every day I lived with the thought my brain would be taken away from me along with my sight. Every day. I was terrified. This-.” Tony gestures. “This is nothing.”
Someone is rushing around outside of the cradle. In the distance he hears the buzzers and beeps of monitors. Something warm flows into his veins and he settles again until the memories capture him and he’s at their mercy.
Tony would have spent time quizzing Legolas about his secrets, but being so close to Steve set off the echo in his head again and he squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to balance. He went through the Mantra. It might be a crutch but at least it hushed the reverberations of his own thoughts in his brain. He might need to stay as far away from Steve as possible if this was going to be a plague in his head all the time. Clint watched him with a critical eye.
Tony needed to get up, force himself to move. Steve needed to be properly fed or his strength would fail him. While the serum kept up for the most part with Tony’s feeding, even Steve needed to balance out his donations with his intake. After he drank his full, Tony found himself in a stupor. The luxury of his flesh feeling whole and natural overcame all sensible thought. As Tony tried to follow the thread of Steve’s conversation, his mind staggered like a drunk. “Hmm?”
Bringing the whole bucket to the fire, he ladles some of it into a metal cup and begins to warm it. At least he can flush the wounds. Once the water is warm enough, he brings it to Tony and then looks at the battery and the wires.
“Good idea,” Tony said. He considered both of them. Human and willing. Happy wasn’t even mated to anyone, he was just a loyal employee and friend of Tony’s. Clint – Clint was another story, one that Tony still didn’t understand not after all these years, but then again Tony still didn’t get Natasha either. He hoped he could trust them both. “Please. Keep at it.” He pointed to Clint. “Happy, help him out. Natasha needs the help and Clint’s her go to man. You got it?”
“Well, if fucking hurts you’re probably doing it wrong,” Steve replies and that brings a smile to Tony’s tormented face.
As the water hit him, Steve closed his eyes and tried to pretend he didn’t want to sin again. But he wanted to – he needed to. “Beloved,” he had said and cursed himself. He washed up that morning and put it behind him. He needed to. There was no other way. Refocus, he told himself. He was the team leader. He had no other choice. Want and hunger were human frailties. He was a leader of a pack. He needed to narrow his energies to his team and his pack for the betterment of the world.
“Shit,” Bucky says and turns from the collapsing side of the building and heads toward the shore. Even as he tries to clamber up the muddy rocks, his footing slips and he pitches forward, dropping his precious bundle and tumbling into the current. He tries not to release his hold on Steve but the water gets heavier and more forceful. The water isn’t deep but it is perilous and the current sweeps them under. He thrashes at the waves, searching for Steve. As he breaks the surface again the side of the fortress quakes and then slides into the water.  Seeking any sight of Steve, he spots him not far off as the current drags him away. He launches himself toward the Jedi as he lashes in the waters. His movements are reactionary and not precise, not measured. Yet, even as Bucky’s fear throbs a beat hard in his chest the idea that Steve’s fighting, struggling to live gives Bucky a sparkling of that hope left.
Steve rolled his eyes. “The brand thing?” He tugged up the cuff of his shirt for Tony to see the wrist markings and the new marking that symbolized Bruce. Why the hell the universe decided to link him to Bruce – and first – seemed so out of line and character that Steve really didn’t trust this whole magical, dimensional or whatever soul pack thing at all. “I’m all for it.” Why not? The universe decided to play with him in some kind of screwy way.  Again.
Stepping outside the room, Steve watches from the parlor – as both Pepper and Bruce work on Tony with silent efficiency. It’s plainly obvious they’ve done this before, that they have a routine to their actions. Neither of them speak as they go about their work, they know the routine, they need no instructions. He cringes and turns to leave only to bump onto Jarvis.
“Doctor Banner,” Steve said and then seemed to notice Tony for the first time. “Oh, I- Stark, I didn’t realize you would be here.”
“Maybe we get out and get something to eat. I mean we did both miss lunch,” Tony says and gathers Steve against him. Steve caresses a hand down his cheek and against the pulse point of his life. Tony gazes at him, not breaking eye contact. “I want you to only be with me this week.”
Steve can’t help but laugh. The tension tucked up under his sternum might just burst out like an alien if he doesn’t. He squeezes his hand closed and that’s when he realizes Tony still holds his hand. “Sorry,” Steve says and yanks his hand free.
“Call me Bruce. If we’re going to be bonded I think that would be best, don’t you?” He crossed his arms and tucked his hands under them.
As he flicked through the pages, Tony fell into a chair and cross referenced the experiments, the investigation with other volumes of his dad’s work. It seemed nonsensical and repetitive. Human perfection – Howard had scrawled that word over and again in the diaries. Did Howard actually think that vampires were the perfection of humans? That couldn’t be right, but then Tony found references to the serum.
“I’m pretty sure I had that on my order list.” In the kitchen Tony starts rummaging through the refrigerator where he finds heinously huge stacks of deli meats. “What are we going to do with all this food. There was supposed to be six of us.”
Steve finishes up his shower, shaves, and then dresses before he leaves the bathroom. He finds Tony dressed and ready to go. Clint has left the room with Steve’s bag. Tony sits on the bed; he’s facing the window – the blinds are open to a city he cannot see.
Tony presses his weight against Steve’s arm. Steve steps into the touch, yearning for more but not knowing if it’s allowed. “It’s a Road King, tricked out special. Gold and Red. Isn’t she a beaut? Most have a Milwaukee Eight standard engine, but I did my own enhancements way beyond the normal touring models. Also has direct connectivity to Friday and Twin cooled and a torque that makes it the best around for anything your heart desires.”
“Steve,” Natasha said and then she knelt in front of him, her hand on his knee. “She’s always part of us. Her link may be gone but you can feel her presence still. She helped you accept this world. Don’t make light of that. It was important.”
With a wish of good luck, she disconnects. Tony sits quietly at the kitchen island, staring across the empty space to the fire that still happily burns. His shoulders sag and he decides first he’ll show some initiative and clean the kitchen. During the past two days, Steve has been the most domestic of them. It takes a while to clean since he doesn’t know where everything is or goes. But he gets it done and feels accomplished for it.
Tony looks around and then shrugs. “Well, it doesn’t matter as long as we don’t go through the exit Door. Every which way should lead us to the Hub.”
“You fucking let them beat you, didn’t you? This isn’t a game, hero boy.” Tony knows what those soldiers like, what Raza’s men enjoy. A beating, some torture. It’s what those on the edge of life will do to others to get what they want. He’s beginning to understand the terror of war – not only the business of it.
When Friday insisted that the system must reboot, Tony had slumped back in his chair in front of a console of screens. He had been visiting the Avengers campus in upstate New York. He’d decided to come for a weekend since his trip to see Pepper had been cut short. Cut short in that she had no interest in getting back together and he had to agree. They worked better apart than together.
“Will do,” Steve says, and they hug quickly and part. Turning to the gateway guards, Steve exposes his implant, and the scanner reads it. The tired guard waves him through without a word. No one cares about his suitcase, Royal Escort or not. Steve shrugs and grabs it.
“Son of a bitch he will. Is Colonel Phillips going to be present?” Tony scrambles to climb out of their little cocoon.
Steve peers up at Bucky, the smirk on his face revealing so much more, and then he decides to play along for a bit. Over the years, Steve’s learned that when Bucky wants something, something that he knows Steve would disapprove of, he plays a game of bait and switch.
Tony ran his hands through his hair and frowned. “Well somethings I suppose just aren’t second nature yet.”
“Sorry. I just don’t know the guy to say anything at all,” Rhodey says. “Outsides of that party, I never really talked to him. I mean I talked to him on the phone once and then again in person after that.”
“Sure, I heard about them, Everyone has. But they are just kids stuff, made up legends and myths. Adults who still claimed it I thought everyone who had them were – just – you know, crazy.” Tony frowned.
Before he could elaborate, Tony spat out, “What the hell is going on? Why aren’t we going to the garage? Where the hell are you expecting to go?”
Tony cringed at the term but kept his outward appearance immobile. Before Cathy led Thor away, Tony managed to a little grunt that stopped her. His whole being locked like someone had glued him together and he’d never move again. Through sheer willpower, Tony tore away at the overwhelming sensation of paralysis and said, “What about St-Steve? Captain Rogers?”
With Steve Rogers as Captain America downing a plane into the Arctic Ocean – it chilled Tony to the very core. He placed the book on his side table and left Blu behind, because his father hated the stuffed animal. He climbed down the wide, dark wood staircase with its sweeping thick carved railing and headed toward the workshop where his father spent much of his spare time. He walked across the courtyard, the leaves of fall littering the pathway to the workshop. When Tony arrived, he nearly swung open the door without knocking, but good sense stopped him. He went to knock, but then he heard voices.
It embarrasses Tony to admit that he never took much of an interest in his mother’s artistic past. “There’s a bunch of her stuff still at the Tower. When we get back, you’re welcome to go through it.”
“He lied,” Tony says but the strength of his anger fades away and he sighs. “How come he never went into heat?” He’s not looking at Barnes now, he keeps his eyes lowered like any good omega asking an alpha.
Tony prepared for this with Pepper. He knows that it would be shocking news. When Tony’s out in public, he’s always interacting with people and places with no sight issues whatsoever. So, he doesn’t take it as an insult. Not right away. “I’m legally blind. I have some minor sight but not much, mainly shadows and light. I was in an accident – the same accident that killed my parents when I was a teenager – that took my sight.”
“For Christ’s sake, get back from the camera. What do you want?” It wasn’t Fury, which was good because Tony wasn’t in a mood to deal with the director.
Tony reaches over and clasps Steve’s hand. “Then you are in for a treat!” He looks down at himself. “I’m going to get into something more appropriate. You finish up and then I’ll meet you back here in 15?”
The door of the car opens and he enters the bonding level. The layout mimics the design above. The waiting area is a circular room with large panes that viewed the open seas. Music filters in, quiet and low. It is very relaxing to watch the marine life drift by as the instrumental song whispers in the background. Unfortunately the observation panes do not span the entire 360. In segments, corridors to the bonding rooms break up the view. Above one of the halls a light flashes and he realizes that’s his signal. He heads in that direction. He can’t lie and say he’s not excited; his own body sweats of alpha hormone. He knows that because he’s been on suppressants, he’ll be particularly intense – if that’s the right word. It’s not.
Cupping Steve’s hand in his own Tony grasps the slack fingers. “I don’t know you. Not like I want to. When you came to me asking for a chance, I thought you were cute, adorable in an innocent, naïve kind of way. But I have a feeling you were never naïve at all. You know something, you knew this would happen, didn’t you? You were trying to speed things up. Always asking things that didn’t seem right.” Tony finds he’s sniffling. “What’s going on Steve? Why is this happening?”
He slogs through the water, all the time peering behind him waiting to find the coming troopers to take them out. But no one comes because the fortress behind him convulses as if it has been hit by a torpedo. It begins to lean; the right side of it going down in a slow slide toward the river.
Is it a challenge or a lure, Steve isn't sure so he treads softly. His voice calm even after nearly eating the dirt from the fight the boy just rescued him from. "You know. He's all muscles and, like, has no front leg there. One of ‘em’s missing and all."
Blu mumbles a growl and Tony shakes his head. “Well, if you’re going to live with me, you gotta get over this issue with water, big guy.”
Bruce stood as well and nodded. “He’s in good condition. The serum is working right on target like I said. But his brainwaves indicate coma like status. The doctors can’t figure it out.”
On the bed, Steve has a small duffle bag open (where the hell did he get it?). He has a number of articles spread out as if he’s been sorting the clothes and books.
“God, Tony, please. Please I need to come. Please,” Steve nearly cried the words. His breathing came in short gasps, panting over Tony. It felt like Tony breathed the air himself. It suffused through him like the warming rays of the sun.
Yinsen shrugs his shoulders. “Have you not heard of the lion with the thorn in its paw? Those who help it, are rewarded.”
Tony cannot argue, his limbs feel loose, his bones ache, and his chest feels like it might burst from the broad strips of ropes that feel like they are wrapped around it. “Yeah, you’re probably right.” He takes another draw of water that Steve offers him from a small tin cup and then lays back on the bed. One hand cradled over his chest, and the other supporting his head, he says to Steve, “You ever wonder if there’s a great beyond?”
Strange brings one of the apparatuses over to sit in front of Tony. He has Tony place his chin in the small plastic cupped shelf and then sits on the others side. “Please, Personal Assistant, turn off the lights.”
As a child, sure, he’d heard of them, but now he knew that was some kind of different memory. A fake one that had been implanted in his head since Strange’s encounter with the celestial being. He feared all of his memories might be fake. But the ones of his mother couldn’t be, could they? As a sick little boy, she leaned over his bed and brushed his hair back, sang him songs from the old country, and told him tales of soul packs in ancient days. Were all of those memories false? What was a soul pack? What did it mean for him as an individual?
Steve handled it, but the threads of his soul shook like leaves in the wind. He was at his breaking point. Tony went to support him, to reach out and touch him at the moment that Steve broke away from Thor but slid Steve’s hand down and grasped Thor’s hand. The reaction and bonding flared and Steve stumbled – the strength of it so brash, so potent that he nearly went down to the ground. Shocks of blue fire crackled around their hands and Tony flinched away as Steve stated, “Guide.”
Even as he finishes up with setting the initialization program in the computer, Tony catches Steve shivering through another racking spear of pain. He cannot do this, he can't. There's not a way for Steve to survive this hell.
Steve laid his head back on the pile of pillows. Why hadn’t anyone told him about that? Why hadn’t he even considered it himself? It was exactly what happened when Tony attempted to force the bond – of course, Steve had thought it was due to the fact Tony and Steve were always adversaries. They were on the same side but always beating at each other. Their bond was not a given. But apparently it was.
The rooms are pretty much alright. A few of Clint and Wanda’s possessions might have been destroyed, but all the other stuff can easily be moved back to the tower. The moving people are already on it, just like FRIDAY and Peter are already busy with bringing everybody to their respective floors. Tony just sighs, kicking away a small stone on the ground.
“Yes, you are,” Steve returns with a grin. His nose follows the path of the scar, coming up to his sternum until he gets to the other scar, the one that came from the arc reactor. Tony lets out another shaky breath, his project suddenly forgotten. The little device that had been projecting the hologram rolls off his chest.
“Damn it, where’s Johnny?” Peter wonders. After yesterday, he arrived home and told Johnny he wouldn’t be joining him to the party. And Johnny had been disappointed a bit, but told him that he understood why. But, when in the morning Peter came to get Johnny, he wasn’t in bed.
"I know, Tones. We never like these kind of things," Steve returns. They don't notice Peter and Johnny sitting on the couch when they get into the room. Heading to the kitchenette, Steve starts preparing himself a cup of coffee while Tony sits down, stretching his arms and groaning a bit. When he puts his hands on his back, he hisses in pain.
“I, uh,” he starts. Then he chuckles when he pulls his pants off the ground and puts them back on. Where-ever his underwear went, he has no clue. It’s not like it matters. He just wants to be away from here as quickly as possible. “This was a mistake.”
“Dad, please, you don’t have to pretend with me,” Peter assures him. “I know what it’s like, this disease in our heads. In the end, we are our own worst enemy.”
If he could be in love with a suit, it would describe perfectly what he’s feeling right now. After all, the suit doesn’t
Nobody stops him when he opens the bottle. There’s laughter, and low murmuring. Especially when Clint starts introducing himself to the Sousas while holding his glass in his hand. Peter even notices Brunnhilde moving towards the bottle to fill her glass with actual alcohol this time.
“I mean, it’s not like they’re sad about it or anything,” Peter continues, starting up the next blow. “But yesterday when an old woman handed me money and I went to bring it to the homeless again, MJ was there and we talked.”
A gasp escapes from his throat. Hurriedly, he wets his lips and passes the sleeve of his shirt over it, willing for everything to be gone. His face hurts from all the rubbing, even coloring red itself because of it. But he’s clean now, so that’s good at least.
Peter doesn’t say anything else, but just stands up. He needs to go to the bathroom now, and not to pee or anything like that. Much to his surprise, he even finds Happy standing there, actually looking…
So Peter cites him the override code, and there’s another thrilling wave going through him after it’s finished.
“It’s mostly to do with getting up a certain frequency to which the particles in this fabric responds. One certain frequency will get it to loosen up, the other will pull it together,” Mr. Stark explains as he stands up and gets near Peter to observe his work. Then he takes his marker and starts writing things down on the shirt.
The doctors check him for a little while. There’s another blood sample, a look into his eyes and a quick check in his mouth. After that, they make sure his vitals are alright before they leave him alone again in the room.
Yaël saw something thrown down on the floor. As she climbed out of bed to reach for it, she immediately recognized what it was.
Only then does he remember why exactly it was a bad idea to be going along with the Cat in the first place.
It’s an unspoken agreement when they move it along. There’s preparation, there’s a lot of long stares and grunting. When Steve pushes inside, Tony almost cries it out. He puts his hands on Steve’s back, nails scratching his skin. Steve doesn’t seem to notice it; not when he’s feeling like he’s about to break apart like this.
Once she had tidied most of her stuff, she sat down on her sleeping bag and searched for some food in her backpack. The only still edible thing she had was some rice pudding, so rice pudding it was!
But Peter knows what’s going on. Steve is a fugitive. If they catch him, he’ll be locked up and they won’t speak. If he escapes, he’ll be a wanted man, and they won’t be able to speak, either. In any way, the chances of them being in contact in the future are close to zero…
“Are you Mary’s son?” The words escape from Tony’s mouth before he can think of it. The only person he knows of that has left his company to work for Oscorp is Mary, and that’s one person that he hasn’t heard of in a while. Probably because she completely shut herself off from his life. “Did she still marry that scientist? What was his name…? Richard?”
Peter makes another surprised sound, but it doesn’t even take him half as long as before to return the kiss with just as much enthusiasm.
“I realized I might have loved you, too,” she says as she grits her teeth together to fight back the tears. There’s a hollow chuckle coming out of her, her hand balling into a fist onto the table. “I was actually thinking about ending it with Richard. We weren’t exactly working out all that well, but…”
“Oh,” her friend thought for a minute. “So, are you planning on ever going back?” he asked her. She had told him the whole story, so he knew she wasn’t really welcome on her planet anymore, unless she was dead.
“You saw the message. That’s how you found out about Peter. He wouldn’t have been able to know, otherwise. Which then would mean that I would be dead, wouldn’t it?”
“Be careful, Scott, or he’s going to ask us to call him ‘Dr. Stark’ in the future and nobody wants that,” Rhodey jokes. Scott rolls his eyes and starts grumbling something before dropping his mug on the counter.
Instead, all he gets is warning from FRIDAY, telling him that multiple things have come up. Viewing her findings on Barnes’
“Her brain’s scrambled and she doesn’t remember a thing.” She remembered Steve, but he might not remember her anymore, she thought sadly.
Tony shudders, and so does Steve. The pair quickly give each other a look. Are they going to give in that easily? Are they surrendering just like that, without fighting for their dignity? Sure, it’s their own fault for going for a risky place to do their shit, but… Fuck this shit…
“Actually, it was a lot less complicated than it looked,” Peter says, trying not to make too much of a big deal out of it. Mr. Stark raises another eyebrow and then puts the reactor down again.
And Tony finally opens his mouth. He takes a deep breath, starts to speak. Steve blinks while he waits further. But then Tony stops and sags back in his seat, passing his hand over his face while turning away. And Steve’s heart aches even more. He lowers his head, eyes stuck on his twitching fingers, fumbling nervously.
“I used vibranium and other non-magnetic materials for it. In the worst case, the device could get irregulated, but I can easily hack back into it.” He shakes his head, glad that he thought about that, at least. “What can we expect next?”
“Hello, Mr. Stark,” one of the women says. She’s wearing a white coat over her dark blue scrubs. Her auburn hair is put up in a messy bun, and she looks somewhere in the thirty years old, though Tony can’t really tell right now so it could be forty as well. The look she’s giving makes it clear that she’s not here to mess around. Tony smiles at Pepper when she comes to sit next to him and allows her to grab his hand. It doesn’t hurt him anymore, being near her. It’s good, to be able to feel like they’re friends again. “I’m Dr. Palmer and I’m your physician today. How are you feeling at the moment?”
“I’m sure you guys can manage without me,” he says plainly. Dum-E comes rolling up to Steve, giving him a poke in the side to get his attention. “Rhodey’s back in town, isn’t he? Ask if he wants to fill in.”
Tony lets out a small sound, but is unable to form any words. When Peter’s standing in front of the elevator, he looks up to the ceiling.
After that, Peter lets go of Tony’s hands and the nurses continue on their way. May quickly turns towards Tony.
Peter’s heart is racing in his chest, his arms aching from the constant swinging. Venom seems to have favored a construction site for the showdown. Peter can see the web where MJ is currently stuck, high between the tops of two near towers. A fall like that would mean her death before she even gets to the ground.
“Experimental training,” the Cat responds. When there’s suddenly a sharp sting in Peter’s legs, he lets go of the chokehold. The Cat gasps for breath before getting back on her feet, holding up her hands in very loose fists. “You have a girlfriend?”
“Now, look what you did!” an Asgardian nurse mumbled, grabbing Yaël’s hand. Because Yaël had been too wild, the wound started bleeding through the patches again. She looked aside and saw her reflection in the wall-filling window that was filled with stars as the ship was still floating through space. Her throat and neck were purple and red and her complete leg and hip were patched up, just like her hand.
A young nurse passed to check on Yaël. As soon as the nurse noticed Loki, she started blushing and bumped against the side of the bed. With that, she quickly looked at Yaël’s wounds and hurried away again.
“Sorry, shouldn’t have said that… But c’mon Steve, I can’t let Peter go there alone! Can’t you see how nervous he is?” Steve glanced at Peter for a second. Yaël could swear she actually saw Peter shake a bit.
He knows the only reason he’s reacting this way is because he’s afraid somebody soon will tell him that he’s actually not that good of a dad. He’s really trying his best, but it’s hard to prove it when your son is already almost an adult once you get to know him.
“I want you to understand that you can’t be alone,” Steve says. Then Mr. Stark falls quiet, rolling his chair back a little bit. Peter watches it all happening in the corner of his eyes.
Right, he should go. He suits up again, flying away from the school to where he remembers Mary’s home to be. In his mind he prepares a quick message for Steve, to assure him that he’s found something. Just so that they know he’s on this.
“Just do it, please. He’s my friend,” Peter begs of her. FRIDAY doesn’t answer, but only opens up the door, giving Peter the chance to walk inside. Behind him, it closes again, locking him in this cell with the shadow of his former best friend.
Johnny! He puts down the fire, shakes his body a bit, and then waves at Peter. He hurries to the door to let him in, giving Johnny a wide smile. They might only know each other a couple of months, but it’s easy to say he’s already become one of Peter’s best friends. Sure, Ned and Harry are his best friends, too, but Johnny is actually the only one who goes out on patrol with him regularly.
The bag hits Miles’ face, but not painfully so. He rolls his eyes at the failure of catching it and opens up the bag, only to find what seems like the latest version of the Stark Phone in there.
“Wow, thanks,” Yaël answered sarcastically. She really didn’t ask for his help. It was Charles who asked him to ‘help her out a bit with drawing’. But instead of helping her out, Logan just grumpily walked in her territory, smacked the door behind him and immediately started belittling her. It was clear that the man wished he was somewhere else doing something more useful.
It’s only hallway into the movie that Tony realizes Peter has fallen asleep, pizza not even half finished. Tony frowns, leaning a bit to the side to reach for Peter’s sleeping form. When he gently starts to shake his shoulders, Peter jumps up in surprise, looking disoriented. His skin is wet from sweating.
“Oh mighty clothes, I will never, ever take you for granted again, this I promise,” Peter mutters to his clothing once he takes a couple of pieces into his hands. Taking out a white shirt and a dark grey coat to put above it, he drops them on his bed before grabbing a pair of dark jeans. He figures that, for the demonstration, he shouldn’t just come appearing there in his usual hoodie, after all.
“So, what, are you obliged to tell him about it because he’s your creator?” Peter asks, already fearing her answer.
“FRI, can you tell the others I’ll be a little longer because I need to help my Dad?” he asks. Tony stutters out another protest, but doesn’t actively try to stop him.
“Is there anything else I need to know to figure this out?” Peter asks. FRIDAY stays quiet, probably instructed by Mr. Stark not to help any further. Peter then just sighs and takes another look at the gauntlet.
he had said, and Peter had frowned and tried to ask what he meant, but never got a straight answer out of him.
Tony turns towards Natasha, blinking towards her. The room is silent again, all of them waiting to find out if Tony is going to allow Barnes inside or not. Eventually, Sharon steps his way and puts a hand on his shoulder.
No, said reaction won't be written out in this specific story. (reaction being: holy crap I hurt my boy in Leipzig)
Now, about twelve years later, Peter finds himself unbelieving of the fact that the person sitting in front of him is actually Harry Osborn. The kid who had been sent away to boarding school after his mother died, and had no possible way of contacting him afterwards. He looks different from when Peter last saw him.
“Oh, you want to have a honeymoon without the wedding?” Tony jokes. “Sure, we can arrange that. I’m sure Pepper wouldn’t mind me leaving the company for a few days.”
“You’re going to get it now,” he mutters. Tony turns around, clearing his throat, and waits for the woman who called after him to show herself.
“Need me to come along?” Rhodey asks, sounding worried. Tony gives him a quick look but then he sighs and shakes his head.
Is he shouting? He doesn’t even know. His whole body hurts, his fingers searching all over Peter’s neck, trying to find anything that might prove as a sign of life. But there’s nothing. Peter’s whole body is limp, lifeless.
Tony’s fuming when Peter is held in a choke hold, his legs swinging into the air as he tries to free himself.
, Tony’s head told himself when he unknowingly scanned everything happening around him. The suit had no tracker, that much he knew, but looking at Peter standing there he realized that what he was wearing was not what Tony made.
With his feet, Peter tries to struggle away from it. Damn it, how did Harry get so strong? What’s going on?
“Oh, uh, hi!” There he was, alive, but not really kicking. His eyes were red and his cheeks wet. He had clearly been crying. Yaël’s brain glitched a bit from receiving two mixed messages: 1) Peter isn’t falling down for eternity, 2) He was clearly unhappy. So all Yaël could think of to answer his awkward greet was: “You’ve been crying…”
“It’s alright, Tony. You’re hesitant because it’s so soon after Pepper, but she saw this coming. She won’t be angry at you for this.”
Suddenly, Peter’s cellphone goes off in the pocket of his jeans. Peter jumps up, feet still dangling dangerously over the edge of the roof. He doesn’t pull them back, but does fish out his phone, staring at the screen for a moment.
Goddammit, it’d better be the pope waiting for her, waking her up like that. After a few minutes, she had dug up wearable clothes and walked out of her room. Steve was making small-talk with…Peter? What was he doing here?
“Yes, that’s me,” Peter says, once more cursing his nonchalant way of talking. He sounds just like a messy teenager – which he
“I suppose it’s to bring up some family tradition Mr. Stark never had before,” Vision admits. Peter laughs again. After that they continue in silence, hearing a low murmur between Bruce and Tony. He could focus on what they’re saying, but he doesn’t really feel like invading their privacy.
Peter feels as if the ground is disappearing from under him. He doesn’t know how long it’ll be? What is he planning?
“I’ll take that into consideration,” he says in return. T’Challa just smiles, guiding him through the hallways until he gets to a place that looks mighty much like his office. Once inside, Tony is facing a massive window that gives a wonderful view of the nature outside.
“Nah, I’m fine for now. This has been enough information for now, man.” He shakes his head, still unbelieving of the fact that Harry had a freaking
,” he snaps back. The two give each other a long stare before Steve sighs, pushing the glass in front of Tony.
He’d been feeling alright in the morning. Now it’s noon, and he’s feeling about ready to lock himself back up in the workshop and not leave for the following week. Firstly, it’s been Peter’s first night at his apartment with Storm. Secondly, his mind is still full with
“Tony, you’re up?” Steve asks when he sees Tony standing there, wearing his dark tee and grey sweatpants, bare feet on the cold floor. Cap, in turn, is still in his uniform. There’s no obvious blood on him, just dirt and a few scrapes. Tony walks towards him without saying anything, but after two steps he stops himself.
“How about you open it, sport?” the man says, obviously having a few things in mind. Peter carefully stands up, leaving his breakfast for what it is and getting to the door.
At home, he’s already made sure to change all his clocks into digital ones. Aunt May had found it strange, but eventually she, too, seemed to have found the perks of simple clock-reading. At school, it had been easy to drown it out with ear-pieces put in, listening to quiet music while not paying attention. Other clocks only show the hours and minutes, keeping away from the seconds.
Anyway, this idea has been plagueing me for a little while, and then suddenly today I came accross this incorrect quote which I felt would be just perfect for this situation. Long story short, it's another incorrect quote, but it's not like the other chapters of that genre!
“Her powers are very shifty, I’ve seen her sick before and with just a flu she managed to burst a window.” Steve rubbed his eyes.
Pepper had left the tower after that, going back to the newly-rebuilt Mansion in Malibu. Happy stayed with her, per Tony’s request partly, but also because he’s now Pepper’s head of security.
A quick turnaround, and Tony finds that Pepper is still standing there, having closed the door behind her after the last member of the board has walked off. Her fair hair is put up neatly, her make-up done so professionally Tony would almost think she’s about to head to a photoshoot.
Vision reminds him too much of JARVIS to try that. The only two he’d consider telling this two are Nat and Steve, and while everything inside him is telling him to go for the latter, his brain is warning him that, no, he should tell Nat. She will know what the best course of action will be.
It’s a small relief when the gun suddenly flies past him. It means he won’t be shot at anymore. But, distracted as he is, he lands against a stone mailbox. With it breaking from the impact, Peter can’t help but let go of his webs. He sees the car drive away, and an attempt to stick himself to the other door fails when it breaks.
This story is definitely going to be the last in the verse. I'm not going to write a third part. It was surprisingly hard for me to write this one due to my internship and my constant dreading for Infinity War. But the story's never completely over. Unless I've decided otherwise, the timestamps will continue. I have more to tell about these characters, just not enough to make another whole story about it.
“What are you trying to tell me, Steve?” Tony asks, turning around to face Steve again. The other man gives him a light smile, kissing him quickly on the forehead before pulling back.
“Are you sure you want to move into an apartment, Peter? It’s not like you’re far away from us, after all.”
“FRI, what’s going on?” Tony whispers out, not wanting to attract attention to himself. Especially in the hallways of a hotel, where a couple of the guests are also making their way to the elevator.
“It wasn’t a loan,” Tony states, again. May ignores it. She refuses to accept the large sum of money he’s offered her and keeps on claiming that she will pay him back one day. Peter already knows Tony won’t accept that money back, in return.
And yeah, about that… he has never really stopped to wonder what that’s all about? His mother’s journals? Did she leave anything behind in Oscorp? That woman explained that they were cleaning unused safes and that hers was one of them, but how have those not been retrieved back when she was reported dead?
“What are you even doing here? How did you get here?” Yaël asked not quite friendly as she tried to get up, but that movement send a sting of pain through her whole body, which made her give in immediately, like the pain was electrocuting her.
“Hey! Don’t be a jerk, Rogers!” Tony quickly yells at him. Then Steve, without warning, lifts Tony up from the ground and throws him over his shoulder. Tony starts to kick his legs (gently) in an attempt to break free, but he’s unsuccessful.
“All she would say was  ‘Tony… I made a mistake…’ and whatever else vague, followed by the request that nobody ever mentions him again. And he tried to call, even showed up at her house once, drunk, to try and talk, but her request was clear.”
Peter smiles, feeling fondness when he realizes that his Dad is keeping his creations. Especially when he sees the forgotten project of his bot somewhere there as well. He should finish it one day!
“Peter, what’s going on?” Tony asks, suddenly scared for his answer. He can only guess what Peter might be doing, and he hates the idea of it.
“He’s the one who searched you out, isn’t he?” Steve asks, putting a hand behind Tony’s head. “He went through all this trouble to find you. I’m sure he wants you in his life, Tones.”
But Peter knows he can’t do that; if Mr. Stark would go to Dr. Cho about it, she would recognize Peter’s altered blood immediately. Other doctors would be fascinated by it, and research it further. They would know that Peter isn’t exactly a hundred percent human, but slightly spider as well. He can’t have the secret spreading further.
“Yeah, no…I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge. I just felt so guilty, I’ve been carrying him around the entire time.” Brunnhildesubtly put her hand over her mouth to cover her disgust. Even Yaël felt her stomach turning. How wasn’t the whole spaceship covered in a corpse-stank yet?
The walls started collapsing out of memory-Yaël’s anger, but real Yaël’s sudden shaking vision and the sudden explosion of buzzing in her ears beard her down again. Professor X ran towards her. Grabbing her hand, doing everything he could to calm her down again. Once Yaël could breathe in a normal rhythm, he helped her to stand up again.
Might be better, anyway. The tower is probably evacuated during the attack – and whatever was that about, anyway? It seems a bit foolish of Harry to attack the minute he’s out, right? Or maybe they’ve been chasing him the moment he got out? He wonders if he would be allowed to join the briefing to find out, but they’ve never asked him to join; that would mean he isn’t allowed, right?
Holy, cow! She totally forgot about Bucky. It was a sacred secret between her, Barnes and Steve. Her cheeks turned red as she snorted. X raised an eyebrow and smiled.
I realize that, with my internship, it's possible that I might not get this done until the 25th, but I'll try my best for the American release date! Sadly, I won't be able to see the movie when it comes out, but hopefully upcoming saturday I'll see it!
“Just focus on my voice,” Peter says as if he’s read Tony’s mind. The man nods, holding out his hand until it’s touching Peter’s. He squeezes his fingers, feeling Peter squeeze in return. Good, that means it’s real. He hovers forward, following Peter. “Good, you’re doing good.”
The window probably wouldn’t help at all, because it only led to a small alley with garbage bins. And that wasn’t to speak about the lights, which were just as useless. Most of them didn’t even work! And the ones that did gave enough light for Yaël to find her bed, which consisted of two mattresses placed on each other, at night. Luckily it was day now, so the window above her bed let in enough light to provide her whole room.
