"My dad used to wear contacts a lot of the time though," the angel muttered, leaning back a little, encouraging Dean to draw back into his previous seated position. "Purple and gold's not exactly inconspicuous."
"Wait,
It was probably the first time Dean had ever been more scared of John than any of the monsters he'd been told about.
Dean rubbed at the back of his neck with his free hand, watching as Castiel began to tie a knot with the plastic handles. If Cas’s tone was anything to go by, Dean had addressed a sensitive subject – a moderately more sensitive subject than the whole angel ideal in itself addressed – and he felt the guilt twist through his chest, knowing that once again, he’d fucked up.
But he was excited by it.
"That doesn't have anything to do with our powers."
Castiel seemed to be watching him with a certain air of caution as he altered his position, and Dean rolled his eyes, his face heating up again as he headed to the bathroom. At least whilst he showered he could have some sort of closure for a couple of minutes, even if that was totally contradictory of what he actually wanted because
The demon was quiet for a few seconds, his actions stalling for just as long. “I think Rufus put some sigils 'round the house or something. I can’t leave yet.”
He wasn't used to feeling this amount of concern for anyone other than himself and it did make him reconsider everything going through his head because he'd only known Dean a few weeks and this
"Twenty percent."
But Dean
body; but her appearance wasn't the reason why Dean liked her, so the size of her boobs wasn't something that drew him to the character anyway.
Dean cocked his head to the side, watching the purple in Castiel's eyes lighten.
He instead turned his attention to Bobby who was already finishing off his first glass.
"And once I heal this person, I can go?"
“You don’t need to apologise, Dean. It was very kind of you to offer to cook me a meal at all,” Castiel said honestly, bumping their shoulders together. “Thank you for this.”
He tilted the angel toward him again when Castiel kept silent, wiping at the cut carefully so the guy wouldn't chance at cracking his head open again. It was different this time with the angel watching, eyes focused on every damn movement like he was dead set on working the truth out of him. Dean was trying his hardest not to look anywhere other than the injury, but Castiel's gaze was burning his face.
It wasn't that Castiel desired intimacy or anything of the sort because in all honesty, as arrogant as it was, he'd never had an issue finding a willing partner at a bar in the past. No, it was the permanence he wanted. One night stands were alright for the most part, aside from the times Castiel had drunk himself into a state of darkness which had ultimately eradicated any memory of his original intent, thus rendering it pointless; but he didn't want to have to leave as early as he could to prevent having to explain himself or engage in awkward conversation.
Dean was quiet for a little while, and Castiel wandered over to the spare bed, seating himself on the edge of the mattress. It was far more comfortable than the futon Castiel had made for himself back home, but this wasn't constructed from dead foliage and childhood clothing so it wasn't all that surprising.
what you're concerned about?!" Dean cried out, his shadow splaying across the floor uncontrollably, knocking the table and chairs into the corner of the room. "I just told you dad wanted to do something
Dean lifted his hand from the sheets, drawing a ring behind his own head. “The halo thing you’ve got …” He trailed off when Castiel got to his feet abruptly to head to the bathroom, the angel almost tripping as he swerved the end of the bed. Dean drew his legs back onto the mattress so he could follow Castiel with his eyes, alarmed by the speed at which Castiel had moved. “Cas?”
Fleeting relationships were the only things that existed outside of familial connections within the hunting community, and Dean expected it to be a hell of a lot more difficult to make and maintain friendships when you couldn't even leave to meet up with anyone all that frequently.
"A very important experiment," Castiel insisted, looking back down to the boy's palm, dragging a finger over the healed skin. "Ta-da."
The shot sounded in the air and Castiel simply stood still, watching as the bullet was suspended amidst a black mass whilst the demon wrestled the gun from the man’s hands with the rest of his shadow, gathering up some towels from the floor as it flared across the wooden boards.
He was about to voice as such when the shrill noise of Dean's phone cut through the air, and suddenly the boy was scrabbling forward as he drew it from the pocket of his jeans, fumbling and cursing as he went to answer.
He stared down at the wounds in a daze for a few moments before healing the cuts completely, feeling rather agitated.
it was disgust. The way Cas had talked about demons before had Dean feeling kinda privileged to know that the angel was alright with
And he knew Bobby wouldn't talk about it either.
The boy's hand stilled, the wipe resting at an awkward angle against his wound, and he squirmed, shuffling forward a little so it didn't hurt as much.
Dean was just grateful Sam was a hell of a lot more liberal than their dad was, regardless of the excessive amount of angel-related myths they'd grown up believing. Sam had never been afraid to question the reliability of John's stories, even if their dad had seen that as more of an ignorant charm than anything else. It was what Dean was relying on though. He hoped Sam would still be open-minded when it came to meeting an
Driving wasn’t really his area of expertise, but it was easier than walking, and although he was slow in terms of the pace he set, he was being safe. He needed to be.
don’t tell me you’re gonna make me practice with a knife before letting me come with you.”
“Go ‘way,” the boy grumbled, shoving at Castiel’s wrist pathetically before trying to roll over again, and Castiel let him, biting back his laugh at the sound of the thump and the quiet ‘fuck’ muffled against the wooden floorboards.
Obviously, it wasn’t the best way to go about living his life, but as soon as he had a more suitable method to keep himself housed, things could go back to normal. Once John realised that Sam was better, things would be fine, and yes, it might take him a while before he understood Dean’s reasoning behind it, but it wasn’t like Dean was doing it to spite him. He was being sensible; not weak or pathetic. He was saving them.
"Hey," he voiced, encouraging Sam to look across at him. "You wanna go for a walk or something?"
Dean would … he’d apologise properly when he wasn’t bleeding out over the carpet.
The blade returned to hover beside Castiel’s right forearm when the angel crouched to lay the remains on the floor, smoothing out his shirt as he straightened up again, throwing Dean a quizzical look.
“You’ve been nice enough to let me stay, I’m not taking your b-”
! You were being so fucking stubborn and it was infuriating and I just needed to
He looked at himself in the mirror, scowling further at the sight of the dog collar. He really should be grateful he'd been allowed to even leave the room, but clearly the boy was new to hunting otherwise he'd be a little more relaxed than he was. His stance almost looked awkward, and his expression somewhat unsure, and Castiel looked him up and down again before turning fully away from the mirror to hold out his hands so they could be re-cuffed. He figured that the sooner he looked as if he was giving up, the easier it would be to catch the demon off guard, and with his Grace compressed and growing stronger, that possibility was fast approaching.
"He'll be okay," the boy grinned, looking back at Sam. "Well, he'll be a lot more accepting than I was anyway."
animals on a regular basis because of it, as opposed to the odd rabbit every other week or so. It was frustrating how nothing ever seemed to go in his favour.
i hope everyone has a happy easter, and i apologise again for my inability to meet deadlines.
The demon threw him a dirty look before facing away with a scowl.
“Will you need to borrow a weapon, Dean, or did you collect something to use whilst you were at your uncle’s?”
The bubble of water was dropped into the pot, left to boil over the fire pit in the centre of the room whilst he went about cutting up the vegetables and separating the scraps for the broth. He didn't like to waste anything, and he planned to take the remains from
And for him to find himself
The boy grinned at him, leaning back on his elbows almost in a state of mockery, and Castiel shoved at him harshly as he turned away, not failing to miss the sharp intake of breath from being knocked back against the hard surface. He didn’t know what the hell was wrong with him, but he’d found himself able to injure the demon several times now, even with the deal in place. Part of him wanted to risk genuinely punching the boy, but he didn’t want the damage to recoil if it worked as usual, so rather than harming him, he encouraged one of the kitchen drawers to fly open when the demon came relatively close.
One. Two. Three.
Dean smiled at him, small as it was, and Castiel outstretched an arm when he noticed the expectancy in Dean's gaze, rolling his eyes and stepping forward. "C'mere."
The demon’s absence was in no way alarming, and Castiel grimaced as he straightened up in posture, craning his neck to examine the blood stain on the back of his shirt and frowning further at the new dampness that had begun to soak through. He’d worsened the condition of the wound when he’d sat up before, and even though he was numbing the pain with his Grace, there was still a certain stinging sensation surrounding the injury. He didn’t want to waste all of his energy on his own injuries when he would only be expected to heal someone else, and he still hadn’t been informed of the severity of such an illness so he didn’t know how much Grace he’d actually require. It would be very unfortunate if he went to heal them and end up unable – especially when that would most likely result in him appearing as if a liar, the deal abandoned as some other demon bled him out instead. He wanted to get out of this alive, and if it meant putting up with the same irritable pain for a further twenty-four hours, then he would endure it.
Castiel looked to the ceiling, eying up the beam. He could feel that it was close, the weight of the wood resting on three of the nails completely whilst the others hung limp in the frame, teetering slightly as if they would fall any second. It creaked and groaned as the mass was distributed on the remaining sliver of metal, bending them out of place as Castiel came to a stop to the right hand side of where it was situated above him, screaming at the nails with his Grace to will it loose.
Dean tore his gaze away for a moment, focussing on the headboard again. Castiel's injuries had to have been pretty bad if his glow had reduced to nothing in Sam's prediction. It had Dean wondering why the guy would even protect him in the first place. Dean wasn't worth getting hurt over, and he hadn't thought that they'd actually ever meet up. He'd been given Cas's number so he could have someone to talk to, but the thought of Cas spending time with him made him kind of ... excited? He knew he shouldn't have been, given that Cas was gonna end up getting hurt because of him, but he'd liked the angel. Getting to see him again would be great!
He’d watched television on occasion as a child, but since he started hunting, all it did was depress him. He
Castiel threw one of the pink packets at the boy's chest before facing away completely, not wanting to have to look at the child whilst he went about it. He knew the boy was right in terms of caring for it properly, knowing full well that he himself would be unable to clean the new damage when he couldn't even see what he was doing. He still wasn't sure if he'd taken care of it properly the first time, but he'd been able to bathe so at least the skin surrounding the wound had been sufficiently cleaned of all dried blood.
There was a lot going through Castiel's mind that he was struggling to put into words, overcome with relief and incredibly embarrassed by the situation he'd found himself in. Dean was as animated as ever, practically bouncing around in a way that Castiel had surprisingly missed. It made him feel slightly overwhelmed, but he embraced the moment as best he could, genuinely happy that Dean hadn't, in fact, been killed on a hunt or anything of the sort.
it was wrong to think about what would have happened, whether it would have been good or bad. Castiel had done his job.
Castiel was confused, but he shook his head slowly. "No."
But Cas deserved a chance. Sure, he may be lying, but an explanation wasn't gonna hurt - and anyway, that kind of information could be useful regardless.
They'd watched 'In Bruges' a while back and thought the town in that film was so fucking cool. Neither of them spoke anything other than English (although Dean did try to teach them both some Spanish a few years ago) but there were plenty of tourist-y places out there - like Bruges - that they could still visit without being completely clueless.
Castiel didn’t say anything back, the bathroom door left slightly ajar, with nothing but the faint glow of Castiel’s natural light reflecting off the few bathroom tiles Dean had sight of.
He had to push the bookcase to the side to find it, but the sigil was stark against the wallpaper, the blood still damp as Dean scratched a fingernail down the centre to render it useless. Taking a step back, he looked to Castiel's slouched figure. "You come across this kind of trap before?"
The older man didn't reply, simply turning to head through to the kitchen where he proceeded to set the kettle up to boil on the stove.
not gonna work. Hell, part of the plan had been getting his dad to actually let Cas heal Sam without going behind his back or anything, but he should have known better than to run something like that past him
He watched the pink in the sky turn purple, chewing on his lower lip. It was exhausting to try and think about something else, and he didn't have much else to distract him, so when he heard the quiet beep of his cell phone from where he'd left it inside, he clambered down from the ledge to go grab it in a matter of seconds.
That's when Dean noticed it.
But Dean had already taken the dishes to the sink by that point, and although Castiel had followed pursuit a few seconds later, he should have expected ahead of time that Dean would simply bat him away, an arm stretching out to block Castiel’s path to the sink.
"This is
"But he needs me! I need to look after him a-and I fucking can't!" The demon blurted, and Castiel froze at the first touch of the shadow to his thighs, the dark essence twining around his legs in a way that he sincerely hoped was unintentional. He shut his eyes as he tried to distract himself, curving a hand round the back of the kid's head to stroke through his hair, trying to calm him down before the shadow went wandering any higher. He knew the demon probably wasn't even paying attention to what his shadow was doing in the first place, but it still didn't help matters and it was starting to make Castiel feel more than just a little claustrophobic.
But still, it circulated in his thoughts, causing him to fidget and find a more comfortable position in his bedding. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly, irritated by his inability to cease the feeling of longing. He didn't understand it nor did he understand why it was so prominent now, of all times. This was a feeling he hadn't experienced in over eight years.
get it! When I tried to tell
meeting had definitely been out of pity, Dean was grateful Cas had shown up anyway. He'd never stayed up late talking with anyone other than Sam, and it had been nice being able to discuss things with someone who didn't really have the same interests.
Castiel pulled a face, struggling to stand up. "I have a duty as a hunter to help people, Dean. Every hunt is a risk."
I literally have no words. I've waited years for this and yes I will admit I cried a lil' bit in excitement, but yeah. I'm pretty happy right now.
Dean didn’t know many hunters that had been able to maintain that same chipper attitude toward life since they’d started down the hunting route, so Dean completely understood why the expressions Castiel wore these days were considerably more subdued and dark. There were moments where Dean had seen something a lot more vibrant light up Castiel’s features, but he found it kinda difficult to make the angel laugh so anything he had witnessed was brief - almost in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it kind of way.
The line went completely dead but Castiel didn't move. He stiffened, unable to keep his eyes from running over the blood-covered boy that appeared in the middle of his motel room. His arm fell to his side slowly, his hold on his phone going lax.
Now that he could see where the sigils were, it wouldn’t be difficult at all to remove them.
His eyes went to Cas’s face when the guy’s head jerked, taking in the furrowed brow and the sheen on his forehead; a look of real pain that he recognized as similar to that of Sam’s fevers, but since Cas could heal illness and stuff, did that mean it was something else?
"Yes, well, I'll be awake again in a few hours to give you your bed back," Castiel muttered, running his eyes over the boy's posture. He couldn't tell if the boy himself was tired or anything of the sort, but the kid had clearly had an early start to the day if he'd come down to the basement so soon in the morning anyway. It wasn't like Castiel would be able to stay asleep for any longer than usual, and given the fact that the clock in the kitchen had read four in the afternoon, Castiel knew he'd be awake by at least ten. He'd just sit in the other room or something whilst the boy slept, unless of course, the boy allowed him to go outside for a while - perhaps even permit him to go home. That would make the whole grocery thing a lot easier, and with the amount of energy Castiel now had stored, he'd easily be able to fly home and back without relying on his Grace too much.
was wrong, regardless of their youth and ignorance, and he should have learnt after working for Crowley that they were all absolute fucking liars.
"Oh. Are you sure? I don't mind doing it."
"Have to admit, even if it's for something like that, I'm still pretty honoured to be considered your favourite person," Cas stated. "It's cute. Thank you."
“But I’m making you anxious?”
Okay, that thought didn't help matters. Not after what Sam had said before.
"You always ... you look at me differently when they change. I think ..."
"Now, I know you might be slightly upset, but I have something of a ... business proposition," Crowley began, an obvious smile to his voice. "I was hoping we could meet."
Castiel turned, grabbed Dean by the front of his shirt, and pulled harshly.
Dean immediately swerved into the room with the vamp he’d dismembered, letting his shadow stretch further to where the figure had emerged to track its movements. He knew Cas had headed in that general direction, but it was hard to differentiate between the two separate movements when the angel had gotten close to the creature so quickly, so Dean didn’t exactly want to go blindly attacking them both on the off-chance he’d get the wrong monster.
to practice on anyone else, mostly because he didn't actually know what it was he was doing to the animal he was interacting with.
Long before the demons called Mary soft for prioritising family over the hunting community.
Castiel closed his eyes, breathing in the fresh air as he listened to the gentle sound of the small waterfall opposite. It felt so good to be surrounded by nature again - the nature he was familiar with. He would always prefer this area, even if it did have its limitations.
“Look, it’s fine. He can’t get in this room whilst I’m here, and if I block the doorway off before I go downstairs you’ll b-“
Dean crouched down to pet the dog on the head when it came rushing back over, murmuring a 'good boy' before he threw the ball again. He straightened up, pursing his lips as he stretched, looking up at the sky. He didn't know how long it'd take before it'd get properly dark out here, but he could remember the last time he and Sam had been stupid enough to let the dog run loose in the dark and he didn't want to end up crawling beneath a goddamn car to try and persuade Rumsfeld that it wasn't the safest place to sleep.
Was … that why John didn’t show up? So Castiel wouldn’t recognise him?
He tapped the table with his fingers absent-mindedly as he glanced around him, heading off back toward the bar's front entrance when he spotted the sign to the left of it.
"Cas?" Dean tried, moving forward quickly to check up on the guy. "What the fuck just happened?"
He actually just hoped that if something bad
“And where are the conscious ones?”
"Dude, just go to sleep. I don't really give a shit if I have to sleep on the floor or not."
idea what you've done?!"
Cas was great. Like, awesome. He was a nice enough guy and Dean liked talking to him - but that was normal, right? Liking someone for being nice?
Castiel was trying not to be offended by the topic at hand, and it was because of this that Castiel didn't particularly want to pry into Dean's business any further and ask about other specifics the boy's uncle may have mentioned, even if said information was wrong. There were abilities that he didn't know anything about, and he didn't want to seem like a liar for evading or answering questions wrong when he didn't even understand what it was he was actually being asked.
Dean kept silent for a few moments, leading Castiel to believe that something bad had been mentioned. He was actually rather frightened to ask who Dean's uncle was in case it made things difficult between the boy and himself, and it only added to Castiel's concern knowing that Dean could have easily been encouraged to approach him in the bar in the first place.
their family hunted.
"Sammy? Just turned twelve," the boy said slowly before he fell quiet, and Castiel couldn’t help but feel rather disappointed. The boy in his dreams was in that region of age, but they’d remained the same ever since the nightmares had started up four years ago. Nevertheless, he opened his eyes lazily to show the demon he was still listening, observing the way in which the child twisted a corner of the blanket in his right hand. "Couldn't even take him out for his birthday. Poor kid was too weak to get out of bed."
Admittedly, it made Castiel rather jealous. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had time free of work, unless the days he was rendered jobless could be considered anything like a vacation.
They finished their food in silence, but even when they were done, Castiel was surprised to find that Dean was still intent on doing everything on his behalf. The bowl was taken from his hands before he'd even had a chance to respond to the 'you done with that?' Dean threw in his general direction, his words coming out as a garbled mess when he finally managed to give his thanks.
"I did say as much," Castiel hummed, and Dean let himself smile again at the familiar tone, pacing himself so he and Cas could continue to walk side by side.
He stepped to the side so he could lower Sam to the floor as carefully as he could, sitting down beside him on the soft ground and leaning back on his hands, watching as the kid sat up in a similar position.
"Fucking weirdo," Castiel murmured softly, resting his temple against the side of Dean's head.
He wasn't expecting the backhanded slap to his face, and he yelped, hastily pressing a palm to his cheek to ease the pain.
"Ridiculous? You shot me and tried to slit my fucking throat!"
Dean walked for what felt like hours, simply rerunning the prior events in his mind. He knew it was stupid, and it only made him feel worse the longer he went about it, but he wanted to call Cas, and if he called Cas then he’d be asked a bunch of questions about everything that’d happened and he wanted to have a decent answer.
He reached to dab at the angel's lip again when he heard the distinct rumble, and he couldn't help but smirk, "Did someone skip out on breakfast?"
was the child; like
It wasn't anything Castiel wanted to get involved in, not that his opinion would be appreciated should he voice his concerns. He doubted the rest of the demon's family was as peculiar as the boy was himself, more so given the fact that his father had been the one intending Castiel's murder.
Part of him wanted to just head off to a cooler place for a while, like to somewhere in Europe for a few hours. He'd already been checking up on the weather forecasts around France to see if it'd be worthwhile looking around now that he had some time to himself, but he felt guilty at the thought of up-and-leaving Bobby for such a random trip.
He stood up abruptly at the sound of the bar door swinging open, looking back over his shoulder as music flooded out of the building along with a dim blanket of light, and he was forced backwards suddenly, Dean's shadow curling over him in a tall dome-like shape. Castiel froze for a moment, but he could hear someone else calling Dean's name and he encouraged his Grace to conceal him in an instant, watching Dean take a few steps back toward the bar's entrance.
"I'll talk to you whenever you like," Cas said softly, petting Dean's uninjured shoulder before picking up the basket again. "Now get your priorities sorted and take me to see your brother."
"Sweet dreams, Psylocke."
It was a struggle: choosing whether or not he should start healing immediately over numbing the area itself. It was apparent that Bobby had passed out from the agony and Castiel wasn’t ready to bear the brunt of such a thing when he was barely even halfway through the entire healing process. The actual pain he was feeling through the man wasn’t like anything he’d actually experienced before, and it varied considerably from the sensations he’d encountered whilst healing Sam, open wounds aside. There was a heat to it that had him squirming in his seat, his breathing restricted as he absorbed the damage. The energy was unusually heavy in his veins and he ceased the healing abruptly, pushing away in an attempt to stand.
Age had nothing to do with it. There were a few things about the demon's situation that he could relate to and it wasn't fair of the child to give up what he'd clearly used as a bed the night prior, even if Castiel himself would prefer to sleep on the couch than the floor, but who wouldn't? It was assuredly more comfortable than a granite or wooden flooring.
, and more
Castiel grinned, jostling it a little as he balanced it against his hip. "This you thinking I look weak again?"
No, Dean didn't want to think about the fact that this could have all been a ploy. Castiel had nothing to gain by manipulating his feelings or any of that shit.
to include scars.
Dean blinked a few times, squinting through the darkness at Castiel’s glowing form. “You alright, dude?” He questioned groggily, following up with a yawn. “What time is it?”
"What?"
Her expression didn't change, causing Dean to laugh harder when she sat there staring at him like he'd just said something super offensive.
“No. I'm tired and have no interest in talking to you,” Castiel sighed, tipping his head back so it rested against the cupboards. He’d hardly gotten any sleep before and his back was burning again. He really was starting to consider cleaning the wound whilst he remained here, just to make things less painful. “And you still haven’t phoned whoever it was to arrange tomorrow. I’d prefer it if you didn’t leave such a task until last minute.”
"You okay?" He asked, his voice cracking, and the angel laughed brokenly, the sound deep and rattling and not at all fucking healthy.
He trailed down to the left, pushing his way through the low-hanging branches as he approached the second clearing: the one nearest the rock face. There was a third clearing just a short way down to the right where Castiel usually set his traps. Catching animals was another way to keep himself alive, and they provided much more nutrition than a simple can of baked beans and some bread, but it wasn’t often that he caught them. A lot of preparation was needed to actually make the animals into food, even if it was useful to smoke and salt certain meats for preservation. He usually did the hunting in the first few weeks of autumn in order to stock up for winter, in addition to buying as much fruit and vegetables as he could with his pay. Jams were simple enough to make, and they provided him with a small amount of energy in addition to their sweet tastes. He usually made soups and broths out of the vegetables, freezing them with his Grace to preserve them in the cavern walls. It was fairly easy to heat them up in the winter months, and again, it was far healthier than tinned and ready-made products.
"Perhaps in the colder months," Castiel told him, drawing out the beer in the form of a small bubble. "It's not that reliable during the summer."
Dean blundered, and Castiel looked at the boy again, surprised to find him staring back from where his cheek rested on Castiel's shoulder. His blush had become far more obvious and his eyes were as bright as they always seemed to be, but Castiel hadn't really taken in anything else the last time he'd viewed the boy at such a close range.
The boy pulled a face, but he picked up a case of El Sol regardless, continuing on down the aisle. "Dad lets me drink, so I don't see the problem with getting beer for myself."
“And you're how old exactly? Even Bobby uses the internet and he's in his 50's.”
“What the
All the older man seemed to care about was making Dean feel like his opinion didn't matter, because he was apparently too young and inexperienced to trust his moral compass.
But he didn’t exactly want to go passing comments because Cas seemed to be going through some kind of mood swing and had started being a grumpy asshole all over again, so Dean simply sat down a short distance away on the same beam, watching for any kind of change in the angel’s appearance – hopefully, a positive one. He’d liked how
"I get pissed because you never fucking shut up," Castiel stated dryly, rising to his feet, and Dean scrambled to follow, stumbling as he made his way out the door. "The conversations are interesting enough, but you talk so damn fast and I don't understand half of what you go on about."
“Everyone gets into hunting somehow,” the older man offered blandly, looking off into the corner of the room.
“I-I really am so sorry to drag you into this.”
The bullet pierced the boy’s forehead, a spattering of blood scoring the mildew-ridden walls of the basement, and the body sagged, dropping gracefully to the floor. It was the most merciful death he could give the child, and he almost felt pitiful, wondering what it would have been like if he’d permitted to let the boy live.
Dean let out a heavy breath on the other end of the line, and Castiel frowned, shifting his phone to his other ear so he could trace a hand along the rock face.
But Dean needed to be honest. Bobby was bound to be pissed at him for keeping in contact with Cas anyway, and bringing him to the fucking house probably didn't sit right with the guy either. Dean didn't know much how much Rufus had told the older man, but it was all gonna come to light eventually and he didn't want to make things any worse than they already were.
The angel might be muscular, but that glow of his was nothing to write home about. It was weak, and pretty pathetic, in all honesty.
"Sit up," he demanded, tearing open the girly packet with his teeth.
That’s where the conscious ones were.
“Take it off,” he growled. “Take it off me now!”
Dean strolled over to the kitchenette to run his wound under the tap, flinching under the stream of cold water. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, even as he watched his own blood swirl down the drain.
He looked to the mirror as he wiped the blood from his chin, scowling at the blatant discolouration of his facial features. He was surprised that the sickness had already had such a profound effect on his form when he'd been tackling it for no longer than ten minutes.
to pay for those kind of things, so that was definitely one less thing to worry about.
something. Knowing what he knew now from reading the bestiaries, he would obviously stay well out of Castiel’s way, but he was definitely more than a little curious about Castiel’s actual sparring techniques. He’d been a little bit too taken aback by Cas pinning him to the floor to really … to …
Castiel snorted but did as he was asked, even if the light wasn’t even at full intensity. It may have just been closer to the boy in comparison to himself, but it wasn’t like Castiel needed it to see anymore. He had the natural light of his Grace to ensure at least a little clarity whilst he stayed seated, even if it barely compared with the orb he'd used prior.
The only thing was, Cas said he'd been resting ever since he got back home.
The energy surged out of him – the power he had no control over – forcing Castiel away and tugging the chain from Dean’s grip. He didn’t imagine the cry of agony as Castiel knocked into the thick wooden pillar, or the way his body slumped to the floor; he didn’t imagine the choking sounds or the watery look in his eyes, blood dripping from Castiel’s lips and collar onto the floorboards, and the panic that flitted across his features.
"You'll only waste time by arguing," Castiel insisted, walking around him, apparently not needing any help whatsoever.
“This is fucking
"W-what?"
Not only that, but Dean shouldn’t have even been daring to do something like this in the first place. He couldn’t use the excuse that he was scared because he wasn’t anymore. He was
Dean transported himself outside again, a short distance away from the angel to avoid startling him too much.
and all.”
The thought of going travelling without Sam was almost holding him back though. Whilst Dean would love to make the most of his freedom, it just wouldn't be the same if Sam wasn't there to see everything with him. They hadn't made verbal promises or anything, but Dean felt like going alone would almost be betraying the kid, given just how much they'd talked about what the rest of the world had to offer.
Dean also knew he
He let out a heavy breath, finally acknowledging the lack of any sensation in his left arm. It
The boy rolled his lips between his teeth, eyes flicking up to meet Castiel's own momentarily. "Not much. He just talked about angels in general," the demon offered, dropping the old antiseptic wipe to the floor so he could open up the new packet. "But the stories he told us - about the angels he'd met with in the past - always made you guys sound like wise old men."
He did feel a sense of regret for letting those kinds of thoughts cross his mind again. He liked Dean. Or rather, he liked who Dean was at the moment. Depending on whether or not the kid got dragged back into hunting by his father, that was subject to change.
“Oh, ummm … he’s the 2nd of May.”
"And like
"I'm not fussy. I'm just too tired to really contribute all that much right now."
Because Bobby knew that Sam was fully recovered from ... from whatever it was that was fucking him up, and he also knew that it hadn't cost a single life to get those results. Given the fact that he had all this new information, surely Bobby would have been more onboard with the idea of preserving angels as opposed to covering up the fact that John had tried to harvest from one.
It was a weird situation he’d found himself in though: comfortable with his own vulnerability when the boy was with him. The fact that he’d even been able to befriend someone so surprisingly unprejudiced and considerate had initially been a rather jarring realisation, but he was warming to the idea of spending more time with Dean outside of a hunt-related setting purely because the boy was, at the end of the day, a truly goodhearted person.
"Ah, Castiel," Crowley began enthusiastically, momentarily rising from his chair. "Please, do take a seat."
But this was cute. Dean meant that sincerely. He’d seen Castiel smile, but the smile the angel shared with him was softer.
try to fight back, he could end up passing out and make things even worse.
They continued around the store with little conversation, the demon taking very few things for himself, and it wasn't until Castiel found himself facing the shelves of alcohol that he felt inclined to say anything important.
Well. It was something along those lines anyway.
"Not really. No," Castiel told him, coughing. "Might have fucked up my back again."
The words hurt more than Dean expected and he felt his cheeks redden in embarrassment, his hands falling to his lap. It wasn't exactly a specific answer, but he knew from the way it had been put that they'd insulted the older man with their attempts to hide the truth.
Dean rolled up the canvas bag hastily, locking away the papers and instruments so he could put it to the side and forget about it. They shouldn’t have even had a kit like that – it was wrong and terrifying, and the mere thought of an entire species being hunted down for some false misunderstanding really did make him feel sick. But that’s all it was: some utter idiot thinking that angel blood was more useful than the fucking creature it came from – because surely they would have thought to
for Christ’s sake!
Dean had protection now. He didn't need to worry about anything else until he was actually faced with a threatening situation.
But he was getting off track.
different to how it had six fucking seconds ago!
going to hate you," Castiel said sternly as the demon practically seated himself in his lap, the boy's arms loosening when Castiel rubbed at his back a few more times, unsure of how he could even go about making the demon relaxed.
He’d never had this queried before. He’d actually never even had to discuss it. When he had teamed up with others in the past, he had always followed their orders, not wanting to cause any conflict by suggesting otherwise.
proved that Cas meant no harm.
Castiel's brow furrowed as he read through the message again. That ... well, it wasn't as concerning as he'd thought it'd be, but he still felt bad for not replying sooner. Dean had probably been expecting a reply quite some time ago, and Castiel felt incredibly bad to think that the boy was still worrying about him.
"So, basically you're saying I'm too cool for my name?" Dean questioned, and the angel grinned, looking away as his hand fell from the top of Dean's head.
Cas sat on a corner of the bed, letting out a staggered sigh before he lay back completely, both arms behind his head. "I've been asked to stay here for another hunt."
Castiel cupped his hand atop Dean’s to illuminate the ring, withdrawing slightly when Dean flinched. “I’m sorry.”
He hissed as he was lowered onto what he could only assume was a bed, causing Dean to stall on multiple occasions throughout the process, and Castiel brought a hand up to his face when he was finally level with the mattress, drawing in a sharp breath as he tried to numb the pain receptors all over again.
?" Dean grinned.
Castiel continued to stare, watching the boy’s face become slightly red.
“Don’t come near me.”
Castiel nodded feebly and Dean counted down from three, wincing at the expression Castiel made when they were suddenly at the bottom of the staircase. Dean waited patiently for the angel to catch his breath, knowing full well that travelling so quickly made Castiel feel more than a little nauseous, and he rubbed his hand up and down Castiel's back a few times in a weak attempt at comfort. He doubted there was much he could do at this point to make Castiel feel better.
Maybe it hadn’t completely hit him yet, but he felt like he should probably be way more worried than he actually was. Sure, his leg was torn to shit and his depth perception was fucked, but he wasn’t concerned about himself. At least
"You need to understand that I'm goin' off two different accounts here," Bobby interrupted, his voice stern. "Now, I don't know exactly what happened in that cabin, but the fact you're
It was the same with the whittling. That was a skill Dean would always treasure more than the abilities he was born with. Bobby had been teaching him to carve wood with a knife ever since he could remember, and although Dean didn't really class himself as an artistic person, he still had all the tiny sculptures he'd designed over the years. Obviously, they were nowhere near as good as the ones Bobby had made, but at the time, Dean had just felt so proud and grown up, being trusted to work with a sharp knife at such a young age.
"You can go now," he muttered, kicking at one of the empty water bottles as he walked past, jolting as the collar was re-leashed to the wall and his distance was restricted. He simply stopped, rubbing his hands over his face in defeat, before pacing in the opposite direction, desperate to keep awake.
It was definitely a different experience cooking in a house than it was in a motel, and Dean still wasn't completely certain he knew how to work the oven here. He could remember the many times that he and Sam had been left alone for a few days in a room that's only functional kitchen appliance was a microwave and it had definitely encouraged Dean to get more creative with meals, even if by creative it meant pouring dry cereal between two slices of bread, calling it a dessert and hoping Sam wouldn't mention anything to John.
If it was blood in his eyes, he doubted it was his own.
He’d probably been holding in so much traumatic shit that it had manifested as those twisted dreams over the years, and Dean really felt for him. Hunting alone couldn’t be easy.
There had to be
Dean had met a
Castiel dropped the change into the machine, selecting 'Strangers' by The Kinks, before returning to the barman to continue his downward spiral for the night.
It was cowardly, in a way, for John to give Dean the responsibility for something so important, but at least this way Sam had actually been healed. If their dad had gotten his way and Cas had died, then there'd be three deaths as a consequence, and ultimately, it would have been the stupidest outcome of the whole thing.
So did that mean that he was healing now? Like Cas had said, he’d been healing it slowly so he didn’t waste his energy, which meant that maybe by sleeping he healed faster than normal. It wasn’t like it didn’t make sense, especially since the wounds on his wrists seemed to have vanished completely now; not even a scar to show they were ever even there.
you would help!”
And sure, maybe he had potentially put Sam in danger, but like Cas had said: every hunt is a risk.
"We have
He pushed himself up onto his feet, dusting down the back of his jeans as he headed toward the dirt track entrance of the scrapyard. Part of him wanted to turn around and go clean up the ash he'd left at Bobby's table, but he knew as soon as he stepped foot in there he wouldn't be able to leave without arguing his way out again and he sure as hell didn't want that. It was rare that he and Bobby didn't see eye to eye.
"No, no. A
Obviously, it didn't really hold the same protective aspects as other deals, but it ensured a minimum amount of work each month that could be reimbursed with a payout if the assigned quota hadn't been reached by the end of the calendar year.

"Blah, blah, blah," Dean murmured, rising up on his knees so that their faces were level. "Stop complaining before I change my mind."
sorted everything out," Castiel murmured, slightly discomforted with how close the demon was to him.
Castiel stomped on the shadow the next time it touched at his calf, whirling on the boy and forcing him up against the island in the kitchen.
conversation he actually cared about, and he walked briskly over to the stairwell, the sound of his footsteps echoing off the concrete floor only making him feel smaller, even if the space confining him was of a moderate size.
"So you
Dean blinked a couple of times, looking around him. "Yeah, I just ... I didn't mean to fall asleep on you, Cas. I'm sorry," the boy mumbled, somewhat hunched forward as he rubbed at his eyes. He still looked half asleep, his movements sluggish now that he'd sat upright and his right cheek darker in colour than the other from where it had been pressed to Castiel's chest.
"I was actually expecting something a bit more flamboyant if I'm totally honest," Castiel teased, and Dean backhanded him across the chest in response without thinking, relieved when once more, the deal didn't respond.
Sensing Bobby’s life energy only made him feel worse.
Castiel wanted to scream. He wanted to cancel the deal solely so he could smash the demon’s fucking face in, because he didn’t care if the boy was putting it on or not, or even if the demon was giving up everything. Castiel was
Because he felt safer, not because of... the other thing.
“No.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Castiel offered, holding up a hand in apology. “I didn’t mean to do that.”
That was his goal anyway. Even if it could just be for five minutes to check in with both Cas and Sam. That wasn't much to ask for at all but he knew at this point Bobby probably wouldn't willingly let Dean talk to Cas again. Not without eavesdropping on the conversation.
Castiel rolled his lips together, nodding slowly. He both did and didn't want to know what Sam meant by that, deeming the demon's health far more important at that moment in time, so he moved across to where both boys sat on the bed, his face warming at the sight of Dean's broader smile.
He sat by the window despite it being where the light was weakest; crosslegged on the couch with his shadow drawn over his legs like a blanket, he balanced the book on his right knee so he could rest his weight on his other. The light from the desk was strong enough to let him read without casting a glare on the windows, allowing him to look out every now and again just in case Bobby
Castiel waved it off, ducking his head a little as he stared down at the pastel blue carpet. "Please don't worry. There's nothing dangerous about those woods."
rare power for a demon to possess, and yet, here he was walking beside a boy that could not only create objects but could also teleport to wherever he wished; an ability that Castiel really hadn't thought any demon would ever be able to use.
A good hour or so earlier, Dean had turned onto his side with his back to Castiel to avoid making things weird. Last thing he really wanted was to wake up face-to-face with a semi first thing in the morning, and whilst it was nice sharing a bed with someone again, he’d found that his anxiety levels had remained heightened long after he’d heard Castiel’s breathing slow. The last time they’d shared a room, maybe it had been for the best that Dean had passed the fuck out whilst they’d watched TV. At least that evening Castiel hadn’t been able to flail about or anything whilst he slept.
"Yeah," the boy said quietly, and Castiel looked over at him properly, taking in the frown and blatant disregard for eye contact which was fairly surprising given the near constant attention he'd received before.
Dean didn’t know what expression he wore on his own face, but judging from Cas’s reaction it wasn’t good.
"If you can do all this healing shit, then why are you in such a rough state?" He asked, glancing up to meet the angel's eye. "I mean, seriously: I sure as hell wouldn't go on a hunt with an injury as fucked up as that.“
He hopped up onto his feet eagerly, wincing when he felt a twinge in his left shoulder and shaking his arm out briefly before grabbing a clean shirt from his duffel. He'd taken the stitches out of his wound a few days ago, having forgotten that he even needed to do it at all, but seeing as he hadn't told Bobby about the injury it wasn't like anyone was going to help him with it. Dean was glad he hadn't mentioned anything though, knowing that it'd only give Bobby more reason to distrust Cas even more.
"Sorry, got kinda distracted."
The demon snorted. "No. Do you?"
. Castiel couldn’t exactly shove him over as a wake up call like he would if it was any other demon – not that he’d ever had the opportunity to do so, knowing that if he ever attempted something of the sort it’d most likely end poorly for him – and he didn’t particularly want to cause the boy any more harm as it was, regardless of how humorous it would be to do so in this instance.
So he took the lead, his shadow able to catch the vibration of anything that stepped on it. He clenched his hands with agitation. “Upstairs.”
But he didn’t know how reliable Cas would be if Dean asked for his help now – not since Dean had essentially abused him and fucked with him completely – because what the hell must this look like? Dean had been intending to do what his dad had asked, and now he was having fucking second thoughts!
. Perhaps it was just Dean’s human nature taking precedence in a moment like this, but the shadow didn’t feel as weighted as it usually did and it had Castiel watching its movements with intrigue, not completely understanding why it was behaving in such a way.
"I can heal using the power of my Grace."
for it?” Castiel countered, turning the page. “Did you buy this during the three seconds you disappeared in before?”
Dean blinked, slightly startled. "What?"
"I only asked you a question," Castiel stated lightly, knocking their temples together before getting to his feet to take a couple of steps forward, stretching once more as he turned to face him. "You know, I'm starting to think ..."
He took in a sharp breath, gearing up for even more of an argument because he had more to ask about. There was so much he didn't understand and there was still that fucking entry from the book that was sat at the back of his mind, concerning him to the point that he didn't actually know who he could trust.
Dean hadn't even registered just how disgusting he looked, and he probably smelled even worse. He pushed a hand through his hair tentatively, trying his best not to gag when his fingers brushed over several small lumps of congealed rugaru flesh, but he collected a napkin from the motel room's kitchenette and, with his eyes closed, picked each piece out to throw in the trash.
"So, uhhh ..." Dean cleared his throat and Castiel huffed out another slight laugh when Dean stalled, trying to come up with something decent to continue with.
He stepped out of the shadows timidly, his breath catching in his throat when the floorboard creaked beneath his feet and two pairs of eyes immediately settled on him. Whilst it was reassuring to see that Bobby was more than capable of supporting himself against Rufus, Dean did not feel comfortable under both of their scrutinizing stares.
"Where I told you to drop me off," Castiel murmured, taking the basket by the handles. "I'll pick it up later."
He waited a while, not really wanting to look up seeing as he knew Cas was still staring at him, but when Cas didn't remark on anything Dean had said, Dean took it upon himself to divert the attention.
He didn’t care if the child was a demon. No one should be kicked out of their home for making a sensible decision – especially when they were so damn young!
Maybe someone just hadn’t figured it out yet. Dean would have been told about a spell like that from a young age if had been crafted already, and every hunter in the world would likely wear that kind of protection. Sure, it wouldn’t be great for Cas if everything could be immune to his abilities, but … but Dean kinda wished it did exist, for the sole reason that they could remain friends.
Well, yes, maybe Castiel
"I guess, but it doesn't
"Not whilst he's unconscious," Castiel replied, resting his chin in a palm. "I don't want to frighten him."
That would definitely be easier said than done. He’d only met the psychic once before after all, and the topic of angels hadn’t exactly come up then.
And Dean was obviously more than a little reluctant to try and shake the guy awake.
He felt a lot more comfortable taking Cas there by himself, even if it would be more of a struggle for him whilst Castiel was still burning up. He imagined shoving the angel into a car with two humans was far more dangerous than simply transporting him there himself, especially when he still didn’t know how volatile Cas’s energy was at this stage. It would be easier to monitor him outside of a cramped vehicle, able to take him elsewhere if his Grace started to flare again without limiting his own mobility.
Dean bit his lower lip coyly when he noticed Castiel glaring at him, leaning back on his hands. "Clearly they weren't making the most of the opportunity."
He could imagine the older man bickering with Rufus about the smell alone.
"Are you gonna be okay walking home through a forest with all your groceries and stuff, Cas?" Dean questioned teasingly, and Castiel sighed, pretending he couldn't feel the shadow touch at the base of his calf again.
Castiel blinked at him. "It's fine," he stated honestly, trying to place the expression on Dean's face. He looked slightly distressed, but Castiel wasn't sure as to why that would be the case. "I understand why you're being wary, Dean, but just know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you," he continued in order to try and put the boy at ease. "You're too nice."
Dean found the book he recognised from the other day, drawing it out from the top of the nearest pile before squatting slightly to read the spines of everything in the same section. He didn't really know what he was looking for, but Bobby had so many different bestiaries that it'd be difficult to find a book that didn't contain at least a little bit of information about angels.
Okay, so Cas was still a little intimidating, but he was a nice enough guy and he'd helped Dean deal with everything better than John would have. And that only reminded him of the whole bullet wound thing again because Cas blatantly cared in ways that Dean expected from his brother, not a damn stranger.
"Not really. It's just ... can we talk later? I mean, I know I promised to leave you alone, but we're gonna have to talk at some point anyway because my brother'll text back soon and you said you'd prefe -"
to treat him kindly. Well, it wasn't exactly kind, but he was being pleasant enough. Castiel was simply pleased he hadn't been abused for other entertainment purposes.
he was being so disgustingly selfish again. Cas wasn’t even calling him out on it. He was just being his usual self: tolerating Dean.
The boy huffed out a laugh, dragging the bandage over Castiel's arm as he pulled back. "Shut up, Cas," he murmured, his breath touching at the top of Castiel's spine, making him shiver with unease.
If no one else was gonna be there to treat Cas with a little decency, then Dean would go out of his way during the moments that they were together.
The boy glanced up with a ludicrous expression on his face. “Look, it couldn’t have been you, okay? Not unless you can come back from the dead.”
“What the hell’s happening to you?” He whispered, dropping the soiled tissue into the toilet before tearing off some more.
Dean bit his lower lip, pushing his free hand through his hair. "Yeah. Okay. Let's go with that."
Sam blurted, his voice tainted with both laughter and what sounded like shock.
And then there was the handholding, but Dean had hidden their hands pretty well between them already because he
Fuck. This was it. Dean had fucked it completely. There wasn't a doubt in his mind that Castiel would resent him for the whole, overly complicated, situation.
"Cas -"
The thought of spending time with Cas in a more casual environment had his chest feeling tight though. That night they'd hung out at the motel had been great, and even though
Dean understood that they both still thought he was young and needed protecting, but to be honest, they couldn't be farther from the truth. Dean was confident in his powers and physical abilities, and it wasn't like the ghouls had been all that interested in him as a target anyway. It had definitely been a different experience in that sense for him too though: hunting with two full-blooded humans. They must give off a different scent or something entirely because none of the ghouls had looked at Dean as anything more than a nuisance, and yeah, maybe he should have been grateful that they hadn't been actively trying to eat him, but it meant he was working harder to keep them from ganging up on either one of the older hunters.
"I'm not a freak! I'm trying to be nice!"
they met before? There had to be
And there was nothing stopping the humans in the vicinity from adding to the current warding applied to the household.
Castiel encouraged Dean to turn his head to the side, tenderly brushing a thumb over the bruise on Dean's cheek, but then he felt that weird foreign buzz beneath his skin that had him grabbing the angel's wrist, holding it at bay.
Fuck, no, that couldn’t be right. Angels were capable of healing themselves of everything. That
“Dean?”
Did she even live with them anymore?
car!"
Without his ring, there wasn’t much he could do, and he definitely didn’t remember each and every single sigil that he’d marked on the original silver band.
Castiel was stood in the doorway to the bathroom, his Grace surprisingly so much brighter than what was being emitted from the light source behind him. His skin tone had returned to a relatively normal colour, and his hair had been readjusted so that it was no longer concealing his eyes, but instead revealed the dark bruising on his forehead from what Dean assumed was caused prior to their meeting.
," Dean grimaced, leaning against the door frame. "You stopped breathing before, dude. I don't get how you can be so okay with risking your life when the whole point of you coming here in the first place was so you
If Dean hadn’t dragged him out here without warning as suddenly as he had, Castiel would have certainly reconsidered the entire ordeal, no matter how selfish a choice that may have been.
The boy cleared his throat, scuffing the floor with his feet a little. “Well, I’ll take you to the motel, and when you’re done healing my brother, I’ll drop you back home so –”
Cas toppled forward following the transition, his full weight crashing against Dean's torso. Dean would have liked to have said he was prepared for it, but Castiel ended up stepping on his bare feet and he fell back against the bed with the angel against his chest, yelping as Castiel's elbow jutted into his ribs. Cas didn't make so much as a sound, simply rising to his feet to walk to the bathroom, the back of his hand pressed to his mouth.
He knew Bobby was hiding something, but that wasn't his main concern right now. These stories were giving him a different kind of insight as to what angels were at their core.
"You okay now, douchebag?" Dean teased regardless, chucking Sam under the chin.
I'm healing," the angel practically snarled, pushing at Dean's arm with his free hand when Dean went to wipe the wound again. Dean used his shadow to twine around it, slamming Castiel's hand awkwardly against the wall to stop him from interfering.
Castiel shook his head as he turned his attention to the view outside the window again. “No. I just don’t sleep very much.”
"But I don’t want you stealing, Dean. Even this today … whilst I am grateful that you went out of your way to get me groceries, I don’t agree with you simply taking things without paying.”
"Don't be such a baby," Castiel sighed, letting go of the needle so it stayed resting against the wound, and Dean cursed, worrying his lower lip between his teeth as he tried to focus on anything but the pain.
"Your wings are cool," he mumbled, touching at the back of Castiel's shirt where the light had disappeared. He'd only caught a glimpse of them for a couple of seconds, but they were pretty hard to miss. They were way brighter than his Grace, and they'd sort of lit up the granite where they rested against it, but other than being what he could only assume was an outline of the light, he didn't see feathers or anything remotely similar.
“The fuck, dude?!”
It was best not to think about it. He didn’t really commune with demons, and in return, they didn’t bother him. Not unless Crowley had thought it amusing to situate both of their hunts in the same location.
Dean leaned slightly to the side when Castiel turned his attention to the basket on the counter, angling his head so he could watch the purple in Castiel's eyes gradually brighten.
"Go get the truck ready," Bobby prompted, patting him on the shoulder as he got up from the table. "We're leavin' at eleven."
"I never know when stuff happens. Why'd you make me repeat myself every time," Sam groaned, throwing another pillow at him. Dean caught it with his shadow before it could land, keeping it held in mid-air for a second.
His Grace had staunched the bleeding, but it hadn’t dulled the pain, and every so often, Castiel would feel it throb, a trickle of blood seeping from the wound and making the remains of his shirt stick to his skin, the scent of blood burning his nostrils as he tried to divert his thoughts.
"I know, Bobby," he mumbled, toying with the ring on his finger, getting used to its weight. "I've been reading up on it all."
“There are lots of reasons,” the demon said softly before he was wiping around the injury again, not saying anything more.
Castiel took in a sharp breath, rubbing at his brow. "Okay, uhhh ... Sam, I'm gonna need you to relax, alright? It's not going to hurt you, but it might feel a little strange."
“You are singlehandedly the
Okay, so the thinking about feelings after what Bobby had said sorta made something briefly twist in his stomach, but like ... Cas wouldn't have charmed him, would he? Dean wasn't sure if he minded the thought or not, but obviously, he wouldn't if he was under a spell.
And that totally had nothing to do with Dean's ridiculous crush.
The journey to the cabin was fairly tolerable, if it wasn’t for the sharp ache in his back from losing focus. He knew he should have redressed the wound before setting out, but he would have plenty of time to do that later. A job would always be considered more important. Especially one that held chances of a higher pay.
"What, you want a badge or something to go with it?"
They were basically opposites in terms of being, what with the whole light and darkness heritages, and if Dean felt strange with something as small as handholding, Cas probably felt the same whenever Dean interacted with his shadow.
Castiel returned to sit on the bed, seating himself against the headboard this time to support his posture and frowning as he stared out of the far window. It was dark outside now, and it was quiet. The motel wasn’t exactly situated on a busy road, but Castiel couldn’t sense much outside of the room, and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d heard a car go past.
"I don't really feel comfortable taking medication," Castiel mumbled, watching the demon physically relax against the beam, the boy’s face scrunching up briefly as he clearly tried to get comfortable. "I know it's intended to help, but I feel safer relying on my Grace. I don't know what kind of reaction I'd have to something foreign."
Because it was Cas’s hunt at the end of the day. Dean didn’t want to call him out on his hypocrisy and risk being told to wait back at the motel for the next hour or so.
It didn't surprise him to know a Daeva had reported the kill back to Crowley already, but it was rare for the demon to contact him in such a way directly after, especially when the message had clearly come through ahead of the task actually being fulfilled. Castiel didn’t know if that was something he should question or not, but it made him feel relatively uncomfortable regarding just how he was being monitored. It wasn’t often that he was trusted this much to complete a job without that same shadowy observation documenting his every move.
“No!” Dean lied, causing Castiel to pull an expression of scepticism. “I mean … yes. A little.” He rolled his lips between his teeth. “You’re
Castiel kept silent, gritting his teeth when the demon applied all his weight to his back, trying to focus all of his energy on the shadow wrapped around his legs. The boy hissed a little, and then the dark touch was gone, leaving his legs available for movement.
That they knew of anyway. Some of the shit Sammy dreamt about wasn't always crucial to their own lives so for all Dean knew they could be wrong, but given their past experience, he hoped it was true. Like,
didn't look too good, and it wasn't exactly fair of him to shout at the guy when he was blatantly in a lot of pain. "You want me to check it or anything?" He added, making his voice a little softer.
He looked around the rest of the cabin hurriedly, rushing to the far side as he sought out another means of exit. He’d prefer it if he didn't have to face the boy, mostly because the child hadn't actually done any wrong yet. He hadn't really deserved to be wounded in the first place, and although Castiel had virtually threatened him, he would rather not have to take anyone’s life without an order to do so.
That was all it ever seemed to be.
Nothing.
Dean looked at him incredulously. “You made a deal for a single

Castiel decidedly skipped breakfast, what with not wanting to actually

Rufus was talking to Bobby softly, and all Dean could do was pace in his frustration, watching Rufus try and bandage up some of the more minor wounds; but the gentle way the older man applied Bobby's bandages had him stalling for a moment, watching how careful Rufus was being to make it as painless as possible.
Castiel glanced up at Dean curiously, noting the dark pink taint to the demon's cheeks and the blatant way in which Dean avoided his gaze, staring directly down at the carpet when Castiel tried to meet his eye.
He was grabbed by the arm, transported instantly to the basement, but no sooner had they arrived did the boy disappear, the sigils back on the collar fully, a new chain connecting him to the wall. Castiel felt a little something like relief that he hadn't been harmed further, but then his anger was rising to the surface at the realisation of what was going on.
“Eh. It’s just easier,” Dean murmured, sitting up a little straighter as he turned his body toward the bed. “Plus, it means I can sorta hang back to help without getting in the way.”
Castiel had been putting it off for a while so the pile of damaged items had begun to spill out of the crate where everything was kept. His main issue was just how little he actually had left to wear that didn't need washing, but that was an issue for another day, preferably where it would be easier for him to wash things in the spring.
Fuck!
Castiel flinched when Dean suddenly appeared beside him, dropping his toothbrush into the sink with the movement.
“No, it’s …” Castiel laughed nervously, smoothing out the page once he found it before pushing it toward the boy. “Just not the time.”
He could worry about that nearer the time though. Right now, he was more concerned about what he’d be doing afterwards.
“I think that’s maybe something you ought to ask him yourself,” Bobby responded.
That wasn't Castiel's fault though. The angel had helped in every way he could, and Dean wasn't criticising Cas's efforts at all. He just needed to know that the kid wasn't experiencing any side effects.
Dean went to say something, but Sam spoke over him hastily, apparently insistent on speaking for himself.
Castiel didn’t know how much the demon had told his uncle regarding the situation, but Castiel was beginning to worry that they too would cast the boy out for disobeying orders.
Dean didn't even know if it was still down to pity, but that's all he wanted to believe right now. Castiel didn't seem like the sort of person who went around making friends with demons, and Dean highly doubted the guy was relying on him for friendship or anything of the sort.
"It's fine, it's ..." He felt like he was going to be sick. "We just need to wait for them to go and ... and I can get you out."
“Can you leave me alone now?” He asked, lifting himself onto the countertop and crossing his legs. He didn’t care if it was unsanitary or anything of the sort. He wasn’t going to be eating anything made here.
He wished he could read to the extent that he could understand simple orders such as this – more so he could appear more literate. The hunters he’d encountered in the past often mocked him for his inability to read fluently. It wasn’t his fault, and maybe if they weren’t so ignorant, they would find better things to do with their time than irate him with their nescient comments.
fucking knew that angels were dangerous. This wasn't some sort of revelation.
The smile on Dean's face was a nervous one. He didn't know how much or how little he should really be talking about this - especially when he still didn't know Jo that well.
"How the hell do you expect me to prove it when I can't use my power!
He walked back out to the entrance of his cave after retrieving his largest pot from his collection of kitchen utensils, holding it under his arm as he made his way midway down the slope so he could view the fall of water from the rockface just a short distance away. He summoned the fresh water into a large bubble, leaning against the main body of his home as he drew it closer. Again, it wasn't using much of his Grace and the pain in his muscles was barely noticeable, nothing more than a sharp pang of agony through his form every so often. He knew it would remain that way for a while, more so considering the fact that it was the one thing that hadn't changed at all since he'd begun to heal himself, and yes, perhaps it should concern him more than it currently did, but as soon as he'd eaten again, it'd be far simpler to manage.
"I think you'll find that
And anyway, this was a
Like, Dean had full-on expected Cas to have peed at least once in his unconscious state, but as far as he was aware, Cas hadn’t had any accidents. It was like the angel’s body was on standby, and aside from his heartbeat and his breathing, there wasn’t anything else going on.
!" He yelled again, lowering himself above Castiel to listen out for even the smallest fucking breath, just in case the past thirty seconds hadn't given him enough evidence as to what Castiel's situation was, but he was fucking
anything," he croaked, feeling his heartbeat pound in his chest. "You took my phone. You took ..."
Dean looked down to meet the angel’s stare curiously, frowning at the pale hue to his skin. “You
He was surprised by how fast Castiel replied to him this time around, but he was in no way disappointed. There was a certain clarity to Cas's texts that pretty much conveyed exactly how the guy spoke naturally, which was both weird and oddly comforting.
He walked over to where the guy was laying, crouching down so he could examine the wound on Castiel’s throat. All that seemed to remain was dried blood and a faint redness to the skin, almost like it had only just started chaffing. It really was interesting to see the guy heal himself, and he had already considered filming it on his cell phone to prove to his dad that angels really could heal. Maybe it wasn’t healing someone else, but after the way Castiel acted before, he had next to no doubt regarding whether healing someone else was possible for the guy. It just all came down to whether or not the angel actually
I figured I may as well give a go at finishing this fic off in his honour (hopefully I find time for the other one too), even if I do have to prioritise my art work from here on out
He brought his plate across timidly, drawing out a chair at the opposite end of the table to avoid spilling anything on the book Bobby was reading. Dean didn't need to give the guy any more reason to be annoyed with him.
Dean stopped pacing when he found himself in the study for what felt like the hundredth time, his shadow running gently over the piles of books near the fireplace. He could feel the rough edges curl beneath his touch, the pages fluttering slightly as he made his way closer to them.
Maybe later? After a bath?
stronger, and the thought of accidentally pissing the guy off for saying or doing something that the angel didn't like
There's bout to be a wee bit of a time skip, so it'll be a hot minute before these lads see each other again
Castiel smiled, setting the basket down on the ground, crouching beside it. "Bring it over," he murmured, adjusting the contents so that the lighter objects were brought to the top, not wanting any of it to become too badly damaged. The demon dropped down beside him, dumping all the packaged goods on the floor carelessly, and Castiel rubbed his brow as he tried to hide his amusement. "Right, uhhh ..."
Castiel pursed his lips and Dean reached for the metal basket, dragging it over the island. It wasn't as full as it was yesterday, but Cas had eaten some of the fruit and Dean had taken out his own stuff so it also shouldn't be anywhere near as difficult to carry.
Especially if his being there was putting Cas on edge.
It didn’t bring Castiel any more comfort to think about it. Anyone could hurt him, especially when he’d be putting his body under a lot of stress to go through with this to begin with. Dean didn’t seem to acknowledge those factors, but he wasn’t exactly going to point it out now. The kid was incredibly high strung, and it would be selfish to bring up something of that nature when Dean was so blatantly distraught.
“No, no. I’m fine,” the demon stated, setting the pot on the side. “Just not used to having an audience.”
Then again, Jo did seem to be interested. Maybe he didn't need to feel guilty after all.
He twitched a little when the demon let out a shuddering breath, tears still dripping against Castiel’s neck, and Castiel rested his chin on the top of the boy's head timidly, unsure of even his own actions at this point.
Sam didn't respond that time, and Dean dropped his forehead to rest on his arms, closing his eyes. It'd still be a while before John arrived at the cabin, and Dean guessed that he'd probably be receiving a phone call the moment his dad realised what had happened. Dean would stick around in the motel for as long as he could though. Not long enough for John to land a punch on him, but long enough to at least enjoy Sam's company whilst he had a shit ton of time at his disposal.
Castiel nodded his thanks as he stepped inside, casting his eye above the beams above him before turning his attention to the bordered up windows, shrouded in gloom. “So are you the one I’m dealing with, or is there –“
mentioned it once before.
But he could freeze the sweat on his skin, as disgusting as it was to think about, and that usually helped the issue – and as for winter, he simply applied more clothing. It wasn’t difficult at all.
Even if he was only in his underwear.
"Okay then," Dean smiled. "Goodnight, Cas."
“Cas?” He called again, toying with the edge of the bedding as he waited for a response. “You alright, dude?”
"This morning," Castiel murmured, facing forward again as he suppressed another yawn.
"I don't care!" Dean shouted. "It doesn't change the fact that you could still die!"
"I've never used it."
But Castiel stayed quiet, holding Dean’s gaze like he’d be risking his life if he looked away, and Dean couldn’t help but feel nervous, unsure of what the hell he could do whilst Cas refused to pass comment. He reached out carefully, poking him lightly in the chest and lowering his voice. “Earth to Castiel. You listening to me?”
to take me home. I requested you let me go on my own. I can take everything myself,” Castiel told him, watching warily as the demon raised his head, expecting some sort of glare to be aimed his way, but instead, the boy’s expression was stoic and unreadable, almost as if Castiel hadn’t asked him a question at all. It did unsettle him a little, unsure if the boy had indeed heard him or not, but he waited patiently as the demon blinked at him through the darkness, his irises almost a golden grey in comparison to their regular green.
Dean looked down to the grey material, frowning. He hadn't been able to stitch it up without someone else's help, but it was nowhere near as bad as the wound on Cas's back.
He could hear the demon follow him through the room, and he grimaced when the boy took hold of his wrist.
The world did that flash of colour again, making Castiel feel slightly ill and queasy, and he slumped against the wall when everything stopped, taking in a deep breath.
"Good," Dean stated, dropping his hand to his lap. "So ... do we have a deal?"
Dean didn’t remember at what point he actually fell asleep, but when he woke up again he was alone in the bed. By letting his shadow roam between the sheets he could tell that he hadn’t been left alone for long, but as it was still dark outside he merely dragged the comforter up higher, letting his eyes close again with the intention of getting a few more hours of sleep.
Dean swung his legs from his seat on the countertop, watching as the angel opened a beer for himself before setting it down beside the sink, pushing the hair away from his forehead with his fingers as his brow furrowed and his lips were pursed. Dean simply grinned, looking expectantly at the glass bottle when Castiel directed a hand through the air.
My parents are coming to me help pack and move back home this week so I dunno if I'll be able to get a chapter out on time by next Saturday (it might just end up being a teensy bit shorter than normal but I'll try and get as much done as possible)
Was this … was it fully healed? Was this what it was going to look like for the rest of Castiel’s life?
Castiel smirked, rising to his feet to walk the length of the ledge, his wings splaying out once more. "And more arrogant, so it seems."
"What makes you say that, Cas?" Dean teased, watching Castiel's lips press together to form a thin line.
“You don’t have to be embarrassed, you know. I mean, it’s kind of amusing, but I’m not going to laugh at you for being sensitive,” Castiel murmured, ruffling Dean’s hair almost tentatively like he’d expected Dean to punch him for it or something.  “You’re a fucking kid. You shouldn’t even be hunting.”
But then, he didn't want it to be too overbearing, because all Dean was doing was asking how Cas was holding up. It required, at the minimum, three words, and Dean couldn't even put them in the right fucking order.
He was alone again.
who you compared me to? Some disproportionate girl in a swimsuit?”
The boy hadn't actually
He got to his feet, hopping down to the ground to wander over to where Rumsfeld was viciously gnawing on the tennis ball.
Castiel smiled. "Not much. I just took on the rest of his illness."
Castiel preferred not to step foot in Crowley's main establishment if it could be helped. It almost had his anxiety playing up at the thought of flying out there solely to be paid.
"That's bull and you know it."
"What?"
Castiel seemed to topple to the floor when the corpse continued to twist and the bones were splitting open in his general direction, each limb torn apart and suspended in ice. Even after the pained noises had stopped, there was still a slight crunching sound to be heard as the spears continued to languidly expand.
Very rarely did he choose to take the journey through the front entrance of the establishment. The basement entrance may be claustrophobic and laden with mould, but it also had two dozen fewer demons in the vicinity. Castiel would rather be without air for five minutes than he would walk ten seconds through a hunter-filled bar.
“So, are you going to tell me what your plan is?” Castiel asked, pushing the needle through Dean’s skin with apparent ease as he made yet another neat stitch to seal the wound shut.
Because look at Dean now: he had made an effort to be nice, and now he had an angel that was fucking
“So, you think I look weak?” Castiel pressed, understanding completely as to why the demon would think as such. Castiel’s diet had quite blatantly affected his weight, so he wasn’t as bulky or large as the average hunter, but he always used his appearance to his advantage, knowing that people would continually deem him somewhat pathetic upon first glance.
heard of an angel and demon being friends before, and he was kinda proud of the fact that he'd been able to befriend Castiel considering how shitty their introduction to one another was.
"Not to ruin your night or anything, but can we maybe go outside for a sec?" Dean asked, throwing a quick glance back toward where Bobby and Rufus were sat at the booth. They still had a few minutes before Bobby would realize something was up and Dean would rather not be confined to a space like this when it happened. "I'm here with my uncle and he's not exactly your biggest fan."
Dean mumbled out an apology, seating himself in the chair beside the couch yet again with his chin in his hands, staring down at Castiel with a tight frown on his face. He felt like he was gonna give himself fucking vertigo from the standing up so often, his sleep-deprivation already making his head ache.
“Why the hell are you being so stubborn?”
He walked up the rock slope slowly, still fairly exhausted, but he knew he had plenty of time to sleep later. It would make more sense to get everything else out of the way first so he wouldn't leave it too late - especially when it came to preserving his food because he sure as hell didn't want anything spoiling before he'd had a chance to use it.
Castiel shut up as soon as Dean willed the sigils to erase from the collar, the angel's Grace growing brighter and his eyes fluttering shut as he leant against the wall, almost in a state of bliss.
"My chest burns a lot," Sam whispered, staring down at his hands. "It always hurts."
Or if he wanted him there.
“So you
Castiel didn’t bother returning to the main room, curling up on one of the cushions to free as much space as possible as opposed to outstretching; just in case the kid came in at a later point and decided he
Obviously, addressing something like that would've probably gotten him kicked out sooner than he had been, which was why he'd been so against bringing up the fact that he and Cas had made a deal because that probably would've given John an aneurysm.
Castiel leafed through the map book timidly, feeling somewhat disconcerted under Dean’s continuous gaze.
“You’ve heard of him before?” Dean queried, kicking at his shadow distractedly as it continued to drift along the base of the couch.
– he was useless. The humans did not know of his angelic nature – they could not see his Grace like some other beasts could – so they could not be forgiving or understanding. They would simply tell him to get lost, like the many positions Castiel had interviewed for in the past.
He was knocked backwards suddenly, hitting his head on a nearby beam as he fell to the floor, the chain clattering to the ground next to him, and he choked, clutching at his throat. He could taste blood on his tongue, and he spat to the side, grimacing at the lingering flavour in his mouth. He knew it had been stupid to even attempt to hurt the boy like that, but there wasn't exactly any other way he could get the child to notice how much pain he was in, even if it had only caused him more pain in the process.
Castiel narrowed his eyes, the tears still rolling down his cheeks. It completely contrasted: the watery eyes and the rough voice. It was throwing Dean off.
decision is the
Dean couldn't remember the last time he'd actually been to Florida, but the weather didn't seem all that different and it only made Dean want to head inside to somewhere with decent air conditioning even more.
to offer help, it'd be solely out of guilt. Not friendship.
Castiel stopped walking, staring down at the grimy floor as the blood dripped down over his hands, arms numb from a lack of any real movement. "No."
That earned him a rather surprised glance from the angel before Castiel was facing forward once more, shaking his head and smirking.
He didn’t exactly have any prior experience with blood magic, so he was more than a little frustrated when he found himself having to go over the lines several times. He didn’t understand how some people relied on these kinds of spells during regular hunts, especially when he doubted they also had an angel on hand to relieve them of the damage afterwards.
Dean dropped down a few feet away, returning the stare as he grasped blindly into the box, finding the sachets containing disinfectant wipes so he could prevent anything dangerous from entering the guy's bloodstream.
The older man didn't strike up a conversation immediately which kind of made Dean feel a little awkward. He wasn't all that comfortable sitting in silence to begin with, but the prolonged pause brought with it a sense of unease, something that had him regretting the small amount of food he'd already eaten.
"Not until you finish your ice cream, Sam."
"I don't feel comfortable with you watching," he continued, tossing the antiseptic wipe to the side and grimacing at the blood staining his fingers. It made opening another packet all the more difficult. "So can you leave me alone? I want to be able to concentrate."
"I wasn't going to interrupt you while you were speaking, you dork," Castiel whispered fondly, his breath echoing down the line. "Is that what this is about? You think I'm bored?"
"Doubt it," Dean huffed, and Castiel reached out with his free hand, plucking a twig from the demon's hair. "But you'll probably end up preferring him over me."
"I'm not allowed to travel with you anymore," he mumbled into the sheets, clenching his jaw and balling the fabric in his hands. He didn't particularly want to talk about it but it would be stupid to leave it till the very last minute. He needed to make sure that Sam understood everything before he left, and if Sam knew now, then maybe they could arrange to meet up ahead of time or something - and plan what they could do to make sure John never found out. "Dad said if I didn't do as he asked, I wasn't allowed to stay."
No. He was quite content in collecting his pay from his employer by hand.
Now all it did was make him feel sick.
No wonder the guy had been in such a rush.
Castiel continued to stare, wondering if the demon before him inherited the same looks his father possessed. “That doesn’t rule out the possibility. Did he ever mention the case he worked?”
of questions he wanted to ask Cas, and it frustrated him to think about.
Still, as the evening rolled around, the thought of that injury continued to plague him. Dean had spent an hour or so researching the healing process for similar cases, but everything he’d come across related to wounds that had received some form of medical treatment in a hospital first.
"Y-yes," the boy responded quickly. "And, uhhh, thank you for helping me. I hope you feel better soon."
He hadn't really expected time to creep up on them like that, bringing them way closer to the halfway point.
to be a hunter.
He shouldn't have been thinking about something like that again. It was stupid and pointless and actually made him feel kinda uncomfortable. Like, yeah, Cas was sorta ...
This was the sort of shit that he sincerely hoped never came up in Sam’s predictions. The thought of the kid witnessing such bizarre interactions made him feel incredibly ill, and whilst he trusted Sam not to go spouting off to their dad about this kind of thing, just having Sam know about it was embarrassing enough.
