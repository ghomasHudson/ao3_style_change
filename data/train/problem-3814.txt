Dean checked the time again. It was only 2:16 but he decided he might as well call it a day. His mind had not been on the job all day. All he really managed to do was disassemble and clean the existing parts of the engine he was keeping.  Between the donuts Mimi and Jake brought in for his birthday, standing around the coffee pot shooting the shit, getting hassled for turning fifty, getting hassled for busting his knee right before turning fifty, and thinking about date night tonight, there hadn’t been much time for the Cadillac he was working on.
He couldn’t say despite knowing all that to be true, he kind of wanted to marry Cas anyway. Just because. Because it would make Jack happy. Because “no thanks I’m married” sounded like something he wanted to say. Because forging a birth certificate for a mostly human, formerly immortal wavelength of celestial energy so he could be allowed by the state of Kansas to get married sounded both hilarious and potentially annoying to Cas. Because husband still wasn’t a good enough word for Cas, but it was better than boyfriend or partner or, fucking hell, lover.
Castiel watched him fondly, the way he was fighting to keep his eyes open, the way his cheek squished against his arm. “It appears so.”
It wasn’t until Castiel almost killed Jody that Dean finally gave in.
Castiel seized his attacker’s wrist in a hard grip, whirled, and threw the person against the side of his truck. In an instant, his blade was pressed against their throat. Dean’s throat.
“Do you see now?” Castiel said eventually.
Castiel nodded in understanding; he’d healed their physical wounds after God was bound, but there was little he could do for wounds of the mind and Eileen certainly bore those after today. Thank you, he signed to her. She smiled tremulously back.
The last thing he saw was Sam and Dean’s faces above him. Then the box closed and the world went black. And so it stayed.
Sam swallowed thickly. “I will,” he said. “Thank you. For everything.”
He finished the Mal’ak box in the early morning but waited until after dinner to tell the Winchesters he was ready. It seemed more merciful, but he could still only watch as their faces crumpled with grief.
Dean held his hands up in surrender, but he looked at Castiel calmly; he didn’t even glance at the blade. “You said I should've stopped you,” he said, roughly, “this is me stopping you.”
Dean slammed his duffle bag down on the war room table, his shoulders tense, his jaw grinding. He was angry, Castiel knew, not at him but at the situation. It didn’t help and the Mark reacted to all anger the same.
His mind stuttered again and he imagined Jack on his knees in that graveyard, Dean standing above him. That gun pointed at Jack’s face with steely resolve. The rage and disgust on Dean’s face when he said
Sam saw sense first, the night when Castiel smote three demons in a diner without thinking of the other guests first. Sam met his eyes afterward, the smell of charred flesh and the screams of those whose eyes had been burned out hanging heavy in the air, and Castiel saw acceptance there.
It was a dirty fight, messy. Castiel grabbed the first werewolf that rushed him and smote it. He dodged a strike from the next and stabbed it in the heart with his blade. The calm that he’d always found in battle fell over him, his thoughts stripping away until his mind was only focused on the next strike.
It felt like hours later when Castiel came back to himself, hunched over among the dead. He couldn’t tell what parts belonged to the monsters and what belonged to the people he’d meant to save when he’d walked in there.
“I love you,” Dean said again, kissing him again. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this.”
Dean’s face twisted. “Then let it burn!” He grabbed Castiel with both hands, fisting the front of his coat tight.
And there were days when both joy and grief seemed far from his mind. On those days, everything seemed an irritant, whether it was Dean handing him a coffee he knew tasted like molecules to Castiel, or Sam making a reference to a TV show he must have known Castiel had never seen. It was the Mark, Castiel knew, creeping through his being like a virus. He did his best not to snap at the Winchesters on those days, the knowledge that they would understand and forgive him for it just another in a long list of petty aggravations. Instead, he’d take himself out to the fields that surrounded the bunker and sit staring angrily at the sky, rubbing the Mark hard in a vain hope of relieving its effects through the pressure. Eventually, the anger would fade and Castiel would return to the bunker and Sam and Dean’s relieved faces.
“Damn, I hope those two will be alright,” Dean said, slumping into a seat at the war table. “Sam just got her back, y’know?”
“Dude, are we the only hunters around?” Dean grumbled as he hung up the phone. “How hard can it be to get someone else?”
The Winchesters refrained from hunting after that, other than the most desperate cases or those within a day’s drive. Castiel remained behind whenever they went, refusing point blank to step outside the bunker. He knew they were afraid to leave him, whether because they thought he’d run out on them and destroy something or because they thought he’d jump in the Mal’ak box as soon as it was finished, regardless of whether they were there or not. Rationally, he knew they stayed close simply because they wanted to spend his last days on this world with him. It was touching and Castiel wanted to take comfort in it, but he couldn't. Another reason to hate the Mark.
It wasn’t all perfect of course. Sam and Dean both had quiet days when Castiel could see their many griefs pressing on their souls more harshly. Castiel had those days as well, when it seemed all he could do was look around the bunker and see Jack’s absence. He would spend those days in Jack’s former room, going over every memory he had of the boy he’d taken as his own, until he felt strong enough to get up again.
Dean said nothing for a long time, staring at the floor in silent despair. Castiel didn’t move, content in this moment to hold Dean’s hands and just look at him.
“Then you know you should let me go,” Castiel gritted out.
“There was no other way, Dean,” Castiel said, gently, “I know the consequences of this and I accept them.”
“Dean,” Castiel said again, reaching up to hold Dean’s face. He thumbed the tears away and Dean met his eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
The hunts continued. The Winchesters looked more and more run-down, exhaustion pulling at their souls. They started to get sloppy, making mistakes that translated to injuries. Which, in turn, translated to that same anger in Castiel and the abrupt and bloody end of the hunt.
Castiel’s mind shied away, but the Mark dragged him onward, merciless. Suddenly, Jack was dead before him again, then he was Belphegor, that pustulant stain wearing his son’s body. The rage flared and Castiel thought about pinning Belphegor to the ground, of beating him, of burning him again, but slower this time. Just to really make him feel it, make him regret what he’d done.
The kiss ended, as all things do. “I love you,” Castiel said; Dean closed his eyes in resignation. “But I have to go.”
The Castiel of now, the one with the Mark, only barely registered that care. He knew it was there, knew that well of compassion ran deep in Sam. But all he could hear was false promises, desperation, and condescension. As if Castiel was some child, some burden, that Sam had deigned to care for.
Castiel had many things he could say now: that Dean had changed him, irrevocably and for the better, that loving Dean was the best thing he had ever done because it had brought him everything else good in his life. That Dean shouldn’t give up, that he should keep going. That he should be happy. But all those words seemed too cruel to say now, in this moment of having and losing.
The bunker was dark, the Winchesters assumedly gone to bed. He had nothing to pack, no possessions to his name besides his blade and the keys to his truck. Quietly, he left Jack’s room and crept down the hall. He refused to look back; he couldn’t risk polluting this one-time refuge anymore than he already had.
The first case came from Bobby, passing on a tip he’d heard about some ghouls near West Bend, Iowa. They had just hit the road after that case when Jody called with another, conveniently nearby in Albert Lea, Minnesota, just across the border. They had only just checked into a motel there when Garth called with a third case in Mankato.
For a long moment, Castiel wondered if they might have been granted a reprieve. Maybe this could be like one of the fairy tales humans liked to tell themselves, where love conquered all and the heroes lived happily ever after.
It was only three hunts later that Castiel could truly acknowledge that he had lost control of the situation.
Dean didn’t move. Then, slowly, he let go.
Dean hung his head. A tear crawled down his cheek. “Please, please don’t,” he begged quietly, “just because. Please.”
“I’m sorry.”
Castiel pressed on the Mark again, jerked a quick nod, and turned to stare out the window. He dared not speak or move for the rest of the drive.
How easy it would be, to make them both pay for it. They were only human, after all. And humans always bled so easily.
Castiel squeezed his hands and replied equally softly. “You already have, Dean. You did the moment I took the Mark. It’s just none of us knew it then.”
But he would, Castiel knew that. The Mark had a firm hold on him and there was no stopping it, no real way to halt it. Its influence would grow and grow, its demand for blood ever higher. There was only so long Castiel could go without satisfying it.
It appeared to be an open and shut case: hikers would go out to walk the paths of Gila National Forest and turn up mauled. Local authorities figured it was a bear or a mountain lion, but each victim’s heart was missing and it only ever seemed to happen around the full moon. It was clearly a werewolf and they prepared accordingly, Sam and Dean carefully loading their guns with silver bullets.
Castiel lowered his blade, tucked it back up his sleeve. Then he cupped Dean’s cheek and healed the bruise starting to form on Dean’s back. He let his hand linger, felt Dean’s warmth skin to skin.
Dean snorted, turning away to glare at the wall.
The Castiel of the past, the one from before the Mark, would have nodded, agreed, been touched by the care in Sam’s voice and–as always–a little wondering at the friendship the two of them had managed to form, despite the pain Castiel had visited upon him.
He left the blood alone and looked out the window, watching the headlights buzz by.
“You should’ve told us you weren’t a hundred percent, Cas,” Dean snapped, turning to glare at him. “Why the hell didn’t you say anything?”
Castiel tried to hold on to his guilt; at least if he was feeling guilty over what he’d done, he wasn’t feeling angry. But the guilt only fed the anger, shifted it, until he was raging at himself, at his own weakness, his unending failures. “What was there to say? The Mark is affecting me, yes. It’s not exactly a surprise.”
Castiel smiled, and found that it came easy for the first time in a long time. “It was my pleasure.”
The calls kept coming in, from all over the country. The Google alerts that Sam had set up to track signs of monster activity pinged constantly, showing a dramatic increase of restless monsters all over the globe. It was an inexplicable flood and it kept them busy.
They drove back to the bunker, Sam electing to sit in the backseat with a shaken Eileen. Castiel spent the drive carefully examining the Mark. The way it felt reminded him a little of the rotted grace he’d carried in years past, both divinity and corruption in one. But the stain was already far more expansive, a persistent weight that Castiel found himself constantly needing to adjust to bear.
What they did not prepare for, was a pack of werewolves.
Castiel hung his head. His fingers itched to grab the Mark, to rub it, to claw at it, to reach through to where it rested on his grace beneath and rip it out.
The surfaces in Jack’s room were covered in dust, a sign of how long they’d been away from the bunker. But the bed was neatly made and it was there Castiel went, lying down on his side and curling in tight.
Even desperate, Dean was beautiful. There had never been a moment Castiel had not found him so.
Dean hummed along softly with the music, fingers tapping absently on the steering wheel. He was clearly trying to restrain himself, in consideration of the somber mood emanating from the backseat, but Castiel could see the smile trying to escape onto his face, the light in his eyes every time he threw another glance at Castiel. Which was often.
The anger came on like a storm front, sudden and inevitable. Castiel felt his grace boil up within him, his lips pull away from his teeth in a wordless snarl. In a second, he was across the clearing, dragging the werewolf off of Dean. He seized it by the throat, ignoring the snapping teeth and the slashing nails, and burned it alive.
Dean leaned across the table, jarring Castiel from his thoughts. “Alright, let me see this thing.”
Dean shook his head, his brows knitting together, and that terrible earnest expression unfolded before Castiel’s eyes. “You don’t need to go anywhere. We’ll figure it out, Cas, like Sam said.”
Dean looked to Castiel. “You wanna choose?”
It took longer to make Dean and Sam see that.
Their plan to slow down came to nothing. The spike in monster activity continued, relentless, unending. Each day became a breathless run towards the next hunt. And each day, Castiel felt the presence of the Mark more and more.
“What the hell is this?” Dean asked, staring at the partially constructed box.
He went back to find Winchesters, crushed by guilt and soaked in blood. It was all too familiar a sensation.
Jack had barely lived in this room, hardly spent any time here; the only personal touch he’d left was the picture of his mother, placed lovingly on the nightstand. And yet, Castiel felt close to him here, as though if he closed and opened his eyes, Jack would be sitting beside him.
He opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was Dean, staring at him with wide, worried eyes. “Dean.”
So he laid there and he thought about Jack. His excitement for life, his infectious smile, his eagerness to please. The way he would fold into Castiel’s arms and let himself be held. That endless love and devotion that shone at the core of him.
“I love you,” Dean said. “I should’ve told you. I wasted so much goddamn time.”
It was an easy hunt, as much as a group of vampires could ever be easy. Jody, passing through from a hunt near Oklahoma City, had decided to lend a hand. She had simply ended up being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Which made it sound like more of an accident than it really was.
It flared in protest and Castiel gasped. No one but him had ever touched it before and the Mark hated it, it hated to be touched. It was all Castiel could do not to tear Dean's hand away, to lash out and make him regret even thinking of touching the Mark.
That calm fell away the moment he saw a werewolf hurl Dean to the ground.
Dean spent the rest of the day forcing them to watch Netflix. “I haven’t had time to watch anything in the last year. Let’s just relax,” he said, crowding them toward the room he’d once designated as his ‘cave’.
“Who?” Castiel asked. Dean opened his mouth, but could only shake his head mutely. “I will not curse someone else with this, Dean. Think about it, would you have?”
Dean shook him. “Then give it to someone else!”
Castiel nodded and confidently clicked on the first true crime documentary in the Trending category. As he expected, Sam perked up immediately, while Dean groaned quietly. Castiel settled in his seat and barely noticed the way his fingers traced over the Mark, a quiet itch he couldn’t quite scratch.
It was also the day Dean’s resolve finally broke.
Dean’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Then we got to slow down. Give you some time to get a handle on this.”
The quiet couldn’t last, though.
In the end, Eileen left, wanting time and space. Sam joined them in the war room and the Winchesters spent the evening getting pleasantly inebriated while Castiel watched. He drank the beers Dean kept pressing on him more because he knew Dean enjoyed the implied act of providing than because of any effect they had on him.
They were kept on the road non-stop for the next few weeks and the problem became gradually clear. It was not the availability of hunters causing this rush, but rather the sudden spike in the amount of monsters.
Dean broke into a relieved smile. Sam, sitting next to them and gripping Castiel’s arm, did the same.
“Please,” Dean said, “don’t do this. Please. I’m begging you here.”
As soon as the wound was healed, Castiel shoved himself to his feet and fled. Dean found him outside, leaning heavily on the Impala. He took Castiel by the shoulders and gripped him tight and kept him from flying apart.
He pressed savagely on the Mark for the rest of the drive, hard enough he could feel the bruise forming. For the next hours back to the bunker, he felt that bruise form and heal over and over, until he finally felt calm enough to speak. Gingerly, he reached forward and pressed a hand to Dean and Sam’s shoulders.
They were in Grand Island, Nebraska, hunting a pack of vetala. They knew the pack had kidnapped some of the townsfolk, grabbing them from walking paths or along the river. Vetala didn’t always feed immediately, so some of the victims were probably still alive, though likely in poor shape. It was a complication, but not one they couldn’t handle.
Time passed and they indulged in their freedom.
“You guys go ahead,” Sam said when they pulled into the bunker’s garage. “We’ll catch up.”
He looked up and found Dean staring at him, eyes shrewd as if he could read Castiel’s thoughts as easily as Castiel had once been able to read his.
Castiel looked at him. “Did that help you?”
Dean laughed. “They’re not exactly subtle, man.”
What happened was this: Castiel took down a vampire and saw an unexpected movement out of the corner of his eye. He reacted, sweeping his angel blade around in one clear stroke, and stabbed Jody through the chest.
Sam twisted in his seat, meeting Castiel’s eyes. “Dean’s right, Cas. We get some breathing room from these back to back hunts, it’ll buy some time.”
“How does it feel?” Dean asked, turning Castiel’s wrist gently to study the Mark from every angle.
It was then that Castiel started construction on the Ma’lak box.
“There will come a time,” Castiel said softly, his hand still cupping Dean’s cheek, “when I’ll need to go. Don’t stop me then.”
“So, this is freedom, huh?” he asked.
But it turned, as everything always did now. He thought about Jack, thought about watching Jack as he read a book in his room and the image shifted. Jack was in his room, but he wasn’t reading. Instead, he was burning his pet snake to ash.
Dean nodded. “That’s good.” He looked back down at the Mark, and swallowed heavily. “I’m sorry. You shouldn’t have had to do this.”
If anything, Dean held tighter. He must be able to see the fight in Castiel’s face, but he didn’t seem the least bit afraid. “I ain’t doing that, Cas.”
Castiel flinched away from the memory and all that had followed after, turning toward earlier memories. But even that was corrupted. Seeing Jack for the first time morphed into watching as Jack threw the security guard, morphed to looking down at that man’s body, the blood. Thinking about Jack before he was born, in all his glorious potential, turned into burning Dagon to ash, turned into walking into that basement with Kelly and this time, shooting without hesitation.
“Are you sure?” Sam asked, eyes dark and worried.
As Sam and Dean helped him to his feet, as they steadied him when his knees threatened to buckle again, Castiel allowed himself to hope–for the first time since Jack had died–that they would be alright.
Dean snorted too, then suddenly shot Castiel a worried look. “Actually, it is. You sure you got Chuck locked down tight?”
Castiel frowned. “There was no one else, Dean. And I’m more than able to carry this burden.”
The Mark was affecting him more and more, there was no reason in denying it. But maybe, Castiel thought at night in the back of the Impala as they sped toward their next hunt, maybe he could use it. If this rage meant he could better protect the Winchesters, maybe he could look at it as a type of gift. Be their guardian as he’d always wanted to be.
“Oh this one for sure,” Mimi said.
Sam added quickly,
So when Dean stood up and let out a noise like an elderly bear deflating under a boulder, he shouldn’t have been surprised.
Dean wanted Cas for the rest of time, in this life and the next. And Dean didn’t have the language for that.
Dean frowned. That was quick. He sent off a reply:
“Nothing,” he said. “Just… feel bad I’m such a slug right now. You’re taking care of everything.”
Ever since Dean’s surgery, Sam was still in worry mode all the time, mother henning over every little thing. Dean’s fucked up knee was not the end of the world. It didn’t suddenly mean Dean was fucking incompetent. It was like 35 years of driving experience, legal driving at least, meant nothing to this man. Fuck, Dean had once driven Sam and their father to the hospital in a complete white out blizzard, hydroplaning half the way through Mankato, without a scratch or a skid. Now there was a snowstorm.
Cas bent down for a kiss, and Dean took it.
Dean grabbed the underhang of the chrome bumper on the Caddy and pulled his creeper seat out from under the car. He’d been under there for at least 90 minutes, replacing hoses and allowing his knee to rest. Cas had been very pushy and adamant about Dean not overworking his knee the first week back at the garage under some misplaced notion of obligation or pride to prove he was feeling better than he was. Dean said no, of course he wouldn’t do that, he wasn’t an idiot.
Luís added, “Mimi said Cas said to send your ass home if you tried to push yourself too hard. Blame your man, bro.”
When he was younger, Dean only celebrated his birthday as an excuse to drink more than usual and as a sympathy pickup line for chicks. When he was even younger than that, as a way to score free desserts at restaurants and little else. Now, somehow his birthday was a whole event. Now there was a family friendly portion with cake and candles, and Jack, Claire, Sam, Eileen, and Cas watched a movie with him. Now there was a work portion, where his co-workers roasted him and got him stuff for his workstation. Now there was an exclusive part of his birthday for him and Cas alone, where he could expect everyone to give them special alone time and everyone would go along with it.
After a moment Dean added:
Cas, always oblivious to his own nudity, didn’t hesitate to go nursemaid and check Dean’s motility the same as he’d been doing for the last few weeks, but with his cock and balls totally exposed like that didn’t matter. He wrapped a warm hand around Dean’s calf and massaged down to his ankle, gentle and slow. He held on until Dean extended his leg as much as he could, then guided the heel of Dean's foot up to the vicinity of Cas’s shoulder.
Luís made a whip crack sound, and then both those little pissants broke into laughter. Which was at least better than being concerned for his safety just for standing up.
Dean sighed and allowed himself to be pulled back off the bed. And they even kept the shower relatively hands off, because Cas was pretty dedicated to proving a point when he wanted to be. Especially when it was annoying to Dean.
. He didn’t really stop people saying it normally, but it was date night and he was turning fifty, goddamn it.
“Nah, I’ll just get at the grease soap at home.”
“No, that’s not what I said.”
Dean’s phone buzzed in the pocket of his coveralls. It was a text from Sam. He checked the time first but it was only 8 minutes from the last time he looked.
“I’m not—my knee is fine. I’m not just leaving early because Cas said. I have to,” Dean realized too late exactly what he was doing. Trying to get out of one embarrassing hole by digging a different one. “Get ready,” Dean finished lamely.
Dean cleared his throat, and wrapped his knuckles on the desk as he walked away. “See you later, ladies. I’ve got a date with my boyfriend.”
Dean never learned to accept Cas’s extremely casual nudism with any kind of equal casualness, and something about his birthday made him way too eager to touch, so Dean leaned over just to pet the smooth and freshly moisturized angle of Cas’s jawline. Against his intentions, Dean’s hands slid down Cas’s neck and chest, over scars and enochian sigils that developed after Cas’s humanity, and stopped roughly at Cas’s hips. Dean’s thumbs traced the ridges of his hip bones. Really, Dean wasn’t trying to make it sexual. Without anyone around, without anything to preoccupy their time but being together, he just couldn’t resist being this close.
But Dean hadn’t expected spies. Brazen colluding against him, like Dean couldn't be trusted to just say when his knee was hurting too bad and needed a break.
Christ, he was so fucking old.
because he wanted to get back to Cas.
“Excuse me, it’s my birthday. I’m just about done with people younger than me bullying me on my birthday.”
Jack, in his new understanding of being a deity had spoken cryptically about how Castiel’s grace was deteriorating his human form. He had not been overly clear on his plan, but calmly indicated that the Winchesters—
There’s no retreat plan forming, and try as he might he can’t find it in himself to regret any fucking part of it.
He groans. “
As soon as the back of his legs hit the solid reassuring surface, Cas attempts to extricate himself from the hunter’s grip. Trying to be as premeditated as possible, knowing that he shouldn’t have let himself grow used to basking in the warmth of Dean Winchester.
“So I can come live here?”
Cas isn’t listening, picking at the toasted sandwich in front of him, trying to will himself some of the excitement that Dean always seems to feel about food. His human senses simmer with the intensity of his hunger, but he’s also confusingly melancholic and nauseated. His mind spins with the bartender’s words.
“I disobeyed a direct order for the second time that day, when I refused to remove the mark. You were
The other figure is stirring, hearing their voices “Well
“I mean.” Dean mumbles under his breath. “I'm not really the one who... if we are just being honest…”
Cas is already standing; moving to brew coffee, fingers brushing the side of Dean’s face as he does. The hunter tilts and kisses his fingers on the way past, surprising a wide smile out of the Angel.
How will he manage to tear himself away? Perhaps it would be worth going to the Empty, just for Dean to know how he feels.
He can feel the growing tension in the small space. The leather seat whines, breaking both the silence and the nervous energy,
But Dean
“Not going for the element of surprise then,” Balthazar calls, still keeping watch, knowing he isn’t heard; that in this moment nothing in or out of creation will keep Castiel, former Captain of the Garrison of the Most High, from Dean Winchester.

or his part, he was just relieved that the bunker walls were thick. Sam turned red the first few times Dean made comment about the noise. Now he just lived in a perpetual state of headphones in unless he can see that both of them are clothed.
“What the fuck are you doing?” He says.
Sam (of course)  is waiting outside Cas’ little bunker suite when Dean finally slips out. He rolls his eyes at the expression on his brother’s face and shrugs.
Cas rolls his eyes at Dean’s joke.
Eyes closed. Panic rises.
“Oh.” Dean flushes, continues awkwardly. “Uh, plus, I figured they were trying to trap you once I saw Belphegor. I mean, even from where I was sitting I could see they uh, they half-assed the warding sigils. No holy oil, but they had some sort of bastardized Devil’s trap with your name written in Enochian— I didn’t want you to get hurt— cause of me.”
Cas scowls.
Eileen being the absolute intuitive dream that she tends to be, signs something carefully to Sam with raised eyebrows and heads in the direction of the kitchen, taking the laptop with her. Sam watches her go with adoration, still unsure how a guy like him had managed to end up with a partner like her.
“Don’t play with fire.” Dean warns, ignoring Jack’s eyeroll.

She agreed to tether him as he passes through, and keep the portal from closing on him as long as she’s allowed to reclaim the Demons it holds. Both Amara and Jack have a soft spot for the Queen of Hell and agreed, there are caveats, but for the moment both cosmic powers are attempting to work in tandem.
The smell of Cas’ room is overpowering, it's the smell of hospice wards and closed forgotten places where senseless, brutal, death had occurred.
“Hey,” he calls, Cas’ eyes tighten microscopically at his approach before turning back to staring at nothing.
“Fuck— I’m sorry Cas.” Dean sounds choked, slapping a napkin over the spill, smiling and raising his hands at the rest of the concerned patrons, his words to Cas are low and apologetic. But he’s clearly upset. The Angel fights the urge to stuff the the rest of the sandwich in his mouth if there is a chance it will comfort the man beside him.
They open the Bunker for business, and he has to admit, it’s nice to have other people around, it feels lively, kinda like the
“Do you remember the first time we met?”
“Might have to rethink some nicknames.” He rumbles. “Not sure if you can call me that now that you’ve had your dick in my ass.”
Cas nods overly seriously, wondering how far he can take this particular amusement, “It has been done in the past, to specify spoils of war for those pledged exclusively to a member of the Host. There was a great deal of angel worship during certain eras...” His face is a interesting mix of nostalgia and gloomy disgust.
Sam and Eileen did their best to help him with his search, but being only recently reunited meant distractions.

“Dumb of ass. Right? Plus I was having a lot of trouble rationalizing that I was more into the concept of…guys and you being the one that—” He gestures, with middle school vulgarity, with Dean-centric cheekiness, and then smiles brightly when he realizes that both of his arms are functioning. “You fixed me.” His whole face lights up, taking an experimental swing. “Look at that.”
“Please ignore him.” Cas say kindly, interrupting his mental spiral, Krissy is off to the side snorting with unhelpful laughter. “He gets like this when we are around other hunters. ‘

. There is a solid chance he won’t freeze to death on his trudge back to the bunker.
"Hey, hey, hey—“ Dean gambles, He knows he sounds like a fucking broken record, and grabs Cas' face, jerking his eyes and attention back to him. “Stay with me here Cas— Listen to me, we never stopped looking for you, never. I would fuckin' die trying before I could leave you like that. You know that.”
His ears catch sudden fire, and he blinks, glad this one isn’t a fucking video chat, and mutters. “He told you about that?”
“Indeed. You were meant for Michael, a sacred vessel—”
“He’s not home.”

“And this has never come up?” She’s clearly stirring the pot, but they’re way too invested in in staring at one another fondly, with a side of possible lechery.
Sam's suspicions only increase as Dean awkwardly props himself against the inside of the doorjamb to the map room, beer in hand. His elbow slides down the wall with a comical whine, he tips, catching himself and frowns at Sam as though nothing happened.

“Wait, those beaches are…

The sword drops gleaming from Castiel’s sleeve, a careful, expert flip and he’s off at a run toward the door. Shadows rise around them, their true forms bite and gnash below the surface, eager to manifest into this plane.

Dean nods, “I’m still pissed at you, but side note: I had the weirdest fuckin’ dream Sammy,”
Eileen shrugs. “I would want the truth from Sam. Might suck now, but it’s better than finding out later. Sam says you guys always make it out the other side. Trust that.”

“Is there something wrong with my room?” He asks instead, Dean’s breath is warm on his chest, it’s already growing slower. “Dude.” He adds awkwardly, unsure if this is another one of Dean’s rituals.
Another finger added, scissoring and stretching. Dean’s legs pushes down on Cas’ shoulders, minutes tick by, lost in the sensation of Cas eating him alive.
Three fingers. He whines when Cas pulls them free, watching the way his rim clenches down on nothing, crawling up Dean’s body to kiss him deeply. His own cock again, heavy and thick between Dean’s thighs, Dean instinctively wraps his legs around Cas and grins slightly, needy and gasping.

For the first time, Cas is soft around the edges; mussed, his hair curling gently over his forehead. He hasn’t slept, he doesn’t sleep, watching over Dean. He smiles faintly, a twitch of the lips, the expression deepening the wrinkles around the Angel’s eyes.

He sees some of Sam’s fire in her, the same kind strength his brother had when he told their dad he was going to college. Dean’s impressed with who she is, the way she tries and still stays so kind. It’s not that she finds her calling and purpose in starting up a hipster coffee shop/car repair with an old, used-up, dropout like himself, it’s the prospect of having something that’s hers.

Though, that’s not entirely fair, maybe the rule is hunters tend to avoid spending time with people who don’t understand the job. Big jobs though tend to require more than your occasional two person team. When Bobby had arrived in their reality he had suggested (insisted, ordered, applied) the concept of hunting in teams.

Cas finds himself flipped onto his back, feels the familiar rush of watching Dean’s skill as a hunter repurposed into other parts of his life.
“You can use my truck.”
Even knowing the risk Castiel had insisted he try it, and go alone.

Cas waits.

“It is a full moon tonight.” The angel informs, rolling up the window obediently, eyes faintly luminous like a cat caught in headlights.
Then, as an afterthought, but he can still remember the color of the motel room where the Hunter seriously explained the value of one’s word.
An unexpected storm strikes Lebanon that night, the whole bunker shakes with the sound of the storm.

He does not trust her completely, or the Darkness she commands. But, this is a different world, and he is no hero; he will do his best to change it for the better, that is what he has left as purpose.
Cas kneels, cradling the hunter in his arms.
“It’s about Dean”
He reaches instinctively for the Angel-blade under his pillow, his fingers are tight and creaky in their gauze, they refuse to move properly. He preps to throw himself forward like a gauzy juggernaut; clenched fists stumbling clumsily, legs wrapped in his sheets.
“Flirting?” Sam supplies. “Wooing?”
e,” His nose wrinkles. “Some sorta progressive suburban mom shit.”
” She repeats, as if he didn't already know.
Cas' smile falters, and shakes his head, “I think, that you are a good god. You are kind, fair, and hopeful. No matter your choice you will have a home with me—“ He looks to Dean, who nods, “With us.”
He was already starting to lean away, a deep sadness in his voice. Dean watches all the ground he felt he’d gained falling out from under them, guilt rising, swallowing everything. He shifts and rotates carefully in the tub to speak directly to Cas, the plastic squeaking dramatically.
Dean said nothing. He was gripping the wheel so tight his knuckles bleached white.
And Castiel did miss him. He could ignore the ache, sometimes; in some ways, the Mark made that easier. But Jack, the boy he’d sworn to protect before he was even born, the one who was meant to usher in a bright future of peace on Earth, was gone. Castiel had failed him, just like he failed every other thing he cared about.
“Time for what, Sam?” Castiel asked.
Dean stares him down. “I love you. You remember that.”
The drive back to the bunker was silent as a graveyard. Castiel picked quietly at the blood beneath his nails. He only washed it away with a lick of his grace as they pulled into the garage, too ashamed to let the Winchesters see it.
They had a plan: Castiel would enter the box. That night, Dean and Sam would drive it out to some open field. There, they would dig a hole as deep as they could, and there, they would bury him. And there Castiel would stay, until the Earth burned in the heat death of the universe, and humanity would be safe from him.
“Cas, we can fix this,” he said. Castiel wondered if he had purposely used those words, if Castiel’s actions had reminded him of betrayals and sins long past or if it was just an accidentally significant turn of phrase. It didn’t really matter.
He fell asleep there at the table. Castiel sat beside him the whole night and healed the ache in Dean’s back and neck before he could even complain about it in the morning.
And Castiel and his rage, flying high in the wake of his kill, disagreed. He watched that boy die and only when the light went out of his eyes did he move further into the den.
“We gotta talk about what happened back there,” Dean said lowly. They were speeding away from Silver City, making good time to the Arizona border. They needn’t have bothered; there were no remains to be discovered, no scene to cover up. Castiel had made sure of that in the towering inferno of his rage.
“I love you too,” Castiel said, and kissed the gasp out of Dean’s mouth.
Dean laughed softly, shooting Castiel a look full of fondness. “I could get used to that.”
On a particularly bad day, running out of town after a grueling hunt, Castiel caught Dean staring again in the rear view mirror. The anger exploded out of him without warning.
The moment Sam crushed the spell, God threw his head back with a cry. His eyes started to glow, his limbs started to shake, and beyond that, beyond this small vessel he’d crafted for himself, Castiel could see his trueform–massive and incomprehensible even to him–start to contort. It was drawing back from its edges, an implosion contracting ever nearer to an infinitesimal point in space. Castiel squinted into the growing light, dimly registering Sam and Dean crying out and covering their faces, the shaking of the casino around them, the slot machines toppling over.
Dean’s eyes shot back to the road, his shoulders hunching around his ears. “Geez, sorry, didn’t mean anything by it.”
“Take care of yourself,” Castiel told him, “and take care of your brother.”
They’d narrowed down the location of the potential vetala den to two old buildings along the river, squatting within eyesight of each other. It was unclear which one the vetala pack was in, so they’d have to hit both simultaneously, to avoid spooking the monsters and having them escape.
“Figures, that as soon as we actually get things settled, shit hits the fan,” Dean said, throwing their machetes into the trunk and slamming it shut.
Both Sam and Dean slept late the day after they defeated God. Once Dean finally woke, he went to shower, returning ensconced in his robe and determined to make them an elaborate breakfast. Sam arrived just as the eggs finished and he even managed to crack a smile reflected in the eggs and bacon Dean had artfully arranged on his plate. He was mourning Eileen’s departure, that much was clear, but that smile gave Castiel hope that he would be okay. Eventually.
Castiel knew now, it was only a matter of time before the box became a necessity. The Mark could not be controlled, they knew that better than anyone. One day, it would drive him completely mad. And it would be a long, slow, and bloody trail to that day. And the Mark could not be destroyed, or all they had done would be for nothing and God would be unleashed upon the world again.
The horror overwhelmed the anger and Castiel crashed to his knees. He shoved Sam’s hand away and pressed his own to the wound and he poured every inch of grace he had into it.
“I will.” Castiel promised. If there was one thing he would remember, even in the madness of his bloodlust, it would be that.
Sam snorted, vainly trying to rub the congealed vampire blood out of his hair. “Story of our lives.”
“Well, no,” Sam said. He was leaning on the table, his eyes darting between Dean and Castiel. Castiel wondered if he found it hard to look at him now. “But there’s a big difference between being in a bad mood and this.”
, Castiel thought wryly, as his Father shrank to the smallest of dots and winked out completely with an earth-shattering boom.
He stared into her surprised face for a long moment, watching the shock and fear in her eyes. She didn’t understand what was happening. The pain was overwhelming. She wanted to be at home with her girls.
“Dean,” he snapped, “stop staring. I’m fine.”
Castiel glared at him, every part of him twisting into knots. “You think I don’t know that? You think I liked doing that? I have enough blood on my hands for several lifetimes, I don’t want to add more.”
“Heavy.”
“Yeah,” Dean said shortly. He was still holding Castiel’s wrist. Castiel thought about the warmth he could feel in Dean’s hand, a warmth that only days ago he thought he may never feel again. A warmth that, only days ago, he hadn’t known if he ever wanted to feel again, not from the hands that had held a gun on his son. Now, in this world where they were free, truly free, where the sound of Dean’s voice choking out apologies and forgiveness still echoed in his mind, those thoughts seemed completely alien. The consequences didn’t matter; the only place he wanted to be was here and he would take whatever hardship came with that.
Vetala were dangerous, agile. Castiel insisted the brothers move on one house together while he handled the other one.
The truth was this: the Winchesters had learned to give Castiel a wide berth in a fight, to stand clear when he was at the height of his rage. Jody didn’t know this lesson.
Castiel lurched up from the bed, panting. He didn’t know how much time had passed since he’d come here, how long the Mark had spent drilling into his thoughts, twisting them. His fingers were digging into arm, hard enough he could feel his nails breaking the skin. His stomach twisted at the thought of seeing the blood and Castiel wished he could feel nausea like humans could.
“I can’t lose you, man,” Dean finally whispered, almost too quiet to hear. “I just can’t.”
But it only takes so long to build anything, even something as powerful as the Mal’ak box. The day finally came when Castiel’s work was finished.
He preceded them down the hall to the room where the box awaited him. He paused, staring at the box. His tomb. He never really thought he would have one of those. He always figured if and when he died for good, he would be burned in a hunter’s pyre or unmade entirely. Now, eternity stretched before him again; even the threat of the Empty’s deal was meaningless, because how could he ever achieve true happiness now?
Dean’s face shattered anew. “But I love you,” he said and he sounded as lost as a child, “I love you.” He leaned his forehead against Castiel’s, cupping his cheek in his hand. Then he pressed a soft kiss to Castiel’s lip, brief but still the sweetest thing Castiel had ever tasted.
He turned to Sam, who immediately seized him in a fierce embrace. Castiel closed his eyes, held him close. After a long moment, Sam pulled away, wiping his eyes.
If he could be a fraction of that to someone who needed it, well, then, he could make his peace with it.
Cas took a long silence. The question was unanswerable, really. Luck had more to do with it than anyone wanted to know. But Cas was the one to spend time with them.
Dean stepped out of the walk-in but still watched Cas get dressed. He still dressed in a lot of layers when they went out, but usually wound up looking like a confused professor. And he always kifed an item or two of Dean’s. And Dean watched him put on both Dean’s black briefs and white button down. And sure, when Cas walked out he was wearing tan slacks and a dark green sweater with elbow patches, which a jacket folded over his arm.
Dean usually tried to ignore the bluetooth set up in Baby-- he’d finally been overrun by constant nagging in the name of how much more music he’d be able to access on his phone and working in a garage where people did those upgrades. Well, it sucked that everyone was right, but now the wait was bugging him, but he scrolled through his phone to find his Cas playlist to make the drive go faster.
Cas gave Dean a withering glare. And then with a speed and economy of moment Dean knew these kids would not have expected, Cas disarmed Alaina and dropped low to sweep her legs from underneath her. It was quick and violent enough that the other two froze in a moment of debating whether to move away from Cas’s threat range or back up their friend, unsure where their leisurely lesson was going.
“Seriously though, why don’t you get married? Don’t you have kids that are, like, older than me?” Elisa said.
Dean actually hadn’t wanted to change at work. Normally he did make an effort not to reek like the garage, especially if they were going out, but willing to risk the smell a little longer if it meant that no one would see him wearing a knee brace
rad, he decided.
So… Dean was bad at coming out. It was the only time he’d ever done it, so that’s not a big shock. But he wished he’d have just said at the time he was married. It wasn't like plenty of people didn't already assume they were married, just by seeing them together.
“No, you’re being purposefully obtuse. I didn’t say either of those things.”
Cas only had a slightly prickly, maybe, 5 or 7 o’clock shadow, and in all honestly Dean really liked the scrape of it more often than not, but Dean just needed a delay tactic.
“She’s got a point,” Dean said from the peanut gallery. “You look kinda tired. I’d put my money on her.”
That made Cas look grumpy and he pushed back against Dean’s hips spitefully. “Fine. I guess we don’t have time for handjobs in the shower either then.”
“Presumptuous?” Cas said with a hard squint.
“We have a reservation, Cas.”
“Hon. Sweetheart.” Dean said with exaggerated sweetness. “Angel.”
more hunters. He didn’t want more people inducted into hunting. But people got dragged into this life, usually through tragedy, and needed to learn as much as they could, as fast as they could or they’d get dead. Or worse, the whole damn mess could drive them to become like John Winchester, bringing their world crashing down around their own families. There was certainly no guarantee they would get a Bobby Singer handed to them to help them navigate through it.
“Yeah, be fair,” RJ said to Luís. “He’s got the big five-oh steakhouse dinner date tonight. He’s got to get moving if they want to be home in time for Jeopardy.”
But the extent of Dean’s relationship to RJ and Luís could really only be described was “guys in a garage.” They talked about cars and not much else. Although he and Luís did spend last summer heatedly updating each other about the season tournament for Wrestlefest when they were visiting Kansas City. They knew Dean was with a man, and actually seemed to, like, not want to offend what they thought were Dean’s gay sensibilities. Which was awkward but nice. So there wasn’t even much traditional macho bullshit Dean had been used to with “guys in a garage” when he was younger. But the closest they got to bonding was basically insulting each other and laughing about it.
Mimi said, “Your boyfriend always takes you there on your birthday every year, doesn’t he? It’s sweet.”
Dean rolled his eyes and sent:
“Well... “
“Aren’t you forgetting something?”
Dean easily pressed the soul of his good leg’s foot on Cas’s chest. “Wow, babe, I get this kind of vibe you’re not just doing this for my health.”
“Sorry,” Dean mumbled.
And obviously, Dean didn’t think there was anything wrong with that, that’s why he did it every year. He had reasons for liking the sedate, normal routine he’d never really had in his life before semi-retiring from hunting.
Despite knowing the drill from Claire, that the two older men were basically Claire’s dads and the bunker was a training center where Dean and Cas were a team, the girl preened a little at the compliment.
Dean could see the exact image of Sam’s prissy bitchface he was undoubtedly making in hi-def clarity as if Sam were right in the garage with him. Of course he could; Dean had only seen it every day of his life.
“I'm good, man, just shaking the dust off.”
followed by a winky face emoji, a champagne popping emoji, and an eggplant emoji.
Cas just ignored him and picked up Dean’s thighs with a push. Dean took the hint and was happy to shuffle himself up the bed a little more. Cas pulled open the velcro strip to take off Dean’s lumbar belt, which he was less happy about. Dean didn’t like wearing it, but he needed to-- nearly 40 years of digging, fighting, hauling, and all the other shit a hunter had to do hadn’t been kind to his knees or his back. The decades of beers and burgers had also built up, and since his hunting life had slowed way down, Dean’s spare tire had, uh, expanded a bit. When Cas let loose the tension in his belt, Dean didn’t feel totally unlike William Shatner being let out of his girdle.
Second of all, Dean fucking hated
But he also deeply understood why it made the two single dudes that were, literally now, half his age, and had spent the better part of the afternoon loudly talking about what clubs they were going to hit up that weekend, laugh out loud. He couldn’t help but look at himself through them and he saw an old man who sounded pained when he stood up too quick, didn’t know how cars made after the year 2000 worked, and had predictable scheduled dates in stolid boring steakhouses where other old couples had predictable scheduled dates.
Dean bridled a little at her phrasing.
Not because he wanted to get back to Cas.
Of course he got another text in reply, because his life was filled with spiteful, contrary bastards who all thought they were funny. It was just another eggplant emoji, but she did that thing Dean didn’t know how to do where it exploded like little word bubbles all over the screen when he looked at it. Then she sent another text that read,
As much as he wanted to get back home, it took a while to actually leave. He lingered at his station out of necessity and good housekeeping mostly, but also because he was mildly disgruntled over being harassed by twentysomethings. So he rushed through clean up, put away his tools and oil rags, brought the car back down to her wheels, and took some time with the degreaser to get his nails somewhere approaching clean enough for date night. By the time he tarped the Caddy it was almost 3:00.
The reservation was at 7:00 pm, but it was about a two-hour drive, longer if it did start snowing. He needed to shower and get garage stink off him. He had to take Miracle for a walk. He had to corral Cas into getting dressed on time, or he’d be sitting around in his slutty yoga pants reading some forbidden text on omens or some shit until quarter after 5 if Dean let him. He needed to leave early for logistics.
Cas hefted this leg with less gentless above his shoulder. He kissed the inside of Dean’s ankle up to his calf up to his knee. Then there he was, kneeling on the bed, looming into his space suddenly with a determined hungry look. With his leg draped over Cas’s shoulder, Dean flexed a little to pull him in closer. Cas’s hand snaked unto the leg of his jockies and curled ponderously around Dean’s dick, and then his sack. It was more like the slow massaging he’d been doing, than actively jacking him off, though his dick was definitely starting to twitch in interest.
, and they made his ass look hot, and shoved the small box in a front jean pocket. The left one so Cas was less likely to reach into it on a whim, because sometimes Cas got horny whims and he had never once respected the idea of Dean’s personal space.
Really, Dean would have left at lunch if he hadn’t felt a twinge of guilt for shirking his responsibilities. It was his first week back after his time off from his knee surgery and he hadn’t gotten much done all week. But he’d spent most of the day debating himself on how early was too early to leave. He figured after 2:00 was safe. Not too early. Not overcompensating by working a full shift. Like really, who could expect that of him?
“Fear is part of becoming human,” Cas said. “Whether it helps or hinders you depends on your reaction to fear, not having fear itself.”
She turned to Mimi conspiratorially. “Which white boy won’t commit? The busted ken doll looking one who’s in love with his car or the old time-y detective one who can’t make small talk to save his life?”
somehow, by god, we will actually get to the date portion of this date.
“Shut up. Are you ready?”
If Cas caught that he used the wrong verb for people who were always human, Dean couldn't tell. Didn’t really matter. It applied either way.
“You have some kind of plan that requires me to be close shaven?”
She was shorter than Cas but had broad-ish shoulders under her denim jacket and pretty muscular legs in her skinny jeans and combat boots. She looked like a healthy, capable, athletic twentysomething, ready to rumble. And it wasn’t like Cas looked sickly or anything, but by comparison he appeared to be a guy in his mid-50s with lots of crow’s feet, permanent eye baggage, and now pretty pronounced salt and pepper. Not quite slim anymore, not obviously muscular. He was even barefoot, and wearing lounge pants and an old bleach-stained Iron Maiden t-shirt of Dean’s. He looked like he was just off a wake and bake, instead of leading a knife fight workshop.
Dean rolled his eyes.
“Think they’ll be alright?”
The drive home to the bunker was kind of a long commute by design. A lifetime of marathon driving sessions meant the 35 minute drive home was usually relaxing for Dean. A little chance to unwind, barring any stressed out hunter trying to get a hold of him about why their supposedly simple salt and burn wasn’t taking or a paranoid call from Sam when he couldn’t get a hold of Cas for some reason.
He’d found himself standing for conversations he didn’t need to, carrying things he could have put on a cart, picking up his pace when he should have just slowed down, most of the time he’d been in. And then pretending that spending most of his time after lunch on his wheeled creeper chair was just a coincidence.
. Which got a quick response.
“But who said for sure you’re the stronger opponent,” green-haired girl said. “You’re just a dude.”
Cas raised his eyebrows at being fed a brassy line, but opened the door of the medicine cabinet anyway. “I was teasing before, but now I really don’t know about how,” he paused for air quotes, “‘lucky’ you’re going to get this weekend.”
“I like it just fine. And I want you to have your enormously oversized slab of birthday meat. You’re the one who’s always worried about getting there on time.”
The garage he worked in was small-- part of a series of buildings at Jake’s Repair & Restoration-- only two lift stations and was used almost exclusively for custom work. The two mechanics at the other station were young guys named RJ and Luís. Dean took only classic cars for repairs, refits, and restoration. RJ and Luís did custom paints, decals, refurbs, and tech upgrades mostly. Sometimes they worked together on a project when someone wanted work done on a classic body with high tech upgrades to the guts and electronics.
Cas pushed his hands down on Dean’s shoulders and abruptly got off of him. “No. We’re going to be late,” Cas said in the extremely malicious tone of someone who never ever cared about being on time anywhere before that very moment.
One of the kids in the practice room, the girl with dyed green hair he thought was called Alaina, caught one of Cas’s overhand attacks. She made the mistake of trying to overpower him instead of getting out of his range of attack. As Dean suspected, Cas’s next move was to let go of his knife and used his free hand to catch the falling blade. He gently pressed the knife handle under the girl’s exposed ribs in a silent expression of
Dean had a plan and he wanted to follow it. He had a whole once in a lifetime 50th birthday weekend ahead of him to exploit to its full potential. He did want to pace himself. He could luxuriate in it like he never could when he was younger.
Dean sighed. “We do need to actually get in the shower and get going.”
“Do not say boyfriend,” Dean said. “That’s the stupidest word.”
Dean paused for a second because now she wasn’t teasing anymore. And yeah, he was here working a normal job with normal people, mostly passing as a normal person himself, but so much of his life was still redacted and he never expected this to be a thing he couldn’t explain. The things he maybe could talk about-- growing up absolutely terrified of people knowing him as queer, never thinking he’d be alive long enough to actually get married-- he didn’t want to.
in response said something either really gross or really rad about what long term relationships did to a person. Dean couldn’t tell.
Dean gestured to himself, firmly on two feet, and even took a few steps to prove he could walk. He didn't even limp. It wasn’t even that much of a front. Yeah, he’d overdone it a little during the week, but the low throb wasn’t too bad. His knee didn’t feel like giving out. He would be fine and that wasn’t a lie.
“Your filthy car onesie smelled terrible.”
Dean checked the bowl outside the kitchen for Cas’s stupid cat. Cas had argued that it would be beneficial to have a mouser because human habitation in the bunker blah blah blah, ventilation and food storage yadda yadda yadda. And Eileen and Sam had backed him up saying the bunker was so big, it wouldn’t affect Dean’s allergies all that much. But Dean was pretty sure it was all just a sneaky plan because the first thing Cas did was name the little monster Mafdet after some ancient cat goddess, bought a quilted cat bed, and handed Dean a bottle of claritin. Now there were freaking cat highways all over the place she used to hiss at Dean from whenever he had to take a leak or get a snack in the middle of the night. Whatever, she mostly stayed out of his way and made Cas happy.
“And you’re making us even later with your yapping! Get dressed, weirdo!”
After a long moment of looking handsome and stoic in profile, squinting at the horizon the car full of young hunters had disappeared into, Dean’s resolve broke down. He pulled Cas into his arms, chest to chest, and kissed him. And kissed him again, and then again for a long, deep, tongueful time. Cas’s hands slid up Dean’s back to his shoulders and back down. Cas’s right hand even kneaded into that spot just above his tailbone that always felt tight at the end of the day. Cas found it right away every time.
“You sure?” RJ said.
“Well, you know me, I’m--”
“You alright, man?” Luís said.
She shot back:
Being alive enough to savor the mundane was also proof that he wasn’t the same anymore. That, and the idea of doing now what he thought was fun when he was twenty-five made him fucking exhausted just thinking about it.
And he knew if he said anything, the Spock to his Kirk here would just tell him it was an illogical thing to worry about since Cas was in love with Dean’s soul, and had given up being an immortal angel for Dean, and was currently sitting naked on top of him.
Cas wasn’t really taking them to task or anything at the moment-- stopping every once in a while to rearrange someone’s stance or handhold, pressing the edge of his hand against exposed weak points of each of the kids. Maybe these kids had gotten familiar with shotguns, but they were pretty obviously uncomfortable with knives in their hands.
Cas rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to stay home. I’m just saying you could pick a more convenient locale.”
When they were driving away, Dean finally gave in and pressed right into Cas’s side and slid his arm around Cas’s back. The air was chilly, but it wasn’t snowing yet. He wanted to touch more than that, but settled for behaving like a normal person and not mauling Cas in the open air like a horny teenager. He gripped the spot right above Cas’s hipbone as the kids drove away.
A text from Eileen popped up:
He was hoping to slip out without interruption, but he had to leave through the reception room where Mimi and Elisa, the receptionist and Mimi’s 19-year-old niece, were.
Dean scoffed at Sam’s put upon tone. Like Sam and Eileen weren’t going to take full advantage of their sexile in Santa Rosa. Dean would’ve bet everything in his wallet that the hustle in their step finding some guys bones had very little to do with the general threat level and more to do with having a full day off tomorrow away from the bunker.
Cas smelled like sweat and BO and faintly like potting soil. The fact that this made Dean
Dean’s malingering paid off because it meant he and Cas could take a shower together. It meant they got to undress together, which was always fun.
Everyone else at the garage knew Dean Winchester was cagey about his past, his family, but they all thought it was because he was a recovering alcoholic. It was Dean’s background reason for not having a super detailed employment history he could admit to. And hey, not a total lie. They knew Cas as a somewhat reclusive researcher and translator of ancient texts, which was uninteresting enough that people didn’t ask much about it, and sometimes a thing Cas was actually paid to do by other hunters and academic weirdos. They knew the only family Dean and Cas had were Dean’s brother and two adult children that were now living out of state. Jack and Claire were implied to be from Cas’s life before Dean.
Cas was running the kids through armed sparring. They must have been at unarmed combat for a while before. Cas had some sweat lines under his pits and the girls’ hair looked a little frazzled. In one subtly slick move, Cas used the boy to show them how to use someone’s knife against them in a rear chokehold.
“You should stretch the other leg, for balance,” Cas said, the tone of his voice deeply unprofessional compared to his words, making eye contact back and forth approximately in the area of Dean’s mouth and Dean’s chest.
Having spent most of the day feeling busted and old, Dean was pretty pleased he could flip the switch on Cas’s fierce and lustful gaze that quick, even while still wearing his old man lumbar support belt.
“Boning.” Dean finishes, confidence returned, his mouth curved, “Knockin’ boots—“ He forms a circle with the finger and thumb of one hand and then uses the other to do an in-and-out motion universally recognized by middle schoolers everywhere. “Spelunking the bat cave—“
“I dunno dude, probably?” His eyebrows crunch together, “But uh, can we tell Billie no more experiments into other realities for like, a month?
not worth it and for some reason that makes Dean furious.
The Empty swirls around his feet, creeping up and around to pull him down, ever down.
Erin seems to get it, talks enough for both of them, does her best to keep things light when he has low days. A couple of well-meaning people assume she’s after him, he listens to their insinuations stiffly ready to jump in and defend her honor, until she laughs and shakes her head, changing the subject with a natural ease.
The hunter suggests a drive, as that is what makes him feel better when memories and fear chokes out reality and hope slips down the drain at random.
, don't be gross.”
Eileen insists that Dean joins her on about 2 hunts a month, she tells him it’s good for him, keeps him limber. So they hunt monsters, and humans who act like monsters. Best of all, she doesn’t talk about Cas.
Cas as a father, shines. He listens and comments, and shares advice and jokes; even laughs at a couple Dean makes.

— Jack…” He clears his throat nervously, he wasn’t built for this kind of conversation. Cas is suddenly busy watering the succulents in the window. The way he tips his head though, Dean knows he’s listening.
“Dean are you unwell? You seem— fevered.” His eyes shine faintly like they could throw sparks if he was stirred up enough. He’s reaching instinctively toward Dean’s face, catches himself and drops his hand with a scowl.
Cas watches him go, already missing the heat of his touch and despising himself for it. The yearning isn’t new. It has been part of who Cas is in one form or another ever since, well nearly the beginning.

“A little.” He admits, “But not of you.” He quickly follows up, noticing for not the first time that his brother is taller, broader and yet so used to hiding the bits of him that stick out.
Krissy frowns, twisting around to look where he’s nodded his head. She smirks.
The stolen face smiles a glacial smile, there is no warmth in the stolen green eyes that stare out, but there is a glint of fear.
They’ve been sleeping in the same room for two days, waking up together, falling asleep wrapped up in each other.
"Dean..."
enthused about the concept, but not wholly opposed, and already warming to idea, which has become apparently a standard response to most ideas Cas throws out in regards to their life now.
“Nah Cas- we didn’t meet then, that’s not how— shit, I thought you were some demon trying to drag me back to hell,” Dean unzips the top and pulls out two thermos’ and a couple hand warmers handing one of each to the angel.

“Me and Cas— we are just—“
Cas stays stiff, barely keeping his breathing under control, his humanity making him react so intensely to touching Dean. “Anyway… I don’t, I don’t really know if I want to do it anymore.”
Dean smirks down at the page, “The garden one’s pretty good too though…”
He is no longer one rebellious angel, he is a multitude of heaven, and he is fearsome to behold in his wrath.
flawless beyond words but her trunk space is a little limited.” He whispers the last bit, as though she might hear.
“Balthazar.” Her eyes jump to the celestial in question, standing slightly behind Castiel who turns and glowers.
Meg smiles. She looks good, like before, not covered in black gunk and too weak to stand on her own.
“—you little—”
“Yep, got that when you almost burnt my eyes out.”
Dean asks over the sound of sizzling grease, his exact tone indicating he’s asking ‘can you be equally as dead?'.
Don’t worry about it
“One. In particular.”
Cas’ face softens. Dean tears his eyes away to look at Sam, daring him to react poorly even though they both know that’s not gonna happen. “We all on the same page?”

Cas turns and smacks his back, wiping the goo gently from the other’s face, clearly concerned at their lack of movement. A trickle of grace glides across into them; Jack watches curiously. The unknown figure rolls onto his knees and retches black goo.
If Dean were any less constantly aware of his need to display manliness in every moment, he would have clutched his pearls in distress. His voice raises a couple scandalized octaves, “ But, i’m the

He tries to ignore the way his ears flush, confident that Cas won’t notice in the semi-darkness.
He looks over at Cas who’s gazing at him, “So I guess, I mean. I’ve been… Um… I’ve been talking to someone about stuff. And going to, uh, to AA. I obviously had to switch some stuff around, cause like, no one’s a therapist for the guy who kills god—Cause that’s a one way trip to a rubber rooms and shit like that. But like—“ He swallows.
Dean's good mood evaporates instantly.

Cas drops his gaze suddenly; Dean can hear the whisper of movement, like birds’ wings. “You know about the fall of the Empty?”
One night in February his phone goes off.

conversation went.
A longer pause, “
So here's the deal. Of course they love each other, but Dean needed to find value  in not living in fear of the future and Cas needed to forgive himself and stop living in the regret of the past.
His eyes are the same, glowing incandescently for an instant, the only indication of his near-deity. A half second later another familiar figure pops into place beside him.
One hand curls around Dean’s throat.
Dean doesn’t talk for a while, Cas is concerned that his storytelling skills have somehow lapsed and Dean has fallen asleep or lost interest entirely.
Balthazar steps in. “Shouldn’t let him rile you up.” He says, “Exorcise him and we can go home.”

“Okay,” He pushes past what Jack is telling him, trying to think like a longtime Hunter, and absolutely not about what this new knowledge is doing to his heart. “So why doesn’t he remember now that he’s out?”
Jack shouts from the kitchen when the door bangs shut; Cas flinches away, and whatever Dean might have said died on his lips.
The demons recognize them in an instant, Belphegor’s host falls backward, he takes one moment and a cloud of black smoke is released from his mouth.
“What was that for?” Dean asks stupidly, still hasn’t opened his eyes. Sitting there like a dumbass on their kitchen floor with his eyes closed.
Dean sputters, knocking into his coffee mug,
His fists fall open, and he loses all momentum, sinking back against the pillow.
It’s cheesy, and awkward, Dean’s nearly forgotten how to talk to people who actually know him. Sam knows him better than anyone, loves him regardless; Asks him questions anyway.
Dean curses his body still as a statue, the pancake hits the countertop.
He meets her Dad outside, barrel chested and belligerent. He’s angry and overwhelmingly petulant for someone so large. Dean doesn’t want to admit he sees a deep reflection of himself in those swollen, raging eyes.
“What?” Dean sulks. “
well.
Before he can take more than three steps Dean is seizing his wrist and whipping him around. Dean honestly looks to be a healthy mix between pissed and exasperated.
He even manages to go on few dates, hunters and civvies, guys and girls who’re bold enough to try to engage him in conversation that isn’t work related. He’s always surprised when they ask, but he never turns them down.
“Also.” Dean puts a dramatic hand across his heart. “I

“Yeah well I’m pretty sure, Other Dean and Other Cas were sorta together.”
There’s something though, in the way he moves that catches Liam’s eyes. It’s not quite obvious, but it makes his scalp prickle.
“Yes.” He replies tonelessly squinting a little; she can see the worry in his eyes, “You will help?”
Dean relaxes, yeah of course it’s more for Sam and Eileen, not the mental countdown timer to their… whatever it was.

When he showed back up he pretended it never happened, finally started treating me like a hunter, threw out all my kid stuff.” He sucks his teeth and rattles the ice in the glass. “I think he thought I needed toughening up.” He looked like he’s tasted something foul,
Dean stands outside Cas’ door, his heart pounding. Hand raised to knock. It’s late, everyone else has pretty much gone to bed.
Something deep inside Dean unclenches and it feels sort of like snorting a line of coke (one time, when he was a demon okay?). He curls his fingers in tighter, interlocking Cas’ with his and pulls him tight and close. Their shoulders brush.
“Nevermind he’s home— try not to suffocate between Eileen’s thighs, kay?”
Dean shivers, staying silent, he can see in the change in the Angel’s eyes, the possessive glint of a predator.
well that's something he doesn't even have to think about getting behind.
Sam's eyes go wide, like he's seriously debating all of the life choices he's made to get this point.
"I did." Cas answers seriously, holding his eyes, "I always do."
“Ri-ight.” Sam holds out the vowel skeptically. “Not creepy, Roger that.”
Cas is still holding onto his sweaty palm, Dean stares at their hands like he just realized, Cas follow his gaze; drops it apologetically like it burns.
charge, I wished to continue protecting you. Zachariah and Uriel eventually agreed, thinking our bond would allow me to influence you into accepting your destiny. As time went on, I became the only angel you trusted and asked for. You can see how that turned out.”
“—Well…Not anymore…as much.” Dean mutters, and then softly, not meant to be heard but heard nonetheless. “Not for like 12 friggin’ years.”
Meg detaches herself from a nearby shadow and saunters up to the waiting duo. Temporary Captain of the heavenly host or not, he looks annoyed and fidgety.
“Dean this is—“
Cas turns this over and over in his mind, eyes locked with Dean’s, one hand on his throat, the other moves slowly, almost involuntarily up the denim of Dean’s pants to the waist. The air has gone so still, all they can hear is each other’s breathing and the pop as Cas undoes the button. With a feather-light touch, he finds the tab of the zipper. He stares intensely at the flecks of light reflected by Dean’s green irises, watching every little emotion play out on his face as they stand, almost locked in time, listening to each little pop of zipper teeth coming undone, one by one, as he moves the zipper down ever so slowly. Nervousness, overwhelmed with excitement, yearning, anticipation, lust, and that ever-present Dean Winchester self-satisfied smugness, that right now, Cas isn’t sure if he loves or hates.
Dean’s eyes widen, then narrow suspiciously, “Dude, you haven’t been human for like 9 months—”
“We were surrounded by dead monsters and

Castiel’s blue eyes meet his, vulnerable and soft, so uncertain. “Jack was very excited, it is a good memory.” He agrees, “One of the last positive ones I can place, everything is very… fuzzy.” His shoulders relax very slightly. Dean tries not to grin as Cas picks up a piece of bacon experimentally, taking the tiniest of bites, humming in faint happiness at the crunch and taste.
“I do not recall that.” Cas can feel the uncomfortable beginnings of a human blush, his face dropping into what Dean fondly refers to as ‘resting bitch angel’, “And I have never once been adorable.”

Tears bubble into Cas’ eyes at the words, he blinks them away and wipes his eyes, Dean must be rubbing off on him.

Sam grins and shrugs, “Listen dude, I love you, and dream or not, I know that this is your way of avoiding talking about what’s going on with you and Cas. I’ve been your third wheel for like 10 years and I’m not an idiot.”
He doesn’t burn the jacket.
He plops himself at the end of the bed a little too hard and wheezes. Damn creaky old man bones.

Dean shreds the paper and pauses, fingers drifting faintly on the outside of the simple sketchbook, when he looks up his eyes are big and shy.
“We’ve got time Cas.” The hunter says, gesturing to the field they're sitting in, empty for miles. “If you think you can uh, clear your schedule.”
Dean’s already flipped onto his stomach, he’s shimmied out of his jeans in the in-between, and lays there watching with one eye as Cas putters around the room, unpacking his duffel in his methodical unhurried way. Of course he didn’t do

“You uh, you look good Cas— they’re— you’re— it’ll be fine” His voice cracks, and Dean could swear that he hears the telltale laugh of a floppy-haired sasquatch around the corner. “Uh— I mean, are you ready to go? You cool if we take the Impala?” He’s up and on his feet, ready to flee.
"Save your breath Sammy." Dean swipes the coffee pot from behind his brother, and starts filling it with water, hoping a natural rhythm will make this argument go faster, "We both know what you're about to say. And we both know I'm gonna ignore you and do whatever the hell I want, so we might as well—"
Castiel doesn’t seem to share his eagerness,
(it hadn’t made sense then either) but, Dean had been clearly proud of his little foray into the whimsical and Cas was too new to being near Dean to distrust anything he said.
Perhaps a chicken...

bar for crying out loud… can you just let me finish my damn thought before you start jumping to conclusions?”

Dean Winchester's mouth falls open, snaps shut with an audible click, opens again and his lips curl back into a snarl; whatever he was about to say is thankfully interrupted by the coffeemaker's plaintive beep.
As expected, Dean rolls his eyes, a light flush across his cheekbones.
“For me to mystically wed you during our dramatic intercourse without your consent?” His eyebrow arches, he knows it distracts the hunter, but he does it anyway.
“So you said.” Cas murmurs.
“Uh-huh, yep.” Dean still hasn’t raised his head. “Whatever you say bud.”
“I guess it makes sense though, some random guy calls up and says that he ‘used the google’ to find us.”
They’re inside out, tag sticking up with faded familiar initials written in large, block caps,
Dean's eyes dart to Cas who has suddenly found Dean's tiny line of succulents
Dean straightened his belt and ran a hand over the gift box in his pocket. “Oh, I’ve actually been ready for a while.”
To their credit, the kids could tell there was some kind of meaningful doublespeak going on, but without knowing what they could only look around awkwardly.
He couldn’t say why bother getting married when I already made him my soulmate.
Nothing had happened. Sure, it sounded like Dean had slammed his hand under the hood or maybe been crushed under a falling engine block. But no, he
Not that Dean or Cas had always been good at following through on that in their own lives, but it was solid, safe advice for kids that were probably going to be facing many opponents stronger than they were.
Dean thought maybe the skinny girl with brown hair, Tara, maybe?, was thinking the same thing he was, the way she scanned over Cas’ forearms, baby blues, and thighs as he worked her friend over. He couldn’t really blame her and he kept nagging Cas not to wear those damn pants in mixed company. It was just indecent. Dean winked at her and she blushed.
That made them laugh harder.
He was underneath the body of a 1939 Cadillac 75 Series town car. It was some vintage collector’s from Denver who’d been waiting to commission Dean for a restoration for the last five months. Partly due to Dean’s surprise meniscus repair and partly due to the demand for Dean’s services. Pretty much from November to May Dean was steady booked with back to back commissions from Midwestern collectors who wanted their classic cars in perfect condition for car shows.
him the nude looking like a salt and pepper snack, Dean felt a little lacking in comparison.
The kids laughed a little at the break in tension. Or at the momentary relief of not being the sole focus of Cas’s attention, which could be overwhelming for normal people.
“I’ll always take care of you, Dean. The same you do for me.”
He replied, “Fuck no. Cas and I don’t dance. Well, at least not on dancefloors. Wait, hey, how much do you and Cas talk? Because I didn’t know you had this conspiratorial life plan thing for me going on. Or is the gossip in this place that bad?”
, would be a little jealous now at the stability he had. Shitty twenty-five-year-old Dean probably would also be killed stone dead to see himself settled down, working a civilian job more often than hunting, and married to a man. And then would probably pop right back out of the grave just to call him lame for betraying his freedom and manliness in such a godawful boring way.
and Dean just wasn’t going to dignify that with a response because as of tomorrow morning he would be fifty.
When he got home, Dean nearly jogged inside -- his still healing knee made it more of a hobble.
“You gonna make it to Junction City in time?”
Dean paused and stood up straighter, squaring his shoulders, hoping his face wasn’t beet red.
Cas occasionally took Dean on something he thought of as a Cas date. It was sometimes a trip to a museum or planetarium, but mostly a trip to a park or natural landmark, where Cas would talk with personal knowledge about life during the Cambrian era or the glacial events that made the lake they were looking over. Those Cas dates seemed to provide him the same kind of contentment that Dean got from driving Cas someplace in the Impala and feeding him dinner.
And sure enough, Cas barely contained a disapproving eyeroll and slipped the palms of his hands over Dean’s chest down to the soft sides of his belly. “That’s nothing you need to worry about. It’s not a chore.” Cas lifted a hand and brushed over Dean’s forehead. For a second there was the old familiar feeling of shivering nerves before Cas healed him, but that little electric embrace of grace touching him from cell to cell was long gone. Cas just had warm hands now. Not entirely un-electric in their own way.
Dean laughed, but felt a little bad. If his knee were up to snuff, Cas probably might’ve taken Dean’s antagonism out on Dean.

A very funny response from Sam Winchester, or in a conversation for the Winchesters at all. Everyone in the family could clean, assemble, and load a shotgun in their sleep. No one here even remembered what a normal response to danger was.
he did not say.
Thank fuck, Mimi could sense the palpable dread coming off Dean, and she stepped in with her niece. “People don’t get married for lots of reasons. Don’t be rude.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, I’m not going to dress up like a cowboy just because it's your birthday.”
Then Cas did put Dean's heel on his shoulder, sliding one hand down to release the velcro strips of Dean's knee brace. He tossed it aside and rubbed the underside of Dean's calf.
“What’s wrong with boyfriend?” Elisa said.
“Too much?”
He had no idea how to tell them they were wrong-- Luís and RJ, and shitty twenty-five-year-old Dean too. That the boring part couldn’t possibly be boring to him anymore because he was happy to be alive now, even if it meant getting old. Because he was too in love, and yeah goddamn it, fucking whipped to think the boring part was boring or that freedom was anywhere else than in choosing what he chose.
Dean slid his phone back in his pocket, but there was a hesitation before the next buzz where he could almost feel the incoming nagging reverberating through the cell signal. He was just going to ignore it. That resolve only lasted about four seconds though, and he checked his phone again.
Mimi rolled her eyes and snapped her pen on her clipboard. “You’re still in your coveralls, dumbass. Go air out now. Let me tell you, the last thing I want to smell on a night out on the town is the combined stench of motor oil and sweaty gearhead.”
“Would you wanna shave that handsome mug for me, babe?”
Today, Cas was training some kids sent their way by Claire. She found them on the trail of a vampire nest and totally underprepared to take it on. The soonest they could get to Kansas had been Thursday. And it had been easier to just let them stay overnight, so Cas had more time to get them prepped.
“Yeah, well I was going home for the day anyway so save yourself the trouble of reporting to Mimi.” Who was apparently reporting to Cas. Dean knew teaching Cas to use a cell phone had been a mistake.
Really, it made Dean think of his birthday as more like an anniversary for him and Cas.
Dean paused, glancing at Elisa. Dean leaned down and whispered, “Mimi, I’m not gonna tell you about my birthday sex plans with Cas.”
Dean stuck around until Cas was ready to usher the kids out of the bunker. Cas seemed eager to wrap up with them, but refused all assistance from Dean, and kept telling him to sit down somewhere. Dean stubbornly remained, mostly leaning against the practice room wall, and listed creative ways garot a vampire with helpful demonstrations and helped pack a case of holy water for them when they left anyway. He tacked on as many pitiful words of wisdom he could think of, hoping anything or everything would help them hold it together.
Dean took a few concerned steps forward. “What he means is basically err on the side of caution. Look, I baited you. You’re young and ready for a fight, so I fed that because I knew Cas can kick your ass. Cas can kick a lot of people’s asses. You’d be stupid to be offended by that; it’s a big club. Here in the bunker, that’s safe and you can learn from that. Out there, you may not be able to survive if you don’t adapt quickly to everything you learn.”
Dean ignored the heated feeling on his face, rolled out his shoulders to appear at maximum height and size, and tried to pull a big bad hunter expression, like he was considering kicking RJ’s ass. What he was actually doing was feeling out if his knee was locked up or not, or if maybe as a surprise his back was causing the trouble this time, because that was the stage of life he was at now. Any part of him could just go into catastrophic failure if he moved the wrong way, apparently.
Green-haired girl glared up at Cas from the floor. “So you’re saying always be afraid. We’re helpless.”
part 3 coming jan 30th. EDIT: oops lift shit i'm running late, still working on it.
In fact he had a monthly date night with Cas, but it was only for his birthday he bothered driving all the way to Junction City to go to Hanneman’s. Which he’d done the entire time he’d worked at Jake’s.
Dean wasn’t about to deny him, even though it was several hours before he’d assumed they’d get to this point. He still hassled him about it as he wriggled out of his underwear. “We haven’t even made it to the shower yet and you’re all up on my dick. Thought I smelled terrible.”
“That turned out less sexy than I was aiming for,” Dean said through a sigh, slowly unbending his knee. It detracted a bit from seeing Cas pull off his slutty yoga pants and underwear all in one go.
Dean could definitely feel the stretch in his hamstring but his knee wasn't locked. He was able to keep a little bend because Cas wasn't standing too close, so he shook his head.
Dean scowled and pulled away, unimpressed with this verbal trap Cas somehow laid for him. But whatever. He could definitely have patience.
That was pretty much true and basically why Dean’s bad achy knee had evolved into a bad torn meniscus surgery in the first place, but it still felt insulting.
“We’re running late,” Dean said, kissing Cas’s neck.
The shitty twenty-five-year-old Dean that still occupied some part of his brain, the one that would only half ironically say shit like
“You gonna try to limp your ass on the dancefloor tonight, birthday boy?” Mimi said.
Cas wasn’t even wearing a towel because he was a nuisance in addition to being a goddamn maniac.
“Elbow patches?” Dean snorted.
He’d gotten better at sharing, but, you know.
Luís also walked under the hydraulic lift from the other side of the ugly ass Hummer they were detailing, apparently looking to see what happened.
He palmed the box as best he could, in case Cas walked in early, and he walked into the closet to pull on his knee brace and rapid-change into his date clothes. He put on his nice jeans since Hanneman’s was nice, but not, like,
. The past few years a lot of Cas’s energy and remaining sense of militaristic purpose was dedicated to his very elaborate indoor/outdoor gardening system. Dean’s knee had been bad for years, but it swelled up about twice its size after getting thrown in the woods during a hunt and proceeded to get swiftly worse. The fact that fall coincided with the end of gardening season turned about roughty 99% of Cas’s attention to him. Aside from the “definitely long term lifestyle changes you will need to make for your health,” Cas wouldn’t shut up about “gentle, limited exercise” and a diet regimen to “promote joint suppleness” because his knees were “basically arthritic already, do you want a total knee replacement surgery in five years? Dean, are you listening?”
Dean still liked to hear it out loud though.
“We’re not going to prom. I’m not gonna give him my letterman jacket. Boyfriend is for teenagers or people who are considering other options. Cas and I are very old and basically married.”
That had been somewhat standard, though, in Dean’s post-semi-retirement life. New hunters that came to them usually very much lacked basic hand-to-hand or emergency triage skills. And when they were new to the concept of semi-retirement, even when Dean was still hunting full time but thinking about slowing down, Dean used to flip out over it.
thank you for reading.
So the only thing Dean said was, “Actually on Friday nights we watch the new Dr. Sexy reboot,” and let them laugh some more.
“Dude, Mimi told us look out for you so you don't fuck up your knee again.”
a back support belt underneath his coveralls. He didn’t need to look old and feel old all at the same time he was turning fifty. Besides his knee was still sensitive enough that extra changing in and out of shoes and pants a bunch of times drained him.
The boring part was the icing on his birthday cake.
“But you won’t put a ring on it,” she said and that made him startle for a second. “Or is it Cas?  Because until he does, you’re still boyfriends.”
Once they were clean-clean, Dean wrapped a towel around his waist. He pecked Cas on the cheek and realized this was his narrow window of opportunity.
But today, he was thinking a lot of Thoughts. Kinda weird Elisa brought up getting hitched. On today of all days. He
So Dean felt bad for leaving early, but not so bad he was ready to rush his 50th birthday date night dinner.
Dean halted his own eyeroll despite the fact that Cas wasn't there to see and be bitchy about it. Dean had expected a more involved level of fussing--
Elisa frowned without looking up from her phone. “It’s three in the afternoon.”
Cas only looked at him in the mirror but the grumpy set to his eyes and jaw relaxed, and said without hesitation, “I love you too, Dean.”
Gross
Cas leaned against Dean a little more, tipping his head back. Dean couldn’t help kissing that little exposed dip in his clavicle. “A reservation at Hanneman’s isn’t exactly the hardest to procure.”
Dean couldn’t help it. He wolf-whistled. He loved that move. “Come on, hot stuff!” Dean cheered.
they were half as profound and romantic and enduring as anything he and his goddamn
Mimi ignored his question. “Don’t you go to Hanneman’s?”
Dean nodded. “I think I’m still getting enough knee sympathy to swing breakfast in bed tomorrow too, if I play my cards right.”
Seeing him at work, well, it just made Dean feel all fluttery inside.
Cas didn’t hesitate to crawl on top of him, setting most of his weight down on Dean’s hips but careful not to knock Dean’s knee with his foot. “What for?”
Cas’s hand followed the line of Dean’s half unzipped, motor oil smeared coveralls to the open collar and smiled a rare beatifically untroubled smile. “You smell terrible.”
It was advice, barely generalized, for the group in front of him, but clearly referencing something specific in Cas’s mind. Didn’t couldn’t really guess the particular thing from the past plaguing Cas-- they’d had more than their fair share of moments hurting each other because of their fears, trying to judge what was best without
Dean frowned. He had not brought up date night plans specifically to Luís or RJ. He had probably mentioned it at some point to Mimi or Jake during the week. But the truth was he didn’t really need to say anything,  because Dean did the same thing every year on his birthday.
Dean slipped back into their room and got Cas’s gift out of the hiding place in the side pocket of Dean’s dust-gathering go bag underneath the bed.
“Eternally hopeful.” Dean didn’t really have a lot of time before Cas was finished with a quick shave, but anyway he smiled at Cas lathering up. “Love you, Cas.”
