“The Roberts’s old place you said right? That’s on my property. My partner and I bought the piece of land just last year.” At the mention of her partner, Beth could feel the disgust rising in the Sheriff, but he didn’t say anything.
Reed gives Cas the first half of the healing spell. All the while, Beth schemes ways to put these pining lovebirds out of their misery.
Beth rolled her eyes. “Are we going to stand here all day or are we gonna look for your missing kid?”
“One witch. Which, for the record, would never hurt anyone. Both because of morals, and because it would hurt me in turn.”
“Yep. Though we really can’t do much with it due to the fact that it’s haunted.” Beth smiled a bit as she felt the twin spikes of recognition and curiosity from the FBI agents. On the outside however, they suppressed any visible reaction.
“I haven’t been out to check it in a while.” Beth said. “But I can show you two where it’s at and give you the tour.” The pair exchanged a look, and only Beth could feel the magnitude of emotion that was passed back and forth. The shorter one was very anxious, she noticed.
Lucky for the Winchesters, this particular case wasn’t too far from their home at the bunker. So they headed straight back to inform their only friends of the situation, and hopefully convince them to join in the next day.
“Yeah, but I know the area well enough.” Beth led the way back to the front porch before continuing. “Why don’t you come back tomorrow and I’ll show you around. We can look for the missing kid. Just meet me here at nine o’clock tomorrow morning.”
“Maybe a couple of friends? The more eyes the better. And we might have to fight off some of those nasties, so bring some weapons for those friends as well.”
“Alrighty then. Well, some time ago a couple of old folks lived here. They didn’t have any kids and they moved here to live out the rest of their days in peace. Then one day the man went crazy and killed his wife and himself. They were both found dead in the backyard. But since this place is so out of the way, they weren’t found for a while. By the time they were discovered, the foxes and coyotes had messed them up pretty bad. With no bodies to burn, there really isn’t much we can do about the spirits. We do know that they’re tied to the house, so we decided to let it decay into nothing over time. Wasn’t like we were using it.”
“Sheriff, all I’m asking is that you talk to these teenage boys and warn them not to go anywhere near my fence again.”
Meanwhile, Beth went back to her little cottage. Her partner was treated to quite the story that night. After they had gotten all the details of the situation, Reed told Beth that they would be off in the furthest corner of the property the next day, so she would be on her own.
That humor became more evident as she unlocked her car. Dean’s amusement bubbled up even further, and she could tell he was holding back laughter.
“Hmm.” Beth stared off into space for a moment. “Then I suppose I should tell you a bit about this particular haunted house, along with what makes these woods so special.”
“Alright. We can do that.” The tall one said as they stood up. “Sheriff, do you have any files on the missing child?”
And so the missing kid would have to wait one more day to be rescued. Beth reasoned that he would probably survive the night. Hopefully.
“Back at the Sheriff’s office I mentioned I had a partner. That’s ‘we’. As for why he lost his marbles, the only theory we have is some sort of poison or hallucinogen in the water. These woods have a lot of weird magic stuff in them after all. Reed, my partner, is a bit of a witch. They like studying the strange plants and animals that live here.”
He spent his next day off in the library, in the warm quiet of his favorite setion. It was empty today. He sat with his back up against the metal shelves and read until his eyes began to droop. Hours later, he returned home feeling lighter and stopped into Marjorie’s office to say hello before heading to dinner.
“You needed a vessel when you left Heaven. It wasn’t possible for you to come here in your true form. Jimmy agreed to be that vessel for you.”
“And what, that’s supposed to move me?” She wiped her face with the back of her hand. “At least you and I have another thing in common now.”
He lifted the sheet and got underneath, almost moaning when his weight sunk into the mattress. It was a hundred times more comfortable than his bed at the shelter, and long enough that he could stretch to his full height and his feet didn’t hang off the end. Warm and full from dinner, it wasn’t a minute until he was asleep.
After prayer group, Castiel agreed to a round of cards with Ty. It turned out that he was good at card games. He had what Ty called a poker face. But as they played, he was distracted by the fact that if Dean had come here to find him, Castiel had no excuse to avoid going with him.
Dean leans on the stone table. “Wish we’d brought some beers. What do you think, should we hang out? See if anything happens?”
He examined his hands. He had never seen those hands before, nor the suit he was wearing, nor the beige coat. He didn’t know how to fasten the tie at his neck.
Cas lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s alright,” he says, and from his tone, Dean believes that he means it. “You can put the gun away.”
Jacob taps the keys, advancing the photos one second apart. Dean sees a whole lot of nothing, but Cas steps up next to Sam and adapts his same posture, squinting at the screen. Jacob completes the sequence.
They sat across from one another at a diner table against a wall. Castiel stared at the menu. Dean fiddled with a salt shaker and alternated between smiling at Castiel and turning to look out the window at the parking lot.
“Yeah. It’s not official. Kinda hard when you’re...” He motioned at Castiel. “And I’ve been on the most wanted list, so we didn’t apply for a license or anything.”
Dean shook off his hand. “Maybe we need to accept reality. After all, we had no idea what was gonna happen when you…” He cleared his throat and looked at the mattress between them. “You made it back to us. That’s what matters.”
He took the photograph to his room and sat with it for a long time, thinking. It had been taken by someone else, but he didn’t think that person was Sam. Sam had never been with them on the beach. He had never been in any of the nightmares.
There was pain and then there was nothing, just a void, just a perfect empty space. In the void, there were no sensations. No wind, no light, no scent, no sound. Just being. He had no shape or form or weight. He existed, and that was enough.
“The first time you had your grace removed by someone else, you became human, but you still knew who you were. This last time, you vanished and ended up like Anna. So I don’t think it’s caused by removing grace but by
“I think you’re right,” Dean says to him. “I don’t think that thing wants to hurt us. I promise if anything happens, I’ll get right out. Okay?”
“Sammy thinks he’s the paparazzi,” Dean explained, tucking the phone away. He grinned at Castiel a beat too long.
“Do you have editing software on that computer?” Jacob says, stealing a jerky stick from the plastic bag.
It’s a rough, unfinished space lined with newspaper cutouts linked by string and push pins like a spiderweb. It hits a little too close to home for comfort, too much like something his old man would’ve dedicated a room to if they hadn’t always been on the road. Dean can practically feel his skin crawl looking at it but descends the full length of the staircase.
She nodded and turned to look out the window. “Another car just pulled up. I can handle things in here. Why don’t you help them unload?”
It had been the wrong thing to say. The stress was noticeable around Dean’s eyes, the way he held them wide, the way the skin pinched on his forehead.
His face is dripping with sweat. He takes off his jacket and backs down the dark corridor. They can’t get out without moving closer to the thing, which means they can’t get out of here with it between them and the exit. If they can get it to follow them to the altar room, get it inside, there might be enough room to get around it and run. But it can speak. It understands their language. Maybe they can reason with it. He clears his throat.
when he didn’t know his own name. They told him it was Jimmy. James Novak was the name on his driver’s license, the name the officer had called him. Jimmy was the name written in black marker on the strip of masking tape on the bed, but that name felt no more like his than these borrowed clothes, the bland walls, the mattress that did not belong to him.
“Well, if it is ghosts, we know how to handle them,” Sam assures him with a touch on his shoulder. “Let’s get a good night’s sleep. We can head over after we all wake up.”
The change was instant, like gates falling. Moments ago, he’d been filled with tenderness at the sight of Dean’s face; he looked at him now and felt nothing. He felt nothing, only the cool metal of the blade. Plunged into Dean’s chest, it grew warm.
“Do you have any idea how the things you do could be interpreted by other people?” she hissed. “Learn some self awareness.” She aimed a thumb at Castiel. “Besides, I’ve got plenty, thanks to him.”
“Honeymoon rules?” Dean said, turning over onto his back. His eyes were endearingly swollen from sleep. Castiel’s heart felt full.
Dean sighs. “All I’m saying is that the equipment drain could be due to bad batteries. It’s not like he ran tests.”
“The program is streamed digitally on the internet instead of through radio waves,” says a gruff voice from the backseat. Cas sits up in a rumple of clothes and rubs his eyes.
Dean hadn’t expected that. Castiel caught a wave of his surprise as Dean stepped closer, as he slid the ring onto Castiel’s fourth finger. The surprise turned to pleasure. Dean was happy.
“I don’t understand,” Sam says. “If this hill has only been here for a decade, how is it already this obscured? I could understand if we were in a rainforest, maybe, where you can have growth year-round, but this is something else.”
The thing above him isn’t human. At first Dean isn’t even sure it’s a living thing: black like the remains of a fire, no eyes, no recognizable features—just the shape of a head and shoulders leaning over, as though something knelt down beside the hole in the ground and looked in out of curiosity. But it has to be living, or at least mobile. Nothing was there a few minutes ago. The body interrupts the moonlight: solid, not a spirit or a shadow. Not a demon. Despite its startling appearance, it doesn’t feel menacing, more like the presence of a small child.
He had been at the shelter for sixteen weeks when the girl came. She was a young girl, only just slipped into adulthood. He noticed her standing in the food line, a few places in front of him, tapping her fingers against the underside of the tray.
Overseeing the thrift store was quiet and repetitive work. It suited him. Cas was content to stand behind the counter and sell donated items to the public: clothing, furniture, and jewelry. He totaled orders and gave people correct change, and smiled at them before they left.
Dean was brushing his fingers through Castiel’s hair, looking at him hopefully. Though it hurt because he knew it would hurt Dean, Castiel shook his head.
The police had come and moved him to a squad car. They settled him in the back seat in a blanket and asked him questions. His legs stuck out the door; his feet were flat against the pavement. The words from his mouth had been, “I don’t know. I can’t remember.”
He sounds sincere, and while Dean can believe Sam and Jacob talked Cas into playing along with their prank, it’s harder to believe he’s mastered the art of bullshit in the last forty-five minutes. Sighing, Dean becomes the third person behind Jacob’s chair.
“Hey, do you think my brother and that guy…” Dean starts to say, then thinks better of it. He’ll need some bleach to scrub those thoughts out of his head tomorrow. “You know what, I don’t want to know.”
They waited in the room while she changed in the adjoining bathroom, coming back out in black shorts and a long-sleeved shirt with an outrageous magenta flower print. She pushed aside clothing strewn across the bed and took a sip from an open can of Coke on the nightstand.
His face felt hot when he came upon a painting of an angel. The sting along his cheekbones made him angry, made his vision go soft. The images began to resemble one another. He flipped the pages with conviction only to have a frustrated sound rip from his throat.
“God, was it three years ago?” Dean laughed. His face was flushed. He tightened his arms around Castiel’s neck. “I can’t remember. Guess that makes us even.”
“No thanks. I think twice is my limit. You seem awfully quiet back there, Castiel. Everything okay?”
Sam’s phone chimes. “Jacob’s in the basement recording. The front door is unlocked. He’s in the middle of an interview but says to make ourselves at home.”
The work gave him pride. There was dignity behind a cash register, and when he clocked out at the end of the day, his clothes weren’t covered in grease. His case worker said that he seemed open to meaningful change and that if he continued on this path, he would become self-sustaining, ready to look for permanent work and housing.
He clicked the pen closed and hooked it through the notebook’s spiral binding. It had cost ninety-nine cents, and had narrow blue lines and a green cover. The green had stood out to him. That’s why he’d bought this particular one. He thought in green a lot.
“I feel good. I don’t know how to describe it. I haven’t felt this good since...well, since I can remember.”
There weren’t any magazines today. Sometimes Marjorie left one for him. They were always well thumbed through, often dogeared or torn along the edges—a consequence, he’d learned, of impatience. He’d cut his finger on a page when he’d turned them too quickly, felt it slice his skin open. Though the wound itself wasn’t visible, he could feel it. It stung for a day, especially when it was wet. Marjorie had called it a paper cut and put a drop of glue on it. It burned for a beat, and then he couldn’t feel it anymore.
Dean pulled one up on his phone and passed it to Castiel. “Don’t know what his hair was doing in that one,” he said gruffly, but his tone was affectionate.
They ate at a restaurant called Cracker Barrel. Castiel was disappointed to learn there was not a barrel of crackers anywhere in the restaurant, but the meatloaf had made up for it. He was still chasing the flavor of fried apples and sweet tea, and trying to figure out the triangular wooden game on the table, with colorful wooden pegs that Dean told him were golf tees. He didn’t know what that meant but memorized the term. After dinner, Dean ordered a slice of cherry pie and ate it with a rapturous smile. Castiel couldn’t take his eyes off of it or the way the cherries stained his lips red.
He drank three before dinner was over and trailed behind Sam and Castiel with a fourth in his hand as Sam walked them through every room of the bunker. Every time he opened a door, Castiel hoped there might be something beyond it that he could latch onto, but as the doors they opened multiplied in number and nothing happened, his mood fell.
They walked around the zoo until closing time. Dean insisted on buying him dinner before going back to the shelter. When they got there, he idled the car in the street outside and put his hands in his lap. The car still smelled like grease from the burgers. Castiel was wonderfully full.
Dean’s face was pale. He hadn’t opened his eyes, but Castiel could feel life emanating from him. It grew stronger the more grace he transferred. Was there a chance of transferring too much? He didn’t care. He kept his hands on Dean’s face.
She scowled and pinned the price to the sheets, then turned to him. “God has given each of us free will. If you don’t like the man you are, He has given you the freedom to change that.” She patted his arm. “I wouldn’t worry too much about it. You don’t have an evil bone in you.”
“I’m going to be sick,” Castiel said and crawled to a strip of weeds next to the door. Dean rubbed his back, his face haunted when Castiel sat up and wiped his mouth.
She walked past his table, her jacket brushing his elbow, and he knew he wouldn’t see her again. But she stopped. Her back stiffened and she turned her head, staring down at him.
Jacob nods, then looks around them again and shivers. “You know, Joseph used to poke fun at me for chasing ghosts. Never thought I’d be looking for his.”
Castiel didn’t answer him. In truth, he wasn’t sure how to answer. He was ecstatic. He was sick that he’d hurt someone else for his own benefit.
He could hardly eat more than a few bites of oatmeal at breakfast. He knew his body required food and ate for that purpose alone. It sat heavy in his gut.
“Extraction needle for angelic grace,” Castiel read, thumbing through the yellowed documents. Opening the box, he found an intimidating syringe and swallowed hard. “I would have to use this?”
Sam opened his mouth but didn’t say anything for a couple of seconds. “Sort of. Your grace—I guess it’s like the angel equivalent of a soul?—was taken from you. We weren’t able to get it back. You ended up borrowing grace from another angel, but it was diminishing, so you chose to remove it.”
It’s pitch black on the road and there hasn’t been a house for miles. Dean’s about to double back to that gas station they passed maybe fifteen minutes back when Sam taps his shoulder. At this point they’ve been driving for seven hours straight, and if Sam is about to ask Dean to change the radio station for the third time in an hour, he really might pull the car over. At least Cas had the decency to pass out in the back seat once the sun went down.
“No,” Dean said with a weak laugh, pulling up another picture. “Though she’ll be amused as hell you said that. Here’s one of you and me.”
Dean thrust a hand in his pocket and took out a couple items that he slid across the table: a silver ring, a small black wallet containing what appeared to be federal identification. The ring Castiel could explain. It belonged to the person whose face was in his wallet. The police officer said his late wife had been called Amelia. The identification, though...Castiel turned it over on his palm.
Dean had said he’d gotten a motel room nearby. If they’d be leaving here together, he probably wouldn’t mind if Castiel slept there too, even if it was on the floor. It would be best to let his bed go to someone who needed it, now that he had another waiting for him.
It was the two of them glaring at the photographer over coffee. Castiel’s hair was mussed from sleep; Dean’s eyes were puffy. They sat at a wooden table in a kitchen Castiel had never seen.
Dean splashes his face with cold water to chase the flush. A few minutes later, when he’s wearing jeans he hasn’t been sitting in for two days straight, he rejoins the others at the table. Mug in hand, he absentmindedly sets a hand on Cas’s knee in the way he’s become accustomed. After all, they’ve been having breakfast that way for years. The familiar slide of the cheap suit fabric against his fingertips makes his chest ache. How long’s it been since they did this? He pulls his hand back so quickly he bumps the underside of the table. The mugs rattle and coffee drips over the side of Jacob’s mug.
“They could be hidden,” Jacob says from the corridor. “It wouldn’t be uncommon to find a chamber in the floor.”
The identification inside the wallet he carried confirmed what the officer had said: his name was James Novak. But he was not James Novak. His blank mind rejected the idea.
Sam was out of bed with the sun, tinkering with the in-room coffee maker. Dean glared until Sam put a mug in his hands and then reluctantly followed Castiel out of bed.
“He’s from out of town.” He began to check the condition of the cookware. “Mary, may I ask your advice?”
There was no need to rush. He sunk the needle in one inch and pulled back on the plunger with just enough force to begin the flow. Clear liquid streamed into the vial. He squinted, pushing the needle in further.
The terrible two have finished their Instagram session and catch up with them outside of an ice cream parlor. Dean’s sitting on a bench going at a waffle cone. Cas is sampling a piece of fudge with a ponderous look on his face.
sees something where there’s nothing. This is the guy who thinks aliens ditched a droid on the moon.
“We understand this place was really important to you,” Sam continues. “I’m friends with your colleague Jacob Glaser. It’d mean a lot from him if he could hear from you. If you’d like, you can speak into this device next to me. It’ll be able to record your voice.”
Castiel sat alone in the back seat, letting the window hold him up. Dean spoke to Sam during the ride. He turned his head occasionally, glancing back at Castiel, but didn’t speak to him. Dean was angry. He could sense it, and it made him feel worse than the lack of grace.
"So since it's new year's eve, I was wondering if you and your friends wanted to come to a party here in Kansas City. Our flight back to LA was canceled."
Dean allowed himself to lean on Cas and Ellen a little as they went to the medical cabin. Once inside, they sat Dean down and Ellen got to work, shining a flashlight in his eyes. “Head hurt?”
"Hey Rookie!" Dean caught the five year old boy as he leaped. He scooped the boy up and put him on his hip.
"Your brother was injured. Badly. His platoon was on a mission to help another unit that had been pinned down by the Germans. They threw a grenade and it landed feet away from most of his unit. Dean jumped on top of the grenade and saved everyone." Cas went numb. Sam leaned against the door for support. Jess started crying. "Is he...is he dead?" Sam asked.
It didn't get any easier for him at recess. He pushed the door open and stepped outside. His eyes found the swings. Their swings. He was about to go back in and just draw until lunch when he heard a kid named Adam say Cas' name. He stopped and turned around. "Did you hear that weird Castiel kid finally moved?" He asked his friends. They laughed. "He was really weird and always following Winchester like a lost puppy. If I was Winchester, I would have just beat him up." Adam continued. Dean walked over to him. "What did you just say?" Anger in his voice. "Just telling the truth Winchester, that Novak kid was weird."
The crowd started chanting. Cas was absolutely blown away. "I think someone just stole the show!" Josh put his arm around Cas. "Whatcha say boys. Think you got one more in ya? I'd like an encore myself!"Adam and the guys gave a thumbs up and took their places. "What ya thinking, boss?" Adam yelled to Cas." Fuck it! Let's do it!" The crowd roared in approval. Cas grabbed the mic and put it back on the original stand. He pushed his guitar behind him. "This Song doesn't involve an orchestra." He smiled. He took a drink of water then threw it into the crowd. "You might need that more than me in a second. This Song is called Desperate Measures." The band cued up and Cas got the crowd going. Soon they were clapping along to the beat.
Dean set his sight on Adam, who had no idea Dean was free. Dean pulled him off Cas and on to the sand.
"Not today apparently. At least, not right now." Cas took a calming breath and opened the door. "Ladies."
"Dude! This is gonna be epic!"Cas walked back to their room. "Alright, Charlie is our director. Meg, you're gonna use the other camera. Band peeps get your stuff to the stage downstairs and get ready. Dean, you're helping Meg." Cas looked at everyone. "This is the shit."Cas walked out to the balcony. "Hey! You fuckers wanna be in a music video?!" The fans below cheered. "Yeah, that's what I thought." Josh walked out. "Holy shit! There's like three hundred people out there!" He put his arm around Cas. "Taking to it like a duck to water ain't he?!" The fans yelled. Cas turned to Charlie. "Ready?" She gave him the thumbs up.
He slowly removed his fingers and touched the tip of his dick to Cas' hole. He slowly pushed the tip inside and pulled out seconds later. He repeated this action a few times, watching as Cas dug his nails into the carpet and muscles tense then relax.  "Dean..." Cas opened his eyes and looked at him. They only light in the room was coming from under the door. Dean could see every inch of Cas, how the light played off his smooth skin. He ran his fingers slowly up Cas' chest then down his arm, pushing himself slowly inside Cas until he was all the way in. He grabbed Cas' hand and pinned them above his head. Dean rolled his hips, searching for the cluster of nerves so he could send Cas to the moon. Cas snapped his head back in a moan and gripped Dean's hands.
Okay, maybe not a good time for sarcasm. "Don't push me boy!" Mark took a step forward. In probably the dumbest act he's ever done, Cas reached for the gun. Grabbing Mark's wrist, twisting it and pulling his arm down.
Cas stood up and went to grab his plate. Dean grabbed his hand and stood. "No. I'm not gonna just drop it. Tell me Cas. Just please­"
"I know, I know! I was just worried and scared and I just...yelled. God, the look on his face. And how he said I've never yelled at him before. Now he's gone and I have no clue where he's going. I don't know what to do Charlie."
The guy thought for a moment. "Yeah, we do. There's one that we wrote awhile back but we got too nervous to play."
Charlie licked her lips and watched him. Her face fell a little. “I forgot that you didn’t know what happened.”
Dean swallowed hard. “Hey, Anna… it’s Dean… Yeah, it’s been a long time. Listen I was wondering if you… if you were free tonight?.....Awesome, yeah, uh, the old spot?... Sounds great. Be there soon.” He hung up and put the phone down on the bed, hesitating for a minute before springing to life and changing his clothes, not that what he was wearing really mattered because in about an hour they’d be on the floor of a cheap hotel room. He walked quietly out to the Impala and drove off.
The grace filled only a tenth of the vial. Was it enough? Sam didn’t seem to think so. He didn’t tell Castiel to stop, just fed Claire encouragement while glancing at the vial every few seconds. The plunger was halfway out, but particles of grace kept flowing into the vial, filling it to a quarter of its volume.
There was downtime before lunch, after the kitchen was clean. It was too windy to spend time outside, so he went to the office.
“Am I a federal agent?” he asked, studying the wallet. The badge inside bore his photograph. It gave his surname as Stills. Baffled, he looked to Dean, who snorted and shook his head.
He opened his eyes in a forest, thick with fog and screams. The air was damp and moldy, not hot or cold—stale, like stagnant water. Fetid. Rotting.
“Hello, sunshine,” she said, looking up at him. Her face pulled into a frown. “Did you get any sleep last night?”
“Look, Cas,” Dean said. “I won’t beat around the bush. I want you to come home, but I know I can’t force you. I got a room here in town for a few days. If it’s okay with you, I’ll swing by tomorrow. Maybe we can talk more.”
The ice cream melted on his tongue. Strawberry. Castiel swallowed it quickly and refused the next offer.
“James, I used to run this shop single-handedly,” Mary said, which was her way of letting him know it was fine if he stepped out. He thanked her and removed his name tag.
Blood spilled from Dean’s lip, the color of the rose he wore. Castiel did not want to strike him again, but he raised his fist. It trembled in his peripheral vision.
“Or he went crazy like the old man and ran off into the woods. Either way, we’ll need to search them.”
“Sammy and me were in Iowa when Claire called, otherwise I woulda come sooner. I dropped him off and drove straight, through,” Dean said after they’d placed their order. He sniffed and wiped his nose. “How long have you been here?”
She sat two tables away with her back toward him. When people approached her and ostensibly asked to sit, she nodded but didn’t engage in conversation. She ate quickly—he wondered if she even chewed—then stood to return her tray.
When he finally fell asleep close to dawn, he dreamed of Dean licking ice cream from his wrist in a dark motel room. Red neon light came slanting through the crooked blinds. He let the ice cream drip onto Castiel’s chest and cleaned it away with his tongue, causing Castiel to arch up from the bed. Dean got a hand between his legs and Castiel moaned.
He shook his head. Like the first page of a notebook, he sat empty in the back of a squad car on the way to the station.
In his half-awake state, Dean accepts what Cas has said and sits up, putting his feet on the floor. The wood is chilly.
He had fallen asleep to this scent before; he had been wrapped up in it. He knew it, mixed with his own scent or left on a pillowcase. There might not be memories to go along with it yet, but he basked in something familiar.
Dean cleared his throat. “Claire, I just want you to know that if you decide to do this, it’ll mean a hell of a lot to me.”
“I’m fine,” he said, fingers shifting to disconnect the bag. “I think the line needs to be cleaned.”
“What was that about earlier?” Dean said. He lay on top of the covers in a t-shirt and shorts, his head propped on an arm.
His heart started to race. He took a breath and tried to calm himself. Nothing was going to happen. There was no knife in this room. Castiel had never even seen a blade like the one he always used: gleaming silver, elongated like a letter opener. Without that weapon, Dean could probably fight back if Castiel attacked him. He went on sleeping, ignorant that the person beside him fantasized about him, about taking his life.
“This doesn’t look weird at all,” Dean said, eyeing the end of the hallway. Castiel surmised he was looking for a security camera. “Three guys, going into the room of a...how old are you again?”
Sam drops new batteries into his hand and puts the dead ones into a Ziplock bag he whips out of nowhere. They move further, coming to the end of the corridor and another opening to their left, and discover a room partially blocked by a large stone door. The top of the doorway is rounded like the pyramid’s opening, and the door itself has come off of whatever mechanism held it in place. Someone has moved it aside enough to create a space wide enough to squeeze into the next room.
Dean’s thoughts fade to background static. By the time he starts thinking again, their clothes are open and Cas is lying on his back on the front seat gazing up at him. Dean, chest heaving, rests his forehead on Cas’s sternum. What were they doing before this? It was still light when they left the coast, then Dean stopped off for snacks and beer, and Jacob made dinner. Somehow they ended up in the Impala. He feels like he’s missing a couple of hours, memory hazy and evasive like a fading dream, but after a few more seconds his concern scatters and he doesn’t think about it anymore. Cas lays a hand on his hair. It’s quiet in the car. Outside, the trees rustle in the wind. He hears an owl, the skitter of something in the brush. Cas’s heartbeat.
An hour and some minutes later, when they said goodnight in the hallway, Dean put on the same smile he had worn that first day in Bloomington.
Realizing he’d failed, he sighed, his shoulders rounding slightly. But that movement shifted the position of his arm a few millimeters, and something ice blue and luminescent flowed into the vial.
“Why? I don’t know, Cas. Maybe that line about letting me have some space. Figured that meant we wouldn’t be seeing you for a while. I know you’re not human, but that’s how breakups usually work.”
When Castiel went inside, Eric was up to his elbows in hot water, scrubbing a serving tray. He snorted when he saw him.
“I thought you might allow it today,” Castiel said. They were no longer in a coffin. They were in a bright room with old-fashioned furniture, and it was morning. The ocean rolled in the distance.
That night, he stayed up after his bunkmates had gone to sleep and read in the bathroom. He liked to shower late, and it didn’t bother anyone if he kept the bathroom light on. The book was a good distraction. He read fifty pages before he started yawning. He laid it on top of his clothes while he showered and then next to his bed when he turned in for the night, positioned beside the notebook. He traced a lazy finger over the author’s name: Nora. He frowned at the mental image of a rose and a baby, too vivid to be a passing fantasy, but nothing from the book he’d just read. He opened the notebook and made a new entry.
He had been ordered here, and an army had followed. Castiel was to liberate the Righteous Man from Hell. That purpose drove him forward, in spite of the heat and the pain, the loss of the angels who had set out with him.
“Shu, the one who came before us. We are not meant to be together. The world cannot exist without the air between us, yet it is unbearable to look down upon my beloved with every sunrise and be forbidden to touch. They will never allow it, and we have never dared to meet, not until this place rose again.”
Castiel stood before an altar. He stood facing Dean inside a church with red doors. Dean wore a suit Castiel had seen him wear dozens of times before, but he looked different from the everyday. On the suit was pinned a single rose, and on his face was a smile lovelier than Castiel had ever seen. Dean was holding both of his hands, and when the pastor asked if he would pledge himself to Castiel for life, Dean slid a ring onto Castiel’s finger and replied, “I will.”
“I could eat,” Dean said. “That diner down the road is open twenty-four hours. If we start walking, we might catch Sam and Claire.”
But as soon as he tried to recall the day before that, he faced a blank wall. He searched for something he knew he would never forget: the first time he’d met Dean. It wasn’t there. The only details he knew were from a nightmare.
The notion terrified him. Life in the shelter was simple and the world outside unknown to him. Here, he was Jimmy—a good worker, an honest person. But out there, he was Cas.
She stood for a moment watching him. He could see her thinking. She looked to the door, then sighed and fell in across from him at the table.
Sam turns around to talk with him. “Have you ever heard of warding that makes you forget a place once you leave there?”
“I got this,” he said. Something in those words triggered a memory; he could see a riddle written on a door—something about numbers—and then nothing. He froze, thinking it might come back if he held still, but it didn’t.
If Castiel and Dean had really taken that trip, what other pieces of the dreams were true? Dean had shown him a ring in the diner in Bloomington. Castiel had assumed that it belonged to Jimmy, but looking back, why would Dean have shown him someone else’s possession? The ring must have belonged to him. For Dean to be the one carrying it, for Dean to be the one to bring him home, did that mean he...
“See, we gotta fix that. From now on if there’s something you want, you gotta speak up. And, yeah, I know that goes for me too. I’ll do better, okay? You’ve gotta cut me a little slack, though. I’ve never done this before.” Dean swallows and shifts closer. “What if I book a room for tomorrow night?”
Dean winces a few stairs behind him, prepared for a dose of Cas’s blunt honesty. He forgot all about the lie he cooked up when they met Jacob, but luckily all Cas says is, “Fine. And how are you, Jacob?”
“Oh,” Castiel said, surprised that Dean was offering. “As long as it wouldn’t make you uncomfortable.”
“Will you take this man,” the pastor was saying, “in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, when your love is easy and when it is difficult...”
Dean wakes fully, reddening as the words leave his mouth, but he doesn’t take them back, glad for the dark room and camouflaging blue cast from the TV screen. He shuffles to the mattress and hides under the blanket. Through his eyelids, he continues to see changes in the light and hears the occasional rustle of clothes as Cas adjusts his position or changes the channel. Finally there’s a click and the light dims. He holds his breath but no one crawls onto the mattress with him.
Castiel put his hand on top of Dean’s, circling a thumb over the slick head of Dean’s cock. Dean kissed him hard in return and begged, “Fuck. Cas, please, baby—” until Cas did it again, nudging Dean’s fingers away.
“What happened to me?” Castiel asked, meeting Dean’s eyes, green like the early oceans that drowned him sometimes in his sleep.
It was such a long time before Dean said anything, Castiel thought he must have fallen back asleep. But a few moments later, there was a rustling. Dean’s weight caused the center of the bed to dip. His hand came to rest between Castiel’s shoulder blades.
“Sand,” he explained, so Castiel removed his as well. When he straightened, Dean grasped both of his shoulders with shaking hands and kissed him, then took Castiel’s arm and led him up a staircase. It creaked underfoot. Dean closed the bedroom door behind him and unbuttoned his shirt, dropping it on the floor.
Dean bled onto the shower floor, swaying on his knees and begging, “Cas, please—” before the blade rendered him silent.
Dean gave him a funny look then, a sort of wistful smile. He patted Castiel’s arm. “That’s a promise.”
Sam gives him a soppy grin that makes Dean just the slightest bit twitchy. “If it is his spirit, this will give you a chance to say goodbye. Properly.” He pats Jacob’s arm, then gets up to clear away the empty dishes.
Dean licked his lips. “Maybe, uh…” He leaned forward an inch, and when Castiel didn’t retreat, he leaned closer until their mouths were touching. Castiel opened his mouth and let Dean inside.
“I want you to know, you don’t have to do this,” he said. “If you’re happy with the way you are, then you should stay that way. There’s a lot of stuff you’re probably better off not remembering.”
Something tightened in Castiel’s chest. He clutched at it uselessly. “I—I’m sorry.” He swallowed, at a loss for words. “I know saying that doesn’t change anything.”
A smile teases the corner of Cas’s lips. Dean drops a hand back onto his leg and finishes his coffee.
“Human brains, Cas. They can convince you of all sorts of crap.” Dean lets out a nervous laugh and loosens his grip on Cas’s hand, repositioning it so he’s loosely holding onto Cas’s fingers instead. “The guy at the jewelry store today was talking about getting married.”
“This would be a place to settle down, huh?” Sam says. The alcohol has worn off and he’s back to his regular brand of chipper. “I can see myself running along here every morning.”
“I liked searching for ghosts when it wasn’t someone I knew, but the thought of running into him again is pretty freaky. Joseph and his followers were searching for a room called the Chamber of the Sun. I don’t know if they reached it. I think it’s possible some of his followers might’ve chosen to stay behind, if you get my drift. There’s never been a report of bodies, but if they managed to find a room and seal themselves in...”
He glanced around the thrift shop to be sure there were no customers nearby and spoke in a low voice.
“Sorry, did I wake you?” Sam whispered, setting down a bag. He didn’t turn on the light but switched on the one in the bathroom. “I got caught up listening to a podcast.”
Castiel woke with a sob and rocked back and forth on the bed as he tried to catch his breath, but Dean was dead. Castiel had killed him. He’d loved him and
“Who am I?” he typed, plucking out one letter at a time. The results were unhelpful: a personality test, a German film. He placed the cursor back in the search field.
Dean does. The two figures get so close to the camera, he is able to make out faces. The first has eyes so bright he’s shocked. They seem to emit light, but the glow doesn’t illuminate their skin or hair. The second figure’s eyes are black but ringed with a faint glow like a smoldering fire.
With a sigh, he pushed back from the counter and paced the length of the kitchen, then went outside. He wished that he were not alone. His thoughts were too loud when it was quiet. He needed to drown them, to quiet them, if only for a few hours.
Sam located a Hampton Inn not too far away and booked two rooms. The hotel was nicer than the one they’d stayed at in Bloomington. Claire bought a bathing suit and went to soak in the hot tub. Sam took a book and went to the lobby for coffee, leaving Dean and Castiel alone in the double he’d reserved for the three of them. Dean took the tin box out of his bag and laid it open on the bed.
“You two talk about restaurants?” Dean says from the backseat of the truck, not where he wants to be sitting but it’s where he and Cas ended up.
The grass around the hill has grown up thigh-high in places. Tick heaven. They’ll have to check for hitchhikers later. Dean tries to walk in the places Sam already crushed. Cas stays on his heels, navigating the field in dress shoes.
“It’s not just my dad. My mom’s gone too. My parents lost their lives because my dad believed in you. He was so proud of being chosen. He raised me to be devout. But if this is what devotion gets you, I don’t want any part of it.” She was crying now, but her tone was furious. “You have no idea how much my mom and I suffered after he was gone, the things people said about him. My mom lost her mind. And now I don’t have either one of my parents. My family was ruined because of you, but you want me to help you get your memories back. Well, I’d happily switch places with you. I wish I couldn’t remember!”
When he wakes a few hours later, it’s with a stiff neck on a partially deflated air mattress. Dean squints through the screen. The sun is up, filtering down through the trees and a few leaves have settled on the Impala’s windshield. Cas is no longer beside him.
Dean would like to relax with a bottle of good Canadian whiskey, which they don’t have because they’re in middle-of-nowhere Maine. He didn’t spot a single liquor store within thirty miles of this place, but he’s not above a road trip. He puts on his best good-sport smile. “In that case, I’ll grab a shower.”
She walked with them out to the parking lot. And though she rolled her eyes at their attempts to say goodbye, she waved as they drove off.
“I’m sorry,” he said, looking up at her—a woman with cropped brown hair and her phone out, probably planning to call for help. “I’ve injured myself. Please excuse me.”
All he had been looking for was a blanket. It was cold underground. Castiel couldn’t get his feet warm, even if he kept his shoes on. He had gone into Dean’s room. He never came here, but Dean had said there were extra blankets in the closet. He should have asked Dean to get one for him, but Dean was out and Castiel hadn’t wanted to bother Sam.
“Yeah.” Smiling, Sam motions to the exit. He climbs up first and extends a hand for Jacob, helping him up. Cas follows, then Dean, who turns and stares back into the hole as he dusts off his hands.
The shopkeeper must have seen this behavior hundreds of times before, because he doesn’t miss a beat. He follows the line of Dean’s gaze and says, “You’re welcome to come in and browse.”
He was not the Castiel he had found photographs of on the internet. He was not the Castiel who had torn out his grace. He might never be. But he was Castiel. He was Dean’s, even empty.
The sight of blood on his hands had him on the ground, gasping for air as a customer leaned over the counter, calling, “Are you alright, sir? Sir?”
An hour later, Dean catches sight of the Atlantic Ocean through the windshield, a choppy deep blue. They find parking and get out to stretch their legs. The air here smells fresh and briny. He fills his lungs with it. The wind whips off of the ocean and he zips up his jacket.
He carried Dean’s soul away from Hell, away from the other Dean against the bars. He placed that soul back inside of a body rotting inside a crudely made coffin. With a hand to its shoulder, he channeled his grace, burning life back into it. This, resurrection, was taboo except in the rarest cases. Humans needed death to give them purpose and to limit their power. If they discovered immortality, Castiel believed they would destroy the world.
His heart in his throat, Dean said to the steering wheel, "I forgive you, Cas. Of course I do." He hesitated before continuing, "I'm sorry too. It wasn't - I didn't - " He stuttered to a stop, unable to articulate exactly what he was sorry for – there was so much.
Castiel pushed away from the wall without breaking the kiss, still easily stronger than Dean despite being partially human. He turned them around and suddenly Dean was the one with his back against the wall, Cas with one hand twisted in Dean’s shirt and the other on his neck.
"A school thing. A semester abroad," Dean says, waving a hand. The words sound rehearsed. “Fuck if I know, really.”
Cas shook his head. “I know. But I knew it was wrong. And you nearly died because I didn’t act on that.” He stood up suddenly. “You’ve had too much to drink.”
Castiel didn’t respond, only looked at him as if he wasn’t fully seeing him, and Dean noticed for the first time that the collar of his trenchcoat was stained with blood, and the angel looked troubled and exhausted.
Cas looked a little sad. “I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable. If you don’t want me to know how you feel, then that’s okay.” Dean blinked. Oh. Cas continued, “You were under a spell, Dean. I’m not going to hold you to what you said while you weren’t in control of yourself.”
Dean made it all the way to the car without bothering to stop and ask himself where he was planning to go. He wrenched the door open, threw himself into the driver's seat, and slammed the door behind him.
It's a joke, but also a good question - non-rhetorical, unlike most of the questions Dean asks himself - and Dean hesitates before he answers, looking away. He takes another sip of his whiskey.
He opened the door to leave, and without intending to, Dean blurted out, "No, Cas, stay." Then, heat rushing to his face, he snapped his mouth shut. "Sorry," he apologized. "You can go if you want."
“Of course,” said Cas, nodding. “Did she ever talk about anything strange – an odd experience, perhaps? Or England?”
– for a second. The shape of it in Cas’ mouth – and then the shape of Cas’ mouth. Then he snapped out of it. “No, I thought I should tell him in person,” he said casually. “I mean, I didn’t even really know I liked dudes, so it’s not like Sam’s gonna have any idea.” At least, he hoped not. “Also, I’m gonna have to freak out about that at some point, by the way.”
. I've forgiven you every single goddamn time because I don’t even care!” He sucked in a lungful of air, laughing a little now like a fucking crazy person. "Not really, not like I should, not like I want to. If it was anyone else, Cas –" He raked his hands through his hair, actually ripping out a few strands from the force, feeling like he was beginning to detach from his body. "But it’s not anyone else, because – it’s you, Cas. It’s always you. You could do anything and I'd just
. But Cas didn’t seem to be about to say anything; he was simply watching Dean with an odd expression, his head slightly tilted.
Dean had to tilt his head up to look at Cas from the bed, unintentionally baring his throat to him, but somehow he felt like he would be content to just sit there forever, watching Cas look at him like that.
Castiel didn’t know what was happening to him. Not understanding was beginning to feel like a running theme when it came to Dean Winchester. Something inside him inexplicably hurt, but he’d checked his vessel countless times over for injuries and he was unable to find the source of the hurt. It was like it was coming from somewhere inside himself. And he couldn’t stop thinking, going over the events of the past few months, the orders he was compelled to carry out, the doubts that scratched away at the walls of the box he kept them locked in. And of course – Dean Winchester, as omnipresent in his thoughts as Castiel’s mysterious phantom pain.
“Well,” Dean stalled, “we’re in Pennsylvania now, but we lost some time in traffic today, so we’re gonna head out tomorrow to the granddaughter’s house.”
For a moment they both just sat there in silence, Dean half praying that Cas wouldn’t bring it up. He had no such luck.
Things weren’t going according to plan, Dean thought. He was fucking this up. He had intended to be doing the talking here – for Cas to understand how he felt, not the reasons why he couldn’t tell him. He felt a little frantic. “I
“I know. The thing is, Cas, I looked up the spell and it’s not, like, a love spell or anything.” Dean felt his face grow warm and he surged ahead, talking faster. “It just made me – uh – unable to have inhibitions, apparently. I couldn’t stop myself from saying or…or doing anything. So I just wanted you to know, I guess, that I didn’t say anything I didn’t mean, I just didn’t, you know –
“Kitchen,” Dean informed him. He made it a couple more steps before his rubbery legs gave out and he found himself unceremoniously on the floor. Cas crouched next to him. “Here, open your mouth.”
Dean had pushed the thoughts out of his head. No, he would just…not bring it up. There was no need to talk about it. He was happy just to have Cas back – he wasn’t going to ruin it by talking about something that happened in the past.
On autopilot, he prodded his side gingerly, taking stock of the damage. He didn’t think any ribs were broken, but there was definitely going to be one hell of a bruise the next day, if it wasn’t already forming now. His leg seemed the same – difficult to walk on, but intact.
Dean reached across the table without thinking, drawn by the movement, to touch his hand, tracing the blue map of veins that showed under the thin skin on the back. He focused on the sensation of Cas’ skin under his fingertips, and when the buzzing noise in his brain had sufficiently subsided, he took a deep breath and said, “I love you.”
They left late in the morning, preparing for a much shorter drive this time – only across the city; Adelaide lived in a suburb of Philadelphia.
Dean rolled over in the bed, jamming the pillow over his head as if it could block out the rush of self-hatred.
Then they stopped and said thoughtfully, “Maybe you’ll think twice if I looked a little more like this.”
The sensation of kissing upside down was new and strange in a heady way, Dean with his face tilted up to reach Cas’ mouth and Cas with his face tilted down to meet him. His eyes closed seemingly of their own accord.
“You didn’t know that, Cas.” Dean looked at him oddly. Was he trying to apologize? Dean’s head was beginning to ache.
He had closed his eyes, wetness running down his cheeks now, when he felt the touch of a warm, dry hand; he opened his eyes to find Cas was leaning across the gap between them to place his hand over Dean’s own. He didn’t say anything, didn’t even look Dean in the eyes, which he was grateful for. Dean didn’t move for fear that Cas would move his hand or disappear, and they sat that way for some time, neither of them saying anything, until Dean’s breathing had evened out and the tears had stopped flowing. Then he struggled to a sitting position in bed, wincing at the pain in his…everywhere. Dean pretended not to notice Cas remove his hand.
“Ugh.” Dean visually searched the interior of the Impala, coming up empty. No green clothing, nothing green on the dashboard. “Dude.” His eyes lit on another vehicle. “Is it that minivan? It’d better not be, that’s teal. And also ugly as hell.”
"I – " He broke off, hesitated. “Yeah." He averted his eyes in order to stare at the lightbulb in the lamp on his bedside table. It left blue afterimages seared into his vision when he looked back at Cas. "Yeah, I'm just checking with you."
The song wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been, he figured. The singer was alright. He zoned out listening to it, his eyes on the highway.
It was such a contrast to the night before that Dean would’ve found it funny if he wasn’t busy feeling the bottom drop out of his stomach. “Together, you mean?” he finished for him, softly. That buzzing, white noise sound started up in his head again.
There are two more frames of the figures looking into the camera. The next is taken with the camera on its side, facing up at the moon as though it has been kicked through the doorway.
Once they’re in Jacob’s driveway and the engine is off, Jacob and Sam climb out of the back seat and head inside. Dean is still holding onto Cas’s hand and stops him from opening the car door.
The intimate nature of the images haunted his walk back to the shelter. He could feel Dean’s hands on him, the warmth of his palms on Castiel’s hips, the tight heat of his body. Castiel gasped and stopped for air, leaning against the shelter’s brick exterior. The rough texture bit at his hand, but it helped him focus.
A place with no memories was best. They chose the spare bedroom beside Dean’s. Castiel hugged them both, then twisted off his ring and dropped it into Dean’s palm.
Castiel knew that wasn’t really what he was upset about. “I don’t want to leave you,” he said. “If I thought there were any other way…”
“But the good thing is that we found you. And who knows, maybe you and Dean will fall in love again. How many people get to do that twice?”
Jacob has on a leather jacket and aviators even though it’s almost dark, and he rocks back on his heels when he speaks.
“It isn’t. Wasn’t.” Dean leans on the bathroom counter. “Anyway, it’s not you. If anything, I feel better when you’re around.”
“No, but these images are so dark it’s hard to tell if there’s anything there. There’s probably no data but it would only take a couple of minutes to clean them up.”
He’d wanted to tell Lou that his name wasn’t Jimmy, but he’d known it would be easier to accept it for now.
It was a moment before the weight of that sunk in. “I have a daughter?” he asked, recalling the girl’s face and blue eyes—yes, there was possibly a resemblance.
Reddening, Castiel touched his own lips. “Was it not okay?” he said. Maybe he’d done it wrong. Maybe he shouldn’t have done it at all.
Maybe it’s a practical joke. They had time to come up with one while he was in the convenience store. After Jacob tabs through the photos a second time and they all make a satisfied noise simultaneously, Dean’s sure they’re messing with him.
That night, Dean came to his room. He stayed in the doorway, like he had when he and Sam had shown Castiel around the bunker his first night home.
Sam removed the vial from the syringe and gave it to her. She held it in her palms, watching the blue grace twist and swirl.
He browses store windows, occasionally side-stepping someone walking in the other direction. The shops all seem to carry the same type of merchandise: cutesy decor stuff, snappy t-shirts, jewelry made out of some local rock, chocolate bars wrapped in designer paper that cost more than a pack of cigarettes. Cas has caught up and walks to his right. If it weren’t for the echo of their fight from a few weeks ago, Dean would think about reaching for his hand, but he keeps his firmly in his pockets.
Dean mulls over the photos while he devours a plate of bacon sandwiches and half a pot of freshly brewed coffee. A portal seems like a longshot, but given the mound’s connection to the apocalypse, he can’t exactly rule it out.
“Thank you, Dean.” He winced when he realized he’d said it again. He wanted to offer his sincere thanks to both brothers, but if it made Dean that uncomfortable, the least he could do was respect that. “Good night,” he said and when Dean didn’t say anything right away, he added, “See you in the morning.”
The hotel was only eight minutes away from the shelter and down the road from the restaurant, a two-story tan building with a blue sign that said Days Inn. Dean parked against the side of the building and motioned for Castiel to follow him inside. The lobby had a shiny white floor and a blue wall behind a reservations desk. Dean held up his key as they crossed the lobby for the elevator bank. On the walls were framed pictures: wispy clouds against a blue sky, a bright yellow print that said “hello, sunshine.” Underneath it was a photograph of a wooden dock extending into a body of water. Castiel paused when he looked at it, feeling it was somehow familiar, though he couldn’t say why.
Dean played the radio too loud. At the first stoplight, he drummed his hands on top of the steering wheel and turned to Castiel.
“It’s a king,” Dean said, inserting his card and pushing the door open. “Sorry, I didn’t realize we’d be bunking together when I booked it.”
“I don’t mind the couch,” Castiel said, grateful when he spotted one. It would be more comfortable than the floor.
“I got this,” Jimmy said, but the words felt strange, like chalk in his mouth. He went to the sink for hot water.
He lay in a dim beige room with cracked walls; a room with musty, worn carpeting and a tape mark on the wall beside the window. The mark was two inches long and dark around its edges from collecting dust in the residue left behind by the adhesive. Perhaps it had secured a photograph once, a spot of color in the otherwise bleak room.
“You and Sam will always be important to me, regardless of anything else. More than anything else. If our...
Castiel nodded. They left him alone in the room. He stood in the middle of it and turned in a slow circle, waiting for some detail to jump out at him as one he had seen before, but after three turns he was merely dizzy. He spent a few minutes taking his things out of the bag, the sound of crinkling plastic echoing in the silent room. He put his underwear, socks, two shirts, and extra pair of pants in an empty drawer. The suit he hung in the closet. He left the toothbrush on top of the dresser to put in the bathroom later.
They kiss before they separate. Dean can’t stop smiling as he cleans the day off of him. He puts his clothes into Jacob’s washing machine and wears a towel back to the living room, digging through his bag for something to sleep in. Cas is on the couch in a t-shirt and shorts—the ones Dean was planning to wear himself but he can’t be irritated. This is the sort of thing he’s been hoping Cas would do all along.
Glancing toward the house to make sure they aren’t being watched, Dean kisses him the way he wishes he’d done this morning, last night, last week, seconds after Cas made that comment about space. If Dean hadn’t tried to create it, it might never have existed. He kisses slowly, like the tentative kisses of a fumbling boy experiencing love for the first time. In a way, he is. He’s trembling—his hands, his lips, his core. Yesterday this had seemed impossible, but it’s easy. It’s always been easy between them. Maybe that’s what has always had Dean so scared: waiting, expecting a day to come when it stops being that way, when Cas stops looking at him.
“Maybe.” Sam sits on the table next to him but keeps his flashlight on the walls. “Hey, are you and Cas okay?”
“It’s probably the grace,” Dean said. He tapped his head. The elevator descended. “Can you, uh...hear them?”
“I don’t think he wanted to put that kind of pressure on you,” Sam said. He laid the photograph back down. “We thought it’d be better if you got settled in first...see if being back here jogged any memories.”
“It’s creepy, but that doesn’t mean there are ghosts. Everything we’ve seen so far could be coincidence. Wind’s not uncommon in caves, Cas detects weird shit on the regular, and if something’s draining batteries, why did it only hit mine?”
He went out back and stood in the parking lot to accept donations as they came in, helping people offload the goods from their trunks into the shopping carts they would use to take everything inside. One young woman gave away what amounted to an entire household: boxes of sheets, two sets of pots and pans. The excess was always shocking, but at least it was being donated. He went inside to make out a receipt for a man with salt and pepper hair, and when he came back outside, a black Impala was parked across the street. Dean was waiting for him with two cups of to-go coffee.
He had been Jimmy from that moment, only he wasn’t Jimmy. He knew that, somehow. Instinctively, he knew that he was not James Novak, but he wore Jimmy’s face and was brought here under his name.
someone whispered. Lightheaded, he stumbled until his hands touched the building. It held him up while something streaked through his chest and he wondered, dizzily, if his heart had given out.
, but when he looked down, expecting to see Dean’s smile, the marks Castiel’s teeth had left on his neck and shoulders, he saw the marks left by his fists instead.
been down here recently,” Jacob says, swatting the air in front of his face. “I have disposable gloves for anyone who wants them.”
A series of photographs depicts the inside of a structure made of large stone blocks. Limestone, if Dean has to guess from what he’s seen on the History Channel. The walls are carved with symbols grouped in vertical columns. Some are surrounded by a rounded border, like the ones you might see in Egypt. He can’t read them, although he occasionally recognizes one, like the ankh, which appears in four places. In another picture he recognizes the man from the photo upstairs. He’s about Jacob’s height and build, with dark skin and an attractive smile, but something about the way he looks at the camera makes Dean uneasy. The photograph doesn’t appear to be taken here, too many vines. Maybe a tropical setting.
Dean sniffed and absently rubbed at his forearm. He looked like he might speak when their server approached with a tray and set their drinks on the table. After taking a long sip, he spoke, but it wasn’t to answer Castiel’s question.
“Novak,” said the officer, thumbing through a wallet that had fallen from the beige coat he wore. “Jimmy Novak. I knew I recognized you.” More quietly, to the other officers, he said, “This used to be his house.”
Castiel felt happy. He looked down at his clothes and realized he was in no state to leave the room. He’d sweated through his shirt. “I should shower,” he said.
It was a photograph of Castiel and Dean on a beach. Behind them was a row of red and white striped cabanas. Dean had on a black swimsuit and sunglasses. Castiel was tanned and laughing.
“He said that’s what his friends call him,” Sam says. “Do you think it’s worth turning on the tape recorder?”
Dean taps them into his palm while the other three shine their lights on him. “Dead,” he announces, removing the last one from the tester.
“Wasting it would be unfair after what we asked Claire to endure.” Castiel took the vial from Dean’s hand. “How do I...do we have to inject it?”
Castiel wasn’t sure if this was real or if it was an illusion. He blinked several times, but the scene didn’t shift. There was no weapon in his hands. Dean didn’t cry out or start to bleed. Even so, Castiel pinched himself to be sure the world was the world. The pinch hurt. He rubbed the place on his arm in relief.
“End this,” an unseen woman said. The voice sent a chill through him, but he and the man were alone in the room.
It’s difficult to see what it leads to with either side so overgrown with weeds. Backlit by the moonlight, the trees seem to reach toward the car like skeletons. Dean adjusts his grip on the wheel.
His eyes catch on the glint of gold and silver rings in the store’s front window. Not too long ago, he thought of walking into a store like this and picking out something simple. Nothing pricey. Something he can wear on a hunt without worrying but that serves the purpose. Cas, being an angel, doesn’t expect the gestures a human might even though he’s aware of the traditions. The only time he’s ever mentioned a ring was when they played up the fake-couple thing the first time they met Jacob. If he still has Jimmy’s, Dean doesn’t know where he keeps it.
Sam and Jacob descend the ladder and stare wide-eyed at the thing as it takes another step down the corridor, then stops.
“Speak for yourself, you lush,” Dean says over the top of the enormous waffle cone. “Anything particular you want to see while we’re here?”
Sam told Claire he wanted to talk but hadn’t given her any details over the phone. They filled Dean in on the plan during the ride, once it was no longer practical to turn around if he objected to the idea.
Someone was already in the section when he arrived, so he waited a few minutes in case they were a casual browser. Maybe they’d come for a specific text and would leave soon, but after ten minutes they remained in front of Cas’s favorite books. It wouldn’t be an issue for them to occupy the section together, but he’d come here for solitude, to escape the unavoidable press of bodies at the shelter.
Dean laughs. “I’m sleeping like crap, but that’s not what I mean. I’m asking, should I book a room for the two of us for tomorrow? On the coast? Like a vacation.”
him. He pressed his palms together in prayer and thought of his hands as his body and Dean’s body, pressed together in that bed.
“Whether I take a break from something is my decision, not yours. Anyway, I slept last night, didn’t I?”
No. He had to get it back. He needed to know that he wasn’t dangerous, that he wouldn’t hurt them or anyone.
“Touché,” Dean says. “Okay. So the hieroglyphics give the hill some sort of camouflage from Heaven’s eyes, maybe mess with your mind, and a bunch of weird-ass demons decided to turn the place into a weekend hangout?”
“You won’t do what?” Dean said, sobering. He sat up and shook Castiel by the shoulders. “What are you talking about? Are they fucking with you again?”
. Castiel repeated the word in his head. He didn’t know what home was, but he knew he wanted to speak with Dean more.
Jacob passes a Ford doing forty in the right-hand lane and asks, “Out of curiosity, what is worse than demons?”
But there had been a change. In the mornings, when he and Dean sat at the kitchen table going over the newspaper, Castiel could feel the longing rolling off of him like smoke. He hadn’t been able to sense that before. When they bent their heads together to look at the same article, it would surge, washing over him. Every time, he had to stop himself from reaching out and touching Dean, reminding himself that he was not the person Dean loved, not exactly.
“I told Sam everything I know. The hill rose up during—well, what you’ve since told me was the Apocalypse. It sits on a power point. A former colleague of mine discovered it while it was still underground and led his followers there, believing the hill would protect them from an ancient device that was going to terraform the planet. They believed they’d be inheriting a new world.” Jacob pauses and rubs his neck. “Afterwards, the hill got trashed pretty quickly. People cut out the markings as souvenirs. Kids used it for drinking. The state came in and fenced it off. As soon as the weeds grew up, people forgot about it. Sometimes I think I’m the only person around here who remembers it exists, and no serious archeologist is interested in it.”
Castiel swallowed, following Dean’s lead. It was the first time they had done this in a dream, but it was good. He removed his pants and his underwear, so they were both naked. Dean’s body was flushed from his face to mid-stomach. He looked nervous, biting his lip, but he gestured toward the bed. Castiel went to him. He let out a small moan at the warm union of their skin, as his hands skimmed down Dean’s sides to settle at his hips. His erection was heavy between his legs. It brushed against Dean’s, and that—that was good, too.
“Sam said he’ll be up in a while. Guess they’ve got a twenty-four hour coffee bar. Kid’s probably wired. He and I can bunk together. Why don’t you take the one by the window?”
“I don’t know it,” Castiel said, and whether Dean believed him or not, he nodded and let him out of the room.
The man’s mouth had formed a word. It was short, just one syllable. A name, perhaps, but Jimmy hadn’t heard it. The word hadn’t been intelligible.
He held out his left hand. Castiel took the ring from his pocket and slid it onto Dean’s finger. Dean put that hand to Castiel’s cheek. The ring warmed to his skin and Castiel closed his eyes, leaning his face against Dean’s palm, suddenly tired. He felt happy. He felt
From the little he’d learned about angels from Sam and Dean, he wondered if he ought to count himself among the evil things. He wasn’t sure how he should think about himself. He wasn’t human, but he wasn’t entirely an angel either, just as he belonged to Dean and yet...didn’t.
“You said the witnesses stop calling you back. At first I thought they were just embarrassed to admit they’d seen a ghost and talked themselves out of what they’d seen, but what if the hill can actually make you forget that you knew about it?”
“We can drop down to the 50s at night this time of year, so if it gets too cold or if the wind starts up, drag the mattress in here. I don’t care if you move things around. The bathroom’s down the hall. Help yourself if you need anything. I’m sorry to be a poor host, but I’m turning in.”
That night, Castiel learned that he knew how to kiss without making a sound. Sam didn’t stir once. And when Castiel did sleep, Dean’s arms surrounded him.
“She’s back in her room,” Sam said. “She was pretty talkative at dinner. Ordered three desserts. She promised to meet us in the morning. Cas, are you...?”
Once Dean and Cas are positioned inside with a flashlight pointing down the hallway, he cracks a beer and offers the first sip to Cas.
That’s what he told the police when they came for him a few minutes later. He couldn’t remember who he was or how he had gotten there.
If they hear him, they don’t turn around. Sam is busy laughing at whatever Jacob has said. Dean glares at his back and puts his hands on the top rail, easily clearing it. Cas copies him but gets his coat snagged on the fence. It knocks him off his feet, putting a good six-inch rip in the fabric.
“I don’t know,” Sam was saying. “I can’t find anything in the books about the effects of borrowed grace. From what I can tell, it’s festering in him.”
“I’m here,” Dean says quietly. “I don’t really want you coming down here, but, uh...you should probably see this.”
“You’ve worn pretty much the same thing since I met you, except for that time you were...” Dean trailed off and reached for his phone. He scrolled through it for a moment and turned the screen around.
“Sam said that she woke up a little while ago. They were running out to get something to eat.” Dean swallowed. “Are they...back? Your memories?”
“Guess they’ll have to make do with coffee,” Eric said, but Jimmy stepped up to the machine. He had no experience with machinery, but his right hand felt along the side to a power button. He switched it off and the machine stopped humming. He opened the front panel and looked inside.
Still, the beds here were more comfortable than the one in the police station. It had been behind bars—a jail cell, he now understood. They hadn’t considered him a threat, but it was policy, just like the assessment an intake worker had done of him as a part of his application to become a shelter resident. It had taken Jimmy a long time to fill out the forms, and a few days later he’d been assigned to a case worker named Lou who’d asked him questions about himself and his background. He’d answered as best he could.
“Don’t worry about the coat. We’ll get you a new one,” Dean says, offering a hand to help him to his feet. As soon as Cas is upright, Dean shoves his hand into his pocket. Cas brushes grass and dirt from his coat, and they start after Sam and Jacob.
He located the kitchen by Dean’s voice and the scent of food wafting down the hallway. Dean and Sam were sitting at a small kitchen table in a sunken room off of the left side of the hallway. Castiel stepped down to join them. Dean looked frustrated when he did, scowling, but he motioned to the chair next to him.
“At that time I was, but I don’t need to think anymore. With our way of life, I didn’t plan on making it past forty. Didn’t seem fair to hitch myself to someone when I can’t promise them much of a life, but I don’t think you’re in the market for a picket fence.”
“The bathroom is two doors down. Your clothes are in the closet,” Sam said. “You don’t have too many of them, but we’re probably making a Walmart trip in a few days. We can pick out more then.”
“You’re up!” Sam says, noticing him staring. He hops up from the table and squats beside the mattress, turning his phone screen so it’s facing Dean. “Check this out.”
Shrugging, Sam took out his phone and scrolled through his contact list. “One way to find out.” He tapped the screen once and the phone began to ring.
They’re lying with their arms around each other when Sam and Jacob finally stumble up from the basement in a fit of muted laughter, shushing each other as they tiptoe across the living room. Dean hears a few sounds he can’t quite identify, more laughter, and then the bedroom door shuts. There’s a thud like two grown men landing on a mattress. Someone moans. Dean blinks a few times in surprise and turns his head. Cas is awake and looks like he’s thinking hard.
That’s fear in Cas’s voice, something Dean can’t ever remember hearing—not even in Purgatory where everything in that forsaken place was trying to hunt them down. He stops arguing and walks to the hollowed-out area beyond of the exit, taking hold of the ladder, but before he starts the climb, he freezes. The rectangle of sky above him is interrupted by the shape of something looking down. Dean draws a quick breath and aims his gun.
“Next week, we’ll be speaking with an official from Washington who says he has compelling evidence that Bigfoot may be able to operate vehicles. You can follow us on Twitter for updates at realstorypod.
They drove for nine hours and thirty-eight minutes from Illinois to a town called Lebanon, Kansas, stopping three times for fuel and food.
Some time later, they ended up on the bed. The inside of Dean’s mouth was warm. The inside of his body was warmer and tightened every time Castiel moved his hips.
“Castiel only used Claire as a vessel for a short time,” Sam said. “But it makes sense that some of his grace would have remained behind.”
He had on the same clothes as yesterday and looked as tired as Castiel felt. Being on his feet after hardly any sleep made him feel like his legs were dragging. The coffee was tempting.
Castiel wasn’t certain if Dean spoke in hyperbole, so he merely nodded, grateful when their food arrived and it gave him an excuse to stop talking.
“I don’t know you,” Castiel said. It was better to be blunt. “I don’t know anything about you. I don’t know who I am.”
“The grace is circulating throughout your body, but according to the research by the Men of Letters, there’s an energy point in the neck. It’s the easiest to access.”
Dean embraced him in the cold, dark room, and Castiel told himself this was not the last time he would know the warmth of Dean’s body or the strength of his arms. It was not the last time Dean would kiss his forehead or whisper his name. There would come another morning, someday, when Castiel would wake beside him again.
He scrawled directions to a Sichuan place in red ink on a scrap of yellow paper and sent them off with a wink. They ordered three kinds of spare ribs. Dean got a beer and drank half of it in a swig.
Dean gets a lobster roll for lunch. Cas sticks with beer, sipping it and frowning at the taste. Sam orders a plate of oysters and makes a show of eating them for Jacob, who tells Sam to tip the shell up and hold it in place above his mouth so he can get a picture. Sam is laughing with his eyes closed in all of the pictures. Dean sees them freeze momentarily on Jacob’s screen. He must take a dozen.
“I don’t know. I don’t know if I’ll be reborn, or if the grace has diminished enough that I will only be reset.”
It’s probably a combination of a long day in the car and not enough sleep, but Dean feels something inside of him snap.
Sam cleared his throat, looking suddenly embarrassed. “Cas, I really think you need to talk to Dean about this.”
Castiel nodded. “I’d like to ask you some questions. I’d like you to confirm things I think might be true.”
He was adapting to the transient nature of the shelter, the understanding that any one of them might leave today and he wouldn’t meet them again. The friendships he formed were as tenuous as his memory. He made sure to smile every time he saw her as though it were the last.
He had one roaring in a few minutes. They sat on opposite sides to warm their hands. The ground was damp. Castiel could feel it through his pants. All around them, insects trilled unseen. Under the coat, Dean had started to sweat. There was a sheen on his forehead. He moaned, and Castiel crawled to him across the leaf-strewn forest floor.
They were quiet for a while. Dean rubbed the ring on Castiel’s left hand. Eventually he took out his phone and took a single picture. The flash had made the background too dark. Dean cast the phone aside.
An inferno came rushing at him, singeing the tips of his wings. Thousands of hands reached for him, the damned crying out, trying to stop him from moving. This was his brother’s domain. His feathers were burning, dropping off in great numbers, but still he went forward.
