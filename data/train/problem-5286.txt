“Yes.”
“Yeah,” he says quietly. “Of course I was. You know that. Don’t you?”
They reach Anna’s, and though Claire’s farewell is somewhat abrupt, it’s more distracted than upset, so Cas decides to count it as a win.
He trails off, giving Cas an inscrutable look.
at that, eyes flicking over him in a way Dean has never seen before but which absolutely has his pants feeling tighter on the spot.
Charlie smacks his shoulder.
“Fuck,” he mutters. “
because Dean’s accustomed to pretty much everything about Cas.
“I’m not kidding, Cas, get out.”
“Right,” Dean says distractedly, not sure what she’s getting at, “But — I was thinking a couple of you could, you know, make a habit of taking Cas down to his garden, in the evenings?”
Dean turns his head, and Cas tries not to look curious about who sucks and why.
“Well, since they wanna go with you so bad . . .”
even more than he thought he did. So no, Cas can’t just . . . duck out after dinner and avoid him. Shit, he
Cas hesitates.
But now Dean doesn’t even have that excuse, yet his stupid mind is apparently fixated on what Cas might look like and sound like and feel like if they—
“But I was with you.”
“I don’t know,” Cas tries, trembling as Dean slides his fingers out, teasing at his entrance. “You’ve shown remarkable restraint.”
“Just – don’t you usually . . . like, when you, uh, when you get off, don’t you like to . . .” He trails off, more embarrassed than he expected, and Cas just looks at him in confusion for a moment.
She wrinkles her nose.
Like, sure, Dean wouldn’t bat an eye if Cas came on
Cas sighs, the kiss he compulsively presses to Dean’s cheek belying his frustration.
Though really, Dean could fuck him to earsplitting carousel music and Cas could probably still get off, just so long as it
Do you know how that makes me feel? Like it’s
“I’m sorry I brought up Hermione/Ron,” he finally says, and is gratified by another laugh.
“Dean, I couldn’t let you kiss me.”
“Even worse than mine,” he lies, and Dean snorts, wriggling a little to look at Cas, though Cas is mostly trying to focus on his laptop.
“Maybe we should just watch the movies, Sam,” he says, and Sam nods slowly.
“This . . . the timing was bad, honestly. I think it’ll be a long time before I want to meet someone.”
Cas raises a brow.
A few moments later, his bedroom door shuts.
Dean heads to bed while he’s in there, too cowardly to hear any details, and feigns sleep when Cas finishes up and comes in.
“Fair enough. He’s gonna be disappointed.”
“Red,” he says, with feeling. “How couldja? How’d ya even know?”
“Alright.”
him to go, strictly to save him from his family, who Cas couldn’t even claim would care if he wasn’t going to be around.
Without another word, she stalked off down the street.
“Yeah, you seem like you’re doin’ real good.” The frown smoothes out, at least, and Cas smiles wider, taking in the rest of him. Dean hasn’t bothered to come all the way inside, which is a shame. Cas feels
And how soon does he want it to happen? He’d thought it was best if Cas played his hand as quickly as possible, if it could be over and done with and then maybe the council would decide it wasn’t worth trying again.
It doesn’t help that even when Dean’s not there, he’s been touching Cas so much Cas catches traces of Dean’s scent on himself throughout the day. Naturally, this means he’s never far from Cas’s thoughts, and since he’s also
Then he sighs.
“Um. I already brushed.”
“Cock,” Dean returns, winking, and then it’s
“How could I possibly have known—” he starts, defensive, and she scoffs.
Dean blinks.
He’s sure he’ll be fine tomorrow. It’s just — tonight — after Dean did that, after Cas had to step forward and scent him in return, Dean’s scent so strong and lovely that Cas had the urge to just wrap around him and
“No. No, I — I like Dean a lot, but I don’t love him. Not like I love you,” he adds, absentminded as he puzzles over this, and Sam freezes.
about.
He hesitates, trying not to think too hard about the real answer to that question, or what led to it, and shrugs.
They chew in silence for a moment, and then Dean nods, swallowing.
“Claire,” the man repeats, eyes warm. “And the mother, or the other father, is well?”
Dean hesitates, then sets Cas’s plate back on the tray, though he’s still not sure how to answer that.
Charlie pulls her hands down, still red-faced and cringing.
It might not ultimately
Dean nods.
It’s disheartening, how restless and unsettled he feels, pacing in his chamber as the sun sets over the castle. It’s just one day, but it leaves a hollow feeling in his stomach, and it might as well have been a week, the way the pretty white walls of his chamber seem to close in on him.
“You’re not,” Dean says flatly, and Cas is silent for a moment.
Neither of them answer.
“Okay.” Dean waits, but nothing else is forthcoming. “You, uh . . . you wanna elaborate?”
“You sure?”
It’s just – it’s so hard, sometimes, to remember that Cas isn’t
“I doubt I could get away with it, but it’s a nice thought. It’s nice here.” She glances around the room, thoughtful. “You're happy, still, aren’t you?”
“Cas looks healthy,” Ellen says after dinner, supervising Dean’s dish-scrubbing like he’s sixteen and helping out in the bar kitchen again.
He’s only human, after all.
He takes a calming breath.
**By 'drawers,' I'm referring to some amalgam of (traditionally) women's undergarments through history. Picture some kind of embellished pair of undershorts. Sorry in advance for any confusion!
John pauses.
“Hey, I didn’t say I couldn’t, I was just pointing ou—”
He’s definitely there when it’s time to return to their room, even if Dean has to wait on him sometimes, Cas unsurprisingly popular company when he’s not restricted to a room in a guarded corridor. There are nights, here and there, Cas away at Mills Park and Dean reluctantly committed to his obligations at the castle, when Dean puts on a soft white cotton nightgown he hopes he never has to wrap his dead horse Mary in, a much more accurate portrait of Cas on the pillow beside him, but they’re few and far between and when Cas comes back and looks at him—
“You know they already did that, right?”
Dean seems to soften a little.
Max waves at him from the puzzle table, looking excited.
thought-
Still. He swears Dean’s hand brushes over his when he passes, and he suppresses a smile.
Cas smiles, wry, though he doesn’t look away from Claire.
“Of course. Your situation is a little bit unusual. Many people actually jump into things too quickly, but their incentive to make it work is usually a little more hormonal, and less — well, competitive.” She smiled. “
“Yeah?” Dean asks, hand moving to cover Cas’s, squeezing tight. “Try me.”
“You look a different person than when I last saw you,” he continues, and Cas isn’t sure what to say to that.
she told him, and now that he knows what a fucking understatement that is, he kind of wants to march out of his room, boner be damned, and give her an earful because what the hell kind of doctor doesn’t communicate important shit like
The woman in riding gear stiffens, eyes widening a fraction.
He fights the urge to turn around; seeing Dean won’t make him hear better.
Cas knew —
Alone he is, though, and once Sam’s off and Dean’s driven home in silence, too out of it to put on the radio and probably just lucky the rain isn’t worse, he trudges up the garage steps and heads straight for the liquor cabinet, because
“That’s not a word. And I have not. Dean and I are just friends. It’s why we moved out of the dorms together.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I do.”
And then he brings one of Cas’s hands to his lips
“Why would you do that?”
“Oh, are you going to be married again, then? What a wonderful surprise!”
The hand not holding his head in place moves to slide beneath his t-shirt, mapping out the planes of his back and then scraping blunt fingernails down the same path, leaving Cas trembling in its wake.
Which — Dean throws him a disbelieving look.
“What? But you’re not the one wh–

! And God knows Lawrence has different ideas about such relationships than we do here. And we’re just — we’re going to send Cas in alone, confused, without any idea what to expect?”
“What?” he mutters, wary.
“What? Dude, come on, you’ve gotta try it.”
Potentially problematic thoughts from Cas: Cas determines that the only reason Dean doesn't want to marry him is because he'd rather marry someone he can also have sex with; Cas feels like this is unfair, since Dean hasn't tried, and decides that he will challenge Dean and they will sleep together as many times as needed for Dean to conclusively decide he doesn't want that, and only then will Cas take no for an answer to remarrying. These are not healthy ideas about the situation (Dean is not obligated to marry him, and 'try it before you decide you don't like it' is dangerous justification), though they come from a place of hurt and naivete about how such things work. Ultimately, the situation doesn't come up, but if it did, Cas would certainly not try to force Dean or anything. He's trying to rationalize a way to convince Dean to still marry him, but it does sound bad, so I apologize if it makes any of you uncomfortable.
“Later, Sammy,” Dean says, and quickly makes his escape before he can get some inscrutable lecture from Sam, who, now that Dean thinks about it, just had the nerve to get all alpha at Dean about visiting. Stupid crush on Cas or not, the kid needs to cool it a little if he doesn’t want Dad breathing down his neck twenty-four-seven.
Because as much as it pains him to admit, Anna might not have been entirely wrong. He thinks of Miss Maxwell, and he feels less bad about what he’s given — about what he’s
Anyway, Cas pretty much refused to accept anything that hadn’t started out exclusively his.
“I’m going to hang up now.”
I’m going to tell you, and then we’re never going to talk about it again, alright?”
“What? Cas, you can’t have a one-way scent-bond.”
“Yeah, no, you’re right. We should wait.”
It feels like — like things finally make sense, because they never have before this, no matter how hard Dean tried to put it together.
He tilts his head.
He sighs.
Anyway, he obligingly lifts his hips, and Dean pulls back, shooting him a sly smile as ever-so-slowly, he starts to slide Cas’s boxers dow—
Quickly, Cas lets go of him.
He sighs.
“I’ve been trying to get you to move for like, two minutes. God. I just wanted to tear off one of the numbers on that flier you’re clutching.”
you’re not trying to get rid of me?”
to Cas? Especially after Cas made him promise to listen, how was he supposed to tell him he wasn’t allowed to ask for that? With the kid out of the picture, Cas didn’t owe anybody anything, and Dean—
Dean curses.
“Not that you ever tried. You were always too soft on him, you and Bobby both. Treated him like a little princess long past when it was time for him to grow up. I mean, look at him. Playin’ intellectual’s bad enough, but the boy’s a damn hippie. Shoulda heard what he was saying when I went up to see him. I know
that.”
How is he supposed to know what to do? How can he even decide?
Cas doesn’t say anything; there’s a faint rustling sound, and then a hiss, and after another long moment, Dean feels his weight start to shift.
“I’ve worked with a pattern, before.”
Susan’s brows lift.
Dean huffs a laugh, a little strained, not that his throat’s suddenly feeling tight or anything.
His brother sighs again, rubbing his face.
Dean stays silent, still holding on, still breathing against him, and Cas does his best to hold him back and show him just how true that is.
“She’s a baby girl, you heathen! You can’t name her Mr. Snuggles!”
like he can read Cas’s mind
“Yes. I’m not sure I’m brave enough enough to walk by the girls in the kitchen and have them ask about it, though.”
But he squeezes Cas’s shoulder as he passes, and Cas-
“Is there a reason why I should say no?”
“Alright. Then . . . I’m not sure what the problem with that was — it’s a good thing, that she found you and brought you here — but if you like her, you should discuss it again. She may have different ideas about things. Or there may be other options.” He tightens his hold on her hand. “These things change, Anna.”
Beneath the table, his foot settles against one of Cas’s.
“Ha, right. He is. I mean,

Dean throws a grin over his shoulder as he heads into the bathroom.
And he knows that, as careful as he is to keep it to himself, to avoid crossing those lines — yes, it’s hurting Dean.
“Because I missed you,” Cas admits. “And I hadn’t let myself, before.”
It takes Cas a moment to answer.
“Like — with a glowing horn?”
Dean hasn’t said a word since he marched him out of the closet, but Cas has a sneaking suspicion he is maybe, possibly, a little bit in

involve manhandling Cas and thrusting his groin against Cas’s ass, but then, Cas is to blame, too. He’s indulged himself with far too many vivid fantasies of Dean, both sexual and otherwise, and now it’s causing him to have a completely unreasonable response to Dean fantasizing about his ex-girlfriend.
“C-castiel?” somebody says weakly, and Dean swallows a growl of irritation.
Cas shuts his eyes and sinks into the water as far as he’ll go, trying to block the image out and baffling fixated on it at the same time.
Which of course just makes him feel even more uncomfortable, because he

He wonders what Cas was doing just now, definitely, but he also wonders how often Cas comes out here at night. He wonders, suddenly, what exactly is in Cas’s ‘flower’ beds, and why it turns out he really

“So, you’re over three months in, now. I’m impressed.”
Cas doesn’t think that’s a very good idea, personally, but perhaps they’re careful to deny this privilege to anyone not truly capable.
Dean perks up, nodding.
“Repeat after me. ‘Cas missed me, and he wants to see me, and if I can just say what I mean instead of whatever weird Winchester bullshit tends to fall out instead, I can end up a very happy Dean-bean for the rest of forever.’”

makes him feel very calm. He feels less lonely than he has in a long while, even if it’s not the same as being back at the castle with everyone.
Cas nods.
“Cas,” Dean admonishes, and Cas narrows his eyes. “Seriously?”
“Dude, this isn’t a negotiation.”
“Do you want to eat with everyone else or do you want dinner sent to your room?” is all Dean can bring himself to say when they reach the inn, hours later than intended.
“I would have let you do everything else.”
And even once it
Ultimately, Cas attributes his inattentiveness to the various stresses of his situation.
Michael just purses his lips.
“Sorry, dude. My bad.”
Cas looks at him for a long moment.

“Assuming you keep your hands to yourself, I don’t see why you can’t.” She pauses. “Unless you think you won’t be able to.”
“For your information, I feel

“Alright. Thank you.” Something hot does sound nice.
Can Cas honestly see that happen?
Cas appreciates Bobby’s honesty, but now he’s even more confused.
Which, Cas has to smother his laughter into a pillow so as not to risk disturbing Claire, but still—
“Good night, Dean.”
“Eh, not too bad.” Dean laughs, a little awkwardness in it. “Claire said I should stop by on Thanksgiving.”

Cas’s stomach pulls tight, and he stares down at Dean, a little shocked by his own reaction.

Cas recognizes the look in Dean’s eyes, now; it’s guilt. And perhaps it’s warranted, if others are to be believed, and perhaps it’s not, if Cas’s instincts are the greater authority, but either way, it doesn’t matter.
“I don’t – I actually don’t have
What’s more, he’s afraid Dean will be angry with him, now. In hindsight, Cas pushed too far; he should have left the first time Dean told him to. He’s aware he can be stubborn, sometimes, but he has no idea what possessed him to do such a thing. The one time Dean visited him during his cycle and Cas asked him to leave, Cas isn’t sure what he would have done if Dean had insisted on staying.
Dean makes an offended noise.
There’s silence, and Cas waits, not quite sure at this point what Dean will do. It’s not like Cas hasn’t snapped at him plenty, but he’s never said anything quite like that before.
“Uh, well, I mean, maybe normally, but — but you know, it’s not, uh, usual circumstances and — I don’t know, man, that just didn’t seem — I mean, it’d be better to send you to where you would have been meant to go if you
“I got that.”
“Ah. Thank you. It was a very nice break.” Cas pauses, tilting his head. “But I’d like it to be over, now.”
Dean’s smile slips, mouth parting in a silent ‘o.’
Really, Dean should just be proud of himself for making it back to his own room, even if he’s not going to be getting any sleep in here, either.
“Can’t see you, Cas. You’ve gotta tell me.”
“If he’s really sure he wants to share,” John adds, looking skeptical.
“My name is Samandriel Milton,” he announces with a confidence at odds with his high voice and skinny, youthful frame.
“You’re not cute or funny,” he retorts, earning a shrug.
No, Cas deserves sweet and gentle at a time like this — devastatingly
“You’re

is that you’ve made fools of the both of us, and the Edenish brat looks like a cheap tramp, to boot.”
“Listen, Cas — you know you can talk to me about anything, right?”
He thinks Cas watches him for a moment, before slowly shaking his head.
“So I guess you’ve already finalized everything with Lettra.”
Dean tilts his head, questioning, and Cas tries and fails to fight a blush, though he makes himself meet Dean’s eyes.
awkward now than it did the first night after Dean collected him — but then Dean shrugs.
Sam’s frown deepens, and the corner of the napkin he’s been twisting tears off.

Crowley scowls, obviously recognizing his defeat, but Gabe has started loudly guffawing.

Dean buries his face in one hand, and slowly, steps aside.
“I’m not, Cas, but — if you still feel that way, you’ve gotta know marrying Daphne is a mistake. Just — we just want you to come home. You can figure the rest out there.”
So he keeps an arm around Cas, who seems to be trying to fuse himself to Dean’s side, and he strokes his hair pretty much through the entire movie — to be more convincing, obviously — and even though it gives him a massive hand cramp, Cas doesn’t try to stop him (which is just further evidence for the whole cat debate, Dean thinks), nor does he make any move to disentangle himself until the credits have completely finished rolling.
Cas isn’t what he’s worried about. Like, he’s pretty sure it won’t be a problem — their . . . whatever it is has gotta overshadow any dumbass biology shit — but still. Things — things can get weird, like that time before, when Cas first tried to help him.

“We didn’t say that. We just want to know how this got started, so we can fix it.”
There’s silence for a good ten minutes, before Dean starts feeling guilty, because while Sam might not get it, he
And then there’s the way Dean’s finger, dripping hot pink paint, draws quick lines across his cheeks before he has a chance to protest. Cas stares at him, at the way Dean’s eyes literally glitter with mischief in the blacklight, and Dean takes advantage of his stupor to press a glob to the tip of Cas’s nose. His mouth moves, turned up at the corners, and Cas can’t hear what he says, but the shape looks like, ‘meow.’
this.
“I know what I said,” John snapped, and Dean flinched.
“Cool,” Valencia interrupts his sister, smiling brightly. “But maybe you’ve, you know, worked up an appetite since then? Maybe?” She fixes him with a hopeful look.
Despite not knowing about such things thirty seconds ago, Cas wants Dean to build him a nest so badly in that moment he feels
“What do you want?” Dean asks, brows knitted, but his voice is soft, faintly urgent, and something in Cas settles, because this is still Dean, the way Dean always is when they do this, unfailingly determined to meet Cas’s needs.
Anyway, several women are already down there working, and they give Cas curious looks when they see what he’s doing.
“Sorry,” he pants, quickly tightening his grip around himself, trying not to think too hard about the unmistakable wet, shuffling sounds coming from his right, and fuck, he

taking the offensive in earnest with Cas, and standing here now, sizing him up and searching for familiar cues, considering and discarding strategies for kicking his ass — it feels strange.
“Afraid?”
Cas has absolutely no idea what to say to that, but fortunately, his sister steps in.
“Fair. I’ll let Anna know.”
“Cas.”
Dean sighs and waves his hand.
“But there’s no honey in them.”
“I don’t think I’ve had one yet.”
“What?”
She disappears into the crowd, and Dean leads them down another street, sipping at his cup.
Cas hesitates.

“How the hell could you let him go?”

Pamela waves a hand.
“True,” is all he ends up saying. “I still think you’re just a sadist, but yeah, alright. Challenge accepted.”
Dean snorts.
Cas thinks Dean’s a little closer than he was a moment ago.
“You looked pretty deep in contemplation there, Cas,” he chuckles, and suddenly reaches across the table to touch a finger to Cas’s forehead.
“Obviously,” Dean snorts, a little muffled. “Not that
“Thanks, Kevin. Happy delivering.”
Dean shuts his eyes, pinches the bridge of his nose, and tries again.
Bobby sighed.
“Uh. I wouldn’t really say I was ups—"
“Shut up, Dean,” he murmurs.
Her lips twitch.
“Are you sure?”
Really, he feels the most like himself when he’s bundled up in the library, reading with Sam and Valencia. Sam is a great comfort at this time, and he doesn’t complain once, even though Cas always leans against his shoulder the whole time. Cas can’t help himself, though. He feels a strange, overwhelming loneliness, all the time now, and Sam’s scent is one of the only things that eases the feeling. Sam smells like family, and sometimes almost a little bit like Dean — like the same forest in a different season — and it soothes the sadness and anxiety that Cas can’t seem to shake.
“Obviously.”
“Sorry, man. I can change.”
“I love you,” he whispers, and Cas goes utterly still, breathing no longer audible.
All-in-all, Thanksgiving is better than it has been in years, and Dean resolutely decides not to try and figure out why.
It’s just — the lines are all so blurred, right now. He’s trying to remember that he and Dean are approaching this from different perspectives, but if he found it hard to believe Dean didn’t realize what he was doing when he was pinning Cas to various surfaces and aggressively thrusting up against him, it’s next to impossible to accept that Dean can be buried inside him, fucking through his own come and looking into Cas’s eyes while he brings them both to orgasm and still honestly think there’s only friendship between them.
“Yeah? I’ll refill the kettle while I’m up.”
“I don’t think you’re a bad person, though,” she says. “I really don’t.”
“Ye s. You still have to leave again. And especially today, I don’t think I’ll like being apart from you.” Cas takes a deep breath, reaching for Dean’s hands. “What will you do after you talk to the councilmembers?”
“Ooh. People like that are
And then, after a beat, he offers his hand.
Valencia stills.
“I’m not just your agent,” Billie says, catching him off guard.
“Alright. I guess I’ll see you later, Cas,” he finally says, once it becomes clear it’s not coming.
Hopefully, the prince won’t be angry over the time he takes.
“Promising. Is there anything I should know?”
Dean looks at him for a long moment, eyes bright, and then he starts laughing.
They both cry a little more, agree she’s perfect and beautiful, nonsense words passing between them as they look her over, and once Claire’s off to the nursery and Cas is settled in his new room, Cas quickly falls asleep, exhausted.

“See?” he chuckles, grinning up at him. “What’d I tell you? We fit perfect, Cas.”
The rest of the closing swims and disappears, Cas’s fingers pinching the pages together and crumpling them, the tips bloodless.
“Cas,” he finally mumbles, trying not to panic. Cas swallows, and Dean thinks his grip on his beer looks a little tight. “You’ve, uh. You’ve been out there by yourself, right?”
Dean just rolls his eyes. Typical Cas. Even totally wasted and probably pissed at Dean, if the last several days are anything to go by, he’s still trying to throw down with the nearest breathing thing.
“Fuck.
“Is it alright if — may I have the last night with Dean?” Cas swallows. “Just Dean?”
“Hey, buddy, what’s up? Thought you had a Skype date with your sister.”

“Of course, you’re allowed to make phone calls, but — you seemed uncomfortable, when I came in.”
Still, even if he recognizes it as a necessary evil, it’s

He hesitates.
“Sorry. What about — what does it feel like? When I kiss you?”
“Fuck yeah,” he mutters, apropos of nothing, and that-
“The heirs. If you can’t — yeah. Then we’d have to figure something else out.”
Cas gives him a surprised look.
“What is it, a horse?” He blinks. Actually— “Is it like horseradish? Is there horse lettuce? Is that why they say it bolts?”
“You alright?” Alex asks, looking speculative, and he nods. “You sure? I can get Billie to come stare at them till they leave.”
“Yeah, but—”
Sam nods.
“Thank you,” he tells Jo, but his eyes flicker back to Dean, who hides a smug smile in a manly gulp of beer.
Cas looks upset.
“So,” she continues. “Castiel has now made it clear that he’s bothered by how flirtatious you are.”
“Me, too,” Cas offers, somewhat at a loss, and Dean smiles slightly.
“Oh, good job me, I can recognize colors,” Susan snorts, but she grins at Cas. “We brought a third cup, on the off-chance.”
But instead he seizes the opportunity, rolling them over while Cas is still peaking and pushes Cas’s thighs apart, holding them in place as he draws out and then slams back into the hot, slick clutch of his body.
On the other hand — what if he

Cas nods, glancing over at him.
“Dean? Dean, you can’t sleep here, you have to go back.”
“Yep.” Dean cracks a smile, sweeping his arm out with a flourish. “Your carriage awaits.”
“Where anyone could see you?” he asks, pointed, and Cas just looks at him.
There’s a pause.
“Oh. Okay. Cool.”
“And I told
Cas gives him a miserable look.
he sends back.
Why do you have to justify wanting to hold on to somebody by being in love with them?
Which, part of Cas wonders about that, wonders about how enthusiastic Dean seems, about how desperate he is to get a good look, about how he can stare at Cas in the aftermath of his orgasm and describe, in detail, just how attractive Cas objectively happens to be, but another part of him thinks that asking those kinds of questions is just borrowing trouble when things are so, so good, when there’s a delicious tension throughout his body and an indescribable heat and fullness in his ass and Dean has him pinned to the bed like he really, really wants him there, and then Dean’s slipping out, readjusting until he’s upright, hands holding onto Cas’s hips, holding him in place as he mercilessly drives into him, and it’s a good thing Cas is effectively stuck like this because he doesn’t think he could move if he wanted to.
“Look, it doesn’t matter, okay? You don’t need to lie anymore, and — hell, we don’t even need to talk about it. What’s done is done, and the important thing—”
Cas rolls his eyes.
“Okay. Okay,

“It’s not like he went through with it.”
By the time he’s finished, Dean’s expression has gone slack, and he stares at Cas for a long moment, searching.
“Well, I didn’t wanna
See, it’s not that
Dean laughs, the sound vibrating through Cas’s chest and straight to his heart, and then he squeezes Cas tighter, though Cas can feel the hand clutching the pretzel lift away slightly.
A plate rattles across the table, Pamela cheerfully announcing her arrival and breaking the moment.
Dean openly acknowledged his reservations about accepting Cas’s help with his rut.
“Dean, stop it,” Sam interrupts, scowling. “I don’t know what Cas was doing — I don’t even know what
“Not that your Uncle is easy,” Patience adds quickly, squeezing her arm. “Whatever he decides to do.”
He’s not sure how he’s going to do it, but he’s going to have to put an end to this thing once and for all.
And maybe they’ll even
Cas smiles slightly, though Dean can’t see him.
“I dunno, Cas,

“What?”

Dean smiles slightly, offering a hand, and Cas reluctantly allows himself to be pulled upright, twisting into a stretch.
His own face fills the screen.
confused about all of it, but he just leans in toward the food as he carries it to the bed and sets it down.
“Okay. And the pills? What kind of pills?”
“I’m not that young.”
Dean can feel Cas staring at him, even if he can’t safely stare back.
“So, that answers the question of why I haven’t seen you around before. You also new in town, or just been hidin’?”
Dean just wiggles his eyebrows.
“No, Anna. Everyone says that once I’m married, I’ll belong to my husband. Just because I’m Michael’s now, and he says I’m not allowed to fight, doesn’t mean my husband will be the same.”
After a quick peek to make sure it’s safe, Dean throws him an incredulous look.
“Ugh. Normally, I’d say everybody moves at their own pace, but we kinda know what Cas’s is, and this isn’t it.”
“Claire. Her name’s Claire.”
imposing on their hospitality — and Dean seems enthusiastic about the piemaking. It’s been a long time since Cas has seen Dean make pie crust, and he guiltily amuses himself during the lulls in conversation by watching Dean out of the corner of his eye as he cuts in the butter with firm, efficient strokes, biting his lower lip in concentration.
Cas doesn’t fight it, simply arches a brow in question as his head hits the pillow.
Cas clutches his hip more tightly, fingers curling around and digging into the meat of his ass, and Dean shudders.
? Cas doesn’t really like him? Since when does he
Which – that’s a good thing, because the more friends Cas has, the better, but Dean can’t help a small twinge over the fact that Cas is still going to be friends with someone who was ready to
Cas hesitates.
” Dean murmurs, heavy as he thrusts against Cas and curls his fingers, and Cas just clumsily nods and kisses him some more; and he should feel bad, should feel far too guilty and ashamed to have an orgasm, but when Dean wriggles in that last finger and quickens his pace, sweat-slick skin sticking together as Cas’s thighs squeeze his sides and Dean ruts against him, he decides that morals are for unimaginitive masochists.
“Oh.” Cas frowns, trying to make sense of that. “But Dean says-”
He hopes it bodes well for his future here.
“Huh? Uh. Yeah?”
“Bite your tongue, Castiel, fairies are
“Shoo, Dean. Cas is a big boy, and we’ll take care of him.”
Still, she looks insultingly surprised.
” Sam tells him. “The one Mom brought back from the villages in the mountains — where you got Cas’s feather stone.”
Not to mention he’d have said all those things eleven years ago, too.
He watches, horrified, as it twitches between them, Dean’s eyes inches away and trained directly on it.
She shakes her measuring tape.
For a long, awful moment, his father says nothing.
“How does she know anything?” Dean grumbles, stalking partway into the room and shutting the door. “Hurry up so I can get back to training.”
Cas is no stranger to having to regularly wash his clothes, and his borrowed wardrobe is more extensive than the one he left behind; still, he’s picky about his drawers, and he’s had to wash this pair out every night after his bath so they’d be dry by the morning.
“Cas—"
Dean frowns.
Cas thinks with a snort. There’s no such thing, at least not for people like him. Clearly, Dean didn’t know what he was talking about.
It’s wrong, to pass up this opportunity. He doesn’t know what it is Dean’s waiting for, why he would be so stubborn.
He wouldn’t, and she probably knows it, but just in case, he raises a brow.
“Huh.” Dean looks thoughtful. “What, uh. What
(Which can only be a good thing. Obviously.)
“I didn’t! God
coincidence, Lettra chose
This is probably why Cas tried to play that stupid joke the other night, and it sure as hell explains Cas suddenly not wanting to sleep in Dean’s room even though two days later he was figuratively throwing himself on the sacrificial pyre of Dean’s rut.
“Then why did you ask?” he asks, forgetting himself, and Michael’s mouth flattens.
Cas is quiet for a second.
He huffs a laugh.
“Dean! Mail.”
“Does that mean you like to think about them if I
It’s just — it’s difficult. Cas has not yet reached an answer to his conclusion — in some ways, he thinks he’s been waiting for Dean to come home, first — but he knows which direction he’s leaning in.
Dean lifts his brows, surprised.
If Dean thought
“What’re your plans for New Year’s?” Dean asks, leaning his forehead against Cas’s.
“Thank you. I should be fine; I’ve done this quite a few times, now.”
“Obviously, that never happened, and I came to see the folly in
“I do. And I think about sucking your cock.”
And Dean thinks, maybe, that he should be afraid of Cas now. If Cas is really the vigilante, if he really killed all those people like that, if he’s really so good he walks away from every encounter without a mark — if he’s not quite human, the way the blue-white light around his fucking
He’s expecting Dean to snap back, but he doesn’t.
Charlie lifts her brows.
“Right,” he mutters, reaching for Sam’s teacup this time. “Okay, then.”
Cas just rolls his eyes.
me — there’s no way he doesn’t know! How can he not know?”
“What? No, there aren’t. I’m like . . . the most comfortable guy to ever relax and be okay with shit, ever. Just try me.”
Things are going well; Cas has no desire to stir up drama; what could there possibly be to talk about?
Dean has been to him since arriving here, how he’s played a not insignificant role in making Cas happy, and Cas’s behavior since he came home must seem terribly ungrateful.
But Dean’s smile is gone, now, shoulders drooping, and as soon as he meets Cas’s eyes -
“It’s weird, don’t you think? Why
That being said — what if this was one of those times Cas

very closely. That sounds incredibly awkward for all parties involved.
Jody gives him a stern look.
Cas sucks in a breath as they keep going, Dean’s calloused palms smoothing over the skin of his rear, and he knew that might happen, knows Dean intends to put his
And heat scent? Was pretty damn strong. He remembered when Jo had been sparring during one of her heats, and the alpha kid she was fighting was so blindly overcome he dropped to his knees and started scenting and nuzzling her sword hand. Of course, Jo wasn’t expecting him to abruptly quit fighting, and she nearly took the poor kid’s head off.
A chill goes down his spine.
“Oh, he’s not interested in that sort of thing. But anyway — you can think about it, Castiel. There’s no hurry.”
has said — Dean kind of thinks they might deserve that, anyway.)
“Not the kind of tonguetwister a person wants to experience in bed,” Cas mutters, but he punctuates it with a warm, eager kiss, heels coming to rest at the small of Dean’s back, body wrapping him up, and suddenly all that heat is kind of making Dean
“Well, this is fine, too,” he mutters, so inexplicable Dean wonders if he could possibly have heard right, but then Cas turns back, twisting slightly to look at Dean. “In that case — I want you to get me ready and fuck me. Please.”
“Yeah. Sam, too. Dad’s probably, uh, pretty pissed.”

It sounds like what almost happened to him, to Anna, what
“It feels – large,” Cas murmurs, tempted to abandon the cloth and feel it with his bare hand, to ask Dean to stand and let him look. The skin is silky where his fingertips just barely brush it, beyond the material of the cloth, and he swears he can feel it twitch in his grasp, though he imagines that’s some trick of the water. He shifts his grip, trying to get a better idea of its dimensions, and draws his hand back down again.

to walk around with a constant, obvious boner for Cas, after all. His friends would never let him hear the end of it — and B) they both know from experience that that’s a lie.
Or something like that.
For a moment, he says nothing.
“Actually, I think I’ll go with him, just to make sure.”
“I’m sorry, Anna,” she says softly.
“It’s his choice, dickhead. Stop trying to make it for him. And again, if you really don’t feel like he’s qualified to do it, then —
“Sure, buddy. of course.”
Cas arches a brow.
Which — it’s absurd that Cas would even

and Dean doesn’t want to —
The sun is fully risen when they resume their journey, although it’s slower going; it quickly becomes apparent that Bela is unable to ride on her own, and Cas isn’t accustomed to leading another horse while riding along himself. A few times, Bela looks on the verge of apologizing, but ultimately says nothing.
Of course, normal people are usually awake by noon.
“With you, anyway.”
“Nah. Like you said, buddy. We’re friends.” Dean clears his throat, smiling a little wider and hoping it looks at least mostly normal. “What are friends for?” he jokes.
Cas doesn’t even
“Oh, wow,” Dean breathes, eyes finally meeting Cas’s once more, and Cas smiles down at him.
“A few years,” he admits, cheeks burning.
Cas blinks.
“No bonnets,” he agrees, and Dean has to look away, this time.
“So . . . you don’t have a
Whatever the reason, all Cas can manage to do is be grateful John is gone and hope that
“Really?”
“Please let us order,” he insists. “I’d like to be alone with Dean.”
” Cas is just shy of yelling, now, and his voice echoes across the half-empty lot. He hunches, ashamed, but he doesn’t know how to handle this, let alone be reasonable about it. “I really — I thought I was. But it was all just — I was naive, I had bought into all the — the hallmark
That part’s still deeply upsetting, somehow. Logically, it shouldn’t matter more than whatever happens in Moondoor or on bar outings with Benny, but somehow — it does.
different. You want me to become future chief and
Children of all ages were fighting against each other. A fourteen year old Dean sitting on the sidelines watching them. He had already won his matches as was expected of him. Now the Chief's oldest son had to see what the others were doing. But not only that. He was supposed to notice what they weren't doing. Every little mistake they made. All so that he wouldn't make them himself.
!" He barked at them using his best chief voice before finally breaking through the Bunker door.
?!" John's voice had gone dangerously calm. Immediately every muscle in Dean locked as he slowly met his father's eyes again. They had changed becoming more dangerous now reminding Dean of what he imagined pits of hellfire to look like. "Nothing Sir! Just that I'm thankful for the new literature and that I'll try to be better." He rushed out hoping beyond hope that this could help him. "That's what I thought" a self-satisfied smirk made its way into John's face before he turned around and left the room yet again.
Suddenly a shadow settled over him. Looking up Dean met pools of warmth, comfort and love. Like hot chocolate and home. "Stare any longer like ya do and ya might go blind ya idjit" a smile crept its way treacherously onto his face as the voice of no other but Bobby Singer flooded him like a firm hug. Settling down next to the young teen Bobby gently knocked their shoulders together while watching the next kids get ready for their match. "Seems like your little rascal of a brother is next huh? Ya think he's gonna win?" Of course Bobby already knew the answer to that. But the way pride seemed to overtake the boys eyes next to him was everything he needed. The drooped shoulders straightened and the young Winchester beamed and buzzed with excitement. "Of course! I trained him after all. Got a mean left hook you know?" A chuckle escaped the older man who shook his head fondly. His eyes never leaving the boy beside him who's eyes in return seemed glued onto his little brother unconsciously leaning forward to get closer to the fight. Bobby mustered him. He had lost weight again. Deep bags under his eyes and all tense from stress.The wise eyes watching the proud brother grew sad.
." He almost spit the word father out like it was venom in his mouth. Dean officially had enough. Something was killing his people and he wanted to know what it was. "I see it
Sighing Bobby looked at Sam's match. If he could he would just grab both of them and leave. Just run far far away. He wished to do nothing more. But sadly he couldn't. The world was a dangerous place and had been for a long while. So the best he could do was to be here for his boys and to support them every step of the way. He could try to raise them into becoming their own person. He could be a rock and a shoulder. A Home to return to since their father clearly couldn't. Shaking his head he focused his attention back on to the match just in time to see Sam taking down someone almost twice his size. Both him and Dean cheering as it got called in Sam's favor.
“I — I mean. Yeah?” He gulps, then decides to try and just play it off. “C’mon. You knew that. We talked about this.”
“Uhhh. What?”
extreme, and you were never even happy about the things you did.”
problem—”
“Oh.”
“Ask him what?”
Dean resolves to try harder.
“You — Sam can’t read that.”
The hall is empty.
Dean settles down, relieved.
Cas tilts his head.
That’s fair, but—
“I . . . I asked him to.”
Abruptly, though, there’s a flurry of footsteps in the hall, and he tenses again, thoughts abandoned as he whirls to face the door, bracing himself for Anna’s inevitable onslaught.
Good-night orgasms or not, Cas apparently took the whole ‘in the morning thing’ seriously.
“’Course I do. You seen yourself? It’s a good thing we don’t
Any other time, with any other person, he’d laugh, because what the hell kind of line is that, but Cas—

(But hey — Dean never said Cas wasn’t special.)
He doesn’t look at Cas while he says it, though Cas has deemed it appropriate to look at Dean while he’s speaking.
“Okay, uh. Thank you, you — you smell very nice.”
Sam looks extremely curious, but he doesn’t ask, and Cas hurries off to wait.

However, he sees the reasoning behind it, and he’s not interested in doing sex with Dean or anyone else, so he supposes there’s no reason to fight this one.
I want it to stop.”
child. How grateful I am to have you returned to us!” she nearly sobs.
“Maybe he already let the right person in. Have you ever considered that?”
Dean’s expression turns pained, and he suddenly pivots, starting to set down his burdens.
She’s quiet for a few seconds.
“Seriously?”
Thankfully, Pamela doesn’t feel like she needs a response from either of them, because Cas, too, does nothing more than shift slightly beside him.
It’s true that this is an offer extended with some frequency, though Cas is given to understand it stands daily, voiced or not, but he generally shies away from the other men during breaks, friendly though they seem.
He flushes. This is probably some kind of fucked up, pre-family-dinner anxiety nightmare. He’ll wake up any minute, and Dean won’t stop by the house, and Cas won’t have a date with him tomorrow night.
“Oh. Oh, good.” He takes a deep breath, slumping in his chair. “Christ, you had me worried.”
when he last spent this much time alone.)
“Hm?” He blinks at his sister, discreetly shifting in his chair, and trying not to smile at the pleasant twinge. “Oh — you can put them both in the fridge. I’m not sure when he’ll be up again.”
“Yeah, okay. Another time.” He offers Cas a small smile. “Tell Claire to do her homework.”
“It really was,” Dean says in a rush, expression pained. “But enough about that, you know, no point dwelling.”
going to speak, because Cas is looking at him like Dean somehow
The invitation is met with a slow blink.
Dean opens his eyes, gives Cas a helpless, frightened sort of look that only lends credibility to the unbelievable, and Cas knows it’s probably cruel to wait, but he lets himself look just a little longer, lets himself feel his feelings without regret, the knowledge that they are returned overwhelming in the most precious of ways.
“That is not a thing,” Cas says, with confidence, and Dean chuckles.
Which — the more Dean thinks about it, the more he can maybe, kind of, see how someone in Cas’s
Cas nods, putting his foot on the step and, at last, allows himself to look at Dean.
Well, needless to say, he probably shouldn’t have joined the mock battle.
“Alright. But, that was then, Dean. Why not — revive the tradition?”
“Hey, you haven’t actually seen ‘em. Sam exaggerated.”
“Wanting someone desperately.”
“Uh. I don’t know. The guy who watches Harry Potter with me and lies about liking ABBA and can’t decorate his apartment?” He pauses. “Definitely the guy who tries to snuggle with me while I have my fingers in his ass.”
“Still?”
“We usually do know better. But . . . as I understand it, you’ve done a lot of good, in coming here. Especially if your heart remains intact, I – I wouldn’t feel sorry over anything.”

he might be amused Dean had been afraid of that. Cas has nothing to gain from killing him. In fact, he’d lose what little he does have.
“Of course,” he agrees, and with a thought for Pamela, decides to start with the successful conversion to nightgowns of his fellow dockworkers.
Cas is not amused.
Sam looks at him for a long moment.
Which leaves him to conclude that the
“Because she wanted to sleep around?” he offered bluntly, no judgment in it. Cas quite happily did the same.
“Uh. Well. It isn’t  — it really — it’s
Sometimes Cas sneaks out and does it anyway, because there are days he misses Sam and Dean so badly he can’t help but want the extra comfort, and though she never says anything, he thinks Valencia needs it, too.
“It was my dumb ass’s fault. I don’t think I can get you out till the morning, so if you spend the night here, I should, too.”
(Cas gives him a look, but he eats them. Across from them, Ellen’s scowling at Dean and Sam looks like he’s

“Is it working?”
Anyway, at least everyone had mostly calmed down by the end. Their first reaction had been to propose sending a

, and you’re enough of a hero to stick around and make sure I don’t?”
She nods.
Guilt crowds in against him, and Dean nods.
Like the fact that the council didn’t get the memo that Cas is not exactly a girl, or anything approximating one.
“Cas,” he says, and the word sounds strained. “You really can’t. Now —

“Excuse me.”
“Alright.”
Sam stares at him, expression twitching like he wants to say a dozen different things at once, reaching for the little bundle again.
it isn’t, but then he pauses, facing Dean with blue eyes that quietly smile in the dark.
Thanks for the umbrella,” she adds, eyes daring, and Cas knows when he’s beat. He’s mostly sure she’s not in any imminent danger, at least, and he’ll be catching up with Dean soon.
“Yeah? I mean, yes, he is. That’s good. That, uh. That works.”
He snorts.
“It means you have underdeveloped instincts for weeding,” Cas murmurs gently, then informs Mr. Dryer: “But he’s a fast learner, and I think this should be more straightforward.”
“We are. But you aren’t.” She sighs. “He hasn’t been good to you. And we’re all very disappointed in him, trust me, but I’d think you’d be worse than disappointed.”

A decade seems like forever, to her, but what happened also seems like a pretty big deal. Maybe now that they’re dating again, it’s causing — well, issues. She’d thought, if they got to this point in the first place, then they must have worked all of that out, but — maybe not. Maybe it’s making things fragile.

Abruptly, Cas turns.

wonderful if you let me give you an orgasm.”
“Not but what I’m sure you didn’t try,” Lucy says neatly, and then pointedly looks back to Castiel, gesturing him inside.
“Oh. Oh, no — I didn’t — I thought he wanted help with something.”
Dean doesn’t even pause, just hoists Cas over his shoulder, heedless of his shocked protests and kicking feet, and staggers to the door.
Dean doesn’t meet her eye.
“It’s late,” he remarks blandly, desperate to fill it, though it’s true. They were somehow at the Roadhouse for

especially since Sam and several of his friends are going along, too.
Cas narrows his eyes.

certainly, but since Cas’s particular insecurities would be more soothed by a long speech detailing all the ways Cas’s body is completely irresistible to anyone interested in things like bodies – i.e. Dean – it’s difficult to muster the response Dean is probably hoping for.
He looks offended.
“You can call me — Cas.”

Cas almost turned, in his confusion, before he realized what was meant by that.

“Dean and Cas should be fine out here. Right, guys?”
“Right. Thanks,” he mumbles, and as soon as Cas has drifted away to the kitchen, he pulls up his Skype window.
Dean is looking at him, intent and significantly more sober than Cas. And Cas doesn’t
She pushes off the bed, nodding at him.
There’s a frown, at that.
“I — I mean. It was. I wasn’t . . .” he trails off, not sure how to explain in a way that’s appropriate for someone of Cas’s naivete.
“Yeah, sure. Of course. I’d love to.”
“It’s nice to meet you, Lisa,” Cas says hastily, and niceties out of the way, asks, “What’s embarrassing?”
know how heirs are—”
And then Dean starts shifting around, which Cas doesn’t pay much attention to, either, being somewhat preoccupied with a thorough exploration of Dean’s mouth, until suddenly, Dean has wriggled his legs out from underneath Cas and is smoothly locking his ankles around the small of his back.
“For me licking inside you.”
Cas tilts his head.
“Uh. Hey. Uh — it’s, um, Castiel, right?”
Anna comes to stand beside him, and he nods at her.
A good thing, too; a reluctant glance in the mirror proves that yeah – Dean still looks completely
Does this mean he’s
“Of course, he
Dean looks at him, serious.
Cas looks down. Dean’s in a poor mood today; Cas isn't sure why he felt the need to attend this appointment, but he’s sorry he had to.
“O-oh. Yeah.” He nods, blinking rapidly. “Yeah, I thought — you know. Maybe it’d be better to wait. While we kind of — figured stuff out.”
Dean swallows.
“You didn’t tell me that was part of the deal.”
“Not necessarily. I — Sam, if I could just have grown up faster — if I hadn’t been selfish about my knighthood, if I — well, if I had been someone
“No, don’t — I owe you this much, Cas.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Is it? The other thing you said makes it sound like you’re . . . I don’t know. Like you’re masturbating
“You have a point, Dean,” Pamela says hastily. “I do think we’re getting off-topic. I think this is an important thing to address as an individual, as well as a concern of your partner, but I also think that will take time, and perhaps we should put it on the to-do list.”
Dean spares a longing glance toward the table, but ultimately heads in the other direction. He has no idea
Castiel just watches him the whole time, blue eyes intent, then rises from the chair with unmistakable reluctance.
“I, uh. They seemed . . . that is, Hellenian literature is very, um. Descriptive.”
Cas squints at him sleepily, and Dean arches a brow.
“That your list or mine?”
“How’s the macaroni?” he asks, suspicious. After a moment of thoughtful chewing, Cas smiles, a slight, secretive thing that’s mostly in the eyes, and somehow it makes Dean glad he’s sitting down, or else his knees might be feeling a little weak over it.
Dear God, why is this
He stood there, anxious and uncertain as the voices grew to shouts, until finally, the door swung open, and his mother was shoving Anna through it.
“Um. Well. Probably – um. If . . . well, if Dean
It’s always amazing to Claire how little Anna knows about what’s going on in her kitchen. Val says she does all the shopping, since something she calls an ‘efficiency buff’ means Anna can do it in half the time it takes anyone else, but apparently she doesn’t bother to keep track of it once she brings it home.
Evie hesitates, face taking on a small sort of half-smile as she scratches her nose.
He can tell by the look in Dean’s eyes that he knows Cas is right.
his weirdness is about, it actually is fine.
“Consecutively?”
Cas crowds in close in one fluid moment, palms on either side of Dean’s face as he rests their foreheads together, breathing in deep.
This is not Dean’s bitching-over-drinks-at-a-divebar look. This is his picking-up-boys-or-girls-at-a-decently-respectable-establishment look.
“Thanks, Dean,” she sighs with gusto, and bounces away once more.
Cas wasn’t prepared for that —
Trading passive-aggressive remarks
“Sorry,” Cas says, and he means it, although — although knowing Dean had those kinds of thoughts about him, even if Dean didn’t know what they meant —
John waves a hand, irritated.
“Cas Novak’s tormenting me for no apparent reason,” he explains morosely, and her brows shoot up.
“Cas,” he says abruptly, eyes curious. “Are you — did I hurt your feelings?”
“Oh. Just — that provides context. For why you behave the way you do.”
“Struggling how?”
“Story?”
“Uh. I don’t think I can.”
Cas ducks under someone’s armful of napkins on his way out of the kitchen, and hopes Alex will understand if he thanks her later.
Dean snorts.
Maybe Dean won’t notice?
But still — it was a
“You gonna try that galette or what?” he teases, offering Cas his most charming smile to make up for what just happened, and Cas drops his fork.
“I won’t—”
anyway.”
Dean huffs, head dropping as he scrubs a hand down his face.
Chapter warnings: none that I can think of, please let me know if I missed something.
It’s not bad — Cas decides he likes holding hands with Charlie, in a very different way than he likes holding hands with Dean, because it reminds him of when he and Anna were young — but it does present a problem.
And then it hits him.
Cas abruptly ducks his chin, pressing his lips to Dean’s, and Dean automatically tips his head up, eager for the contact.
In two days’ time, Cas is going to meet Dean’s soulmate. The time for confessions like this, for telling Dean that Cas went ahead and chose him, anyway, even though it really wasn’t meant to be —
Everyone is staring at him.
“I’m dressed,” Dean announces, a strained huff. “And I wouldn’t have had to — you know — if you hadn’t taken so long.”
? That isn’t —
“Yeah, sure. Sounds good.”
Dean swallows.
“I didn’t know how to be with you,” Cas says quietly.
“Oh.”
“Are you asking if I ever think about mating you, Cas?”
“No,” Dean says quickly. “It’s not – I mean, it’s – maybe it’s a little weird, but . . . I’m good. Probably be good for both of us, right? It’s kinda been a long day, you know, so . . . some endorphins and stuff would be . . . yeah.”
using you. I’m amazed she hasn’t already dropped you somewhere, but I suppose we’ll discover her motives soon enough.”
Dean stops short, something cold snaking its way down his spine.
Dean considers it all for a moment, then nods.

For a moment, she just smiles.
“Well, get used to it!”
in New Eden, so . . .”
“Sorry,” Cas whispers, just a muddled outline as he shifts. “I didn’t mean to wake you.”
And he remembers what Jo told him, last time.
trying to fix it takes time, during which water tends to go right through. Thus, it is entirely possible Dean abruptly realized he had urgent need of the lavatory, and it had nothing to do with Cas’s proposal at all
“Are you ki—”
Above him, Cas sighs.
Benny’s still pretty nice to him, of course, but even he looks vaguely disappointed in Dean whenever the Cas issue comes up.
“Dean contributed half of his.”
“Affection.”
he’d be lying if he said it wasn’t somewhere on the list of things he’s nervous about.
problem, and once he sat down and thought about it, Dean figured out why.
I’ve grown up, and I know you, now. And my feelings for you now are separate from whatever they may have started as.”
“But let me ask you this. What about you? How often do you try? How often do you touch him in non-sexual ways?”
“Listen, if
- end
“Cas.”
“How was your evening?” he asks, and Claire shakes free of her thoughts. He’s smiling now, small but there, and Claire had actually had a pretty good evening until she started having to worry about Cas’s boy problems.
“Maybe I’ll buy some. In blue.”
“Good morning, Charlie,” he says, and before he can try and catch a glimpse of Dean, as if he’ll somehow be able to tell the answer just by looking, Sam is suddenly hopping down from the box, removing his hat with a grin.
“But — I don’t know if it still is.”
Anyway, he decides not to comment on that.
He bites into it, and a part of him is nothing but angry at how nice it tastes.
“Eat all the chocolate muffins? Or — oh, god, he forgot and flirted with the waitress, didn’t he? That girl in my chem class that he used to date complained about it
Cas rolls his eyes and finishes pulling up his pants.
alright?”
And — oh.
He’s quiet for a moment, eyes on the road.
Which — Cas is pretty sure — nay, almost
“Wait — Dean—”
He doesn’t, but Charlie doesn’t seem to want to elaborate. She clears her throat, steepling her fingers.
Cas opens his mouth to retort, then shuts it, wondering if Dean realizes what he’s said.
He doesn’t shake him off, though, just watches Dean, sharp and unblinking, and Dean swallows, not quite sure what to make of that look.
“Why wouldn’t I want to see you?” Cas asks, baffled. Hadn’t he told Dean, repeatedly, that he enjoyed his company? That he wished he could have more of it?
She gives him an impatient look.
things wrong with that.
Dean frowns. He’s not great at the feelings thing, but Cas’s agitation is pinging his radar like crazy, and this little comment cinches it.
making Dean feel better.
Cas can count on one hand the number of times he’s received direct orders from John — he hardly ever sees the man — but he doesn’t like it one bit. Getting orders from Dean is a pleasure in comparison.

He just — he wants it so
“No,” he says, leaning across the aisle. “Because I heard someone cry out, and I wanted to help if I could. And I
“Well, we can all stand to be happier. And yes. Yes, there are probably things you could do to make him happier, although if he’s having problems with work, or his other friends, or even just internally, it’s not reasonable to suppose you or anyone else can fix those things for him.”
that’s helpful, but I asked
Defeated, Charlie drops the crown back on Benny’s head and proceeds to kick everyone’s ass at poker.
There’s something off about Cas’s tone, and Dean clears his throat.
For a long moment, silence reigns.
diarrhea, or you would have come to give your excuses yourself.”
Dean just stares back.
And Dean never wants to tell anyone, ever, about the Locker Room Incident.
Dean still looks a little confused, but he lets go of Cas’s hand and pulls him into his arms. Cas doesn’t bother resisting. The world is falling down around him and Dean is refusing to do anything to fix it, but the hug is still deeply reassuring.
John snorts.
“Jesus, what am I doing?” Cas hears him mutter, and then he lifts his head, offering Cas a small smile. “Sorry. Where, uh. Where’d you wanna go next?”
“Of course, Max,” Cas returns, a little at a loss, and Max nods.
God. What a fucking mess.
Dean’s cheeks turn rosy, and Cas wants to press a kiss to each one.
Dean huffs. “Guess I should just be grateful he
“No.” Cas pauses. “Though I might have called an exorcist.”
Dean quiets, brow furrowed.
Beneath the coat, he can just barely identify the shapely silhouette of jean-clad thighs —
But before that, Cas had once thought that, no matter how badly he wanted to be of service to Dean, he wouldn’t be willing.
Suspected Cheating: In light of Dean’s request and the probable lie of the drinking binge  with Charlie, Cas comes to the conclusion that Dean most likely cheated while Cas was in New York, and that this may have been the primary factor in his wanting an open relationship.
Dean stares for a moment.
“Could be a number of things.”
Dean grimaces.
“How valiant,” he declares. “I do hope you plan to stay.”
So thank you very, very much. It's been a pleasure, and I hope you all take care (and I'm deeply sorry if you read the late night rambling version of this note). Please enjoy ♡
at him, and Cas has no choice but to look back, appalled.
Another loud chorus of laughter follows in his wake, but it just makes him smile.
“What?”
It takes him a while to realize there’s another long silence happening.
“Okay. What, uh. What is it?”
He looks frustrated when Dean abruptly withdraws it, and Dean tells himself it’s just because of the pasta.
Dean nods slowly.
Pamela snorts, and Dean just rolls his eyes.
to him instead of leaving is basically a fucking miracle. It’s like getting told, every single day, that things are good and Cas is glad he’s there again, and maybe that’s a shameless extrapolation, but it’s one he’s decided to go ahead and believe, because even if he tries, he can’t really find a good reason not to.
“I thought this was date three?”
“Are you
They stare back, unimpressed.

“What was that about?” he asks, once he’s made his way to his chair and Cas is settling in beside him.
lying through his teeth, and given the teasing note to Dean's tone, he’s probably right.
“The night you lose your V-card.”
“It means I — prefer you. Your looks, your — everything else. I find them, uh, more appealing. Than any others.”
They order a couple of cocktails while they wait for their meals, and Lisa admits to having been nervous.
Cas hesitates.
Cas nods.
There’s a strange mix of surprise and relief on her face.
“Oh, my
Cas stills, then abruptly pulls back, eyes dark.
Cas didn’t know much about Dean’s mom, but there was something dangerous in John’s voice, like this was a bad thing, and Dean’s face crumpled.
He does like to spend a good portion of his day with Sam, and he certainly wouldn’t mind living with him. Perhaps he gave him the wrong impression.
Kate’s a n omega herself , but Dean would say
Besides, Dean had been trying to get him to tag along for years, and clearly, he thought this was a ‘last chance’ of sorts, a new hint of desperation to his wheedling.
“Good, Cas?” Dean whispers, slowing. “You like it?”
“But . . .”
“Is that right?” Pamela asks curiously.
His irritation melts.
“You seem . . . tense. Sam thought so, too,” he adds quickly, and Dean shrugs.
Dean rolls his eyes, relaxing back against his pillows.
Dean shrugs.
“Since when do you get out?” she demands, wrapping a hand around his arm and pulling him to the side.
Dean feels bad about it, at any rate, some weird combination of guilt and uneasiness, and something else he can’t quite articulate.
“Because it will smell like me,” Cas finally concludes, blue eyes intent, and yeah, Dean is grinning like a dumbass.
“Uh.”
“Unfortunately, Sam, that’s not unrealistic.”
“Ah.” Cas nods. “Smug.”
“There’s already tomato sauce.”
“Looking forward to it, Cas,” he says, and then he kisses him, soft and sweet, and moves to pick up a crate.
Cas was, Dean can’t bring himself to say anything.

“I see.” Jody studies him. “Jo thought he seemed better, when she visited.”
The guy in front of Sam coughs.
end up on the shelf; that fertility boost is too much of a boon to those wealthy houses.
“And one of the things we argued about, yesterday, was — other people we might be seeing. Dean mentioned New York, I was confused, and it became clear there had been a — a misunderstanding.”
He’ll just have to wait and see.
Cas is the one who demands a hug this time, and Dean is good with that, too.
Cas shakes his head.
is Dean not gonna use that feature.
“The stuff you’re askin’ about, Cas — you’re not allowed to do it.”
“Just go talk to Jody, okay?”
“You don’t want my feet cold any more than I do, Dean.”
Cas takes an experimental step back, toward the door, but Dean’s hand shoots out, immediately grabbing for him.
Dean studies him, searching, and then—
polite and well-behaved, no matter what Anna says.
“You think?”
“Alright. Still — tell me about sex.”
“Perhaps.”
Of course, her pleasure dies as soon as somebody asks the sub where he is.
It’s kinda sweet, but Dean’s not even tempted for a moment. He’s pretty sure he gets what Anna was talking about, now, and even if he extracted a promise from Cas to stay ten miles back, safe and sound in a tent, Cas would probably find a way to get himself into trouble.
“Cas, come on. I thought — didn’t I already explain all this to you? If I didn’t, then I’m sorry, but I’ll do it now. Bottom line? If you’re a halfway-decent person, you don’t wanna have sex with someone who doesn’t
But then—

“Cas,” Dean says lowly, eyes hard. “This is not a joke. Now, I appreciate that you take being a knight seriously — I do — but you should keep this in mind: if I think there’s even a
“Charlie,” Sam hisses — he could be meeting his future
Cas frowns, thinking of all the books he’s read.
“Cas, that — that is so not the point.”
Sam’s face falls.
“You know. Before, um. Before college. When we were kids. Things were pretty good. Come on, you agreed, in therapy, that — it wasn’t always like this.”
His mother just looks at him.
Dean throws up his hands.
was meant for someone else, but Cas knew, in his bones, that he was only ever meant for Dean.
“And because we’re best friends. I figured — you know, even if you hadn’t planned on having a mate, it might — you might feel like that would work out? You’d have a partner, of some kind.”
Kate coughs.
doing well, and — I don’t know. I feel bad, trying to mess up his routine.”
“Alright,” Castiel says again, but his grip barely changes. Dean figures it’ll have to do for now.
With a swallow, he fumbles a produce bag from the dispenser and stuffs the lone tomato inside, irrationally keen to get away from the stand, even though the woman is no longer there.

And since not even his younger self actually
It wasn’t boring; even if Cas didn’t just generally enjoy being around Dean, it was all new information to him, and besides — Dean was nice enough to let Cas help with the little things, so in a way, he learned, too.
And Cas doesn’t even stop to think about it — he just

“But,” he starts, when he’s finished. “Isn’t that, uh . . . I guess — I don’t — I don’t wanna come on too
Dean goes back to Bobby’s for a nap after spending breakfast snuggled up with Cas on the terrace, and around ten, he makes his way to Mills Park to talk to Anna.

Dean stills again.
“Because if your friends find your porn they’ll tease the shit out of you.”
Dean bites his lip, then nods, the tips of his ears scarlet, and next to them, Sam coughs.
“Yes.” His brow creases slightly. “Were you?”
Anna’s face tightens, but she offers a small laugh of agreement before returning to her dinner.
“Cas,” he says, and Cas looks between his hands for a long moment before he finally meets Dean’s eyes.
“Yes,” Cas admits.
Cas deflates.
“We would?” Charlie echoes, and Cas hears a soft thump.
When Cas started exploring himself and the world around him, he and Dean experienced a dynamic shift and gradually, negotiated a new normal; after Dean moved out in senior year and they didn’t speak for ten months, they once again reset the status quo and eventually figured out a new, different equilibrium.
Dean takes it, letting Cas help him out of bed, although he feels surprisingly fine and he doesn’t need it.
But Dean didn’t echo his agreement. Instead, he squared his shoulders, looked Cas dead in the eye, and then damned them both.
Cas blinks.
For starters, he probably should have just stayed the whole five days. No matter how antsy he was feeling about leaving things with Cas the way he had, no matter how worried he was about Cas having all this time to list out all the pros to marrying stupid Samandriel, no matter how much Dean just plain
Cas didn’t think they needed to. Dean would almost certainly go home and visit with his family, and Cas would use the time apart as a sort of test to make sure he wasn’t getting
“So he does.”
“If what was weird?” Dean asks, struggling to come down from it all. Which – they really are just supposed to be two friends getting off together, not even fuckbuddies, not even
“Is it . . . is it usual, for an alpha to want to put his mouth places?”
“What? No? That doesn’t make any sense.”
“Oh.”
“You look — Jesus, Cas. I can’t wait to feel you come.”
“What?” He frowns, throwing Sam an uneasy glance. “Are you talking about Mary?”
Cas blinked.
you’re deliberately treating it like a generic question, which is also a red flag.”
Dean sighs.
“Are you fucking kidding me — how many times have we heard Jody’s talk, and you didn’t use a goddamn rubber—”
“Shut up, Dean. I need you to answer a question.”
Eventually, Dean tires of trying to make Cas puke — “If I do, it will be on you!” Cas gasps out, but Dean just spins faster. “Listen, buddy, your vomit can’t be any dirtier than I am right now,” he says cheerfully. Cas, whose face has been rubbing up against the back of Dean’s tunic repeatedly for the last few minutes, is duly horrified — and the party makes their way into the great hall for the celebratory feast.
Then, after a quick detour to grab his emergency weed, (which he put in and took out of his suitcase no less than five times during the packing process because it’s probably rude to get high when you’re a guest in someone else’s house, but also he gets freaked out and it’s the best thing for that), Cas heads out into the yard and, for the first time in years, climbs a tree.
Dean understands that Cas

** SPOILERS **
He hits pause, propping an elbow on the sofa-back and catching Cas’s eye.
“It’s a pain in the ass to harvest. Add that to the order, if you don’t mind,” he says to Cain.
“Did I do that?” he blurts out, horrified, and Dean blinks, surprised.
“Not all of ‘em, you don’t. Not even the most important ones.” He leans back in his chair, stare cold. “I think this’ll be good for you. Teach you a thing or two about diplomacy. Try not to start a war while you’re there.”
His mother’s small smile tightens, though it doesn’t disappear.
(Dean is, possibly, being a little petty.)
Dean blinks, and then he smiles, eyes warm and crinkly and so — so
“A little?”
Dean trusts him. If Cas says he’s not in love with Sam, then he’s not in love with Sam.
happen, and Sam can’t reasonably expect him to try and cope with that up close.
She turns, inclining her head slightly; she’s leaned against the wall in a dressing gown, arms folded and hair knotted loosely at the nape of her neck, and she looks tired.
“Hey. We’re still in public, buddy.”
He tenses, trying to determine the source. It could have come from inside, but there’s a small, rectangular window on the outer wall of the restroom, and if Dean’s oriented correctly, it lets into a narrow alley. He thinks he saw someone smoking there, when he and Jo first drove up.
Dean nods.
“’You, uh. You want me to play you a cartoon?” Dean tries, one hand rubbing soothing circles against Cas’s back, the other stroking through his hair, because Cas
Of course, lying in bed and listening to the shower run, Dean eventually organizes his thoughts enough to realize that no, it doesn’t sit right, and that’s because yeah, he did something wrong.
“Yeah. Yeah, it — these things don’t really work, if you don’t know. I mean, they can, but — it makes it a lot harder.”
The brawny kid in the cap has been smirking, mostly in the eyes, this entire time, and murmurs his agreement, while the gangly one tears himself away from his sandwich and bobs his head enthusiastically.
He doesn’t stop grinning, not until well after the call is over and Samandriel is drooling an impressive puddle by his shoulder, and at long last, he falls asleep.
“Are you
“Yes.”
“So, uh. I was thinkin’ we should talk.”
Cas experiences a perverse sort of smugness at the confirmation, but he politely stays quiet.
In light of that, Cas shouldn’t be surprised when Bela shows up the next day and promptly hands him a box.
“Yes.” Cas shrugs, somewhat sheepish. “Bobby got mad at you, and I followed you upstairs to bed, and then when you made it clear you’d been so angry because of what was said about
Well, Cas can appreciate
He hastens to his room, though he’s in no particular hurry as he dresses and pulls out the mats, extremely conscious of the fact that Dean, also, needs to get ready, and when he goes to do so-
It’s also kind of . . . unsettling. It reminds him of the days he wasn’t an adult, the days having to let go felt like a special kind of torture and nothing felt as right as it did when Cas was close enough for Dean to register his body heat; the days when Dean just
!" His father's voice vibrated through the whole study every single adviser taking a step back. John himself had gone red heaving hard. Dean knew immediately that he made a great big mistake. "You will leave and go into your room right now. You'll wait for me and stop asking Questions. Are we understood?!" His father seemed to look and sound more dangerous by the second. Swallowing hard he nodded. Before slowly leaving the room.
Somewhere far away in the darkness a peaceful figure sat up abruptly. Blue eyes opened wide full of fear and confusion. Castiel tried to stop his racing heart and to calm his heavy breaths as he scanned his surroundings for danger.
This chapter is not beta read. It's also my first fic here so please don't be to harsh.
Screams could be heard all through the village. Being awoken by screams wasn't the nicest way to wake up but sadly Dean Winchester had gotten used to it in the last couple of weeks. Ever since the attacks started. Immediately after the first scream Dean had been wide awake quickly pulling on some clothes grabbing the closest weapons and leaving his room. Running through the bunker halls he stumbled first upon Sam then Charlie. He gave both a firm look. They might all be adults by now but Dean would sure as hell not let them run into danger. "
But then... "
"Ya see... Angels exist out there just like monsters just like demons. They are not the typical form you'd expect with a harp or something. They are soldiers. Cold blooded merciless flying assholes. Angels are in the same danger category as demons. Stupid if ya asked me. They are way more dangerous and way more angry especially since..." He sighed. "Our ancestors. These idjits. They took something from them. And the angels want it back. They searched for it and are incredibly angry. Even started the whole apocalypse. Got that bad that even Lucifer is on their side now. Heaven is reunited which would be great if ya aren't the reason why." Bobby shook his head. "Many believe it's just a horror story but it's in the old journals. They were even proud. The bastards. Well.. " Bobby emptied his bottle getting up and grabbing a new one as he watched Dean. Who seemed to look more confused with every new piece of info he got. Honestly Bobby couldn't blame him. "...now these angels found us. After many many many years of us hiding. I advised we should just right the wrongs but your father doesn't believe it. Even after your mother..." He swallowed hard. Remembering what happened to poor Mary as if it was just yesterday. Shaking of his own feelings he had to focus on making Dean understand. "Not only Angels are interested to find what was stolen. Demons are as well. Not just any Demon tho. Only the most powerfull Demons are out there searching. They think they might have a chance to overthrow the feathered dicks or something. And one of them…" Bobby had to pause again. He knew that this would rip Dean's healing wounds right open again. "One of them found us all those years ago. He was so sure that we knew more than we led on. So he took your mom since she was the wife of the chief. He wanted information. Information she didn't want to tell him. Information she didn't even know. Of course... that didn't end well." Sad Bobby looked at the ground. Slowly Dean tried to process everything. Letting it sink in. It took him a while. One emotion flooding over after the other. Completely overwhelming him and taking full hold of him. At the end the only thing left was anger. Anger at his ancestors for being so stupid. Anger at his father for ignoring this problem. Anger at his mother's killer and anger at everything and nothing for him not figuring this out sooner. So he made his decision.
Anyway, he’s pulling one of the soft, supposedly-eggshell-colored cotton ones over his head when he hears a sound of awe from the other side of the screen, unmistakably coming from Dean.
Mr. W smiles, rueful.
“If I can.”
Dean shrugs, the back of his neck hot.
“That doesn’t sound like nothing,” Bal admonishes, and Cas sighs.
wrote that book,” Cas informs him darkly. “And while I understand his residual grief over our other brother’s fate, the fact remains that he had no right to try and sabotage me. Especially when my other siblings delivered that book to you with good intentions.”
Or tried to, anyway.
“Dean is a physical person,” he offers, unsure what else to say. “Even if he shies away from obviously affectionate gestures.”
“Perhaps,” he says slowly. “I still thought it was nice to see a familiar face here.”
“I’m sure.” He isn’t, not at all.
No, all the knights at the castle apparently acquired dresses especially for this occasion. And floral hairpieces from Miss Deirdre. And Layla made a tower of honeycakes. And some of them have been working on a play for months, which they put on.
and he tells them so, kisses their throat and collarbone and breathes them in as they move, and he can’t sort out if it’s slow and languid or fast and urgent, just that it’s exactly what he wants right now.
– fuck you, I bought that size for a reason, now
“Oh.”

Cas just looks back at him, lost.
“Is this – what?”
And Cas would be delighted, were he
“Well, I had a good reason.”
just like I know that’s a weak-ass lie. Getting Cas to run away of his own free will is a
“Sure. Thank you,” she says eventually, and the bitch-face emanating from Sam’s seat is everything he’s ever dreamed of.
It takes Cas a little longer, because he’s curious as to why Dean’s talking about that — why he’s thanking Cas, instead of Ellen.
After literally being thrown out of Dean’s room, Cas was certainly not brave enough to try visiting again, and even if he were, he doubts it would have been well-received.
“Cas. This isn’t a joke. Either get in there and wash up, or I swear on Baby’s engine, I will do it for you.”
decision he made in all of this, and — fuck the rest of us, Sam. That’s what we need to respect.”
All the blood in Cas’s body seems to rush to his face, and he banishes the thoughts from his mind, plate coming back into focus.
He grins.
“Please do,” Cas agrees, and after a beat, Dean nods and turns to the steps.
Cas pulls back, voice returning to a normal pitch.
He heads for the kitchen, not missing Claire’s unhappy face, but not at all sure what to do about it.
For a moment, Cas doesn’t know how to answer.
“I wasn’t ready to leave yet,” he says, fixing Dean with an inscrutable look, and for the fiftieth time that day, Dean thinks about the not-cuddle.
Cas looks at him.
“Alright.” Cas swallows, searching. “Alright, but — what, then? You’re really — you can’t possibly want to be alone.”
“Yeah?” Dean clears his throat, reaching for the spatula. “Put on some
Benny frowns.
Charlie sucks in a breath, fumbling the apple.
“Don’t play stupid. When I leave — why don’t you come along? You’re old enough now, I think.” He smiled, a rare thing on John Winchester’s face, looking genuinely pleased with himself. “You got your own car, after all. Hell of a car, too; you’re practically a man.”
if he does, Dean currently
“I did this week.”
By the end of lunch, Charlie still hasn’t convinced him, Jo is still casting him speculative looks, and Dean’s barely said anything at all.
Cas doesn’t know what to make of that, either.
“At least twenty-two.” He pauses. “Could be as old as thirty. Dude’s got a lot of different things going on.”
He looks between their worried, disgruntled faces, and decides that, hey—
Still, since he doesn’t want to be evicted
“Continue.”
Dean huffs a laugh.
“I suppose I did, didn’t I? Still. It’s — what happens in the wedding chamber is . . . supposed to be a secret!” she finishes, perking up. “It’s shameful to talk about it, even to Michael. You’ll make both us and Dean look bad, if you do.”
