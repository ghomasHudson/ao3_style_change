"Leave me to my mate." Sherlock growled darkly back. His eyes wide and black, anger apparent in every line of his body.
"Sherlock Holmes have you been teaching our son to read people?" John stood and strode over to Sherlock, leaning down towards him and pretending to be angry.
"Is it twue?!" Hamish demanded, his eyes wide. "Is that when you met Daddy?" He turned to look at Sherlock, narrowing his eyes.
John ran his tongue over his teeth in clear agitation, his entire face tightening with emotion. It wasn't that he didn't want Sherlock close, no quite the opposite was true. He desperately wanted to be close to Sherlock in a way that was almost purely indecent. His thoughts straying to
"How I failed him..." John whispered looking down as tears came. Mycroft bit his lip nervously. He did not know how to properly console John in this moment. Least of all when it was quite possible that Moran had been involved in the plan.
“She told me to never tell.” He mumbled to himself, clutching his pendant. He paced silently for a few moments before deciding that he needed to tell Mycroft and Sherlock the whole truth. That the only way to protect his family would be to be honest. “The Matriarch of my clan told me never to reveal this secret to anyone outside our line, however it is possible that Moriarty has been sent by someone who knows the truth. There are a few of the older Solvanar that know the secret of the city." He sighed and put a hand over his pendant, there was a whisper of magic through the room and when he removed his hand the pendant was markedly changed. It now bore two intersecting but different sets of knot work and a fire opal set in the top near the chain. "I am not solely an Oaken Solvanar.” He stopped, looking at them both. "To understand what I mean I must give you a bit more of the history of the breaking of the twelve." He sighed taking a deep breath. "There was a civil war in Solvanar. It is what lead to the three lead families, the Elder, Yew, and Oak removing the others from the city. As you know Mycroft, the Solvanar family lines work in very specific and usually predictable ways. The vampire patriarch wed the mortal matriarch and they had children. Always female. Those children, specifically the eldest child would then wed another man and it was her choice to choose a vampire or a mortal. They would also bear female offspring. That third generation would then choose their mates. So long as the mortal woman chose a mortal man it is then possible for her to bear a male child. If she chooses a vampire she will simply continue the cycle of female begetting female. It came to pass that one of these third generation women in the Elder line chose a vampire male as her mate. She became pregnant however instead of bearing a child as predicted she bore twins. Two girls, identical in almost every way. So the Elder family decided that it was time to unite the three. Each girl was promised in marriage to the eldest son of that generation of the Yew and Oak families. Resulting in two mixed lines. My ancestor Airvae chose to become a vampire shortly after his twentieth year. His wife, the daughter of Elder chose not to accept the gift of eternal life. So he protected her and fathered our line but allowed her to pass to shadow when her death came. It is because of the blending of the abilities of the two lines that I am a mender. My sister was as well." He sighed, sitting down. "It is also why we were twins."
mate, Mycroft! I love him! He loves me! He is mine!" Sherlock was still shouting, his voice echoing in the room. "Why are you so intent on trying to take him from me!?"
“John, you are not being sensible, I most certainly am able to…” Gregory began but at John’s look he just shook his head, smiled and obliged. “Very well, I shall remain here.”
"Well the plan didn't involve Hamish and he was injured. So I don't think I deserve any credit for a bungled plan." John blushed because he realized Sherlock was staring at him.
"Yes." John sighed. "I have, it was then that I understood what was before me. It was not enough to influence my own mortal life but it was enough to inflame the blood thirst. When my Uncle returned I informed him I had discovered my mate and that I was going to give myself over to you. He was disappointed beyond measure and tried vainly to convince me not to go through with my plan. However after several months of discussion and correspondence he relented. He understood that I was motivated not by power but by love. He crafted a story that I had been discovered and killed, thus ending the branch of my family." Mycroft smirked but he was careful not to betray his thoughts on his face.
“The killer knew the victim,” John cut over Sherlock before could speak. “Judging by this shoe print it was a male, tall. Older, he limps slightly to one side…” Sherlock couldn’t hide his smirk. "Likely an old injury coupled with arthritis or degenerative bone disease." John trailed off and Sherlock picked up, smirking as he did.
"There's so much and it is all still very disorganized in my mind. Though what Mycroft just told me has cleared a lot of it up. It seems that Moriarty had his eye on me for quite some time before he first made an appearance where I could see him. I think that is why Mycroft setup for you and I to meet, so I would have an ally against the oncoming storm as it were," Sherlock's voice was even and focused as he worked gently, checking the wound over like he was shown. "But Moriarty wasn't prepared for that variable and you quite literally shot his plan full of holes. There are still a lot of pieces that don't fit quite right, I'm missing something bigger about it all." He sighed, conceding he was at a loss.
"I don't want to be with her." He whispered. "She proved to me that these feelings were dangerous. It was easier for me to be caught off guard by them with her, when she suddenly showed up. I did feel very strongly attracted to her, I could have grown to love her I imagine but my heart already belonged to you. After she… After what she did I determined it would be wrong of me to let you in further."
"Oh for fuck's sake," John's groan was pure desire as he hooked one hand in Sherlock's hair. Sherlock groaned into his neck.
John poured the two cups of tea and sat down at the table while Sherlock opened the tin and set two biscuits down in front of John, taking one himself as a show of solidarity. John tried to focus and make himself eat his, but the effort didn't go well. He hadn't had anything solid in three days, making his stomach a bit confused at the sudden addition of sugary cookie. He looked up and caught the intensity with which Sherlock was watching him, fascination evident on his face. John blushed.
"John," He clicked his tongue. "You need to rest and to eat properly. Don't start something you aren't ready to finish." He grinned with pure desire and then picked up his violin. He did a few strokes across the strings to warm up before turning to look John directly in the eyes. "You had better clean up, we're going to dinner tonight." Without another word, Sherlock began to play John's favorite tune, not seeing the tears that fell as John turned back to clean up the kitchen.
John felt the edges of panic sweeping through his body. He heard Sherlock talking and the words were clear but he couldn't absorb them. Hamish and Sherlock were in danger, in danger from his father. Sherlock was once again at the edge of potentially being ripped from his life by those hands. Those hands that had hit in anger, beat because of intolerance, and tore at flesh because of hatred. Those hands that should have raised a boy to become a man and instead taught him to hide from everything that made him who he was. He shivered violently and just barely kept the tea cup from rattling against the plate. He set it down as Jacob answered Sherlock's question.
"There is still fire raging in my blood. I am rather grateful you did not allow me to drink your glass as well." He conceded, smiling as Sherlock wrapped around him.
"I thought you'd stopped having them." John shivered slightly as Sherlock wrapped back around him, pushing his head against his shoulder. John let his nose gently touched the fabric of Sherlock's shirt, inhaling the scent of his lover.
"Yes, morning it is. Incidentally John, I wasn't aware your family had any connections with someone the likes of the Pendergrass family." Mycroft was not as rigid as he usually was, moving easily into the room and surveying the breakfasting family.
"Mycroft, my husband and son are in there…" Sherlock started towards the house but Mycroft grabbed him and shoved him hard into the car in an unexpected show of emotion. Greg raised a hand but didn’t make any other motion. He was not mad enough to try to get between the Holmes brothers when they were fighting.
"I know you're on a case." John kissed him softly. "But do you think you could come back to reality with me for just a few minutes? I need to know what you want me to pack up today and what you will need until tomorrow."
“There is a history within the Solvanar that most the world does not know. A secret history that has been kept from the world in order to protect the ideals that founded the secret city." John whispered, bouncing his leg as he spoke. "You know there were twelve families that founded the city of Solvanar. Twelve vampire men who were given twelve mortal women to found the Solvanar bloodlines. However only seven families remain within the city. Five of the families have been banished for crimes against the Blood Concordance, never to be allowed back. Four of the families united together in the belief that they should forsake their vampire blood and willingly chose to leave the confines of the city. They believe that they should turn their back on their ancestors and thus become mortal throughout the years. That being a descendant of a vampire was akin to being evil. They established a city on the northern end of our land that is the only location where Solvanar families meet and where information passes to and from the city. Their attitudes have tempered some over the years but they are the bloodlines of the hunters. They have given themselves two missions; the first is to protect the sacred city from outside threats and the second is to eradicate all vampires. They call themselves righteous and believe they are doing the work of God.” He sighed again. “The other group the five family forbidden from the city... They are those that have fallen from the grace of the Solvanar. Their blood is dark and tainted. They are corrupt and greedy. It is to this group Moriarty belongs. Specifically to the lead family of which the patriarch..." John looked momentarily uncomfortable. "Is Lord Moran. Moriarty is a Rowan Solvanar. The Rowan are the royalty of the fallen, they believe that vampires and mortals are pets to be ruled. That we are the superior race and deserve to have slaves of mortal men and vampires. It is they who collect our kind and keep them as pets.” He growled lowly as he spoke and jumped up out of his chair to pace. Sherlock's eyes following him intently as he moved.
“You left me without a word about where you were going Sherlock. We discussed this.” John slowly wrapped his arms around the other and pulled him, so their bodies were flush.
. John caught his eyes as he was thinking those thoughts and blushed quite red. The predatory heat in Sherlock's gaze almost unmade John, but he managed to keep his calm. He nodded giving Sherlock the lead and followed him downstairs and out to the road to hail a cab. As they exited, neither of them speaking they both scanned the crowd of reporters around them. John was a bit behind Sherlock as he walked, letting a comfortable distance lapse between them before approaching the stopped cab. As he looked around he caught Kitty Riley standing there bold as brass. She tried to approach John but the look on his face must have stopped her as she suddenly just froze. She gave him a superior smile and then just waved as he followed Sherlock's silent command to get into the cab.
Mycroft pushed John down on the bed, their mouths working furiously together. The blood lust came roaring into John's awareness as Mycroft's eager hands found their way over his naked form. Soft whimpers and moans broke free of John's control as Mycroft easily took dominance over him. He let his hands roam over John's body as he claimed his mouth in heated kisses, repaying every moment of distance he'd been made to suffer during his bonding period with Sherlock. John moaned and arched into his touch, desperate for more. Desperate to feel how their bond hummed in his body so very differently than his bond with Sherlock. He push his mouth back against his sire's, moaning his name as he worked. He needed this, he needed touch.
"Ah, that it is." John felt himself blush, that wasn't the proper answer. A smirk hitched on Sherlock's mouth and John found himself overwhelmed by a powerful urge to kiss him. Sherlock's smirk became a smile and John had the suspicion he was reading his mind.
"So you're saying that I should correct this situation because it will make him forgive me?" Mycroft almost laughed at the incredulousness of the statement.
“Do you have a place to reside for the duration of your visit?” Mycroft asked before he could stop himself.
They arrived at the small cottage, which from the look of it was miles away from anyone else and Sherlock ushered John inside. John stood just inside the door way with his arms crossed until Sherlock finally stopped making trips to the car and locked the door. His attention fell again on the single black suitcase that Sherlock had brought along. It was their overnight bag, which meant it could successfully hold two changes of clothes each and half a suit case of whatever insane things Sherlock thought he needed.
"I'm already up, so don't worry." Lestrade grinned from the edge of the hallway, laughing as both of them blushed and started slightly. "He's spent hours practicing, you know. Mrs. Hudson used to get so angry. I think he had seven noise complaints from her."
- John was lying on the couch, exactly where Sherlock lay when he was bored or thinking on a case. He wanted to be where Sherlock had been. To maintain some sort of connection to him.
“You could have been a soldier, you are a warrior doctor. Willing to stand beside me against the rage of anyone, even your Sire.” John groaned and arched as Sherlock’s lips and teeth teased his sensitive thighs. “Loyal to me beyond sanity, loving me far beyond rationality, and willing to journey into the very mouth of hell to stay at my side.” He licked back up John’s legs, spending several minutes licking and sucking at the sensitive head of the others’ cock. It did not take long for John to shout Sherlock’s name and spill over, his entire body shaking as Sherlock came back up and kissed him again. He hovered there, knowing John was not sated and still wanted more. His eyes burning down into the others. “You are far more than I deserve and I shall destroy everything to keep you at my side.”
"Baker Street? He isn't there anymore." Mycroft's voice betrayed his slight amusement as Sherlock looked at him incredulously. "Why would he be? It's been two years. He's got on with his life."
has done nothing but cause a problem for both you and my brother from the very moment she first came into the picture." Mycroft said looking somewhat amused, but not betraying Sherlock's presence. He pulled out his cell phone and sent a text. "There, it is all arranged. My people will extract her after she has completed her task and she'll be given a nice comfortable life somewhere very far from here. I'm sure that is to your pleasure." Mycroft's smirk was far too all-knowing.
“I’ll send you everything we’ve got. Anything else?” Greg asked and was surprised when John spoke up. Three years and he'd still not gotten use to the fact that John was getting just as fast as Sherlock.
"You were hurt, I was putting Harry before you..." John offered but his voice was careful and guarded. Sherlock sighed and prepared himself to confess the one sin he would never be able to make up for.
"I should wring your neck." John said softly, a tear falling from his eye. "I should shake you and hit you. You've wrecked me, Sherlock." Sherlock moved to speak and John shook his hand, grabbing a handful of his hair and pulling gently, but with authority. "No, it's my turn." He growled softly. Sherlock could not stop the thrill that went through him. "But I can't. All I have wanted was for you to come back. For you step through that door so that I could tell you all the things I was too afraid of before. So that I could show you that we could have worked together. That we are together in this!" John's voice grew slightly louder but was still a whisper.
Sherlock flinched towards his pocket and John knew he was intending to withdraw that black case. He wanted desperately to run over, snatch the case and wrench it open. He wanted to childishly reveal the secret it contained.
you do it, but it's unprofessional Sherlock. You two can't be called out to crime scenes with him done up like that. It's been there for two weeks now and it's almost black, which means you're not letting it heal." He sipped his coffee. "That's how things worked before, when someone was marked as property. That's not how it works out here."
against him, and a deep breath that sent shivers through his body greeted John when he slowly felt himself come awake. He was surprised as he listened to the slow, rhythmic breathing. It was the first time in a very long time that he'd slept so soundly that nightmares hadn't woken him. He knew that pattern of breath before he even opened his eyes. He'd listened for it so many nights, trying to be sure Sherlock was actually asleep and not just pretending. He almost didn't want to get out of the bed, but he knew he needed to before his back started to cramp. He wondered what had happened during the night that had drawn him so close to Sherlock's body, but didn't pull away. It took him some time to realize an arm was thrown around him and he was cuddled against Sherlock. The embrace was so comfortable and warm, John couldn't be sure he'd ever be tempted to actually leave bed again. Sherlock shifted slightly, tightening his arm around John as he moved. John felt his breath catch.
"Everything is bright and loud, except for you." John whispered, his hand gently coming to rest on Mycroft's cheek, his actions somewhat child like.
"We're not going to be able to make it back to the cottage before this storm hits. We'd better head towards the Gardener's Cottage." John said loudly but sighed as Sherlock stalked off in the other direction and didn’t seem to hear him at all. John grabbed his arm. "Sherlock!"
"Sherlock, oh God..." He whispered, his nails digging into Sherlock's arms through his jacket. "When you do that..."
"Oh alright, I'll go... Apologize." Sherlock sighed, sulking as he did. But he paused and turned back, his look pure desire as he met John's eyes. "Incidentally how did you know about the icing?"
"John," Sherlock sighed and looked at him, clenching his fists slightly. "You shouldn't be this easy with me. I don't deserve..."
"I feel as if this is a dream." John said softly, pulling back but only a short bit away. "Rumors of your character, the things I have seen you say and do in court, and the feelings I see in the faces of your colleagues generally do not agree with this side of you." His tentatively reached up, his hand softly connecting with Mycroft's cheek. He smiled again.
"Yes. The Order has been a part of both of our families for generations. They like to keep their members close. When it came down to it though the issue was that the Pendergrass and Holmes families were much closer. It didn't help that Marcus clearly didn't approve of James even when we were young. That caused the families to drift apart." She sighed and leaned back. "I think the two of you may have met once before that summer here but you were very young. Maybe you were one Sherlock..." She hummed the words a bit. "But it was very brief. Marcus was convinced that James somehow managed to poison John and Harry. He didn't understand that it was just who you were." She sighed.
“Oh my love, please…” John groaned as Sherlock clawed into his chest. Sherlock trailed his mouth down, grabbing John’s hips hard when John bucked up in surprise. Sherlock’s tongue tracing the quivering ring of muscle he so longed to claim. “Sherlock!” John panted, clawing the bed hard.
it." John teased right back, allowing Sherlock to help him out of his own coat. "I mean it, please thank them Greg."
"Disadvantage," John said softly and their eyes met again. Greg felt the air sucked out of the room and looked to Mycroft who stood.
The entire purpose of this chapter is smut. SMUTTY SMUT SMUT! And shameless I might add. So if you don't want to read that, please skip this humble chapter. The epilogue will go up in the next day or so!
"You gave me a purpose when I had none." John whispered in reply, his voice cracking slightly. "Twice you have done the same thing. It's an unfair irony, but I would suffer it all again to be here with you now." He blushed knowing it was a sugary sweet sentiment even for himself.
"You would if you thought it would somehow help me.Now come on, you need to go back to bed." He tried to move him but John didn't budge.
"No, this is not how I would prefer to pass an evening." He answered honestly before correcting himself. "Though it is a most delightful party." The red velveteen outfit made those quicksilver eyes take on different hues as he looked into them and they were distracting him. He was caught in the man's eyes and felt himself sink into the moment as if nothing else existed. He felt like the forces of nature were slowly pulling them into a powerful orbit around each other. He looked up as Sherlock came to rest just in front of him, his eyes burning down into John's. John's breath was uneven in his chest and he felt a strong desire to give over to the care of this man.
"Because our fathers went to war basically." John paused and closed his eyes as the memory came back. "The afternoon after James was killed we'd both snuck out of our wings of the house and met in the drawing room. We were planning to run away because we weren't going to be allowed to be friends anymore. We overheard an argument downstairs and we crept out to the railing to listen. Our dads were shouting. My dad said that the only clear evidence was that Daddy Holmes had killed my Uncle. He screamed and screamed about it while Daddy Holmes simply screamed back that he had been up late with Mycroft and then asleep so his whereabouts were accounted for while the house staff couldn't account for my Dad's. Mycroft snuck up on us while we weren't paying attention and yanked us up by our collars before taking us in the drawing room. He'd just put together that we'd been out on the grounds the night before and he demanded to know what we saw. We told him everything about the man we saw attack Uncle James and he promptly paraded down and told his father we'd witnessed something. We were questioned by the police first together and then individually, but they didn't believe us at all. They tried to say we were lying and we were both rather upset because we knew if they didn't believe us we wouldn't get to stay friends. Dad interrupted the interview I had because I was describing the man who killed my Uncle and I didn't realize it then but I was describing my father. He locked me in my room and told me I was never to speak to Erik again. The next morning the Holmes started making preparations to leave. I shot out the tire of the car and tried to do a bunch of things to delay them leaving but it became clear it was rather inevitable. Mycroft guarded Sherlock's room like a watch dog so there was no way we could talk to each other. So the night before they were supposed to leave I snuck out of the house. I had decided I would go find clues to prove who committed the murder, but a torrential rain blew up and I got stranded near the gardener's cottage under this huge rock. Luckily the storm also kept the Holmes men from leaving because it was bad. One of the worst storms in years. I think I was gone for about a day and a half before anyone even noticed and Georgina was very worried. She seemed to have pieced together that I had been gone longer than just the next morning when I didn't show up to breakfast and in her panic she let it slip to Mycroft that I was missing. Sherlock overheard him telling his father and came to find me. He forced me to take his rain coat so we could walk back to the house and because of it he caught an awful cold. His family was forced to remain a week to wait for him to get better." He sighed, a tear in the corner of his eye.
Mycroft fell silent as he watched Sherlock reach over and tighten his grip on John’s hand just as John began to fall asleep. Sherlock followed John shortly after and Mycroft and Greg remained only to keep a watchful eye on the three of them, concern evident on both of their faces.
"I don't care, Lestrade." Sherlock looked at one of the pages and flicked it. It was then John realized he was looking over some form of the Kama sutra. He choked on tea again, noting the small smirk that caught the edge of Sherlock's lips. So Sherlock was purely showing off just for him.
Meaghan retreated from the room and set to her tasks. She prepared the horses and ensured several sun blocking cloaks were ready in the entrance to where the horses waited. She returned to the hall and waited hours without a cease tormented by the noises coming from the room. John had implicitly told her what to wait for but she was growing impatient and worried. She did not like the noises the mender was making, nor the supposed pleasure he was drawing from this moment. Just as she was fixing her mind to rush into the room and claim John away from her father she heard a shout and wrenched the door open. Her father was against the wall, John’s blood on his lips. John was almost blank, his eyes rolled back in his head. She could feel the arousal bleeding off her father.
“John!” He gasped his emotion clear in his voice. “Our John!” He exclaimed, fighting the emotion that was threatening to drown him.
In the hallway Mycroft leaned his face into Greg’s chest, not seeing the small smile that played out on his lover's face. Greg was only too happy knowing John was home safely. It meant the coven would be rebuilding but it also meant his love might relax more now. Might actually let himself enjoy living again. He also knew what Mycroft did not, that Sherlock may be coming along shortly. He did not want to speak that hope however as he remembered how distraught both John and Mycroft had been when last Sherlock was thought to be free. Anthea appeared beside them and hurried into the room, gently tending to John by ensuring he was dressed and warm. She combed out his hair, humming gently as she did and smiling as the mender sank more deeply to sleep. Mycroft was tempted to remain beside the mender; however Greg knew they needed to deal with Meaghan. He slowly led Mycroft back to his study, leaving his lover in his small reverie until they entered.
“What is it John?” Sherlock looked up slightly annoyed, but his annoyance dropped when he saw the look on John's face. Good finally information of use.
worked. It was so different. "You are better when you can touch, feel, smell, and taste it." His voice was very clear and his eyes were so determined Sherlock almost melted. He watched entranced as John shifted, stepping out of his trousers. Sherlock was astonished, he'd been so focused on John's face he hadn't seen him undo them. John sat back on the bed, now only in his boxers and blinked slowly as his eyes focused on Sherlock's again. "So study me." Just like that John blew open Sherlock's desire and shorted out his mind.
"Oh but you are." Mycroft purred and kissed over the back of his neck. John groaned, falling back against Mycroft's chest.
emotions, John. They're dangerous. They cause failures, mistakes, and make people falter. It terrifies me that I already have let them sway me so much that
"Thank you." Sherlock paced faster. "So for the second issue. The web is tightening and it is going to break before long. We need to return to Baker Street."
“I could have saved her!” John shouted, shaking in anger. “If I had…” Tears fell down his cheeks as his rage broke free.
"So Captain John," John's voice cracked but he took a slow deep breath and recovered, "Wrote back to Prince Erik," Sherlock's brow furrowed and he looked at John with an intense stare. He'd never received a reply and that was why he...  John was suddenly talking again. "Prince Erik, I understand your feelings and shall guard these as if they were my own flesh. As I swore to do with anything you entrusted me with. I do hope you still have
"Thank you Jacob, you have given me a lot to think about. I appreciate it." He motioned to the door.
"Sherlock, what are you playing at? You're never a gracious host like this, usually you're all wrapped up in the arm chair, your collar popped up and an angry look on your face." Lestrade said suddenly and all of them laughed. "Donovan's coming later yea, so if you're playing any pranks let's get it out of the way now."
"No, I didn't." Sherlock's voice was soft and full of emotion. "There was a specific event that Moriarty prepared for that didn't happen." John ran his hand over his face.
"Don't they already?" They laughed for a few minutes before the comfortable silence settled again, but pregnant with the weight of the unanswered question.
"Thus allowing our John to hear Sherlock speaking to you without knowledge he is nearby." Anthea nodded. "I shall do as you ask." She stood and retreated from the room.
“It is a letter from John.” He flinched when both men turned their gazes on him and it felt as though the force of the sun shone on him.
“Be that as it may Mr. Watson we had an arrangement. You’ve broken it; perhaps you fail to understand the seriousness before you?” Mycroft’s tone was very dark and John made a mental note that pissing Mycroft off was a very bad idea.
"If you're asking me to share your bed, the answer is yes." It could have been an innocent statement, but it wasn't. John watched as Sherlock's eyes burned into his, taking in how John was suddenly open to their desires.
Sherlock stalked over to the couch and all but shoved the dossier out of John’s hands, grabbing the lapels of his shirt and kissing him as he pushed him back further into the cushions. John groaned, and his hands scrabbled to find purchase on the other, groaning when he suddenly had a lapful of Sherlock. Sherlock’s mouth was relentless against him, his tongue plunging deep inside the other as if trying to devour him. John could do nothing but submit, the noises coming from him wanton and feral as he continued to be ravaged by the other. Suddenly Sherlock pulled back and stood, leaving John in what felt like a vacuum. He put one hand in his hair and rushed over to the bookshelf where he had meticulously copied a few of the previous cases Gregory had asked him for assistance on as a consultant. John grumbled with displeasure as Sherlock pulled away but recognized the look on his face.
John had enough time to register Sherlock coming towards him before that blue scarf wrapped around his eyes, cutting off his vision. He struggled a bit against the bindings but moaned as Sherlock pressed light, fluttering touches over his legs and stomach.
"No, I am afraid my Uncle has no one to spare and I am considered so hopeless by most others no one will take me." He admitted easily, looking down.
"And you? What could you possibly want from him?!" Sherlock raged, grabbing Mycroft by the shoulders.
." Mycroft's voice was soft but stern in his ear, Sherlock almost sighing relief as his brother removed his dressing robe and pushed John onto his back on the bed. John was panting and whined when he was pulled away from Sherlock but groaned as Mycroft's arousal grew and became clear in his eyes.
It was almost too much really for Sherlock in this moment. The disappointment in Hamish's face that morning, the fact that John had still been keeping something secret from him, and the fact that ever since this case had reopened John seemed on edge all seemed to point to some failing Sherlock had made. It reminded him that he'd never truly stopped to think about the consequences of his work. He never had. John's life had already been in danger countless times because of this and now here he was, afraid again. It made something inside his chest want to claw its' way free, his eyes carefully focused on his husband as he tried to use his brain to think through the problem his heart was having. John would never ask Sherlock to give up his cases and Sherlock never intended to, but there had to be a way to keep working but make sure his family was safe. He sighed softly as his attention slowly came back into the room.
"Ignore her." Sherlock hissed out of the side of his mouth. Slowly sliding his hand to rest on the middle of John's back. It was a clear motion and it made John shiver.
“Bad timing,” Sherlock chided but kissed him all the same. He moved to say something when both their phones went off. They both looked confused, knowing that Mycroft had just left and ripped their phone from their pockets in haste.
John arched and almost released from the sensation but Sherlock bit down on his shoulder hard. The harsh pain keeping him from tumbling over the edge. He whined and groaned but Sherlock refused to let up, instead pounding their hips together with a punishing pace. John could hardly breathe. He could see nothing but his lover, his mind completely narrowed to focus only on Sherlock. Sherlock growled deeply, the noise sending shivers of terror through John. The terror seized in his chest but he was too weak to do anything to stop Sherlock. He was completely at Sherlock's mercy and was a whimpering mess as Sherlock continued to pound away into him. Without any warning Sherlock arched up and orgasmed, sending John over edge. John's body collapsed, utterly exhausted, underneath his still bucking lover. Sherlock growled down at him, his eyes pure black, his attention drifting over the bite marks on his neck.
"Sherlock it is one night once a month! I am not asking to go stay with him for endless amounts of time!"
Darkness weighs on John like never before and he knows time is running out. Old enemies have resurfaced and the only way to protect Sherlock might cost him everything.
John wouldn't command his troops so efficiently. Just John wouldn't stand so firm and straight ready to charge into battle, and
"Jacob's downstairs. A servant came with him from the main house and said Georgina required him to visit with you two before she gives him full safety."
"It's good to know you're still attracted to me after my miserable showing last night." John's smirk didn't slip as he got up to get dressed, wearing only his boxers.
“Oh no, I ensured he was convicted for the crimes and helped persuade his coven to destroy him.” Sherlock’s grin was almost too much, and John found himself laughing at it.
“Then he shall be punished for this! This is an outrage! I instructed them to allow only you to care for her. They have gone against my wishes and orders!” The Duke shouted, looking up as two sets of footsteps echoed into the hall.
"I understand." He completely closed down and moved to pull away, not looking up to meet John's eyes again. John was just able to grab Sherlock's hand with his own, but the pain of the effort was tremendous and flashed over his face.
*creeps in timidly and wave* Hi! I am SO, SO sorry this chapter has taken 100 years to come out. I had this great plan of writing a little each day and the world just sort of slapped me and said no. But, I have not and WILL NOT abandon this story!
fascinating I'm going to have to tie you up and ravage you senseless." John groaned loudly, trying to grab Sherlock and prolong the kiss but he was already out of John's reach.
They were still laughing two minutes later when Mrs. Hudson made her way up the stairs. She paused in the door way, grinning as she watched them.
"I... How can I be sure you haven't poisoned it?" John tried to use humor, but his voice didn't follow suit and it fell flat. A small smile tugged at Sherlock's lips but faded quickly.
So every time I say I think we're headed out of Tudor England the boys bring me another plot bunny. Clever bastards.
"What are you…" Sherlock was cut off as Mycroft launched into his explanation. Mycroft could not believe how completely oblivious his brother was being.
“I thought I had heard Sherlock return.” She offered, motioning to the tray she’d brought with her. She looked thoughtful as a shadow passed over the Mender’s face.
Sherlock and John were not seen for three days following their return home. Mycroft was content to ignore their absence until he began to feel a strange sort of worried feeling filling his mind when he paused to think about his fledgling. He sent Anthea to them but she was turned away repeatedly.
He had fed before. He had even experienced arousal when he fed but it was nothing like the heat blooming in his groin now. This ache was so very different and new. It was possessive, it was dark. He wanted to tie John up and claim him for days before draining him to the point of death and rebirthing him into the life of a vampire - to be his for all eternity. It was almost frightening to him, he had never wanted something this desperately in all his life. The two of them ground their hips together until John shouted.
"What did Daddy do?" Sherlock asked Hamish, who was watching him from where he rested carefully on John.
"Sherlock lay down." Mycroft commanded. He picked up the oil and pressing himself back behind John, positioned him over his lover. "Here, prepare him." Mycroft purred in his ear, slicking oil over his fingers before guiding John's hand down and removing his own. John gasped and almost lost his focus when Mycroft's slick finger pressed against him. Sherlock whimpered as John groaned, their lust passing easily between them via their bond. John understood, Mycroft was going to show him how to properly do this. He took a shaking breath and gently pushed a finger against the tight, quivering ring of muscle that Sherlock seemed keen to hide.
"Not out here." John grunted, trying to stay rational but an ache building in his groin. Bedroom," John ordered and Sherlock teetered on the edge of his own rationality. He wanted to ravage John exactly where he was, but he conceded. Getting up he strode into the bedroom without hesitation pulling his shirt off on the way.
"It's true. I heard you in that suite in the hospital. I came in when you two slept and watched how you were so lightly sleeping, ready to jump at a moment's notice if either of your loves were in discomfort or pain. You are a brilliant father."
"My little fledgling, my John..." Mycroft whispered softly, pressing kisses over his cheeks and forehead. "Sherlock is fine. It seems he did not warn you regarding his brooding behavior. My brother likes to solve puzzles and sometimes when he finds a puzzle he cannot easily solve he goes into his mind and tries to solve it there. He will not move or eat or respond to anything we say or do for quite some time. We must simply wait for him to come back to us."
"My brother will take him home." Sherlock said suddenly. Mycroft looked alarmed and John looked confused. "I will remain here and see if we can sort out who attempted to ruin Elizabeth's joy." His voice was firm. "Lord Moran would you assist me in repairing this dinner party?" He asked it firmly and Sebastian easily understood.
“A memory?” John asked softly, almost desperately. Sherlock turned to him, now aware of the tension and pain hidden on John’s face.
“Rough housing…” John turned to Sherlock as they walked out, the little boy sucking on a sugar free lollipop.
John worked in the kitchen for a little bit, making some tea and sandwiches before bringing them out to the table. He went back into the kitchen to clean up and lost himself staring out the window for a minute. His thoughts turning to the night before, to what Jacob had said about John and Hamish being in danger. It was true, John had seen the shadow of the familiar on the property. He could feel the prickle on his skin that meant danger was only too close to them again. He worried for their son and for his husband for a moment before he reminded himself that anyone stupid enough to try to harm either of them would bring a wrath down on themselves that no one could escape. He shuddered as he thought what Sherlock would be like if someone captured him now or Hamish. Greg and Mycroft had given him full accounts of what Sherlock had been like after Kitty had kidnapped him, even though they knew it was going to happen. He sighed and returned to the others, picking up one of the file folders and flicking through it almost angrily.
? Suddenly John was speaking again. "So whatever he did that made you jump destroyed me. I didn't want to go on without you. Without the bloody work. I got a new flat and a new job, but I didn't try to date anyone. Then one day our nurse quits, for no reason. Just gets up and walks out. The next day Mary was there and she looked me right in the eyes and asked me how I was. And she
"Sherlock!" John's tone was warning, he found the oil they kept beside the bed and coated his fingers, slipping two inside Sherlock and gently toying with him. He kept pressure firm and even on Sherlock's pulsing member, not letting him move to create the friction that would allow him release. Sherlock groaned and thrashed until John coated his own length with oil and sank deep inside of him.
"I apologize for my reaction, I am not sure why he inspires such darkness in my heart. He was never before so dark in our interactions." John whispered.
Before John really had a grasp on things they were back at 221B and the doors closed on the reporters screaming questions at them outside. Just inside the door John grabbed Sherlock and threw him into the wall gently, kissing him with intense fervor. Sherlock grinned and broke the kiss, watching John carefully.
"You're getting off on this aren't you?" Sherlock demanded, picking up his thankfully unburned toast. "Pretending to be a Daddy and running off with us to solve a crime." His eyes sparkled.
And so it was. Within a few years Anthea, Sherlock, Mycroft, John, and George left the manor house in England and took up residence in Germany. They resided there for twenty years before Mycroft determined it was become a bit too dangerous and he directed them to France. There they remained for the remainder of the fifty years Mycroft had alotted for them to be away from England. All three of the men began to miss home desperately.
“Where is my husband?” James asked one of the servants who was relieving him of his burdens, the younger Sebastian growling softly at the term.
The scene they found made Mycroft want to turn away Elizabeth, so he paused for a moment to enjoy the scene. Sherlock was lying, fully clothed, in bed with John nestled against his chest. John was looking up at him, his eyes half lidded in comfort as they whispered softly back and forth. Whatever words Sherlock was saying were soothing the mender who snuggled in closer. Mycroft enjoyed the sincere and earnest smile that bloomed on his brother's face as John sought out physical comfort for the first time since his ordeal and sighed that he must interrupt them.
“Oh Mrs. Hudson, you know Sherlock would go insane. I don’t think the walls could handle it.” They both laughed before she returned to the others.
"It was but he disappeared shortly after that. By then Sherlock and you had reunited and Harry told me how she'd convinced Sherlock to let her repay you two with a child. She was so proud to be able to bear you a son, to bring little Hamish into this world." John's eyes were glassed over and he looked down.
"Yes, I am afraid both of you have gotten ill. You two shouldn't have fallen overboard!" Sherlock grinned as Hamish gave a weak laugh. He stood as Greg knocked on the door.
“My Lord,” Meaghan spoke softly from the door. “The carriage is prepared for you and Lord Moriarty to travel to Summer. Word has arrived that your envoy is there.” She bowed. Sebastian stood, shoving himself a few more times into John’s body before finding his release and letting the mender collapse on the floor. John trembled, staying still as he did.
When they arrived in their chambers Sherlock had no sooner bolted the door before John had pushed him into it, their mouths coming back together with a violent heat. Sherlock tried to tug John’s shirt off only to have his hands pinned against the door at his sides. John hummed as he moved and began to nip at Sherlock’s neck, enjoying the soft moans his mate was trying to contain. Sherlock nearly shouted when John’s knee brushed against his awakening erection and did shout when John bit down on his neck the second time.
“Whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, you both are still members of my Coven and thus under my purview. Additionally, he is still my fledgling and thus my responsibility.” He tightened his grip on his walking stick, his displeasure at Sherlock’s antics barely overriding his concern for them.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Just wait." Mycroft promised. He looked down at Sherlock who nodded eagerly. Mycroft handed him the oil and he prepared himself while Mycroft prepared John.
"Please Lady Anthea, I entreat you to move John to speak with me. I have wronged him greatly and I need to see him. Please." Anthea felt how the woman shook and helped her up, noting she now had a Solvanaar necklace around her neck.
being powerless. No one will ever take you from me again." His voice and eyes darkened slightly as he spoke and John actually moaned softly. He knew that rationally he should be concerned about that possessiveness, but as always it inspired an altogether different feeling in his body. Suddenly the room was full of heat and desire and was threatening to drown the two of them in the sea of it all.
“It is nothing.” He whispered, struggling to try to get free. He froze when Sherlock’s lips were suddenly on his, their bodies pressed so tightly together as Sherlock took what he felt was his. John was gasping, trying to struggle away as his grief overwhelmed him and tears began to flow. Sherlock however refused to let up, kissing John until there was no breath left in his body.
"You were intentionally misinformed, my Lord. My sister and I were twins however as it was I was older by a short while." John continued smiling. "I know you are not afraid of my heritage as a Solvanar, Mycroft. It is not my birth that frightens you because we both know that my birth makes me ripe for your clan. The blood hunger that comes to the sons of the Solvanar, particularly the Oaken Solvanar is what drew me to Sherlock in the first place." He spoke softly, with focus.
The door led straight into a living room that was a large open room. Straight across from the entrance was a pair of sliding glass doors that lead out onto a veranda and into the garden John had noticed previously. To the right end of the house was a large formal dining room that looked out over the pond. The kitchen offset from the dining room was much larger than the one at 221, including room for a smaller dining table. In fact it was almost as big as the living room and kitchen combined at Baker Street. The living room opened up again to the left, including a fire place in the corner. A hallway branched directly off their left from the living room leading first to a bathroom, then to a room clearly designed as an office. The hallway branched to the left just beyond the office and led to the first bedroom, while taking the hallway straight on lead to the master suite complete with a large private bathroom. John barely had time to register all of that before the breath was sucked out of his chest. His jaw clenched.
It was a deadly and dangerous thing to do, Sherlock had not fed in three days testing himself and his hunger. He also felt the powerful heat of arousal sweep through his body as this man so easily sank into the knowledge of what he was without fear. How John simply gave himself over to the inescapable truth that Sherlock himself had been avoiding for six years. He slowly sank his teeth in, growling deliriously as John's essence poured into his mouth, John moaning under him. He drank only a little, not so much as he wished, but enough that he would be able to learn everything about John as he rested during the next day. When he pulled back, that ruby essence gleaming on his lips he panted. John groaned.
"The hunger is inside of you, born into you by your birth..." He whispered darkly. "Let it free. Let it find a home in the truth you are desperate to feel." He coaxed. Sherlock let his touch flutter over John's body as John weakly latched on to Mycroft's wrist and drank slowly but steadily.
"I'm fine Sherlock, it's just a cold..." John protested but he sneezed and sighed. He leaned back closing his eyes.
.” John was definitely defensive but his tone was soft. His eyes firm and focused as he stood defiantly in the face of danger.
"Yes. The sunlight will weaken you for a time early on in your pregnancy. It is a complication due to the vampire blood your child carries. She will be fine, as will you."
"I want to know. What do you see, Sherlock? What do you feel?" John's voice was low. It was dark and deep with desire. His eyes still closed as he waited expectantly for an answer. Sherlock grunted with sheer pleasure as John
A wedding that aside from the dress that required ten attendants, a groom who looked angry instead of pleased, too many dignitaries to remember, and enough wasted expense would never be looked upon fondly by anyone in attendance. Especially not by either of the Holmes brothers, whom were they given the choice would have opted for a leisurely day at home. However with John so innately involved in the preparing of the event they had no choice but to attend in order to support him. They certainly could not see John go alone to any social outing that might leave him a victim of Moriarty's devices. Though they were sure to voice their displeasure, loudly and repeatedly. The Holmes family was tentative at best with the groom following his attempt to poison them all. The punishment had been slight, at best, but Elizabeth had beseeched the Holmes men to forgive him and they had grudgingly agreed. Which was why the brothers stood, backs rigidly pressed to the wall, beside an equally grumpy Sebastian Moran as they watched John dance with the bride.
is here and suddenly your attention is fully removed from the man who almost killed himself because of longing for you. Instead you turn your attention back to a woman who preferred you to believe she played with your feelings! And look what happened! " Mycroft's tone was actually just as dark as Sherlock's, the tension growing so tight that both Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade feared an actual physical fight would break out.
"Not 'just' John," Sherlock sat up straighter as his eyes locked with John's and the words just effortlessly flowed from his mouth. "Never just John," His tone was soft and full of emotion but his eyes sparkled with their normal enthusiasm for something he considered to be entertaining. "
Realization dawned on Sherlock's face and John was surprised that he hadn't snapped at him yet. His eyes slowly starting to return to normal as he began to come back into the room.
"I hate it." John said grumpily. "It's overly starched, I'm guessing Mrs. Hudson was crying while she ironed it. I miss my jumper. I'm cold." John hadn't meant it as a complaint but it was the truth. He suddenly felt the weight of something on his shoulders looking up to see that Sherlock had removed his jacket and placed it around John. "Sherlock..." He blushed slightly.
"Lord Moran will be present as he has been Moriarty's guardian for the majority of his life. Please do not make a fool of us." Sherlock's gaze hardened.
“Where is he? I can sense him… There!” Sherlock smirked with pride as he wrenched the door to the room open. John flinched, but did not pull himself from under the blankets. Sherlock waltzed into the room, intent on pulling the blankets aside but froze when he saw the large painting over the bed. His energy changed quickly and suddenly anger filled the room, making John shiver. The painting was of John and Sherlock on their wedding day, smiling and serene in their bliss. “What trick is this?!” He demanded, ripping the blankets away from John and growling angrily at him.
“Then keep quiet.” Sherlock smirked. He clawed into John’s hair and lathed attention over the purple spot on his neck, listening to him groan quietly. The spot was almost permanently purple.
“Your brother took you from me once and I shall not let it happen again!” James growled, leaning forward. “You are mine!”
"Come in." Mycroft called, looking up with clear surprise as John entered. It was easy to see the tears on his face, Mycroft wanted to comfort him but he refused to do so. He could not allow himself to feel this sentiment for John. It would be better to remain distant. He had hoped the lack of touching and response he'd given the mender over the last few months would be enough to finally push him away. Judging by the look on his face, that was not the case. "What are
"After we have had rest." He cupped John's cheek in his hand, forcing John to meet his eyes. "I am sorry John, I owe you a great number of apologies for not warning you."
"What?" John panted, his mind still trying to catch up to the moment. Another smack, this time on the other leg that made him whimper and shout. "Master what are you doing!?" He demanded, tugging harder at the bonds.
. He moved quickly and downed the next sniper, noting that Jacob had taken down the other two. He had to get down and somehow convince John that this was all a bluff.
. If you wish to stop simply do so." He promised as he closed his eyes and could not bite back a soft moan.
rather pleasing to the eye, he conceded, noting that he would like to explore the reactions his brother made in response to certain stimuli. Perhaps he could compare them to John's. Before he could progress much farther in his musings however Mycroft's mouth was on his, his tongue plunging into explore the cavern of his mouth when he moaned in surprise. Sherlock flowed back as Mycroft pressed him down into the bed, their mouths moving furiously against one another. Sherlock's mind blanked as he clawed into his brother's shoulders, one hand moving to brace against the headboard. He froze, his entire body going rigid and Mycroft opened his eyes with confusion and concern. Sherlock pulled his hand out from under the pillow both of them growling darkly as they realized his hand had tightened around something metal.
"It is Lord Moran." John responded and Sherlock tensed anew. They reluctantly pulled themselves up out of bed. He watched John as he hesitantly moved around the room, seemingly quite concerned about their guest.
Sherlock pushed John down hard on the bed, ignoring his whimpers of pain. His mouth and teeth all over his chest and shoulders. His eyes growing darker by the moment. It hurt but John felt pleasure more strongly. His mind seemed to shiver and tremble before the pain simply began to fade. The pleasure just crowded into his mind and forced all the sensations of pain away. It forced everything away until he could think of nothing save Sherlock. Sherlock who was lost in his own primal nature from a mixture of a lack of feeding, brooding jealousy, and pure desire for the writhing man before him. He was not intentionally giving into this darker side of himself but his control over himself was faltering quickly. His aura bore down on John's fighting for submission just as he pressed touches and kisses all over John's body demanding physical submission as well. Demanding that John submit in every way to him. John whimpered and moaned, his entire body flooded with fire and desperation. His cock ached between them, still trapped for the moment in his trousers. It did not take long however for Sherlock to rip them away, leaving him utterly exposed and trembling.
"You two are lucky My had to leave, he was raging this morning about how irresponsible the two of you are." Greg stood and yawned. He narrowed his eyes slightly as he realized John's cheek was slightly bruised with a small cut. "Who hit you in the face, John?" He moved over quickly looking at John's cheek. John pulled away.
." His voice had been a guarded whisper, to John it was clear that his mind was in a great number of places all at once. The statement made something inside John's chest purr with satisfaction but at the same time it confused and scared the hell out of him.
Then he was gone. John strained his other senses, trying to hear or sense where Sherlock was in the room but he couldn't. The carpet muffled his footsteps and he'd removed everything that might make noise. John tensed, his body straining to prepare for the next thing but there was nothing. No indication of what might happen next. Sherlock smirked and gently ran the riding crop down John's sternum, listening to the purely indecent moan that came from his lips. It was followed almost immediately by a grunt and whimper as the leather snapped down close to his nipple. He was already wet, his cock aching for touch. Sherlock felt his own body begging for him to give in, to reunite their flesh - but he wanted to make John beg and right now John was still being the staunch soldier. Another smack and another deeply primal moan, brought John's words back.
There was no haste in this moment, only the two of them and all the ages of the world. The two of them were beginning to feel more like themselves, so haste was no longer necessary. The ethereal whispers of the bonding state giving way to the earthy mortal realm. Sherlock set a desperately slow, feverish pace; their mouths struggling to stay together as their breath grew ragged and heavy. Sherlock locked his hands with John's, pushing them up towards the head of the bed, using his own body to lift John's hips slightly and change how he was pushing inside him. John shouted in his mouth and groaned, desperate for the release Sherlock was denying him. Sherlock kept John pinned under him, building the fire inside their bodies steadily but slowly until hours after dark had completely fallen they finally crashed over the edge. John panted for breath, silence descending around them and their eyes locked and burning together. Both of them utterly boneless and wrecked from such a powerful release. Sherlock smoothed gentle kisses over John's face, eyes, and mouth apologizing for tormenting him but not really meaning it. Anthea gave them an hour to recover before loudly knocking on the door.
“It would have been fine if you hadn’t started speaking German!” Sherlock grunted reading John's thought right off his face, pushing the shirt away now as well.
“I had hoped you’d return today.” Sherlock smiled, it was the smile that made James’ burn to claw and bite him until it disappeared; the smile that said ‘I can tell everything you have done,’ the one that made James burn with hate and desire like nothing else. “You had a favorable trip, they provided you the answer you wanted and even offered you your own manor back in England.” He offered quietly, making James growl, His smirk never fading as he sipped his blood.
