Tony laid Harley down on the couch, rushing to his boy’s room to grab his stuffed bear before bringing it back to lay next to his pup. Then he walked into the hallway, trying to call that jerk and cursing when it went straight to voicemail.
“It’s a lot of things, actually. Adjusting to a new life with a celebrity billionaire as a parent, a private school with snotty fuck-boys and bitches who pick on me for being both gay and the child of gays – oh but not really because they’re ‘
“Yeah, cub. It’s me,” Barnes said, lowering his arms and squatting down as the girl slowly approached him.
“It’s in no way your fault sweetheart, it's Clint's for dropping my son. And at some point in the near future, I’ll need you to teach me that move, okay?” Steve asked with a smile, only turning to leave when she smiled in return. “Alright Petey, let’s get you an ice pack and maybe a cookie or two, okay?” he cooed at his son as the sweet boy nodded with a fist scrubbing his eye in sadness.
And since he did, he released his prisoner at nine seconds, ready for the pup to pop back up again. Instead Harley just stayed on his back, wiping his eyes from happy tears and gazing up at Steve.
“Holy shit,” Bucky breathed out, not even knowing they made paintball guns like that. He’d never been more turned on by the blonde, who was looking absolutely smug as he walked over and stood in front of Buck.
Steve kissed his cheek again when he got in the elevator, using the time it took to walk to the kitchen to hum an old melody to the boy. Well, technically younger than him, but he had discovered Miles Davis when he woke up from the ice and had bought all of his records.
“Come on James,” Clint said with a smile, grabbing Buck’s hand and leading the two out of the apartment before adding, “bye asshole!”
“Now that Barney’s back, where do you sleep?” Clint couldn’t help blinking for a few seconds at the teen’s ability to switch from sexy talk to mundane topics so quickly.
He took the opportunity to shower before grabbing the box of photo albums and home videos, showing up at the mansion about half an hour later.
Peter knew that was true, technically, but he couldn't control the anger welling up inside. He hadn't talked to him about it, how weird he'd been acting, because just when he thought he should the man was back to his old lovey dovey goofy self. He was a wonderful man, and thinking otherwise always made Peter feel guilty. Wade had enough insecurities, doubting him would only add whatever strain Peter was making up in his head.
There were four beer pong tables set up, seemed like a tournament of some kind going on that had Buck growling. If he were allowed to drink that evening, he would’ve dominated that game. As he kept walking, he had to side-step a fight that broke out, checking for Clint as promised before heading upstairs to find a bathroom.
Steve kissed him when he finished talking, getting a laugh out of Tony before the two settled in for a nap.
He took a moment to adjust her under his grip, tightening one arm around her waist as she grabbed a pillow to bury her face in preparation. This was beyond humiliating for an almost eighteen year old and she felt shame burn deep in her gut. She was wearing her long pajama bottoms over her underwear – and he pulled both down to her thighs in one quick yank.
Kept smiling quietly until Tony finished and dried off his hands, the blonde moving to kiss the back of his neck.
“Sam,” she began, turning him to let her see Kimberly who had stopped a few feet away. “This is my…birth mother. Kimberly. Kimberly? This is my Uncle Sam. Sam can I have a few minutes with her?” she gave her best puppy eyes at him. He immediately caved, sending a quick glare to Kimberly before stepping several feet away – facing away from them.
“I love you baby, and your Uncle Steve loves you, and your Nana and your mom loved you too. Never forget that, okay?” he asked, smiling back at her as she threw herself into his arms. He hugged her tight, placing a kiss on the top of her head.
He stared at the note in one hand and noticed his cell phone had materialized in the other. He looked back and forth between the two for several moments longer.
“You said you hurt your ribs, you have those below your breasts as well as behind them. You are obviously injured and I’m a paramedic–”
“He never wanted kids, did he ever tell you that?” she asked him with watery eyes. “He told me when I was younger, said ‘being an uncle was enough for him’ when I asked about getting cousins. And then life threw us all a curve ball and he ended up stuck with me.”
She looked to Steve, expecting a laundry list of things he had to do, but was surprised as he  turned from chastising Tony to quietly flipping the pancakes on the griddle, waiting for her to continue.
“You were with Carlton?” she guessed quietly. He startled at that, looking at her incredulously as she hit the nail on the head.
Tony found out he was pregnant when he was sixteen, just a few months shy of his seventeenth birthday.
Yeah, drinking and driving was horrendous. And she was telling the truth when she said she’d never do it again – only thinking about her Dad dying because of it.
“Omega?” Bucky asked as he gently sat on the blonde’s lap, like there weren’t three other people in the room. They did that often, acted like there was no one else in the world but them.
“I heard that James,” Pappy barked as he and Harley came back over, with the pup's hands now covered in white tape. “You’ll be the practice dummy Harley works on. Come on, in the ring you two.” Steve chuckled when his brother whined at that before obediently heading into the ring.
“Alright, well, you have the money to bail him out…so,” Tony laughed as he brought her back into his embrace, heart burning with love for this girl. “He’s lucky it’s Steve and not me.”
"Cause I'm the best," Miles said as if it was obvious as he moved to sit next to his sister and get his own food.
“Buck, Vivienne was your handler. A romantic relationship should have never begun between you two. It’s an abuse of power. Not only that, but she has been secretly drugging you and...well she hasn’t been very nice to Daci when you’re not around…”
“No, you don’t. Because your mommy and I decided a long time ago we wouldn’t spoil you. Spoiled boys don’t help their Papa clean up in the kitchen without being asked. They don’t ask their Daddy to donate some of their toys to the boys and girls in the hospital. Or only ask for animal shelter donations for their birthday. Spoiled little boys are mean and they don’t appreciate what they have in life. That’s not you baby. You are the sweetest, kindest and most good boy I know.”
“Sweet! You guys have fun and stay out of trouble,” she said with a wink before leaving to go get ready.
“Yeah well, you’re more important than work. And I thought you could use a cuddle bug right now,” the brunette said as he put his tablet on the nightstand to turn to the blonde. Steve, for once in immediate agreement with his husband’s plans, curled up behind the man to spoon him. His big arms wrapped around the smaller man’s body like an octopus.
“I said Tony was hot, not that I wanted to fuck him!” Nat and Sam both rolled their eyes and turned their attention back to Steve.
“I love you too, Tony. So much,” his Alpha purred, kissing his hand before standing up to kiss the Omega on his lips. “Go to sleep, Omega. I’m going to go check on Peter and we’ll all be back home in a few days, okay?”
“Oh Steven, that was definitely not the case…” Tony purred as the two smiled warmly at each other. Steve opened his mouth to ask him out when they were interrupted by Tony’s son approaching them.
“You just wait, jerk,” Steve quipped back with a mock glare before turning around to focus his attention on cooking. They sat in comfortable silence for a bit before he couldn’t take it anymore. “So talk to me, what’s bothering you?” he asked, taking a chance to bring it up first. He could tell it paid off when he heard the brunette sigh behind him.
“Well, mister adult should know better than to attempt to find a loop hole in a legally binding contract…”
“Yes but I have no idea how to find that man’s number! I don’t even know his first name,” Rhodey said as he continued walking around.
“You know that people who bully others for being gay are almost always just ashamed of their own gay selves?” his sister said condescendingly. This earned more laughs from the crowds as the two tall jocks had matching red and angry faces.
He considered turning the offer down, but another wave of exhaustion hit him as he finished the delicious treat. He looked at his kid, who was currently rummaging through Rhodey’s duffle bag and pulling just about everything out. Board games, drawing pads, coloring pencils, play-doh, legos, markers, coloring books… they came prepared. He smiled at the sight before him. Bruce and Sam had also begun claiming various things, arguing with Emerson as she stubbornly insisted they
“Steve?” Tony asked, still waking up and getting his eyes familiar with his surroundings. The blonde turned back to his husband to reach down to give him a kiss in greeting. The genius hummed in approval before looking around the room.
“Pop,” his oldest said to get his attention, “please make sure Dad doesn’t give them too much sugar.”
“You...are...too...late,” she gasped out, eyes changing from fear to confidence even as they began to bulge from her skull.
“These aren’t weapons…” Daci said quietly, shooting a tiny arrow for emphasis and sticking it dead center on the plasma tv.
So the next morning when she was the first one up - since her Pop was still on mission and again, she slept very little - she made breakfast and coffee; knowing her Dad would probably sleep in. Her brothers helped bring her back to the present.
"Oh we're not going to Asgard," Tony began as he moved his cup to lean across the island, "in two months, we're going to Wakanda." Emerson shrieked and jumped off her stool, startling the little boy next to her. Steve smiled as she danced around and ran to hug the super soldier in gratitude.
The teen eventually nodded in response, sitting up straighter when she realized she would finally be able to talk to someone about this.
“Jo,” Tony said gently, causing her to look up at him; blinking as tears spilled down her cheek. She sat forward only slightly, Steve a little jealous of her actually listening to Tony.
They decided to watch a movie until she woke up, the three cuddled close in the living room as Peter made his way over to sit on Steve’s lap. The blonde looked incredibly surprised and happy for the change in seating, shooting a glance at Tony who was practically melting at the sight. He leaned against Steve, unbelievably happy with his life in this moment.
“Yeah. With alcohol. And a good chunk of the school. Not to brag, but I throw pretty epic ragers, Rogers,” Tony said smugly and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle at his confidence.
“I’ll get started on the soup. Let me know if you need anything, bear,” the Alpha said as he stood up off the couch, putting the remote within reaching distance of the pup before walking towards the kitchen.
“Tony, come on, you can’t tell me you haven’t had second thoughts about choices in your life - no matter how fleeting they are-”
“Sorry,” Clint muttered as he stood up, stopped from walking away when the coach put a hand on his shoulder.
“We literally fucked on it yesterday but go off I guess,” Clint sassed as Barney's face scrunched up in disgust.
“I brought an olive branch! And by olive branch I mean Olive Garden breadsticks!” In an instant, Clint was up off the couch and opening the door. His heart melted when James chuckled at his speed, holding a bag in one hand...while his other hand was behind his back.
“They won’t let me in to see Dad,” she tattled, too overwhelmed with the anxiety of seeing him safe and alive to care how whiny she sounded.
“He’s an innocent baby. It’s not his fault his Daddy is a dummy,” Howard said as he shot Tony a smirk. The teen deflated a little in contentment, the fear that his parents would want nothing to do with either of them slowly fading away. “With the worst taste in Alphas.”
“M---TOO---OLD” Peter managed between fits of laughter. Steve’s eyes widened, “are you serious? Still with the age jokes?”
He pulled his phone out to send the text and it didn’t even make it back in pocket before he got a ding in response. ‘Pick me up at ten’ was all it said. Bucky needed new friends.
"Makes sure it looks good Miss Kori, she's got a princess to impress," Steve joked and smiled when Em's cheek turned pink in embarrassment. She smiled even as Pat teased an "ooh" at her in jest.
Steve didn’t have to wait long for her to fall asleep, paying attention to her slow even breaths. When he was sure she was asleep and safe in his arms, he allowed himself to drift as well.
“Minor burns and cuts, we gave him some pain meds so he should be fine,” Steve said finally looking at the woman and offering a smile – praying his voice sounded as confident as it did in his head.
“Yeah,” Tony said lamely…probably should’ve left that part out. But hey, he had tried to make it a policy to not lie to his kids, and she was basically an adult anyway. “I think I’m going to have to have a meeting with him to…‘
“If you let me pay for dry-cleaning, I could dirty that uniform for you…” Tony said with a mischievous smile. Steve felt himself blush, all the stress and anger from today slowly draining out of his body at finally seeing his husband. An idea popped into his head…but the thought of either of his kids seeing him in between the lab and their bedroom made the blonde hesitate.
glad I’ve never met him. And speaking of shitty grandparents…did Carolyn tell you why she came down here?” He blinked a few times at that, almost feeling whiplash from the change in subject. But still thankful for it.
“Why are you lying to your boyfriend?” she outright asked, hands on her hips after she stopped directly in front of him.
As they made their way down the hall, the super soldier stopped when Emerson went into her room to change. He swatted Tony after he pinched his butt in passing – smiling as he watched Tony tease Peter on their way to the bedroom. When she had changed and made her way back to the hallway, he smiled down at his youngest before he put his arms around her to embrace her. She quickly melted into it before mumbling, “don’t trust me?” Even with her face against his chest, he could feel her smile.
Tony was talking to Bruce over speakerphone to meet them in the medical wing of the Tower, explaining Clint was bringing their children to meet them as well. One of which…was SPIDERMAN. Tony ran a red light and still Steve didn’t reprimand him, too furious at their son to think straight.
“Cause I did the one fucking thing I shouldn’t have done?” she cried out, pillow stained with her puddle of tears. He sighed, and she was curious because it almost sounded like he was regretful…but if he was…
“Tati…” she said softly as Bucky walked past her to head to his room. He could see if Vi knew who it was for sure before getting his
After several minutes of playing in the water, the two walked back hand in hand, Tony suddenly dragging the two to a very tempting looking hammock. There was a side table, where a waitress brought two iced teas and assorted fruit. Tony tipped her as well, somehow pulling dry cash out of his wet boxer briefs; which were black and hugged his body just right against his olive skin - which would tan soon on this beach...
She turned around before scoffing at Steve. “We apologized two weeks ago and I have no control over my uterus. Plus it’s Sam, I don’t need to host him,” she said with a wicked smile at his friend – who only mockingly glared back at the teen.
“– I’m sorry!” she blurted out, interrupting him. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion at her outburst and continued as she rambled.
“I’m not exactly…hurting right now, if you catch my drift,” she said with a horrible attempt at a wink and finger guns.
“I’m sure she doesn’t need you for two hours,” he assured the blonde, who interlocked their fingers together in response.
Clint stared at his boyfriend, anger shooting up his spine as he waited for the man to explain himself.
“Know what would help me wake up?” she asked as she moved to sit up. It took her a second, her muscles slowly working again but still struggling to do a simple crunch. She smiled as she heard Steve laugh at her, using his hand to help her up. She mock glared at him as she got her bearings, the bastard just smiling at her while waiting for her to continue.
“I know Tony. I know this because I decided to trust you guys long before agreeing to move in. I know you’re not anything like my father. Good news too – she managed a small chuckle – because it means you are not my father and you’re nothing like him,” she emphasized by squeezing his forearms and maintaining eye contact with him.
The zen-like state stayed even as the Alpha's furious scent filled the room, Ty posturing and reposturing as if his tiny mind was trying to calculate a rebuttal.
"Now where are the people supposed to be watching you?" he asked to himself as he made his way to the screening room, a passed out Miles in his arms.
He pulled on a pair of pajama bottoms and a plain black tee before making his way to the kitchen, smiling brightly when he saw Bucky sitting on a stool waiting for him.
The blonde’s face whipped up in shock, secretly hoping James would tell him he’s wrong. That everything was going to be okay. That they could make it.
“- Steven, join me for a drink,” Howard said before walking off, expecting the other Alpha to follow him. Tony shot him an apologetic look but Steve just smiled back at him before following, the two heading off down the hall as Tony contemplated following them.
And before any other thought could form in Bucky’s mind - a wave of memories came flooding back so fast that it had the man knocked down to the floor.
He held her on his lap after he moved to sit on the couch, opting to deal with all of this sitting down. It was like six in the morning…ungodly time to be awake and have to manage calming his hysterical husband down. They called her neurologist and left her a voicemail, then called the emergency nurse hotline to determine if they should take her to the hospital.
“Hand it over, Barton,” the genius said seriously with his hand out. Clint again rolled his eyes before handing back the folder. Tony then handed it to Emerson who gave him a grateful smile before turning to grab the twenty dollar bill Clint was begrudgingly handing her. Natasha moved to join Rhodey at his bedside.
“You can’t ditch work to go fuck your Omega silly, Stevie,” Buck said, helping one of their regulars with his stance before the blonde could even open his mouth.
When she looked up at her father, his stormy blue eyes bore into hers and she could only offer a shaky "I'm sorry." Unable to say anything else or hold the built up tears, she looked away and began crying quietly.
Joey,” he said, quickly kissing the boy’s cheek before he gently pushed the boy off his lap. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go make dinner,” he said as he walked to the kitchen.
"I already told you yankee doodle, a princess would not be interested in a peasant," she said smugly. Kori spoke up before the father could reassure her.
Those words were like a dagger to Steve’s chest. His face crumpled in pain as he brought his hands to his face in agony.
, Steve thought, liking the way the name sounded in his head. A throat clearing snapped him out of staring, though he felt less embarrassed when he realized Tony was staring too.
“Father.” Tony felt instant anger hearing his baby so upset, which must have come off his scent cause his son just whimpered more.
“You’ll apologize to Vivienne the next time we see her. Okay, cub? She was really looking forward to getting to know you today,” he said as he pulled back to look her in the face, adding to the guilt in her stomach. She nodded back in response, though a small part of her wanted to argue that the woman hadn’t said two words to her all day. “Here, take this,” he added, Wolf suddenly appearing in her arms as the man stood up and placed her back down on her bed.
He had also swatted the brunette for that earlier. He secretly loved his husband’s reaction…but enjoyed teasing him entirely too much more to act on it. Especially when their kid was joining them for dinner.
“Be good,” Jackson agreed as he settled in Clint’s arms. They watched Bucky grab a few forks from a drawer before the heard the sounds of tiny footsteps.
“I wouldn’t lie about Dad, I did go to the cemetery to talk to him,” she said, eyes lowered but voice filled with anger.
One by one they took down every team that tried to take them on. Carol and Rhodey, Sam and Ororo, Pepper and Happy...they completed dominated Tony and Steve, high fiving each other as the other teens made excuses and demanded rematches.
“I have a friend of a friend who can help. I’ll give him a call,” Howard said in a low voice, disappointment and anger evident in his tone.
After several more drinks, Steve focused all of his energy on not touching the Omega, even though his instincts screamed to wrap him up in his arms and kiss him silly. He was just so pretty. And kind. And so smart it made Steve feel like an idiot, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“There you are Rogers! What the hell man you said you’d buy me lunch,” Sam said accusingly, and without any ire as he also sported a huge grin.
So it didn’t surprise him when she looked away first, tears in her eyes at the still curled up Peter. Not looking at the two of them, she carefully hopped down before walking past them towards the elevator. It wasn’t fair to her to treat their punishments as equals.
“Tony...none of mine were about you either…” The worry shifted to full anger as he looked incredulously back at his husband.
“Soooo…rumor has it you asked Wilson out to prom?” Peter had been sitting on the bleachers after school, waiting for his science club to meet up in another half hour. He turned to look at Emerson climbing up to join him.
“Like it? It’ll prevent you from misbehaving. Which, speaking of,” the man paused to actually tsk-tsk at her, “I believe we taught you better than that, girl.”
“Oh, you don’t have to do that,” she said. Steve’s face scrunched up at that, she always wanted a snack.
Over in the corner his husband was squatted down next to Leo and talking to him quietly. As his Pop walked over and hugged Pete in greeting, he found his gaze remaining on the shaking child. If the super soldier noticed, he let it slide as he moved to sit next to his husband and grandson.
company,” he finished leaning back against his chair, arms crossed over his chest in satisfaction. The look on his godfather’s face was one he wanted etched forever in his memory.
“But I didn’t raise a brat, Steve. Oh who am I kidding, this is clearly all my fault. He’s a spoiled pup and I failed as his Daddy and I’m going to fail this one too -”
happy you and Steve found each other. My…other dad,” she said with a smile, getting a laugh from the genius. “He’d be happy to have you as a brother-in-law. Not even just what you’ve done with Steve, but me too. We were…broken when you two met. And it’s like, you put us back together. I just want you to know…I loved my Dad and obviously I will never forget him, but I think he’d love knowing you took over the mantle.”
“Yeah, sorry. I was trying to be polite,” Steve said with smile, pulling Tony closer to him as the scientist wondered if he could possibly physically contain this amount of happiness. If she stayed there much longer, Tony would be inclined to kiss Steve to further rub it in.
He made it back to Peter’s fairly quickly, swinging through the streets and making sure no one could see him before changing in his brother’s backyard. Peter had built what looked like a shed, but housed all of Spiderman’s suits and weapons. After throwing on a pair of sweats, he climbed the stairs of the back porch before letting himself in through the backdoor.
"Change my pj's," the boy replied, muffled a little by Tony's shoulder. The father kissed the boy's cheek as he stood up, hefting the boy on his hip as he walked the two over to the dresser.
“Bucky,” the doctor suddenly addressed the super soldier, “you know how our partners can occasionally annoy us from time to time? Like, Nat has cold feet and likes to stick them against my back when we sleep? What silly thing does Vi do?” Stark rejoined them when the doctor finished his questions, med kit in hand and no longer holding the tablet as everyone else looked confused at the doctor.
} She actually flinched at him, which she hadn’t done in a long time. Clint released her but stayed close for comfort as Peter moved to stand in between her and her Tati.
“Jo, hey can you hear me?” Steve asked with concern as he pulled the blankets off her. She nodded to him in response, unable to articulate anything else. “Alright come on kiddo,” she heard him say as strong arms brought her out bed and into a solid chest. Her head lolled against his shoulder, barely conscious as she suddenly had to squint from the bright lights.
“How?...I thought...I thought only an Alpha Prime could counteract a Voice…” Tony said quietly, watching in amazement as both Steve and Harley snuggled closer together. The older blonde looked almost misty-eyed as he looked from Tony to Harley and back to Tony.
He couldn't believe that he'd fallen for it, but didn't really mind the superhero sandwich his ridiculous and loving dads pulled him into.
They ended up staying at the café for another hour and half, chatting away like they’ve known each other for years. And strangely enough, it feels like that even if he barely knew the man. It wasn’t until Tony’s phone went off several times in a row that either noticed the time or how late it had gotten. Tony generously paid the staff and thanked them for the privacy as the two made their way outside into the sunshine.
“Please do, little girl,” he said with a cheeky grin. She stuck her tongue out at him, which he of course returned maturely as he watched her go to her room.
“I thought you were a billionaire?” the bastard asked before kissing his way up his thigh to his waist. He pulled back suddenly, looking Tony in the eye as the man sat there dumbfounded from the sudden movement.
“Peter is with his Aunty Pepper for the rest of the weekend. I was going to run some errands…but it looks like you could use some company.”
“Come on baby girl, we got to clean up before dinner,” she said with finality as the little girl ‘humphed,’ but was otherwise silent on the way to the bathroom.
Steve promised to stay out of it after confronting Clint one morning. But Bucky didn’t recoil or shy away from Clint’s… ‘Clint-ness’... and overall he did think they would make a cute couple...
“No, Buck, I don’t know what to tell you…” Steve said with a smile as the girl continued giggling behind him.
“James...did you know anything about this?” Mrs. Rhodes asked, voice dripping with anger as Steve saw Keisha slowly make her way to the table away from them.
"You really had the balls to use your Voice on a bonded Omega? In front of cameras I clearly have stalled around my work space? Wow you really haven't changed, huh? It's not my fault you were a moron and gave up on the chance to watch that amazing creature grow up before your eyes. Only showed up when it was convenient for you. You've signed your rights away, you've proven that you are a horrible father and if you don't get out of my office I'm going to call security."
He looked back over his husband, rolling his eyes but still smiling in approval at his actions when thinking of the possibility of losing that girl. He also tightened his grip around her, digesting that information as quickly as possible when a thought crossed his mind.
And only really loved one. The linebacker sitting next to her who by all accounts was too loved by the rest of the school to be her best friend.
“Izzy-bee! Lilli-bear!” the vigilante said in equal excitement as he squatted down to accept the hug from their toddlers. Peter remained sitting as he looked at the scared boy glancing around their house, as if to expect it all to come crashing down around him any second.
“I thought I would offer something...that takes anger out in a more satisfying way.” The statement confused her for a moment before realization fueled the flame in her chest.
“They’re free to meet him but two at a time, please. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got another surgery to prep for.”
“Laugh it up, buttercup. You’ll be whistling a different tune when you see the presents I got you.” His Dad wiggled his eyebrows as his Pop, who rolled his eyes at the implication.
?” Tony asked in offense, pulling away from the blonde and starting to walk towards Steve’s bedroom door. He turned and watched the blonde follow him and open the door like the gentleman he knew he'd be.
“Yes well, children aren’t supposed to sit on the counter. Now hush, I’ll watch the Disney movies by myself if I have to. Jarvis? Roll it.”
"No sweetie, that's not what we were talking about," the genius said gently before stealing a look from his old friend. "Of course I want you Miles, I just... I was scared because..." he stumbled, unsure how to explain it.
“Huh…further proof you’re not a Stark – you’re not that bright, are you?” Staci sneered in return as they took a step closer to her.
She hadn’t even thought of that, she really hadn’t been thinking period. She saw her friend in trouble and acted. What if...what if they had to leave and she was the reason why?
He continued his assault, hands trailing down to his ribs as James fell back against the porch; Clint took that opportunity to straddle him.
She wakes up with a start, body drenched in sweat as unwanted tears spilled down her cheeks. She can’t control her breathing, which is rapid even though she feels like a car is resting on her chest. She throws the blankets back, not helping her feeling of suffocation as she throws her legs over the side. Her breath continues to get away from her, chest heaving as she does her best to control her hyperventilation.
“So terribly sorry for the torture you go through with having me as your parent. You should go on Oprah,” the blonde said sarcastically.
“Okay, but what if the car isn’t as conspicuous as you think it is and people take a million pictures of us?”
“Mama said you were picking me up and I got so excited I told everyone my Papa was coming to get me!” Peter practically shouted to the blonde as he helped Peter sit and buckle up in the backseat.
“YAAAS!” Peter exclaimed before running into the kitchen. Steve noticed Emerson hesitate and look down, not moving to get some ice cream.
He wrapped his arms around her as she slowly relaxed into his embrace, slowly feeling the warmth grow in her. He whispered words of reassurance as she maneuvered her arms to cling to him. He started rubbing her back in comfort, stopping when she yelped in pain when his hand moved to her lower back. He went rigid below her, pulling his hands up in fear as she sat stiffly on his lap. She carefully reached her hand down to feel her back, sure she'd feel fresh blood from the belt marks. She didn't feel anything and trusted her father better than her own mind, shifting on his lap so she could lift her shirt up to show him.
“Give me a few more weeks of physical therapy and I’ll be out of this stupid wheelchair in no time,” Sarah muttered.
This is a first for Steve. He’s never actually shaken with rage towards a loved one. Nor did he ever think his kid could make him this angry.
"Invasive? Like you x-ray me or something?" Emerson asked innocently as she swung her feet sitting on the counter. Bruce shared a look with the fathers before gently addressing the teen.
“Okay, thanks J,” she said as she got a bottle of hard cider out of the fridge. She took a swig as she made her way back to the counter, rifling through the mail. Most of it was for her Dad, a few art magazines for her Pop. A small envelope caught her attention, as it was the only hand-written one.
She wasn’t trying to eavesdrop, but she might have had a bad dream and just wanted a late night snack. But she would have had to walk around the living room to get to the kitchen. And that was not an awkward experience she needed to participate in.
“I died. Technically, for a bit. Then I was illegally experimented on and brought back to life. The drug busting slash red and black fetish outfit - vigilante alter ego is to find the guy who did it. And no, I didn’t tell you because I figured,” momentarily dropping the funny guy routine, “…I’d put you through enough already…”
,” Bucky said, obnoxiously kissing the shorter teen’s temple as he grumbled in protest. Bastard knew he couldn’t retaliate with a sleepy baby in his arms.
“Tony you’re a smart kid, but you have no idea the ins and outs of actually running a multi-million dollar weapons company…”
to be a good husband, in marriage. I remember that night, I remember what I said. I listed every big decision about my life that I’ve second-guessed...
At one point, strangely enough, Thor even managed to drag Bruce over as his partner to play them - but they ultimately murdered them too. Clint threw a wink at his genius friend, smiling at seeing the blush on his face.
But then he heard movement followed by the sounds of footsteps, then the door opened a little and Brock stood there. Well, leaned there, he was very obviously drunk.
After washing his hands he made his way back to the group, stopping at seeing Natasha with her arm around a short brunette. His friends appeared to be laughing at whatever the unknown man had said.
Steve rolled his eyes, angrily putting his drawing aside to grab the diaper. He glared at his brother before reaching down and simply pulling the girl up to lie on the couch next to him. He took advantage of her confused look and quickly put the diaper on her bottom, finishing with the clasps before she knew what had happened.
Bucky followed Steve’s line of sight and laughed as well, shaking his head fondly as he went to take the cookies away from her.
Sorry for the pacing...hope y'all liked it. Also please blame all shitty translations on Google, twas it's fault.
“She could’ve told Jarvis to let us know that…” Tony bit his bottom lip at that, not wanting to worry the toddler but becoming increasingly concerned of the situation.
“Oh wow, I’m surprised he actually talked about me. Even to his…lover,” Joey said teasingly as Steve shot another glare her way.
Her name was Carolyn Foster and she owned a bakery in Portland, Oregon. Her grandmother literally bakes cookies. And she had just been wondering what it would be like to have a female to talk to…wondering why Steve had never mentioned her.
, Steve went for his usual morning run. He took a shortcut through a park and almost tripped over his own feet when he saw a certain someone sitting on a bench.
Instead all eyes suddenly turned to the sound of a gun cocking - where grandma Helen was holding a twelve gage on the top step.
“Hey, I need to change out of this uniform, how about you curl up with us tonight, huh?” he asked as he gently extracted himself from her.
He and Tony won homecoming kings by a landslide of write in votes, but Nat and her girlfriend - Valerie from Australia - won prom queens so it evened out.
“What would we be doing on this secluded beach?” Tony asked. Steve couldn’t help but laugh at that, kissing the back of his husband’s head before answering him.
The genius moaned loudly when his husband grabbed his ass and collided their pelvises together. Tony felt his heartbeat accelerate when, even behind clothing, the two could feel the other party was clearly excited. He let out a whine when Steve pulled back again, holding them apart with his hands grasping Tony’s shoulders.
Joey quirked a brow before saying, “I thought you knew the Stark family? Didn’t you know we’re all raging homosexuals?” And then Helen laughed, and Joey knew she was a gonner.
“Nakey like Daddy!” the toddler proclaimed as she suddenly stopped running in favor of dancing. Steve looked over to his older brother, who was smiling down at his daughter.
“Ah! Daddy I’m sorry…it won’t happen again!” she cried as her fingers dug into the comforter in front of her. He shifted her on his lap, and for a brief moment she thought it was over, until he lifted his leg up to get her sit spots.
“I’m so sorry about him, just ignore my brother,” Steve said to Tony, though he couldn’t help but notice the slight pink to Tony’s cheek as well. It was fucking adorable.
“So...I’m probably putting my foot in my mouth, but weren’t you mad at me?” Tony asked cause he couldn’t keep his big mouth shut. It helped that he was currently lathering up strong muscle.
“You should be more concerned for your own life,” Bucky growled as he moved to stand up, but not before a tiny hand shot out and grabbed his flesh wrist.
"Of course I did," the other woman said with a small smile, making the butterflies in her stomach go crazy.
Steve was funny and charming. And sweet. He suggested a picnic in the park for their first date - even invited Harley along. But as much as he loved his son, Tony wanted
She sat on the comfy couch in Kate’s office, foot tapping from her anxiety. She just told Kate her deepest darkest secret. The reason she refuses to meet with her birth mother and why she constantly worries about her fathers’ kicking her out. Kate was silent, probably thinking the worst of the sullen teen in front of her.
“I’ve met your Aunt Pepper, she would totally kick my butt if I was ever mean to you,” Steve agreed, doing his best not to smile at the boy’s face. “You deserve someone nice too, Harley. I hope you do tell someone if I’m ever mean to you or your Daddy.” Harley was stunned into silence, deflating in his chair as Tony rejoined them.
“So…you do like it?” the brunette teased with flushed cheeks. Steve rolled his eyes fondly before smiling brightly back at his man.
“So,” Tony began quietly, not wanting to wake the now sleeping puppy. “Since when would Harley want to sit on your lap, Alpha?” The question got an adorable blush from the blonde, who squirmed a little in his seat.
"Welcome friends," T'Challa greeted, smiling when Pop returned his outstretched hand to return the greeting. "Where is the young man we are celebrating?"
Tony obviously wasn’t paying attention, either buying him and Clint the entirety of the concession stand or cheering on whoever’s pants were tightest. Clint only paid attention when it had to do with his boyfriend, otherwise focusing solely on inhaling all the food Tony purchased.
“What the hell?” he asked the so-called ‘genius’, gripping his fist angrily and ready to fight if necessary. Steve must have sensed that, as he made his way closer in case he needed to defend his husband.
At the pet store, they ended up maybe going a little overboard. Cat tree, litter box, food, food bowls, treats, flea and tick meds, collar, leash and harness, a million toys and other scratching posts. Oh, and a cat bed that doubled as a cat tent.
In an instant, a sword appeared and cut off the hand holding the gun. He turned to see the man in red…and black, now sporting two samurai swords – one of which had just amputated a limb. The two silently turned their attention back to the thugs, working together to finish knocking out the now considerable amount of men that had gathered.
“Hold up,” Emerson interrupted, turning to Steve, “how come when he calls you old you don’t torture him?”
“Or you could talk to me,” the brunette countered, scratching his arm anxiously as he tried to salvage their afternoon together. That was apparently the wrong thing to say as the blonde scowled back at him.
Miles stood gaping at him, wondering who the hell this guy was when his senses warned him of the goon still behind them. But again, before he could do anything an escrima stick went flying past his head and knocked the man down to the floor.
“But not alcohol?” Joey asked half-jokingly. May was actually kind of the perfect person to talk to about this, and she’d be lying if she said the offer wasn’t tempting.
He ignored his little brother’s recant of whatever happened last night in favor of sipping on the hot coffee he had poured himself. He watched the younger man prepare some burgers and fries for them, offering his thanks by not asking him to stop talking - even though he couldn’t care less.
“No, actually, I have two gay dads,” Joey snapped back, officially done with this conversation and moving to put her jacket on to leave.
– She sat upright, heaving through her lungs, eye blinking away the tears from her eyes. She looked around her, recognizing her room. It was a dream. Just a dream, she tells herself. Well, technically it was a fucking nightmare. More tears poured from her eyes as her breathing turned erratic, wrapping her arms to try to ground herself. It wasn’t real. Her Dad and Pop are on a mission, they’ve only been gone what? Five days. That…thing is nowhere near them and has no idea where she is…right?
“Alright kiddos let’s go paint with Poppy!” Wade said as the three cheered and raced him to the door. Peter trailed behind, frowning at not feeling like himself lately. His mood did improve when he got inside, able to hear his parents greet his kids. Plus Miles was here, even if Emerson was staying with Aunt Nat and Uncle Buck for a week, he’d get some sibling time.
“Slow down, son. What do you mean she…are you sure…” he looked up into his husbands eyes with a fear Tony had never seen before. “Emerson’s been taken,” Steve said to him before turning back to the phone to try to calm their frantic son, who Tony could hear several feet away. He felt his heart stop, the wheels in the genius’ brain no longer clicking as he couldn’t process Steve’s word. Taken? Who on Earth would take…
“– ruin it any further. There, happy? Before he does let me just say anything done before morning coffee cannot be held against me.”
"Babe why don't you tell them about the vacation idea we were talking about?" The brunette's face instantly lit up before turning to the two kids finishing up their breakfast.
The blonde gently released his grip and pulled his own legs up onto the couch, bringing Tony with him as he gently pulled him down and into his arms – the two stretching out on the couch as Steve felt one hundred percent of his anger redirected to that man. He wrapped his arms around his husband, allowing all of the anger to be set aside for now as he worked on comforting the love of his life, gently kissing the back of his head.
“Yes! Okay? Yes. They did. And it hurt like a motherfucker!” she said as she once again curled in on herself. The two fathers sat in silence as they absorbed this new information.
“Last time I confide in that son of a bitch,” Tony muttered half-heartedly, finishing his drink and moving to make himself another one.
He messaged Wade the change of plans before stopping by their apartment to grab a few things. He got a text that he checked before driving to the Tower - Wade offering to make soup and bring it when he had a chance.
of this is your fault, cub. This is all me, okay? It’s my fault you’re here. And I’m so sorry for that Daci. Vivienne she...she was drugging me this whole time…”
your mom…” She saw him drum his fingers against his sternum, looking like he was deep in thought as he still remained silent.
“I know Stevie, me too,” he heard his brother say with a waver in his voice as the two practically clung to each other in the kitchen. After a moment Buck pulled away to smile at his brother and reassure him.
“Video feed shows Daci putting her hand against the wall and shutting JARVIS down for a bit. And she mimicked my voice to call a car...looks like it took her to...an apartment complex on the upper east side?”
Which would prove necessary, since the next words that came out of Stark’s mouth were “JARVIS activate snow globe” followed by the chest plate and arms of the Iron Man armor flying in and attaching to Bucky. The brunette growled in anger and tried to lunge for the billionaire, but was frozen from the armor - then everything moved in slow motion. He could see Steve out of the corner of his eye reach for Bucky as his husband cocked his fist back and squarely punched Bucky in the nose.
“No I think I can handle-” Tony said before Wade interrupted with a loud and wet fart, laughing like a hyena. It prompted the genius to immediately hand the baby back to his laughing Papa, only frowning when he heard the rest of the room laugh as well.
Steve patted the open space next to him on the couch, his face tired as he pulled some of the blankets the other three had been sharing to give. She gulped before declining and moving to sit several inches away from the man, curling up into a ball at the farthest end of the couch.
“Like I said, be my guest. But if I were a gambling man, I’d guess the Avengers aren’t exactly aware of you replacing the original. So run along and tattle if you feel the need.”
“Just a second!” she heard her voice call from behind the door, suddenly more nervous as she listened to footsteps approach. The door swung open, and Daci shifted from one foot to the other as Vivienne stood there in shock. “Daciana?”
“This is nothing that a simple apology can’t fix. And then we can find out what that lying bitch was up to,” Steve cursed for him, which almost put a smile on Bucky’s face. Except he replayed the way he treated Clint and his own daughter in his head. That just curdled the sour in his stomach and made him feel more betrayed than he’s felt in his life. Which is saying something.
Joey asked to spend the night with Nat and Clint – as they had bribed the teenager with concert tickets, so it was just the boys tonight. He didn’t want his kids to find out right now anyway, promising himself he’ll tell them later too. With Steve’s help, of course.
“Well regardless, Harley pay attention to the bonding part of having siblings...not the getting into trouble part.”
Blinking a few times, he got up and went to answer the door. Surprised to see his parents standing there with matching smiles, holding several bags.
Steve looked back down at their kid before answering the unspoken question. “We uh…met her mother today.”
“How about we head to the art room and let Daci and Papa finish eating, okay?” Tony asked, making Daci shoot him a smile in relief.
The Omega squeezed his hand, returning the love through the bond and letting his own thankfulness wash over him.
Steve only chastised him once, but Tony used that momentum to quickly propel them out of the car, into the hotel and up to their room.
So the arachnid turned his fury back to his husband, who was still trying to hide behind his much shorter sister.
“Clint!” Daci cried in excitement, running into his outstretched arms. He was standing in the living room next to Morgan and Harley who were coloring on the floor.
“Hey Steve,” Tony said with a bright smile, pulling the blonde inside and steering him towards the kitchen. “Here let me help with those groceries. I told you I could’ve had it delivered!”
“Your sister, Samantha. She wasn’t Robert’s. Her father was a man named Jerry who had fell in love with me and tried to convince me to run away with him. I was furious at you…because she was our ticket out. You, me and Sammy…we were going to have a new start. And then…she…died.” Emerson froze from that.
“Can we?” Harley asked, demeanor changing a little when he turned to the Alpha. “Can we Steve?” The hesitancy had the Alpha realize Tony wasn’t the only one who noticed the change in Steve since Peter was born.
She could’ve guessed her brother wanted to be like his parents, wanted to be a superhero and save the world…but she was also surprised to learn that it was also helping him with Wade. Apparently saving little old ladies helps with grief? If only she’d known sooner...
“I mean, yes, finding this out sucks. But we don’t have to even mention her again if you don’t want us to. And I’ll make sure you never have to hear from her again too. If that’s what you want,” he quickly clarified.
And he wasn’t even sure yet, he thought as he got in his car and drove to a far away convenience store.
“So...what about becoming my husband?” James asked, reaching into his jacket pocket as Clint stood there in shock.
“I almost died and this is the respect I get?” She laughed along with her family as she felt her Pops wrap his arms around her; chin resting on the top of her head.
They only ended up sleeping for the last thirty or so minutes before his alarm went off. After watching several home movies, they’d spent the rest of the night –
“Tony, I know you think of your childhood, but there’s a difference between discipline and abuse…” Steve said calmly, feeling just slightly defensive of his brother and mom. Tony seemed to think of that before sighing in agreement.
,” she quietly whined in protest as he pulled her across his lap. Sometimes it worked, and he definitely did pause, but ultimately he tucked her under his arm.
difference,” he said sternly as she simply groaned and collapsed her face back into her crossed arms on the counter. She heard her Dad chuckle but also chose to ignore it.
So while the two teens wrestled over the glass case, things were kicked around and spilled. And then there was an explosion.
“Did Steve tell you we got smocks? They’ll keep you clean,” Tony said with a smile, walking around to sit next to her and eat some of the crepes.
“But, Steve would let me meet my father. Right Steve?” Harley asked, turning to the Alpha who looked absolutely heartbroken but put on a smile regardless.
"No I haven't seen your brother, I saw the lab explode and the men take you and just..." she trailed off as she looked at anywhere but the eighteen year old standing in front of her.
“Thanks for doing this, Platypus. Now go get laid,” Tony said after giving him a hug, letting out a huff when his oldest friend shoved him back before getting on the elevator. The genius couldn’t help but stick his tongue out at his best friend who gave him the finger as the doors closed.
“Just be gentle, Steve. He’s not made of glass and is full of the best kinds of pain killers. In fact, call mister sass-mouth out if he tries to milk this too much,” she said with a wink. Steve laughed along with her, knowing they had worked together before this…and also knew his husband well enough to know that man has a
"Everyone has nightmares, little one," the man said as he reached out to ruffle the boy's hair, retracting when the boy shook his head.
“It’ll be alright, cub. I won't be gone long, okay?” he reassured, squeezing her hand when the door opened before walking the two to the sounds of the Starks - minus Steve - in the living room. “Thanks again, man.”
“We love you too baby girl,” her Pop responded, squishing her a little more into their bear hug. They finally released their daughter, helping her tuck in and get comfortable in bed, before wishing her goodnight.
“Why are you getting this spanking, Jo?” he asked quietly, large palm gently hovering over her fiery backside, most definitely red and radiating off heat at this point.
Tony felt the couch shift behind him as Steve got off and stood up next to him, stretching his body out.
to sleep, it was that every time he tried images from his past flooded his mind. Clearly, he was just a weak person.
“Tony,” Steve said in a quieter tone. “Why do you think I retired?” The blonde frowned when his husband visibly winced at that.
He texted the man back, smiling at thinking how far his boyfriend had come over the year. It was only a few minutes before a familiar Mustang pulled up, the blonde spending that time reminiscing as he quickly got in the car.
“Tony, honey, everything’s fine. Great, actually. That’s my happy voice, not my panic voice,” Steve clarified, sending a little of his current happiness into the bond. The feeling he got back was happy and thankful.
Steve was the last to slip inside the gate, but the first to notice the herd's owner as the man walked over to greet them.
They decided on some dive Mexican-food joint that Wade had apparently been to and had sworn by their chimichangas. The three waited outside in line, since it was small and had a thirty minute wait time. He was laughing at another one of Wade’s jokes when he noticed some guy eyeing Emerson.
“Ice cream? They haven’t had lunch yet,” he complained as his toddlers scrambled off their uncle and ran to the kitchen.
They saw their old friend sitting near the cracked open door, her eyes sad as she looked up at the approaching fathers. The red head slowly stood up and gave the fathers a silent shoulder-shrug head-shake combo before giving them privacy to try.
Steve offered to walk him to his car, Tony smiling at Joey in farewell and glad to see her smile and nod back.
“Oh honey, do you know who his father is? It was his fourth word,” he admitted, laughing with her. “But yes please try, see you soon.”
“Yeah, that’s not a bad idea,” Barney said with a smile. “You know for a dude that’s dating my brother you’re not nearly as stupid as I thought you’d be.”
“No,” Bucky said in frustration, leaning over to push the camera further back on the couch as she whined in protest.
After Steve’s knot deflated and he pulled himself free, the two laid next to each other, staring at the ceiling and still catching their breath.
“That’s right, come on sweetheart, you have to show Okoye Miles’ spray paint studio.” Emerson watched with suspicious eyes as the three left her alone with her brother in law, feeling like there was a good chance they had planned this.
“Care to explain yourself there hot stuff?” Tony asked. The blonde looked back up at him as if it was obvious, moving down to the brunette’s thigh to focus on the next scar.
"Stop gloating!" she whined at him as she continued chasing the toddler around the living room. "At least put a diaper on!" she said, already tired of running. Steve kept laughing when he realized, her son was not so tired.
Which is why the Alpha did his best to comfort the pup without holding him. He set up pillows and blankets in the living room, grabbed the pup’s teddy bear and put on a dinosaur movie marathon. He brought tissues and a trash can, since the pup had already thrown up once at school. He also grabbed him some juice and gave him medication, making the same face as him when he drank the yucky red liquid.
When they got to the station, they saw Sam and Thor getting out of their truck, greeting them as they entered the station with them. She had suggested getting enough for the other medics, ignoring her Dad’s inappropriate joke about hand feeding the Australian.
“You are! Before you, he was so far in the closet Narnia declared him a citizen,” she said as Tony bellowed in laughter at that. The laughing woke up Peter as Jarvis alerted them the delivery person had arrived.
Peter sat in between the two, smiling gleefully even as the carnie asked the brunette – again – if the height was too scary for the three year old. He assured him he loved heights as the boy whined in impatience. The older gentleman finally stepped back and started the ride. He squealed along with the kids, loving that they were seeing the setting sun when they stopped at the top.
“Hey,” Clint said to get his attention, shifting when the older teen looked up and gently crawled onto his lap. He cradled the brunette’s face in his hands, whispering “
“Hey puddin, how was therapy?” his smile disappeared when he saw the tear tracks. He stood up, wiping some of the tears from her cheeks. She looked up into his brown eyes a moment before tightly hugging him. She felt him return the hug, kissing the top of her head.
. So. Get off my property. And stay the hell away from my son,” the Alpha growled, fist curling and preparing to be the one to rip out the other man’s neck with his teeth should he try anything stupid. Luckily Stone had an ounce of sense left in him, not saying another word but instead scrambling up and leaving in his ugly car.
“How about I take Lucky for a walk? Huh good boy you wanna go for a walk?” Barney asked as he grabbed the leash and led the pup out the door, away from the angry atmosphere.
“Oh honey, don’t pretend like you could handle that. You and your baby carrot dick would cum in your pants
She wanted her mom, who died four years earlier and left her with the devil himself. She didn’t care if she abandoned her, she was the only one who at least acted like she gave a damn. Not that Wendy didn’t, but she was already very skilled at not trusting people. She learned people only are nice when they want something from you and often times aren’t when you don’t give that to them.
“I’m pretty great, my sweet perfect Omega. We’ve got some great pups, don’t we?” Steve asked as he leaned down to kiss his mate on his plump lips.
“When did you guys get back?” Tony asked, content with watching his father play with his son’s fingers.
. But either way, I’d love to talk crap about you on TV.” He glared at her in response before a smile broke across his face.
“What did you say?” Bucky asked in an even tone, two sides of his brain fighting out what to do right now; one side wanted to attack her for hurting Vi while the other reminded him she was under his protection and you don’t hurt those under your protection.
Which, unsurprisingly, ended with his husband grabbing his ass. He swatted the man away before walking back to the living room and sending little glares to his little brother.
“Daddy no!” Harley cried before tightening his hold around his father and suddenly bursting into tears.
“Harley, did you have a bad dream about your Daddy?” she asked the toddler, face breaking into a smile when both Tony and Harley turned to her in surprise. “Sometimes when I have a bad dream about my Tati, I don’t want him out of my sight for a while. Make sure he’s safe.” Her focus was on Harley but she could see Tony smile out of the corner of her eye.
“Ma made me promise to record it, you know she has to work,” Steve pointed out, crossing his legs and smiling at his baby niece – who was currently making grabby hands for him. When she started whining for release, Bucky lifted her up and held her steady on her two legs.
“Ah, so you and Xavier are still fighting?” he asked as wheeled his chair around to sit closer to her, making her laugh as he propped his feet back up on his desk.
…which meant the scream had actually come from the adult man, since both kids just looked confused but calm at the adults.
It’s why he’s been redrawing himself from social outings, like another one of Thor’s parties. This weekend was especially bad, lying to James about spending the weekend with Nat and not even telling his best friend about it. He knew she was out of town with her aunt, and also knew her well enough to know she’d cover for him if Bucky asked her.
“Well, it’s said that the first time you touch, you feel a spark of electricity. The sex is beyond amazing. But from what I’ve read about it, it’s a ‘feeling’ not otherwise specified.”
“He’s dead,” Bucky replied as he stood up with Daci in his arms. “I’ve got Daci, rendezvous at the jet.” She barely stirred in his arms as he ran, alarming the man but not enough to stop and look. He had to get her on the jet and back home.
“Peter? Daci what the hell just happened?” Steve asked frantically as he looked each child over. Daci stood quietly, looking behind her father and frowning when he saw Vivienne approaching them. The woman had a disappointed look on her face and was speaking on a phone - which for some reason only made Daci angry.
He could hear the loud speaker system on the stairs as he descended down, smiling to himself as he heard ACDC blasting from his husband’s lab. He punched in the code Tony had given him long ago, also asking Jarvis to turn the music down a smidge so he could have an actual conversation with the man.
Coming down from the most mind-shattering orgasm took him a while, but he was thankful for the steady weight on his chest slowly bringing him back to the land of the conscious.
“Putting yourself in stupid and reckless danger over something so easily avoidable? You know better Joey…” he said sadly as he continued raining swats down.
,” she whined at him with her bottom lip out as she reached her arms out to the chuckling brunette; who quickly wrapped his arms around her in understanding. She could hear her blonde father scoff at the two.
“You did it! Holy crap Daciana that was awesome!” the archer exclaimed, reaching his arms out before recoiling immediately.
“He did?” their mom asked in shock, as if she was hearing this for the first time. “Well that sounds like a mean Daddy, doesn’t it?”
The blonde figured he’d held off as long as he could, gently grabbing the brunette by his hips and bringing him closer. When he was close enough, Steve moved his hands to gently grab the calloused yet still soft hands of his husband. Tony gave a squeeze of his own, looking into Steve’s eyes as a smile slowly spread across his face.
“–because he couldn’t handle it. Handle you, at least all by himself. I tried to get you, but by then he had changed his mind…anyway, look I was thinking of treating us to a spa day–”
A voice...very quiet...reminded him that this child was also under his protection. He momentarily stopped his quest to turn to Daciana.
She made her way to the lab and punched in the code Tony had given her to enter the lab. She found Tony just as J had described – minus the pool of drool. She carefully walked around DUM-E to grab his arm. “Come on big guy” she grunted as she helped the grumbling toddler into a sitting position. Brown eyes peaked through the thick eyelashes at her, almost in disbelief.
“I heard Papa and Daddy talking about Daddy’s heart. He said he’ll need surgery,” he said with a frown as he continued with his artwork. “But Papa promised he’d be okay.” Joey dropped her crayons as the words hit her like a slap to the face.
Steve immediately let out a laugh, laughing harder when it took Clint a second to realize what the brunette had said.
“Hey Pep! Were his pants on fire? That usually is a dead give away,” the teen teased back, going in for the hug her pseudo aunt had her arms stretched out for. The woman laughed easily into the hug, causing the smile to stay plastered on Jo even when they pulled away.
She couldn’t help but chuckle at that, staying in his embrace and officially exhausted from this evening.
“Different parenting styles, Mr. Rogers,” Howard smirked, purposefully not addressing him correctly as an insult. “Now, if you’ll mind your own goddamn business, I need to speak to my son.”
Inside was a somber affair. Rhodey and Happy were standing off to the side, speaking in hushed tones. Pepper was sitting next to Maria, comforting the woman and sitting next to them was Howard with a sniffling Harley in his lap.
“JARVIS and I have been secretly drugging you for years,” he finally admitted out loud. “Nothing abnormal, you know. Just vitamins. And baby aspirin for your heart. And I’ve switched your coffee to decaf a number of times. And I might have snuck kale into your diet…”
Tony was apparently waiting to see her face to speak again, having helped her right her clothing and sit up to face them.
As his step-pup asked for more stories, the Alpha found himself feeling more love for his mate and son, and how well they got along with his family.
“He made it as far as our house,” Steve explained to Tony, enjoying the way his brown eyes sparkled when he laughed.
“Emerson, is there anything you’d like to talk to me about? Peter told us you’d missed the last few days of school.” She kept her eyes down, refusing to make eye contact. They sat there for two long minutes, before she spoke.
“Do tell,” Tony purred at him, attempting to cop a feel on their way out. Steve playfully swatted him away before quickly pulling the man back into his arms.
"I won't be, at least half the time, the other half will be with Wade," he turned to his Dad to reassure him after he dramatically threw his hands up in protest.
He shook his head no in response, remembering that he hadn’t spent that much time with the woman to have a real conversation.
a fucking monster. I had a restraining order against him…it must’ve expired…” he trailed off looking away from Steve, blinking away several tears.
“Yes I absolutely can, Pepper! That fucker will go down for what he fucking did to my daughter,” he growled at his friend who was dragging him back down the hall of the hospital. Rhodey, the other traitor, was on Tony’s other side bringing the man back to his daughter’s room.
“Steve!” Harley cried, jumping off Howard’s lap and running over to the older blonde. He’d never initiated a hug before, but luckily Steve’s reflexes were automatic as he grabbed the boy and pulled him up into his arms, reminding himself the pup was safe. “It’s my fault, Steve! This is all my fault.”
Every instinct told her this was a bad idea. But something deep down inside of her wanted to have an actual conversation with this woman.
, he bitterly thought as he pretended to listen to Fury’s hologram give them a run down for what was happening in Australia. His son had just lost the love of his life two days ago. He was depressed and needed his dads, who were currently on a plane three hours from their destination. He didn’t listen to his gruff old friend’s voice as his heart ached for his son.  He barely registered Steve responding, lost in his own thoughts. Didn’t even notice they’d stopped talking and had ended the conversation until he felt a tight grip on his bicep, bringing him back to the present.
“Tony, you’re not helping. Bucky, it’s going to be okay,” Steve said next to him as Bucky concentrated on his breathing.
“They’re pretty silly,” she said after a moment, smiling at seeing two little monkeys wrestling each other.
“Nat tells me you heard about the newest vigilante swinging through the streets. Think he’s one of Xavier’s?” his Pop asked.
“Can I sleep in here with you tonight?” she whispered, suddenly feeling exhausted. “I uh… I miss them too you know.”
He decided to get a cup of coffee and ditched school for the day. He’d use the voice app in his phone to call the school in a bit and use his Dad’s voice to say Tony was sick for the day.
“Tony. You are the most intelligent and capable person I’ve ever known. Regardless of your gender. If you didn’t want to go through with this, it wouldn’t change how I feel about you.”
“Jo, I’m sorry, that fucker will go down, but you know what he said wasn’t true right?” he asked gently. She gave him his infamous smirk right back.
“That’s amazing! Tell Zoe we said congrats!” Tony replied, smiling at his daughter also awkwardly standing there. “Alright you two, do I need to play mediator here, or are you two ready to apologize and make up?”
“Alright everyone, take it easy on Tony,” Bruce said next to Emerson. “He’s still recovering from a building falling on him. No need to point out he was saved by teenagers.” Everyone – even Emerson – was laughing at that.
As gently as he could, he sat down on the bed, not wanting to interrupt or intrude on this special moment. Also, knowing Tony and now Emerson, both of whom sleep like damn starfish, there wasn’t room for him to try and curl up with them. Content, he just gazed on them, hoping to etch this memory in his brain.
"It took you like thirty seconds, you attention whore," the brunette said getting a genuine laugh from his daughter and a glare from his husband.
“What kind of ignorant, dumbass, rednecks throw away a perfectly good twinkie?” He couldn’t hide the smile from her antics; laughed a little along with the now bigger crowd that had formed.
“What are you talking about, Steve?” The blonde took a shaky breath of his own before reaching for the brunette’s hand, who gave it to the Alpha freely.
“You don’t know that,” he said, totally lying. She scoffed loudly, not believing him for a second as she rubbed her arm pointedly. They got into the doors and Steve felt his anger dangerously close to brimming over.
“What’s this about fish?” a voice asked that approached the two, the blondes turning with smiles to see Tony standing behind them.
