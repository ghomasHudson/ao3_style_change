“There is not a thing you could do,” Cas says softly, taking his hand, “that could make me hate you, Dean Winchester.”
The alpha doesn’t speak. He just lets Dean talk, lets him ramble like his words mean something. To him, they do, and Dean knows that now. “It felt

There are no neighbors within eyesight. He wonders what part of the state they’re in, how far from Hell he’s managed to get. Wherever they are, it’s beautiful outside, the light sparkling off the icicles in the trees and the branches swaying rhythmically in the wind. It’s been a long time since he’s seen snow without being terrified out of his mind, so he’s determined to enjoy it while it lasts.
A tear streaks down his face, but relief cracks Dean’s voice as he speaks. He scrubs a hand through his hair, takes a shaky breath. “But, God. You got no idea how good it feels to hear that you don’t… that you were just saying shit ‘cause you were freaking out. That you don’t

Sam swallows the pang of guilt he feels at that. He’s gotten Bobby’s hopes up so many times. “You gotta hold down the fort, old man,” he jokes, his voice a little tight. “What if we need a safehouse?”

It’s rare for
He’s never admitted that to anyone before. But he does. It’s the first bad thing that ever happened to him, his childhood home burning to the ground – the thing that set his life spinning out of control. He knows his dad had been sensitive to it, too. Dean had watched him tense up around campfire smoke, had seen the clench in his jaw every time a fire truck had wailed past the Impala.
“I’ve never… I’ve never
Dean nods, his lips pressed together, but Castiel doesn’t relent. “What’s bothering you?”
Castiel obliged, shifting awkwardly in the grass, lifting his hips and pulling off the uncomfortably wet piece of clothing. He tossed it to the side just as Dean had.

might not even recognize that he was doing so.
It’d made him weak and dazed but he’d still remembered everything – every grope, slap and bite, every whistling, screaming impact of that hateful cane. The dosage had been low enough for him to still be awake to beg, and that had probably made things worse. That client had
“I’m just… I’m not used to this,” he says after a moment, gesturing at the room with a shaky movement. “Not used to just… sitting around.” He doesn’t know how to explain more than that, doesn’t fully understand it himself. Doesn’t get why he’s incapable of enjoying the quiet.
“No one’s arguing with that, but maybe you could have waited a good twenty-four?” he snaps, irritated. “Where is he now?”
She closes her eyes. Takes a long breath in through her nose, lets it out through her mouth. “Your master did that to you?”
Dean kneeled beside him, immediately joined by Sam and Cas, whose chest was still heaving. The four of them sat frozen for one suspended moment until the kid looked up, fixed his eyes on Dean’s hand, and let out a strangled yelp. He scrambled back on his hands, shuffling over the debris like he could get away. But, of course, his back just hit the wall. He swallowed, eyes wide with fear.
Mentally, he yanks back on the reins. For God’s sake, Cas hasn’t even seen him
Castiel nudges open the door with his foot, two plates of warm food in his hands. The omega has his back to the door, arranging things on the mattress with little twitches and jerks.
The hood of the Impala was cool under him when he carefully sat back on it, the frame creaking just a little as he got himself comfortable. Scott stared at him skeptically, but Dean just patted the space next to him. “Come on up and take a look.”
“Cas- I want. Need-

here, Bobby.”
For the first time in a few days, they don’t eat on the floor in Dean’s room – instead, Castiel announces that breakfast is ready if he’s hungry. When he inches into the kitchen, the alpha is leaning against the counter next to the stove with a plate balanced in his hand. He looks relaxed.
Dean blinks at her over the mountain of clothes. She gestures over at a closed off fitting area across the store. “Why don’t you go through those and tell me what fits and what doesn’t? I can make any alterations we need to in a jiffy.”
The sight makes something in his stomach twist and tangle, and he’s frozen in place, staring at someone he barely even recognizes. He’s flushed, his hair dark where it’s plastered flat against his head with sweat – his skin is pale, and he feels goosebumps rise and spread across his entire body as he stares at that tell-tale color. Those eyes are not his own.
He takes a breath, makes himself go on when Benny cocks his head and waits for him to continue. “He… owns me,” he says weakly, and the words don’t hurt. Not really. ‘Cause Cas doesn’t treat him like that anyway – at this point, it almost feels like a technicality. Still, the difference between them is
When Sam had exited the store to meet the man outside, Balthazar had been lingering under the awning by the front door to avoid the rain. He’d hung up the phone with an irritated expression on his face, one which morphed into transparent surprise when he took in the sight of Sam, pushing a cart laden down with grocery bags. Sam, too tired to try and figure it out, had simply walked past him into the rain and started loading the groceries into the Impala’s trunk.

Sam laughs. “I sure hope so. Think I do.” He taps his wallet in his back pocket with one hand, thinking about the pitiful numbers in his bank account. “Guess we’ll see.”
Lawfully
Maybe it's just that he wants to prove Cas right.
“Toast,” he finally says, and Castiel smiles over his shoulder at him and pops some down. He thinks that they’ll have eggs again, today – Dean seemed to like the sausage he’d mixed into them before. The pan is just hot enough to start when Dean speaks.

He takes a few deep breaths of that before he makes himself climb the stairs.
Luckily for Dean’s pride, he doesn’t say much else – he just wraps his arms around Dean and slowly slides them down to the floor so they can sit.
The alpha looks up at him with wide eyes, something almost like fear in them, but Dean refuses to backtrack now. He straightens his clothes and snatches his food off of the coffee table, striding to the kitchen to dump it in the trash.

As though he’s confused by
They get through the entire bar like this, piece by piece, and it’s domestic in a way that Castiel has truly begun to crave. Simple, and easy, and quiet. He knows it’s the calm before the storm, but he can’t help but enjoy this moment while it lasts.
Castiel bites his lip. “I, um. I told him about the… the auction house. Bringing you home.”
Dean’s cheeks burn, but he can’t lie. “Yeah. Sorta. Can’t fuck it up if you’re the one doing it, you know?” He laughs nervously, but the sound doesn’t ring as happy.
He tries to count up the months and finds, depressingly, that he can’t. “Um. I don’t know.”
Castiel is well aware.
He feels his lips turn up in a bitter smile. It
A patronizing little smile snakes across Crowley’s face. “Just like I told your father, Peeping Tom,” he says condescendingly, “You won’t need to worry about little Sammy so long as dear old dad does his job.”
He touches it experimentally, and hisses – it does
His cheeks flush at the thought, but he can’t pretend it isn’t the truth. A slut, in more ways than one.
to an omega?” Balthazar presses, his tone sharp.
Dean hesitated a moment more, shifting back and forth on his feet. Ultimately, though, he decided that Cas could probably handle a little alone time.  “Alright. Give me a few minutes then.”
The alpha takes a breath, pasting on something that looks like a smile. Even then, it’s strained. “Perhaps the two of you could eat lunch together as well, if everyone is amenable. That will give Jody and I some time to research some mechanic shops in the area that might be willing to take you on as a student, in a few months.”
he wishes he was normal. Normal enough not to be terrified of his own body, normal enough to not be so fucked in the head that he falls head over heels for the exact person he shouldn’t. Normal enough that Cas might actually fucking love him back.
Balthazar smirks. “Well aren’t
There’s a comfortable silence between them for a while. “For all your father’s faults,” Cas says finally, something sad in his voice, “I’m glad he was there to teach you things.”
He runs the cloth over Dean’s short hair as well, washing away the sweat there as best he can, and abruptly he realizes that Dean is

The feeling, along with the alpha’s nap, persists into the late afternoon, and it’s enough to convince him to make his own meal for the very first time since he arrived here. His stomach has been rumbling for a bit, now, and Pamela’s friendly threat regarding his weight doesn’t hurt. So he abandons his current stack of books in the spare room, and pads over to the kitchen, wondering how over the line he’d be to try and make the burgers Cas had talked about before everything went to shit.
Balthazar makes a frustrated noise. In the background, Castiel can hear the ping of the elevator. “Dean knows he can trust you,” he says gruffly. “Don’t bother doubting that.”
There’s a bit of a pause, and then,

Suddenly, this is all too much. It’s too much that there’s a freed omega slave sitting right in front of him, too much that Cas seems to genuinely be his
“Hm?” Cas says, glancing at him in a distracted sort of way.
“Should I hold off, then?”
Cas, I thought…”
The alpha’s voice is smooth, calm, betraying nothing at all, and Dean can’t make himself stand anymore while his master is seated. He takes a few steps into the room and kneels, thankful once again that the plush rug in the living room is mirrored here. He feels his anxiety fade a little once he’s on the floor where he’s supposed to be; once he feels the soft, plush pillow against his stomach.
Dean wants to laugh, he really does. As if he has control over how anyone speaks to him, as if he has control over
Dean thinks there’s quite the case of fan worship going on here, and it’s a little funny. It’s better than Claire’s blatant suspicion, anyway. And it’s much closer to what Cas actually deserves.
“But I digress,” Balthazar continues. “I’m guessing, now that we’re past the whole song and dance, that you’d like to talk shop?”
he’s willing to bet that he’s been missed every day since.
They return to their meal for a while, eating silently. Castiel searches for the right thing to say, and, perhaps predictably, comes up short.
Dean can’t stop touching his neck.
“I do.”
Castiel, who had already gotten a few steps ahead of him, turns around with a distracted look on his face – but when he smells Dean’s fear, the look sharpens into concern. Dean can only meet his eyes for a split second before he drops his gaze to the tile, abruptly feeling the
“You’re doing so well right now, Dean. I know this is difficult. Thank you,” he murmurs, and Dean visibly shudders with relief. Castiel’s stomach twists. “I’m not going to punish you for anything you’ve done today.” Or anything he will ever do, but clearly Dean’s ability to believe those words is severely limited.
Sam forces himself to chuckle. It sounds like it’s coming from someone else, someone far away. “I guess not. That’d be, uh…”

Cas settles in next to him, after a moment. Far enough away that Dean knows he isn’t going to try and reach out again – he doesn’t know whether to be relieved or heartbroken. He closes his eyes. Feels guilt rising in his stomach like bile. He’s shaking. Hands grabbing his own hair.
“We’re looking to get something engraved, you do that here?” he asked lightly, trying not to sound too desperate or too interested. This was, after all, a business transaction.
“Then you will,” Castiel says, and it’s the easiest promise he’s ever made.
“Oh, Dean,” he says, and he comes closer. Wraps his arms around the trembling man next to him, holds him to his chest. And Dean only lasts a moment before he turns into him, burying his face into Castiel’s neck and hitching out a sob.

The young blonde’s lips press together. “More than one way to skin a cat,” she mutters. “Answer your damn phone, would you?”
Crowley turns around with a surprise as he skids to a stop in front of them. The alpha behind him looks down his nose at Dean, a bored, uninterested expression on his face. “That’s the other kid,” he says absently, before sliding into the driver’s seat and rolling down the window to half listen.
Dean chuckles. He reaches up, wraps his palm around the back of Castiel’s neck in a gesture of soft affection. “I missed him so
“Are you… are you

Dad has been drinking.
The flicker of panic on Balthazar’s face is enough for Sam’s rage to rekindle, though it’s doused by fear just as fast. One phone call, and this Novak man could disappear forever, could probably even prosecute Sam for the snooping he and Charlie have done, if they’ve noticed it...
He closes his eyes.
Dean shrugs. This is so different from the first time Pamela checked him out. He isn’t terrified anymore, for one thing, and he knows that he can keep some things to himself without getting in trouble. But he figures that they’ll both be happiest with him if he tells the truth, so he decides not to fib.

“Yes,” she confirms. It’s all too obvious that she knows exactly what he’d been thinking about. “It works a bit like a stud finder.”
“But…” He takes in a shaky breath. “Fuck, Pam. I don’t want him doing this just because he thinks he

Dean remembers past abuse at Alastair's. Specifically, he flashes back to instances of forced/unwilling orgasm, along with the punishments that Alastair inflicted on him for achieving orgasm without being directed to do so. That particular flashback includes non-consensual over-stimulation, blatant manipulation, sadism, and suicidal ideation.

good idea for you to see Benny,” he says, and Dean grimaces, “I’ve no intention of forcing you into it before you’re ready.”
Careful to continue the even strokes of his thumb along the omega’s nape as he does so, Castiel hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder and slowly dips the washcloth in and out of the water. He works methodically to smooth away fear, and hurt, and shame. Dean doesn’t so much as twitch when Castiel runs the cloth over his chest, along his collarbone, under his ears. He just sighs and tips his head back further, allowing Castiel unfettered access to his throat. It’s a gesture of absolute
“Nah. You were in the room, but you didn’t, uh. Touch me. You were just…”
at himself, at the world, and at the alpha. He remembers yelling his damn fool head off. Remembers Cas coming into the room. Remembers the gentle warmth and weight on the mattress next to him.
Relief hits him with the approximate force of a train, and his sharp exhale is enough to catch Dean’s attention. He looks up, fumbling with the book and flushing as if he’s embarrassed, and is already half hiding it behind the mattress when he catches Castiel’s no doubt tumultuous scent.
He’s beyond worrying that

He kneels in the kitchen for breakfast, kneels in the office for lunch if he doesn’t sleep right through it. Kneels in the living room for dinner. He carries around the green pillow his master had given him everywhere he goes and tries not to think about how much he must look like a toddler with a security blanket.
Dean nearly chokes.

being inappropriate, and Dean’s the one creeping into the alpha’s room while he’s dead to the world.
Dean is light, lighter than Castiel thought possible for a grown man, and it makes that same fury rise in his chest again as he thinks about the cruelty the omega has faced over the years. Cradling his head against his heart as he climbs the stairs, he moves slowly, his grip careful as he thinks about the bruises and the whip marks littering his skin.
So Cas’s wings deteriorated. Sure, he tried his best, but anatomically, there were just too many places he couldn’t reach. Then there was the war in Heaven, the Apocalypse, Lucifer. One fight after another. Cas barely had the time to

lashed out – he wasn’t wrong. He’d attacked Castiel with a mindless, rabid ferocity, with not even a second’s hesitation. But Castiel didn’t blame him for that. How could he? Dean had spent decades of his afterlife fighting. He hadn’t known that Castiel was there to help him.
getting high on whatever happy alpha pheromones Cas is giving off right now, and his admission does nothing but strengthen them. He grins. “Got it out of the laundry.”

related to you. I would expect nothing less.”
“Cas?”
Cas stares at him, something like concern appearing on his face. Probably for Dean’s sanity.
Dean was standing in the doorway of the library, looking sleep mussed in his pyjama bottoms and t-shirt, hair sticking up everywhere. He wore a horribly broken look on his face, and Castiel’s heart twisted at the sight.
The omega winces. “I…. I don’t know. I messed up a lot, before. All the time.” His back is hunched, taut, and his spine is prominent against the fabric of his shirt. And all Castiel can think about are the crisscrossed crimson and white lines he’d seen on Dean’s lower back, a hundred awful badges for all the bravery the young man has been forced to show. He wants to argue, wants to tell Dean that
how hard and how fast Castiel has fallen for him. It confuses him,
Dean swallows. “You
Castiel lets out a breath, his smile returning. “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel is staring at him, clearly confused. “Are you alright?”
“I am not upset with you,” he starts with, and he swears that Dean relaxes at that, his shoulders slumping minutely. “You will never be in trouble for expressing how you feel.”
Yet, as much as he does
“Not all people,” Castiel says softly.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. “How do you know that?” he asks, because it sounds like Cas
and not because he thinks that doing so will make Cas want to keep him. His head is screwed on straight, now – he’s calmer. He knows Cas won’t drop him back off at auction, collar or no collar, obedience or no obedience. God, even the idea of it feels patently insane; he’s got no clue how he actually believed that before. He knows better.
Cas winces. “A… a danger to anyone else. They have to be sure that you won’t... ” he swallows, eyes flicking away, “That you aren’t planning to…”
Inevitably, though, Dean would end up paying dearly for daring to pretend he was something he was not. Daring to pretend he had a right to anything at all.
He points to his neck. Bare. Pale, where unbruised and unchafed. Such a fragile thing. “I think me getting collared again will help us both. Because neither one of us seems to be able to remember how this shit is supposed to go. Neither one of us can – can just...”
he doesn’t. He’d tried to find the words to explain that. Had tried to get out the reassurances that Dean so desperately needed to hear. But there’d been something stuck in his chest, lodged in the way of his voice. Something awful keeping him mute.
He feels like he’s being pulled in two separate directions. Part of him is terrified out of his
“Yes, you’re in the bath. I’m trying to get your temperature back down, and Pamela suggested this as a possible remedy,” he explains, patiently repeating himself.
What happened?”
“Come back?”

It hits Castiel, then, that Dean cares very much about this. It should have been obvious. The only times he’s ever stood his ground and argued with Castiel, after all, is when he feels strongly about something. Dean is hungry to be understood. He tries his best, takes a step back, removes his biases as Dean goes on.

So he has no choice – he
“I always do. So, Cas,” Dean said, switching the subject as fast as he could; he recognized that tight look on the kid’s face, and it wasn’t a wound he was interested in picking at. “You said you had a compromise?”
Dean bumps his shoulder gently and turns back to Novak with that same soft smile. “Come on, Cas,” he needles. “You need to eat too. Drop the whole brooding alpha shtick and get some grub.”
the kid taunts, sneering at Dean. “Are you his attack dog, now?”
“Please don’t make me stop,” Dean interrupts, his heart already pounding at the thought. “Please. I can’t just sit around doing nothing. It’ll drive me crazy.”
When they’re alone in the kitchen, he cocks his head back and stares at the younger omega appraisingly. “Nice to see you haven’t run for the hills.”
“I don’t need you,” he says, his words oddly distant and flat.
The omega’s face clouds with confusion. Probably to ask a question, he opens his mouth, but he just closes it again after a moment. “Yes, alpha,” he finally says, clearly lost.
“Do not thank me, Dean. You do not know what I have done. What this means.”
always keep his word, just like he said – always keeps his promises, and always follows through on his threats.
– not without scaring his brother. Sam doesn’t understand yet, and he’d see something completely different if Dean were to do something like that now.
He takes it tentatively. The fabric is smooth under his fingers, and the padding is thick enough to where he can already tell that it’s going to be one hell of an improvement over the floor. He scoots it underneath himself, and when he looks up at Cas with a grin, the alpha looks inexplicably nervous.

Castiel smiles, very tremulous and more than a little guilty. “I dislike what it says about me. But, yes. Very much so.”
is going on.
He moves slowly. Predictably. What’s left of their food gets set on the table to the side, and Castiel arranges himself so that his back is against the armrest. Dean, he pulls against his chest, his arms encircling him protectively. The omega just lets himself be moved, his body sort of limp.
What in the world would Dean be so scared of that he’d revert back to how he’d been before? What would make him think Castiel would violate his wishes, or his space? “Dean–”
“Please.” The word bursts out of him, cutting his master off. “Please, uh. Come in.”
Dean closes his eyes, hooking his hands behind his head and leaning into the cold spray of the shower. He doesn’t want this.
Pamela’s gaze is critical and unreadable, and he tries not to squirm under it. “There
And, in the back of his mind, he knows that he had avoided thinking about it on purpose. Because if he doesn't belong to Cas... how can Dean expect to stay with him? How can he expect Cas to actually
He follows the omega out of the elevator and down the hall to the first office. They pass through a smaller room, with a secretary desk of sorts. There’s a young Asian man – a beta – sorting papers into different piles; he gives them a friendly, if strained smile as they walk past. Balthazar waves at him, but doesn’t say anything, and when Sam glances over his shoulder the kid is staring at him with a blatantly wary expression that he quickly wipes away, dropping his eyes down to his desk instead.
“Course,” he insists, pressing in a little tighter. “You make me feel safe.”
Castiel smells… comforting. Sweet and grounding, almost
he’s angry. Even now, in the midst of it, he suspects it’s because he’d be crying if he wasn’t. “Just – don’t, Cas.”
“He wouldn’t hide from me,” Sam says stubbornly, and again Castiel can see past the alpha aggression. There’s something desperate there, something painful. “He wouldn’t.”
He waits for the fear scent, for Dean to cover the nape which Castiel is perilously close to touching, but he gets neither. His scent is still
to thank and repay him for everything he’s done. Alone time will be good.
“Practice,” he replies, tone suddenly serious. “Practice, and a shit ton of therapy.”
Still, he’d made himself linger downstairs for a while, fixing himself a cup of tea so he could calm down and center himself. He needed to be Dean’s rock, his safe harbor, and he couldn’t do that if he was anxious himself. It had been a good plan, right up until Dean had shot downstairs and barreled toward him like a homing pigeon.
So, instead, he just

He’d been secluded for so long that he hadn’t known any of the regular pleasure slaves who had died, but he’d felt sad for them anyway, knowing that they’d had an abrupt end to a miserable life. Dean had never resented them, though he’d tried – it wasn’t
After all these months, it’s the first time he’s gotten to wake up to Cas’s sleeping face.

Dean laughed a sharp, loud bark. “I think you’re the one who drew the short straw, there,” he said flippantly. But Castiel could tell by the way he was biting his lip, by the way his arms crossed around him, that Dean was more upset than he was letting on.

Sam to read, staying up late under the covers of whatever shitty motel or apartment they were in with a flashlight and an arsonel of stupid voices for each of the characters, pride flowing through him when Sam had been able to take over and they’d taken turns reading chapters together.
Smiling to himself, he sets it on the counter. “That’s a lot easier than rewinding a tape,” he says with a grin, and Cas gives him a soft smile.
“If you
Then, not really knowing why, he opens up the internet, and plunges in.
His voice is so
of all places, where it matters the most.
He tries to keep his voice low and soothing, tries to keep the nerves out of his tone, and that seems to help. Dean’s breath slows a little, his hand going out to the table next to the door to keep him steady. His voice is weak when he speaks. “Dinner?”
She pauses, and it’s a heavy silence. “Samuel Winchester, you listen to me. I need you to

Dean flinches, instantly opens his mouth to respond – likely to apologize
Eventually, Scott shifted topics, digging into what he and Sam did for a living – asking about this or that monster, gasping with just the right level of enthusiasm every time Dean confirmed the existence of yet another of their childhood boogeymen and fantasies. They asked about angels, about vampires, about hunting in general – and, for once, the brothers felt like they could answer truthfully. It was clear that Scott was hungry for knowledge, and since they’d already been possessed, it wasn’t like they needed to keep many secrets from them.
Dean does so as if on autopilot, his eyes still unfocused and his limbs uncoordinated. He rises with the omega and steadies him, pressing their palms together. “Into the kitchen.”

inside him is howling, snapping, telling him to return to his omega and hold and claim and protect. And that’s exactly why he leaves, shutting the door behind him and padding carefully down to his office. He refuses to risk hurting Dean by giving in to those instincts.
I’d probably have flunked out. What makes you think I’m capable of getting a
“That was an important first step,” the alpha continues, his touch never hesitating. Never slowing. “And a very brave thing to do. When you want to take the next step... when you’re ready to call Sam... we can do so together.”
Dean closes his eyes, his jaw clenching. He doesn’t look like he believes Castiel in the slightest, and he can’t exactly blame him for that doubt. Not after what he’d said, after how he’d reacted.
Claire holds her head a little straighter, staring him in the eye – though she can’t quite hide the blush that springs to her cheeks. “That,” she says haughtily, “is irrelevant.”

lucky that the networks in Berkeley had been determined to paint him as a heroic figure instead of a radical – as much as he hadn’t wanted the attention, it at least hadn’t been the kind that would have gotten him kicked out of his school and blacklisted from others.
“I was… passed along. When his sire died. And after my ill-conceived escape attempt, the twins weren’t really interested in keeping a flight risk. I was foisted onto Gabriel, who also turned out to be... uninterested.” He grimaces. “Only, Gabriel didn’t have the guts to sell me on when he tired of me. He freed me instead.”
Hoping for anything at all to focus on besides his less than stellar childhood, he sighs and looks back out the window. The parking garage they’re in is vast, mostly empty, folks passing by every once in a while to get to the elevator that will take them down to the store. None of them pay him any mind. It’s just before noon on a week day, and Dean figures that ain’t exactly prime time for people to do their shopping. It’s just as well; anyone that strays too close to Cas’s car makes him tense up, gripping the armrest a little too firmly.

As soon as the thought forms in his head, the door opens, and Cas is back.
yes. Feels
He bites his lip. Decides he can afford to be a little more honest.
“It’s alright,” Cas rumbles, and his words sound so final and sure that for a moment Dean can’t help but want to believe him. But he knows better than that.
It hits him like a tidal wave, the realization.
Castiel closes his eyes. He feels like he’s going to be sick. His
Dean’s breath hitches. His hand darts up to cover his mouth.
Once again, Dean has effortlessly seen through him, has burrowed down to the root of his insecurities. Castiel takes a deep breath, considering his words. “I do not like scaring you,” he finally says, not sure what else to say.
There was a time where Cassie’s door was revolving, for how often he was coming and going. The alpha had given him a key after just a few days of his initial stay in this house, and he’d never asked for it back, even after he’d moved out. Balthazar had also never offered. It has become one of many silent understandings between them, one of a million unspoken exchanges of trust.
Cas looked steadily at Dean, really
After that, Castiel had given up leaving the bed for anything short of nature’s call, and he’d not been sorry about
He also learns, sort of by accident, that a lot has changed for people like him.
He knows Cas catches a whiff of terror because his voice is sharp when it comes through the door. “Dean?”
Dean glanced at Cas out of the corner of his eye. The angel was looking innocently at the middle distance, his hands clasped lightly in front of him, but he could see the tension in his shoulders. Whatever it was that had been bothering Cas last night was clearly still bothering him now, and he wasn’t real keen on dumping the angel in a room with a moody teenager on top of it.

Permission to touch him, something he doesn’t need and shouldn’t even want to ask for. But he is. The alpha’s blue eyes study him, squinting when Dean lets out a nervous breath.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, swinging a leg over Castiel’s hips and planting himself firmly down. “Shut up and kiss me.”

“I – Cas… My, uh – I’m –”
As soon as Cas is gone, he strips. Fumbles his way out of his already dampened clothes, hands shaking, a whine building in the back of his throat the farther his alpha gets. He wants Cas to be here. Cas

inside of him, and strapped that down too. And he’d left Dean all alone.
He knows very little, but he tries to list it off in his head. Cas is well off, obviously, and has been for his whole life, according to what Balthazar told him. He’s an unmated alpha at an age where most people have paired off, if they’re ever going to. He spends all his time working on the computer, lives out in the middle of nowhere, and the only friends Dean has heard him mention seem to consist of an omega ex-slave, a doctor, and a therapist. All of whom he pays. Cas has not mentioned any family, has not said anything about how or where he grew up. Has not even told Dean, really, what he
Balthazar answers the phone grumpily. “So help me
He’s not in Hell.
Castiel stands in the kitchen with his hand clenching and unclenching into a fist at his side. The empty paper bags on the counter hurt to look at. The distant fury in his friend’s voice hurts to hear. He deserves the pain, he knows. “I very nearly got him assaulted.”
“You can take that off, now,” Pam says absently, rifling through her bag as she speaks. When he hesitates, she adds, “The heat scent isn't going to take you by surprise again, and he’s far enough away that it won’t send you running automatically. So long as you keep ahold of yourself, that is,” she says wryly.
And just for a moment, he lets himself admit that – lets his imagination go wild.

Hands shaking hard enough that he can hardly direct them, he thumbs through the rest of the papers, looking for the last tab of the bunch. He doesn’t want to be reminded of all the steps between the first and Alastair, doesn’t want to see his gradual decline into brokenness. When he finds it, he forces himself to flip to the page, forces himself to look.
“Alpha,” he starts, and his voice is weak even to his ears, so he clears his throat and tries again. “Alpha, what… what am I supposed to do?”
“Quit hovering over the kid,” Balthazar snipes, and Dean shoots him an honest-to-God
Dean lets out a breath, nerves dissipating. “Oh. So, then, uh. How did you…”

is like – get skirted around in a skittish, almost nervous way. The only reason that doesn’t make Sam sick to his stomach is that Dean’s muteness doesn’t seem to be borne of fear. It seems more like his brother is unsure of how to fill the silence.
“But…” his eyes move slowly from the collar to Castiel himself, still too empty, still too blank. “I don’t… you said… you were gonna train me.” His voice is weak, strangled. Too afraid for hope.
“Because if you do, then you’re not just recovering for
He wonders, belatedly, what exactly the slave doctors listed in the file might have done to Dean to make his scent this terrified. He’s so stupid to have not thought about it before.
Scott sat up straight, leaning forward across the table with a sudden fever in their eyes. “I want that. I want that
Cas considers his words carefully. “No. I don’t think so,” he says slowly. “In… in relationships,” he tries, stumbling over the word a little – it’s Dean’s turn to feel smug, when Cas blushes a bit. “Or, uh. Partnerships. That are
Since Dean has moved in, though, he’s struggled. It’s no fault of the omega’s, and he holds no resentment toward him. He’ll trade sleep for Dean’s presence any time. But it doesn’t change the result – he’s exhausted, and staring at tiny, flickering numbers in tiny, flickering boxes is quickly becoming impossible.

They’d both known he should have been there, last night. And if they’d downed one too many shots because of it, Ellen and Jo hadn’t seemed to mind. In fact, they’d likely been the ones to usher them to bed and dump the rest of the liquor down the sink – he can still see the glass bottle tipped into the drain. Probably a good call.

honest about his intentions, if a bit nervous. He reminds Castiel of himself, a bit, back when he’d first been trying to earn Balthazar’s trust. He’d been nervous, too, and probably just as unsure of himself.
Dean’s throat tightens.
Eventually, he pulls himself from the sofa, stretches his arms over his head, and pads upstairs for a shower. He expertly avoids his reflection as he undresses – same thing he’s done every day since the first night he was here – and hops in, the warm water cascading over his shoulders and head. He scrubs up without really looking down at himself, still unprepared to see what his body looks like in the bright bathroom light. At least the bruises from the cane are gone. Nothing but a bad memory now.
He blinks open his eyes, focusing sluggishly on Castiel’s face. “I’m… I don’t…”
He thought that he’d been bought as a plaything, or worse. Freedom was not even a thought in his mind, Sam – contacting you wasn’t something he could even begin to consider.” Castiel shakes his head. “I didn’t know you existed until he started trusting me enough to tell me.”
but Charlie beats him to the punch. “Look,” she continues, sounding a little bit nervous all of a sudden. “I didn’t want to tell you this because I didn’t want to… I don’t know, set you off on a self-destructive spiral or something,” she half jokes. “But I figure it’s better than you driving out there. I found a number for the place.”
Dean mentally corrected himself –  nodded, standing up with Sam’s help. Dean stood as well, slightly alarmed by how much he towered over Scott as they shakily picked up their backpack and slid it over their shoulders. Kid was a pipsqueak.
“Dean?”
The alpha must sense his wariness, because he smiles that small reassuring smile. “Good morning, Dean. I see you’ve gotten an early start.”
to smithereens.
He gently pries the last blanket from Dean’s hand and plops it on the bed, and then leads Dean to the living room, depositing him on the couch. It’s not that he isn’t wary of doing so – knows how it affects Dean to be there alone for any length of time, and he has a sneaking suspicion that Dean would probably like to be on the floor right now. But Castiel has a plan.
His hand is shaking when he places upon Dean’s back. It’s the same anchoring touch that has worked to keep him calm so often in the past, and Castiel

He wants to feel savage satisfaction. Wants to feel victorious, or at least defiant. But he just feels nauseous. At least that weird fog in his brain is gone now. A rough laugh bubbles up out of him as he wipes furiously at his eyes.
“Yes. I don’t know him as well as you do, obviously, but he seems a little too spirited to want to stay in this limbo forever.” He suspects that there are some complications – some bits of guilt that the omega is carrying around. Bits of guilt that are convincing him he deserves this. Once he susses those out and sets him straight, he’s confident they’ll be able to start nudging Dean in the right direction.

Dean has ever experienced
in the presence of an alpha?
He slides the hoodie off of himself with difficulty, wincing as the fabric brushes against his injuries. His master inhales sharply and Dean’s eyes are on him immediately, arms jumping up to cross against his chest as though that will protect him. The air of the house is cold against his skin and goosebumps rise on his arms and neck. He’s glad that his pants sit high enough on his waist to hide the worst of the damage, but there’s plenty to look at anyway.
Dean’s brain skittered to a halt. “What do you mean?” he asked slowly, feeling only a hair less guilty.
“No,” he says, shaking his head. “I met her in college.”
The next morning, Sam woke them all up at the buttcrack of dawn. The four of them stumbled out of the motel and into the car at a genuinely offensive 6 am. Considering how late it had been when Dean and Scott had come back, Dean wanted to lay down and die. Judging by the nearly constant yawning, Scott did not seem to be far off either.
to be forgiven for this. Would pay
Castiel frowns, leaning over so he can examine Dean’s face properly. The omega looks spooked. His chest is moving a little faster.
Castiel can’t quite help the rough, tired laughter that produces. Dean’s shoulders shake a little – not really a laugh, but something close. It’s a step away from hysteria, something between exhaustion and relief.
“Dean is resilient,” Castiel says softly after a moment. “He’s healing. But I cannot lie and tell you that he wasn’t hurt very badly when we brought him here, or that he isn’t still recovering. That he won’t be recovering for a long, long time.”
“Well, alright then. What’s the problem?”
Scott’s voice, scratchy from sleep, made Dean sit up fully. He turned around, rubbing the grogginess from his eyes. The kid was staring out the window with a contemplative look on their face. “Just for a little while. I wanna check out something here, if we can.”
“You gonna let me in on it, or do I have to beg?”
. He hasn’t given anyone permission to do
and… this is dangerous for you.” Dangerous because Cas had no hold on his heart. No way to control the desire to pull Dean close. To press his hand over Dean’s heartbeat and his lips to Dean’s jaw.
“I just want you to tell the doctor the truth. You don’t have to worry about what I’ll think, or what you think we might want to hear. Just the truth. Can you do that?”
“He has a right,” he says quietly. “You know he does. He’s… suffered. Because of them.”
“Dean?”

Dean looks down at his hands. “Someday soon, I know I’ll want the same thing you do,” he adds, sounding small. “I
The beginning of the omega’s newfound freedom had not been spent pleasantly, he knows. Balthazar has told him enough, has used his own life and misfortune as a cautionary tale for them all to learn from – to teach Castiel, in particular, the importance of creating support systems rather than freeing slaves and being done with it, as he’d wanted to do at first. Had taught him about what can happen to a slave that is abandoned with nothing but a bare neck or a flimsy sheet of paper proving that they’re free.
“But– But he wouldn’t just–”
Now, Cas is slowly carding his fingers through Dean’s hair, and Dean’s eyes are half closed, and he can feel sleep starting to wrap around him like a fuzzy, warm blanket. The characters may as well be speaking in Portuguese, because he has no idea what anyone on screen is saying. All he knows is that he’s comfortable, he’s safe, and he doesn’t have to be afraid.
His friend is quiet long enough that even Castiel can pick up on the fact that he’s messed up in some way. “What did I do?”

I was…”
That doesn’t exactly make him feel better. He opens his mouth to tell her as much, but she cuts him off.
“Okay. Then you’ll stay,” he reassures, and Dean lets out a breath. He seems to sag against Castiel, not really holding himself up anymore. Castiel spares a moment to be thankful for Pamela – what would have happened if he’d stayed outside? If he’d made Dean leave, or if he’d left himself?

Sam drops his eyes after a while, looking fragile in the silence. He scrubs at his face and fixes his eyes on the floor.
“I very much doubt he’s planning on going anywhere,” Castiel replies. He presses his closed lips to the crown of Dean’s head, and the omega hums happily; Castiel can’t find the will to feel guilty about that even with Dean’s brother less than a dozen feet away. “Should I invite him to stay with us?”
him?”
That thought scares the shit outta him. He just isn’t that lucky – never has been. His luck is
Dean shrugged, completely oblivious to the weight of the moment. “Couldn’t. Nightmares.” He said it easily, like the knowledge that he was suffering didn’t completely shatter Castiel’s heart. Under any normal circumstance, Cas would be allowed - expected - to be there by Dean’s side. To hold him and comfort him and chase away the darkness. But this wasn’t any normal circumstance, because Dean was Castiel’s mate, but Castiel was not Dean’s.
She whips her eyes to Castiel, her mouth in a thin line. He cringes, waiting for the inevitable accusation, but when she does speak it’s with a cool indifference. It isn’t fooling him for a second. “I’ve got some stuff in stock that might work. Gimme a sec’.”

“I’ve said something that is upsetting you,” he says, his tone bordering on helplessness. “What did I…”
Dean watches him for a beat, then leans to his side. Sits down on the ground, off his knees, legs tucked under him.
But, with a herculean effort, he ignores those desires, and he goes to find what Pamela instructed him to instead.
“I don’t think it’s broken,” he protests, frowning. He’d know. He’s plenty familiar with what broken bones feel like.
“Dean, I–”
He swallows, eyeing the wand apprehensively. “It doesn’t… it stays outside. Yeah?”
Trigger warnings for the chapter are in the notes below. They're comparatively mild to the last few chapters, but I still wanted to include them.

Benny nods slowly. He looks… understanding. Not like he is disgusted by him, which is more than he’d hoped for, but just like he gets it. Hell, he might. He deals with enough fucked up people like him that maybe this is a problem he’s seen before. “So you’re experiencing these urges on your own for the first time now.”

But Castiel just blinks. “Oh. Well, that won’t be an issue. Balthazar is an omega.”
He tried to apologize, but he doesn’t think that the man had understood.
Even though it makes him feel far too exposed, Dean swallows his discomfort and strips off his shirt to hold it to his face. It’s ruined anyway, and he’s pretty sure that spreading the scent of omega

been scared – terrified, actually – of how his master would hurt him, of how he would be punished for his behavior with the doctor, of what the alpha might do with a sex slave he’d been told not to have sex with.

But he hadn’t fought the man’s touch, hadn’t growled or even tried to move away. He’d just… let it happen.
Castiel winces. Traditionally, they tend not to tell omegas that their ultimate goal is freedom right away. That hadn’t been his decision – he’d been ready to tell them from day one. But at the urging of both Balthazar and Benny, he’d changed that particular policy. Omegas at the center only learn they are there to be freed when they are comfortable. When they trust the staff. It usually takes upwards of a couple of weeks, sometimes three.

because it had nowhere to go. I didn’t know what to do with it.” Balthazar says nothing. He takes a breath. “Even after that alpha had been… taken care of, even after Dean was safe, I wanted to tear that man limb from limb.”

had been done to this man behind those doors, something bad enough to break his fighting spirit.
It really shouldn’t surprise him, he thinks. There is nothing about Dean that isn’t deserving of love. He is kind, and brave, and selfless, and he’s beautiful inside and out. He’s strong, and that strength… it fills Castiel with longing, with something aching and wonderful and bright, every time he looks at Dean and sees it in his eyes. He doesn’t know how he could know Dean and

“I’m still staying with him, dude,” Dean interrupts, shaking his head. “Thanks, though.”
Cas stops mid-sentence, his mood dropping so quickly that it’s jarring. He’s still staring down at the paper, but his hands are gripping it a little tighter. “Ah. Right. I… managed to forget this part,” he says, the words small. “That’s what I get for leaving these sorts of things to Jody.”
He steps forward slowly, crouching in front of the omega and swallowing an apology when he cringes lower, away from his alpha scent and his alpha hands. As gently as he can, he picks up the abandoned blanket and drapes it around Dean’s shoulders because, honestly, he doesn’t know what else to do.
This is going
things in that short window of time where he is awake and calm. Castiel has found, through trial and error, that the best time to get Dean to eat and drink are during those periods. The reason for this, unfortunately, is that Dean seems quite keen to do most anything… as long as Castiel asks it of him.
Then, like sounds after an explosion, muffled and hardly discernible over the ringing in his ears, Sam’s next words filter through. Dean feels each one like bullets to the chest, searing and loud and
When they finish eating, Bobby gathers up their dishes and does them silently, waving at Sam dismissively. “Go and find yourself a project, kid,” he says, his voice kind, despite the clear order. “Get yourself busy and get out of your head.”
He protects Dean, and he’s strong, and he’s trustworthy, and he’s… he’s friggin’ amazing. And he believes that Cas will never, ever hurt him, not even if they were to – well. Dean flushes at the thought alone.

Cas’s mouth twitches at his persistence. “Practice. There are well-vetted alphas at the campus who I trust. Ones you can interact with at your pace, when you’re willing to meet them. And we go from there.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted, the low rumble of his voice going
He flushes at the thought. God, who the fuck is he? Some blushing omega housewife, just waiting to be swooped up by their big, strong alpha? He’s not that type of person. Never has been.

pleased, his approval warming the words into something as comforting as a fresh slice of pie. “That’s exactly what I wanted, Dean.”
He stares at the mess for a while, debating with himself, but in the end, logic convinces him to move forward. He won’t be a burden – he’s got to show he can be of use, even if it’s just for little things like this.
“Yeah,” Dean snorts. Of course he does – it isn’t news to Dean that there are awful people in the world. He
“All I know is that he’s smart,” Sam said, sighing as he pushed his hair back and glanced up and down the street. “Possessing a child...”
Hannah looks between them, takes in Dean’s averted eyes and Castiel’s hand on his shoulder, and nods slowly. “Right.” She eyes the oversized jacket Dean’s wearing, her gaze sharp. “I’m going to need to take your measurements, if that’s okay.”
“Relax,” he coaxes, hands held low where the omega can see them. Far from Dean’s collar. “Take a breath. Just relax.” He tries to make his scent soothing, tries to convey with his tone and his posture that he isn’t a threat, no matter how much of one Dean sees him as. “It’s very cold out here, Dean,” he says slowly, careful not to move forward and spook him more, “and it’s quite warm in the house. Don’t you think it would be nice to go inside?”
Dean folds down on himself, dragging his knees to his chest. “You hope.”
He gasps in and out, feeling stupid, feeling weak, like a naive
He tries to reason with himself. Tries to make excuses. It was bound to happen sooner or later, right? Sleeping every night with Cas was gonna affect him no matter what he did. Hell, even
Dean, it turns out, isn’t sleeping either.
His good mood fades a little with the thought of John. God, he hopes Sam got away from him as fast as he could. Without Dean there to protect him, he’s not sure what the kid’s childhood must have looked like.
“The person that owned you, before. Did you call him master?”
Dean stares at him, a little caught off guard, but the expression that creeps onto his face is hopeful. “You can ask me whatever you’d like, Dean. Nothing is off-limits, and I swear that I will not punish you for anything you say.” He doesn’t know how much that promise is worth to the omega, but his scent eases minutely. Relief softens his face, easing the tension there more than Castiel has ever seen before. He nods.
A young Asian man, on the nerdy side, is looking at him with a slightly too eager expression on his face. There’s a plastic ID card clipped to his shirt, so Dean figures he must work here. “I haven’t seen you around! If you want, I can show you how to get food…?”
“Can we stop?”

A breath he didn’t know he was holding hostage bursts out of him. He takes a shaky, hungry gulp of the cold air. Fights back a wave of something feral and furious, a chill crawling up his spine. The woods are spinning around him.
And then, with a sudden sparkle of mischief in his eyes, Cas pulls him in for a
He forces the last word out like he’s unsure. Not about whether or not Castiel is one, he thinks - hopes - but about whether what might have happened could qualify as rape in the first place. He’s not about to dive back into that argument, not right now, when Dean is hanging on to his composure by a thread.
It rings for about half a beat before Charlie’s excited voice floats over the line. “Sam! Tell me there’s good news, bud!”
His master taps the counter, considers what he’ll say before he says it like he so often seems to. “Would it help you if I told you that I have plenty of food, and that the only expectation I have is that you eat as much or as little as you please? That anything in the kitchen is available to you anytime you wish, and nothing is off limits?”
Sam doesn’t need to deal with any of that.
Of course Castiel had heard the stories, told and retold by his brothers and sisters about the moment a mating bond is fully formed. He’d heard all about the rush of energy. The opening of a channel. The two separate Graces intermingling. Changing. Growing together and fusing in a way that was inseparable by neither Heaven, Earth, nor Hell.
up until he realizes that he’s going to have to go to sleep all by himself. The thought, for some reason, is enough to drive him out of his room and back downstairs.
the price is. Fuck, I’ll – I’ll do anything.
“Alright.” Castiel can’t help but place his hand back on Dean’s cheek for a moment, thumb stroking him gently. Dean sighs and presses into it with a telling tremble. “I’ll be… I’ll be downstairs.”
He doesn’t say any of that, but he thinks Dean understands it anyway. The kid really
obviously. So, instead, he pulls himself out of bed and goes to take a shower of his own.
He’s not that clueless. He types his reply defensively, annoyed with the idea that Balthazar thinks he’s slow or something.
They end up on the ground, of course – Dean flops himself right back in their nest, and Cas settles himself on the floor nearby. They’re both sprawled out, one of Dean’s ankles crossed over one of Cas’s. The point of contact is small, but enough to keep him mostly settled.
Balthazar holds his gaze for a few more seconds before he finally breaks his scalding glare away, rubbing at his temples with a frustrated huff.
Then she takes his pulse, puts the stethoscope on his back and chest and makes him breathe deeply. He coughs a little, but she says that’s probably from the smoke inhalation and he believes her. After all, it was the smell of the fire that had made him flail like a coyote in a trap.
“Go to sleep, Cas,” he says softly. The faintest trill of nervousness warns him that he’s probably overstepping his bounds, but for once, the tingling in his fingertips feels more like excitement than fear. “I’ll wake you up in a few hours.”
Hope all of you are doing fantastically, and I can't wait to hear what you think!
No. Of

to be that for him, you need to keep your head.”
There are two tags. The front one, in all capital, uniform letters, simply says
“I suppose so, yes. It wasn’t intentional. My line of work requires that I keep a low profile.”
Dean flinches back from his outstretched hand so badly that he slams his shoulder into the wall. Castiel stares down at him with wide eyes, frozen in place. “Dean?”
The instant he gives in and touches, fear knocks the breath out of him. His brain is flooded with
Castiel is left blinking in the room, alone. He hears Dean shut the bathroom door behind him. The shower flips on, and he’s mystified as to why for a few naive seconds before he realizes what must have happened. It seems that he hasn’t learned from the first time he did something similar.
“You’ve read them all,” Castiel reminds him, smiling a little when Bal huffs.
with his hand on his collar, but he doesn’t think the omega even knows that he’s crying. He still hasn’t let go of Castiel’s arm, his grip weak and his hands warm as sunlight.
The words make something catch in Castiel’s chest – set off a box full of fireworks stored in the neglected, abandoned parts of his heart.
When his knees begin to ache enough that he can no longer ignore it, Castiel regretfully shifts in place, jostling Dean a little. He makes a small noise of protest, but Castiel checks just to be sure. “Are you awake?”
“Whoa, now,” she says firmly. “You don’t need to be in here, Novak.”
Balthazar raises both eyebrows, as if amused. “Of course. You didn’t think we
Sam’s face is unreadable. Blank. It has, Castiel thinks, the same eerie emptiness that Dean’s does sometimes, the same hollowness that Bal’s does on occasion – a sudden and purposeful blankness as a form of self protection. “I don’t understand why you didn’t just look for us. His family. You

He takes a breath. “Where

“Not at all.

Since he doesn’t have tennis shoes, he decides to stay in socks. He’s not about to wander around in boots and shorts, thank you very much, and if he’s going to be sparring with Claire he figures he’d have to lose the things anyway. He’s only a little self conscious when he heads out, his clothes carefully folded and stacked inside a random empty locker.
But there’s no reason for him to be afraid – not of an omega. And, despite the lack of stereotypical omega head-ducking and shoulder-hunching, Balthazar definitely is one. He’s tall and lanky, but has a slightness and softness around his face that Dean immediately recognizes.The man is older than him, older than Castiel too, with graying blond hair and wrinkled crow’s feet.
Dean doesn’t react to that. There’s no spark of curiosity, no stubborn glint in his eye when he’s presented with a challenge. He just looks pale. Haggard. “A few months,” he repeats blankly. He stares out into the dark yard, his breath slowly clouding around him. “That’s it, huh?”
“I think you’re blind as a bat,” she says cheerfully, crumpling the paper that was wrapped around her food into a tight little ball. “And if I were you, I’d be checkin’ to be sure that he’s not gonna use that crush of yours to justify a bonding clause or somethin’.”
“Help me?” Dean’s voice is strangled. He doesn’t understand, clearly, and Castiel swallows.
He abandons his chair, aligns himself in front of Dean to ground him, get him back in the present. Dean doesn’t react in the slightest to his proximity – he is stiff, frozen, eyes too wide and breath too shallow.
“Right,” she says distractedly, as though she’s forgotten he’s an alpha. It wouldn’t surprise him if she had –
The front door shuts loudly. They’re going. They’re

certainly happened more than once. I can only imagine what he’s been through.” Castiel shudders, and Pam squeezes his shoulder in a mirror of his comforting gesture. “It’s going to be difficult.”
Balthazar snorts. “Kid isn’t used to not having a purpose, as morbid as that sounds,” he says, and Castiel winces. “In his world, uselessness is the ultimate sin. Nobody wants a slave that can’t give them
He takes a breath. Tries to get his thoughts back in order – he’s largely unsuccessful, but he can see the shattered remains of the bottles all over the place, shampoo pooling underneath the shards. “Glass. The, um. The bottles in the shower.”
Gently, he angles Dean’s face back into the crook of his neck so that he can inhale and ride the high of peace that comes with the alpha’s warm scent, sunshine after a downpour. He wraps his arm around Dean’s back and slides his hand against his ribs, palm flat and warm through his shirt, and holds him steady.
“Um. Hi. It’s, uh. It’s Dean,” he stutters out. “Sorry, um. If you’re busy. I just thought –”
He lets out a strangled laugh. “Thank you, Balthazar. For everything.”
Dean chuckled, raising an eyebrow as he looked back up. “Sure you wouldn’t, buddy.” Smirking, he reached forward as if to touch, but paused. “Okay, that’s different.”

fault, because he’s a broken omega that can’t take a knot like he’s supposed to.
Balthazar laughs at that, waving aside his apology. “I’d say so. Though I’d like to say that mine, at least in regards to Cassie, have been resolved. And yours?”
he can’t even finish his damn
“How’d you meet Cas?” he asks, changing the subject. He can’t help but wonder. The sight of Balthazar clapping Cas on the shoulder is still stuck in his mind’s eye. It’s clear they’re close.
Cas’s sharp gasp, can almost hear his heart accelerate. The touch on his nape jerks to a stop for a split second before the alpha moves so quickly that he
what he’s doing. What Dean is asking for.
When the alpha doesn’t answer right away, Dean looks up. Cas is… frozen. There’s no other way to describe it. His eyes flick away for a moment, cheeks flushing, and he clears his throat. “Um. That’s… that’s another avenue for emancipation, I suppose. So to speak.”
to be honest. “That’s just. Shit.”
Dean doesn’t answer. He doesn’t know where his voice is – all he knows is that he’s standing up, all of a sudden, and he’s walking outside, because he can’t. He can’t stay still. He has to move.
Dean whimpers quietly when Castiel picks him up, and from this angle nothing is left to the imagination. His boxers are soaked through in the back, tented at the front, and Castiel feels a pang of sympathy for the pure desperation Dean must be feeling right now. Castiel himself has certainly been left
Sam stares at him. Stares at his jacket, at the tags that are just visible around his neck. “Dean…”
It hits a little too hard. Sounds a little bit too much like Alastair, whispering in his ear about how he was
Castiel swallows. Shakes his head, and explains, “I am quite limited in regards to my movie knowledge, unfortunately. You might call me sheltered,” for what feels like the hundredth time.
Dean is still having trouble wrapping his head around the fact that the alpha wants to continue to cook for him, even though it’s been several weeks of him doing so. So, even though his stomach rumbles at the thought, he shakes his head. He really needs to work on being less trouble than he’s been. “That’s okay. I’m not hungry anyway.”
“Dean…” And, God, Dean looks up at him with those big green eyes, wide and scared. He doesn’t want to ruin this – but he can’t stop now. Can’t let Dean make this decision uninformed. “Balthazar pointed out to me that it’s very likely we’ve...”
Dean’s glad that Balthazar finally relented and agreed to take a breather; standing next to an alpha that looks like Sam does right now would make anyone uneasy, let alone an omega with his past. The omega had excused himself for “a bloody
for any length of time. It’s probably the first mistake out of many he’s going to make.
His heart pounds. Lie, or fess up? Which will be worse? The alpha waits patiently, his face unreadable.
“I don’t understand,” Dean finally allows himself to say. It’s a dangerous thing to do, questioning his master, but he can’t take not knowing. The thought that at any moment Castiel might send him off to someone new scares him more than being punished for disrespect, so he locks his eyes on the alpha’s throat. “Why does that matter to you?”
even though it belongs to one, and Dean wonders why even though he’s relieved at the extra confirmation that the alpha doesn’t spend any time here.

With his heart leaping into action in his chest, Castiel bolts upright, reaching out automatically to steady Dean. On the other side of the line, he can hear someone’s voice buzzing loudly and insistently, clearly demanding a response to something – but Dean doesn’t even blink. He just stares at nothing, utterly frozen, caught in a place where he can’t seem to hear anything at all.
“Yes, goddammit, I know,” Balthazar curses. “I thought you were some random alpha hot-head. We get them every once in a while – looky-loos who would find out what we do here. If we don’t catch them early and convince them otherwise, they spread the word that we’re freeing people, and that – that’d be bad,” he says distractedly, still staring at Sam like he’s not sure if he’s real. “I’ve always convinced them that we’re just another auction house,” he continues, looking pained. “And, in my defense – the few times I’ve had to do it, it’s
“I’m scared,” he blurts, and it feels good and bad to get that off of his chest. “I don’t know why.”

Complacent. He’s grown
The omega had been so terrified of the collar, and so terrified of the prospect of wearing it again, that Castiel cannot see how this will go well. Even though tags aren’t nearly as demeaning, they are still a mark of ownership – something, he feels, neither of them need to be reminded of. But, as he’s seen today, they have little choice.
Dean whined. “I’m

He has to protect Dean in the exact way he deserves to be protected, whether he thinks he can or not.
It trickles in that his face is stiff with dried tears. That his throat is sore.
But he feels that the omega might need to hear them – and those suspicions are confirmed when he lets out a tight breath, his shoulders slumping.
So he nods, if a little jerkily, and Sam smiles a watery smile. “He’s going to be so goddamn happy. I haven’t, uh. I haven't told him anything yet. Didn’t want to get his hopes up,” he says, and the careful fragility in his tone is enough to tell Dean that false hopes have hit them more than once.
The alpha’s awful possessiveness is something he will

He looks naked without something there. He
The omega’s mouth clicks shut at his outburst. For a moment, they just breathe, staring at each other, both shaking and frightened and bewildered.
It doesn’t stop Sam from seeing the omegas.
The reminder that his opinion matters that much to the alpha is enough to jumpstart him into talking. “You didn’t overstep.”
Holding his breath, he strokes himself in a jittery movement. The pleasure that ricochets through him is enough to make his damn toes curl, but of course it’s chased by the certainty that he shouldn’t be doing this at all. By the knowledge that this is ten kinds of fucked up. Dean keeps going anyway. He has to put a hand on the tile before long, has to lean forward and breathe harshly against the wall.

, and once it was over he could see why. Cas was standing, arms stretched towards them, breathing hard.
And that had held true for years.
By the time he returns to the room, shirt clutched in his hand like a live grenade, Dean has already made a startling amount of progress on his nest. He’s kneeling in the middle of the mattresses on top of the towel, tags swinging from his neck, blankets curled around him in careful, precise patterns that make no sense at all to Castiel. He’s got on the pair of boxers and nothing else, and his skin is dew soaked and fevered.

rushing out of him all at once. And even though he’d rather crawl straight into the dirt, he looks up and faces the alpha in the room. Stares Cas in the eyes, mouth trembling and body numb, has to meet his gaze after the horrible thing he just accused the man of.
“If you’ll pull that chair over here, we can get started with the virtual tour while we wait.”
Well. Now that he thinks about it, maybe there’s a reason that Cas hired a

isn’t enough, that the other omegas Castiel has worked to help aren’t important to him. And he’s ashamed to say he’s never thought of it that way before. That’s not how he feels – he knows that every life is precious, knows that every soul is valuable.
“Not sure I could punch my way out of a wet paper sack,” he jokes, to lighten the tension that’s started to grow in the air. “Not with these toothpick arms.”
Sure enough, Sam waits just until the sound of his footsteps fade before turning to Dean, urgency written all over his face. “Look, we can get out of here and be past the state line before he even knows where to start looking,” he says quickly, already halfway off the couch. “We can hide out till we can figure out how to free you, and then –”

It makes him love Cas all the more, each time they do this.

Eventually, the sobs taper off. Dean sags against him, exhausted, his breath hitching and uneven. Castiel continues to card his fingers through Dean’s hair soothingly.

He wants Cas to pin him with those cool, steady hands. Wants to feel that grip around his wrists again, around his waist. Wants the alpha’s weight pressed down on top of him, keeping him still, keeping him
him to strip himself bare. But now, Dean is doing so willingly. He’s opening his heart for Castiel to see, all on his own.
So he pushes away the agony at the thought of a Dean-shaped hole in his life, and clears his throat. “Once we start the process, it usually takes a few months at the very least. There’s all kinds of tests you’ll need to pass, evaluations you’ll need to score highly on.”
