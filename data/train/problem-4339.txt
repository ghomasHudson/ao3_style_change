Uncle Sam scoffs quietly.
His darling daughter ignores him. "I mean, what if you have family out there? What if you're already married?"
did while you were gone, huh?" Sam retaliates.
? Even so innocuous and casual and plausibly platonic, Dean has never, would never, bestow that particular kind of affection on Castiel.
Emma's quiet for a moment. A motorcycle or something must overtake her from the high pitched, loud roar that passes in her few seconds of silence. "About three hours. Dad-"
"Dean?" Sam calls as he enters.
"Right." Dean chuckles quietly and keeps playing with Castiel's fingers. "So do you wanna like, make out or something?"
Emma looks to Uncle Sam, too, curious over his reaction.
Dean raises his eyebrows. "The hell do you know about 'actual' strippers?"
Claire takes another bite of the red velvet. "Maybe we should get two."
Emma likes driving. She's a lot like Dean, and he doesn't know how much of that is nature and how much is nurture. Aside from a lack of respect for Metallica (and don't think Dean didn't come close to disowning her over that) and Doctor Sexy, they have similar tastes in TV and music. She loves pie, though she can take or leave cheeseburgers. And she likes driving.
"For better or for worse," Cas says, with that goddamn smile on his face, eyes locked with Dean's unflinchingly.
Castiel looks back over towards the blanket, at Dean sipping on his beer and frowning down at his hands. "I should get back to him."
Again, there's no argument Castiel can make that isn't based on his own injured feelings. "Alright."
"We made it pretty clear last time that we don't want your help," Mrs. Tran continues.
"Charlie and I found a way to get here." She meets his eye. "And to get back again."
Emma's about fifteen or sixteen at a guess, and they're waiting it out to see if she's reached maturity. If she doesn't have another growth spurt in the next hour, he's promised they'll go out for ice cream.
It probably won't, it'll probably dry up fine, then come out in a regular wash. The damn thing's supposed to be dry cleaned, but Dean's pretty sure it could survive. He rushes to the men's room all the same and blots at it with tissues and tap water until his arm is soaked and he can't tell where the original area of the spill was.
"What?" Dean interrupts her. "What are you talking about?"
"Great," Dean says. He's getting married. It's all arranged and planned and the man in front of him is really gonna swear to love and cherish him for the rest of his life. Even is it fake.
"When does it end, Dean?" Sam says quietly, but no softer for the decrease in volume. "Say I stayed, say I kept hunting. When does it stop? When we run out of miracles and stay dead from whatever awful thing kills us? When we're eighty and hobbling around using shotguns as walking sticks? Don't we deserve a little normalcy? A little peace?"
Cas flicks a bittersweet smile his way, like maybe he's thinking about how his wedding should have been, if he'd had a choice over the when and who.
Dean's not dumb enough suggest taking care of his niece might've been a good tie to it all.
"Sounds good." Emma goes back to picking her way through half the breakfast menu.
It's with a little guilt and a far bit of embarrasment that Dean packs away the hoover and tries to drag the couch back into place as quietly as possible.
"Yeah, well." Dean doesn't bother to argue that. "There's always someone chasin' us."
Benny raises his eyebrows.
"Right," Sam says flatly.
"Go for it," he tells her.
Dad tries to call him first, finding some kind of disturbing voicemails from the guy in question in the process, which are doubled on the phone Uncle Sam stopped answering when Dad went missing. Kevin's old number no longer works, though, and Emma happens to know that his email address has been inactive for months. In person contact is the only way to go from there.
"Maybe." Emma looks him over. He's not been this neutral since long before the Lucifer hallucinations got bad. "I also have a really good memory, and my senses are a little better than the average person. I might heal a little faster, too, but I'm not sure on that one. I'm not any more durable than a regular human, that's for sure." She scowls as she remembers some of the nastier cuts and bruises from her training.
When that conversation dries up, and Emma's dessert arrives (Dean has no idea where she's putting it all now she's not having growth spurts), Emma pulls her Wonder Woman notepad out of her Wonder Woman bag and opens it up to show Sam. "Dad said you're better at Latin than he is. Do you think you could help me with my conjugation? I keep getting stuck."
Dean's mouth cracks into a smile in spite of the situation. "And ice cream."
Dean shrugs.
That earns her a sigh and rolled eyes. "The pact. Don't you pay attention to anything but sparring class? We get our strength from the pact. We honour it by making sacrifices. If we stop doing that we may as well let our people die out. We wouldn't be us anymore."
He pulls her into his arms. It's strange how every time he holds her she's changed so much since the last time, but it always feels the same. His baby girl, warm in his arms. And he never thought he'd be a sap about this crap, but he wouldn't trade her for anything, amazon or no. "You're a Winchester." It's not the most touching, reassuring thing he could have said, but it's true. And to him it's all that matters anymore.
Emma's voice is quiet but insistent when she speaks again. "I haven't killed anyone else. Anything else."
Dean still can't quite order the thoughts in his head. There's no words for how bashit freaking insane this is. Maybe this whole surreal day is just him finally having a psychotic break. Maybe the realisation that everything he ever wanted is stood two feet away from him was too much for him to handle. "How- What- You're dead!"
Dean doesn't speak for a long moment, and Castiel begins to believe that the spell will erase his memory before he says another word.
Wow. Seven months. Emma hadn't really thought about that. Another stretch of time that seems surreal in proportion to the rest of her life. She's officially spent more time with the Amazons than with Dad and Jody put together. She's not even a full year old yet.
Uncle Sam is none too keen on the idea of Emma being with them when they meet up with Kevin. Honestly, Emma can't really blame him for that one.Â And to be fair, if she were in Kevin's shoes she'd probably not want her around either
"Dad-"
"He brought me here," Emma says. "And he'll take us back."
Emma swallows. "If I show you, do you promise not to freak out?"
Castiel can't handle the distress on Dean's face on top of his own. Whatever this is, it's so very cruel. Offering him a glimpse of a Dean that loves him not as a brother but as a person he kisses. A person he's
"I really hope no one does with their mother what I heard Cas do with Dean earlier," Kevin adds.
Cas glances at it on his way past with the laundry. "There's a good spot on the wall by the stairs."
He leaves Cas catatonic in Sam's place, and then he goes and gets him again, then they explode Dick, and they wind up Purgatory. It's a lot less fun than the one in Miami.
The phone picks up again, moving closer to Sam's breathing. "They made him think he already had it. They figured it'd take away his doubts. I guess they figured you'd reciprocate and everything would work itself out."
Dean frowns.
"Surround myself? I'm not surrounded by anything," Dean argues. One vampire friend and one monster daughter does not make him surrounded. Sam's just being a dramatic little bitch. "What's this really about?"
An hour later, Dean's nursing his third coffee and trying not let a goofy smile take over his face as Sam enthusiastically explains complex Latin grammar rules to an equally enthusiastic Emma. "Wish you'd been there for the home schooling," Dean says when they finally finish. "Kid coulda been doing quantum physics by now."
The next 24 hours are a mess. By the time they reach the motel, Dean's already given up keeping up with Emma's growth spurts and put her in one of his own t-shirts and a blanket. The next two hours he spends feeding her again, changing her into a quick succession of outfits and posing her with hastily wrapped presents, birthday cakes and toys. He's more than a little proud of the way he manages to jury rig lighting and furniture to make the scene a little different each time.
It's warm and it's comfortable and he can feel Dean breathing beside him. It's more than his new human emotions can process and not enough to stop him wanting more. Before now his wants and desires regarding Dean were shapeless, formless. He didn't know enough to know what he wanted. But now he has Dean's arm around him, voice humming low in his ear every now and then as Dean explains some piece of movie trivia or other to him, Dean's smile, bright even in the dark as he laughs at Castiel's observations on the story, he has an image of it. He wants this. Dean's touch, Dean's thoughtless affection, Dean's ease, Dean's attention. He wants Dean to hold him, he wants mindless caresses and unselfconscious smiles, he wants casual kisses on his hair and hands, along with the heated ones he's sometimes imagined before now.
Emma shrugs. It's her go to comfort food these days, but there's no way in hell she's explaining that whole mess to him. "You want any?"
"No!" Emma yells. Her eyes are still human, but her usually watertight control seems to be slipping at the edges. "You don't get to just leave me behind!"
"Yeah. Dean," Dean confirms shortly. "What do you mean you don't want a part of this? A part of what?"
"I..." Emmanuel starts, but seems too stunned by the inquisition to finish his sentence.
She shakes her head. "I'm not sure what she thinks about me. It's gotta have been pretty obvious I'm not normal, but for all I know she just thinks Dean had me super young and abducted me from foster care when I grew up or something. I never asked."
Something in Dean's chest twinges painfully and he decides to smother it with burger.
"What does he want with Kevin?" Sam asks quietly.
The others have broken from their tasks and are also looking at him with varying degrees of concern.
"Yeah. Let me know if anything starts going bad," Sam says, then hangs up.
There's no car seat in his baby. His inanimate baby. Dean almost goes back to find one, but the sight of a car full of women headed down the street has him holding Emma in his lap and gunning it for the highway.
Emma nods and stalks from the room.
"Obviously." Emma watches him. "Jody, too."
The officiant rallies admirably. "I now pronounce you legally wed and bestow upon you the blessings of us, your friends, your family, and your community. You may kiss."
"You're good at math," Dean argues.
Jody doesn't flinch. "I betcha just beat the boys off with a stick, dontcha?"
Dean shoots her an irritated glare. Now is so not the time for her to get the never ending questions bug again.
Emma looks down at the ground beneath her feet. "People built bomb shelters around here?"
Claire nudges Dean and he clears his throat, hoping his voice will come out at least in the neighbourhood of normal. "Yeah, no. We can-we can do that. Nothin' fancy, just a little... w-wedding. Say our 'I dos'. A party after."
There's a pause where they both watch the steam from Jody's coffee, before Jody speaks. "Your dad never told me. I figured whatever you are, it can't be that bad if he'd leave you with me."
As if Dean would be sat here with a valid marriage license if he wasn't serious. Between getting the shit together for the application, going down to the courthouse with Cas to fill it out, and then waiting three days before he could pick it up, he's had plenty of opportunity to back out if he was going to. Instead heÂ has an appointment to taste wedding cakes at a local bakery with Claire when they're finished here. They may not be having a big princess wedding, but according to Claire that's no excuse for shoddy catering. Dean thinks she probably just wants to eat five different kinds of cake for lunch.
Dean grabs his still-packed duffle. "See ya, Sammy."
Sam scoffs. "Right."
"So, where do we start?" Emma asks. They made a loose plan on the way over, marking off the library and the town hall on the map and talking about where they'd hide a secret headquarters if they were white men in the early 20th century, but they hadn't really decided where to look first.
Being topside again is no less strange than the first time he came back from an extended period of being dead. Even weirder is watching Emma and Cas dance around each other, both equally cautious and curious. Benny thinks it's hilarious, as he lets be known loudly and happily once returned to his body.
"I love you," Castiel clarifies.
"You don't love me," Castiel says. "We're not together. We've never kissed. You didn't fall in love with me when I rebelled. It's a spell."
Charlie shrugs. "I found a few references here and there, but it wasn't completely clear whether they were talking about female Men of Letters or just people that helped them out. Like psychics or occassionally witches. There might have been one or two, I guess."
"That's bullshit," Dean rasps. "That's bullshit and you know it. Emma's never lifted a finger against any of us. You've always been the one sayin' we should give monsters a chance if they ain't hurting anyone. Emma's not hurting anyone. She never has, and she's had plenty of opportunity. Hell, even Cas is fine with her. You're the only one who has a problem." He grabs his jacket. He needs some air. God, he needs a
"And what I said..."
"He got a dog," Emma pipes up.
By the time Emma can beat Rachel in a fight March is on the horizon, and Emma has read every resource the Amazons have that could possibly help her. She stuffs a few of the miraculously well preserved tomes she left unread in her bag anyway. There's probably nothing in them, she's read anything that looked even a little relevant, but she's reluctant to let go of her heritage completely. Monstrous though it is.
He's so close. All he has to do is finish these vows, accept a few congratulations, and then he's married to the guy he's now realised is the freaking love of his life. They can figure out the rest later. "-In sickness and in health, to-"
And there's a dangerous part of him that thinks maybe, just maybe, Cas' suspiciously shiny eyes and gummy smile as Dean promises him those exact things, might mean that Cas might want that too.
"We're..." Castiel can't bring himself to say they're fine, to reinforce Dean's idea of this fictitious relationship.
"This is real," Dean murmurs.
Dean clenches his hand around his mug. How dare she? Cas has worn himself through taking care of Jimmy and his family while this bitch only turned up to the funerals. He glances at Jack's fast-flushing face and makes a concerted effort to keep his voice level. "Okay, I think maybe we should all just take a breath here."
Sam sighs. "We promised, after everything that's gone down, that we wouldn't keep doing this. That we wouldn't try to bring each other back."
The fire blazes up quicker than even Emma was expecting. Even Amazonian strength isn't going to get them out of that building, and with a little luck, it'll be assumed that she was in the building too.
Emma nods. "How is she?"
Emma raises a hand in an awkward wave. Dean's absurdly proud that she's stayed in control enough that she looks completely human.
Dean exhales and drops back down to the blanket.
"Benny's not coming with us?" Emma asks neutrally. She hasn't really formed much of an opinion on the vampire yet, and Dean knows its his own transmitted paranoia of supernatural creatures that keeps her from getting on with him. Benny's been nothing but nice to her.
Dean takes her in. Does his utmost not to flinch away from her inhuman eyes and takes a step closer. "You're not a freak."
"Sure." Emma climbs into bed. She doesn't lie down yet. "Are you, though? Going to send me back to Jody's?"
"Then you rebelled," Dean agrees. "Been a goner on you ever since."
"Yeah, one honey rose drizzle, one double chocolate," Dean says to the guy on the end of the phone.
With that he leaves his asshole brother to it. Dean doesn't want to fight with him anymore, and that's all they'll do if he stays, so he decides now is as good a time as any to go find a quiet place to call Jody. She'll know a hell of a lot more about what Emma's been up to the last few months than Sam does.
"They're going to come after her," Sam points out. "When I left, they were already looking for you."
When Charlie tells her about Purgatory, and her theory that that's where Dad and Cas ended up, Emma's ready to go out and track down some monsters to question. She's barely stood up before Charlie's hand on her arm tugs her back down. "Woah, slow down, Buffy," Charlie says. "I'm pretty sure if they knew how to get out of Purgatory monsters wouldn't be so reluctant to die."
"You doin' okay, Cas?" Dean asks as soon as she's occupied with pastry.
Dean blinks again and his face fills with horror. "Cas..."
At last Sam picks up, though his voice says the previous calls weren't so much missed as ignored. "Emma, I already told you I don't want a part in this. I asked you not to call, so please, just... leave me alone."
Emma smiles at her and swallows her food. "I know you did."
"Never stopped you before," Dean points out.
"Feeling you up?" Sam finishes for him. "Well, so far he's not gone further than some family friendly PDA, but you can always try to keep in the same room as Kevin. Unless the spell drives him completely crazy, Dean isn't gonna jump you in front of him."
Dean checks Emma, who's pulling a face at a shirt with sparkly lettering across it. "What?"
Dean looks at him incredulously. What, did he want a vacation slideshow? "Well the weather was nicer in Hell, but Purgatory locals were a little friendlier."
"Emma?" Dean asks without looking away from his brother.
Cas who smiles at him reassuringly and not at all like a man about to fake-marry his best friend. He looks so happy that Dean has to take a moment to process it, because no one should look that happy standing across from Dean in front of an officiant, much less someone like Cas.
"Okay," Sam says after a beat of silence. He doesn't seem to have anything to add to it though, and the silence grows again and becomes awkward.
Charlie just looks sad about that. Emma doesn't know how to tell her the reasons.
"What's wrong?" Emma asks.
If he could have pushed aside his concern at the uncharacteristic behaviour, Castiel would have happily let it lie. He'd mostly intended on doing so anyway, until Dean kissed his hair. The rest could be explained by an odd mood, or some internal trigger to Dean's protective instincts that only Dean was aware of. But a
"Your wife would be a good start," Dean quips. "Need to make it look like the real deal."
"Sam, we're doing this. I'm not letting him lose those kids," Dean says as seriously as he can muster. "You're the only blood I got left. I want you there."
Cas blinks rapidly. He wipes at his face, dislodging tears before they can fall, and takes Dean's ring from the box. "This ring I give to you as a token of my love and devotion to you. I pledge to you all that I am and all that I will ever be as yours. With this ring..."
"Yes."
Dean takes a breath. Flips the bird in the general direction of their guests. Kisses his husband.
That seems to tip the scales in their favour and Mrs. Tran gives a slow nod.
Dean splutters. "We watched two episodes. Two. There was nothing else on."
Dean shrugs. "Then you're not going back to Jody's."
"Cas?" Dean asks, sounding as though it isn't the first time.
Rachel nods, satisfied with her answer. "You know they'll find you someone else to complete your initiation, right?"
Dean eyes him warily, half expecting half wanting Sam to hit him. Anger he can deal with but he doesn't know if he'd be able to handle apathy.
After fruitlessly walking the highstreet for awhile, the only thing that's even a little appealing is the minimart.
"I looked for you, you know," Jody says a little sadly.
Kevin continues his sluggish chewing.
Dean presses his fingers and thumb to his eyes and takes a breath. Rattles off the motel they're planning on stopping at. Sam says he'll be there soon and Dean almost believes he means it.
Maybe she should.
Emma shrugs. "Well, you did."
"You're under a spell," Castiel says.
Dean waves them down as they ready themselves to fight her off, and catches her as she flings herself at him. "Emma?" He asks more than a little disbelievingly.
"Emma," Lydia says, the stink eye sharpening.
"Please tell me you've not been treating your niece like shit because you're pissed at me?" Dean presses.
Dean tries to find reassurance in Cas' eyes that what he's hearing isn't real, but Cas is frowning for the first time since 6am this morning, and turning away from Dean and towards the voice.
They set up shop and spend the next three days going through the archives and trying varying qualities of food from the restaurants around town.
Dean shifts. "I'll go get the car. Emma-"
So Emma lets her true self show to a human for the first time since Dad was ali- Around.
"You won't wimp out, will you? You know what happens to runaways," Rachel says.
"So you remember the door was jammed and no one could get it open until it just, like, flew open for you?" Charlie's bright voice comes through into the dull room.
"What was?" Uncle Sam asks warily.
The second the phone call is over Emma grabs all the information she has on the Trans and starts looking. Whatever went down it's not good, and if Crowley has the tablet it's only a matter of time before he gets Kevin too. She has no idea what'll happen if he gets Kevin to read the tablet, but she's willing to bet it'll be a whole load of extra badness given it's the King of Hell.
"We don't know," Sam admits. "Could just be to mess with us. Wouldn't be the first time."
"We are a real family!" Claire yells, startling the baby who stops his wobbly bouncing and looks up with wide blue eyes to watch. Luckily he's used to Claire's teen angst and her outburst doesn't seem to scare him.
Jo shrugs.Â "Cas didn't ask you to do any of this. You offered. And that's great, you're an angel, whatever. But he's a big boy, he can take care of himself for five minutes while you blow off some steam."
Dean nudges him and points at him accusingly. "You suck."
"You do so much for us," Cas says, subdued and heavy.
Dad comes back half an hour later, to find Emma watching the motel room TV, and Sam trying to look like he's doing the same rather than frowning suspiciously at her non-stop.
Another eyeroll. "You're such a sap. You know I'm crazy about you."
"Is she-"
When Dean wakes from his doze, Sam's made it through two hours of driving and they're outside yet another shitty motel. Dean hates himself a little as he wakes Emma to take her into their twin room. Sam gets his own room.
"God, no, Dean," Sam says, hand raising to tangle into his stupidly long hair. "It wasn't like that."
Sam shuts his laptop decisively. "We should head out."
Dean repeats his words and actions, ignoring anything but Cas and the feeling of Cas' hand in his.
Dean notices the three pairs of eyes all staring at him. "What? Have I got something on my face?"
Emma thinks about the idea of being the descendant of two sexist secret societies obsessed with killing things and raising their kids to kill things. Namely each other. "It would be kind of funny. It a scary kind of way."
"Don't look like that, I'm not tryin' to get all mushy on ya," Jo grumbles. "I just want you to have fun and all the good stuff, and not just iron Cas' shirts all day."
Castiel waves at him to put him at ease and dials Sam. "It's getting worse."
Dean stares a moment more before blinking and looking away, back in the general direction of Sam and Kevin. "Can we have a minute?"
Emma takes a breath. "I'm not human."
Cas's angry, guilty expression fades with the reminiscence, and his soft smile finally eases the tension in the room. "I'll call a lawyer and arrange an appointment. The sooner we know what we're dealing with, the better."
He fails and her face collapses into devastation. "You're afraid of me," she all but whispers. Then she raises her voice. "I'm a freak!"
Meg... ugh. No.
"No," Charlie says. "But I did find something interesting. Remember I said it might be a locking spell? Well it looks like the Men of Letters guys did know some magic, and used it. It's possible they wanted to make sure only they could get into their bases, with or without a key. Likely, even. The question is-"
It takes half a second for Dean to decide to forgive Sam. His dad? Not so much.
"I don't know what's going on here, man," Dean confesses. "I kiss you all the goddamn time. I know I'm not, like, Mr. Public Displays of Affection or anything, but-"
Sam isn't finished though. "This has nothing to do with Amy, okay? I'll admit, I was pissed at you for killing her, and then for taking in Emma like... But it doesn't matter! What matters is that Emma's not your kid, she's an Amazon. She's a killer, and if you're not careful it's gonna be us she kills. Or our friends, who you keep leaving her alone with."
"I haven't checked," Castiel says.
"My name's Emma, not Buffy."
Dean blinks back tears and looks extremely embarrassed about it. "Yeah, well."
Dean teaches Emma to drive. Not in the Impala. Not yet. The kid's a fast learner, even if it's more smart kid fast than supernaturally fast these days, but even so, some things just aren't worth the risk. Instead they borrow a car. Without permission, but they're totally bringing it back.
Emma slumps. "You'll need me to get in. The door doesn't open for anyone else."
Sam resolutely ignores him and keeps on texting his girlfriend.
Emma continues before she can speak. "If there's anywhere you're gonna find something to use against Crowley, it's there. It's filled with books on demons and stuff, and Charlie even found some old spell ingredients and talismans in storage. Way more reliable than a Craigslist witch, and way safer."
Dean can't breathe. He can't- this can't be happening. This can't be real.
"In bringing me back? Is that it?" Dean says, as his gut sinks like a stone. "You didn't want me back, Sammy?"
Part of him expected Sammy to get them out of here before now, but he spent forty years in hell, so it's not like he's relying on it. Instead he's trusting a vampire and his seemingly sane-again best friend as they fight their way through the monster afterlife. Benny seems pretty sure they'll find a way out, while Cas is stone silent on the matter.
"Do you want to go back to Jody's?"
The words, dropped so casually from Dean's lips, constrict Castiel's heart. He swallows and closes his eyes, ready to bring himself back to reality before it's too late. "For how long?"
Emma goes to answer her but Jody cuts her off.
"Great," Sam says, and edges back towards the sleeping quarters. "I'll pack some fresh clothes and leave in the morning."
"I wasn't keeping track," Sam says, like that's better. "Look, we still have his number, I'm sure we can find him easy enough. I'm sure he's fine."
"Why not?" Emma asks. "There's room, and it's already warded and secret, and has a magic lock and everything. No one would even find us, and it'd be a fortress if they did. You could get there to back us up before they even scuffed the metal on the door."
There's a chuckle and Dean looks up to find that Cas and Sam have snuck up on them. Sam looks amused, but the worried look from before hasn't disappated.
Dad pulls cuffs out from the back of his jacket. "Need to know only. Had to be sure of where he'd be, this was a good opportunity."
"It's not a curse," Sam tells him, sounding like he's about to break some sensitive news. "It's a blessing. Or it was supposed to be. The wiccans wanted to reward Dean for helping their friend pass on."
For the first time since his first night in the bunker, Castiel dresses before he leaves his room. He needs the distance his 'angel getup' can give him if he's going to withstand the day.
"He's a hunter! He's lasted this long, hasn't he?" Dean feels the need to defend the man, partially because he feels guilty for trash talking him and partially because this is beginning to feel like the time he tried to convince his middle school teacher that Sammy ate his homework.
"Take off your wristband," Dean orders.
Sam's more surprised than anything, eyebrows shooting up as he utters "How?"
Claire grins at him, mouth stretching impossibly wider. "It's okay. My bachorlette party will have actual strippers though."
Dean winces. "And I get why. I do. But trust me, there ain't no one else who can."
"What are you doing?"
"You get within walking distance and you set up shop in a diner or a coffee shop or somethin', you hear me?" Dean orders. He never likes giving orders. Still feels weird to hand them out instead of take them, and he can hear echoes of his own dad in his voice that he still has mixed feelings about. But sometimes he has to stop the people he loves from doing something stupid.
Dean's stomach drops and his hands start to sweat as it comes closer to his turn, closer to the moment Cas takes his hand and slides a ring onto his finger, closer to the officiant pronouncing them legally wed. He realises, as he automatically repeats the vows as the officiant prompts him, that he means them. Every word. He wants this.
," Naomi says the way Ellen might say 'moist' or Sam might say 'processed food', "is not a part of this. Sofa surfing colleagues aren't part of custody agreements. If anything, a judge might find it a little concerning that your uncle's single male friend is living here with a teenage girl."
Cas has moves away by the time he wakes up, but there's tan fabric covering Dean, and it smells like Cas again. Albeit a mucker, more mulch covered Cas. It halts the panic building in Dean's throat as he glances around wildly for any sign of where Cas has got to. Somehow the idea that Cas would leave the trenchcoat behind doesn't occur to him, seems far less likely than leaving Dean himself, and sure enough Cas comes back to collect it within minutes of Dean waking. Dean doesn't mention it, and he doesn't ask Cas to stop when he does it the next time Dean falls asleep. There are no nice ways to wake up in Purgatory, but it comes as close as anything could.
"I don't see how removing them from their home and the people they're used to is what is best for them," Castiel says, just as much bitchy fury in his tone as Claire had. "We're doing fine, we don't need your interference!"
"She made a deal," Sam says in a tone of vindication. He turns to Emma. "Didn't you?"
Emma speaks out loud the Amazonian rites she memorised when she first resolved to do this, and she creeps around the emergency services personnel to scoop a handful of ashes into a box. She'll carry this with her always, and it's only right there's something physical to carry too.
with. "I'll go and get Sam back."
"Dean?"
Dean falters, trying to wrap Castiel's words into the narrative he's building.
Dean's been far too tactile all day. At first it was barely noticeable. They were all touches he gives out regularly anyway, just with greater frequency. A hand to the shoulder here, a nudge in the side there, an arm pressed close to Castiel's as they did the dishes together after lunch. Castiel had been enjoying it far too much to question it. But as the day wore on, the touches didn't slow. When they did a cursory search for hunts in the area, Dean leaned over him while he got some practise using Google, arms propped up on either side of Castiel as he pressed in close and gave advice that rumbled almost directly down Castiel's ear. When Kevin offered to make dinner (an incredibly rare occurrence, and usually one Dean would encourage despite the mediocre food), Dean waved him off and volunteered himself and Castiel, then spent the whole time brushing Castiel's arms as they worked, pressing in behind him for a few moments to check he was preparing the vegetables correctly, physically moving Castiel around the kitchen as he wanted with a gentle hold on his shoulders.
"I've got a thing coming up, and I don't wanna miss it 'cause I ran out of holiday days and money," Charlie says. "Awesome as all this is, it's been here forty odd years, it'll probably still be here in a couple months."
"Right," Cas says, then stares at him in annoyed and confused silence. "Why?"
Mrs. Tran looks about ready to drench him again on principal when she recognises him.
"I don't know who this Garth is, but we don't need a teenaged girl to protect us," Mrs. Tran replies, tone and eyes laying a whole lot of judgment on Dean, as if he was the one that suggested it.
Dean's trying very hard not to imagine Crowley finding Emma with Kevin. Even harder not to wonder whether she'd hand Kevin over. She wouldn't. He knows that. One hundred percent... Maybe ninety-nine percent.
"Good. She's good. Only good things to say about you, kiddo," Dad reassures somewhat half-heartedly. "Don't think she'll be volunteering for babysitting duty again any time soon, though."
Castiel's head swims. "What?"
She shrugs and keeps her attention glued to the road. "Looking for you."
The phone, or rather Emma's phone, rings nearly as soon as they set foot in the motel room. Emma answers it and puts it on speaker.
Naomi sighs, put upon, and strides primly into the kitchen behind Cas. She eyes the detritus of Dean's hangover with distaste. "This isn't a stable environment. They should be in a real family."
Dean waits for the Trans' response. It's a decent argument, and though he hasn't been there himself, Dean's heard enough from Emma and Charlie not to doubt the truth in it. It's just whether Mrs. Tran will go for it when it's attached to them.
Lydia's chin lifts. "She's mine."
"I don't know, anything. Chew me out over Benny, or tell me I'm an idiot, or somethin'," Dean suggests. Anything's better than silence.
She doesn't get a chance to confirm her identity or explain what the hell she's doing here before the ruckus attracts some of Purgatory's natural residents. Dean tries to put Emma behind him, between the three of them where they can protect her, but she ducks out from under his arm and joins the fight with enough fluid competence that Dean finds himself thinking dark thoughts about Jody Mills. His kid couldn't fight like that when he left, and no one learns to fight like that without fighting for their lives at least a few times. Rough and opportunistic and holding nothing back for reserves.
"Hardy har," Dean says snidely. "I'm a little busy to go chasing tail."
Jody had been teaching her self defense so she's not starting completely from scratch, but Jody had never known Emma's true capabilities. She doesn't know Emma isn't human, though Emma's sure she suspects. Dad told her never to tell anyone what she is, and she never has. So here, now, training with other girls like her, as strong as her, Emma struggles to keep up. These girls were raised doing this, not eating birthday cake and watching Star Trek reruns.
"He has Dean," Claire says abruptly. She raises her chin under the sudden attention of all three extremely tense adults. "Dean has a job, Dean helps look after us."
"What about Charlie?" Sam tries.
She's probably about twelve developmentally speaking, and he assumes the Amazon genes are kicking in with puberty. Her teenage angst is certainly setting in early, and she wants to leave the motel room. It strikes him again how damn useless his parenting skills, such as they are, have been to her. She's not been outside of this shitty motel room since she was a baby. Of course she wants out.
"Havin' fun?" Dean asks, only a little teasingly.
is happy with his wife. Drop it."
"Did you leave the dog at home?" Emma asks. Her voice is flippant but Dean can see her white knuckled grip on her book, the way she hasn't lifted her eyes from the page since they started raising their voices.
Dean props himself up a little to open it and take a sip. He grins contentedly at Castiel around the mouth of the bottle and Castiel's stomach drops.
Sam laughs and then looks surprised at himself.
"You kissed him," Kevin points out with a hysterical kind of glee. The mess of his hair and the purple under his eyes lend further absurdity to the unhinged tone in his voice. The boy clearly needs sleep. Were Castiel still an angel, he'd put him under with a touch that would keep him there until he was fully rested, regardless of headaches or nightmares.
Dean blinks. Right. Their case. The custody case that was the whole reason for this to begin with. That Naomi and Crowley have no hope in hell of winning anyway if Crowley's going to jail on drug charges. They don't have to get married.
"I'm taking a walk," Dean mutters beside him, patience worn thin listening to only the less informative side of the conversation.
Her mom would've turned her over to be raised with all the others, to do nothing with her life but mate and kill. For an all female society, they seemed pretty hung up on reproduction being the end goal for their daughters.
"Sam..." Castiel prompts, annoyance bleeding into his voice.
Castiel complies, trying not to jostle Dean too much as he reaches into the cooler.
"And ice cream?" Emma asks quietly.
"You've been... uncharacteristically affectionate today," Castiel continues. "I wasn't sure whether to say something or not."
"Look-" Charlie starts.
Cas smiles again at that. He doesn't say goodbye and he doesn't wait for Emma to come back to the table. Dean blinks and he's gone.
Dean starts to shake his head. "No. No, we've not been near anything with the power to do that in months! I'm not- Cas, I'm not crazy. I'm not making this up. I don't know what the hell's going on here, but you and me? That's real. I know it is."
"I..."
Castiel's jaw clenches. He can't play act as Dean's partner for however long it takes Sam to find the witch and end the spell, no matter how mild the act. "We should all go back to Pennsylvania. It'll be easier to find the witch with us all working on it."
When she finds the Craigslist ad, she knows she made the right call.
Dean looks reflexively around to find Charlie, and quickly looks away. "Jesus, do they have to do that here?"
broach the subject.
She nods. "They trained me. Taught me. I thought if I learned what I could from them that it might help me figure out how to find Dad. At least I'd be able to take care of myself."
They don't bother going back to the motel. Sam's right, the amazons will be trying to find them, and if Sam managed it then they probably won't be far behind. Dean picks a state to aim for at random and doesn't stop driving until the road starts swimming in front of his eyes.
Sam hangs up and Castiel is left holding the silent phone to his ear and looking up at a hurt and angry Dean.
"I don't get the kids thing," Emma admits. "We lose girls as fast as we have them, it seems like."
"Do you really think she's taking advantage of me?" Emmanuel asks hesitantly. "She's been so kind... I..."
That just seems to confuse Dean all the more. "What are you talking about?"
"Shut up."
They establish that the spell, as they assume it to be, hasn't planted any particular memories. Though Dean insists he and Cas are together and that they've kissed, among other things Castiel tries not to dwell upon, when questioned he can't remember the first time they kissed, or any other specific memories of them together. There don't seem to be any other memories or beliefs out of the ordinary, either. Whatever the spell does, it's limited to his belief in his romantic relationship to Castiel.
"I was with them, yeah. I didn't kill anyone, though," Emma says, then amends. "Anyone human."
Sam looks away, gathering up his things as if Dean hadn't even spoken.
"Sam," Dean calls back casually enough.
Castiel almost regrets it as he crawls in between his sheets, cool and loose over his mattress. He can still feel the warmth of Dean's arm around him as he drifts into sleep.
"Emma, cut that crap right now," he orders as if his heart isn't pounding so heard he can hear his blood rush around his head. "You know damn well why we can't go out."
She rolls her eyes and swallows the gunk that can barely be classed as a foodstuff. "No. I eat the same as a regular human." She pauses in thought. "A little more than most people, maybe."
"Dude, no! It's fine, I'm the one who should be sorry. I get a stupid monkey paw wish granted and you end up stuck with me hanging all over you." Dean shakes his head and kicks at the ground. "God, I can't believe I told you- Shit! Look, can we just pretend like I didn't get us hexed into a fake relationship and make you cuddle with me?"
If there's even a chance they can salvage this...
"And a girlfriend," Emma adds.
He wants to spend his life with Cas. He wants to kiss him, to take him to bed on their wedding night, to wake up far too early on a Sunday to feed the baby he wants them to raise together, to be Claire's embarrassing kind-of step-dad and be there when she really does get drunk for the first time, and when she's getting married and planning her debauchery filled hen night. He wants to never have to go 'home' and have that mean somewhere Cas isn't.
"Yeah," Dean says. "Three for three on afterlives."
Dean's unimpressed expression clearly says that he doesn't understand the problem.
"Out."
Emma protects her head from a vicious blow, and gets Rachel in a low triangle hold that Jody taught her. It's enough to get Rachel momentarily off guard, and Emma's head sings in victory right up until Rachel manages to smash it into the floor.
The funeral is overcast and as miserable as a funeral should be. Cas wears the same suit he wore to bury Jimmy, and Claire spends the whole day without saying a single word to anyone. Dean doesn't blame her. He's had his fair share of tragedy in his family, but losing both parents so close together...
Naomi stands up improbably straighter. "You have no more claim to custody than we do, and we can provide a stable family unit with two incomes and two parents. We live in an excellent school district and have strong ties to the community. You, on the other hand, might orphan these kids a third time in your low income, public sector job, and have no resources or support to raise them. Any judge in the country will pick a happily married couple over a mentally and financially unstable bachelor."
Emma digs out her cell and shoots off a quick text to Charlie.
"Why would anyone want Dean to think he's banging Cas?" Kevin asks bluntly, when they explain it to him.
"I'll keep watch," Emma says.
"I can do that," Dean says, scrubbing roughly at his face and choking out a laugh. "Man, I get why you freaked out earlier. It's kind of a lot, right? Hearing that kind of stuff. God, never tell Sammy that I-" He cuts off with a long blink and an inhale.
"Cas?"
Emma's look of disappointment when she comes back to find there's only Dean left echoes Dean's own disappointment and he decides the best course of action is to bury their feelings in junk food and good music.
He hangs up and tosses his own phone into the passenger seat. Maybe he's the kind of hypocrite that can at least take his own advice. Maybe he can get one of those prissy hands free things. Not like Sammy'll be there to gloat about it.
Dean gestures towards her. "See? Jimmy knew how to be romantic. I'm so marrying the wrong brother."
One of the weirder parts of being an Amazon is the clarity of her memories from pretty much the moment of birth. She doesn't know these women, doesn't know their faces or voices, but she does know who they are. She remembers her mother telling her about them. She never told Dad she remembers him stabbing her mom to death. He'd only get that dumb sad look on his face that he always got when he was thinking about what a terrible parent he was, and knowing what she'd have been raised to do if he hadn't, Emma can't find it in her to blame him. He took her away from that and he raised her like any other kid. Or as close to as was possible.
Emma shrugs and doesn't argue, even as the times she tried to help with hunts and her dad kept her away from them run through her head. Dad would've deliberately crashed the Impala before sending her after vampires. Emma wonders distantly if Uncle Sam even kept the car. "He's gone now."
"Claire, you deserve a complete family unit," Naomi says firmly. "A stable financial situation. Guardians in careers that don't put their lives at risk."
"Yeah, but it's not like either of us is gonna be tossing a bouquet," Dean points out. The baker reads off his total and Dean turns his attention to reading off his card number. When he hangs up Cas is still frowning down at the list. "What?"
While Dad taught her to strong, Jody taught her to be pragmatic, and Emma has enough money taken from Erin's safe to go wherever she wants to go. There'll be more if she can get away with emptying the school's accounts before the other Amazons get there. She doesn't have the skills for that herself, but she has a near photographic memory, and she knows the number Charlie Day gave to Dad, and she knows Charlie will feel bad enough about what happened to Dad that she'll help Emma. She might even have some new information Emma can use.
"Dean," Sam starts. Dean knows exactly what he's going to say.
Rachel scoffs. "He wanted you to be some kind of hunter's pet. A hunting dog to send out after bloodsuckers and corpse eaters."
Emma frowns in confusion. "To work?"
Kevin looks no more elucidated than he was before and keeps opening his mouth as if to ask a question, and then changing his mind.
The smile drops. "And I know what you are. Hunter."
"You okay, buddy? Kinda zoned out on us there," Dean says. Even his voice is softer than normal, easy concern without awkward humour pasted over it.
Emma caves. She doesn't know how much Charlie gave away, but she knows it won't stay secret forever. Probably shouldn't, even. "So, you know found the reaper info in that weird Men of Letters place, and we found out about the Men of Letters not that long ago. We spent a lot of time just kind of... flailing around in the dark. Just trying to find anything we could. You guys know how hard it is to find anything, Cas and Crowley searched for months, and they had all of Hell and half of Heaven to help. We had nothing, really. Just the internet and whatever random books we could find in library mythology section. I read the bible back to front like five times it was-"
That does it. Dean stands. "Lady-"
"You keep asking that like my answer's going to change," Sam says. "Just let it go. Neither of us is gonna change our minds."
Sam's getting worse and Dean can't leave him alone as much, so the coat stays safely in the trunk, untouched for weeks at a time. He's still careful to bring it with them whenever they switch vehicles, and he nearly has a heart attack when he goes to look for it and Sam's moved it to get to something else. When he finds it again he spends way too long with it in his hands, resisting the urge to pillow his face on it.
"Cas thinks they'll be too scattered to come after him," Emma says, flipping the page of a book that Dean's genuinely worried might be bound in human skin. "Apparently things were too chaotic to have gotten back to normal while you were gone, and Cas thinks he still has at least some loyalists he can turn to to start getting things back on track. He said something about how the angels will have felt the disturbance in the force when he came back." She looks up. "I mean, he didn't actually say 'disturbance in the force'."
"Yes, everything's fine," Castiel tells him. He steels himself before sitting back down.
Charlie fiddles with her Harry Potter keyring. "No. You're not doing this alone. I'll help you."
"To what?" Dean yells in frustration, then looks around at the scattered people around them enjoying the park and forces his voice level. "What can I do? What do you want me to do?"
"You wanna come?"
Sam shifts in place. "Actually, I uh, I've not been hunting."
"Actually, he didn't know how to row and Mom ended up pulling a muscle getting them back to shore after they cast off," Claire tells him. "He had terrible coordination."
Dean shakes himself. "No. She's on route, though. Apparently Linda's less than savvy with internet safety. Her email is still active and she's talking to strangers on Craigslist. Emma got into her account."
"Where are you going?" Dean asks.
"You good to get us to the next town over, or am I gonna wake up to find you with a gun against my kid's head?" Dean asks Sam roughly, eyes skipping to the girl sleeping in the backseat.
Emma turns back to Sam. "Hey, do you think I could use your computer later?"
"I dunno, ask him I guess. If it's broken he should remember it breaking," Sam says. "I gotta go. I'm heading back, I'll be there by tonight."
"Where else would I go? I already said I'm not going back to Jody. She's great but I'm done playing normal," Emma says. "I know you won't take me on the road, but I-"
"The others will be here to collect her soon," Lydia spits.
If Dean had ever bothered to imagine the night before his wedding, this would be the furthest thing from what he'd have fantasised. Sat in the same bar he's spent countless nights in with his spouse-to-be sat two stools down with Charlie listening to Sammy's drunken, soppy stories about Dean when they were kids, his soon-to-be kind of step-kid two feet away, Dean himself barely tipsy out of paranoia that Claire will get drunk or hurt or something and not only be drunk or hurt but also prove he and Cas as unfit parents.
"To love and to cherish," Dean says, still quiet in the face of Jack's crying and Crowley's yelling, and Dad's smug voice reciting Miranda rights. "'Til death do we part. This is my solemn vow."
Emma nods and tries not to feel abandoned. She's the one that chose to leave Dad, Jody, and the Amazons. "Yeah, sure."
"I know this isn't ideal, and I wouldn't ask it of you if I could see another way," Cas begins. "But I... It wouldn't have to be real. Well, technically it'd have to be real, legal. But it would just be on paper, and I wouldn't stop you from... You could still see people and- and date, and keep your apartment if you want to. I can take care of this place myself, and the kids, and I-"
Cas scratches his head with a pencil and marks off the cake on their list. "We'll have to lower the flower budget."
That prompts a joyous laugh and Dean shifts his position to get more comfortable. "What, you want an exact date?"
"Reaper," Cas grumbles warily.
This... might be a little hard to explain without sounding really, really bad.
"It's the truth," Emma snaps. She slams her book shut and flings herself off the bed and towards the door.
Emma fumes. "No. I'm coming with you. I can be useful," she says. "I'm strong. Stronger than you are. I can fight, you know I can."
The King of Hell eyes her curiously at first. He doesn't know who she is. Emma wasn't expecting that.
When Emma stares longingly at the display with the pies in it as they settle up, the waitress gives Dean a wink and leans into Emma conspiratorially. "Why don't you ask your dads if you can take some for the road. I'll even give 'em a discount."
"You could say that," Emma says. She comes from a family of hunters after all. And for some reason she doesn't want to tell Jody about murdering two dozen Amazons in their sleep. Sometimes she thinks she can still smell the smoke in her hair.
"Cut the crap," Dean says. "I know what you are."
He clears his throat. "Yeah?"
Kevin shrugs. "Could be worse, I guess."
Dean freezes and tries not to make it too conspicuous. "Nothin'. Cleaning."
While Jody bustles about the kitchen, cursing and sighing by turns as she makes coffee and fixes sandwiches how she knows Emma likes them, Emma runs her fingers over the mark on her wrist. It's scarred well, the brand clear. She bought wristbands similar to the ones Dad used to wear when she bought her phone, but she hasn't brought herself to put one on just yet.
It's a good point. "Crowley," Emma remembers. "Dad said something about Crowely and Cas opening purgatory. I bet he knows something."
Castiel wishes that he could agree. "You're the only one who seems to think so."
"Make what different?" Emma asks. She doesn't change back. Just squirts some more cheese into her mouth and waits for an answer.
"What the hell are you doing here?" Sam picks up before Dean's even realised he's run out of air.
This whole thing really wasn't endearing the dead society to her. Emma shakes her head, trying to get her mind back on topic. "So, what? You think I'm one of these legacies or something?" The thought was kind of ridiculous.
"So let's be together," Castiel concludes. "Truly be together."
Except for the hand Dean holds out to the camera, middle finger raised pride of place in the middle of the picture.
Emmanuel's house is very neat looking. Tidy and normal and safe. Dean hates it on sight and only hates it harder when he finally meets the miracle man.
Dean's jaw works as a flurry of different emotions pass over his face. He locks his gaze onto Castiel and leans in towards him, catching him off guard.
"Wait," Dean says quietly, only loud enough that Cas, Claire and the officiant hear him. All three turn towards him, but it's only Cas he's talking to. "Cas..."
"Emma."
"So, did life with Sheriff Mills get too boring for you?" Dean asks, peeling his eyes away.
Castiel's hand tightens menacingly on the phone. "How on earth is this a reward?"
She violently flips another page and this one does tear a little. "Dammit." She closes the book, and then the others spread out over the table.
talk to Dean that way," Cas almost bellows. Dean's not sure he's ever seen him quite this angry, and he's seen Cas really freakin' angry.
"Sam-"
"Don't I get a say in what that is?" Claire snaps, storming into the kitchen and brushing past Dean as if he's furniture to stand in front of Jack, as if blocking him off from her aunt.
"Yes, Dad," Emma says, more subdued. "What about Uncle Sam?"
Dad was right about school. She wasn't missing anything.
Emma glances at Dean, perking up a little with a glimmer of renewed argument in her eye. "Then come to the bunker."
Dean curses and looks around the room. There's a changing bag and the bottle Lydia was using before. Dean scoops up both and moves into the kitchen. He grabs the can of formula and a second, clean bottle and stuffs them into the bag. He considers going upstairs to see if there's clothes or diapers or anything he can use, but Lydia's warning rings in his ears and he heads straight for the door instead.
"Is that... I mean, is that safe?" Sam frowns. "He can't be too popular up there right now?"
"I can-"
Castiel takes a beer out of the cooler for something to do more than anything. He couldn't go back to pretending he didn't want those things from Dean, even if the silence in Dean's reaction is just as painful as he'd predicted whenever he'd allowed himself to imagine confessing his feelings in the past.
Sam sighs. "I know you want to believe her. I know she's... important to you."
"Cas!" Dean protests, but Castiel can't listen.
Castiel smiles faintly back at him and accepts a plate of eggs.
She leads him a little away from this more thriving, more franchise filled block and into a more run down street. There are a handful of places open, and then there's aÂ  gap. Like someone decided that this street was where town should end and anything past it closed up accordingly.
She hitches lifts all the way back to Sioux Falls before she bothers buying a phone and a car. Both cheap and barely serviceable. Both disposable. A call to Charlie and she has a date to meet up and go over Charlie's research. With that she heads for Jody's.
Still, it's not like there's a lot of other options this short notice. Kelly would strengthen the case a lot better, being Jimmy and Amelia's surrogate for Jack gives her another claim to custody, and she's decently well off with a big house and a promising political career. Somehow Dean doubts she'd be down for a fake marriage on a tight schedule, though. Good christian values and worries of future political scandal to consider and all.
Another shrug. "Charlie got rid of him before I could ask. I'd imagine prophet stuff," Emma says.
The tension in Dean's body evaporates.
The hunt goes as well as can be expected. So does the next one, and the one after that. And if Dean's distracted from Sammy's failing mental health while he works on cases, keeps his overly curious daughter out of danger and stays on the lookout for angry amazons and niece murdering brothers, then he thinks he can be excused. Or that's what he tells himself.
Dean puts down his fork and watches her for a moment. She's been angry at Naomi and sad at the funeral and amused at the fake wedding, but she's always seemed pretty damn sure she's staying with Cas. Until now, Dean hadn't really thought about what it must be like for her in that sense. Sure, she's got to be worried about living with Naomi and Crowley, leaving her home and everything, but Cas is the third guardian in a short time she could potentially lose. It must feel a little like getting orphaned all over again before she's even had time to process losing her folks.
It smells of Cas. Or maybe Jimmy, maybe angels don't have their own smell. Dean kinda hates that he doesn't know. Either way it's a damn painful way to wake up and cuts through his hangover like a rusty knife. If he wasn't going to throw up before then he sure as hell will now.
She shrugs it off, though. They already agreed to this, and she's not so childish as to put her feelings in front of whatever the King of Hell wants with Kevin.
"Charlie had some interesting things to say about your time together."
Mrs. Tran folds her arms and looks at Dean expectantly. "You never talked about that part? Very reassuring."
"Run out of embarrassing kid stories already?" Dean asks.
The bathroom door opens. Emma looks younger again in her pyjamas. Vulnerable and sleepy as she tucks herself in and smiles at him. "G'night, Dad."
They each get a face full of holy water upon entry, and Dean would be less pissed if he weren't also annoyed with himself for not thinking up demon fighting supersoakers first. He may not be the best and brightest, but he's been doing this his whole goddamn life, while the Trans have somehow come up with new tricks after a few months of knowing about demons.
"It's been a fun show, but I'll be damned if I have to watch my son french another guy," Dad says, a smile on his face like he isn't ruining everything. "Especially for no good reason."
On the fourth day they find the book about reapers.
Dean wakes up nearly a full two hours before his alarm. He didn't drink enough for a drunken slumber, and once he's awake that's it. There's no chance he's getting back to sleep, not today.
"Can barely call it a car," Dean mutters.
He's down half a beer and three shots of whisky and spilling his woes, such as they are, onto the bartop before he even realises that was Jo's whole motivation for dragging him out.
"Again," Erin orders, and Rachel, the girl Emma's sparring with, sweeps her and jabs her hard in the solar plexus.
"How do we... How can we be sure? How do we break it?" Castiel asks.
"Nothing, I..." The words still won't come and neither will the breath.
Emma must look like a kidnap victim. Which Dean supposes she kind of is. She's wearing one of Dean's shirts and a pair of jogging pants Dean used his limited sewing skills on so that they'd stay up. He doesn't know how they'd have handled things after she hit five if Dean hadn't kept spare clothes in the car. He'd skipped town without getting his stuff from the motel room he and Sam had been staying at. Her hair has grown without interference and looks like it's never seen a hairbrush (it hasn't). She has no shoes and her terrified face looks white and gaunt in the dim lighting from the motel's ancient ceiling light and the sunlight leaking in around the drawn curtains.
"Sure," Dean says. "Why don't you go chill out for a bit. We've got things handled here."
Dean rests on the forest floor as close to Cas as he can get away with without getting a raised eyebrow from Benny. He doesn't mean to fall asleep, though god knows he needs it, every moment of Purgatory existing in that same dingy glow of light and danger as they trudge endlessly onwards, but he's only human. He thinks.
"Dean," Castiel starts, then falters. He pulls himself together. This is the only way to get Dean back to normal, and even if Dean's unhappy about it, he'll forgive Castiel for it if it stops him doing and saying things he doesn't truly want to do or say. "Dean, I rebelled because I love you. And because it was the right thing to do, but I only knew that because you told me it was. I would trust your judgement over the very word of God, because I truly believe that your goodness could never steer me wrong. I would follow you into Hell because I cannot fathom ever turning away from you. You are the best, most courageous, most loving man I have ever encountered and from the moment I met you, I knew I never wanted to be apart from you."
Charlie laughs. "To the thing. To Moondoor. It's like aÂ renaissance fair kinda. But with duelling and camping and fun stuff."
"It still could be," Sam points out. "It might seem pretty harmless right now, but spells have a nasty way of getting out of hand."
Emma just folds her arms and looks at him.
"Can I get this?" Emma holds up a shoulder bag with the Wonder Woman logo on it and Dean laughs.
"Why don't they come back to New Orleans with me?" Emma suggests.
"Not the whole year," Emma admits. "I went to school. It was lame. I saw Star Wars. Spent a bunch of time eating spray cheese."
"My problem?" Sam says, flinging his arms wide like the drama queen he is. "She's not human, Dean. She was born to kill, that's what she's built for. You're the one who's always said a monster is a monster. You're the one who always says we have to put them down. You killed Amy-"
"You're right, I don't remember our first kiss. Or any of 'em," Dean admits, steel in his face and voice. "Maybe none of that's real. Maybe it never happened."
Emma shrugs, much like Dean had a moment before. "Something to do rather than watching hospital dramas with my dad."
"I can't do anything!" Emma rages. "I can't go out, I can't have friends, I can't go to school!"
"You're so whipped," Claire says on a grin.
"Good."
It doesn't matter if Dean won't remember this conversation in a few moments. It's for the best. If he could, Castiel would erase his own memory of it as well. It's the worst moment of his existence to hear those words from Dean and know he doesn't mean them. "We don't know why, but someone cursed you. When it began, you didn't remember specifics. You believed that we were together but you didn't remember how it happened or when, or our first kiss. But the spell is getting worse. That's why you think thatâ¦ You think that you have certain feelings for me." Castiel pauses, watches his words sink in. "It's not real, Dean."
The wake is less maudlin. Claire and Amelia planned it together, and it's hard to stay quiet and serious with a background of cheesy pop ballads and a buffet of foods more at home at a kid's birthday party.
Dean raises his eyebrows. "I'm not following."
He gives Cas the trenchcoat back at the hospital and only feels a twinge of grief.
Charlie nurses her 'black magic' java and alligator shaped pancakes as though she's the one who was up driving half the night previous.
There's a clearing up ahead, and a guy in a familiar dark suit waiting nervously next to it.
"Are you going to send me back to Jody's?" Emma asks at last. She stares at the wall for a moment, then turns a determined face on him. "Get me out of the way so you and Uncle Sam can-"
Dean shifts uncomfortably in his seat. He knows that. He knows the Firehouse is a family, they all look out for each other, and he knows they love him. He also knows he's not the only one who cares about Cas or has been helping out. Benny's been baking none-stop since Cas took off work when things got bad with Amelia, not that Cas seems to appreciate it. But him and Cas, it's... different.Â  Cas and Sammy are more important to Dean than anything else in the damn world, and he'd sooner fight his next fire with gasoline than turn away when one of them needs him.
"Math is boring," Emma says.
"Anyway," Emma says. "He seemed to think that if they were able to go after him right now, they already would've before he left."
"I'm not cutting you off. I never did," Sam continues in the face of Dean's utter defeat. "You can still call, visit sometimes. Just not for the job."
"Dean!"
At that Sam pauses, breathing deep as his fists clench around his laptop power cord.
A mile out of town and he calls Emma again.
And they find Cas.
"They are my niece and nephew, too," Naomi interrupts. "I have a right to express concern. And why should they stay with you? What can you offer them?"
Dean scrubs a hand over his face. "Yeah?"
"Did no one tell you not to talk to strangers on the internet?" Dean adds. He doesn't know the details, but he feels the need to draw Linda's glare back to himself.
"Cas," Dean says, stalling the ramble. The dots are starting to connect but he needs Cas to get to the point and be normal about this or he'll never be able to be normal about it himself.
Mrs. Tran rolls her eyes.
Their eyes lock and Dean holds his breath, waiting for Cas' reaction. To see if he still wants to do this now they don't have to.
Dean sighs and wraps her in a hug, even though she stays stiff and uncooperative while he does. He presses a kiss to her hair. "We'll be back soon."
Kevin takes up the explanation, lazily concocting a story about a museum exhibition on Judaism that might have some rare religious texts on angels.
"We'll find somewhere. Set you guys up with warding and supplies. I think Garth has a place," Dean scrambles. They had talked about this, he and Sam, but not in any detail. They've always been One Bridge at a Time type planners, planning out a few options but nothing solid. And this time around they've been a little preoccupied with family drama. "You'd have someone there to protect you, at least."
It's easier to hand Sam the license than to say the words. Dean clears his throat while Sam's eybrows creep up at the words on the page. "We, uh, we need to hold the ceremony as soon as possible, and it needs to look real."
Castiel regrets everything.
There isn't much else to do and Dean really does seem to want to go out. Not to mention that he's less likely to try anything 'non-family friendly' out in public. Perhaps he'll even stop the touching stuff altogether. "Of course."
"I'm glad she was."
"God, I was wrong," Jo says after his impassioned rant about how much laundry Jack manages to get through each day. "You don't just need out of the house, you need to get laid. And if Cas won't do the job..."
Dean stares. "When did he tell you all that?" He'd known Emma had been pestering Cas with questions, but he hadn't realised Cas had actually been
"Mother henning him," Sam finishes.
"Nothin'." Dean shoots her a smile and puts the car in gear.
"How did you find us?" Mrs. Tran demands, supersoaker still raised as if it were a real gun.
"Everything," Castiel says, "nothing. I just want you to-" He can't tell the truth. He can't say he wants Dean to want him for real, without a spell. Dean wouldn't understand, then he'd forget it anyway. It's tempting to tell him about the spell just to erase the last few moments so that Castiel doesn't have to answer at all, but Castiel can't bring himself to manipulate Dean's memory that way.
Dean only hopes he doesn't disappoint too much.
Cas nods his head to the side, a semi-agreement. "Verbally. Kelly was there so she can verify it, but I'm not sure how much weight it'll hold. We didn't think there'd be any issues so we didn't think we needed to worry about it, and before Jimmy... They thought they had time to figure it out. If they ever had to at all."
Dean smiles. "Understood."
"Yeah."
They sit in awkward silence until Uncle Sam shifts and clears his throat. "So is that like an amazon thing? You need lots of protein or something?"
"Who's she?" Kevin asks, wide eyed and exhausted looking as ever. The kid barely looks any older than Emma, though he's got to have at least a year or two on her biological age.
If she knows Emma was kidnapped as a baby, Emma has no doubt Rachel knows she didn't kill her dad. "No. He disappeared on a hunt. They think he got himself killed."
Dean glares at him. "She's my blood. I raised her. Me."
"Yes, it was." Castiel watches the moment start to pass as everything gets relegated to weird hunt related stuff they'll never talk about again. "I meant it though. All of it."
"Garth?" Emma asks dubiously. She's never met him, but Dean's told her stories. Mostly funny ones. In fairness, most stories about Garth are funny stories.
"Shut the door," Emma tells Charlie. "We don't want anyone stumbling in here after us."
screwed up."
Jody stills.
"You know that's not what happened," Dean says. "
Sam doesn't pick up. Dean frowns at the phone and tries again. And again.
In all of his observation (or creepy stalking as Dean would call it) Castiel has never witnessed Dean become flustered with a romantic interest. It's more endearing that Castiel would have imagined. "Neither have I. At all."
"Um," Dean says eloquently. He turns to his now blood-specked daughter. "My kid. Emma."
"Emma!" Dean snaps.
"So, what? You just stroll off into the sunset with your girl and forget about it all? Forget about me?" Dean presses, because he's never been one to resist pressing on a bruise.
Emma, by some miracle, does as she's told. She's sat at the counter in a Starbucks waiting for him when he gets into town. Probably picked the place out of spite, though.
"You know, you probably shouldn't be drinking coffee this late," Dean says, as if he hasn't just upended Castiel's perception of the world. "No one wants a jittery insomniac for a roommate."
Rachel shrugs. "We gotta keep the numbers up somehow. Hunters won't stop coming after us just because we learn how to use a diaphram."
There isn't anything Castiel can say in return. His head is buzzing with words, but there are too many to make them out, just merging into static as his lungs refuse to fill.
"How did you... What are you..." Dean can't decide on a question. "You're not..." She can't be dead. Please, god, don't let her be dead.
And it's back again. "Watch your mouth!"
Sam and Castiel pause, exchanging glances. Sam continues on towards his brother. "Cas told me what's going on. I think we should maybe have a talk. See what else, if anything, has been altered, and try to work out who could be doing this."
"He does," Emma admits. She knows it makes Dad uncomfortable, being reminded of what she is, but he's never loved her any less for it so it doesn't sting too badly.
Cas runs his pencil down the paper until he reaches an uncrossed item. "We've ordered the cake, Ellen's offered to provide the venue and drinks for free, Kelly's got a magician she used at a fundraiser to entertain the children and the drunker adults, the officiant is paid for..."
"Okay. Well, I'm still a ways off Pennsylvania. Best you can do is keep him calm. Maybe do some more research on love spells with Kevin," Sam says reasonably. "If he's still acting... well, not normal, but rational maybe, then there's probably no need to worry just yet. I'll give the wiccan group a call, see who picks up. Maybe they can answer some questions before I get there."
Claire jumps up and grabs at Sam's arm. "C'mon, Jo said she won't dance with me anymore. It's your turn."
"A hunter didn't kill them," Emma says.
"If Dad was here, he'd be stinking up the room with his half a decade old corpse," Dean says. "I'm not really sure what he has to do with any of this."
Dean waits until the others are preoccupied debating a possible alternate spelling, possible typo, before leaning in close to Castiel. "Love you."
"People are always dying."
"We postponed the wedding when Amelia got sick," Cas replies to whatever Naomi said to him. "But if it's truly that important to you that Claire and Jack be a part of a two parent household, then we'll be happy to hold the ceremony as soon as possible."
Dean rolls his eyes. The kid's always had a knack for acting like she's all grown up already, like she knows everything and has been around long enough to be jaded by it. It's only got worse since he's got back. Do all teenagers act like that, or is it just his kid that acts like she's already coming out the other side of a midlife crisis?
Uncle Sam ends his call and avoids looking at her as she climbs onto her bed and empties her bag onto it. He glances over and gets caught on the heap of junk food. "Is that three different cans of spray cheese?" He asks despite himself.
Dean looks at her earnest and slightly hazed eyes. "Jesus Christ! What is this? An intervention? I'm fine! Cas is family, I'm just lookin' out for him."
Sam turns back to look at him. "You holding up okay?"
Dean nods again. "So how do you want your burger?"
"Amazon," Emma clarifies. "Good Amazon, though. No patricide here."
He peels the baby from her arms and tries to ignore how she's already so much bigger than she was just five minutes ago. "How do I look after her?"
Rachel is fierce and proud. She doesn't want to live her life popping out kids any more than Emma does, but she's a true initiate. She's killed before and she's more than happy to do it again. She also loves Taylor Swift and spray cheese, as Emma finds out when Rachel smuggles the latter into the dorms and offers Emma some.
"It... It wasn't like that," Sam says. "We promised, Dean. That we wouldn't do this again, that when we died we'd stay dead. Besides, we didn't know for sure where you'd gone. Emma went out on a hunch, and-"
"I guess," Emma says skeptically. "Why do we do the whole... you know, killing thing, though? If we're trying to rebuild and grow our numbers, it seems dumb. Like hanging up a big sign, 'monsters here, come hunt us'."
Dean decided on a picnic. He won't call it a picnic, instead referring to it as 'hanging out' at the park, but there's a blanket beneath them over the grass and a collection of foods and drinks sat between them that Dean crammed into a cooler on their way out. Castiel has enough second hand pop culture knowledge to know that a picnic between two adults in a relationship is a date.
Emma gives a hard shove and goes flying through the suddenly easily opened door.
Cas' breath hitches andÂ Claire stumbles into action.
"No."
"I'm sorry," Castiel tells him.
"A magic lock? Really?" Dean asks. He doesn't doubt it, but it still sounds dumb to him.
Castiel takes it without enthusiasm. "Thank you, Dean."
His shoulders pull back and his chin raises. He reaches for Dean's hand and lifts it between them, sliding the ring into place. "With this ring, I gladly marry you and join my life to yours."
"I'm making it real," Castiel says. "You're right. Even if the spell caused everything else, it didn't cause this."
"Oh. Um," Sam stutters, looking more unsettled than when he was talking about clowns ten minutes ago. "I, uh, I guess."
"When this is all over I'm taking Cas for your whole inheritance," Dean says, and pulls the chocolate back towards himself. He doesn't even like it that much, he's just making a point.
Cas nods. "We can do most of that ourselves."
"They said it was obvious when you guys were interviewing them that Dean was holding himself back from what he wanted because he thought he couldn't have it. So..." Sam sighs and there's a sound like Sam's pulled the phone away from his ear and put it down.
"You need to get out of that house," she tells him, a firm arm around his shoulders guiding him down the street.
"So why didn't they kill you? What, they just let you hang out for seven months? How did you even find them?" Sam asks.
"Was that-"
"I know."
"Yeah," Dean says, surprised. "I'm good. I mean, it sucks. The whole thing sucks. But I didn't really know her that well, you know?"
"The kitsune chick?" Dean says, frowning. Was that what this was about? "Are you sulking 'cause I killed your girlfriend? Sam, she was killing people!"
Dean may have called him a brother more than once, but Castiel knows full well that Dean would never feel comfortable kissing a man who isn't blood related to him, no matter the context. Dean's always been complicated with his affection, overly aware of how his actions could be interpreted by others and uncomfortable with anything that could attract accusations of softness or homosexuality.
Cas sighs.
"And she was right," Dean cuts him off.
"Jesus Christ," a voice interrupts. An impossible voice. A voice that can't be here, can't be anywhere except in Dean's head. "You really shat the bed this time, didn't you, Dean."
"You knew?" Dean asks. He doesn't need to turn around for Sam to know he's talking to him. There's no way Dad could know about Dean's reasons for getting married if Sam didn't tell him.
"Crowley."
"Then I guess you break up," Sam replies tetchily. "Look, the spell hasn't hurt him. I get it's awkward, but if you could just... I dunno, ask him out or something. You don't have to get married or anything, just make it real for a little while. It's not a big deal. People date and have awkward break ups all the time."
Dean considers the question. Mulls over what he'd do if Dad was still around, or if he found out he was still alive somewhere. "Wouldn't make a difference. I'm getting married, Sammy. He wasn't here for any of the rest of it, so I don't need him there for that. He didn't need my approval to go chasing after a ghost, I don't need his approval for this."
"In love with you."
Dean swallows and looks away as his eyes well up. "You're wrong. We... We kiss all the time. We're together, we've been together!"
Dean laughs, and if it sounds a little off then he'll blame it on the booze. "Fine, whatever. I'm here aren't I? I'm not chained to an ironing board or some shit."
Dean's had a grand total of six hours sleep and his two hour car nap while raising his monster kid over the last two days, unable to sleep too long at a time while she needed watching and feeding and teaching, and it's caught up with him. He's wobbling on his feet and his head feels like cotton. Memories of Cas wading into that lake merge with visions of Emma, dead alongside her mother and he doesn't have the energy to push them away. There's a bottle of booze in his duffel and he wants it like he wants his next breath.
, but he's got over a year of sobriety all told and he's not gonna break that streak while Sam's still in stabbing distance of Emma.Â "I don't know what the hell your issue is, but you're lying to yourself if you think that's it."
The one he wore to the funerals. Yeah, no. Not gonna happen. "Maybe we can..." Dean drags the budget list over. Damn. He'd thought such a small, half-assed wedding would be cheaper. There really isn't money for another suit in there. "Okay, so we ditch the suits. Smart casual, or casual casual. Hell, tikki themed even. Whatever."
Dean glances at Emma.
Emma nods and darts up from her seat. "Let's go."
"Where'd you go?" Emma asks lightly. She hadn't been worried. Not really. It's just hard to rationalise with her instinct not to let him out of her sight now she's finally got him back.
"So you went with them?" Sam asks.
Waking up, his hangover-heightened sense of smell picks up the coat before anything else.
Dean wants to tell him it's okay, that he had the best intentions, but Dean of all people knows that isn't good enough. This is Cas's mess, and he has to deal with it, no matter what his intentions were. No matter that Dean wants him here. Needs him. "Yeah, well. We'll always have you. Don't be a stranger."
Emma looks around again. Okay. That's something. "Thanks."
"Dean-"
"You guys are disgusting," Dean tells them all, Sam included despite his protest that he had nothing to do with the incest talk. He takes a seat next to Castiel and pulls a book towards him.
"Naomi's trying to take the kids," Dean tells him. He's not going to beat around the bush with this. "Cas' lawyer doesn't think he stands much chance as a single guy, and, well, I'm available."
" Dean says dangerously. He's met Naomi a grand total of three times before now, and each was unpleasant enough to make him dislike her. But this is seriously testing his ethics regarding hitting women. If this was his house she'd have been bodily ejected from the front door by now.
"It was supposed to be her birthright, killing you," Lydia says in response to his silence. "But I suppose we'll have to find another way for her to be initiated."
Dad doesn't even acknowledge that she's spoken, eyes still locked on Uncle Sam. "Where is Kevin?"
Sam's sharp inhale is the first thing that really breaks through Dean's shock.
Dean scoffs. "What? You don't wanna hit me up for child support?" He shakes his head. "You know I'm not walking away from this."
"Wh-" Dean breaks off with a disturbed, confused laugh. "I-" He stares helplessly at Castiel, unable to finish whatever it is that he's trying to say.
It's back in its place in the car before he goes to pick up Sam, but it becomes a habit to put it on when he and Sam have split up. A part of his Fed get up that he's careful not to let Sam see.
Like he can hear the maudlin thoughts, Cas grabs Dean's wrist and pulls him upright. "We should dance, too, before Claire forces us into it."
"God, I hate witches," Dean says, almost instinctively.
Charlie's eyes go wide. "You mean you haven't seen... Oh hell no."
"There is one thing I found," Charlie says, whipped cream lining half of her top lip.
The staring thing is a little creepy, but she figures this guy might have been around in the '50s so it's worth a shot asking. "Do you know about any private libraries around here? Or maybe archives? A bunker maybe?" The descriptions in Charlie's sources varied and Emma doesn't know which is more likely to get her results.
"Dean..."
"Maybe he should. It'd make things stick easier," Claire points out. Her voice is light, but she doesn't meet his eyes.
"I have no idea. I'm looking into it."
"Garth can handle it. You can come back and help him clean up once we've got the Trans somewhere safe," Sam says in a poor attempt at being reassuring.
Emma shrugs. "I dunno. He knows I'm a Winchester. I don't know if he knows I'm your daughter."
Cas leaves again, and Dean would scream at him if he could, yell at him to stop leaving all the goddamn time and stay to fix his mess. To fix Dean. By the time they find Cas again, him and Benny that is, he's saner than he's been in months. Scruffy and dirty and nothing like himself, no angelic dry cleaning keeping him pristine. Dean tells himself he doesn't care. Hell, the peach fuzz really does suit him, or would if Dean could let go of his mental image of him.
"Just a happy coincidence," Dad says snidely. "When we're done here, maybe we can take advantage of the reception bar for a little family reunion. It's been awhile."
"He's my uncle," Emma says distractedly. She's already choosing what pie to get, even though Dean hasn't actually agreed to buy any yet.
Dean doesn't like that assumption. There's not much he can do about it, though, so he leaves it.
Dean shrugs.Â "Ten. Call it ten. Cas is working it out with the officiant dude right now."
"Come on," Dean says, throwing bills on the table to cover their bill. "We'll pick up pie and snacks before we say bye to Benny."
They scan through the list together in silence, each unable to wrap their heads around the idea that they might actually be done for now.
"Oh."
Sam's jaw ticks.
"You should have said something before today," Sam snaps. "You could've stopped all this before it went this far! Why didn't you tell me we had something on Crowley?"
"What?" She says indignantly.
As it is Claire is gleefully enjoying her night with the grown ups and trading conspirital grins with Jo, who Dean knows told Claire the coke she gave her had booze in it. It's underhanded, but Dean would rather let that little lie go than have Claire know she's the only one not drinking alcohol and have her get hammered on stealing gulps of other people's drinks. He does remember being her age, and he knows that's what he'd have done. If anything, it's a little shocking to him that Claire can't tell that the only thing Jo spiked her drink with was selzter and lime. He was more than familiar enough to make that distinction by her age.
"What, are you moving to New Orleans now?" Dean asks, a little on the back foot himself. First Sam's leaving him for a chick and a dog, now his daughter wants to move out to an apocalypse bunker.
"No," Dean says with as much finality as he can muster. "I'm not puttin' you in harms way. You stay with Jody and you go to school, just like you kept naggin' me about, and you stay out of trouble. We'll be back when it's done."
"You've never kissed me before," Castiel offers, wincing as he waits for the fallout. Perhaps Dean hadn't fully noticed what he'd done and now he'd withdraw or become angry.
Claire and Cas level her with matching glares, and Dean wonders if it would count against him if he escaped this situation now.
Dean waits for her to finish, but she doesn't. "What are you talking about?"
"You took off without even telling me!" Sam snaps. "I thought you'd been killed, Dean. Why didn't you-"
Cas sighs heavily and shakes his head. "I don't know. I should... I should look in on what's going on in Heaven. If they'll even have me now. I've caused so much damage."
Cas rubs at his forehead and turns towards the kitchen. "I need coffee."
"Maybe," Emma says, meaning 'what the hell are you talking about'. The words make sense individually, but she's not got a whole lot of knowledge to contextualise them. Sometimes it's extremely weird being a one year old teenager.
Emma glares at him.
Emma hops up, ever enthusiastic about dessert and the possibility of pie.
Great. Time for Sam's speech about the sanctity of marriage or something. Dean sighs. "Why? You got another one?"
He tracks Sam down to his bedroom and relays the conversation to him, along with his belief that someone or something is altering Dean's mind. It doesn't take any more than that for Sam to follow him back into the library, despite vacating it a scant five minutes ago.
"It's fine," Emma says, when it looks like Dad might actually argue. "I'll go check on Charlie or something. She's been holed up on her own with those books for long enough, she could probably use a sanity check."
"Any luck getting the door open again?" Emma asks, though she knows the answer.
Sam shakes his head. "Never." He looks at Dean far too seriously for a drunk man surrounded by the strains of the Ghostbusters theme song. "Hey, um, when you get a minute after... everything. There's something I need to talk to you about."
"Alright, alright," Dean holds up his hands. "Think we've established we're not demons. Can we stand down, now?"
"She's not your daughter, Dean," Sam says quietly.
"Why isn't Uncle Sam here?" Emma asks after a moment. She doesn't pass it off as casually as he can tell she's trying to.
Dean scoffs. "Oh, c'mon! I'm a thirty-five year old man. Don't you think it's a little late in the game for me to be worrying about cooties?"
"You won't get far!" Lydia shouts after him, her voice strained and laced with pain.
EmmaÂ gives them her notes. The information she has on the Trans and on Kevin's previous locations, patterns of behviour, known contacts etc. He's smart and has managed to stay ahead of demons and angels alike, but he's just a normal person, or was before the whole prophet thing. He's not overly difficult to track down when you're friends with a hacker and a cop. Sometimes the human way is the better way.
Mrs. TranÂ frowns. "That's why I'm looking for ways for us to defend ourselves."
He walks away a little to make his call, watching with an amused grin as Emma pesters Cas with questions. The angel sure does seem to bring the annoying brat in her to the fore, and he seems no less confused and bewildered by it than he did as Emmanuel.
Emma swallows. "We, uh.... We found a lot of stuff out about Purgatory while we were looking for you."
The sudden pounding at the door throws those plans straight out of the window. Dean has a gun in his hand and his daughter behind him before the third knock.
Dad's jaw twitches but he doesn't comment. "So where is he? He doin' okay?"
"Actually I don't give a shit. You're grounded. And you're homeschooled. Your dad didn't leave you with me so you could go off on your own and disappear for months," Jody rants, pulling Emma inside. "Sit your ass down. I'm getting a coffee and then you're telling me every damn thing you've done for the last seven months."
"Be quick," Dean tells him.
Emma scrunches her nose at the thought of spending her time in a library that probably doesn't have proper air conditioning. She's seen pictures of the building and she wouldn't actually be shocked if they didn't have working electricity.
The man waves off her gratitude as his dog comes sprinting back to him, accounting for his somewhat suspicious presence on the empty land. He leashes the dog and sets off at a slow and steady pace.
"Would you shut the hell up?" Sam snaps.
"Is the marriage even legal? I mean, how did she get you an identity and stuff without going to the police?" Emma asks.
Dean picks at some grass. "Are we okay?"
After that, Sam gets that funny look on his face more often. When Emma asks him about college. When she tells him she doesn't like clowns either. Most of all when she calls him Uncle Sam.
Sam finally turns, and it's not anger or apathy in his eyes as he frowns, brow furrowing under his stupid long hair. "I know. But I've got to try." He sighs, repeats, "I can't keep doing this, Dean."
Cas blinks as if he'd zoned out. He probably had. "The only suit I have is..."
Castiel isn't sure what's happening. "Dean, stop. I can't-"
"I am not!"
"It's nothing for you to worry about," Castiel tells him, climbing to his feet and pulling in as deep breaths as he's able on his way back towards the car.
Dad waits until he has solid eye contact with her, eyebrows slightly raised, waiting for her to come clean of her own accord.
By the time she's on the third location, Emma sincerely wishes she'd opted for the library. Bad air conditioning is still air conditioning after all, and her ass crack is turning into New Orleans' latest swamp. God, it's not even that hot for New Orleans, but she's used to colder climes and this is an above average day for the time of year. She's wiping her damp, gross hair back from her sticky, gross skin and poking at the ground somewhat dubiously with her foot when her neck prickles. She looks around to find a little old man staring at her. She faces him. "Hi."
Cas hesitates.
"You think I-" Dean cuts himself off and thinks longingly of the bar across the street. "I didn't send Cas away, okay? He leaves on his own. And Sam, he... It's not that he doesn't want you around-"
"Hmm?" Dean says as he drops back into Castiel's lap.
Castiel waits for the confusion as Dean searches for a memory that isn't there.
Somehow that doesn't faze Dean as much as Castiel talking did. He reaches over and steals Castiel's beer, taking a sip before putting it down out of the way. He then takes hold of Castiel's hand and starts to play with his fingers. "I, um, I'm not really sure how this goes," Dean admits. "It's been awhile since... Well, I've never really done... this before. Not-not really."
"You're not missing anything with that last one, I promise," Dean says, trying not to eye her built-in weaponry.
Sam sighs but switches out without another word.
Castiel closes his eyes in mingled pain and relief. This is the first time that Dean's actually accepted the truth and it hurts to hear it in place of adamant denials and insistence that they really are together. The relief is short lived as Dean's hand on the side of his neck startles his eyes open again. His vision focuses just in time to be filled with Dean as he leans forward and presses their lips together, soft and pleading.
Castiel smiles. "I would like that very much."
Her mother's side of the family catches up with her at school.
Dean groans inwardly at the reminder of where they are and why. Not that he'd really forgotten, just got a little sidetracked by his only child declaring her intentions to emancipate herself. "Linda-"
"Castiel!" An exasperated voice follows as the front door opens.
"What the hell?" Sam says as soon as their eyes meet.
"What about the police? Did she take you to the hospital, or get the police to look into who you are?" Emma continues. "Or did she just go 'hey, clearly the rational thing to do here is take him straight home and bang him'?"
He waves his cell phone around as if that explains it. "Catching up. Jody says hi."
Naomi's lips thin. "If you insist on this foolish charade, I'll see you in court. I'll look forward to the wedding invitation."
Dean looks up when Castiel draws close again. "Everything okay?"
"Charlie?"
"People are still dying and you just left," Sam points out.
"You shouldn't have got tied up in this," Dean continues. He forces a laugh and visibly erects his bravado around himself. "Freaking witches, man! The world'll do anything to mess with us, won't it?"
He doesn't stop until Emma's crying takes on a pained edge. The nearest supermarket is only a few minutes away, and he hopes they can make it that far without the now teething baby having issues. The parking lot is relatively empty, and he stops to feed her and change her into a larger outfit from the bag before heading into the store in search of a car seat and supplies. By the time he leaves the store, his impulsive decision has solidified. He has a camera and a bag full of groceries and kids' stuff and a plan is starting to come together. Emma's already started mimicking words and desperately needs another size up in clothes and diapers.
"Yeah," Emma says.
'Emmanuel' as he's calling himself, smiles at Emma sweetly enough that Dean knows he can't see what she is. Or doesn't know what it is he's seeing. There's no way he's faking.
"I know, I know, there was a lot going on. But the heart wants what it wants, right?" Dean says lightly, a hint of humour colouring his words but not changing them into a joke. "I mean, I always thought you were hot, but until you went to angel boot camp, I thought it was just Jimmy's body I found hot. Then Jimmy turned out to have nothin' on you. Still, thought maybe it was just a bit of a complex, you know? You did pull me from the pit, maybe that was just making me... I dunno, confused or whatever."
"Didn't Amelia say she wanted you to have custody?" Dean asks. "No way a judge'll go against that, right?"
"Okay?"
Emma smiles and lets her eyes go back to hazel. "Better than my family. They disembowel the boys."
Charlie finds some references to a group known as the 'Men of Letters', which they both agree is eye rollingly patriarchal, and some clues about a chapter house in New Orleans. Apparently these guys were supernatural scholars with chapters all over the country, until they suddenly went quiet in the late '50s. Honestly, Emma's about 99% sure it's going to be a waste of time, but Charlie seems to think it's worth looking at, and unless they want to track down Kevin Tran and turn him over to a demon, they've got no other leads.
Emma convinces Cas to stick around through a combination of constant bombardment and the ever famous kid strategy of 'just five more minutes'. Cas doesn't look all that pleased about it, though he makes no move to stop her.
Castiel glances back towards the kitchen, where Dean's making him a hot cocoa on his request. They'd wanted him out of the way while they had this conversation to avoid the pointless stress that comes with trying to explain it all to Dean only for him to become extremely upset and then immediately forget the whole conversation.
Emma laughs. "Yeah. I know."
"Fergus," Naomi says, unsure and questioning.
"Like what?" Dean asks. He looks up at Castiel as though he might have the answers. When no answers are forthcoming he furrows his brow and attempts to work it out himself. "Is it a PDA thing? 'Cause I gotta say, I knew you were a prude, Sammy, but this is a bit of an overreaction."
"It really isn't," Emma assures her.
The coat is neatly folded in the backseat before he even exits the car, heaving into the bushes lining the quiet road where he'd parked.
to do. It's not like she's had a huge amount of opportunity to find out between growing up in a motel room, having no friends at school, boarding at monster high and then road tripping to find obscure supernatural knowledge about Purgatory.
Emma goes to change into her brand new pyjamas and brush her teeth and Dean considers what the hell they're supposed to do next. Things haven't stopped with Emma's arrival. They still have Leviathan and Sam's messed up head to deal with, and now they have a teenager along with them. It feels like it's been a lot longer than two days.
"Since when?" Castiel asks as gently as he's able with the pain and rage at the unfairness of it all tightening his chest.
Castiel watches Dean, desperately wishing he had the words. They came so easily before, when he was telling Dean how much he means to him, when he was telling him he meant it. But now, when Dean's waiting for him to answer, he has nothing to say. Or too much to say. Either way, he's not speaking.
Claire, on the other hand, seems satisfied with the plan. "She can't just take us away because she's our aunt. We barely know her, or her creepy husband."
He knows he shouldn't ask, that asking is just buying into this fantasy and he can't afford to do that. But the weight and nearness of Dean has him feeling edgy and unreal. As if nothing he says right now can possibly matter in the real world. "How do you feel about me?"
Sam's hands twitch with the barely concealed urge to protect his precious laptop. "What for?"
They both pull a face at that. Emma adds on a sound of disgust. "Were there really no women?"
Emma hands over the phone without argument, but avoids his eye.
That cake is appallingly sweet and one of the most overpriced of the bunch, but Dean steels himself in resignation. "We'll get that one then."
Dean can't hear Naomi's response to that over the blood rushing in his ears.
Sam cuts off as he catches sight of Emma. Takes in the piles of kids clothes and toys and books scattered around the room.
His shoulders drop in relief. "Sammy."
Kevin glares at him. "Oh, so you can hear me."
"I am fine," Castiel replies. "I think... I think I'm a little tired from the drive."
"Do you think Uncle Sam will be up to helping me with my Latin again?" Emma asks as they return the car. Dean shoves a few bills from his wallet behind the mirror as an apology for whatever wear Emma's caused to the car.
"Follow me." And with that she starts walking back the way she came.
"C'mon!" Dean insists. "We can go outside in the actual daytime, sans suits. Catch some rays."
"Craigslist," Emma says brightly. Dean sometimes struggles to tell which is the act: the sarcasm or the preppiness. Most of the time he thinks neither, sometimes both.
Going back to work the following monday without Cas feels wrong. It felt wrong after Jimmy, and it felt wrong when Amelia got sick, and it feels wrong now.Â The other guys are great, and he'd trust any one of them with his life three times over, but they're not Cas.
Cas' eyes lock onto his in the intense way they have since the first day they met, like he's seeing every part of Dean and weighing him up. It used to make him uncomfortable, but now... Well, Cas doesn't quite look at anyone else that way, so Dean guesses it makes him feel kinda special to warrant the attention. To be interesting enough for Cas to single him out for that kind of focus.
They play along with the ruse a while longer. He has a feeling they both know what's really going on, but he isn't sure how to broach it until Emma starts crying. Lydia picks her up and gives her a bottle and Dean tries and fails to feel nothing at the sight of the baby's pink, distressed face. It comes out without him meaning for it to. "She's mine, isn't she?"
Emma shakes her head. "He doesn't want anything to do with me. He's made that pretty clear."
And if it wasn't obvious enough through context, the way Dean relaxes onto the ground with his head in Castiel's lap would probably be enough of a clue. And Castiel isn't sure what to do. He doesn't want to go through telling Dean, again, that their relationship is a figment of his imagination, much less in public, but he has no idea how to manage Dean pressing his face into Castiel's stomach to keep the sun from his eyes. He has no idea how to manage the lazy, crinkly smile Dean aims up at him when he hands Dean his sunglasses, or the contented hum Dean lets out when Castiel angles himself to shade Dean's face from the sun.
"You've got to be kidding," Dad's voice interrupts again.
"That's it, you're grounded until you're sixty," Dean replies easily, shifting to support her weight. "Good luck finding someone to marry your wrinkly ass then."
Sam and Kevin don't look up from their reading.
"I got a call from Jody nearly eight months ago," Sam says, staring right back into Emma's laser focused gaze. "She was frantic. Emma didn't come home from school. She couldn't find her anywhere."
"It's alright," Castiel tries to reassure him. He knew Dean didn't really feel the same way, and as painful as it is to hear it, it's worth it to have Dean back in his right mind.
At least whatever Charlie's learned from the New Orleans Bunker will probably be interesting, and they might find enough down time to watch some more old cult TV shows. It'll be good to be likened to a vampire slayer rather than a monster again, and she won't miss the constant suspicious glances, some of which even come from her dad since he saw her brand. Since she told them about Crowley.
If she took a picture of Rachel with her when she left, then no one will ever know who it's of. And if it's a little water damaged in the corner, no one's there to know where the drops of liquid came from. She still aches from sparring and from the torture her 'teachers' included as part of their lesson plans, and she's exhausted from watching the fire burn down to embers. She couldn't leave until she knew it was done. It had to be done, it was only a matter of time before everyone in that building, including Emma, went out to kill innocent men and give birth to a new generation of girls who would be tortured and brainwashed until their DNA was the most human thing about them. But they still deserved a proper funeral. A proper vigil.
"Some of the documents I managed to sift through before I got locked out mentioned legacies. Like, descendants of the Men of Letters," Charlie continues obliviously. "They seemed pretty sure their kids and grandkids and so on and so forth would take up the family business, and they prepped for it. There were training manuals that included bits and pieces about it, but mostly it just seemed to be taken as read. Even the daughters were expected to marry potential recruits."
She barely has time to inspect a few likely looking shrubs before her cell rings. She answers while poking at a large rock. "Yeah?"
"Okay, so food. What are we thinking?" Dean asks. "Buffet? Might be easier and cheaper than a sitdown."
Sam makes a cut off noise as Castiel interrupts whatever greeting he was about to vocalise. "What happened? Are you okay? Is Dean okay? He hasn't-"
Emma finally starts to show a little empathy. "I don't know. But I'd maybe try and figure it out before you go home."
The way he's always known deep down that he'd never have.
Lydia freezes, then fixes him with a fake ass smile that's about as friendly as a punch in the face. "You're funny."
"I'll keep you updated, just... don't go getting yourself involved," Dad tells her. "We got this."
Then again, from a personal perspective that may have been better. Maybe if John hadn't outlived Mary by so many years, Dean wouldn't have been stuck watching him turn into the bitter, angry and borderline abusive man he became. Maybe Dean and Sam could have grown up with someone more like Bobby, who would have wrapped his arm around Dean the way Cas keeps doing to Claire, instead of handing him a shotgun and disappearing on cases for weeks at a time.
Uncle Sam brought the Impala, he kept it after all. Dad looks so happy at the sight of that damn car that Emma almost changes her mind. She's already reluctant to separate again, and the idea of him driving off in the Impala with Uncle Sam like nothing ever changed, like it's where he belongs, is enough to have her eyeing her own hunk of junk bitterly. She'll never belong that way.
Dean shrugs. "No arguments there. Thought you brain boxes were supposed to like it, though."
Besides, Dean was driving highways at younger than... well, not younger than a year old. But younger than she is physically and legally.
"It was hard, is the point," Emma forces herself to come to the point. "It was our only lead when we started."
"She's a hair puller," Dean jokes. "But no, we're not doing that."
"Emma." Dean says firmly.
"You-"
Dean frowns. "We have a flower budget?"
Dean rolls his eyes and tries to focus on Mrs. Tran. "Just... Let us get you somewhere safe, okay?"
"Cas is holding up pretty well," Sam says. They both watch as Cas bounces Jack on his knee and nods along earnestly to whatever Kelly is saying.
They both hold the silence. There's not much to say. Dean's brother wanted him to stay dead.
"That's what they said! You get together for real, and Dean goes back to normal," Sam tells him.
"I should leave," Castiel suggests. "I could go back to Pennsylvania and try to track down the witch. She may be a part of the group we met."
It's not that Dean's never suggested a morning off before, but Castiel can't help but wonder if Dean would be suggesting this if he wasn't under the influence of a spell.
Dean sits down begrudgingly.
"I'm just-"
"Yeah, it's me. How far out are you?"
Emma turns back to her book. "When you and Benny were messing with my car."
"Who's this?" Benny asks when the field is clear. He sounds far too casual for the suspicion written across his face.
Jody's lips thin like she knows Emma isn't telling her the whole truth, but she doesn't press the issue.
Sam shifts. "I mean, I think we all assumed that, well, you would be the one with a problem with the, um... PDA."
Castiel debates whether or not to sit down again, hovering uncertainly in place until Dean catches his hand once more and squeezes it.
"I fail to see how-" Cas starts.
Emma's wide eyed and terrified as he opens the door, even knowing by the name who's waiting behind it. "Dad?"
A week later, he takes Sam to the hospital. Leaves him there. There's a miracle guy Dean's got to go find, but if he's honest with himself, he doesn't think there are any more miracles left out there for them. They've used up their allotted and then some.
Emma can't get near him without him lashing out, and Dean can't get more than one sentence of sense out of him. Sam ends up in the loony bin, and Dean doesn't know what they do now. How to save his brother. How to keep what's left of his family together.
"Which brings me to my second reason for being here." Dad turns towards the rows of fold out chairs. "Fergus Crowley, you're under arrest on charges of embezzlment, money laundering, conspiracy to distribute-"
"My kid," Dean interrupts, Emma's breakdown still too recent a memory for him to allow talk of her origin in front of her. "Sammy, this is Emma. Emma, Uncle Sammy."
Emma nearly considers walking straight back out, but she's no coward. This is her and Dad's room, and she doesn't really think Uncle Sam will hurt her. Not without a reason.
Sam shakes his head. "How would we explain what we were doing there to Dean? It's fine. I'll get it done. We'll tell Dean I'm tracking down a lead on some information about the trials or something. He'll be back to normal before he even thinks to question it."
"How old were you when you had her? Were you a teen dad?" Kevin asks.
Emma swallows. "About?"
Sam pulls a face. "Maybe. But I don't think that's a good idea. We don't know what the spell will do to him if you're not here. Love spells can get messy if the focal point of the victim's love rejects them in any way."
"Ignore it," Dean orders.
Her fingers are crossed in hope as she brings her loot back to the motel room, but it does no good. Uncle Sam's still there, talking away to his girlfriend on the phone. Dad's gone, though.
"No!" Emma says. Then, "It didn't get that far. Charlie unsummoned him when he said he wanted Kevin."
Dean kind of always assumed the former. He's known he's going to go out that way since he was a kid and yeah, it sucks, but he tried normal with Lisa and that didn't suck any less. And he has Emma, now. Can't really retire to a nice little house in a nice little town and forget about the life when you have a kid with red eyes and claws. But Sam could, couldn't he? He was happy at school with his pretty fiance and their normal life. Happy with his girlfriend and his dog these last couple months. "Yeah, well. Normal ain't an option for all of us."
"You're-"
"I'm also single, low income, in a high risk career, have no savings to speak of and no family support," Cas responds. His voice is tight with anger and helplessness. "Naomi and Crowley will be seen as a more stable environment, and I have no more claim to them as their uncle than she has as their aunt."
He hasn't told either of them about Emma.
"I don't think so," Dean tells her. He doesn't say Sam wouldn't let him stick around anyway. A monster niece is one thing, and even that was touch and go a lot of the time, a random vampire Dean brought back with him from monster hell won't fly. Dean knows that.
Castiel has known Dean a long time. Not in comparable terms; he's an angel, in those terms he's known Dean for less time than it took for Gabriel to take a nap after delivering a message. Even in terms of humanity, Dean's had his favourite shirt for longer than they've known each other. But in terms of knowledge, in terms of how long Castiel has truly known anyone, his relationship with Dean has been a long one. He knows Dean Winchester better and has done so for longer than he has known any other being, even those who Castiel has been technically related to for eons. He knows his deepest hopes and fears, his best and worst moments, his greatest and most deplorable aspects.
They pull up outside the hospital and Dean gets a very bad feeling about it. "Emma, wait in the car."
Emma shrugs. "Only what I told you on the phone. They're holed up in a closed down diner a couple streets over. Don't think anyone else has arrived yet, but who the hell knows who Mrs. Tran's been talking to. She must be pretty desperate to be talking to strangers on the internet, and desperate people make dumb mistakes."
He stops on the way and goes to a bar. He wears the trenchcoat over his plaid and tries not to feel self conscious about it as he pushes through to order his drink. Some drunk splashes beer on the sleeve and Dean almost punches him out then and there, mostly stopped by the brewing panic over whether the liquid will stain and whether there's anything he can do to stop it.
