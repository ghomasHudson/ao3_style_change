"Fantastic!" John exclaimed as the antennae bobbed furiously.
John started when he realized he was being addressed directly. “Oh, um…I suppose…bacon would be nice.”
John and Greg both gaped at her as she cackled.
"Not true. Don't you remember our first date?"
John paused. "I can't say I'm not intrigued as to what you're going to suggest..."
It was uncomfortable at first, after spending so much of the past few weeks forcing a distance between them, but after a few minutes, Sherlock started to melt into the warm touch at his side. His spine relaxed, his head lolled onto John’s shoulder, and his hand even fell to rest on John’s knee.
“Well, anyway. Ready?”
“Calm down, John, the match doesn’t start for another—” he looked at his watch “—twenty minutes.”
John chuckled, but the little stars remained in his eyes. "No, actually. Can you guess?"
“Yeah, if I’m lucky.”
"Here," Sherlock panted, nearly grinning.
“Yes, Mum, I’m going to John’s rugby match.”
Waking up three feet above the sheets is surprisingly easy to overlook, or at least dismiss as the remnant of a forgotten dream. Sherlock Holmes discovered this on the sixth of January, 1993. When he hit the sheets a few seconds after waking, he started, but he soon rubbed his eyes and stood, cursing his unconscious mind for the scare.
“Watson, did you order sugar strands?”
"Aw, sweetheart," John laughed.
“Sherlock, it’s your friend, John!”
Sherlock grinned. "Shut up."
"Burned himself? He's not at A&E again, is he?"
"Why are you doing this?" he repeated softly.
Meanwhile, John was spinning the bottle. Sherlock didn't think about the possibility of it landing on him when someone else spun until it did.
"Gary?"
“What is it dear?”
“But perhaps love makes us mad,” Mr. Holmes continued, and John felt himself go a bit red. “I’ll let you in on a secret, though.” He leaned in and stage-whispered, “It’s the best kind of madness there is. Of course,” he went on, sitting up straight again and carrying on in a casual tone, “you already knew that.”
“For God’s sake, just tell him,” Mycroft muttered from the entryway.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So?” John said when he stepped onto the platform.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around him. “Is this alright?”
After fixing the new injury, John turned on the telly and sat next to Sherlock, watching him struggle with the urge to get up and climb on something. He grinned. “Comfortable?”
"I'm sorry for being such a prat."
No one seemed to know what to do. Andrew continued hiccupping. Sherlock and his parents sat, wide-eyed. Molly looked like she was about to fall off her chair. Mycroft, though, looked calmer than ever—perhaps his recent brush with Aunt Wendy had made him more susceptible to sympathizing with anyone who might have the audacity to stand up to her.
“Don’t mention it, dear,” his mother said, and Sherlock began to get irritated.
Have a lovely two weeks, unless you're reading this after the first of August 2014. Regardless, I'll see you when the next chapter loads. Or...you know...uploads.
That wasn’t to say that it wasn’t a difficult feat. He had to avoid looking at John for too long, avoid touching any part of him below the neck, or the whole wall would collapse. He knew because it almost had just a few minutes ago; he’d looked away from the muscles that stretched between John’s broad shoulders just in time to catch it as it began to tumble.
Sherlock, startled, attempted to regain some of his dignity, but only managed to fall into the tub.
John imagined Sherlock was lying beside him. There was nothing else he could do to calm himself.
"Did you think I was lying?"
a child."
“Hmm.” Sherlock nodded.
“No, I suppose not.” John grinned and crossed his arms, leaning against the door. “I’ll wait.”
. He'd left his dressing gown in his room again.
“Mr. Watson!” The voice was stern but kind. “What on earth d’you think you’re doing?”
“Of course! Is Molly coming, or will it just be the two of us?”
“Jim Moriarty. Hi.”
"I'd still like it. You could dye it green and it would make no difference to me." John paused and lifted his face from Sherlock's neck. "Please don't dye your hair green."
“What? No, Sherlock, we have to stay, we’ve got to wait here. We can’t just leave a bomb lying around.”
“I know.”
“I’m going on a date. We’re going on a date. I’m going on a date with John Watson.”
—you were the key.” Hands were removing his coat.
he’d said. So he hadn’t been able to make the call in their presence…meaning he didn’t want them to know he was making it.
John: 18
Sherlock did the bare minimum and folded his legs where he sat on the floor. He’d already taken his shoes off when he came in; he didn’t need any furniture-collapsing mishaps to make the evening more interesting.
He made to move, to stand up, but before he could do so, the sniper’s red light reappeared on his chest, filling his heart with even more anxiety than what had occurred under threat of being detonated. He looked up to see the matching streak of glowing scarlet across Sherlock’s head and his breath caught. How many snipers did Moriarty have in his control, and when was he going to make them back down?
"No, they do. There's a girl in my chemistry class who refused to talk to me when she found out we were together."
“Suit yourself.”
"Sherlock, why aren't you in school?"
“Nothing. I just—”
“Come on, Greg, it’s not like we’re going to throw someone off it or—or—vandalize it…”
With St. Valentine's Day on the horizon, John was desperate to get something good. He and Sherlock had been to nearly every store at Brent Cross, and he still wasn't sure what to get.
“And perhaps we can skip the studying and go straight to the fifth-floor tapestry, huh?” John suggested.
"I’m sorry I involved you in this. I never meant for you to get in the middle of this."
Sherlock: 10
“And that was the day we knew for sure that I would be getting my letter when the time came.”
“Sherlock, what about your tea?”
“Nine.”
"It's not...lovage, is it?"
“That’s exactly what I do.”
“Now, hang on. That was one try. What memory did you use?”
“And then there was
not to have seen it. To us, he was just a bigoted old fool. But after a few drinks that night, his secrets started pouring out. No one knew what to do. We all just sat there as he went on, describing the last woman he tortured. She was a Muggle, married to a Ministry worker—Jenny Hooper.”
Sherlock sighed and shut his laptop. "Relax, John. We will be
John thought there was something extremely endearing in the way the entire Holmes family led him to the sitting room after dinner, bickering over, of all things, whose gift it was no trouble to get. This, before the gifts had even been opened.
"Alright." John smiled, more confident. "Another."
"Oh, my God, Sherlock. Jesus. Sherlock." He wanted to throw his arms around his neck, hold him there in the alley for days, but held himself back. Instead, he tenderly touched his fingers to the bruises along Sherlock's cheek.
"See anything interesting?" John waggled his eyebrows as they stepped off the lift.
"Okay, then, what do you know now that escaped your omniscience before, oh
“You realize this is our last night, right? We go back to Hogwarts tomorrow.”
“That requires quite a bit of strong magic, dear,” his mother cut in. “Only the Council can legally carry it out. You’ll need special permission.”
“After dinner.”  Sherlock let his feet drift back underneath him and pulled John upright as well. “We should get ready.”
That match had caused a lot of uproar among older Ravenclaws, students who knew Harry and her reputation for raising hell. They had assumed like-sister-like-brother, and that John had done the deed on purpose, and demanded if not a forfeit from Gryffindor, then a rematch as soon as Wilkes recovered. Their wishes had not been granted, and many sixth and seventh year Ravenclaws still gave him dirty looks in the corridors.
Wilkes chuckled and turned to leave.
John looked alarmed. "What is it? Is something wrong?" He reached for the door handle, the key still turned in its hole.
Sherlock stood and glared at him. “Wilkes.”
“John!” Mike Stamford said on sight of him, seeming relieved he’d found someone to talk to and joining John in his walk up the steps to the Entrance Hall. “I looked everywhere for you on the train. What on earth were you doing?”
The eagerness with which Sherlock kissed him was as endearing as it was arousing. The contrasting sensations of his heart fluttering lightly and blood rushing hotly through his veins sent him into a frenzy which left him clawing at Sherlock’s shoulder blades, the silk of his dressing gown sliding under his fingers and long, wheezing breaths stuttering.
“Yes.”
John looked at Sherlock, who smirked and followed, before following as well.
John shook his head and grinned. “I’d rather save it for when I need it.” He pressed his lips chastely against Sherlock’s.
"A game?"
Alright, that's the end of our holiday fun. We'll go back to every other weekend now, starting the 17th of January. How appropriate that Sherlock's birthday falls on the day before my spring classes start! The beginning of my semester would certainly be better with a comment or two (she said sheepishly).
And so John decided--as he often did--that he should give Sherlock exactly what he wanted.
"Mummy bought it for me just for sleepovers with you."
“Well, I was having a bit of trouble in Potions, and Sherlock offered to tutor me.”
John:10
, because I’m a complete arse and I thought that if I just waited until I could control my powers—”
Harry shook her head. "I should have known it was something ridiculous. Only you could burn your feet in the kitchen."
“What? Why?”
“I don’t have one.”
"What if I say the wrong thing? Or if John starts crying?" He stopped, stared straight ahead in horror. "What if
John laughed and kissed him again. He was about to mention the advantages of never leaving the room ever again when there was a knock at the door.
“How do I fix it?” Sherlock begged.
"Exactly! I can't be expected to go cold turkey."
John kissed Sherlock on the cheek.
"Tourist," Sherlock sighed.
me! And he did it in front of everyone! None of my friends will even talk to me anymore." He kicked a rock that was near the edge of the curb.
Sherlock: 26
"Dis-disguises?"
like it.”
“Please, John, it’s not as though it makes any difference. It’s not like he’s going to strip down to his knickers in the sitting room. It’s not as though it’s news to any of us.” Sherlock said, snapping him out of his shock.
John: 20
Sherlock was slow in his answer. "Yes."
“Well,
John nodded.
“I had an uncle who was a Death Eater,” Sherlock said hesitantly.
After about fifteen minutes of debating the pros and cons of skipping out on their responsibilities, Sherlock would point out that they needed to leave in twenty if they were going to. John would make a surprised yelp and jump up from the table, headed for the bathroom. Sherlock would casually follow him, and do everything in his power to distract him from the devilishly quick shower he took.
Sherlock made an uninterested noise.
John knew better by now than to ask how he knew. “Yes, gifts. And you’re going to stay out of the sitting room until tomorrow.”
"That woman over there." Sherlock nodded at the woman two tables over. "She's going through a divorce."
John put his foot down. "Alright, we've got to stop if you can't breathe."
John shrugged. "I guess so."
John hadn’t noticed his own parents arriving on the scene, but he heard his mother say, “You take John. We’ll follow in our car.”
"Let's hope so." He glanced up at him. "So..."
He didn’t know when it turned into a dream, but the next thing he knew, a sliver of sunlight woke him up through the curtains that he’d drawn around his four-poster. He was the first awake, but Moran was stirring, so he took as long as he dared to get dressed, throwing on jumper after jumper before making a face and discarding each. Finally, he settled on the one with the brown stripes and made it out the door just as he heard Seb getting out of bed.
"Yes. I'm going to dance with you all night, John Watson."
“At least he’ll have the courtesy to get everything out before the fires,” she said as she helped John heft his suitcase into the boot of a taxi.
“I know, Sherlock. I love you, too.”
If you've stuck with me, thank you. If you've just read it all the way through for the first time, thank you. Also, thank you to
Sherlock didn’t answer, simply led him by the hand down the hidden corridor, all the way downstairs, and down another corridor leading to a relatively boring painting of fruit in a bowl. When he tickled the pear, the painting swung forward, revealing a hole much like the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
"Sherlock--"
"What way?"
"Why me?"
“But none of them were any more dangerous than a few things being thrown at Mycroft’s head, with my hands. My parents were worried—they’d already decided I was probably a Squib. So had Uncle Traichan.”
John laughed quietly as he lifted himself up and reached out to untie the tie. "Good?"
“Do you mind?” he asked Sherlock, as though they’d simply been chatting in a café.
Mycroft snorted. “What happened, hmm? Have you got yourself a little…bully?”
John loved that mouth. Perhaps even more, he loved that it belonged to the person it belonged to.
He sniffed the strip of paper.
Although when they reached the hospital wing an irritable Madam Pomfrey, after giving them each a quick once-over and deciding nothing vital was missing or damaged, assigned them two separate beds, Sherlock almost immediately commandeered half of John’s when she left the ward.
“My family all have magical powers. They don’t come in until your sixteenth birthday, so I’ve only had mine for about a month, and I’m still trying to control them.”
“You never think too much.”
"It is?"
"Keep doing what?" John stroked again.
He raised his wand furiously and shouted, "
, for Christ's sake.
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
"The...the stinger..." John was wiping tears from his eyes.
"I just...I mean...I'm so sorry. I thought you were a girl." She put her face in her hands.
“John?”
“Yeah. Have fun?”
"Mr. Holmes," Professor McGonagall began, but then she saw John slightly behind him. For a moment, she seemed at a loss for words. "Mr. Watson! What on earth are  you doing up here?"
John paused at her tone, then went on, “Yeah, he’s a genius at Potions. A genius at lots of things, really.”
"The socks aren't actually helping."
John chuckled. “Oh, that. I thought you’d enjoy that.”
He came to the park and sat on the bench where John had kissed him five years ago, after moving his things into the flat and getting a bite to eat at the stand on the corner. He smiled sadly at the memory.
“I’m warning him about you,” John said bitterly.
“Another relative?” John asked, raising his eyebrows.
Sherlock, however, preferred spontaneity.
At her tone, John glared. "Right. That's enough meddling out of you."
“So are we going to fall asleep up here again?” John asked with a laugh.
“Go on, Sherly. Tell your John about that time you murdered your brother’s cat,” Mason continued from across the table. John was suddenly able to place what he hadn’t liked in the boy’s face—he was always sneering, even when his face otherwise seemed to be neutral.
"Can't I just enjoy my meal without being made fun of?"
Sherlock couldn’t disagree. The jumper had quickly turned into one of his favorite articles of clothing. In fact, he’d wondered ever since he found out about the magic in his family whether Aunt Dell had put some sort of enchantment on it to make it fit perfectly.
In silent agreement, they handed each other their gifts and began unwrapping them. Both smiled as John revealed a new book of advanced Healing potions and Sherlock uncovered a pair of protective goggles.
Sherlock smirked. “Loads.” He stopped in front of them. “Where’s Mummy?”
"I'm getting too old, Sherlock. Harry stopped a couple years ago."
John stared at Sherlock, who stared back with wide eyes, unaware of the conversation that was happening on the other end.
finished her illustration of
The dark look that Wendy shot at her twin was so brief that John almost thought he’d imagined it. Then she turned to him. Without looking away from him, she asked, “And who’s this, then?”
"Oh, not that again. It's not important!"
"You can't guilt trip me. I know you too well."
Mike shook his head at the two of them. He smiled. "I'm off to class. I would offer to tell Professor Binns where you are, Sherlock, but I doubt he'll notice."
"I am quite the catch. I think Winnie Rollins has been eyeing me from across Mr. McKenzie's classroom."
"John?"
That was the last pub they went to. After that, Greg had had mercy on them all and declared himself too tired to move on. He helped his limping friends into a cab.
"If it's any consolation, you've fooled me as well, which is much more difficult to do."
"You bloody git," John muttered fondly, periodically glancing over at Greg's discomfort at having to witness such an obvious display.
"Batman?" Sherlock murmured against John's throat.
"Then calm down and just tell me everything I missed."
“Perfect, my boyfriend’s mother would be able to tell as soon as we came out of his room whether we’d just been shagging. That’s exactly what a man likes to hear.”
a huge flirt? What about you, mister 'one drink and he can't keep his hands off'?"
"How do you know?"
“Thank you, Sherlock.” John grasped Sherlock’s hand tightly. “Now, can we get upstairs for a little birthday snog?”
of my work."
There was a certain pitch in Sherlock's voice, a tone that made his words unsure, like a question.
“Maybe,” John replied, then soon added, “Maybe not.” He did up the last button before he turned to Sherlock and continued to tease him. “You don’t? I mean, it is rather domestic, and you being—”
He shook his head and grimaced. “I’m not going to do that, Harry.”
The song was ending, as was the evening.
John’s laughter echoed off the parapet.
"But how do you know all this?"
Hello again, it's a Potterlock weekend!
“Could you follow me?”
Something he never wanted to see.
John smiled. It didn’t matter what Sherlock thought, there were people who cared about him, and Greg Lestrade was one of them.
"I was assaulted," Sherlock finally answered.
"Safer?"
. What Greg didn't know--but John did--was that not only was it the first movie that they had ever interrupted to make out, but that Sherlock also had a bit of a thing for Patrick Swayze.
“No it bloody well is not. You let that maniac go,” John responded as Sherlock cut him free of the ropes. They drifted across the surface of the dark water like lazy serpents.
Sherlock had always been a little strange, but that was nothing compared to the way the rest of his family behaved. He trudged down to the kitchen in brand new trousers and a button-down that he would wholeheartedly deny carefully choosing from the ranks of its fellows, his suppressed uneasiness in no way relieved by the stares of his parents.
"Urgh! I don't know, something irresponsible!"
“What, no goodnight kiss?”
Sherlock leapt over the small fence and reached up to John's neck, successfully locating a small blade just like that of the armour he was holding.
“Oh, but they do. Mycroft’s just starting Apparition lessons. He’s doing quite brilliantly.
“Better?”
But here was the most beautiful person Sherlock had ever seen, sitting on the floor with him outside his dormitory while his roommate fucked some guy in the middle of the day, just to keep him company, and the situation was so bizarre he almost laughed, but instead he surprised even himself by asking, "Are you doing anything Friday night?"
“Oh, now, Sherlock, we both know that was just a test. A test you seem to be failing, if you think I was actually serious.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I hardly ever sleep.”
“Thanks for being there for him before I was.”
"Alright, Sherlock, you're ready.
“Sherlock doesn’t make friends easily. He doesn’t normally care for people at all, much less people such as yourself.”
John looked startled. “That’s not—Sherlock, what are you talking about?”
John shushed him and squeezed his hand, already drifting off. “Sherlock, would you just shut up for once?”
"I don't know, I was a stupid little kid!" Sherlock snapped.
"Sherlock...what is this?"
They stepped into the lift. "You mean you didn’t pick that outfit for exactly the way your arse looks in it?"
“Don’t get dressed,” Sherlock said suddenly.
John blinked and shook his head. He would never be able to understand that girl.
Finally, the phone was lowered from Moriarty’s ear. “Sorry. Wrong day to die.” He seemed disappointed, but also a little lost in thought, like a new plan was in the works, one that required all of the brainpower he could muster.
Mycroft sighed. “There’s an entrance to the Other Realm in the upstairs cupboard.”
John smiled at the befuddled look on Sherlock’s face. They reached the gate, and he reached out and took Sherlock’s hand. “And I’m going on a date with Sherlock Holmes.”
"Morphine. Some cocaine here and there," Sherlock replied, matter-of-factly, but with less of his former bravado.
Siger shushed him.
"Why should I let you beat yourself up over something you can't control? Especially something that doesn't matter?"
“Kreacher’s got quite a fondness for me,” Sherlock explained. “He’s very eager to please.”
A vaguely familiar voice babbled excitedly about Sherlock, but John had trouble understanding him through the ringing in his head. The bump his head had taken from the butt of a pistol wasn’t doing anyone any favors.
“Well, he survived for over thirty years without you.”
"Then get up."
"School?"
“I saw you in Hogsmeade today.”
," Sherlock said incredulously.
"It's obvious. Those lances are designed to look deadly, but couldn't really hurt you if you were accidentally stabbed. The actors are highly trained to hit in non-life threatening areas of their opponents' bodies--shoulders, arms, and the like. Our knight was slain when the lance pressed against the breastplate of his armour, he fell off his horse, and he was trampled to death."
Sherlock knelt down to the man's level. "Yes, and so you tried to kill him, too," he said, suddenly serious.
John rolled his eyes. “So this
Sherlock stared as the vase morphed into a skull. “That sounded completely and utterly ridiculous.”
"Do you want vanilla?"
Sherlock nodded his typical “I’m-not-making-any-promises-but-I’ll-at-least-make-a-minimal-effort” nod. He let his head slump forward onto the table, and John ruffled his hair. He sighed contentedly at the touch.
“John, don’t—”
"It's not--we're...not..."
“Sorry, but…what is it?”
He sat down beside her without bothering with a greeting. Instead, he was calculating. He stared at the pitch, analysing each player of both teams, determining their chances of winning. If all went as expected, Westpark would likely overtake the visiting team in the last ten minutes of play, and Sherlock would be able to follow through with his plan.
John: 21
Sherlock looked positively murderous, and John knew that dinner was at least going to be interesting.
better.
“We go to school together,” Sherlock mumbled without looking up from the untouched food in front of him.
Sherlock’s laugh was contagious. “Lunch?” he said.
Their walk back up to the castle was silent. The setting sun cast their shadows across the lawn and drew even more attention to the difference in height between the two boys.
Short version: not dead.
“Feel different?” his father piped up.
How had Sherlock gotten so lucky?
“I’ve got a vial if you want some right now.”
When Molly and her father had departed the little greeting ceremony, the only remaining guest was Sherlock’s grandmother, who turned out to be a lot like Mycroft, one advantage of which was that she didn’t talk much, and simply greeted her son and daughter-in-law with a dainty handshake each, and her grandsons pats on the tops of their heads.
“Yes, sure, fine,” Sherlock replied, waving a hand dismissively and disappearing back into John’s room.
Sherlock shot him a look. "Why?"
"No." Sherlock's face was smushed into the cushions, muffling his voice.
One of John's teammates let out a loud and exaggerated "
“I can’t believe it. You’re actually a whole family of freaks. I can’t wait to tell everyone the sort you come from.” He was out of the house quicker than Sherlock could react.
“Of course, the whole thing with the hexed letters.”
"John, don't move."
They sat in silence for what seemed like hours, constant shuddering keeping them awake. John glanced over at Sherlock.
"Then you should've said something."
“You’re in shock, you have enough to worry about without the cold,” he replied tersely.
All the way up to Gryffindor Tower, John wondered what he was getting himself into. Why had he followed this madman out to the Forest? What was Sherlock Holmes up to? Was this what he usually did for fun?
“Oh, I’ll manage him. Good luck with Sherlock.”
"Yes, I suppose that would be nice, but I don't necessarily fancy thinking of my brother as the subject of our first post-sexual encounter conversation."
“For me, remember?” John pecked him on the cheek.
“I must have gotten yours by mistake,” he said, and before Sherlock could think of an argument against it, they had exchanged cones, and Wilkes was walking away with his plain vanilla.
Sherlock’s mother approached him. “Would you like me to show you something?” she asked.
That beautiful, stubborn, dangerous bastard. He was lucky John loved him.
love you.”
“Of course not,” Sherlock replied with a grin. “It shouldn’t be, at least. May taste foul, though,” he went on, shoving John off of him, “so I’d rather we had a wash before we continue.”
John saw the laser flicker in his peripherals. Sherlock looked at him with…what was that? Concern? Moriarty continued his monologue, but John couldn’t look away from that expression. It was half question, half—undeniably—fear. Surely Sherlock shouldn’t have been letting his hand tip that much in the presence of such a dangerous man.
. For God's sake, who wore top hats anymore? Sherlock hadn't even bothered to tame his curls for the occasion, beyond a minimal once-over with the comb. His tuxedo fit perfectly, but he was not going to do Mycroft any favors when it came to any other part of his appearance.
Sherlock scoffed, but complied, nibbling at the crust a bit before taking a large bite.
Sherlock glanced at him. “Are you alright?” he asked again, and his voice was startlingly quiet.
Both of them laughed at that, but immediately went back to sulking at the sight of Mr. Holmes's professional-grade camera. "You're not really going to take
“Ow. I’m telling your mum!”
Without another word, he shoved his arms into his coat, grabbed his bookbag, and practically ran to the bus stop, forgetting his scarf in his rush.
"Go ahead, John, get it over with!" the boy next to him urged.
"Oh, please, can we drop it?"
“I'm not really concerned about the weather. I don’t have anything to wear. Why would I bring swimming things to your house for Christmas? How was I supposed to know you’ve got a bloody swimming pool?”
Sherlock nodded. He didn't trust himself to speak.
If you really want to know what a dork I am, I actually had to make sure the songs I was thinking of fit the time John used them for a mixtape. "I Only Wanna Be With You" (Hootie and the Blowfish) and "Luna" (Smashing Pumpkins).
“Yeah, and now we…Christ. Sherlock.”
Mrs. Holmes held up a bodysuit the size of a grown man. Yellow and black stripes across the middle told John that it was supposed to look like a bumblebee. "'Violet,'" she read from the note lying next to the package, "'Since Sherlock has come to love studying bees so much, I thought I would make something that better suited his tastes than those old cat pyjamas. Perhaps this will keep him warm! Give the lads my love. Tilly.' Isn't it wonderful?"
And then immediately slammed it shut again.
Sherlock woke first, the cabin still shrouded in darkness, even though the time indicated by his dying phone was 10:34 AM. "Fantastic," he mumbled, then shifted slightly, pressing himself further back into John.
, my dear Watson,” the giddy voice said, making John’s head spin. “As soon as I saw you, I just
Sherlock sat on the floor beside him and rested against the wall himself. “What for?”
“Good.” Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice.
“Don’t mention it. He was great fun. Worth a walk up to the road.”
John sighed, taking Sherlock’s hands in his own gently and conceding a small smile. “Alright. But don’t you dare try to distract me on Sunday. I really do have to finish that essay.”
If Mason was thrown off at all by this revelation, he didn’t show. “Well, then, I guess you’ll know about the rabbit then, too.”
“You—you what?”
Sherlock hesitated. "Greg."
"Oh, getting shot at, then. What happened?"
If John had kissed him urgently before, he kissed him sweetly now, with gentle presses of lips to any part of Sherlock’s face that caught his attention. Sherlock kissed back, mirroring everything that John did, hoping to get across everything that John managed to silently convey with his lips, to show that everything he knew that John felt was reciprocated in full, and that there was no activity that he wouldn’t at least tolerate, so long as John was there, but that sex was definitely nowhere on the spectrum of simple ‘toleration,’ no matter what his actions may have implied.
“Sherlock, how often do you come down here?”
He visited one of his old mates, who was charmed by Sarah. In fact, John was ashamed to admit he’d been relieved for Sarah to have a distraction so that he could worry about Sherlock some more while they were out to lunch with him.
likes me. And I love you, as more than just my best friend. I tried to deny it for a long time. My entire life, I suppose. And then I realized I'd been denying it for too long." He paused, realizing he was going into a sappy speech. So, to lighten the mood, he smiled and muttered, "I love you, Honeybee."
“Sherlock—”
John couldn’t help but giggle a bit.
“I told you you could do it,” John murmured in his ear.
Sherlock laughed. "Works for me. Makes you a huge flirt, which I can never get enough of."
“Yeah!”
"Oh, right. Well, that's the last time I'm being honest about not having plans."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, not wanting to give too much away. In reality, that particular line had struck a chord. It was John’s fault, of course—he’d been staring as Sherlock had read it. He’d even gone so far as to grin mischievously when Sherlock paused. “What’s that even supposed to mean?”
Sherlock grinned, but dropped it immediately. "Too much?"
“We had a deal!”
“I’m getting bored, Sherlock,” Moriarty went on calmly.
"I'm glad that's done, then. Sorry about the scare, love."
“What, Mycroft?” Sherlock barked.
“A bit of a dick, though,” John continued.
Sherlock hadn’t ever felt the urge to study until John mentioned doing it together.
"Sherlock," John whined.
!” More red specks appeared and danced over both their bodies as Moriarty came into view once again. “It is a weakness with me. But, to be fair, it is my
“Because they’re all idiots,” Sherlock replied.
I'm procrastinating writing an essay so have the next chapter a little early!
“I just wanted to say, I…I thought last night was nice, too.”
Thank you for your time, and I PROMISE I'LL START BEING MORE CONSISTENT ABOUT POSTING NEW CHAPTERS.
Sherlock reluctantly smiled. "She was so startled by my voice."
“I thought maybe it was because you’re a great Seeker,” John replied, startled.
"Are you okay?"
He shot up, eyes darting around the room. "John," he hissed. "John!"
Mycroft had done it.
"Yes, please. Also"--he stood and kissed Sherlock on the cheek, cradling his arm carefully--"how was your day?"
"I still think we should go to Madam Pomfrey."
"I am?"
As it turned out, the heating didn't work too well in said room. It occurred to him to call John again and just go out anyway, but it was getting a bit late for a meal, and Sherlock wasn't really very hungry, anyway. So instead, seeing that John was online, he sent him an IM that encapsulated his passive suffering.
As it was, the urge itself was shattered with the unmistakable crack of a Beater’s club.
and I will be your Potterlock headcanon friend (or any other type of friend, if you want).
like that," he told Sherlock, who blushed.
When his new friends accidentally have some ice cream adorned with truth flake, Sherlock learns some things he might not wish to know.
“Why not?”
"Do you like him?"
Instead, it was John's turn to blush, and as Sherlock saw it spreading across his cheeks, he felt a sense of pride. He'd made John Watson smile nervously, he'd made the blood rush to his cheeks. It was the single most important achievement of his life.
"It wasn't your fault," Sherlock mumbled.
"I'm John. Watson. Third floor."
"You alright?" John asked, catching him staring with an oddly empty expression.
John: 26
“Well, they can wait forever for all I care.”
John nodded and helped Sherlock to his feet, and although his discomfort had subsided exponentially, he allowed John's support as they walked from the room simply for the physical contact it allowed them.
Silently, Sherlock dialed the number.
“I know, you didn’t mean any harm. But that doesn’t change the fact that you were out of bed after hours. Or that you broke into the astronomy tower. Honestly, I could have expected this from Mr. Holmes, but not from you. There’s a reason Professor McGonagall gave you that badge.”
Sherlock didn’t respond for a few moments. “John, I don’t know what I’m doing.”
"Oh. Well." Victor cleared his throat. "Yeah, sorry, Sherlock."
“How do you know?”
As soon as Sherlock had gone to shower, John picked the digital camera up from its perch on the mantel and flipped it on.
“I think the den will do nicely,” Sherlock whispered in reply.
"Hm, I think I like where this is going."
Sherlock threw his pen across the room, nearly landing a perfect hit to John's eye. "I can't take it anymore! If I have to write up one more bloody pointless lab I'll--I'll--"
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, Polly Winston doesn’t go to the Dark Forest. No, she’s much too stupid for that to be the case. She’d be dead already.”
Mrs. Holmes didn’t bat an eye. She simply lifted her wine glass serenely and shrugged. John could swear he thought he saw her wink at Sherlock, though, egging him on.
That was not entirely true, John thought. He had quite a bit to be afraid of, considering how much Sherlock tended to underestimate the power behind every spell he cast. He was always zapping books from their shelves and causing small explosions as opposed to accomplishing the minor tasks he set out to perform. There was no doubt of his intellect, or his control when it came to particularly advanced magic, but the simple things were always overdone to the point of danger. John didn’t think Sherlock was even aware of the way a casual flick of his wand could send chairs flying across the room.
"Of course not! I want to apologise."
“Well, I should hope not, considering you said—”
Minutes later, Greg replied:
“I’m…here,” he said as he rounded a corner and ran right into Sherlock.
John’s eyes widened.
"Or something?"
Sherlock's hysteria was catching, and John was shaking with the effort of not breaking down into sobs.
Siger was pulled from his conversation with Mrs. Watson and frowned. "Why not? They're just kids."
"I won't."
"I am tired. But just know that if I weren't you'd be fucking me by now."
“I’m glad you were,” John said. He didn’t seem to realize he’d already said it.
“Shut up!” Sherlock said. He slapped John’s arm.
them tomorrow.” Sherlock pecked him on the nose. “We’ve got just enough time for a good snog before dinner.”
“Yes. I’ve known Molly my whole life. She and her father live in the same town as my family. I couldn’t bear to let him keep talking like that, so I…I told him to shut up and piss off.”
“It was an experiment! Anyway, I was thinking of the look on his face when he saw Gingerwald being dragged along behind through the window. I hadn’t meant for the cat to get hurt, but…”
“That’s good then. Congratulations. When should I book the reception hall?”
“Thanks,” John said.
“It is news to me. Not everything is as obvious to everyone as it is to you,” John pointed out bitterly.
"You...er, you were..."
"Right." John shook his head, regaining his bearings after the fright Sherlock had given him.
Twenty minutes later, with paper plates littering the two tables set up at one end of the pool, Isabelle picked up a nearby empty Coca-Cola bottle.
“Hello, Sherlock,” Anderson said as he entered the common room.
John stared at the man lying across the couch.
“I should hope so. You spend an awful lot of time together.”
"Do I need to warn her about your tendency to forget your lunch? She'll have to help you remember if she wants to be with you."
Sherlock shrugged. They had reached his room. He unlocked the door as slowly as he could, sure that John would like to get back to whatever movie he was watching so that he could prepare for his exam. When he couldn't avoid it any longer, though, Sherlock opened the door.
"Oh, it's alright. You've always liked John, I see that now. I can't say I blame you." She cocked her head appreciatively, still gazing across at the older kids. "He
hands."
“I just—oh my god.” He suddenly slipped out from under John’s hand and pressed his back against the tile at the edge of the pool, alarm dancing around the edges of his eyes and drawing them open wider. “Oh my god,” he repeated.
The man's neck made a painful crackling sound as his head shot up. The sight of him
"Mpfh," was Sherlock's unintelligible reply.
“I know. I miss you, too.”
“When do I ever get detention, Professor?” he replied, grinning.
“It’s fine. Come here.”
Sherlock tugged at his sleeve. "And who are you supposed to be?" he asked John.
"So you can do it to me?"
Sherlock cut him off with a dramatic sigh before rolling over onto his back. "Fine," he said, expressing his disappointment rather more than was necessary. After all, John hadn’t
Sherlock: 28
John: 32
“Keeping your body under control, you mean.”
It wasn’t something that he thought about. It was just something that happened. John dropped the sweets he was holding and threw his arms around Sherlock. He attacked his mouth, tasting that morning’s butterbeer along with something he couldn’t identify but that was somehow uniquely Sherlock. He pressed the taller boy’s back to the nearest wall and relished the hands that now found their way to his hips, sliding his tongue along Sherlock’s in the best kiss they’d shared to date.
Outside his room, Sherlock had to drop John’s hand to pick the lock. Once inside, however, he didn’t hesitate to push John up against the closed door and kiss him. He kissed him as though he was making up for the lost day, begging for forgiveness for abandoning him, and John tried as best he could to convey his own irritation at the circumstances in return.
“Bet that went over well.”
“So?”
"It's good to see you, Greg."
“Actually, it’s rather more dull at home than it is here. At least there’s—never mind,” Sherlock cut himself off and glanced warily at John. John of course, knew exactly what he wanted to say, but he wouldn’t even say it in front of him, let alone all of these people.
“What do you want me to do?” Sherlock said firmly.
When they finally decided to get out and see the rest of the village, John suggested they go to Honeyduke’s. Hand in hand, they crossed the street and were met with the wonderful smells. The sugary air inside the shop seemed to cement their palms together.
“Oh, come on now, Sherlock, I didn’t mean it like that. You’re a dick in the best way possible.”
“Are you kidding? Watson couldn’t give a professor bullshit if his life depended on it,” came a voice from the nearest armchair, and they finally noticed Mary, hidden behind a large volume on the history of the Quidditch World Cup.
“Although, I am curious,” he went on, confirming Sherlock’s suspicion, “how you knew Mrs. Johnson was pregnant. She hadn’t even told the rest of us yet.”
John shook his head. He supposed he'd been lucky enough to get Sherlock to Gryffindor Tower. After his sudden breakdown and the subsequent tearful embrace, he had gone right in for the kill, swooping his head down to mouth at John's earlobe while at the same time lifting John's leg to his waist and whispering, "I love you, John. I really and truly do love you."
John bit his tongue, but made a mental note to kiss the frown right off of Sherlock’s lips when these people went on to take their seats at the table.
“What?”
"I dunno, are you going to shout at him some more?" Mycroft replied coldly.
of talk.
to the face, that doesn’t mean I should take it.”
"Sherlock!" John smiled wider when he saw him, and waved him over with his free hand.
men.”
"Honestly, John, it's not a hard conclusion to jump to. We're on a picnic together, and all of the flowery language you inflict on your blog's delirious readership is likely to send them the wrong message."
"Mind? Why the fuck would I mind? I’ve got the most brilliant, most attractive boyfriend I could possibly have, not to mention trouble always seems to find him, so I’m never bored."
“Yes I can, John! I can do whatever I want!” Sherlock shot back, practically tearing the tights away from his body. “I vowed never to dance with that Moriarty after the Richenbach fiasco. I am not going back on that promise.”
“Oh, well. At least have some fun in the meantime.”
He’d know that voice anywhere. He’d heard it in his dreams for months. Now it was spilling into his reality. It was at a pitch he’d never heard, too. Excited beyond something a good murder or a successful experiment could do.
“Oh, don’t take it personally, practically everyone is.” Sherlock continued his pacing, ignoring John’s incredulous expression. “Now, let’s try again, shall we? The difference between arsenic and arsenia?”
"Yes, Sherlock."
John simultaneously giggled and struggled to subtly adjust himself. "Stop that."
The end of the year flew by, and John was almost surprised to find that it was the the 31
“Hello, John,” Greg greeted him cautiously, sensing John’s irritated tension.
“Still can’t help but be attracted to him.”
“Aren’t you going to clean up?” his mother reprimanded.
"Where?"
“Beautiful, aren’t they?” Sherlock said, disregarding John’s question.
The pot was boiling over, and he shot across the kitchen to turn off the burner. "Sherlock, get away from--"
"Don't you think it might have been a good idea to check the weather before you decided to waltz off to a dodgy ski resort for a case?"
Sherlock kissed him quickly before answering, “Yourself.”
“It’s you,” Sherlock said excitedly.
“John, we’re nearly there.”
"You've brought it here for a bit of practical learning." Sherlock paused, waiting for confirmation of his theory. "Go on," he urged after a moment. A few students snickered.
get to be a pirate?"
"Go to sleep, Sherlock," Mycroft muttered from the doorway, startling them.
"Now, follow my lead. Put your right foot back as my left comes forward. Then step back to the other corner of the box with your left foot and bring them together. All in the count of three. Ready?"
The boy looked up from his newest advanced potions book. His eyes fixed on the pink flesh of John’s arm before moving to his face. “Yes?”
Harry grinned mischievously at him across the table when he firmly denied everything she insinuated about what had happened on the astronomy tower.
"How are you finding things at uni?"
"What about right now?"
"Bloody hell, how long has it been going on, do you think?"
Sherlock hesitated. "You know, she'll move out soon. She's going to be eighteen in a few weeks. Maybe she won't get drunk as much when she doesn't have to go home to your father." Sherlock didn't want to mention why Harry and her father didn't get along--it hit too close to home, and he didn't like to think about it.
John ignored them. "What is it, Sherlock?"
"John," he moaned, flinching as he attempted to open his eyes and found the light much too bright.
“Yeah. It was my tenth birthday, and some of the family were over for dinner. We didn’t know Traichan had been a Death Eater. He hid it well for
John gave him a look and lifted his copy of the novel. “‘The curves of your lips rewrite history’?”
John was looking at his feet, but he wasn't ashamed.
"So what's the plan?" John asked.
“Right. Sorry.”
"Well, we can't all be as knowledgeable about the ins and outs of formalwear as you are."
gotten detention together. Best night of sleep in my life.”
John stared at him. “How on
"Sherlock, it's alright," John tried.
They didn't speak again until nearly two months after the fire alarm incident. When the lift doors opened that day, Sherlock was both delighted and mortified to see his silent acquaintance, who smiled and nodded just as he always did when Sherlock joined him.
Sherlock Holmes sighed. “I suppose I could take you up on it.” He stood and held out his hand. John shook it hesitantly. “Meet me in the dungeons tonight after dinner.” And with that, he was gone, leaving John to stare after him quizzically.
“It’s good to be home.”
John glanced at Mycroft. His cold mask of indifference was back, although John imagined it was much chillier than normal.
“Yeah, but Lord Henry doesn’t know that.”
By the time the Sorting ended and food began to appear on the plates, Holmes looked as though he might commit a murder just so he didn’t have to sit and watch people eat. Because that’s all he was doing—he himself wasn’t eating. He wasn’t talking. He simply sat there, complete and utter boredom making him slouch as his eyes zipped from face to face.
“Christ, Sherlock. That’s one hell of a birthday.” John turned halfway around and pressed a comforting kiss to Sherlock’s lips, then snuggled back into him again.
As always, kudos make me smirk and blush like Sherlock when John says 'Brilliant,' and comments make me feel like murder-Christmas is early.
John threw the outfit to the floor at his feet. “You will put this on, or I’ll put it on you myself.”
"He's easily amused," Sherlock scoffed, sore that he wasn't the center of John's attention. When he did spot Sherlock looking over, however, he smiled and waved.
(See the end of the chapter for
"John," Sherlock said, smashing their mouths together again and groaning.
“I gave you my number. I thought you might call,” the singsong voice taunted. Moriarty stepped from concealment. “Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket…or are you just pleased to see me?”
“What?”
"Aren't I a little young for that?"
"Are you still living at 221B?"
"That...was amazing," John said after a moment.
"Are you here?"
John raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”
Sherlock's only reply was to bury his face further into John's pillow.
"I want to. I want to make you feel better."
"It's been a week!"
“Alright! Fine! I promise.”
John didn't reply, just raised an eyebrow and, anticipating the difficulty of tying a strong knot with his sprained wrist, scooted up Sherlock's body so that he was straddling his chest, and used his teeth to tighten the tie around his wrists. As he was leaned over, Sherlock cheekily nipped at the bits of his abdomen that were exposed when his shirt rode up.
Sherlock broke away abruptly and ran to his bed, sitting cross-legged, facing John and looking rather more nervous than he ought to have been, making John smile. “There’s a guest suite if you want it. Mycroft’s probably already had your things taken up there, but…if you want to, you could…” He trailed off, twisting his fingers together in his lap before gesturing vaguely at the space around him.
“Oh. You’re…oh.” A little spark of realization lit behind Lestrade’s eyes.
“A what?”
“I don’t—I don’t know, I…” John stammered.
John glanced over to Sherlock again and found the corner of his lips perked up in a grateful smirk.
“Would you like some help?” Mycroft smirked and leaned against a post to his left.
Sherlock turned his head on the pillow and smirked at him. "John Watson, are you just
“No.”
Sherlock turned back to Jim and raised his gun confidently. “Then probably my answer’s crossed yours.”
“You’re the one training me,” Sherlock pointed out, and that stopped him taunting.
"John, call Lestrade," he finished, and John immediately complied. He turned away to make the call.
"Right."
I am so sorry for my unanticipated hiatus. With everything that has been going on in my life for the past couple of months, I've had a hard time being productive in ways I'd like to. Everything's fine, though, and now I'm back to a chapter every other week. Also, I've got a chapter count now! After all, we're over halfway through, so I wanted to give you guys an idea of how much more to expect.
It didn’t take long for Sherlock to find a way in, but the entrance he found was by no means easily accessible to anyone shorter than Sherlock himself. John was pondering the likelihood of actually securing a firm grip on the sill that Sherlock had effortlessly hoisted his lanky form over when a pair of hands reached down and grasped his wrists. With Sherlock’s help, he climbed the wall and ducked through the window.
Rounding on Mycroft, he demanded, “How do I turn back time?”
John glared at him.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “What, the Cadburys were warlocks?”
"You can't get married when you're fourteen, either," John protested.
"Hmm...Forgetfulness Potion."
“What am I going to do when I don’t get to wake up to your face right there anymore?” John asked as they broke away from a drawn-out, luscious kiss.
John stepped forward and cautiously kissed Sherlock’s temple before walking to the door. “See you then.”
"Right," Sherlock muttered, barely managing to shake the proffered hand while holding the towel in a subtle yet deliberate way. "Sherlock Holmes."
"Alright. But you're going tomorrow. No excuses. You promised your mum you'd go to uni, how are you going to ever get there if you're not going to class?"
"Thanks for doing this," he said, leading them through the house to the kitchen, where Julia sat at the table with the twins in their high-chairs.
“Yes, I was flirting. And I was tickling John and this happened.”
Sherlock's thoughts screeched to a full stop. He narrowed his eyes. "Go with you?"
John poured the rest of the bottle into a tumbler and swirled it around. There was nothing he could do to keep himself from doing this every night.
John laughed and took a sip from the mug in front of him. They had been in The Three Broomsticks for hours now, sitting and talking. Sherlock took a swig of his own butterbeer, coming away with foam across his lip. John had the urge to lick it off, but opted instead for pointing at him playfully.
, Sherlock?"
“Yeah?” John replied sleepily.
John laughed and punched him playfully in the shoulder. "Shut up."
"You know, so did I," John agreed, surprising himself.
Sherlock: 3
“The solution is quite simple, really,” his father put in.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I…I’m sorry, professor, I was just…"
"Sherlock, he's kidding."
“No you don’t.”
"Shut up."
"We should probably get to bed," Sherlock suggested.
“Well, yes, of course I’m Sherlock. Who did you think I was?”
“Er, Sherlock, I’d rather we just used soap and water.”
"It’s a long story, and rather one I’d like to recount to you in private." He glanced pointedly at Anderson.
“Why? We’re wizards.”
“That’s Wilson. He works for the Ministry. Department of Mysteries,” Sherlock murmured after the man had left. “Seven years my senior, but he was still a much better childhood companion than Mycroft.”
to spy on his girlfriend?”
“No, you misunderstand, Lestrade. We’re leaving. We’re going to go get shock blankets from our own home, not wait for someone to come along and force them on us, and we are going to leave the sorting out to you, and we will talk in the morning. Good night.” The call had been ended by the time Sherlock handed John his phone. He turned on his heel. “Come, John,” he commanded, dragging him along by the hand.
"No, it was a freak accident involving a stray tree branch and a slippery patch of ice. Of
“House elves.”
“Why not? You had her. Did you see the look on her face? In twenty-two years, I’ve never seen her make that face.”
“That’s right, Johnny Boy. Mummy and Daddy are speaking,” Moriarty broke in.
“Really?”
"Good luck," he said to John.
His adversary looked down at him, an evil grin twisting his face as he raised his own weapon.
“You were always able to ignore all of those Ravenclaws. Why are you getting so worked up about something someone as fundamentally stupid as Wilkes says?”
"Isn't the water supposed to stay
“Then Kreacher shall fetch it right away, sir!” the elf rasped, and he scurried away with a quick salute.
to, I just...bloody hell.” He sighed when his ink bottle spilled over the two lines he’d managed to write.
John didn't get to answer. They heard Mrs. Hudson bustling through to the hall, and Sherlock shot to his feet, but not without giving the front of John's trousers a quick, covert stroke. John kicked him.
"Of course I do. But...why did we come here?"
. He loved John. He knew he did. But until that exact moment, he'd never understood the extent of that love. He hadn't even really understood what love was, he realized. Love wasn't lying in bed with someone kind and funny and attractive, or gently stroking his cheek as you kissed him, or taking having him spend Christmas at your house with your family. Love wasn't any of those nice, happy feelings they'd shared, at least not by themselves. Love was, first and foremost, fear.
"It doesn't matter if it's as bad as they say it will be, Sherlock!" John sputtered. "There's already ten feet of snow out there. If there's a blizzard at all, let alone the one they're predicting, we're going to be stuck in this cabin for days. Maybe even
John:14
"And yet you did. Straighten your tie, we're going to be late."
"Alright, fine, I was," Sherlock sighed, irritated at having been caught out.
He found himself being dragged into an alley and pressed against a wall just as they were rounding a corner.
Sherlock feigned disinterest as well. "I dunno, I think finding a good place to sit will do."
"Of course. I am rather fond of Lestrade's children. They're very bright. I don't know where they get it from."
"I'm wearing it."
John, meanwhile, with OWL exams on the horizon, was under more stress than ever. Much to Sherlock’s frustration, the stress wasn’t for the sake of Potions. In fact, John “hadn’t ever done so well in Potions,” he told Sherlock nearly every day. He would peck him on the cheek and thank him each time, and Sherlock had to resist dragging him into the nearest classroom and jumping him, regardless of whether it was empty or not.
John's brow furrowed comically. He smiled. "You're staring at me."
"Okay." Sherlock was far too comfortable to argue with this new teddy bear. He was much warmer than the other one, anyway.
“Nothing,” she said, shaking her head.
“Yes.”
But how could he resist, the next week, when he met a cat named Toby?
Sherlock never failed to amaze John in his deductive power, even after all these years. There was nothing surprising about it anymore, but it was still thrilling, watching him reduce the suspect before them to an angry mass of bad intentions.
"It's not like we're gonna go too far. Greg's parents are just in the lobby. Come on, it'll be fun."
Still, he weighed the risks involved with arguing further against the alternative of letting Sherlock magically wipe the mess away and decided that at worst a trip to the hospital wing might give him fair opportunity to shoot a rare “told-you-so” glare at Sherlock Holmes.
“Well,” John said, finally, “I could, you know...”
“So ‘Polly Winston’ is a lot cleverer than she’s letting on.”
“Just turn him back. Brick to prick, go on.”
had moved—and all he could do was stare at the fingers with chunks of flesh missing and fight to remind himself, "No, it isn't real, that's not your John, it's just a thing that's using his face to manipulate you, John is safe in the greenhouses with Professor Longbottom and the other Gryffindors," but then the thought occurred to him.
It wasn't long before John began to feel guilty. He had barely passed through the double doors into the building when he had the sudden urge to turn back and apologise. But what could he say? "I'm sorry I yelled at you for kissing me, but you had to learn somehow"?
cute."
"Another round?" Sherlock sounded intrigued.
“He’s been helping me with potions,” John replied, a bit more defensively than was probably necessary.
“Try it.”
“Celebrate?”
Sherlock almost laughed.
"Who assaulted you?"
"Okay, we can drop it. I'm sorry."
"Relax, you'll be fine." This whole time, Sherlock had been steering John toward the tent he'd indicated. "You can gather any information from the other nights--any indication of a motive, an opportunity. In the meantime, I will be able to investigate the dressing room."
Sherlock did as he was told, dazed by his father’s quick thinking. It wasn’t two minutes, and his father came up the corridor that ended in the front lobby of the school. Mrs. Holmes was right on his heels.
“You were going to ask me to accompany you to the village.”
“So we’re going to go…watch Muggles?”
"I was thinking about it. There's something wrong."
“I’m sorry, Professor, I just—”
John looked around frantically. He caught Harry’s eye and found a horrified expression. “I didn’t think he’d actually
Neville sighed. “You know I’m going to have to give you detention, yeah?”
, and Sherlock couldn’t have cared less about getting bad marks on just a few assignments, but he hadn’t realized how much his exam grade would depend on his knowing the book until the teacher had mentioned its relevance.
“How’s his foot?”
“You’ve got a little…”
John: 28
"Please, she thinks you're brilliant. A little mad at times, and a bit of an arse, but brilliant. Of course," John continued, managing to lift his head gently against the hand at his nape, "she doesn't think nearly as highly of you as you deserve."
John and Mrs. Hudson looked at each other in confusion. The look they shared only deepened when Sherlock unexpectedly came back into the room, marched over to John’s chair to lift him into an awkward embrace, and then marched back out.
"Certainly. But first, let's just...dance for a while."
“My tenth birthday.”
"Sherlock...can I have a hug?"
They had already been to Honeydukes for some Chocolate Frogs. Now they were sat in the corner of The Three Broomsticks, Sherlock prodding at a chocolate frog leg to see how it would respond.
"John, I don't--I can't--oh, God," Sherlock moaned. He shuddered, and John wondered for a split second whether he was coming. Instead, his hand went to John's hip and his movements were more frantic, his breaths shorter even than before.
"Most things are the same as they've always been, but there are advantages to getting older."
The bottle was nearly empty when his fingers found the doorknob. Downing the last gulp, John turned the knob and entered, stumbling a bit and dropping the empty bottle to the floor, where it shattered. “Shit,” he muttered. He glanced at the bed. Sherlock never stirred.
"I think we should get out of here."
Just as Sherlock wondered whether he was supposed to follow him, John reappeared with a cassette tape in hand. When he started up the stereo, Sherlock recognized the tape he'd made years ago for the anniversary of their first date--the real one, not the one they'd had as kids--and stared at him, puzzled.
ignoring him for any period of time, however short it may be.
you mean, you 'think so'?"
John barely resisted punching him. “Wilkes, why don’t you just piss off? I’m through trying to apologize to you and your whole bloody House.”
It wasn't that he didn't want to be here. He was excited--truly overjoyed--to be marrying John. The problem came in the form of about fifty people looking at him expectantly. He wondered what it was about crowds that sapped all recollection of memorized words as he silently panicked over his vows.
"Well, I think it's a bit late for that. You're the one who made the conversation about him."
When he finally looked up, John was beaming at him, but frowned after a second. "You okay?" he mouthed covertly, and Sherlock nodded shakily.
There was a knock at the door, and a muffled call from Harry in the stairwell.
“No, not really.”
Sherlock stopped fidgeting. "You really think so?"
After a few long hours in the Hospital Wing, John was free to go, sporting fresh new skin on his right arm and breathing better than he ever remembered breathing.
...And then I had finals. And then I graduated.
John’s head shot up in alarm, and he asked, “Is it?”
“No, not really.”
“But you like it.”
As unexpected as it was, relief flooded him when he felt familiar lips on his own, one hand on his shoulder and another softly cupping his cheek.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "And
it was the suspect!"
“I’m ready to annihilate, if that’s what you mean,” he replied.
Sherlock smirked. John understood the familiar gleam he’d seen before.
Just as they'd come back around the corner, Sherlock and John froze at the same panicked, barking voice that had followed them out of the park and through the city. Slowly, they turned to face the suspect who'd chased them.
“A Holmes tangent? Is that what you call it?”
John searched for something else to say. “Why don’t you work on the case, then?”
John looked at him suspiciously. “Sherlock, we were meant to leave ten minutes ago…or so your mother says….What are you doing?”
. He was tempted to wear his gloves
Both of them reached for their gifts at the same time, then hesitated.
“It was the perfect opportunity.”
"Er, Angelo." Mr. Holmes covertly pulled the owner aside when they arrived. "Would it be possible to set up the boys a little table of their own? Just for two. Sherlock's decided he has to take John on a date before he can marry him," he said with a wink.
John set off at a run after his new companion, a rush of adrenaline beginning to fill his veins.
When he came back down, bodysuit zipped all the way up to his chin, he shot a disgusted look in the direction of John's ecstatic one.
I don't think I've ever expressed how important comments are to me. I cherish them like I cherish my laptop and my apple juice.
John raised an annoyed eyebrow. "You'll do what?"
"Yes."
“Sherlock, what’s going on?”
“Absolutely. I mean, sure.”
“You’re gonna be okay, Sherlock,” John said.
School would have been uneventful the next day. It would have been unbearably dull if it weren’t for Sherlock’s new ability.
Some people would have assumed Sherlock was distant and even a bit cold. Those people didn't get to see him as he was now, with his head in John's lap and his legs curled up to his chest. It was the third Saturday of the month, which meant a movie night.
“Absolutely,” John replied, a similar sigh escaping him.
"Skiving off. He's got an exam he's not prepared for. Didn't want to look like an idiot."
Sherlock stopped momentarily to stare at him, before continuing walking and talking at the same time. “We’re going into the village together. That’s what I observe so-called ‘couples’ doing every time they have the chance. Sure, friends walk to Hogsmeade together, but you specifically asked me to. That implies a date. That, and the fact that you didn’t object to me kissing you earlier this morning.”
Sherlock did lie his head back onto the cushions, which resulted in being nudged by John’s knee. He reached over and poked John’s foot, in a moment of reckless abandon. He was encouraged when nothing happened. It was when John rubbed his head like a dog that all hell broke loose.
“Ten?”
“You told me to, though, didn’t you?” Sherlock countered.
“It is hard not to be attracted to you.”
“I dunno, at least half of them,” Wilson replied, and their renewed laughter was contagious enough to force Sherlock to join them.
He was oddly okay with that.
"And what message would that be?"
“No, there’s something. What is it?”
They'd awoken that morning without a case, and therefore plenty of leisure time, much to Sherlock's dismay.
, John thought.
"I dunno, John looks like he's having fun."
"John, if you think I care about the rules, by all means keep talking, but I assure you, I’d rather you just save the trouble of trying to convince me and get some sleep."
"And your shirt. Your trousers. All of it. And lie down."
The next day couldn’t come quickly enough, John decided. He could barely sleep, and Moran snoring in the next bed wasn’t helping, as it just reminded him of that kiss in the hospital wing two weeks ago. They hadn’t kissed since. John had felt quite daring with that simple peck on the side of Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock sighed and walked away. He sat down on the edge of his bed. “You don’t want to have sex with me right now.”
Through all of this, Sherlock's eyes had remained shut. He finally opened them, frowned. "I don't count?"
"I wasn't frightened, you were the one who had to stop to go into 'doctor mode.'"
Sherlock shuddered. "Are you?"
"She thought you were a girl? And she
"We can't get married, we're too young!"
Sherlock cocked a skeptical eyebrow. "Nobody?"
John gave him the finger without even pausing in his assault on Sherlock's mouth.
“Sherlock! I’m so glad to see you came!” He seemed pleasantly surprised, and if it weren’t for the fact that John was straight, not to mention that they had only known each other for a week, Sherlock would have thought John was greeting his significant other. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking.
"A waltz," Sherlock mused as they stepped out onto the floor and both turned to face each other. "D'you know how to waltz?" He put his free hand on John's waist.
"To make sure it doesn't stick. The big spoon is right next to it."
Silence fell again, and again it was John to break it. “But the cases—how did they start?”
He groaned himself awake and rubbed his eyes. “How long have I been asleep?”
"No," John lied, willing Sherlock not to mention the harness pressed against his arse.
“So what if I am? I can’t take your hand and just be a friend?” John slurred.
He didn’t speak. If anything, he was most worried that a word from him would take them all up, and if there was one thing he knew at the moment, it was that Sherlock Holmes needed to get out of here alive.
"Hm," was Sherlock's only response.
"Yes," Sherlock replied. "Could be warmer."
"I'm sorry, it's just too funny."
Sherlock smiled and laid his head on John’s shoulder. “I love you, too, John.”
He grinned, shook his head. “Of course not. Come here,” he said, using both hands to pull Sherlock’s head down and kiss him deeply once more, just as Sherlock shifted his hips. They both gasped against each other as they aligned at the movement, and Sherlock’s hips stuttered another seemingly involuntary thrust.
Sherlock held out a hand in John’s direction. John took it and pulled himself to his feet, staggering slightly and steadying himself by grasping Sherlock’s shoulder. “We should phone Lestrade.”
"For god's sake, John." Sherlock slapped John's hands aside where they were attempting to adjust the poorly-done bowtie and untied it completely, bending his knees to match John's eye level as he began to fix it. "Of course it isn't tied correctly, Lestrade taught you the wrong way to do it."
"Sherlock," John giggled. "Can't we make it to the closet?"
“I’m checking in on you. You haven’t been answering my owls.”
He was genuinely irate, in strange contrast to all of the playfulness he’d put on display. John and Sherlock glanced at each other as the mysterious conversation continued. The continuous changes in atmosphere were jarring. John wasn’t sure he could handle the turbulence much longer after the events of the past hour.
"Well, I was then. And you want to know why?" Sherlock stood and began pacing the room. "Because when you're a kid and you're curious, you do stupid things. You think, 'oh, it won't hurt to try this out, it's just an experiment,' but then you end up hurting someone you care about because what you did was completely

Sherlock stared at her, offended. "I do not."
“I should go,” Mrs. Hudson said, handing John a steaming mug. “Enjoy your tea, dear. And don’t make him wait too long, you know how he gets.”
Mycroft laughed even harder. “No, I think that’s quite enough,” he said, wiping away tears.
"Who wants to play?"
“I suppose that’s acceptable.”
Sherlock made to turn over again, but one glance at the look on his face, and John knew better than to let him. He pressed a hand to his chest and forced him back down. "No, Sherlock, not now. If you try anything again, I
“Right.” Wilkes glared at Sherlock. “Well, perhaps next time.”
“Wait, you’re taking me home?”
There wasn’t a lot that he
As the Christmas holidays drew nearer, John did everything he could to distract himself from that fact. He focused on keeping up with his schoolwork and practiced brewing potions, and when that didn’t work, put in a request with McGonagall and the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to reinstate the Dueling Club that had disbanded a few years before.
Sherlock slapped a hat onto his head and nodded, offering a fake salute. "Yes, sir," he said, and grinned.
This chapter is late because they scheduled me to work a fuckton the week of Christmas. I am not happy about it. But today you get two chapters for your trouble.
4. Have a lovely two weeks, darlings! I will be spending it grueling under stage lights and possibly doing drunken improv.
John shook his head. "Two. The astronomy tower. That first time."
," he whispered urgently, unsure what to do. "John!" he said aloud.
“I’m—” John was cut off when a wave broke over his face. As soon as it cleared, he coughed violently. “I’m stuck.”
"And you’re the one who wanted it to be an
"Did you like it, though?"
“You’re Seeker for a reason, right? Why don’t you just do your job?”
"Yet."
"I can't believe you bloody burned your
“Bingo.”
Sherlock stared at his feet, distorted small waves. "Do I?"
Sherlock thought perhaps they were looking at different costumes. The fabric was hardly quality, and the tights were a gaudy green colour that made Sherlock suspect they'd been stolen from the costume stores after the theatre company's production of
"I'm sorry."
"Right now, I'm not sure if you'd feel anything."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock smirked. “Oh, I’m certain of that.” He seemed to consider something for a moment, as though it had only just occurred to him. “No one’s ever said my name that way before.”
"What question?"
As soon as the door closed, John turned back to Sherlock. "I'd always thought Moran was off doing Moriarty's dirty work."
," Sherlock groaned dismally, reminiscent of a child being told that his holiday had been pushed back a week.
He rolled his eyes and stormed off, up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, focusing as hard as he could on the happiest he could ever remember feeling. “
"Yes."
“I know,” Sherlock replied almost immediately, impatiently.
“But?”
“No it’s not.”
“Oh, for god’s sake, Sherlock,” Lestrade groaned, putting a hand to his forehead. “I don’t have time for this.”
John looked at the screen of Sherlock's computer monitor--curse the bloody thing, taking up space in a
Sherlock snorted. "I'm not your Honeybee anymore, if I recall," he snapped halfheartedly.
Sherlock helped John out of his shirt and jeans, relieved for his own sake that his vest stayed on, and John returned the favor, muttering an amused, “I knew it,” when he saw Sherlock’s pants. Sherlock snickered.
Every Sunday, the Watson and Holmes families gathered their children and took them to the park. The playground there had everything, from swings and monkey bars for the older kids to spring-loaded riding toys and slides for the younger boys.
"Then there’s no point. That Moriarty bloke knows what I mean to you, and that’s information you’re never going to be able to get back out of his head. So if we were to stop kissing and working on Potions and going on dates, would it even matter? He’d still use me, you’d just be further away and it would be harder to know when something’s wrong. So do us both a favor and shut up, please."
"Yes, yes, but I need
“Why does that not surprise me,” John said, rolling his eyes and grinning at Sherlock, who was clearly trying as hard as he could not to give away the smile that was beginning to crack the corners of his stoic, disapproving lips.
He could practically hear the eye-roll.
a drama queen. You're not middle-aged. You're thirty-two. You're younger than my mother was when I was born."
"Why not?"
He sprinted up the stairs, dodged the door on the landing, and stopped dead at the sight of the square of paper in the middle of the table, twitching in the wind from the open window, but ultimately weighed down by the words on the page.
“It’s so mundane.”
"I could call in sick."
"No!"
“What? No I don’t.”
When the plane landed, John instinctively checked his phone for news of potential disasters from Sherlock. He found a single text in his inbox.
"Then I'll tell them to turn their backs. Look, everyone expects you to be emotional--"
“Yeah. Yeah, I heard you.”
"Yeah, it's John. Listen, do you know where your brother is?"
John shook his head. "I just can't believe you didn't notice the knife he had concealed inside his jacket," John teased, and Sherlock finally smiled, though hesitantly.
“Has he noticed the painting yet?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“Huh? Oh, that,” Jim murmured casually, stepping past John to take it. Another plan began to form in John’s mind, a bloody mad plan, but it couldn’t fail to get Sherlock out of there alive, John thought. “The missile plans,” Moriarty continued. He turned it over in his fingers and kissed it. “Boring!” he sang out suddenly. Another blink and the memory stick was in the water. John saw his only opportunity slipping away.
“Neither.”
"John, it's beautiful!" Molly exclaimed, her wide eyes reflecting the eerie colours of the tiny flames surrounding them.
Sherlock scoffed, as though he didn't think John was trying at all.
"Perhaps," Sherlock replied, now kissing his neck.
John wanted to erase that smirk from his lips in the most effective way he knew how, but thought better of just attacking his boyfriend’s mouth in front of said boyfriend’s parents. Even if they were fully aware that he was likely to later.
“He’s the kid who blew up Filch’s cat last year.”
John rolled his eyes. "'Tedious,'" he mimicked.
Sherlock scoffed as though it were completely obvious. “Be safe,” he said, sarcasm dripping from the corners of his smile.
There were steps to this dance, and admittedly it was always less of a "dance" to begin with. Sleep-mussed hair and bleary eyes, Sherlock glaring at John for waking him up, John trudging to the kettle and drowsily flipping it on before he'd filled it with water--they were ungraceful and uncoordinated in their sleepiness.
It was getting rather late, with many patrons either leaving or too drunk to even hold a microphone, so it was only about ten minutes before they took the stage. Greg and the rest of their party whooped and whistled as they made it to their places.
“The thrill, John. I love the thrill of using my mind to its full potential, and the only way to get anywhere near that maximum in this castle is to solve a puzzle.”
Sherlock blushed.
"Then how come--you said those things?" Sherlock struggled through hiccups.
Sherlock groaned as he flopped onto the sofa.
Once again, Sherlock failed to answer, but instead held out what he'd concealed from John for the whole walk over. "Here. Put these on."
"How do you know?"
Sherlock pointed down at his own foot, and John saw small splashes of blood on the floor.
"John, I like your new sleeping bag." It was true. He'd been admiring the glow-in-the-dark stars that covered it while John had been in the bathroom, cupping his hands around his eyes and pressing his face against it in order to see.
John just smirked, knowing Sherlock wouldn't be able to turn down the challenge. "First to stutter in the middle of his secret has to take one request from the winner."
After a moment, the scratching of John’s quill ceased once more and he said, “Hang on. This isn’t some ridiculous ‘Third Date’ plan, is it?”
“What? Sherlock, yes I do.”
“John, it’s just a match—”
"Or you could go with me to take notes," John conceded. He smirked. "You just want to spend the day with me tomorrow, don't you?"
"Thanks, I guess."
"There's got to be a story there."
"Not to those of us who have to look at you. That green is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. And I dissect things for fun."
a child.”
“Yes, they’re gone,” Mrs. Holmes said, sounding as relieved as he felt. “Hopefully they won’t be back next year, either. Well done, John.” She looked genuinely proud, to John’s sudden amusement.
“Yeah, he always was a little freak.”
"Sherlock, is this your twisted way of finding out the intimate details of my childhood?"
Sherlock almost stopped listening. It wasn't as though the words weren't meaningful, but it was just that--they were words. What he really cared for, he realized, was the way John was saying them, with absolute joy and tenderness, and a bit of an endearingly mocking tone at the particularly stupid bits. By the time he'd finished and it was Sherlock's turn, it no longer bothered him whether or not he said the words right, so long as he sounded as utterly in love with John as he was--which was certainly not a difficult thing to do.
John, still in wonder at the fact that him being out of the country could be something that Sherlock would overlook, didn’t know how to respond. As it turned out, he didn’t have to.
He squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself back to sleep.
He turned slowly, expecting to be met by nothing more than the front door.
“You’re not a ‘Holmes boy’ yet. Not until you’ve endured Christmas dinner with our extended family.”
John grinned. "Why are you always right?"
John took it. "Whatever you say, Honeybee."
“Excuse me?”
Even with John's giddiness, though, Sherlock was ready to leave long before midnight. It was too crowded with men in tails and bow ties and
John’s eyebrows furrowed. His eyes narrowed for a moment. Then he burst out laughing.
“Right. Well. Alright. Wow.”
“Oh, hell, what does it matter?" he groaned. "Why are you so obsessed with this Quidditch nonsense?"
"What?" he sighed.
"That's hardly a good excuse."
"Having fun tonight?" John smiled.
“That was
John paused. "Are you high right now?"
"Obviously." Sherlock tried to resist rolling his eyes. He really did.
"What are you going to do about it?"
John shook his head. "I'm going to kill him."
With the two of them together, it was more obvious what Aunt Tilly had been going for.
“What, the shirt has to go, too?”
"Sh'lock," John slurred.
“Don’t call me stupid, idiot!”
It wasn’t until John pressed a sloppy but gentle kiss to the back of his neck that Sherlock’s hand tightened around John’s. “You’re intoxicated.”
“Like”—John turned over in Sherlock’s arms so that they were nose-to-nose—“the fact that I’m alone under the stars with the most gorgeous student Hogwarts has ever seen.”
John stared at the words, heard their mocking tone in his head, and replied quickly.
“Hey,” John responded, suddenly self-conscious.
I was asked to put the boys' ages at the beginning of each chapter, which is a fantastic idea.
John smiled as he pulled off his jumper and started unbuttoning his shirt, headed toward the sound of the running tap. He'd barely made it out of his pants before Sherlock's hand stuck out and pulled him under the spray with such force that he almost didn't have the presence of mind to step over the shower's ledge.
"You're the one who wanted to stay in and study," Sherlock said.
“I know. Hopefully you can figure out what that’s for.”
“But it’s your birthday!” Sherlock stood up in outrage. “You’re supposed to feel special on your birthday, you shouldn’t be opening your birthday presents on a day that everyone gets some.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but didn't look up. "Would you rather I had continued to 'sulk around the flat like a three-year-old'? Your words, if I recall."
