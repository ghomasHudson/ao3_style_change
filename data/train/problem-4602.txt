Dean sat between Castiel and Sam, who had finally parked the Impala near the four horses who were nickering at each other in welcome. Castiel in turn was seated beside Gabriel and Raphael who took the last seat at the end, so as he was farthest from Lucifer’s vessel.
That causes Sam to stop, muttering under his breath before he drops Dean’s request onto the table. Castiel sympathizes with Sam’s exasperation. Both with the name-calling and the healthy food choices. Truthfully, it’s a battle that they lost a long time ago. “Egg-oil-juice doesn’t even…”
Dean gave another kiss to his burning cheek before he clambered from the bed, shamelessly naked as he stretched. A quick glance showed that the embarrassed blush on Castiel was giving way to dark-eyed lust as he focused intently on Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
She hummed in assent and took a seat beside him. Castiel shifted uneasily, because he had been looking forward to spending time alone, and this bench was a personal favorite, partly because he'd spent time here with the Righteous Man, but more so because it reminded him of his favorite heaven. "I'm unsure how I can help an agent of death. I am… currently without my grace."
Since Dean did not walk the Twisted Kingdom, all that Castiel could do is care for him and wait for his return.
Castiel pressed a fist to his chest, the only way that he could convey a connection to his grace. There was a slight flicker of recognition in Dean that was gone in a moment. "She's home."
? And why was it that he still managed to put foot squarely in mouth even in Heaven?
"Alrighty," Dean said, looking up at the trunk of the Tree, which looked like it was accessible from some steps.
He’d had a string of dark-haired, blue-eyed lovers, but it was worse than that. There had been a girl in Belo he’d dated during his shore leaves because she loved honey and had an amateur beehive in her backyard. He’d gone on with one of the Ark’s engineers, Aaron Bass. Aaron’s dainty wrist and fingers reminded Dean of Cas’ grip when he was straining for release. That turned out to be a spectacularly bad idea, especially since he couldn’t drive away when Aaron asked, “Who’s Cas?” the next day.
talking about the elephant in the room. Even the griffin seems to sense whatever uneasiness has descended on the house. The beast has started to sleep
Castiel looked at what he'd written down, Gabriel had provided the power, the Enochian around the tree would serve as the base of the spell, but Castiel would be the one to invoke it and try to weave it into a semblance of being. He was the one who had chosen the words. He was the one who was going to control the flows.
His mother, who was a warrior before she settled down in the village and ordained by the Order of the Hunters, worried for her son's obsession, but they both noticed that the monster in the woods only took young children and only during the cycle of twenty years. His father, a Man of Letters through his father's side, armed him with all the knowledge he could give. Dean had vowed that he would end the centuries-old beast that was preying on Chesterford's youth, and his parents knew that he was stubborn enough to succeed.
"Yeah, I know I have you. It's just that you're kinda non-verbal," Dean says, pulling up his hand to straighten the feathers the griffin has preened. It gives a contented sigh before it curls down with a half purr, half twitter and fluffs up its wings, a cloud of dust blowing away from it.
So, have you guys realized how awful it would have been if I stopped at chapter 13? XD I swear I would have extended chapter 14 into an entire arc, but the beginning of chapter 14 was written at the start of August. For all of you guys who are also in the Big Bang, you know that August 1 was 15 days before the draft due date, so I couldn't POSSIBLY churn out another 3 chapters for the ending of this one. I would have liked an entire chapter of dean and cas bonding, an entire chapter on them infiltrating Aravoth, another chapter for the final confrontation and finally another chapter for the mini-epilogue, but I actually churn out 5,000 words in a month, so, sorry! I hope this was all right tho.
“I—you…”
Sighing, Dean set out to create a pyre and burn the prayers. He was already staying the night. Might as well complete Michael's chores.
Dean chuckled and snagged the canvas vest he used for work to put over his worn, secondhand cotton shirt.
By the time they rolled to a stop on the shoulder, Sam, who’d been snoring lightly pressed against his window, had jerked awake. He took off his goggles to rub his eyes for a few seconds while Dean climbed out.
With those words, the lines collapsed, Lucifer and Michael disappearing under the lights that had flared up when they started fighting.
"I don't think I can trick Lucifer into getting all those ingredients for me," Dean muttered dejectedly. Dean had put an angel's tainted grace in the back of his mind until he locted the other ingredients. However, deep down Dean had known that Lucifer's grace had to be the one they needed to power the counter-spell. Lucifer was the only being that fit the criteria. There could be other angels, there could be other demons, but purifying the grace of a tainted angel screamed Lucifer. "And no one else is up this side of the watchtower."
After savoring dinner, Dean excused himself from the table. “I’m gonna go outside for a bit before I hit the hay. Thanks for the help, Bobby.” He headed out the front door before Bobby could get a word in edgewise.
It naturally begged the next line of questioning from Dean, "What the hell are you?" he asked apprehensively because being forced to work with something unknown and untrusted was familiar, but if he could find out what she was, he could prepare for how she could turn against him.
Now that they were returning, Dean realized that he was about to be stuck in a motel room with a sulky brother after an unresolved fight. Impulsively, he parked at a nearby coffee shop, Castiel walking behind him. Dean figured the Chevrolet would be safe where she was, doors locked. He would even be able to see her from the inside.

Ash looked at the fire, then at Dean, and then slapped his palm against his forehead. "Uh, yeah, dude, I forgot to warn you. Sometimes when souls stay here long enough, their concept of Heaven changes. Other souls become incorporeal."

“—Castiel, a happy birthday!” The speaker concluded.
know?”
The door dinged open, and Dean plastered a smile to his face to welcome the newcomer. It was drizzling outside, but it hadn’t deterred patrons from getting a pint or two to warm their bellies and a good dinner before heading home.
Dean shot Metatron in the head out of spite. Metatron just gave him an incredulous look as he fished out the bullet from his skull. It was grotesque and disturbing and got on Dean's last nerve. He shot Metatron a couple more times just because he could.
Jack is sitting opposite with a cereal bowl and a carton of milk, spooning his breakfast into his mouth. Castiel hesitates, rubbing his hands, but follows the instructions. The eggs definitely still had a bit of raw white on it on top of almost burnt edges. Dean ignores all of that while inhaling his coffee and seats himself beside Castiel.
Several waiters began circulating discreetly. They handed the attendees an alcoholic beverage in some fancy-ass glass. Dean barely paid them attention. His focus was on the stage wings. It’s where a similarly attired man came close to
had broken. Angel of Thursday, I would give you this one gift: absolution."
Castiel stepped away from the bus and towards the brothers’ car. “A forest reserve?”
Started on the false premise of fear of the High Lord of Hell and the kindred. (Politically it was more because of a Priestess wanting to become High Priestess of all three Realms.) The war caused the borders between the two Terreille and Kaeleer s to close. Also caused the kindred in Kaeleer to retreat into their own territories and close them to outsiders.
There was no music, and there was no pointless conversation about the weather or whether Castiel was eating appropriately. It was refreshing because Castiel could still turn and turn the thoughts of his case without being bothered to think of "small talk," something he still couldn't fully grasp.
Dean grinned and, despite the weapons-grade glare it earned him, clapped Sam’s shoulder. What was the problem with these two? You’d think they were the ones running on vapor.
Dean did end up bathing in the waterfalls under the Tree of Life. He needed Lucifer-decontamination because dealing with Lucifer three times in a row, twice of which without Michael as a buffer made him feel
This has a Christmas fic that's also part of the series, but not necessary for the plot here:
Castiel is so lost in his thoughts that by the time he’d been pelted with a face full of snow, it had barely registered. Once he turned around, he saw Hannah covering her face to control her laughter, Balthazar leaning on his axe with a wide grin, and both his son and Dean nowhere to be found.
"Alrighty then, I got me a totem showing paradise. How is this my life?" Dean muttered as he left the path and began walking back towards the Tree, sightseeing over. When Tessa had brought him over, he had never imagined that this was how he was going to end up in the afterlife of all things.
If this was the fourth heaven and Michael made his home here, then this space was probably cleared for all the troops that he commanded. A training ground for angels of sorts, ringing empty now that they were thrown out.
Castiel and Cassiel are two different angels, but during the transliteration of Castiel (Katzpiel, etc) scholars stumbled along the way and merged him with Cassiel (Kaphziel, Quafsiel). For the fic, I mean them as the same angel.
"Disturb all you want, Graceling." Lucifer gave a soft chuckle, seemingly
“Hey, sticky-nut-juice is peanut butter,” Dean points out. He unscrews the mayonnaise cap, topping his bread with the spread followed by the eggs and bacon. Castiel watches closely as he takes a bite. There is no gagging or otherwise ill effects to be had.
When Castiel still had grace, the Cage had looked like a monstrous thing: built with light and sound and power and will. It was something that angels had rarely touched, and was guarded with the strictest of confidences. In Raki'a they had stood as silent guards, because Lucifer's power was strong even behind its locked doors.
At least Kevin was safe, and Cas had found the name of the douchebag angel—good to know. They could try finding out more about Gadreel, but unless the angel resurfaced, they were at an impasse. Even Castiel hadn't recognized the impostor when he and Castiel had been face to face. Dean would forever be grateful that Kevin's sigil had worked against Gadreel and Sam had taken back his consent. It had been a rough few months trying to heal Sam, but at least the rogue angel had done a halfway decent job at healing Sammy, enough to tide him over. "Anything to help me with navigating
The man pauses and removes his hood, revealing dark brown hair and intense blue eyes under the sunlight. He tilts his head to the side before nodding to the closed blooms.
Castiel opens the inner barriers of his mind to Jack and shows him how to open the space that all Blood could access with Craft. The depths of Jack’s mind create a shallow pocket, showing hints of how deep the nestling’s power well will manifest.
Dean was contemplating his gun because the one thing a soul couldn't suddenly create in Heaven was an angel's blade. And he needed those so he could make bullets that could hurt Metatron. Dean's eyes didn't leave Metatron as he asked, "Charis? You wanna tell me what's going on?"
Dean couldn’t believe how good-looking this man was. It should be against the law to be this attractive.
“It’s not tea,” Castiel corrects him and pushes the warm drink back, stirring the cinnamon stick once around before removing it. “It’ll warm you after whatever fool errand you had, going out at this hour.”
He didn't want to talk about the entire demon mishap, but the music felt right, especially when they crooned
The one good thing about this is that they've broken their days-long silence.
Lisa did pretty well as a knocker-upper—one of the ladies who made sure that everyone woke up for their shifts in the Bevell factory. She had money to spare, but not the time nor the knowledge to fix the house since her husband died. Dean had met her at the bar, overheard her dilemma, offered his services, and he’d been with her ever since. If she occasionally invited him into the house, well... they were both lonely.
Nerf gun wars stolen from
Gabriel ended with, “The North Star, Polaris, is the guiding light when we’ve lost our way. I hope you let Polaris guide you as well.”
When Dean blinks, he’s standing in front of the Altar. On top of it is polished Green Jewel, as large as his fist. He glances at his father, who pulls him up and twirls him around like he was four again. “Birthright Green. Good job!”
Alfie wipes away a smear of dirt on his cheek. “Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be able to find a place that suits.” He sighs and returns to cleaning the stalls for the horses while Dean checks if Star Dancer has any wounds.
“He’ll get no relief other than from you,” Michaela decreed, and then Sapphire-locked the doors, leaving Balthazar’s chambers accessible to her and Castiel alone.
The Warlord Prince could follow them but Lady Mosely’s defenses would weather an attack from him. It would do until the District Queen or a stronger Warlord Prince arrives.
Sam’s cabin was messy, with books on every surface. Dean even spotted Sam’s old NovaTel phone used as a bookmark.
Once past the threshold, Dean was assailed with the aroma of roasted beef.
the Repository of Souls – probably still has souls. What it does not have are the messengers to deliver them from the repository to humans."
Freighter travel didn’t have baggage limits; anything went, especially for trips of more than a few weeks’ duration. Provided you could accommodate them in your berth, you could even bring your own hologram-engines and trunk of books. This made it the perfect method of long-distance travel for people who were migrating—or, in Castiel’s case, running away.
"How am I going to contact Gabriel?" Castiel wondered out loud, just as
"No," Dean protests. Isn't it enough that he has to learn a bunch of words that make little sense and has too many consonants with a whole slew of weird inflections? Did he have to learn anatomy too?
much. Of course, I didn't leave my soul mate and family behind, so there isn't much of anybody to pray to me back at home."
"Uh… that's actually Father showing his multiple personality disorder." Castiel sometimes didn't get how Gabriel became this irreverent because surely an archangel would have better manners with regard to their Father when he was created. Although Castiel couldn't judge, he had lost a bit of his faith sometime before the Apocalypse-that-was-not. "I mean three faces in one God thing? But… close enough.
He opened his eyes, and they rested on the Bible. One of the old copies, well-worn from use. Dean hesitated before reaching out. "All right, all right. I can take a hint, buddy."
The man raised his head, and the hood fell back. Dean dropped his pencil with a muted thump. “Dad?”
And he is hungry.
I press my ear to the wall listening to the heavy stomping of boots against the wooden floor. Soon, the flicker of torchlight shows through the gap of the closed door. Even my brother couldn’t completely seal my room to block the stale wind from the musty tower. He did brick up the room’s only window.
The man sets the bowl on a bedside table before touching the dressing. Dean draws back sharply, which earns him a reprimanding look.
The holo shone as an arrow on the floor. The watch buzzed against Castiel’s arm as he finished packing, notifying him that he needed to turn to follow Nova’s instructions.
“It’s industrial-sized, Dean, in Heaven. It wasn’t going to stay destroyed,” Cas protested.
Castiel had only been kissed three times. Once when his childhood friend, Meg, decided to teach him what a real kiss was. Then with Inias, when they were young and finding out about themselves. Lastly, with Balthazar, because the man took kisses the same as he did trophies and freighter ships.
, but it’s clear that he’s already
The rest of the lights in the enclave are extinguished, and he calls witch-fire to burn last year’s log, before using it to kindle the bonfire. It glows a deep blue, and with Castiel’s Sapphire, it will last until the log runs out. The anointing oils waft from the fire, filling the yard with its woodsy aroma.
Sure enough, they catch up with Jack, who’s already dusting off the snow from a sizable weathered oak. Hannah examines the old tree from all angles before nodding her agreement.
It was an unprecedented task because in the old days their Father had done all the linking of worlds. It was also the reason why in all attempts of opening the gates, this particular method had not been tried. Not only were they sorely lacking in archangels, but they also lacked the proper number to form a flight.
"I'm sure you're going to tell me," Sam muttered.
Without hunts, Sam has been obsessively going over the statistics of the virus. He waits for daily updates in the county where Lebanon is. (Because if he doesn’t, he’ll start watching the presidential press conference, which is
"So what are you going to do?" Bobby asked offering a beer to Dean. "You still have one ingredient to remember, right?"
“The offer’s still on the table.” Gabriel sighed. “At the very least, I hope you’re finally learning how to enjoy yourself on your epic road trip. Oh, and don’t forget—for bacon bars, maple bacon doughnuts, and french toast at Donut Den, I’ll happily keep Michael off your back a little while longer.”
the signage proclaimed in white serif.
Castiel landed beside Dean on the Throne of Glory. Castiel took into account the state that Dean's soul was in, tattered as one could only be with a fight with an angel powered by the Word of God. Dean being solid and pure, was the Righteous Man, and therefore, one of the few that could pass through the rivers of Aravoth.
"But—"
John notes the almost empty mug and the tangled web, a weave used by the Black Widows to understand dreams and visions, cast to the side. Dean is positioned protectively around her, despite his slumber. John raises his eyebrows in concern when he turns to his wife. “Something wrong?”
“Hey, hey,” Dean cut him off before Cas went on a litany of apologies. “It doesn’t matter. I had fun, just try not to surprise me the next time, okay, I can only handle one surprise per lifetime.”
sarcasm. Well, this was off to a good start.
Castiel hums, fishing out his cellphone from his pocket before reading, “Do you come here often or wait till you get home?”
“What do you mean, oh?” Dean asked suspiciously. “Oh, that’s where my ring went? ‘Cuz then—eww.”
Alfie winces as he pops out his shoulder. He shakes his head. “You think this is punishment? If only. I’m starting to think whipping and blatant misuse of Protocol is the norm and not the exception.”
Still skeptical, the Prince eyes the drink with distaste but takes a tentative sip. Dean pauses, inhales the warm scent of lemon, honey, and cinnamon blended with the malt. He takes a long swallow from the drink before he concedes with, “It’s not bad.”
Katja snorts as she sets aside the herbs and her freshly chopped onions, then turns towards the stove to stoke the fire. "I shouldn't even have been in this village if that
Ash looked surprised at the request for a minute before nodding. "Sure you want that dude? I mean, not a lot of people skip on their axis mundi. It's the best parts of your life. Like finding an application of string theory and just being completely excited about everything, you know?"
Maybe it was the dim lighting, with the spotlight on center stage. Maybe it was the holos, but Dean felt like he’d been thrown under a stampede. He’d seen Cas in every corner of his world in the years he’d separated with him. While Sam called him out on it when they were in the Roadhouse, once he’d burned bridges with Castiel, it was as if his specter followed him everywhere.
"Kevin Tran," Nathaniel acknowledged, although no hand was offered. It had been ages since a handshake was used to show proof of being weaponless, but Nathaniel would remember its archaic function rather than as a ritual to convey equality, neither of which was in an angel's makeup in the first place. They had their own version of a salute, but handshakes were virtually unheard of. "We certainly do not have libraries in this garrison that contain what you seek."
Castiel was undoubtedly a little bit confused with where the conversation was going. While the Caretaker was something that he had asked about and was certainly something he wanted to know to better help Dean, Castiel had thought that Leilah talking to Gabriel was mostly because of the Treasury of Souls.
They walked in silence for a few minutes as they took in the sights. When they passed a store called ‘JK Gift Shop,’ they saw a picturesque sitting area with small trees and potted flowers of white, maroon, and yellow. The red brick floor inset with wooden benches to allow passersby to rest and relax.
Sam laughs and reminds Dean, “He’s also never forgotten beer, Busty Asian Beauties, or
Castiel could see that though Dean understands the words, he was at a loss at the distinction.
Dean took a deep breath. "Really? Out of all things you could've asked me to read? Special or not…"
Also, a warning that it would be progressively harder to leave the territory.
Castiel’s grip is unyielding, and his eyes bore into Dean’s. “But you. You’re the only one that I’ve served that has given me free will. So for whatever short time I have with you, you’ve become
“I doubt you’ve had a good meal on the road. Come eat,” Bobby demanded, setting an extra plate for Castiel before taking his place at the head of the table.
. It felt more like grief instead of anger, and he wanted the tape to be uplifting rather than negative.
in the first heaven. This is a projection. We could only power that spell transiently," Gabriel corrected as he motioned to himself, and for the first time, Castiel noted that Gabriel was seemed almost incorporeal. The first circle was the easiest for them to link, not only because it was the closest to Earth, but also because Vilon was Gabriel's domain.
While Enochian was the language of the angels, Latin was the language for prayer to his Father. It was why he still prayed in Latin even though Enochian and the Song were his. He touched the simple marker briefly and said,

But Sam still owed Dean for the way he woke him up onboard the NISC Twelve. Sam tiptoed to his bed, grabbed a pillow then threw it at Dean. His brother snorted and shot up with a slurred “wha—?” before Dean finished his word, Sam heaved another pillow at his face.

Luke took a champagne glass from a passing waiter and raised it. “Happy birthday, brother. And congratulations.”
“Yeah, Cas. What do you say?”
Castiel furrows his brows and flaps his wings several times before he realizes that his wings are so wet that his skin is warm and slippery from oil. When Castiel stretches awkwardly to touch his preening glands, his fingers come away with the thick oil, thicker than he’s used to. He grimaces and gives Dean an accusatory glare before he calls in a soft cloth and attempts to mop it up.
Lucien’s duties as a District Queen requires her regular contact with her sister. It means that though short, Jacob has scheduled visits to Mount Ararat. It is frequent enough that the slaves have given him a nickname, Jack.
having his currency seized at customs. Then he stripped every gaudy jewel-encrusted bauble Michael had ever given him and tucked them into his clothes and the crevices in his cabin suitcase. A good thing about travel by sea was that he would not get parted from his luggage.
A conversation that they’d began a long time ago. In a dance that Castiel had forgotten the steps to. “The stars, unlike the sunrise, are much more enduring.”
Dean checks the snow for the tracks they left, but Jack’s are conspicuously absent. A harsh predatory cry from the distance causes Dean to tense, searching the treeline. The forests and the deep valleys between the eyries are perfect for Jhinka raiding parties.
Gabriel smirked at their family before he followed Castiel out, calling back, “Watch the sales of this little side project, Mother. It’s gonna entertain you when you miss us.”
Dean swivels his attention to Becky, who was nodding enthusiastically a big smile plastered across her face. “Yes, Mr. Novak did intend to give them to you.”
After that awful heart-to-heart with Sam that he did not want to repeat, he played

at what he does. He doesn’t need some fancy school to tell him what he already knows.
“The usual: He’s set in his ways,” Dean said, as he walked towards Sam slowly. Sam still had his mechanical assist arm attached. Though Dean sat on top of the construction, Sam wouldn’t be a Winchester if he didn’t know at least something about the engines. He must have been fixing a personal project before settling down to read. “Sam, you need to pack.”
“My vessel enjoyed hamburgers,” Castiel corrected as he accompanied them to their seats before he left, presumably to fetch the brothers Winchester.

“I didn’t wash the dishes,” Dean confirms, grinning.
," Castiel answered testily, because Sam could truly wear down on his patience. "There was a case, and that superseded all other needs."
A grin started to blossom on Gabriel's face, which had been somber up until that moment. Castiel suspected there was going to be teasing because Castiel had been a malakh, turned seraph, still below an archangel's power, but had gone up against one without batting an eyelash. "Dear old Raph is in time-out, he'll be a child for another eighteen years, at least. Besides, despite being a traditionalist and really hostile, Raphael had always shown that he was willing to forgive you even before you did a
He slowly backed away to give them their privacy. He’d intruded enough.
“I’m a Novak,” Castiel blurted the confession in one syllable, words tripping over each other.

“You could get a job a lot easier.  Backing up all that knowledge you have with a qualification,” Sam said with an air of nonchalance.
“I’m sure they wouldn’t put it there if it wasn't safe,” he said. He saw  Sam rolling his eyes in his periphery, and Dean waggled his eyebrows at his brother, then at Manny. Sam shook his head but smiled at the current passengers going round and round. Dean’s grin changed from teasing to fond as he watched Sam’s happiness.
“I think it’ll get better the more your night vision adapts,” Sam says as he pulls up a flashlight from beside the telescope. When he clicks it on, it is in an unusual red instead of white. “This’ll help with the night vision when we check the books.”
And okay, since his prayers came in the form of letters, and—if what Ash said was true—Dean was the only gardener, it stood to reason that Heaven had accommodated him so that it would fit his understanding. These were the prayers to God. Michael probably had offered them until they'd locked him in the Cage.
Bobby put down his fork. “So, what’s in California for you Winchesters?”

He shifted Sam to make room for himself on the bed, sitting on the edge. “You know Dad does this to save all the other kids so they have homes to return to and get to ask for ponies for Christmas.”
Castiel buried himself in the crook of Dean’s neck. He breathed in the scent of leather and Dean before he answered, “I think it’s selfish of me to want this.”
“Hey, how long am I supposed to steep in these stinky herbs?” Dean asks with his thumb tracing the curve of Castiel’s collarbone.
Dean likes to grumble to keep Castiel on his toes, but they cover a great deal of groundwork the following weeks. Even if it irritates Castiel that Dean's magic is complimentary, but isn't similar, he soldiers on.
"Dean, I'm sorry." Dean scrambled up to a standing position, tensing when he saw Charis in the cell with him. She leaned forward slowly, then suddenly latched on to his legs giving him a tight hug. "I didn't think he'd bring you to Raki'a. "
Coughing, Dean struggles to stand up, attempting to follow when the massive tail of the griffin sweeps under his feet and trips him.
Dean is suddenly sure that Castiel is the Prince of Light, and he needs him out of Terreille’s influence before it’s too late.
By the time he was home, he was tired and needed to fall into the dreamless sleep of the dead. Although he didn't

“Don’t you go giving pies away to that cantankerous old coot. You’d be wasting fillin’.” Bobby motions for John to come in while muttering under his breath.
Bobby snorted. "You were Michael's chosen vessel, but Zachariah tried to force you plenty. You were hurt because you were Heaven's chosen. It doesn't need to be a physical act of violence, boy, although Lucifer did almost beat you dead."
“They will take you from hearth and home, and they will force you to kneel. They will ring you and bind you to their will. They will bring you to the hunting camps to train. They will hold you for centuries. You will not break, Castiel, you must not break because through you, we will receive the Light. It may take years, or centuries, or tomorrow, but you

"Because neither you nor I wanted it to be vines, therefore, the magic wasn't tethered strongly enough." Cas clears his throat before withdrawing his hands from Dean's waist, taking away the soft zing through Dean's skin. Dean thinks the charge must have been Castiel's grace. He kind of likes it.
This fic was brought about because I really really wanted to world build Heaven. (I mean a lot of fics out there have Heaven in the point of view of the humans, but what about the angels?) There's a ton of Hell ones, and a lot of Purgatory ones, but not a lot of Heaven ones. (I asked myself, but WHY? I mean Heaven seems to be open to a lot of world building and there are a ton of inherent flaws in Heaven that you'd want to work out). It came hand in hand with a meta I read about the Spell
It turns out, Dean's plan is equal to turning himself into another pre-pubescent kid and running around in the field with Benny. They've been doing it for the past week, and although nobody has seen Katja, Dean remains hopeful.
Castiel looked back at the door. The first chapter in the book of Samuel had been about Samuel being dedicated to God. "The baby is going to die?" Castiel had phrased it as a question, but they both knew that it was a definite thing.
A month into their stay in Palo Alto found Sam and Dean lodging above Harvelle’s Roadhouse. Bobby Singer proved to be a godsend, introducing them to the wife of an old hunting buddy. Ellen took one look at their bedraggled appearance and set them both to work—Dean as a bartender and Sam as a busboy. They were given free room and board and were paid the full going rate despite their lack of job permits.
"The stars have fallen." There were no angels in heaven. It sounded like the beginnings of a prophecy written in a stone tablet. And if it wasn't, then it damn well should be. "I guess you would be in a barren place without Heaven's soldiers."
As an aside to
Jack is entirely white, the flour covering his face, having taken a full shot to his face. Sam has some leftover dough on his hair, from pizza on the ceiling coming down at an inopportune moment. Dean has some tomato sauce splatter, and Cas is relatively unscathed, having received peltings of wilted greens.
And it was somewhat fitting that he ask perpetual light for his former charge. There was a lyrical quality to prayer in Latin, and it was personal enough that only God and he understood it right now.
Castiel closed his hand into a fist in frustration before he accepted the decision and stepped back from Dean. Dean had time to put the recording safely away before Cas looked for Sam and took them to Van Nuys.
"I usually turn them to infants because they taste better. Consuming them gives me immortality. You are what you eat, you know," Katja answers cheerfully, feeling Dean's arms, then clucking. "Aww, you're so scrawny, we have to fatten you up."
Castiel scrambled to follow and saw Dean was pulling out several tools.

The room had been cold that day, blistering in a Warlord Prince’s fury. But a quick burst of the Ring of Obedience hobbled Castiel to let go of his power, and he sank stiffly to his knees.
"We should go on a hunt," Ash announced, taking in the dark circles under Dean's eyes, the bulky King James Bible open to
While Castiel was wrestling with the midnight-blue cravat, Gabriel entered unceremoniously. His brother was dressed in a red and black brocade frock, eyeing Castiel’s outfit. “Balthazar may still be an utter dewdropper and an egg, but the man has taste. And he’s got your measurements.”
Sam’s hands were fidgeting over the napkins, and he took the statement with mild disbelief. “Go back to the Ark? So I wouldn’t leave again?”
"I don't think it works that way, boy," Bobby apologized, approaching him and placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. "It doesn't come when forced."
“I think so too,” he breathed, as a few shooting stars go by.
A shooting pain explodes from Dean's shoulder when they hit the ground. He notices heat radiating from the area, and he knows that the joint is definitely either broken or dislocated. He feels the blood rush from his face to fill up the shoulder before he finally loses consciousness due to the pain.
Castiel rolled his eyes at Gabriel but didn’t comment. He touched the NovaWatch that was resting on his desk but decided against wearing it, settling on solely using Polaris instead. “I’m ready,” he announced.
Dean prepared what he could to hunt the wild beast. He learned traps and trained with the hunters, just as his brother studied with the Men of Letters. Nightly, Dean made his rounds through the woods, wearing a red hood and searched for the monster.
John snorted, then turned the wheel to check for grooves on the rotor and the thickness of the brakes. “I told you the boy needed a purpose other than designing things and looking after Sam.”
“That you’re a Black Widow?” Her mouth fell open wordlessly before John powered through, “You’re part of the Coven of the Hourglass. It’s why we’re here.”
." She pressed a fist against her chest. Like there was a hole that she'd managed to fill with the endless stories. Stories that she'd read about in the books that she filled her heaven with. Stories that weren't hers.
Dean huffs. "Show off."
From where he paused, he spotted flyers beside the door, almost blocking the “open” sign. Instantly interested in them, he skimmed the contents. There were flyers for missing people or items, ads for products, and upcoming events.
“You forgot your bag, sir.”
“Come in!” Mary hollered.
. We're in Heaven. I'm trusting the Pearly Gates to block anyone that's gonna kill me." The words came unbidden to be contrary to Lucifer. Dean couldn't come up with any sass when he agreed with the fallen angel in the first place.
Gabriel, and certainly not about the Caretaker of the Throne," Leilah chimed in. Castiel hoped that if there were someone who could convince Gabriel about the endeavor, it would be Leilah, whom he'd worked with for a while. "We are broken in our ranks without an archangel, Gabriel. It has been so long that we've had infighting and bickering and
Castiel hadn’t known what to expect of their first meeting, but it wasn’t the restrained civility they’d offered each other.
Because the third and fourth heaven had opened to the open-air, Dean had expected the seventh heaven to have the same nature theme. However, the Tree in Aravoth was planted in front of a hallway, blocked by a locked door. It had the same corridors in the sterile neutral white that Dean had seen in Castiel's dream; that is until Dean held Michael's key in his hand.
Castiel stops and hesitates behind the door. He is unknowingly waiting for the prophecy I have not spoken in years. I whisper it now, the prophecy that has damned me into the dark, “They will break and bleed and tear our lands. They will take our children and sell them off as slaves. The Angelus will be no more. Those who survive will be cut off from the Darkness and walk without the Light.”
Gabriel gave him a cheeky smile. "Always the Doubting Thomas aren't you, Cassie? Yes, brother. We have talked, the Tree and I, and we have reformed our bonds. I am here, I have connected to the Tree. The delivery of souls has been my task since Creation, and it will be done until I lose my connection again. I will not lose it unless the Gates remain closed or whatever anomaly Michael caused repeats itself."
“All right,” Dean grunted.
Alastair had secured a reservation for them in a restaurant, earlier. Dean had escorted Lucian and Jack to the pastry display. Meanwhile, Samandiriel and Castiel wait by the tables.
Castiel knew the moment Bobby hit his grace. The pain was excruciating, worse than the time that he'd been flayed in Raki'a during his indoctrination. It felt like Bobby was breaking off pieces of himself, scourging them, then pulling out all of his bones and nerves, and setting them ablaze. By the time that Bobby had filled an entire syringe, Castiel was close to passing out, sweat dotted his brow, and he had made gouges where his fingernails had torn through the leather on Bobby's couch.
to find that tape. He fended Sam off by asking, "have you touched this box?"
"Some beings are long-lived and tough enough to kill that they believe they're immortal; and then some things are truly immortal, because Father made it so," Gabriel related in the serious tones that he rarely used. He had stopped laying down the base for the spell and stood over one of the roots to infuse the Enochian base with his grace. "Father made fixed points where he anchored this world's creation."
“Oh,” Sam pauses, his sandwich halfway to his mouth, while Dean is silently devouring his own—as much as Dean is silent with his food. “I didn’t know that they actually made nougat cereal?”
Sam groans, “No, Cas! No!”
Cas tilts his head to the side, seriously considering the request. Dean is thankful that the man doesn't disregard the wish as silly.
“Is everything all right?” Castiel asked, tentatively. Dean grunted, and Sam looked away.
The forest gives Dean an advantage. With how the trees are together, the griffin can't fully open its wings. It leaps, and Dean prepares himself for the impact of those claws, as he draws his word to its full length and braces himself.
"Michael and Lucifer can only be reached through the ninth circle of Hell. Without wings and a proper seven, we are not breaking through the walls of Hell for that conversation," Castiel answered for her because he was not going to be forgotten in the middle of this conversation.
"Why do I have a feeling I'm going to regret coming out of witness protection for you, little bro?"
Castiel grits his teeth but forces his hands to continue with his ministrations. Any slowing would alert her of emotion. Both that he wants to spend time with Jack and that he’s been counting the moments until the child’s return.
"Alright. And?"
A broken sob ripped through his chest. He pressed his hands against the wet tiles.
Dean's eyebrows shot up. "How did---"
"You should'a seen him try to pull out of the driveway," Sam muttered into his glass. He took a long sip and grinned. "Looked like he was leavin'---"
Dean drove home in silence trying to make sense of what just happened. He pulled into his garage and shut the car off. Sitting there he tried to calculate how much it would actually cost him to pay for Sam's needs and his own. He looked at his modest apartment, wondering what it would be like to be able to afford something bigger and newer. He patted the steering wheel and smiled.
Castiel nodded and bit his lip, keeping himself from crying out.
“Cassie, he isn’t going anywhere. You need to get some rest,” Gabriel yawned and stretched on the misshapen cushions strewn across the floor.
Do it Cas!
"Actually," she pressed her lips together and shifted the bag, "I was going to thank you." Dean's eyes widened and he winced immediately at the pain. "As you so eloquently but it, Lucy is a dick. He's my son and I love him, but we do not tolerate that kind of hateful talk in this family."
Dean’s nose flared as he stared at Charlie. “Excuse me?”
"Indeed it is. One escape proof demon cage once mother and...I'm sorry, dear, I've forgotten your name." Crowley cocked his head to the side. "What exactly is her purpose here, Moose? A pretty little thing like here won't last long here in---"
All the moments leading up to this, this right now, didn’t matter. The first star being born and lighting the darkness of a new galaxy. A ball of dirt slowly growing into a habitable planet. God’s and men, war and peace. Nothing mattered more than when their lips touched for the first time.
Amara smirked. “That’s cute.” She flicked her wrist and in an instant, all Castiel saw was black. Voices started screaming in his head.
Castiel hummed thoughtfully as he waded his way over to Dean. He watched Dean watch him, smiling when his tail fin floated up to wrap around Dean's ankle. He narrowed his eyes and gave an experimental tug.
“Ooooh look at da big bad angel,” Dean said in a deep voice.
“Cas,” Dean sighed, “thank God. Listen---”
Castiel tilted his head, eyebrows pulling together. "Of course." He held up his hand for Dean to lead the way.
Are you guys ready for some smmmmut?? If not, turn away now because there's a hefty dose in here!
Castiel chuckled and kissed Dean softy. "Maybe one day I'll even have a pair of my own."
“I don’t know. I think I need to lie down.” Castiel turned on wobbly legs, stepping around his brother. Gabriel helped lead him to the couch.
"So---you're friends?" Dean asked with a raised eyebrow.
Dean's eyes bulged. "Le--leaving? You're--," he scoffed and his hand over his mouth, "you're joking, right?"
"That's it---that's---yes, fuck, Cas, I'm gonna come," Dean whispered hoarsely, pouring himself into the angel.
The angel complied and looked up at Sam in confusion. "This seems serious, Sam."
Castiel rolled his eyes and slapped his tail hard in the water making it splash over the side.
Sam shrugged. “Don’t peck the hand that helps you.”
Castiel took the water bottle and held it up, showing Dean that he was complying before taking a sip.
Gabriel sucked Sams lower lip in and bit down as he slammed into him. Trailed nips and bites down his neck as he reached up and pulled hard at the base of his neck. He fucked into him deeper with each thrust, pulling Sams hair in time with them.
Dean’s cheeks flushed and he pushed his glasses up his nose.
Sam's eyes lit up and smiled over at Charlie. "Of course, yeah. We'll go right now." He walked over and pulled his brother in for a tight hug before grabbing Charlies hand and leaving the hut.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean. Aren’t you supposed to be out drinking and being obnoxiously loud?” He flopped back on his bed and closed his eyes.
"Jacket," he said simply, holding out his hand.
Tears fell from Deans eyes as he nodded.
on the property, Dean. Somethin' you can't tear out or rip down. It's rooted deep."
"Mhmm," Castiel hummed, smiling back at Dean.
"Uh," his eyes flew around the room and landed on the window. "The snow," he gestured with his head. "It's--the snow is beautiful."
Gabriel flinched away and backed up into Lucy.
Alistair looked down at Dean and dragged his free hand through his hair before yanking his head back at an uncomfortable angle, making Dean cry out.
Sam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "All I'm saying, Dean, is you gotta start thinkin' about this stuff if you plan on---you know,
"It's not Dean doing those things, Sam." Castiel stood and braced himself on the dresser across from him. "When...when those things happen, it's not Dean. It's the mark." He turned and faced Sam. "It's not always bad."
“That’s nothin’.” Dean crossed his arms and grinned. “Show them the goods, Cas,” he said with a wink.
“I’ve been here for a long time. A very long time. But nothing in this universe is more important to me than you are.” He furrowed his brow, holding Deans hand tighter. “I’m certain that I was put in this world to be with you, Dean. Nothing in my life has made me happier. I’ve misjudged situations countless times and made more mistakes than I care to admit,” his eyes watered as he stepped in close to Dean, personal space long gone. “but somehow, you always seem to fix it. Fix me. You make me, a flightless broken angel, feel like I’m worth something. You took me in. You were patient.”
Castiel sighed. "It's been tough to say the least."
“Dean,” Castiel breathed out. His hand rose out of the water and reached up to grip the familiar gently by the back of his neck. He moaned loudly when he felt Dean’s stubbled chin press into his shoulder and his mouth wrap around the sensitive skin there. His eyes flew open and saw his reflection in the water. Bright orange eyes stared back at him as he gripped Dean’s neck tighter.
"Wait.
Cas and Dean never wind up eating meatloaf.
“My mother painted those for me when I was three. She would spend a lot of time in here with me while the others were in class.” He leaned back on his elbows and stared at the ceiling.
It was Dean's turn to not blink. His heart was hammering in his chest and he felt like he was going to pass out or throw up.
Castiel whipped around, clutching a pair of socks. "Dean," he hissed.
Castiel stood and turned to face Dean. “Does it look like I’m joking? Dean, I left the castle when I was young. I live in a hut and avoid people at all costs. Is it really so hard to believe that I’ve never—never done—”
"It was gettin' pretty hot and heavy over there!" Gabriel yelled. "Thought I'd help you two cool down!"
"Hello, Dean."
"This isn't a negotiation, Crowley," Sam cocked an eyebrow.
"Ruby works for a team of assassins that rival our own. She hasn't been seen in years, always looks different. Changes her hair, her eye color, weight and what have you," Michelle tossed a hand in the air. "That's the reason I threw this ridiculous party. I was hoping to flush her out."
Castiel tensed and inhaled sharply at the touch.
“Sir, your father has requested an audience with you,” the man in front announced.
"We check on him from time to time, make sure things are alright. But, Dean," Ellen softened her usual glare and looked down at Dean with sad eyes, "he just---there isn't anything we can do for him. Every time we'd go he'd get less and less interested, stay down in the water and wouldn't come up."
"Dean---"
"Lemme help you with that," Dean offers as he jogs over to her, taking the tray. "One of these for me?" he asks, pursing his lips and narrows his eyes playfully.
"That will have to wait," Michelle interrupted. "I have a job for you two."
"Gods, Castiel," Dean panted. Reaching up, Dean let his hand trace over Castiel's bonding mark. It's magic floated out and intertwined with his fingers, sending shock waves down his arm.
“Oh! Right, so---damn it.” He sighed and flipped his phone over.
But still, fuck this place right now.
A hand ran up his arm to his shoulder, pulling him in slightly. Dean felt Castiel breathe his name against his lips before he leaned forward and closed the distance between them, pressing their lips together in a gentle kiss.
The Impala rumbled to a stop in the driveway. Dean shut her door gently, running his hand over the hood as he walked by.
More for himself. More for Sam. More money wouldn't be bad either. But for now, working at the The Garrison wasn't all that bad. The regulars knew him by name (and reputation), he was friends with
Castiel cocked his head. “I thought you two—”
“Heya, Cassie. Havin’ a good time?” She swirls her drink in her red cup and smiles wide at him.
Castiel ran his fingers through Deans hair. "It's ok, Dean. I knew."
“Shit,” Sam hissed, turning off the heat and quickly moving the pan to the back of the stove.
Dean scowled and chugged half his beer before heading into the living room. His brother was sitting on the couch with his feet propped up on the table.
"No way," Dean hissed. "You ever call him out on it?"
Castiel released her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder, leading her towards a very confused Dean.
She threw her hands up with a sigh. "Fine. Anything for you, my sweet. By the way," Rowena looked down at her shoes, "that menace of a brother owes me $875."
"Take mine," Sam said quietly. "I'll take the couch. Dean has his sleeping bag."
His phone felt like a boulder in his hand as he sat at the table with Castiel. He typed out a message earlier and had it gripped tight under the table, biding his time. They were eating dinner and talking about the documentary premiering tonight.
Dean turned his head and raised his eyebrows. “Huh. This is not what I expected.”
"Oh fuck," Alfie sighed, lowering his head. His hands shook so hard the chair rattled and his eyes brimmed with tears.
"They killed my dad?"
Dean takes a moment to collect himself. He wipes his cheek with the back of his hand before standing up and heading out of his room.
"He better be. I ain't payin' his tuition for him to fuck off and get wasted every night." Dean grabbed a rag and wiped down the bar, shoving Gabriel out of the way. "Not that he would, though. He's a fucking nerd."
Castiel took two steps forward and tilted his head. “Dean, you know you can talk to me, right? About anything.”
“You’re SUCH, a baby,” Sam said as he swung the car door open. “Remember, free bar.”
“Gabriel and I were at the market, and like he said, Dean quite literally fell from the sky. I was buying herbs and I felt like something was pulling me up into the air. A force pulled me to my feet and jerked my head back and then—he just fell. I caught him and brought him back here to help with his nausea.”
“Cas! Please open the door. We gotta talk, man.” He raised his fist to knock again just as the door whipped open.
Dean bit his lip as he straightened his posture and nodded shyly.
Castiel lips tightened into a small smile. "Would you join me outside? I could use a smoke."
It rose slowly, inch by inch, until Dean could make out the shape. A human head was now visibly rising out of the water, ice blue eyes already open and glaring at Dean. Its black hair was covering most of its face. Mossy green scales were spattered around the cheeks and forehead. The most concerning? Its lips were curled into a snarl revealing long, sharp fangs.
Speaking of--- Dean walked to the bathroom and pressed his ear against the door.
"So let me get this straight- the witches cursed Cas, the spell broke because Dean showed up, and now they're back to finish the job?"
“Dean, sorry for the surprise. I thought Castiel would have remembered the coalescence tradition. I hope we didn’t overwhelm you.”
bird fell straight from the sky and into his arms. He was so protective of it. It was like something out of a storybook. He wouldn’t even let the other man that was with him get close enough to touch it. They took the bird with them.”
Dean pulled away and scowled. "Sorry lady, I don't pay." He picked up his beer and was about to leave when the woman grabbed his arm.
Dean’s eyes scanned the room, looking for the source of the voices. They landed on three heads hanging from the ceiling, excitedly bouncing up and down and bumping in to each other. He stomped over and grabbed one.
"Cas," Dean whispered.
Castiel flopped onto the bed as he heard the shower turn on. He dug in his pocket and pulled out his phone. As expected, there were multiple missed calls and texts from Charlie. He groaned when it began vibrating in his hand.
Castiel kissed up his chest and to his mouth before he stopped. His swollen lips and heaving chest made Dean regret his decision immediately. "Too much?" Castiel guessed.
Castiel started a slow, even pace. Rocking his hips and trailing his hand down Dean's sweat-slick back.
His head was buzzing with words he’d been dying to say to Dean.
He felt Castiel bristle behind him as Michelle huffed a laugh through her nose. She reached over and pulled on the top of a silver canister, revealing a compartment of cigarettes. "Do you smoke Dean?" she offered, gesturing to the canister.
Dinner went along smoothly, except for the occasional glare from Lucifer and a spilled drink from Naomi that Cain promptly cleaned up. They moved into the living room for dessert and Gabriel caught Dean up to speed on his family.
Dean started at the black liquid in his cup before shrugging and taking a drink. He sighed and leaned his head against the soft headboard. "Ok."
“It can end here,” Castiel whispered. “Let it end.”
Dean snorted into his glass, taking a long drink. He licked his lips and shook his head. "Nah, I like it. Keeps me outta trouble."
"Shit, you ok?" Dean reached out and rubbed Cas' shoulder blade gently. Carrying the guy into the house took away the initial shock of touching his skin and scales pretty quick, but Dean still shivered at each touch. "Bein' cramped in this tub must suck. Used to being able to stretch out in the pool, huh?"
Dean walked up to the witch and rested his hands on either shoulder. “Hey, not that I don’t like being in the same room as you all the time, but at some point we’re going to have to be apart. We gotta test it.” Castiel sighed and lifted his hands to rest on the familiars wrists. “As awesome as you are, Cas, I don’t think it’ll be that hard. Just—push the pain away and find me as fast as possible ok? It’ll be alright. If I can’t take it before you find me, I’ll come back and we’ll meet here. Sound good?”
"Aww," Alistair cooed. He bent down close to Dean's ear. "What'd I tell ya?" he whispered. "Love makes people stupid." He rose to his full height and pulled a knife from his back pocket and gripped Deans face with the blade dangerously close to his eye. "If I cut him free and you try anything, I'll end him. Got it?"
Gabriel hung his arms over Dean and his brothers shoulders as they walked into the castle.
“You don’t get it, man. I owe Cas everything. He pulled me outta hell.”
Michelle kissed their cheeks and said goodnight before walking to her car. Castiel leaned against one of the large pillars and watched as she climbed into her car.
“That so?” He took another step towards redhead and smirked. “You hurt my angel?”
The demon shook underneath him, searching Dean’s eyes for any sign of lying.
“You thought turning into a hot chick who just HAPPENED to like all the same shit I did, that would make me happy?” Dean shrugged the angels hand off. “Real smart, Cas.”
Bobby eyed Sam for a minute and snorted. "Baby brother? He's three feet taller 'n you, boy. C'mon in, Ellen made lunch." Bobby led them into the dining room where Ellen was setting the table with plates and napkins. "Ell, this is Sam, Dean's brother."
“You don’t need to ask, Dean. Everything here is yours now, too.”
Sam frowned and fidgeted in his seat. "I uh, got somethin' to tell you."
“Well, yeah. We thought this was going to be a tough fight,” Sam muttered.
Sam gripped his hard cock, lifting it so the tip grazed across the angels lips.
Sam's voice melted into the background as Dean eyed the bright blue streaks on his brothers arm. He'd be lying if he said he wasn't a little jealous, but deep down it scared the shit out of him. He instinctively balled his fists and pressed them to his thighs. The thought that your world revolves around one thing and one thing only- finding your soulmate, made him angry and sad at the same time.
"Not usually but I sure as fuck could use one after what I just saw."
Castiel removed his suit jacket and rolled up his sleeves slowly, eyeing the man in the chair. "Wake him up."
"Apologies. Personal issues needed tending to," he muttered. He looked down at the man he was currently pinning to the floor with his foot. The man gasped and choked on his own blood.
Biting his tongue and stretching up on his tiptoes, Dean smacked the duct taped corner of the banner against the wall and sighed. “Because, Cas, it’s what humans do.” He looked down and started climbing down the ladder until he was face to face with the ex angel. “And now that you’re human, Sammy ‘n I are going to start celebrating stuff like this.” He looked up at his handwork and smiled.
Dean's eyes watered as he removed his trembling hand. He choked back a sob as he ran his fingers over the blue hand print. He looked up to Castiel who smiled and placed his hand on Deans chest.
Dean licked his lips and shook his head. "Shame, too. You look fine as hell in 'em." He walked over and rested his hands on Castiel's hips. "I don't think I'll ever get tired'a lookin' at you in my clothes."
“I’m sure he’s alright, Dean. Guy’s an angel after all. He knows how ta take care’a himself.” Benny patted his friend roughly on the shoulder. “Does he know?
Dean looked into the witch’s eyes and smiled. “’Course. I mean, we’re already bonded, so why not?”
Castiel nodded sharply. "Of course. Dean needs me here."
Castiel stepped closer to Dean and tilted his head. “Are you actually going to shave his head?”
“Hey, Cas, stop shovin’! You don’ even eat food!”
"Sorry to be the one to tell ya son, but you're gonna need a crash course in all things supernatural. It ain't like in the movies. There's shit out there that goes bump in the night and you're gonna have to be prepared when it does."
Dean slowly started walking towards the pool house. There was no movement from inside as he peered into one of the cracked glass windows. The dead raccoon hadn't moved
“You already have!” the witch screamed. Thunder rumbled in the sky and the ground shook harder. A crack formed at her feet and crept towards Dean. He flapped hard against the wind and rain and lifted into the sky.
Dean watched as the slick shirt moved with the towel. For the second time in five minutes he was sure he saw something under the mans shirt.
"Fucking hell," Dean hissed. "There a blanket or s-somethin' in here?" His eyes cracked open and looked around the cabin. He spotted a fire place against the back wall and relief rushed through his chest. "See any wood in here? C-could get a fire goin'."
Dean raised an eyebrow and picked up his beer as he watched his brother stand. He unbuttoned his shirt and peeled back the cloth, revealing four long blue streaks on his forearm.
“No! I’m not going to stay here just so you can treat me like I’m some—some
"As in amorous," Bobby murmured.
He pulled out his phone and opened his texts, scrolling to his and Castiels' last conversation. He quickly added the mans name to his contacts and typed out a message.
"I hope to hear from you very soon," Castiel said in the same deep voice as before.
Castiel pulled away then, watching Deans chest rapidly rise and fall. He was panting himself, trying to regain his composure. Dean looked over the angels shoulder to see a short blonde man standing there with his arms crossed and smiling.
“None taken,” Sam said shaking his head. “That’s—that’s really impressive. What else can you do?”
“Do you need a knife? I can—”
The kitchen was large with an island in the middle. The blue cabinets matched Castiel's eyes as did the curtains on the bay window.
Dean is in a haze. His brain is trying to make sense of what his eyes are seeing, but it can't. Because what he
Dean huffs through his nose and takes the mug. “Thank you, Cas. S’really nice of you, but you didn’t have to do—”
“I uh,” he held up the packages, “hope you don’t mind. I’m really hungry.” He walked around Castiel and sat on a small stool. “I could feel that,” he murmured as he pulled the string off a package.
Bobby swatted a hand at Dean's shoulder. "Whatever," he mumbled. "When you seein' him?"
The cellar door smashed off the wall, nearly breaking the hinges. Tiny fragments stuck to the brick and tumbled down the stairs, some finding their way under Castiel's dress shoes as he descended.
Castiel froze underneath him, placing his hands carefully on the couch. "Dean, we don't---"
She pops off Gabriel’s mouth and licks her lips as she reaches for the bottle. Sam holds his breath until it lands on his brother. Castiel bites his cheek and grips his cup hard enough that the top cracks.
Castiel ran his tongue over his bottom lip and smiled.
“I mean–yeah. Not at first, but now we can be separated for short periods of time.”
Castiel bit his lip as he watched Dean's face scrunch. "I dunno lady. I hardly have any idea what's going on lately. Just kinda goin' with the flow."
"Nah, Cas. Not a thing," he smiled.
"Cas," Dean called out, his voice shaking.
“Oh Gods, Dean,” Castiel whimpered as he felt the familiars hand sink below the water and graze his cock. His heart raced as his bonding mark flickered to life. Orange sparks shot across his chest and lit up the mark as he panted.
” He motioned towards the potion on the table.
Castiel’s eyes widened as he watched her rise to her feet. The sound of the storm was deafening now and he couldn’t hear Dean anymore. His arms fell to his side as he cried out in frustration.
Castiel released Dean's cock and spun him around, pressing him face down on the table. He spread Dean's cheeks and slicked his hole with his own come, fingers roughly massaging around the muscle. He gave no warning before shoving the tip of his cock inside, making Dean gasp. He ran his hand down Dean's back, nails leaving red streaks behind. He grinned to himself as he watched his cock press fully inside before setting a quick pace.
He took gulping breaths of stagnant air. "Dean," he croaked.
Dean looks up through his lashes at the angel. “S’ok, man. It happens. Ever heard the term ‘when it rains, it pours’?”
She smiled and took his elbow, linking her arm in his. "So, how long have you known my son?"
"Bobby," Dean corrected.
Dean cleared his throat and began slowly lowering himself to the still wet tiles, ignoring the cold water soaking through his jeans. Now at eye level and much closer, Dean could make out the stubble on his face and the iridescent shine on his skin where the sun shone through the broken glass ceiling.
“Do you know anything about kinbaku?” Castiel asked with an amused smile.
“I uh—so, what do we do now?” Castiel tilted his head, looking Dean in the eye.
There are wrought iron chairs scattered around the sides of the pool that are covered in grime and rust. A deflated beach ball lays lifeless next to what Dean is positive is the carcass of a raccoon. And the pool, if it can even be classified as one, is filled to the brim with inky black water. There's leaves and scum collected around the edges and the
Images started flickering in his mind. Visions of his siblings running through the castle, watching as Gabriel successfully brewed his first potion, his mothers face creased with worry as she watched Castiel fail over and over and over again. His fathers disappointed looks. Michael’s laughter as he pushed him to the ground.
Since you've all been so damn patient with me and my chaotic uploading schedule- Surprise!! HERE'S ANOTHER CHAPTER!!
And what was—
His head was swimming with Dean’s prayer as he climbed into his car.
“You can’t win,” he angel growled. “Go home! This isn’t your fight!”
Dean frowned. “Cas, it didn’t sound like she wanted to talk.” He grabbed the witch by his arm and stopped him. “I’m worried,” he admitted.
"So tell me Eileen, where did you learn these fascinating spells of yours?"
she thought.
Dean shook his head. There’s absolutely no reason he should be this angry at Cas.
Balthazar looked Dean up and down while still holding Deans hand. "My God, Cassie, he's marvelous. Where on Earth did you find him?"
Dean took the rose and sniffed it deeply. “You’re a natural, Cas.”
Michelle chewed her lips and sighed.
Sam stiffened and turned around slowly.
The fire popped loudly, making the men jump. Dean chuckled and turned his attention back to stirring the pot. “Our brothers seem to think you were able to make it because I was here, not to mention I was feeling sick.” He tapped the spoon on the side of the pot and laid it down, his eyebrows pulling together. “How did you know I was afraid of flying?” he asked in a quiet voice.
"Everything ok," Dean asked, tapping on the folder.
Zachariah puckered his face. "Mm, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Let's just say," he sat back in his chair and rocked lightly, steepling his fingers, "someone is willing to pay our company handsomely to make it stop."
“No, it’s not.” Castiel stepped towards Dean. “You’re my friend---my best friend---and I never want to hurt you or make you think I’m not grateful that you’re here.”
"Yes, Thursday. No, no I already told him I needed it
ago! Do you know how hard it is to get a decent decorator in hell?"
“Journal.”
Dean bit the inside of his cheek and glanced across the ice to see Castiel helping a little boy onto the ice. "If I can be frank, ma'am--"
"N--no."
Foamy bubbles surrounded Dean’s waist as he sunk the sponge lower. Wiping over his bonding mark and down his stomach, he watched as Castiel’s breathing hitched and pinched his eyes shut. He smiled to himself when he felt the mark tingle.
Dean smirked and suppressed a laugh.
“We—,” Deans heartbeat was rapidly increasing, “we do the job, Cas.” Dean took his shot of whiskey and slid it down on the bar, grabbed his beer and nodded for Castiel to follow him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"And we have to share a bed," he confessed as he sat down on it.
“I don’t pity you, Dean.” He walked forward until he was a few feet away from his familiar. “Of course I feel sorrow for your mother, I cannot fathom a witch being so selfish. I’m just sorry you had to go through it alone. You were so young, it couldn’t have been easy raising your brother.”
"I've provided you with utensils, Dean," Castiel chided. Dean replied with a smile, his cheeks sticking out like a chipmunk.
His brother texted him daily with listings in the local papers of places to rent or houses that were ready to be lived in. He'd add stupid little thumbs up emojis next to properties circled in red ink.
"OhmyGodCastielyouhavetotellmeeverything----" Charlie rambled on without taking a breath as Castiel pressed the END button. His phone immediately vibrated.
“I was unconscious, you fool! I didn’t know what I was saying! You should’ve killed the asshole and his idiot brother and took me home!”
“NO!” Castiel shouted and held out his hand. The ground under their feet trembled and the dried herbs hanging from the ceiling shook hard enough to rain down pieces into the men’s hair. Flox, Pital, and Balder huddled close together and whispered comforts to each other.
The tall doors exploded and shattered into thousands of pieces. Castiel walked in briskly, covered in blood from head to toe. It dripped from his lips and angel blade, leaving a trail up to Dean's cage. He pointed his blade at the bottom of the cage where Eileen had drawn the sigils. With a flick of his wrist, he scratched them off one by one.
“Bones ache,” Castiel finished with a deep sigh.
“I think I’m gonna go,” Gabriel hooked a thumb towards the door. “I’ve been away from Lucy for longer than usual, and not to compare situations here, but–” he rubbed his shoulder with a frown.
I've been having a very hard time coming up with the next part of this story. If you didn't know, I don't have a rough draft or outline for stories I write, they just kind of come to me in dreams and it goes wherever the story leads.
he thought to Sam.
Castiel chuckled,
“But—” Dean put on his best mean face “I’m a man! I can do wha’ever I want!”
“Fuck—Gabe,” Sam panted.
“Hi?” Gabriel said with his eyebrows raised.
Dean felt a shiver slink down his spine as Cas reached up and wiped away the fog on the mirror. He watched as his muscles stretched under his tan skin and remembered he was supposed to be doing something.
Sam glanced to Castiel who slowly rose from his chair. A smile flicked across his mouth before returning his gaze to Rowena. "Something--or someone--tipped them off. They were waiting at Bobby's when we got back."
"Want me get your back?" Dean asked, almost sweetly.
“Spin it, hot lips,” she grins.
He whistled under his breath and looked Castiel up and down.
"Olivette." Castiel spit the name like a curse word.
Dean set his cup down a little harder than necessary and stood behind Castiel, resting his hands on his tense shoulders. "He came because he was and is my best friend and wanted to support me. Something I'm sure he didn't get much of from you."
Naomi came to a stop and turned towards Dean. "Castiel's and my relationship was never very good. Not fully developed. And I suppose that's my fault. I wasn't there for him and when I did see him, he was always so angry." She shook her head and sighed. "Dean I love my son very much and I only want the best for him."
Gabriel raised an eyebrow. “What was what?”
Gabriel scoffed and threw a hand in the air. “If I had a silver piece for every time someone tried to kill me….” he trailed off and looked up, tapping his chin. “Gods, I’d be rich,” he whispered.
They stared at each other for a long minute until Dean gave in. He rolled his eyes and forced a laugh. “Come on man, it’s gettin’ cold.”
Dean looked down at their hands then back to the road with a smirk. "Anything for you, sweetheart."
He let his knuckles brush against Castiel's while the priest said his kind words, offering the slightest bit of comfort without making either of them look weak in case prying eyes were watching. Dean swallowed hard as he placed a single white rose on his friends coffin.
Dean nodded and flipped his phone over in his hand. "Alright," he whispered.
A second later, the door popped open and Naomi smiled at Dean, handing him his jacket.
"Rowena, Crowley. Get him to the dungeon. Tie him down with everything you've got. Carve sigils into his skin if you have to. Anything. Just--"
"What?" Dean gasped, barely above a whisper. He stalked over to the trembling witch and dropped to his knees. He gripped the back of her head and yanked, tipping her face up. "What did you call him?" he asked, rage wracking through his body. His grip tightened in her hair making her gasp.
"Well I may not be great at skating, but I sure as hell can throw a ball," Dean pointed to Gabriel and lowered his head. "Better watch out."
“Fine selection of goods today,” he merchant said from behind the booth, gesturing towards his items.
"What did you see?" Bobby asked quietly.
Sam ran his thumb over the angels lips and smirked. He leaned in and kissed Gabriel, sucking his bottom lip and licking away the chocolate.
Ellen leaned over the table and poked a finger into the table as she glared at Dean. "You stay the hell away from that pool house, y'hear? Don't go sniffin' around places you don't belong."
Gabriel laughed. The pain in his ribs made it come out more of a whine than a laugh.
"And I love you, Dean," Castiel said before closing the distance and kissing the smile off Dean's mouth. His hand wrapped around Dean's thickening cock and began to pump slowly.
He waited a few minutes for a response. Ten minutes went by agonizingly slow before his phone chimed.
Dean cleared the lump in his throat and stared ahead, watching the redhead twirl a spoon in her mug. "There a point to this?" he asked gruffly.
"Rise 'n shine, angel," Dean purred, his lips tracing along Castiel's earlobe.
They laid there for a while panting and smiling shyly at each other.
The First Blade had a remarkable effect on Dean.
"Don't you think I know that, Sam? Don't you think I want the real Dean back? Being with him like this, it's---" he ran a hand roughly down his face, "it's better than not having him at all."
While you were still sleeping. Some of us get up at a decent hour.” Castiel looked down where Dean’s hand was still on his shirt ignoring the skip in his heartbeat. “You said you were ordering pizza?”
He hesitated before reaching for the door. Surely Dean was going to stop him.
Castiel whipped around. "What are you doing?"
“Dean,” Gabriel sighed as he rolled his eyes, “down and we can talk more comfortably?” He tipped his chin towards the altar and nodded.
He reached Kansas in record time.
"Alright, Mrs. Moose, let's here it," Crowley smirked.
Without thinking, he reached up and pulled Gabriel in by the back of his neck. Craning his head, he turned around and kissed the angel. His tongue swept over Gabriels lower lip, causing him to groan.
“Nope, been to busy scamming an idiot,” Dean laughed.
" Dean chuckled darkly. He scooped up a handful of snow and was forming a ball when he was hit in the face with a snowball. "You little shit! Get over here!" he yelled, stumbling his way towards Gabriel.
"You can't feel your tail? Or your fin?"
His breath came in pants and his heart began to race.
"So your men are acting on their own behalf?" Castiel scoffed. "I highly doubt it, unless you employ
Rolling his eyes, Castiel climbed into his car with a smile on his face. Dean waited for his car to pull up and got in, hearing the gates screech closed behind him.
Panic spread throughout his body and up his spine. “I’m sorry, Cas, really. I am. I never meant to–”
"I wanted a chance to explain myself. You were
a bird for seventeen years and you still can’t figure out how to land?”
Also, for my sweet NoRest4Me- I mayyyy have used part of your last comment in this chapter. See if you can find it <3
“Fuck. Hey, Charles. I’m assuming Cas called you?” Dean closed his door carefully and sat on his bed. “It’s not what he thinks. He won’t even listen to me.”
Dean cleared his throat and turned his hand around, pointing at himself. "Dean," he said quietly.
"I dunno," Dean shrugged. "I mean, it's still a lot to take in. It's hard to replace the feelings I had for my dad with new information." He let his hand fall from Cas' hip as he walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. "I guess I'm just glad it was me and not Sam. He's not---he isn't cut out for this." He ran a hand down his face and let it slap against his thigh. A pained look washed over his face as he cocked his head. "Is it," Dean sighed hard and hung his head. "Cas, it feels right. Like this is what I'm supposed to be doing. Is that bad?" He looked up at Castiel who was trying to keep a straight face but failed. He grinned as he walked forward and knelt in front of Dean. He picked up Deans hands and kissed his knuckles before nuzzling into his palm.
"Everything ok?"
“I could rally the guards and soldiers,” Chuck offered.
Dean pulled his eyebrows together and tilted his head as he sat down, facing Castiel. "She a redhead?"
Digging in his pockets, Castiel pulled out a lighter and lit it for her. "Do you mind?" he asked, patting his thigh.
"We received word a week ago that one of our men was secretly meeting with two of yours," she eyed the men across from her. "After further investigation we realized one of our own, Alfie, was conspiring with your men, trading intel for his own profit. We don't take these things lightly." She glanced at Dean. "I suppose we'd all like to know, after decades of peace between the families, why you would give your men such an order."
“We’re outta ice, Cas. Run to the cafeteria and get some?” Meg flipped her black hair over her shoulder and smiled. “Please?”
Castiel lifted the other mans chin so they were eye level. "No, never actually." He slid his finger off the tip of Deans chin and reached for his glass, never breaking eye contact. "I have a vested interest in you, Dean. You make me---," he shook his head with a grin before swallowing the rest of his drink. He cleared his throat and stood up, pulling out his wallet.
"Uh---hi," Dean managed to say.
Gabriel squeezed Sams waist before he rounded the man and lifted himself up on the counter. “If you had a sweet tooth you could’a just came to me. You know I got the hookup,” he winked.
“Oh! Um, I can–” the witch hooked his thumb over his shoulder. “I’ll just—” he turned around to give Dean some semblance of privacy. He peeled his own shirt off and tossed it on the couch. He heard fabric rustling behind him and a soft thump as Dean’s pants hit the dirt. His heart beat quickened as he gripped his own shirt tightly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gabriels’ mouth fell open, spit dripping off his lower lip. He let his tongue slide beneath Sams’ cock, letting it slide over the mans balls.
Lisa clapped her hands together and bounced in place. "Congratulations! I know you're going to turn this place around, Dean."
tears in his eyes. He cleared his throat and glanced around the table. "So, what's the plan?"
Sam shook his head. "We don't know where they took her. One minute we were walking up the steps to Bobby's place and the next they were just---" Sam held his hands up in front of him, "
"Sam?" He watched his brother turn with a smile and walk over to him, wrapping him in a hug with his stupid long arms and shaggy hair. "What the hell are you doin' here man?" he asked in a daze as he gripped his brothers shoulder.
"I don't need the world to tell me who I'm supposed to be with." He glanced at Cas before looking back to his hands, his mouth forming a small frown. "I get it if you don't wanna date someone who's so against what everyone else is dying to find." He rubbed the back of his neck and sighed. "I think you're just wastin' your time on me, Cas."
“If they hurt Dean I’ll rip their lungs out,” Sam growled as he swatted vines out of his way.
Dean set his bottle down on the table with a clunk and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. His chest was heaving as he tried to catch his breath.
Sam tsked and smiled. “See, now you’re smarter than your friend here,” he nodded to the ground where the still bleeding demon was laying, it’s intestines sprawling across the floor. “At least you had the sense to try and get away. Too bad it didn’t fuckin’ work though, huh?”
"What the fuck?!" He immediately sunk to his knees, ignoring the water drenching his sweatpants and held the sides of Castiel's face carefully. A smile spread across the creatures face and he looked almost shy before another gargle filled the room.
He watched as Castiel seemed to contemplate his offer, looking around the pool at the leaves and gunk that had built up over the years. With a smile, Castiel nodded his head. "Really? Oh man, Cas, you're gonna love it." Dean stood and walked over to the pump and kicked it into the water. "Wait." Dean turned and faced Castiel with a worried look. "Can you survive without bein' in water for a while? I don't---I have no idea how that works. The pool will be empty for a while before I can fill it."
“Too close to people in his charge.”
Rowena and Crowley come up empty handed.
"Hey, Cas," Dean purred.
Running a hand roughly through his hair, he groaned and walked back into the hut.
Dean rolled his eyes and let his hands fall to the witch’s hips. “Even if it wasn’t for the bond I don’t think I could stay away from you. But if you aren’t comfortable with the touching or the—y’know, other stuff yet, just say the word and I’ll back off.”
Alfie slowly turned his head to Dean, eyes bloodshot and watery. "Fuck. You."
“Then this guy in a stupid trench coat burst through a friggen barn in the middle of the night and changed everything.”
“And you,” she looked down to Dean. “I suppose I should spare you for freeing me. Come with me. Leave this pathetic excuse of a witch and I’ll give you a life worth being proud of.”
Dean swooped down next to his witch and felt a strong pain ripple through his body.
“Not that it’s any of your business,” Dean squared his shoulders, “but my brother is deaf. The amount of help that’s out there for kids like him is minimal.”
“How ‘bout this, whenever we go on a hunt, I’ll bring you back a doggy bag. Whatd’ya like? Demons. Vamps?” He wiggled his fingers through the cage, feeling the hell hound happily lick at them. “Oooh, what about a nice, juicy ghoul?”
"It's just Alistair and Dean."
Dean gaped at her. “I won’t. I swear. I–I won’t even touch him. I mean, I’m not even—ga–I’m not. I’m–”
Castiel panted into Deans shoulder before rolling to the side, the orange haze slowly dissipating around them. Dean rolled his head to the side and smiled. "That was incredible."
“I can’t!” Castiel shouted. “I’m not—” more lightning cracked over head but never touched down, “I’m not strong enough!”
Bobby arrived a while later and got the short version of the story. With his hands on his hips and his lips pursed, all he had to say was "Great. Can we plan the weddin' after we get my wife back?"
“You don’t understand, son. She scared off or killed any teacher we brought in. You remember Sir Crowley of Near Garden, the most powerful witch in the state? He’s buried in the woods behind the castle.” Chuck shook his head and sat in a chair next to the table. “She was too powerful and unwilling to reign in her powers. Your mother and I did what we had to do. For everyone’s safety.”
is coming this year." He felt Charlie squeeze him tight before snaking a hand into the counter and stealing a donut hole.
"It's done."
"Hello, Dean."
Castiel glared at Dean, holding back a shiver as he stepped into his personal space. “Nothing’s up my ass Dean,” he growled.
He tossed and turned for hours. His skin felt like it was crawling. He hadn't been away from Dean for any amount of time in a while and it was unnerving. He could hear Dean yelling and growling from the dungeon which just added to his problems.
“Jesus, Cas. Can you be any louder?” Dean scratched his bare chest and opened a cupboard to retrieve a mug.
Sam stopped breathing.
“Dean,” Castiel said quietly, “I would never mistreat you. I’d be honored if you were my familiar. I’ve been waiting so long—”
Dean chuckled and pulled at Cas' shirt, lifting it over his head and tossing it aside. "I told them under so circumstances to knock on that door." He kissed down Cas' chest and over their bonding mark that was beginning to glow. It tingled his lips and sent a streak of power through his skin. "Cas," he whispered as he tugged at the witch's pants.
“What the hell?” Dean whispered.
"Cas, after everything Dean's done--"
Dean raised his middle finger at Gabe as he pushed out of his seat. He drained the last of his drink and patted Castiel on the shoulder. "I'll let you two uh---yeah, y'know. Bye."
It was pretty obvious to anyone with eyeballs that Dean had a thing for his roommate, except for Castiel apparently. The first month they lived together, Dean pulled out his best one liners and was his usual flirty self. It all seemed to go right over Castiel’s head which led Dean to the sad conclusion: He’s just not that into you. Not like that stopped him from trying now and then, but he decided to just be friends with him and head to the internet for some no strings attached fun.
“Listen here,” he growled, pointing at the cage, “It’s 3 am and I need to fucking sleep. If you don’t shut the hell up I’m gonna grab the Colt and—”
"To keep an eye on them obviously," Crowley rolled his eyes. "Sam, Dean is gone on Castiel. One thousand percent smitten. You know this."
Dean looked into Cas' worried eyes and smiled. He reached out and pulled his friend in close before kissing him sweetly. Castiel sighed into the kiss and reached up to hold the side of Deans neck. Pulling away, Dean kissed the tip of Cas' nose. "It was great. I told you, parents love me," he shrugged.
Castiel licked his lips and Dean noticed the hint of purple on his tongue. “I would assume so. When Gabriel found Lucy he immediately let her in the castle and they shared everything. Not that–” he held up his hands, “I don’t expect you to give up your life outside of this. Just—if you need or want anything I can and will supply you with it.”
"Like I said, he doesn't have a lot of time. Why don't you come save your boy toy and we can talk."
Castiel visibly flinched and looked at the ground. Sam put his hand on Castiels’ shoulder gently. “The Novaks are one of the first families, Dean. Their bloodline is pure.”
Dean walked over and tapped his foot on the burn mark and Castiel chuckled, running a hand through his still damp hair. “Plus, I don’t think other kids read this much.”
In one fluid motion Castiel sliced through Dean's short, leaving them to sink into the crystal clear water. "Vividly."
Thank you for sticking with me, those who have. You have no idea what it means to me.
"You never cease to amaze me Dean," he growled.
Dean reached up, gripping and turning Castiel's frozen figure towards his line of sight.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel sighed and leaned forward. "Dean doesn't know what I do for a living and I'd like to keep it that way for as long as possible. Also," he pointed a finger at her that was holding his cigarette, "we know how this turned out last time you asked me to remove a guest from one of your parties."
The witch smiled and thought back
"No," Sam answered quietly as he stepped into the room. "Absolutely not, Castiel. This isn't your fault by any means." He knelt down next to his brother and shook his head. "Bobby and Ellen, me and Dean---we care about you. We'd never blame you for what those witches are doing. Bobby told us you were a hunter, yeah? The way I see it, you were doing something good for this world. You were protecting people, now it's our turn to protect you."
"Fuck Cas," Dean groaned, resting his head against Castiel's shoulder. He hissed when he felt a hand grip his cock and pump it tightly.
Dean clicked his tongue as he walked forward. He set the sharp tip of the ice pick at the base of Alfie's cuticle on his middle finger. He tried squirming away but the cable ties held him in place. Dean looked into the mans eyes as he applied pressure there, watching his nail turn from pink to white. He raised his eyebrows questioningly to Alfie. He tipped his head back and spit in Dean's face.
"You stupid soldiers," he spat. "You don't know what it's like. Runners make
“We did. Amara I’m sorry. I had no idea what father—”
"It means she's the head of the mafia in this state," Castiel clarified. He eyed Dean's trembling hands and removed the cigarette from between his fingers. "She hands out orders, and people like me make sure they're taken care of."
"I know. I wanted to," she smiled.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh, Clarence. You know you love me,” a voice cooed. “Heya, Dean-o. How’s it hangin’?”
“Don’t you dare,” she hissed. “Don’t touch him.”
“What dream?” Dean asks as he innocently. “Ohhh, that’s right.” He points his beer bottle at Cas and lowers his head, staring at Cas through his lashes. “The one where you were gettin’ your dick suck—”
Castiels hand slid down Deans chest to his groin. "Seems as though you miss me, as well," he smirked, feeling the bulge in Deans pants.
"Come on!" Dean yelled, balling his fists. "Fight back!" Tears pricked his eyes and threatened to spill over.
ask to stay with a witch.”
Rowena nodded once. "Fergus, where exactly in hell did you keep Dean?"
“You better not try to bite Flox again.”
Castiel shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck nervously. “I don’t know. If I think of something I can just do it?”
are you doing in here?”
Castiel hissed as his feet touched the frozen wood floor, walking quickly over to the bed. Dean scooted back towards the wall and lifted the blanket slightly and popped an eye open. "Get in. Can't sleep with the sound of your teeth chatterin' over there."
his boots?" He stomped in place with his arms out to the side as he mimicked Dean.
"So I'd be your sugar baby," Dean raised an eyebrow at the man next to him.
"Yeah. An' I know we haven't known each other for that long, but fuck, Cas I---"
Bobby grunts and nods. "How you plan on gettin' it back there? Sheets'a wood ain't gonna fit in that pretty car of yours."
Dean sighed and rubbed a hand across the back of his neck. “It’s just—it’s tradition, Cas. You got anything you wanna start doin’?”
He lowered himself into a clearing by the river and glided towards a shabby looking structure. He felt a pull in his chest and landed on the dewy grass. He hopped forward and felt brittle grass and stones under his feet. There was a large circle around the fort where the grass and foliage was dead and dry.
Dean vaguely remembers Castiel frantically pulling out his phone and calling someone as he laid on the porch, watching Michelle's body burn to ashes in front of him. He climbed to his hands and knees, tears springing from his eyes as he watched the fire shoot into the night sky.
“What,” Dean choked on his beer. “N-no he didn’t,” he sputtered.
They walked to the front door and kissed goodbye in front of the marble statue.
Cas raised his hands in defense and stood up. He stayed there for a moment before rapping his knuckles on the table gently. When Dean looked up, he watched as Cas signed “See you later, roomie” before walking towards the exit.
Sam nodded his head.
He feels Dean smile against his mouth before he hears a soft click coming from the door.
"Call when you have a meeting set up?...yes, ok. Goodbye, Michelle."
“I’m starting to,” the witch hissed. “Why didn’t you help her? Teach her to control her powers, not lock her away in a cell!” His eyes flared with orange and Dean felt a river of fear and hatred run through his mark.
Charlie hopped over the back of the couch and grabbed her bag. “Of course, my Lord,” she bowed deeply. “To the dining room table! There are Hobgoblins afoot!”
The crow cawed loudly and shook Dean out of his stupor. He tore his eyes away from the pool and stared wide eyed at the bird.
"That reminds me," Dean mumbled around a mouthful of food. He pulled out his wallet and took out a folded piece of paper.
Sam rolled his eyes and shook his head. “Whatever, man. Night.”
"To keep an eye on both of them, I offered your brother a bit of let's say, undeveloped real estate."
, Dean realized. He opened his eyes and looked at his friend. His mouth was parted, lips slick from licking them. Without thinking, Dean leaned in and brushed his nose against Castiel's. He felt his friend's hand come to rest on the back of his neck and pull him forward the small space that was left between them and press his lips against his own.
Dean turned to the witch. “So, what? No back up? We just go in half cocked and see what happens?”
Dean’s eyes shot to his door, chucking the phone on the bed before running across the apartment. He banged on Cas’ door in a panic.
"Can it, Ken Doll. You moped around this place like a grieving widow for an entire week."
She sighed, her eyebrows pulling together. "I just want you to be happy, baby. It kills me seein' you so sad all the time." She ran her thumb over his cheek and frowned.
When it's laundry day and he pops in his earbuds, blasting AC/DC while secretly dancing around in his room.
“You have no idea,” Castiel muttered. “Please Dean, I’m not in the mood.”
in the pool house.
Rowena rolled her eyes and patted the table. "Sit down, loves. Let Auntie Rowena tell you a story."
Dean froze. "Uh--yeah. It's---it's good. Pickin' up extra shifts at the bar. Gabriel is still an ass, don't think that's ever gonna change. But uh, yeah. All's good there."
"I suggest you ask them yourself, Castiel," Dick motioned towards the men next to him.
Chuck hung his head and shrugged.
Things are getting better. Dealing with human emotions isn’t as easy as I thought it would be. I like the feeling after I eat toast with honey, but I do NOT like jealousy. Sam explained it to me after @@@@@@”
Castiel turned to Dean with wide eyes and a powerful feeling of sorrow pulsed between them. “I am so,
Dean clamped a hand over his friends mouth. “Charles! Shut. Up.” He watched her mimic a zipper across the back of his hand and nod. He let his hand slap against his leg as it dropped from her mouth. “No,” he hissed. “I didn’t tell him how I feel because he obviously doesn’t feel the same way. I’m not losing my friend over a stupid crush.”
"And sleep with me," Castiel said bluntly. "Whenever I desire."
"Oh, god, Dean," Castiel moaned as Dean took him deeper in his mouth. He sucked him gently at first, letting Castiel get used to the feeling before he hollowed his cheeks and let his fingers drift down his thighs. "I'm not--I can't last--" Castiel's thighs flexed around Dean. Dean's hand drifted down to cup Cas' balls and thumb over his hole lightly. "Fuck," Castiel hissed, "oh god, oh f-fuck!" he shouted as he came, watching as Dean swallowed around him. He panted hard as he fell back on to his pillow. Dean continued licking and sucking until Castiel pulled at his shoulders.
“What’s cookin’ good lookin’?”
"Alright," Castiel nodded, "then I don't see a problem here. It may take me some time to keep my hands under control, but I promise, I won't touch you until you ask me to."
The woman wiped her hands on her apron and quickly walked over, taking Dean by the arm. “He’ll be in his chambers, I can take you,” she smiled.
Dean huffed through his nose, disturbing the dust on the mantle. "Yeah," he grumbled. "Yeah ok, Sammy. I get it."
“I’m so fucking sorry, Cas.” Dean gripped the angels trench coat and pulled him roughly into a hug.
~~~~~~~******~~~~~~~~********~~~~~~~~~*********~~~~~~~~~
But he didn’t.
Dean tilted his head. "It's ok. You can make it up to me," he whispered, lightly brushing his lips against his friends. Castiel reached up and ran his fingers through Dean's soaking wet hair and pulled him in close. He parted his lips and let his tongue slide across Dean's lower lip and gasped when he felt Dean starting to plump in his pants.
"So, I'm assuming you have questions," he said while picking up his beer.
College, in Dean’s mind, was a time to hunker down and get ready for the real world.
Dean did as he was told, squirming on his sheets as he grazed the sensitive spot inside him. He held the phone below his waist and recorded a video of him fingering himself before sending it.
Eileen started towards the hallway but a soft hand on her wrist stopped her.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Why are you here?” Dean sat down on his bed and stared at his roommate.
"Dean, you know Castiel loves you," Sam rested his hand on his brothers shoulder. "Is it
Sam pressed 'END' and scrolled through his contact list, double checking anyone he may have overlooked. His finger stopped suddenly on one of the names.
Thirdly, it took much longer than anticipated to get this chapter finished and edited because I had food poisoning and my body was like "MMMmmmno. Not today. Or tomorrow. Maybe the next day but probably not." I'm still shaky and my lips are tingling because I DON'T KNOW WHY but here we are.
subtle though, Dean. To everyone else. To normal people."
The creatures eyes narrowed into tiny slits. A black and green fist raised out of the water near its head, slowly spreading long fingers mimicking Dean's gesture.
Castiel squeezed Dean's hand. "I have to agree."
“See what I mean? Gross,” Gabriel huffed into his mug.
chuckled and shook his head. “I’m sure he’s fine, but he did leave me with his meat stick, so who knows.”
Bobby huffed through his nose as he shoveled a forkful of eggs into his mouth. "I think it's best you see for yourself when you get home."
"Sorry we talked your ear off tonight," Dean said as he wrapped his arms around Cas' waist. "It's just kinda cool getting to know---"
He looked over to Michelle. "Who was she? Why's it such a big deal that she talked to me? I mean, I get hit on all the time, not like she needed to be shot in the fuckin' head for it."
“I don’t—” he yelled out in pain. “Gabriel it hurts so bad. It feels like I’m being ripped in half,” he gasped.
His heart pounded in his chest as he waited for a reply. He wiped a hand over his mouth and jiggled his foot on the floor board.
"Cas!" Charlie playfully hit the man in the shoulder. "You didn't tell me Dean was going with you! How did that happen? When did it happen? Who asked--" " She stopped in her tracks when the office door closed in her face. "Oh no, uh-uh," she said loudly, jiggling the door knob. "Castiel Novak you get out here and tell me or I'm gonna go across the street and ask Dean." She heard Castiel sigh as the door pushed open.
Dean held his breath.
“Ok,” it breathed in relief, nodding it’s head. “We saw him up river just a few hours ago. We were headed that way when—,” it looked over to see Benny wiping his mouth, stalking towards them. “He can’t be far. He’s weak, he didn’t even care that we were following him. He looked like—like he wanted to get caugh—”
"Lets go sit in the living room. I've been told my couch is very comfortable," he smiled.
Castiel nodded. “I did for a while. Seems as though your prayer broke through whatever was blocking my powers.”
Sam stared at the angel in complete disbelief. "Y-yeah. Ok, Cas. Sorry. Um, I was just coming in here to get some shut eye. I'm pretty exhausted so," he gestured towards the door.
Castiel gripped Dean's hand tight. This was it. His first New Years kiss. And it was happening now. With Dean. He looked to his friend as his heart hammered in his chest. Dean was biting his lower lip.
Dean’s eyes flicked to the witch then down at his feet. “It was Charlie.”
Lucy leaned her head on her witch’s shoulder and sighed. “They are completely and utterly clueless, aren’t they?”
Bobby shook his head and grumbled as he walked away, cursing under his breath.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “So I could be a kept familiar then? Got a ton of gold laying around that no one knows about?” He chuckled and gulped down his drink. He set it on the table and blinked slowly.
Dean ducked his head and blushed, thankful the darkness of the alley hid it. Castiel pulled his hand away and stiffened. "There he is," he whispered as he pulled a gun out of his waistband. Dean looked across the street to and saw a man coming out of a pawn shop. "Stay here," Castiel demanded.
"How could I forget? She wouldn't stop trying to make out with me so we hid in the bathroom for three hours." Turning the shower off, Castiel poked his head out from behind the curtain. "Could you pass me a towel?"
Castiel's eyes were fully black when Dean sunk down slowly. His mouth hung open, dragging in air as he felt Dean fully seat himself on his cock. "Dean," he huffed against the man's chest, thrusting up gently. His talons sunk into Dean's back and growled.
The next morning Dean peeled himself out of bed and padded towards the kitchen in desperate need of coffee. The sound of dishes clattering and water running made his head throb.
If his eyes weren’t wide before, they were now. He swallowed hard and scratched at his beard.
Dean stared down at the witch’s hand and bit the inside of his cheek. A feeling of comfort spread throughout his chest before he shrugged it off. He watched as Castiel removed his hand and frowned.
worrying?” Gabriel scoffed. “You’d think that was when she disemboweled my fucking horse!” Lucy held him gently as tears ran down his face.
“How do you know sign language,” he asked, sitting up and scooting to the edge of his bed.
“Really,” Dean said in a low voice.
Castiel stepped forward and caught Dean as he toppled into his arms.
A full length portrait of Michelle in a bright red dress standing in front of her desk took up almost the entire space between the floor and ceiling. He looked back and forth between her picture and the men's. Dean huffed as it dawned on him. They must have been all the other Capos before her. Which might make the very angry man in Castiel and Michelle's home the
Shakily, Castiel lifted his head and unwillingly pried his mouth open.
"He's very attr--attractive," she added which made Castiel smile.
"Cas no one's---"
I’m starting to suspect he has feelings for me, too. I hope I’m not going crazy. I FEEL like I’m going crazy, but Sam said that’s normal.”
“I will,” he lied.
There was a time Dean couldn't even imagine owning a house. It seemed too far fetched even for him. Sure, Baby was comfortable enough for a few nights in between motels, but she didn't have running water or indoor pluming (when you're pushing forty and single it's kind of a necessity).
Deans eyebrows shoot up as he whips his head around.
“I hope you remembered her tip this time,” Castiel scolded.
The brothers heads whip around to see Castiel standing a few feet behind them.
“’Course he is,” Dean whispered. How could anyone NOT look at Castiel? “K, well, let’s lure it out.”
"I've missed you too, love. But I think your man needs an explanation before he combusts."
“Much better things,” the witch said without thinking. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth. “I mean—”
“Oh come on!” Gabriel shouts. “Can’t I just kiss both of ya?”
The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Men and women walked towards the pair and hung garlands from their necks. Dean turned to Castiel with wide eyes.
bad, you can punch Lucifer in the throat." Dean beamed a smile and pulled away slightly but kept his hand on Cas' neck.
Dean hopped from foot to foot and shook out his hands. “Yeah, definitely. You basically mastered casting and brewing this week, this is the next step.”
Dean's head rolled back sharply before he jerked it forward. Staying conscious was becoming harder. His lap was a sticky pool of blood, his vision was beginning to blur, and he couldn't feel his fingers as he tested the restraints holding his wrists together.
fucking hard to block out what he remembers of Hell, but that's something he just can't do. Can't cut it out with a knife or cover it in salt and incinerate it. His mind conjures up shit that would make a lesser man want to be locked up in a padded room for the rest of his life. He hopes the nightmares are just things he's made up. That he didn't actually use a razor blade to pop off each and every fingernail of a politician. That he didn't carve out a serial killers lung and feed it to him. And that's just the light stuff. The other stuff...he can't bring himself to admit. He just can't. He can barely live with himself as it is.
position.
Sam couldn’t help it. He liked the girl already.
Dean pinched his eyes shut and frowned hard. “Cas, I’m so sorry. It was Amara.”
Licking his lips and cocking an eyebrow, Dean raised his cup and smiled around the lid. "Dunno if you're havin' the right kind of sex then, Lis."
Dean howled, a monstrous growl ripped through his chest as he thrashed in place. "Cas! Stop them!"
He knew. He KNEW that getting involved with Dean was a bad idea. Everyone warned him.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ One Week Later~ ~ ~ ~ ~
A whoosh of wind pulled him from his thoughts.
want to look into it?"
The angel nodded again, dropping his head to look into Dean's eyes.
Castiel sighed and rolled his head from side to side. “Ok. Ok, I can do this.” He stared at the candlestick hard and clenched his fist. “Virtute implere manus, convertat huius candelabri ut autem flos.” He rose his palms up and watched as orange wisps circled his wrists before floating towards the candlestick. It swirled around the silver stick and clung to it as leaves and petals blossomed from it’s stem. The mist dissipated and Castiel gasped as he walked over to the fireplace.
Dean groaned loudly as he stood. His breath came in short, jagged puffs as he gripped the witch’s shoulder.
“My place is not in the castle, Anna. I’m far better off on my own in the hut.”
Gabriel cocked an eyebrow and pointed at Dean. “You think his brother is single because
PART 2 OF 3- Cas POV of Dean praying
"I don't care," he hissed into his cellphone. "Close down it down, gather the rest of the men and get to my house within the hour or you can kiss that pathetic excuse of a bar goodbye." Castiel threw the phone onto a table, the same one he had Dean bent over not even a week ago.
“Told ya,” Ruby whispers quietly to Castiel.
He stood frozen in place, unable to focus on anything other than the bird. His limbs were buzzing with electricity and his head was shrouded in a fog. His mind racing with the words
"Of course," Castiel smiled softly. He reached over and clicked the light off, drenching the room in shadows. The only light was from the moon shining in through the window.
"This is so stupid," he grumbled. He didn’t know if Cas would hear him, or if he even wanted Cas to hear him. To be honest, he didn’t know what to say. Watching Cas climb those noisy, metallic steps and walk out the door was truly the dumbest thing Dean he had ever done, and that’s saying alot.
Sam cocked his head and stared at his brother. "Are you---" he glanced to Castiel and back to Dean. "Tell me you aren't----how do you even---"
"It is now. If I tell you where he is, I need you to keep me out of it. He can't know I told you." For the first time since Sam knew Crowley, he looked scared.
"She would," Castiel raised an eyebrow with a smile. He reached up and caressed Dean's face. "You have a lot to learn in a very short amount of time, Dean. I have to talk to Michelle and convince her to promote you to soldier instead of a ridiculous associate," he spat, "and then our work can begin."
Sam lowered his hand to a metal bowl on the table filled with herbs and bones. With a sharp flick of her wrist, Rowena sliced open Sams palm and held it, letting it drip into the bowl.
"Who told ya that," Dean asked, instantly jealous. He followed Castiel into the living room and sat next to him on the couch.
Dean's arms wrapped tightly around the other man's waist and squeezed.
“Aww, is poor Cas cranky,” Dean asked sarcastically. He stuck his bottom lip out and walked over to his roommate. “Does someone need a hug?”
Dean pulled his hand out of his pocket and clasped Castiels' hand firmly. They were big, calloused, and Dean couldn't stop imagining them wrapped around certain parts of his body.
Dean shrugged and reached out, trailing a finger down Cas' chest. "It just seems unnecessary. He shouldn't die and have some asshole take over the empire he's made. Don't get me wrong," Dean grinned as he looked up at Castiel, "the guy lives up to his name, but he doesn't deserve to be taken out by one of his own."
“A hunt,” Dean dead panned.
"Hey!" Sam shouted, wiping water from his face with a grin. "No wonder you like him, Dean. He's an ass just like you," Sam chuckled and knocked his shoulder against his brothers.
Sam grinned around his mouthful of fruit. "Yes, ma'am." He swallowed and wiped his mouth on a napkin.
“What the fuck is going on?” Dean hissed.
"Rowena and I are going with Bobby to load up on weapons and supplies. She'll know what we need for tonight. You two gonna be alright for an hour or so?" Sam asked, glancing at Castiel as he rinsed Rowena's mug in the sink.
“Sit. Eat.” Sam pointed at the table and pushed a plate in Cas’ direction.
His sentence was cut off by his friends lips crashing into his own.
“Even so,” redhead sneered, “you’ll be dead before he gets here.”
Castiel frowned. "I don't like the idea of going to Heaven. They aren't my 'biggest fans' as you would say."
"I don't see any. There's---," he cleared his throat as he wrapped Dean in the blanket, rubbing his hands over Dean's shoulders. "I have heard that body heat is an adequate way to stay warm in these situations."
Dean relaxed and ran his thumb over the other mans knuckles. "Fine," he snapped. "But tone it down man, I made like five hundred bucks on a good week. He's gonna know somethin's up if you keep sending him that much."
Sam huffed and hung his head. "No. I'm really not. Crowley and Rowena came up empty handed."
“Nice to meet you, Dean,” Castiel grinned, his eyes narrowing. “Can I have my hand back or did you plan on keeping it?”
"'Bout time," he said turning his head. "Oh. Sorry, I thought---"
“I, uh…” Dean flushed red and picked at his nails. “You think the guy you—y’know, might like you back.”
“Yep. Whatcha want?” Dean released Cas’ shirt and stuck his hands in his pockets.
Castiel pressed the bottle to his lips and took a timid sip. He made a face and sat it down on the table. “This tastes—well I don’t know what it tastes like but I don’t like it.”
“Dean! How are you---how do you know,” Castiel stood, staring at Dean with wide eyes. “You’re---”
happens to my brother, I’ll slit your throat while you sleep.” His eyes darkened as he glared at Castiel.
Dean tipped his head back and laughed. "You've gotta be fucking KIDDING me. You worthless piece of shit. I should've killed you the MINUTE I found you," Dean yelled.
"Castiel!" a voice yelled from across the room.
"What's that mean, Fergus," Rowena whispered, her voice shaking.
“I’ll never abandon my men.”
Castiel let his grip slide from Dean's thigh, leaving behind a perfect watery hand print. Sam knelt down next to his brother and reached out his hand with a smile. "It's nice to meet you, Castiel." Castiel frowned as he shook Sam's hand, his eyes darting back and forth between the brothers. "Hey, it's ok, man," Sam reassured, "I uh, I feel kinda responsible for all that," he waved his hand towards the house. "Shouldn't have startled you like that. Sorry for those, too," Sam frowned, pointing at the bruises on Cas' collar bone.
Bobby huffed in his seat and picked his paper back up, shaking it out. "I didn't get a kiss," he mumbled under his breath. Ellen chuckled and leaned over and cupped his cheek, placing their marks together as she kissed him.
"My room," Castiel explained. He pulled off his suit coat and popped the buttons of his shirt. Dean stood there unmoving, taking in his surroundings. He watched as Castiel removed the gun from the back of his pants and laid it on the bedside table. Castiel looked over his shoulder at the statue of a man behind him and sighed.
"And you don't?" Dick asked, cocking an eyebrow.
“We could do that,” the witch nodded. He peeked into the pot and scooped some coffee into a nearby cup and handed it to Dean.
His hand slipped around Castiel's hard cock, feeling bulbous head slide over his palm. A whine escaped Castiel's throat and his grip on Dean's hip tightened painfully.
"What! I'm just trying to get to know your friend here," Lucifer defended.
“Yeah ok,” Dean chuckled. He pulled a blanket off the back of the couch and covered the witch with it.
The alley was quiet as they sat in the car. Dean watched as Castiel stared out the window, eyeing every person who walked past.
~ ~ ~ ~The Next Day~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Castiel's eyes darted back and forth between the two.
Dean's smile, his beautiful green eyes, and the look of utter happiness on his face as they laid in bed together flashed through his head on a loop. Things he would hold onto for the rest of his life and likely never see again. Dean was going to die.
"Yeah? Like I said, there were these weird fuckin' carvings on the sides of the doors, wanted to make sure some kids didn't get in there and completely ruin the place with their damn graffiti. Just what I need is more work. The hell is so special about the pool? Oh, God, did someone die in there, too?" Dean covered his face and groaned into his palms.
"Where are you?" Castiel growled.
“He said no. Now I think you need to leave,” Dean barked. Without thinking, Dean rested a hand on the witch’s shoulder and pushed Castiel behind him.
The groan of a door opening pulled his attention.
“Thank you. It was hard on all of us. I didn’t see mother for a month after she passed. And then—,” he trailed off. He grabbed the bottle and filled his glass again. “Then mother died.”
He frowned, pinching his eyes together, trying to savor the few moments between sleep and being awake. He shoved his arm under the pillow and buried his face into the silk pillow case, sighing as something soft ran up and down his back.
“Happy New Year, Sam,” Castiel smiled, clinking his bottle against Sams. He turned to Dean who was already chugging his drink and watched as it dribbled down his chin.
Castiel opened his mouth just before the blade and Dean's cock were thrust inside, smearing come and blood across his tongue.
Sam looked towards the hut before pinching his eyes closed. “Yeah, it does,” he muttered.
"Thank you Dean. You're looking rather...enticing yourself," he said with a low growl. "I may have to keep an eye on you tonight." He reached over the thresh hold and ran his fingers down Dean's jawline.
Dean looked up at his brother. “You aren’t staying? There’s gotta be at least ten extra rooms here.”
"Shaddap, Chuck," Dean shouted. "You're too drunk to even know what you're lookin' at."
Their friends are jeering and clapping as the door clicks shut, shrouding them in darkness.
Castiel winced; he knew his panicked response at the lunch table when crew members had jokingly asked him whether he had any skills would come back to haunt him. “I can produce a specific pie. That’s about it, but I doubt programming and prototype building is something that would make me useful about the ship, so it was all I could think of...”
Once all the water was gone, the light from the falls intensified until it was almost blinding, bathing Dean and Ysa in white. Dean held her smiling face until he couldn't bear the sight and had to look away or be forced to go sightless for the remainder of his existence.
"Yeah, ha, ha." Dean really shouldn't have done it, but again, the lack of self-perseverance and the smug knowledge that Lucifer wasn't getting out of the Cage any time soon had prompted sarcasm. "Well, we're going now, the portal is closing and all that."
They clean up and order Chinese take out for dinner. Easy fixings and no dishes required. They migrated from the galley to the elegant and antiquarian library. Dean plays one of the old vinyls as mood music, and they munch happily along with their chopsticks. Jack wanders over to the chrome blue telescope at the back of the room, fiddling at it before peeking through.
"I have to get you back to Shehaqim," Charis said.
“Don’t worry, Manny,” Dean reassured him, thumbs tapping the steering wheel. “No one’s gonna catch us stealing a pie.”
"Commander Gabriel," she addressed the archangel. Gabriel gave her an irritated look. Most of the angels in the garrisons learned that Gabriel didn't like the hyper-militarized structure of Heaven. Gabriel was never one for rank or superiority, and he always hated being reminded of it. "Let me take him to the mortals' heavens. He is mortal, and he has been granted a soul. I can help him build a heaven there. Let me take him to say goodbye to his might-have-beens and his what-ifs. To the children he might have had if he'd persisted, to the story he could have had if he'd lived this life as a mortal."
The transformation from modest trickster to the larger than life presenter happened while he whistled a low tune. Gabriel immediately commanded attention, his presence dominating the room. “Hey, guys, I’m super excited to be here today to introduce you to Polaris Duo!”
Mary smiles, she remembers that John would make her mixtapes at least every month. They had gotten together over the shared love of Beatles, so of course, they had shared music between them as well. Their house had been filled with the strains of guitar, alternative and rock classics.
Dean nods. “Is there a Sanctuary near here for that? This place would be good for it.”
Dean's heaven had created his perfect life-after-hunting scenario: a lake house in the middle of nowhere that combined doing nothing (like fishing) with pseudo-work (like the bunker and a garage—because there was no way in hell he was in Heaven without the Impala). The hunter's heaven was connected through his bedroom closet to his heaven's exact replica of the bunker. Apparently, once a hunter, always a hunter.
Dean hung his head. Obviously, the angel needed more supervision than two recipe cards.  “Do you have a recipe for your goose?”
The next Gabriel-fueled ad turned out to be Gabriel proposing to a girl with a shoe. Castiel certainly did not understand how magic was exactly
By the time they both come up for air, panting for breath and dizzy with exhilaration, Castiel is painfully hard. He surveys his handiwork: heavy-lidded eyes, dark with want, a heaving, glistening chest in the candlelight. Castiel’s eyes trail downward, and he sees Dean’s engorged cock. The Prince is beautiful and vulnerable at the same time.
It breaks the moment, and Castiel busies himself with cleaning the floor and the scissors. Sam has a hand on the back of his neck, rubbing with an almost forced laughter. Dean looks down at his hands, clenched at his knees, his face flushed.
Castiel frowned at Gabriel because they were actually going to something like a Tree of Souls and the archangel wasn't making any sense. Gabriel smacked his palm against his forehead. "I take it you have never watched James Cameron's
"Um…" Dean pauses, thinking back on the order and what he'd asked the magic to create. "To grow? Like a larger thing?"
The butterfly’s speckled sapphire wings perfectly highlighted the blue of Castiel’s eyes.
“Still can’t do anything by half measure, can we?” Balthazar asked as he led Castiel through his room, prepared him a bath. Balthazar’s custom-made bath salts wafted in the air with its unapologetically smoky spice and hints of tobacco.
Castiel accepts Dean’s palm and cradles it between his cheek and his own hand. “I’ve told you before, Prince, and I’ll tell you again. I’ve been a pleasure slave for centuries, and I will do it for centuries more. Though some survive by bringing power and sex games into their bed, I do it by accepting that it feels good and that I have no other options.”
They’ve absurdly ended up sectioning the bunker in half, with two shirts on a pole substituting as flags. The floor is littered with the spent pellets. Dean and Castiel have taken the toilets while Jack and Sam have sequestered the entire kitchen. Jack and Castiel are worse shots than Sam and Dean, but the Nerf gun that Dean acquired has a fast reload, evening out the odds. It works more like a machine gun than pistols.
Chesterford is in the border of the kingdom, situated before the realm of the elves and the fairies. It was a forgotten village until the king arrived to take his dues for taxes to protect them from the bandits and the miscreants. It is for this reason that people are transitory, sometimes to find greener pastures, sometimes lured by the mysteries of the outside. So Dean can't possibly remember everyone that comes and goes. And besides, he was barely old enough to notice anything in those days, the wolf taking up most of his young life.
She dropped her voice to a small whisper, her eyes never leaving the Coopers in front of her. "There's a new virus or bacteria out there threatening our babies—that's why we're getting all of these stillbirths, isn't it?"
"Metatron doesn't bring me to the lower circles," Charis said, looking around, touching the plants and listening to the fauna that occasionally broke through the hedge.
He couldn’t recall what he did after. He knew he hadn’t begged despite wanting to. His mind had blanked after Dean’s accusation. And he’d been so happy when Sam’s number appeared on the NovaWatch before he’d picked up. He’d wanted to have connected with a holo, but Sam’s Atis wasn’t built for that.
had not been easy, it was still home. But Dad was forcing his hand. The fighting chance Mary was providing was a gift he couldn’t refuse.
“No, it won’t be strong enough!” Dean argues as he calls in a ball of clay.
Lucifer licked his lips again. "Interesting."
“It’s our special tradition then, Christmas Eve.” Sam smiled before he got ready to bed.
Castiel peered at the protesting baby and noted the flash of the newborn's soul. Shiny and bright it may be, but it held the tinge of experience. "An old soul."
On one of the rare occasions that all the Winchesters and Castiel are in the bunker, Mary stumbles upon Castiel while he's rummaging in one of the Bunker's old storage rooms, moving about one contraption and the next, squinting at the old machinery. Mary clears her throat, and the angel lifts his head up in acknowledgment but continues to move boxes around.
Manny turned at the sound of his voice. His trenchcoat billowed around him and gave Dean a confused head-tilt. Dean immediately perked up and waved him over.
"Castiel," the man replies.
"So maybe you're in one of mine, huh?" Dean joked humorlessly as he gripped Cas' forearm and heaved him up to a standing position.
“She’s marking her property,” Castiel explains as he rubs the feathers he can reach. “Lucian is visiting.”
“I’m still trying to figure that out. This is the first rebellious thing I’ve ever done,” Castiel admitted haltingly. He shivered, the fire already banked down to low embers, the scents of charred meat long replaced by ash.
him for forgiveness."
"Respectfully, mother, I don't think you see anything at all."
I am getting in this deal so that I can renege. It's sorely tempting," Lucifer threatened before grabbing Dean's wrist and pulling it through the bars.
The woman beside him gasped at the suggestion. “You don’t eat competition pie!”
It came to the point where he didn't even understand what he felt when Cas appeared after a long time away and
Yeah, he already got that part. He didn’t understand why Cas needed to be secretive at all.
There was a long pause before either of them reacted. Lucifer raised an eyebrow in disbelief. "All angels? The malakhim? The orphanim? The dominions? The virtues?"
Which left Sam. It had become increasingly harder to talk to the young Winchester after Dean's death. Sam had always shown that he could live without Dean, that he could walk away from the hunting life and not look back. And Sam, being in Lebanon, forming a new life that was apart from them, it felt too much like abandonment. Castiel could live with Sam leaving him—after all, it had been years since Sam was his ward— but to Castiel, it felt like a betrayal of Dean's memory.
"The ribbon got tangled!" Sam protested in his defense, his face morphed into an indignant scowl, clutching the pizza with his able hand.
Castiel absentmindedly shrugged in his coat. “Am I late?”
"Heart of a nephilim," Dean murmured touching the flower's petals. It was another mnemosyne then.
When the curtain lifted, a short blonde man walked onto the stage. His presence was large despite his small stature, but that wasn’t what drew his attention. No, it was the companion he’d left behind in the wings.
Dean grinned at him. “Really? Thought you said you wouldn’t be able to?”
She gave him a look, which on other people he might have interpreted as: how-are-you-this-dumb? but on her simply seemed puzzled. "Michael and Lucifer's Cage is not made out of material as mundane as iron. Nor is it bound to one place."
When Castiel doesn’t respond, Dean sighs, defeated.
itself that they could not do without. And that was one thing that Heaven could not give, its pockets filled to the brim with old souls. Sometimes, after the souls "let go," something reminded them of their old lives, and that was when they lost the simple joys that Heaven had to offer. They began to yearn for something different—for a
"I am sorry, Kevin."
This made those pale in comparison. Dean kissed like Castiel was his world, and they wouldn’t meet again. He kissed like it was a goodbye and hello all at once. When they parted with small gasps of breath between them, Dean cupped Castiel’s cheeks and rubbed his thumb under his eye. “Hey, why the long face?”
"No, I hate
Manny dipped his head to the side and hummed in thought. “No, but we can ask one of the locals, I guess.”
to service me? Isn’t servicing Lucian and Michaela’s court
"Is the Repository of Souls empty?" Cas shook himself once, then clarified, "Is the Tree still producing the souls that my Father created at the beginning of time?"
image and vice versa. It's why the Cage was made in the first place, so no one
"I am starting to get vexed at the number of times that Dean is brought into the conversation when I am apologizing," Castiel complained, because surely it was not a coincidence that both Sam and Kevin had jabbed that particular wound, "Dean does not make up all of me."
“What do
“Of course, Dean.” He became quieter and then blew out his cheeks before dropping his forehead on Dean’s shoulder. “Please don’t take your anger out on me again,” he mumbled.
—a Jeweled male equal in status to a witch
"You can stay in this room while you recover, 'kay?" Dean said as he leaned back on the headboard, his arm brushing Cas' sleeve. He knew Cas'd been in the bunker several times already, and had actually stayed in this room a couple of times, but there hadn't been an explicit invitation to it. Dean thought that it was important. Because he did ask Cas to leave that one time, so taking it back was important. No matter if it was years late.
Castiel hesitated. “And do you know where you are now?”
“Getting wasted apparently,” Castiel muttered as he picked up another bourbon on the rocks, relishing the burn of the alcohol as he downed it. He was starting to become a little tipsy, but Gabriel wanted him to have fun. Cheers to
“Thank you! Before I leave the stage, I want you all to raise your glasses. They all raised? OK, good.”
It was so easy to get addicted to this.
Dean’s head falls forward to Castiel’s shoulder burying his face on the crook of his neck as he comes with a muffled shout. He clamps around Castiel like a vice, biting a fresh mark on his collar bone with the release—a brand from the Righteous Man. Castiel comes on that thought, on a quiet exhale, heat suffusing his limbs as he fills Dean.
Dean beamed all the way to their next motel, while Sam was playing with his airplane in the backseat. Sometimes his dad would listen to his recording and give him advice on how to improve. “The first rule of mixtapes, son, is
Dean remembered when his brother studied every book that came through the ship, as he mentally prepared himself to go to school in Caelum. He wanted to be a scholar and learn everything, but John told Sam that he had to help with the family business.
Dean strokes her knuckles while she rocks Sam, but her eyes are sightlessly staring into the webs. He washes his hands then goes into the kitchen and pours boiling water to steep his mom’s healing tea. When the sweet earthy aroma emerges up from the cup, he takes it to her. He guides her to her favorite chair before he gives it to her.
“You texted me suggestive text messages. In the middle of a grocery run!” Dean rasps, stealing kisses as he fumbles with Castiel’s buttons.
Dean hadn't expected
“You’re the only one I could turn to without Michael finding me immediately. I’ll finish the lenses there in Los Angeles, build a more streamlined operating system for what we’re using now.”
"Fall?"
Castiel offers Sam an unopened can of beer as he and Dean switch places. Sam fits into the space Dean left, leaning against the table, accepting the offering, and taking a big gulp. He rubs on his chest when he looks around the room.
“Brother,” Michael acknowledged as Raphael neared the bars.
In the background, the sound of a tambourine and an acoustic guitar broke out, shifting from a soft sad piano melody into something more upbeat:
“I’m not missing out much then, where’s the sex, the women, the virgin sacrifices?” Lucifer asked as he peered out towards the angels congregating. With the manner of parties Hell threw, Gabriel was sure that this was bound to be mild in comparison.
. Which was just perfect musically for the last piece. It ended with a church organ that faded into silence that came back a few seconds later.
Telling Nathaniel that Castiel could hear the Song but not resonate with it was pointless. "I can live without Heaven constantly watching what I am doing, Nathaniel. More importantly, having the Song with you has not helped you open Heaven's Gates."
They came together. It was raw and left Dean’s heart ragged. Dean didn’t care to put a name to the fullness in his chest.
Once Dean sifts through the feathers, he finds a fragment of an arrow high up behind the nape, above the wings: a remnant of the bolt Dean had fired. The shaft with the fletching has long since broken off through the griffin's efforts, but it hasn't managed to dislodge the arrowhead. Now Dean understands the long-suffering glares and huffs that the bird was giving him. Dean takes a peek at the griffin, which results in another pitiful whistle.
It’s always easy to forget that Jimmy was tall and lithe. He has a runner’s physique, and he’d kept in shape despite the ill-fitting coat and suit. Castiel had been more than a thousand feet tall in his angelic form, but Sam easily towered over Jimmy. Castiel only thinks about it when he’s forced to move the awkward workings of his true form constrained by his vessel. He
No matter, Terreille has long since been casting its shadow into Askavi, and therefore the Sinai Mountains, our home. If my brother had not locked me here, Dorothea Sadiablo, Terreille’s self-proclaimed High Priestess, would have killed me along with Coven of the Hourglass. In some ways, my brother’s temper tantrum saved me from death.
There was a soft laugh from the man despite the fact that already he was returning into a flame. It reminded Dean of Cas' transition between vessels, from Claire back to Jimmy.
“To another Altar.” Another far-away look as Dean assesses the radial webs the Coaches were using to get them to their destination. “Not long now.”
Castiel had had five years of doing what the family deemed worthy. He was not going to be railroaded into an arranged marriage so that they could control the rest of his life. The moment that Michael’s attention shifted away from him, he left. His knuckles ached, and he realized he’d been clenching his hands into tight fists. He loosed them as he surveyed the containers that were constantly moving at the port. It reminded Castiel of how his father had expanded the Novak Empire.
and had settled down in one of the large beanbag chairs haphazardly strewn around the floor. Dean watched the sky. Usually, the souls returned to them when the sun set and bathed their corner of heaven in eternal night.
"Cas, what have we taught you? Say baby-eating monster instead of brephophagist, okay?" Kevin reminded him. He looked down the list, which was rapidly dwindling in size, before turning his eyes back to the road. "The Pale Man?"
Dean wouldn't have called it baptism, but he let Ash do most of the talking.
Dean stood awkwardly in the middle of the cell with the girl latched on to his legs. She pulled out of the embrace and looked up at him. Those eyes looked ancient. She didn't sound like an angel, but she didn't feel like a soul either, and there were a limited number of other beings that were allowed in Heaven.
Dean met Castiel en route to the Chevrolet and nodded at the car in invitation. Castiel stopped to squint at him, probably to check if he was over the short stint of food poisoning (he was.) Satisfied, he followed Dean and climbed into the front seat while Dean cranked the pilot light to life with his aquacasite.
Dean doesn’t move away. His deep, ragged breaths mingle with Castiel’s. It mixes with the musk of Castiel’s oil, which soaked through the fabric in Dean’s hand. He can smell the herbs on Dean’s skin, the candles, and their psychic scents. The Prince’s lips are parted in involuntary desire, and Castiel is struck with the urge to kiss him.
He tensed up when he noticed someone was sitting on his dock and what the fuck man? He had been assured that people who could actually travel between heavens was a rare trait.
Ash had returned with a paperback copy of
“But—“ Dean decided that arguing about it right now was not going to help matters when ten pies needed baking. The oven seemed to have mended itself during their conversation. “How hot do you need your oven?”
Castiel has learned that though Prince Winchester is most definitely interested, he isn’t going to initiate anything sexual.
Castiel flicked off the leaves and specks of dust he'd accumulated before walking towards the Tree of Life and requesting entry to Vilon. The Tree accommodated his request by dropping Castiel in the middle of the vast expanse that humans had named Heaven and cosmos before they knew there was anything beyond their clouds and their brilliant sun. To angels, this place was simply: the first circle of Heaven, which they used to fly.
"Heaven," Dean finished. Because though he could be slow on the uptake on some things, he was not stupid. The chances that Michael would help him were few, but they had to find the Cage first. And he assumed that it wouldn't be easy.
There was the feeling of his wings unfurling, something that he believed he had forever lost, robbed of his grace and flight when he had been cast aside as mere means to a spell. He closed his eyes just to feel the thrum of grace against his wings, a faint echo that he'd almost forgotten and unfurled the other two sets of wings bestowed upon him after being granted life after death.
Dean knows something about horses, probably would have been a stable hand if he isn’t a Warlord Prince. He is often with them when he isn’t expected anywhere. Today, Alfie is along with him. He’s mucking out the stables with a pitchfork while Dean gives the horses grain.
after Castiel's mode of transport, but the hunter finally relented to flying when he realized that he had no other choice. He and Castiel landed in one of the Treasuries closest to the Throne. Castiel hadn't been in Aravoth since he and Raphael fought each other. Aravoth had been their Father's throne room; it was where all angels were received when their Father deemed them worthy of talking to him. It was the Seat of Judgment for mortals and the place of creation for angels.
are not real wings, they are how your mind infers what in essence is grace and celestial intent built-in and contained into a three-dimensional sphere. Castiel probably showed you shadows of what they were. Had he shown them to you in truth you'd have been blinded. I'm sure your pretty green eyes have been with you up until your sad, untimely death."
"Uh, why have I never heard anything about your people? Kingdoms should've been losing their minds over getting one of you as mages."
"Hey, I'm still here!"
Castiel touched the sigil written around the tree, and Gabriel's wings rustled as the grace he'd used to power the sigil flared. Castiel swiped his blade across his palm and added drops of blood to the ground. He felt the start of the spell and the familiar thrum of grace that echoed while the other angels' eyes were heavy on him. They would not willingly risk an archangel's wrath though, so they had all followed Gabriel's orders and stayed back.
use another Messman if you’re up for it.”
"Like you wouldn't believe," Gabriel groused. "Sooo back to my piece of advice—"
Dean shifted because, before this point in time, he hadn't thought he would have to spell it out for Michael. He had come here thinking that he'd say, "locked out of Heaven," and Michael would know what had happened. He hadn't realized that Michael was not omniscient. "Metatron cast a spell. It kicked everyone out. No one's allowed back in. Lots of death all around in the meteor shower."
“I just need a deposit.” Alfie efficiently handled the cash Dean gave him. He slid the keys forward as he said, “here you go.”
"Look, it doesn't mean that we ain't working together that we
Bobby looked at Castiel from the porch as he stepped out into the yard, his battered cap pulled low over his eyes.
"You know, you're not the only one mourning."
out of his hold.
“There’s a breakfast buffet at the cafe,” Castiel offered, but followed Sam down the stairs. The continental breakfast included in their bill left a lot to be desired. He’d taken a banana from the table and some hard-boiled eggs but missed the salted cod they had back home. Five days from his home town and already he missed the food. It didn’t bode well for the trip.
Dean shakes his head and takes several to tuck under his plate before he reaches for a piece of Castiel’s creation and tastes it thoughtfully. “It ain’t half bad. I kinda expected the peanut butter and jelly to flop.”
“Is it open already?” Dean reached into his pocket and grabbed his old Nova flip phone. He checked the time and blinked. “It’s only ten, Sammy.”
"The Righteous Man travels in a black classic car," Ash said helpfully, putting the book he was reading into one of the carts that held books for re-shelving, accommodatingly placed near the bed where Ysa would have stayed the longest. "We need something that will resonate with the car to travel."
Dean had known that his moment with Castiel would be fleeting, he’d known that the man would leave. They’d made no promises other than time spent together to a destination that they’d both agreed on. Dean had accepted this as his lot in life, because wanting things for himself was useless. He thought he’d sealed the wall to those memories tight.
Ghosts still existed inside the towers because despite the salt circles, ghosts are attached to places where they died or organic material that family members have kept. These are difficult to contain even with the knowledge of the supernatural, and people have died inside the towers, making it easy for ghosts to inhabit.
Castiel watched as Kevin, Sam, and their wives had children and lived. Castiel and Daphne adopted Charis.
Here, Dean didn't even know if it had been hours, days or years. There were no markers that he could rely on at all, not even mealtimes because he didn't need to eat. Not to mention the time velocity conundrum.
Despite Sam’s invitation, Castiel doesn’t want to lose the early morning light for the garden. He declines the dusty books for now and settles on turning the earth.
They ended up walking to a small shop just across from a busy market. A man with a mullet behind a desk surrounded by various pieces of equipment. There were scattered cogs and engine parts everywhere, and the steady chugging of the steam engine provided a sonic background to the cluttered room, various holos projected around the walls.
She stepped out from behind Dean, while Dean eyed Lucifer uncertainly. Lucifer didn't kneel, so Charis was forced to crane her neck to look up at him, blue eyes meeting blue. "We meet again. You were gifted memory, child."
