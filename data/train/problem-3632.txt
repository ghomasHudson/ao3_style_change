Dean scoffs. “I think they’re pretty good where they are,” he says, leaning in for another bite of pie. He catches Cas’ eye and sees a flash of something in them as his lips close around the fork.
Cas unlocks Sam’s door and Dean tumbles over the threshold. He lands on Brady’s bed and feels something starchy beneath him, and when he looks down he sees the tan fabric of a trench coat. He wonders idly if Cas would be willing to repeat the show from earlier.
“Dean’s hungover,” Gabe says, jerking a thumb in his direction. “No sudden movements.”
His phone buzzes and he quickens his pace.
“You’re, like, eight months older than me.”
“What?”
After dealing with a particularly enthusiastic group of vampires, Dean is pleasantly buzzed and has been engaged in debate with Cas for the last half-hour about their most recent movie night.
"It doesn't matter what I think of them. Like you said, classics are classics."
"Yeah, I.. uh. We were talking. I just covered the basics. Sorry." How the hell does an angel know more about humans than he does?
God, yes, Dean does want that, and he nods and bites his lip and bats his fucking eyelashes so that Cas will get the message. Cas cups his jawline with one hand and presses Dean’s mouth open with his thumb, and then slowly leans back in to suck a hickey into the hollow of Dean’s collarbone.
Cas is still fuming as he shrugs off his trench coat and throws it on the bed. “I don’t understand why you treat me like this “ –unzips his pants–“like I am a CHILD” –rips his white button-down out of his waistband, unbuttoning so furiously that Dean fears for the shirt—"when I am a perfectly full-grown and capable adult who can make my own goddamn decisions. You ass… butt.”
Just then, Ellen herself rounds the corner. It’s Dean’s first sighting of his boss since being back on campus – she was out checking mail and getting the campus gossip from her friends in the mailroom when he opened this morning. “Good morning, Dean,” she says in her slight Kansas twang, reaching over to squeeze his forearm. “We’re glad to have you back, and even gladder you were willing to give up your last week of summer for freshman orientation. Jo, you giving an enthusiastic and grateful welcome to my favorite employee who is the only reason you aren’t alone this week?”
He loses track of the girls quickly but spots Gabriel’s light brown hair inside one of the brightly lit dorm rooms. He yells Gabe’s name but it’s too loud, too much going on, Gabe can’t hear him. As he gets closer, he becomes very aware that he is still not drunk enough for this.
Cas solemnly shakes his head. “Lesbians,” he sighs instead. Dean lets out a surprised chuckle.
He keeps his eyes trained on Cas’ back, hand clutched tightly in sweaty hand. His gaze wanders down to where Cas fills out those grey shorts so well, better than Dean ever has. Vaguely, Dean has the thought that Aaron is hot, no question, but he doesn’t have the ass that Cas has. Or the confidence, or the humor, or the stormy ocean blue eyes that Dean wants to fucking drown in.
Actually, speaking of, he should probably text Lisa soon and see if she wants to grab a meal or something. They hadn’t ended on good terms, exactly, but he still thinks that they could make it as friends. Lisa was one of the few people who knew about what she called Dean’s “origin story.” Jo just calls it “trauma.” Dean thinks both make good points.
“Dean, I do not need to change my clothes,” Cas reminded him.
been ok. We’ve always had each other, we’ve always made it through whatever the world, or hell, or heaven, has thrown at us. And we’ll make it through this too,” Cas said, desperately wishing to reassure him.
Dean pouted, “But it will look so cute on you.”
“So it wasn’t a dream, but rather a memory?” Cas questioned.
Sam’s brow furrowed, “Why?”
lay a finger on. So he wasn’t surprised when he walked into the kitchen – at 6:15 a.m., mind you, Dean was always in there early, or late, to avoid the crowd – and found Dean making pancakes. What did surprise, and concern him, however, was Dean’s tense, hunched over posture, and the slight tremor in his voice when he greeted him with a quiet, “Hey Sammy."
Their fear was warranted. Their contempt was not.
Dean sighed, walking toward the warehouse, “I know we are.” Dean paused, looking at Cas, “Listen to me, Michael conned me. Kept trapped and drowning in my own body. Now, when you and Sam were possessed by Lucifer, I-I thought I understood, but I didn’t, not really. So yeah, if we get a chance to trap him, I’ll take that, but I won’t be truly happy until he is dead – and
Castiel had come in after not receiving a response for the second day in a row. He had felt the fluctuations coming from his human – from desperate hopeless pleas to terrifying silence. Cas’s own insecurities had kept him from intruding that first day; but he couldn’t wait anymore.
Dean stood in front of the shower. He had been there so long that he was pretty sure that most of the hot water would be gone. He needed to be clean, to be rid of Michael’s stench, even though deep down he knew that a simple shower couldn’t fix that, yet he couldn’t bring himself to get in the water.
Dean reached up and limply held Cas’s hand. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Dean bit his lip, he didn’t

Dean shook his head, “How can you say that?”
“Ok,” Dean said indignantly.

Now Sam was angry. If everything Cas said was true and more – and he would have no reason to lie, nor was he very good at it – Sam mourned the fact he had stopped Castiel from beating up Philip. “Is this true Philip?”

“And we have been through plenty of those too, and we’re still here. Dean what you’re going through, it’s not unbeatable. Me,
“Yeah, but I should’ve known,” Sam argued. “I mean, why didn’t he come to me?”
Dean shrugged, nestling his head further into Cas stomach.
Dean stared at the empty space where Billy had disappeared. Dropping the death book, he sank down to the ground, leaning against the bed. He held his pounding head in his hands, tears filled his eyes, and he wept.
“Dean, is it… is it really you?”
Dean nodded again, laying back on the bed. Before Cas left he made sure to pocket Dean’s lighter, and then focused on the task ahead: Philip.
want to go into detail about the constant berating voice in his mind, so he tried to put on a brave grin, though he knew it probably wasn’t too believable. “Doesn’t matter. You said you slept? I didn’t know angels could do that.”
The anger slips from Dean’s face and is replaced with pure fear and confusion. “No… I didn’t… I-I don’t…”
“Dean, who was that?”
But Sam just turned around and smiled, as if that was the first time he had greeted Dean that morning, “Hey. Are you okay?”

It had been an accident. He hadn’t meant for it to be addicting. When Philip walked in, he tensed. Philip hated him; he

Dean’s response was so quiet Cas almost missed it. “I don’t want to… do this anymore,” Dean hadn’t spoken in two days and it showed.
Dean took a shaky breath, shifting to hold Cas’s hand. “Yesterday,” he breathed, “we went to find Kaia – dark Kaia,” he clarified, “a-and we needed her spear, to use against Michael,” Dean paused, crying more. “But she – she wouldn’t give it to us, and I just, I got so angry…

was stupid.”
Dean took a shaky breath and nodded in understanding. His attention turned to one of the hunters who had paused uncertainly a few steps away. “Yeah, not Michael anymore.” Dean explained. The hunter smiled, continuing about his business.
His attention shifted to the door of the library. Jack hurried toward him, smiling in amazement. “Hey kid.”
“I know…”
Dean nodded, but instantly regretted it as more pain pierced his skull. He grimaced, “Yeah, its me.”
Cas pursed his lips but quickly it turned into a smile, he was happy to see Dean so comfortable with their relationship. He shook his head amusedly, “Alright. Let’s get it.”
“Morning,” Sam answered, “What’s up?” Another warning flag went up in Sam’s head when his brother took near a minute to respond, and even more flags from the response he received.
Dean was silent. So much time passed, that Cas had given up any hope that he would talk about it. But then came a faint reply, “Philip mostly.”
like nothing happened?”
hurt?” Dean’s eyes closed, keeping in his tears, “that’s on me.” He finished in a whisper. Before his brother could reply, Dean stood, leaving his glass on the table and hurrying out of the kitchen with a soft, “Night, Sammy.”
. I didn’t know if you were alive, I…” Sam took a deep breath, “I just need you to talk to me, to slow down, so I can catch up.”
“Dean, we still have no idea why Michael let you go, or where he is now, or what he wants-”
“Oh,” Cas responded. There was a beat. And then two. Dean was about to break the silence, despite having no words, but Cas beat him to it. “Do you
Dean thought,
But no, the others were right, he was useless, helpless.
“Well, you know how Dean is,” Cas replied, “but – maybe. I believe you should try, and I will encourage him to be honest with you. Just give him some time.”
Many minutes later, his heart had calmed enough and he shifted into a sitting position against the shower wall, pulling the towel closer, doing his best to cover himself with it. Thankfully though, another one was laid over his lap. Dean rested his head on his knees, shame coursing through his veins, causing his once cold skin to heat. Hesitantly, Dean brought his gaze to the man kneeling in front of him, who’s features were sketched with worry.
Cas had stared at him the whole car ride. Not in the normal way either, but rather, like he couldn’t understand Dean. Finally, Dean couldn’t take not knowing anymore, “What? Am I just that beautiful you can’t stop staring?”
the touch. And Dean
“Nothing, just uh, asking where you were.” Dean lied.
Dean nodded, pouring himself a cup of coffee before leaning against the island facing Sam. “Sorry about running out and all that.”
Dean nodded tersely and started forward toward the door. He was surprised and angry at how shaky he felt, how uncoordinated his limbs were. After what felt like forever, they finally made it to the car. Dean paused, and ripped off the overcoat he had been wearing, before stepping into the car, leaving the clothing forgotten in the dirt.
Dean nodded his head, desperate for something to keep him busy and away from the now always crowded bunker. “I’ll get my keys.”
“You don’t have to lie about how you feel Dean.” Cas assured, bringing his hand up to cup Dean’s face. “You don’t need to always be strong for everyone, ok?”
The Feeling. It was back. He had felt it few times before, and always when he was gone. Dean’s soul had been dimmer, darker, recently, but Cas couldn’t expect any less. He had confronted Dean about it, but of course, by the time Cas could reach him, Dean was always ‘fine’, a cocky smile back on his face. Cas cursed the fact he no longer had his wings. If he had been able to reach Dean in the moment, perhaps he could help, perhaps he could understand why his love’s soul felt so hopeless – full of grief and despair and
Cas sighed, moving one of his hands down to rest on the scar. The feeling started up again except this time it was accompanied by the memory of him – Michael – being stabbed, and white, hot pain coursing from his arm. Cas pulled his hands away abruptly, and Dean gasped, as the pain oh so slowly subsided, replaced by a dull ache in his head.
“Anything you need De, just let me know.”
Michael.”
Cas was troubled, how could Dean think that, “You have not disappointed me, you never could. Do you understand? I love you Dean. You are so kind and giving, why would you think you hurt people?”

, Castiel thought,
– with me, he uh, he kept me locked away… underwater.” Dean ran his hand over his face, blinking away tears.
Cas nodded in understanding, moving around to sit next to him. “Do you know… why it happened?” He asked cautiously, not wanting to bring up anything Dean wasn’t ready to talk about.
Taking care to avoid people, even if it meant using roundabout ways, Dean made his way to the library. True to his word, Cas was there, sitting in a plush leather chair in a secluded corner and reading a book. Quietly, Dean walked over and settled down on the floor, resting his head on Cas’s knee.
Warnings: Nightmares and a detailed anxiety attack.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry Cas. Gods all I do is mess-up–”
Cas’s heart ached to know Dean still – and likely always will – blame himself for Michael. But what troubled him more was the ‘others’ part. “Dean, what others? Who is saying such horrible lies about you?”
Admittedly, this ending was hard to write, and ill likely come back someday and edit it. I really hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading, it means the world to me.
“Stop. Stop,” Dean turned back around to face him. “This isn’t your fault Sammy, okay? Please, don’t put this on yourself, there’s already enough blame between the two of us. You don’t need anymore.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but he still couldn’t shake his grin, “Whatever Sammy.”
Dean remained silent. He wasn’t sure if he
wrong. Dean you are the most beautiful, kind human I’ve ever known, and you above all else, deserve happiness. You especially do not deserve any of the pain Philip or Michael or anyone else has put you through. And no matter what, I’ll be here. I will be right by your side every step of the way,” Cas reached for Dean’s hand. “You will make it through this Dean, and we will help you in anything you need.”
“You know, I said yes to him because I thought… it was stupid,
“I already do,” Cas chuckled.
Cas’s face softened. “Sam, you can’t blame yourself for Philip any more than I can.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And Dean, we’re taking a big risk going after the spear like this,” Cas continued.
What looked to be brief panic washed over Dean’s face when he mentioned that time frame.
Dean shook his head, “You can’t mean that…”
Dean pulled out a chair, before rolling up his sleeve, “I don’t know how I got it.”
“Absolutely.” He placed a chaste kiss to Cas’s forehead, “Now c’mon, I’ve had enough Walmart for a month.” Cas chuckled, happily following Dean as he practically plowed people over to get to the checkouts. An isle to their left, however, stopped him short, almost causing Cas to run into him.
Warnings: PTSD and some internalized homophobia
“You’re in a hurry” Sam commented, watching as the speedometer rose.
Cas laid down beside Dean and wrapped his arms around him, “I will never leave you.”
“Night Cas,” Dean said, finally slipping into unconsciousness.

“Hmm?”
“No.” Dean growled, “Of course I’m not okay.”
with this?”
“I mean every word of it, Dean Winchester, because I love you.”
Dean took a deep breath, though it did little to steady his racing heart, and stepped into the far end, where the water barely touched his ankles.
Sam finally raised his gaze to Deans, “Philip, Dean. And I just – what he did. I shouldn’t have let that happen.” Panicked rolled off of Dean’s body, so he quickly added, “Cas didn’t tell me much – anything really – but he was acting off, and I walked in on him and Philip.”

Dean shook his head in amusement, “This won’t be easy for me, not after everything my dad has… instilled into me,” he continued.
of you.” He pulled back, clapping Dean on his shoulder. “This is awesome, man!”
“Dean!” Cas cut him off, “You are not stupid. No, maybe it wasn’t likely Michael was going to hold to your deal, but still his actions are his own. If you hadn’t said yes, Michael would have killed us and then found some other, albeit weaker, vessel to use. And then who would be here to try and stop him. You can’t put this on yourself. I mean, do you blame Nick for everything Lucifer did with him? Do you blame
Sam smiled, “Well, glad to see you up. What were you and Cas talking about?” For a fraction of a second, Sam thought he saw a flash of panic on Dean’s face.
“I – I know you won’t be mad,” Dean started hesitantly, “And I hope you won’t judge me…”
“Dean.” Cas said softly.
?” He asked, incredulous.
Dean slowly, oh so very slowly, started to wrap his head around the concept that he and Cas could be, would be, are? together. “Cas if you really want this – me – you’re going to have to put up with a lot of crap.”
“Yeah, I know,” Sam agreed, sitting across from his brother.
“Cas, c’mon. Hit me,” Dean insisted. He felt Cas’s hands hesitantly press onto his head. A tingly feeling washed over him, before the memories, ones he didn’t even know of, came flooding through his mind. Dean tried to concentrate through the mind melting pain, searching for the weapon that had caused this harm to Michael. Suddenly the tingly feeling stopped.
Cas practically ran through the halls, colliding with Sam, who promptly slammed into the opposing wall.
“I don’t know, kind of your thing,” Sam remarked.
Warnings: Descriptive depression
Dean awoke to find Cas’s arm draped loosely across his stomach; Cas also wasn’t flush against his body. Apparently even sleeping – resting? Meditating? – whatever the heck the angel did while Dean was sleeping, he still kept a respectful distance, not wanting to ever make Dean uncomfortable.
“Is this ok?” Cas asked, knowing how important consent was to Dean after everything he had been through.
Dean turned to look Cas in the eyes, “No! Of course not, I just… I’m not comfortable with it yet, I guess.” Dean sighed, “I don’t know, I don’t even know if I’m comfortable with myself.” He laughed darkly, dragging his hand over his face, “It’s awesome what years of being fed lies will do to you huh?”
Dean couldn’t stop choking, begging for air to fill his lungs, and then he actually was choking and water was caught in his throat and -
Dean sat at the kitchen table, an empty glass of whiskey next to him. It was late, and he knew he should sleep, but his thoughts wouldn’t keep quiet. While pouring himself more alcohol, Sam appeared in the doorway. “Dude why are you still up? It’s the middle of the night,” Sam asked, grabbing a water glass from the cabinet.
Dean nodded. “Yeah,” he whispered.
Sitting across from him, Dean could clearly see something was bothering his brother, “What’s wrong?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas replied, grabbing the green and black flannel pants and navy-blue shirt Dean had been referring to, and slipping into the bathroom. Dean stared at the now closed door, unsure what to make of the whole situation. And that’s how Cas found him a minute later: still staring, still confused. “Are you sure this is okay?” Cas asked before clarifying, “Are you sure you’re
Dean nodded, “Thank you…”
“Dean?” Cas questioned.
“Ok,” Dean breathed, a smile creeping over his face, “ok. Wow, this is – this is real.” Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, pulling him down onto the bed. “Which means, we can sleep for five more minutes.”
“Dean! Stop.” Cas interrupted, rubbing Dean’s neck soothingly, “Sam will never – could never – hate you. I mean, does he hate Charlie or Claire? You are his
? That’s incredibly strong. Third, you need to stop blaming yourself for Michael. I know it will take time, but you aren’t responsible for his cruelness. And finally, the past, Dean? That’s, well, that’s in the past. Whatever problems we may have had, they don’t matter anymore.”
that has to do with you matters to me. Please, tell me.”
Dean didn’t want to let go. Just wanted to let himself sink into the comfort that was Cas. But he pulled away. He couldn’t be that selfish, that needy. He had to be strong, like everyone expected,
Dean groaned, swinging his legs over the side of the bed, “Tell him if he eats it all he’ll be making a donut run.” Dean waited until he could no longer hear Jacks retreating footsteps. Moving to his dresser, he grabbed a pair of black sweatpants and a blue flannel to accompany his usual black t-shirt. “Cas…”
Cas sighed, “Fine. I’ll be in the library if you need me.”
Relief flooded over Sam, “Hallelujah.”
wasn’t even sure that he was free of Michael, that at the snap of a finger, he wouldn’t just be repossessed.
“It’s all I have wanted since I first saw you in hell.” Cas responded, as if it was the simplest thing in the world, as if it didn’t completely shatter everything Dean had been telling himself for years.
Dean looked away, blinking rapidly.
For the second time that day, Cas confused Sam. Cas abruptly took on what could only be described as a ‘pissed-off’ mood, accompanied by a sudden change of topic. “Where is Philip? The hunter.”
, but rather, stay in the comforting arms of his angel, safe from the troubles of the world.
Five more minutes turned into three when there was a knock at the door. “Dean?” Jack called through the door, “Sam says you can stop hiding from the people and come eat breakfast before he eats it all.”
Dean looked at him nervously, searching for any lies. Except, he found none. “You would seriously be okay being with –
, from him. Like he constantly demanded from himself.
Cas’s brow furrowed in confusion, like he didn’t understand why he
“Your brother,” Cas squinted in his usual thinking face. How much would Dean be comfortable telling Sam? “Dean is… dealing with some stuff, but he will be ok, someday.” Sam nodded; he should talk to Dean later.
Dean’s eyes shot up to stare at Cas. “Wh-what? Seriously? I mean, you’d actually do that? For
He hadn’t meant for it to spiral.
Dean remained silent, he had faced bullies – abuse – before, he could handle it, he could manage. He had to; he wasn’t given another option. Philip roughly spun him around. “I asked you a question, or can you not even answer right? Are you so stupid that you can’t even answer a simple question?” Philip’s voice was full of rage, and dangerously loud. Dean was scared it would draw attention, and the last thing he needed was to be seen as weak on top of everything else.
“6:43 a.m.”
As it turned out, Dean did not need a flannel.
Finally, Dean said, “It’s mostly verbal, blaming me for Michael, showing me how stupid and worthless I really am… he rarely gets physical…”
Dean twitched in his seat, something, Sam noticed, happened whenever he was stressed or anxious after being possessed, “What did Cas do?”
Dean smirked to himself, “Thank you, Cas”
him for Michael. Philip had mentioned several times how he wished Dean was still possessed by Michael, because at least then, they knew who their target was. And Dean wished he could shrink into himself, that he wasn’t so tall, so big, that he wasn’t taking up so much space because then, maybe –
“What are you talking about?” Dean interrupted.
“Stop,” Dean whispered, curling in on himself and screwing his eyes shut, as if that would help end the voice in his head.
what it’s done to Dean. This
Dean rolled his eyes but nevertheless grabbed his brother’s weird healthy milk.
Dean looked up at him, “Yeah, yeah. I think – I mean, I’ve spent the last however many weeks, trapped and alone. It’s nice to have some company, especially someone who… cares, for me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I’m such a m-mess. If I’m not yelling at you or Sam or whoever then I’m failing – I’m messing on hunts and
Sam glared at him, “C’mon man, this isn’t a joke. Something huge happened and you won’t even really talk about. But this whole Michael thing, we need to deal with it.”
Sam’s eyes grew wide, “Oh yeah. No offense or anything, but I think you were the

think that of yourself. You are worthy of so much, deserving of so much. And I know you don’t see it, and I can only hope that someday you will. That you will see yourself as I see you – as beautiful, as whole, as perfect.”
You really think he should just be welcomed back with open arms?” Philip shook his head in disbelief, “That’s like welcoming the Devil.”
Cas laughed, “Oh Dean.”
Sam blinked, “Uh – last I saw he was in the armory?” Cas turned on his heels, trench coat flaring, as he walked out of the kitchen.
Several moments of silence passed, and Sam waited for his brother to look like he was in at least a little less agony before asking, “Ready to keep going?”
Dean happily climbed the stairs into the war room. “I’m good, I am. Just really, really happy to be…” His voice trailed off. Upon taking in the scene before him, his stomach dropped, and his heart began to speed. “Home…” he finished quietly. Gaze darting across the multitude of people in the room.
So Dean settled with hesitantly shaking his head no, and waiting, afraid that he had done the wrong thing again, that he should have said he was okay, just so no one would worry, brush away Cas’ comfort, and hide even deeper inside of himself
“What do we need chocolate milk for?” Dean asked.
Cas’s head shot towards the doorway. Barely a second passed before he was racing out of the kitchen, Jack calling after him, surely confused.
Dean genuinely smiled now, happy that he could do something in return for his angel. Then he had a more serious thought, “So what now?” he asked, sitting up next to Cas.
Hope and pride bloomed in Cas’s eyes, “You really think so?”
“Okay, I’m literally going 80 to deal with it. How can I be running away from something when I’m racing toward it.”
They sat in silence for several minutes, Dean wrestling with whether he wanted or was ready to talk about it, knowing he should talk about it (and who better to confide in than Cas?), and the fact that holy crap, Cas was being patient with him and giving him the luxury of time, something he rarely, if ever had. “I uh,” Dean took a shaky breath, wishing he could have a break from the anxiety for five freaking minutes, “when I was, when Mi-…” Dean curled his fingers tighter around the mug, “while I was gone, I don’t remember most of what
Cas nodded, setting his bundle of clothes on the chair and moved toward the bed. Dean had pulled the covers back and laid down already. Cas laid next to him and tugged the covers over the two of them. “Goodnight Dean,”
“Dean?” Cas asked concernedly, “What’s wrong, what happened.”
make Dean feel better. “Dean, this isn’t your fault, you can’t blame yourself for Michael’s actions. Sure, you may be his sword, you may have been his vessel, but only because you saw no other way. Michael was the one who didn’t keep his word and let you go after he killed Lucifer.”
“Dean?” Cas mumbled. Abruptly pulling his arm away and sitting up, assuming he was the cause of Dean’s distress. “I’m sorry, I fell asleep and – I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that.”
The blankets were piled on him, creating a safe cocoon. He had been like this since yesterday, well he thought so at least. Time didn’t mean much anymore; why did it matter anyway? His mind had become a prison – he was trapped, alone, and hopeless. His mind either focused solely on one thing, one painful, heart-rending thought or memory, or it focused on nothing at all, and he was left swimming in pressing nothingness. Tears slipped down his face randomly. He didn’t want to eat or get up; he didn’t even want to breath. It was exhausting anyways. Inflate against the outside world only for it to crush you back in. He knows he
Dean just stared at him, conflicted between wanting to reassure him and lift one of Cas’ many burdens, though it likely wouldn’t do any good, and being honest for once in his miserable life, screaming at the top of his lungs that
“Dean! No,” Cas stopped him, “It’s ok. It will all be ok.”
Dean shrugged, “I put us all in danger today, stupid danger.”
“I know…” Turning on his heels, Dean visibly steeled himself, and headed for the kitchen. Peaking inside he saw Sammy still there, sitting at the table sipping a cup of coffee. “Hey…” he started, feeling awkward after he ran out from the conversation.
Dean laid there, not wanting to get up and face the world
Dean’s lie may have been believable, had it not been for his unconvincing smile and his all-telling muscles that – after Michael – would flinch whenever he was anxious or stressed – or panicking; that and the fact that Cas hadn’t felt that from him before, at least not that strongly; not even when Kevin or Charlie or Bobby or even Sam had died.
Dean shook his head, wanting so desperately to stop the thoughts, and changed out of his pajamas. His hand reached out to grab the door handle, but he froze. The horror from his nightmare had faded and was instead replaced by gnawing anxiety. His stomach did flips over itself and he slid to the ground. Dean ran his nails over his palms again and again, needing something to slow his heart and loosen his throat so he could breathe. Frustrated tears slipped down his cheeks, making the air come in even harder gasps, his head twitching to one side. Dean continued to cry and scratch at his hands until the attack had faded. Even still, when he finally had the courage to try and leave his room again, his shaking hands returned. Cracking open the door, he pushed his head out, and upon seeing no one in the hallway, he slipped out, shutting the door behind him.
“Are you okay?” Sam barely got the question out.
“Dude, I’ve been watching you two skirt around each other for

And now he’s gone, and he’s out there, putting an army of monsters together and he’s hurting people and it’s all on me. I said yes. It’s my fault.” While he was speaking, tears began to roll down his face. He sipped his tea, unsure of how Cas would react.
“Whatever it was it must’ve been strong,” Sam answered, finally taking his eyes off of the mark.
“Shh,” Cas soothed, “it’s okay, you’re here now, I’m here now.”
“What’s wrong?” Dean looked at him incredulously, “What’s
“Jack. It’s practically his favorite thing to drink. Not exactly the healthiest, but at least he still drinks plenty of water,” Cas explained.
“Sam told me, ain’t no thing.” Dean assured. They stared at each other for a minute longer. “Well, I uh, I need a shower.” Dean headed for the door, pausing to spare one more look at Cas, assuring himself that he was here, he was back, this was

Dean must have taken longer to dress than he thought, because by the time he stepped out of his ensuite bathroom, Cas was sitting on his bed with a cup of tea.
Dean was never one for displays of emotions, especially hugs – a product of his abusive past, he supposes – but it was what Sam needed right now, and ever since finally having a steady relationship with Cas, he found himself a little more okay with. So he stayed until Sam eventually pulled away.
people, because in his mind, torture would always get him answers?
But Cas had run off already. Approaching Dean’s door, he found it locked – but with a little bit of his grace, the handle clicked and turned open. Cas entered quickly; the door swinging shut behind him. The sight before him brought tears to his eyes. Kneeling by Dean’s side he threw the lighter onto the floor, where it clicked shut. He wrapped his arms tightly around Dean, wishing to squeeze the pain from him.
A fond smile came over Dean’s face, “You’re a good dad to him, you know that right?”
“Dean-”
Dean took another step into the water and reached for his soap. He washed his body as fast as he could, but still being careful to keep his head out of the water. He almost succeeded, and would have if it hadn’t been for his shaking hands.
“Okay, look, I’m just saying, you said you let Michael in and then bang – you’re back in a blink. But for me, you were gone – for
“It’s chamomile and lavender, with, of course, honey,” Cas explained shyly. “When I was human, I found it to be quite soothing… I thought it might help.”
“Your brother, where is he? I must get to him.”
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asked gently.
Cas’s heart hurt, “
Clearly though, Dean wasn’t ready – or willing – to talk about it, “O-oh, right. That was nothing Cas, it was probably when Lily was about to walk out y’know, not help us bring Jack back.”
“I’m sorry, I wanted to be there but we figured Michael would sense my presence..” Cas trailed off.
The motel is right across the street from the bar, and Dean guides Sam outside and points him off in the direction of it.
Cas laughs, a rare thing, but he's still looking at Dean uncertainly.
He claps his hand on Cas' shoulder and feels like an asshole for it so he lets his hand linger for a moment. That feels even more absurd, so he retracts it entirely. “I’ll try to be less confusing in future.”
This is insane. This is pure insanity.
He returns to the table with trepidation, tuning into the conversation as early as he can before arriving. He gets Sam a refill too, because he’s trying.
"What're we watching?"
"Thanks. For.." Dean says eventually, a strangled noise that makes him clear his throat even if he's sure it only sounds weird in his own head. Cas nods slowly at him.
"Right. Because the population of men who are sexually attracted to men is significantly smaller than that who are attracted to women." He nods stoically.
say that, he remembers. Around the time of their first case together, when they'd been to a bar and a guy had put a drink in front of Cas that looked a little cloudy. Was he hard-wired to be paranoid? Maybe. Had a tiny selfish part of him been saying it for other reasons, too? He didn't like to dwell on it.
"So you were watching?"
"No problem."
He's glad that, because it's Jack, he moves on without a thought, but Dean can feel the weight of Cas trying very hard not to look at him as the conversation diverts to other aspects of the show and Dean tries to temper the humiliation he feels at the way he'd frozen.
He thinks it might be a hangover from when Cas was human. Seeing him... vulnerable, really vulnerable, for the first time. But then, Dean doesn't like to think about that time at all. Not after what he did to him when he was in that position.
"Oh. Really?" Cas looks back over at the table where James is now blushing, any confidence immediately dissipated now he's back around his guffawing friends. "It's difficult to tell sometimes."
“Mine. Alright? You don’t need it.” His voice sounds sharper than it should and he feels guilty but turns away anyway, opening and closing the chamber a couple of times. Awkward silence stretches out.
“It’s not – I’m not uncomfortable when I do that.”
"I know what a phallic symbol is. This? This is my gun. It's just.. my gun. Sometimes things are just
“It’s certainly not helping make this any easier.” Cas talks as he re-enters the motel room and for a brief second Dean’s heart is in his mouth as he wonders how much else of the conversation he’d heard. The popsicle stick is in his mouth and he pulls it out, assessing them quietly with it for a moment before placing it in the garbage can below the desk by Dean’s feet. "You should stay inside in the shade, I'm going to head out again."
“It’s not. But I could understand feeling that way, when all you’ve known is the way these things are treated on earth.” Dean feels like there’s something subliminal underneath what Cas is saying, but he isn’t quite sure if he’s able to dig into it.
“I’m sorry.”
"I've never asked. I guess it makes sense though, right? Angels don't really have gender like we do."
The show ends soon after, and Jack doesn't turn the TV off straight away. The switch to commercials is jarring.
Dean stands up. "Right. No. Thanks, man." He says redundantly and rubs his palms on the front of his jeans. It seems to satisfy Sam that he's at least not defensive, but Dean figures at this point it'd be a case of protesting too much. "I'm just looking out for him. Me and Cas are all good."
“What – like having sex? Oh yeah, you’ve never once brought that up in conversation.” Dean makes a half-hearted noise of irritation but his heart isn’t in it. After a moment Sam looks at him more carefully and frowns a little. “Look, if there’s something else-“
Face wet and elbows on the ground Dean lies down on his back and feels Cas surrounding him – in the grass, in the sun shining on his face, in the wind that spreads him. He closes his eyes.
"Has to be, right? He watches enough TV.."
And it’s that simple to him, apparently. He doesn’t ask Dean for anything else. It pisses Dean off, actually – he
"’s personal. Unless they wanna talk about it, that’s on them.”
“I mean, I guess like you said. Sometimes I can’t tell what you’re thinking. And then you start talking about things that throw me, man.”
"That you what?"
have a mini-freezer. Sam had gone out for lunch earlier and came back with a pack of half-melted popsicles that Dean had fallen on like a child. They’d put the rest away to re-freeze, but found themselves back at them an hour later.
"What would you do?"
"I think he's married. Sorry, Cas... Why are you talking about this?"
"I'm gonna get myself a refill."
After a few moments he hears a faint buzzing and squints his eyes against the sun’s rays to see the blurred shape of a bee circling in front of him. He feels a smile twitching his features.
"You totally shut him down."
"Dean.." Predictably, Sam is the first to break the silence. Dean refuses to look at him, hearing the expression on his face in his voice.
"Thank you for the drink."
"'Cus he's a coward. Can't bring himself to ask."
." He’s self-conscious and a little petulant and he’s expecting Cas’ eyes on him before he feels him actually turn. Dean doesn’t meet him halfway and so he looks back again at Jack.
"I know it is." Cas frowns at Sam’s words in a way that equally makes Dean want to smile and run for the hills. "Hypothetically, yes. I don't see gender in the same way as people do on earth. I find human men physically attractive. Practically speaking, though, I suppose it's a little more complicated than that."
"The hell did that happen?-" Dean murmurs, "-Jake's worried that they might not accept him."
"I like it."
"Some people, they think that.. their God, the God that people pray to, they think he says it's a sin."
"For a guy in a regular bar."
“Yeah, get out of here.”
"Are refills your personal responsibility?" He knows Cas isn't trying to flirt. He can hear the uncertainty in his voice, almost as if checking if the man has an actual job as a territorial drinks re-filler. Still, the words make him queasy as the man smiles.
Cas smiles, but it dies again. There's a touch of awkwardness in the air. "Sometimes I forget how young Jack is to be unfamiliar with so much about humanity that I've started to take for granted. You said he'd asked you before about dating."
"What's funny?"
“I know we will.” He smiles a little as he turns to walk away and suddenly Dean’s heart is in his mouth at the sight of the back of his head.
He knows Cas can take care of himself - and the whole of earth too, besides. But something makes him feel a little off at the idea of seeing him walking around alone in an unfamiliar place with weapons.
Cas disappears off towards the bar and Dean watches the back of his head as he stands, a little too straight and poised to be human, and waits to be served. When he returns a few moments later with two fresh beers in his hand, he clears his throat.
“This is for you.” The bartender puts the beer down next to Cas’ ¾ full one. "From the guy over there." The bartender points to a table of three men and two women. One of the guys, a dark-haired bespectacled man with stubble, raises a hand at Cas and looks back at his table who are laughing. Cas frowns.
It’s the truth, in a way. He hasn’t thought about it. Dean's made it his responsibility before to try and hook Cas up with a girl, and part of him deep down knows that his motivations for that are fucked up on ten different levels but it's different contemplating Cas with a man.
Sam had pity in his eyes when he said it, Dean remembers. He’d hated it. It felt like a betrayal – some kind of weird form of gossiping behind Cas’ back that Sam could admit that they had something extra beyond Sam that Dean had never once allowed himself to vocalise to Cas when he was here. Because of.. well, because of too many things that he was far too fucked to start to entertain in a meadow at 7am on a Thursday.
"Thank you for telling me, Jack. I’m flattered that you see me that way."
"I see. Sticking around for long?"
He has no way of knowing for sure, of course; he never asked, but it feels like something he just
“Cas..”
"You never asked." Cas holds Dean's gaze for a moment and he can feel his cheeks burning when he eventually turns back to Jack. "Gender and sexual identity work differently in angels than they do humans, but I've found the longer I've spent on earth the more I identify with the way humans categorise their world. I think I would place myself closer to 'gay' on the spectrum, though I've explored the idea of being with women before. You may see the word differently as a nephilim born on earth but angels aren’t built to naturally experience gender. The human concept of being a male is something I've come to associate myself with over time. Whether you think human labels apply to you too is something only you can decide."
"I dunno, man. The... I guess the same as Sam."
Cas is frowning in confusion and Dean pulls a ‘never mind’ expression, closing his eyes and shaking his head a little. Cas, incredibly given the heat, straightens out his trench-coat and leaves through the open motel room door with a nod.
"Sorry about that, man. This place is nice."
Cas would get a kick out of that, he thinks, imagining him staring up into the sky with the sun shining on his face. He walks towards it, touching his fingers along the bricked wall before veering off the path into the thin woods.
“On the contrary, I enjoy getting to know parts of you I wasn’t fully aware of. I may have held your soul in my hands, but you’re still capable of taking me by surprise.” He says it so simply that the words almost don’t register with Dean. Until they do, and he feels his heart stutter.
It's a hot day at the end of a hot week at the end of a hot month. Days had stretched out endlessly and Dean had been thanking their lucky stars once again to have the bunker as a home base. Travelling is torture, endless stuffy motel rooms with broken air-con leaving them ratty and exhausted.
Cas cracks eventually, smiling in relent. "Maybe not just now, but unfortunately I am. I wish I could pretend I was feigning ignorance to innuendo on purpose."
Before another painful silence can stretch out while Dean ponders that, Sam hums to himself. Dean jumps in quickly.
"Is he for real?" Dean says more to himself than Sam, who nevertheless is delighted.
“Shut your face.” Dean sits back down in his chair, feeling the sweat caked into its back from where he’s been leaning against it. "How in the hell did we get here?"
"Oh I don't think Dean wants that."
“I won’t argue. Not now. But I hope I can make you understand that you deserve it. Happiness, peace.. love-” The word has Dean’s mind reeling, flashbacks and heat rushing “– I spent a long time believing I couldn’t accept them for myself. I thought too much had happened, or that I wasn’t built to be capable. You allowed me to think differently. I want you to do the same.” Cas looks down and taps his hand on the edge of the table as though he hasn’t got Dean’s heart in the palm of it. He looks up again and his expression is breath-takingly earnest. “Dean, the things I said barely touch the sides. I don’t know if I could ever put into words the impact you’ve had on me since we met. I just wanted you to understand. I needed you to understand how other people see you, even if you can’t see it for yourself.”
"I understand. My apologies. I thought because you were staying here, you wouldn't mind. From now on I will always gain your consent to touch it."
"I thought we were going out into the woods tonight."
He opens the box and looks at the ashes. Sam hadn’t said a word when he’d found him on his knees collecting them, which had somehow been worse than if he
"Oh yeah?"
"Well gee, if you like him so much why don't you make
"It's just.. you never said."
"I see. I did wonder if.. I don’t always hear it when I’m saying it."
Cas holds up the beer and nods in the direction of the man.
that causes Dean to always be the one to look away first and to bolt at the first sign of a conversation like this. "Should probably go and warn Sammy that Jack's coming round with questionnaires."
And it’s not just that, either. Cas is an
“Someone has an admirer.” Sam says, more to himself, before engaging back in their previous conversation. One-sided that it is - Cas is looking at the man across the room, and Dean is watching him. He can see even from the view of the back of his head that its tilted a little in confusion. Sam tries to catch his eye and Dean avoids it.
"Are you afraid I won't like yours as much?" God, he must be fucking with him. He and Sam probably planned this.
The idea that a being so.. untouched, by humanity, could feel human things about him is more than Dean can compute most days. So he doesn't. He pushes it down and convinces himself it's not possible, for every reason under the sun.
The kiss slows steadily and then all at once as Cas’ lips lighten against his, and he feels him exhale against his skin in a release that Dean himself is desperate for. He knows it’ll come, eventually: in every moment he allows himself to open like this, touch on his skin making him feel alive.
“I know.” Cas’ own voice is quiet now and Dean’s fingers somehow find themselves reaching out towards Cas’ hand, pulling it a little.
He places the glasses carefully between his legs and pours a thumb into both.
"Cowboy movies isn't taste, Dean."
"Why not?"
“That’s not what I mean.”
"Sam and Dean are brothers, they don't share a bed."
"Hear you owe me ten dollars."
But he sees Cas. And he sees Cas seeing him.
“No.. yeah, you..” It feels awkward to try and explain, so Dean doesn’t. Cas doesn’t seem to mind.
He can barely look at him, if he’s being honest with himself. He knew he’d find it hard because of who Jack is but he didn’t expect that added dagger, driving deep into chest when he looked up and saw the kid tilt his head in confusion.
Dean leaves the bunker not long after midnight as Wednesday turns to Thursday.
And you know what? Sue him. Maybe Sam's comments have gotten to him.
"I- yeah. Or just, y'know. Dating. All of that. Like Claire and Kaia, right? They're gay. Or lesbian, I guess."
Dean’s hand stills in the air above his cup of coffee as the voice cuts through the kitchen.
Dean’s heart is in his mouth. Jack is quietly watching next to him and Dean knows he doesn't give a crap what he's thinking but he feels on display. He always feels weird watching people talk about their feelings - like people are expecting him to have a reaction. When Jake starts crying and his mom wraps arms around him he focuses studiously on his book, tuning out her reassurances. He can feel his heart thumping in his chest. He hears Freddy's name and squints his eyes harder, until the words start to blur.
"I know that sometimes I struggle to be inconspicuous on a case. I was wondering if it could be used for networking. That way, it doesn’t have to be spontaneous. You could coach me on what to say."
And this,
"Alright, fill me in." Dean says as he sits down on the couch next to Jack.
He’s looking at him now like he might break.
is more like it, Dean’s barely able to think as Cas’ mouth opens and his tongue plays along the line of Dean’s own lips, his heart hammering in his chest as he hears a noise in Cas’ throat as he allows him entrance.
difficult. I threw things at you that’d been on my mind for a long time and didn’t give you any time to process it.”
‘Last week’ meaning when Cas had got himself into trouble with a particularly determined group of demons, and Dean had felt his heart leap into his mouth for a split second as Cas got thrown against a wall before he managed to smite the first couple and Dean and Sam took care of the rest.
Cas’ hand emerges from the duffle bag holding the gun and he runs his fingertips over the barrel. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the motion, subconscious movements, before approaching him and holding his hand out.
"I'll tell you what happens next episode."
“Hmm.” Dean tries to sound vaguely interested, pulling his eyes away from the back of Cas’ head and looking around the bar for literally anything else to focus on.
“That you, Cas?” The bee approaches him further, maybe smelling the grass on his skin, before flying away in the direction of the stream. Dean watches until it disappears and then feels his smile grow further, self-pitying. “God, what’s wrong with me?” He shakes his head and laughs a little at the absurdity. “Ah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m cracking up. About time, huh? I should try getting some sleep one of these nights.”
"You really have to ask? Because I have taste, Cas."
"Whatever. You done being weird now? I want to take a nap."
"Yeah, exactly."
He opens his eyes reluctantly as he pulls away, not sure what he’s expecting to see (rejection? Lucifer? nothing at all?) and almost slams them shut again when he finds Cas peering at him with such utter arresting devotion he thinks his knees might buckle.
“No, that’s got nothing to do with it. It’s my gun.” Dean offers lamely, avoiding any other thoughts altogether.
This is all getting a little much. Cas’ newfound fascination with the dating world isn’t especially surprising or out-there – the more he ingratiates himself with humanity, the more he comes across things he’s interested by. But watching cheesy rom-coms and talking about
Before Sam can say anything else to make Dean’s fight or flight response engage, Cas comes back to the table.
"She reminds me a lot of you, actually." Cas shrugs but there's a weight behind it that slowly dissipates. "Why is it that only you're allowed to influence my experiences of pop culture?"
".. Why?"
“Are you avoiding me?”
“Yeah, that’s an understatement.” Dean coughs and stands up, tapping his hands against his legs for something to do. Cas is looking at him expectantly and Dean knows he deserves answers but how is he supposed to do that? How do you even
"I thanked him for the drink but said I'm having a 'Boys Night'." Cas looks delighted with his memory of the phrase, air quotes included, "-with my friends. His friends suggested that was what James was interested in too but I suspect they were talking about a different kind of 'Boys Night'."
"Because it's my gun."
"Why? You thinking of getting one?"
“I’m so sorry, Cas.” He says eventually, his voice so quiet he isn’t sure if he’s even said it out loud. “I should’ve.. done something, stopped him somehow. He didn’t even hesitate.” Images flash in Dean’s mind, bright light spreading from Cas’ eyes and mouth. He swallows. "I tried to stop you. Don't know if.. well, I did. Sammy grabbed me. Think he was worried I'd follow you. Maybe I would've, I don't know." He would. He knows that for certain. “He tried telling me you wouldn’t want me to. Which is.. I mean, it’s true isn’t it? You hate all my self-sacrificing crap.”
He grabs his rucksack from the passenger seat and flings it over his shoulder, heavy contents rattling and bashing against his back. He starts to walk back towards the farm sign, never quite allowing the building to come into view but following the trail until he stops dead.
"Right. Sure."
"Dean told me that for humans it's an important moment when you share your attraction with people you care about."
If Dean looks up sometimes for a couple of minutes when the show gets loud, so what? His body reacts to loud noises. That's just science.
"Why would I take that the wrong way? Is it a bad thing?"
"Guess not." Dean manages to offer and if Cas is disappointed at him taking the easy way out his face doesn't betray him. It's the closest they've ever come to talking about it - this abstract
"I know you'd want me to give him a chance. I do. I just-" he chokes on his words, "God I wish you were here, man. I don’t know what else I can say."
Dean would never tell him to his face, but in the last episode he'd been around for he could see where Sam was coming from. He's not intending to give him the satisfaction any time soon, though. Nor Cas, who Dean never asked for his opinion on the matter but also never spoke up to take Dean's side, rather looking at him with a judgemental flicker in his eyes.
Dean places both hands palm-down on the lid with purpose, and looks at the space between his thumbs.
"It's a shame you didn't talk to him, man.” Dean breaks the silence first. “I think you should've gone for it."
and Dean feels breathless as he lowers his hands from his face to his neck and then to his hip, pulling Dean sharply against him as Dean’s own hands cup his jaw and try desperately to gain a semblance of control.
A scene at debate club follows which is painfully awkward, Jake and Freddy on opposing sides but both of them refusing to do anything to engage the other. Dean’s getting more frustrated now watching the two of them stare at each other, and in his head he’s questioning how anyone can stand watching them dance around each other like this talking in code.
“Me and Dean can handle that.”
"I think Tinder is a hook-up app, Cas. If you start asking about strange smells..."
“I wonder if you can hear me.”
They leave the bar not long after, in the direction of the woods. Cas smiles and waves at James as he leaves and the man has the audacity to wink at him. Dean refocuses on Cas as they come out through the doors into the cold night air.
Dean waits for him to ask Sam, but he doesn't.
Dean takes his time, registering every mini-movement of expression in Cas’ face as he understands what’s happening. His hand comes up to Dean’s wrist but doesn’t push it away, rather grips it for dear life as though he’s afraid it’s going to disappear. When Cas’ eyes travel down his face Dean takes it as invitation and closes the gap between them, pressing his lips lightly but surely against Cas’.
"TV was on, I was there." Dean shrugs but Cas raises his eyebrows. "What? You think I was watching some dorky kids show, you kidding me?"
"Are you even listening to me?"
"Why was Jake upset when he talked to his mom?"
"No, I-" Dean interrupts. "I don't think it'll work. It's a nice idea, but I think the way we do things works just fine."
"My Bravo shows have their uses."
"Not especially. Claire thought I already did."
"Long. Longer than average, I think."
"Yeah, well. Sam likes drama. They're buddies, right?"
"Oh. I'm sorry."
"Nothing."
“I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem.” Dean stands up swiftly before conversation can devolve anymore, and Cas’ confused expression only grows. Dean claps Sam on the shoulder. “C’mon, man. Wanna make sure you don’t get lost.”
And they are. Driven to distraction sometimes? Maybe. But good all the same.
“No. I’m not avoiding you.”
“It’s not difficult. Probably not for anyone else except me.”
"Friends ask that kind of thing about each other."
Cas hesitates for a second before talking. "I've seen inside you, Dean." God, that phrase. The way it cuts him apart. "I know that there are things that you struggle to talk about. Things that you feel.. guilt, and shame over." Concepts that should be foreign to Cas, that he's seen inside Dean. "I thought it best not to try and initiate those conversations for myself."
"Why?"
"Didn’t say you were.”
He’s leaving. He’s still leaving, he’s turning away and suddenly Dean’s legs are propelling him through the kitchen of their own accord.
"Huh. Well, it sucks sometimes when your best bud finds someone new."
"Yeah, that's right. I saw him pour this one, though, so you're good."
"What do you mean?"
He tries to force himself not to, allowing the mutual
"Right. And who's bed are you sleeping in?"
"I mean.. I don't think I'll only like women. I'm not a human, right? I don't really think about who I like in that way, like there's a difference. Or about being a man or a woman myself."
"That's-" Dean swallows the beer in his mouth, "-that's fine, kid."
“I’m not going anywhere.”
Cas places the gun into Dean’s hand slowly. His fingertips are warm and Dean pulls away. There’s enough blood rushing to unwanted places already.
He’s fucking with him. He is.
"Huh? Dude, I'm not a homophobe."
A couple of hours down confined to research in the stuffy but shaded room, Cas is enjoying his popsicle sat outside the open front door on the wooden ledge that surrounds the building. Dean can see he’s enjoying it, as he's currently inserting the entire thing into his mouth at once and licking along the bottom of it as he removes it from his mouth with a pop. Dean’s watching in utter disbelief as he does so, his lips turning red with liquid and his tongue flicking along them. It's utterly obscene.
Dean drops it before Sam gets any more daring. “I can’t believe he was going to take the gun.”
"Hello Dean."
Dean repositions himself so he’s facing him more head-on and picks at the blankets a little. He can practically hear Cas frown.
Cas continues looking at him until Dean can hardly bear it. He looks away. Cas stands up. Dean doesn’t look back again until he sees him walking across the room towards the table.
"I don't have a bed."
Freddy is Jack's favourite character, though Dean doesn't get why. The guy's prickly and a jackass half the time, never saying what he really feels. Jake can do better, actually. He's home-schooled and sheltered, though, so Dean guesses rebellion must taste good.
"Woah woah, you're taking my gun?"
He knows the way Cas acts towards him sometimes isn't how two men act towards each other. But Cas isn't a man, he reminds himself. He's an.. angel male? He isn't sure, to be honest. He looks like one, at least, and for Dean that's enough to sound alarm bells when he feels eyes train on his.
"No idea, man."
"Yeah. Don't take this the wrong way, but I've never seen you as the friends with benefits type."
There’s a few seconds of silence after he leaves. Sam clears his throat.
"Yeah, I'll bet." Cas tilts his head in confusion and Dean shrugs him off, refusing to speculate on what Cas might have thought he meant by that. "You love that cheesy stuff."
"Anything to say about that?" Sam looks at him like he's expecting something and Dean frowns.
It’s been three days since Cas got back and it occurs to Dean when he speaks that it’s the first time they’ve been alone together. Awake, that is: Dean realised early on that difficult conversations couldn’t happen if you’re asleep. Thank god for Cas’ Empty-rescue hangover.
Dean doesn't want to say what he's thinking. That he's pretty sure he can tell the difference between Cas staring at someone in curiosity and Cas staring at someone because he wants to.
"Right. But no, he doesn't interest me." Dean thinks for a split second about asking why not. Cas has never actually spoken about what specifically he's into before, and sometimes he wonders... "I don't know him well enough."
"Yes, Jack?"
"I see. Is that not the common experience?"
"I'm not- whatever." Dean shakes his head.
"For a friend with benefits?”
“Dean, I hope I don’t make you uncomfortable when I ask questions like that.”
“I know you did. I know that. I just.. I believe you, and nobody’s ever really said that stuff to me and meant it before. So I don’t really know how to talk to you about it. But I.. so long as you know I appreciate it.” The words are too fast and Dean doesn’t know if that’s more or less embarrassing than the way he’s stumbling, pathetic half-words forcing their way out of his mouth.
"Must be a tight squeeze, all of you in one bed." There's a questioning quirk in the man's eyebrow and Dean feels a little sick.
“Yeah I’m gonna… OK.”
And that.. that throws Dean for a loop. Jack goes back to eating his burger, apparently satisfied, and Dean feels like he's frozen in time for a second. Like he's the only one who heard it.
"Maybe." Dean looks away to drink but Cas keeps looking at him. "Sam told me that perhaps there were other reasons for your reaction."
"Did you?" Dean eventually asks, daring a glance at him in the rear-view mirror.
“I confess, sometimes I do ask questions out of more of a personal curiosity.”
"Sometimes I think he's doing that on purpose." Dean says the words quietly, not really expecting Sam to hear. He chuckles.
"It's- yeah, it's not as common. You don't meet as many people who are.." Dean doesn't know all the words and god where's Sam when you need him? Or hell, Google? "-Who aren't straight. So it can be a big deal when you tell someone. Especially because you don't know how they're gonna react."
"Uh. Good for Jake, I guess." Dean leaves the room feeling irritated and confused, and more than a little swirled in his stomach.
“I meant it.”
Sam chuckles, and Dean had honestly forgot he's there.
Cas’ so called ‘boys nights’ have become something of a tradition since the day he first used the phrase. Usually during or occasionally after a case, the three of them would head to a local bar which looked the same as every other and Cas would happily drink Sam and Dean under the table barely cracking a smile with it.
"OK."
Dean’s hands drop to his sides of their own accord, suddenly absolutely terrified, but Cas doesn’t move away in return. In fact, he brings his hand to Dean’s cheek and Dean’s sure he must look like a fish opening and closing his mouth in stunned silence before suddenly Cas moves in to kiss him again, other hand coming up to grab his face and hold him in place as his lips are ferocious and impassioned against his own.
He doesn’t allow himself to think what he’s really wondering. That he didn’t like coming back to life underground and so he didn’t want Cas…
“You’d call the purity police.”
"A lot more would be created, too." Cas hums. "Anyway, you're one to talk."
“Whatever.” Dean eventually responds half-heartedly, resettling himself in his chair and burying himself behind his laptop screen. “I can’t concentrate in this heat.”
"Noted. I'll take pictures of my physique."
Sam looks accusingly at Dean, who coughs. He
"Look at him."
He hears the water before he sees it – an honest to god babbling brook with a stream running from it out from the trees towards a source of dawn light. He follows the path of water, tuning into the sounds of birds above him and the crunch of leaves under his feet.
The bartender nods disinterestedly and leaves. Cas looks at the mystery beer with a frown, and then up at Dean.
"Because it seemed to mean a lot to you that I did."
“I’m not avoiding you, Cas. I just.. I’m trying to figure out the stuff I have to say to you.”
"You- alright." Dean eventually responds in lieu of any follow-up from Jack, and Cas turns to look at him again with his eyes a little squinted.
“Sounds complicated.” He isn’t aware he’s even spoken until Cas smiles a little.
"Is that Mila Kunis?" Dean sits down at the foot of his bed and crosses his arms.
not the one watching."
They’d been engaged in a hushed conversation about EMF readings and potential demons for the last couple of minutes, and when a bartender approaches them with a drink they’re quick to shut up. Dean thumps his foot against Cas’ under the table.
"What?"
"Look, man. I'm gonna tell him. If you wanna watch him deep-throat a wooden stick then do it on your own time."
“A lot of the time you do sincerely confuse me with these references and innuendo. But recently I have been.. confused about other things when it comes to our interactions. For a relatively simple species, you can be impossible to understand.”
“I can’t believe he’s wearing a full suit and coat in this weather. There’ll be people in bathing suits on the street. What happened to him trying to blend?”
Dean isn't expecting the sincerity and it knocks him back a little.
He makes his way back towards the stream and bends down at its edge, staring for a few moments at his hazy reflection. Even in the glimmering water he can see the pallid tone to his skin and the bags under his eyes.
Cas looks at him so deeply that Dean can feel heat rising in his cheeks. He takes another long drink. "I'm not...." he hesitates, "I mean, like I say. Do what you want. I don't care."
"I think you're right. I want to.. feel-"
He knows Cas is comfortable on earth but it still feels like Dean's domain. Cas is a visitor, after all, and he doesn't know all there is to know about humans. So yeah, maybe he's a little protective.
"You're not, um.. you're not supposed to ask people that, Jack."
"Mrs Pine and Zach's dad? Gross."
"I'm an eager student."
to explain to someone that their mere presence in the room has your breath hitching? “But it’s not.. you. It’s not you I’m avoiding. It’s just. Y’know. The stuff you said before you..” He doesn’t say it. He can’t. Cas blinks.
Sam nodded, leaning against the weapons table, face drawn in worry and thought, as Cas left to return to his love’s room.
Sam sighed, shifting on the chair, “I just… I’m sorry Dean. I should have known, I should have stopped him, I–”
us to change?”
“I don’t… I’m not ready to let anybody know about us yet, ok? So, just keep it on the downlow. Not too much touchy-feely crap when we’re around the others y’know?” Dean said nervously.
Thanks again!
“Anything. I don’t want to do… anything. There’s no point, Cas, I’m no good. A useless piece of trash that’s not even good for burning.”
Philip had shoved him backwards, flour flinging from the whisk. “Why are you still here, huh?” Philip demanded, “What good are you doing? You’re just hiding; and doing what? Baking? While we’re out there –
Something had changed with Dean since he came back from Michael. Well,
“Cas! What-”
Shouted Sam, immediately attempting to pull Cas away from a beaten and bloodied Philip. It proved harder than expected, Cas
has less right to still be alive than Satan – oh wait,” Cas looked pointedly at Philip, “I forgot. According to you,
Dean glanced at Cas for a split second before answering his brother. “Good, actually, better than I have in a long while. I suppose not sleeping for weeks had something to do with it. Listen, uh, there’s actually something I need to show you.” His voice taking a more serious tone.
“Mm, maybe, but I’m your dork.” A minute passed. “Dean, you’re still here.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean rolled over, “No, Cas that wasn’t – you didn’t – I wasn’t talking to you.”
Dean met the man’s gaze for a second before once again dropping his eyes to the floor, “He just… He just left.”
Dean grabbed something from the men’s clothing rack and turned around to show Cas. In his hands he held a yellow hoodie with the words
“Uh-huh,” Sam narrowed his eyes, like he wasn’t sure if he believed it. Of course, the alternative was Dean probably discussing something about Michael, so he wasn’t about to pry for answers. “Well listen, all the cases that have popped up are being covered, but we do need a supply run. I should stay here in case I’m needed, but I’ll make a list if you’d like to go?”
“Cas,” he called, catching the angel before he disappeared down the hall.  “Do you. I mean, will he even want my help? Do you think he’ll talk to me?”
Cas smiled, climbing out of the car, “Obviously you are…”
wanted vengeance. Finally, Cas relented his mission to cover the walls in Philip’s blood, and stood back, shaking himself from Sam’s grip.
At first, Castiel wasn’t sure how to respond. Wasn’t sure that anything he could say even
Dean sighed, “I mean, two people don’t typically share the same bed without something…” he wasn’t quite sure was to call it, “changing.”
He finished pulling his shirt over his head, when he noticed a mark on his bicep that hadn’t been there before. “What the…” Pulling his sleeve up, Dean realized it was a scar, a large one too. It looked like he had been stabbed by a double pronged spear. He poked his head out of the bathroom, only to find that Cas, and his bundle of clothes, had disappeared.
A smile grew on Dean’s face, “Yeah, it is isn’t it? Since I’ve started a roll of telling you secrets, uh… Me and Cas are… dating.” He finished nervously.
You’re pathetic. Just a body, open and
Dean nodded and Castiel stood to go get the med kit – and maybe ‘happen’ to bump into Philip – when Dean caught his hand, “Could you, maybe, make that tea again, th-the lavender one, I think? If that’s okay.”
Just like Sam had guessed, Philip was cleaning and storing the weapons used earlier. Cas marched straight up to him, slamming him against the nearby wall, not only placing his arm on his neck, but using his angelic strength to keep him immobile. “How dare you treat Dean like that. How dare you say such horrible things to him. You don’t think he’s beating himself up for everything that happened? He was already suffering and you beat him while he was down,” Cas was seething. His vision flared and for a second it was all he could do to not reduce the man before him to ash.
“But, you got Michael to leave,” Sam trails off, unsure of whether it’s a statement, or a question.
He was vaguely aware of footsteps approaching, and he looked up, blinking rapidly to bring the people into focus. “Dean?” the nearest person asked, sounding hopeful.
Cas jabbed a finger at Philip, who sat in pain on the floor, “This disgusting monster has been horribly
for what happened while Lucifer was possessing him?”
“Dean, please tell me.”
Philip shoved him one last time, before quickly leaving the kitchen in a haze of anger. Dean landed on the hot metal of the oven. For a moment, the pain didn’t even register; and when it did, Dean just calmly pulled his hand away, like he wasn’t even aware that the pain was supposed to be
“Hey Sammy,” Dean replied hoarsely, before his legs could no longer hold him and he slid to the ground. Sam had grabbed his arm, steadying him, and suddenly, Dean is aware of everyone’s eyes on him. Taking the time to finally look up, he saw Bobby and his mom staring back at him, cautious hope written on their faces.
“Philip’s still alive,” Sam said, as if it were a pity. “But he’s gone, for good.”
Dean caught the sleeve of his trench coat. “No! Don’t leave,” Dean pleaded desperately, before seemingly realizing what he’d done, letting Cas go, eyes darting to the bed.
. “Dean there is nothing wrong with being with another man. Not for you, not for anyone. Your father was abusive, you can’t believe anything he said.”
“I understand Dean. We’ll go at your pace; however slow you need.” Cas said, voice full of sincerity.
In the past he may have been gone, but today he was here, and Cas was determined to find what was causing Dean such turmoil.
“Sure. You can tell me anything Dean, you know that right?” Sam leaned on the counter, leaving the whole island between them as space.
“But now we have Michael,” Cas reminded.
Cas tilted his head, “But there’s no one else in here. Who else would you have been talking to?”
Sam’s face darkened, and if Cas hadn’t also been so enraged, even he – an angel – would have been terrified. “I want you out of this bunker in one minute, or
“Oh Dean,” Cas whispered, as though he could hear Dean’s thought, and, he supposed, it was very likely he could. Cas took a deep breath. “How about I grab you some pajamas?”
“What did you expect, for me to sleep until the cows came home? I’m still a hunter, Sammy,” Dean joked.
“What is it?” Cas asked worriedly.
“Anything,” Sam asked tentatively.
Sam smiled as his older brother came in the room, “Hey Dean, how’d you sleep?”
He desperately wished they had the archangel blade or Kaia’s spear, anything that could kill Michael and Dean right along with him. He was tired of fighting, tired of being used, tired of being controlled.
“I was drowning – the whole time, Sammy. I felt every second, fighting for air, and I thought – I thought I could make it out but… I couldn’t, I wasn’t strong enough.” Dean took a shuddering breath, downing the whiskey in his cup. “Sam he’s out there, amassing an
“Because it has
but suddenly there was no longer any water pouring down on him. The cold air shocked his skin and finally he was able to take a breath. He felt a thick towel being draped over his huddled, shivering form, and being pulled into a comforting hug, and had the fleeting thought that, whoever this was, he should be embarrassed. He blocked that from his head though, instead figuring it smarter to focus on breathing, coughing out the last of the shower water.
“Ok,” Cas replied, and begun slipping of his shoes and outer layers.
“Not yet, maybe,” Cas agreed, “but someday, you will. Me, Sam, Mary, even Jack, we’ll help you see it.” Dean remained silent, finishing the last of the tea and placing the mug on the bedside table. “I should let you rest,” Cas said, standing to leave.
This wasn’t him. He was Dean Winchester, after everything he’d been through and bounced back from? This should be easy for him, or at least, routine.
Cas shrugged, “I didn’t before I became human. Ever since then, even though my grace is back, I found that it was easier. If I really wanted to, I could usually manage it. Especially if I haven’t for a long while or have been injured in a fight. Plus, being with you… well, it made me feel safe.”
Dean raised his eyebrows, “
Dean wandered the hallways. “Sam? Cas?” He called, finding both of them already in the library.
He was ashamed, really, thought it ridiculous he couldn’t step into the water. It was near impossible to drown in the shower after all.
your brother, for
Dean swiped at the tears on his face, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry Cas. I’ve disappointed you again – gods why can’t I just stop hurting people?” His voice full of anger.
“You know, I’m just fired up, I mean look – we got Jack back. When was the last time we had a big, no strings-attached win like that?” Dean asked.
Ok,” Dean breathed a tear slipping down his face. Cas’ thumb softly swiped it away, and Dean
His phone rings, taking him out of his reverie. He swipes it open immediately, already smiling. “Sammy!” he says. “What’s up! How’s my little tiny baby brother handling his first semester of college?”
“So, Jess, tell me about yourself,” he begins. She covers all the standard territory – freshman from Palo Alto (it’s one of her friends from high school who’s throwing the house party they’re headed to tonight), interested in a pre-med track, loves dogs and hiking, knows Brady from summer camp, and initially bonded with Sam over their shared love of Lord of the Rings (gross). She’s halfway through telling them about her internship with Stanford Hospital when the door opens once again and Dean looks up, unguarded.
Charlie is halfway through telling Dean about the time that she and Cas tried to road trip to Vegas together when she interrupts herself to turn to Cas. “Please don’t hate me,” she begs. “I just remembered something that’s going to make you kind of mad.”
“Hell yeah it is, dude! I forgot that they do pie here. Thank you,” he says, abandoning his burger and digging into the sugary apples. “Best dinner ever.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas groans, but nods his head anyway.
“Dean-o!” Gabe cries, flinging his arms open, oblivious to the tiny explosion that is happening inside of Dean’s head. “I hear you took care of my little bro’s bike last week!” He claps one hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezes Castiel’s cheek with the other. “Nothing but the best for my sweet little punim.”
Bobby was never the biggest fan of John Winchester’s soccer plans for his son. From the early days when John would make Dean put in extra practice hours in the freezing dark days of Kansas winters to the final seasons of high school when John would show up, drunk and rambling, to harass opponents and their coaches, Bobby had never quite approved. He was supportive, sure, but Dean could tell that there was a slight bit of relief in his voice when Dean had called last spring to announce his retirement.
Ellen, now busy doing an inventory of the parts that were delivered the day before, looks over her shoulder at him, unimpressed. “I didn’t say I missed having a kiss-ass in the shop, Dean. Just someone who knows a wrench from his left hand.”
Jo gives him a look. “The two of you are basically joined at the hip these days. Of course he likes you.”
Dean leans back, rubbing his chin. “Now there’s a good point, Cas. Perhaps the restaurant is owned by a collection of Norms. Just many Norms in a restaurant ownership group.”
“Okay Hallmark. Still not going.”
Sam laughs good-naturedly. “Well, I apologize for my brother re-naming you, but glad to have you both here. Can I take a bag?”
He’s at Jo’s for the pregame when Cas arrives with Charlie, of course wearing that damned trench coat with the same white button down and grey slacks from Palo Alto underneath. This time, Dean smiles. Cas looks
“How have you been enjoying your classes?” Cas asks him. “Anything good?”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Bad goalie pun. I know you can do better.”
Reflecting on that now, he opens up the student portal to check his class requests for the millionth time this morning, even though it’s barely 10:00 AM and the Pitzer dining hall’s Saturday brunch is looking like a ghost town while the rest of the school sleeps in. He absentmindedly scoops a lukewarm bite of scrambled eggs into his mouth as he scrolls through the class requests he has submitted. He’s trying hard to get into Ghostly Machines, rumored to be the best – or at least strangest – humanities GE on campus. Jo somehow managed to get in last spring and told Dean that her final was a twenty-page paper on summoning the energy of dead spirits. Dean is stoked.
Jo gives him a sidelong glance. “I’ll let you know as soon as I have a conclusive update, but don’t hold your breath.”
“No silly, we’re taking Cas to Norms. He’s never been, remember? The whole thing about how he loves diners so we couldn’t believe that he hadn’t tried Norms? We talked about it for like ten full minutes, dude. How much did you drink last night? Anyway, you gotta get a move on, buddy. We were supposed to be there twenty minutes ago!”
Dean grins back. “Benny! How are you?” He gets up to shake Benny’s hand and is surprised to be pulled into a full-on bear hug.
They spill out into the night at about 11:00, and Dean orders a Lyft on his phone. Sam beats him to the passenger seat and he ends up squished in the back with Jess and Cas. Jess insists that Cas’ hips are slimmer than hers, so he sits in the middle with his full body pressed against Dean’s. Dean doesn’t mind, though, because now he’s drunk and it’s kind of nice to lean into Cas’ body and let the warmth spread through him. He’s just a little bit disappointed when they pull up outside of a beautiful, two-story Palo Alto home and have to join the world again.
Being back here, though… there’s one person who’s hard not to remember. Leaning over, Dean grabs a picture frame off of the nightstand. One nightstand is dedicated to pictures of family – Mary and John with baby Sam and toddler Dean, Mary teaching Dean how to play piano, and Bobby proudly showing off Dean’s high school diploma at graduation while Dean smiles bashfully next to him. The other side has just one frame, and it’s the one that Dean is holding now.
“Hey Winchester,” calls a familiar voice rounding the corner to the bike shed. Craning his neck, Dean catches sight of Jo Harvelle, his favorite of the girls who intern with the athletic trainer. Like him, Jo used to be a soccer player, but after one too many concussions in her freshman year she was forced to retire after just one season. Instead of giving up on it completely, she started working towards a kinesiology degree and interning with the trainer during her downtime.
“We uh. We don’t have fraternities,” Dean stammers, still frozen in place.
Dean opens his eyes to confirm his suspicions. Indeed, he and Cas are still squeezed into Brady’s twin bed, locked into a tight spooning position. His arm is wrapped around Cas’ waist and tucked under his ribs, and Cas’ legs are tangled in Dean’s. Cas is letting out light snores and Dean briefly has the thought that it’s kind of cute. Like, in the way that you think your best friend is cute because you’re best friends.
“I have recovered,” he declares, pushing himself back up into a seated position. “Thank you for enabling my access to these life-changing nutrients.”
Dean leans his seat back all the way and puts on his sunglasses. “Don’t talk. Just drive.”
“Regardless,” Dean says, grabbing a napkin out of the dispenser and pulling a pen from his backpack, “perhaps a film club of our very own is in order. Jo and I have been trying to make it happen for years because she hasn’t seen anything and I’ve seen everything, but we could never get the soccer guys to buy in.”
“Can I… help you?” Dean asks, clearing his throat. Why is he so nervous? He’s not nervous. He just hasn’t been working at the bike shop very long. Oh God. Where does he usually put his hands when he talks to a customer? Next to the cash register? Does that seem possessive of the register? Oh no. He settles for sticking them both in his pockets.
, comes the instantaneous response. Dean chuckles. Few things are more predictable than his relationship with Sam.
“Dean, you’re drunk. I mean, me too, but you’re really drunk. Let’s go home.”
“Oh, yeah. Uh, of course.”
“There’s no apostrophe,” Castiel says, interrupting him.
“And, as always, a shout-out to my main man Norm and his Lumberjack Breakfast and his--”
Dean blushes and drops his gaze to the grass. “No. Sorry. It was a dumb question. And it’s none of my beeswax. I just – well, we just – we had a moment. Or, he had a moment. In Palo Alto. And it made me wonder. About him.”
“I really can’t, Dean-o. I really can’t.”
One more after this!
Sam fills the silence on the way to the café, telling Dean excitedly about the dates that he and Jess have gone on since Fall Break. Jess continues to sound perfect for him – she loves hiking, camping, reading, dogs, volunteering, and trying new vegetables. Apparently they go to the farmers market every weekend to pick up kale and oranges. Barf.
Dean can see people silhouetted in windows and doorways, gathered in small groups and spilling down the driveway. Sam pulls them through the crowd to the kitchen, where Jess introduces them to the host, a redhead by the name of Ed. Dean, not particularly caring about who is hosting beyond knowing what alcohol they have made available, shrugs and takes a shot of some kind of clear liquor from the countertop.
“Yes, I’ve put my demon-escaping days behind me,” Dean jokes, beginning to put the groceries away in the narrow cabinets.
“You ever think about the fact that being into dudes might not be a bad thing? Maybe crisis isn’t the right word. Maybe it’s just neutral. Or even positive.”
He leads them through a courtyard, up two flights of stairs, and down a long hallway before stopping in front of a door that says “Sam and Brady!” inside of a yellow school bus. The dorm is fairly quiet; it seems that most of Sam’s peers have left campus for fall break. Dean feels a brief pang of guilt for making his brother spend this time with him, but pushes it down as hard as he can.
Cas pulls out of Gabe’s grasp and huffs out a sigh. “We are not related by blood, Gabriel. I have reminded you of that many times.”
“You might, a little. I have to back out of our fall break plans. Dorothy surprised me with plane tickets to go visit her in Seattle.”
As it always does when he experiences more than ten seconds of silence, his mind jumpstarts another panic spiral about Cas. He actually hasn’t been able to stop thinking about him since they arrived back home to Claremont and went their separate ways back to their dorm rooms. Dean has no idea what real Cas did that night, but Fantasy Cas spent a long time with Dean in the shower and then back in his bed, panting and writhing and finishing off his striptease in a hundred different ways.
After a few glugs of the icy cold water, Dean replaces the cap on the bottle and tosses it back towards his backpack. He leans over the window of the bike shop and gazes around at his surroundings, taking in the desert landscape and distant mountains of Claremont, California. It is still as sleepy and beautiful as it had been the first day that he set foot on campus, when Coach Alastair had him come visit as part of the recruitment process.
Standing next to Gabe is a familiar pair of the bluest eyes he’s ever seen. In the harsh light of this dorm room after the soft evening tones outside, they seem supercharged, like an ever-expanding black hole sucking in everything in the immediate vicinity. Somewhere, vaguely, in the back of his mind he has a memory of Sam correcting him – black holes don’t suck anything, they just attract – so maybe it’s just that he’s never felt an attraction like this before.
He plugs his phone in on the nightstand and grabs his laptop from his backpack, then flops down on his bed. As the harsh afternoon light softens into an evening glow, he works through an article analysis for his Psychology of Aging class, a blog post for his Religion and Trauma class, a presentation for the Ghosts and the Machines class that he did ultimately get into, and a long reading on Gaventian power analysis for his Race, Nation, and Baseball class.
“Sure, Dean. Whatever you say.”
Thankfully, the garage still remains a sight for sore eyes as he rounds the last bend off a dusty road in Lawrence and pulls into the asphalt lot in front of the garage. He sits for a moment after he turns the engine off, appreciating the silence and motionlessness for the first time in well over twelve hours. He had stopped for a night in Denver, camped out in his car for the night, and is looking forward to sleeping in his own real bed tonight.
“That wasn’t my question,” says Dean, staring down at the grass and picking at the blades closest to him. “I know I’m straight. I’m just wondering about Cas.”
Dean and Gabriel look at each other, grin, because this is their damn song and they’re sure not going to waste it. Moving into the highest range they muster, they belt out an off-key version of “All I Want for Christmas is You” and grab Cas and Jo by the hands, pull them into a frenetic and off-beat dance circle. Meg and Charlie have already gone, left the party together a few minutes after arriving, and Dean can’t wait to hear about it tomorrow. When the song finishes Dean is panting, beaming, holding Cas’ hand on one side and Jo’s on the other, and he can’t stop laughing.
The wide-eyed gaze wears off well into hour three, when they stop for gas. They manage to keep up a steady conversation about classes, movies, and cars, and Cas doesn’t once violate Dean’s “no complaining about the music” rule. He even surprises Dean with a maximum-volume rendition of Back in Black as they cruise through Gilroy.
“Uh, Dean. Dean Winchester.”
His delivery is so dry that Dean almost can’t tell for sure if he’s joking. When they both turn back to face the TV, Dean tries hard not to notice where their shoulders press together.
“A lady can do whatever she damn well pleases in a post-third wave society.”
“Deeeean,” Gabe argues. “Just because you got your heart broke by Lady Soccer and also a million other women doesn’t mean you stop trying!”
“There’s no apostrophe. It’s just ‘NORMS.’ Stylized, certainly, but I am not convinced that the restaurant chain is of or belonging to a man named Norman.”
That works for Dean – he had packed the car last night and didn’t need to go back to his room before they hit the road. He stuffs the rest of the eggs and toast into his mouth as fast as he can and wipes his mouth with a napkin that Cas hands him. “I can take our plates and then we can go?” Cas asks, already standing up to do so. Dean nods.
“A lady thing,” Gabe says knowingly, waggling his eyebrows and nudging Castiel, whose expression remains stoic.
But he has to admit, he’s having a lot of fun with the guy. Cas, in an extremely unexpected twist, is one of the funniest people Dean has ever met. What he had initially perceived as some kind of uncomfortable aloofness is actually the driest, sharpest sense of humor he’s ever seen. And they never run out of things to talk about, either. Jo was right that it’s surprising they hadn’t run into each other before on campus - they like all the same movies, have taken a bunch of the same classes at different times, and have all the same favorite spots on campus.
He shoves his slacks down and suddenly he is standing in his underwear in front of Dean. Who, huh, wouldn’t have expected him to be a boxers guy. His chest heaves with the effort of this dramatic disrobing, and Dean is privately extremely impressed by the muscle tone of the abs that he can see in his peripheral vision as he keeps his gaze trained very intentionally on Cas’ face.
Oh God, brunch. Oh, he had forgotten about this particular evil. “What do you mean, your car? Are we going to south campus Pomona or something?”
That’s why he’s so caught off-guard when, out of seemingly nowhere, Benny appears in front of him. “Dean Winchester, as I live and breathe,” he says, grinning, and throwing Dean a wink.
“So,” Dean starts. “You, uh. You think I might be into dudes?”
“Hello to you too,” Aaron mumbles in his ear. “Took my advice to HAGS, I guess.”
“Never mind. Look, I don’t know, man. He’s funny and interesting and weird as hell, and he’s been making my year a hell of a lot more fun than I was expecting. But I’m a little worried about him like, liking me. Because we have a good thing going with this friendship and I don’t want that to get messed up because he can’t keep it in his pants.”
“Yes, that’s one of my favorite comparison points for frankly any piece of media. That and any connection to the book of Revelation.”
While he doesn’t want to know more about the suitemates and their sexual escapades, Dean finds himself inexplicably drawn in by Castiel’s general aura of mystery. He asks Cas everything he can think of – parents (distant, disciplined, a lawyer and a professor), siblings (several by blood and several by marriage, including Gabe), childhood (quiet and largely uneventful), and future aspirations (LA, for grad school, and then not sure) – in the short spaces when they are alone together before Jo and Gabriel arrive. This becomes less possible once Gabriel starts hosting, which is how Dean finds himself asking Cas whether he has dinner plans for the next day during a bathroom break.
Dean lets out a whimpered, “Congratulations.”
Dean smiles. “I know.”
The silence stretches between them and Dean feels like he’s drowning in it. He grasps wildly for conversation topics, but everything he has to say feels boring. He tries to think as he vaguely watches the silent TV screen, which seems to be a show about vampires in love. Finally, he settles on the safest territory he can think of. “So, where are your roommates tonight?” he asks, gesturing to the many empty seats. “Weren’t interested in a Nicolas Cage deep dive?”
Dean, for his part, feels pretty pleasantly surprised as well.
Dean hangs up with Sam, reminding him once again of the value of a good lay and making him promise to call again soon. As he does so, he notices that he has four new texts waiting.
“Okay,” says Cas amicably. “I would love to join you for your trip.”
Dean laughs a little bit too hard and makes weird eye contact with Cas. He doesn’t know when to look away, so he just keeps maintaining until he feels Jo’s elbow in his ribs. “Uh, what?” he asks, wondering what he missed.
And then Cas leans in for the lime and before Dean knows what he’s doing, he spits the lime out and pulls Cas’ head down with both hands and finally, finally feel’s Cas’ mouth against his. And then in rapid succession, feels Cas’ tongue against his mouth and then Cas’ tongue against his tongue and then they’re full-on making out in front of a room full of their friends. Dean pulls Cas in deeper, wraps an arm around his back, feels Cas’ fingers thread through his hair, other hand on Dean’s bare waist, and Jesus Christ that should not be so hot. Somewhere, vaguely, Dean thinks he can hear Jo cheering.
, in fact, but he has to keep up the pretence. For who, he isn't sure.
"Freddy might not-" Sam just raises his eyebrows and Dean scowls. He doesn't know how he let Sam make such a dumb bet in the first place - he'd only agreed so Sam would stop trying to talk about it. It's TV. What does Dean care who they want to PG-13 make-out with?
And you know what? Sure. Maybe he did have a little..
"Ah. It's a phallic symbol. I understand. Like the popsicle, right?"
"Dean, it's not an insult, y'know. I'm just saying he was looking at him."
"That was a terrible idea."
They don't have sex, though. Not that Dean hasn't thoug-
"Yeah, exactly. Plus I'm sure it's scarier, too. You don't know if the other guy's gonna be interested. They might even react badly."
"He's a kid. Kids wanna find out about this stuff. He kept asking questions.. I didn't wanna say much in case I fucked it up."
Sam exhales another chuckle. Dean resists the urge to whack him around the head.
They arrived in town early this morning, fresh on the trail of three unexplained deaths in the woods in the last two months. Everyone they came across seemed to have a different story about what it was (“It was a tall shadowy man” “no it was two” “one was definitely a woman”), and so they’d planned to go into the woods overnight to have a look for themselves.
"I think you're probably right, Cas. See? You're learning." It's practiced kindness from Dean, more a show for Sam than anything else, but it makes Cas preen in a way that makes him feel like an asshole.
"I'm sorry, Dean, I'm afraid we will never see eye to eye on this issue."
"No problem. You looked like you needed a refill, I couldn't let you get one from anyone else."
Dean nods, and he can feel the faintest of blushes threatening to form on his cheeks again. He swallows a big gulp of his beer and it dies quickly, even as Cas refuses to take his eyes off him.
"He- it's a movie, Cas."
“OK.”
"Cas may or may not want to bone Justin Timberlake." He avoids looking back at him.
Dean mulls this over as he pulls his laptop out of his backpack and opens up a Netflix window, then grabs the pie off of the nightstand. Leaning back into the pillows, he takes a big bite of coconut cream and lets the soothing sounds of Doctor Sexy wash over him. He breathes deeply and thinks to himself that there truly is no place like home.
Jo cheers and pours the tequila, again bathing her sheets in it. Cas takes a breath, licks the salt, and holy shit even those two seconds of Cas’ tongue on Dean’s skin send a jolt of electricity through him and he doesn’t even have time to react before Cas is sucking the tequila down and Dean is maybe going to die from this? But damn, what a way to go.
“I said party and you inferred fundraising event for a Republican senator? No, you’re not wearing that.”
“Castiel,” Meg and Charlie agree, looking at each other and then beginning to chant. “Cas-ti-el! Cas-ti-el!”
“What happened to the eggs?” Dean asks, aghast, as he surveys what looks like the entire contents of the pastry buffet on a single plate.
Dean nods, trying to keep a sympathetic expression, but for some reason all he can focus on is that Cas is into dudes. “And you really don’t see it?” he asks. “Cas being into me?”
friend.”
Heaving a sigh, Dean reaches down to where he’s stuffed his backpack in the corner of the shop and pulls out his water bottle. It’s the fancy kind that keeps water cold for hours and hours, a gift from his baby brother Sam when he got into Claremont McKenna. It has seen better days and by now bears the dings and scratches of three years of bouncing around in various sports bags, backpacks, and the trunk of Dean’s 1967 Chevy Impala.
Sam’s face reddens. “She’s not my girlfriend, exactly, just a girl I like, and Dean, you can’t embarrass me, she’s really cool and smart and pretty and nice and I want her to like me.”
He shakes his head and stops himself mid-sentence.
Sam lets out a groan loud enough to be heard through the walls. “Dean, I just got home and I’m tired,” he complains.
The door bursts open and Dean startles, almost shattering the cologne bottle. “Jesus, Sammy,” he growls. “You don’t come with a warning bell yet?”
Dean has been back at school for about two weeks, and has only seen Cas once for a rushed movie night. Everyone is stressed with finals and thesis deadlines coming up, so it makes sense, but it makes Dean feel squirmy and stressed that he hasn’t yet been able to say anything to Cas about his Thanksgiving revelation.
“They are cool,” Cas responds. “They are very cool. They have been very good to me since I arrived here, so it does not bother me that they’re often gone. Even though I do sometimes wish for a bit more company.”
Dean can feel his brother rolling his eyes as he responds. “There are plenty of cute, interesting, smart, fun girls here, Dean. That’s why you’re never allowed to visit. I want to actually be friends with them.”
As Sam chats excitedly about a variety of nuts and seeds that Dean will never learn, care about, or sample, Dean guides him towards the door and grabs both of their coats from the coatrack. They trudge through the rows of used cars behind the shop to the lot where Dean left the Impala and slide into the seats.
Sometimes they even start early and fit in two movies back-to-back; on these nights, Dean often ends up drunk and sleepy and convincing himself to walk out that door instead of sinking into the loveseat that has become his standard seating assignment in Cas’ suite. On these nights, he often also ends up texting Aaron for a quick exchange of lazy handjobs before falling into a drunken sleep.
Benny leans in and stares at Dean. His eye contact is intense, and though it is not as intense as Cas can be, there is still something similar about the energy of these blue eyes. “Dean, you sucked me off before you ever went down on a girl. We fucked in the back of my pickup before I went to home base with my own actual girlfriend. Who is now my fiancée, by the way, though not that you asked.”
Finally a healthy serving of witty banter and Representation for Salads.
He lifts his torso for Cas to pull his shirt all the way off and looks down to see Cas trailing kisses down his abdomen, and then – oh, this motherfucker. Cas looks Dean in the eye and drags his teeth down, down to the edge of Dean’s waistband, and Dean gulps. “May I?” Cas whispers. Dean nods.
Today, 2:36 AM:
The second the door Is closed, Dean all but sprints to the fridge. Just as he had hoped, hidden in a small pink box in the back is a thick slice of coconut cream pie from the local diner. Nothing in this world has ever been so good to him as the diner is, the place where he and Sam would go to do homework and scarf down burgers and sample every single kind of pie known to man.
Sam and Jess are following the conversation like a tennis match, but at this point Sam stands up and pulls Jess along with him. “Um, we’re going to wait outside,” he says. “Y’all can let us know when you’re ready.”
Luckily, a full week later, Dean is feeling much more generous towards the bottle and is even looking forward to a cocktail and movie night later this evening. He and Jo are pregaming with dinner, currently sitting under a tree that is connected to its neighbor by a slackline. One grassy Mound over is a large group passing around a very obvious joint. Someone has brought a tiny Chihuahua and Dean has been entertaining Jo with impersonations of the dog when he suddenly has a thought.
Benny picks up his coffee mug and raises it in a salute. “Ah, you’re finally having your big gay panic. I was waiting for this.”
“Shut up, Dean,” Cas and Charlie say together.
“Cas, you’re my favorite,” he sighs. “My very favorite. Don’t tell Sam.” And, actually, “Or Gabe. Or Jo.”
Halfway through dinner, Bobby gets a call that his towing services are needed in town. He gives Dean an apologetic look. “I’m sorry to do this to you, son,” he says, shrugging on his jacket. “On your first night back and everything. Well, either way, take a look in the fridge. It was supposed to be a surprise welcome-home gift.”
Well, he thinks, if he doesn’t get to sleep then neither does Sam. “Sammy,” he yells, banging on the wall. “Up and at ‘em. We’re going for a drive.”
It isn’t until after Dean has finished half of his hot coffee, black, that Sam turns the question back. “So,” he begins. “How’s Castiel?”
“Are you doing okay?” Cas asks him, and is that his hand on Dean’s face? Dean leans into the cool, dry, palm, humming happily and feeling a sudden sense of peace.
Cas, for his part, doesn’t seem to actually be that much less drunk than Dean. He has joined Dean on the bed and is laying back across it with his eyes closed, pressing the heels his palms into them as if that might fix them somehow.
Not to mention that at some point things with Benny became just a little bit too complicated. It was easier to stop talking, easier to cut him out, than to navigate and understand exactly what roles they played in each other’s lives. Benny had met Andrea and Dean had been starting to hook up with Lisa, and every phone call had started to get stiffer with longer silences until one day Dean just stopped answering.
“Have you given him a blowjob outside of a fast food establishment yet? Or am I special?”
Grumpy Cas giving orders makes Dean just about melt. He complies immediately, turning on his side, and then realizes that there is still not that much space and his only real option is to fully spoon Cas. So he does. He wiggles into place and slots his left arm under Cas’ neck, his right arm tucking around his waist to hold him securely in place. His nose ends up buried in Cas’ soft, fragrant hair, and despite the tickle he breathes deeply to savor it. Cas, for his part, is already asleep.
Dean dives into a retelling of his most recent misadventures in Ghostly Machines, which had been spent on an experiment to try and summon his classmates’ special supernatural energies today. The entire class had had to channel their focus into a small side table that the professor brought in specifically for this purpose – so they could try lifting it with their minds. “I really can’t believe I’m getting credit for this, honestly,” Dean finishes. Cas laughs.
Twenty-five minutes later, Dean is making final decisions about whether to go with a leather jacket or just cuff the sleeves on his green plaid flannel. Cas is still in the shower, drowning his sugary sins in Sam’s unscented Dove bar soap, but Dean can hear Sam nervously shouting a five-minute warning to him through the wall. On the dresser, Dean sees a few bottles of cologne; sniffing one, he deems it acceptable and dabs it around his neck and pits.
“Sit anywhere,” Cas says, gesturing towards the pillows and poufs. “And would you like a drink? We have Jo’s drinks or any kind of alcoholic seltzer.”
“Oh my gosh, Castiel!” she squeals, throwing her (admittedly sweaty, Dean would know) arms around the boy who has just arrived at the bike shop.
Dean lifts his eyebrows and leans back. Cas has a girlfriend?
“So,” Benny says, leaning back and stretching his arm out across the back of the vinyl booth. “How have you been? What’s going on? I have to assume that this recent contact is not coming out of nowhere.”
Dean pulls out his phone and hovers over the contact. Trying not to second guess it, he clicks the call icon. The phone only rings once before he hears that familiar Louisiana drawl.
Phone in one pocket, ID and room key in the other, he pours himself a plastic Arrowhead water bottle of vodka and cranberry juice and then adds a lime wedge to class it up. He puts the rest of the vodka and juice and some assorted other beverages in a paper Vons bag to bring to Jo’s room so he isn’t showing up empty-handed. Locking his room behind him, he walks as quickly as he can to Jo’s dorm at Scripps, keeping his head down so that he doesn’t have to converse with any other revelers.
and if there’s anything Dean hates, it’s change.
“But I’m having fun! I’m dancing! I love parties!”
Jo nods and looks away, back over to the tiny Chihuahua, which is now performing tricks for its owner to the delight of her friends. For a moment, she’s silent.
Gabe leans back, grinning. “6:01.”
Except that he does. When he started thinking that maybe he didn’t want to play soccer anymore, it was too painful to spend time with someone who knew him down to his core and was unfailing in his stability. He needed to be around people who would embrace whatever flights of fancy he took, encourage chaotic turns, and not care about the consequences. He knew that Benny wouldn’t judge him, since that wasn’t Benny’s style, but he also knew exactly what Benny would say and he was scared to hear it.
“What if I told you that it’s not just going to be soccer at this one? I’m inviting women’s rugby and as always, guests are welcome.”
And that’s a whole other spiral, isn’t it, the fact that he finally has these great friends he loves and in a few months, they’ll all be graduating and moving on. Cas has grand plans to go to grad school in LA, become a licensed social worker, and get a job for the county helping kids. Jo is planning to move to New York, where she already has a cushy consulting gig lined up, so she can make big money and help her mom retire early. Gabriel is moving abroad, planning to teach English in Japan for a few years and then see where the wind takes him next.
“I won’t hate you, Charlie. That is an extreme emotion of which I am simply not capable.”
“Last semester I took a class called ‘Pottery and the Art of Love,’” he admits. “Since then, I have not felt that I am in a position to judge.”
He knows that if he stays in his room, he’ll spiral. It’s barely 4:30, but he swings his legs off the bed and changes into an old white bro tank and bright red shorts for the occasion. He glances in the mirror, realizes he looks like Zac Efron in the Baywatch remake, and decides he doesn’t care.
Dean snorts. “Well, Charlie, it is wonderful to meet you. Sorry we’ve been stealing Cas away for movie nights.”
Dean rolls his eyes and walks over to his duffel bag. “I get it, Tyra Banks. You’re America’s next top model. Either way, you’re not wearing that to a house party in this day and age. Here, take these.” He tosses Cas a pair of grey shorts and a black t-shirt. He knows that they aren’t exactly the same size, but they should fit.
She rolls her eyes. “Okay, dork. All I’m saying is, you could stand to encounter the feminine touch again.”
“Please, for the love of God and all things holy, do not call yourself that.”
Dean scrambles out of the recliner, knocking his empty beer bottle to the ground, and takes three big strides to get to Bobby. “Let me get those, Bobby,” he says, taking the heavily loaded grocery bags out of Bobby’s arms and carrying them to the kitchen. He knows that Bobby isn’t “old” and would never dare to say anything to that effect, but he still has the instinct to give back whenever he can to this man who has become his father.
you? I have been wondering about the owner of that car for years. What is she, a ’66? Chevy Impala? Back when they still built them to last.”
Had to put this at the end this time because of spoilies, but in the real-life situation this chapter is based on, the movie we watched was It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown! And it was our thighs pressing together not shoulders because we were sitting side by side squished together on a bed with all our friends. And an hour after the movie ended, the sophomores next door yelled at us for having fun too loudly because we were singing along to The Monster Mash. :)
Dean whistles, not
“Jo,” he says, sitting up. “Do you think Cas likes me?”
Cas steps forward and shakes Sam’s hand. “You can call me either. I have adjusted to the nickname at this point.”
“Morning, sunshine. How are you feeling?”
Jo groans. “I’m sorry I tried to unscrew all the bolts with my hands. In my defense, I thought I could do it and I know I’m the strongest bike shop employee.”
Dean gestures helplessly, not sure where to start.
Today, 1:13 AM:
Jo’s brow furrows and she cocks her head. She takes Dean in with an appraising look, and a question seems to flash behind her eyes and disappear again in an instant. “You mean romantically?” she asks carefully.
“Shut up,” Dean says, not wanting to talk because of the aforementioned thinking and changing, and throws his tank top somewhere in the direction of the floor. Aaron complies, pressing his mouth to Dean’s and pulling him down on top of him. Dean’s hands find Aaron’s, pressing them into the bed as he feels Aaron lightly nip at his bottom lip. He can feel his heart beating faster, feeling so goddamn alive, grinding his hips down and getting a heady rush as Aaron hardens beneath him.
With each assignment completed, Dean’s mind wanders a little bit less. He wishes he had made time for a quick run before his homework, since the events of the last forty-eight hours are enough to fill his thoughts for at least a few miles. He still can’t shake the anxiety he feels about the whole Aaron situation and idly wonders if he should close the book on that for good.
Dean opens his mouth but gets cut off by Castiel. “We would be delighted to meet your friend, Sam,” Cas says, shooting a look at Dean. “Despite what your brother may be demonstrating right now, he is very proud of you and I’m sure he looks forward to behaving himself tomorrow night.”
Mostly, though, the last few weeks have been filled with Not Talking About It. Not with Sam, not with Cas, not with Jo, and certainly not with Gabriel. No, Dean is keeping a tight lid on whatever happened in Palo Alto. Just because he thinks about it almost every day doesn’t mean that he has to
Benny laughs. “Dean, if there’s anything I’m sure of, it’s that yeah, you might be into dudes. So tell me about the lucky fella who’s inspiring this journey.”
Cas leads them over to what is clearly meant to be the living room area of the suite. Someone has installed a series of mismatched bean bags and floor pillows. Along one wall, Dean sees a set of four stadium-style seats bolted together. Across the room, a small loveseat has been decorated with embroidered hearts and stamped-on Cupids. The far wall holds a TV that is playing muted CW shows with closed captioning. Aside from the eclectic decor, Dean is pleasantly surprised by how clean and functional the suite appears to be.
The energy feels tense through dinner at a local pizza joint, but Sam and Jess fill the empty space with light banter and entertaining stories about their new professors, classmates, and friends. Sam tells his standard three not-very-funny date stories and Jess still laughs at all of them, so Dean concludes that she must be his soulmate.
“No,” Dean groans, rolling over and pulling his pillow over his head. His mouth tastes like dirty socks and his eyes feel gritty and dry. He puked at some point in the night, just got up and got it over with, so his stomach is okay for the time being but he doesn’t feel like he should depend on that continuing to be true.
“Dean, this is Castiel,” Jo gushes. “He’s the one who gave that phenomenal presentation in my apocalyptic literature class last year. Remember? The whole thing about the doomsday preppers and their implications for international relations?”
Cas must have plugged Dean’s phone in by the door, since Dean is quite confident that he did not have the mental presence to do so on his own when they got back last night. He grabs it and scrolls through his texts. One from Gabe, asking how the trip is going. A couple from various friends who are still on campus, including Aaron, wondering if he’s around. And then, from Sam:
Sam laughs. “Tiny?”
Dean grabs a fork, heaves his duffel and backpack over his shoulders, and takes the pink box with him upstairs to the bedroom he has come to know as his. When he was growing up, Bobby always kept the room available in case Mary had the late shift at the hospital and John took a late shift at the bar, but it still just felt like Bobby’s spare room in Dean’s head. When his parents died, though, there was no question in Dean’s mind where he and Sam were going to live.
Dean takes a deep breath and carefully tries again. “Benny, I think I’m in love with my best friend,” he says. “And I think my best friend is in love with me back.”
Charlie furrows her brow and looks at Cas expectantly. Her jaw drops and she yelps, “You’ve trained him out of that, too? He never lets me call him Cas!”
Bobby is out picking up a parts delivery in town, but Dean stops in the shop anyway to say hi to all of his favorites. He chats for a couple minutes with Rufus, waves to Garth, and high-fives Ash as he passes. Once he has made the rounds, he heads for the back of the property and the trim, stout 3-bed 2-bath that he will forever think of as home.
“I was tired too. So tired, in fact, that I was asleep. Come on, get up. We can get coffee, my treat. I’ll even get you one of those green juices from that hippie joint on Main.”
Charlie and Dean look at each other and burst out laughing.
Cas surveys the liquor and then, without a moment of hesitation, downs it with no chaser. Jo cheers and hands him another. “Okay, and now this one, Dean, you join too!”
Jo nods and throws a quick middle finger over her shoulder to Dean. “Catch ya on the flipside, weirdo!” she calls as she trudges off towards Styrofoam scrambled eggs and stale blueberry scones. Dean, for some reason, feels extremely jealous.
They begin to wander outside in the still-hot Claremont evening, feeling unstoppable with the alcohol coursing through their veins. Dean can’t remember what he ate for dinner, or if he ate dinner, so Jo hands him a party-size bag of Doritos for the journey. She is their intrepid leader, guiding them towards the party and not letting them stop even when Anna and Dean start laughing so hard that they can’t remember why they’re laughing and have to sit down on the hot pavement for a break.
But he shuts it down immediately, taking a swig out of the Solo cup that somehow found its way into his hand, drinking in the tall, lithe body and messy black hair and swallowing them down with the jungle juice.
The rest of the day passes in the typical routine of a Saturday afternoon with few responsibilities. Dean swings by the mailroom to pick up his check, runs to Target to wander the aisles, stops by Vons for some alcohol and mixers, and ends up back in his dorm room staring at the empty walls. 6:01 starts way earlier than most parties, and he knows that Gabe and the boys probably started drinking not long after brunch, but he wants to linger in this pre-party moment as long as he can.
Jo leads him up through the cactus-lined gravel paths of Pitzer, past the murals, around the back of a courtyard that Dean once puked in on a particularly out-of-hand Halloween and arrives at what seems like the millionth orange building on this campus. Someone is leaving when they get to the gate, so Jo holds it open as Dean and Anna slip past her to get inside.
“Man, you can’t wear a trench coat to a house party! You’re going to drink in those clothes? And dance?”
They arrive at the diner within a few minutes and Dean still does not feel prepared for the experience. He elects to keep his sunglasses on even as they spot Cas and Jo in a booth by the window and slide into their seats. The diner smells like a familiar mix of coffee, grease, and salt, and Dean’s stomach rumbles in anticipation. He tries not to pick at the old, chipping vinyl of the booth, or get distracted by the intensity of Castiel’s gaze from across the table. He’s glad he picked the spot next to Jo.
The best relationships start by accidental invitation, and this one is no exception :)
Castiel arrives two minutes later with a salad in one hand and a small bowl of apple pie in the other. “I remembered that you said it was your favorite,” he says by way of explanation. Dean’s eyes widen.
They’re stumbling up the stairs and down the hall and Dean is having trouble remembering which direction standing is supposed to go, and when he grabs for maybe the floor or maybe the wall he ends up with that cool, dry hand in his hand again and then an arm wraps around him and a nose is in his hair and he hears, whispered, “We have to be quiet,” over and over like a drunken prayer.
Oh no, oh no no no, this cannot be possible, cannot be right or real. What? Gabe is somehow related to Jo’s friend? How? How could it have not come up in four years of friendship that Gabe has a brother whom some people might find themselves attracted to in a frankly uncontrollable way?
Dean chokes on his water and splutters, “What?”
It’s not that Dean is homophobic at all. He’d definitely consider himself an ally. He just knows that he’s not gay, plain and simple. It’s fine to hook up with a dude – it is college after all – but Dean’s not about to make it part of his identity. He likes women, and women like him, and he hasn’t had any problem with finding a steady supply of them on the weekends when he doesn’t feel like seeing Aaron.
They stop at a liquor store so that Dean can pick up some alcohol for the night, and then start pregaming in Sam’s room. Dean feels the energy lighten with each drink that he and Castiel take, so he begins some heavier pours into their respective glasses. By the time they start getting ready to leave, he and Cas are both, well, drunk.
Dean can’t say no, hopeless to resist anything that this man asks of him, squeezes side by side with him in this college dorm extra-long twin (hey-oh! Just like Cas!), wondering if he’s breathing weird or too fast or too slow. How do people even breathe anyway? Should he hold his breath? Match it to Cas’? Both of those seem like extremely weird options and he just doesn’t–
The phone is halfway through receiving what is, according to the screen, a thirteenth call attempt when Dean picks up. “Gabriel, I am not in the fucking mood,” he warns.
Apparently best friends who cuddle, which is an interesting development. As carefully as possible, Dean unhooks himself from Cas and slides out of the bed. He notices immediately that Sam’s bed is empty and smiles to himself. Sammy’s got the
Sam opens the door to reveal his room and Dean stops in his tracks. Cas bumps up behind him and mutters an apology. “Oh, sorry,” Dean responds absent-mindedly, continuing into the room. He wasn’t sure why, but he really hadn’t imagined it to be this
“Oooh, Sammy, you got a
Not much has changed since the last time Dean was here in August. He drops his bags on the dusty, squashy chintz couch and turns on a porcelain lamp on the side table. In the kitchen, he grabs a beer out of the yellowing fridge and then plops into the worn leather recliner, reaching for the remote before sinking fully in. He must fall asleep watching TV, because before he knows it, he is waking up to the sound of the door creaking open and Bobby calling from the entryway, “Dean, you home?”
“I know, Dean. I know.”
“Sure thing,” Dean says, his voice coming out higher than he intends. “I mean, uh, sure, yeah, I can take a look,” he adjusts, this time managing to make the words sound gruff.
“I mentioned to Gabriel at the wedding that I too was a student of the Claremont Consortium and he insisted that I attend his party,” Castiel offers as further explanation. “I’m not typically much for parties, but I do enjoy a good drink and an opportunity to observe young adult social behavior.” His solemnity is perplexing to Dean, who has trouble with social situations in the best of circumstances and is still rendered inept by the swirl of alcohol and horny brewing in his belly. Horniness? He’s truly not sure of the noun form, if one exists at all, and he’s certainly too drunk to consider it for long.
“Envious doesn’t begin to describe it,” Charlie says, her eyes comedically wide as she turns to Dean. “Do you know how long I’ve been trying to get Castiel to attend a social event with me, especially one of or related to nerd media?”
“Damn, dude,” Gabriel lets out a low whistle. “Didn’t realize you shared such a resemblance with death incarnate.”
He absently wonders what it’s like to be in Sam’s shoes, with no family pressures and no expectations laid upon him. Sam got an academic full-ride to Stanford, so all he has to do is keep up his grades over the next four years. No early morning practices, no deathly fear of injuries, no hazing rituals and required social group to lock into from day one. As much as he loved soccer, it had turned into a chore by the end. A chore that he still, somehow, misses so much that it feels like a physical gaping hole inside him.
Castiel lives in a suite, Jo tells Dean, with a few other roommates that she has met once or twice. Apparently they all came in as religious studies majors and realized they lived well together across several doubles in their freshman year, so they’ve been living together ever since. Dean absorbs this information while focusing most of his energy on not slipping all the way back down the stairs of this dorm. He’s relieved when they arrive at a door that features a cloud-shaped piece of construction paper with Castiel’s name on it. He only has to knock twice before the door opens.
“Gross. Get off or I’ll sic my mom on you.”
“Dean, I want to dance,” Castiel pleads, tugging on Dean’s pocket. “Dean, can we go dance?” He doesn’t wait for a response before grabbing Dean’s hand and heading towards the source of the music, a giant, booming speaker in the corner of the living room. The lights are off and the room pulses with bodies, packed in so tightly that Dean can barely identify them as individual people.
“The curtain was Brady’s idea,” Sam says, gesturing. “Obviously it’s not any real privacy, but it does help a little when one of us has, a, uh, you know, like, a, um, girl—”
He forces himself to sit up and casts a bleary gaze around the room. His phone is up on top of his dresser, between his now-empty vodka cranberry bottle and a joint that is perhaps at the end of its life. Ah, college.
“That would be Norms’ with an apostrophe after the s,” says Jo. “Boom. English major.”
Cas sighs. “Dean, this is my friend Charlie.”
“Thanks,” the girl says, looking relieved. “I appreciate it.” Dean slides the forms he needs signed across the window of the bike shop and hands her a pen from the jar that Ellen keeps beneath the desk. The girl quickly scribbles her name and, with a tight smile and a wave, leaves the bike shop behind.
Castiel nods and hands the pen and paper back over to Dean. “That sounds great, Joanna,” he says. Joanna? Is this guy some kind of weird full-name fundamentalist? “I’m ready now if you are.”
“I would be more inclined to share the experience with you if you weren’t such a movie talker.”
Maybe it’s a good thing that he has feelings for a man with a kind heart and beautiful eyes and cool, dry hands. Maybe it’s a good thing that he has feelings for a man who cares for him, who brings him coffee and takes away his dishes, who brings him home and tucks him in when he’s had too much to drink. Maybe the possibility that that man has feelings for him too is something to be excited about, to call home about, instead of burying deeply under six feet of repression.
“Absolutely,” says Cas. “I even brought my bag in case you’d like to leave from here.”
“—Jess and I are able to communicate better and more clearly because we had an established friendship first. Plus, we’re able to be honest with each other because we had already seen each other through so many experiences by the time we started dating.”
