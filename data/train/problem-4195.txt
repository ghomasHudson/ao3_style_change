“Fuck you, you piece of shit, I’m going to kill you…” He snarls, drawing strength from each, frustrated word. If only he had the blade.
“I will not let you!” Castiel growls, facing the vessel, readying himself for an attack. That’s the cue for the Winchesters, and things start happening simultaneously. He hears Dean barking an insult to the other two newborns, almost feels it in his own skin when Dean slices up his palm and starts drawing the angel banishing sigil somewhere behind him. The newborn take the bait and rush forward, leaving Castiel with the old man.
“I don’t mean to sound harsh, but he sort of brought it on himself. He wouldn’t listen to me, or anyone else for that matter, when he started making some very bad decisions and kept digging himself deeper into that mess. He knew the risks very well, and now he’s paying the price for that.”
“You didn’t.” Mostly Dean feels disappointed, the other part wants to scream and bleed his anger out. The feelings are still dulled, as he’s trying to wrap his head around the fact that his brother lied to him again and sat with him the whole evening, without showing a single sign of discomfort. And he had been so blind the whole time. That little shit. Glaring at Sam, jaw clenched, he gets up and almost wrenches the door open. And there he is, the baggy trench coat drenched from the rain, dark hair dripping wet, blue eyes wide with disbelief. For a moment, they stand perfectly still and stare at each other in a frozen silence. Dean can’t breathe. Then all the sensations in his body come back with a whoosh and it kind of feels like getting knifed under the ribs, muscles screaming out their dissonance,
Throughout the day, Dean draws strength from the short text Cas sends him that morning. He reads it when he wakes up and puts on the black suit, which he has dug up from the forgotten cavities of his closet. He reads it again, when they get to the cemetery. Sam is quiet and sullen, eyes downcast like he can find some solace there, and Dean makes sure to check up on him often during the day. He hates seeing his brother this way. The preparations for the funeral are mostly done, so they wait for the meager amount of guests to trickle into the small chapel, greeting them at the doors. Dean gives them a firm handshake and a warm smile, thanking everyone who comes. Sam is acting just as gracious, happy to see some old family acquaintances, although his tone is more hushed than usual. There’s Bobby, of course. Some of his coworkers, few of his father’s friends, mostly vets, who’ve come to pay the respects to the man who they hadn’t seen in years. No actual relatives come, neither of them actually knows whether they even have living kin. John Winchester burned a lot of bridges while he was alive, and the empty benches remind Dean of absent people, who were once part of their everyday life.
“Wait, you booked us a king? I mean there’s gotta be a mistake, we can’t both fit there. You sure there weren’t any queen beds? What the fuck?” Dean’s rambling and he’s reaching for a plausible explanation for
“Keep in touch, okay? Don’t do anything reckless.” Dean hears Sam give some final mother-hen advice when he opens the door, hears the whining creak of the hinges again.
“Oh, you know you love me for this. You think I would’ve let you wait for a bus at this hour?” Dean is able to get past the sudden brain freeze with minimal amount of panic, when he realises he just slipped the l-word into the conversation, just like that.
“G-get me my clothes, I want this stupid thing off me,” he mutters and yanks the hem of the garb pointedly.
Dean’s heart feels lighter by the time they refill their cups the third time. There’s something about Castiel that makes him lose awareness of his surroundings and the track of time, and they’ve been talking for awhile. There’s a comfortable lull in the conversation, and Dean figures he’s taken enough of Castiel’s time already. He’s reluctant to leave, but he can’t expect the other man to listen endlessly about his boring life, dead father or not. Maybe he can get some other stuff to drop off at the shelter. Maybe he’ll run into Castiel again. He finishes the coffee and shifts in his seat to get up.
“You forced Cas to watch all of your favorite movies? I’m sorry man.” Cas shrugs, while Dean glares at them both indignantly.
“Not really. Sam and Eileen postponed their lovefest vacation a little, because they were sure I couldn’t handle being on my own for a couple of nights.” A bitter note creeps into his tone before he can take it back.
“Well- you know. You’re my friend and all that. I’m curious.” Dean fiddles with his fork, suddenly awkward. Cas is wearing a smile like he’s on some inside joke he’s not ready to share with Dean.
“So, Sam finally hunted down those lawyer-contacts that might be willing to help us with the shelter cases”, Cas starts conversationally, piling bacon slices to his empty plate. Dean steals few pieces off the plate, just in case if the other man tries to hog all of them. Cas scoffs but doesn’t try to stop him.
And suddenly the crushing grip on his broken wrist disappeared when Castiel released his arm. Dean couldn't suppress the cry of anguish as the swollen arm slumped heavily against the floor, shades of hazy red and black engulfing his vision. When the insistent black dots stopped swimming in his eyes, he saw the angel kneeling slowly and taking the angel tablet in his hand. A sudden, bright glow blinded him, chasing away every last shadow in the room. Dean shut his eyes against the hurting light, and opened them carefully only when the angel tablet had stopped announcing its divinity to the whole world. Had Cas broken free? Dean blinked, willing his abused eyes to sharpen his vision. He tried silently to force Castiel's troubled eyes back on him, to confirm it was really him again, but before he could voice his plea, the angel disappeared without a sound.
“Trust in us.” He repeats. “Yeah, okay.” Dean’s answer is quiet as a whisper. He still feels raw, but not as burdened as before, like Sam’s words got through to some thick wall he’s been shielding himself with.
Dean faintly sees the man straighten up, body shaking like he’s given his all, and then suddenly there’s a squelching sound and blood and gore showered on his clothes and face,
“Okay, now we’re all cozy and best friends forever, so can we finally order some drinks?” Dean butts in, needing the alcohol appear like pronto and his brother to stop milking the situation like yesterday. He eyes Sam meaningfully, and his brother takes the hint, rolling his eyes.
written in his gaze. Dean gives him a small smile, but a noise from other side of the booth distracts him.
“It felt like a…husk. Like it took all of angel’s power to just keep his body running. They’re jumping from body to body because they can’t access their true vessels. And they…they keep burning through them…but why?”
He’s baffled and overjoyed that Dean was the one who had had a change of heart and was willing to let Castiel back into his life. There’s still a small part that wonders if this is okay. If they’re able to go back to the way things were before. It’s been a long time since they had any type of normalcy in their relationship, and he wonders, if they are even able to find that precarious balance again. These doubts come and go, but he finds solace in observing the fidgety hunter, taking stock of how his fingers drum nervously against his thigh, playing with the angel blade absentmindedly. Dean’s eyes find his, and they crinkle up in a little smile. And Castiel realizes that it really doesn’t matter, because he would still do everything and anything for him, either way.
“Hey man, you still awake?” The tone is casual but there’s a whole world of repressed fear underneath. Dean slowly directs his gaze to his brother, sees him drawing some sigils on the windows. That alerts him immediately, and he tries to sit up straighter.
“C’mere.” Dean doesn’t wait for Cas to catch on, but takes initiative by snaking a hand from under the covers and tangling his fingers in Cas’ dark curls, pulling him forward for a kiss. He tastes like rain and stormy winds, lips chapped and salty. Cas melts against him easily, opening his mouth and letting Dean guide the pace, hand curling around his torso possessively. “You cheesy cowboy. You wanna make it up to me, for missing my birthday?” Dean murmurs against Cas’ lips with a playful smile, taking his lower lip between his teeth and tugging it gently. He doesn’t like voicing it aloud, but god he has missed Cas, and it feels so good have him here.
Dean stared blankly at Castiel. So he finally got it. At least some of it. Heaven had done no favors to his slowly emerging humanity; Dean thought he was even more daft than before. Still he found no energy to summon the feelings of petty resentment back. He had burned through his anger, anger that stemmed from a more primal place, and now only embers of it remained, souring his mood.
“I’d rath…rather not be conscious for that,” Dean huffs, trying for nonchalant humor and failing, hard.
“Yes. We take all sorts of donations, and all of the basic necessities are very much needed here. You can leave those boxes here, and I can come help and carry rest of the stuff inside.”
"Stop? What if I don't want to?" His voice was deeper, darker, escaping from his lips like he was coming out of a dream.
“I am”, Cas confesses, gracefully ignoring Dean’s blatant bullshit. He trails his hand to Dean’s stomach, and he tries his best not to show how much it tickles.
Dean did not like that. Castiel could feel him sneering into the kiss. There were rules to this game they were playing. Dean’s rules, and Castiel had to obey the unspoken script, follow every turn meticulously. There was only physical relief, achieved by any means necessary, nothing else. Dean pried his strong arms out of Castiel’s grip, and suddenly the angel was stumbling back from the hunter's right hook, jaw stinging. And then Dean was already upon him, fingers digging into his collar, yanking him forward for a fiercer kiss, one that didn’t leave room for breath.
There’s a silence for few beats, where Sam is looking at the body and the nurse and then Dean, who fights for breath, so he can tell how goddamn good it is to see his brother. He manages a lopsided smile and he sees Sam’s shoulders slump in relief in return. The nurse has fallen quiet, staring at the stilled body in numb disbelief. Sam spares a glance at her, but then his sole focus is on Dean, stepping around the body, ready to run to him. Dean shakes his head vaguely, nodding towards the woman. He can wait, and she needs to be calmed down before she flips. Sam complies his silent order, however reluctantly. He kneels by the woman.
“You know her. She can’t be tamed. She and Kaia had found some-” he stops for a moment and Dean hears soft thuds as Cas gets rid of his shoes, “-some vampire cult that had been responsible for kidnapping people for decades, so of course they dragged me into that hunt and I had to spend three days chasing vampires wearing idiotic masks, because apparently that was their “thing”-” Dean doesn’t see the air quotes but he can still hear them, and his lips quirk up into a small smile.
“Sam, please,” Dean breathes out, exhausted. He just needs to feel more like himself again. Getting stuck uselessly in the backseat is defeat enough for him, he doesn’t want to suffer it in a goddamn gown. Sam stays quiet for couple of beats and then he’s out of the car, digging something in the trunk. He re-enters soon with a bundle of clothes balled up in his hands.
“Wow, that’s… I’ve never would’ve guessed you’d say something like that about dad.” There’s something about that statement, coming from Sam’s mouth that sounds almost mocking to Dean. The sadness and anger he’s been swallowing down all day, rises in his throat like bile.
”I’ll be there in five minutes. Hold on.” Sam tries to sound like he’s not freaking out, but Dean knows better. He closes his eyes, a knowing smile tugging at his lips.
“Yeah”, he forces himself to answer, low current of panic thrumming in his core. He lifts his feet off the floor, sitting with his knees up and feet tucked underneath him, because he needs
“Hey, like I said before, it’s okay, man. I didn’t plan on celebrating anyway.” Cas leans closer and places a tiny kiss on his exposed shoulder, where the sleeve of the t-shirt has rucked up, as a response.
“Please- ,” he starts, a desperate attempt to mend what he can, even though he knows it’s too late. Castiel just wants to cradle the other man’s face between his hands and soothe the agonized lines around his eyes away. For Dean, the one, single word hanging between is too much and it sets him over the edge. Castiel sees the signs milliseconds before Dean becomes a flurry of furious movement, in the tensing of his muscles, in the way his jaw sets, before he grabs an empty beer bottle from the table and hurdles it across the room. The sound of shattering glass rings in Castiel’s ears, and Dean is practically in his face, teeth bared like a beast.
"Dean, come on. Wake up, man." Sam. Sam's voice drifted in and out of Dean's focus, but he started reluctantly climbing back to conscience, feeling his brother's warm hands on his shoulders, grounding him to this existence. He let out a small sound that was meant to be reassuring to his brother,
“Okay, we can go all night figuring out who’s more to blame, but let’s shut up before this gets out of proportion. I-I don’t mind sharing a bed with you, okay?” For some reason, that tiny confession leaves Dean vulnerable and small. If his father could see him now. Cas doesn’t answer right away, but he reaches his arm towards Dean, settling his warm hand on his bicep, squeezing it gently, sending pleasant shivers up his arm. Dean let’s it happen, skin tingling where Cas touched him, and suddenly his heart beats a little faster.
Dean stood in front of him, blood spattered all over his skin and clothes. He was hunched like a tense predator, with a dangerous glint in his eyes,
Dean freezes, forgetting he still has a mouth full of bacon, almost choking on the meat. “Wait, what? You date guys?”
Dean blinks furiously, body scrambling to balance itself, his hand grasping for something, a thin wrist, tightly locked in his hair. He tries to claw and kick and hit her, growling and grunting, but he can’t twist around or weaken the adamant hold in his scalp. Her other arm has lodged itself around his throat, and Dean has to fight for air. Eyes blearily focusing on the sigil in front of him, he brings his hand up laboriously, stubbornly starts painting the details outside the circle, a final fuck you because he knows there’s no way out of this, all the while fighting her with all that he’s got. Dean distantly hears the horrified screams of the nurse and the angry growl of the angel,
“Yes, that is most likely what we’ll do. But I just couldn’t help but visioning a chandelier in my future living room. I really want to build a house for myself someday.” That earns a small smile from Dean.
They stack the boxes in front of the desk, and the emptiness, the finality of it, hits Dean out of nowhere, ice cold and painful. He stares at the boxes, feeling nausea creep upwards his throat, suffocating him.
“So, uh, Cas…” He says softly, and Cas turns his head towards him in the dark. “I didn’t mean to be a jerk. I was tired and frustrated and I made things uncomfortable for you, and what- what I’m trying to say is that I’m sorry for taking it out on you.” Cas shuffles to his side under the covers, so they’re mirroring each other.
before he’s yanked forward by his collar by impossibly strong grip, spun around, feet sliding and kicking, clawing and
Castiel started fucking him, slowly at first, listening in to the little gasps Dean let out with every thrust to anticipate what he wanted. Dean’s fingers dug into his scalp, and he let his hips snap against his ass more forcefully, making Dean in return sink his teeth into the tendons of his neck. The bite hurt, and he slammed his cock in as deep as he could, relishing the wave of pleasure that rippled through him, angling for that sweet spot to make Dean more compliant. It clearly worked, the man's mouth became slack, unable to suppress a breathless moan and he sagged back on the table. Castiel pried loose from his grip and continued fucking him harder, barely able to think beyond the overwhelming sensations Dean gave him. Dean was getting closer too to the climax, the predatory glint in his eyes almost diminished, just desperation for release remaining. He tried grasping for his own erection, now completely without any friction, but Castiel swatted his hand almost angrily away and wrapped his own fingers around the pulsing cock. He smeared his hand with Dean’s precum, and started jerking him off with quick movements that matched the rhythm of his hips. Dean let his whole body finally relax into the contact, head dropped down, eyes closed, his own hips bucking forward to meet Castiel, hitting that sweet spot with every rapid thrust. For a moment it was pure harmony, the bodies moving together, and he knew he was unraveling fast. Dean’s cock was already slick with seeping cum, his mouth hanging open, unable to find oxygen in his ecstasy.
“Yeah, I think I just figured out how gay I’m for you”, Dean mumbles, trying to ignore his throbbing erection for a second. He figures he’s finally past the point where it’s redundant to resort to the denial-phase again, with his best friend,
“Dean!” Sam bellows somewhere unseen, going back and forth between the cars, trying to find him. Dean swallows, his throat dry as sandpaper, mouth tasting like blood. When he opens his mouth to speak, his voice sounds so wrecked and weak he wants to grimace.
“You’re still blaming me about going away?” He asks quietly, eyes dropping to his nervously fiddling hands, like he doesn’t want to hear the answer. Dean stops. This isn’t going right at all. There’s enough pain to go around already, and Sam’s got nothing to do with it. Dean only needs to look in the mirror. He takes a deep, steadying breath, lets his anger dissipate. Without it, he suddenly feels empty, and terribly heavy, like he hasn’t slept a goodnight’s sleep in a century.
When Dean steps out of the bathroom, Cas is waiting, wringing his hands nervously, clothes clean like nothing ever happened.
Dean thinks or mouths the words aloud, he’s not sure. He covers his ears, the shrill sound drowning out his own gasps. A bright blue light illuminates the whole corridor and blinds him momentarily. The scream dies down. Instinctively shielding himself, Dean twists around, and when the darks spots fade from his vision, he sees probably the most welcome sight in his entire life – Sam and the tip of the angel blade sticking out the angel’s chest, and the last, flickering remains of the divine light in her eyes, until it dies down. Sam pulls the blade back with a squelch and the frail body of a woman crashes on the floor.
“So who’s the girl you’re texting constantly?” Sam asks with faked casualness, while they’re watching some pointless action movie that just happens to be on TV. Dean makes sure that his brother sees the eye roll he makes in his direction, before answering.
Dean rose up, running his fingers through Castiel’s dark, messy hair, yanking him forward for a kiss, their lips all red and swollen from the rough contact, bodies molding against each other. They were fighting for the upper hand in this, with small claims of victory and Dean was trying to regain control. Dean licked his tongue against his, invading his mouth, and Castiel had had enough. He broke apart from Dean’s lips, breathless, shoving the man down with force. Dean let out a gasp that had nothing to do with pain.
“You think there are several angels involved in this? What are they trying to accomplish with these murders?” Sam asks, momentarily forgetting the tense atmosphere in the room. Castiel can practically see the wheels starting to turn in his head. Castiel had spent hours staring at his phone after he had hit a dead end with the case when he tried to work it by himself, for some reason expecting to see Sam’s or Dean’s call come in, but the phone stayed stubbornly dead. So, he had worked up his courage and called Sam, his chest tight with anxiety. That obnoxiously human sensation had carved a presence for itself in him after he left the bunker, flaring up in the most inopportune times. Sam had been little bit hesitant to pick up the case, knowing what Dean’s reaction was going to be, but in the end the hunter-side of him had won, knowing that innocent people needed them. And Dean was going to burn himself out like a flare.
That’s what he comes up with? A girlfriend? Cas looks just as dumbfounded by this, blinking owlishly.
Dean concentrates on opening his eyes, squinting against the harsh, electric light, wincing as his head starts pounding harder. He’s lying on something soft. A sofa, he concludes after he’s able to make out the floral patterns on the backrest. A heavy blanket is draped over him. There’s an empty fireplace in the corner, and the walls are bare. Dean doesn’t recognize the place. Sam must’ve found a hiding spot for them.
“Did you, um, mean what you said? Back at the cabin. About us being...serious about this.” Castiel has trouble finding the right words. Dean gives him a confused look, and then his eyes crinkle up in an almost bashful smile and he glances down.
Waking up next to someone is weird, when you’re not actually sleeping with them, especially since it’s been a while since he shared a bed with someone. Dean would never admit it out loud, but lazy morning snuggles are one of his favorite things, so it feels so out of place to feel someone shuffling in bed and getting up without saying any good mornings to him. Luckily he didn’t do anything weird in his sleep, like try to spoon Cas.
A shrill ringtone wakes Castiel up from his anxious thoughts. He immediately jolts, grabs the phone and presses the green answer-button before even checking out the caller.
“But...you killed it already. What the hell was that thing?” Susan looks at the body suspiciously, still clearly riled up. Dean closes his eyes for a second to figure out how much he wants to tell the nurse. Right now, they just need to get out quickly.
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. It’s tough what’s happening to your brother. But you gotta admit, it’s a little funny. How the fuck are you guys even related?” Cas shrugs, expression torn between amusement and embarrassment.
“So, wait, it’s just one angel? How is he able to jump from place to place so fast? He doesn’t have his wings, right?” Sam interjects. Dean looks up in surprise. The thought hadn’t entered his mind at all. Cas seems troubled and unsure about his answer, seeking correct words and stumbling around them.
turned on, and all the other voices in his head have gone quiet, allowing him for once the courage to just go for it. He slides his hand from his chest to Cas’ stomach, feeling the muscles jump underneath his touch. Cas is right there, so close, solid, muscular and warm enough to bask in the heat, and he doesn’t stop Dean, letting Dean touch him in a stunned silence. “I got you”, he murmurs, moving his hand lower to trail over the sharp hip bones, and finally feel Cas’ erection through his boxers. Dean cups his cock, squeezing it slightly and it pulses in his hand expectantly. The weight and the warmth of it feels foreign, but he’s more than willing to make this work to the best of his ability. Oh god, he’s gone to hell and this is his punishment, and fuck he wants more.
“Um, okay?” He says very slowly, clearly trying to get back on track. “Have you started seeing someone?”
“Okay, you know what? Never mind, forget I ever asked.” Sam throws his hands in the air and begins cleaning out the trash, furiously avoiding Dean’s gaze. This would a prime time to torture his brother with excessive details, but Dean’s not sure he wants to let Sam off the hook on the whole lying-thing so easily.
, he thought sourly, buying Dean's favor back by doing good deeds, however angels measured them. Dean's mouth tasted like ash and piss, and he made barely noticeable, disapproving sound in his parched throat. Castiel noticed the slight movement and turned his concerned gaze to Dean.
Then it slowly started to hit Dean when he persistently fought against losing his consciousness. He stubbornly kept his eyes open, ready to give the angel his most efficient death glare, eyes swollen shut or not, when he came back. But Castiel didn't, no matter how he waited. He was not coming back. The exhaustion and irritation mixed with worry started to give space to a darker feeling. Betrayal. Castiel had left him here. The thought hit him worse than the fist of a brainwashed angel. Castiel had left him here, broken by his hands, and had deemed it more important to save a goddamn rock than Dean. They had always shared a tight bond, but now Dean could feel tiny strings severing from it, making the connection thinner, frayed. The blood seeping from tiny wounds in his mouth tasted even more sour at this revelation. And he suddenly wanted to welcome that darkness. He stopped resisting the inevitable surrender, closing his eyes at last. Dean started sinking further down, past the red screaming hurt, both physical and emotional, knowing there was a bitter oblivion in the bottom of that abyss.
“I might be persuaded”, he hums, placing small kisses on the corner of Cas’ mouth, jaw. The angel makes a sound, which might come off as gruff if you didn’t know him, but to Dean it just sounds amused. Cas lifts his head, shifting so his weight is on his elbow, leaning over Dean. His hand wanders upwards, tracing the outline of Dean’s mouth with his thumb, then trailing lower to his chin, to the hollow of his throat. His eyes never leave Dean’s, but the closeness doesn’t feel like it’s too much, more like it’s grounding him, keeping him here, in this current moment.
“You’re a fucking coward, you know that?” He jabs a finger in Castiel’s chest, invading his space, green eyes filled with rage. Castiel sighs heavily. In order to save him from a lot of pain, he must hurt Dean now. He forces himself to look at the hunter with pained eyes, taking in the freckles on his nose, light stubble on his cheeks, the bags under his eyes, the bruises, all the details that he knows by heart.
“I think we’ve gone over everything relevant. I’m so tired I can’t see straight,” he concedes, getting up and stretching his long limbs half-heartedly. Castiel takes the hint and gets up too, dusting the non-existent dirt off his pants. Sam turns to face him, face hidden from Dean’s view and gives him a subtle jerk of his head in his brother’s direction, eyebrows raised expectantly. Castiel gives him a confused squint in return, not sure what Sam wants with him, until Sam mouths “
Dean settles into the bed, almost succeeding into fooling himself there’s nothing weird about any of this, even though he realises this is so far out of the straight territory. He hears the bathroom door opening, and Cas shuffles in the dark into the bedroom, awkwardly bumping into the furniture, not accustomed to moving in the strange apartment. He slides under covers, leaving a respectable distance between them, settling on his side, back facing towards Dean.
The fifth thing Castiel had always known, was that Dean was constantly plagued by his self-loathing and insecurities. No amount of love or cherish could make the voices go away, striking Dean in his weakest moments.
Dean searches his memories, suddenly remembering how the large man had placed his hand on his chest before he exploded. No wonder he had been easy to find in the hospital. And now they know his current location, so they’re basically just sitting ducks here.
“This your grand plan?” Dean spoke out, amusement dripping from the words, warm breath ghosting over his face, looking like he was anything but in a hurry to get out of this situation. The words almost felt like a tease, except his features became void of any emotion the following second, like sustaining normal interaction felt too difficult for him.
So when the opportunity arises to spend a weekend with Cas in Denver, he immediately jumps to it. Bobby has asked Dean to be his eyes and ears at a big car show, so the first thing he does, is a text to Cas.
A sudden touch on his forearm snaps him out of it. The blue-eyed man is still beside him, offering him a soft smile, a lifeline that Dean grabs hold of like a drowning man, and the words tumble out of his mouth before he can stop himself.
“Lawsuit?” It’s the first time Cas has even mentioned that, and Dean leans closer confidentially. Cas finds his hands suddenly very interesting, sounding very embarrassed.
“Alright, alright, you don’t need to be a bitch about it”, he laughs, that annoying little brother laugh Sam always does, when he knows he’s gotten under Dean’s skin. Dean ignores him out of spite, choosing to pay attention to his half-empty beer can.
With shaky fingers, he reaches for the wound, getting his fingers wet with blood and starts painting a circle, drawing the angel banishing sigil from memory. Every line is etched into Dean’s mind, with all the times he’s had to use it, all the near deaths they’ve avoided. He wets his fingers again, faintly aware that his hospital gown is soaked with blood. It doesn’t feel like so significant right now. Suddenly, a fearful voice cuts through the haze.
The bunker never quiets down, not even in the night. The giant machinery that works as the building’s heart, lungs and arteries hums, pulses and occasionally makes ticking, whirring sounds as Castiel makes his way down the corridor to the library. It has always given him solace and keeping company in the dark, when he guards Dean’s sleep, listening to the man breathe right next to him. Now the low background noises sound mocking; too loud and irritating to him.
He trails off, offering Dean some room to explain his side of things. He rolls his eyes, even though Sam can’t see it, but he knows his brother
It isn’t until noon the next day, until Dean finds the energy to get himself out of bed. His head is pounding dully, mouth dry as a desert, limbs refusing to cooperate. So maybe he had too much to drink. But after dealing with Sam guilt-tripping him the rest of the night, maybe he had no choice.
“What? I told you to go, because I was a fuckin coward. Cas, you didn’t do anything.” Dean tries to get up on his elbows, because he feels so powerless lying there, but all air escapes him when a flare of sharp pain forces him back down.
Castiel’s heart is pounding in his chest when he knocks on the door and stands in wait. He’s only met with prolonged silence from inside the room, which makes him double check the room number. Eleven. That’s what Sam said. It’s more than likely that the brothers are having a silent showdown inside on whether to let him in right now. He shuffles awkwardly away from the door, trying to adjust his damp clothing, even running his fingers through his wild hair in an effort to comb it. A big part of him just wants to run away. Castiel knows the extent of Dean’s rage and he feels sort of terrified to face him now. But he has to try. He has replayed the conversation with Sam countless times, trying to work up his resolve.
“Cas! Oh fuck, Cas, you’re okay, jesus…” Cas turns his head slightly to see Sam helping Dean up, and they both make their way stiffly to Castiel. Dean more collapses than kneels in front of him, Sam following suite, albeit slower, and they help him to sit up. They all just sit awhile close to each other, slumped and breathing heavily, trying to gather themselves. Dean keeps a steady grip on his upper arm, watching him closely. It would be tempting to curl into his arms and just fall asleep there. It feels nice, being able to lean into Dean again. Everything is woozy, but the world starts settling in after a minute, and Castiel frowns, noticing the bruises and cuts on their skin. Dean has a black eye and a bleeding wound on his temple, and a impressive bruise is starting to swell on Sam’s jaw. Their ears have bled profusely. He did that, he knows instinctively.
“My friend, I think. He’s cool.” Dean replies reluctantly, making sure that Sam catches the pronoun.
“What did you do?” He asks quietly, an alarm going off in his head. Just then there’s a knock on the door and they both flinch, and Dean reaches for the gun immediately. He fixes his eyes on Sam, silently demanding answers and the sasquatch has the nerve to look apologetic.
“You can come with me to visit him in prison.” Cas rolls his eyes, but a flicker of sadness shadows his face for a split second. Dean wipes the grin off his face, feeling a like insensitive asshole again. He knows Cas isn’t that close with his brother, not like he is with Sam, but family is always family, and Cas has probably been dealing with this alone, while Dean’s been feeling sorry for himself. A flicker of guilt stabs him.
“I’m right here, Sammy,” Dean interjects sharply, but the slur in his voice makes his authority less convincing. Holding eye contact seems like a feat at the moment, so he detachedly concentrates on his idle, bloodied hands resting uselessly at his sides. There’s a lot of blood on them, caked in the creases of his palm, fresh blood that leaves careless stains everywhere on the floor and his gown. Maybe leaving the hospital isn’t such a good idea. But hey, Winchesters thrive on bad ideas.
“Jesus fuckin Christ, I was just asking. Stop biting my head off”, he snaps back. Cas is slightly taken back by his comment, but precisely that moment the waiter swoops in, delivering their food. Dean gets a steamy plate of barbecued ribs, and Cas gets handed two bowls, the first one filled with strongly smelling soup, and the second one with some dish with noodles and bits of tofu and vegetables mashed together. They distract themselves with their meals for few minutes, letting the uncomfortable silence stew between them. Dean stubbornly looks at his food, cutting his meat into tiny slices. He can hear Cas stirring his stew, the metallic spoon scraping against the bowl loudly. Well, ain’t this going just fuckin fine. Cas says he’s out in the open, but judging by his reaction, he’d rather have his teeth pulled out rather than opening up about his life. Dean doesn’t even know why he cares. It shouldn’t be a big deal. Doesn’t Cas trust him? His reaction to this conversation few weeks ago was just as reserved and closed off as right now, and Dean’s been circling it endlessly in his mind, trying to figure out is it better to just stay silent or ask about it. He doesn’t want to seem like he’s avoiding it, but Cas’ reaction makes it almost impossible to talk about it like normal human beings.
“I know getting back to this life isn’t easy after…you know.” Sam is struggling, avoiding speaking about the Mark like it’s the plague. He licks his lips, trying to weigh his next words. Oh, Dean’s not gonna like this.
“You’ll stay for dinner, right?” He asks quietly, hopeful. Dean nods, not trusting his voice enough to speak yet. How could he say no to that?
Cas greets him and Dean pulls him into a hug, makes it really count, holding him close like he’s a precious thing, and Cas leans into the embrace easily. Something fragile shifts in his chest, easing up the pressure that has been holding him down for weeks.
Castiel reaches the library and freezes at the doorstep. A single lamp lights the room, and Dean’s solitary form paints silent shadows at the walls. He’s deep in thought, a book and a bottle of whiskey in front of him. Castiel considers turning back, but he has to do this at some point. He steps hesitantly into the room, and Dean stirs. They lock gazes, and Dean takes in Cas' formal attire.
“Fine. Be a fucking stubborn ass, if you want to,” he says finally, and swings the door open excessively hard.
Frustration is making Castiel desperate, and he pushes and pushes against the onslaught of grace, but he can’t move an inch. Grace is burning up in him, and feels it spreading around him, his featherless wings unfold and the air around them sizzles with raw energy. The resistance slowly gives out, and everything is slowly starting to glow now, the pure power almost ripping his body apart. Castiel thrums with it, the feeling is almost...incredible. The newborn try to hold on, but Castiel wades through the thick energy, places his fingers on the woman’s forehead, burning him out from the inside. Her body hits the floor, the sound of it dulled under a deafening howl of his ravaged grace, and he yanks the last remaining newborn closer, tearing through the remains of his mind with the force of a galewind, searching for the angel’s presence. It tries to rip itself loose, evading him, but Castiel zeroes in, mind clear and bright. He finds what he’s looking for, hurls the last of his power at Raguel, before he breaks the connection. There’s a bright flash, and then it gets very dark.
The life as a hunter has left Dean hardwired to respond to any noises, come they in abandoned warehouses or in the bunker in his own room, in the midst of sleep. So when his door quietly opens, his awareness snaps back from the light, restless dream he was having, and he surreptitiously slips his hand under the pillow to grip his gun, under the pretense of shifting in his sleep. Immediately alert, like he’s been waiting for this moment for hours.
“You’ve done enough!” Dean raises his voice. Cas swallows and flinches, something cracking in his hastily put up defenses, looking at Dean like he shattered his whole world. Dean closes his eyes, runs a hand gingerly over his bruises.
"I would like to do that again some time." Castiel had continued with his usual seriousness, placing his hand on Dean's, squeezing the sweaty palm. Dean had blushed slightly, opening his mouth to speak, but no words had come out. He had wrested his hand from Castiel's grasp with an awkward chuckle, and it was like he could only pull himself together when he wasn't too close to Castiel, drunk on his presence. He had cleared his throat, giving him a lopsided grin, still kind of shakier than Castiel had ever seen him, eyes bright.
He follows Cas inside, who orders a table for them, and a short man leads them into a plushy booth. The seats are cheap leather and there are lot of spices and a jar full of chopsticks placed on the table. The scent of roasted meat is pervading his senses, reminding Dean that he’s about to die in five minutes if he doesn’t eat right about now. Cas slides in opposite of him, accepting the menus with a grateful smile. Cas hands one to Dean and he peruses through the menu like it’s instructions to build a atom bomb.
he almost says to Sam. But it’s not about hurting one another now. “And I’m not trying to be a comedian to- to hide anything, it’s just the way I deal, you
There’s a loud crash on his left, and his mind snaps involuntarily back when he hears familiar, suppressed groan of pain. Dean is in trouble. The hunter lies in a heap in a pile of splintered rubble what used to be furniture, trying to sluggishly gather his limbs underneath him. Sam has been thrown into the wall, and he holds his side tightly. This isn’t good, Castiel thinks, and then he’s already flying backwards, hurled into the wall with enough strength that he feels the wood giving in underneath him. The crash steals the breath from his lungs, and the heavy pressure closes on him again, but only this time there are two of them, slowly advancing on him without even a sound. They’re outnumbered.
"Charlie's death is on your hands!" Dean yelled, looking like it took everything he had to keep his body in control. It probably took. The corruption of the mark wasn’t subtle.
”Are...are you okay?” Dean’s voice gives out halfway, reducing to a whisper. Sam gets up at once, guiding a glass with a straw to his dry lips and Dean sips the cool water gratefully, too tired to mind the fact that he can’t summon the strength to care for himself.
“Okay then. Guess I’m getting our weapons,” he says too evenly, his tone betraying his irritation, and takes off. Fuck. Dean shuts his eyes, gathers his patience. He can’t say anything right, it seems.
"Just stop this, okay? Nobody has to hurt anyone!" Castiel could feel his tranquility chipping away fast, piece by piece.
He drags himself to the kitchen, the smell of fresh coffee awakening him slightly. Sam is sitting by the table, looking little tired but not particularly hungover. He’s browsing a magazine deep in thought, but Dean’s shuffling steps draw his attention and he sits up straighter in his chair.
The opposite door swings open and Dean feels the seat cushions dip when Sam stuffs his gigantic body inside.
He just needs to know they’re on the same page here, needs to what this means to Cas, because he couldn’t let him walk away from this like it didn’t mean anything. Fuck, he sounds like a fucking girl. Cas lets out a tiny huff.
"Okay, might as well get it over with, because I really wanna do this", Dean had muttered almost to himself, and before Castiel could ask what he meant by that, Dean had grabbed the angel's collar without a word and yanked him closer, bringing their lips together. Castiel had blinked, surprised, but let him easily, studying the rhythm of his lips and slowly beginning to match Dean's brash movements, tasting alcohol and something sweet, something that was uniquely Dean. To this day, the angel still remembered the thrill, the familiarity of it, pieces of an intricate puzzle finally finding their places, as Dean's fingers had tentatively caressed his hair in the midst of kisses. When the kiss had deepened, breath hot against each other's lips, Dean had pulled away abruptly. He slinked back to his own seat, not quite looking at Castiel, as if he was ashamed about how eager he had been. Castiel had touched his cheek hesitantly, not quite yet knowing what would set the other man off in the wrong moment.
Dean can’t shake the feelings of nervousness that has itched under his skin all day, and he tidies up the place meticulously and changes his shirt twice.
“Fine,” he answers in the same tone and digs up his computer, starting to explain to Cas about the evidence of the murders he’s found. But his shoulders are more tense than before, and he steals worried looks in his brother’s direction. They go through their plans for tomorrow; interview the widow, visit the murder scene and the morgue, the usual. This murder is the most recent one, so maybe they can find some traces of the killer and trace some pattern between the murders. Dean listens to them quietly, not offering any kind of insight on the case, or even any snarky remarks. Finally, Sam shuts his laptop and yawns loudly.
“What do you want?” Cas asks quietly, breath ghosting over his lips. Dean shrugs, carding his fingers through the angel’s messy hair, sliding lower down into the nape of his neck to pull him into another, open-mouthed kiss. He feels Cas’ hand slithering over his chest and stomach, finding his hip bones through the covers, and he can’t help it when his breath stutters into the kiss when Cas palms him through the thick blankets. He drags the heel of his palm over Dean’s crotch a few times until his cock finally gets the memo and perks up. Dean can feel Cas smiling wickedly against his lips, before he gets up, giving him a final kiss that says
“Look, I’m not saying what he did was right. But you’ve been doing nothing but pushing us both away ever since you got back, so I kinda get it that Cas probably thought you actually wanted him gone. I know he didn’t want to leave you, but he thought it would be easier for you, since you couldn’t even look at him.” Sam tries to convey calmness in his voice, but there’s an accusatory tone underneath it and Dean’s first instinct is to bristle and defend himself, yet Sam’s words hit him hard.
"You've been doing a lot of that", Sam would shout after them, and Castiel could hear the badly hidden amusement in his voice. Dean would point his middle finger very moodily at his brother, not even glancing back. Castiel hadn't minded the teasing or the transparent excuses, not as long as Dean was okay with it, under all his snarky exterior. All of them had known what was going on from early on, even Castiel had picked up on the signals, but labeling their thing something as trivial as a beer run made it lot easier for Dean to handle than having to deal with the fact that he might have romantic feelings towards another man.
“Dean, what- what do you think is happening here?” Cas sounds distressed, his voice frail like he’s fighting to keep all the emotions from bleeding out.
Dean’s used to seeing the airport packed with people, so being there in the middle of the night without all the noise feels strangely eerie. Some of the coffee shops and other essential services are open, and couple of weary travelers occupy the small tables, half-asleep. He walks past them, steps echoing in the vast hallways, the overly bright neon signs and lights stinging his sleep-deprived eyes. He catches sight of a clock that almost mockingly tells it’s quarter past three. He fucking figured that on his own, thank you very much. But he’s here of his own volition, because he
“I don’t know, some local beer. It all tastes the same anyway.” Sam takes a experimenting sip, smacking his mouth to get rid of the sour aftertaste.
“Yeah, um, no. He wasn’t really my type.” He glances at his hands, not elaborating any further. Dean struggles for something to say, but there’s a cacophony of relieved and panicked voices blocking every sensible thought he’s ever had. He’s been scared to ask Cas about it. He was scared, because he wasn’t sure how he’d react, if Cas had said something else.
“That…doesn’t sound like much of a pattern. So, what connects these killings?” Dean takes a long sip from his coffee, relieved to distract himself with a case, despite the fact he feels like he’s been run over.
“Good night Dean”, he mumbles. Dean lays on his back, watching the silhouette next to him in the darkness, listening Cas’ breathing get slower and deeper when he falls asleep. He very carefully turns on his side, inching closer to Cas under the guise of sleeping, and Cas doesn’t move away.
“So, jack squat on Rowena as well?” Dean directs their attention elsewhere, fixing his eyes on his brother sharply. Sam just blinks in surprise, like Dean caught him doing something inappropriate.
“Good night, Cas.” Dean watches the back of Cas’ head, body thrumming with restless energy and more awake than he has felt in hours. He doesn’t sleep well that night, waking up every time Cas shifts or sighs in his sleep. Dean keeps listening to his steady breathing, but it doesn’t calm him down at all.
“So, a 54-year-old man kills a priest by hitting him repeatedly with a blunt object, yelling how unclean his soul is and other religious crap like that. The witnesses tell that the man’s eyes and ears were heavily bleeding during this, and get this, he spontaneously explodes right there in the middle of the church. Like a full-on explosion with guts flying everywhere. Now, according to the wife, the man wasn’t religious and didn’t even know the priest. Apparently, he was acting really strange the whole afternoon, and then just…walked out of the house without saying anything. This was in…” Sam pauses and skims the text, “Lawton, Oklahoma.”
It might’ve been few minutes of or few hours, when Castiel comes back to himself. He’s lying on the floor, face down. Everything hurts. He tries to move his arms, but they won’t follow his orders, instead just trembling uncontrollably, terribly weak. He feels like he just shredded his own essence into mangled bits.
“I just don’t get why you won’t let me heal you. I don’t like to see you hurt.” Cas spreads his hands in a gesture of defeat.
“Hey Cas”, Dean greets him warmly, sliding next to him on the booth. He keeps his eyes on Cas, noting absentmindedly he’s fresh shaven. Cas squeezes his shoulder, blue eyes focusing intently to his, questioning
“Christ, Dr. Phil, do you ever stop talking?” Dean gets up, trying to put some distance between them. But Sam gets up as well, blocking his path. They both stand tall, glaring daggers at each other. Dean’s muscles are tight with tension, fingers curled in a fist. He wishes right about now that this matter could be fixed with a one, satisfying punch. But he’s done with that.
the one who hurt Charlie, I was aware and I didn't stop. I would've-" Dean had stopped abruptly when his voice choked. Castiel had taken a cautious step forward, arm extended, ready to support the hunter, but Dean had swatted the hand away angrily.
“Dammit, Cas, I’m not some fuckin therapy project for you to feel good about yourself! You wanna hold hands and sing kumbaya so I can find the light? I can handle myself.” Dean has never seen Cas angry, much less angry with him, so he’s taken aback by the gathering stormcloud that shadows his expression, darkening his features. But the raw pain in Cas’ eyes is what stabs Dean in the heart. Cas doesn’t say anything, he just turns back on his heels and marches out, shoulders hunched. And Dean knows, he’s monumentally fucked up now.
He stops to reel his last encounters with Cas, replaying every angry remark and the open hurt Cas expressed in response and it all just…falls into place. And he feels like the biggest asshole of the universe.
“Yes, I’m aware of that, and I’ll perform my part in this, just as you will,” Cas answers dejectedly. He sighs heavily, before continuing on. “He can be killed, like any other angel, theoretically. The only problem is the original host; as long as he exists, he can carve up more pieces of himself. And because the newborn parts of him are extremely unpredictable, it wears down the hosts more quickly, which explains the rapidly exploding bodies. We need to kill them, before they can do that, otherwise they’ll just find new hosts. Mutilating himself has already made Raguel weaker, killing few of the newborn hosts should incapacitate him, I hope.”
Dean glances suspiciously at the red paste, mixed with yellowish beans. “That looks way too healthy.”
“That’s very kind of you.” His praise makes Dean uncomfortable and he clears his throat, breaking the eye contact.
Castiel had had joined everyone else for dinner in the library, a large selection of Chinese food that had looked tasty, at least if he had tasted anything else than randomly merged particles. Sam and Charlie had both offered a smile when they had seen him enter the room, engaged in their conversation. Dean had been shoving rice and chicken in his mouth at a hasty pace, grumbling about how nerds they were, mouth full of food, his broad back facing him. As Castiel had passed him, he had traced his fingers along his shoulder blades, caressing Dean's short hair in passing when he walked by to take his own seat next to him, but the hunter just shied away from the gentle touch.
“Are you willing to talk about what happened last night? What did you say to Cas? He was seriously upset when he left.”
“I think Raguel just seeks out souls that emit certain types of negative feelings, like regret, shame, anger, or sadness,” he says carefully. Dean shakes his head in frustration at that.
“That’s not even how you use that phrase- are you trying to get back to me?” Sam raises his voice, anger gaining some foothold. “I get that you’re frustrated and angry, but this isn’t how we work-”
“Fine, I’ll get the first round, so you can catch up.” Sam gets up and disappears behind a swarm of partying college boys.
Piles of books had been gathered in the middle of the room, ancient tomes and modern works alike, tossed around with no regard to their value. Two dead bodies, the remaining Stynes, were lying sprawled on the floor, coloring it with symmetrical, dark red pools of blood. This was Dean. This was all Dean. Staining his own home with violence.
"Dean, please forgive me." Castiel's voice was low, barely cutting above the heavy silence. Carefully he sat himself at the edge of the bed, and never breaking the eye contact, took Dean's hand carefully into his own. It was warm, Castiel's palm pressing against the back of his hand, fingers finding the steady pulse in his wrist.
It’s a Friday afternoon in February, and Dean’s at work as usual, in the middle of changing the tires, when Bobby calls out to him.
“It’s an…adult entertainment business, for all intents and purposes.” Cas actually blushes, squirming in his seat. A disbelieving grin makes its way to Dean’s lips unintentionally.
“Did you find anything else there? We need to find something that connects all of these victims.” Sam is right back in his element, but Dean feels last of his strength fading fast.
"Dean. You don't have to do this." Castiel let out the raspy words, clambering up in the middle of some books, little shaky. He kept eyeing the man in alarm as he was collecting himself, slightly surprised that Dean allowed him this little pause. The man kept pacing back and forth in front of him, and Castiel could feel it. The erratic, violent pulse echoing in the back of his own skull that kept the hunter moving so restlessly. Dean was hardly the master of his urges no longer, but he wasn't gone yet.
“What are you really asking me here, Dean?” Cas murmurs, eyes locked with his. He never takes his hand off, and Dean becomes really aware of that one point of contact. Holy fuck. What the fuck is happening here? He blinks like he’s waking up from a long trance. They’re so close, it would be the world’s easiest thing to just press little closer-
They stay silent for a while, avoiding each other’s eyes, air suffocating around them. Dean feels suddenly bone-tired, tired of fighting his brother, tired of constantly fucking up his life.
“Oh really? Did that cum on your hand appear on its own then, too?” He snarks, leveling a glare at his direction. Dean has no answer for that. He feels small in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time. Cas sits up abruptly, throwing the covers off him. “Fuck, Dean! I’ve been trying to keep up with your mood swings for the past month and you’ve been acting like an asshole for half of that time, but I can’t go through this again. I- I can’t deal with this right now.” He gets off the bed, probing around for the light switch. He finds it, and the bedroom fills with unnatural bright light that hurts Dean’s eyes. He hears Cas opening the zipper of his bag aggressively and the rustling sounds when starts dressing himself.
“Hey you”, he says, immediately greeting him with a long kiss, mindful of his stained hands, not caring if anyone’s watching them. Cas’ lips feel familiar, and they’re cold and chapped from the winter frost, but Dean doesn’t mind. When they break apart, Cas looks at him with a delighted, surprised twinkle in his eyes, and the pleased smile he gets in return is just enough to build back a tiny sliver of his confidence to be who he is.
Their bodies stayed frozen like that for what felt like eternity, relishing in the afterglow of pleasure, although in reality it must’ve been only a few fractions of a second. Then Castiel’s spent body gave out and he collapsed on top of Dean, face buried against his collar bone. He tried to find some oxygen again, taking deep gasps of air like it was the first time he experienced breathing. Dean’s chest rose and fell rapidly underneath him, his whole body trying to regain their senses. When they stayed like this, Castiel could almost believe that this was just like the other times, like there never had existed any marks with bitter curses bound to them or any rifts between the two. He took in Dean’s scent, under the smell of sex, particles of motor oil, alcohol, gunpowder, evidence of the life he had lived. And under the warmth of his skin, the anguish of constant doubts, the strain of worry, the need to push people away, but also deep caring, the need to protect. That was all Dean, and he wasn’t the easiest person to be with, but Castiel wanted all of him, even if it meant going against his wishes. He needed to save this man.
he knows he wants to keep Cas, knows that he wants to be near him, the way they easily hold each other’s gazes and he can’t stop smiling, even though it’s the middle of the night and there are strange people around them.
But Sam gives in and cuts a large hole in the fabric, trying to avoid the edges of the seeping wound. He hands Dean a flashlight and makes quick work of cleaning the wound, revealing a few ruptured stitches. Dean hates the stitching up-part, but he endures it quietly, fogging up the glass with warm puffs or air. The damp clothes seem to suck out all the warmth from his body, and his bare feet, save for the cast on his leg, are numb and icy. He feels fine tremors starting to move through his abused body. He probably looks as fantastic as he feels. Cas could fix this in an instant. Dean really misses him right now.
Still, mostly what he misses, are the small things and details. Dean rarely wants to be the little spoon, and he grumbles about the whole thing almost every time. But he’s content like that too, Castiel knows, because the stuff that he doesn’t say, is what he has to look out for. His warmth and weight always feel so reassuring, Castiel can’t help but to gravitate closer. In the mornings, it takes usually an hour of grouchy silence and two cups of coffee to wake Dean up, any rushing or trivial small talk not approved. Dean values the slow mornings, as he was never able to have them while growing up, he explained once. Sometimes they steal small smiles and touches while on a job, and Sam pretends not to notice. Movie nights and drives in the Impala. Dean’s lopsided smile, when he’s pleased how he unravels Castiel when they kiss. Freckles and green eyes that are a reflection of a world of its own.
Dean unlocks the room and clicks the lights on, nodding approvingly to the king-sized bed in the middle of the room. Castiel heads for the bed immediately without any further notion of checking out their room, slumping down on top of the comforter, weight of his limbs dragging him further down, and Dean follows closely, kneeling down in front of him.
They gather their belongings from the car in silence, and Sam comes back with the keys, dangling them from a leathery keychain.
A door had been opened, and they were supposed to figure out what was beyond it. Dean had slowly started to rely on his presence more, ensuring his whereabouts and wellbeing more often, almost like he did always for Sam, asking him with to their cases, to just hang around in the bunker. Just as quickly Dean had reverted to his old habits, sharp comments rolling off his tongue about angels and their douchbagness, enclosing in himself, ready to be disappointed if Castiel disappeared on him again.
you. I almost killed my own brother. I wasn’t worth saving and still, you saved me, and all I can think about now is that I can never make up for it.” He stops to exhale shakily, blinks his eyes furiously to expel the unwelcome tears there. There’s a ball of anxiety sitting tightly on his chest, making it impossible to continue.
Yeah, his dad was old drunk who fucked up his head with booze and all it got him was a stroke and some vicious hemorrhaging. But he was still Dean’s dad.
, but he was so tired. Cool fingers cupped his still undamaged cheek, and Dean opened his eyes obediently, although his other eye had swollen almost shut. Sam smiled worriedly, a little relieved twitch of his lips.
“Oh God, I am way too tired to rant about Gabe. I’ve been sleeping on an uncomfortable pull out couch for two weeks, going over his finances and books, trying to figure out how he even stayed afloat all these years, keeping him in check, answering phone calls from suddenly unemployed strippers, while he’s been doing tequila shots and hosted three different parties at his house. Right now, I just wanna sleep in a real bed and then wash the Florida stench off me.”
“I got clothes, shoes, bed sheets, uh, towels… some other stuff too, can’t remember what, though. I got few more boxes in my car too, if you need this sort of shit- I mean items.” His slip-up makes the dark-haired man laugh, making his eyes crinkle up. Dean decides he likes the guy.
Feedback is always appreciated. Not a native speaker here and I don't have a beta, so the mistakes are mine and mine alone. (Anyone willing to beta this..?). I'll post the chapters regularly, the fic has been finished for ages but I just need to post them  :)
“For once I’m so fucking glad I have a boyfriend with pretty awesome powers,” Dean says in a low voice and Castiel blinks in surprise.
But it wasn't about the severity of insults no longer. It was about what drove him onward, all that sophisticated machinery inside them what made Castiel who he was. And Dean had found a weak spot in his.
A rock song blasting from the speakers, the stuffy smell of unwashed bodies, cigarette smoke and alcohol is enough to make Dean feel right at home, when he enters the crowded bar with his brother. Sam follows him somewhat uneasily. Fancy college boy. He nods to the familiar bartender, Pamela, who gives him a lazy salute between fixing some drinks, and starts looking around for Cas. Soon Dean finds him, huddled at a corner table, looking rather out of place here in his trench coat and playing with his drink nervously. Trust Cas to be formal about a night out, appearing early and well dressed. Dean can’t wait to make fun of him. Wide eyed, Cas notices the brothers approaching him, his bewildered expression melting into obvious relief. Dean can’t keep the wide grin off his face when they make their way to him through the crowd, and Cas answers in kind, albeit more hesitantly. He eyes Sam behind him questioningly.
“There’s some coffee left. Looks like you need it,” he greets Dean, who grunts in return. Dean pours some for himself, shuffling over to his brother to see what he’s doing, the smell of hot coffee waking up him a little.
"I'll just be here." Dean didn't bother answering, but he felt the tight, cold knot inside him ease up a little, even though he was reluctant to admit it had anything to do with the angel. But it was enough that he slipped into dreamless, black sleep easier than before.
“What are you talking about? I’ll be ready in five,” Dean calls over his shoulder when he exits the kitchen, not bothering to wait for a reply. There goes that relaxed morning.
"Cas", he mouthed the syllable with great difficulty in attempt to coax the angel to hear him, to see him, to see what he was doing. Dean's strength was fading fast, breathing becoming ever more labored.
“I abandoned you. You think I abandoned you.” He speaks softly. The words cut deep, and Dean feels suddenly too exposed, ashamed how easily Cas can read him. Dean closes his eyes momentarily, lips pursed tightly together, and he needs to pull himself together
"Hey. What happened?" Dean blinked blearily the shadows away, trying to gather his strength to convince there was nothing to worry about. Sam still held onto him, and Dean feared that without his constant presence he would've crumbled.
“Thanks for the ride, Dean.” The door closes gently after him. And then the strange man is there, he’s hugging Cas and Cas is hugging back tightly, both smiling like they haven’t seen each other in centuries. Cas didn’t mention what kind of friend he’s seeing, and come to think of it, Dean knows virtually nothing about his social circles. He’s met some of Cas’ friends shortly, but they’ve never really spent any time together, so he could be dating several men for all Dean knows. Is Cas sheltering him from certain aspects of his life? There’s something, a very uncomfortable feeling that fights to get out, tightening in Dean’s chest, but he doesn’t want to find out what it is, so he clamps it down and drives off, eyes catching the two men, still standing very close to each other, in the rear mirror. Whatever. It’s none of his business.
“Not your business, but I thought I’d send him a text or something.” Dean aims for coming off as casual about the whole thing, but Sam shakes his head adamantly.
“Yeah, I think he is”, Dean can’t help the dopey grin, and he ducks his face bashfully to hide it, not missing the pleased grunt from the older man. He opens the door, walking towards Cas in long strides, who is waiting for him patiently, leaning against the driver’s door. They’re both smiling and it always reminds Dean of that night at the airport, where they were the only people that existed for each other, because it still feels like that every time he sees Cas.
"Hi", Castiel had repeated, feeling his whole body hum in the other man's proximity, not daring to break eye contact. Dean had made a satisfied noise, and run his fingers through the angel's coarse stubble.
Dean wakes up from his dream groggily, mouth tasting like shit and with a pounding headache. He rolls over, trying to find the familiar warmth next to him, until he comes to his senses and opens his bloodshot eyes.
“You’re damn right it wasn’t,” he quips. “Can we finally focus on this damn hunt?” Sam still looks at him like a dog who’s been scolded, but a cautious flicker of a smile tugs the corners of his brother’s mouth nonetheless.
A loud crash brings Dean back ruthlessly from his hazy reveries. He blinks, turning his head toward the sound, trying to see. He hears hasty footsteps on the other side of the warehouse that he would recognize in his sleep, but the vast space distorts the sound and makes it harder to pinpoint them.
“Nothing to apologise for'', Cas says, letting go of Dean’s hand and rising from the bed to lift the covers, sliding underneath them, right next to him on his side. He splays his hand over Dean’s chest, the covers pooling around his waist, revealing his bare, unblemished skin.  “I’m sorry I missed your birthday.” Dean turns his head, catches the rueful look on Cas’ face.
“Dean, please. It doesn’t have anything to do with dad, does it? You’ve been so closed-off about his death this whole time, and you’ve barely accepted help from me in anything, but you didn’t have to deal with everything by yourself. And last night, you looked like my comment about dad had personally stabbed you in the gut before you took off.” Sam, as usual, has proven to be too perceptive, cornering Dean effectively. Dean sighs again, searching futilely for answers from the bottom of his coffee mug. He’s too tired to fight this. He pauses for a long while, the last of his resolution cracking easily as eggshells.
They have to stay like that a while, catch their breath, locked in a tight embrace. Dean’s thighs shake with exertion and he has to pretend that Cas isn’t mostly holding him up. The angel breathes unevenly, warm puffs of air on Dean’s reddened cheek, fingers carding through his messy hair. Dean’s face is still buried in Cas' neck, a familiar scent of
“Dean, I-, this is the first time you’ve called me your boyfriend,” he blurts out, and Dean leans back, a lopsided grin lightening up his bruised face.
"I don't want to." Castiel punctuated each word defiantly, facing Dean, all bloody and bruised. The angel with the will of humans. He knew that Dean would've been proud, under different circumstances.
, Dean thinks sourly. He had every choice. After his meltdown last night, Dean had re-emerged from the bathroom of the bar, only to find Sam sitting alone, looking like he’s about to murder Dean. Sam had immediately demanded to know what Dean had done, because Cas had come up with a hastily invented excuse and said his rushed goodbyes to Sam, before Dean could catch up with them. After some serious deflecting and pissing off his brother as well, Dean had proceeded to drink himself to stupor alone.
he finally pushes two, lubed fingers inside Dean with minimal resistance, forcing a shuddering moan from his lungs, and he melts against the cushions, spreading his legs further, eyes fluttering closed. Cas slowly pumps his fingers in and out of him, twisting and spreading them slightly, aiming for his prostate with each pass.
Castiel had lingered in the doorway of Dean's room, watching the man breathe steadily in the dark, hazel eyes closed as he had laid on his bed, deep in slumber. He hadn't dared to wake up the hunter, settling for guarding his dreams. Castiel had been away for some time, and seeing Dean always felt like coming home. He must've sighed too loudly and somehow through his hunter's reflexes, Dean had heard him and opened his eyes sharply, a gun ready in his hand, pointing at the door before he had been probably even awake.
“Huh. Looks like you finally managed to learn how to do proper stitches,” he jokes weakly. His head feels like it’s made of lead, thoughts running slower than oily water, but if there’s a chance to rib his brother, he’ll take it.
Dean's wandering focus was brought back to present time by an awkward shuffling coming from the chair on the other side of the room, but still he made no effort to notice the angel, his face facing the wall, heavy eyelids drooping like heavy curtains, calling him back to feverish dreams.
“Well, you’re not wrong, and I do appreciate this.” Cas breezes past his slip-up, seemingly not noticing how Dean just stopped breathing for a second.
“Shut up. You got yourself into this mess, so you’re going to help me to fix it.” Sam slides his hand under Dean’s neck, looks for confirmation that this is okay. Dean exhales shallowly, readying himself.
"How does that feel?" Castiel had breathed out against Dean's parted lips, marveling how the other's pleasure made his own body react and grow hotter. He had quickened his pace instinctively, when Dean had begun grinding against his hand, more needy.
Cas doesn’t rise to the bait, and Dean’s not sure if he’s disappointed or relieved. He has argued about the babysitting complex with Cas, with Sam, even Eileen for a couple memorable occasions, and none of the fights have led them anywhere other than silent treatment and slamming doors. Sure, his drinking habit sometimes gets out of control, but he’s pretty sure he doesn’t need supervision 24/7. “
“So yeah, if the offer is on table, I’d like to take you out on a real date. Maybe ask if you want to be my boyfriend if it goes really well. But right now, if you want it, I’d like to take off your clothes and have my way with you.” Cas’ tone darkens towards the end, and the loose grip he has of Dean’s hips, tightens slightly.
“You hear me? Everyone is in-in danger here, especially me. We can’t…uh, defend ourselves.” Dean hears the slight slur in his voice, tangling the letters together. Sam looks at him sharply.
Sam notices it too, how Dean spends more time on the phone than usual, and how he feels somehow lighter. He has made it back home to help with the final funeral preparations, after getting the extended vacation approved. It’s been too long since he’s seen his brother, but they quickly fall back to their old routines of teasing and being smartasses, but foremost Sam is the only person who understands him fully. Lending support to one another in this situation feels comforting, even though Dean might insist he doesn’t need it.
“Any other surprises I should know about, Sam?” He asks without taking his eyes off the angel, voice rough like sandpaper. Castiel stays on his guard. The hunter is cornered, on edge, and they both know it. And those fists hurt something nasty. He forces himself not to take his eyes off the other man, taking in the haggard looks, the bags under his eyes and the neglected scruff. He did that to Dean. His resolve wanes a little, as despair sets in again. How could Sam think this is a good idea?
“Are you okay? I will heal you in a bit, once.. I, uh, rest awhile,” he says shakily. Dean raises his eyebrows, cups his cheek and swipes his fingers under Castiel’s nose, smearing them in blood. Huh, he wasn’t even aware that his nose was bleeding.
"I need you." The words were so incoherent, so broken, Dean could hardly understand it was still him who voiced them. There was a not a hint of recognition in Castiel's eyes, when the angel stared emotionlessly down at him. It was not Castiel doing this, Dean reminded himself, clinging to hope that he could break through this cold mask. Dean would've begged more, would've done anything if it meant bringing the angel back from whatever he was going through. He opened his bruised lips for a silent prayer, and as he raised his unfocused eyes to meet Castiel's stormy blue ones, he saw a subtle sign that a violent inner battle was still raging inside him. Dean had no idea what Castiel was fighting inside his own mind, but he had to hope with every ounce of his faith that the angel was strong enough.
“I’m curious. Which black and white films do you like, Sam?” Cas leans forward, head tilting slightly like he’s dying to know the answer and Sam lights up, probably squealing inside for the chance to talk about boring shit like that. Dean rolls his eyes and aims for a look that says he’s ready to die this second, but truth be told, the fact that Sam and Cas are getting along so well, is filling him with relief and a giddy happiness. They’re very similar in some ways; intelligent and well-educated, good with people and with a streak of nerdy hobbies. He follows their excited conversation quietly, shaking his head disapprovingly every minute or so to keep up the appearances. Cas has gravitated closer to him again in the midst of their discussion, their knees bumping occasionally and Dean finds he doesn’t mind the closeness at all.
"I waited for you to come back. I counted on you. But you didn't. And the way this works, I need to trust you got my back. Always."
“Well maybe, but it’s only gonna hurt you further to get stuck on that. You know… Bobby told me that you blamed yourself for mom’s death as well, when you were four. He said you got the exact same look back then, like you were riddled with guilt. He’s worried as well. You have a habit of taking the whole world as your responsibility, and when something bad happens, you beat yourself up for it. You can’t let other people’s lives drag you down, because the thing is, bad shit always keeps happening, and you aren’t responsible for everything.”
“Dean, I really don’t need your approval for my sexual identity.” He says it calmly, still looking deceptively neutral and Dean’s pretty sure he fucked this up royally. But how could’ve he known?
“I…ran into some trouble. Can’t move. You need to... come and pick me up.” Every word is more difficult than the last one, but Dean knows giving up now isn’t an option.
“I’m up. Hit me.” He sits opposite of his brother, playing with his coffee mug. Sam simply shrugs, clicks something and starts reading aloud.
“Sam,” Dean whispers, starts patting his pockets with uncoordinated hands, accidentally hits the painful spot on his side, feels the warm wetness of the jacket- has he been stabbed? He tries to lift his head to see, but that makes his vision blur around the edges. Dean stubbornly holds on, prods the spot with his fingers, slick with fresh blood, finding a small puncture wound and then he has to bite his lower lip to keep himself from cursing out loud. Knife, he knows instinctively.
Cas looks bewildered and shaken, until he visibly gathers his thoughts and a guarded look slips in place. “I- I thought that was clear to you, Dean.” He says carefully.
“Pretty bad. Apparently Raguel fried the whole hospital, along with the back-up regenerator. He blacked out complete wards, I mean nurses, doctors, patients, everyone. He wanted to take his sweet time with you, I bet. When the machines failed, they lost twelve patients. They got everything up and running now and are calling it a gas leak. Nothing on the body though. Looks like our secret is safe once more.” Sam doesn’t look particularly happy when he says that. Dean nods quietly, grim expression settling on his face. He’ll find a way to feel guilty for those lost souls, Castiel knows this. Hearing about how far his own former brother is willing to go for his crooked ideals, sets a twisted, cold feeling in his gut; the knowledge that he’s responsible for it too. They’ll both bear the weight of these murders.
“You took your time.” His voice is nothing but a dry rasp, and he clears his throat. Cas' eyes flicker on the bruises on Dean’s face, and his hand twitches nervously. His eyes are sorrowful, the bright blue of them veiled, barely showing through.
“So, uh, the delivery guy, huh? I hope he’s not cuter than me”, he grins awkwardly and Cas rolls his eyes, concentrating on his food again.
“Hey,” Dean greets him curtly, throwing the bag on top of Sam’s notes on the table. Sam looks suitably irritated at this, rushing to swipe the bag away and Dean has to bite his cheek to keep his grimly satisfied smile in check.
“No,” Dean rasps out, but he flicks his watery eyes towards his brother, quietly signaling him to move. His mouth tastes like bile and the hospital garb clings to his skin, damp with blood and rain. He feels cold and miserable and his entire body fucking hurts.
"I'm tired of repeating this conversation again. Get your angelic ass in the bed." Although his  demeanor had been grumpy, Dean had offered a small smile that made his eyes wrinkle in a way Castiel liked, and he couldn't pull away from him. He had removed his jacket, folding it carefully on the chair and climbing into the space Dean had cleared for him in the bed. Dean had pulled his covers over him, letting his hand rest over his abdomen, and shifting his warm body closer when Castiel had settled in.
“We-we need to go, Sammy,” Dean rasps, letting Sam work in peace. Sam doesn’t answer him, instead he focuses on wiping the blood off with careful, long sweeps, and soon the cloth is soaked through. Sam swipes over the wound on his forehead and it stings, making Dean flinch involuntarily. His brother doesn’t apologize this time.
“Here you go, room 5. I’ll be in room 10, if you need me for anything.” They say their goodnights, and make their way to their room, Dean guiding Castiel forward with a steady grip on his elbow. So maybe his legs are shakier than he thought, and maybe the world around him sways and blurs around the edges, but Dean seems to have caught up on that already.
"Dean. I am so, so sorry." Castiel started to speak, gesturing helplessly with his hands. Dean raised his hand slightly, shutting the angel up immediately. Bitterness and anger rose up in him, a wildfire burning through his body. Groveling wasn't going to work. Not this time.
Dean’s not sure what wakes him up the second time. All that he knows is that he’s awake, mind clearer and throat parched like a desert. He blinks in the darkness, trying to orient himself. Hazy images and conversations pass through his mind. Stab wound, hospital and a lot of meds that makes his head dopy. Right. Dean cautiously inhales, careful not to stretch the muscles in his abdomen, and that’s when he notices the complete absence of sound. None of the machines are beeping, all the lights are off. A prickling sensation runs along his arms, his neck, like sharp, cold needles. Something’s definitely off. Dean strains his eyes, trying to find Sam, but he only can make out the shape of the empty chair on his right.
Dean lets out a breath, squeezes Cas’ hand apologetically. He doesn’t want to fight about this. Not now, when Cas is right there, within his reach.
“You don’t handle any problems, you deny they ever existed and bury them deep without ever talking about it!” Sam almost shouts back, frustrated.
“Yeah, uh, I got all this stuff I wanna donate to the shelter?” Dean explains, feeling very misplaced. He’s not used to doing this. The man gives him a small, encouraging smile, and his blue eyes draw Dean in, unable to look away.
, impossible situations they’d tried to get the top of while having each other’s backs. There had been absolute trust, mixed with desire, right from the beginning, the knowledge that they could always rely on one another. Of course, there were the bad parts, the betrayals and the angry fights, but that all made them something that they uniquely
"Is that my shirt?" He had asked immediately, eyeing Castiel's black t-shirt with a frown darkening his features. He's a ticking time bomb, Castiel had thought to himself, and this was not clearly a good day.
, but Cas’ solid weight above him brings him back in the now really quick. Girls have topped him several times, but he’s never been held down by 170 pounds of pure muscle, and he’s finding out that he’s fucking
“What do you want?” Cas asks, inches from his face, lips hovering over his, but Dean keeps getting distracted by the hard press of his cock against his crotch. Cas quirks his eyebrow knowingly, grinding their hips together and Dean moans, tilting his hips to allow the friction between them bring some relief to his trapped erection. He bites his lip to keep the noises in, and it brings Cas’ laser-sharp focus to the tiny movement.
", Dean hissed, shoving Castiel off him with force. The words felt like a dagger slipping through his armor, and he couldn’t hide the naked hurt in his eyes. Dean had hit the jackpot with that one. He was nothing. He had cast away his heritage for Dean, and now he had failed him again, lost him. Dean looked back with bleak resolve, raising his eyebrows, like he was saying
“Yes Sam, this is exactly the same as the others.” Cas speaks patiently, but there’s a sharp undertone in his deep voice, like they’ve had this conversation before. Sam sighs defeatedly and runs his fingers through his thick mane.
That’s when Castiel feels it. It feels like someone would press heavily against a thick film of plastic, slowly stretching it outward. The pressure grows in his head, and Sam’s and Dean’s voices become more distant, just background noise on which he can’t focus. He fights the disorienting feeling, taking a split second to wonder how did Raguel slip past his notice so easily.
“I could snap your neck any second. Beat you down and leave you here bloody.” Dean murmured the threats quietly, leaving their impact hang in the air like a noose. Castiel raised his eyebrows slightly, unimpressed.
“But I don’t know what their motives are. Perhaps they are some rogue group of angels, more radical in their beliefs. The fluctuations, however, are so strong that it’s causing ripples within our essences. And that can’t be good.”
“You have to let him heal you, we need all three of us for this fight. I had to take down the protective sigils to let Cas in, so the angels might be here any minute. We need you for this, please.”
“Sorry, couldn’t help it. And thanks, I’m not going to say no to that.” They fall silent after that. But there’s some tension weaved into it, and the atmosphere in the car becomes much more charged, and even Cas looks alert for the rest of the trip.
there it is, that look of sweet rapture, as Cas groans filthily and comes hard, breath stuttering and fucking his hand through it.
“What did you get, Sammy-boy?” Dean plasters on the most obnoxious grin he has in his repertoire, earning himself a patented bitch-face, a sure sign his jab has found its mark.
“You think I liked to watch him slowly killing himself? You think it was sunshine and rainbows picking him up from bars, half-passed out? I’m the one, who always had to clean up after him, deal with his drunken rage, watch him make promises he could never keep.” Dean’s not sure where the sudden outburst is coming from, but it’s bubbling beneath his skin, making his voice thinner. It’s making him sound more desperate.
talented carpenter on top of that. Show Sammy the cool shelf you’re making”, Dean interrupts, nudging Cas with his elbow, but the man shakes his head, uncomfortable with all the positive attention.
God, the smell. He wants to puke, it reeks of slaughterhouse. He covers his nose, breathing into his sleeve. Sam coughs behind him. There’s a lying figure in the middle of the room, curled up in a fetal position, unmoving.
Oh man, do I. You can come over and I can school you on the classics.” Dean answers at once, only then stopping to think if he’s coming off as too forward and pushy.
"You forget your place. I am still an angel of the lord." His broken wings spread out, useless, but ever the image of unrelenting force. Dean let out a dark, mirthless chuckle.
did this happen without him even realizing it? His brain short-circuits and the rapidly rising panic just stops, all the alarms in his head going dead silent.
“I thought you were supposed to come back tomorrow”, Dean mumbles, voice rough from remnants of sleep. He swallows around the cottony taste of his mouth, pulling the comforter tighter around himself to combat the chill of the room. The ancient, barely functioning heating system of the bunker never bothered him before, not until he had the luxury of cozying up to Cas every night. Now every time the angel leaves the bunker, sometimes for days, Dean grumbles about it and fetches thicker blankets and puts on some old, ratty woollen socks he would never be caught wearing in the daylight. Shut up, it’s not his fault he prefers to sleep with Cas.
“Not saying that the whole sweatpants-thing isn’t sexy, but I think these are in the way”, he says, smoothing his hands on Dean’s waistband, and begins to tug them downward with his underwear. Dean tries to help, and other than an almost accidental kick to Cas’ groin, they manage to get them off quite smoothly. Suddenly he feels really exposed, laying there naked like that, with no means to hide how hard he is, but before he can start to second-guess himself, Cas bends down again, licking the tip of his erection. Dean’s hips snap forward before he even realises it, cock twitching, but Cas presses him down again, firmly. Cas licks wet stripes along the shaft of the cock, mouthing his balls, and Dean’s pretty sure he’s gonna die any minute now. He groans, trying to get some air into his lungs, fingers winding in Cas’ dark hair, encouraging him. Cas sucks the tip into his mouth, easily lapping up all the precum gathered there, before he swallows Dean’s cock down his throat like an expert. There’s something too hot and incomprehensible to see Cas deepthroat him like he’s done this a thousand times, and his brain fries at the thought that behind the homely, soft exterior of this man, exists a pure sex god who’s hellbent on making Dean feel good.
“I, uh…Sheridan Road. Car-Mart. Warehouse.” Fuck it hurts. What wouldn’t he give for some whiskey now.
“You still plan on taking me to that date?” Dean asks quietly after some time, and Cas raises his head, a content smile on his lips.
“Dean.” He simply says, one word laden with all the feelings he can’t quite convey. Dean avoids his eyes, aiming for the door. The room feels like a trap again. He pauses, hand resting on the doorknob, suddenly ashamed to realize how easy it is to run away. He struggles for something to say, mouth opening and closing few times.
“Why the fuck do I keep falling for the closeted ones?” Cas groans, running his hands through his hair.
? Man, that must’ve been awkward.” Dean grins like it’s the most hilarious thing in the world, stabbing another slice of bacon with his fork, but Cas is studying him, a confused frown on his face. “Well, not necessarily. He seems like a nice man and I said I’ll think about it.”
Slowly, he becomes aware of the now quieted sobs of the nurse behind him. Shit. He has to lure the angel away.
“My Richie was never a religious man, no. But before he, um, did those unfortunate things, there was a strange look in his eyes, you know? I was out doing some gardening, and I saw him walk out, all weird-like. It’s like he was a completely different person. He looked at me once, and left without saying a word. It was after that I heard about…” The widow trails off, blinking furiously, clutching a wrinkly tissue in his hand. Dean offers him a smile that he hopes is a sympathetic one.
“Sammy, stop,” he wheezes, grips the handles just so he can have something to hold on to. Nausea makes his head spin. Apparently, Sam doesn’t hear him, and Dean tries harder, but his stomach muscles cramp and then he’s retching over the side. The chair stops at once and Sam is there, holding him up, soothing words spilling out of his mouth in a steady stream. Dean hears him distantly, but every spasm tears his wound, making his eyes water. Finally, they stop completely, the meager contents of his stomach emptied, and Dean slumps forward, boneless. Sam guides him back gently, squeezing his shoulder compassionately.
“Yeah, he asked about you.” Dean answers softly, instantly knowing what his brother was about to ask. “Even called me Sammy couple of times by accident. You know how he was. He liked to drown himself in alcohol and depression. He sat down on his worn-down chair and never really tried to get back to living again.” He’s not entirely sure, if he’s trying to make things better or worse for Sam. Either way, his brother looks at him, sort of taken back by the softly spoken bitterness in his tone.
He keeps replaying his last encounters with Dean, over and over again. Had he taken advantage of Dean’s distressed state? Had he been overly intrusive, breaking apart the last chance they had? Should he have stayed away, like he planned to, if not for his weak moment? These questions torment Castiel, and they rattle around in his skull, and it’s all so frustrating and…human. Choosing a course of action based on uncertain outcomes, decisions borne out of ‘I would like to’. They exhaust him. He knows what he wants, to stay beside Dean, but he’s not sure he can salvage anything out of the shipwreck they’ve suffered. He’s not sure if Dean wants to have anything to do with him anymore, so the question of continuing this…whatever, unnamed thing they’ve been slowly building up for years, might be off the table.
I feel like this whole story is just a love letter to Misha and his eyes, so Cas' personality might be more Misha-like than Castiel. But Misha's eyes man. MAGICAL.
He doesn’t have to wait for long; a meager amount of people start trickling in from the doors, and Cas is among them, dragging a heavy suitcase behind him, looking scruffy and exhausted. Dean can’t help the huge smile that forms on his face, heart leaping in his chest, and his legs start slowly carrying him towards Cas, like he’s drawn to him. Cas spots him, and the echoing smile Dean gets in return, is equally soft and delighted. And suddenly Dean just
