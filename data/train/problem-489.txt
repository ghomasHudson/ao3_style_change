Curt glanced to John, and then back to Sherlock. Without a word, he stepped away and then around the table.
“Wait, I thought you were at your sister’s last night?” John’s brows furrowed, and his voice sounded horribly loud and felt agonizingly visceral.
Curt cleared his throat, “Yeah, I met someone. Not like a relationship or anything, but a friend. A good friend, turns out.”
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath, and froze. The sound of his own heartbeat had him dizzy and catatonic.
He was taken aback at first, but John’s humor was infectious and put Sherlock somewhat at ease. He couldn’t help the small smile that mirrored John’s, “Yes.”
John heard the closure of a zipper, registered the movement’s of Curt’s arms as the stranger presumably refastened the button on his best friend’s trousers.
Although, he had half a mind to approach John as soon as possible, and berate him for his texting Mycroft over such trivial matters.
Through the slat of vision that his squinting afforded, he saw the person who shared the bed. A man face-down, dark hair just above the nape of his neck. His cervical vertebra stuck out above the collar of a white t-shirt. For a wicked, torturous instant, his eyes went wide and mouth fell open. He covered a thoughtless whisper behind a sweaty palm that had risen unbidden to his lips, “Sherlock…”
Jack shook his head and was laughing as the retired army doctor disappeared from the pub in a flash of energy. Oh, to be that young again, life full of possibilities. He silently wished the man luck, and drank to his courage.
There was no danger there. Sherlock wouldn’t go back to that life, anyway. Curt had Hoija. And Sherlock had John. There was nothing to worry about. He shook his head at himself, ascending the stairs to their flat and readying himself for bed.
Sherlock took that single step, instantly crowding Curt’s personal space, taking up all the oxygen in the room.
“Explain how you managed to jump from a six story window with nothing but a few cuts to show for it,” Sherlock demanded, back to his usual blunt style of interfacing.
“What about Arthur Stuart?” John heard himself ask, trying to keep up with Sherlock’s chain of reasoning.
John’s chest cavity seemed to swell to bursting. He watched Sherlock’s face, and finally knew what he needed to do.
“Nightmares,” Sherlock said, and in that one word, John heard something pretty damned scary: naked, intimate understanding. His heart clenched like a fist and throttled like a jackhammer.
Sherlock had taken these criticisms rather seriously as of late, and was putting in quite a bit of work towards self-betterment (in accordance with John). Sherlock knew he could not change who he was at the very core, but perhaps John’s requests were not all that unreasonable [Eat. Sleep. Be nicer. Clean.]. They were tedious, surely, but what was the reward?
Curt Wild lay dead with bullet wounds riddling his chest. One had gotten his throat. The blood was being washed away, across the sidewalk and into the sewer grate. The steel gray eyes were looking up into the sky, unblinking as raindrops fell upon them. An eerie sight.
Sherlock made a sound between a whimper and a moan, and the last vestiges of rational thought eased from him like poison from a wound.
Sherlock choked on a silenced moan, chin dropping to his chest as his own hands clamped down on the table behind him. His frost-green eyes were half-lidded, dilated with pleasure, breath shallow.
She gestured gracefully to the room beyond a set of curtains in the far wall. She ushered him in, and he set the box carefully down on the large work table. The place smelled of lacquer, varnish, wood dust and solder.
Sherlock pulled up his chair, close to the bed, and deposited himself there. He reached out to take hold of John’s hand, and the other man squeezed back, unrelentingly so. There was a noise at the door, but Sherlock did not look up.
“Bad time?” John’s voice was brisk, cold. His eyes followed Curt like the man had a loaded gun in his hand.
We shared a protracted silence after that, just gaped at it, in a kind of awe. I shook my head once as if to break a spell.
The bartender was folded in on herself at the bar, large, kohl-rimmed eyes scanning the small cellphone in her hands. It was so dim in the pub that the white-blue glow lit her orangey tanned face. The mass of split ends were highlighted like a halo around her narrow features. Her focus on the phone was absolute.
A subtle squeeze from Sherlock’s hand had Curt’s vision narrowing with overwhelming desire and adrenaline.
There was the sound of a throat clearing from the entry behind him. He swirled. There, standing in their flat, was Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock’s skin was warm. John’s hand was cold from being outside. Sherlock wrapped his fingers around John’s. He watched as John slumped forward, bowing his head, hiding his face in his free hand. He was trembling, clinging to Sherlock’s grasp as if it were a lifeline.
“I can’t remember if it was yours. What does it matter?” he asked, accompanied by a sigh and a roll of the eyes.
His bedroom was already condensed into two large boxes, two small boxes, and a sea bag. He perused the rest of the flat for any other items that might belong to him. It was a near physical effort to prevent himself from becoming waylaid by memories and keep productive.
It was half past noon before Curt Wild was once again inside 221B Baker Street, possibly for the last time.
Sherlock had listened to it all. Curt wasn’t one to talk needlessly, or add extraneous details. A highlight of his character, in Sherlock’s opinion. Finally, he asked, “Did you give him anything when you met at the bar?”
He recalled her petite form, her quick, assessing eyes and her welcoming smile. Moira had been her name! And he would talk of his new position at Redfearn and Ivy, a charitable medical practice that had accepted his application the same day he had submitted it. Something told him she would appreciate the charitable aspect of his new job. Maybe enough to accept a dinner invitation. Maybe more.
John came to stand within Sherlock’s personal space, head cocked slightly to the side. He looked up from Sherlock’s exposed clavicle, up the naked throat where John saw Sherlock swallow hard, those full, pink lips, and then the dazzling silver green of Sherlock’s wary eyes.
It took John too long to register what Anderson had specifically said, but he did finally see the importance of moving along... as in following Anderson's jogging sillouhette farther down Baker Street and away from grumpy gift shop owners.
Sherlock exhaled shakily through parted lips, trying and failing to right himself, to care about Reality again.
Hoija looked to Lestrade, and then back to Sherlock. With a strange, lost kind of expression taking over her face, she said, “The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.”
Sherlock was a relentless wave set upon the shore: revisiting, softening, and then crashing back in. Biting, worshipping, soothing, crushing. Undulating hips and firecrackers of pain set off in a dizzying pattern of exquisite stimulus until Curt’s knees turned to jelly and his legs gave.
ATTN: I edited and updated the first chapter as of the posting of this new chapter (01/30/17). I had to expand a touch on Mystrade, because sometimes... Johnlock hurts too much.
Sherlock had been holding some strange, fleshy looking thing in the pincers of stainless steel tongs. The thing was indeed beginning to ooze and drip.
John almost flinched in surprise when Sherlock’s fingers finally came to respond in kind, encircling his friend’s hand with likewise surety. They stood silent for the longest moment, holding hands, standing pressed together, side by side.
What was happening?! John seemed content to wait, the line of heat building between them. Sherlock felt he was sweating beneath his clothes even as a shiver travelled through him.
The Sherlock imposter snuffled and groaned quietly, turning in his sleep so that John could see his face.
“Four Roses, please,” John ordered the bourbon when it was apparent the bartender wasn’t going to immediately acknowledge him.
Curt watched Sherlock with bald interest, watched those eyes rapidly scan back and forth as if speed reading some phantom book. There was nothing on earth that had compared to intimacy (albeit drugged intimacy) with the young genius before him.
Sherlock felt like he was on the edge of a cliff, looking over, experiencing that strange pull-push vertigo that had him rocking back on his heels.
Sherlock struggled not to blush. “It’s not your concern,” he pointed out, softer than he had intended.
John’s eyes darkened, “You were more than just brilliant. Sherlock, you were the most beautiful… sexual… thing I have ever seen.”
Curt’s body and the dead woman’s body were being covered with black tarps. Sherlock turned away from the scene, looking up into the sky. The rain was easing up now, coming down in soft, light pellets.
When Sherlock felt a reciprocating caress of foot, he debated whether or not to even acknowledge it. For a while, they sat in near silence. The crackle and pop of the fire highlighted their newborn intimacy.  Languidly and with heavily lidded eyes, Sherlock finally raised his head and met John’s gaze. It was dark and dreamy, like a man secure in the thought that he had everything he could ever need and then some.
Curt shifted under the doctor’s calculating gaze. He cleared his throat, expression utterly serious and open. He leaned back, hands rubbed on his jean-clad knees, “I’m sober, clean… uh, sixteen months now. I don’t even drink. I’m not lookin’ to revisit all that or anything. Just... Sherlock texted me out of the blue, said he had something for me.”
John rounded the corner in too big of a hurry, crashing into one man and almost bowling over another.
Sherlock seemed to be leaving some things out but what he did share was remarkable. He chose not to go into detail about the worst of it. His aversion to these tales was caused by many things, things Sherlock would have to parse through on his own at some point.
Sherlock seemed to weigh John’s words. He had not considered Curt’s potential emotional vulnerability. He had to be pretty damned affected.
He looked around at the mess and, as if on autopilot, walked to the closet in order to retrieve the broom. He swept up the detritus mechanically, making a small pile on the carpet. He hunted for pieces in the chairs, under the tables, picked them up and, soon enough, there was a mound of wood and metal that had once been a priceless instrument. His vision blurred again, and he saw Sherlock’s bloody body on the pavement.
Sherlock growled softly in response to his own question, seemingly unaware of what he was doing. He minutely ground his hips into Curt. Sherlock’s lips parted as he felt increasingly out of breath, images and sensations flooded him beyond his control. He tilted his head back at the alien pleasure, at the memory of it all.
“Ugh,” John groaned as he felt the messy, gloved hands go around him, knowing the damage was done but not really minding too much.
The immense relief at losing his mind should have bothered Sherlock, but John was there, kissing him, taking Control of the Need.
Five months. Seven days. Oh, seven days, already? Okay, another week had passed then. Five months, and a week, since Sherlock’s call.
The implications of Curt’s position were overwhelming, blurring all of Sherlock’s senses into one. It was all that mattered, forgetting himself and altering reality to encompass just the pleasure. It was not personal or sentimental, this exchange. It was necessary, like a dose of medicine. Like a hit.
And it took John too long to realize what… exactly… he was seeing. His feet became unsteady as his world collapsed at the edges. Sherlock.
The dismanteling of Sherlock's civilized facade was probably the Very Best part of sex with the genius. It was kind of like a power trip, heady and addictive.
John could not help the dark thought that creeped upon him now, that it would have been better, in some ways, if Sherlock really had been dead. Because now he had hope, and hope would be his undoing.
John would never grow tired of this sight. Of the vision of Sherlock Holmes completely undone with John’s name on his lips. This moment was better than the act of sex itself, and John got to witness it nearly every day. No longer holding Sherlock up, John slid his hand over Sherlock’s hip and thigh, then grabbed tight as he coaxed the last needed ounce of pleasure from himself.
“I thought it was just a one-off,” John admitted. “The thrill of something unexpected, coupled with how striking you looked but no...I was captivated right from the beginning.”
The question had intentions that Sherlock didn’t know how to grasp, so he chose not to respond. That was usually the best approach in these types of moments.
What would he think? If he opened that laptop to find anything else; a spreadsheet of the case, or even of the mould samples in the fridge, what would he think?
With a small chuckle, John is released from Sherlock’s embrace and looks around the shop with a little less wariness. His eyes linger on a few promising key chains before settling in on a tiny area filled with pride centric underclothing that include pants and very comfortable looking socks.
Whatever Sherlock’s initial misgivings were, John has no bloody idea, but he is intuitive enough to know when his honour is being besmirched. Although John’s activities last night weren’t anywhere near the heights of Victorian sensibilities, he also wasn’t
Sally felt John enter the room before she heard the sound of his footfalls. It was something that seemed indelible about how Dr. Watson was. A presence of warmth that seemed to travel around him. Perhaps that’s what caused something as cold as Sherlock Holmes to lean in whatever direction John was located. Even the most poisonous of flowers still needed the energy of the sun to survive.
Bending over and making sure that the curve of his arse was very well within John's view from the kitchen table, Sherlock opened up the side table drawer and took out a pair of intensely sharp scissors and slinked back to where John still sat trembling in his chair.
It’s the simple and straightforward answer that Molly has hoped for, but finds that she now is reeling with how to process this now confirmed information. In all honesty, she hasn’t gotten past this part in her head.
Two drinks later, John is slightly closer to Sherlock’s seat. His bright blue eyes flick from the small stack of papers now on the wooden table to Sherlock, busy looking at his own, private notes once more.
“Happy now?” John huffs as we get into another cab about an hour later, but there is no real annoyance behind his words. Besides, I’ll make it up to him when we get back to the flat. Repeatedly, if my stamina can keep up with his.
She was a doctor, and a good one. She was a friend, and a great one. That’s why when John Watson called her out of the blue to invite her to lunch, she said
of all people?” Sherlock’s voice is getting firmer as he becomes more frustrated by Irene’s lack of answers and riddle-like tone.
An old uni friend then. Neither had stayed in contact enough to know what stage the other was at in their life, but they had been close enough to recognise each other from voice alone. Close, but not enough to stay in touch, so a casual friend. An old fling? No, Sherlock wouldn’t allow himself to deduce that much. He wasn’t the jealous type, or, at least he didn’t think he was, but he’d rather not know.
they were always had hidden motives or secret agendas. And Sherlock had seen the way John looked at him--John may have thought he’d covered his botched flirting attempt during their first case at Angelo’s, but Sherlock knew better. He just hadn’t anticipated that John would ever admit it to himself. Sherlock had never imagined that John’s heterosexuality would peel away with the layers of their clothing, and the newly uncovered bisexuality be so comfortable in its nakedness.
I think, therefore, I am. All of this, Irene, the morgue, his mind palace — this is all just neurotransmitters being released in his brain. Something is registering them; some portion of his brain is still alive. Maybe he can stop this. Maybe he can find a way back.
The next chapter of Behind Closed Doors is finally here!! We are so excited to share it with you!! 😍😍😍 Hope you all love it and can let us know with some kudos and comments 😘 thanks so much for your continued support!!
“I spent over two weeks reading over the most recent research of prostate stimulation, John...I deleted a level nine case from a year and a half ago to give proper storage to have your ejaculate shoot onto the ceiling, and no amount of your grumpiness over -- “
The lump of fabric moves lazily and despite himself, John stares as the heavy duvet falls from the mattress enough to reveal a long section of slender pale leg and part of a very supple arse. A bright red handprint is near the curve of the right cheek and John barely catches his breath at the sight.
“Not sure. Didn’t hang around long enough to check. Think I was too focused on his cock to notice if he had a ring on his finger.”
The familiar knock on the door became daily instead of weekly, and Martha made more elaborate dishes. Soups with fancy spices, and succulent meat dishes that permeated throughout her flat. John would stay longer, and every so often he’d giggle as she gossiped about her bridge club. Life wasn’t brilliant flashes of color anymore, but life had settled into a muted shade of something much easier on the eyes.
“The victim nestled a gun into some of the branches, and used a long string and placed himself in the best spot to get shot. The scream that the witness heard was from the person who was told to wait in the vehicle on the main road. More than likely, they had no idea of how suicidal the man was.”
The last part of the accusation was lost to the sound that Mycroft Holmes made when his patience had run dry. The resemblance to Sherlock was uncanny, and one wondered if pacing was a hereditary trait. Mycroft dropped his umbrella along with any lingering politeness.
At first, Sherlock would ignore them. John would toss the garments into the laundry basket when he had the time and was less exhausted from the surgery. Eventually, however, Sherlock would pick them up on his own and hold them close. Press the woollen blend up to his nose and inhale deep and long and silently pray that John didn’t make a surprise appearance to ask him what the hell he was doing. As if Sherlock could even answer that himself.
However, as they ascended the stairs, the persistent fear returned in full force. He tried to dislodge it, focusing on John in front of him, but the more he acknowledged it, the larger it grew.
“I don’t want...to die.” His voice finally breaks, misery seeping into every syllable, but he no longer cares. All pretensions evaporate and what is left is a sinew and sweat of what Sherlock is when face to face with unavoidable surrender. It’s the same expression that he now knows was hidden behind John’s clenched fingers in that photograph, now scorched forevermore inside his memory.
“But you don’t get upset with each other?” He thought he kept the mask up, but something must have slipped because her brow furrowed slightly.
“Good evening, darling. Are you excited for tomorrow? I’ve made reservations at St Pancras Spa for afternoon tea at two o’clock, with a couple of treatments afterwards. All you need to do is turn up and be beautiful, which should be easy for you.” Irene answers the phone in a rush of words, immediately radiating her easy self-confidence. Molly envies her ability to feel at home in herself, to walk with pride despite the world constantly telling her that she doesn’t belong.
“Give him air,” John shouts. His eyes dart wildly around, not knowing where to inspect first. Sherlock’s face. His chest. The crown of his head. Everything hurts, but Sherlock only can stare up in wonder at what he almost lost.
Sherlock stops the video and clears his throat before pocketing the mobile. John in turn is about to have a heart attack in the presence of a madman. A madman who he evidently promised he would be his date to a very public event in less than two week’s time.
had sex before,” Sherlock snaps, not sure where this uncomfortable conversation is headed. “And even if I hadn’t, I’m an adult who gave you consent...and what does it have to do with you making me an incubus?”
“I must admit I have an ulterior motive for our lunch,” John said. “Needed to get some information that I… wasn’t in the best place to ask for until now.”
He smiled, shuffling backwards so their bodies lay flush against each other. He hadn’t been sure if this would happen—the casual physicality outside of sex. It wasn’t like he had much experience with it. Most of his other encounters had ended the moment they reached orgasm, both parties hastily cleaning themselves up and returning to their own lives. This, this was new.
Waking up from death can be a challenge for someone who rarely sleeps. Thankfully John is there to lend a hand, and to tell his story.
“I want to hear you say it.” She commands, steadily crossing the room, her heels clicking against the wooden floor, echoing loudly in Sherlock’s ears. She comes to rest at the foot of the bed, taking the crop in both hands and inspecting its length. Despite the dress, the heels and the whip, this isn’t the woman anymore. Her face is gaunt and tight, bones almost breaking through the skin. Her limbs are ashen and spindly, far too long for an ordinary human. Each eye is dark and sunken into her skull, barely visible in the dim light.
The restaurant had scared him. John was bringing out a side of Sherlock he hadn’t anticipated; this side that
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief, barely stifling the grin that was threatening to break across his face.
Then erupted a sound from the phone that John had not expected at all. A high-pitched giggle that he had not heard since he discovered that Sherlock was quite ticklish under the right quantities of oxytocin.
A  rush of footfall echoes in  the hallway behind, and before John has time to think, the door is opening, revealing a stress-ridden Sherlock on the other side. John stares for a moment, trying to take it all in. Sherlock’s curls look as if they haven’t been properly styled for days. The cheekbones he adores are even more pronounced. When had Sherlock last eaten?
Soon, they were back to kissing again, rushed and wantingly. John was almost lying on top of Sherlock now, supporting his weight on his arms.
When Sherlock looks up at him, ever so briefly before closing his eyes again, it makes something inside of John ache. He thinks that Sherlock looks so, so tired, deep lines around his weary eyes. And for the first time ever, it dawns on John that not even Sherlock Holmes is immune to ageing.
Sherlock made a sudden move to reach for the bottle. He refilled John's glass, then his own. Through something of a miracle, almost all of the liquid made it into the tumblers.
”Oh god, oh god,” he mumbled to Sherlock’s lips, kissed him without pause as Sherlock kept stroking and palming him.
”I would really have loved to, Sherlock, but I have Anna tomorrow. I’m picking her up at nine in the morning.”
The words came out more vicious than he had planned, but he was feeling angry all of a sudden. He kept on.
John was shaking his head, slowly, he was staring at Sherlock as if he didn’t believe him. Sherlock just stared back, raised his eyebrows in an annoyed gesture.
They had stepped inside the restaurant to discover there were only a handful of guests there, although the kitchen seemed quite busy preparing take-out orders.
John? Didn’t notice him getting up. Why has he left? Everything had been so much better if he’d been here, because then he’d been able to assess how John is going to go about it all, now, after… after all this.
”No worries.” John is thankfully smiling. He flops down onto the bed, pats the empty space next to him. Sherlock lies down and John wraps an arm around him, pulls him closer. Whispers with wet lips into his ear.
. It’s tearing him apart, to stand there and not have any idea what John is going to say. What does he
John looked down. He was hiding something, but what? Something about gay sex, Sherlock deduced. The only thing in this world that could make John Watson blush, he knew that since long before. Maybe it was just too difficult for John to say. He’d figure it out later.
”You’ll be pleased to hear that I didn’t! So I guess that makes it a good day for you and a bad for me!” Greg was smiling, and John winced a little when Greg leaned in way too close to his ear, in that way that people only did when drunk.
“I'm not a murderer!” John shouted back, and in doing so, he gestured with the limp animal in his grip, no doubt unintentionally.
“I know what you'd get off to.” John smiled, still leaned forward in his chair, while Sherlock was doing the opposite, pressing back into his chair to maximize the distance from John.
John slowly lowered himself down on the floor with his back against the wall. He gave the cold tiles next to him two short pats.
”Sherlock. Christ.” John swallowed, tried to focus his mind enough to speak coherently. ”You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. You’re absolutely gorgeous.”
”John. I love you. I meant to say it, always, but then I never did. There were so many times when I came close. Like on the phone that time, from the rooftop- but then I thought, you know, maybe that would ruin how you’d think of me when I was gone-”
For the first time since they sat down, Sherlock spoke. ”But you were not,” he said, sounding slightly annoyed.
She laughed, a kind laugh and John tried to look relaxed when he smiled back. Before he could reply, she continued:
John happened to say out loud the first thing that came to his mind, because to be honest, at this point he was not really fit for conversation.
The man smiled politely towards them. ”Hi guys, nice to meet you,” he said, then added, ”Charlotte, you look lovely,” and kissed her lightly on the cheek. ”Mark was a great support to me in the early days.”
. His noises turned into sharper exclamations as John started to twist his hand on every upstroke, gliding over the head with his thumb.
”It’s just.. I still can’t believe it. Seems we actually got our happy ending, after all this bloody time.”
It had been right in front of him, all those years. And now he wondered; if he just hadn't been so goddamn uptight about it all - could Sherlock have been his?
”No. Not really,” he smiled, and Sherlock looked relieved. But then, John felt he actually, sincerely wanted to say something nice. ”He was a good guy though.”
, he says before leaping down the stairs, three steps at a time, and then he’s gone, just like that. But before the heavy front door shuts, John is back, leans inside. Sherlock is still in his pyjamas and dressing gown, looking down from the top of the stairs.
John grabs a hold of Sherlock’s waist, as if to anchor himself for a moment. Then, he slowly runs his other hand down Sherlock’s stomach, past his hip and down to his thigh. ”Look how hard you are,” John murmurs, voice low and hoarse. ”All for me?”
Sherlock felt himself getting absolutely overwhelmed with emotion. He could tell it was only a matter of seconds for both of them, now.
“Yes,” he replies, the word mumbled, eyes averted. He is aware of his heart, beating like crazy, reverberating against his ribs. “I meant to, yes.”
”You know I-” John began. Sherlock noticed John’s clenched fists, dilated pupils, quicker respiration. John spoke again, his words short, broken.
’Dust is an essential part of my filing system!’ he had once yelled at poor Mrs. Hudson when she had been kind enough to tidy up the flat.
No room for Sherlock Holmes and the never ending drama that came with him. Especially not with the way he had been recently, solving cases with a frenzy that John had never seen before.
“Sherlock.” His voice was thick from sleep. ”It’s only four thirty here, can I call you back in two hours?”
Holding Sherlock’s gaze with intensive focus, John let his palm, in a decisive gesture, fall heavy, straight down on Sherlock’s cock.
just finally saw his chance to put to use some of those video clips he’s accumulated of you, over the years. It was funny.”
”Shut up Mycroft!” he shoots back, angry now. ”At least I weren’t too fat to fit in my school uniform.”
to text you! Enjoy it while it lasts. My girls are 20 and 22 and you wouldn’t believe the struggle it was, getting them to tell me their whereabouts the last few years they were living at home.” She puts her cup down. ”They’re clinging for dear life to their phones every hour of the day, but somehow, letting their poor parents know they’re still alive proved to be an insurmountable task.”
John started to kiss his way down Sherlock’s body, stopping briefly to suck on his nipples, first one, then the other. He kissed the large scar over his heart, so gently. Sherlock knew what John was thinking, and he squirmed a bit to get John away from there, not wanting those thoughts to get too firm a grip on John tonight.
When John is in the loo getting ready, Sherlock hurries to change into his pyjamas, turns the lights out but then changes his mind and quickly flicks it on again. When John comes back, dressed in pyjama pants and a grey t-shirt, Sherlock has just managed to flop down on the roll-out mattress he got from the storage closet in the upstairs hallway. He sees the surprised look at John’s face, but before he has the chance to say anything, Sherlock promptly turns off the light, the room turning almost pitch black.
Sherlock slowly stretches, unfolds his long legs, begins to stand up. He brushes something -crumbles from the burger bread?- from his coat, straightens his back.
He searched for John's eyes, smiled, and when he was certain he was at an angle where the Japanese wouldn’t be able to see it, he winked.
In the early morning hours, John awoke. For a blissful few seconds, he did not remember, but when it all came back to him, it felt like a knife stab in the guts.
“Why are you wearing my clothes?” Sherlock asks when his mind has settled slightly. He opens his eyes and sees Irene's smile broaden as she lifts up her arm to refasten the sleeve of the purple button-down.
There was a rustle of sound to Sherlock’s right. John, peeling himself out of the hedgerow with his hands raised.
compared to you getting anywhere near Sherlock's pants. Not that I really wanted all the details, but you have no idea what he’s  like on a regular week. I have it on good authority that he's tried to poison Anderson on at least three occasions…not that I can really blame Sherlock for that. Phillip is scum for what he did."
“The place belongs to Ms. Adler,” John says to Sherlock’s questioning look. “We’ll be meeting her in the morning to give some input on how you might have become a Belstaff vampire.”
“Oh I don’t know why specifically. He’s just so testy lately, and I’m not sure I’ve been helping, especially because I…” John sighs, unsure as to whether to admit what had transpired between them. “I let it slip that I love him.”
Lestrade finds another body that he thinks is related to their serial murderer case. Each victim has been killed with the same MO as Michael Pierce, a serial killer they had arrested only months before. The victims have been strangled and dumped in parks around London, a single key found in their left pockets. The yard is stumped; they definitely arrested the right man, he confessed as soon as they interrogated him. And yet here are more bodies, killed in the same way, whilst Michael is safe behind bars.
There was one thing in life Sherlock deplored more than boring cases, and that was cold ones. The stink of failure hung like rotting fingertips left too long in the vegetable crisper, and that was unacceptable in every conceivable way. Lestrade had seemed to take the lack of new leads in stride, trying to encourage Sherlock to review some of the files over again for potential overlooked information.
Over the next few weeks, he’d poured over the books, learning everything he could about the community to which he belonged. He learnt about Stonewall, the riots that helped kickstart the queer civil rights movement in America; the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK, barring the clause that insisted that the age of consent for gay men was 21 rather than the ordinary 16; section 28, which forbade local authorities from ‘promoting sexuality’. It made sense now, why all his teachers had side-stepped his questions. They legally weren’t allowed to answer.
Sherlock’s footfalls are in perfect time with the glorious voice of Whitney Houston, and John finds that not smiling just isn’t an option anymore. All of the faces that flicker by are warm and open and more accepting than ever dreamed. Even a group of cute men call out that he and Sherlock look fabulous.
”Um,” John says. ”I’m sorry but you don’t seem that way. You’re trembling, and your face is white as a sheet.”
John goes from the hotel bathroom to the mirrored closet door, stands in front of it while he buttons his shirt. He’d meant to iron it but then chosen to crash on the bed for an hour instead, the events of last night and today taking their toll. His phone chimes, he goes to the desk to get it from the charger.
He let his fingertip trace Sherlock's handwriting, scattered across the margins of research papers and scientific articles. There were the usual underlinings and circles; the angry question marks and interested exclamation points and the occasional 'Idiot!' scribbled in gigantic letters over an entire page.
They both tried to pull apart, but it was difficult, so very difficult to let go. Then, a rough voice, shouting from a fairly short distance, startled them both.
Close friends as they had been, they had never talked about sexual preferences or relationships, well not if you didn’t count that horribly awkward conversation the first night, at Angelo’s.
But all John had thought about last night, was that if he in some way could win Sherlock over, he would stop at nothing to do so.
Some of Sherlock's lines here about Victor Trevor are quotes or near-quotes from ACD's The Adventure of the Gloria Scott.
John’s gaze lingers on Sherlock’s mouth, on those parted, swollen lips, and a mental image pops up in John’s head. It’s a vivid memory of what it had looked like, on a night not too long ago, when Sherlock had sucked him off and then encouraged him to come over his open mouth, over his waiting, obscenely stretched out tongue, his eyes locked in contact with John’s.
“I'm going to go to Sheila's, she invited me over. I'll bring the stroller so Anna can go to sleep there. Don't wait up.”
The curtains in Sherlock’s room were drawn and they had locked the door and pushed the desk in front of it for good measure.
Sherlock felt his own erection against John’s lower stomach, and got dizzy from the touch and from the thought that only thin pieces of fabric separated them.
Every once in a while, there would be a particularly load thump coming from the upstairs floor, and he'd pause to look up to the ceiling, wondering what the hell was going on in his old bedroom. Sherlock had been manically busy the last couple of days, going through the vast stacks of papers and journals and random experimental equipment that had been building up there over the last two years.
“No. No, you don't 'know me in the biblical sense'. That would require more than observation and deduction, no matter how brilliant, I'm afraid.”
He tried to shake off the uncomfortable feeling that had come over him. Could there be any truth in what she was saying?
Mary locked her eyes on John’s. ”Sherlock’s a psychopath, how could you let yourself forget that? Manipulation, that’s like his core competence.”
Sherlock's words and the intense intimacy of it all went straight to John's dick. He reached down a hand inside his pants, gave it a few rapid strokes just to ease a bit of the maddening tension that was building up.
He saw Sherlock and knew. The love that John had felt from the first day they had met, really, he had held it at such a desperate distance for so long. And after the Baker Street incident, the had struggled with questions about his sexual identity, never getting any wiser. The impossible practicalities regarding his life with Mary and his daughter.
There is something else, something sharper, pointer, in John’s eyes as he says it, but Sherlock can’t put his finger on what. Also, it doesn’t help that John is using strange words that Sherlock has never heard of. Deducing John will have to wait a bit, he decides. He needs his focus now to get through telling this story.
”Sherlock,” John said, and he could immediately tell that he was going to say something along the more serious lines.
”Yeah, I noticed,” John says. Sherlock gets the feeling he’s about to say something else, something more serious, but thankfully he doesn’t. They’re quiet, for a while, Sherlock tries to force his breathing into a normal rate.
”Are you sure?” A crease has formed between Sherlock’s brows, concern in his eyes still. ”Because it absolutely feels like-” his voice trickles off for a second, ”it really does, and that would be, er, quite undignified, frankly, and-”
”Eddie, really?” said Sherlock, now suddenly back again, focusing his attention on Gabe. ”Eddie Walker is here? Haven’t seen him in years.”
John withdraws his fingers, sits up more on the bed. Fumbles around to find the condoms, rolls one on with a shaky hand. He’s harder than he’s been in a very, very long time. Sherlock takes a pillow and pushes it underneath his hips, then blindly pats his hand around the mattress until he finds the bottle of lube. John takes it from him, then applies a generous amount on himself and Sherlock.
John laughs a little. ”Still a difficult patient, huh?” and is happy when he gets a faint smile and a shrug in return.
Hell, all he wanted was to be able to focus fully on Sherlock. He wanted to be allowed to resume his job of keeping him safe and well, and he needed to promptly eliminate the competition that had presented itself in the form of a smug, good for nothing junkie.
He sees her eyes flicker a little, she licks her lips. ”Oh, Right. I wasn’t thinking about your ex-wife, but…” She looks away, doesn’t say anything else.
“Your frequency is fairly consistent, with a median rate of five times a week, when you aren't dating or working double shifts. Low is three and high is nine times in a seven day period, with a rather even distribution of location between bed and shower. Although you do tend to prefer the bed, usually at night or early morning, lying on your back with your knees slightly up and out. When you do it in the shower, you are almost always standing up, leaning back against the tiles.” He raised his tumbler, took another sip.
It had felt so good to indulge in those fantasies, and they had played a fairly major part in getting him through both isolation and torture, when he was away. But back in London again, pain and shame would always follow in their wake.
”Do you like this? Is this good?” John asked from down there. Sherlock forced himself to meet John’s eyes, and saw fire in them.
Daddy sighs. ”Well, alright then. Grab something from the kitchen if you’re feeling peckish. Good night, Sherlock.”
John reaches up to grab Sherlock’s shoulders, finally pulls him close again. ”Yes, you did,” he whispers smilingly, lips ghosting over Sherlock’s.
”I thought we agreed on no gifts this year,” Sherlock says angrily, then sits back down again in his chair with a very heavy sigh. ”But Mummy seems hell-bent on taking it one step further.”
John sees Sherlock quickly looking down, not saying anything more. Ah, right. Assumptions about things being in a way they can’t be, not with Sherlock.
a need for so called catching up. Can’t deduce details in the past like that, and John certainly can’t deduce things if his life depended on it.
"What?? Nothing…? I DIED for YOU, John. It was the only way to save you from Moriarty. He had snipers on you! On you and Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson. I spent two years in exile, doing things I had never done before. I… I made a mistake in Serbia, a big one and they got me John. I have scars all over my back but I was willing to pay that price if it would keep you safe. And I thought I was going to die, and sometimes I wished that I would, but the thought of coming back to you kept me going. And -”
And even though John would rather avoid the question, the doctor in him feels it has to be asked. ”Do you, um. Would you say that you have hallucinations?”
Apparently he is not the only one feeling this, because he notices, with surprise, that the lower rims of Sherlock’s silvery eyes are beginning to fill.
“Oh fuck, baby,” John grunted in response. He kept moving his dick along Sherlock's arse, in a nice and steady rhythm. Sherlock noticed that John's shoulder was beginning to tremble from the effort of keeping his upper body raised for so long.
Without planning to, Sherlock found he had moved his hands to hold onto John’s hipbones, where they protruded through muscles and skin and blue denim jeans. And oh dear god, John was not late to follow.
John slides his hand down, slowly, all the way from Sherlock’s neck, brushing over his right nipple, then further down, teasing for a moment with his hand held still right above, in the soft hair there, before finally placing a tight fist around Sherlock’s cock.
“But you are,” he said. “Why? Why is this embarrassing you, Sherlock, I haven't known you to be the blushing type. Come on. Tell me what you've deduced.”
”I’m fine, just fine. And perfectly capable of taking care of myself.” Sherlock adds, mumblingly, ”As I’ve done for quite some time now.”
”You hide behind a cool facade of rationality. But I think you struggle with how to cope when your emotions overpower your logic. I also think you are very lonely. Not because you don’t have people who care about you, I’m certain you do, but because you don’t know how to relate to them. You never learned.”
”I think it is.” He gets up from his chair, hopes that John will say something but he doesn’t even seem to notice.
“Alright, so maybe it does. So what. I guess you missed that talking about sex is also on my list of turn-ons.” He met Sherlock's gaze and was very pleased to see that he'd managed to get him to waver. Only for less than a second, but still. A small victory. He was going to take back control of this thing.
When John had left the flat, Sherlock felt like crying, regret and anxiety coming creeping into his skin like it always did. He intensely wished John would change his mind, come back home. Wrap his arms around Sherlock and kiss him and say that he was sorry, and tell him that he loved him and all those nice things he usually did.
John hadn't felt jealous at all, really, since they'd gotten together, but now it was suddenly threatening to consume him. He tried very hard to not let it show.
Horribly bright daylight is trickling in through the gaps at the sides of the curtains. Did he draw them last night? No recollection of that.
It had felt… so good. Too good. He had let down his guard and allowed himself to bask in the warm, shining light that was John. It had felt wonderful but had ruined months of hard work.
, as anything other than an erotic innuendo. Sherlock didn’t see how it could possibly be so, but then again, it made that almost kiss somewhat more understandable.
It was almost as if it had been decided beforehand, a shared, unspoken expectation. This was the way the evening was supposed to end. Just tired, he reminded himself as they began making their way to her flat.
”You look well,” he said to Sherlock, then instantly regretted it. He really had not meant to imply anything about drugs, and certainly not within the first five minutes after they’d sat down, yet that was probably precisely how it had come across to Sherlock.
And that finally gets John moving. He’s pressing his lips tight together, straightens his back once more.
”YOU made it abundantly clear that you were NOT interested, alright? Married to your work, those were your exact words because I remember them very well, thank you. And then you repeatedly told me that love was for losers, that you were above all that shit, and then! And then! You left me!”
He also remembered how, when the flat was almost completely covered in darkness, he had forced himself up from the floor, stumbled across the room and onto the sofa, pulled the blanket up over his head and tried to go to sleep.
”No need for small talk to catch up with you,” John says, still smiling. ”Yeah, I might return to surgery. And Rosie’s with Mary. Stays with me every other weekend now, difficult with the school schedule and all.” John glances at Sherlock, then away. "The divorce was finalised about a year ago, but surely you've deduced that already."
John, who had left Baker Street when Sherlock was away. John, who was living with Mary in one of those white new ugly boring houses, with ugly boring neighbors. With furniture that still had that unpleasant odor of new; of chemicals to prevent them from being stained by the obligatory glass of red wine on Friday nights by the telly, and more chemicals to prevent them from suddenly bursting into flames. When did furniture ever spontaneously combust? Neither John nor Mary smoked, and Sherlock felt fairly certain they wouldn’t, say, leave a burning candle in the sofa, so-
He sits up, abruptly. Quickly yanks the tails of John’s shirt out of his trousers. Slips his hands in underneath, and is stunned by the sensory input: warm skin and coarse hair on John’s stomach. Runs them up over his nipples; small, erect. John gasps.
What the hell was happening to him? Was he about to hyperventilate? He started in a quick march, the stretch of the strides felt good. But it wasn’t enough. He broke into a jog, grateful for the lack of people out in the cold. The great gulps of frigid air were put to use as his leg muscles pumped. He ran and ran until, finally, he felt like walking.
“Arthur Stuart,” he blurted, his voice loud in the silence. His quicksilver orbs did not alight again upon Curt. Instead, he divested himself of his coat and scarf with appropriate speed, none too hasty as to be sloppy and none too slowly as to be forced. Natural. Right.
Sherlock had been intermittently absent lately, though John did not take it personally. Sherlock needed space sometimes. They both did.
He nodded in a vague sort of way, and replied, “I guess it is…” -- but the possible implications were so enormous that John felt anger and fear germinate at once in his stomach.
And there she was at the back of the store, arranging a row of expensive looking floral arrangements on the service counter. She was dressed flatteringly in black and yellow. She complimented the sparse decorations that adorned the main display area. It looked like someone had rented out the place. He saw now, in the window, a sign that said the shop could indeed be reserved for special occasions.
Gone, everything and everyone, except the dreams and the fragile grip I held on myself, my composure, my reality. I had caught myself glancing at my gun these past weeks, and still more frequently these past few days. Yesterday afternoon, I did not remember picking it up, just that I came to myself sitting there on the bed with it, staring at it. Staring at the gun like I stared at myself, and the swallowing emptiness nearly gave me vertigo.
“No!” John shouted, and then whispered in a shaking timbre, “You say it. You tell me. Tell me the truth. Is Sherlock alive?”
“Curt left,” Sherlock stated from his chair, looking up from his phone, taking in John’s appearance with a few flicks of his eyes.
“No,” Sherlock corrected instantly, his voice low and honest, “I just always…” – a single, heavy breath held tightly in his chest, but only for a moment before it rushed out in something like surrender. He tilted his chin up very slightly, having come to a bold decision of words, “I dance as if you are watching.”
“You don’t mean rehab.” Sherlock put his own hands in the pockets of his crisply starched, black trousers. He wore his suit like armor, “You’ve met someone.”
The man grunted in approval, and then leaned in as close as he could while dramatically looking about for eavesdroppers, “Vietnam.” And he winked.
She proceeded to kill every person Brian had ever cared about. Jack Fairy, because of Brian’s idolization of the rock icon. Brian’s ex-wife for obvious reasons. And Curt Wild because Brian still bought the man’s records, and still cried out for him in the night.
Gazing into the pale eyes of his friend, John suddenly felt dizzy, and exposed. He tried to take a deep, calming breath before attempting to speak, searching Sherlock’s face for understanding, “What are you talking about? It’s not simple. It never has been. Why can’t I just… not do this again?”
Sherlock continued after it became clear that John had nothing more to add, “It’s not a ruse. He is sober. He’s clean. So am I.”
John had experimented, certainly, in his life. Once while a teenager, once in college and a few quick rendezvous on deployment. He most definitely preferred women, but when it came to his friend? Well, Sherlock Holmes was exceptional in many ways.
Sherlock fought the urge to ogle John’s mouth, preoccupied as his mind was with the Need, “What do you mean, no case?”
Sherlock was silent, searching John’s eyes. He must have found what he was looking for, because some of that Lost Boy Look drained away, leaving Sherlock looking more like himself.
“Fuck your pity,” John growled, looking straight at Sherlock with fire in his eyes. He pulled his hand away.
Even now, almost six hours after his confrontation with Mycroft, John was in shock. Numb, and still falling.
John’s perception of time snapped into hyper-focus, and the following seconds seemed to run like molasses.
“John,” I heard him say my name, oddly unsure. I picked up the cups from the counter and turned to look at him. He locked eyes with me and I licked my lips nervously. It was hard not to stare at his exposed self. I set the tea on the table before me. I forced myself to act natural. Sort of failing at it, too.
The neon blue lights of the police cars were made to kaleidoscope through the splattering of rain on the cab windows. At the sight of them, John’s stomach turned into lead. The police were parked at the entrance to the hotel. Crime scene tape flapped in the wind.
John stepped up beside Sherlock, speaking in low tones to Hoija, “Look, I know you were close to Curt, but the woman deserved a trial.”
”Have you not heard a single word of what I’ve been telling you, John? She won’t, because she knows I am the leader and I've conditioned her to my commands. Watch!”
John took a moment to carefully scan the people around them. To his surprise, he did actually discover that a few people, indeed, seemed to have not only noticed but also found it significant enough to lean over their tables, whisper a bit, linger a bit too long with their glances. How utterly ridiculous, John thought.
”A date,” Sherlock said. Then he smiled, a smile so genuine and trusting that John had to lean forward to kiss him again. A gentle kiss, then one more, and then he couldn’t resist sneaking in just a tiny little bit of tongue in between Sherlock’s soft, soft lips. He felt Sherlock’s body immediately respond and move closer, causing John to feel another spark of arousal firing somewhere deep inside his chest.
Culverton’s words had stung because they had been justified. How the hell could he not have seen what should have been so glaringly obvious - Sherlock’s crazy smackhead eyes, the absurdity of his accusations toward Culverton. The man-sized holes in his chain of reasoning.
”You know Sherlock.. I wish you had felt that you could tell me about, er, about Gabriel…and all.” He was struggling to find the words. ”You know I think it’s all… fine. It wouldn’t have changed a thing.”
John leans his head against the doorframe, stifles a frustrated sigh. Tries really hard to control his temper, but Lord knows it’s not easy. Worst part is, he knows perfectly well that Rosie’s gotten this from him.
The flat is covered in a soft, muffled silence, their breathing the only sound to be heard. Just the two of them, together in this place where the edges between past and the present seem to blur.
John wondered if Sherlock had realized during their talk yesterday just how badly John had fared during his time away. Most likely not, he thought.
John keeps twisting and turning him around to see better, to be able to evaluate, but the light is too poor. Takes up his phone and turns the flashlight on. A quick check of the wound, and then he aims the light into Sherlock’s eyes to check his pupillary response (
The emptiness in the spot where John’s chair had been. Sherlock had pushed and dragged it up to John’s old room, covered it with a white sheet; out of sight, out of mind (but not bloody likely, couldn’t delete it but couldn’t get rid of it, either, so, there it was).
The radiologist had called John last Thursday about the results, and now John had to be the one to tell the young man that the pain in his stomach indeed was something to worry about.
“I had to contact his brother. I know Sherlock will be so angry with me but it was the only thing I could think of! I would have phoned that nice young man of his, but I don't have his number.”
John felt himself relaxing. The slightly awkward feeling he’d been having, was beginning to fade. There was really nothing much to be concerned about, he decided. They could still be, well, be what they always used to be, before. No need to put on an act.
“John...” Sherlock decided it was probably safe to move his hips a little. He did. It felt amazing, but he still needed more. More, right now.
”And I.. um. Things happened so fast last night, and I- I thought- I really don’t want to part without being upfront with you about-”
Mycroft was staring him down. John tried his best not to avert his eyes. He felt he was being thoroughly manipulated, and even though he didn't agree with Mycroft, it was getting harder by the second to find valid arguments to counter with. He had expected Mycroft to be perhaps a bit angry, but was completely unprepared for this.
It was amazing, simply amazing, the way Sherlock moved his hands, and John let his head fall back into the pillow for a moment, just enjoying the sensation.
Mark then turned to the others, who were all trying very hard not to gawk at the celebrity standing before them.
John smiled again, and then moved to grab Sherlock in a strong grip. He coaxed him downwards until he was sitting up at the edge of the bed, and then, with his hands, John made him turn around. It resulted in Sherlock standing on all fours on the bed with his arse turned to John, who was now standing up next to it. Sherlock felt the bed sway as John put one heavy knee on the bed, next to his thigh.
Had downplayed the injury, tried to make John believe that she never meant to kill him. Had done everything he could possibly think of, to give John back the wife he so desperately wanted to have.
Whenever John allows himself to think about it, something akin to a vortex is picking up speed in his stomach. All those years. All the unrest, the frustration, the longing for something he could not quite put his finger on. Now he knows. This was the missing piece. And now that he has finally found it, there’s just no way he can let it go.
When he'd finished talking, he noticed the change in Sherlock. He was sitting absolutely still in his chair; breathing heavier, his eyes were oddly glazed over in a way that John had never seen before. Only then did John truly realize the effect his words had had on Sherlock. The understanding was both a bit unsettling and quite the power kick. It was also, he discovered, a massive turn on.
They were both kissing with urgency now, open mouths, tongues touching and exploring. Sherlock felt his mind strangely emptied, his only thoughts were a hazy, repeating
He’s not really up for talking, and somehow, the harsh daylight makes it even harder. Still glad that he and Harry have been able to get to this point. To actually care enough about each other to bother. After a near lifetime of not getting on, Rosie really came in as a turning point in their relationship. Somehow, she made it possible for them to find a way back into each others’ lives again.
John finally manages to get his thoughts in order enough to stop this litany. He turns back from the sink, proceeds to kneel in front of Sherlock to be level with his face.
At 6 in the evening, as John was doing his best to look busy with some of last week's paperwork, Mary came upstairs. Leaned against her shoulder was the half asleep baby.
“A kiss would be nice,” Sherlock said, smiling. John must have zoomed out a bit too long in his thoughts. He let his hand caress the nape of Sherlock's neck, while he reached up to kiss him, and was met with passion and tenderness.
Feeling dizzy, John reached out his left hand to grab ahold of the fabric at the waistline of the trousers. At the same time, he shifted his right hand to get the zipper pull. Slowly, he pushed it down, his hand grazing over Sherlock’s erection as he moved, causing Sherlock to inhale and shift his hips ever so slightly closer to John.
“Won't take long,” he panted, and John thought that seeing Sherlock undone like this was hotter than anything he'd been able to imagine.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and then looks away. ”Oh please, for Christ’s sake, how many times do I have to say that I don’t want to-”
Then there’s an awkward moment where John’s unsure about how to greet Sherlock, but it’s sorted when Sherlock reaches out his hand. ”John,” he says, and John wonders if maybe, just maybe, Sherlock is a little nervous as well.
John was holding the happy gaze of Sherlock now, they were looking into each other’s eyes, neither of them averting their gaze. It felt like sunlight radiating through his veins.
”That’s amazing,” Sherlock said, a dreamy expression in his eyes. John could tell he was already far away in his mind, making plans.
He doesn’t, of course. Instead, tries to go as much unnoticed as he can. Hides in corners, hides in the kitchen. When he couldn’t locate John, he hid for thirty minutes up in his old room. He sat on his bed, looking at John’s bag, feeling equal parts excited and embarrassed over the fact that his family are assuming things that are not true. Also embarrassed about the fact that he wishes they were. Pathetic. Should be able to settle for at least having John back as his friend.
“Surely this subject doesn't embarrass you, John?” Sherlock seemed to be absolutely sincere in his question. “It's perfectly normal, you know.”
No matter how he tried, everything seemed to come out wrong. It pained him so much to see Gabriel’s face, usually so confident and smiling, now all troubled.
John was standing in the hallway, listening to Mary giving the nanny more of the seemingly endless instructions of How to Take Care of a Baby for a Couple of Hours.
Sherlock was still breathing heavily, rocking his hips slowly into John's fist that he was still providing.
Startles again when his phone rings, he’s still holding it in his hand. Feels the same stupid hope ignite, before his stomach sinks once more.
It was winter in London, and an arctic chill held the city in an iron grip since a few days back. The snow on the streets was piling up, making the traffic slow and chaotic despite the frantic plowing and salting.
“I'm sorry,” he said. “Sherlock, I'm so sorry. This was really poor judgment on my part, I, er- I promise you it won't happen aga-”
”I want to hear all about it, later,” he said, and John didn’t reply. Instead, he just looked down again, marveled at what he was allowed to do with his hand, and at the reactions it elicited from Sherlock.
”Oh, you know, can’t complain. Sarah’s parents are in town and they wanted to spend some time with the kids, so we took the chance to break free for a night. And what about you, is Mary here somewhere? I’m so sorry we missed your wedding!”
He nearly loses his balance when he’s taking his trousers off, manages to grab the desk for support. Good. Throws on a thin white cotton T-shirt and a new pair of pants. Pushes the old stuff underneath the bed, flicks on a small table lamp in a corner of the room. Stands by the door, waiting.
”I want to feel more of you,” John whispered to his mouth. “Can I get you out of these?” He tugged at Sherlock's trousers.
Thinks that it’s one thing to suspect something, no matter how strongly, and a very different thing to have it so bluntly confirmed. And after all those years of John’s insistence of not being gay, he’d eventually accepted that his initial appraisal was, for once, wrong.
“Not so much deduced as observed,” he said, raising his eyebrows slightly. John felt a nervous flutter in his stomach, despite having been the one who had pushed this.
If there are things that might be triggering for you, now is a good time to check the warnings at the beginning. xx
”We’re leaving London.” They were standing by the crowded counter at Speedy’s, a quick coffee before John’s shift began. It had been six months, and everything that had happened seemed more distant, more unreal, for every day that went by. Sherlock had started to take on cases again. Slowly, things were returning to normal.
John laughed softly. ”Why do you think, Mister Genius? Because I love you very much and wanted to give you something. And this thing just happened to come up. Good timing, that was all.”
things like this. And now, without intending to, John has somehow imposed himself upon him in his sleep, and
”Sherlock-” John paused. ”Let’s not go there again, please. Let’s try to talk about this constructively.”
Finding a dog was not at all like finding a person. Far too many random variables, not much to go on. If one wanted to find a missing dog, the utilization of another dog was the best way to go about it. But now, he would have to make do with himself.
It was burnt into John's memory, all the details of Sherlock’s beautiful body, and it felt surreal to get to see it again. The taut muscles. The smooth, pale skin. The small, light red nipples, hardened from the cold, and maybe from something else now. He felt a jolt shooting through his groin at the sight.
”Because I can tell you’re an idiot. No offense, most therapists are. I know everything you’re going to say. I’ve been through it before.”
Sherlock decided it was time to step in. Until now, he'd kept a very low profile, but now he took a few quick steps towards the angry woman. He made sure to school his expression into one of concerned authority.
He'd actually gotten himself off just a couple of hours earlier – in the shower, leaned against the tiles, just like Sherlock in some freaky way had managed to deduce – and for that he was grateful, now. Would make him last substantially longer.
As they stroll back to the car, the midnight sky above them clear and starry, he notices how John is still regarding him with that strange, wondering expression that Sherlock really can’t make sense of.
Sherlock started to move his hips again, causing John to move, too. He was using both his hands to keep Sherlock's legs up, and bracing on them, he leaned over to plant a couple of sloppy kisses on that pretty mouth. He began to rock into Sherlock, and for every new motion, he felt his dick slide further in until it was all the way to the hilt.
“You need sex on a regular basis. If you're not dating, then how will you get it? Your high moral standards, combined with your rather strong need for validation through sexual relations, seem counter intuitive to hiring prostitutes.”
It must have been largely fueled by the alcohol in his bloodstream, because when he thought about it later, in a sober condition, John just couldn't fathom he'd had the guts – the insanity? - to do what he'd actually done.
This feels good, John thought. Really, really good. They were standing so close, now, and it took John all his willpower to not get in even closer. He realized he had to find out. Had to know what was on the table, here, before he could know how to proceed.
”I used to read your blog, you know.” He smiled, a weak smile. ”Then suddenly you were getting married! I’ll admit that was quite a shocker.”
When they’re on their way, the rest of them exhales a collective breath of relief, then moves into the sitting room to plunk down for a while. Sherlock’s browsing the bookshelves, trying to find something to read and is just about to take a book out to hand over to John (crime novel, poor plot, just the sort of thing he’s always reading) when John gets up.
”They already think we’re fucking.” It seems this has some sort of effect on John, who inhales sharply.
”Hi there, I’m Mark,” said the husband, enthusiastically shaking John’s hand. He was short and a bit corpulent, with a dark stubble and round glasses. He was wearing a shirt in some kind of orange colored pattern that John thought was borderline insane, but the guy had friendly eyes and seemed to laugh a lot, a rumbling belly laugh that was quite contagious.
John was rocking into Sherlock’s hand and against his body. He had one hand on Sherlock’s hipbone and perhaps, if it had been possible, it would have left a burn mark there because that was how hot it felt against his skin.
”I want you to be happy," Sherlock had said. ”Maybe if you tell me how often you need to hear it, and on which occasions, I could say it on that schedule?” he had offered. But that was apparently also wrong, evident by the fact that Gabriel had actually started to cry, which was both rare and unsettling.
Eventually, he was standing in front of one of the towering, glass clad high-rises in The City. He lowered his shoulders, straightened his back, and went inside.
And despite all better judgement, Sherlock gets up from the floor, then carefully gets in the bed. He places himself on the very far edge, facing out the room, away from John.
”Mary”, John interrupted, trying to sound as pleasant as possible. ”I think it will be alright. Anna feels safe with Mrs. Lerner by now, and Mrs. Lerner knows all there possibly is to know about what to do with babies. Isn’t that right, Mrs. Lerner?”
Sherlock sighed very quietly, and then glided down a bit in his seat, trying to make John's hand make contact. When it didn't work – John knew better than to appease his partner's needs right away – Sherlock squirmed and moved about frustratedly.
“You mean now that you know that I know you in the biblical sense?” sniggered Sherlock, his pronunciation more than a bit slurred. It caused John to giggle for a while.
“Alright, game on then,” he heard Sherlock say, and then, Sherlock's rumbling voice calling back to the man.
It was easy to talk about Anna for a while. He was so proud of her, and Sherlock was smiling when John told him about the adventures of getting her to try real food for the first time, or how she’d laugh when he’d sing to her. How she loved furry animals and music and soap bubbles.
Sherlock hated therapists. Hated them. Despised them. He had seen so many different ones, all throughout his childhood, and then his teens, and then in his twenties. Idiots, all of them. But now, he remembered his new approach.
”Actually John, you would probably have found it highly entertaining,” Mycroft suddenly pipes up. ”I certainly did. That long white dress really suited you, Sherlock, especially together with that funny collar that went all the way up to your ears. Like a little doll.”
”You’ve just been through a hell of an ordeal.” John reaches down, hooks his arm in under Sherlock’s, pulls him back up on his feet. ”No wonder you’re shaking. We need to get someone to check on you, too.”
But without exception, he’d eventually begin to entertain John with gems of scandalous information that he had deduced about people they knew.
“Ever since you died - I mean, disappeared - there hasn’t been a single day I haven’t missed you. Sherlock, when your plane took off today, I almost couldn’t-"
”Earlier today, he was going on and on about how he insisted you get the spare room. And I told him that I would not hear any of it, because really, John. Can I be frank with you?”
The contractions of John’s abs, the hot rush of liquid, spurting over his chest, over John’s chest, and then he felt it - he had gotten some on his face too. John’s semen was on his hand, his chest, his throat and on his chin, and if he’d reached out his tongue, he could have tasted it. And that was the knowledge that sent Sherlock over the edge.
This was all John had been thinking about during his taxi ride back home, and he had fallen asleep, exhausted, next to Mary, filled with fantasies of what it would be like to take it further next time-
A gray and ordinary Tuesday, the phone call from Mrs Hudson. The second floor flat in her town house had become available; he’d taken one quick look and felt intensely that this was where he was supposed to be. Mrs Hudson had already squeezed the rent down to almost embarrassingly low numbers, he’d accepted it gratefully and concealed the fact that he still couldn’t quite afford it.
From the window in his office, John had already seen a very near crash when a taxi had failed to slow down in time for the red light. Although in London, the cabbies were usually excellent drivers, many of them were still inexperienced with how to handle the car in heavy snow.
“You're amazing,” he breathed. “So beautiful. Now, be my good boy and suck that dick, will you, love,” he said, and the reaction it drew from Sherlock was frankly amazing to watch.
It was, however, nearly impossible to focus on anything else but the tall, lanky man kneeling next to him. John stole a quick glance. Snowflakes were sprinkled all over his hair and his shoulders. In the headlights of the car, he was lit from behind. It was like he was shining, and John thought he looked almost outer-worldly. Perhaps he was.
It was surreal to see John move about in the kitchen; instinctively finding everything in the drawers and cupboards, getting the dicky old gas burner to start at first try, cleaning up the mess with a surgeon’s efficiency as he went along.
. They fall into a soft, gentle rhythm, moving against each other in synchrony. His hand is trailing down the slope of a strong back, then further down… the soft feel of flannel and, oh Christ.
Ridiculous, he'd tried to tell himself. Sherlock and he had been friends, sure, very close friends and John was certain they’d always remain that way. Maybe they wouldn’t see each other as often, but that was certainly normal too, right? Life changes. Simple as that.
But then there was that little sliver of doubt. He couldn’t let it go. No, no matter how hard he tried, John couldn’t make this sacrifice without being absolutely certain.
John heard the question, nodded. ”Right. No one was harmed, not a single scratch.” Sherlock grabbed the pen next to the book, scribbled something down.
didn’t really like socializing with us idiots, now did you!” He laughed out loud. ”Either that or you were just playing real hard to get!”
”You alright?” John asks. Something is clearly wrong, but he’s unsure if it’s still because of the dog, or.. or something with this photograph?
“Wait! You've gone through my underwear drawer! Sherlock, that's actually quite the invasion of my personal space. You have no right-”
John secretly despised them for it. Well, sometimes he’d say it to them, too. He felt that it was a doctor’s duty to use their knowledge and skills when they were needed, and if that could save a life, well that would most certainly take precedent over the need to finish your coffee.
Every single day since their chance meeting, Sherlock had pondered calling John. He wanted to see him, wanted it so desperately.
When Sherlock was in prep school, he’d used to bite himself, sometimes, when the unrest inside threatened to eat him alive. Now, he just lies there.
John couldn’t help but smile, his heart filling to the brim with love and affection. So much for high-functioning sociopath, he thought.
When he felt Sherlock beginning to get used to the touch, John hurried to bring his hand up to his mouth, spat in it without bothering to feel gross about it, and then, quickly, he put the tip of his middle finger against Sherlock's hole, and pushed it in. He felt the muscle cramp around his fingertip, and noticed Sherlock trying hard to relax. He was breathing so fast into John's neck, and John got worried that it was too much, too soon.
And in awe and amazement, John watches as Sherlock starts to come; semen shooting out between them, scattering across Sherlock’s almost hair free chest and belly.
He studied the bruise on Gabe’s cheek. It was quite remarkable, actually; yellow and blue and covering a large portion of his cheek and all the way up to his eye. In a twisted kind of way, John felt a little bit proud over having thrown such a perfect punch.
This entire evening, his thoughts had returned to Sherlock, again and again. To see him again, to so completely unexpectedly get to spend so much time together… In a way, it had felt like no time had passed; like they had just been able to pick up exactly where they’d left off, right before Sherlock had jumped and everything had gone to hell.
It had happened a few times already, this kind of fight. In fact, it had happened far more often than Sherlock would have wished, given that they’d only been together for such a short amount of time.
”Too bad about that Oscar," Mark said to the man. ”It should have been yours. But you’ll get plenty of more chances, I know it!”
And then there were some shuffling about, a cupboard opening and closing, and he could hear someone adjusting something with his IV-bag. Then the steps disappeared and the door closed.
”I got Billy to paint everything and lay the carpet, last week,” he smiled. ”But the rest, I did myself. It was a relief, actually, to finally get rid of all those papers.”
”Nothing. That’s what I want you to do. Just leave Sherlock alone. If you care about him at all, John, that is what you have to do. Give him a chance to get back on his feet. A shot at repairing the damage you caused to the first functional relationship he’s ever had. Not that I think it will work,” he added mumblingly.
He had sent a text to Mycroft, and gotten a prompt reply. It had said that everything was just fine and that he needn’t worry.
It’s Irene’s turn to sigh, heavily into the phone. ”Oh darling. Here I was, getting my hopes up that you’d finally gotten your shit together and moved on. Are you going to wait your whole life for that little man? Is there really no-one else you could shift your attention to?”
The house is wrapped in silence when they get back. It’s close to one o’clock and thankfully, both Mummy and Mycroft quickly scurries off to their respective bedrooms. But that leaves just him and John, standing in the kitchen and Sherlock can’t think of a single thing to say that won’t sound like some sort of innuendo.
John cuts in. ”No, no,” he says, emphatically shaking his head. ”You are- I think you’re perfect. You’re.. very attractive, Rebecca, it’s just- I don’t know. I think I might just be tired, you know, the interview and all. I think you’re great, I really do.”
Still standing in front of the table in the restaurant, the blonde man moved his arm from Sherlock’s shoulders, and instead tucked it around his waist, giving Sherlock a little tug and an encouraging smile. He turned back to John.
But the numbness held him in an iron grip, and everything happened so fast, too fast, and then John was standing in front of him, Captain Watson with the straight back and forced composure. And Sherlock was overcome with a very odd sense of detachment. It was like he was separated from his body, observing himself, and maybe it was the drugs beginning to kick in sooner than he’d calculated.
In the midst of their happy laughter, John saw Greg approach. He stopped in front of them, seemed to take in the sight.
”Your.. ’friend’?” he smiled with lips pressed hard together, finally managing to catch Sherlock’s eyes for a millisecond. He looked terrified.
”For fuck’s sake, John!” Sherlock was talking through his teeth now, fighting an urge to get up, move about, maybe break something.
”Don’t feel you have to bother. It’s all just.. meaningless traditions, made up by ignorant people who needed something to cling to,” he says, because, a) he wants John to not feel out of place, and b) it’s what he really thinks.
Sherlock seemed to have relaxed a bit, listening to his boyfriend tell the story about how they met. When his phone chimed he immediately picked it up, and John thought he saw a slight smile cross his face.
” Sherlock whispers, his breath coming in hard puffs from his nose now. ”Oh, fuck. Is this happening?”
”I’m sorry." She's speaking in a soft tone that he's not at all used to, from her. It's making him cringe. Thankfully, she then changes the subject.
John locks his eyes on Sherlock, decisively. Makes sure to wipe away the grin, schools his face into a stern expression. He sees Sherlock’s smirk disappearing, his eyes widening.
It was only later, much later, when they were both grown up, that he’d been able to think that maybe she’d been angry with him, too. Angry for not being honest, and for leaving her alone to shoulder the full time position as the black sheep at home.
Better than Sherlock could ever have imagined, and taken into account that he has been imagining this almost every day over the last five years, well.
He stares at the screen for a moment, tries to think back. Can’t remember seeing anything from her, lately. Although, given the massive amount of texts he’s received from Rosie the last week… maybe it got lost somewhere between those?
Sits there in the cold as the hours pass. Thinks about Afghanistan, and about night shifts in the A&E at Bart’s, when he was fresh out of Med School and terrified of the sudden responsibility placed upon his shoulders. Thinks about the stakeouts with Sherlock, the ones they laughed about together just a few nights ago.
”So,” he tried to keep his tone positive and light, ”I’ve told you about Mary. May I ask why you and-” he actually had a very real problem in even saying the name, ”Gabriel split up?”
”I love you so much,” John whispered to his lips, and Sherlock practically melted inside. It was still hard to fully grasp that all this was real.
“Or is it that you don't want to?” Sherlock asked, and John noticed a hint of worry – or was it embarrassment? - in his eyes.
He put a muscular thigh heavy on top of Sherlock's, his right hand stroked in sweeping movements across his chest, carefully avoiding to touch the large scar from the gunshot wound.
. His left arm is tightly wrapped around the pliant body next to him, he scoots tighter, feels a warm hand touch his arm. The heat, the softness of two sleepy bodies moving against each other;
“Because you see,” John half whispered, “I really don't like to do things that only I benefit from,” and Sherlock suddenly understood why this entire business had been dragged out for so long. Beautiful John, thinking that this would somehow be a sacrifice on Sherlock's part-
”Right you are, you’ve always had a good head on your shoulders," said Mark. ”And I understand congratulations are in order, marriage and a baby, that’s fantastic!”
After catching his breath, John uses his discarded t-shirt to wipe them sufficiently dry, and Sherlock snuggles up tightly against him. This is how they have been sleeping, ever since that day a couple of weeks ago when they had been sitting in a town car together, and Sherlock had been so brave, and John had grabbed his hand, and everything had changed.
And Sherlock laughs, a soundless breathy laugh, and John chooses that exact moment to give another thrust, causing Sherlock’s laugh to turn into a gasp. John repeats the motion, again, and then again, and sees Sherlock’s apprehension slip away, being replaced by a different kind of tension.
He hadn’t had any emotional outburst, hadn’t cried, no, nothing like that. It was just that pervasive, empty feeling.
Inside, however, it was already absolutely buzzing. John had to squeeze his way up to the hostess, he took the lead and let Mary follow in his wake.
With his current job, the money was insanely good. Unfortunately, it was also insanely stressful to not be able to go on cases with Sherlock the way he wanted to. Particularly when Sherlock would come back home with some sort of injury.
John made his way out of the flat and locked the door behind him. He stepped out into the bright sunshine, walked away without looking back.
But he did not have to be lonely. And although he would never admit it, company at regular intervals seemed to do him good. Extended periods of isolation, not so much. He was beginning to discover those things, now.
-” Sherlock moans loudly, bucks his hips up in a sudden movement and John feels privately a bit smug to have been able to find the spot on first try. Presses in a bit harder now and Sherlock is starting to sway more urgently against his hand.
It’s four days before Christmas, half past six in the evening, and Sherlock is caught in a nightmare of last minute shoppers right outside of Harrods. Had completely forgotten about that whole Christmas situation, not relevant, but now that oversight has come back to bite him as he tries to make his way out of the compact crowd.
Once in a while, he'd still have a nightmare about it, but as long as he could wake up next to Sherlock, curl up against his warm body, it was alright. A few times, he had woken up in a cold sweat with a beating heart on a night when he'd been alone back at his place – that had been harder. On those occasions, he'd had to get up, check on Anna, pour himself a drink to be able to eventually go back to sleep.
Sherlock looking up, giving him permission. For what? Anything, John knew. For John to hurt him. For John to beat him to death. Even though his haze, Sherlock had seen what John was feeling, and he had endorsed it. Accepted all of John’s unspoken accusations. The thought made John’s stomach turn.
”As a matter of fact, you were. You didn’t know a thing. One could have thought you had never attended a single lecture,” said Sherlock, looking superior.
Sherlock could feel John’s body heat radiating into his own body, through the fabric of his shirt, on his back, on his arms. He felt John’s heartbeat. He wondered if he was going to faint, then remembered people rarely fainted from panic.
Sherlock's eyes were darting all over John's body, completely unabashedly, causing John to smile a little. There was not a trace of the keeping up appearances that John had often found with other partners, no, nothing like that at all. Sherlock just seemed to be doing exactly what he wanted to do, nothing more, nothing less. John found it liberating and very endearing to see.
Sherlock had forced himself to try to distance himself from his emotions enough to evaluate that possibility. He had decided that the risk of her hurting John was exceedingly low. John was all she wanted.
”Look at you,” Sherlock heard him whisper. ”Such a good boy, opening up for me,” and Sherlock shivered. ”It’s going to feel so good to push into that pretty pucker.”
When their test results had gotten back clean, it had helped them both to relax more in bed. Since Sherlock also had a bit of a thing for cum play, it was nice to be able to do away with the condoms for blow jobs.
”Why, I’m so glad you asked. It is the fact that I have full control over my pharyngeal reflex. That’s what.” Sherlock had his eyes locked on John, and John felt like he might faint for real this time. Or die from arousal.
As he steps over that worn oak threshold and onto the large sandstone paving stones in the pavilion, a veritable onslaught of memories come crashing over him. He hasn’t been here for almost ten years, but the scents that flood him now - of the cold, damp stone building, of the burning wax candles, of the antique wooden benches and the pine soap used to clean them - it very nearly makes his knees weak.
He checked the bathroom, then jogged up to the second bedroom. His room. It didn't look like anyone had been there for a long time, he noticed a thick layer of dust on the drawer.
John could not make out much of the man busy servicing Sherlock, but he appeared to be of Sherlock’s age or a bit younger. Average height probably, fairly muscular body, hair golden and slightly wavy, dressed in a light blue, immaculately pressed shirt with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows. The elbows that were currently pressed flat on Sherlock’s thighs.
”No, of course not. No, it wasn’t that. I think your dick is absolute perfection, and you know very well that I enjoyed it when we tried it before,” he panted. ”It was just that - you know - as I was lying there, the thought occurred to me, that-”
He’d felt so happy, tonight. Can’t even remember the last time he was laughing that much. Standing by Sherlock’s side again is - it’s like it is where he’s meant to be. Being next to Sherlock is like coming back to life, he thinks, then fleetingly wonders if he’s being melodramatic. Mary would often say that he was.
He couldn’t show Mycroft he was awake, because he knew that would humiliate Mycroft more than anything. He’d never get over it.
”I don’t know what to say, Mycroft,” John sighed. ”You, or Sherlock, or anyone else for that matter, could have told me! I tried to survive, that was what I did. How the hell could I have known he wasn’t dead!”
And suddenly, the weight of this moment comes crashing down upon John. His throat is restricted, he feels the blood pounding in his ears. So many years, so many chances, forever lost.
His wrists were released, abruptly. Holding himself up on one underarm against the bed, John moved his other hand over Sherlock's flank, down, and then grabbed Sherlock's arse firmly. On his next downward movement, John pushed a bit harder, and there it was – John's cock, now actually partially nestled in between Sherlock's buttocks.
He raised his head again, stared at the sight, wondered for the hundredth time if this really could be happening. Then, another thought came up.
“Everybody, John. They've all assumed – and to be honest, I was hoping they would eventually be correct. Hoping you'd come around.”
John didn’t even reflect on the fact that he hadn’t felt any urge to correct Luigi in his assumption that Sherlock was his boyfriend.
“Well, well, well – look at you... And I thought you just said it was absolutely normal. You're blushing like a school girl!”
John put the Clancy book down in his lap – by now he was pretty sure how it ended - and took a sip of his coffee. Once again, he felt a faint flutter of nervousness in his stomach when he thought about what he was planning to give Sherlock tonight.
He hopes that will do the trick. He hears John hesitating, but then finally, thankfully crawling into the bed. ”Alright,” he says. ”Goodnight, Sherlock.”
John waits a minute, lets him finish, then walks up to him again. Sherlock has slumped down, is now sitting right on the ground, arms wrapped around his knees.
cause that man’s death. And I’m so sorry you’ve had to carry that on your shoulders, for all this time.”
As John tried to move his other hand from where it was awkwardly positioned underneath him, he felt Sherlock shifting, too, and suddenly, there was a large hand gripping firmly around his own erection. His body responded on it’s own accord at this sensation, his hips bucked in against Sherlock and into his hand.
A lump is forming in his throat, and in his stomach, a terrifying, big swirl of emotions is growing stronger. He swallows.
His eyes were distant, and John intensely hoped it wasn't just because of the alcohol. He was far from sober himself, but yet felt convinced, deep down within himself, that he would not ever regret this. Not as long as Sherlock wanted it, too, and it certainly seemed that way right now. It all just felt so bloody right; nothing more than a natural progression of the most intimate friendship he'd ever had.
It made for an entertaining five minutes, before the woman abruptly left with tears in her eyes. The man followed her, but not before spitting out a ’You belong in a mental institution!’ to Sherlock.
”That’s grand, John, absolutely brilliant,” Caroline says, her voice genuinely happy now and Sherlock doesn’t even want to know what she’s referring to. What’s
option and hesitated for a long moment. Did he really want his first post online to be this? Shrugging, John took a sip of whiskey for courage and clicked hard on the trackpad.
Greg and Seb exchanged an expression that said that both of them needed to find ways of discussing therapy options for the two other men in the room. Once Sherlock sat down on the couch, he took the other tablet with some water, followed by everyone tucking in to fluffy pancakes, bacon and eggs. By the time an hour had passed, Sherlock was focusing on his knitting once again, with Greg smirking at the jumper that was almost completed.
John watched Sherlock's eyes crinkle into a smile at that, and a little bit of him relaxed. So far, Sherlock hadn't said anything about his tattoos, and John hadn't been certain if that meant he wasn't a fan. Granted, over the last three days, there hadn't exactly been the right opportunity for him to bring up the topic.
John began to move his hips, grinding against the top of Sherlock’s thigh, until Sherlock shifted to allow their crotches to lie flush against each other. They both let out a lewd groan, and John quickened the pace, his hands finding a resting place on the curves of Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock glances up at the ceiling, chewing the side of his lip as if his thoughts are paining him. John desperately wants to reach out and take him into his arms, but he refrains, knowing that neither of them need that right now.
Sherlock lets out a deep sigh, stubbing out the cigarette on the outside wall and slamming the window shut.
The only sounds after that were the soft beeping of various medical machinery, and the occasional shuffling of the other patients in their beds. Sherlock watched John stay so remarkably still that he might as well have been a statue. Sherlock wanted to touch him but didn’t dare. He felt as if he was on the cusp of a rejection that would break whatever he and John still had.
"Never went to visit Dad in prison. Heard he died three years ago, something about a riot. He stopped being my dad when he killed my mother."
John’s hand was warm when he did what she hadn’t been able to do minutes before. Perhaps this type of touch was what Sherlock had felt then too. John’s strong fingers held the weaker parts of the other person in place until they were strong enough themselves.
"Who the fuck are you, and where is Sherlock? Answer the second question first, and I won't shoot you in the kneecap." John growled while pointing his gun at the back of the man's leg.
half-sentences into the middle of John's chest. Part of a love song. The middle of a Shakespearean sonnet that Sherlock thought that he had deleted decades ago. The pin code to his bank account. All of it now lived in the linings of golden chest hair, sparkling with the fresh essence of himself.
John feels bowled over by the question. He thinks for a moment, very conscious of Harry watching him as he runs through all the times he witnessed Sherlock filing data within his mind palace and in the outside world.
“You have a little bit of pie…” John began and then paused as he moved right over to Sherlock on the sofa. “On the corner of your mouth...right there.”
“He was going to delete the footage anyway,” John said around a dark laugh, then surged forward, closing the gap between their lips in a rush of hot air. The moan that tore from John’s mouth from the kiss alone would have shamed even the most weathered porn star. His hands, previously busy tearing the packet of lube open, now sought out Sherlock’s cock. He tried pulling Sherlock’s legs apart, but his trousers, still trapped around his lower thighs, constricted his movements.
Only he did not sit on the leather cushion. He sat very carefully astride Sherlock’s lap. Making sure he didn't put any weight on Sherlock's legs so as not to disturb the stitches. He leaned forward and pressed his nose against Sherlock's.
"Here," Sherlock said, handing over a small envelope to John from the bedroom drawer side table. "Not that you'll find yourself needing to show it to every person that we ever decide to snog near, but just in case there is ever a question of consent... it's a notarised letter signed by me declaring that despite my odd condition, that I grant you permission to kiss me confused whenever you choose. Only I can cancel the agreement by updating it myself."
The last word John says feels sweet on Sherlock’s tongue as he kisses those lips for the first time. The sensation of John’s surprising gasp turns into a deeper sound of what hope does when it turns into a reality. The warmth of sure hands as John grips him just like he did hours ago when he rescued Sherlock from a date with the front end of a car, yet this time, there is nothing fleeting about it. John stays there. Holding him so close that Sherlock can feel John’s heartbeat rumble against his own chest. The buttons of John’s shirt rubbing his aching skin until one of them decides to pull away some of the fabric. Cold skin touches skin, and they both release a breath into the air of 221 Baker Street that sounds like a collective sigh of what the night has become.
“Sherlock, I just mean as your friend. Surely there’s something I can do to make things easier, maybe talk things through with you—”
It only took Sherlock about 48 hours to get the basics of the spreadsheet down. He started off with a list of absolute dos and don'ts, based on obvious deductions and mutterings during pillow talk. Then, just like the best strategies, he built up from there. The categorising of what brought John to orgasm the quickest and slowest; the moans that elicited the longest streams of ejaculation; foods that John preferred best before and after sex and what times of day and night John was more in the mood.
I would apologize about the length of this chapter, but when it comes to these two and sex nothing is short and sweet. You'll all just have to suffer through 5k words of smut.
“Almost at the spot,” Sherlock calls over his shoulder. John nods that he heard him, but his eyes are too busy looking in as many directions as possible. He doesn’t have enough time to take it all in, but he desperately wants to.
“I’m too exhausted for you to be looking that sexy in my clothing,” Sherlock sighs before rolling back over to become one with the mattress again. “What time is it?” he continues, face now mashed into the pillow. Although it comes out more like a series of muffled snuffling noises. He’ll refuse to repeat himself if prompted.
“John,” Sherlock whispered before lifting himself up onto his elbows and softly biting at the side of John’s neck. “God...John.”
"Oh fuck…" John swore and was torn between tipping his head back or surging up to capture Sherlock's lips. But to lean forward and kiss the beautiful creature above would be to deny him his desire to look, to see just what his hand was doing to him.
“Yes, I um—I’ll be outside," Greg stuttered, his eyes darting around the room, trying to look anywhere but the six-foot of naked consulting detective, draped casually over the sofa. He stumbled back out of the flat, the door clicking shut behind him.
; he needed to explore his reactions more — analyse whether this was context-specific or whether any praise would elicit such a reaction. When he thought back, he’d had similar responses to John’s compliments in the earlier days of their friendship, but he’d waved it away as general attraction to the man himself. Perhaps he was wrong. But a crime scene was not the best place for that experiment.
The freezing water washes over him, and Sherlock uses the last of his strength trying to remain upright. Water fills his nose and mouth, stealing his breath, and somewhere above him, he’s sure he can hear deep echoing laughter. He ignores it, closing his eyes and focusing on one thought; John.
In the two years I have known him, I always despaired at the frequency with which he’d bring home female lovers, but this is nothing compared to his newfound love for queer sex. At least with the women, I could ignore them. The high-pitched giggles and desperate amount of perfume faded into the background. Now, you’d be excused for thinking his cock sang in bisexual and ejaculated rainbows. Night after night he brings home an assortment of men, leading them to his room with filthy promises.
“It means new life,” the boy continued. “If your friend was unhappy with his old life, he may have come here to start over?”
“It’s nothing,” Molly begins, another sniff escaping her nose. She gives Greta a gentle scratch behind her ears, and the cat presses her head harder into her palm. “The supermarket…I was buying wine and the cashier asked to see my ID and…she didn’t believe that…”
“Please...John, let's just talk about this later when the Pierce case is a bit further along. We’ll have a proper talk and figure out—“
“Don’t apologise for anything,” I reply. “If anything, I should be the one saying I’m sorry for chasing away Kristopher with a K.”
“I’m fine. Just bruised. They want to keep me overnight to make sure I didn’t damage anything, but I’m fine.” John shifted on the mattress, pulling up the sheets so they rested beneath his chin. “Tired, actually. Can you leave me to sleep?”
It takes a tremendous amount of self-control to not just walk out of the room and have Mycroft escorted off the premises. Somewhere in the more rational part of John’s mind, he knows that even if he does this, Mycroft will more than likely just swoop by the flat for an even longer talk. Best to just get all of this out now instead of later.
“Perhaps he’s growing up,” The DI says with a shrug. “Trying to be a better person. Maybe stop trying to find out what’s wrong when...perhaps there isn’t anything wrong at all?”
It was a Tuesday morning when Mary began her miscalculations. The previous night a flurry of taste and touches. Where the invitation to stay was for more than just the night. A step ahead instead of two steps back, and it was better.
John spreads his legs wider and places a hand on Sherlock’s cheek. His eyes are wide and clear, the drunken lethargy long gone. Sherlock is so desperate now to lean in, to close the gap between them in more ways than one, but this is serious. This isn’t some one night stand, an alcohol-fuelled pick-me-up to get them through the night; this is a promise. A promise of tomorrow, and of all the days to come. Although it would tear him apart, Sherlock knows he cannot continue without knowing that they are on the same page.
“Next bar then?” he says, his voice oddly high-pitched. “Right after I get some water to go. Meet you outside, yeah?”
"No, just home, please," John said over his shoulder as he guided Sherlock into the car. Sherlock was, of course, perfectly capable of getting himself into the car, but John wouldn't allow it. He even went as far as leaning in and buckling Sherlock into the car, completely ignoring the scowl on Sherlock's face. He'd just kiss that off later. (Then promptly make Sherlock forget why he'd been scowling in the first place.)
“Sure, that’s how police work goes, sometimes.” Molly paused, watching his face. Sherlock tried to keep it blank, determined not to betray anything. “There are days when I have to cancel too, if something urgent comes in.”
“Sherlock...” John groaned, his free hand scrubbing his face as Harold’s chuckles fill the room once more. “You’re on speakerphone.”

“Are we toasting to anything specific? Your desire to drive me nuts before entrees, or something different?”
So it appeared Sherlock had made a good move by leaving Lestrade. John was annoyingly stubborn when it came to conversations at times. Especially when it involved the complexity of emotions, mixed in with the simplicity of sex. There had been a few more awkward encounters since that first night, Sherlock trying, and failing, to keep John pleased whilst his own mind was occupied with the case. Eventually, John had pushed him away completely, and the only communication they’d had since were half-aborted arguments about John’s emotional state.
“It was in only one of the plans,” she went on. “That you were able to get close enough to see him like that… to touch him. Feel for a pulse.”
“But we’re not dating this time,” Sherlock quickly answers. “And even if we were, my brother feeds off the self-guilt and insecurities of others. He’s in the government for a reason, John. Whatever he said to you, don’t play into his mind games.”
"Then," John stopped moaning long enough to utter a single short laugh, "when that guard couldn't figure out what the bloody hell he was feeling, I wish you had gone through with your offer to complete the frisk."
Sherlock gives a passive shrug as he pulls away and begins to press soft kisses into John’s upper torso. He pauses to give extra special attention to each of John’s nipples and John grunts in approval. His hand reaches up and tangles into the dark hair as Sherlock continues his mouth down further.
With slow and deliberate motions John pulled the mobile out of his pocket and looked at the caller ID. Sherlock’s name flashed across the screen.
My hands are balled up into such tight fists that they hurt, and yet John is coming closer. His tentative steps are just what I need at the moment. I’m the only fully dressed person in the room, yet I feel so exposed.
