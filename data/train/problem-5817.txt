"It doesn't matter Ty. I'll do it for you." He checks his watch. "We better start getting ready. I love you." I start to make my way out of the room.
She starts jumping about like he does in the movie then when it comes to Rapunzel's part, Clint lifts me onto the sofa next to Nat. I begin singing and acting just like they did.
"I illegally downloaded the Glee cover of Somebody to love." We all share a look before bursting out laughing.
"Dad, Papa, this is my boyfriend, Wade. Wade, these are my dad's." They shook hands and said no more. I walked over to Pete and MJ as Dad was grilling Wade for every detail about himself.
"Certainly." He replies. "Up the stairs, take a left. Your initials should be painted on the doors."
"Why don't we just say that you're all not worthy and move on with our lives? I do believe it's way past the man of Spiders and the Maiden of Shadows bedtime." Ever since Thor found out our superhero identities, those are the names that have stuck.
"Wish I could say the same about you Spider-Boy." Once Tony had set Peter down on his feet, we make a decision to head down to the gym, get some training in so they can see what we've got. I change out of my attire and run to my room to grab some gym wear. I come out wearing cropped leggings, a sports bra and a short vans t shirt. I say that like it's all new. The vans t shirt was an old shirt that I cut in half. I stole the sports bra and I've gotten too tall for the leggings but it works. I go back to where we were to see the boys ready, awaiting my arrival. I say my hellos and then yet another bottle of water was thrown at my face, luckily, this time, I'd seen it coming. I catch it in my left hand and turn to face the goateed man.
"Hi, I'm Wade Wilson, pleasure to meet you." Nat just stares at his outstretched hand before grabbing my elbow gently but firmly.
"You haven't changed one bit Tyler. And if I'm completely honest, I don't know where Blake is, probably in her room."
"You've got nothing to be sorry for Buck. I can't begin to imagine what they did to you and no one is expecting you to just forget it. I understand that it's going to take time and you need to understand that you're not doing this along. You've got me, my dad, Papa, Pete, all of the avengers. But what were you dreaming about?" We were sat on the bed now, his flesh hand in mine. He squeezed my hand tightly.
"No more okay? Wade keep an eye on her." And with that, she leaves to find Clint. Mumbling something about babysitting all night. I turn back to my boyfriend, grabbing his hand once more and start to pull him towards the elevator. Once situated inside I pull out my phone and text Pete, telling him where we'd be.
"What's going on?" Steve asks as he bursts through the door. Ii let out a strangled yelp and cling onto Clint, holding fistfuls of his shirt, refusing to let go. His hand starts rubbing my back.
"Actually we do, we're interns at Stark tower. I'm as confused as you as to why our surnames were changed." Dad told us about the intern thing a few weeks back for instances like this. Flash didn't seem satisfied with the answer as he grabs Pete by the collar of his shirt, lifting him off the ground. I stand straight away pulling the bully off my brother.
"No, he's just an idiot." I shake my head at the weirdo I call my big brother. The other man spoke up.
"If you add the negatives and divide by the current, put it into a mobius strip and cancel out the delocalised electrons it would work." I tell his casually. He looks at me in shock.
"And you Pepper Potts, do you take Antony Edward Stark to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, to protect and love through sickness and in health till death do you part?"
"Tyler Stark-Jones." I correct her, pulling on my Black Widow converse, yes I still have those, judge away.
"Papa, we have no idea what any of this is." Pete says looking down, almost as if he's embarrassed. Tony facepalms.
"I'll be right back okay." I move to stand but a hand stops me. She shakes her head, curls flying everywhere. I smile in understanding.
"They fixed me. I was the broken toy sitting on the top shelf in the play room that the kids didn't want to play with. I was the defective typewriter that was only good for show. The girl that was never given a second chance. But they didn't see me like that. You heard what they said in court. I was the girl that was being chocked to death and didn't care. I was accepting my fate. Ever since they took us home, I've not felt like that. I'm not the second choice anymore; I'm the first. I'm not just some random kid with no family. I have parents, a brother, aunts and uncles galore. I have a family. I belong to someone. And you have no idea how long I've waited to be a part of something. Something bigger than a club or a fandom. I've dreamt of having a family since I was young. I always thought it would be my mom, a dad and I, maybe a few younger siblings but never in a million years did I imagine this. Yet I wouldn't trade them for the world." I didn't even realise we'd stopped moving. The car was parked outside of a two story house, with a white and blue front and a porch running the whole way around.
"Really Spider-Man?" She asks, head tilted to the side, amusement evident in her voice. Spider-Man glares playfully at the girl.
The five of us sat down at our usual table after grabbing lunch form the cafeteria. MJ, Pete and Ned all got pizza, Wade got fries and I just got a bottle of water. Wade holds a fry in front of my mouth.
"Guys, you're talking to Ironman and Captain America, do you really think we have any strong opinions on you guys saving people? Looking out for the little guy?" Both of us shrug, feeling pretty stupid. Tony comes over and wraps his arms around both of our shoulders.
"Tyler?" Tony's voice was harsher than Steve's. "Look at us young lady." I lift my head slowly expecting to see anger but surprisingly all I see is concern. Tears well up in my eyes.
"Nice to see you too Ty." He grunts as he places me back on my feet. I smile at him as his eyes shift to look behind me.
"You don't have to go Kid. You can stay home if you'd like. I can teach you here." I think about his offer before shaking my head.
"Will do." I pull my Stark tablet out of my bag and begin scrolling through some documents that need completing until the device was ripped out of my grasp.
"Tony told me." He says simply. I look down knowing what he meant. He takes my hand in his, toying with the edge of my sleeve. "Can I see?" He asks, blue eyes already shining with unshed tears. I nod slightly and he does exactly the same to what the brunette had done not 6 hours earlier. Steve hadn't actually seen the damage though. He'd just seen the bloodied bandages and a few slashes sticking from out of the bottom.
"Jarv, please tell my Dad's where me and Wade are and let them know that the door is open. No rules being broken."
"Numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 17 and 18." I say. Steve takes the list back and looks over it, Tony glancing over his shoulder nodding his head.
And that is how I find myself sat in a makeup chair, Wanda putting the coloured powder on my eye lids whilst Natasha flicks through my outfit choices.
"Let the kid get through the door first Hawk. Come on Ty. I'll show you to your room." Deciding it's best not to argue, I trail behind the older woman until she stops quite abruptly in front of a door.
"Come on Underoo's. She's okay. You're right down the hall if she needs you. We won't hurt her." I nod my head at him slightly, giving him the okay to leave and he does. Both men sit on the opposite side of the table to me, staring at me intently. It's kinda freaky, not gonna lie. I raise my eyebrows expectantly at them and they apologise.
Sun shines down on the city of Queens. The masked hero lays on the roof of an apartment complex, taking in the view around them, scouting for crimes that need someone like herself to step in. It's pretty peaceful for the city that never sleeps. The hero hears footsteps approaching but feels no threat. Somebody sits down beside her, their form instantly relaxing at the familiarity. They both sit there for a while, neither of them saying anything.
Retreating back to my impersonalised room, I change into a Captain America shirt which I'm pretty sure was Pete's but I didn't give it a second thought as I pulled my (or Peter's again) Stark Industries jacket on over the that to cover my arms. The scars. The memories. I quickly shook my head. 'I don't have time for this' I think, pulling my hair out is the scrunchie, brushing it through with my fingers and putting some last minute concealer on the fading bruise on my left cheek.
"Hey baby." Her voice was smooth like velvet and she kisses my forehead. I notice a person behind her, staring at us both with adoration. I pull away from Natasha, getting slightly into a fighting stance, my right hand on the arm of my gun, ready to fire if needs be. The red head notices this and puts her hand on my arm.
It has been too long since I last saw you and I suppose I'm the only one to blame for that. I am so sorry my song. I was so drunk on love, I couldn't see what I had right in front of me. I am very aware that no amount of 'I'm sorry's is going to change anything unless I prove it to you and well, that's what I'm going to do. I met a man, Melly, so sweet and kind, we've been married for 7 years. I have a family now. I'm a changed woman and I want you back. I need you back. You're my little girl, even though you're probably not so little anymore. I want you to meet your new step-father and little sister's. We can be a proper little family Mel, the one you always dreamed of us being. Tell the step in Daddies that you'll be hearing from my lawyer's pretty soon. I can't wait to have you back song. I love you Darling.
"I know." Tyler responds, resting her head on her brother's shoulder, taking in the sunset. Who knows how long they were sat there for. Neither of them really cared but both knew that sooner or later they had to go back. It wasn't the same as it was all those years ago, now they have a place to go home to, somebody to hold tonight in bed but they didn't move. Tyler's blue eyes shifted from one grave to another that held a dear significance in her heart. Her eyes shone with unshed tears as she took in the cursive engravement.
"The garage Huh?" I say, standing and shifting her so she's comfortable on my hip. "Daddy like playing in the garage too, so does Petey." The 3 year old lightens up when I say my brother's name. I laugh. "Yes Morgan. He's here." I walk back to the house with her in my grip, just getting to the door when the gate opens and a Blue Beetle rolls through. I put Morgan on the floor, ushering her inside.
"Say no more. And I love the name for it. Wait right here. I'll be 5 minutes tops." She kisses my head and leaves the room. I look at my reflection in the mirror. Yikes. True to her word, Natasha was knocking on the door again within minutes. I gratefully accept the box she hands to me and do my business before stepping out into my room where she was stood waiting with a bag in her hand. She shoves the bag into my hands with a smile.
"She went home earlier, told us to give you a hug from her." Mom explains handing me my already packed bag. Of course she does. She's a mom. I take the bag from her and slip my feet into my trainers, running my fingers through my hair.
"Yeah, why not." I say, keeping my cool. All three men laugh at me and Peter wraps me up in a hug. I hug him back just as tight. 'Let's get out of this shit hole.' I think.
It may come as a shock to you that I actually replied. I wasn't going to but I thought I at least owe you this. You are right when you say it's going to take more than a 'I'm sorry' to fix this. It's going to take more than an 'I'm sorry' to get over the years of abuse that you caused. A lot has happened in my life since you left. The first one being, I no longer go by the name Melody-Elizabeth. My name is Tyler now. I know you would approve after what you told me. I'm 14 now, I still have no idea of how to be a normal kid, just like you said. I miss you too. How can I not? It's nice to hear that you've got a family now, your husband sounds great and I've always wanted little sister's. but I have my own family now. I have two amazing Dads who protect me so much, I have an older brother who loves me, I have enough aunt's and uncle's to last me a life time, I go to a great school, I have great friends and an amazing boyfriend. I'd love to see you again, maybe have you as a part of my family as well but, you hurt me. You hurt me in ways that words can't even begin to explain. I was 3 years old. What could I have possibly done to you that was so bad to force you to leave. And because of that, I was abused and tortured almost everyday of my life. Happy? Did I get what I deserved? I know you're trying but did you think about the mental scars left on me? Did you seriously think I'd just come running into your arms because you told me you'd changed? I'm not that same hopeful, bright eyed little girl anymore Mama, I've grown up. I've seen the horrors of the world with my own eyes. I've witnessed murder. I've killed with my bare hands. All because you thought you were in love. How did that work out for you?
"How about some breakfast Clint?" He gets the hint as he leaves the room, closing the door behind him. The redhead sits on the edge of the bed, looking at me intensely.
"What do you think squirt? Do you like it?" Tony asks, seeming to be genuinely nervous in case I didn't. I didn't answer them. I stood there for a moment before launching myself into their arms, mumbling my thanks over and over again. They don't hesitate in returning the hug. Steve kisses my forehead and tells me that it was no bother. I go into Pete's room with the other two following me and see it's pretty similar to mine but the walls are painted a deep blue colour with all the elements of the periodic table scattered around the room in order. He turns to us with a grin on his face, having the same reaction I did. He hugs them and the cycle repeats. Tony grins at us.
"Shit, sorry kids. What do you like?" After around ten minutes of explaining, we manage to order our food.
"Don't sweat it Pete. Come on. It's late. We better get back before Conrad realises we're missing." Just as she's about to jump off the edge of the roof, Peter grabs her hand, pulling her back to him.
"There's something I need to ask someone very special." He walks over to Pepper and gets down on one knee.
I'm brought back to reality by my treadmill coming to a halt and a pair of arms lifting me up. I sob into their shoulder. I recognise the scent, Steve. I quickly regain my composure and get on the treadmill once again, starting it up.
"Water would be great please." She gives me a thumbs up and picks Brooklyn up with one arm, grabbing my hand with the other. We enter a very open space with a joining kitchen and living room. Mom places Brooklyn in a booster seat at the small round table.
I can't remember the last time any of us sat down and watched a movie or something. It's been too long.
"Where's Pete?" I ask. Tony points to the living room and I head in that direction. Spotting my brother and promptly 'Yeeting' myself onto him.
"Hello?" she asks as Sean pauses the movie, patting me on the shoulder as I try and regulate my breathing.
"Oh yeah. I'm not even drunk. Come on let's go down before Nat comes up here." I pull my girl out of the insanely comfortable double bed in the guest room. I strip down to my bra and panties, looking for the hoodie that I packed.
"Miss Tyler. It's time to wake up. Mr Rogers has asked me to inform you that breakfast is ready." Jarvis' voice fills my room. 'How the fuck did I get up here?' Last night after Clint's little outburst, we all stayed on the common floor and watched movies together. Without even bothering to get dressed just yet, I leave my room and follow the smell of fresh berries and waffles to the kitchen. I walk up to Tony who, as usual, is manning the coffee maker. I reach over him and kiss his cheek, pressing the setting I like on the maker.
"They're on their honeymoon right now but they should be home at some point tonight. We're staying at Natasha and Clint's I'm sure you'll be more than welcome to join us for dinner, you did come all this way after all." The god smiles down at me.
Darkness. Complete darkness. Hand in hand with silence. Senses dialled to 11. Unable to move. Unable to scream. Just forced into the torture of going slowly mad inside of this prison. Feeling lost in both fingers and toes as the bed is submerged deeper into an endless pit of water. So cold. No escape. Chains lying across my chest. Bye, bye breath. Falling further and further. Water entering my ears, sloshing around. Underneath the water, coughing and spluttering does no use. Give up. Never! The weight increases. Falling. 3. 2. 1.
"Tyler I think you should stop. You've been on there for 2 hours. You need a break kiddo." Tony. I don't listen to them. I put my headphones back in and crank it up to full speed. I need to get rid of this feeling. I run. I run until I can't feel my legs and my knees buckle from under me. I fall and go flying as the machine throws me off. I groan in pain as I lay on the padded floor, panting for breath. I look around to see everyone has gone, well almost everyone. I can hear the sound of aggressive knuckles up against the leather of the punching bag coming from the other side of the gym. I haul myself to my feet and move towards the sound. Feeling slightly relived and curious when I saw it was Natasha. I pull my phone out to check the time. It's 1 in the morning. What the hell is she doing up? I shake the thought as I walk calmly over to where the spare bags are lying on the floor, picking one up casually and clipping it to the ceiling, beginning to hit it with no protection on my hands. The redhead looks over at me with wide eyes.
"Ah, there's sleeping beauty. Enjoy the sleep Princess?" instead of stooping to his level of sarcasm, I simply flip him off as I tie my laces.
The Chinese came within the next twenty minutes and the two men left me to change. And that's what I did. I got out of my bloodied shirt and pulled on the light blue 'eat, sleep, game, repeat' shirt Steve had pulled out for me. Along with a pair of leggings with multiple rips in. I think no more of it as I rush towards the kitchen to where they were sharing out the food. Hopping into my seat, a bottle of water gets thrown at my face, my advanced reflexes allowing me to catch it. Tony stares at me with a smile on his face. I glare at him.
"Yes and no. I mean, I've been going to therapy for months but you're going to be there this time. So is dad. That alone scares me." I finish off my coffee just as the elevator opens.
"What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?" I know that voice, I remember this situation, this is how my and Wade met, how we started. I decide to play along.
"Yeah. Yeah I did, we could do with some chairs and benches or stuff like that, especially around the pond, there's a lot to draw out there."
"That's where your wrong. I stopped loving him the moment he put his hands on you. And not in the battle." I place the frame down picture first so I couldn't see it. Dad looked guilty af.
"I was never given a lot of food. I went weeks without eating when I was younger and Conrad used to use it as a punishment; depriving you of food so my appetite isn't really as good as it should be." I explain most of it and my dadsmy dad's look at me in thought. Tony looks straight into my blue orbs.
"Miss Quinzel, would you like to tell me why your name has changed?" I pretend to think for a moment.
"Are you sure you want these two? I'm sure I can find you some much better children if you'll give me the chance." Tony raises his hand to silence the woman.
"Why wouldn't I be? You're important to me Tyler, no matter how much you don't believe it. I'll always be here, I promise." I shake my head, looking away.
"About time." Peter jokes as I meet them in the lobby. I stick the tongue out at my older brother. Dad sighs.
"Don't call me shadow doofus." She says seriously, letting him know she wasn't playing around anymore.
"Come in Spidey-boy!" I yell. Ignoring the strange look I got from Steve. Peter and Tony walk into my room and I see Tony looking around out of the corner of my eye.
"You want to adopt us?" Her voice was lower than her sisters but cautious and harmonious in its own way.
"You ready? Oh, here let me help." She guides me to sit on the edge of the bed and kneels behind me, reaching for something on the bedside table. "It's a detangling brush. Should help get through these knots." I nod and she begins moving it gently through my hair, trying not to hurt me. Once finished she runs her fingers through it slowly.
"Yup. Can you cut my hair again? Like you did before?" I take my bottom lip between my teeth and begin biting away at the skin, Tony notices and pulls on my lip gently so I let it go.
"No but thank you." I walk towards the kitchen area and see Tony shaking the coffee maker. I clear my throat to make my presence known. His head snaps in my direction and he gives me a small smile.
After food, I find myself sat at my desk, pen and paper in front of me, pondering over what to write. 'Should I even do this? Does she deserve a response? She's my mom, I owe her this right?' I pick up the pen in my right hand and place it to the paper. No more hesitations.
"Look Tones, I've got a fan!!!" We both laugh at the way he said it as he disappears yet again, returning this time with some actual clothes for me to change into in his hands. I take them from him and set them down on the pillows behind me. Steve comes over and sits on the other side of me, running his hands softly through the ends of my hair. I knew where this conversation was going. And I didn't like it. Tony sighs.
"Happy Birthday little sis." He says. I smile up at him. There's a crash from behind us. we spin around, getting in a fighting stance to see dad and papa standing there, clipboards of some sort laying now on the ground.
"Wade, MJ, Happy is going to drop you home once you've finished breakfast so you can change and grab you things so no need to worry." I roll my eyes. Trust Papa to think that either of them are worrying about their school supplies. I pull the cereal out of the cupboard along with 4 bowls, pouring one for each of us as dad cuts up some fruit and puts it on a plate. I give everyone a filled bowl, placing the milk and fruit in the centre of the bar.
"Bucky? Come on man, wake up. You're scaring me." Bucky shoots up into a sitting position, glaring at me with empty eyes. These aren't the eyes that were smiling earlier. His metal hand reaches out and grabs my throat, pressing me up against the wall. My eyes widen in fear.
"Brooklyn! What have I told you about opening the door without mine or daddy's permission?" I know that voice anywhere. The woman in question reaches down and scoops the small girl up into here arms, tickling her gently. I smile at their interaction. We used to be like that.
"Don't sweat it. It's my fault for not telling you and like I just said, you guys are the best birthday present ever." They don't listen to me though, when do they ever. Just 2 hours later I find myself sat at the long table on the common floor, surrounded by gifts that I have yet to open and my family. Tony pushes a box into my hands.
"But you don't want to talk because you're scared that somebody will hurt you if you do." She nods again. My heart clenches.
"Maybe, though, I think Nat can teach you some things as well. She seemed pretty impressed. I mean, we all were. You've got a mean punch." I laugh at his comment, leaning more into his embrace.
"Don't let. Him hurt you Spidey. If he does you tell me." I whisper low enough so only he can hear me. He smiles back and pulls me in for a hug. The rest of the day dragged like hell until finally, I was sat in the back seat of Papa's blue beetle listening to Peter animatedly tell the blond about his day.
"Hey guys." His voice soft as he takes cautious steps into the room. "Jarvis said you needed this." Steve took it from his hand with a smile, opening it as Tony sits next to me, putting his hand on my back. I jump as something cold is put on my arm. Steve chuckles slightly.
"Kids, can we talk to you?" Tony says, a calm tone to his voice that I'm not used to hearing from a man. Me and Pete sit on the bed staring at them. Steve kneels down in front of my brother and Tony does the same to me, so we're eye level.
"Umm sex doesn't matter neither does age. We just want a kid who's life we can make a difference in."
"Ready to go?" dad asks in a similar fashion. I glance around at each of the faces surrounding me, my eyes lingering on MJ's a soft smile creeping onto my face.
"Hey Ty. This is for you." He hands me a black backpack with purple zips and seams. It's pretty heavy so I open it and find everything that I could possibly ever need for school. A full pencil case, 3 binders, Notebooks, textbooks. Everything.
"Tyler? Pete? Can you come down please?" I hear Tony's voice yell up the stairs as I clung onto my brother for dear life, sobs racking through my body. He holds me tightly, whispering things in my ears in attempts to calm me. It doesn't work. I begin shaking even more. Footsteps approach.
The night comes to an end sooner that anyone could even think. Most of the kids are out for the count other than Lila. the almost 9 year old was leaning against her father's side. I remember all the times I did that over the years.
"If it's okay with you," Steve starts looking at both of us. "We'd like to adopt you." I couldn't believe it. My brain refused to process it. I hear Peter say yes and turn to me but I'm frozen. I've been waiting for this day for so long and now it's here.
"I can't believe you convinced her to let you come along." I tell my boyfriend. He wasn't allowed on the trip because he didn't bring his slip back but he managed to sweet talk his way out of it, as usual.
"I know but I wanted to. I got one for each of them actually but you never told me how old they were so I had to kind of guess."
"Of course doll, in a heartbeat. I'll leave you in piece. See you later Tyler." I wave him out of my room as I collapse into my bed, closing my eyes.
"You clean them up and you." She says turning to Pete. "Come with me." We wish each other luck with our eyes and set out with the tasks we'd been given. By the time I had got the younger children looking presentable, it was 9:35. People would start showing up at around 10 so that gave me about 15 minutes to fix whatever a mess I looked like even though I know that there is no point. No one wants a 14-year-old, deep down I hoped that one day, someone would come and save me and Peter before it's too late.
"Yeah. I just don't want to take them anymore. I'm getting better." They both share a glance. "Seriously guys, I'm okay. Better than okay actually."
We pull into the driveway and the first thing we notice is the car sitting just outside of the door. I climb out of the vehicle and grab my bag from off of the floor, slinging the strap over my shoulder, advancing towards the door. I push it open, hearing the voices that I knew too well carry through from the kitchen.
"What the fuck Parker. Quinzel. Who did you sleep with to get Hawkeye to pretend to know you?" I get up in Flash's face.
"I smell Nat's pancakes, must have before Pete eats them all." We bounce into the kitchen to see Clint feeding pancakes to their 2 year old daughter, Lila.
"Wade." I stand in the same stance as Natasha did back in my room, trying to ignore how hot he looked in his dress pants and shirt.
"It was you." I glare at him. "You're the one that did this to me." Tear stream down my face as I lift my shirt to show him my mark. He's crying too.
I wake with a start. Shooting up into a sitting position, my hand clutching at my chest. It was just a dream. I let out a breath of relief and collapse back into the comfy foam, allowing it to surround me. I pull back the light grey comforter and kick my legs to hang off the side of the bed, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.
"That's a very pretty name for a very pretty girl. My name's Tyler. I'm your big sister." The small girl gasp slightly, looking between me and Mom. Mom nods.
Food was passed around the table. Chicken and Peas were flying everywhere. The chatter was pretty loud, filled with old stories and laughs, I just sit there fidgeting nervously, both people either side of me notice.
open and Pete comes running in, sweaty and out of breath. I drown out his streams of excuses and apologies as I get a bottle of water, downing it in one.
"Kids, there's going to be some rules as you know. None of them are hard to follow and most of them are common sense." I couldn't stop the comment that came out of my mouth.
"I am calm." I snap. I take a few deep breaths through my nose. "Just get my dads in here." He picks up the phone in the room and calls through to reception, tell them to let my family through. Within 3 minutes there's a knock on the door, dad peeking his head round the corner. I gesture them inside and the three of them take a seat on the couch, Nat pulling be off the bag and into her lap. I relax in the familiar arms, resting my head on her shoulder. I pay near to know attention to what they're saying.
It took them 4 hours to do 6 girls hair and makeup, including the bride. I trudge up to my room and wait for Natasha to come out. She does eventually, wearing the bridesmaid dress that mom picked out. It was a light blue with a low cut neck, showing off quite a bit of cleavage, it stuck to her slim figure and did her hips wonders though.
"Get dressed we're going out and if you bring that book with you I'll sell all your things. Be ready in 30."
"Okay, okay I got it. I just came to see if we could finish lunch without anymore dramatic teenage outbursts." Now I did look up. I was furious. I glared at the goateed man as a thin layer of black mist forms around my closed fists. Wanda is the first to notice.
"Yeah Honey, we want to adopt you guys, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?" A little smile creeps its way onto Blake's face.
"My beautiful, beautiful girl. Why baby? Why did you do this to yourself?" More tears. I started sobbing.
"Can I help you, gentlemen?" She queries kindly, like nothing had happened. Like they hadn't just walked in on her trying to strangle a child. Pete ran in passed them and skidded to a halt when he saw me. He wrapped his arms around me and reminded me to breathe.
Successfully finding the kitchen, I smile at my; dare I say family? Steve is standing at the stove cooking what looks like pancakes wearing an apron that says 'kiss the chef', Tony is standing with his back to him, manning the coffee maker and Pete. Well, who knows what he's doing. He's sat at the island looking at his phone with a stupidly big smile on his face. I pull out the stool next to him and plop down, laying my head on his shoulder, closing my eyes. I feel his lips on the side of my head. I mumble my good morning to him and he does the same back. Steve turns to face me with a massive grin on his face.
"Well I just thought, maybe, I could sort of go out as Spider-Man. He's not been around for a few days and I just want to check everything is okay and stuff." He looks up at our new dads, his eyes wide in panic. "It's completely fine if you don't want me to go. I understand I just thought." He was cut off by Tony raising his hand.
"Morning Tyler. You'll go through to James for about 15 minutes then your family will be called back okay?" I nod. "Well then, he's ready for you. See you later darling."
"What do you need to say Tyler?" Dad asks, looking confused. My leg starts bouncing under the table. Nat puts her hand down to stop it and grabs my free one.
"7 actually. Now eat up. You need it." I do as he says and stab a piece of waffle with my fork, enjoying the flavour. Steve and Tony sit opposite us and we eat in silence. Tony coughs, pointing his fork at the both of us.
"Thanks." With that we were off again, running up the stairs and swinging around the corner. I find my door easily. It's right opposite mom and Dad's. I suppose that's in case of any nightmares or anxiety attacks. I push open my door and gasp at the inside. Pepper definitely had a hand in this. The walls were painted a light grey and blue, music notes going from one corner to another. A window seat that looks out onto the gardens with my guitars and amps already set up, my pictures already hung up on the wall: the one where me Pete, MJ and Ned went to Taco Bell, one of me and all the Avengers, ones with me, Nat and Clint. I pick up the one sat on my desk. It was taken on our one year adopt-aversary  me, dad, Peter and Steve. All smiling and happy.
"We should go. Tony will be getting worried." I nod and walk behind the super human, quickly matching his pace.
"I, umm, I hang out with my brother, Peter, a lot. We do more or less everything together. I love to build, I'm really into science and technology and stuff. I love music and art. I umm helped Pete make that robot they're working on. Oh reading as well. I love to read. It's my escape from reality. As well as writing. Sometimes I go and just sit somewhere with a beautiful view, write a description of it and then draw it. Umm, I really like animals. I used to have a dog called Thunderstruck, like the AC/DC song. I just realised that I've not stopped talking and now I'm going to. Yeah." Steve sits there with a massive grin on his face, patting the spot next to him. I feel comfortable enough to sit that close now so I do as he asks. He strikes up a conversation about books and I tell him some of my favourites and he tells me his. We talk for a long time, I'm not really sure how long but our talk is only stopped by a knock on my door.
The 'Party floor' as we called it was already packed with Avengers and family by the time I got there. Clint's sister and three kids were there along with Scott Lang's daughter. I spot Peter, MJ, Ned and Wade in the far corner talking to Bruce. Deciding to sneak up on Wade, I talk a running jump at the boy, attaching myself to him like a baby koala.
"I love you 3000 Tyler." Tears well up in my eyes as I walk over to the 4 year old, scooping her up in my arms, planting a kiss on her head.
"I grant custody of Tyler-Kai Logan Stark-Rogers to, Antony Edward and Steven Grant Stark-Rogers." I hold my face in my hands as sobs rip from me, I throw my arms around my dad's as my tears soak the shoulders of their suits. They don't seem to care though as they pull me tighter. But the judge isn't finished.
"Not so fast kiddo. Butt on sofa. Go." I grumble but follow my father's order, knowing that the talk is inevitable.
"You okay baby boy?" Wade whispers in my ear. I nod, wringing my hands nervously under the table. I take a deep shaky breath.
"Yes Ma'am." We chorus, following the now barefoot archer out to the car. This is going to be a mad week.
"Well come on in, Sean is dying to meet you and so are the girls." I step through thee threshold, clutching my bag to my chest. The place is nice, much better than our old, stuffy, one bedroom apartment in Queens. My social worker turns to me.
"I missed you too little bird. What's going on around here?" He slowly makes his way to my bed, sitting down with me still in his lap.
Sun sets on the city of Queens. The masked hero lays on the roof of an apartment complex, taking in the view around them, scouting for crimes that needed someone like himself to step in. Across the way, the mysterious figure sees something. Or rather someone. A smile creeps up onto his face as he pulls the mask up slightly so his mouth was uncovered.
"10 more bites." His tone left no room for argument so I picked my fork  back up and tried to make the bites as small as possible.
"It happens sometimes, it's just a side effect." They both nod and Tony decides to head back to their bedroom to get some sleep.
"They're all stressed about the court case. My mom's really close to getting visitation rights. Who've thought her new husband was a lawyer right?" I finish with a humourless laugh.
"And on that note," Peter says, gaining everyone's attention. "I also have something to say." He takes a deep breath just like I did and looks at me. I encourage him with my eyes.
"Tony we need your help." I scoff at his bluntness but choose to keep my mouth shut for once. Dad sighs and sits down in the chair.
"Want to come and see our rooms? I'm sure they'll tell you more than we can." I say smartly and I lead the group up three flights of stairs, up to the top floor where our bedrooms lie. We go into my brother's room first because that's where we spend most of our time, building this or improving that. The adults look around the walls and I know why, every time I draw Pete something, he hangs it on the wall, like Aunt May used to. There's a periodic table above the bed because, reasons and then finally, in the far corner, our inventor's desk.
"You're a good kid Tyler. Now go get ready, you'll be late else." I salute him and stand up, heading towards my room to get changed. I pull on my black ripped jeans and a Queen T shirt with Steve's jacket. I put in my ear spikes and my trademark choker around my neck. Before brushing my fingers through my hair and pulling on my Black Widow converse. I walk back out to the living room to see Pete sat there with a red and blue backpack at his feet, practically bouncing with excitement. Steve sees me come in.
"Tony, he's right. We've put so much time into showing the courts that we're good dads, we've forgotten to be good dads." Steve turns to face me, brushing some strands of hair off of my forehead. "I'm so sorry Tyler. I promise. I'm going to spend more time with you." I smile slightly at him and lean away from Nat when he opens his arms for a hug. Soon enough, all the others had joined, saying how sorry they are for their neglect, promises to do things with me but it'll all have to wait. Tomorrow was the day. Tomorrow was court day. I'm not ready for this.
"It's been over 2 years, and you're old, I get that, but have you really forgotten that I can teleport?" I answer smartly, pulling myself off of the floor. "As to why I'm here, I have no idea. I was just sent here. It was a glitch." Steve stares at me for a while before pulling me in for a bone crushing hug. I squirm and try and get out of his arms.
"Anytime kiddo, I had fun, look after Tasha for me." We ride the elevator down to the garage and hop into Natasha's black convertible, pulling the roof down because it's warm outside.
"Baby? Wake up." MJ's breath tickles the side of my neck. I open my eyes slowly, turning my head to face my girlfriend.
"Wade!" I yell back. Leaping out of my seat and rushing into the older boys arms. I jump up, wrapping my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck.
"Hey Penis, scarry, ready to see your best friends, the avengers? And let's see how many people know about your internship."
"What my husband here is trying to say is, we could do with knowing what happened so kk we know what to do and what not to do. Like say if somebody was suicidal, we wouldn't put a lock on the door for obvious reasons. You get me? We want to make sure you're safe at all times." Both of us reluctantly agree and have a mental battle about who will go first. I give Pete my puppy dog eyes and he sighs. I crack a small smile knowing that I'd won as Peter starts.
"Are you the Stark-Jones'?" I nod getting a little tired with her attitude. "I'll tell Ms that you're here, please come in." She holds the door open wide enough for us to fit through and scurries off into the office. I shiver at the sight of the office, memories hitting me like a brick. The girl emerges with Conrad. She doesn't look any different, a few grey hairs but nothing major. She smiles that all fake smile when she sees us.
"We're going on a field trip to our own home!!" Peter explains to his best friend. I see MJ trying to keep her cool but I can see her lip in between her teeth, something she does when she's nervous.
"Be down in 5 minutes. You've got work to do." And with that, she left. I stand with a groan, stretching out my back and other limbs that are tired from the lack of sleep. Rubbing my bloodshot eyes, I get changed into something that deems barely decent to meet possible parents in. Pulling my now messy hair into a bun, the door is opened, much gentler than last time and Peter sticks his head around it.
"Move it Tiger. Nat's here already." That's all the motivation I need as I sprint to the living room, going straight for the slim woman who has now adopted me as her niece.
"You'll be hearing from my lawyer within the next week." Tony says to Conrad and with that, he turns to us. "Come on kids, let's get your stuff packed up." Me and Pete rush upstairs, Steve hot on our tail. We get to our rooms and split off. Tony comes into mine to help me pack up my stuff which isn't a lot. Most of the clothes are hand me downs and it doesn't help when you're the oldest so most of my clothes once belonged to Peter. Don't judge me, they're comfy. I pack all of my art stuff away and throw my bag over my shoulder. I do a once over of the now almost empty room. I remember something. How could I forget it? I reach under my bed and pull out my guitar case. Uncle Ben got it for me for my birthday before he died. I've kept it ever since. I carefully swing it over my shoulder along with my bag and walk out of my room going into Peter's to see how he's getting on. The scene in front of me was nothing short of pure comedy; Peter sat on top of his suitcase as Steve tried to zip it up. I laugh at the two men and walk over to our desk, beginning to put things into boxes and bags. I was soon joined by the billionaire, playboy and we worked in complete silence, putting books and tools away and piling them up by the door whilst Steve and my brother took everything down from the walls. I didn't even realise I was singing until Tony joined in with the chorus. Heat rushes towards my cheeks and I look down. I can feel Steve smiling at me.
"Never, ever do that again okay Tiger? We want to help. Please let us help." He says into my hair. I nod as I bury my head into his shoulder. He pats my back reassuringly.
"I don't know kid but there's nothing we can do." I sigh sadly and run my hands down my face. Tony pats my knee.
"I was just about to ask you the same thing." The arms that were restricting me suddenly let go, making me drop to the floor, hissing as my knees smack on the concrete.
"Good and I hate to say it but the social have got in touch. You've got to go round to your mom's after school." I groan falling back onto the bed.
"What's going on Tyler?" His voice held so much emotion as he reached for my hand. I pull away, interlocking my fingers on my lap, avoiding eye contact.
"Oh, Sparky." She says, her voice laced with sadness and concern as she looks around my room; clothes were thrown everywhere, pictures were smashed, blood filled towels strewn about and glass all around.
"Oh umm yeah. Yeah I did thanks. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in and the awakening by Jarvis was nice so." I look down embarrassed and the men chuckle.
I jump out of the shower; a towel wrapped tightly around my body and using another to rub at my hair. Being the absolute genius I am, note the sarcasm, the outfit I plan on wearing is already set out on the bed. I change quickly, hating the feeling of the cold on my arms. The outfit consists of some black sweats, an oversized MIT crimson hoodie and fuzzy socks. As you can probably tell, I'm in a lazy mood. Giving my hair a quick blast with the hair dryer and throwing it up into a messy bun before grabbing my guitar and heading towards the living room where the super soldier waits. Sliding, quite literally, into the room and catching my Papa's attention as his once focused frown turns into a smile. My expression mirrors his and I plop down on the coffee table in front of the sofa where he's sat. I lay the case gently on the floor next to me and pull out my guitar. It was an acoustic guitar. Made of a light oak with black and gold trimmings. It was small but so was I when I was 7.
"You need to get better and this is going to help you so whatever James decides today is what we go with." Steve replies in his 'no argument' tone. Thinking better of replying, I stare out of the window, watching as the colours blur passed. A hand sits on my knee.
"Go back inside Kids, lunch will be getting cold." I look up and lock eyes with the redhead assassin.
"It's just me Angel. Just cleaning you up." He continues to run the wipe up and down my arms until all of the dried blood is gone. The damage wasn't as bad as it's been before, but it certainly wasn't the best. None of us say a word as the blond rewraps my arm. When he finished he stood up from the floor and walked over to my wardrobe. Pulling the doors open and stepping inside.
"Hey Ty have you seen my- What the Hell did you do?" He walks over to me hastily, running his fingers through my now short hair. I shrug.
"Edward, Ned, Leeds. Level 6. Welcome back Ned." The whole class was losing their shit over that imagine how they feel when we go through.
"Damn straight." Is all I say, a giggle escaping my lips. Not after too long we arrive at the share floor of Natasha and Clint, who by the way is standing right in front of the doors when they open holding a box full of junk food and Disney movies.
"Come on Underoo's." he says as he plucks him off with ease, throwing him over his shoulder. Pete squeals as he lifts his head up, his big brown eyes locking on me.
"So kids, how was your day?" dad asks, taking a bite of his food. Yet again, Peter starts giving an extremely detailed description of his day while the rest of us sit and listen, adding input when necessary.
"My mother gave that to me before she died. That part there," he points to the red and gold ball at the end of the leather rope. "Is a fraction of a dying star. I was instructed to give it to the girl that stole my heart, and I have a feeling that might just be you." I clasp it around my neck and grin up at my uncle.
"Thanks Papa." We both say before the car falls into a comfortable silence for the rest of the ride.
"Go. Be with your family. I'm sure your social worker will be in touch with us soon enough." I don't need to be told twice. I say a quick goodbye and run to my family. We all burst out the door and start singing 'We are family' as we head towards the limo. Dad claps his hands together.
"I'll be there in a moment babe." Steve says as he kisses Tony, I cover my eyes and pretend to be disgusted when I was actually cheering inside.
The door was flung open not a second later, but instead of being greeted by my mom, there is a small girl the other side of the door. Her light blonde hair in two tuffs on the top of her head and her big green eyes shining in curiosity, with a teddy bear clutched under her arm. Footsteps can be heard in the distance.
"You been causing Mommy and Daddy trouble huh?" I ask as I shift the child so she's sitting comfortably on my hip whilst also putting my bag on the floor. She giggles in response. I place her on the floor before plopping down on one of the bar stools.
"Tyler! Hurry up. You're going to be late!" Steve shouts from the kitchen. I grab my shoes and shove my feet into them, not bothering with the laces.
"Yeah and Tiger, with the amount you've been eating, you're not stable. So before you go back out there, we need you healthy. So why don't we take a seat and we can talk things out yeah? Calmly. We can just talk. You can tell us whatever is bothering you." I nod slightly. Not happy with what I was being told but knowing better than to argue.  Dragging my feet over to the counter and sitting on one of the stools, waiting for the adults to join me. It doesn't take them long to grab a drink and sit opposite me. Talk about intimidation much. A cup of coffee is placed in front of me but I didn't lift my head up. Not until Steve cleared his throat, catching my attention. My blue eyes snap up to meet his, the comforting gaze making me feel uneasy. I'm not used to this much compassion.
"Coming mom." We yell back, brushing the grass off of out legs, joining hands and walking back towards the house.
"Right, you have this lesson and next to practice then you're preforming to the class. Get in your pairs and start." He claps his hands and sits back down at his desk. Everyone starts shuffling about, asking each other to work with them. No one bothers to come near me and Wade. We only work with each other. I turn to my boyfriend with a smile.
"I know. I know. But we've just got to stay strong okay? We've got a family so let's hold onto them with everything we got."
"You can go if you want." He whispers but I just shake my head. I want to know what they'll say. He nods and turns his attention back to my fathers, his demeanour instantly changing.
"I dreamt that Hydra made me into winter and made me hurt you. You were bleeding Tyler. I killed your family in front of you because Hydra wanted you back." I stood up abruptly. All the pieces were falling together; the metal arm, the cold eyes, the heartlessness.
"No buts Tyler, I know you didn't eat lunch today. Eat." I say nothing more but shovel the food into my mouth. 10 bites later I stand abruptly only to be stopped by Steve.
"Good sport. I'll get Jarvis to tell you when dinners ready. Now do your homework. Get smart. Read a book." He flashes me a billion dollar smile before closing my door behind him. I pull the stack of homework I'd been given out of my bag. Seriously, who gives homework on the first day back? It should be illegal.
"Speaking of dinner, what do you guys want?" My stomach starts churning at the mere thought of food.
"Great, I'll go and order that, you guys get ready for dinner. Tones will you stay up here and then show them where the dining room is please?" He was answered with a quick 'yes darling' from Tony as him and Peter had already gotten into a discussion about his web shooters. The buff blond shakes his head. He looks at me and notices the lack of attention I am getting. Again, not complaining. He stretches a hand out for me to take which I do hesitantly. He leads me through to what I'm assuming is the kitchen and picks up the phone, gesturing me to take a seat at the island in the centre. I pull out a white stool and have trouble pulling myself up onto it. Curse being short. Steve looks over at me, phone in hand.
"Well..." He started. "She seems nice." I smile and Pete bursts out into a fit of giggles. The man who made the comment looked at him weirdly.
"Tony, you're the love of my life. I could not ask for a better husband. I love you and I promise to prove that to you every day. You have made my life so much better by just being in it. You're an amazing lover and an even better dad. I love you and I love those kids and I promise to forever. You've got me crying now Stark." Everyone lets out a tear filled chuckle.
"Angel, we need to get you and Pete checked out, like medically. For your enhanced abilities and stuff so our friend Bruce is going to come round later along with Natasha."
"Of course Ms Stark. Have a good break." I wave off my overly enthusiastic sectary and continue the trek down the halls.  Not before long the I arrive at the glass door of the private laboratory, punching the code into the pad, opening the doors and stepping inside.
"Sure kid, what do you need help with?" He asks, moving closer to look over Peter's shoulder. I know he's asking about the robot we were building the other day. We completed the circuit but nothing happened afterwards which was a bit of a let-down.  I take a seat on Peter's bed so I can watch what Tony's doing as he works in silence. We stay that way for a few minutes before I feel a hand on my shoulder. I flinch away from the touch and Steve apologises immediately. I smile at him.
"It was Melody. Melody-Elizabeth. It's what I called my guitar. I got my guitar and my name change on the same day. I didn't want Melody to die so I gave my name away. I don't regret it." Just as she was about to reply, a voice cut through the low hum of the food court.
"Wait." I begin. Everyone looks at me. "Star Wars Marathon?" I ask getting a round of yes's as replies. We made a fort out of blankets because we're like 6 and situated ourselves on the floor, wrapped up in blankets, eyes trained on the screen. Half way through the 4th movie my eyes grew heavy. I rest my head on Wade's lap and his fingers went straight into my hair. I fall asleep with a smile on my face.
"Our oldest, Peter. There are so many words to describe him. Smart, funny, confident, a pain in the ass when he wants to be, calm, considerate. He's our son. He's the best son we could ever ask for. He's an amazing big brother, a great little scientist, he's the heir to Stark industries for God's sake. He's perfect. Peter, you're perfect. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. We love you our son." There's a round of applause as the mic is passed back to dad. Oh god.
"I'm sorry. I just feel really over protective of you. You've been through enough, I don't want him to break your heart as well." It's my turn to sigh. I turn my body to face the older woman.
"I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you Tyler." I feel her lips on my head and she leaves the room only to be replaced by my dad.
"How about we watch a movie?" Nat asks to take my attention away from my absent father. I nod and Clint carries me to the bed, setting me down and climbing in next to me, pulling me into his side. I cuddle up next to him as Nat puts Pitch Perfect into my tv before jumping in next to me. We sit and watch the movie in silence. enjoying each-others company.
Endgame spoilers but not endgame spoilers bc the snap never happened but spoilers. If that makes sense. Enjoy!!
With the papers signed, the girls stuff packed and them loaded into the car we begin the drive back to the house that was built around 2 years ago on my father's land. We wanted to stay close by him and it was a reasonable distance from the tower.
"It's not funny. I need caffeine!" We both laugh at the older man and I notice Pete standing in the doorway, a smile of adoration plastered on his face. I'm not the only one to notice him.
"Well come here." I don't need to be told twice as I sprint into his arms, wrapping myself around him as our lips meet for a passionate kiss.
When everyone had finished up and Peter had made sure I'd had more than 2 slices, I help Tony clear up as Steve and Peter choose a movie for us to watch. We finished the dishes and went to join the other two on the sofa, jumping under the blanket. I sat along-side my brother as Tony cuddled into his husband. The title scene for Jurassic Park rolled and I smiled widely. I love this movie, I love dinosaurs. About an hour into the movie, my eyelids began to grow heavy and soon enough I was slipping between conscious and unconscious. Sleep finally consumed me. I woke slightly at the feeling of someone grabbing me. My eyes shoot open lazily, still tired. I feel someone try and sooth me like you do a small child.
"Okay. Okay. My turn now." The over excited brunette hands me a large box. I open it to find a canvas painting of the picture of Me, Pete, May and Ben. The one inside of my locker. My hand shoots up to my mouth and my arms wrap around my brother.
"Ready baby?" MJ asks when I get closer to her. I nod and pull the door open, holding it for her to walk through. She joins our hands together as we walk to the car, sliding into the back of the limo with my parent, brother and sister.
"And you're." I fade off, holding up my jacket so he can see the Stark Industries logo on the side. he chuckles to himself.
"Hey loser, nervous?" MJ asks me. Her, Pete, Wade and now I guess Natasha are the only ones to know about me.
"Don't thank me Tyler, this is what family does. Now dry your eyes, me and you are going to have a sleepover tomorrow, I've already cleared it with your dads so don't worry. I just need you to tell me what sort of movies and food you like." My smile widens at her words. I've never had a sleepover before.
I wake disorientated a few hours later. 'Well, this isn't my room.' It's only then the heavy thing laying across me is brought to my attention. 'What the fuck? Okay this is how I'm going to die.' I just about manage to lift my upper body into a slight sitting position to find that it's an arm that is draped across me. Bucky's arm to be exact. Memories from the previous night come rushing back. It was him. He did this. But at the same time, it wasn't him, he had no idea. God I don't know what to make of this. I skilfully slide out of the bed without waking the ex-assassin, going to my own room to take a shower and hopefully forget the events of last night.
"Hello Miss Tyler, what sort of shower would you like? The options are: quick, steaming, relaxing or bubble bath." I sigh. 'Of course Jarvis controls this. Why wouldn't he?'
"Umm Aunt Tasha, this is my boyfriend, Wade. Wade this is Natasha, my aunt." Wade smiles his million dollar smiles and extends his hand.
"I really don't but thank you. I guess." I say nothing else as I lug the final box over to the rest of them, giving a small groan as I all but drop it. I turn to look at my, new family I guess. They're all stood there, laughing at something Peter said.
"What's going on Tyler?" He asks after a few minutes silence. I don't respond, keeping my eyes trained on my hands. He sighs running his fingers through his hair.
"Please. Just try Tyler." Steve's voice broke through my inner battle. I nod and pick up my fork, scooping up some rice and eating it. It actually wasn't that bad. Not that I'd admit that. There was hardly any chat whilst we ate, maybe just the odd question but soon enough all the boys had finished their plates and then some, and I, well I'd managed to eat just over half of mine. Steve stacked all four on top of each other and smiled sadly at me when he saw just how much I'd eaten. I hold my hands up in defence.
We get to our floor and I change into my pyjamas, instantly flopping onto my bed. Dad comes in shortly after.
"Ahem." Somebody cleared their throat from the doorway and Conrad let go instantly, acting like she was helping me. I push her hands away and start shaking violently. The witch puts a smile on her face.
"Tell me Mr and Mr Stark-Rogers, why do you think it's in Tyler's best interest for her to stay with you?" Steve answers.
"Bull crap Ty, please, eat something." He begs with me and I sigh, knowing that I can't win. I pull a slice of pepperoni pizza on to my plate and begin nibbling at it. 'I'll just throw it back up later.'
"Morning Ty. Sleep well?" I say yeah as I reach for a bottle of water. He looks me up and down, eyebrow raised.
"For once, I agree with her on this one." Like always, I pull open my locker and grab my growing collection of homework that is all due on Monday. Great. We walk out of the school in a line, the boys still talking about the trip and me and MJ talking about Pepper Potts.
"Sure we will Little Bird. Go get some rest. Your wife is waiting for you." I smile at them and move to lift Morgan into my arms.
The door opens and even though I'm seeing the room for the second time, it didn't fail to take my breath away. Steve takes my hand and leads me over to the Shadow side of the room. The walls were decorated in computers and what seemed to be a weapon wall. Damn I could use them. In the centre of the space was a mannequin, decked out in what looked like a modified version of my suit. I look over my shoulder to see Steve smiling encouragingly at me.
'what's your favourite movie?' 'Favourite colour.' Stuff that both me and Pete knew practically off by heart. It was Tony's turn for a question.
"No. No. No. Please no. Daddy! Don't let them take me please. Daddy! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll fix it. I promise. Please! I love you." Screams and sobs rip from my throat, my eyes still closed. Steve drops me quite harshly to the ground. I curl myself up into a ball, unable to control my breathing. Clint snaps out of it first, crouching down beside me.
"It is currently 9:12 am. The temperature outside is 34 degrees Celsius." The robotic voice replied. I whistle under my breath. 'God it's gonna be hot.' I think as I start to get dressed.
"Okay, one time, Aunt May went to work and left us with uncle Ben I was about 5 and Pete was 6. He tried for about an hour to get me and Pete into the dresses May had picked out, so he left us with the next door neighbour and ran to the charity shop near the apartment. He brought two pairs of boys jeans and two t shirts. We put those on form that point onwards they started noticing especially in that one, that we weren't ordinary girls. Pete changed his name, I changed mine. They excepted us as their nephews instead of nieces. Until when I was 7, I started to become more girly, one day I'd wear some Demin shorts and a dinosaur t shirt, climbing trees just like Pete then the next, I was wearing a princess dress with absolutely no drive to go and run about outside. Almost like I was a completely different person." Just as I finished my story the door burst open, showing a very sweaty Steve. Tony glares at him as I just bite my lip in apprehension. Everyone seems to be giving him dirty looks by how he's not making eye contact with anyone.
"Well honey, I'm not going to hurt you. I promise. Do you think maybe, one day, you'll trust me enough to talk to me." A barely there nod has me grinning.
"Then we should have no problems." Tony starts cracking up, leaning back in his chair, clapping his hands. Steve sighs happily.
"It's going to be fine Ty, Dad and Papa have got this. Is Wade coming?" I sigh thinking about my boyfriend. I've not seen him in a few days.
"Oh Tyler." I hear them all say. I stand up moving away from them like they'd just told me they'd got the plague.
"Get dressed swine. We need to leave soon." I do as I'm told and walk into my room, closing the door behind me. I pull my suit out of it's bag. I refused to wear a dress so I got a suit like all the boys even though mom insisted I got ready with her. I pull on the crisp white shirt and the slate grey trousers, toying with the tie around my neck.
"No it was your turn. Wait. Liz." I turn to the girl sat on the other side of me. "What are we doing?" She smiles kindly at me. She was a very kind person. She got hurt a lot.
"Listen прекрасный, I know you don't want to take them. I know you're scared. But if you don't, you're going to be stuck in this loop forever. You're going to end up killing yourself Tyler. And I know once upon a time, not so long ago, that is what you wanted, but I can see it in your eyes, right now that you don't want that ending anymore because you've got people who love you and who'll miss you if you go. We want you to get better, and if this is what they're offering you, it's worth a try right? If they don't work we'll go back to square one and try something else. But please, for us, give it a go." I stare into her green eyes that are slowly filling with tears.
"Tyler! They'll be here in half an hour. Hurry up." Papa yells up the stairs. I groan as I grab my hair dryer, blasting my hair. 'I need to get it cut again soon.' I pay no attention to him as I pull on my jeans and button up my shirt. 'I look gay. I love it.'
"Thanks for the lift Clint." I say as we climb out of the car. "See you later." The archer speeds off leaving us in the dust literally seconds before the bell rings. The day drags for hours, with lunch seeming like 5 minutes. We all meet up after school at my locker as usual. Ned has to go home today but luckily for me, MJ can stay the whole week.
"I can see that. Hand me the scissors." I so as he says, slightly scared of what he's going to do with them. He says nothing more as he drags me through to his and Papa's room, sitting me down at the humorously large dressing table. He brushes his fingers through my hair again, mumbling incoherent words under his breath.
"Hydra." Everything seems to freeze as soon as that word leaves my mouth. The arms tighten around me and the air becomes thick. Tony is the first one to snap out of it.
"Buckle up. You'll get me shot else." I salute her as I pull the seat belt over my body, clicking it into place. The car is filled with silence, Lily-Anne's eyes trained on the road and mine out of the window.
"Clint you've had a long day, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up." The archer tries to lift the hammer but fails.
"Yes please." I roll my eyes but hand my mother the phone no less, shaking my head when she starts asking frantic questions. A knock on the door distracts me from the bride.
As soon as the children are set loose, MJ gets dragged off to play barbies with some of the girls which she looks so happy about. I just circulate for a while, watching the boys play football outside, watching a group of kids play a board game, some being a little more vocal that others and my gaze finally lands on a small form in the far corner. I slowly approach the figure, squatting in front of them.
Not 5 minutes later, everyone is sat on the two large sofas that are in the living room, watching the skilled archer as he paces.
"Hey kid. Hey look at me." He put his finger under my chin to lift it up when I start to look at the ground. "There's those beautiful eyes." We both laugh through our tears. He reaches up slowly to pull the beanie off of my head, grabbing the scrunchie that Wanda was offering to him. He runs his fingers through my hair and pulls it back, securing it with the elastic and places the hat over the top so only my unkempt bangs were hanging out of the front. He grabs both of our hands and positions us in front of a mirror on the other side of the wall, standing behind us.
"Lila shoved something up her nose. Nothing out of the ordinary. She's fine." We start the hour trek to our Aunt's house but it's not long before a very familiar car pulls over next to us.
"We have a field trip coming up shortly." She was cut off by the animated chatter bouncing around the room.
"Everyone, Morgan has something to say, go on kid." He passes the small girl the mic and she smiles up at him gratefully.
"Oh прекрасный." Nat says quietly as she holds my hair out of my face, rubbing circles on my back. Once finished, I flush the toilet and lean against the redhead, who places a wet washcloth to my clammy forehead, curtesy of Clint.
I finish up the song and Steve instantly starts clapping. I giggle slightly at him, shoving his knee.
'Shit. Shit. Shit. Oh my God. I can't. Why? 6 months down the fucking drain. What will Dad say? Oh God.' Thoughts spin around my head as I feel bile rise in my throat. 'No. Not now.'
"Hello Tyler." Her voice was light. Almost as if she was scared that if she spoke any louder, she'd break me. I stare at her for a few moments, trying to work out if she is being sincere or is just messing with me. I decide it's the first one as I give her a little wave.
As soon as we step into the living area, I feel Steve's worrying gaze. I shoot him a quick smile but it doesn't reach my eyes. And he can tell. Peter is by my side instantly, asking if I'm okay and checking me over. I manage to convince him I was fine as I finally notice the two other people sitting on the sofa along with my new father. One was a man with light brown hair. He reminded me of Tony with the way he held himself. He looked pretty smart. And next to him sat a woman. Her fiery red hair pulled into a loose ponytail, one slim leg crossed over the other as she gave me a kind smile which I found myself happily returning.
"I could go for pizza." Tony says realising we won't. "What do you guys say?" I just nod as Pete says 'pizza's good' Steve claps his hands together making me jump slightly.
"Can I have some please?" I ask. He looks at me confused so I gesture to the coffee maker in his hand. Realisation spreads across his face and he nods his head.
"Nat, she's my daughter. What's wrong with her? Is she okay? Here Clint, let me hold her." He reaches over and grips my waist, trying to pull me off of my security blanket. I grip Clint's shirt tighter, screwing my eyes shut, shaking my head rapidly.
"So why don't we get the examination out of the way then we can chill out. It's about lunch time so we can always grab something to eat." All of the adults agree as me and Pete are unsure about the whole thing. We all head down to something called Med Bay which looks a little like a hospital room. Steve leads me over to one bed as Tony leads Pete to the other. Bruce comes over and hands me a gown to change into. I'm relieved to see itsit's not a normal hospital gown but it still has short sleeves. My head snaps to Tony, panic in my eyes. He smiles at me gently before mouthing 'it's okay'. Steve leaves my little cubical type thing as I change into the gown, pulling my jacket back on over the top, successfully covering my arms. The curtain is ripped back and a nervous looking Bruce enters, Tony following close behind him. The check upcheck-up was pretty normal. I tensed every time he tried to touch me but Tony continuously rubbed circles on my hand with his thumb; and before I knew it, it was over and I was changing back into my clothes. I get up off of the bed and make my way back up the stairs, where I was instructed to go by Steve, to find Natasha. I spot her on the sofa, flicking through channels on the TV. She hears me enter and her head snaps in my direction, a smile playing on her lips.
"Ty, chill. First off, you've got me and Wade. Second, Nat will never let anything happen, she told you that herself. And if you come out to them, I will as well." Pete grabs my hand, forcing me to sit next to him on the bed.
"We met your sister earlier and she told us about you so we wanted to come and talk. I'm Tyler and this is my wife MJ, we're here to adopt. Can we come in?" She says nothing but steps out of the doorway, pushing it open wide enough for us to step inside. Everything looks the same. Same walls, same units, same bed. I suppose nothing ever does change around here. Blake sits on the bed and Lexie climbs on next to her, MJ opts for the desk chair and I sit on the floor, leaning up against my wife's legs.
"No can do little lady. We're watching the rest of this one then you're going to bed." My shoulders drop but I don't complain, knowing that it'll get me nowhere. The movie soon finishes and Mom leads me up to the room I'll be staying in when I'm there. Pretty plain, not half the size of my room at the tower but it's nice. She throws me some of her pyjamas and tucks me into bed like she used to do when I was Brooklyn's age.
"In here Tony." He says, trying not to hurt my head any more than it already was. The door creaks open slowly and Tony gasps at the sight. I mean why wouldn't he? There's a 15-year-old boy sat in the middle of a room with a 14-year-old clinging to him like a baby koala, red stains on the latter's hands and shirt sleeves, shaking and sobbing. As if his parenting instincts kick in, the older brunette kneels down beside me, brushing my hair away from my sweaty forehead, slowly gripping my waist and puling me off of my brother and onto him. I don't complain as I sob onto his chest. I feel it rumbling as he speaks to Peter but I pay no attention. He soon sets to work of calming me down. Taking a page out of Peter's book, he starts rubbing circles on my back, humming gently. I feel like a child laying in my father's arms. Oh wait. As my breathing begins to even out, he moves me so I'm sat facing him, my hands in his as he gives me a smile of encouragement. When I finally calm, I fall backwards, laying on the floor, savouring the sweet breaths that were now entering my lungs. Tony grabs my forearms and pulls me back up into a sitting position and I let out a cry of pain. He freezes and takes his hands away from my arms, grabbing my hand instead. His chocolate brown eyes lock with my deep sea blue ones as he starts to slowly pull up the sleeve, almost scared of what waits underneath. He pushes it all the way to my elbow and just stares at it. Before I can fully register it, he pulls me into his arms, locking me in a bear hug. The shoulder of my shirt becomes damp with his tears and I feel my own start sliding down my cheeks. We stay like this for a while until he leans back. He cups my face in his hands, tears still shone in his bloodshot eyes.
"Tyler. What are you still doing up?" She asks, walking over to me but deciding against touching me when she sees how aggressive I'm being with the punch bag. I let everything go. I let all my pent-up frustration out, screaming, tears streaming down my face as I punch and kick. Repeating it over and over again until one insanely hard kick sends the bag flying, taking the clip that once was attached to the ceiling with it. And that was the final straw. I crumple down to the mat my hand over my mouth, muffling my sobs.
"No. I'm sorry. You're right. I wasn't there. But I will be form now on okay. I promise." I nod and rest my head on her shoulder feeling two more pairs of arms wrap around us.
"What if they decide that they don't love me anymore? What if they kick me out? Where will I go?" All these questions were whirling around my head. There was no escape.
"Then with the power invested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride." Dad spins mom before dipping her into a kiss. Everyone is cheering the newly wedded couple as they run back down the aisle, everyone else following. The 4 of us clamber into an old time 50's car with a banner that said 'Just Married' on the back. Off to the reception we go.
"Clint, give me your tie." Clint doesn't hesitate pulling off the piece of fabric and handing it over to the billionaire. Tony places the tie around Peter's neck and fastens it tight, sorting out his collar.
"Nothing babe. Let's go dance." I pull her onto the dance floor and begin to sway to whatever the song choice was.
"Suck a dick old man!" I storm to my bedroom, slamming the door behind me. 'Argh. Can't they just leave me alone?' I collapse onto my bed, burying my face into the pillow. There's a light knock at my door.
"As you wish Tyler. Mr Stark and Mr Rogers are in the kitchen with Master Parker and are requesting that you join them." I let out an internal groan as I walk over to my bags that lay on the floor. 'When the hell did these get here?' I shrug. 'Maybe Steve brought them up.'
"I'm fine." I say standing up. "I've had worse." I lock eyes with the assassin as I say this. She smiles sadly at me but I just brush it off. Thor comes over to me, outstretching his hand.
"Good eye Jarv." I reach into the wardrobe and pull out a pair of white jeans and a black button down.
"This needs changing." He whispers, more to himself than to me. I take a seat on the bed as he goes to fetch the first aid kit, cursing under his breath when he sees there are no more bandages.
"I told you to wake up and when I tell you to do things, you do them. Okay, brat?" She snarls, looking me up and down. I nod my head as much as I can and the woman let's go, making me drop to the floor with a thud and grab my hair, smoothing it out and checking for blood. Conrad turns to leave.
"This can be your room in the future if you'd like." She says, looking at me over her shoulder, her hand resting on the door knob.
"Yeah well, I had to learn to fight for myself. Maybe you could train me a little." My voice was hopeful. 'I'd love that.' His thick arm wraps around my dainty shoulder.
"Okay everyone, time for the married couples first dance." The DJ announces before playing Man like me by Robert Downey Jr I turn her delicately in time with the melody as other join us. the song finishes and everyone claps.
"Two pancakes all around. Then school. You guys are going to be late else." All 4 of us groan with distain. We're all in senior year now with only a few months before finals. It's pointless anyway, when you work with Tony Stark himself, the level that they give us to work at is child's play. But one look at the assassin's face had us all shutting up.
"Of course Tyler, I didn't just come all this way to see your parents, I wanted to see my nephew and niece as well. It has been to long. Please hop in, I'll give you a lift." The three of us get into the car, Peter in the passenger seat with me and MJ in the back, our interlocked hands resting on the middle seat. Loki notices and raises an eyebrow at me through the rear view mirror. I feel my cheeks heat up as the blood runs to my face.
"Damn. Pete. You're really going to struggle with that aren't you?" He gasps mockheyyyyyyy offendedly and smacks me round the back of the head. Steve gives us a look that says behave so we stop instantly.
"Ah yes well, my brother has been quite stupid as of late. I'm actually here to apologise to the newlyweds. Where are they?" He asks, looking around.
Nat then pushes Clint off of the sofa and starts to sing Flynn Rider's part. Clint stands next to me sulking.
"It's not dad you're going to have to worry about killing you in your sleep." I joke as he steps off the stage. He blows a kiss towards me.
"Tyler can I talk to you?" The ex-assassin asks, barely keeping the urgency out of his voice. Steve raises an eyebrow but I just brush it off, gesturing for the brunette to follow me. We reach my room and he shuts the door behind him.
"What time will you be back tonight?" Pete asks. I shrug. Wade kisses me on the cheek as I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket.
"Actually it's Spider-Man and Shadow Knight. And umm, we're not. I mean we-" Steve raises his hand to cut off my rambling.
"Shh Tyler, it's okay. It's just me. I'm taking you to bed. Don't worry. Go back to sleep." Tony's voice fills my ears, putting me at ease as I relax into his touch. He enters my room and lays me down on the bed, pulling my comforter up to my neck. I feels his lips on my forehead making me smile inside. He moves away.
"It's a surprise. Now grab a slip it needs to be returned by Wednesday as the trip is on Friday." Everyone grabs a letter. Pete grabs two and shoves them into his bag, giving me a thumbs up.
"You're going to be fine Tyler. You're smart. Nothing to worry about." Mom reassures me, running her fingers through her red hair.
Tony teases Peter the whole way to the gym. Steve just looks embarrassed at how his husband is acting. The pair of us exchange glances, having a silent conversation. I jerk my head forward slightly and he nods. We start to jog, picking up speed to get away from the bickering children. We continue at a moderate pace and Captain looks impressed that I can keep up with him. Before we can start a real race, we arrive at the gym, seeing that it is occupied by a few of the Avengers. Steve gives me a pat on the back and walks over to who I think is called Clint? Hawkeye? I don't know and quite frankly, I don't particularly care. I decide to do what every socially challenged teenage does in this situation. Put my headphones in, play music full blast and step on the treadmill. The song Rockstar by Nickelback comes on as the platform speeds up to a run. I don't stop as the song changes to bassline junkie, or when it goes through the whole welcome to the black parade album. No. I don't stop when I can feel the breath start to burn through my lungs. No I don't. stopping is for the weak.
"Do you want us to sign parental rights over to Clint and Natasha? Is that it?" This shocks me. I lift my head up.
"Yeah. I'm sure I'll be fine, just overthinking is my unofficial middle name." I joke earning a chuckle from him.
"I wanted to see you before. I'm sorry I can't be there." He waits until I've got everything covered before touching me. He places one hand on my cheek and the other resting on my hip. I smile up at him, placing my head on his chest.
"Safe? Safe. Okay. Let's talk about that for a moment." He begins to yell and Natasha holds me tighter. I make eye contact with Clint and he walks over to us, crouching in front of me and placing a hand on my knee.
"No I want to. I really want to. I've had it written for a bout 6 months. It's just I'm nervous that it's going to go wrong and I'm going to slip up again." I knew it was quite unlikely. The last time I slipped up was 4 months ago.
"What the hell was that for?" I ask, opening the cap and taking a sip. The brunette shrugs and passes me a full plate, I take it hesitantly, slightly scared. What the hell? Me? Scared? Of a plate of fucking food? What is wrong with me?
This whole chapter is a big trigger warning. If you are triggered by mentions of self harm and stuff please skip the first half of the chapter
"Oh God, I think he's gonna blow." I joke, hiding behind dad. Everyone laughs and we start to head out the car, the three of us jumping in whilst Dad gives Happy a thousand and one instructions.
"They need to see what they're doing to you little bird. You can't carry on like this. And if Tony and Steve don't get their act together, your mom isn't the only one they'll be fighting in court." I feel paralyzed. He continues to pull me along as his words sink in.
"No. No darling you're not there, you're here with us. open your eyes and tell us what you can see, прекрасный." I open my eyes to see both assassin's staring at me in concern.
"Underoo's. Go nuts. Stay safe. Call us if you need us and be back by 4. We're going out tonight." Pete lets out a very unmanly squeal as he hugs both men, saying his thank you's before rushing to get his new suit. The men in the room turn to look at me and I sway back and forth between the balls and heels of my feet. I clap my hands and crack my knuckles.
One by one, they start to appear, sitting in the chairs in front of the students. There was Iron man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Vision. All the questions were pretty generic.
"None of your fucking business." I reply, standing up from the table. The avengers look at each other, awkward expression on their faces. Tony looks livid.
"Babe, chill, we've got plenty of time and if it's anything like I remember it, it doesn't particularly run on clockwork." She shakes her head and connects her lips to mine.
"Just memories you know. I remembered the time I first ran like that. It wasn't a nice experience." She looked at me sympathetically.
"Not yet. I'm going to tell them on our adopt-aiversary. That's what they're calling the day they adopted us. It'll be a year in a few months and they want us to make speeches so." She just stares at me for a moment before snapping out of it.
"Okay but we need to ask her first." I nod and we make our way over to the small girl who was still colouring.
"Just Tyler please Jarvis. Miss Quinzel was my mother and the least I have to do with her the better." I finish with a small smile, climbing out of the warmth of my bed. Only then did I realise I was still in my clothes from yesterday.
"Miss Tyler, Miss Romanoff will be here to collect you in 15 minutes, you need to wake up." I bolt upright at the AI's voice and check my bedside clock; 3:45.
"Umm, mine is hard. To tell and to understand so please, bear with me." I disclose, both of them nod and I begin telling my story.
"I love you too." I close his door behind me and make a beeline for my own, jumping into the shower without a second thought.
As soon as we arrive back at the house, I attempt to escape up the stairs in order to avoid the confrontation by my parents but it doesn't work.
"Whoever be worthy shall haveth the power!! Come on man it's a trick." I laugh at the archers impression of the God of thunder.
"Bucky?" My voice is soft, not very loud. He doesn't shift, only continues whimpering and squirming in his sleep. I move closer to him, resting my hand on his shoulder.
"Ms Stark, we need you to look over these plans and set a date for a press conference about the new line of prosthetic limbs that Stark Industries are now creating. Oh and-"
"Let's start off easy okay? With the whole names thing; we'd be more than happy if you called us dad and papa, Pete already does and we're never going to leave okay? So you can get that worry off your little brain." Tony grabs my hand that is now resting on the table and Steve wraps his arm around my shoulders once again.
"Umm, it's going to sound stupid but I'm a sucker for Disney movies and musicals, stuff like that. I love cookie dough ice cream and Haribo's. Umm, I think that's about it." She nods along with my words and then her phone buzzes from her back pocket. She pulls it out and frowns instantly.
"Did somebody say pancakes?" He asks. "Morning мама паук." He kisses Nat on the cheek before taking a seat on the other side of MJ.
"So, uh, Nat told us. do you need anything?" I shake my head no and he nods in understanding. "We're going out for dinner so wear something nice yeah? This place is fancy." I groan when I hear this.
"Honey, I'm a super spy. What did you expect?" I say no more as I lift the cup to my lips, blowing on the steaming contents before taking a sip. The first sip of coffee in the morning is always the best, don't even try to argue. The room was filled with comfortable silence, the music being turned off by a semi angry Black Widow, who was making coffee for herself and her husband, and Clint was watching over the waffles carefully, as if they'd burn totally if he turned away for just one second. Not before long, all three of us were sat around the circular table, filling our plates up with various toppings, Clint drowning his waffles in syrup whereas me and Nat opt for fruit instead. To say the food was nice would be the understatement of the century. Katniss really did know how to cook. Once I finished, I get up to rinse off my plate. Nat follows suit, taking it out of my hand and putting it into the dishwasher.
"I'm coming Jesus. Keep your hair on grandpa!" I place the black beanie on my head, pulling it down over my ears, keeping my hair in place. I give myself a once over in the mirror. The white shirt hugged my body but not in a slutty way. I actually looked decent for once. I sit on the edge of my bed to pull on my shoes as my bedroom door swings open. Dad looks at me, an exasperated sigh leaving his lips. I raise an eyebrow.
"And for the last hour, we have a Meet and Greet with the Avengers so please, take a seat." Once again, they all race to be at the front whereas we claim the small cluster in the far corner.
"Nat!" I yell as I jump. She catches me in her arms and spins me around before placing me softly on my feet.
"Believe me, we do. And you know it's illegal to deny any child the chance of getting adopted or fostered don't you?" I ask, my head tilting sideways innocently, Lexie clinging onto MJ's side, watching with wide eyes. Conrad glares at me for a moment before seemingly backing down.
"Go on, it's your room. Open it." She pushes the door open carefully gasping at the interior. It's blue walls accompanied by white furniture, twin bed with two matching bedside tables, a desk with art stuff and a new laptop and Stark phone on it. There's a wall length book shelf filled with different genres and age groups.
"I can't tell them. I don't. I don't know what to do Wanda." She says nothing and just holds me as I cry, shushing me softly.
The reception looked expensive and classy. It's Tony Stark's wedding, what do you expect. We were sat on the head table along with Rhodey and Sam. All the Avengers, minus Steve and Bucky, were on the one next to us and other guest dotted about around the spacious area. Dad hits his spoon on his glass to get everyone's attention.
"Glad you like it. Now go check out your rooms." I grab Peter's hand and drag him through the front door. Looking at the detailed interior with awe.
"Pep, you're the love of my life, I was too blind to see it before but it was always you, never Steve but you. I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have my, our, kids if it wasn't for you. So will you do me the honour of being my wife, putting up with me everyday, but more importantly, will you do me the honour of being my kids mom?" Me and Pete hold on to each other in anticipation.
"Well level 1 is for guests like yourself. Level 2 is for press and higher up visitors. 3 is for janitors and cooks. 4 is for low level interns. 5 is for higher level interns. 6 is for the Avengers visitors that aren't here that often like Princess Shuri and Antman's daughter. Level 7 is for the Avengers and level 8 is strictly for Mr and Mr Stark-Rogers, Miss Potts and 2 other unidentified people. I have a level 5 pass so I'm only allowed into certain labs and floors." Arron hands everyone a badge only to find that he is 5 short.
"Oh, прекрасный. What's wrong?" I feel her arms wrap around my shoulders and I sob onto her, my tears soaking her shirt though she didn't really seem to mind as she just ran her fingers through my greasy, knotted hair and hummed a soothing lullaby, calming me enough to talk. I take a deep breath.
"You did." He answers, moving to stand next to me. "But no matter what he's done to me or how stupid he's being right now, he's your Papa. He's always going to love you and you him. Nothing is going to change that." I smile up at my dad.
"Breakfast is in 10. And you're all going to be late for school if you don't hurry up." That woke us up. Of course. The spring break ended today. It's Monday. Fucking Monday.
"Yup. We just need to pick MJ up on the way then we can hit the road." I explain readjusting my bag on my shoulder.
"Oh, so that's what you think of me is it? That's what you think of your best friend." Steve looked shocked.
"Now, I don't really know what kind of chocolate or movies you like so I just raided my floor and I'm going to send Clint shopping so, what do you want?" I stand there gobsmacked. No one has ever even giving me anything because of it. I peer inside of the bag to see a collection of chocolate bars, ice cream and brownies. Along with the notebook, titanic and dumb and dumber. I look up at the woman standing in front of me. I throw myself into her arms.
"I better make it good then haven't I?" A cheeky grin spreads across her face. "Come on. Hot topic is waiting."
"Excuse me Miss, but may I request that you look in the wardrobe." I give the walls a questioning glance as I pull open the doors.
"Miss Quinzel, that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. One more strike and I'm calling home. I stand up.
"Yeah, right here, straight on then a left to the gate." I answer mot shifting my gaze. Peter follows my instructions and soon enough we're pulling up in front of the huge gate. I lean out of the window and place my thumb onto the scanner, allowing the AI to recognise it.
"Well I hope you like pancakes." Tony says, turning back around to make another cup of coffee. I get up and walk over to him.
"I missed you too Mama. But. Those guys over there." I peek over my shoulder to see them all still catting excitedly, probably making plans about the party later.
"You are going to be the death of me Tyler-Kai." I beam at her and waltz over to my fathers side, glancing over his shoulder at the hologram he was looking at.
We shop for a few hours buying clothes, pillows, decorations for my room. Anything I could ever need. Right now, we're sat in the food court, eating McDonald's.
"We'll go through rules and all that later but for now, let's go so you can see your rooms." I feel myself being picked up from behind and I tense. Looking around in horror, my chest becoming tight. I get placed back on my feet and Peter stands in front of me.
"As much as I would love to stay the night, I can't. I've got school in the morning and then I've got a visit." Both of them let out a pained hiss of air. "Yeah."
"Pepperoni." I answer simply. He nods his head and dials the number. Speaking in an important sounding voice, he orders two large pepperoni pizza's, one meat feast and one margarita. I open my mouth to argue and tell him that I don't want one but he just presses a finger to his lips, sending me silent. He thanks the person on the other end of the line and ends the call. He turns to me with a smile and I smile back. We keep the conversation light until there is a knock on the penthouse door. Steve sends me to retrieve the others and wash my hands. I go and tell them that dinner is here and Tony leads us into thellmmm bathroom where we can clean up. I wash my hands carefully, trying not to spill any water and feel insanely proud of myself when I realise I didn't. Me and Pete chat excitedly about some of the improvements Tony had made to his web fluid as we walk through to the kitchen. Plopping ourselves down at the island where the plates and pizza boxes lie. With the go ahead from Steve, both brunettes started piling up their plates and scoffing down the slices. I make a disgusted face at Peter and he lets a muffled 'what?' out through his full mouth. The other blonde sits opposite me a single slice on his green plastic plate, he places it down after taking a bite, chewing and swallowing before looking pointedly at me.
"You. I thought you were hurt. You're not supposed to leave without telling your boyfriend. I snuck into your room at the orphanage only to be told you'd been adopted. You can't do that to me Ty." He says, his hands in my hair. I rest mine on his cheeks, placing my lips on his.
After about an hour and a half, all of the presents that had been magicked up practically out of nowhere were opened. I got a shit ton of clothes and makeup, curtesy of Wanda and Natasha, some new art supplies , a bunch of science books, an electric guitar and an amp, a bow and arrow, some throwing knives, a tiara, a new laptop and a necklace from the God of mischief himself.
"Sirs there is somebody that claims they know you and that they are invited to eat with you, shall I show them in." if it was even possible, Steve's grin grows in size. He waves his hand as if to tell them to come in and the gentleman open the door for the stranger to walk through. He was tall, around Steve's height, with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, steely blue eyes looking over at us, his obvious muscles straining against his dress shirt. And his hands, one flesh and one metal held small what seemed to be gift bags. The super soldier stands to greet our guest, wrapping him up in a hug.
"Nat, we've been together for just over a year. He's done nothing to hurt me. He is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Just give him a chance. Please." She groans.
"Good, now go get some sleep. You've got a big day tomorrow." I throw my arms around the older man's shoulders and hug him tightly.
"Umm. Narnia?" I ask sarcastically. Peter facepalms and the owner takes large strides towards me, holding her fist up in a threatening manner. I stay strong, acting like I'm not scared. Am I scared? Heck yeah. The woman terrifies me but I don't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing that. As she reaches me, she grabs hold of my already bruised shoulders, making me hiss out in pain, in her iron grip and begins to shake me violently, daring me to be cheeky to her now. She finally stops shaking me and pushes me up against the wall instead, holding me by my throat. I couldn't breathe. I was gasping for breath but she wasn't letting go. She kept taunting me. Saying things about my mother that I never wanted to hear. I was running out of air. Black spots were clouding my vision and-
"Without that, without everything that happened to me, I never would've met them. And I think that disobeying Conrad's orders was one of the best thing I ever did." She smiles at me with pity before nodding to the now silent Avengers.
"Steve and Tony think it would be good for you to spend a weekend with me every month or so. That way, you've got a female role model. I'm basically a part time mom if you think about it, except I don't have a list of rules and I'm fun." I chuckle when she brings up the rules. It would be nice to have a 'mom' figure in my life.
The party wraps up a little after midnight, with everyone apart form the Avengers leaving. We all gather around in the common floors living room, Thor's hammer perched on the table.
"After everything that you've done, you think you can hug me? News flash Rogers. I'm not a Rogers anymore." The heartbroken look on his face almost makes me feel bad. Almost. I turn to his partner.
"Tyler? Kid, can you look at me please?" Tony's voice was soft and loving. I gulped before lifting my head up, glancing slightly towards them. Tony smiles at me. I move my eyes towards Steve and see him standing there, tears in his eyes. I slowly let my grip of Peter's arms relax and I turn around fully to face the adults. The brunette opens his arms, inviting me into them and I do just that. I collapse into his embrace and just like before, I feel the other two joining in. We break up the hug once again but Steve doesn't let go of me. He keeps his arm firmly around me the whole time which I wasn't particularly complaining about. We walk up a few stairs and come to two doors next to each other. One is red and the other one is back. I study the red door in front of me, it has patterns on it and towards the top, it held a black letter P. the black door was the same only this time it had a letter T in red writing on the top. I tilt my head to look at Steve quizzingly, he chuckles.
"Morguna? You in there? It's lunch time." A child with long, brown hair and a small stature comes crawling out of the tent holding out her palm with a tiny, homemade iron man glove.
"But seriously guys, I wish you the best of luck and you best make me an uncle soon. I think I'd be pretty good at that. Thank you." He steps away and the Avengers (Tony, Bruce, Clint, Natasha, Thor, Bucky, Loki) step up, grabbing a mic each.
"Hey Ty, Guess what? Mr Stark managed to fix NMJ. We'd just added the circuits wrong and..." he continues talking but I can't really say I'm listening, I'm too busy watching Tony and Steve have a 'quiet conversation' in the back corner of the room. As Peter's story finishes, the two adults walk over, smiles on both of their faces.
