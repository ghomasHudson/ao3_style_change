“Morning, Molly,” he says, and opening the gate, lets himself in beside her, leaning over her shoulder to unhook his apron from the wall. He’s unable to stop the snort that escapes him when he catches sight of the coffee. “That’s a dick.”
He's cut off by John hauling him up by the lapels, eerily reminiscent of how he'd held Mycroft, and Sherlock blinks, finding himself plastered along John's front from chest to hips to knees.
Molly opens her mouth as soon as he’s behind the counter, looking like she can’t decide whether to thank or tease him.
Sherlock’s heart (metaphorically) skipped a beat. He blinked; there was a brief sensation of freefall, and he had no idea what was waiting for him at the bottom. “Dinner as in – dinner, or –?”
“Worried?” Sherlock’s brow creases now, in what is unmistakably, worry. “You were worried,” he says slowly, as if tasting the words on his tongue. “Worried,” he says again, “About me?”
” Mariah Carey’s voice warbles from the radio perched high on the shelf, next to the syrup sweetener. “
On the floor, Sherlock hunches further in on himself, face buried in his knees. “When will it stop?” he says, voice muffled and pained, the
John opens the fridge, reaching for the milk. “Yeah, some Hollywood director got wind of us and decided to make a film out of it. Something about Victorian London and risen ghost corp –
He strides over to the kitchen table and upends the contents of the milk carton over the surface. Frozen, dismembered toes scatter over the tabletop. One of them comes dangerously close to a Petri dish and Sherlock squawks, rescuing the culture before it gets contaminated by the toes.
Sherlock goes without complaint, and the two sit there, Sherlock’s tears soaking Mycroft’s dress shirt and neither of them saying a word about it.
Holmes and Watson settle in for a night of ghost-baiting, and John finds himself leaning forward slightly in his seat, because it’s a suspenseful moment and he doesn’t want to miss the moment the ghost appears.
He hears an agonised shout from far, far away, as a choir of angels serenade him. John frowns; one of the angels has picked up a deadly looking harp, and is holding it like a crossbow, aiming it at Sherlock’s back.
Molly shoots him a weird look on her way back, but John tilts his head conspiratorially towards the corner table, and with a roll of her eyes Molly returns to the counter and leaves him to it.
“Morning, Sherlock,” he says in greeting, reaching over the detective’s shoulder to get at the salt on the countertop.
“Hacked his phone and got into his messages,” Sherlock says, in the off-hand manner one usually associates with commentary on the weather. “He’s meeting his supplier and, if I’m not mistaken, our murderer.”
," John says quietly, only the slightest tremour in his right hand betraying his anger, "It's that there's never a good reason to send a good man to his death, and in my book, that makes you as bad as the enemy."
(In his mind’s eye he sees himself standing across the road, looking up at St. Bart’s and seeing John perched on the rooftop, arms outstretched and ready to fall.)
John comes back down and a few moments later is stood in front of Sherlock. “Tea?” John offers, proffering the entire pot.
“Don’t hit me,” he tells John, before reaching out and tugging on John’s wrist, harder than is strictly necessary, so he over-balances and falls, bearing Sherlock to the floor in the process.
Sherlock opens his mouth to reply, but John chooses this moment to stir, eyes opening blearily before he assesses the situation - the gun at his temple, Sherlock on the table, Smith with a knife in hand - and his instincts kick in. He moves quickly, but Mary's faster. He barely unbalances her with a sweep of his leg at her feet before she recovers, this time digging the barrel of the gun into the tender underside of his jaw and her other hand clamping down on the nape of his neck.
,” Sherlock said, aware he wasn’t making sense and not caring in the slightest. He tugged John closer, tilting his head down until his lips found John’s.
He pauses at the sound of chairs being scraped back abruptly; a glance up shows both Sherlock and Lestrade on their feet, each hurriedly throwing on their jackets (well, windbreaker for Lestrade and a dramatic, billowing bat-cape for Sherlock).
There was nothing the king could do to make up for what he had done. He didn’t say anything more, and neither did Sherlock. The silence was awkward, but it could not be helped. Hopefully, the excitement of this new city would take Sherlock’s attention away from the selfish king and make him forget John’s imprudent confession.
The sound of the storage room door opening could be heard, but Sherlock did not turn that way. He had no wish to speak to anyone. He hoped that if he kept working and said nothing, his employer would be satisfied and leave.
It was awfully, ruthlessly unfair. John could hardly control himself when his servant was so happy and beautiful.
Sherlock was deeply stirred by John’s warmth. Without thinking, his hands fell away from John’s body, instead rising to wrap around the man in turn. He needed to hold onto John.
Sherlock followed the king’s attention upward. The sky was not yet full of stars, but there were enough to admire. To Sherlock, those distant lights seemed to glitter more when the king was looking at them. “Yes, sir,” the servant answered.
It would have been plain to anyone that the conversation was getting pretty emotional, but they didn’t ask me to leave, and I felt I had to make sure it all worked out if I could.
Then John bowed, filling his master with a host of indecipherable feelings, and left him, into the castle where apparently Lestrade was hidden. It occurred to William that he could follow John to discover where the elusive priest had gone. That step was unnecessary, though. John was a reliable attendant who would take care of his master’s request.
“Um, thank you,” John mumbled, not knowing what to say but needing to say something to the man he had thought he knew. Kneeling by the bath, he reached forward and began to sponge the king’s back. He couldn’t believe he was touching Sherlock, his incredible Sherlock… “You are really King William?”
The king’s smile grew wider. He looked so happy and handsome that he was almost difficult to look at. “No, thank you, Sherlock.”
“Um, well, if that’s all, then?” John had been so determined to give all his love to Sherlock, but now John, not wishing to overstay his welcome, didn’t know whether he should stay or return to his own bed. “I suppose I’ll go.”
A pink hue glowed in Sherlock’s cheeks, accentuating the fairness of his skin. To John, who had seen many things in the world that others called beautiful, this servant was a living, breathing embodiment of beauty.
“Well, sir, John told me you were looking for me today,” Lestrade began earnestly. The stark politeness of the hallway had given way to a much more personable priest. “To give me this cross—thank you, by the way, truly.”
“Could –” Sherlock’s voice is hoarse and breaks after the first word; he clears his throat. “Could John and I take a moment?”
“This is – good, John,” Sherlock murmurs now, locking half-lidded eyes on John’s as he dips his head lower, lips parting, and John is suddenly painfully aware of the fact that the counter is a thing that exists and is standing between him and what could very well be the shag of his
He reaches over to the adjacent table, secures two packets and proffers them to Sherlock, who takes them and then proceeds to just stare at his still sugar-less drink. It takes John a moment to realize the reason for his clients’ silence is most likely because he’d just gone and bloody drank about a third of his coffee. Bad form by anyone’s book, really. He’s just glad Mike’s not in today. (As a rule, Mike Stamford acts more like their friend and colleague than the café’s owner and manager, but when Mike gets ticked off, as he does on occasion, it’s not pretty.)
“Yes, I believe so.” He pushed John’s unopened menu pointedly towards him. “But you know Angelo. Always so happy clappy and trying to inflict it on the rest of the world.”
John can feel heat rising in his cheeks. He glances at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye; his friend’s face is flushed and his eyes are slightly glazed over as he stares, transfixed, at the Victorian version of John’s self interrogating him about his sex life.
“Well, since you’re the reason I could have died in a terribly undramatic fashion, I’m going to make up for lost time, and you’re going to
“Sherlock!” John calls from where he’s sat on the sofa, not taking his eyes off the telly screen. “Come watch this – it’s hilarious.”
Relief and disappointment flicker over John’s face, there and gone so quickly Sherlock almost misses them. John settles for chuckling, the amusement evident in his expression as he says, “It’s not.”
who’s done nothing but patronize him all night and who is still currently gazing intently out the window, the contours of his face backlit by the glow of a passing streetlamp – though something warm pools in the region of John’s chest as he watches the corners of Sherlock’s lips curve upwards at his answer, almost imperceptibly, but there nevertheless. John doesn’t have long to savour the moment, however.
Sherlock raises those pale, almost translucent eyes to his, lets them flicker down to John’s mouth, and John wonders what he’s thinking, wonders what those lips would feel like against his own. “No need, John. I – this – it’s fine.”
“Leave a note when?” John’s voice almost breaks and Sherlock’s resolve wavers, hand trembling where it’s outstretched to John, a distant figure on the ground far below.
“I was dead when you first started dating, then I came back and ruined your proposal – sorry about that, by the way. I thought I might as well make it easier and remove myself from the equation –”
“It’s just –” John says, suddenly overcome with a fit of giggles, “I don’t think I’ve heard anyone in real life use the term
John makes an abortive gesture with his free hand – it hovers over Sherlock’s knee before falling back to John’s side. “Yes, of course I know,” John says gently, squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder, “And I do for you.”
ing whenever John makes a typo and has to backspace. John is torn between rolling his eyes and asking Sherlock to just do it himself, and taking a step backwards into the welcoming warmth of Sherlock’s (admittedly scratchy) wool overcoat. Wanting to do the latter has nothing at all to do with the fact that this close, he can smell the heady cologne the other is wearing.
“Of – of course,” John says, taking the note. He gestures at Molly, who – bless her – has taken things in stride and is already measuring out the milk. “Here, lemme just,” he says, reaching back to rifle in their cash register for the correct amount of change.
Unbidden, something warm curled in Sherlock’s chest at the sight of his scarf on John. He realized his hand was still on John’s chest and hurriedly yanked it away.
She leaves much, much later, obviously reluctant to ever consider going out with John Watson again. (Or, indeed, going
John examines his minute reflection in the brass, and squints at the smear of bright red-green he can see trailing from his jacket. What on earth? He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his work apron – a seasonal one Mike had specially made for December, complete with tinsel trimming – and grimaces, hurriedly stuffing it back. He must’ve forgotten to hang it up before leaving the coffeehouse.
“Ugh,” John groans, dipping a finger into the jam jar next to the sconces on display in a neat, pyramidal fashion on the countertop and licking it off. (Jam, as he’s found on numerous occasions, is great for stress relief.) “Don’t start, Mol. Just bring him the latte, will you?”
He wonders why he ever thought watching their fictional lives transposed into an alternate Victorian setting would ever be a good idea. It’s hitting a bit too close to home, and neither he (nor Sherlock, judging from how far he’s sunken into their sofa) are comfortable with it. Maybe should just turn the telly off.
"Nope," John says, folding the note up and stuffing it in his back pocket. His conscience screams bloody murder at him, but his libido raises both middle fingers back and silences it. "Gotta dash, Greg, sorry. See you soon!"
All of a sudden John’s hand was on the small of his back, steadying him. Sherlock swatted half-heartedly at him. “I’m fine, hones’ly, John.”
pressure. Sherlock swallowed; this had to be the most difficult thing he’d ever attempted in his life, and he’d successfully taken down a criminal mastermind’s network. “
Besides him, Sherlock shifts so the back of his hand brushes John’s leg. John almost stops breathing, keeping his eyes trained on the screen as he inches infinitesimally closer.
There was a moment’s hesitation, during which Sherlock could hear John’s heartbeat, a relentless staccato hammering against his ribcage, and then John’s mouth was on his neck and Sherlock was in what would presumably be heaven, if he believed in that kind of thing. He tipped his head down and adjusted his coat just so that it covered John as well.
“I don’t do anything like that,” John said, with a grin. He had resumed touching Sherlock’s cheek, which Sherlock enjoyed very much. “Well, maybe I help bring out the best in you.”
Hearing that sentiment, John had to fight a blush. The noble figure sitting next to him was a kind man. “Why do you come here, Mr. Holmes, if you do not believe in God?”
He knows that a shameful secret is bothering me. I will need to come up with some story to hide my feelings for him. At least then, I can stay by his side, be his constant friend and companion, and, if the Lord is kind….
, John,” William grunted, and though it had always been known in the back of his mind, at that moment, John understood clearly that William could see the outline of the servant’s figure from behind his curtains, just as John could see William.
The pieces started to fall into place in John’s mind. He wondered, could this true? There were countless noblemen in the country, and many wood-carvers too. How could this be?
With a smirk, King John leaned back, and crossed his arms. It was an inexplicable joy for Sherlock to watch the muscles of King John’s arms move as they were crossed over his broad chest. “Do I look like I need a guard, Sherlock?”
I nodded sympathetically. “I see. With a super-old-fashioned bloke like Jeeves, I wouldn't know, either.”
Sitting again on the sofa, which felt inexplicably large and empty now, Sherlock wondered what their next destination of note would be, and if he would be able to spend more time with his compelling and fascinating master there. He saw King John take out a map, but Sherlock did not ask about it, as he did not wish to remind his master that he could not read.
I chuckled, and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He glowed with joy, and it was the best thing in the world to see.
“Oh, um.” Sherlock hadn’t meant to hum, and certainly not to share this silly thought with the king, but for better or worse, King John seemed to be interested in his thoughts. “I was only thinking that I should like to live as a horse.”
As distracted as he was, it took longer than it should have for the servant to undo the clasps of the king’s boots, which were admirably rugged and robust, just like their wearer. To make matters worse, the boots were distracting in their own right. They were very different from the pair Sherlock was wearing, which were worn with use and tied with cheap lace.
“Oh.” At the incredibly intriguing sight, hope filled Sherlock’s chest. Perhaps if King John was frustrated enough by his physical desires, he would settle for something less than he deserved. “A man’s needs, like you said before?”
Sherlock crossed his arms. Perhaps he should have known better than to be so hopeful about this family. He still hoped, however, that there was an explanation for the evidence Mycroft had left behind.
John was confused, yet only for an instant. The memory washed over his features. He was clearly moved. “The one I wrote for you when I came to the castle.”
He tried to figure out what might have upset King John. It was a difficult problem. King John had said the world could be lonely, but it was unfathomable that such a handsome and courteous king would ever be unable to find charming company.
“And the rest of the tournament, too? I know you were employed by the tournament, but I hope you enjoyed what you saw?”
It was there that John noticed a faint scar, on the forearm. He could tell that it was from a sword wound, and several years old. Father Lestrade had said something about King William serving in the war, hadn’t he? It was probably from that time, then. John himself had treated a soldier with an injury resembling this one, years ago. Carefully, knowing very well how such wounds could feel, John asked, “Is this area tender, sir?”
John sometimes wondered if this servant wasn’t too precious to be left alone with him. “I’ll do it for you, if that’s all right?”
Sherlock admired the tall, distant building, awed by the first true landmark on this adventure. There must be an incredible number of books, filled with wisdom on many different subjects, within that grand library. It astonished Sherlock to imagine all the secret knowledge that must be kept in such a place.
Again, John was too bashful to say anything about the garments, so Sherlock answered Lestrade. “John found clothing belonging to a lady—undergarments included—in my brother’s laundry. The evidence suggests that Mycroft is having an affair.”
Sherlock grinned, pleased with himself for surprising John. “It is true. Mycroft was, unfortunately, quite clear with me on the matter.”
He had relished the time he spent there with Sherlock, but this time, John wasn’t reminded of watching his servant dance amongst the bees and candles. No, at this moment, holding Sherlock close to him, with his dear servant so vulnerable in his arms, John was reminded of the ritual bed, the place where he’d first had Sherlock under him, where he’d claimed his servant against all his better judgment.
“You know, it was easy to see you in the crowd, though it was quite a job, finding you here. I wanted to see you again as soon as I could get away from the other nobles, but it seemed like you left as soon as I was done. I had to ask around to find you.”
Did one of your lackeys find me for you? I would think the government would have something better to do.
“My clothes are being prepared in the laundry.” The sponge was now in William’s hand, and John had sheepishly turned away. “Retrieve them for me after you have changed out of that thing you call a nightgown.”
Suddenly, Sherlock felt a light touch on his cheek. Shock knocked the air out of Sherlock’s chest. Was the king truly touching him? He was afraid to turn and find out, in case doing so would break the wonderful illusion.
“No, please, John, say it.” Sherlock returned to John’s arm and kissed along it in the most welcoming gentlemanly fashion he could. “My beloved, you could ask anything of me. I am yours.”
Like Sherlock, John was not particularly happy that the journey was almost finished. It had been a great pleasure to visit interesting places with Sherlock. John had seen it all before; despite that, he felt like he had seen it all for the first time.
A number of arrangements would have to be made. The pharaoh would have to commission his particular scroll privately, and make sure that nobody found out about Sherlock’s wish to blatantly defy sacred tradition. Furthermore, the necessary spells would have to be worked out, and that task alone would present a number of puzzles for him to solve.
After the sparring was done, John, along with some other members of their convoy, was shown some more rooms of the fortress, with Sherlock following. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock had many questions about why certain fortifications existed, and how the guards divided their tasks, and a number of other things. Luckily, John was able to answer most of Sherlock’s questions, though Sherlock was able to deduce some answers himself.
How could John forget when he had first seen the cute servant who would come to be his cherished maid? The question was so absurd that John chuckled.
Sometime during their tour, some nobles came by who wished to speak to King John. They had heard of his arrival, and wanted to discuss some important business about the region with him. The king agreed to speak with them. He arranged to meet his servant later, in the alehouse next door.
detective. I assist the public when they are in need of confidential assistance, and I also aid the police when they are out of their depth.
“I will return in the morning to see to any needs you may have,” Sherlock stated dutifully, wishing to any powers that would hear him that he truly could see to King John’s needs. If nothing else, he could look forward to serving his master as an obedient maid, who would clean this room as well as it had ever been cleaned. “Sleep well, sir,” he said sincerely, doing his best to keep most of the immoral fondness he felt for the king out of his words of parting.
There was only kindness in Sherlock’s voice. “My dear John.” Though he could hardly believe it, John felt long fingers calmly, slowly stroking his upper back. “Does William hold you with this much affection? Does he tell you how important it is that you exist?”
“No, I think you truly are magical. You use your magic on me, so that I can’t think of anything else but making you my own.” Once again, John gave Sherlock a light squeeze, which provoked another enchanting whimper. “If you’d let me, Sherlock, then tonight, I’d show you what you do to me. I’d use those chains to keep you still, so that you would be completely mine.”
King John was stunning on his horse, as Sherlock expected. The well-cleaned lance in his hand glinted like his armour, and his shield bore the dazzling visage of a proud lion on a red and gold background. Like the rider, his white horse was also armoured, and wore an ornamental cloth with the symbol of the lion.
“Oh.” John blinks; he hadn’t expected that. From the clang of plates hitting the sink too quickly, and from the hastily stifled gasp behind him, John gathers that neither had Molly. “Our pleasure, really, sir.”
“Oh, shut up,” John scowls, giving the card up as a lost cause. He turns his back resolutely to her and, selecting a knife, starts cutting bagels, his ire rising the more he thinks about the entire situation. “It
John cranes his neck to look inside the kettle. It’s conspicuously empty, although it does smell rather faintly of fish.
John’s fingers, when they check his wrist for a pulse, are steady, and Sherlock would be heartened if he didn’t know what state this means John will be in later. A litany of
He doesn’t know why he does this; it probably makes him a masochist of some sort, to go digging through his tortured emotions, to rub salt into the wound, as it were.
, Doctor Watson? I would have thought, after the years you spent in Kandahar saving people from this sort of thing, you wouldn't be quite so quick to-"
“Dinner?” was what John eventually settled on, a shy smile curling the edges of his lips as he glanced up at Sherlock.
“This,” Sherlock says, pointing rather extravagantly at the now-empty cappuccino sat on the table, “This is the best cappuccino I’ve ever had.”
It’s funny he should’ve said that, because just then the café door tinkles lightly and their regular steps in, only this time there’s something markedly different about him: he’s accompanied by someone else.
“What? Oh.” Molly stares forlornly at the botched design, which does, as it turns out, bear a rather striking resemblance to a penis. “I’ll probably have to chuck it now.”
John types as quickly as his cold hands will permit, not helped along by Sherlock, who literally stands next to him and breathes down his neck, huffing impatiently and
burning on his lips, but falls silent at the look on Sherlock’s face. He’s leaned back on the bench and is looking out over the river, at the London skyline, with a light in his eyes and it strikes John just how at peace Sherlock looks in this moment. Come to think of it, he’s never seen the man slow down for longer than strictly necessary, and to see him just sitting here, savouring the night, brings unbidden a smile of fondness to John’s face.
His lips twist into a faint, rueful smile. He doesn't think he'll mind terribly if this is the last thing he sees.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John murmured, scrolling down the myriad ways the blog advised its readers to confess. They were all terrible and clearly aimed at a readership of approximately 13-16 year old girls.
John raises his eyebrows. “A threat? Well, you can tell Lestrade not to worry because I’m not going to tell, and that he can shove that
“Of – of course,” Sherlock says, looking rather dazed as looks at John like he’s a rather interesting puzzle he’d like to solve. Then, visibly collecting himself, he clears his throat and says, “That
John remains standing, refusing to give. It looks as if it’s taking John all the willpower he has not to punch Sherlock in the face.
Mycroft opens his mouth to reply, but before he can do so the door bangs open and Mrs Hudson sweeps in, feather-duster in hand. The anger on her face shows she's heard the entire conversation.
“S-sorry?” she says, hand hovering uncertainly over the penis cappuccino. “Did you say you wanted –”
,” Hooper sneers at Watson on-screen, and John’s eyebrows shoot to his hairline. (Next to him, Sherlock discreetly clears his throat, keeping his eyes fixed pointedly on the telly.)
“No, no it’s not.” John surprises himself by saying this rather loudly (the cabbie glances back at him in the rearview mirror). “You – you invite me over, you don’t even stop to say how d’you do and you just – rush me out the door and now you’re dragging me halfway across the city to keep some prior engagement
“Oh, sir,” he moaned, even louder than when they had kissed, and louder still when the king guided his hips to stay in place, so that the king’s fingers could explore.
like Sherlock for love or money, but it seemed to work aright for John. Sherlock calmed down a trifle.
John watched Sherlock spin the handle of the cider press, which operated like a drill to slowly push a flat surface into the barrel. Sherlock started slowly at first, which was to be expected. He was a gentle individual, who only wished to learn about the world, not to damage it.
King John was standing before him. He no longer had plate armour. Instead, he was dressed in clothing like that of a knight resting from battle, and was flushed from his exertion in the tournament. His followers were gone. He was looking directly at Sherlock, with a concerned expression.
A musky, intoxicating scent that must have been trapped under royal clothes seemed to fill the caravan, filling Sherlock with a deep, powerful need to make that scent part of himself.
John felt that he could stand right where he was and admire his dear servant all day. “Did you enjoy it?”
The king followed Sherlock’s line of sight. “I know. It’s wicked of me to carry it. Even I don’t know if I’m sustained or tormented by the thoughts of you that it gives me.”
Under the devoted attention of his dear servant, John felt his end approaching quickly. It could not be prevented much longer when Sherlock started sucking on his master.
Conversation, music, darts, and nourishment all complemented each other like puzzle pieces, creating the perfect picture of camaraderie. This atmosphere of openness and friendship did its work, wearing down Jeeves’s uneasiness all through the evening. Gradually, his shoulders relaxed, his tone lightened, and his smiles became recognizable for what they were to people who had never met him.
“That was remarkable,” John mumbled, nerves electrified by the close proximity of the refined gentleman who was still holding on to his arm. Sherlock was always so intelligent and capable.
, John.” Sherlock sighed. “As ludicrous as it seems to me, I am a god. I can’t help it any more than you can help being human. Gods do one thing and humans do another. Gods go to one place, and humans go to another. Don’t you see, John? We won’t go to the same place after death. My place will be with the gods, and yours will be somewhere else.”
“Would you undress for me, Sherlock?” he asked, keeping his besotted voice stable with considerable effort.
“Yes, uh, right away.” Afraid of angering the man who was, after all, supporting his family, John quickly scurried past the beds and into the luxurious private bathroom, still in his sleeping gown. He had to see to the needs of his king first. John had never been in a home with piped-in water before, yet he had used public bathhouses like most common folk did, and the mechanisms were basically the same. He turned a small wheel and water poured from a tap into the ruler’s rather large bath. Undoubtedly, the water had already been prepared elsewhere.
“S-Sir,” Sherlock stammered in an endearing way, his gaze darting between John’s hand and face. “You mean…? Like what you did for me that one time, in the caravan?”
“I… I want this very much,” Sherlock said quickly, looking away. “I want to be held in place for you.” It was remarkable, how hearing these words from Sherlock made John’s body come alive. “Not just to serve you, sir. Ever since you mentioned it, I’ve been thinking about what it will be like, to be restrained under you… Sir, I might become injudicious…. I mean… I don’t know how to say this. I worry I’ll enjoy it too much, and I won’t be very considerate.”
“Pleasing you?” William asked, his voice low. He continued to kiss John’s neck, and to stroke him firmly. “Immensely.”
There was a sign on the building, with letters in combinations that Sherlock did not recognize. He peered uselessly at the words. Somehow, he hoped that he would be able to decipher the sign if he wanted to strongly enough. If he could do that, then he wouldn’t have to embarrass himself by asking his master. Unfortunately, his determination wasn’t enough for him to read the words.
It was a fact that the two of them had shared this bed before, and yet this time felt different. This was the night of their wedding. The ceremony had been a secret one, seen before the eyes of the divine and not before mortals. Regardless, being wedded to his beloved priest meant so much to Sherlock, and he hoped that it held meaning for John too.
The other man visibly relaxed. “I see,” he said, a new interest in his voice. He stood up, and approached John, appraising him effortlessly. “An apothecary… The son of one, rather, though you are an expert in your own right. You served in the war, no doubt.”
Indeed! You will see that he is a brilliant man. Clever, resourceful, and discreet, of course. He will solve your problem.
“Aye, but he is very busy, you know, running the country and all. He sends his regrets, but he will not be able to meet John this hour. I’m here to show John where he will be sleeping.”
John knew the protocol, but it hurt to be spoken to in such a manner by the friend who had been so kind to him before. He couldn’t bear the scornful glare facing him, so he lowered his head. “King… William.”
Of course. Neither Sherlock’s fire nor his company could be enough for the king. “Do you need help with anything, sir?”
Bertie went on a little more about Jeeves’s virtues, yet I was still stuck on what he had said. Considering his relatively young age, I hadn’t thought Bertie’s money was inherited. So Bertie had lost his parents at least, and maybe other relatives. I had also been left almost without family (and sometimes it seemed like I hardly knew my sister anymore), so I could relate to at least that aspect of his life. There was also the fact that Bertie was younger than me, which probably made it harder for him. I wondered how long he had been on his own, though I didn’t think it would be right to ask.
There was a question I’d wanted to ask Bertie for a long time, and now I couldn’t keep it in any longer: “What do you do for a living, anyway?”
John and his servant were allowed near the caravan at once, and given some privacy when the king demanded it. He was used to seeing a horse attached to it, but otherwise the royal caravan appeared as it had before.
Once the horse was fed and left under the supervision of others in the convoy, John left with Sherlock to explore. John led the way, though Sherlock was not far behind.
He wondered what Sherlock was anticipating. Probably it was something lovely, though nothing like the restrained tremors and impassioned cries that the king was guilty of imagining.
Sherlock frowns as a thought occurs to him. “Does that mean I could have bloody well died for nothing?”
Mrs Hudson and her gossipy friends," John says emphatically, straightening his shirt collar. (No wonder Mrs Hudson thought they were having a go at it, it's practically slipped off his shoulder.)
“Don’t –” Sherlock’s hand on his wrist stops him. John turns. His friend’s eyes are riveted on the screen; at where his Victorian counterpart has stopped fighting, has given up. Sherlock takes a deep breath, exhales shakily. “I need – to see this through.”
” Watson says, with a supreme air of confidence. John feels distinct pride at the thought that his talent and perceptive insight were acknowledged by the film’s writer.
“Sorry, must dash,” Sherlock says, sounding not in the least bit apologetic as he all but runs to the doors, Lestrade on his heels.
He's short, shorter than John even (unless his muddied mind's playing tricks on him), and in a tailored suit (D&G) and ridiculously round glasses. Sherlock makes a mental note to switch all his own suits to Armani.
Next to him, Sherlock fidgets on the sofa, then takes a large sip of the scalding tea and coughs. “That’s –
Then John grins up at him, rises on his toes and presses a kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock stops worrying about the drop he feels in the pit of his stomach because this – this isn’t falling.
” Moriarty groans, and the camera pans out to include his exasperated face. Holmes and Watson ignore his comment, too distracted as they are by the presence of the other’s tongue in their mouths.
Sherlock himself spent the same Christmas in a holding cell in Lebanon, hoping desperately that Mycroft would make some calls, pull some strings and get him out, and hating himself for even hoping.
Moments and a lifetime later, they break apart and Sherlock rests his forehead against John's. They're both breathless and John's starting to giggle.
“… the boss said we’ll have to get it to him by tomorrow night, latest. We’re handing off at Waterloo, I think,” the shorter of the two men said, not even bothering to lower his voice, clearing thinking that the two men making out by the tree posed no threat to them.
“I had a perfectly valid reason,” Sherlock argues, just for the sake of it, “It would have given you and Mary the closure you needed to start your new life of domestic bliss.”
) against John’s pulse-point like he has no idea how they got there. John swallows, hoping his traitorous heart isn’t tripping against his ribcage as quickly as he can feel it is.
is that supposed to mean?” he says to the room at large. He glances at Sherlock, who for some reason has sunk extremely low in his seat, almost as though he’s trying to melt into and become one with their sofa. “Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s answering smile is soft, and he looks at John like he sees the London skyline and more in his eyes. “I promise, John. And I always keep my promises.”
Lestrade groaned, banging his forehead against the window of his car. “God help me, now there’s two of them.”
“So, have you heard?” John asks later that night, after Ridley’s been apprehended and placed in a holding cell in Scotland Yard. “Apparently we’re in a film.”
,” John smirks. “Guess Mary and I are just great actors. I mean, we managed to fool even the great Sherlock Holmes.”
“My, my, you’re not doing a very good job at keeping a low profile, are you?” Mycroft said, with something resembling smug satisfaction.
John waits till the creak on the fifteenth stair is heard before he blows out a breath and some of the tension bleeds out of his shoulders. He sinks down into the recently vacated armchair, elbows on his knees as he stares at the floor.
“Don’t joke,” Sherlock says sharply, whipping round to glare at John. “Don’t – joke about that. It’s – incredibly distressing.”
The short man starts clapping, the sound reverberating around the room. Sherlock winces at the assault on his eardrums. He stalks closer to Sherlock's side, crouches so they're at eye-level. "The Six Thatchers," he says, his voice one of lilting mockery, "Or so Doctor Watson calls it on his blog. Do you remember?"
He took a sip from the mug of tea he was holding and gagged; he’d somehow managed to add salt instead of sugar. He turned and discreetly poured the drink down the drain. Next to him, Molly tutted, and decided to take pity on him.
” Watson is asking of Holmes now, as the pair pick their way over the craggy rocks, towards dry land.
It feels strangely like falling, Sherlock thinks, when they finally break apart. The same breathless exhilaration, the same rush of adrenaline. He wonders if he should brace himself, because the landing had hurt last time round.
John giggles, seems to realize now isn’t the best time, and hurriedly stifles it. He clears his throat. “He’ll – ehm – he’ll send you a text telling you how he solved it. Good afternoon.”
,” Watson says (his voice sounds choked), clearly thrown by the detective’s response. The camera zooms in until it’s just the two of them in shot, and the thundering break of the waterfall fades to a background hum, the soundtrack replaced instead by the faint strains of a violin playing.
She doesn't acknowledge him except to step closer, digging the barrel of the gun into John's temple as Sherlock watches, his heart plummeting and lodging itself behind his diaphragm at the sight.
There’s a faint glimmer of wetness in Sherlock’s eyes when he turns to face John, shifting until their knees knock together. The kiss, when it happens, is a simple press of dry, chapped lips against John’s, and a sweep of Sherlock’s tongue on his, a fleeting thing that’s gone in the second it takes John to process it.
John looked up from where he’d been staring blankly at the worn tabletop in front of him. His eyes were bloodshot and there was a minute tremour in his hand.
!" she screeches, and Sherlock half-rises from his perch on the sofa in concern because he's never seen her face quite so red, nor hear her voice quite so livid with fury. She strides up to where John and Mycroft are standing in tableau, staring at her transfixed, and starts batting Mycroft's arm with the duster. "Out of my house, you
Even if John hadn’t been guilty of lurking behind a coffee grinder, and of avidly following the conversation from said vantage spot, the change in Sherlock’s expression would have been impossible to miss. The scowl on his face vanishes as he stares, stunned, at his coffee.
, no - I'll, yes," Sherlock says, the words falling in a nonsensical rush from his mouth. He flexes his jaw; it's still stiff, but at least he can speak properly. "Yes, I remember."
“…Yes, course I will,” John says, and he doesn’t even care how insane he sounds, or how utterly bonkers this whole evening is turning out to be, never mind the fact that he has absolutely no clue what he’s getting himself into here with this self-proclaimed
There’s the sound of a pistol cocking, and Watson steps into frame. John sags against the sofa cushions in relief; he doesn’t think he’d be able to handle it if the director had actually written Holmes’ death into the film. Watching Sherlock plummet to his death from a rooftop was more than enough, thank you very much. He has no desire to see it enacted, not even a Victorian version of it.
“Do you want my help or not, Lestrade?” their regular – Sherlock – snaps, before turning his piercing gaze on John. He nudges the cappuccino with a pointed finger across the table (no ring, John’s unhelpful brain gleefully points out). “The coffee’s unbearably bitter. I asked for a cappuccino, not death by espresso.”
“Let’s go,” he said, as soon as the food had been transferred into a plastic container. He pushed his chair back and stood, then immediately swayed.
But just what precisely Sherlock has been so, John never finds out, because at that moment the door to what must be the first floor apartment flies open and Sherlock barges onto the landing, cheeks flushed, a blue silk dressing gown slipping off one shoulder as he brandishes a laptop in his hands. For a split second John’s mind wanders, and he thinks of all the possible scenarios that could have culminated in a sweaty, flushed Sherlock, before he’s brought back to the present by the man himself, and the whirlwind of activity that appears to orbit him.
He was recognized as the king’s personal servant, and allowed to make his way to the king’s room, which he had already been given a key to. He wasn’t sure what he intended to do when he entered the room. Certainly, he did not want to wake his master. Part of him, he supposed, hoped that the king would still be awake, or would wake up early. Otherwise, Sherlock would sit in one of the chairs for a while, or perhaps sleep on the ground by the bed. Maybe the emptiness he felt would go away, simply from being in his master’s presence.
When John looked back up at him, the corners of his eyes wet with restrained tears, there was a fond pang in Sherlock’s chest.
King William had been occupied with work all yesterday, John recalled. He had no way of knowing when His Highness had gone to bed. The man may not take kindly to being roused from a well-deserved slumber. Or perhaps he expected to be woken on time and would be angry that John had shirked his first responsibility?
“Hmm? Oh, you mean work. I know some pals who go in for that sort of thing. You, for one, with your doctoring and your case-solving. I’ll bet you and Sherlock have nabbed a pretty commission or two.”
“I don’t know what I will do when this tournament is over. Few people want to hire me, sir. I’m not a desirable servant.”
John didn’t know what to say. “Sherlock,” he began, though he couldn’t manage to continue from there. Should he tell Sherlock that he meant those words? It would be cruel to let the servant know how much he was loved by a king who would someday have to leave him for the sake of duty, and yet, John wanted Sherlock to know how deeply cherished he was.
It was a charming experience, Sherlock thought for not the first time, simply to speak openly with John. “It is strange, though. My brother has always despised the priesthood. He told me that I ought to confess nothing.”
It was fascinating to listen to what King John read aloud, a passage about the fermentation of ale, yet it was sometimes difficult to pay attention and not simply bathe in that luxurious voice. King John had a forthright manner of speaking, as if he had never been denied anything in his life—which seemed to Sherlock to be quite likely—though there was a tender quality to it as well, which was evidence of his trustworthy, kind-hearted nature.
“You won’t ever have to find a new employer here.” John kissed the top of Sherlock’s hair, relishing the soft feel of his servant’s dark curls as Sherlock hummed appreciatively.
The servant looked so vulnerable, shaking on the caravan bed and brought to tears. It was impossible for John to think of anything but being as caring and attentive as he could be for Sherlock. He started stroking Sherlock, firmly and steadily.
The king shook his head. “I was in need of a servant, anyway. Oh, speaking of which… there’s something you should know, Sherlock.”
“Did Mycroft make this scarf for you?” John asked. He was genuinely curious, and he was also optimistic that the use of the elder brother’s nickname would bring Sherlock to a happier place.
It had become apparent to John that he could not rely on others. Others in this world took without giving. Even the lives he had saved on the battlefield—one of which he had pulled from the brink of death—had gone on without him.
John was fiddling with his white shoes, which was adorable, yet Sherlock intended to witness this little exchange between his brother and Lestrade, now that he knew what their relationship was. Truth be told, it was difficult to verify that relationship so far. They both stood formally, suggesting nothing other than a polite familiarity.
With a long moan, Sherlock rolled his head, and his hips jerked, taking more of John into himself, which only prolonged Sherlock’s keening.
“How are you two doing?” John asked considerately. A stalwart pal, this John Watson, and I’ll attest that to anyone.
“Ah, well… No secrets, yes?” Mycroft hesitated. “If you must know, Lestrade is a very creative man, and sometimes, we—”
“Reminds me of someone,” I commented wistfully, eyeing my blog. All this sounded familiar to me. “Sherlock can be charming when he wants to be, at any rate. Well, it seems like we have another thing in common, Bertie.”
“I love you, sir,” John whispered. “I really do like calling you things like sir sometimes. It makes me feel like I belong to you, and that’s really nice. But I like calling you Sherlock too. I’d like to be your equal. Does that make sense? Can I want both of those things?”
“Silence, please. Obviously you haven’t. Do you know, very generally speaking, what men and women may do together in the bedroom if they wish?”
He bent his knees to study a pink flower. Its bright colour and soft appearance drew Sherlock’s attention instantly. He reached out to touch it, and took a whiff of its light scent, which gently floated through the fresh air. Drawing the tip of his finger down one of its petals, he hummed with interest.
“Of course.” With a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek, John comforted his servant. “What did you want to ask me about?” There was a sharp tremor in his beloved maid. “Hey, it’s okay, Sherlock. Whatever it is, you can say it.”
William moaned, and his master’s voyeuristic pleasure made John buck involuntarily. He combed his fingers through William’s hair, clutching more tightly than he meant to, but only spurred to more loss of control with every kind whisper and encouraging touch.
John pushed his absurd emotions far away, reminding himself that Sherlock was now stiff and inhospitable. He took a deep breath and, keeping his gaze at a safe height, untied William’s dressing gown. The garment slipped off the graceful figure easily. It was difficult for John not to blatantly admire the smooth, fair skin exposed in front of him. John’s breath hitched when he glimpsed that William had been wearing nothing under the dressing gown.
“Hah, did I say too much?” John sat on one of the old benches, and was relieved that the thing felt sturdy under him. “Sorry. Go on, keep looking at the flowers.”
Modestly, John cracked a smirk. “Or we can get him a new corset,” he giggled. “The one I found was sort of worn.”
Fortunately, Mycroft had the answer. Carefully, he said, “John informed me that you would be here, Sherlock.”
No, do not concern yourself. I know that is all rubbish, of course, but it affects people, all the same.
It was difficult for Sherlock to tell what thrilled him more, the way that John hummed and sucked him, relieving Sherlock of tension as only John could, or the words that John whispered when he paused to catch his breath, the way he spoke of the eternity that they would share.
“That’s fine, we can take it. I don’t see why not, since it was probably forgotten here. It looks a bit heavy, though. I’ll carry it for you.”
There was some room left in the basket, John noticed. “It’s okay, you can pick some more. Here, I’ll hold that for you.” Grinning widely, John took the item away from Sherlock, easily holding it up for his cute servant.
Sherlock was no less bewildered. “Why are you laughing?” Gravely, he added, “This might mean Mycroft is deceiving you.”
It was a thrill for the king to make his servant feel admired. Sherlock was a miracle and deserved to be extolled as one. “In fact, Sherlock, you’d make me really happy if you leaned on my shoulder.”
Sherlock’s head tilted back as he shouted out his pleasure. He could not deny that his king knew just how to move into him, to make him feel wonderful.
John smiled sheepishly. His lord was very kind to him. “Thank you, sir.” He could take a few more moments to let the toy remind him of someone he had been able to help. “I’ll put him away in a moment.”
Sherlock was lucky that King John desired him. Surely, that was because of King John’s frustration and loneliness, more than any virtue on Sherlock’s part. He could not wish for anything more, however. Hoping for an emotional attachment from his master was truly too unrealistic. The king might be fond of him, perhaps, but kings did not love servants.
“There are some things I have dreamed of, things I have never revealed outside of confession before now, and some things, not even revealed there.” Suddenly, William’s voice wavered, losing a touch of its confidence. “Perhaps, I should not reveal these things now, either.” William’s hand fell away from John.
Sherlock surprised himself with the force of his voice. He immediately bowed his head again with deference, so he did not see what expression might have come over King John’s face.
,” Moriarty says, smirking. He tilts his head to the side (John shudders; it’s eerily similar to what the real Moriarty would do), “
Watson. Then, coming back to himself, he smirks. "Is that a Browning L9-A1 in your pocket, John, or are you-"
His ‘plan’ consists of taking Sherlock to dinner. (What? He’s never said it was a complicated plan.)
Sherlock continues staring down, unmoving. It takes John all of five seconds to figure out why. “Ah, sorry,” he says, and lets his hand fall. It feels cold and oddly bereft now it’s not covering Sherlock’s fingers and the warmed ceramic of the cup.
Propping himself up on his elbows, William looked down at John. They were very close, and John could see the most beautiful tenderness in William’s eyes. He only hoped that his master would not see the bright tint of his own embarrassed cheeks.
As Sherlock was rather taller than the maid before him, the dress was not long enough to reach his feet. This meant that John could see a good deal of Sherlock’s long, fair legs. Socks covered his feet, but there were no shoes.
“It wouldn’t be a totally free ride, Sherlock. You’d have to help with chores around the convoy, of course. And it will be a long journey. There are always challenges on a long journey. Not to mention, you’d be going to unfamiliar places, and everything would be new to you.”
If he could not kiss Sherlock in front of anyone, at least he could keep Sherlock in his room. The other visiting nobles were not likely to notice where the servant slept, and where the old friend of John’s was concerned, the king had once saved the man’s life; therefore, John knew that he was free to do what he wished while he stayed in that room, and no questions would be asked.
“Sure.” John couldn’t depend on Sherlock’s generosity, but the clever man had never lied to him. Maybe the apothecary’s son had more skills than he had previously thought. “Wait, Sherlock, I don’t think I told you I fought in the war?” The war ended two years ago, so he highly doubted that there was any telling smell of battle on him.
Sherlock followed his master into the brewery, where they were soon welcomed. The king secured a tour of sorts; one of the workers led them around, showing them the processes that went into creating different kinds of beer.
These words were hardly a surprise. Sherlock had always known better than to think that he could ever have the king’s heart. He had no claim on any of his master’s tender emotions. The king might someday reunite with his estranged but lawful wife, or he might take a new competent wife, or perhaps an able mistress, someone who could give the king many children. In any case, someone would come along who would fulfil the wants of both the king’s heart and body.
In fact, Sherlock was more confused than mortified. “Is there a difference?” he asked slowly. Given Mycroft’s humorous tone but no obvious reason for it, it seemed that Sherlock was missing something. Then again, he was uncertain if he should be asking at all.
John had thought more about the idea that had come to him, an idea that might solve his problems, and he wanted to discuss his plans with Sherlock. However, there was some chance that the people behind them would overhear something—even now, John could hear some chatter from the caravan just behind them, not that he cared what was being said—and that could be disastrous.
“I’m writing our names here,” John answered. Being almost done, he stepped back and let Sherlock look at the carving.
While ale was widely popular, it was not generally the chosen drink of nobility, who were known to prefer expensive wines. For that reason, Sherlock suspected that King John was not interested in the brewery as much as Sherlock was, even though he walked around with Sherlock in the place. This was just another occasion, then, that the king kindly indulged his servant.
It was devastating to Sherlock. His failure to serve the king’s intimate needs adequately must have been what had left the man despondent. It was probably difficult for the king to be cheerful when Sherlock was such a disappointment. Perhaps he pitied his poor servant, and did not tell him this out of altruism.
Sherlock moved to the front of the caravan, eager to see an unfamiliar new town, and grateful for the opportunity to sit next to the king, who seemed to have kindly forgiven the servant’s outrageous behaviour the night before.
“Thank you, sir.” Sherlock still fidgeted from some unknown discomfort. “May I, um,” he said quickly, “Is there anything I can do for you?”
“The cloak is not done yet, though.” Lestrade smiled. “It’ll be worth the wait. You won’t be disappointed when you see it.”
Mycroft folded his hands together and studied their table. They had each ruled over this country at some time or another, Sherlock considered, one through a war and the other its aftermath, yet neither of them knew how to move past their competition.
“Ah! You think I’m old-fashioned, do you? Just wait ‘til you have a few more words with Jeeves. He can’t get out more than a sentence or two without some input from ye olde fifteenth-century poets, and philosophers who tottered around before the wheel was invented. Not to mention the old statute of his that he goes by his surname, while lots of people get away with calling their PAs by their first names. Next to him, I’m a vision of the future.”
Nobody other than priests and the pharaoh was allowed in the room of the temple where the statue of John’s god was kept, and many times, this meant that Sherlock’s attendants had to wait outside, while John and Sherlock were left alone to perform certain ceremonies. After first meeting John, Sherlock had made sure to visit that specific temple very often, so that he performed as many of his rituals as possible in John’s company.
With both hands, Sherlock held the item carefully, as if it were made of glass. “This is too generous, sir.”
“Okay. Yeah. Well, you don’t have anything to be worried about, right? Pharaohs have nice afterlives, don’t they?”
The king said this with a casual air, but such a thing was astonishing to Sherlock. He pictured the grand king driving chariots with armoured horses into the fray of battle.
This request appeared to puzzle Sherlock, but he did as he was asked, placing the violin on a table.
Of course. You have to pay attention to your partner, for one thing! And then there are the turns. You can start turns once you are comfortable with the steps. Imagine turning the box just a little every time, you know.
Then there were the baths. John would never say so out loud, but he waited with anticipation for every opportunity to assist William with that task. Fortunately, his master had forgiven him for overstepping his boundaries the first time, and John was permitted to clean him again. The servant was careful to touch William in only perfectly acceptable places, though that did little to keep John’s wandering thoughts in check.
John carried on with his night, to his shift in the furniture warehouse, and as he handled the cabinets and tables, he could not help remembering that Sherlock’s touch had been upon his shoe, his arm, his hand. Guilty thoughts to be sure, but somehow, they made the lonely night pass by more comfortably.
I’m aware of that. He has mentioned it, when remarking on the concerted effort it takes to keep me in check.
John wasn’t sure that he should say anything. He felt powerful when he could see how devoted Sherlock was to him, though, and it gave him strength to speak honestly. “There’s something I’d like to do with you,” he said. “But it’s not quite right.”
“Not bad,” Sherlock murmured, with the look of a casting director who has heard the thing he’s been looking for. It struck him just right, I was sure.
If you ever did meet brother Mycroft, I think you would see very quickly that he is not representative of the expectations of our society.
“The pleasure is all mine.” He inched a little into his servant’s surprisingly warm, tight entrance.
“Your way of playing it,” Sherlock clarified. “It’s… not bad. I haven’t had the pleasure of acquaintanceship with another musician who actually cares about the sounds he’s making.”
I have resolved never to tell Holmes of my inclinations, and pray that whatever is wrong with me will be made right in time.
Sherlock felt a similar craving in himself for the lips of his magnificent king. He looked at those lips, which were surrounded by the coarse, handsome stubble of the king’s face, and swallowed. “You can kiss me, sir,” he said, with his own humble kind of whisper.
The nobleman said nothing. Of course, his statement had been clear, and there was no need to repeat himself. Stifling a sigh, John resigned himself to his own bed, the smaller of the two though still comfortable. He was sorry to see William take to his own bed without John, pulling the sheer curtains around the royal bed, shutting himself in.
Considering how thoroughly unappealing he was, Sherlock saw that it was no wonder that his master had rejected the service he had offered the previous night.
Sherlock was on the bed, on his knees, wearing a black gown and a white apron with intricate patterns. He was also wearing a dainty headpiece that was tied in the back in a large bow. The dress was familiar, though it took several long moments for John, dumbfounded as he was, to recall that the ensemble had belonged to his previous maid.
“Are you all right with this, Sherlock?” John asked, keeping his touch light. “You don’t have to do this for my sake.”
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock replied playfully. “After all, it’s only fair that you have flaws to balance my own bad habits, isn’t it?”
John nearly remarked that His Highness could check for himself, but he knew better. He eyed the water level. “It’s ready.”
John felt a warm flicker in his chest, feeling that this beautiful spirit who was fluttering about the forest was more like a woodland fairy than a mortal servant.
“I mean it, sir. You are chivalrous and kind. You have been kind to me, throughout this whole journey.”
William cried breathlessly and spilled himself, his trembling slowly calming, becoming a lethargic contentment, all while John cleaned him intimately and carefully. Even if this gift was over, John was thrilled that now he had sensations to carry with him to his dreams.
Ha! No doubt you threatened him, or extracted a false confession through some pretence. He has no deep interest in me. Lestrade is a lively, likeable man. I am distant, petty, and thoroughly unlikeable. He does not have feelings for me.
“I’m glad to hear that.” Again, King John sounded honest, yet it seemed unlikely that the king felt much of anything about a simple servant joining his convoy. Sherlock was certain that the king was only being considerate. “The convoy leaves in a few days, so there is plenty of time to find you a spot.”
“Bees, sir?” Sherlock thought of the buzzing little creatures, which he had sometimes watched around the flowers in the town he came from. It was odd to think that there were people who could keep those tiny, industrious beings in any capacity.
“Hey,” a voice called out. Father Lestrade appeared in the hallway. He was in his cassock as usual, and also wore a formal square biretta cap for the occasion. “Are you two ready to get in the carriage yet?” They were to be carried off to city, to be married in a public hall in front of everybody.
“I’m the one who mustn’t disappoint you.” John caressed his pretty servant’s arm. “I told you, it’s not a pure feeling that I have for you. To be honest, I’m a selfish bastard when it comes to you. Here you look so tense, but I want you so badly that it hurts.”
Among the deeply pleasurable feelings that Sherlock felt, there was a certain sadness. If all he could do was lie back and let the king use the servant’s hands for himself, then Sherlock was certain that he was not worthy to look at the king.
At last, John removed himself from the bed. “It’s time for us to get going now. Time to get dressed.”
John anchored himself with a knee to lean over Sherlock’s lap, and he kissed his servant’s forehead again. He loved Sherlock so much.
“That’s your car,” I repeated, still having difficultly associating it with the man in front of me. “And you have a PA to drive it.”
Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered. Each euphoric sensation was intensified by the knowledge of what awaited him for eternity. He would lead new, fascinating lives, and always he would find John, and John would find him. They would fall in love with each other, all over again.
A hand tilted Sherlock’s head up. It was a gentle movement, but being guided to look up at his king, who was holding his sleepwear in one arm yet was otherwise no more dressed than he had been before, made Sherlock’s heart pound. He wanted to look at King John for hours. However, his master was expecting a response.
Listening to the tunes of the violin, John was treated to beauty in sound, as well as in sight. His servant was already energetic, but he became even more vibrant when he played his music.
I am not displeased with how events have unfolded, however. There is something positively fascinating about the change that has come over you. You cannot live without him, you say?
Still, makes this more than a little awkward, doesn’t it? I’m supposed to be putting people like you and me in gaol, aren’t I?
If John stood before his servant, and pulled down his clothes while Sherlock knelt on the floor, then the king could slide his hands into Sherlock’s curly hair while Sherlock licked those lips of his again. Ever curious about trying new things, Sherlock might lean forward, and welcome John into his mouth. By tenderly positioning his hands on Sherlock’s head, John could guide his servant, who was adorably inexperienced and endlessly curious.
There were few people to say goodbye to. Sherlock was not close with anyone in his town, and he was only somewhat acquainted with the people who lived near him. Mainly, he informed his landlord that he would not be living there anymore.
