"But I never got to say it back.. I love you Cas" he finally says, he couldn't believe it but he said it. Finally, he was so happy knowing that Cas knows he loves him too. ", I love you so much in the same way Sam loves Eileen. And I'm sorry I didn't say anything sooner but the thought of you a celestial being, so beautiful, so smart, could  ever love someone as broken and angry as me seemed impossible so I locked the feeling down, drowning it in alcohol and strange women, fooling myself that the feelings for you would just vanish. But they never did. And when you said all those things that night I was so shocked that someone like you could love someone like me. And I'm sorry it took me till now to say it. I love you Castiel, I love you so much" Dean doesn't know when started crying but he could feel tears running down his face but he didn't care. They weren't sad tears. Not this time, they were happy tears.
"Didn't know you still lived with mom“ Dean said once they stopped hugging, he crossed the room going into the kitchen.
He arrived in Lawrence at 3 am, he parked the car in front of the house and got out of it. He grabbed the bag from the backseat and locked the car. He walked up to the house and unlocked it. Turning on the lights, made him see that the house was almost the same. The only thing that changed were the pictures. There used to be pictures where Dean and Sam were kids or teengers those picture were still there, some of them. Some were replaced by pictures where Sam and Dean are older, one of them even has Castiel in it. It was back in’09, when Sam was going away to univeristy. They all took a picture together, he couldn't bealive mom still had. He dropped the bag carefully to the floor and took the picture in his hand, looking at their faces. So happy so full of hope.
he honestly didn't know what to say to her. He didn't see much of his family after he left, he just felt like they all remainded him too much of him. The only person he did see was Sam, when Sam was going to university they were roommates. But then Sam lost Jess – the person he loved the most in the world, beside his family – and he lost himself. He left university and went back home to find himself again. After that he saw him a couple of times but not much. It was the same with his mom. She would sometimes come to visit but not for long. They all had their own lives and he kind of separated himself from them. But now he was ready to come home, he needed to face all the demons he left behind so many years ago. It was time, he wasn't a stupid kid anymore. "
"Hello, Dean" he heard Cas say and he just couldn't keep it together. He got up hugging his friend tightly.
"I don't but sence I knew you were coming I decided to come to surpise you“ Dean nodded opening the fridge, the grabbed the pie almost instantly. He putted it on the counter and started eating. „Do you want me to leave you two alone?“ Dean just flipped him off and continued to eat.
"We wasted so many years" says Dean, they were both laying in bed. Just laying there holding hands talking about everything and nothing. Just enjoying eacothers compay and they were so happy to be doing that.
Dean sat in the impala, turning on the radio "Carry on my wayward" started to play and he smiles. Never in milion years did he thought that he would actually end up in heaven when he died. He thought that his soul was to much torn apart, to dark to end up in heaven. After all the stuff he did and not to meantion all the stuff he did with the mark, it was just  to hard to believe that he would ever end up in such a beautiful place as heaven. And this heaven that Cas and Jack made was pretty great. Everyone living peaceful, his whole family. He can finally see Ellen, Bobby, Jo and even his parents again, talk to them, hug them. Heaven knows how much he wants to do that. But first he had to do something. He had to find an old friend and confess something. Words he shoud've said so many years ago, when he first started to feel something. But he was scared by his trauma caused by so many years of hiding one part of himself, hiding even from him. John Winchester made it clear so many years ago that boys kissing boys was wrong and anyone who thought different was sick and needed to be cured of that illness. So Dean decided the best thing to do is to lock that part of himself deep down. Sometimes though the desire in him couldn't stay in him, he had to let it outside but he always made sure no one noticed. Sometimes he would wink at a guy or even look longer at an attractive man but he always made sure nobody saw. But when a certain someone showed up that locked up part of him just kept coming up and it was so hard to keep it down. So he turned it into anger, sometimes drinking so much he couldn't remember his own name, and certainly not remember the very blue eyes that have been haunting him for weeks now everytime he closed his eyes. Same teary eyes, same "I love you" playing trough his mind.
Dean grins, leaning over to press a sweet kiss to Castiel’s cheek.
Silence swallows them for a few moments then, both lost in their thoughts.
The man that had given him literally everything, and never asked for anything in return.
This carries on for weeks.
“I just- I can’t be- can you just- just stop?” Dean can’t seem to stop his word commit, heart breaking more and more as Cas withdraws. “I can’t be what you- I’m not like- Cas I can’t-” His mouth snaps shut and he stares back into sad ocean blue eyes.
.” Cas says earnestly, and the tears filling his eyes overflow and spill down his cheeks. Dean’s heart falls to his feet.
The next change occurs after a hunt.
When Sam clues in he nudges Jack with his foot, and Jack all too happily gets up and leaves the room to fetch a blanket from the linen closet down the hall. When he returns he spreads it over the two of them, and Dean grins.
“Why are you telling me this now?” Dean’s voice comes out stilted, barely a whisper as dread clutches at him. Billie bangs on the door again, and Dean’s skin crawls.
“Whoa, Dean, it’s okay.” Sam rushes to say, and Dean shouts over him.
Castiel’s thigh stays pressed against Dean’s for the duration of the meal, their shoulders bumping occasionally. That makes it easier for Dean to lace his fingers through Castiel’s as soon as they’re done eating, resting their joined hands upon the tabletop. He sips idly at his coffee as Castiel talks eagerly with Jack about the changes he’s made to heaven, and not for the first time Dean wishes he could freeze time to stay in this moment with his family.
Castiel smiles against his skin and that’s how Dean falls asleep, wrapped in his fiance’s arms with his heart light in his chest.
A half an hour later they’re flying down the road, speakers blasting Led Zeppelin. Dean tries to squish down the warmth in his chest that surfaces every time Castiel plays the mixtape he’d given him. Castiel is behind the wheel, singing loudly along with Robert Plant, their joined hands resting on the bench seat between them.
“Can we talk, Dean?” Cas murmurs, and for the first time all day anxiety is able to sink its claws into Dean.
And Dean loves him.
“I need to speak with you.” He says, and Dean groans in frustration, head falling back into his pillows.
“I’m not gay, Sam!”
He’d been patient with Dean -he’d snuck around for weeks just waiting for Dean to get the courage to tell John.
Cas stands up so abruptly that his chair screeches and falls to the floor, startling them both.
“Thanks guys.”
Dean doesn’t remember why he’d been so nervous.
Atop the table is a large plate heaped with pancakes, a pan of scrambled eggs, a heaping plate of bacon, another plate of sausages, and a bowl of mixed fruits.
Because of his focus he’s even more aware of the way Castiel loudly and conspicuously clears his throat a few feet from the kitchen door. They make it into the kitchen before Dean can voice his question, and it’s answered for him.
“Well I’ll go with you.”
“It’s okay, Dean. I forgive you.”
Dean opens his mouth, an angry retort on the tip of his tongue, but he snaps his mouth shut before he can say something hurtful. He tosses words around in his mind, briefly considers admitting it and scraps that thought quickly- unorthodox feelings aside Dean can’t be gay. He just can’t. He looks up, green eyes locking with hazel, and he almost expects to see the same hatred in Sam’s eyes that he’d so often seen in John’s- but instead he sees compassion.
“They look amazing.” He says, and Jack lights up.
“I don’t know.” He lies, but he knows Cas will see right through it. “It scares me, Cas. It scares the hell out of me.”
Dean huffs. His eyes fall shut, exhaustion tugging at his body and attempting to persuade him into ignoring the angel and and trying for more sleep. A flash of his dreams -warm calloused hands squeezing his hips and a gruff whisper of his name- has him shooting up out of the bed.
Cas’ face is so full of warmth that Dean can hardly bear it.
And it breaks Sam’s heart.
“Come on, it’s bedtime.” He whispers, and Castiel reluctantly cooperates, wiggling out of Dean’s arms and getting to his feet.
“You guys made breakfast, Cas and I can clean up.” Dean protests immediately, clumsily signing along to the best of his abilities. Castiel and Sam are great teachers and he’s improving steadily, but he’s still nowhere as good as his teachers are at sign language. She smiles warmly.
When Sam finally releases him it’s to point him toward the table where a few pans litter the surface. Jack’s eyes are bright, gleaming with excitement as Cas pulls Dean by the hand toward the table.
Dean never thought his birthday could be something so good. So happy.
“He-” Dean hesitates, roughly clearing his throat. He doesn’t know how much is too much- but Sam’s promise to drop this conversation after it ends prompts him to continue. “He beat the fucking shit out of me, Sam. Sometimes it feels like if I let my guard down for one second -if I do even one thing that he doesn’t approve of- he’s going to walk through that door and- and kill me. Just like he threatened when- when he-” Dean clears his throat.
Dean pulls back slightly at that.
about himself, even if he accepts the same things in other people.
By the time the movie ends Jody has fled to her room to go to bed, Claire and Kaia are out cold, and Jack is doing his best to feign sleep next to them to get the full sleepover experience. Eileen had made it about ten minutes longer into the movie than Castiel before falling asleep, and Sam carefully scoops her up and bids them goodnight. Once he’s out of the room Dean gently rouses Castiel with soft kisses on his face.
He turns his smile upon Castiel, who grins knowingly and lifts their joined hands to press a soft kiss to Dean’s ring.
John’s hatred had been so focused on Dean that his older brother is incapable of accepting
Dean blinks furiously against the emotions that train of thought causes. It had taken years to get here -and a few months of therapy after defeating God to learn that it’s okay to show emotions- and while he knows he still has a long way to go to undo all of the harmful brainwashing his father had subjected him to and to unpack four decades of baggage on his shoulders, for now he can’t remember a moment he’d ever felt better.
When Dean parks Baby he wakes his passengers and they all wander into the bunker. It isn’t until they’re in the kitchen, Eileen half in the fridge and Sam and Cas slumped at the table while Dean hovers by the coffee maker, that Dean realizes the cowboy hat has migrated to Cas’ head.
Dean takes a deep steadying breath. His nerves are frayed, but he
Dean never saw Evan again.
“I’m good.” He says hoarsely, banging his fist on his chest as he roughly clears his throat. “I guess you tried to bring it up again?”
For the most part they’re out -but Jody had called saying she needed help and they hadn’t hesitated. The case is a pain in the ass -but skinwalkers always are, and there had been three. It takes just shy of five days to wrap up the case.
“I love you.” Dean says, and Castiel grins dopily and turns slightly to kiss Dean’s bare shoulder.
“Fine.”
Once the plates have been passed around Castiel returns to Dean’s side and he stands, waiting impatiently for the other man to sit so Dean can reclaim his spot in his lap. As it turns out the apple pie is absolutely incredible -and no, Dean is not biased at all because Castiel made it- and he eagerly inhales a second piece with another scoop of ice cream.
Why is that? He knows the answer- it takes absolutely no thought. It’s because of John.
The relief Dean feels is so overwhelming that he grips the edge of the counter so that he doesn’t fall over.
“You’re such an asshole,” Dean says, delighted when Cas’s smile grows.
“Sorta,” Dean says, nestling deeper into his pillow. “Not a cuddler?”
Usually he goes up to the front to greet clients when they arrive, but there’s a knock on his door at 1:18. Dean takes a deep breath and puts on a smile. “Hey, I’m Dean —” his spiel cuts off because it’s Cas. “Are you ok? What’s wrong?” Dean says in a rush.
- “You’re going to get me into trouble.”

You’re about to learn a lesson about how you shouldn’t believe a damn thing that comes out of Ash’s mouth. There’s no together.
back, ten times a day. touching something beyond.
- "Wow, you are a terrible liar."
“Continue,” Cas says, then just stands next to the bed while Dean touches himself, watching. Once he’s got a nice rhythm going, biting his lower lip as he meets Cas’s eyes, Cas says, “Stop.”
Yes sir I did
“Jesus Christ,” Dean says, and Cas laughs, even as he’s jerking the soft sweatpants Dean is wearing down to his knees.
Cas’s alarm is loud and shrill. He drops his phone and then scrambles to pick it up again while Dean laughs. “Asshole,” Cas grumbles.
“We could,” Dean repeats.
Castiel laughs, and even though it’s reserved, it’s a really good laugh. “I haven’t conquered that one yet, though it would be interesting to see how the tentacle color aspect is translated. I suppose it’s back to DuoLingo for me.”
Dean blinks upwards in surprise. No one speaks on the bus, and it’s rare that another guy tries to smash into a seat next to him. “Nah, man,” he says. “Sit.”
“I’m—” Cas winces. “Many subs find me too soft.”
The things I’ve done.
“Cas, buddy,” Dean says, flopping in a chair next to the bed. “We’re not finding anything. But I’m going to get you out of this, ok?”
some mornings you wake up and the
“Yeah. I mean, it’s not any good —” Cas’s hard look cuts him off. “I know, sorry,” Dean says, flushing. “Do you want to see it?”
They can’t figure out this fucking curse. Cas is still as a corpse but still breathing, heart still beating, limbs still warm to the touch, but he won’t wake up no matter what they do.
After the breakup with Lisa, Charlie scolded Dean for being shitty at communicating in personal relationships.

“That would be wonderful.”
Dean grimaces. “Point taken. This one’s only empty because of me,” he says, wiggling a tentacle at him.

- “It’s all right. I’m not going to let go.”
Carefully, Cas takes the canvas from Dean to set it up against the wall, just so he can throw his arms around him and hug him tight. “Thank you,” Cas whispers, and Dean thinks he might be a little choked up, like Dean’s stupid painting is worth crying over.

Cas smiles, wide and gummy, which is somewhere near the top of the lengthy list of Dean’s favorite Cas smiles. “Take off your shirt.”

Cas meets Dean’s ridiculously dramatic car and then his wonderfully cozy home. At the end of the night — or the beginning of the morning — Dean says, “I’m not completely sold on the kissing thing, but would it be cool if I hugged you?”
“I’m really fucking drunk, I’m sorry, it didn’t mean –”

inspired by a tumblr text post by user debthaver: "just drove a guy home from a bar and for the whole 15 minutes he talked about how excited he was to see his wife"
Silence.
Dean pushes himself up on an elbow so he can give Cas a quick kiss and says, “It’s a date.”
Dean wipes his paint-streaked hands on his jeans, like that will help, then leaves his art room to meet Cas at the end of the hall. “Hey, baby,” Dean says. “I didn’t know you were coming.”
another few moments, trying to memorize the play of the muscles across Cas’s back, and the golden tan of his skin, and the scars Dean is proud to know all the stories behind. A rollerskating injury, faded spots scattered across his shoulders from a blistered sunburn.
Awesomely cool. I’ll order Indian later. :)
“I found a monster egg in my kitchen, presumably put there by my imbecile of a husband.”

In their room, Dean collapses face-first into the bed. The scent-neutralizing detergent used on the comforter helps clear the stench out of his nose.
“You don’t?”
“Y-yeah,” Dean manages to get out.

clues muddled in newspaper
(no one is identified as ace but they are)
Dean hates laundry, but he can imagine Cas kissing him and saying
“God, I love you, you fuckin’ weirdo,” Dean says, rolling over so he can watch Cas undress.
Dean hadn’t expected anyone to see his underwear, so of course he’s wearing Batman boxers and not his usual getting-laid boxer-briefs. Cas snorts a laugh, and then there’s the distinct sound of a belt snaking out of his pants. A shiver runs up Dean’s spine and he digs his fingernails into the cushion underneath him.
You make me feel powerful.
“What do you mean?” Cas says on an exhale.
And I tried to—and I thought you were letting me down easy, ignoring it. Figured you knew I was a shitty sub.”
“Good,” Cas says. He kisses Dean’s forehead and then urges him to nestle under his chin.
Cas raises an eyebrow, then glances at the tv. “It

for this chapter.
Dean says, huffing a laugh against Cas’s wrist. “We are fucking idiots.”
“Ok,” Dean says.
It’s warm and wet and Dean knows some is going to clump in his eyelashes uncomfortably within seconds, but more importantly, it’s striped across his cheek and lips so he can taste Cas with a quick swipe of his tongue.
Spiderman
“My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”
maybe i never wanted to be the mayor of gehenna
thanks to oriana. elanor-n-evermind is still to blame for awakening this in me.
Something clicks. Something seems clearer now, maybe just Cas’s adoration, but all of Dean’s doubts about himself fade a little to the background. It makes him brave enough to say, “I have something for you, too. I mean, it’s dumb — but awhile ago, you said that you might want to have one of my paintings, and maybe you don’t anymore, so you can totally trash it —”
Cas tears his eyes from the dinosaurs to look at Dean, his intense gaze softening. “Yes?”
“How long?”
“We have one king ready for you through Saturday night,” the beta says, starting to pull out keycards for them.
The first time is an accident: Dean’s on his knees on the floor, and he goes too deep and pulls off choking and sputtering just in time for Cas to come all over his face.
“Nope. I have had a healthy and loving relationship with cock for much of my life.”
Cas snorts and adjusts his backpack on his shoulder. “Getting sued is the last thing I need.” They stand in line for the front desk in silence for a moment, and then Cas says, “This is easy for you. You know how to talk to people.”
“You’ve been weird all week, dude.”
Cas is watching a little more intently than necessary. He licks, swallows, and sucks next, grimacing.
Dean knows the ones on Cas’s front, too: a car accident, a surgery, the time he got fucking
“Is that a tattoo?” Cas asks, heart sinking because he knows it’s not.
Cas wraps his hand around Dean’s cock and strokes, tight, all the way over the head and back down. The sound of their lovemaking — because it does feel that way, even if Dean won’t say it — is even more obscene while they’re still surrounded by sunset light through open windows.
Castiel’s voice is grave, because he never knows when someone is making a joke. “No, of course not.”
Castiel looks at his phone for the six hundredth time that hour.
- "I'm happy for you."
“We could both use a break. I’m taking a long weekend to spend with you.”
You know I hate honorifics.
The appetizer is fried, which works for Dean and Cas laughs as he devours most of it. Dean’s mouth is full when Cas says, “I love you.”
When Dean welcomes him back in, it’s to wrap his arms around Castiel and cry and say how much he missed him. Dean’s tears do not come lightly; Castiel knows this.

This is a nice kiss to get to know, too: hard and claiming, sending heat rushing through Dean’s entire body. He wonders where Cas learned to kiss like this.

Did you do as I asked?
“Oh. No. Thank you. But no, I–” Is Cas nervous? Cas is never nervous. “–I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I’d like to suck your cock.”
“You don’t have to say that kind of shit,” Dean says.
“Because I value your friendship.”
“You have blanket permission to touch me however you’d like, excluding happy ending-related touches.”
“I am more fluent in some than others.”
just to be clear, there is zero plot to this fic.

Dean manages to wait until they walk into the house before he says, “Are you fucking kidding me, Cas?”
“Yup.”
Taking in air after what seems like an era without is a different kind of high, the rush as the roller coaster reaches its tallest peak and begins to drop. While Dean’s chest heaves, Cas presses soft kisses on his neck where he can still feel the phantom clench of Cas’s fingers.
Things stay just like they’ve always been: they don’t talk about Dominance and submission, and they certainly don’t talk about their scene together. Dean used to love that none of that shit matters to Cas, but now he’s wishing it did. Wishing him being a sub was something that mattered in some small way.
Quietly, Cas says, “Tell me. Is that what you want to be doing?”
“You kissed me,” Cas says, touching his cheek like he can still feel the ghost of Dean’s mouth.
Dean fumbles his bottle of beer but manages to catch it before it hits the tile. “What was that?”
“What would you like to do today?” Cas asks. “Tell me what you need.”
Dean grimaces. “Point taken. This one’s only empty because of me,” he says, wiggling a tentacle at him.
Once he’s left the table, Dean takes a sip of his beer, a deep breath, and pushes his chair back so he can kneel next to the table. His knees go
“You don’t have to, but I thought you would look lovely, and even better once I do some terrible things to you.”

Dean has seen Cas shirtless a million times, but never allowed himself to notice. He has plenty of other attractive friends and he doesn’t feel the urge to gawk at them, but Cas is different. It takes effort to keep his eyes from drifting towards Cas, like Cas is a bright sun and Dean is drawn to him by gravity.

It’s a little awkward to be in nothing but socks and t-shirt, but then Cas is following him into bed in goofy socks, sexy boxer-briefs, and a tee that’s a little too big for him so it slips to show off one collar bone.

Weed doesn’t effect Dean at all, but he says, “We’d be such a hot couple.”
Dean didn’t realize how tense he still was until all the tension leaves him in a rush. Cas is still his Dom, and in this moment, that’s all that matters. “Thank you,” he says, and Cas seems to lighten a bit.
Flying, easy like warm pockets of air are lifting him into the clouds. He’s never gone this high, this far down, with anyone but Cas. Far enough that he doesn’t realize it’s going to happen until it does: he cries out and comes, wetting the boxers still covering his cock.
“I’m not talking about it,” Cas says. “We’re eating outside, and I’d like you to sit on the deck next to the table. Use one of the chair cushions.”

so he’s always taking care of his friends, but—well, he doesn’t jump up from the couch because Charlie’s beer is almost empty. That question helped guide a lot of the way he acts around Cas:
They lose Charlie. And Ash, and Meg, and then Mary, eviscerated by Visser II while Sam and Dean watched, impotent.

car when they could’ve been in the Impala, but Cas made it clear he was driving and Dean wasn’t to argue. Which is why Dean also tries to hold down his grimace when Cas presses a hand to Dean’s lower back to guide him into a sushi restaurant.
“You better be,” Cas says, pulling off his t-shirt and throwing it at Dean’s face. Dean tosses it towards the hamper and misses, but then he’s got a faceful of Cas’s sleep pants, too.
people. Me and myself weren’t
Cas hums back, turning his head to nuzzle into Dean’s hair before he goes tense underneath him.
The hotel elevator is full, mostly stinking alphas, and Dean holds his breath as long as he can on the way up. He’s pretty sure Cas is doing the same next to him.
this. He’s sick of longing- he’s taking this step. He’s doing it. No more living in fear- no more letting John control his life even though he’s dead.
Dean doesn’t know what to do.
“I love you too baby.”
“We made breakfast!” Jack announces proudly.
Dean’s cheeks heat and again he waits for the world to end.
“I would say yes. Always.”
“It’s your birthday. Go on.” She shoos them again.
“You always taught me that love is love, and to never be ashamed of myself.” Sam says, and Dean’s expression turns to ice. “Why does the same not apply to you?”
“Which is why he snapped at me and then left.” Cas surmises, and Sam nods.
“Hit you?” Cas repeats slowly. Dean rolls his eyes.
Firstly, Cas smiles at him with warmth he definitely doesn’t deserve and offers a soft ‘good morning, Dean’.
“I’m not perfect at this. Some days are harder than others. I might mess up- I probably will. But Cas I…” Dean pauses, and Cas smiles so wonderfully that it gives Dean the courage to finish his sentence. “I want you. All I can do is promise you that I’ll do my best. I just hope… you still want me.”
~~~~~
Sam?” He demands, fear bleeding into anger because anger is easier. “You thought I was some kind of- some-”
“I need to talk to him.”
He already knows what Cas wants to talk about and Dean isn’t- he’s not- he can’t do it. He’s not ready for that. His dad's words are still too deeply ingrained in his mind. He knows he’s in love with Cas -he knows that Cas loves him- he knows that every second of every day his traitor heart aches for Cas- but Dean is so scared.
He pretends he doesn’t notice Jack grinning to himself on the floor bed.
And in spite of the birthdays he’d been forced by his subconscious to revisit he feels his smile widening as he leans up to steal a soft kiss from his boyfriend. Castiel returns the kiss immediately, soft pink lips parting against Dean’s to kiss him more fully.
The words should scare him -he should be running- but instead he finds himself pulling back to meet Cas’ gaze. He isn’t scared anymore. He knows he isn’t fixed -knows that he has a long road ahead of him- but he isn’t scared anymore.
Wide blue eyes search green, and Cas swallows thickly.
Cas smiles, then, so softly and sweetly that Dean worries he’s said too much.
For Sam’s whole life Dean had been the one to reassure him, tell him that there was nothing wrong with him - that it was okay if the boy Sam was sneaking around with was his boyfriend. Dean had never forced their fathers hateful beliefs upon Sam, and Sam knew Dean was genuine when his brother told him that being gay was okay -but Dean also doesn’t believe the same thing when it comes to himself.
Cas is looking at him like he’s a kicked puppy and Dean wants desperately to comfort him, but he isn’t sure how to without Cas realizing just how fucked up Dean is- and if he does he’ll leave and Dean doesn’t want that, Cas only just came back.
“Thanks sunshine.”
“Alright, hit me.”
“You should dress like this more often.” Castiel murmurs, arms sliding to wind around Dean’s waist as he steps up behind him. Dean grins, leaning back into the ex-angels hold. He tosses his sponge into the bucket beside Baby’s driver side door.
Tears are blurring Dean’s vision and he wants to scream at Cas -to tell him to stop and beg him not to do this- because he gets it. He knows where this is going. Cas is trying to cash in on his deal to save Dean, and the mere idea of it has Dean wanting to self destruct.
“Don’t do this, Cas.” He pleads, but it’s too late. It’s already done. Behind Cas the door gives way, crashing to the ground, and Dean’s breath catches. “Cas!”
“Also,” Sam says tersely. “If dad ever crawled his way out of hell, I’d kick his ass before he had the chance to say a word to you.”
He guesses it makes sense, as Sam has done his fair share of experimenting, but to see that compassion directed at
? He doesn’t deserve it. It’s clear in that moment just how much Sam loves him, and that alone gives Dean the courage to hedge an answer that isn’t a defensive insult.
, Dean’s life is ending, he can’t breathe he can’t do this- someone do something-
Just like every other time the words had been uttered he feels briefly overwhelmed by the love he feels for Dean, and overwhelmed by the pride he feels on his boyfriend's behalf. He knows how hard it’s been for Dean to get to this point -especially after the incident with John and the nuns- but seeing Dean brave through that to the point of comfortably expressing himself is almost overwhelming.
“Have you been hit on the head, lately?” He scoffs. “Come on, Sam. You’re being ridiculous.”
“He did.” He says slowly. “And John beat him within an inch of his life for it.” Sam pauses for a moment, a heavy silence swallowing them as fury blazes in Cas’ eyes. “I thought- I woke up and my brother was bloody and hardly breathing and John was screaming at me to get him in the car- I thought he was going to die, Cas.
“Again with you appearing in my bed in the middle of the night.” He mutters. “It couldn’t have waited until morning?”
“Cas-”
If Dean is honest whenever he’d imagined this moment it was always him proposing to Castiel, but somehow this is even better. Castiel’s expression relaxes slightly as if he can hear Dean’s thoughts.
Their relationship moves slowly. Cas is more than content to go at Dean’s pace, and Dean loves him that much more for it. Cas melts Dean into a puddle with every touch, every brush of soft pink lips against his cheek, and he wonders if Cas knows just how gone Dean is on him.
“When Jack was dying I- I made a deal to save him.” Cas says, snapping Dean from his steady spiral.
Castiel grins against Dean’s shoulder blade, hands sliding down so they can push into the pockets at the front of Dean’s damp sweatpants.
“I’m gonna head to the store, we’re low on groceries.”
Despite never having been skating before in his life -a fact that Castiel secretly curses John for- Dean picks it up very quickly. Castiel stays by his side the whole time, their hands linked between them, and both bask in the normalcy that they’re now allowed to have. When the sun starts to set they stumble clumsily off the ice, laughter ringing between them as they all but fall onto the log they’d sat on prior to lace up their skates.
“Why is it everyone else is allowed to love who they love and be happy, but you aren’t?”
It’s two weeks before the fight that has Sam walking out of their lives, and John is out clearing out a vamp nest. Sam and Dean are eating dinner, a modest burger and fries, when Sam finally gathers the courage to bring it up. It’s been eating him alive inside for years- and questions to John ended in screaming matches between them that resulted in thrown fists between John and Dean.
Cas deserves better than that. And even if he doesn’t want better, he at least deserves Dean figuring his shit out before trying to tackle this conversation.
“These were my idea.” She winks as she sets them down next to him, and Dean turns to press a swift kiss to her cheek.
But he can’t.
Cas’s hand lands upon his shoulder and it paralyzes Dean. His eyes go wide, and he wonders what Cas see’s on his face.
“C’n I have an avocado?” Sam calls, and Dean tosses one over. Eileen closes the fridge behind her, wandering to the table with an apple and a bottle of water in her hand.
“I know.” He mutters -and he really doesn’t, but Dean can’t say that. “I just- I wanted to make sure that you know I don’t expect anything from you just because I-”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
All through the exchange Cas watches Dean- and the hunter is pretty sure his angel wants an invite. Dean gathers all of his courage.
“He just… doesn’t know how to let himself be happy.” Sam sighs. “He told me once that he’s scared if he doesn’t hide it -if he doesn’t beat himself up for it- John will come back and kill him, like he threatened to do when he found out about Evan.”
Through his dad's influence Dean had learned that anything other than a man being with a woman was
And then Sam is pulling him into a hug, and his face is meeting his sasquatch brother's shoulder and his heart overflows with a sudden rush of affection for his baby brother. He squeezes him tightly, for once not even minding the way Sam can easily rest his cheek on the top of Dean’s head, and he allows himself to bask in the tight embrace that once upon a time he’d believed he’d never experience again.
“Yeah.” Dean murmurs, pressing a kiss against Castiel’s forehead. “Best birthday I’ve ever had.”
He’s too scared.
Cas is beyond delighted to tell Sam and Eileen -with Dean’s assurance that he’s okay with it- and they’re both so happy for them that Dean almost forgets why he was so scared of taking this step.
The shopping trip is uneventful, as Dean isn’t even sure how to broach the subject. They walk the store, content in each other's presence, and Dean thinks
influence- but he’d occasionally lament that he’d essentially missed out on that period of his life. On his childhood.
He passes back out almost instantly.
“Jack made the pancakes.” Sam says, undisguised pride in his voice, and Dean makes sure to smile extra wide at their enthusiastic son.
“Christ, Cas, I know that. I’m not a homophobe.”
He wants to scream -yearns to scream- but he knows he can’t. He knows it isn’t true. Dean’s too broken. Still his heart screams.
Castiel’s fingers make one final track through Dean’s hair before his hand slides down to cup the other man’s cheek gently. In spite of himself, Dean leans into it. He’s so glad that he can have this now, when previously he wouldn’t let himself even entertain the idea despite the ache in his chest at the mere sight of the beautiful angel that had gripped him tight and raised him from perdition. As if knowing exactly what he’s thinking Castiel’s expression turns almost unbearably soft and he leans in to sweetly kiss his boyfriend once more.
“I love you too.”
~~~~~
“John taught Dean that being gay -or bi, or pan, or anything other than straight- was sick and wrong. He always told Dean that anything other than a man being with a woman was disgusting. Dean never understood why. He never held anyone else to that belief -hell he was overjoyed for me when I got my first boyfriend- but he… he just internalized it and made it a reason to hate himself.
It starts off slow. He knows it’ll take more than a week to overcome forty years of brainwashing, but he can hardly bear the way he longs for Cas- especially now that he knows his love is reciprocated. He’s a long time from being able to tell Cas that he loves him, but he thinks he can get there, now. So, he starts small.
Dean stiffens slightly next to Cas. Cas doesn’t continue, content to let that hang in the air between them until Dean is ready to comment on it.
“You’d probably win, too.”
The world most decidedly does not end.
“I love you too.” Dean grins.
They meet by Baby’s trunk and Castiel fishes around for a moment amidst the supplies he’d somehow snuck in there without Dean noticing. He draws up and offers a hat and gloves, and despite his instinct to scoff and refuse he accepts them. The day is mercifully mild, sun shining through the clouds, but Dean knows from experience that cold hands are not pleasant.
Dean already loved her, but on his journey of accepting himself she’d been one of the biggest helps. She’s kind, and she’s a badass, and she understands.
Once they’ve both donned a hat and gloves Castiel grabs the skates from the back.
“I love you too.” He utters, and Dean’s smile is hidden by his hot chocolate.
“Alright.” Sam says without looking up from his laptop, Eileen leaning over his shoulder and reading something on the screen. “Can you grab me some tea- and some quinoa?”
Dean can’t hear it again- he isn’t ready. In a blind panic, terrified of Cas putting those words out into the world again, Dean interrupts.
He just hopes Cas never finds out. If Cas ever looked at him the way John had… well, Dean’s not sure he’d survive that. It might break him.
“You thought
Dean’s only answer is to sit up, grinning eagerly, and Castiel laughs delightedly. Taking his arm back he reaches into his back and retrieves the thermos -and the sleeve of styrofoam cups he’d brought along- and pours Dean a cup of hot chocolate. Indescribably pleased Dean patiently waits for Castiel to pour his own cup of hot chocolate and tuck the thermos away once more before snuggling back into his side.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean murmurs, shifting to lightly pat the bed next to himself. Slowly, Cas sits down in a mirror of Dean’s position. “I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have yelled at you.”
“Ready to get up?” He asks when he pulls back. Dean grumbles idly in the back of his throat, wiggling impossibly closer to Castiel. “There’s bacon.”
Sam comes in half an hour later.
He believes his dad was wrong about him. He believes that there’s nothing wrong with him. He believes that Cas and Sam and Eileen love him- that their whole family does.
- into the snow and kiss him silly, but he’ll wait until Castiel is done to act upon the impulse.
He climbs onto the bed and immediately pulls Castiel into his arms. The ex-angel doesn’t hesitate to wiggle into Dean’s embrace. He winds up with his leg thrown over Dean’s, his arm tossed over Dean’s chest and his cheek pillowed on his shoulder.
He’s in love with Cas- and he fucking hates himself for it. He hates himself even more every time his heart jumps at Cas’ touch, every time he yearns for Cas. God, he’s disgusting. John was right about him- he’s a freak. He can’t even be friends with someone properly.
Not of this. Not of Cas.
Stan gave up on him long before Sam and Dean moved away, and it took a long time for that hurt to go away. Dean had cried himself to sleep for days.
Dean flinches as though he’s been struck- no. He flinches like he’s expecting to be struck, like he’s waiting for Sam to stand up and pummel him- like he’d
“I baked this myself.” He says nervously, and Dean’s breath catches. “I hope it’s-” Castiel breaks off when Dean grabs the front of his shirt and tugs him down into a kiss.
Attention still on his brother Dean absentmindedly lifts his hand to offer Castiel a bite of his eggroll, which his fiance happily accepts. As he crunches on it he squeezes Dean gently around the waist.
The climb out of the car and their hands join together once more as they head for the door. He knows he’s going to have to endure Sam’s teasing about their heart-eyes but Sam can kiss his ass because he just got
Dean’s stomach falls to his feet and he sets his burger down, appetite now long gone. It takes him a moment to respond, fear curdling in his stomach and tightening his throat.
“What were you dreaming about?” Cas asks, voice like dark whiskey, and Dean’s heart tries to leave his chest.
“You brought me ice skating?”
Castiel laughs once more, leaning down to press a soft kiss to Dean’s temple.
It wasn’t always bad with their dad. Sometimes there were good times- times when their dad was sober and wasn’t angry at them. At everyone.
“Cas, what’re you-” And then his sentence chokes off when he realizes what exactly is happening. Cas is on one knee in front of him, cheeks painted pink -either from nerves or the cold, Dean can’t tell- with a simple silver band held between the thumb and forefinger of his free hand.
John smiles and pats him on the shoulder, but neither action holds any emotion; he hates Dean. Things won’t go back to how they were before because his dad knows he’s a freak and can barely stand to look at him.
And confusion manages to distract him -if only slightly and briefly- from the absolutely earth shattering realization that even if they made it out of this alive Cas would still have a noose around his neck. True happiness? They’re about to die- why is that relevant?
“How about we go wash Baby?” Castiel offers, and Dean lights up.
“Gross.” Dean mutters, and Sam flips him the bird. Dean watches as Sam quickly signs something to Eileen that he can’t quite make out, and she giggles into his shoulder.
“I just- I can’t do it, Sammy.” He says slowly.
“Happy birthday!” Comes three shouts from his family, Jack seated at the table and practically bouncing in anticipation, Sam and Eileen stood by the coffee maker. Dean’s heart swells. He can’t remember the last time he got this many birthday wishes- probably back when Bobby was still alive.
“I’d rather have you.” Dean says, and the angel’s gaze lifts slightly. “Cursed or not.” The joy in Cas’ eyes scares him and he hastily tacks onto his sentence. “And besides, we’re all cursed. I seem like good luck to you?”
“You own my heart, and I want to grow old with you at my side. I promise to love you every day for the rest of existence. Will you marry me?”
“Happy birthday, Dean.”
“Cas?” He asks slowly, and Cas turns to face him. Dean parks Baby in the garage, and takes a deep breath.
“Yes.” He says between kisses that Castiel eagerly returns. “I love you too, Cas.”
As usual Sam conks out in the passenger seat, and in an apparent new normal Cas is also out cold, sprawled in the back of Baby. Eileen is sleeping more gracefully, tucked up against the door with Sam’s sweater as a pillow.
“What would I be if I told you I have a thermos of hot chocolate in my bag?”
Cas smiles at him and
Dean searches for the fear that he’d felt last night, but he comes up empty. His senses are so wholly overwhelmed with Cas. All he can think about is how beautiful Cas looks right now, lips parted ever so slightly and dark hair fanned across the pillow.
“I’m not saying you’re gay, or bisexual, or anything at all. I’m just saying that if you are, even if you aren’t ready to talk about it, there’s nothing wrong with you.”
“Thanks Jack.” Castiel mumbles, wiggling slightly so he can press his face into Dean’s neck. He inhales softly and presses a soft kiss to the skin there. “Love you.”
“Thanks, kid.”
“You love him.”
“I cared about the whole world, because of
He knows where this is going. He knows what’s coming next and there’s nothing he wouldn’t give to stop it, because if Cas says it Dean is going to
“Just the two of us?” He asks, and when Castiel nods Dean hums softly. “I’m in.”
Dean laughs softly and tries to ignore the wonky beat of his heart.
“No.”
Dean doesn’t realize he’s crying until a tear slips from his cheek and lands on his hand.
“Cas?”
“Dean, come on. It’s okay.” Sam says lightly.
and it scared Dean. Stan was kind, had curly blond hair and a wide smile, and brown eyes that Dean was sure could see right through him despite the thick wide rimmed glasses sat in front of them. Stan had welcomed Dean to the new school with open arms, and Dean wanted to surround himself with the comfort that Stan provided- but every time Stan looked at him it was like Dean could hear his father talking in his ear.
The drive home is spent much like the drive to the pond, hands joined on the center seat. Every few minutes Castiel’s hand shifts so his thumb can gently rub over the silver band wound around Dean’s ring finger, and to everyone but Castiel he would adamantly deny the way his heart skips in his chest every time. Castiel parks Baby in the garage and then leans over to press a soft kiss to his fiance’s lips.
“Cas? What’re you doing out here?” He asks curiously, gaze flicking around the library to check and see if his brother is lurking elsewhere. “I’d assumed you’d be with Dean.”
“You’re amazing.” He murmurs, and Castiel’s smile grows impossibly wider.
When Cas pushes open the door Dean is seated on the edge of the bed, feet on the floor and elbows on his knees.
“Sure, Sammy. What’s up?” He doesn’t sound like his guard is up yet at least, and Sam relaxes slightly.
Eventually, though, Dean thinks he’s ready. Maybe not for kissing just yet, or- or sex, but he’s ready to ask Cas to be his boyfriend. Officially. He’s ready.
Sam’s brows furrow, and he watches silently as Dean grabs his jacket and storms to the door. It slams shut behind him, and into the quiet of the motel room Sam sighs.
“Goodnight, dad.” Jack murmurs as they leave, and Dean smiles warmly at their son.
They’re dating for just shy of three weeks the first time Dean invites Cas to share his bed for the night.
Cas smiles, warm and familiar, and Dean feels safe. Accepted.
“I love you too. Did you have a good birthday?”
Comprehension dawns on Cas’ face and he nods, quickly launching into an explanation. If Dean’s gaze falls to the angel's lips once or twice that’s nobody’s business but his own- and he’ll hate himself for it later.
“What happened?”
Instantly Dean shifts away from the angel, narrowing his eyes menacingly.
“Thank you, darlin’.” He says in a terrible attempt at a texan accent.
He’s in the kitchen prepping for breakfast. A groggy Sam is seated at the table, and the coffee maker is on, waiting for Cas’ arrival. They don’t have to wait long. Drawn by the smell of pancakes and coffee Cas trudges in, hair a complete mess and bags under half closed eyes. He heads straight for the coffee maker, as Dean had known he would.
Maybe he’ll be okay.
Cas’ lips twitch slightly, as if he’d been expecting that response.
“I’m sorry, I’ll be good.” Dean grins, excitement making his hands shake. He wants nothing more than to tackle his boyfriend -
At forty two years old he’s sat on a bench in the woods in a light snowfall with his boyfriend, and there’s nowhere he’d rather be.
He’s slow to get out of bed, reluctant to leave Castiel’s arms, but eventually they’re walking down the hallway in their pyjamas, joint hands swinging between them. Castiel’s easy smile stays on his lips the whole way to the kitchen, and if Dean wasn’t so hopelessly in love he’d be a little embarrassed that he watches his boyfriend more than he watches where he’s walking.
He’d said.
“I just have one thing to say, and then I promise I’ll drop it and never bring it up again.”
Dean turns and blows out the candle with a flustered laugh, hoping nobody will comment on the slight flush in his cheeks, and he watches with undisguised affection as Castiel slices up the pie and dishes it onto plates. While he works Sam stands and fetches a tub of vanilla ice cream from the freezer, and Eileen grabs a tray of rice krispies from the fridge.
“Is it because of dad?” Sam asks slowly. He doesn’t voice it, but the unspoken
“I love you.”
“What about him?” Dean asks tersely.
~~~~~
“I did. I know you’ve never been, so I thought-” Castiel doesn’t even get to finish his sentence as Dean leans across the space separating them to capture the ex-angels lips in a kiss. Castiel doesn’t hesitate to kiss back, tipping his head slightly into it.
“Dean.” He growls, and Dean is abruptly taken back to the night almost thirteen years ago when he’d awoken from his first dream about Cas to find the angel seated on the edge of his bed.
That’s exactly what he’d meant.
but he doesn’t know how, doesn’t know what he can do. Billie is going to kill them- she’s going to kill them and it’s Dean’s fault- Dean’s going to watch Cas die and it's
“I didn’t know he said that.” He admits, and Dean’s only response is to nod once. “I won’t force you to keep talking about this, but I just want you to know that I love you, and I would never judge you, Dean.”
It takes Sam a long time to bring it up; he doesn’t want to fight with Dean again, and it didn’t go well the last time he brought up a potential boyfriend. He doesn’t want to fight, but he wants Dean to be happy and it isn’t hard to see that he’s completely gone on Cas- it’s even easier to see that Cas is gone on him. He knows a little bit of why Dean denies these things -he knows their dad was very opinionated about same sex couples- but he wants to make sure Dean knows that he’s safe.
The boy was named Stan, and he was in all of Dean’s classes, and he was
He’s going to shatter, and he’s not sure he’ll ever recover.
“You changed me, Dean.” Cas smiles, and the floor falls away from Dean’s feet.
Cas chokes and drops his mug, and Sam screeches in alarm and leaps up to move the books and his laptop before they can get wet with coffee. Eileen rushes to help, even as she laughs to herself and eyes the other two men in the room. Dean’s face burns hot as he watches them.
They order takeout for dinner, choosing chinese from the place Dean likes in town. He watches, chest warm with affection as Eileen laughs and swats Sam’s fingers away from stealing the last chicken ball on her plate, belting out a laugh of his own as she distracts his brother with a kiss and deftly steals the last half of his eggroll. Sam squawks a bewildered protest and Jack throws his head back and laughs.
“I cared about you.”
~~~~~
~~~~~
“I don’t like men, Sam!” Dean snaps, hand slamming down onto the surface of the table so fast it knocks over his empty beer bottle. Sam doesn’t react, allowing Dean to calm slightly before he replies.
“Okay. I’ll meet you in the car?”
That becomes their morning ritual. Every day Cas is greeted with fresh coffee and a soft ‘morning sunshine’, and every day Dean is rewarded with a shy smile and a ‘good morning Dean’.
It’s of the utmost importance to him that Dean knows that nobody in their family shares John’s close-minded beliefs and all love him unconditionally.
“Thank you.”
“Cool.” Cas rasps, and Dean flees.
“Yeah, well, probably going to die tomorrow, so.” Dean says slowly, and Cas’ head tilts.
human being I will ever know.”
~~~~~
“I love you.”
God, Dean can’t breathe- he can’t breathe, his heart is pounding and his hands are shaking. His mind is screaming at him, a steady mantra of
Jody takes the other recliner and claims the white fleece blanket draped over the back of it, and Sam and Eileen take the couch, snuggling together under the burgundy blanket folded at the far end of the couch. They toss on Tombstone -shut up it’s his birthday- and the giddy smile doesn’t leave his lips all the while. Halfway through the movie Castiel begins to nod off, head tipping more fully against Dean’s, and Dean wordlessly holds a hand out to Sam in request of a blanket.
“Somewhere in mind?”
“I love you too.” He says, and he falls back into Cas, kissing away the beaming smile on his boyfriend's lips.
~~~~~
“You know,” Cas continues, and on auto pilot Dean takes a step closer. “Ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell… Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared.”
“Hello, Dean.”
When their skates are once more hanging over their shoulders they head back up the path to baby.
and he’s going to be riding high for days.
Second, Sam asks Dean to toss him an avocado, and to put an english muffin in the toaster for Eileen.
He yawns, stretching his arms over his head as he waits for Dean. Once his fiance is standing Castiel presses a soft kiss to his lips, fingers tangling with Dean’s once more as he heads for the door, gently tugging Dean along with him.
Affection warms his chest once again as he feels relief -not for the first time- that despite becoming God, he’s still the same boy he was before. He doesn’t hesitate to heap his plate full of the breakfast goodies they’d spoiled him with, listening attentively to the conversation flowing around him as he stuffs his face.
~~~~~
Once the chinese food is thoroughly demolished and Dean has enlisted Castiel’s help to pack away the miniscule amount of leftovers -and they’ve stolen a few kisses behind the cover of the fridge door- Castiel sends Dean back to the table alone with the promises of a surprise.
He’s no stranger to the words at this point; while Castiel had initially expected hesitance he had been met with open honesty. While the words used to be whispered between them, not meant for others ears, Dean had quickly begun tossing them out into the open whenever Castiel did something particularly endearing or Dean just felt like he deserved to know.
“A few days ago.” Castiel says honestly, closing the trunk before offering his hand to Dean. He doesn’t hesitate to slot their fingers together, falling into step next to him as they walk toward the path that leads down to the frozen pond. “I told Sam that I wanted to take you, so he helped me find some skates.”
wrong with you.”
Despite the trees towering on both sides of the path this bench has a clear view to the pond they’d just been skating on, giving them the perfect view of the sunset. Dean’s eyes light up and he leans eagerly into Castiel’s side when the man lifts his arm in offering.
“Here you go, sunshine.”
“Yes.”
“Come in.” Dean calls.
“Cas?”
“Good luck.”
“Please.”
They don’t even get to leave Sioux Falls until after midnight- almost one, at least.
“What are you talking about, man?”
Dean eagerly climbs out of Baby and stretches his arms over his head before turning to watch his boyfriend, following the movement of Castiel’s arms as he mimics Dean’s stretch. Now that they’ve reached their destination a fresh wave of appreciation for his boyfriend washes over Dean.
It’s scary at first- Dean’s anxiety is through the roof for the first hour or so. Bit by bit, though, Cas calms him down and reassures him, and when Dean snuggles himself into Cas’ arms he realizes Cas is right- there was nothing to be afraid of. When they fall asleep Dean is wrapped in Cas’ arms, and he feels safer than he ever remembers being. Cas’ arms are warm and secure, and Dean knows he’s never been safer than he is in that moment.
Dean is clearly struggling with how to handle this conversation. His brain is spinning a million miles a second, wondering where this conversation is going and simultaneously praying for a way out of it.
Castiel wasn’t stupid.  He knew exactly how Dean longed for him – his longing had been a pressing ache, tightening around his chest for years, as insistent and unrelenting as the most vulgar of the Righteous Man’s more verbal prayers.  He was furthermore aware of Sam’s thoughts on the subject (Sam wasn’t nearly as good at hiding his eyerolls as he thought).  However, after eight years in the acquaintance of Dean Winchester, Castiel also knew just how deeply the strains of self-loathing, fear of intimacy, and internalized homophobia ran.
Castiel hesitantly opened eyes, then yelped and turned his head just in time to avoid being elbowed in the face as Dean’s arm crashed to the floor, leaving Dean’s face suspended a mere five inches above Castiel’s.
hungover, but the throbbing in his head and churning in his stomach seemed unimportant when pinned under the man’s scrutiny.  He cleared his throat and tried again.
Dean smiled again at Blueberry.  “Let’s get you some hay, Miss Blueberry, yes?  And a sandwich for me, and—”
“Classy.”  Benny growled.  Dean gave a half-hearted shrug.
Lastly, this might not be the most appropriate place for it, but all my love goes to the victims of Hurricane Maria and the Las Vegas Shooting.  I am outraged on the behalf of everyone who has been affected by these events, and ashamed of our government for its responses to both.
, coffee splattering.  Dean jumped and flinched back from eyes that were now glaring at him for the first time since they had sat down.  “I sure as hell ain’t happy with her right now, but we both knew this was coming and we both let it happen.  And you know Andrea, Dean.  After everything she’s done, she deserves more than you callin’ her a bitch.”
“What do I always do?  Told him to stuff it and got shitfaced.” Dean snapped, then mentally slapped himself.  “Sorry.”
“Were you that worried I wouldn’t like it?” he asked, amused.  Cas scowled.
I'm on vacation right now with my family, so things have been rough, but HERE, HAVE A CHAPTER FROM CAS'S POINT OF VIEW!  Gosh, Pixie Gabe the PocketMuse (TM) would not leave me alone for this one!
, only to be followed by bouts of head-down, eyes-averted, hunched-shoulders withdrawal.
.  Dean had snorted despite himself and taken the book down.  A crease had appeared between his eyes at the absurdity of the summary on the back cover, before he had decided that he might as well, and brought it over for approval.  Ellen had raised her brows a bit at the pessimistic title, but had agreed to put the book on her card.
EDIT 7/17/17:
A great deal of Dean’s hesitancy to pursue a relationship, he attributed to the pain of the loss of Mary.  Castiel had rarely been in the presence of both Mary and Dean at the same time, but he had been peripherally aware of the tension that had only just begun to be resolved when Lucifer dragged her through the portal.  Jack was as of yet unable to consciously replicate the previous effects of his instinctual magic and reopen the portal, and both Sam and Dean, in a show of bittersweet maturity, refused to take out their frustration on Jack.
Dean’s throat unexpectedly tightened at this unchecked show of support from a complete stranger.  True, had had played Genital Tetris with this stranger last night, but Castiel didn’t know anything about Dean, and yet he still seemed to wholeheartedly believe in him.  Dean stared down at his plate, biting his lip.
All right, let's go!  Now up:  more Dean backstory! (after this, a chapter from Cas's POV, and then things will FINALLY start to move forward!)
Cas’s eyes twinkled.  “I know,”
“You—you have the hiccups, Cas, oh my god,” Dean had barely managed to choke out before pitching sideways onto the carpet, mercifully avoiding the stain, and dissolving into giggles and half-hearted exclamations of “you fuckin’ scared me half to death, you asshole!”
Finally settled at the kitchen table, Dean watched warily as Benny stirred four spoons of sugar into his coffee.  Wisely, he withheld his comments.  That was, in until Benny dropped his spoon and swore gratingly in French.
Benny waved a dismissive hand.  “So you went out, got drunk, and got laid?”
1)  Bert and Ernie are gay.
“Seeing as we crossed the line into friendship many months ago, I’m more worried at your apparent embarrassment, although I can’t fathom why for a simple slip of the tongue.  Dean, surely you can’t think I believed you were serious?”
Sam had taken Jack to town that day, because “he needs to meet people his own age” (“He’s nine weeks old, Sammy!”  “You know what I mean!”).  Dean and Castiel had been left to tend to the house.  Castiel had been on his hands and knees, attempting to remove a stubborn stain from the living room carpet and wishing he still had the power to
“They’re gone.”
“Rosemary and parmesan focaccia, this time,” Cas grinned. “My homemade masterpiece awaits, peasants!”
Because standing before him, back to the door, was the most beautiful ass Dean had ever seen.
“What do you do all day, then, if not crunch numbers?” Castiel asked with a raised eyebrow.
If Sam ever found out that Dean had drunk
It was while Dean had been reading book eleven,
“I’ll be right there.”
“What the fuck.”
A quick peek into the bathroom revealed no hints about his host’s whereabouts, and after quickly using the facilities himself, Dean slowly and carefully finished dressing as silently as he could manage, cursing himself under his breath when he knocked over a wicker laundry basket.  Because his suburban, bee-keeping, gay mystery lover had a
“C’mon, Benny.  Talk to me, man.”  Benny blew out a breath and gulped at his coffee, wincing again.  Dean barely restrained himself from rolling his eyes a second time.
“Fuck, I’m glad that’s over,” Cas groaned.
“Thank you, I will.”
4)  Some people are meant to be together forever.
as he had lain there with his siblings, tears of hysteria streaming down all three of their faces.   Something had finally,
“History?”  Dean pursed his lips and looked away.
He hoped.
Eventually, the tears faded, and aside from the occasional sniffle, Benny just slouched with his face buried in Dean’s shirt, sagged against his friend.  Dean started casting about for a way to lighten the mood.
“How do you like your eggs?” he intoned in the same deep, gravelly voice that Dean hazily remembered whispering filth into his ear the night before.
“—I think you’d be very good with children!”
Dean looked on with pride as the representatives from Product, including Zachariah, all gave their approval for the designs to be handed off to Dean’s team.  One by one, said their goodbyes and left the zoom meeting, Dean and Castiel’s video thumbnails growing larger and larger until each of them took up half the screen.
Castiel’s pinched brows had now turned upwards, lips parted in concern.  Dean dragged a hand down his face.
“There’s my girl!  There’s my Blueberry!” cooed Cas through the camera.  Dean’s heart gave a little flutter that had nothing to do with how Blueberry was now stretching up on her hind legs to nibble at his face.  He scritched his sweet girl behind the ears as she nuzzled him, all the while melting under Castiel’s besotted gaze.
There are rules, and there are Rules, profound truths that none can dispute, yet everyone has seen ripped to shreds at least once.  No one truly knows where they came from, and no one understands what to do when one such Rule is broken immediately before them.  Numbering amongst such brittle, ubiquitous rules are:
Lips, hot and sweet, pressed gently against Castiel’s.  He, too, allowed his eyes to fall shut before moving against Dean, slotting their lips together in a soft caress.  Slowly, slowly, they moved together, the kiss building in passion as it became increasingly clear that neither was about to withdraw.  Dean’s hands gently cupped Castiel’s face for the second time that day, the lightness of his touch belying the thirst with which he sucked at Castiel’s bottom lip and licked at the seam of his mouth.  Castiel lifted his arms from the floor and clutched one arm around Dean’s shoulders and dug the other into his hair with a fervor that elicited a gasp and a moan from the man above him.  Castiel nibbled lightly at Dean’s lips and sighed against him in bliss.  Again and again, their lips chased each other, each press seeming to hum,
“Dean!”
“Hey, Cas?”
Dean’s senses were assaulted by an avalanche of the sights, sounds, and smells as his preoccupation with
“Um, yeah man, I, uh…”
be him, given I had to do half his job in addition to my own.”  He straightened up and leaned over his laptop on one elbow.  His smirk softened to a smaller, warm smile.  Dean rarely saw that smile emerge in group settings, but quarantine became just a bit less lonely every time Cas sent it his way.
Benny dug around in his cupboards for mugs while Dean set the coffeemaker to work, all while grumbling about “fancy-ass hippy machines.”  At least Benny used his own coffee beans, and not that crap in the little plastic cups.
.  Great, so the one guy who managed to circumvent Dean’s self-imposed closed-for-assfucking embargo also apparently had his life together enough that he went around buying things like
“Look, Cas, I had a great time, but I really do have to go now.”  Cas’s face fell so quickly it would have been comical, if Dean hadn’t felt so guilty.  “Not that I want to,” because he really didn’t, “but, um…I can’t…”
The man turned.
Blue eyes met green, snapping together with a magnetic pull, and held.
Which were
A smile slipped its way around Dean’s defenses before he could lock in his poker face.  “Yeah, I guess so.”
Dean’s eyes had been on Castiel’s mouth, but they now rose to meet his eyes once more.  Their gazes locked, and—and years may have gone by outside their sphere of awareness, the apocalypse may have finally come to pass, and neither would have noticed.  Castiel could have remained drifting in a jade sea for eons.  Neither seemed inclined to move, just quietly basking in the warmth of each other’s eyes.
that had threatened to leave his tongue (Ellen glaring over Dean’s head at him had helped).
Cocooned between them, quite worn out, Dean had sleepily asked if he could start referring to the two of them as his parents.  Not “Mom” and “Dad,” since those monikers would forever be associated with Mary and John Winchester, but “Ma” and “Pops,” perhaps?
the damned thing off, while Dean had fussed about in the kitchen.  That had been fifteen minutes ago.
“I ate a few saltines and had some Excedrin.  Coconut water, too, because of the electrolytes.  It always makes me feel better.  I would have offered you some as well, but not everyone likes it, so I figured orange juice was a safer bet, especially considering you looked like you were about to fall over.  I didn’t want to waste time trying to figure out your preferences.”
manager, often gave Cas product requirements that were so disjointed for the sake of being "scrappy" and "agile" that Cas was left scrambling.  Dean privately thought that Zachariah had no idea what either “scrappy” or “agile” actually meant.  In fact, he strongly suspected that Zachariah had just come across the terms in some asshole’s keynote speech at such-and-such conference, and had (correctly) identified them as buzzwords he could leverage to get away with shoddy work, while passing all the real wrangling on to Cas.
As far as the self-loathing and fear of intimacy went, Castiel was fairly certain that they had begun to unravel during the weeks after his resurrection; enforced domesticity with a powerful being that had quickly imprinted on all three men like a duckling to its mother did wonders for one’s self esteem.  Jack’s adoring face when Dean had gently placed a secondhand guitar from a thrift shop in town into his hands and demonstrated correct finger placement had coaxed from him a smile that was more subdued, yet no less brilliant in its joy.  Castiel supposed that such innocent love would be good for anyone’s self-image.  Indeed, it was difficult to berate himself for his numerous failings throughout the years when Jack’s sleepy
*peeks at y'all from between my fingers*
But how was this even going to work?  How was Dean going to be able to hang out with the guy without randomly thinking about what it might feel to stick is tongue in Cas’s ass?  Or remembering just how
Cas smiled self-deprecatingly.  “Perhaps because we’ve already seen each other drunk and naked, but I’ve rather forgotten to be nervous and awkward around you.  Perhaps we skipped past it all while drunk.”  He glanced up and Dean from under his eyelashes.  “It seems that you put me quite at ease.”
“Oh, certainly not.”
Castiel’s body jolted below Dean’s, destabilizing Dean’s perch over Castiel and causing his arms to collapse further down, bringing his face ever closer.
Benny pursed his lips.  “Dick.”
It is courtesy of all of you, and Pixie Gabe, that this has now become a multi-chapter fic.
“It wasn’t a big deal, just the same old crap.”
Dean tried again.  “Listen, dude…” and he trailed off again.  “Um…I’m really sorry about this, but I was really drunk last night, so I’m a little…fuzzy?  Some of the details, just…” the man was frowning at him again.
into it.  Maybe.
“Benny?”
“Well then,” Cas laughed, leaning forward conspiratorially and dropping his voice to a whisper, “we must ensure that Sam never knows.”
And that had been that.  Dean had gotten a Bachelor’s Degree in business management, which he had put to work at Bobby’s garage.  And hell, he loved working as a mechanic, he really did, but…he didn’t want to do it every day for the rest of his life.  It had been two years before he had realized that Gordon’s

“This isn’t funny, Dean!”  Castiel growled menacingly, only to punctuate his declaration with another squeaking
“I know.”

“It’s fine, Pops let me off early.”
“He does know that Sam is in law school, right?”
Not that Dean thought that his friends and family wouldn’t be supportive – far from it.  Sammy would in all likelihood pull out the puppy eyes and try to talk about
“She just called to end it.  She’s uh...she’s got someone new.”  Dean choked on his coffee.

The man was still humming in a low gravelly voice, barely audible over the sizzle of the bacon (and really, how had Dean not smelled that coming down the hall?!) swinging his hips in a happy little dance to the tune, and Dean found himself watching him sway, mesmerized.  Some part of his brain was still clamoring that he needed to
“He was here yesterday, wasn’t he?  Shit, brother, I forgot--”  Dean waved him off before wringing the washcloth out over the sink.
Dean smiled bitterly.  “I know.”
“Hm?”  Dean met his eyes sheepishly.
Castiel, in all his previous experiences as a human, had somehow managed to avoid the peculiar, ubiquitous, and downright
Dean chuckled. “You said it, buddy. Honestly, I think even Zack was surprised at how smoothly that went.”

“—just answered your questions—”
“Mr. Fancypants can go enjoy his quarantine focaccia—”
The next day, Ellen had approached Dean immediately after breakfast and told him to put on something nicer than his usual playclothes and meet her out by the car.  Dean, intrigued and slightly wary, had dressed himself in the new clothes that Bobby had bought for them the day after they had arrived and bundled himself down to the garage.  The ride to Downtown Lawrence had been filled with worry, which had immediately dispelled into confusion when they had pulled into the parking lot of the Lawrence Public Library.  From there, Ellen had ushered a subdued Dean into the building and parked him in the Children’s Section with firm orders to pick something.
Dean’s eyes snapped up to lock on a startled electric blue gaze, all previous contentedness forgotten as every fear and insecurity came tumbling back with a roar.  Rule Number Four was dying a screaming death, and yet he found himself unable to move, pinned under the scrutiny of those terrifyingly beautiful eyes.  He was dimly aware of the heat rising to his cheeks, and he yanked his gaze downward, revealing a yet more acres of toned, unfairly beautiful skin.  He blushed harder, and looked back up.
There are rules, simple rules, that govern the universe.  Some are instinctively known to us, while others form slowly, accumulated through years of experience and adhering to the edges of our minds like sediment deposits on the banks of a river.  Still others hit us when we least expect it, with all the forewarning of having an octopus dropped on one’s head from a great height.

Dean did not look up.
“You get any snot on this shirt, I’ll stuff your newsboy hat up your ass.”
“Fresh-baked, I promise.”
“No, yeah, I did!”  Dean all but yelped, before blushing yet
Dean’s mind dredged up the memory of Cas drunkenly lipping at his neck, and he felt his face burn.
He had been right; Dean was feeling a little better.  He supposed that the sugar in the orange juice had done the trick, remembering Ellen once mentioning something about sugar being good for shock.  He was still hungover, for certain, but the blue-gaze-induced fuzziness and general what-the-fuckery had cleared up considerably.

ONWARD
Dean had a few cardinal rules.  Over the years, he hadn’t always been a model citizen, and some of the habits he had picked up from life with his dad had been difficult to shake.  Still, there were Four Cardinal Rules that Dean had promised himself he would always abide by, and made sure to hammer into Sam and Jo’s heads at the first available opportunity:
“It’s okay, no need to rush—“
A bump by Dean’s ankle had him grinning down at a storm-grey bunny who’d found her way into the living room.  No doubt she had come as soon as she’d heard Castiel laugh.
“You would be so lucky!”
It had been easier for nine-year-old Dean to justify reading if he was reading out loud to his baby brother and new baby sister, since when he had read quietly to himself, he hadn’t been able to drown out the vague echo of his father’s voice, growling at him to
“Okay, okay!  Sorry, shutting up now!”  Dean wiped the tears from his eyes, and sighed, gazing across the scant two feet of space between them, the merriment still present in his eyes.
“My…my hiccups.”
“—I mean, to Sammy or Eileen or Sadie, sure, but—”

“Uh-huh.”
at him from his place at the stove.
From that point on, however, Dean would forever associate the clarity of every
Now, as Benny and Dean entered the kitchen, Dean did a cursory sweep of the living area and winced.  Everything was spotless.
At first, Ellen and Bobby, while listening in to these storytime sessions, had worried that the pessimistic nature of these books would sink Dean further into his own head.  However, after a time, it seemed as if they had done the opposite.  The lesson Dean had seemed to be taking from the trials of the Baudelaires was that
Sam was irritated, Castiel knew.  Late at night, after reading Jack’s bedtime story and tucking him in with a kiss to the forehead, he would hear the brothers’ voices drifting up, Sam’s tone so clear that Castiel could easily picture its accompanying facial expression.  He was fairly certain Dean called it “bitchface,” but he wasn’t quite sure why.  Nevertheless, various phrases would float up the stairs as Castiel crossed the hall back to his bedroom every night, phrases like “another chance,” “know he feels the same,” and “don’t care that he’s a guy.”
, but a book on display had caught his eye:
“Benny…”  Benny kept looking at his nails.  “Who is she with?”
The man squinted again, then chuckled.  “You don’t recall my name because I never gave it to you.  We were a bit preoccupied at the time.”  A quirk of the eyebrow.  “Nor did you give me yours, although I was hoping to have that honor now?”  Almost shyly, the man glanced down at the eggs, and flicked his eyes back up with a quirk of his mouth. “I’m Castiel.”
Within the last few years, however, Castiel had noticed something of a change in Dean’s hypermasculine persona.  Indeed, it had seemed that the domesticity afforded by both the bunker and their little house on the shore allowed Dean to relax somewhat, a few softer edges appearing in his demeanor – a more easy smile for Sammy, a quick kiss on the forehead for Jack, an arm thrown over Cas’s shoulder as they watched TV from the couch…but other times, Dean seemed to catch himself in his behavior and recoil, as if terrified of reprimand.  When no insults or accusations would fall, and with Sam and Jack clearly basking in the extra affection, Dean would slowly relax again, making eye contact and straightening his stance.  He would once again take to bumping shoulders with Castiel, casually resting a hand on his lower back, and otherwise quietly offering small touches as if reassuring himself that Castiel was truly alive and well.  So it had gone for the past nine weeks, with Dean still occasionally closing off in fear, but always returning and becoming more open and more intimate in his affection for his friend.
"How did that happen?“
Castiel was looking at him with tears and then finally decided to close the distance between them. It semmed like the whole world stopped when they kissed. Castiels lips worked so perfectly with Deans, their bodies fitted perfectly with eachother, almost as if they were made for eachother. Dean couldn't bealive this was happening, he felt like the luckiest son of a bitch ever. And he really was. They kissed for what seemed like hours. When they finally stopped they were both out of breath, looking at eachother with so much love.
"Bitch“ Dean muttered setting the picture in its place.
"Yes, I know havent been home in a long time but I don't have amnesia idiot“
Dean starts driving, praying that his friend is somewhere in this heaven. After what seems like hours he arrives at the bunker, it's the same as it is on earth. He goes to his own room, every picture is exactly where it should be, damn it even Deans "dead men" robe is there. But his friend is nowhere to be seen. So he starts praying, he sits quietly on his bed. Praying to his friend, wondering if he would show up.
with that he ended the call and threw the phone on the sit beside him.
He tells the story of how they went on a hunt and a rusty nail did the rest of the job. In return Castiel told him how jack rescued him from the empty. He made a deal with the empty. Castiel woud be alive and in return Jack would make the emtpy silent again. Which he did and now he was here, alive and well.
He tried sleeping and thinking about Cassie. His new girlfriend, but he knew the feelings he had for her weren't real. They were just a ghost of the feelings he used to have for a different Cas. But she is pretty and she is there for him whenever he needs someone. How could he not resist? But that didn't help, so he packed his bags and next thing he knew he was ona road trip to his home. His phone ringed and he looked it. The name Mom flashed across the screen and he answered a small smile playing on his lips.
"I didn't think it would be okay, considering how we left things" the room is quiet after that both of them remembering that night and how heartbroken and sad Dean was left. Sitting against the wall and just crying the whole night. "But it's okay, I thought about it. Happines isn't in the having it's in the saying it" he repets himsefl ",so it's okay if you don't feel the same way"
his mother quietly yelled at him.
"Night, bitch“
Dean felt something he hasn't felt in a long time. Pure happinnes. And he was so glad he got to experince that with the love of his life.
"Yeah“ they both just smiled at eachother. Dean cleaned after himself while Sam drank the juice.
he answered honestly. He knew that he had to go back, he had to see him one last time before he gets married. He needed to see those big blue eyes and feels those hands on his body.
So many things he coud've said but didin't. Overwhelmed that his feelings could maybe be returned he was in shock. Standing there listening to the blue eyed man listing all these wonderfull things about Dean made his brain broken. He couldn't believe what he was hearning. So he did the best he could, but the thought that he didn't get to say it back haunts him every night. The thought that he died without hearing dean say he loves him to, makes him sick.
"Wow, why didn't you come back?" asks Dean kind of already knowing the answer. Dean wasn't really responding well or really responding to Castiels love confession.
After that they talked. A lot. Few days later he was holding Castiel's hand everywhere he went. He called him his boyfriend and showed him off everywhere. When univeristy happended they had a lot of problems. Deans jelousy and Castiels obliviousness to other people flirting resulted in a lot of fights. In the end they were able to talk it out. The best part about their relantionship was that they could grow as people. They changed so much but in a good way. Dean learned how to control his anger and to talk things before lashing out and Castiel learned to be more free and open to the world. But in the end Deans mind and fear drove him to do the last thing he ever imagined to do but he did it. Now he had to deal with the consequences like a grown person.
"You know where your room is?“
"Sure you won't get bored of me?"
"I'm sorry but I honestly didn't know how to tell you and you never wanted to talk about Cas or his family memebers so I kept my mouth shut. And it's not like we talked everyday anyway“ he said putting the dishes into the sink helping himself to some orange juice from the frigde.
"So you two are like a couple or what?“
Dean closed his eyes for a second remembering that day. He thought about it everyday, it never faded from his mind. He started drinking because of it, well he always drunk a little bit to much. But he realised that if he drank himself to oblivion he wouldn't think about it. So for the majority of nights he would be drunk. It was the only way for his head to stop reliving that day so he could fall asleep.
"In town“  Sam said getting himself some cereal. "With Gabe" he whispered but Dean still heard him. At first he didn't know how to respond, he didn't even know Sam knew Gabe. He barely knew Gabe. I mean he knew who he was and he talked to him a few time but neither of them had any kind of deeper connection the short man.
"Night, jerk“
"Gabe as in Castiels older brother Gabe?“ Sam just nodded.
"Jerk“ Sam said hugging him. Dean hugged him back thigtly. They stood like that for a couple of moments.  Truth to be told he missed Sam and he missed this place. Not that he would ever tell him. that
"Yeah“
his mom whispered and the small smile fell from his face replaced by a small frown. Just the thought of that ring on Castiel's hand made his stomach turn upside down. He didn't like thinking about it.
he said, slowing the car a little so that he doesn't crash while talking on the phone. He knew that it wasn't smart but he couldn't stop now than he was so close.
Dean looked at him with kind of wide eyes.
"Where do you live though?“
"Thanks for telling me before, really appricate that“ Dean said moving the pie away.
Soft music coming from the radio and lightsfrom the other cars on the street were the only things keeping Dean awake at the moment. He has been travelling for nearly 18 hours straight but he had to. As soon as he heared the news, he packed his things and started driving. He left his bussines to be run by Garth, an old friend. He was travelling from California all the way back to Lawrence. A place he used to call home. He hasn't been there sence 2010. Not that he didn't want to go, he wanted to so bad but couldn't. That place helds too many memorios and he felt as though they might crush him. But when Sam called him last night and casually told him that Cas has a fiance. He couldn't stop thinking about it.
"Yes, but now we have a forever" says Cas, turning his head to look at Dean. Dean could look at those eyes forever and never get bored.
Dean had his first crush when he was seven years old. He’d met a little girl named Susan at one of the playgrounds in Sioux Falls one of the many times he’d been left with Sam at Bobby’s house so their dad could go on a hunt. When John had finally come home Dean had told him all about Susan -including that she liked him too and said he was cute- and John had laughed.
Dean spends most of the drive watching his boyfriend and loudly singing along with him - even when the tape ends and the radio takes over and All Out Of Love comes on. Not that he would ever admit that to Sam.
Dean had known several things at a very young age; Sam was his priority no matter what. Dad didn’t like to be bugged when he got home from a hunt or he’d get angry.
At that Dean manages a soft, strained laugh.
Sam has his head thrown back as he laughs at Cas’ horrible accent, and Cas is squinting at him even as he hides a smile into his coffee. Eileen is shaking her head in disapproval, and Dean thinks that maybe Cas was onto something. Maybe he was right.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
And when he had? He’d received the beating of his life, and they’d been on the road by morning, John’s angry cusses ringing in Dean’s ears as Sam had sobbed next to him in the backseat with hands covered in Dean’s blood.
With a defeated sigh Cas sags back into his chair. His newly-human body twinges in protest at the angle, but he doesn’t move.
“There’s nothing wrong with-”
For the first time, Dean believes wholeheartedly that he’s going to be okay.
“But I think I know… I think I know now. Happiness isn’t in the having, it’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.”
Some days are easier than others, but he’s doing it. The more comfortable he gets with himself, the more casual intimacy he introduces between himself and Cas.
“C’mere.” Cas demands, patting the bed next to him, and Dean doesn’t have to be told twice.
“I love you.” Cas says earnestly, voice wrecked, and Dean’s heart trips over itself again.
“I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be? What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer, because the one thing I want…” Cas’ voice falters as their gazes lock, and fear paralyzes Dean.
Dean is roused slowly by the feeling of fingers gently carding through his hair. His fingers flex slightly under his pillow, searching for a gun that isn’t there anymore, but at Castiel’s soft chuckle his entire body relaxes back into his memory foam. A small smile pulls at his lips and he sighs heavily through his nose, wiggling slightly so his back is flush to Castiel’s chest.
He buries his wrongness in women and whiskey.
“Goodnight, Jack.”
“Oh.” Sam says easily. He pauses, looking down at his fries. “I guess I just thought that- well, I guess it doesn’t matter.”
Time flies by and soon enough Castiel is pulling Baby into a parking lot, a few other cars dotting the space. He parks and flicks the key to turn her off before he turns his attention upon Dean. Dean’s eyes are already upon him, wide and excited, a beaming smile on his lips.
For most of Dean’s life he’d held back some aspect of himself- at a young age he’d forced himself to grow up and act like his dad, even when he wanted more than anything to just lie on the couch in his pyjamas watching Scooby Doo. He had to take care of Sam. He didn’t want his dad to think he wasn’t responsible- didn’t want his dad to be disappointed in him. Dean wanted his dad to love him- to be proud of him. He didn’t resent his childhood -he’ll always be proud of the man Sam had grown up to be, especially knowing that a lot of it was
Dean’s eyes widen slightly as he looks down the path, eyes flicking upward when snow begins lightly falling. His breath catches in his chest for a moment as the reality of the situation hits him- he’d never thought he could have this. Never thought he’d let himself have this. He wishes more than anything he could go back and tell his seventeen year old self that it would be okay- that there was nothing wrong with him. That one day he’ll wake up every morning wrapped in his boyfriend’s arms and know that John was wrong about him.
Sam’s expression softens, heartbreak clear in his eyes. Behind that all is a fiery storm of rage on his brother's behalf.
Dean is in love with his best friend.
“I scared him off.”
“Thanks, Sam.”
Cas’ lips are soft and full, and his lower lip easily fits itself between Dean’s lips. Dean whimpers softly, heart tripping over itself as warmth sears through his veins, and he presses deeper into the kiss. Strong, warm and calloused hands find his hips to squeeze gently.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Jesus, I didn’t say you were! I was just asking a question!”
He’s unsurprised by that -Cas is definitely not a morning person- so he takes this moment to admire his boyfriend. In their sleep they’d slightly altered their positions, resulting in them laying face to face on the same pillow. Cas’ breaths are soft, and blow gently across Dean’s lips.
Dean can hardly breathe and his eyes are stinging with unshed tears as he croaks a feeble attempt at a response.
So wrapped up in his fiance it takes him longer than it normally would to realize that all of the lights in the bunker are off.
He excuses himself a moment later, fleeing briskly to his room. That was more than good enough- he was honest without having to fully admit to anything. Without having to spell out just how awful he is.
“So if I asked you to be my boyfriend?”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” He dares to whisper, and Cas smiles so apologetically that Dean chokes on his breath.
Castiel doesn’t relinquish his hold on Dean’s hand when the skates are discarded in the trunk, swapping the skates for a small bag before he closes the trunk and flashes a smile at his boyfriend. Happy to go with the flow Dean lets Castiel pull him across the parking lot to a walking trail. They only walk for about fifteen minutes before they happen upon a bench and Castiel is guiding Dean to sit on it.
“But he’s--”
A tentative hand on his had him looking back up into worried blue eyes.  “Did I upset you?” Castiel asked softly.  Dean grimaced and quickly shook his head.

Back when he was with Gordon…well, the man had laughed when Dean had confessed that he had been thinking about switching majors to get a teaching certificate during his undergrad.
Also, please let me know if there are any inaccuracies.  I did my best, guys, I'm sorry!
The man (

human, with all the indignities that ensued, including a new and outright baffling experience.
The man moved with an easy grace, gesturing towards the stove with his right hand, which Dean belatedly realized was still holding a pair of tongs.
, he had said,
Dean stared.  Cas was still looking at him earnestly, his small, warm smile on his lips, a touch of pink over his cheeks the only indication that this wasn’t a casual invitation.
The man hadn’t moved yet, apparently still frozen in surprise.  Now that the initial shock had worn off, Dean examined the not-quite stranger’s face.  Dark stubble dotted an angular jaw and slightly cleft chin.  Those stunning eyes that had held Dean rooted to the spot sat above high, sculpted cheekbones, a narrow, slightly aquiline nose, and plush, chapped lips.  A tongue peeked out to wet the bottom lip, and then Dean watched, fascinated, as a wide, gummy smile slowly crept onto the man’s face, eyes crinkling, his entire being exuding warmth.  It was, Dean thought faintly, like watching day break over a deep, vibrant sea.
“Everyone knows,” Dean mumbled against his neck between kisses and bites that had Castiel squirming, still pinned beneath Dean’s body, “you can get rid of hiccups,” sucking hard at Castiel’s throat, “by holding your breath.”
about Dean’s career prospects had been the exact same kind of shit that had chased him back into the closet – people thinking that because they knew one side of him, they could put him in a neat little box and wrap it up with string.  It had been a true epiphany the night he had realized, alone in his apartment and watching the Great British Baking show, of all things, that in the same way that he could be both a loud, brash mechanic with no patience for glitter and a panty-wearing, Dr. Sexy-watching bisexual man, he could also be both a skilled grease monkey and a second-grade teacher.  People could tell him that these facets of his personality were mutually exclusive if they wanted; he, in turn, could tell them to go fuck themselves.
“Here.”  The man had stopped before Dean and held out the glass of juice.  “Drink this.  It will make you feel better.”  Dean blinked, suddenly realizing that he was in fact quite thirsty, and gratefully accepted the glass.  The man watched with a soft smile as Dean downed the orange juice, quietly taking the glass from him when he was done and placing it in the sink.
.  After that fiasco with Gordon…but he didn’t want to think about that now.  Too much ugliness, too many memories…not to mention the stereotypes.  Dean knew that there was nothing wrong with being effeminate, for both men and women, but back during his tentative foray out of the closet, he had been flabbergasted by the assumptions made by strangers about his hobbies, personality, and even preferred sex positions.
4)  The morning after a drunken hookup is awkward as fuck.
Dean was going to tell him.  He was totally going to tell him, any minute now.  He’d look this man, Castiel, straight in the eye, and say
“Not that it makes it ok to molest you in your sleep but — yeah, guess the cat’s outta the bag with that one.”
Hesitantly, Cas reaches out and runs his fingertips along the midnight scruff of Dean’s jaw. Dean leans into it without thought, nuzzling against Cas’s palm. Cas swallows and says, “Do you like impact?”

Dean’s eyes go to the ground as soon as they walk in. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the hostess grabbing a couple of menus. “One dom, one sub today, sir?”
“Cool. Wanna grab some dinner?”
Cas reaches out but pulls back before he touches. “Please stand.”
doing if I tried, and Dean wants me to be happy, so it’s a win for both of us.
Even though he’s smiling, Dean’s heart sinks and his mouth goes dry. “Yeah? What’s up?” He’s proud that the words come out even instead of sounding terrified of another
“Look, that was
Cas falls into his arms. Dean is warm, strong, smells faintly of leather, and Cas is very, very sold on him.
“Good.” Cas stares at Dean for what seems like a long time, looking for something. “Can I kiss you?”
“Dominating you,” Cas says, looking somewhere over Dean’s left shoulder.
“You – how – ?”
“What is?” Cas says when Dean doesn’t continue.
I need a shower when I get home and then I’ll hop over if that’s cool
Cas rolls his eyes and gives a sharp pinch to Dean’s flank. Dean squeaks and jumps and scowls when Cas laughs. “Fine. I’d like to reward you for no reason in particular.”
Cas slips out of Dean’s sight before he swats Dean’s ass with the cane. It doesn’t hurt, but somehow it surprises Dean into a squeak that makes Cas laugh. “Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbles, relaxing back into the mattress. “Laugh it up.”
Cas looks startled, but they reach the front desk before he can respond. “Hey,” Dean says, flashing a smile to the redheaded beta behind the counter. “We’re with 42Star. A couple of rooms for Winchester and Novak.”

but he’s very very curious about this kinda beaten up dude that he bumps into in the bakery section
The canvas is big enough to be unwieldy as Dean maneuvers down the hall and into the living room. He tries not to be too dramatic as he turns it to face Cas, and he tries not to read too much into the way Cas’s eyes widen and mouth falls into a soft

Dean’s Heaven is all endless stretches of highway, mountains up ahead but never reached, diners with amazing pie and dingy hotel rooms on the side of the road. Cas rides in the passenger seat of the Impala in between battles and they eat pie and sometimes lay in the grass, just staring up at the night sky, making up constellations together.
Jimmy has imagined riding in the front seat of Dean’s monstrous car, though never with Sam ducking in between them from the back seat, pointing into a construction lot. “Did you see that? What the hell was that?”
Cas laughs. “I guess I’ll have to figure out how to request new bedding.”
Like always, he shakes it off and says, “I live to please, princess.”

“But you like it.”
Dean gapes at him.
What’s wrong is that Castiel had no idea he could do it before, but now he does, and it haunts him.
“If you touch me,” Cas says. “Just not — not the knot.”
“Dude, I’ll give you my number. In case you want to geek out with someone who won’t understand most of it.”

“You have a painting for me?” Cas says, almost sounding shy in his surprise.

Cas rolls his eyes. “No. I’ll grab the drinks and meet you outside.”
“I know you feel strongly about alphas invading omega spaces, and —”
In the end, Castiel convinces Dean. Dean will be back, Castiel says, in another thirty or forty or fifty years, and Castiel will be waiting.
I know ;)
“Me too,” Cas says. “But I’m not going to lose your friendship over a biological urge that can be dealt with in other ways.”
Dean spins to point his knife at Cas. “You know damn well I earned that.”

Cas is waiting at the kitchen island, typing on his phone with a pinch between his brow. As soon as the back door
Cas can barely see Dean in the glow from the numbers counting down on his phone. Dean brushes his fingers along Cas’s jaw and then kisses him, the same sort of soft barely-touch.
And their fearless leader, Dean, whose presence has Cas’s borrowed body reacting in ways he could not predict. Cas tried to ask Jimmy about it – it’s Jimmy’s DNA, after all, so maybe he had some insight – but Jimmy blushes crimson and changes the subject so rapidly it makes Cas’s head spin.
A moment later, his phone buzzes.
I could’ve been somebody.
“Cas.”
“Dean,” Cas says, so Dean looks up to see him smiling. He gestures with his chopsticks, which are effortly posed between his fingers. “Try this one first.”
Cas reaches out and brushes his fingertips along Dean’s jaw, almost like he’s not sure Dean is real. Dean knows the feeling and turns his head to nuzzle against Cas’s palm, hoping the touch of his submissive will help ground Cas again.
“Where are you taking me?” he says, finally turning to look at Dean.
A thunk as the paddle falls onto the counter, and then Cas is leaning over to kiss Dean’s temple, cheek, the corner of his mouth. “My good boy. Don’t apologize.” He strokes his fingers gently through Dean’s hair and asks, “Can you stand? I want to get you cleaned up and into bed for a bit of hardcore cuddling.”
he never wanted to kiss you so you pretend you don’t want to kiss him. that’s not what this is, you know that — it’s not like love stories start with a mostly-anonymous fuck, your face pressed into the wall in the public bathroom at a fancy hotel.
He’s never felt so helpless before- never felt so thoroughly devastated like this- he’s never felt like his insides have been scooped out with a melon baller. How is he supposed to go on knowing that Cas is dead? That Cas died because he loved Dean?
“It’s something I know I can’t have.”
Sam sighs softly, and Cas tilts his head. Sam jumps into an explanation before Cas has to ask.
Dean wants to scream. He wants to sob- he wants to wail his pain to the heavens. He can feel his heart breaking- he can feel his whole world falling apart with every word Cas speaks.
“Did he?” Cas murmurs, and Sam purses his lips.
“I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack.”
“Cas.” Dean huffs out, and Cas squeezes his hips tighter.
Castiel cooperates well enough when they get to their bedroom, allowing Dean to help him out of his jeans and sweaters before flopping onto the bed in only his boxers. He shuffles and wiggles until his head meets the pillows and Dean’s heart overflows with love. Castiel peeks an eye open -one buried in the pillow- and smiles so affectionately Dean thinks his heart might burst.
“Yes.” He presses a soft kiss to the exposed skin of Dean’s shoulder, and the slightly taller man sighs softly. “Care to go for a drive?”
“Good morning.”
“Yes.” Dean blurts, and Castiel snorts out a delighted, relieved laugh.
“I’ll always want you, Dean.”
“There’s nothing wrong with you, Dean.”
When Dean was seventeen he met a boy named Evan.
Once the goodies have been inhaled and gifts have been opened they migrate to the Dean cave to watch a movie. Upon entrance Dean is shocked to find a makeshift bed on the floor -a bed that Jack, Kaia and Claire immediately pile into with near identical giddy laughs. Dean claims one recliner and pulls Castiel down into his lap, wiggling them both until his chin can comfortably rest on Castiel’s shoulder.
