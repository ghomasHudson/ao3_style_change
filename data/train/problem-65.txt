"Mostly Classical and Romantic pieces, actually," Sherlock said, raising and lowering his shoulders.
John pursed his lips, causing a three small, vertical wrinkles to appear on his forehead.  "A message from your girlfriend, then?"
“It’s a letter from Mum,” James informed him with a wan smile, answering Sherlock's unasked question.  “But I know you both already know that.”  He reread a few sentences and grimaced again.  “She says she misses me and wants to know how I’m doing...but it’s clear she still hasn’t accepted either of you as my dads.”
"Yeah, but Xylazine slows the heart rate.  Switching to a different—and hopefully longer lasting— tranq is better than risking killing the patient with an overdose," John retorted in an undertone meant for Sherlock's ears only.
"Yeah," John replied easily.  Turning, he made his way to a metal utility sink mounted against the wall.  It had long, torque style-taps, designed to be operated without having to be grasped to turn them on.  John used the underside of his left forearm to turn the hot water on and proceeded to wash his hands with the customary thoroughness of any responsible individual involved in the medical profession.  "I dated a girl named Mary who was like that," John remarked as he interlaced his fingers and began scrubbing the valleys between them.  "Real religious household," John continued, turning his focus to his cuticles, oblivious to the way that Sherlock was watching him with fascination.  "She's a sweet girl—well, woman now—but it didn't work out.  Probably for the best, though, considering I'm a vet and a bronc rider and I've got my alma mater in cussin'."  Sherlock huffed in amusement at the rueful smile John sent him and the vet's grin widened in response.  John wiped his hands dry on a disposable towel then tucked them into the front pockets of his jeans, before turning to face Sherlock, his expression speculative.  "Speaking of swearing…how do you feel about cold water?"
Mr. Tregennis started and began to pat his daughter's back soothingly, splitting his focus between comforting his daughter and glaring at Sherlock.  Officer Gregory looked between Donovan, Sherlock and the Tregennises obviously wondering what course of action to pursue next.
Donovan tapped her pen against her desk, plainly lost in thought.  After a moment, she looked up and gave Sherlock a scrutinizing look.  "Speaking of getting caught...what about John Watson?"
"Not on my watch, he won't," John retorted, tossing extra bandages and iodine into the box before slamming it closed and jumping to his feet.  "Hold this, Billy," John ordered, shoving the toolbox into Sherlock's arms and grabbing the phone.  "Greg, are there any other vets out there?  Lily Hobbs, Steve Franklin or Ben Kyle?"
"I already know you were fired for public intoxication in the same barn that Joe Straker's corpse was found," Sherlock began bluntly, ignoring the way John bit back a wince.  He had no time for idle pleasantries.  Especially not when he was under a time constraint.  "I'm interested in why you suspect you were set up."
“Oi!  Budge up, you,” John mock-growled, shattering the silent tranquility of 221b with stomping feet as he came in from outside with the daily post.  The order was emphasized by John aiming a cheerful swat at the bottom of Sherlock’s feet with the cluster of envelopes he held in one hand.
"Um sure!"  Molly bit her lip and blushed, her cheeks turning a dark rose that almost matched her shirt.  "I'll um...just go help George and Owen unload.  Just...um...text me when you're done, okay?"
"Hmmmm...So...how does one do this again?" Sherlock asked, purposely keeping his voice different from its usual self-confident tones.  John enjoyed playing the protector—and keeping his vocal patterns hesitant was an easy way to foster that behavior.
The cowboy was tall, somewhere between six foot two and six foot three, with an extra three inches added by the heels of his boots.  And ripped, to use the vernacular term.  He was wearing black jeans and a mostly-unbuttoned black silk shirt in that emphasized both his golden tan, his extensive tattoos, and showed off his six-pack.  The man's boots were an unusual combination of crocodile leather and tiger-striped-patterned hide uppers.  His chaps repeated the tiger motif through a combination of black leather legs, brown fringe, and a tiger-stripe pattern on the belt.  Expertly smudged eyeliner, Giorgio Armani cologne, and a black Stetson banded with a string of claws completed the outfit.
"Go ahead, John.  You know how to splint a wrist just as well as I do.  That is, of course, if know how to handle a patient that isn't actively kicking or biting you?"  The last comment was said in a gently teasing tone.
"I know we had lunch silly!" Molly mock-scolded.  "But that's not the point!  Half the fun of exploring a rodeo is eating treats that would make you sick to your stomach if you ate them every day.  Come on.  Have some fun.  You can't be a real cowboy if your stomach can't handle fried corn on the cob or fried diamondback rattlesnake!"
The 'Memphis' was surprisingly good.  The banana was sweet and firm, not mushy, and the peanut butter and honey worked well with the cinnamon and cardamom flavors of the bread.  Sherlock took a second bite, and then a third, before forcing himself to set the sandwich aside in favor of his coffee.  It wouldn't do to eat too much, too quickly.  Digestion slowed him down and he wanted all of his mental capabilities at their peak.  He ignored the crisps.  Kettle-cooked crisps were too crunchy for his tastes, parsnips were revolting in any form and he despised truffle oil.
"Are you between deployments or reserve?" Sherlock asked, partially out of curiosity, partly to distract himself from the throbbing bursts of pain in his wrist caused by the vehicle's jostling over the bumpy pavement.
a cowboy manages to stay on one of my Kigers for the full eight seconds," Candii continued, her tone making it clear how rare an occurrence that was, "he's almost certainly guaranteed a score in the high eighties."
"Just that I ran a credit report on Doctor Watson," Donovan said, tapping the tip of a pen against a notepad.  "It turns out Doctor Watson has a
His stomach growled again, reminding him that the last thing he'd eaten had been a sickeningly-sweet, oversized sticky bun covered with a sticky white glaze. As much as he was loath to admit it, the demands of his transport for sustenance after his trip were overriding his normal reluctance to eat when on a case.
John frowned.  Sherlock found himself unreasonably entranced by the wrinkles that furrowed across John's forehead as the vet visibly parsed Sherlock's words.  "Wait…," John said slowly, clearly reviewing Sherlock’s statement and finding the wording odd.  "Were the horses were being abused by a human or were they abusing each other?"
Sherlock tightened his grip and began to thrust in earnest, his mind easily replacing the reality of his hand with John's instead.  His hips snapped up, his breath coming in harsh pants as he fucked his own fist.  The Moroccanoil was warm and slick, allowing him to thrust without worrying about damage.  Its woodsy scent filled the air, overlaying the scent of Sherlock's own arousal, feeding back into the fantasy.
"He got a good-sized splinter embedded in his right hind coronet.  It didn't get treated for a few days because the horse tried to kill everything in sight, so nobody knew, and then sepsis set in.  John was a bit worried that they might have to put the horse down, but between the antibiotics and the jockey's recipe, the Frisian pulled through.  I can email him and see if he can get the recipe for you?  If you're interested?"
"Him?" Sherlock asked, feigning confusion.  "But...isn't he the same guy who saved that barrel racer after her horse attacked her?  I read about it in the papers," Sherlock added hurriedly, seeing Alice's look of confusion.  "The papers were hailing him as some sort of hero."
Around them, couples were walking arm in arm, or chattering in groups.  Apparently the pending arrival of sunset was the cultural cue to go outside, which also explained why parking was so scarce, Sherlock decided.  Waiting until the evening to socialize echoed similar cultural practices in Spain and Italy.  It made sense.  In many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries, the soaring midday temperatures made being outside inadvisable since there was a risk of accidental heatstroke.  Texas, with its unrelenting heat and sun was absolutely murderous by comparison.  He'd have to be sure to purchase Mrs. Hudson a large box of her favorite soothers as a thank-you gift for the sun cream she'd forced him to pack.  If it weren't for her foresight, his naturally pale skin would have suffered second-degree burns by now—
Sherlock flicked an eyebrow.  Well, that was certainly interesting, especially considering the amount of debt that John was carrying.  "So why did you stop?" Sherlock asked aloud, being careful to keep his tone curious, rather than accusatory.  "I imagine that your deployments would have ensured that you remained physically fit and from our earlier conversations, I can't imagine you would have resented the necessary time spent on the road traveling to different events."
"Billy?  Are you feeling alright?  You've hardly touched your food," John's soft voice called Sherlock away from his mental wanderings and he blinked, his gaze refocusing on John's concerned face.
A long, jagged cut marred the stallion's left foreleg, narrowly missing the knee joint.  A bloody gash, approximately two centimeters wide crossed the horse's right flank, stretching from the point of its hip and down almost to the gaskin.  It was still bleeding, the rivulets of fresh blood making rust-red streaks down the animal's side.  Numerous small wounds, possibly caused by flying shards of wood based on the background damage to the stall also dotted the stallion's coat and legs.  A shallow scrape marred the animal's withers, and there was an enormous, broken swelling on the stallion's face that would leave a noticeable scar, even after it was stitched.
"A couple of different ways," John began, signaling to pass a car that was doing the speed limit and accelerating past it.  "Pro Rodeo and Professional Bull Rider events—as you can probably deduce—" John continued, placing a teasing bit of emphasis on the word "—from the names are predominantly about money; the prizes, the advertising, the entry fees, you name it.  The American Gay Rodeo Association is an organization made up by a bunch of different regional gay rodeo associations and their main focus is having fun and helping raise money for different charitable organizations."
And his normally carefully-calibrated thought process went hazy, overwhelmed by the pleasurable sensory input.
"Yep," John confirmed, hitting his turn signal so he could pass a sedan that was apparently driving too slow for his tastes.
"Muzzle so he can't bite if the sedatives wear off while we're transporting him, and a pair of standard hobbles so he can't run," John replied.
Sherlock demanded, arching his hips and making his erection bob.  He didn't care if he sounded like a bratty child.  At the moment, there was nothing he wanted more than to feel John's lips wrapped around his throbbing length.  He whined as John smoothed a palmful of warm lubricant over his erection, followed by the condom and the firm grip of John's left hand.
With a private sigh of relief, Sherlock let his gaze wander back over the fairgrounds.  Alice and Edith were still giggling quietly together—no doubt still discussing the vagaries of different sexual partners.  Sherlock spared a moment for a private sneer before turning his attention to the different herds of horses milling about in the paddocks around him.  Alice's assertions of stir-crazy horses aside, Edith's comments and his own observations made it clear (to him at least, even if not to anybody else) that the Triple C's horses were acting more skittish than usual.  None of the animals were taking advantage of the hay or water that Cole and Molly had placed in the pen earlier.  Instead, the entire herd was picking their way around the pen, heads up and ears pricked forward, nervously scanning for whatever threat they sensed.
“ALL RIGHT!!!  I JUST GOT THE SIGNAL THAT OUR ATHLETES ARE ALMOST READY!  FOR YOU RODEO VIRGINS, YER ABOUT TO WATCH TEN OF OUR FEARLESS ATHLETES JUMP FROM A HORSE RUNNING AT ROUGHLY THIRTY MILES PER HOUR TO TACKLE AND HOPEFULLY WRASSLE A RUNNING STEER THAT WEIGHS AN AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO THE GROUND WITH ALL FOUR FEET POINTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  THE BEST BULLDOGGERS CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS FEAT IN UNDER FOUR SECONDS!!!!!  SO NOW I WANT TO DRAW YER ATTENTION TO OUR LEADERBOARD.  FIRST UP, WE HAVE KESHAWN YARBROUGH, FROM KILLEEN TEXAS.  GOOD MAN, KESHAWN.  BIG MAN TOO, IN ALL THE WAYS THAT MATTER.”  The announcer paused a moment to let the cheers and catcalls die down.  “SIX FOOT THREE, TWO TWENTY, AND WAS BOTH A FOOTBALL PLAYER AND A WRESTLER IN COLLEGE.  I DON’T THINK THIS STEER’S GONNA STAND A CHANCE!”
"It's fine.  It's just the sedatives kicking in," John reassured him, watching the gelding's balance with a critical eye.  "Okay boys, he's going under.  Give him a little more slack," John ordered the cowboys that were still hanging onto the lassos.  "I'm gonna check him out, Greg.  Could you hold this, Billy?" John continued passing over the scotch hobble.  Without waiting for Sherlock's response, John picked up the red toolbox and slowly climbed over the stall gate, rather than opening it.
At the sound of his name, John’s head shot up, letting Sherlock see the mingled look of frustration, fear, apprehension, and gratitude on his face.
was that?" John demanded, wheeling around and raising his chin to glare up at Sherlock, his dark blue eyes visibly snapping with anger.
Periodically, John would pull back and swirl his tongue around the head of Sherlock’s cock like he was sucking on an ice lolly.  Every time he did, he made sure to catch Sherlock’s eyes before diving back in with gratifying eagerness, urging Sherlock to fuck his mouth.  The air in the cab filled with the musk of male arousal and sweat, adding to the already prevalent scents of leather, woodsmoke, sagebrush and sand.
the original target and Devil’s Blaze merely the murder implement?  Could Sterndale’s alleged misdiagnosis of rabies have been an attempt at covering up something suspicious?
Sherlock blinked in surprise; John's reaction was unexpected.  He turned to give the vet a puzzled look.  "Do you think so?"
"Me either.  Ergo, Sterndale is a liar," Sherlock concluded.  He got several more steps closer to the truck before he realized that John was no longer walking beside him.  Sherlock paused and looked over his shoulder.  "What's wrong?
"—but it's certainly a concern for individuals competing regionally or nationally," Sherlock concluded scathingly, before returning his attention to Brenda.  "Going from winning to losing over the last few years, shame at disappointing your late mother's memory, horse getting older, of course you resented her.  She—"
Sherlock snorted.  "Fanatics everywhere have proven throughout history that it's perfectly acceptable to sacrifice lives or morals for a so-called higher cause.  What's that saying by Charette, the famous Royalist general of La Vendée?  "Omelets are not made without breaking eggs"?  Kitty Riley is perfectly willing to slander individuals to further her cause.  There's a video clip on her website of John Watson performing an emergency euthanasia on horse that that was fatally gored by a bull at a rodeo several months ago."  Sherlock's lip curled at the memory as he shared the results of his research.  "She's an idiot.  The moron has the gall to claim that John Watson needlessly traumatized the animal by shooting it between the eyes, instead of giving it a peaceful end by lethal injection.  Never mind that the horse's intestines were hanging out, the animal was panicking and presenting a danger to the rodeo clowns and the bull rider, and that a gunshot was the fastest, most humane and responsible choice available.  Deliberately mixing yew clippings, alkaloid-heavy locoweeds, swainsonine-containing plants or opioids such as morphine into an animal's feed would be a fairly straightforward way of guaranteeing they'd have something worthy of putting on their website.  Since rodeo animals aren't routinely tested for drugs at small events, the chances of getting caught are virtually nil."
Sherlock reminded himself for what felt like the sextillionth time.  Somebody to be considered guilty until proven innocent.  "Doing what?  Are you competing?" Sherlock asked aloud, raising a single eyebrow.  The idea of watching John on the back of a bucking bronco had potential.  Perhaps he'd observe something significant.
Sherlock waited until John and Lestrade had left and checked to see if anybody else was watching him before pulling the supplies he'd filched from John's truck out of his boots and pockets.
John licked his lips again and grinned.  "Yeah.  They do keep the A/C pretty cranked.  It's one of the reason's it's so popular during the day.  Let me know if you get too cold, though; I've got a spare jacket in the truck you're more than welcome to borrow."
"Generally if they get replaced, it's because their animals ain't as good as somebody else's—there's big money to be made by breedin' high quality buckin' stock.  That's how I got in.  Because of negative publicity and the fanatics though, rodeo organizers are downright paranoid about allegations of animal abuse and will drop a contractor in a heartbeat because of it."
"Oh, yes, of course," Sherlock replied belatedly, tucking his phone away into his back pocket.  He turned around and made sure to brace his arms against the roof of the cab as he leaned forward.  The angle stretched his body out and incidentally gave Molly a good view of his lean frame, while the vee of his unbuttoned shirt collar accented the suprasternal notch at the base of his throat and offered Molly a glimpse of his pale chest.  Ducking his head, Sherlock blinked slowly as he gave Molly a slightly warmer version of his usual fake smile.  "My apologies, I lost track of the days this week, I've been so busy working with Devil's Blaze.  Yes, coffee.  Coffee is good."
Molly pursed her lips in thought, her expression unhappy.  "I've seen a lot of cowboys get trampled over the years," she said slowly.  "It...kind of goes with territory.  Accidents happen and sometimes people get hurt when an animal panics...but…"  She paused, obviously trying to decide how to phrase what she had seen.  "Have you ever seen a predator like a coyote that's been trampled by a horse?"
John was watching him with a furrowed brow, clearly listening.  At Sherlock's off-hand mention of hiring a taxi, John's expression changed.  "Wait, what?  Don't you have a vehicle?" John interrupted, his voice concerned.
"Wait…just…a…tic…" John scolded, slapping Sherlock's hands away and ignoring Sherlock's frustrated whimper when his offer of assistance was rejected.  John finished pulling his hands free of the cuffs and swiftly finished undoing the buttons down the front before tossing the garment over his shoulder with an absent-minded flick of his wrist. The fabric landed on the floor with a soft rustle, joining John's cowboy boots.  "Better?" John asked innocently, resting his hands on his flexed quads in a pose that accentuated the ridges of his abdominals and the muscle definition of his arms and shoulders.  At the hitch of Sherlock's breath, one of John's eyebrows rose up and innocent expression transformed into a confident smirk as he met Sherlock's hungry gaze.  "See anything you like?"
"I...don't know," Sherlock replied.  Victor certainly hadn't been, voicing numerous loud complaints about Sherlock's cold hands and feet, but the hopeful expression on John's face made it clear that he would be disappointed otherwise, perhaps even call an end to their evening.  Which could upset his evening agenda.  And—if he was being honest with himself—the prospect of a post-coital cuddle up to John was not unpleasant, so when John gave his hand another encouraging tug, Sherlock went willingly.  He draped himself across John's chest and entwined their legs, slotting one slim thigh between John's two muscular one and laying his head back down so that his right cheek was resting against John's sternum.  From this position, he could hear the steady thrum of John's heartbeat and the rush of air to and from his lungs.
He did owe her something nice after the incident with his first (and last) attempt at making homemade hide glue, after all.
John finished pulling on his gloves and reached out to take the steer’s nearest horn and hold it in place.  “There’s no pus either, and minimal tear-staining,” Jonn observed before the animal jerked its head free and bolted towards the opposite end of the pen.  “You said several of the animals look like this?”
Sherlock heaved a sigh even as he pulled out his mobile.  Doing things the 'legal' way was so dull and always took too long, he thought sullenly as he tapped out a message to Mycroft's pet hacker.  He loathed owing Jim favors, but the man was too valuable a resource to simply abandon, even if he seemed, as Mrs. Hudson would say, "shot in the head".
John cleared his throat, glancing sideways at Sherlock.  At Sherlock's nod of confirmation, John shrugged.  "Er, well, Billy took a tumble in one of the fairground cattle barns earlier.  He tried to catch himself with his hand, rather than taking the fall, and ended up hurting his wrist.  I'm not sure if it's broken or just sprained; it's definitely swollen.  Oh, he also hit his head."  John slid his gaze to Sherlock, obviously waiting to see if the other man would add anything else.  When Sherlock remained silent, John shrugged.  "That's…really about it," John told Mike.  "I checked Billy's pupils, and it didn't look like he gave himself a concussion, but you're the doctor, not me."  Standing up, John gave Sherlock a clap on the shoulder.  "And on that note, I'll get out of here so you can have some privacy.  I'll be in the waiting room when you're ready to go."
"I'll meet you at the gas station," Sherlock replied quickly.  John's suggested time would allow him to skip the chatter of the evening meal.  Better yet, it was late enough that his departure wouldn't raise any eyebrows.  He'd already noted that nobody cared if the ranch staff left the ranch for a bit, as long as the chores were done first.  The offsite location would give him a chance to meet with John away from prying eyes.  Assuming John hadn't already eaten, he could probably convince John to have dinner with him afterwards.  It he was successful in his manipulations, it could even lead to him having the opportunity to drug John and possibly hack his laptop, or at least scope out John's residence for future break-ins.
"What about?" Molly asked as she turned off the ignition to park the enormous diesel-powered lorry she'd been driving for the duration of their trip.  Her expression made it clear that she was humoring him.
John laughed and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's bare thigh.  "That's actually not necessary...I'm good."
Sherlock could easily imagine John’s excited expression as the gate was pulled open and the horse shot into the arena.  Barely four seconds later, the rider was sending up a plume of dirt as he thudded against the ground and rolled several times, narrowly missing the horse’s hooves as it came down.  A loud tone in the pitch of E flat, sounded, signaling time.
Brenda was biting her lip and twisting her hands together nervously as she stared at him, an almost imploring expression on her face.  Both the hand-twisting and lip-biting were signs of apprehension, possible attempts at obfuscation.  He'd seen the same behavior demonstrated countless times by idiots who'd hired him to correct an issue and then lied or excused the way their own actions had contributed to their horse's problem behavior.
Sherlock blinked rapidly, taking in the play of John’s shoulders before he abruptly dragged his mind back to John’s polite query. “No,” he admitted with a grimace, turning to join John in leaning against the fence rail. “I’ve interviewed at least six stable hands, and none of them can recall seeing anything strange the night Johann Straker was killed.” He shifted until his shoulder was just brushing against John’s. “And you?”
Sherlock blinked, feeling a sudden flood of heat suffuse his body and pool in his groin at the mental images invoked.  He'd speculated that he'd he'd tripped and stumbled into something like a drunken idiot...being slammed up against a brick wall and kissed within an inch of his life by John Watson had been far beyond the scope of his deductions.  It was immediately followed by a feeling of fury at his sotted idiot of a past self.  He'd been fantasizing about kissing John Watson for
Sherlock rolled his eyes as the announcer began informing the crowd that the bareback riding was about to start.
"You look upset.  Is something wrong?  Is one of the horses acting strange?" Molly asked gently.  She followed Sherlock's gaze to where Alice and Edith were standing together, laughing and presenting what would no doubt be considered a very fetching picture if the body language of some of the other cowboys was any indicator.  "Oh, I see," Molly said softly, biting her lip and looking away.  She reached up and tucked a flyaway strand of hair behind one ear.  "You know, she'd probably say yes if you asked her," Molly said with obviously forced nonchalance.
Sherlock clenched his jaw.  John's explanation for not taking basic safety precautions contained enough logical fallacies to pilot a coach-and-four through, but it was equally apparent that John wouldn't be budged from his opinion.  Worse, Sherlock recognized, was the awareness that any attempt on his part to keep pushing John to wear a helmet would be countermanded by John digging his heels in even further, either too stubborn, too proud or perhaps both to concede to Sherlock's superior intellect.  Better to wait and revisit the issue later.
"You can't live off of caffeine alone, you idiot," John mock-scolded, his cheerful tone making it clear that the dig was friendly, rather than mocking.  "Though God knows I've tried often enough over the years.  How does pizza sound?"
John's head swung from side to side in an aborted motion while his eyebrows moved up and down in annoyed confusion.  "Come again?"
John blinked, his expression shifting from 'charming' to 'professional' in response to her decidedly non-flirtatious manner.  He coughed, clearing his throat.  "Twenty…maybe thirty minutes?" He glanced down, double-checking his estimate against the military watch he was wearing on his left wrist.  "Captain Lestrade asked if I'd swing by and take a look at Scotty for him," he continued.  John tilted his head sidewise to indicate the stall's occupant.  "Greg said he was acting a bit spooky while patrolling the bull-riding crowd yesterday, which is unusual for a police horse."
"Doctor Watson?" Sherlock interrupted though he already knew the answer.  "Who is she?" The mis-genderization was deliberate, a subtle reference to female veterinarians designed to further integrate himself into Molly's favor.  "Is that Ms. Ross's regular vet?"
"Mmm...maybe four ideas," Sherlock revised, shifting to keep a better eye on the stallion.  "Ask your client if Colonel is fed by weight or not."
Mycroft's answering smile was thin.  "I don't believe in coincidences, dear brother.  The universe is rarely so lazy.  As Ian Fleming once observed 'any incident occurring three times in succession is likely the result of enemy action.'"  Mycroft handed Sherlock the final folder he'd been holding.  "A week ago, in a remarkably similar set of circumstances to those surrounding Johan Straker's death, a teenage girl competing in a barrel-riding event in Flagstaff, Arizona was hospitalized in critical condition after she was inexplicably attacked by her horse while grooming it in its stall.  The girl almost certainly would have been killed, had a nearby good Samaritan not been alerted by her screams and pulled her to safety.  The animal was euthanized, but routine tests for rabies were performed and revealed no evidence of infection...or evidence of abuse."
John blinked twice and coughed to clear his throat.  "No, I don't mind at all." John said, kicking his sandals off.  He set the chair down at the table before coming over to stand beside Sherlock.  "That looks great," John continued, relenting slightly.  "Errr...Is there anything I can do to help?"
Standing up abruptly, Sherlock stalked across the floor, avoiding the tripping hazards with unconscious ease as he came to a halt in front of the other man.  Leaning forward, Sherlock inhaled deeply to better analyze the scents clinging to Mycroft's suit, unashamedly ignoring the other man's affronted look at the invasion of his personal space.  Overpriced French food, the pipe tobacco-and-leather infused odor of the Diogenes Club and expensive perfume.  Drawing back, Sherlock closed his eyes to better flick through his mental database and deduce the reason for Mycroft's presence.  His lips curled in disgust as the solution realised itself.
"Watch your step," John said suddenly, reaching out and wrapping his hand around Sherlock's right bicep.  Sherlock blinked as John gently steered him around a pile of dog faeces that some irresponsible pet owner had left in the middle of the sidewalk.  "I'd hate for you to slip and hurt yourself again," John explained, licking his lips as he met Sherlock's puzzled expression.
He'd quizzed his fellow passengers during the drive over about the environment and clientele.  His early years of riding on Mycroft's coattails had taught him that bars and clubs were popular venues for doing under-the-table or off-the-books business.  The Antidiogenes Club in particular had probably heard more scandalous conversations, bent-over-the-table negotiations and cutthroat agreements in the last ninety-three years than the prime minister's cigar lounge at Chequers.  There was a chance that he might manage to overhear something useful.
"Joe Straker, Johan Straakr.  The name's slightly different, but it seems a bit too much of a coincidence to be random," Donovan commented, voicing Sherlock's personal thoughts aloud.  "Especially since Joe Straker's brother died in South Africa in 1986.  The difference in the name could be attributed to Americanization."  She shrugged in response to Sherlock's raised eyebrow.  "It's not uncommon; especially among immigrants seeking to assimilate rapidly."
"It doesn't look very secure," the landlady observed aloud, her voice muffled.  She eyed the cobbled-together system of wires and hooks skeptically.  "That hook up there looks like it's about to come out, and you'd better believe I'm adding this to your rent, young man!"
John looked up from the table top and gave Sherlock a rueful smile, leaving his leg where it was.  "Martina's one of my ex-girlfriends, but yeah.  Mostly it's tea and coffee.  My hours keep me on the road a lot, but this place makes a mean sandwich for the nights I don't feel like cooking."
"No.  I understand.  Thank you," Sherlock murmured, accepting the cold-pack and gingerly placing his injured wrist on top.  He shivered at the contrast.
"Perhaps," Sherlock answered vaguely instead, allowing no trace of his thoughts to appear on his face as he purposely bit his bottom lip in a way he knew was endearingly (and distractingly) attractive.  It also had the added benefit of making him look like one of the brainless trust-fund idiots he frequently saw at the tracks.  "How do you know John?  Did you meet him on the rodeo circuit?" Sherlock asked, making a quick assessment that Baz Moran was the type to gossip, especially if it could cast a rival in poor light.
Molly's choice of beverage is a nod to the lovely Galtori who made my day with an absolutely lovely message.  Thank you!
"I'm here as a favour to old friend," Sherlock explained.  'Friend' was an exaggeration, but the statement was still essentially true.  It was a better alternative than 'successfully manipulated by my conniving older brother on behalf of one of his clients' at least.  "I was asked to take a look at Candii Ross's crazy stallion and see if he could be retrained since two different vets couldn't find anything wrong with him," Sherlock continued easily.  "I was hoping maybe you could offer a bit of insight into him, since he was your patient first?"
Sherlock's grin was evidence enough.  "Yes," he answered, his eyebrows rising and falling with the word.  "Now if you don't mind showing yourself out, I do have other clients expected."
"We have three rooms free.  How many more patients do we have?"  The doctor leaned over to peer at the receptionist's clipboard.
," Edith gasped when the last horse was safely escorted out of the trailers and secured into the holding pen.  She winced and rotated her right shoulder where something had apparently gotten pulled.  "Did somebody put coffee in their feed buckets instead of grain this morning?  They're ornery as hell today!"
"Mornin' Billy!" John chirped, tipping his hat with the hand that wasn't holding an oversized, aluminum travel mug.  The words 'Veterinary medicine: where every day you're reminded that you like animals better than people' were emblazoned on the side, which was a sentiment Sherlock could fully agree with.
Sherlock sniffed.  The constant litany about procedure and regulations from the police was the eternal albatross to his ship.
John poked at his plate for a moment while studying Sherlock through his lashes.  "So...how were they?" John eventually asked, popping another forkful of pasta into his mouth.
"At first, no," Donovan admitted, "but I did by process of elimination.  It's a well known fact that Candii Ross doesn't part with money until she has to, but when she does, she doesn't cut corners.  If she's going to hire a fancy horse-whisperer to touch her babies, he or she'll be the best of the best.  I did a Google search for 'world famous horse trainers' and I pulled up a few names…Monty Roberts, Buck Brannaman, Jill Henselwood, Vittoria Panizzon's names all came up.  Yours did too, for speciality cases.  It took a bit of digging, but once I did, it make sense that Candii Ross'd hire the one horse trainer with a background in investigative work.  Especially considering your reputation."
“Billy Scott, Consulting Equine Expert, meet Dr. Jessie Depeau, experienced livestock vet-” John announced, looking away from the steer long enough to make the hurried introductions over one shoulder.
"I'm fine," Sherlock lied, concentrating on the warmth that John was radiating and stubbornly ignoring the cold pit of guilt that was metaphorically devouring his insides.  He shifted slightly so he could look over his shoulder at John's concerned expression.  "Besides, you can warm me up...right?" Sherlock asked, infusing his voice with seductive warmth.
"Come on.  Let's go.  You carry that," John ordered, indicating the black toolbox that Sherlock held on his lap as he unsnapped his own seatbelt.  "I'll grab the other two med kits from the back."
“Sherlock?” John asked, pausing in the threshold at the sight of the figure snarling at his laptop.  He'd spent the last forty-eight hours at the hospital, comforting a weeping Clare, and it didn't look like the dark-haired man had moved in the entire time John'd been gone.  He was still wearing his pajamas and the only evidence that the detective had eaten or drunk anything during that time were the half-filled cups of tea sitting on the coffee table beside him.  “What’re  you working on?  A new case?”
"Jesus, Billy," John swore, shaking his head in exasperation.  "If that's your only problem, I'm more than happy to help!"
Sherlock knew his expression was mulish, but he couldn't help it.  Kissing John resulted in an endorphin rush comparable to riding in cross-country steeplechase—with a fraction of the inherent danger.  The pointed look John sent him, however, made it clear that further kissing would have to wait.  Actually, with hindsight, it was probably a good thing he'd still been holding the violin and bow, Sherlock decided resentfully as he began loosening the bow's tension.  Shoving John against a wall, or reaching down and grabbing a double handful of John's arse and squeezing wasn't quite appropriate for his portrayal of a somewhat awkward, shy, gay and mostly virginal horse whisperer.
"Oh, um," Molly flushed and swallowed, licking her lips before tilting her chin up to meet Sherlock's impatient gaze.  "I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee," she said in a rush.
Molly shook her head.  "Not at first.  I just heard a horse screaming in the dark.  That's never a good sign, so I ran forward to see if somebody needed help."  She paused and licked her lips.  "It wasn't until I got to the stall that I realized it was Blaze.  He was covered with blood and lather, but when I tried to get close enough to see what was wrong, he tried to attack me."
John pursed his lips and gave Sherlock a considering look.  "You mentioned she was old, so presumably fragile.  I can see not trusting an instrument to a cargo hold, but why not bring her as a carry-on item?  Surely that would be safe enough?"
“So where are we going?” John repeated as Sherlock whipped them around a corner and skidded to a halt.
Sherlock pushed himself upright and shoved his hands into his pockets with a smile. "Very well.  Lead on.”
.  Sherlock cut the thought off abruptly.  Better to endure the cold than risk the potential distraction.  Not that it was working so far.  Sherlock found his eyes involuntarily drawn to the sway of John's hips as he followed John to the end of the queue in front cafe's counter.  Did the man know how to walk without swaggering?  With effort, Sherlock looked away and began surveying the cafe.
"Do you keep this door locked?" Sherlock asked, indicating the small stable door Mrs. Porter had just opened.
"Don't be an idiot, John," Sherlock snapped.  "Horses that have been weaned are lactose intolerant.  Feeding them products made with whey would only result in digestive problems."
Sherlock rolled his eyes in exasperation.  "Sterndale's a sexist idiot, in case you didn't already know, as well as being a homophobic bigot.  Before you ask me how I knew that, let me remind you that I read body language for a living.  The signs are unmistakable.  Sterndale's the type of moron who assumes that any soft-spoken man wearing purple or pink must be automatically gay—regardless of what the individual in question's sexual orientation might actually be—and treat them as social pariahs accordingly.  He's also the type to be automatically suspicious of male friendships.  I know this; I've dealt with his type before.  Since Sterndale's body language made it clear that he was not especially inclined to cooperate with you, and he certainly wasn't going to cooperate with me if he thought I was just a friend, rather than a legitimate equestrian expert, I thought it best to avoid wasting our drive.  Based on past experience, the easiest way to put Sterndale at ease so I could interview him effectively was to adopt a hyper-masculine persona for the duration of our interview."
"I do.  Very much," John said appreciatively.  "I'm just glad I had a chance to snag a shower at the clinic first—I got called out to deal with a minor emergency out by the fairgrounds," John explained in response to Sherlock's raised eyebrow.
"A humble one too!" John retorted sarcastically, the smile in his voice blunting the sting of his words.  Still grinning, John gave Sherlock a friendly nudge with his shoulder.
"It could be worse," John continued with a shrug as he shoved a toolbox to one side and began wrestling a large military rucksack free.  "The folks around here who actually work with horses and cattle know better and don't care what the internet loonies say about me."  John finished pulling the rucksack out and set down on the ground.  "Meanwhile," he added, clumsily changing the subject, "do you need anything else from inside the truck?  Sunblock?  Snacks?  Styling mousse?"
"Uh...right.  Okay.  Just...uh...make yourself at home," John ordered, indicating the red chair, his posture still oddly formal.  "I'm going to grab that shower," John continued, jerking his thumb in the direction of the flat's only other door.  "I'll...um...be back in a tick," he announced unnecessarily before ducking into the curtained-off corner.
"Just in passing," John replied with a quick shake of his head.  "Like I said before, a lot of the people working the rodeo circuit recognize each other."
At that, Candii Ross growled, her hands flexing and curling on the desk in front of her.  After a moment, she blew out an angry breath.  "I've been in business for over thirty years, Mr. Holmes," she began after a moment.  "I've had my share of ups and downs.  Droughts, fires, the occasional tornado...they all take a toll on my bottom line.  This is the first time, though, that I can recall havin' such a streak of bad luck in so short a time frame."
perfectly fine, John."  It wasn’t a lie.  While muscle cramps and headaches brought on by the shrill sounds of squealing horses and PA systems coming on line might be unpleasant, they were nothing he hadn’t dealt with by ignoring them before.
"John," Sherlock growled, just barely managing to stay in character in the face of the rising flood of testosterone, dopamine, and adrenaline.  "No pun intended, but would you quit dicking around?"
"Have you thought about coming out of retirement?"  Sherlock pressed, sensing he was treading over dangerous ground.
Lestrade shook his head.  "Not this crazy, but, well, he was acting up a bit while I was patrolling the bull rides—you remember, John?  His eyes were a bit pink too, if I recall."
"You could say that," Sherlock said faintly, staring with an appalled expression at the large jar John had removed from the fridge.  Was
"Billy Scott.  I'm Ms. Ross's new horse trainer," Sherlock lied, modulating his vocal timbre to sound slightly young and naive.  Smiling, he reached out to give Simpson's proffered hand a solid shake, his mind already noting the details.  The rodeo clown's palm and digits were heavily callused and the irregular shape of his grip indicated that at least three fingers had been previously broken.  The tips were heavily stained with nicotine, likely from heavy chewing tobacco use, given the colour of the man's teeth.
Sherlock harrumphed again, closing his eyes and resuming his thinking pose.  He heard John helping himself to Sherlock’s tea—courtesy of James—and then felt the sofa cushions shift slightly as John settled back to sort the mail he'd brought up.
Sherlock snapped, directing his ire to his elder brother's mental ghost.  Glaring, he refocused his attention on the tableau outside.
“OOOOOOHHH MAN!  THAT LOOKED PAINFUL!” the announcer exclaimed as the second downed rider stood up and stalked disgustedly towards his hat.  “I’M NOT THE TIMEKEEPER, BUT I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT TO BE ‘BOUT FIVE AND A HALF SECONDS.  RIGHT BEFORE THE SIX SECONDS NEEDED TO QUALIFY.  SHAME!  BUT THERE’S A REASON WHY GOOSE ‘EM HAS THE REPUTATION SHE DOES!  I TELL Y'ALL, THAT’S A GREAT BUCKIN’ HORSE AND A GREAT COWBOY, LET’S GIVE ‘EM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR HIS EFFORTS!  NEXT UP, CURRENTLY GETTING READY IN GATE NUMBER THREE, ALL THE WAY FROM SUNNY NEW MEXICO IS ANNNNIIIIE HARRISON!  THIS LUCKY LADY HAS DRAWN BRIAR-BRAY—SO NAMED FOR HIS TENDENCY TO DUMP RIDERS IN THE WORST PLACE POSSIBLE AND GLOAT ABOUT AFTERWARDS!  WATCH CLOSELY, RODEO FANS, YER IN FOR A REAL TREAT!”
From his current vantage point, Sherlock could see the clear imprint of hoof marks on the walls and door.  He could also see places where Blaze's mane, tail and coat had snagged on the damaged boards.  Streaks and speckles of dried blood were still visible on the walls and floor.  Moving slowly, he began to walk around the perimeter of the stall, reading the chronology of events.  He paused, catching sight of the tie ring where Blaze's lead rope would have been secured.  It was hanging loose, the screws almost ripped out of the wood.
"That's no problem.  I can make dinner," Sherlock offered, ignoring the odd, slightly puzzled look John gave him in response to his announcement.  "I'd rather spend time with you away from prying eyes that might be inclined to gossip about you spending the night in my cabin," Sherlock added, his voice rich with implication.
One man, hanging on to the rope tied to the steer’s horns, was jerked sideways, then went down as the steer butted him in the gut.  The crowd made a noise of dismay as the steer made to charge, but the man’s partner came to his rescue, grabbing the animal’s tail and twisting it.  Hard.  The steer took off, bawling, while the first man climbed slowly to his feet and staggered towards the exit. His partner made a frustrated gesture causing the ribbon in his hand to flutter in the slight breeze.
"I don't have a lot of practical experience," Sherlock began, purposely making his voice hesitant.  He punctuated the statement with a nervous lip-lick.
"People love to be 'right'.  It's simple human ego, John, and Doctor Sterndale's ego is bigger than most," Sherlock replied, privately pleased for the opportunity to explain to such an attentive audience.  "He likes correcting people.  Showing people up makes him feel powerful, or do you think that I don't really know the difference between different genuses in Bovini tribe?"
leaping to a lower branch.  He landed with a whoop and threw his arms up in a victory sign while the pickup riders worked in tandem to escort Speckled Band from the ring.
Watson.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a daughter to feed."  Sterndale jerked his chin towards the door, making it clear that the statement was an order, not a request.
"Just...well…" There was the sound of a cough as John cleared his throat.  "Sorry, it's a bit dusty in this barn.  Uh, yeah.  So I've got this client with a gelding that's suddenly started spooking and shying at everything.  I've already eliminated the obvious suspects, like vision problems, poor-fitting tack or poisonous plants in the pasture.  It's gotten so bad that the owner can't ride her horse anymore and she's worried she might have to put her gelding down for the safety of her husband's grandkids.  I know that you're working for Candii Ross, but I was wondering if you had any ideas?  Maybe give me some clue what I'm dealing with?"
with him?  It wasn't like him at all to focus on sexual desire when he was working.  Narrowing his eyes, Sherlock glanced at the barely-touched glass of honey liquor he'd ordered.  He hadn't consumed nearly enough alcohol for his mental state to be so compromised...Was it just him, or was John Watson truly that attractive?
"Fine," Sherlock grumbled, releasing John's neck reluctantly and sliding backwards off of John's lap, only to stagger as his legs refused to support his weight.
"Would you know her if you saw her again?" Donovan asked, glancing down at what she'd written and then looking up again to meet Brenda's eyes.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he read.  During their first face-to-face meeting, Candii Ross had emphasized the fact that she could command the prices she did for her horses because of their performance value.  A hard-to-ride animal promised a good show and was thus more valuable.  Apparently the same logic applied to bucking bulls.  According to the article, a multimillion dollar industry had sprung up around the Professional Bull Rider's Association's demand for aggressive, exciting animals that were worthy of being televised.  The average value of a PBR touring bull was over six figures.  More than a few of the animals Sterndale had raised and later sold to contractors had gone on to become ranked animals—the most sought-after, (and therefore most valuable) type of bucking bulls.  The article's author lamented the fact that at least two different ranked animals that Sterndale's had bred had ended up dying of heart attacks while fairly young, (ages six and eight, respectively), denying other breeders the opportunity to 'add the bloodlines of these magnificent champions to their own stock in hopes of breeding another outstanding symbol of true Western heritage...'  Disgusted with the hyperbole, Sherlock dropped magazine back onto the table and picked up another one at random.  Like the first two, it also contained an article featuring  Sterndale.
Quick as his movement was, it was not quick enough to escape Mrs. Hudson's eagle-eye stare.  "Sherlock," she asked, her tone dangerously soft as she suddenly recognized the scrap of fabric Sherlock had just deposited in the pot, "are those my good flannels?"  She took another step forward, suddenly realizing why the pot in question looked vaguely familiar.  It wasn't one she used often, cooking for one or two generally didn't require the use of a large stock pot, so it normally resided in the large cabinet above her refrigerator.  But sure enough, there was the hammered-out dent in the side, caused when she had to defend herself against the brutish son of one of Sherlock's former clients.  "Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson repeated, her tone one that would have made most grown adults cringe.  "I asked you a question."
"Dick," John huffed, giving Sherlock a mock glower.  "What I mean is, yeah, I know to ask the owner about sudden dietary changes—I did, in fact—but I never would have thought to look past that and finger a horse-loving grandkid sneaking 'his' new horsie treats as the culprit."
Out of habit, he reached over and picked up his mobile to check the time.  It felt oddly heavy in his hand and he had to blink several times to clear the sweat from his eyes before he could finally read the screen. When he did, one of his eyebrows rose in almost scientific interest.
"Holmes," Donovan hissed again, her lips thinning in response to Sherlock's deliberate provocation.  "This isn't helping—"
Sherlock wasn't sure what his face was doing in response to the sudden bombardment of mental imagery featuring John Watson dancing, but based on John's grin, it was almost certainly humorous.
By contrast, allowing a horse to run his or her nose into a hard object, such as a brush or elbow was an extremely effective, self-administered punishment that taught that biting was unacceptable.
A small herd of bay and buckskin mustangs was grazing in one pasture, their tails flicking idly at flies.  Sherlock could see two horses were on guard duty, their ears pricking at the noise of the approaching truck.  Further out, near one of the barns, a trio of yearlings was frisking about, racing each other along the white-painted fence, their tails and manes flying in the wind.  Sherlock smiled, in spite of himself, as he watched their antics.
Sherlock give him a quizzical look.  "Surely you know the importance of a horse's diet on their performance?  I can't imagine you being that stupid, a qualified veterinarian such as yourself?"
They settled into a companionable silence, the room continuing to empty slowly around them.  Sherlock casually flipped through pages as he read, occasionally stealing glances at John Watson from the corner of his eye.  Apparently Sally Donovan hadn't been exaggerating about the tension between the Watson siblings.  John, meanwhile, kept staring down at his phone like he was expecting it to either ring or explode.  Furrowed lines creased his forehead, making him appear far older than his twenty-nine years.
"Great," Molly replied, blinking as if she couldn't quite believe his acceptance was genuine.  "There's a lovely little place in town called 'Ground Zero' that serves the best cinnamon scones…"
John's head jerked back, his eyes blinking rapidly as he processed Sherlock's revelation.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow, watching the micro expressions flitting across John's expressive face with interest as John's anger and frustration began to give way to curiosity and skepticism.
"Good," John hummed, pressing a kiss to the skin between Sherlock's shoulder blades before falling silent.
He forestalled John's anticipated efforts to pay for the groceries by casually 'forgetting' that he needed to grab a lemon and asking John to fetch one while he held their place in line.  By the time John returned, Sherlock had already finished paying.  To pacify John's pride, he allowed John to purchase the fruit, though the pointed look that John sent him made it clear that John knew full well that he'd been sent on a Snark hunt.  John had also grabbed a slice of cinnamon swirl cheesecake and an apple tartlet for dessert of the more conventional kind.  Sherlock waited while John paid and within fifteen minutes, they were back at John's tiny apartment.
"Nonsense John," Sherlock scolded, deliberately turning to give John a sultry look over his shoulder.  He decided to include a bit of innuendo of his own.  "Bees don't prick...to prick implies to 'pierce slightly'.  I prefer the term 'impale'." Sherlock didn't miss the way that John's pupils dilated in response to his statement, or the disappointed sighs from the two women.
“Neither.  It was education.”  Sherlock frowned.  “Pass me the soy sauce, would you?  I can’t reach the bottle; my leg won’t stretch that far.”
Sherlock swore mentally as the tingling in his penis increased and his burgeoning erection began to strain uncomfortably against his fly.  He hurriedly crossed his legs.  With any luck, the dim lighting would disguise both the bulge in his jeans and his incriminating flush.  The cottony feeling in his mouth was making it difficult for him to respond so he took a quick sip of his beer to sooth his throat.  What was it about John that prompted thoughts of sex?  Sherlock shook his head, as if the quick, jerky motion would restart his mind.
Sherlock paused in his mental comparisons and pursed his lips.  That was a suspicion that hadn't even crossed his mind.  "Mmmm...perhaps," he said slowly, mentally chastising himself for overlooking the obvious.  "Is your client involved in rodeos at all?"
“You can pick locks?” John whispered disbelievingly, wary of being overheard as he watched Sherlock go to work.
"For fuck's sake!" Donovan swore as she flipped on her office light and caught sight of Sherlock.  "You again?" Donovan demanded, her normally faint Cockney accent significantly more prominent than usual.  "I thought we said ten! It's barely eight!"
"Not at all," Sherlock said, tucking the phone between his right ear and shoulder and shifting so he could keep a better eye on the stallion.  "I'm literally on the fence.  What can I do for you?" Sherlock asked, adding a hint of flirtation to his question.
"Racehorses and eventing, John," Sherlock snapped.  "I like to see you name all the tools and tack that an English rider uses without consulting a computer first."
The rodeo he’d attended with Candii Ross’s crew had contented itself with riders carrying flags galloping around the arena and a few patriotic songs for the opening ceremonies.  It was nothing compared to
“You’d be surprised,” Sterndale replied absently, reaching and gently taking a hold of the steer’s horn.  He used his other gloved hand to push the steer’s eyelid up and back...and then hissed something under his breath.”
"You're forgetting, I've worked with him too," John argued, apparently oblivious to Sherlock's thoughts.  "That stallion is a handful—don't downplay yourself."
"Well, you can't blame her or her husband for wanting the horses to be happy," John pointed out with a shrug.  "Or for wanting to save a bit of money.  Horses are herd animals...they need company.  Besides, sometimes a mare and a gelding can be turned out successfully."
"Still nope," John replied.  "You missed it again.  Hold on, I can get it, if you don't mind?" John offered, his voice going husky.
John grinned, slowly, the corners of his eyes crinkling up.  "Oh," he breathed, and there was no mistaking the implication in his voice, "I'm
"Whoa there!"  John said, stepping closer to steady Sherlock's lean frame.  His left hand moved back to brace Sherlock's other shoulder, in preparation for a collapse.  "Hang on a sec…"
"That's horrible," Molly exclaimed.  "Not that she didn't die, I mean," she stammered in response to Sherlock's raised eyebrow.  "I'm glad that she didn't die.  I meant that it's horrible she was attacked by her horse.  Did...did they figure out what caused it?"
"That is a highly simplified description, to be certain, but accurate enough," Sherlock began.  "Rodeo competitions are divided into two categories; timed events and rough stock events.  Bronco riding is considered a 'rough stock' event and is subdivided into two separate categories: saddleback and bareback riding. Unlike timed events, in which the riders compete against a clock and each other—barrel racing being a classic example—in rough stock events, both the rider and the animal are judged.  As you mentioned, the prize money is a significant motivator.  Since the action of the horse is almost as important as the skill of the rider, many rodeos allow a competitor to pay a substitution fee to select a different horse if they feel their assigned horse is too 'tame'.  There is enormous pressure on stock contractors to secure the most exciting animals possible and the contractors that consistently provide high-quality animals tend to become elite suppliers."
Closing his eyes, Sherlock exhaled and flexed his feet inside his new boots.  The boots were the one item that he hadn't had time to break in properly, beyond ensuring that they no longer looked, or smelt, brand-new from a box.
"Becoming an elite contractor is difficult," Sherlock continued, warming up to his topic.  "There is a rigorous application process and vetting period.  The small number of available slots are highly sought after, since contract turnover is fairly rare.  Generally it occurs for one of two reasons.  The first is because another supplier has better animals—which, incidentally, is how Candii Ross earned her slot.  Her horses have an established reputation for stamina, enthusiastic bucking action and earning high scores independent of the cowboy.  Devil's Blaze is the current 'unrideable' frontliner of the Triple C., but his brother, Blazing Feet, is also highly ranked.  Their sire, Great Balls of Fire, was similarly notorious."
"I'll say," John breathed.  He stepped forward, licking his lips, and leaned in, his intent to kiss clear.
Doctor Früh watched Donovan walk away with a bemused expression.  "She seems like a very busy woman.  She must take her investigations very seriously."
"Sorry," Mike apologized.  He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and used it to blot his forehead.  "Just a tickle in my throat."  Tucking the handkerchief away, Mike turned and looked over his shoulder at John and then back at Sherlock, visibly taking in their respective stances and accompanying body language.  "Are you competing today, John?" Mike asked abruptly.
John grimaced and shook his head.  "Not as such.  I did call Doctor Früh's clinic to see how Scotty was doing, but everything was pretty vague.  Doctor Früh said they haven't definitively ruled anything out yet, but she'd try and remember to give me a call if something changed."
Donovan nodded slowly, making a note on her pad.  "Thank you, Mr. Tregennis.  I'll take that under advisement."  Donovan paused to take a sip of her coffee.  "Are you doing all right so far, Brenda.  Do you need to stop for a drink or anything?"
"Thank you," Sherlock replied, copying John's courtious tip of his Stetson and following him outside.
He could see riders beginning to tack up the horses with the assistance of staff, while videographers loomed over them like so many vultures with their cameras.  Rodeo clowns—identifiable by their choice of shorts over jeans—were beginning to cluster around the gates, and pairs of pickup men were beginning to trot their own mounts around the periphery of the arena.  As they passed by, Sherlock made note of the body language.  The horses were alert, but not frightened.  If anything, they looked—the sensation of his phone vibrating in his  pocket derailed his train of thought.  He pulled it out to see a text from John.
Shifting again, Sherlock slowly began to undo John’s belt buckle and zip, only to be halted by a sun-browned hand covering his own.
"A buffalo?"  Sherlock allowed his lip to curl with skepticism.  "I could see hunting a bear," Sherlock said, tilting his head to indicate the black pelt stretched across one wall.  "I could also see hunting a wild boar," he continued, tilting chin to indicate another head, "but aren't buffalo rather slow moving and stupid, compared to, oh...say, a mountain lion?"
Not bothering to even attempt to hide his smirk, John scooted higher up on the bed and slung one of his legs over Sherlock's thighs, pinning Sherlock's hips down with his own and bringing his denim-clad arse in easy reach of Sherlock's hands.
"So…" John began, pulling Sherlock out of his silent contemplation.  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel as he drove, a little nervous tic that Sherlock found absurdly captivating.  "I...really didn't get a chance to ask you at the fairgrounds the other day...you're working with Devil's Blaze...I...think you mentioned something about being a speciality horse trainer therapist type?"
Molly sniffed.  "It's 'y'all' not 'you all' and Joe didn't have friends.  Honestly, he didn't seem to care about us one way or another.  The only thing he seemed to care about was training horses, having lots of sex and bull rides."
When the team roping started, Sherlock took advantage of the crowd’s distraction to make an opportunistic trip to the loo.  After he’d settled back in his seat, he pulled his phone out again.  Team Roping held little interest to him, but it would give him an excuse to continue texting John.
"I asked if wanted to pick a night when I get back, or if there was a day you knew would work," John repeated patiently.
Sherlock shook his head once to realign his focus and nodded.  "Yes.  Do you want to play to a hundred points, or a hundred and twenty-five?" Sherlock asked as he circled the table, calculating his initial shot.
John licked his bottom lip.  "When you say she's worth a lot...how much are we talking?  A couple million?  Are you secretly rich or something?  Do the two of you spend time schmoozing with the billionaires?"
"Oh," Sherlock mumbled, feeling oddly embarrassed by his apparent cultural ignorance.  He blinked several times as he processed the information.  "I didn't know that."
Sherlock grimaced.  If nothing else, a phone call to the police detective in charge of the investigation would be helpful for eliminating possible suspects.  Picking up his phone, Sherlock fired off a quick text to Anthea asking her to email him the detective's contact information and copies of whatever investigative reports Detective Donovan had written.  It would be faster than finding it himself.
"That's an imprecise term, John," Sherlock complained.  "I'm hardly whispering to the horses; I'm using my extensive experience in equine psychology and body language to teach or retrain them...though sometimes that involves teaching the human as well."
John used his left hand to move up and down on Sherlock's shaft, establishing a steady, toe-curling rhythm.  His right hand reached between Sherlock's spread thighs to cup the heavy weight of Sherlock's testicles in his warm palm.  He alternated between petting the sparse hair with the calloused pad of his thumb, rolling them between his fingers and tugging on them gently, making Sherlock writhe in pleasure.  It was wonderful, all slickness and tongue, the scorching warmth of John's mouth, the pull of John's lips and the feeling of John's soft palate pressing against the head of his cock.
"A new one," Mycroft replied immediately.  "It's not a client we'd normally take, but Lady Frantz was, as you have inferred…insistent.  It's an American breeder.  A woman by the name of Candii Ross—"
A few moments later, his phone chimed with a return image of the rich, Art Deco interior of the P.G.C. Hajenius.  Sherlock glared, feeling a surge of envy that his brother was enjoying the culture and beauty of Amsterdam, while Sherlock was exiled to Texas.  P.G.C. Hajenius was arguably one of the best tobacconists in the world.  The shop contained a variety of pipes, several hundred different brands of tobacco and a fascinating museum of snuff boxes and other tobacco-related paraphernalia.  He'd long been interested in visiting, but had yet to find the time.  It galled him that Mycroft was almost certainly savoring the rich tastes of Honduran, Nicaraguan and Cuban tobacco while Sherlock was making do with the somewhat stale Marlboros he could purchase in local petrol stations.
It was a piece of thread, snagged on a rough splinter of wood, and so fine that he almost missed it, despite deliberately looking for it.  Gripping the end of the torch in his teeth, Sherlock snapped a quick photograph of the thread in situ, before reaching into his pockets for a pair of gloves, a pair of tweezers and a sterile collection tube.  Holding his breath to avoid disturbing the filament, Sherlock carefully worked it free from the rough grip of the wood and transferred it to the tube for safety.  He capped the tube and used a marker to write down the relevant details before tucking it and his tools back inside his jacket.  There was no guarantee that what he had found was relevant, but a great deal of his success came from recognizing the subtle details that others overlooked and assembling them into a cohesive whole.
"When I looked in the direction the wind was blowing from, I saw a group of rodeo clowns talking with some reporters.  One of them was wearing a green cowboy hat."
Sherlock nodded and complied, forcing himself to concentrate on the motion and not on how John's very, very beguiling pelvis looked.
"And you're still talking," John retorted.  He let go of Sherlock's right nipple long enough to briefly wet his fingers before returning them to begin a slow roll against the nub of skin.  Extending just the tip of his tongue, John began to lap at Sherlock's left nipple, alternating light, flicking taps with slow, broader strokes and gentle circles.  Pulling back, John admired the reddened bud before bending his head and gusting warm breath across it while the man pinned beneath him bucked and swore.
Sherlock yelped as his right boot abruptly skidded forward, overbalancing him.  His arms flailed desperately, but gravity and the lack of friction took precedent, sending his body into a turn.  His other leg folded at the sudden change of direction and Sherlock slammed into the floor into contorted fall, the movement too sudden and too awkward to let him tuck his chin against his chest or his arm against his body.  His mobile went flying and landed somewhere with an ominous crunch.  Worse still were the flashes of pain that erupted as both his arm and skull slammed into the pavement.
Sherlock chuckled.  "Yes, well, Mum—my mother hates cats," he replied, feeling oddly charmed by the tidbit about John's childhood.  "She couldn't stand to have them around."  An understatement.  His mother had thrown a hysterical fit when she'd seen the kitten that six-year-old Sherlock had smuggled home from a neighboring farm and hidden inside his bedroom closet.  She'd had ordered it to be taken away, despite Sherlock's tears and protests, and he'd never seen it again.
"Because, when I was a child, one of the family's grooms was bitten by a false widow," Sherlock explained with forced patience.  "The groom ended up developing necrotising fasciitis at the wound site and had to have part of his leg amputated.  And if that wasn't revolting enough, are you aware of some of the arachnid mating practices?  Cannibalism, broken-off pedipalps, gelatinous spermatophore…" Sherlock shuddered again.
Sherlock could feel his cheeks heating, both at the leer on John’s face and the memories invoked.  They hadn’t done anything past mutual manual stimulation and reciprocal fellatio, but John was right.  Vertical differences were irrelevant when large-enough horizontal surfaces were employed.  Such as the way John had spread out a quilt across the floor so he could lay prone as he fellated Sherlock while simultaneously offering up an equally lucious view of his own bare bum…Sherlock fumbled with John’s chaps, hastily draping them over his lap as his amygdala began to war with the afternoon’s hasty decision regarding celibacy.
"This way," Lestrade told him, leading him through the warren of hallways with the ease of long experience.  The brisk pace didn't bother the captain, Sherlock noted, the other man's breathing remained even, despite climbing multiple flights of stairs.  Still walking quickly, Lestrade rounded a final corner and leaned against the open doorway of a miniscule office.  "Wait a sec."  Lestrade held up a hand, catching sight of the slim black woman sitting behind the desk.  She was busily writing notes on a yellow legal pad, her brow set in a furrow of concentration as she nodded in response to whatever the voice on the other end of the line was saying.  "She's on the phone," Lestrade said unnecessarily.
After a moment, Donovan gave Sherlock a pointed look and jerked her chin.  "Right.  We may be on amicable terms now, but you're still in my chair, Holmes.  Move," she ordered.
"Oh my god…just look at you," John whispered, his tone unmistakably reverent.  He reached out and slowly smoothed his left hand over Sherlock's belly, his fingertips skimming lightly over the delineations of Sherlock's abdominal muscles.  "You are so goddamn gorgeous…You're a fucking work of art…like one of those Greek statues we studied in school…all perfect alabaster skin and godlike proportions."  John swallowed hard and leaned forward to claim Sherlock's lips in an unmistakably filthy kiss.  "The things I'm gonna do to you, you gorgeous man," John whispered as he shifted to kneel in the footwell and reached for Sherlock’s fly. "Just you
Sherlock's lip curled in contempt.  Clearly he wasn't likely to get much more useful testimony from Brenda.
"For future reference," Donovan added, her voice rife with warning, "if I catch you trying to hack my machine again, I'll arrest you for trespassing, and maybe attempted B and E."
"Already?  That makes no sense.  It's barely been ten minutes!  The detomidine alone should have kept him sedated for at least forty-five minutes," Sherlock argued, using the chemical name for Dormosedan, rather than the American brand name.
Sherlock inwardly seethed as John continued to haul him down the hallway.  He knew the limits of his transport better than John and the fact that they were sexually involved did
"Oh shut up," Sherlock snapped, turning his focus from Brenda to the hapless police officer.  "If you were even moderately capable of performing a thorough investigation, you wouldn't be—"
"Blaze!  What's gotten into you?!"  Quickly, she crossed to a nearby pole and toggled the switches that would illuminate the area better, distantly grateful that there were no other horses housed in immediate area to become frightened by the stallion's screams of rage.
“Sherlock…” the blond asked, lowering the dumpling he’d just picked up back to his plate, “did you just pick up your chopsticks with your toes?”
" Sherlock's sarcastic emphasis on the word was deliberate, "me to take this case?  Surely there are so-called 'horse whisperers' in the United States that have a microm of intelligence to handle a traumatized animal?"
"Maybe, but like I said; you're clever," John said with an encouraging smile and wink as he licked his thumb clean again.  "If there is, then I'm sure you'll figure it out, and I'm here and willing to help."
“Do you want me to fetch you a pair of socks?” John asked, interrupting Sherlock’s private ruminations.  "Or rather, would you wear them if I brought them to you?"
"I do," Sherlock replied, still staring at the mound of grease and salt in front of him with something akin to private horror.  He'd thought the fried offerings at the rodeos had been ludicrous, but this...
The fifth bulldogger’s horse was so excited it broke through the barrier before the steer had even been released.  The rider had to turn his sharply to get it to return to the starting box.  Ironically, the horse was then slow to start when the steer’s pen opened.  The bulldogger’s ending time put him in the bottom place.
"Intelligent choice," Sherlock commented.  "Many horse owners make do with temporary quarantine pens.  Few bother to consider adding shelters."
"You are going to give your dentist an early retirement at this rate," John pointed out with a chuckle as he led Sherlock past several parked emergency vehicles and a row of portable toilets, the sickly-sweet chemical miasma of artificial piña colada rapidly giving way to the mingling odours of grease, manure, dust, hot metal and fuel exhaust.  "Not to mention the way you'll be bouncing off the walls later if you eat that much sugar," John continued, chucking shoulders with Sherlock.
"Fine," Donovan sighed in apparent resignation.  She quickly gathered up the items she'd brought with her before striding out the door, Sherlock close on her heels.
Absently Sherlock reached up to scratch at the stubble shadowing his jawline.  It itched, but it was a necessary part of his disguise.  His cheekbones were too recognizable without it.  His feet hurt and all he really wanted to do was take a hot shower and wash the reek of traveling and sweat from his skin.  The honest smell of horses and manure was infinitely preferable to the stench of sweaty humans crammed together in too-small of a space for hours on end.
"That's because you clearly veer to quantity over quality in your coffee choices," Sherlock replied with a derisive sniff, taking a sip of his own, perfectly brewed cup of Yorkshire Gold loose-leaf tea.  Finding his favorite tea in what Mycroft had referred to as "the utter void of civilisation," had been an unexpected boon in his coffee date with Molly Hooper.
"No, I really am!" John protested indignantly.  "San Francisco was where I managed to ride Noble Bachelor for a score of 89 points and took home the championship buckle.  Though if that's the way you want to be, I certainly wouldn't object to going for a ride with you later, if you know what I mean," John continued with a leer and a waggle of his eyebrows as he reached over to grab Sherlock's left hand with his right.
"Rude.  You could have just asked," Donovan pointed out, folding her arms and giving Sherlock a sardonic look.
"Naw," Simpson replied, punctuating his remark with another stream of tobacco juice.  "Not unless you place the bet yourself.  And only if you get caught.  Helping a friend out though...well, one good turn deserves another."
"He gets fed a ration of hay grass and a handful of whole oats daily.  When we're training for competition, he gets some alfalfa and sweet feed mixed in with his usual ration."
"Then in that case, how is riding bulls any more dangerous?" Sherlock demanded, trying—and failing—not to imagine what could have happened if John
Sherlock thought as a piece came to mind.  With a hesitant smile that was only partially feigned, Sherlock began to play Sarasate's arrangement of Chopin's
“Git,” John laughed. He looked down at Sherlock, a fond expression on his face. “Do you like Mexican?”
Sherlock shifted, bringing his leg into firmer contact with John's.  "You grew up poor, I take it?"  Immediately Sherlock wanted to bite his tongue at the insensitive remark; positive that John would take offense and leave.  Instead John surprised him by moving even closer.
"Not a bad job mansplaining," Donovan acknowledged with a sniff, picking up her half-drunk coffee and taking a large slug, grimacing at the apparent heat.  "You missed something though.  Two somethings, actually," she added, once she had finished swallowing.
"No," Sherlock huffed, purposely omitting a good portion of his youth and the odious social functions and lessons he was forced to endure.  "Why would I?"
"Virginity is an abstract concept, John," Sherlock scolded, but there wasn’t any real heat in it.  He was too blissful to care.  "It's an outmoded idea commonly peddled heavily by various conservative religions and political groups alike in an attempt to shame individuals—particularly women—in an effort to deter them from engaging in premarital intercourse.  Furthermore, one can not simply 'lose' one's virginity the way one would 'lose' a set of keys or a pint of blood or a wallet or a mobile phone.  It is something that the inexperienced individual in question has hopefully chosen to engage in with at least a microm of forethought for pregnancy prevention or the risks of disease transmission."
Sherlock's lips twisted in bemusement as he reached down to rub the collie's ears.  Her tail began to thump against the ground in a gesture of apparent forgiveness.  The impact sent little puffs of dried grass and dust into the air to join the remains of Sherlock's tobacco smoke.  With a sigh, Sherlock straightened back up and picked up his oversized mug to take a long sip of his tea.  His nose wrinkled in distaste.  Lipton had nothing on either Twinings or PG Tips, but with enough sugar and milk, it could at least pass as as a quasi-acceptable source of caffeine for a man desperate for a cuppa.  Taking another sip, Sherlock let his mind drift back over the additional details about John Watson he'd gleaned from Molly Hooper during their coffee date several hours earlier.
"That you're a bit of a dick," the detective replied bluntly, "but that you get results that nobody else can.  You're also professionally ethical…it doesn't matter who's hired you, or how much they're paying.  If you find evidence of wrongdoing, you report it, damn the torpedoes and let the chips fall where they may."
Mrs. Porter shook her head.  "Not during the day.  I like being able to get into it easily for my tools and tack."
"Woah, easy there now," John chided gently, his hands catching Sherlock's to offer support.  He stood, which allowed Sherlock to lean against John's strong chest in a show of weakness that was only partially feigned.  "I've got you," John continued soothingly as he backed them up slowly through the curtain surrounding his bed.  He gave a gentle push and Sherlock fell backwards, landing on the substandard mattress.  "Just to make absolutely certain that we're on the same page, is this still fine?"
"Yes, Dad," the girl said quietly.  Though her tone was compliant, Sherlock didn't miss the annoyed glare she aimed at her father's back as she pulled open a drawer full of takeaway menus.
having his hair played with, or even touched without warning.  His scalp was extremely sensitive; it was borderline painful.  He'd encountered multiple idiots over the years who operated under the mistaken impression that curly hair was meant to be pulled—that hair-pulling was somehow fun, or funny, or sexy—regardless of the preferences of the owner.
"Too dangerous?" Sherlock repeated with a skeptical snort.  "John, you habitually drive in excess of the posted speed limit, work in a medical field that requires you to treat patients who out-mass you by a significant amount, who are also fully capable of shattering your skull or a limb with a single blow from their hooves.  You ride out-of-control horses for entertainment and are voluntarily dating me.  And, if that wasn't enough danger to sate your adrenaline addiction, you willingly enlisted with an employer who no-doubt deployed you to locations where you could easily have gotten shot at in addition to being attacked by an angry hippopotamus—"
Wrinkling his nose in annoyance, Sherlock flipped through to the necropsy report.  It didn't reveal anything new.  The clinic that had performed it had plainly been focusing on obvious issues that could cause a horse to spontaneously attack—abuse, infectious diseases, cerebral lesions, brain tumors, obvious poisons and drugs.  All tests had come back negative, the same way they had for Devil's Blaze.  There were traces of extremely mild smoke inhalation and irritated lung and nasal tissues, but once again, something that hardly unusual for an animal kept in a barn or periodically exposed to secondhand smoke during competitions.  The only observation of interest was the same one he'd noted previously: that the dead horse's remaining sclera was incredibly inflamed, with no obvious cause.
if you were enjoying yourself.  The fact that you were plastered at the time means you couldn't consent.  That's just wrong, Billy.  Completely and utterly wrong!"
“Just a real string of bad luck hitting the Hardwicke clan.  Watson’s father died and Ed had a stroke, or something.  Ed’s daughter, Katie, died a few years later.  Some sort of cancer, I think.  The medical bills bankrupted the family and the homestead got foreclosed.  Kinda breaks my heart, to be honest,” Arthur supplied.  “That property had been in the family for generations.  By now, developers have probably turned it into suburbs and strip malls.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, suppressing the automatic suggestion that John get it printed on a tee-shirt.  He wasn't willing to run the risk of antagonizing his ride to the point of finding himself abandoned in a car park.  It was still some distance back to Candii Ross's ranch and cab fare, assuming he could even find one, would be outrageous.  "I have it on good authority from quite a few of Ms. Ross's staff that prior to Straker's death, Devil's Blaze was relatively gentle for a stallion.  He certainly didn't have a history of being dangerously aggressive.  Even Molly Hooper commented on how much of a 'love' Devil's Blaze was."
Sherlock pursed his lips.  An apparent sore point.  He'd have to try a different tactic.  One appealing to her particular interests, perhaps?  He flipped through several pages, looking for the most-read sections.  "Why pathology specifically?" Sherlock finally asked, tapping his finger against a section detailing how to perform a decapitation for a field necropsy.  "Why not just become a vet?  Won't pathology involve additional years of schooling?"  A stupid question.  The answer so obvious that Sherlock felt like he was stooping to
"Are you offering to help me?" Sherlock asked, ducking his chin and raising an eyebrow in silent challenge.  At the same time, he deliberately bent his knees and canted his pelvis forward so he was closer to John's height.
Sherlock drummed his fingers on one leg in thought.  He’d been so focused on the main rodeo performances that he’d neglected to consider the prize money involved in the slack.  It was less common for saddle bronc and bull riders to participate in the slack—generally the slack was reserved for the more repetitive rodeo events: roping, steer wrestling and barrel racing—which brought his mind around to Brenda Tregennis.  She was a barrel racer and her horse attacked her.  Were there others?  With the slack being less popular, it was probable that the audience was smaller and that it was less likely to be televised or reported on.  Edith Baxter and Alice Turner were both barrel racers, Sherlock recalled belatedly.  Perhaps he should try approaching them for any gossip.
The wind had picked up during his drive north, Sherlock noted as he drove through the east entrance, observing the way a slightly faded vinyl banner proudly advertising a bi-weekly farmers' market rippled and popped on its ropes.  Following the instructions of his mobile, he turned the corner.
"What breed?" Sherlock asked, stepping forward at Molly's invitation and blowing air gently towards the horse's nostrils to give the animal his scent.  Turning his head, Sherlock studied the horse's conformation and size.  "Missouri Foxtrotter?
John blinked twice in apparent surprise.  "I feel just fine about prostate stimulation, but why do you—"
"Thank you, Officer Gregory," Donovan replied graciously.  "Brenda, do any of the individuals in the other images look familiar?"
Back at his cabin, Sherlock took a hasty—but through—shower to sluice away the sweat and stink of a hard day's work, before slapping on two fresh patches.  As he toweled his hair dry, Sherlock tried to decide how he wanted the evening to play out.  He hadn’t missed the lines of fatigue in John’s shoulders, nor the faint bags under his eyes.  A sensible person would have rescheduled, but John had made the forty-five-minute trip anyway.  Ergo, John had missed him.  Sherlock pursed his lips in thought.  John’s visible exhaustion meant that he would likely be receptive to the idea of a quiet evening in...which would allow him to get the information he needed to conclusively prove either John’s guilt or innocence.
There were people dressed in sensible chambray, plaid, and denim milling around to be sure, but they were outnumbered almost two to one by the number of individuals wearing false eyelashes, sequins, feathers, lamé fabric and enough rhinestones to supply the Moulin Rouge for a year.  He spotted multiple hats that would fit in just fine at the Royal Ascot, several bearded men wearing an assortment of lacy and/or slinky dresses reminiscent of his clubbing days, and enough pride, pansexual, transgender and genderfluid flags, stickers and patches to make any moderately-educated person visualize the shattered Bifröst of Norse mythology.  Sherlock struggled to hide a wince at the crackly notes of ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' which were blaring from an overhead speaker in a pavilion to his left.  It was apparently some sort of dance party if the gyrations of several ten-gallon-hat wearing, speedo-clad revelers, and their feather-boas were any indicator.  The wince became a grimace, however, as he caught sight of a trio of glittery, flamboyant pseudo-cowboys standing in line.  All three men were wearing matching, hot-pink, sequin-covered chaps and jackets, but the choice of pants was apparently optional because when one of the men shifted slightly Sherlock learned that yes, it was possible to view a full moon at high noon…
"I don't know," Sherlock said absently, watching John's retreating form with something close to awe.  The vet's stride was fluid, despite his short legs, and Sherlock could see the muscles in his arse and legs flexing as he ran.  "I think it was something about a steer fight?"
Oh.  Now that could be problematic.  Sherlock suppressed a reflexive grimace, wishing he'd somehow managed to secure the false license he'd wanted.  Sadly, even Mycroft's powers had limitations.  Following the officer's instructions, Sherlock reached into his back pocket and pulled his wallet free.  Still moving slowly, he opened the leather billfold and handed the plastic card over.  As he did so, the other man came close enough for Sherlock to see the rank pins he wore on his collar, as well as read the letters inscribed on the silver nametag the man wore clipped above the left front pocket of his uniform shirt.
One of the machines started beeping, drowning out what John was saying.  With a hiss of irritation, Sherlock dashed over to hit the button that would silence the alarm.
"Yes."  Sherlock bit his lower lip, trying to think of something else to say.  John's closed-off expression didn't bode well for his seduction campaign.  "It's beautiful," he tried.  "You've kept it very well.  Not surprising, since you obviously treasure it."
"Right...um...okay...so I'll meet you at a table under the center pavilion in twenty minutes or so?" Molly asked after studying the length of the line again, apparently oblivious to Sherlock's train of thought.
"Oh, um...he's a police officer that often does mounted security at the fairgrounds.  He's nice, with kids especially.  They love it when he lets them pet his horse—"
Sherlock shook his head.  "No.  Having reviewed what little information I currently have, I'm more inclined to suspect sabotage myself, especially since the on-call vet, Willem D. Shire was suspiciously absent from his post.  His car was later found submerged in the Durban Bay, but his body was never found.  Melba Toastya's death left the metaphorical and literal field wide open for the second favorite, Desborough, to run virtually uncontested.  Desborough won, earning a sizeable purse for his owners."
Sherlock grimaced.  The sun was already blisteringly hot, despite the early hour.  He could feel prickles of sweat already dampening the armpits of his shirt.  A fat horsefly began buzzing around his face, no doubt seeking an easy meal.  Why certain, biting insects seemed to prefer his blood-type, Sherlock had no idea, but it didn't make it any less annoying.  Or painful.  With a blinding fast movement, Sherlock flicked his right hand through the air, smacking the insect in mid-flight, stunning it and causing it to fall to the ground where he casually crushed it with the toe of his boot.
"Fine."  Sherlock watched Molly scurry off before facing forward and letting his smile fall away.  He knew, (intellectually at least), that feigning interest in somebody for an ulterior motive was socially considered a Bit Not Good, but guilt wasn't an emotion he felt particularly inclined to waste time feeling if he could avoid it.  The Work demanded absolute devotion and if some infatuated person's feelings got hurt in his pursuit of the truth, well, it wouldn't be the first time.
"—I would ask you not to," Donovan continued smoothly, "while this investigation is ongoing.  It could be evidence."
"Hay is for horses, John, not for people," Sherlock quipped, ignoring the annoyed look John gave him.  "Look," Sherlock continued, leaning forward so he could stare intently at John.  "There's an online video of a horse going psychotic after a man wearing a green cowboy hat walked by its stall.  During one of the bull-rides, I also noticed a horse trying to rear when a bull was charging at it.  The rodeo clown standing beside him the same green-hatted one from earlier."
"Of course," Sherlock informed him with another matter-of-fact shrug.  "Oh don't be boring, John" he snapped, rolling his eyes at John's expression of acute disgust.  "Human cultures all over the world include insects at a part of their standard diet.  Insects are both high in fats and protein and utilize far fewer resources than conventional animal husbandry—a fact that is especially pertinent for impoverished areas.  As a livestock veterinarian, I'm sure you are aware of the ecological and environmental consequences of cramming hundreds of large animals together in a pasture.  For god's sake, that's probably one of the reasons you're a vegetarian!"
The lobby's decor was heavily influenced by the geography of the region.  There were large pots filled with succulents scattered throughout the room.  Sage-coloured walls were hung with several sets of mounted bull horns, (some measuring six feet or more, and decorated with elaborately-tooled leatherette centers), and a multitude of framed photographs.  Most of the pictures featured bulls in various contorted poses: bucking with their hindquarters almost vertical to the ground, twisting, or leaping in midair, with their powerful bodies outlined by clouds of dust and, in some cases, the flying rider's body, but a handful of other pictures depicted a bearded Doctor Sterndale.  He was smiling and shaking hands with various men dressed in the incongruous combination of expensive suits and cowboy hats—almost certainly prominent individuals amongst the rodeo profession if the outfits and backgrounds were any indicator, Sherlock deduced absently as he leaned forward to better study the smiling faces.  Several matted and framed thank-you letters also hung on the walls.  Sherlock recognized several of the names and businesses as belonging to stock contractors that supplied some of the bigger rodeo events—names he'd encountered during his research.
“So you normally say,” Sherlock replied absently, popping the envelope’s seal and pulling out the stack of photographs it contained. “Interesting…” he murmured, tilting his head to look at the top one. He blinked several times, and John’s eyebrows rose at the undisguised interest.
"We'll take one of each," Sherlock told the waitress.  "Put it on my tab.  Oh, and hold the bacon on the fries," Sherlock added after a quick sideways glance at John.  "You're vegetarian, right?  I noticed that the last two times we've eaten together, neither of your entrées contained meat."
Sherlock opened his mouth, intending to demand more details, but then shut it.  John's mulish expression did not bode well for a successful interrogation.
He could understand why.  John had an easy smile and a habit of casually flirting indiscriminately, whether it was with the harried bartender passing them drinks, or an appreciative wink at the bouncer holding open the bar's door.  John had unbuttoned his chambray shirt earlier and rolled up his shirt sleeves.  A concession to the heat, or a visible signal that he was off duty and inclined to relax?  Regardless, the fine hairs on his forearms gleamed gold in the bar's yellow light, as did the faint stubble adorning John's chin and cheeks.  The white cotton vest he wore underneath his dark blue shirt did nothing to disguise the well-muscled physique that lurked underneath.  Sherlock took a sip from one of the glasses of water that John had insisted they order.  As he did, he overheard the woman speculate on which one of them should try and fake needing 'help' remembering the rules of 8-ball.
"Because you specifically asked if we could take it slow.  I knew that when we went to that alley for some fresh air, but the next thing I knew, I had you shoved up against a damn wall and was grinding against your leg, Billy!  Hell, if it hadn't been for you starting to slur and bringing me to my senses, I would have jacked you off in that alley, no questions asked!" John shouted, his voice rife with self-recrimination.  The fingers of his left hand clenched into a fist and he thumped it against his thigh hard enough that it would probably leave a bruise.
When Sherlock’s vision had cleared, he’d found himself sitting on the ground with his head between his knees and a swearing John crouching in front of him.  Sherlock had tried excusing his dizziness as an episode of orthostatic hypotension, but John's response had been both crude and to the point.  John had helped Sherlock to his feet a second time, demonstrating far more care than he had previously, and then all but dragged Sherlock into the nearby Amarillo National Center.
"Yes.  Being able to adopt a hyper-masculine persona became a very useful form of protective camouflage when I was growing up."
“Physical therapists are the worst,” another person piped up.  “The one I had after I broke my hip falling off Dumbass would’ve made a stereotypical drill-sergeant look like a cuddly bunny rabbit.”
"I was wondering about that, actually," Sherlock had remarked casually, pouncing on the conversational segue before taking another sip of his truly excellent coffee.  "Do you have any idea why Doctor Watson happened to be at the fairgrounds the morning that Devil's Blaze went berserk?"
Sherlock bit his tongue.  Donovan wasn't giving him nearly enough credit for the lengths he was willing to go in service to the Work.  Still, she had a point.  "Fine," he huffed.  "I'll start searching for the abuse video.  If I can get a visual of the man Brenda mentioned, we might be able to bring him in for questioning."
since he'd encountered somebody who could affect him by their mere presence, Sherlock mused distantly as John continued to huff his scent.  Even Victor, who had prided himself on his reputation for sexual prowess, had had to work to generate a satisfactory response from Sherlock.  Alcohol had helped, as had the occasional dose of methylenedioxy-methamphetamine.  John though, John was barely touching him and he could already feel heat and heaviness began pooling in his groin, mute testament to the slow thrum of arousal that John was effortlessly invoking.
"Budge up," Sherlock ordered, hooking his fingers into the waist of John's jeans and crimson pants and finally,
“SHAME ABOUT THAT!  ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR HIM, WOULD YOU ALL?  HE GAVE IT A GOOD TRY!  NEXT UP, IN CHUTE NUMBER TWO, IS JAMES RYDER OOOOONNN GOOSE ‘EM!  THIS IS ONE BAAAAADDD BUCKIN’ HORSE!”
"Indeed," Sterndale said, drawing himself up haughtily, even as he glared at John.  "I am not God.  Even I, with all of years of experience, can make a mistake.  Vaccines can fail.  I have seen it happen before.  I made my diagnosis based on the symptoms I observed at the time.  I was wrong.
"Billy!"  John shoved himself to his feet and hurried forward, almost tripping in his haste.  "Mike! Is everything okay?  Do we need to call an ambulance—"
Sherlock shrugged one elegant shoulder.  "Mmm...I am hardly 'people' John," Sherlock pointed out, waving one hand dismissively.  "As you yourself said those were all accidents.  I shan't hold them against you, but please restrain yourself in the future.  I don't fancy smelling like a brewery any more than I already do."
Sherlock closed his eyes in disgust as the table full of inebriated Alpha Male idiots closest to him burst into whoops and cheers, the din punctuated by the sounds of shot glasses being slammed to the table top.  It was the third time in the last hour he'd been subjected to the display and he wasn't sure whether or not he should be grateful that the noise was loud enough to drown out the bar's sound system.
"No.  Doctor Leon Sterndale—he's a performance animal vet—called me a couple of weeks ago, asking me to keep an eye out for any rodeo animals that were acting strangely."  Doctor Früh's mouth twisted in a moue of distaste.
“A banged-up gate?  That’s all?   Sounds like you got lucky,” the blond Amazon drawled.  “Did’ja hear what happened to Doug Maberley?”
Lestrade refolded his arms and shrugged.  "Mostly by reputation at first.  You stay in any job long enough, you get to know most of the faces.  The committed ones at least.  Donovan was paired up with one of my old partners when she worked with patrol.  She's a stickler for regs.  It's one of the reasons she got head-hunted by the Fraud Division.  About ten years ago, her attention to detail uncovered a situation where a court clerk was double-billing convicted individuals for fees and surcharges and pocketing the difference."
"Good.  Then lean back," John ordered, pulling Sherlock’s hat off and guiding him backwards until he was being supported by an unpleasantly cold, painted, cinder-block wall.  Sherlock shivered.  That movement, tiny as it was, apparently served as some sort of impetus for John, because a moment later, Sherlock felt deft fingers begin plucking at the buttons of his leather waistcoat.
"Over here, Billy!" John called, waving from his station by the door.  "Hurry up!  I want you to meet a few friends of mine!"
"Easy boy, easy, you're gonna be fine," John chanted soothingly, trying to move in close enough to administer the jab, while the gelding screamed and twisted, trying to break free.  "I'm not gonna hurt you—I'm just going to give you something that'll help you calm down.  Woah, easy, boy, easy!"
The doctor straightened up, removing his glasses to polish them briefly on his shirt before sliding them back on.  His expression of tolerant goodwill morphed into an expression of surprised pleasure.  "John!  John Watson!  I didn't know you were back in town!"
Sherlock couldn't do more than nod helplessly as John bracketed his thighs with his own.  He could feel the warmth of John's body and the close proximity to John's scent was intoxicating.  It made him want to lick John all over and catalogue the different flavours and textures of John's skin.
"Thank you.  I have to be in my line of work," Sherlock replied, moving around to take John's place at Scotty's head.  "I'll hold him so you can get started."
John made a disgusted face.  “Maybe, but there’s a world of difference between mutations that result in an animal that’s plain ugly and one that’s potentially psychotic.  The pitbull's reputation comes to mind.  So does the chihuahua’s.  I hate treating them.”
When I sit with Sherlock a sense of peace takes over.  He’s sleeping a lot and that’s part of the recovery.  He’s stopped shaking and has fewer emotional swings.  We go for walks, even in the rain.
When Mary disappeared I had help too, but that was a London family. Neighbors.  I’m still in touch with them and if Rosie should come down here or if the full-time nanny needs a vacation, I think I can call upon them again. They are from my life with Mary so I don't know if we will all keep in touch, to be honest.
I left early that day.  I was agitated all over again.  Walked a lot of the way home.  Took time to think about selling the house Mary and I “shared.”  It was really her house, bought with her money.
After the text from “The Woman” and I guessed his birthday, finally I let go and confessed my infidelity.  And Sherlock came to me, and held me.  We stayed that way.  After all I did to him, he comforted me. Truthfully, he held me awhile. I never moved away.  Neither did he.
I called an estate agent and a charity mover today.  All of Mary’s things plus the items we owned together will be discarded or given to a charity. Rosie’s things are few — a special cradle that was my own as a baby.  (Harry had it and gave it to me.  I had no idea it existed.) Once I get the ball rolling on this end, I’ll go over to 221B and start setting up the upstairs bedroom.
It’s not easy finding time or place to write this.  I have to make time in moments between activities: seeing to Rosie, making sure I keep my morale up, visiting Sherlock and seeing in on his recovery.  I read newspaper articles about crimes to him and he comments.  Make sure he eats something.
We went for a walk earlier today.  When we got back, it was apparent the flat was a reeking mess.  I guess I gave a loud “huff.”  We agreed something had to be done. I can see that it’s part of Sherlock’s recovery that he perceives the mess and has enough self awareness to want to clean up. We got some black bags and started with the obvious.  When it was time for me to leave, he said he would continue and besides there were some things he would want to examine before tossing.   I think I took 5 full bags of pure garbage down to the front.  Hope Mrs Hudson doesn’t complain.
I'm still with the same therapist who I can see on my lunch hour.  But there's so much that I can’t tell her.  So I’ve decided to keep my own journal.  Perhaps writing things down will help me to clear my mind.
The nanny is settling in with Rosie.  They both live at the Holmes.  There’s enough space that Rosie and the Nanny have their own set of rooms. Then they join the Holmes for part of the day.  I visit by Skype.  For awhile I had Skype on constantly but that seemed over the top.  But you can’t be too careful.  On the other hand the nanny has a right to privacy and I can’t be watching constantly.  Though am I acting out of guilt?  Still it’s very nice to look in and see their daily scene.
Molly was supposed to have the next shift.  I contacted her, told her about the birthday, and we agreed to meet at a nearby cake shop.  We 3 must have been a sight.  Sherlock was beat-up and had “the hat” on.   Molly was so relieved that he was turning a corner that she was sort of giggly and doting on him.  My eyes must have been red. Molly and I each must have been weepy at one point or another.  Sherlock kept quiet but smiled — a sweet genuine smile that I don’t see too often. When he smiles that way, his cheeks get several big creases on each side.  He had two pieces of cake.
