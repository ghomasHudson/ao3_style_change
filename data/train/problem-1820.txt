“Just so you know, I play the violin in the middle of the night, and sometimes I don’t speak for days on end,” Sherlock threw out randomly.
“I do not recall granting you imbeciles the right to do blood work,” Sherlock shouted hoarsely. “I agreed to an IV for dehydration.”
John’s orgasm took his breath away from him, as he slumped over the omega’s form. His hips continued to hump forward, as his prick was milked of every drop of his release. His knot was the only thing keeping his cum from seeping out of Sherlock’s abused hole. He maneuvered them onto their sides, so that his knot would not injure the other man. With a sense of misplaced affection, he was sure Sherlock would disdain, John carefully petted the omega’s ribs, counting each bone before rubbing the smooth skin of his stomach. He could almost feel it growing with the sheer volume of his seed still pumping into him.
“Flat mates should really know the worst about each other before moving in together,” Sherlock answered the unspoken question.
He had seen how having Rosie had affected Mary. Had watched the woman he had thought he loved slowly losing herself to madness. It had been a slow, deceptive spiral. Until one frigid night in February  he had found Rosie strapped in her car seat, bawling, her face red raw with tears and snot.
The doctor turned to John, seeking some calm in the storm. “We can release him after his IV finishes, though we need to set up some prenatal exams before you two leave.”
Mary had screamed at him, blood red wine slopping out of the tea mug. John, to this day, could not recall what she had accused him of, the vile words that had spewed from her once loving mouth. The only thought running on repeat through his head, had been that Rosie could have died. Would have died if he had been any later that evening. He had arrived home from work two hours early. He had been working as a locum GP, for a small practice. If he had taken one more case of strep throat, his baby would have died.
“That's okay, Daddy's not married either. You can marry him and then you'll have both kids and puppies.” Rosie announced. “I think your nice, and daddy likes your stories.”
John slipped into the exam room, drawing the ire of the hospital gown clad omega on the bed. John smiled weakly at the doctor with the clipboard, before starting towards Sherlock.
John shifted restlessly from his position in the doorway. Sherlock had yet to notice his presence, and he did not want to interrupt him. At the same time, John wanted to touch his still-not-claimed mate. The alpha wanted to run his fingers over that barely there bump; he wanted to caress every inch of that luminous skin. John wanted so much more than Sherlock would permit.
“Then I am sure the bump will verbally eviscerate the little twerps, just like his daddy does.” John held onto his elbow and tried to take the majority of his mate’s weight.
“Please come in, and call me John,” he murmured as he reached out to shake the man's hand on autopilot. “Sherlock Holmes of the Science of Deduction?”
“Daddy helped. A tiny bit,” Rosie added. “Can I have a peppermint stick off the tree while we wait for them to cook?” She asked her dad.
The only problem was, that teacher really did not like children all that much. They were noisy and dirty. They rarely listened and they would not sit still. She would beat the seat out of kid's pants with a stitch if they sassed her. The kids were terrified of her.
Only to find Sherlock’s self proclaimed arch nemesis seated in John’s chair. Sherlock was perched on his loveseat, wrapped in his dressing gown, plucking notes randomly. The older man was staring at Sherlock, like he was a rather interesting lab experiment gone terribly wrong.
Maybe John would know somebody willing to talk to him. Sherlock really wanted to go back downstairs and sleep on the sofa with John. This cottage had suddenly become more sinister in the past few minutes. Sleeping alone in this room was terrifying. He knew he was a prideful man, but not that proud. He grabbed his pillow and a throw blanket, heading back to John and the safety of the Christmas tree.
Rosie nodded in agreement, “they blamed Krampus for all them though. Even the ones who got taken in the summer.”
Esme Isabelle Watson was precocious. At least that is what her grandma and uncle Mycroft called her. She knew what the word meant, kind of. It meant she was a brat. Which is what her daddy called her. Both words made her feel warm and fuzzy, loved. But not when her teacher was on the phone, tattling on her to her papa. Her papa was not going to be happy. He would sigh and look at her with sad eyes. She hated when he did that.
John nodded silently in encouragement, petting her hair much like Rosie was petting Dodger's ears. Self comfort for the win.
He tromped down the stairs and past Mrs Hudson's flat, before Sherlock enraged reply could come. It was rare that he landed a zinger on the cagey demon detective debunker.
Not caring if his clothes were ruined, John shifted into his own were form. He nuzzled Sherlock affectionately, before curling his own large body around their daughter. John couldn’t tear his eyes away from her. She was absolutely perfect, born with a riot of dark curls like her daddy. That was pretty much all John could see, but it was enough. Later, he would count her fingers and toes, but it was time to just enjoy his family.
“Well maybe I am not ready,” Sherlock growled. “We haven’t even discussed what the bump’s last name is going to be.”
“That is so reassuring,” John murmured. “Now, how about a tour of the labs, I am sure it has changed since our school days.”
“According to my parents and know-it- all brother, no.” Sherlock laughed sardonically. “It was all house settling and wind.” Sherlock took a sip of his tea. “I of course knew better. People see, but rarely do they observe.”
“The haunting is probably over,” Sherlock nodded to the ground. “Once these poor kids are given a proper burial.”
John stood up from his position on the floor. Sherlock did not generally care about what people thought of his looks. However, it had become more of a sensitive subject as his due date rapidly approached. Young kids staring at his stomach put Sherlock off his food. Donovan and Anderson’s underhanded whispers could make him brood for days. One snarky comment from Mycroft however… John winced. The flat was about to go apocalyptic.
Mycroft stood abruptly, his trusty umbrella in his hand. “You are forcing me to take matters into my own hands, Sherlock.”
The cold snap that had hit London seemed to be taking it’s toll on the alpha’s leg. There were nights that John would return from the surgery, face gray and drawn, the pain obviously unbearable, yet the man never said a word. Sherlock was intrigued by his flat mate despite himself, John was much more interesting than the silly police drama.
Across the room, his favorite mug shattered on the floor. Hot tea splattering across the old, rough hewed planks of hardwood. Mike had stopped his chattering to listen to John spew obscenities in the sudden hush of the house.
“Shut up John,” Sherlock snapped. “I want a moment of peace, if that is okay with you and my brother.”
John nodded. “I never really believed in the supernatural. I mean you don't go through war without ghosts and miracles and all that.” John put his cup down. “But that's a different sort of belief I think.”
The small tinkling doorbell rang, and the eerie giggling from the dining room stopped suddenly. John grabbed a dishtowel for his hands, wondering if Luther had changed his mind about dinner. He meandered his way to the door, in no real rush. The wavy glass inlaid into the front door distorted the shadow of the visitor. The doorknob was cold under his fingers, as he tried to twist it open. The door refused to open. It wasn't jammed. The wood was not swollen with moisture. It was the middle of winter, and the air was dry as a brittle bone. John put his weight behind his attempt, his leg aching as he tried to bully the damn door open. The knob was so cold his hand was cramping up.
“Oh god no,” John chuckled ruefully. “Me and Harry would kill each other. I am looking for a flat share, but who would want to live with me?”
That teacher lived in this cottage. And she was thriving under it all. With each missing kid, she became prettier. Her cheeks more rosy and her figure more plump and curvy.
Sherlock sneered at his podcast producer, “have you found something of interest for me? No, then piss off.”
“I like him. He likes us, and Joey thinks he's pretty.” Rosie stated, matter of fact. “You should marry him.”
His gaze locked on Sherlock's face, John brought his mouth to the head of Sherlock's cock and started kissing it, one peck after the other, his lips pressing ever so slightly to the curves of the exposed crown and the sensitive skin retracted underneath, just enough to make it clench — and see Sherlock's chin tilt all the way back in obvious enjoyment.
“You vowed to always be there. And you have. You've been there, always, ever since that day. You did more than what was required of you. Hell, you didn't even have to make a vow in the first place!... Believe me, only one of us failed the other here, and that's me.”
, technically. But it wasn't of any interest to him. John couldn't blame him: he was quite bored at the prospect of completing mundane tasks himself. But it had to be done. And they could only rely on Mrs. Hudson for so long. She wasn't their housekeeper after all!
His jeans getting tighter by the second, John stepped across the room and watched as Sherlock made his way to the cupboards above the sink, the muscles in his back rippling in motion as he lifted his arms to put a pair of tins away.
kind of surprises…” John added with a blushing chuckle, the tip of his fingers skimming over the crumpled lacy underwear pulled down below Sherlock's hips, “… but I don't need them to keep loving you. I hope you know that?”
Sherlock gave him an inquiring look and awkwardly began to move from where he was standing, unsure of what John was asking of him.
John closed his eyes once more, a sharp tingle running down his body. He could feel the curves of Sherlock's buttocks around his groin as distinctly as he would without clothes, and the mere thought of
Sherlock raised his mug to his lips and sipped a long mouthful of tea, silence settling on the kitchen. His own lips pursed in embarrassment, John glanced at him. It only took their gazes to meet for both of them to crack up.
John's chin dropped further. That was precisely what he didn't want to do. All he wanted in this very moment was to disappear off the face of the Earth, for good. But he couldn't run away from himself any longer. He had to take the responsibilities for his actions.
John felt the world crashing down around him. "N–no, please d—" His voice trailed off and he shook his head with a grimace, fists clenched in pain and anger. "Why, WHY do I have to ruin EVERYTHING!?" he roared, throwing his glass to the floor where it shattered at his feet.
As Sherlock turned again to put the last supplies in the upper cupboard, John strode up to him and seized him by the hips, pressing his mouth to Sherlock's marble-like skin between his shoulder blades. The initiative made Sherlock quiver and giggle.
The attention he showed when he was holding her shone through again as he bent over the cot to place her into it, his large hands seeming even bigger wrapped around her tiny, chubby body. He didn't let go until she was lying safe on the mattress, and when he finally did, John caught him resting gentle fingers on her stomach – a gesture that made his heart melt... and ache. What had he done...
As he stopped by the door to unbolt it, he wondered if there was a polite way to tell someone to bugger off. Probably not, but he could try his best to make it clear without sounding like an utter prick. If there was any chance he wasn't considered one already.
“It's a new item I ordered last week and which arrived today,” Sherlock cut off, straightening up from the wall and turning to face him. “Do you like it?”
“Christ…” John laughed, shaking his head at the incredible story Sherlock had just told him. It was an old case of his, a gruesome but ridiculously stupid murder he helped solve back in his younger days. John had heard many stories from his first years as a consulting detective – though he hadn't invented the job at the time – and that one was by far his favourite now. Along with the 'Jellyfish' case, maybe.
"Fine. Once and for all: I was never in love with her, she was never in love with me, it was just a game, we played, she lost. End of story."
“Tea?” Sherlock asked, still giggling from his own recollection of the events as he stood up from his chair.
A tentative arm wrapped around him while warm and gentle fingers landed on his nape over his shirt collar. "You're not alone. I'm here for you, always."
“I'm sorry,” he butted in, waiting a few seconds before looking up to meet Sherlock's questioning gaze and worried expression.
His voice trailed off and he had to close his eyes to keep the tears away. Everything he had just said sounded so meaningless and hollow compared to the pain he had caused. How was he even allowed to
He couldn't even begin to describe how grateful he was to have him by his side right now. He could have left, called it quits, especially after the way John had treated him since he'd arrived. But he didn't. He stayed, for him. How could he put up with him, John didn't know. All he knew was that he felt incredibly lucky. And he wasn't ready to let go of that feeling yet.
sensitive. He always had been, but experience didn't make him less responsive to any of John's attentions, quite the opposite. And today wasn't an exception.
“Shut up!” John grinned, squeezing him in his working hand in retaliation. As he did, Sherlock's audible smile withered away and a low groan slipped out of his mouth, to John's utmost relish. “Not laughing much anymore, eh?” he gloated, nipping at his shoulder.
As he reached the limit between skin and lace, John hooked his fingers around the elastic band and pulled it down to set Sherlock's artwork-made-flesh completely free, planting further kisses until there was no more length to cover.
But then, he was used to a more 'stimulating' environment – war zones, emergency units, explosions; investigations, chases around London, severed heads in fridges...
Sherlock smiled and stepped forward, slowly, letting John enjoy the view at his leisure. Because the bastard knew. He knew how to make John weak. Dressed to the nines in his tailored suit and coat, covered in mud after a chase, or wrapped in their bed sheets with tousled hair… He just had to give him
As he opened his eyes, John saw that Sherlock's were still closed, and his lips parted. He looked frozen in place. John couldn't tell if that was a good or a bad thing, so he waited. When Sherlock's lids fluttered up, it took a few seconds for his eyes to focus. A hazy veil was hanging over them, as if he'd just woken up, and he had to blink several times to clear it away. But once he did, the sheer incomprehension that John read in them made his heart sink.
"You did. With a look," John retorted, his jaw clamped shut, heading straight for the table to grab his glass. "And the answer is yes – I opened it tonight." He checked his watch. "An hour ago, actually," he quipped before taking a sip, looking anywhere but in Sherlock's direction.
As he made his way down Sherlock's chest, John felt a hand rush to his hair, its fingertips clinging to the shorter strands at his nape. He smiled. He was getting close to a sensitive area; one that sealed the beginning of the end for Sherlock, every single time.
As he reached the front steps of the building, he instinctively looked up and caught a glimpse of Sherlock at the window above him, his dark-hair-framed face just visible in the gap his long fingers had made in the curtains. John smiled at him and the figure disappeared.
A fond smile on his face, John came out of hiding and rested his shoulder against the door frame, arms crossed, watching as Sherlock paced the room once more.
With a besotted smirk, John kissed him once more and reached for the door behind him to push it close, rubbing his cheek at Sherlock's jaw on the way back.
The last word rang like an alarm in John's head and he came back to his senses, glancing down at both his hands to see a small stream of dark red blood dripping down his left palm.
For the first time in months, he was filled with a sense of clarity. Speaking freely and saying out loud what he had always felt deep down had made everything transparent and all the more obvious: he and Mary were done. He knew what he had to do, what he
"From a communication standpoint, yes," Sherlock said with a little smile, trying to lighten things up. John scoffed and Sherlock took another sip. "What about you?" he asked after a while, his eyes fixed ahead on the table.
John looked up at the contorting body above him and shushed him with a caress on his arm. “I hear you, Love. I got you,” he whispered in a soothing tone, and without making him wait any longer, licked his way back up to take him into his mouth.
Reaching the sink, he turned on the cold water tap and put his hand under the stream, grimacing as it washed the blood from his wound. The cut wasn't deep, which was sort of a relief. There was no shard of glass that he could see or feel, nor any nerve damage. But he was good for a week of pain, antiseptics and discomfort. Great.
"I know," he repeated, twirling the mug between his palms. "Is that why you told me she'd saved your life? That night you escaped from the hospital to expose her and accepted to...
Keeping him warm between his lips, John loosened the hand gripping at his wrist to intertwine it with his own and began to suck gently, first at the swollen head, then a couple of inches farther down, working him with his full tongue in slow rubbing or swirling motions, eyes half-closed to savour the musky flavour of his skin.
The kitchen went silent all of a sudden, and that's when John realised that Rosie had stopped crying. For a second, he feared that something had happened to her. But then he remembered that Sherlock was with her. God, Sherlock... The image of his shaken face after John had kissed him flashed into John's mind, and his stomach churned.
Tugging at the small curls above his collar he pulled away slightly, face still close to his, nose brushing against his cheek for yet another moment before he moved back for good. As he did, his eyes locked with Sherlock's and both just smiled, dissolving into silent giggles like two inexperienced sweethearts discovering love and intimacy.
sounds as part of the song. With a grin, John craned his head around the frame and shot a glance inside.
"I'll... put her back to bed," Sherlock continued in a murmur, waiting for John to gesture a yes before heading for Rosie's crib.
John closed his eyes at the sound, landing more kisses on his lover's skin to try and ignore the burning heat settling in his loins. “To?...”
Sherlock was getting rock-solid now. John could sense every pulsation of hot blood under his curled fingers, and a faint moistness gathering on his skin. And fuck was it arousing. His breathing was getting heavier too, more and more laboured as John sped up and pulled, and soon only deep sounds were coming out of his outstretched throat.
For a moment, it seemed as if they had gone back in time, when everything was simple – when they would chortle like kids on crime scenes, play board games on rainy Sundays (just
Sherlock had taken off his coat and was holding Rosie in his arms, rocking her in rhythm with his back to the door. The moonlight seeping through the curtains gave his lean figure an ethereal glow, the bouncy locks of his hair a deep blue in the semi-darkness. As he moved around the room – and on to the next verse of the song – John got a glimpse of Rosie. She was on her way back to sleep, eyes half-closed, her heavy lids flying open every now and then to keep listening to Sherlock. She really liked that song. And its singer.
The words crushed what was left of John's heart, and he closed his eyes before they could well up. "You can't help me."
“I hurt you, Sherlock. Bad. And I don't just mean…” He paused and gulped the aching lump in his throat as the scene in the morgue flashed again before his eyes. “I blamed you when it wasn't your fault. I pushed you away when you just wanted to help. I let you go through hell, and I was ready to leave you there. I'm…”
With a sniff, he took a good sip of his wine and let his gaze wander around the kitchen, then across the living room, where his eyes fell on the coffee table and the laptop sitting on it with its screen down.
“I don't know what's sexier,” he remarked while Sherlock continued to sort out the groceries, “You in lingerie or you doing domestic chores.”
“I suppose so, yeah,” John chuckled, his gaze following Sherlock's every movement with increasing lust.
for the first time in weeks. And he just wanted to enjoy it as much as he could, for as long as he would be allowed to.
Every squirt felt like a rush of newly-found heaven, and for a moment, in a flash of fuzzy yet limpid memory, John saw himself back in that very room, on that very bed, when he and Sherlock had touched for the first time — and released the tension that had been building up between them for five years. He could still hear Sherlock's voice, calling out his name and encouraging him with panted yes's, just like it was now.
But he didn't want to rush it, still. He didn't want to give in, not now, not yet. He wanted to make it last, to make Sherlock come undone bit by bit, entirely, unapologetically. And oh boy, was he going to.
John nodded and stepped closer, looking around. "Well, that's about it, I think..." He smiled and stopped in front of Sherlock who smiled at him in turn. "So... Good night, then?"
"No." Sherlock looked at him and shook his head again, smiling despite himself. "What part of 'Girlfriends are not my area' did you not understand that first night?"
John gave a quiet laugh and stepped back out of the nursery into the hallway, followed by Sherlock who pulled the door behind him. John glanced up from his shoes at him, sharing another chuckle, then averted his eyes. The cheerfulness of the previous minute had shifted into an awkward silence, and John suddenly felt very uncomfortable. He knew they would have to talk about what had happened earlier, and the very idea petrified him.
, he rejoiced some more as he watched Sherlock squirm and writhe in pleasure under him, chin tilted to the ceiling.
John smiled and placed a few wet kisses on his back, right hand sliding from Sherlock's hip to his arse, stroking it gently but firmly. “I was waiting for the right opportunity,” he said, running a finger up his crack along the lace.
They had not spoken a word since they'd gone downstairs, Sherlock immediately taking charge of the tea while John sat and watched him flutter around the kitchen, the both of them exchanging smiles and glances from time to time.
John nodded and smiled, admiring the picture before him: Sherlock Holmes, the Great Detective, holding a baby in his arms,
Sherlock hadn't dared to move and was still standing a few steps from the door, hands behind his back. Clenching his own, John walked past him, feeling more and more uncomfortable.
"I really don't deserve you..." he muttered into Sherlock's scarf after a while, more as a statement than anything else. He could almost hear Sherlock's brow furrow at his words.
John smiled. “Come here,” he murmured, holding out both his hands to Sherlock. His foggy eyes fixed on him, Sherlock obeyed and placed his hands into John's, who squeezed them with a tender look. “Let's go.”
A fuzzy and happy feeling in his heart, John licked his way up to Sherlock's jaw and captured his gaping lips to resume their kiss where they had left it, making it rougher and bitey this time around. The hand in his hair tensed and soon Sherlock responded in kind, his quickening breath mingling with John's in messy unison.
John chuckled at his confused face and gave him a tender smile. "What happened to the Great Detective's observation skills, uh?"
For quite some time again, both lay gazing at each other in content silence, John tracing invisible lines on Sherlock's resting arm and kissing his face, here and there, until Sherlock brought them back to reality.
"Ta," John said as Sherlock put a steaming mug of tea on the table in front of him, then sat on the next chair with his own, his large hands wrapping around the ceramic and almost making it disappear from view.
Usually, the sole sight of his long and thin hands busying around was enough to give him ideas when he was in the mood. But today, he didn't even know where to look. Bare chest, bare arse, bare shoulders, bare arms, bare stomach, bare thighs… bare milky skin all around that he was longing to touch and feel and kiss.
Biting his lips, he looked at Sherlock's figure sprawled across the bed and started pumping, fast, gaze fixed on his lover and his chest covered in thick, white cum; his white, marble-like skin; his white, lacy underwear…
A naughty smile crossed Sherlock's face. “Yes, sir,” he complied, sitting on the edge of the bed and laying back across the rumpled bedding, his mint green eyes resolutely locked on John.
Resting his hands on his hips in jaded disbelief, he stared back down at the opened bottle, his brain empty and blank, and eventually reached for it along with his glass to bring them both to the living room. With a muffled grunt, he sat down in the middle of the couch, turned on the TV to a random channel, and poured himself another round before leaning back.
Sherlock swallowed with difficulty and lowered his head. “Well, as I said not long ago, my life is a currency I do not know how to spend,” he replied in a raw voice.
An hour could have passed and he wouldn't have noticed. He was feeling good; good and safe. It hadn't always been like that; especially when pain and frustration were the only sentiments that being close to Sherlock would arouse in him. But things had changed now. He didn't have to hide anymore. He didn't have to pretend to be someone he was not. He could be himself, and finally at one with his feelings. And the sense of forbidden love and desire that Sherlock once embodied belonged to the past. He was his sanctuary now. A new hope. A promise for the future.
Before Sherlock could answer, John pushed his bulging crotch into him and quickened the pace of his fist, letting out a grunt as Sherlock's hips arched against him.
His mouth ajar, he blinked the tears away and looked down for a couple of seconds, a misty smile making its way to his lips. "Sure you won't regret it?" he asked, staring back up at John.
"No, no. It was... mean, inconsiderate, and absolutely uncalled-for. I... was being a dick. For a change..."
“Yes? What is it?” Sherlock asked, his voice so soft and attentive that it made John's stomach turn a bit more. He cleared his throat and took a deep breath to gather his courage.
about anything, at least. Well, only about Rosie. And even then... he knew he could do better, way better.
John gave him a gentle squeeze and curled his fingers back around his mug, grinning at the memory of that unforgettable 29
“John…” Sherlock called again, this time in a more desperate and needy way, his hips giving an involuntary thrust against John's face.
John was in no better shape. His little teasing game was getting him just as worked up as Sherlock, and the throbbing sensation in his boxers was becoming particularly uncomfortable, to say the least. But he enjoyed himself too much to stop. He wanted Sherlock to lose all the control he had left. He wanted to drive him near the edge, make him beg for more. And oh boy, was he gonna beg.
Drained from any ounce of energy he had left, John offered no resistance and let himself be pulled against Sherlock's chest, face still hidden behind his hand. He immediately felt at home, relieved, as if all the weight of the past weeks had been lifted off his shoulders. Sherlock's breathing was calm and deep, but John could sense the strong drums of his heart beneath, which, oddly enough, appeased him.
God, did he love his cock. He loved everything about him, really. But his cock was one of those parts of Sherlock's body that made John go gaga, with his curls and eyes and lips and hands. And voice. Jesus, his voice. His damn pants-wetting, boner-inducing sultry voice. One look, one touch, one word, and John was inevitably done for. He just couldn't resist him.
It was John's turn to shake his head. "I'm done waiting, Sherlock. We've waited for too long already. We lost and wasted too much time. I..." He paused to gather his courage and finally say the words he had kept buried all these years, a heavy thump in his chest as he did. "I love you, Sherlock. I love you, and I want to show you. Let me show you. Please. Let me..."
John looked at him for a moment, a fond expression on his face. “I don't,” he said gently. “But it's one of them. The soldier, the doctor... and the man who hates himself so much that he needed to take it out on someone else to avoid lashing out on himself, more than usual.”
Sherlock's stomach shook and rumbled against John as a low chuckle rose from his throat. John's smile widened.
Breathing him in one last time, John slowly released hold of him and took a step back, his hands sliding down to settle on Sherlock's shoulders. Once again, his smile met Sherlock's, and with one last look they both sealed their silent pledge.
For a split moment, it seemed that time had stopped. Sherlock wouldn't move or even breathe, just stood there with his big, dilated eyes fixed on him. But soon reality hit back and he resumed blinking, in the same way he had earlier, his mouth sliding open in a mute reply.
John knew him inside out — what he liked, what he didn't like, what turned him into a whimpering mess, what made him uncomfortable, where he loved to be touched, where he didn't want John to linger, how he preferred to be handled, when he preferred to be handled…
John licked his lips, mouth staying dropped open at the sight. Warm daylight shone on the front of Sherlock's lean, pale body through the curtains, highlighting every salience and hollow in a sublime play of shadows, and John could make out the curve of his cock underneath the transparent lace pattern. He swallowed hard again.
Biting at Sherlock's shoulder again to distract his body from its urges, John tightened the grip of his unemployed hand on Sherlock's hip and focused on the twist and turns of his moving wrist, not leaving any part of his lover's length untouched.
. If he didn't know better, he would have thought himself back in Afghanistan, on those nights when he'd stop a fight between two drunken comrades in arms. Except
Holding him down by the waist, John carried on and kissed his way down Sherlock's length, inch by inch, appreciating the soft and hardly veiny texture under his lips.
The question hung in the air as John pondered whether to lie or not. What did he have to lose, anyway? Nothing. Not anymore. So why keep pretending? He couldn't fool him any longer now. Might as well go all the way down. Like a soldier.
John nodded his acknowledgement and sucked in a long, relieved breath, giving Sherlock's hand one last pinch. "I'm gonna go upstairs to get you a pillow and a blanket," he said as he stood up.
Before him, at the very same window he had seen him earlier, Sherlock was standing. Naked. Except for a piece of lingerie. White lace lingerie. Barely covering up his hip and… John swallowed… crotch. He was leaning from side-on with his left hand against the wall, thin fingers spread on the wallpaper, his other arm casually hanging next to him, his right leg held back so one could admire the inside of the thigh opposite — and what was between them.
Baby food, opened tins of various kinds, leftovers from the night before... Everything inside looked terribly unappealing. But he had to eat something. And something healthy, so far as possible. He was trying to stay fit after all.
"And if you hadn't? Met me? Would you have tried to... see him again? Once his assignment was over? To... pick up where you left off?"
“Yes, I know, it's against the rules of British etiquette. But we'll make up for it tonight with the height of Britishness on DVD.”
, at least a bit more than he did now. How could things have gone so wrong? Why was it happening to him? What had he done to deserve—
John looked up at him again, then at his bandaged palm. "Oh, um..." He had almost forgotten about it. "Fine, it's... just a minor cut. Nothing to worry about," he said with a flashed smile, his gaze flicking down almost as quickly.
A painful throb in his chest, he searched Sherlock's features again, trying to find an answer, trying not to hope, not
"I really don't," John smiled, hooking his chin over Sherlock's shoulder. "But I'm glad you're here."
Sherlock's call seemed to come from far away, drowned in the noise of John's inner turmoil. He could barely see his tall silhouette approaching out of the corner of his eye.
The smile that the detective had been showing until now faded away, his brows furrowing in confusion. "We... agreed last week to meet at your place tonight, to check on Mary?... Don't you remember?..."
For a minute, it felt as if Sherlock had stopped breathing. His chest wasn't moving against John's anymore, and John could sense his heartbeat going stronger. But when Sherlock's stomach resumed its slow rise and fall, and his clasp tightened around John's body, John knew. Fighting back a new wave of tears, he grasped the back of Sherlock's neck again and reached up to stroke his curly hair, cupping the curve of his head with the palm of his hand.
John's chest tightened. “Yeah, well, you shouldn't have,” he croaked, a single tear slipping down his cheek which he quickly wiped with the tip of his fingers, looking away for a bit. When he peeked back at Sherlock, he saw that his jaw had dropped slightly.
The teasing command made Sherlock tremble and give a long, flustered sigh. “Yes, captain,” he whispered back, offering John the rawest and most lustful look as he faced him again.
John stared into Sherlock's face, trying to ignore the tingling heat building inside him. “I… I, um…” he stammered, unable to think — and to stop himself from glancing down at his partner's lower region. “Wh–what is…”
of January when both their paths crossed, never to fully part, for better or worse. He could still see him, all young and smart and handsome in his impeccable tailor-made suit, focused on whatever experiment he was conducting that day, glancing across at him and Mike as they walked in the room. Polite, but with an ounce of arrogance and pretentiousness. And
"No. I simply don't think he cares one way or the other," Sherlock explained, as always, like it was the simplest thing in the world. There was something else in his voice, though, something that rang with a hint of the anger that he had so blatantly displayed earlier. "Attempting to kill someone in a crowded room with the express intention of remaining anonymous is ambitious indeed, incredibly so. Something like that would have to be perpetrated by someone with a great amount of expertise in this area, someone who would have planned their crime well enough to keep any sort of law enforcement from finding out about the attempt the day before it was set to happen. No, getting caught would neither hurt nor help this killer's cause. They simply want Hurst dead by any means necessary, and they want a lot of people to see it happen."
“I was completely enamoured with him at that point,” Sherlock explained. “There was nothing he could do that I wouldn’t find a way to justify, to rationalize. I’d never really had a friend before, let alone someone who was romantically interested in me. I didn’t know it should be any different.” He glanced up, saw John’s sour expression, and shrugged again. “I do now, of course.”
“Sorry,” Victor said, from his perch on an upturned stone a few feet away. “But, you know-” he gestured to the bandage on his own head- “turnabout’s fair play.”
What little was left of Victor- only the ashes of his car, really- was buried in a crowded city cemetery, his grave simple and utilitarian. A small headstone, pale and plain, was all that was left of him, just his name carved into it above the dates of his birth and death, frozen at seventeen years of age for the rest of eternity. Seventeen seemed like a whole lifetime ago.
Sherlock shrugged, evasive. "There really isn't. We'll have to mingle with dreadfully boring people for several dreadfully boring hours, whilst some dreadfully boring criminal tries to commit murder in the middle of a crowd."
“We set up a couple of cots in one of the empty offices,” Lestrade offered. “If you two would like to get some sleep.”
They’d made it inside, but barely got up to the landing before Sherlock was grabbing John and kissing him soundly, thoroughly, desperately. John stiffened in surprise, but quickly gave himself over, backing Sherlock against the nearest wall. Sherlock hummed into the kiss as John stroked his face, letting his cane clatter to the floor.
"Ask," Sherlock whispered anyway. He was leaning forward toward John, so close that he could see himself reflected in John's pupils.
“However, that does leave the question,” continued Martin, “that if you didn’t help Victor Trevor escape, then who did?”
John had had so many blood tests lately, he would know if he had anything. It wasn’t as if he’d had sex at all in recent months. And there was Sherlock, naked beneath him, begging-
“Sherlock?” John asked, lifting his head, catching Sherlock’s stare and pulling it back down from outer space. "Do you want me to stop? If it's too much-"
On this night, John is woken up by Sherlock once again, just not in a way that he ever has been before.
“King David’s was an estate house, before it was expanded into a school. There was a cemetery on the grounds and a chapel, long abandoned. The only part of the floor left intact was the solid stone slab where the altar had been. Victor and I would sneak out some nights, to smoke. One spring, we fell asleep there.”
“How very observant.” Mycroft smiled a patronizing smile, which John had long ago become convinced was the only kind of smile Mycroft had. “As it happens, I am here today because I once again require the services of my younger brother, intransigent as he may be.”
Sherlock had left quickly after that, knowing that whatever John said next would surely have been altogether unbearable. He hadn't been quick enough, though, and John had been alerted to his presence. He'd foolishly hoped that John would come running after him, to stop him, but John hadn't, cementing in Sherlock's mind just how attached he had become, as opposed to how attached John was not.
- a file already bursting with well-worn memories of everything from commonplace hellos and goodbyes to raucous laughter to half-hearted complaints and even,
He hadn't been here since the burial, a humid, orange day in the high heat of August, a day that was nothing like this one. It hadn't occurred to him that he should ever visit- Victor wasn't really here, anyway.
“Right, yeah.” They had been blueberry, and they had been delicious. “I suppose there’s no point in asking you to eat something tonight, then.”
“Angelo’s,” John decided, sensing Sherlock’s restlessness in the wake of Mycroft's visit, his need to get some air and clear the cobwebs from his head.
“Yeah, well, objectively, you have no evidence that Sherlock has done anything wrong,” John fired back. “This- taking off after a hunch without telling anyone where he’s gone- this is normal for him. It’s not an indicator of criminal activity.”
"Just after three." Sherlock isn't looking at John anymore, John notes- there must be something quite interesting on the wall over John's shoulder, for all Sherlock's eyes seem to be boring a hole in it.
Victor spread his arms, stepping back until Sherlock could once again see the whites of his eyes. “Ask away.”
Sherlock attempted to run the math in his head, but found that this part of his brain to be nothing but a deep, dense fog. He leaned his head back and found that it helped, a little. The grey light was filtering through the clouds, casting vague and jagged shadows of a collapsed ceiling and sharp branches, yet to bloom.
“Excellent.” Sherlock was up and out of the room at once, presumably to go and get dressed. This left John with a half-finished drink and an ever-growing list of questions.
“Obviously, John. Do keep up,” Sherlock admonished with a frown. John rolled his eyes, feeling a bit like he’d gotten whiplash. There was the warm smiling just a moment ago, and now this.
The car ride to the embassy was a quiet one. The more open, talkative Sherlock had retreated back into his silent shell, a distant and somewhat morose look on his face as he stared out the window at the cold, rainy street. The only sign of life was his foot, bouncing incessantly with a restless sort of dread that didn’t match the rest of his outward demeanour.
There was a moment of tense silence, every muscle in the room pulled taut. An unblinking, unwavering glare passed between Sherlock and Mycroft the likes of which John had never seen. Sherlock looked as though he might take a swing at Mycroft at the slightest provocation, and John had realised there was a lot more at stake here than just death threats against an ambassador, though he had no idea what
Sherlock obliged, lowering his hand, only to cry out when John crooked his fingers, sending white sparks flying at the corners of Sherlock’s vision. He continued to curse under his breath; the discomfort had faded, and all that was left was the promise of what was to come.
When John had seen Sherlock in the suit for the first time, earlier at Baker Street, he had nearly been floored. There had been a moment of near insurmountable temptation, the kind one gets in a museum when standing before a great masterpiece. He wanted so much to run his fingers across Sherlock’s shoulder, down the line of his waist, like putting his fingers in the grooves of brushstrokes that had been placed so carefully, just so, the texture visible to the eye but so much more pleasing to the touch.
"Sherlock," he whispers, not opening his eyes, already knowing the answer to the question he's about to ask. "You up?"
“Yes,” Sherlock said, falling back on his seat, leaning heavily against the altar, closing his eyes as sirens rose in the distance. “He has been for a long time.”
"Only if they want to get away with it." Sherlock had barely touched his food, which made John all the more curious as to why Sherlock had even suggested dinner in the first place.
“No,” he exclaimed, taking fistfuls of John’s jumper, pulling him as close as nature would allow. “It’s not too much- it’s not
“You’re not so bad yourself.” He reached up and pulled his hands through John’s hair, mussing it thoroughly. Ever since the incident, when the back of his head had been shaved for surgery, John had been wearing his hair in a crew cut- sheared close on the sides but a little longer on top. This hairstyle had been the source of endless fantasies for Sherlock in the past few weeks. It must have been close to how John had worn it when he was younger, before Sherlock had known him. A little younger then, leaner, fewer scars. But the same heart. The same hands.
“Is this really necessary?” Sherlock raised his hands, bound with silver tape. His ankles were as well. “Am I to be your prisoner?”
“Yeah, but not until too late,” Victor confessed. “When his people broke me out. One of them let slip that they were going to frame you, convince everyone that you’d been my accomplice the whole time. And then I knew, and I decided to do something about it.”
"I ran into an old friend from uni one day, said he could help me find a flat mate. Took me to the lab at St. Bart's, our old stomping ground. And there was this bloke, with fantastic hair and incredible cheekbones who opened his mouth right away and told me stuff a stranger couldn't know, invited me to live with him and-"
With a snap of his wrist, Sherlock knocked the crystal tumbler out of Hurst’s hand- it hit the ground with a glittering crash, spraying scotch and sparkling shards of glass across the marble floor, pulling everyone’s attention in an instant.
“I don’t know if it’ll work, though,” John continued, trying to lighten the mood. “Those two probably aren’t all that afraid of me. I’m no one important.”
“Mycroft!” Sherlock, not too far behind John, stormed into the conference room, shouting, pointing a finger as he did so. “How the
“I really do.” Sherlock kissed the scar again, and John relaxed a little into the touch. “It’s a part of you.” He kissed his way slowly down John’s chest, mapping John’s ribs with his hands.
John began to pick up the pace, moving to deeper thrusts, groaning as Sherlock’s muscles clenched around him. Somewhere else in his brain, in whatever part of it that wasn’t addles but his approaching climax, John could feel himself tiring, the pain in his leg beginning to flare. He gritted his teeth but didn’t slow down, pleasure driving him to the edge of his limits.
The case had been brought to their attention by none other than Mycroft himself. John had been home at the time, had just come from work, in fact, so there hadn’t been any fuss, no helicopters at countryside crime scenes come to whisk him off to some palace or another. Mycroft was simply
“The camera footage in the courthouse was erased.” Martin sighed. “So, we’re starting at a disadvantage.”
, as Angelo always put it, the one in the corner next to the window, candle and all) the minute they walked through the door. John had given up protesting Angelo's long-standing assumption that John and Sherlock were a couple, an assumption which had dwindled to quiet smiles and knowing looks but was still very apparent. It was almost encouraging at this point, knowing that at least one other person thought there might be something more to the relationship- it certainly wasn't doing anything to dull John's sharp-edged, almost painful hope that someday, by some miracle, the assumption might actually be correct.
not by his own desires. He forced himself to breathe, to remind himself how John really felt, to remind himself of what John had said that day at Battersea, in the moments before he'd found out Sherlock had been listening.
For an instant, Sherlock's entire face fell, more shadow than light in the warm, flickering glow of the candle. John might have thought he was seeing things if not for what happened next. Sherlock reached out and touched John's sleeve- more than that, he put his whole hand over John's forearm, stilling John's hand and making sure he had John's attention.
"He was a professor at the time. He taught history and politics and mentored those students who he believed showed the most promise. He had a special class on weekends for sixth form students- every spring he would post eight names, eight fifth-year students that would be accepted into his special class in the fall."
“I need you to know, John,” Sherlock whispered, “that the way I feel about you- and subsequently the way you make me feel about myself- is incomparable. I could search for a thousand years and never find its like.”
Sherlock rolled onto his back, luxuriating in the chaos of hormones crashing through his system. He squinted at the bright bathroom light and closed his eyes, listening to the sound of John moving around, running water. It was lulling- Sherlock felt tired in a way he knew he could very easily become addicted to, if he hadn’t already.
Sherlock was blushing, from the tops of his cheekbones to the center of his chest, which was rising and falling in quick, shallow breaths. John's eyes followed a soft, thin trail of hair that began below Sherlock's navel, darker and curling as it got lower- until John's eyes landed on Sherlock's cock. It was a little like the rest of him- longer than it was thick, hard and flushed an even darker pink than Sherlock's face.
John gasped when Sherlock’s fingertips went right to the starburst of scar tissue that marred his shoulder. Sherlock traced the shape of it, slowly, methodically, focus narrowed to a hairpin point. John held still and held his breath, struck speechless by this affection. When Sherlock kissed the scar a moment later, a noise left John’s mouth that even he hadn’t expected- something like a wounded animal, maybe, a wounded man.
Sherlock whimpered and kissed John hungrily, rutting instinctively against John’s hip. John kissed him back, slotting a leg between Sherlock’s, tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
“Do you remember that summer, in the country?” Victor’s breathing was absolutely ragged now, coming shallower on every inhale.
, put down the paper, as well as his mug. He crossed his hands on the table in front of him, tilted his head down and looked at Sherlock through his eyelashes. The blue of his eyes was stormy-coloured in the gloomy light that came in through the kitchen window. The same earnestness that was present in John's voice last night was present now, but it was tinged with a kind of firmness that reminded Sherlock of the way John talked when he was taking charge of a situation. It sent something like a shiver shooting up Sherlock's spine.
a doctor." John hooked his hands behind Sherlock's knees, pulling him closer, knocking him onto his back once again. He leaned forward, caging Sherlock in. "And it's my medical opinion that if I don't get to fuck you right now, I might actually die."
. The words were crowded behind Sherlock's teeth, ready to leap out of his mouth at the slightest allowance. "Maybe not anyone," he said instead. "Anderson wouldn't have come to that conclusion unless it had been scratched into the floor in German."
It was then that John appeared from the far end of the chapel, gun in hand. Sherlock, though he had gone to great pains not to involve John in any of this, was embarrassingly relieved to see him, the way he was always relieved to see John- in the early morning, snoring softly- late afternoon, in the quiet of the kitchen, poring over takeaway menus. Relief like the moments after a lost foot chase, huffing and puffing and laughing beneath the flicker of a streetlight.
“Every day for as long as you want me,” John answered, breath warm and real on the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
“I’m fine. A mild concussion, perhaps, but I’m uncertain. Nothing permanent, in any case.” He looked at the gun. “He’s unarmed, John. He hasn’t threatened me.”
“Mister Trevor was being held at the Royal Courthouse in preparation for the opening session of his trial,” Martin explained. “Security was more lax than it would have been in a prison. The security assessment didn’t indicate that he’d be much of a problem- and now four officers are dead.”
John was tempted, oh so tempted, to run downstairs and see what Sherlock's suit looked like. He could do it so easily.
Of course, none of that was comparable to this moment, this reality- that John loved him, that John wanted him, that John
Victor simply squinted, tilted his head as if Sherlock had spoken in a different language. “Why would you say no? Don’t you see? This is the perfect solution!”
“Condoms? John huffed, already sitting up, moving toward the nightstand. Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
"-fallen in love with you, yeah." Even in the dark, John can see Sherlock blushing despite his pensive expression. John can't help but smile just a little.
“Mycroft.” John stopped in the doorway, and unconscious decision on his part to stay on the side of the room closer to Sherlock. “Has something happened?”
John had expected Sherlock to become more tense and less talkative the closer they came to having to leave. But once he had told John the whole story, elaborating on some of the details seemed to become easier for him. Not wanting to badger him, John tried to keep his questions to a minimum. He was really just glad to see Sherlock eating so readily, and for the second time in one day.
Sherlock took one last pull from the cigarette and stepped forward, leaving the still smoking stub on top of the headstone. His fingers lingered on the cold marble and he tapped out a silent rhythm, a goodbye, a last kiss of sorts. Then he turned his back and walked away. It began to rain.
. Dreadfully tedious, I can assure you. However, as someone who is in constant dealings with her Majesty’s international interests, I have been forced to attend this event for several years.”
“Sherlock,” Victor called out, impatient, barely having acknowledged John’s presence. “We need to leave. Now. Before they suspect anything.”
“Well, then,” he said a moment later, lips barely brushing John’s as he spoke, “you’d better get on with it, Doctor Watson.”
As the signs for King David’s became more frequent, Sherlock took a short jog west, followed by another north turn, until the streets became dirt, soaked into mud by recent rain. Past the last road sign, off the beaten trail, there was a service road. Where once it had been frequently used, it was now overgrown- certainly not passable by car.
“Don’t keep quiet,” John said, gently, although it had the edge of an order to it. “I want to hear you.”
That should be it- the end of it- but John could only help but wonder if anything like this could ever really be over.
"You have it memorised." Unsurprisingly- Sherlock had many pieces of music filed away in his mind palace. John imagined that music must be one of the easier things to remember.
“Our intelligence is limited. We have no way of knowing what sort of person the assassin will be, whether they will be posing as a staff member or a diplomat or even a civilian guest. We only know there will be an attempt on someone’s life.”
.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Now, if you’re finished being dumbstruck at my apparently shocking admission of hunger- would you like to go to Angelo’s, or shall we order take-away?”
John slicked his fingers, nudging Sherlock’s legs apart as he moved in close to his body. Sherlock felt the callus on John’s left thumb stroking the inside of his thigh, just before the first stretch of John’s finger pushing gently inside of him. He gasped a little but leaned into the touch, letting himself fall backward, bending his knees upward, lifting his hips, anything to let John get the best angle.
me. In bed. From the second we got back from the crime scene, until the second Lestrade broke down the door.”
“Both of you, shut up!” Sherlock snapped. He closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to think between the dull beats of the pounding in his head.
"Sorry. Yeah, I'm fine, I was just lost in thought." Thoughts that suddenly paled in comparison to how good the food tasted. John hadn't realised just how hungry he was. He chewed slowly and hoped to God that Sherlock wouldn't pry further than that. When it seemed that Sherlock might, John quickly changed the subject.
been one aborted attempt at a conversation on John's part, but Sherlock had ignored it, sure that it would only end in Sherlock's confession of his feelings, feelings which would ultimately lead to John's departure from Baker Street and the partial or (more likely) complete dissolution of their friendship. Sherlock had decided then and there that living without John's love would be tolerable, if only barely, but living without John's friendship- that would certainly prove fatal, one way or another.
John is no stranger to being woken up at odd hours by his enigmatic flat mate. He has been barged in upon during sleep no less than four times with declarations of the game being afoot, of cases that simply must be solved and twenty-four hour Chinese places with sesame chicken that simply must be eaten after said cases have been solved. On those nights, John has returned to bed in the early hours of the morning, barely being able to shut his eyes and calm his adrenaline-spiked heartbeat before his alarm goes off.
something, that this touch wasn't without pretense, that John had some other motivation for it- but Sherlock was a scientist in all things, and so he could not allow himself to give into this bias, not even for a second. Simply
“He knows that. Which is why your reputation won’t be enough for him. Eventually, he’s going to decide that he wants you dead, and no one’s going to be able to stop him.”
"I had known Victor little more than a year at that point. He was by no means at the top of our class, but Hurst offered him a spot in the inner circle nonetheless, which I considered odd, to say the least. He knew the challenges that would face him if he joined, but he was convinced that being in Hurst's class was the thing he needed on his transcripts for university- his father's money was new, his influence not as far-reaching as the fathers of some of our other classmates. He had much more ambition than I did- enough ambition for the both of us- he didn't want to be in the class unless I agreed to be in it as well."
“You’ve only been in here ten minutes,” Sherlock told him, falling back heavily onto his cot; the frame creaked as he rolled onto his side, struggling to get comfortable.
might entail. He moved slowly, cautiously, stepping closer to Sherlock, fighting the urge to reach out and touch him, to smooth the frown lines from his face before they got stuck there.
“That was a long time ago, Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice was barely louder than a whisper, and John was officially convinced that there was something else going on. “It has been said that holding onto anger is akin to drinking poison and expecting another person to die.”
“Moriarty doesn’t leave loose ends,” Sherlock repeated, swaying a little as he regained his footing, walking toward Victor. “So the question remains- why are you here?”
"You're not going to ask me what happened." It wasn't a question, but Sherlock was admittedly a little confused.
“Dead?” John’s jaw dropped just a little. “I knew he was capable of killing, but to overpower four guards-”
Sighing and stretching, John kicked off his shoes, shed his jacket, and turned out the light. He checked his phone out of habit- the battery was low. Of course, he hadn’t had the time or the presence of mind to grab his charger before they’d been rushed down here.
The tears Sherlock was holding back had started to flow. “My apologies, John. I suppose I’m not accustomed to being around people who truly have my best interests at heart.”
John scoffed fondly and rolled his eyes, leaning away. Sherlock wanted to pull him back in by the front of his jumper.
This was how they found themselves walking back to Baker Street, cheeks touched pink by the wine and the cool evening air in equal measure, neither of them drunk so much as generally buzzed by the good company they'd found themselves in.
On this night, John falls asleep with Sherlock in his arms, sweat cooling on their skin, moonlight and the city's glow streaming in through the window of Sherlock's bedroom, pooling in the sheets around them and spreading across the floor. John drifts off slowly, exhausted in the best way, an enormous weight lifted from his shoulders and the warmth of Sherlock's body melting him into the mattress. It's bound to be the best sleep of his life, he thinks, his last thought before unconsciousness takes him.
"A little," Sherlock admitted. It was the kind of thing that would normally have been accompanied by a shrug, but the air didn't seem light enough for it just then, like it was weighing down on Sherlock's shoulders with whatever Sherlock wasn't saying.
Sometimes it's the violin that pulls John from his rest, when Sherlock himself should be sleeping, when his playing becomes slightly less than perfect and he gets frustrated, drawing the bow violently against the strings, just long enough to wake John. Sherlock always seems to realize his mistake, however belatedly, silencing the violin's caterwauling almost as abruptly as he starts it, transitioning immediately into some soft lullaby or another, undoing the damage and sending John back to sleep within minutes.
“So, what now then?” John looked around at the faces of all those gathered, and none of them seemed to have an answer.
was the gun Sherlock had suspected was hidden somewhere. John instinctively raised his weapon as well, and then it was the kitchen at Baker street all over again, only this time Victor was pointing his gun at Sherlock.
“Not forever,” Victor responded. “But I need you to hear me out, and you always were best as a captive audience.” He hopped down from his seat and came to stand over Sherlock, blocking out the light, becoming a shadow himself. “You knew I would be here, and you came, so there has to be some part of you that wants to hear what I have to say.”
"I'm so sorry, Sherlock," John said, voice soft yet strong in a way that only John's voice could be. John spoke like this so rarely that Sherlock was a little taken aback by it. He closed his eyes, scrambling to capture the intonation and inflection, to fold it carefully and put it away in his mind palace in the file labeled
The suit was without doubt the nicest thing John had ever owned. He laid it out on his bed and stared at it for what felt like ages, trying to guess how many months rent it was worth. It was incredibly bespoke, nothing like John would have chosen, though he did like how it looked. Navy blue with a light blue pinstripe, a three button jacket and even a waistcoat, navy blue minus the pinstripe, a tie to match the pinstripe. There were round, gold cufflinks to pin into the sleeves of the crisp, white shirt. The brown Oxford shoes were shined within an inch of their life- he could count his own eyelashes in the reflection.
“He was using you,” Sherlock said. “More than you were using him. Hurst, too-” this was a new realisation, one that crested overhead like a wave and crashed onto him, cold and abrupt. “He helped Hurst orchestrate the false death threats, knowing that Hurst wanted to embarrass me, knowing that you would be there to embarrass me even further. That’s what all of this was about, all along.”
It might have been a side effect of the possible concussion, but Sherlock found himself absolutely dumbfounded by this turn of events.
John rolled his eyes, but he was holding back a smile. And there was that hope again, stubborn and fluttering in Sherlock's chest- hope that John might forgive him for this, that this might not be their end.
"Sh-" John began, suddenly aware that he was about to say Sherlock's name in a quiet, breathless way. "So, what happened after that- after you started going to Hurst's class?"
"Yeah. I'm your friend, Sherlock- I'm not going to force you to spill your guts about every bad thing that's ever happened to you." It was John's turn to reach out, to put his hand on Sherlock's arm, the warmth of his palm bleeding right through Sherlock's sleeve and seeping into his skin. It made Sherlock feel shivery, almost, like his hands might start to shake if he let them. John looked at Sherlock the same way he touched Sherlock, with a warmth that reached Sherlock all the way to his core. His hand rested there for one long, glorious second, the warmth remaining even after John moved away.
after my mum and-” a pause, a cough, wet and dry at the same time, “-nd after you.” Victor’s eyes were glassing over- they had stopped searching, having never found what they were looking for.
Before John could say anything, Sherlock swung a leg over John’s hips, sinking down onto his cock in one fluid motion. He moaned loudly at the feeling of John inside of him again, at this new angle, his own weight seating John’s cock further inside of him. He barely hesitated before beginning to rock his hips, careful not to jostle John’s injured leg anymore than was necessary.
“Although,” Sherlock continued, “it’s perfectly natural that you would be, given how many denials you’ve made over the years.”
John spent the next few minutes staring intently at the garment bag and resisting the urge to open it. A silly urge to resist, really. This suit was made for him, after all. He wouldn't have to check to see if it would fit- he didn't doubt that Mycroft had sized him up the moment they'd first met. And the party wasn't for several hours yet anyway. There was really no reason to do anything but sit and finish his breakfast.
Sherlock lit a cigarette, holding the lighter flame close to his hand for longer than necessary, letting it go out only when it really began to sting. He stood back from the grave and sighed out a heavy cloud of smoke, waiting for the skies to open up and rain as it looked like they would.
“I can think of one person with a known connection,” Anderson offered, all too enthusiastically. “A shared history with Trevor, and an intellect capable of tampering with the courthouse security system.”
Another moment, another beat, and Mycroft ostensibly relented, folding his coat over his arm and using his umbrella to push himself to his feet. “Very well, I suppose I’ll be on my way, then.” He made his way past John with a perfunctory nod, stopping in the doorway to throw the last word over his shoulder.
Thankfully, traffic on the highway was minimal, and soon the exit for Colchester appeared just ahead. Sherlock turned off of the main road almost as soon as he had gotten onto it, circumventing town entirely and driving a straight shot north.
John, who had chosen that moment to take another sip of his coffee, nearly choked in surprise- not only at the implication of what Sherlock was saying, but at the look on Sherlock's face when he'd said it.
“This year's gala, however, is already proving to be a different sort of affair,” Mycroft continued. “I have it on good authority that there is to be an assassin present at tomorrow night’s
“I got proof,” Sherlock grinned. “I got audio of Red-beard talking and thermal reads of extreme temperature drops and spikes.”
The mist in his pale eyes was as dense as it was a few moments earlier, but a gleam of longing anticipation was now piercing through it.
With a gasp he pulled away again, clinging on the curls at Sherlock's nape as he cracked his eyes open, meeting Sherlock's. They were bright with emotions that he never thought he'd see in them; emotions he never thought he'd see directed at
: desire, fulfilment, love... There was some timorousness among them too, and regret – the regret not to have showed him sooner, to have caused him pain.
It had been a week since John, Mrs Hudson, Molly and Lestrade began to take turns to stay with Sherlock during his rehab, and he was doing a lot better. His left eye was still bloodshot – though almost back to normal – and his body still weak from drug abuse and ill-nourishment, but he looked healthier and… yes, somehow happier than he had in days. Which made John's heart beam as much as it was making it burn.
Sherlock tensed up again and threw his curly head backwards with a gasp, cock twitching in John's palm — whose own responded in kind.
"But that's the point, isn't it?" John carried on, driven by the exhilarating freedom to finally speak up. "None of this would have happened. We wouldn't be here, talking about all this. Yeah, we could have gone about it way earlier, sure. But we didn't know. And maybe we needed this. Maybe... we needed to hit the lowest point to rise up higher, I don't know. All I know is that... even though I regret the time we wasted – and the pain – in the end, we are the choices that we make. And this..." he placed his hand over Sherlock's once more, holding it tight, "this... is mine. Today."
An intense wave of relief washed over John, who struggled not to get carried away with emotion again. “Thank you,” he let out in a breath. “I feel like I really don't deserve it, but… I'm…” He tried to find the right word, but nothing that he could come up with even began to cover how grateful he was. “Thank you.”
"John, y–your hand..." Sherlock's voice continued, clearer, but low and shaken. "You're bleeding..."
In the dim light of the room, John gazed at the features of his ridiculously gorgeous face, the dark and luscious curls surrounding it like the finely-crafted frame of a painting, the tender glow in his pale green eyes, the soft stretch of his generous lips, his oh-so kissable lips... Before he knew it, he was reaching for them; and before he could stop, he was pressing his mouth to Sherlock's. He lingered just enough to feel how firm and plump it was, and how warm too – just the way he had imagined it to be – and then pulled away.
The words felt like a stab in the gut. And by the way Sherlock tilted his chin up as he took them in, John knew they had the same effect on him. His chest in a vice, John licked his lips again and stepped forward, staring at the table between them.
John followed his gaze and realised that he was still holding the bags from his errands. “Oh, um… Y-yeah, if you don't mind.”
"Okay, Okay! Sorry," John backed down, taking refuge in his tea. "So... 'He made me wear the hat' and '7 times a night in Baker Street'..."
look — that intense stare from his striking mint green eyes, with that almost imperceptible wry smile — and John would melt.
Not willing to give him any respite, John shifted again and preyed on the other peak of flesh, flicking his tongue over it before taking it into his mouth altogether, sucking and tickling, watching for Sherlock's reaction.
“Good.” He turned on his side and leaned up on an elbow. “I love you for who you are, always have and always will. You know that too, right?”
With a last round of laughter, John slowly broke their embrace and let go of Sherlock's coat, his grin meeting his friend's. God, he was so beautiful when he smiled. The way his whole face lightened up and his eyes crinkled at the edges... It made him look ten years younger, if not more. Such a lovely sight. The loveliest John had ever seen, really.
John stared at him. He couldn’t be saying what he thought he was saying. It wasn't possible. It wasn't—
He paused and licked his lips, eyes fixed on the kitchen floor he'd just stepped onto. His heart was racing and he was beginning to feel sick.
For a second, Sherlock stilled in place, frozen, silent… until a choked-up groan burst out of his throat and shook his body out of stiffness, leaving it trembling like a leaf, his voice and breath turning into an equally shaky mess while his fingers clutched at anything 'John' within their reach.
“Come here, silly!” John laughed, skirting around the table to pull him into a hug. “It's my turn,” he joked, and he could hear Sherlock's lips curling up as he wrapped his arms around him.
“God, you…” John growled in between kisses, dizzy with sensations that were getting sharper by the second. He couldn't feel anything but Sherlock's lips and tongue, and his own hardening-again cock pressing against the flies of his jeans — and Sherlock's almost bare crotch.
John swallowed hard and slowly got to his feet, hands clenching as he turned towards Sherlock, busy with the tea and oblivious to his inner turmoil.
Moving to a more comfortable position, he glanced up just in time to catch Sherlock looking down at him. His breath was shallow, constricted, and his eyes sparkling with a zealous impatience that made John feel even more pleased with himself.
It was the only word he eventually managed to give form to, his tongue sticking to his palate as he did. His ears were buzzing, and his body boiling hot from exertion. He could feel waves of clammy heat oozing out of his collar and open trousers, making his head spin even more that it already did. But he didn't give a toss. He had reached a place where nothing mattered, except the divine flow of endorphins running through his system.
The impromptu gesture made Sherlock squirm and he sucked in a fluttering breath, his hands looking for the rim of the sink. “Oh you bast—” he let out in a sigh, keeping the full offense away from his posh mouth.
Glancing up, John hummed a playful “Mmm?...” and paused to run the flat of his tongue along one side of Sherlock's shaft, then over the dripping slit. That last move sent a violent jolt down Sherlock's spine who clutched John's hand before gripping the sheets into his fist instead, his legs jerking dangerously.
“We should, yeah…” John conceded, reaching inside Sherlock's underwear to set his hardening cock free instead.
John knew every part of Sherlock by heart, every gasp, every groan. He knew exactly when to stop or when to keep going, when to slow down or when to spice things up. He knew every glint in his eyes, every pleading or dazy look, every shade his gaze could take on, from sky blue to dark emerald. And yet it felt as if he was rediscovering him over and over again.
“Kind of. I suspected that it would make a strong impression on you… but I had not anticipated the full extent of it.”
Once again, Sherlock made John come back to the reality of the moment as his hand slowly moved across his shoulder blades and settled between them, his whole body shifting in front of John to invite him into his arms.
The warm welcome of Sherlock's lips made him shiver, and he had to hold himself back from sobbing against them. His hands were trembling, his breath shaky as he pulled away only to press another kiss to Sherlock's mouth, his heart bursting when he felt Sherlock kiss him back, the ghost of thin fingers on his hips.
"Don't worry," Sherlock said quickly, "I'll– I'll take care of her. Just... treat that wound, okay?... I'll be right back. Alright?..."
John didn't even take a look at it when he got home. In fact, he had ignored it completely for the past three days. He didn't want to know where she was. And he didn't want to bother to find out. She could be near, hundreds of miles away or on another continent... it didn't matter. She obviously knew what she was doing. She always did. And whatever he had to say never came under consideration. Hence her letter. That
Sherlock gave him a faint, misty smile and John couldn't help but crack an overwhelmed laugh in answer, pulling him into a hug.
This time, he didn't need to guess the expression on his face – Sherlock's arm tightening around him was enough of an answer. His chest filled with warmth, John nudged his head at Sherlock's, pulling him even closer.
Sherlock cast a sheepish glance at him, the corner of his mouth lifting very briefly in the same fashion. “I'm sorry.”
They stood gazing and grinning at each other for a few beats, then John closed the distance between them, cupping Sherlock's nape to plant a kiss on the corner of his lips. He lingered there with his eyes shut, savouring the warm and soft feeling of Sherlock's mouth that he had longed to recapture since he first got a taste of it, the renewed touch short enough to make his heart flutter, but long enough to revive the fire inside him.
"Thank you," he breathed to his ear, a thin trail of tears trickling down his cheeks as he closed his eyes. The arms around him squeezed tighter, and with a contented sigh he let it all go, abandoning himself to the peace of the moment and the warmth of Sherlock's embrace.
The sensation of Sherlock's mouth squeezing against his made him shudder anew, even more so when it opened to his and began to work up and down, following John's lead. His senses tingling, John grabbed Sherlock's lapel to pull him closer, his other hand losing its way into the smooth curls. As he did, Sherlock stepped into him and took hold of his waist, thumbs stroking his ribs through the fabric of his shirt.
everything come to this? This joke of a life? God, he hated it. He hated what he had become. A pitiful ghost of himself, of the man he used to be, the man he used to
John's mouth stretched into a smirk. "Well..." he took Sherlock's hand, "I'm glad I met you, if that's what you want to know."
Like the first time, Sherlock didn't manage to finish the sentence; but unlike the first time, John wasn't in the mood to play anymore — he wanted it over as much as Sherlock.
baby, with all the care in the world – the most beautiful sight he never thought he'd laid his eyes on.
believed that?" Sherlock exclaimed. "God, she really played everyone, did she?" He chuckled to himself, shaking his head. "She sold these stories for a fortune to pay me back for using and lying to her. None of it ever happened. It was all sensationalist fabrication, for selling purposes. They're called rags for a reason, you know."
An indulgent smile on his lips, he staggered up the last flight of stairs and stopped by the main door — the one that overlooked the living room — juggling with his bags to turn the handle and push it open.
Squeezing his eyes shut, he grasped Sherlock's nape curls and pulled him closer, swallowing the lump that had reappeared in his throat. “I promise you…” he whispered, “I will never hurt you again. Never again. And this is my own vow, to you.”
Sherlock groaned softly, his head falling back against the sofa. The silk of his dressing gown felt amazing against the hardness of his prick. The delicate fabric almost unbearably rough. He didn’t bother shifting it aside. Rather, he simply wrapped his hand around his silk covered cock. He knew it was an exercise of futility. His large belly made it impossible to get the right angle. Sherlock groaned squeezing his eyes shut as he remembered the feel of John’s dick riding the crevice of his arse. His lips and teeth at the nape of his neck. His fingers’ bruising grip on Sherlock’s hips as he rode him hard. John’s gentleness when the heat had died off.
John was several steps behind Sherlock, when he heard Donovan’s spiteful voice. “Always knew you were just another omega bitch, Freak.”
John was still mesmerized by Sherlock, even after living together for so long. His body long and lean, even while pregnant. No spare fat anywhere on his body. Even his bump seemed contained in some way. His skin glowed, like every old wives’ tale ever told. John got rid of his clothes as quick as he could, his fingers fumbling over buttons and fastenings.
And he preferred it that way. Sherlock didn’t care what the peons of the pack thought. He just wanted to run, to not be bored.
“Krampus is a story,” John started to explain. “He's the opposite of Santa Claus, he kidnaps kids who misbehave.” He was a little startled that Rosie knew who Krampus was. He didn't think teachers still talked about him. And he certainly wasn't the type of parent to try to scare his kid into good behavior. Though, if he had remembered the stories of Krampus, he might have.
Sherlock stiffened in John’s arms, as the alpha’s knot started to deflate. With a growl, he jerked away. The alpha resisted the urge to hold the omega tighter, to assert his dominance once more. With feigned nonchalance, he reclined in the drying leaves that littered the forest floor, watching the taller man. John could almost see him mentally pulling himself together. The thin layer of ice that kept Sherlock apart from the rest of the pack, and society as a whole, reforming with each passing moment.
Only to be confronted with one of the most aggressively beautiful men he had ever seen. Cheekbones sharp enough to cut, steely eyes that seemed to see and dissect everything. John froze in confusion, feeling a little like a deer caught in the glare of high beams. Then the man smiled and his face transformed into something poetically angelic.
“Do not bring mummy into this conversation,” Sherlock looked livid. John couldn’t help but think it was a good look for the man.
“Whatever we decide it will be fine,” John smiled carefully. “It doesn’t have to be figured out now.”
Sherlock's stormy eyes gleamed in excitement. “Thank you, I will. I've never actually had a meat pasty.”
John pushed himself to finish another lap in the cold, competition style swimming pool. The cold water was not ideal for his shoulder, and the old war wound that still acted up on occasion ached liked a bitch. However the days of warm pools and hot saunas were over. Those were fancy gyms in London. Not the YMCA, a good hour drive from his new/old home in bumfuck Wales. Okay to be fair, The Mumbles was not bumfuck. It was a lovely little township that was actually pretty bustling. Cosmopolitan even, in the right light. It was just that John had loved London, and in comparison every other place seemed to dim.
John practically tore down the hall, looking for his mate and daughter. He froze outside Sherlock’s room, scared to go any further. John was a father. He had a mate. Oh god, he was going to muck it all up.
After Mary had gone back to London John had become a full time GP at the small practice he had previously been a locum at at. His co-workers had been incredibly understanding that he had suddenly become a single parent to an infant. Surprisingly there had not been a lot of questions asked about the situation. Which in John's experience was bloody fucking bizarre. In a township as small as the Mumbles, he had expected a lot of well meaning nosiness. Instead he had been met with rather a lot of knowing looks exchanged between the locals. John hadn't had the time to dwell on it for long. Rosie as an infant had been golden, but like all children change did not come easy. A routine disturbed was hell on the nerves, for all the  parties involved.
Which is how John found himself unable to exit his car one rainy day in late November. He had dropped Rosie off at school, his sweet little girl chattering happily about her imaginary friend. Whatever went on in the cottage did not seem to affect Rosie. She was a cheerful little girl, who was a bit introverted.  As he waved goodbye to her at the school drop off lane, he hit play on the first episode of an impressively lengthy catalog of podcasts. He was prepared to hate it.
In some cases, like that of this pack of betas, there was no alpha to lead them. The were population had exploded in the 1980s, when they had finally come out of the woods and into the 21
John sighed softly as he watched the familiar cadence of doctors, nurses and patients rush past, it was a dance he missed. Well, if he was honest with himself, John missed the adrenaline rush that accompanied an emergency.
“Okay love, give me a minute to clean it up.” John grabbed the dust bin and broom. “Keep Dodger out of here, so he doesn't cut his paws up.”
The alpha froze, as he watched those electric grey eyes shutter, a tiny sound emerging from Sherlock’s throat. If it were any other person, John would have called it a purr. Carefully, one had to be oh so careful when it came to Sherlock, John let his fingers drift down his slender neck, until he was massaging gently at the tense muscles that resided there.
“We are having a baby, rather soon I am afraid,” Sherlock continued as though John hadn’t spoken. “I hear they acquire and require quite a bit of stuff.”
Sherlock turned abruptly, his Belstaff coat flaring around his slender legs. Efficiently and with as much snark and sarcasm as he could fit, Sherlock laid out their case. Who had done it, and how they would go about proving it.
Sherlock unfroze and sniffed delicately. “Of course not, I am just unsure if I want to share my personal space with you.”
“You are the man who tells the stories Daddy listens to after I go to bed,” Rosie informed him softly, her arms still wrapped around John's thigh. “Are you here to tell Daddy stories?”
If Sherlock had been in his wolf form, his ears would have been pinned to the sides of his head, baring his fangs in aggression.
Slightly rough, yet fully competent hands rubbed his neck and cooled his forehead. Sherlock leaned back against the firm, compact body behind him.
“Enough that I had to get rid of the flesh eating crabs,” Sherlock mumbled, feeling gross and sweaty in his clothes.
“At one of the local b&b. It has a lot of flowers in the décor.” Sherlock answered, willing to change the subject as well.
He knew the bare bones of a story, missing children. But what happened to them and why this cottage? Sherlock was going to have to talk to somebody who knew Mumbles in the 1978 and who would be willing to talk to him. Which was going to be harder than one could imagine. People did not always like to talk about dark days, especially in once rural villages that were becoming a hub of tourism.
Sherlock snorted at the pet name, as well as the conciliatory comment. He didn’t stop leaning against the alpha however. It was nice. Comforting in ways he was not used to. His family had never been supporters of signs of affection, physical or otherwise. It seemed as though John showered them over him, like a constant barrage of soft rain. It was nice, but bloody distracting.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to picture Mumbles in 1978. Smaller, much more isolated. In 1978 an hour and a half from Cardiff, it would have been the sticks. They would not have been able to blame the crimes on the encroaching city, or the growing tourism industry. Tourism had been in decline in 1978. The train to Mumbles had closed years before. If they were crimes. Thirteen children went missing over the span of fifteen months. No bodies were ever found. No real evidence of a crime ever discovered. To the cops it looked like thirteen children decided to wake up in the middle of the night, pack a rucksack and leave. Never to be seen again. Their ages were consistent, though their gender was not. Five boys and eight girls between the ages of eleven and thirteen just gone.
“Our people are on it,” Martin said, which wasn’t really an answer either. “The two of you will be safe here until we find Trevor.”
But that night in the kitchen at Baker Street, John’s blood on his hands- Sherlock wasn’t about to put John in harm’s way again.
After that, the moments that passed began to blur, each one bleeding long into the next. They slipped like cold raindrops through Sherlock’s fingers; he tried to hold onto them, commit them to memory, but everything was so surreal that he could feel himself getting lost to John’s voice, his touch. This was a dream come awake- one hundred thousand fantasies made manifest.
He realised, with a start, why he was so unerringly curious, what it meant that Sherlock had been so affected by loss in the past- it would be definitive proof for what John already wanted to believe- that Sherlock was more than capable of loving someone. It filled John with a strange and terrifying sort of hope, though he had no real reason to be hopeful. Just because Sherlock had feelings once didn't mean he would ever have them for John. And besides, John had already resolved to stay quiet on the subject, to not ask Sherlock out of respect, out of his need for Sherlock to be able to trust him.
Sherlock was visibly conflicted. He had clearly underestimated Martin’s grasp of the situation. And then Sherlock looked to him.
John had never before been so adamant when denying the rather commonplace misconception about his and Sherlock's relationship. But now, away polite society, and believing Sherlock couldn't hear him, John had held nothing back. Sherlock had hardly been able to stand it.
John was so transfixed by Sherlock’s mouth and the words coming out of it that he didn’t even notice Sherlock pulling his belt free of its loops- not until he heard it hit the floor with a clunk.
Still, it felt like something was coming. John was enough of a storyteller to know when things were about to change. He could only hope that they would change for the better.
"Over the course of our partnership, such as it is, I have often observed that your curiosity is piqued to an even higher degree when the question at hand concerns myself or my past. I haven't the faintest idea why, of course, but there it is. Last night, you were practically bursting with the need to find out the truth, but this morning you haven't said a word. Which is why I reiterate- you're
At this moment, Victor was no longer an enemy. He was just a boy now, lost, eyes searching as he muttered Sherlock’s name.
“No, not even me. Unless-” Victor jumped down from the altar, rummaging in the dark, overgrown corner until he reemerged with a duffel. “I’ve got everything we need in here. They gave this to me- a passport, new ID, cash- told me to leave the country, and that if I ever came back that they’d kill me.”
John's train of thought was suddenly derailed by the smell of food. He blinked back to reality just in time to see a steaming plate of mushroom ravioli being placed in front of him. It occurred to him that Sherlock must have ordered for the both of them while John was off in his own little morose world. Something warm flared in John's chest- the idea of Sherlock ordering for him in restaurants played into every single domestic fantasy John had ever entertained, the simple kinds of daydreams he so rarely allowed himself to have.
"That reminds me," John interjected around a mouthful of pasta. "Why are Mycroft and his boys involved in this? Shouldn't it be a matter for embassy security or the American government or something? This party isn't even technically happening on British soil- definitely not within the jurisdiction of the British Secret Service. Or MI6- well, maybe MI6."
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said, watching John shake as he pressed both hands to the wound in Victor’s chest, despite the grim prognosis he’d already given.
He had left John sleeping, breathing steady, eyes flickering beneath his eyelids. The guilt had almost kept Sherlock from going, an anchor weighing in his gut. The worst of it was that if he did make it back, John might never forgive him. What they had was so new, intense but still tenuous, and now the bond might be in danger of breaking.
Instinctively, John knew that Sherlock would not want him touching him in this moment. The omega would not stand for him scent marking him or touching their shared bump. The precious bump that was the accumulation of both of them.
John growled softly, his inner wolf angry at the denial. He knew it was true. He and Sherlock were not mated, not properly. But he wanted to be. His wolf had chosen it’s omega and John genuinely liked Sherlock. John was pretty sure he could love Sherlock.
“Yeah, not that point,” John sighed. “I live in the house of a fucking serial killer school teacher”
The wolf inside of John both approved of the dare in those electric eyes, and was pushed beyond temperance. With a soundless groan, John pushed forward, until the head of his prick had breached Sherlock. His nails dug into the soft skin of the omega’s hips, as he forced his considerable girth into that lovely, tight hole. The smell of blood tinged the air, as Sherlock howled his pleasure into the night.
Sherlock was curled up tightly on his loveseat, wrapped in his dark blue silk dressing gown as he sulked. Everything was dull. It was unbearable. Everybody who had written in to him about ghost stories were idiots. The lot of them could see, but not one of them observed. It was beyond frustrating. The idiot who lived on the moors in a tiny game keeper's lodge, with a ghostly creak that came in threes, had an obvious problem with creaky pipes and expanding floorboards. The banshee in Sussex was a bloody barn owl, not some ill omen of death. The ghost baby in Ireland had been briefly interesting, until Sherlock had deduced it was the husband trying to drive his wife insane via a clever ploy. Sherlock sat up abruptly and threw a pillow at the vertigo inducing wallpaper Mrs Hudson thought fitting for his flat.
“We can’t call the bump Demon Spawn for the rest of it’s life, perhaps we should start picking out names,” Sherlock suggested. “Or perhaps I should, since I don’t trust your judgment.”
