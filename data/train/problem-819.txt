Sherlock smiled grimly. "Mr Forsythe was in need of a consulting detective." He paused. "Unless of course he fancied a visit to Madam Tussauds and wanted to beat the inevitable queue of annoying tourists by showing up in the early morning hours."
"Nine weeks," Sherlock muttered, feeling as if no time at all had passed. These nine weeks had been an unrelenting emotional roller coaster for the both of them. At times, he had gotten so wrapped up in what was happening between them, he had almost entirely forgotten about the reason any of it was possible in the first place.
John gave a sharp nod and Sherlock sat. Redbeard immediately moved to sit beside him and put his head on his knee. Sherlock clasped his hands and propped his elbows on his thighs, staring down at his dog for a minute. John waited. Whatever explanation was going to be forthcoming, it had better be good.
Lying here next to Sherlock with his head shoved through the triangle formed by Sherlock's side, right arm and thigh, John thought there was no thanks that would ever suffice.
He smiles to himself as he packs away Sherlock's purchases. It's nice to have physical evidence that Sherlock cares about Rosie and takes his duties as godfather seriously. Then again, John supposes he shouldn't be surprised. Not after Sherlock put every professional wedding planner to shame for his and Mary's wedding.
Sherlock stared blankly at nothing and felt an age-old beast rear its ugly head in his chest. There really was no choice.
They did eventually give their statements to Lestrade the next day, taking a cab to the yard and spending about an hour talking the DI through the attack on them and the ensuing events at the hangar.
Sherlock lets go of him and half circles him to resume the killer's position. "So that means his range of movement was limited. He couldn't have pulled back his arms for maximum force for fear of elbowing whoever was there with him. So the killer must have come up to him like this-"
She raised her eyebrows. “I’m not going to let him sink into his grief the way he did when we lost you. This time, he’s going to stay right here. And this time, you’re still here, too. So you better stick to him like glue, Sherlock Holmes, because that man can’t take another loss. Do you hear?”
John quietly retreats back into the kitchen and holds his breath for what seems like a too long time until Sherlock emerges from the bathroom, having dressed Rosie in her pajamas and handing her to John so he can put her to bed.
His Psy was staring down at their clasped hands as if he had never seen them before. His expression was calm enough, however, so John decided he could handle a bit more.
Rosie, with all the spirit of an almost four-year-old child, didn't bother with any of the boring questions like "Why were you gone?" or "Why are you moving in with us now?" and instead focused on the important questions, such as what Sherlock's favourite dinosaur was and pointing out every single duck she saw.
John was holed up in a pub near his and Mary's flat – well, former flat, now – morosely staring into this half empty pint glass when his phone rang.
Sherlock, on the other hand, wore gloves because he worked in a profession that required him to not leave DNA traces, but also sometimes demanded a handshake. Gloves were a natural solution to both problems and he made a point of wearing them at all times unless it was boiling hot outside.
The hotel owner, a Mr Kingsley from London, had quickly responded to his request for a guest list the day before they had left for the hotel and a quick google search had provided some additional information about them, so he indulged in a minute or two of matching names to faces, made more difficult by the fact that there was no guarantee he was getting it right. However, he didn't call himself a genius for nothing.
He thought the skin of his right hand was going to burn right off with the need to grasp John’s hand and not let go.
"Huh?" He dragged his bag down the hall and dumped it next to John's by the door. "What have you come up with now?"
"Time for a walk," Sherlock announced, grabbing the lead from where he had set it on the coffee table the night before and approaching John.
Sherlock stumbled into the bathroom on unsteady legs, stepping out of his soiled pyjama bottoms on the way and carrying them with him in his hand. They needed a wash if he wanted to wear them again anytime soon.
There was a female scent to the flat, too, but slightly weaker than the other one and less noticeable.
"Yes, I heard you arrange that. I was standing right next to you," John pointed out. "I assume you don't want me to come with you to interrogate the chef?"
Huge paws rested on either side of Sherlock's unmoving body, forming an impenetrable protective cage around him, armed with claws that could disembowel an adult in a single swipe. John opened his mouth and bared his teeth in warning - each of his canines was about the length of a grown man's hand. It was a very impressive display.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest this assessment but couldn’t quite find anything outright false with it. “I ... broadly speaking, yes.”
"A dove changeling?" John frowned. "Why would a dove take the Underground? He could have just flown home, saved himself the fare."
Identity theft. Multiple counts of murder and murder for hire. Identity fraud. Money laundering. Illegal possession of firearms. Illegal possession of illegal firearms, where both the owning and the weapon itself are prohibited by law.
"I'm just a man playing with his dog," Sherlock said through gritted teeth, his eyes locked on John's in a silent battle of wills. Neither was going to let go. "Meanwhile your team look like a bunch of men out for a date who have been stood up and are starting to realise they were all meant to meet the same woman. Hardly inconspicuous, wouldn't you say? The only one who seems to be getting into the spirit of acting casually is Sergeant Donovan over there."
And, most of all, the sheer love in his eyes as they danced, arms wrapped around each other, their faces so close their noses were almost touching.
Lestrade looked torn between wanting to laugh and wanting therapy. "Fine. Good. Er. I'll just be going then."
"I fail to see your point," Sherlock said, eyes closed and clearly not interested in the conversation any longer.
"Oh, right, right, sorry, it's a habit." Sherlock gently shoved his head away and got up, marching to their desks and rummaging around until he unearthed a battered map of London.
"I certainly wouldn't try to play Big Brother with them," she says. "This may be news to you, but a relationship built on mutual trust and love would actually make him tell you things himself. If you're willing to do the same, which I doubt."
"On the contrary," Sherlock argued. "We have quite a lot. It is simply not yet useful. Perhaps a new angle will make itself apparent once we learn more about the victim. There may be a motive somewhere, after all. Who is questioning the family?"
"Christ, if anyone could see us now," he said lowly, trying to lighten up the slightly tense atmosphere with a joke. "We'd never hear the end of it."
It's so, so easy, as the wave finally crashes down on him and it feels as if Sherlock's touch is all that keeps him anchored.
The lift came to a stop, the doors opened and Lestrade stepped out and raised one hand to the motion sensor to keep them open while Sherlock coaxed John out into the hallway.
John laughed and patted his arm. "Yes, that's why we came here. And Lestrade, with heretofore unknown skills of premonition, knew I would be there to help him take the piss."
This argument had been going on and off for almost an hour now and the outcome remained the same: Sally was convinced he was going to die, Sherlock was convinced he would not, and Lestrade just wanted both of them to shut up, thank you very much.
"Still water would be splendid," Sherlock said, pretending not to have seen the man's wink. He squinted at the name tag pinned to his shirt. "Harold. And I do believe that lady over there would also like another drink."
The night was surprisingly warm and smelled of coconuts, thanks to the blooming gorse bushes growing on the hills all around the Inn. John breathed in deeply as he followed Sherlock along the building and around two corners until they reached the entrance to the kitchen. This was where the groceries from the village some eight miles off got delivered to twice a week and this was where the body of the concierge had been found, stabbed to death and covered in blood. Whoever had done the deed had left the door open but no footsteps behind. That was as much as Sherlock had managed to glean from the crime scene pictures, much to his annoyance. He had spent the better part of the car ride complaining about that circumstance and the general lack of professional behaviour that was to be found in rural police officers and their hangers-on.
Turning to John, he said: "If you would like a lift to Baker Street, we can have you there instantly."
She shrugged - an unusual gesture for a Psy. Sherlock had trained himself to do it on occasion but he had never seen it from another Psy. "Both, I think. I had basic conditioning when I was a child, but even then I was never as Silent as I should have been. It kept failing and they finally decided I could not be properly conditioned. They considered rehabilitation but I was too young and then they discovered the tweak to my M-ability and that was that."
"He's right," Lestrade said. "I'm not comfortable listening in on a discussion of John's well-being without his consent. We are not his pack and we work with him. He would not want us here."
"In fact, I think I'll take a picture," Sherlock told him and pulled out his phone before John could offer any sort of protest. "Lestrade will
The detective had closed his eyes in the universal "Oh god please let the ground swallow me now" gesture and was blushing even more deeply now.
They both turn to Molly, who shakes her head. "I only saw him once, when he came to let me know he was back. He ... I don't think he's doing so well."
Since he was not human, all he could do was follow his friend. He did so slowly, carefully picking his way across the asphalt and towards the waiting car. Sherlock had already reached the vehicle and was holding the door open, watching him expectantly. John ignored him and his obvious impatience, too distracted by the feel of the rough asphalt beneath his paws. Cool and rough and smelling of wet tar, it made for a startling contrast to the slippery tiled floor inside the building they had just vacated. He felt much more at ease out here, with fresh air and the sun on his body and firm ground beneath his feet.
Even his attraction to John had been a surprise and the fact that almost five years had not been enough for him to get over it spoke for itself. As he had told John today: it wasn't going to happen.
He briefly considered going back for it later to safely destroy it somehow. A small fire would do the trick.
"You know exactly what that was," Sherlock contradicted him immediately. He didn't sound too put out, though. "I'd like to know what brought this on, however."
Sherlock didn't see either hide nor hair from John in an entire week. He tried not to let it get to him. They were adults and John had a life of his own - a job, a flat, a fiancée... of course he was too busy to bother visiting Sherlock all the time. Still, Sherlock couldn't help but worry. It had felt as if they had been making progress.
Sherlock made a sound of protest as John reached for his, thus removing his arm from Sherlock's scrupulous examination. "It can wait, John."
Maybe that was why his first reaction after ending his phone call to Mycroft had been to ask in a rather odd tone of voice: "What breed is that?"
“You said there was more,” he said, turning to Lestrade. “You said you had two reasons for coming here. This was number one, what is number two?”
"It was instrumental for the case," Sherlock said. "And, as I said, it didn't have any effect whatsoever on me. I still remember everything that happened. Perhaps my history meant I was immune to the compound. Either way, I swear to you I did not in any way coerce you into getting married."
"From what I gathered, they didn't want to waste the stag night," Sally says. "I didn't even know Holmes was organising one."
Even as he said it, he realised the horrible truth in his words. Years of wishing and wanting and missing, two years of heartache that no one could possibly understand, two years of grieving for what had never been ...
He didn't get to finish because John, laughing, grabbed his head and kissed the words right out of his mouth.
The office had fallen silent, expectant eyes and ears turned to the latest instalment of the soap opera his life had become to them all. He didn't have a lot of time to decide and logic interceded before he had time to form any sort of emotional response.
Sherlock waited for him to disappear down the hallway and then ducked behind the desk as voices came from the dining hall - the other guests leaving and heading for the lounge.
John took pity on them and pretended to leap at the birds with a bark that had them scatter in a flurry of wings and loose feathers.
But Henryk, demonstrating some unforseen agility, managed to twist sideways and brought the crowbar down.
That startled another laugh out of John. Sherlock rather giddily added another tally mark to the calendar in his Mind Palace. Twice in the space of a single conversation!
But Sherlock shut his mouth with a click and shook his head, a flicker of something passing across his face. John thought it might have been pain but it was too brief to be certain. Perhaps he had a headache.
Sherlock shrugged. "Your first trip on a lift in this body was under rather traumatising circumstances. Of course your mind would go back to that experience and compare it to your current situation. You have adapted impressively well. I do hope you will give me a very detailed account of what being a dog was like once you are back in your actual body."
John extracted his free hand from under his own body to wipe at his eyes. “Don’t act like this is okay.”
"Oh, nothing important, just clearing up a small misunderstanding," Sherlock told him blithely, coming to a stop in a small niche right next to the kitchen, a darker corner where he couldn't be seen immediately by anyone looking down the hallway. "Come on."
John chuckled and Sherlock could feel the vibration of his body from his shoulders all the way down to his shins. Oh dear.
John obligingly followed Mrs Hudson as she took the long way around the lake. They arrived at the gates just in time to see the father and his sons try to leave. They were indeed being followed by half the birds in the park as well as some that definitely didn't belong to the park but had apparently decided not to turn down the chance of getting free food.
Grinning widely, he refilled his glass before following his flatmate into their living room where he sank into his armchair. All thoughts of tea were forgotten. "Care to tell me why you decided to spike our punch?"
Lips on John's neck, on his chest, moving across his abdomen. The fact that he was able, allowed, even blatantly
"I'm fine," he rasped. His head hurt and every bone in his body seemed to be made of lead, but it paled in the face of this. Of John. All of John, finally free.
"Again, we share a flat. Getting into an argument with my flatmate every time he is overcome by his nature and forgets mine in the process would hardly be beneficial."
He tossed and turned, readjusted his pillow four times, got up to open the window and then again to close it when it got too cold in his room. Nothing seemed to do the trick.
At the earliest opportunity, he followed Donovan out of Lestrade's office. She returned to her desk and sat down, so he took up position next to her. It didn't take a genius to know that the Sergeant was more than just the woman who got annoyed with Sherlock for simply existing. John suspected he might feel the same way if someone without a medical degree were to walk into the clinic where he used to work and try to tell him how to do his job.
Sherlock beamed at him. "No way to get there or away on foot unless you are equipped with hiking gear but a shuttle bus comes by once a week, so the killer is most likely still there. Isn't it fantastic?!"
The weather outside was London's desperate attempt to prove that "early summer" did not equate warmth and dryness.
"Well, I'm not going to miss having to listen to Mrs Turner's married ones getting it on," John joked. "But it wasn't all bad. I certainly miss not having to pay any bills or taxes and being able to smell people lying to me."
"Our," John corrected. "She's our daughter. Or near enough. Mycroft texted to say we've got an appointment tomorrow to sign the papers."
"Of course she'd know," John muttered. "She was one of the witnesses, apparently. And she never said a word to me about it, either. Why is it that no one in this city ever just tells me things?"
For a moment, he considered ignoring it, but then he realised it was Lestrade. There might be a case. Just the thing to distract him now.
So far he had not gotten the chance to inform John that the flash drive in question was of the water-resistant kind and the data stored on it had thus been saved from otherwise certain destruction. Which was largely thanks to his quick reaction, consisting of shedding his coat and jumping head-first into the cold water the moment the thief had thrown it in there.
Lestrade had to hand it to Mycroft Holmes - the man knew how to order people around. Within ten minutes of their discovery of John, the older Holmes brother had managed to be granted access to one of the smaller tech rooms where the Yard kept those computers capable of opening several windows at once without crashing, and had also terrified the resident IT guy into leaving them to their own devices while two of Mycroft's own employees - MI6, lord help them all - carried in several large aluminium cases and began setting up their contents.
"Silence," Sherlock said calmly but decisively, "is paramount. I may not act the way you are used to from the Psy, but I wish you to be aware that I had to adapt my ways to better suit my clients, who are mostly humans and occasionally changelings. I may mimic their behaviour, but do not for one moment believe my Silence to be anything less than perfect in every aspect."
Sherlock remained wide awake. Every breath was like a brick dropping into his stomach, a weight tugging him down.
Sherlock, now fully dressed, opened the door and brushed past him. "Oh please. As if that wasn't obvious."
It wasn't the first time Mrs Hudson had caught him in the midst of a panic attack and she had only needed to be warned once that touching him while he was in the midst of one was not a good idea. His reflexes, honed by two years on the run from various criminal organisations, were not suited for casual touch while his mind was shutting down. He still felt guilty every time he thought about how bruised her wrist had looked from where he had grabbed hold of her arm.
"Well, I hardly see why I should blame you for whatever you find," she said firmly. "I do not believe in shooting the messenger, as the saying goes. To be quite honest with you, I do not believe that anything you find out could be worse than what I am already going through." She drew back her shoulders. "Ask what questions you like, and I shall do my best to try and answer them."
"Mmmh, every year or so my transport decides it's been neglected long enough. It happened shortly before we got the Baskerville case. The case and your transformation distracted me for a while but once we settled into some sort of a routine there was no putting it off any longer."
The nurse nodded, prattling on happily as she changed Sherlock's saline bag. "Oh yes, he had to go to work, I think. You must have just missed him. Anyway, I've got things to do, so if you would please excuse us.... you can come back later."
Greg got himself a pint and Sherlock a cider because he may not be a genius but he did pay attention to people. He sat down and shoved the menu in Sherlock's face. "Here, choose something. You're only allowed a starter or dessert if you also get a main."
Sherlock blinked at him, surprised. "So you'd actually want to stay here the full week even if I solved the case tonight?"
Precisely twelve minutes later, John returned from one of his army-efficient showers, looking marginally more awake and giving Sherlock a pleased smile when he discovered a freshly brewed cup of tea waiting for him at a safe distance from Sherlock's lab equipment.
John shooed Sherlock out of the flat and to Barts right after breakfast. “I can feel your restless energy from across the room. Go annoy Molly for a bit, conduct some fun experiments, don’t bring back too many body parts and have a good time. I’ll see you tonight.”
To his surprise, it was Mycroft who stepped in and dealt with most of the paperwork on his behalf. Since Sherlock had no plans to sell the cottage but didn't want it to stay uninhabited for too long, he decided to go back to renting it out in the summer months just as he had done before moving there permanently.
John, still growling, scrambled off the ground, shook most of the water off his fur and moved to stand between Sherlock and the two men on the ground, ducking low with his legs apart to give him a firmer stance. All he knew was the fierce fury at seeing someone try and attack his Sherlock, trying to harm his pack, trying to hurt what was his. He wondered which of the two to bite first if they were stupid enough to get up and try again.
Sherlock snorted. “John, we’re talking about a professional assassin. If you were disappointed about it, I would consider it a cause for concern.”
"Thanks. Case?" John asked, nodding towards the file Sherlock had been pouring over and which had now been pushed almost off the table.
She had only stayed long enough to get confirmation that John had no intention of leaving them again and had made herself scarce since then, most likely to give them time to settle into their new reality while she sat next door with Mrs Turner, giggling and gossiping over tea and biscuits. Sherlock found he didn't mind.
"If you say so. I'll see what I can do. But give me a heads up, Sherlock. I can't just drop everything and ferry you around whenever it strikes your fancy. I do have other work to do as well."
"I asked you why," Sherlock remembered. "And you gave me a list of perfect reasons. That we needed to have access to each other if one of us got hospitalised, that we should have some sort of legal protection against being used as witnesses against one another - you reminded me of the cabbie you shot as a prime example - and that since we were sharing our lives and finances and everything else already, it only made sense."
She made them both tea in the morgue's small staff kitchen and within minutes he found himself sitting opposite her, telling her everything they had learnt about Mary in the intervening time.
Sherlock took a sip of his tea but kept John in his sight over the rim of his cup. "That wasn't a mistake," he said calmly. "That was a calculated, deliberate decision. It doesn't make the results any better but believe me when I say I took no joy in it. Just in case you were wondering."
That didn't make sense - Sherlock must know! He was the only one out of the two of them who had any memory of their wedding day, after all. There was no way he couldn't know why John had apparently decided to marry him. Had they played a game? Made a stupid joke that had turned serious? There were endless possibilities. Surely they hadn't just gone and done it without at least some sort of reason?
"Ouch. Bugger," he curses, trying to sit up without doing himself further injury. "Alright there, Sherlock?"
Sherlock nodded at her and watched her walk away, wondering if she knew how valuable this favour might turn out to be. Favours were the one type of payment he had learned never to refuse.
Sherlock moaned and threw his head back, giving up on his trousers for the time being. He honestly couldn't remember how buttons worked.
"Yes of course. Which is why I plan to confront her with my theory to see how she will react. I walked past her desk on my way out - like many office workers, she keeps running shoes under her desk so she can wear them on her way home and her possessions were in one of those neat backpacks joggers use. My guess is she'll be running home from work, so all we have to do is find her address and wait for her there. Depending on her reaction, we can decide what to do next."
It should have made him angry, should have infuriated him. But instead it just made him smile a little. It was good to know that while Sherlock could acknowledge when he had done something a bit not good, he was honest enough to admit he would do it again if he thought it was the best option available. You could trust in that.
"Right, hadn't thought of that," John said and shook his head. "Sorry, I'm not at my best right now."
"Just making sure. She said there wasn't much to do in her department as the police had taken all the files, which only proves my theory. Ms Conall had a lovely new pair of diamond studs. Bit inappropriate to wear to work with everyone in mourning for the CEO and his son, isn't it? Then there is of course the fact that she tried to enter Forsythe senior's office while I was in there this morning even though she must have known it would be locked. The first time I paid the company a visit, she was standing at the reception, talking on the phone with her mother. She was speaking French and saying that she had been overlooked for promotion several times already and thought that it was highly likely she would finally get one soon. With the two company heads dead, there's certainly a staff shake-up coming. I'm afraid she'll not get to enjoy it very much from prison."
John seemed to take his silence for a request to continue. "In the end, I chickened out. I thought about what I had written and became afraid you would read it right there in front of me and I would have to watch your face while you read it, while you finally learnt ... and I couldn't stand it. It was too much, on that day of all days. So I asked Molly to give you the letter and she, of course, took the one that had your name on it, like any sane person would have done. She put each in an envelope and gave you that one." He nodded down at the letter on the counter. "This one ... well, it was in its envelope, so I never realised it wasn't the right one. I considered burning it or throwing it into Mary's grave after her, but I wanted to keep it nearby. Like keeping a tooth of the shark that tried to eat you, I guess. I put it in a folder full of paperwork and forgot all about it until two weeks ago, when I realised you had never gotten the right letter. So I found it for you."
Mary didn't look very mollified but clearly couldn't find a reason to keep being angry with him for not contacting her. "Did you at least catch your criminal of the day?"
"I asked her to take Johnny to the park," Sherlock said calmly. "Can't have a dog in a hospital, Lestrade.  Apparently it's against the rules."
It was difficult to talk about this. Just mentioning the way Silence worked was already causing him a headache. But it was manageable for now. He had had worse. And he could not stop - not if he hoped to find a way out of the trap he had inadvertently set for himself and John.
It was an insult no matter how he looked at it - to his own judgment and to John himself, because why on earth would he be interested in anyone when John was
But he had no drugs now and the sentiment was back. This time, he had no desire to push it back down. This time, he would hold on to it, and hang Mycroft and the Council if they didn't like it.
Hours pass and when Sally walks toward the Yard's kitchenette on stiff legs, her eyes bleary from staring at the screen all day, she is surprised to see that it's dark outside.
John shakes his head in disbelief. "All this time. She was right in front of us all this time." He turns to Sherlock. "How did you not know? I'm not surprised I missed this, but you...?"
John groaned in frustration. He shouldn't even be thinking about this at all, damn it. His wedding was in a little over a day and it would be a moot point by then. No. It
"Oh!" Mrs Hudson gasped at the mess. And then again: "Oh!" when she saw John clear the floor, picking out the shortbread with gusto. Sherlock, for his part, sounded suspiciously like someone muffling laughter in his sleeve.
The soft clatter of porcelain on wood drew him from his thoughts as Mrs Hudson placed a steaming cup of tea in front of him. "There you go, my dear. Two sugars, just as you like it."
While they were talking, Sherlock had already slipped on a pair of gloves and was carefully examining the body.
It was quite inconvenient, this. In the beginning of his experiment, he had been curious, had wanted to learn what made humans and changelings so eager to engage in physical contact. He had wanted to learn, to get used to touch so he himself might never be taken by surprise by it.
Grief and guilt warred for supremacy. He should have been there today, should have stood by John's side and watched him marry the love of his life. He should have smiled as his heart shattered in his chest. He should have celebrated and played the song he had written for their first dance.
Thank you once again for being such a wonderful audience, your comments prove over and over again that the Sherlock fandom is very much alive and the most awesome place any author could hope to find themselves in.
"So her abductors knew to take her favourite toy along," Sherlock said. "But they didn't know what it was, so they came up with this scheme to take all her things. I would imagine the bag doesn't contain anything else of interest that can't be bought easily but children are particular about their toys. Now why take along the toy if you want to abduct a child? Clearly they have plans to keep her."
"And if he wasn't, there's a whole new avenue of enquiry open to us," Sherlock pointed out. "He might have discovered it was an illegitimate child and confronted the real father. That would give both biological parents a motive for murder."
Instead, he merely indicated one of the piles closest to her. “You can start with these. We’re looking for anything that includes threats against me or John or where someone might have cause to hold a grudge against us that is strong enough to kill an innocent woman.”
None of it mattered, entirely overpowered by John, here, with him, as close as he could possibly get without losing all decency.
John ached at the implication. "I wish I remembered it," he said softly. "Will you finally tell me? You said it was my idea but I never fully understood how it happened or why. I suppose I didn't ask."
John winced. He hadn't thought Sherlock would notice his changed behaviour. Stupid. Sherlock noticed everything. John had hoped he wouldn't understand what he was seeing, though. Clearly he was shit out of luck.
John nodded at him and Sherlock waited until the water had a temperature he considered suitable. He carefully aimed it at John's front paws. "How is this?"
He sighed. "I'm going to get in touch with my homeless network, see if anyone remembers seeing a woman and child matching Rosie's description. Mycroft, can you send the best picture from that video you have to my phone? I'll need printed copies as well."
Sherlock thought he had rarely been that scared in his life. “John ... that doesn’t sound very healthy. I realise I’m not an expert on anyone’s mental health, least of all my own, but you sound like you’ve had a complete mental break.”
The word roared through John's head, echoed through his heart and soul until his movements turned frantic and his skin ached wherever it didn't touch Sherlock's.
What he could do, however, was watch Sherlock and make sure he actually ate and took care of himself.
More bullshit, of course. His shields had always been good but that was it - good. They had never been anything exceptional until John had appeared in his life and Sherlock had found himself suddenly paranoid, terrified of what would happen to both him and John if anyone were to discover how quickly he had become attached.
Sarah understands but he still needs to put in the hours and this is the deal they have arrived at: John can run off for cases if he makes up for the lost time afterward. He sometimes thinks the fact that she took him on again at all is a miracle and at least they're long past the awkwardness of having once dated. It seems like a lifetime ago. And besides, she has a husband and a little daughter now.
Every now and then, Sherlock would absent-mindedly brush his fingers through John's fur and send a pleasurable shiver down his spine.
"That still does not explain why I am here," she says. "Sherlock is back where he belongs and doing well."
But oh, the temptation was strong. He kept his hands firmly on John’s shoulders, forced his mind to focus on nothing but the task at hand and still felt his thoughts attempting to drift. Next time, he would insist on doing John’s shoulder first, before John laid his hands on him, or all that beautiful relaxation would be replaced with new tension in a matter of minutes.
He walked in and found Sherlock curled up in his armchair, arms wrapped around his drawn-up legs and an expression of abject misery on his face. "Sherlock?"
He sighed softly to himself, drowned his glass of water and shoved all ridiculous thoughts away. They were friends. That was all there was to it, all it was ever going to be. This was just pre-wedding jitters. The sooner he got over it, the better.
But he had never had occasion to work around love. So Sherlock hit him with all of it, a messy flood of love and adoration and loyalty. He had never tried to destroy someone else's shields before but that was yet another thing Moriarty had never expected someone else to do to him. He certainly hadn't ever dreamt of having someone attack his mind with love.
"Circumstances are not always in our favour," Mycroft Holmes says, twirling his umbrella. It's not really an answer. It isn't anything.
"Lestrade pointed out to me that I may have been wrong in keeping my distance from you at home," Sherlock told him in that calm, matter-of-fact tone he used when he was trying to pretend he didn't really care. "I thought you would want me to continue treating you the way I always have, but Lestrade believes it would upset the balance of our ... our friendship, since you've been robbed of most of your agency by your transformation."
John swore he could see Sherlock's pupils widen, but that might also be a sign of surprise. A moment later, his expression shut down, though not quite fast enough to conceal the wild curiosity in his gaze.
Sherlock wasn't surprised to find himself standing above another dead changeling and he knew that neither was John.
The files give her nothing she doesn't already know. A devastated boyfriend with a rock-solid alibi, grieving family and friends, shocked colleagues, scared neighbours. A picture of a woman who worked as a nurse in the maternity ward and who volunteered at the Battersea Dog and Cat Shelter in her limited spare time. She wasn't even in debt, for god's sake.
They did eventually manage to migrate to the sofa, sated in every way and ready to relax for a while.
However, apart from the few precious split-second glimpses when he burst into John's room in the middle of the night to drag him off to a crime scene or on those rare out-of-town cases where they ended up sharing a room, Sherlock had rarely seen him actually sleep in a bed. Now, there was little reason to expect John to bolt upright and - against his better judgment - Sherlock allowed himself to indulge a little.
"I see. That kind of joke, eh? You've always been like that, the two of you. Entire conversations that leave the rest of us wondering what the hell you two madmen are talking about."
John rose up on his knees, leaning forward, one of his hands rising to touch Sherlock's cheek. "Not quite."
John huffed at him - experiments, experiments! Wasn't there anything else his madman of a flatmate could think about? Like maybe returning him back to his human form as quickly as possible? This was insane and uncomfortable and he was ready to be done with the entire thing, now that the initial shock had worn off. At least he no longer felt on the edge of a panic attack.
And of course John wasn't that drunk. He'd been in the army, after all. He could hold his liquor. The point was, he didn't have to as long as Sherlock was there to keep an eye on everything while John kept both eyes on him.
That made John snort. "He's a police officer. Of course he knows how to listen. Providing a sympathetic ear while people tell you why exactly they were perfectly justified in murdering their neighbour is a main part of the job description."
"And yet she ends up being the collateral." Sally takes a sip of her tea. "I was the one who had to come here and tell her you had killed yourself. And if you think that losing you didn't absolutely break her heart, you are an even greater moron than I thought."
He reluctantly removed one of his hands from John's backside in favour of tracing each of his ribs, sparing a half-thought to being grateful that neither of them had bothered with putting on a t-shirt again last night.
But Sherlock wasn't paying attention, clearly mulling something over. Finally, he said: "Mrs Hudson."
Sherlock nodded, a small lump in his throat. He swallowed, trying to clear it. "I'm glad to be back here with you, too, John."
Of course changelings and humans also placed importance on education, but they tempered it with a healthy dose of play. As cubs, he and his sister had spent at least half their time playing with the other cubs in their pack, frequently switching back and forth between their human and changeling form.
It was never her intention to accidentally out Holmes like that - certainly not to John, of all people! Granted, there isn't anyone else left in all of London who could possibly still be in the dark about Sherlock Holmes.
“Oh, John, I’m so sorry, dear!” She dabbed at her eyes with one of her flowery handkerchiefs. “I don’t know what to say, it’s all so dreadful. How are you holding up?”
"Yes, of course," John replied, sounding surprised. "I was just going to eat something first. It takes a while to get home on the tube and we haven't eaten since breakfast."
As soon as his arms were free, Sherlock's hands reached for John's waist, the world toppled and a moment later he found himself lying on the bed, a drunk consulting detective hovering above him.
He did not know what to make of it, did not know what to think about many of its implications, foreign as they were to him. But the accuracy of its definition could not be denied. He wished for John's hand on his skin, wished for the easy companionship they had shared before he had decided to cut his experiment short. He wished, more than anything, to be able to reach out and touch John whenever he liked. Which, if he was being entirely honest with himself, appeared to be all the time.
“He’s about your size,” he noted, stepped behind Sherlock and, holding it by both ends, wrapped the towel around his neck from behind, pulling back just enough for Sherlock to bend backwards to keep air flowing into his lungs.
John did as he was instructed and Sherlock carefully continued his work. Still, John jerked at the first touch of the brush against his stomach.
Two days later, John accompanied Sherlock on a case for a private client. Those were usually less fun than the ones for the Yard but they tended to pay well. As Sherlock always insisted on splitting their earnings from these clients, John tagged along, figuring he could use the extra money for his wedding and honeymoon. Surely Mary would be pleased if they could splurge a little on their getaway, the destination of which they still hadn't decided on.
Molly rolls her eyes. "No," she says. "But Sherlock would never ... he'd sneer at the mistle toe, pretend he doesn't know the tradition and act extra viciously to convince himself he isn't hurt when John ultimately and unknowingly rejects him with a lame joke about it."
He looked up at Sherlock's face and accidentally met his gaze, which had been fixed on him, and the jolt that ran through him was as shockingly strong as it had always been, every damn time their eyes met in the hallway as they gasped for breath after a chase through London's streets. Moments like this were the reason he sometimes wondered.
"No rush," Sherlock muttered. "He won't be expecting us for at least another hour, seeing as this is when we are usually out for a walk."
His cat prowled beneath his skin, wanting to curl up in a warm corner. He suppressed the urge without much difficulty. This was hardly the place and while changelings were no uncommon sight in London, the appearance of one of them in their animal form in a local supermarket would only spell trouble. Particularly if that animal form was John's, which was a rare sight no matter where he went.
He could admit that most of that was probably due to the fact that John was, quite literally, in no shape to yell at him over things that were decidedly Not Good, but he had other ways of expressing himself now. He certainly knew how to growl or otherwise express his opinion.
"I can't tell you the precise date," Sherlock said. "But it was the day he received a bullet in the shoulder in Afghanistan. To my knowledge and by his own admission, he has not shifted since. When he first moved in, he told me his ... other form would not be a problem. Clearly he was wrong."
"Luckily you are extremely skilled at disarming people," Sherlock commented as they walked down the hallway to their room. "He could have done a lot of damage with that crowbar."
"I will be taking my leave now," Mycroft continued. "If you require anything, you can contact me via Sherlock's datapad. I believe he has saved me in his contacts under
But Sherlock shook his head and remained silent, staring at the table with the look of someone who was struggling to put words to something he had no experience with whatsoever. Lestrade chose to leave him be.
They have been in this car for less than ten minutes. Sally wonders if time works differently for him, if that is a long time in his world. She also wonders how he knows about her shopping habits.
He stayed close to Sherlock as they walked so the wings of the Belstaff brushed against his side with every step Sherlock took.
He ran outside just in time to see Sherlock's dark curls disappear behind the next hilltop. John promptly followed suit, hurrying up the hill until he came to a slightly breathless halt on top.
"I already told you where I stand," Sherlock reminded him. "I have no incentive whatsoever to sign these papers and plenty of reasons not to. Until and unless this changes, we are at an impassè."
Sherlock’s chair scraped back and a moment later he had rounded the table and was standing next to John, carefully putting one hand on his shoulder. John took a deep, shuddering breath, twisted in his chair and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s middle, burying his face in his best friend’s stomach. Sherlock’s hand slid off his shoulder and around his back and a moment later Sherlock had both arms wrapped around him in return, holding him close.
As tradition would have it, Donovan's Wing was stationed at the Tower of London, where they had apartments in areas inaccessible to tourists and where they could come and go as they pleased, for no one would dare to try and clip their wings. And still there were always ravens at the Tower.
"Apparently reversing a known process is much easier than inventing an entirely new one," he said. "They tested it on some isolated cells with very good outcomes, or so I'm told. I'll meet you there and if anyone has been lying about their progress, we will know."
For the longest moment, John had no idea what to do. Ignore it? Not possible. Sherlock was too tightly wound for this to end in anything but disaster if John tried to pretend it wasn’t happening. And if Sherlock were to wake up now ...
His mind stood still, settled down, and for that one moment Sherlock was completely and utterly one-hundred percent present in the here and now. No worries about his experiment, no impatience for Molly to bring him his coffee, no curiousity about what the sample beneath the microscope's glaring light might tell him about a vicious murder. Not a single stray thought about anything beyond the stranger and the precise distance between them.
"Reveal the killer, of course," John said, his thoughts firmly on the case for once while Sherlock's ...weren't. "Or were you planning on letting them get away with it?"
Finally, they made it to the top and John decided not to stop for shoes and coats and stuff until they had reached their destination, which just so happened to be Sherlock's bedroom. Once he got him in there, he could help him out of his coat and shoes and then just let him sleep it off. That, at least, was the plan. Clear and simple. Straightforward. Just like John himself, basically.
"You don't have to use dog commands," Sherlock snapped for the up-tenth time. "Just ask him nicely, for heaven's sake."
"Consider it the correction of a terrible mistake," Mycroft said. "And of course you will be thoroughly compensated for your trouble."
John didn't let the disappointment get to him. Clearly his Psy was not remotely ready to embark on a course in advanced innuendo. In fact, he might have to re-take the beginners lesson.
It's bad enough that he can barely tear his eyes away, he wouldn't want any of their sometimes-colleagues looking, too. If asked, he wouldn't be able to explain the difference.
"Ha. Why is it that everyone else goes picking apples while I end up looking for peculiar potatoes?"
"How did you get these developed?" John laughed, looking at the pictures of himself covered in foam or with his fur just dried and poofy, just like the ginger cloud of candy floss Sherlock had said he resembled at the time.
"Do you know, I think I might actually go to bed," he said when he had finished his dinner. "This normal sleep cycle is really messing me up, John. I blame you for all of it, I hope you are aware of that."
Of course, such a thing would never be an issue for him. His telekinesis was his first and strongest line of defence. Still, no need to remind John of that. He seemed perfectly happy to ignore Sherlock's abilities unless no alternative presented itself.
John, wreaking havoc on Sherlock's emotions, tearing him to pieces and putting him back together in the space of several hours. He wasn't sure which parts of the entire day had been real and which had been a particularly wild hallucination.
"You need to understand that it was never really there to begin with," Sherlock said. "The dissonance, yes. The pain triggers are still there. I just ... disabled them, so to speak. It won't last long and it's just a preliminary solution until I find something that will work permanently. I need them to be there, to act as a safeguard so my TK doesn't become volatile and endanger everyone and everything around me."
"It's just you," he says softly. "All this time, Sherlock, it's been just you. And I didn't realise for so long but it seems obvious now. You said I had to stop and I've tried. It's the only reason I even said yes when Beatrice asked me out today."
John hopped off the sofa and trotted towards him, tail wagging. It may not have been an explicit invitation, but with Sherlock you had to learn to read between the lines.
She is frankly amazed that it has taken him so long to ask. One thing she learned very quickly during her work is that members of the Force like to be in each others business. They're nosy busybodies by profession and it can get difficult to draw the line.
From this angle, it was impossible to kiss, so John pressed his lips to Sherlock's chest and throat, teeth scraping over his nipples and then his Adam's apple. He shifted a little on his next thrust and Sherlock cried out, so loud John heard him above another clash of thunder.
"They're renewing their vows to reaffirm their commitment," John tried to explain. "To show each other that after all this time together, they still wouldn't want anyone else."
Patrick looked from one of them to the other, clearly unsure how to act. "Uh ... I guess I'll just ... um, leave you to it," he stammered. "Good night."
John blinked. If he was acting, why would he bother hiding the way he looked at John? That didn't make any sense.
John couldn't blame him for that. After everything that had happened, he would have been more surprised if Sherlock had simply accepted his words and moved on.
He should have done more, been firmer, unyielding in the face of Sherlock's temporary loss of his mental faculties. He should have dragged him to his bed and left him there, just as he had done when Sherlock had been drugged by Irene Adler.
"Afghanistan or Iraq, which one was it?" the male asked. If he was annoyed at having to repeat himself, there was no hint of it in his voice. Flat, emotionless. Silent.
John laughed and turned to look at him. The laugh died in his throat and Sherlock watched with no little gratification as John's gaze wandered across his naked chest.
It suddenly occurs to her that the reason Mrs Hudson was never able to find renters had nothing to do with mould.
He turned back immediately. He had no intention of announcing his presence but if this stranger was out to hurt Sherlock, he would not be expecting him to have back-up waiting in the shadows.
"Thanks for the warning," he murmured to Greg again and walked over to the body, making sure to approach Sherlock from the side, which earned him a nod from Donovan and slight softening of her scowl.
Sherlock frowned but followed him over to the comfortable armchairs and sat down, his face carefully expressionless as he looked anywhere but at John.
Of course Sherlock was aware that none of them knew they were looking at John - none of them saw anything but a medium-sized, adorable dog. The urge to pet him would be immediate and Sherlock himself had already found himself struggling not to bury his fingers in soft warm fur, snatching his hand away almost every time he caught himself reaching out. Though more tactile than him when it came to people, John did not seem to like being touched all that much as far as Sherlock could tell, preferring to nod at people instead of shaking their hands. He wondered if that was another remnant of life in the army, where you learned that shaking hands might be a greeting but might also be used to draw you closer and stab you with the knife hidden in your opponent's other hand.
“A miracle of nature,” Sherlock gasped past his arm which he had instinctively raised to his face as the miserable rotten scent assaulted his nose.
Sherlock pretended to be busy rereading his case notes in his little notebook while he waited for John to finish his breakfast. He was glad that John knew he sometimes only held the notes in his hands for something to look at while sorting through the data in his mind palace, otherwise John surely would have inquired why he never turned the page. In reality, he was too busy trying to sort out his mixed feelings about John's reaction to being presented with breakfast in bed.
Sherlock didn't protest as John half led and half dragged him out of the pub and to the curb. "Can you try and stay upright long enough for me to hail a cab?," he asked. Perhaps that hope was a bit optimistic of him - no cabbie liked having a drunk passenger - but there was no way they were going to make it back to Baker Street on foot.
It didn't matter that he had been unconscious at the time. Somehow, John had managed to lift him up and carry him all the way here from the kitchen. His John, so much stronger than his baggy jumpers and self-deprecating smile would make you think. So much more lethal. Sherlock didn't need to see his other form to know that, didn't even need to know what it was. He wanted to, oh yes, but it didn't make a difference in the big picture.
It had been, Sherlock felt, a rather important reminder that John, though he looked like he couldn't harm a fly, was the most dangerous man in the general vicinity. And he had chosen to use that to protect him.
His hair was damp and he smelled of shampoo and shower gel that couldn't quite hide the still pretty high hormone levels, but there was no denying that he looked much more relaxed and a lot of the tension seemed to have dissipated. He seemed to be in a foul mood, however, most likely due to his annoyance at having been forced to give in to his transport's demands rather than ignoring them until they went away.
"Are you finished now? Will you finally stop this useless fight and let me in? You've been so good at this, you've kept me out for longer than anyone else I ever met. Why is that, do you think? I've never had anyone fight back like this, either. No one ever tried to attack my mind the way you did. And you did such a good job of it, too - it took me half an hour to recover and you did it a second time. Oh, Sherlock, I am going to pick your brain apart until I know exactly how you did that. Won't that be wonderful? Luckily, we don't have any pressing engagements."
"I'm fine. I had to take Sherlock to the hospital. When I arrived he was unconscious with a 40 degree fever. He's stable now but ... well, I wanted to keep an eye on him."
The ride to the Yard passed in companionable silence. John saw Sherlock's lips twitch every now and then and wondered if he was also looking forward to seeing Lestrade's reaction. He felt his own lips curl upwards in response.
The thought had barely crossed his mind when he stepped forward, and then forward again, so deep inside Sherlock's personal space his friend had no choice but to back away to avoid being run over. Sherlock's back hit the wall just as John raised his left hand off his shoulder to gather a good handful of Sherlock's hair in his grip and tugged his head down.
She finally left and Sherlock watched out of the corner of his eye as John gradually relaxed as he re-immersed himself in their mutual task.
"What?," John stared at him, trying to look casual. "How would I know what you've done, Sherlock? I've been gone for an hour."
"The joggers who stopped to talk to you?" John asked. "You spoke to them for a couple of minutes. They thought I was adorable."
“So I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised I dreamt that, too,” John murmured. “But then she just ... fell back and was dead all over again but then it was ... it was you in that coffin and I couldn’t ... I couldn’t
Sally tiptoes past them and makes it all the way to the door leading down to 221c before Mrs Hudson emerges from her own flat, a bag of trash in her hand.
One step backward, then another. He turned and stalked towards the stairs, up to their room.There was no point in lingering any longer, no point in saying anything.
Mrs Holmes nods. "He can be a handful when he's in his element. I certainly never knew when to shut up and step back while other people were talking about maths who didn't know half as much about it as I did. Not that I'm saying you're bad at your job," she hastens to add and Sally instantly knows where Sherlock has got it from. That brash honesty that can all too easily become an insult. This, then, is what it looks like tempered by decades of experience in trying to sound less offensive. She wonders how much of it is due to Mrs Holmes being a woman and having to censor herself much more than society would expect of a man.
Sherlock gave a long-suffering sigh and relented. “It’s at Holborn, just around the corner from the British Museum. It’s called the John Soane Museum. The name may ring a bell - he was the architect who designed the Bank of England as it stands today.”
A gentle shove was all it took to make him sit down heavily and he propped his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands, listening to the soothing sounds of Mrs Hudson making a decent cuppa while he waited for his body to stop trembling.
It was clear from Sherlock's reaction that he was beyond words, that he couldn't bring himself to speak even if he knew what to say. He simply held on and it took a full five minutes before John realised that Sherlock was crying. His heart broke all over again.
"You're the one who brought me home," John said. "Who took me in and kept me sane and looked after me and comforted me and did everything you could to help me through this. You were ... everything I needed. And you always will be."
"Fine." There was only so much arguing over food that Sherlock could take. And so far it wasn't a very taxing case, so he wouldn't be drawing off indispensable energy used for brainwork.
"Lube?" John finally asked, once he managed to gather enough brain cells to form a word. "C-condoms?"
John found he really didn't like public pools. Seeing as his recent experience with them was limited to being covered in Semtex, having snipers aiming at him and Sherlock, and fearing for both of their lives, he decided that no one could really blame him for being reluctant when it came to entering such buildings after hours.
The only thing he could do was act like a dog and ask Sherlock to play with him and pet him and show him affection in return. And Sherlock had so far drawn a line between their interactions in public and their interactions in private. It was a bit blurry at times, such as the cab ride with Sherlock's hand on the back of his neck, but at home the rules were quite clear. There were no unnecessary touches. Sherlock treated John like ... well, like he was John. Which was good, John thought. He wanted to be treated like himself. But he also wanted to act like himself and Sherlock made that impossible by refusing any superfluous contact.
liked dogs. And he really liked petting them. And now here he was, sharing a flat with a dog with fluffy red-and-white fur, his fingers itching to touch.
"The eggs." His friend nodded at the buffet. "They're not poisoned. There's no need to look at them like that. Either take some or don't."
A massive THANK YOU to all of you for giving this story a chance. When I first came up with this idea almost three years ago, I had no clue it would turn into the story you have just read. I know the premise is crazy and the summary frankly insane, but I want to thank all of you for giving this funny little thing a try and loving it as much as you did. Seeing your kudos and comments never failed to make me grin like an idiot and I will recognise your user names for years to come.
"I would have suspected him coming from the other direction, actually," Sally says, but it lacks the bite the statement would have had two years ago. "Are you sure about the parents, though? I didn't see any posh cars outside."
Her eyesight was much better than average to make up for the difference, though. Ravens didn't require a good sense of smell. They had other ways of finding prey.
Sherlock leans forward in his chair, his forearms resting on his thighs, his body tense. "How long do you need me to wait?"
"Yeah, I can see that. If I didn't know better, I'd completely buy your story. It suits him, too, don't you think? Of all the possible breeds to end up as, I mean. But that wasn't what I meant."
"You're right," John murmured, slinging his arms around Sherlock and pressing his face to his chest. "I wish you weren't but you're right. I told myself,
“But nothing,” John told him firmly. “You never wanted to go. All you wanted to do was protect me, us, from Moriarty. All
Lestrade shook his head. "Bloody hell, he really never spoke to you about it? Well, I guess he didn't want to get into something so heavy while you were just rebuilding your friendship. John, the poor sod is head over heels in love. Has been for quite some time, if you ask me. And he isn't handling this well at all."
"You've met one of them before," Sherlock told him calmly. "And if I remember correctly, you were so impressed you tried to flirt with her, despite the fact that she was Psy."
"He's been quiet," she says, hands clasped around a cup of tea, sitting comfortably in Mrs Hudson's kitchen. A familiar environment, warm and welcoming. Rain hammers against the window, making the room even cosier.
John shook his head. "Triggered myself, I think. I just ... I was thinking of how I lost you. How I had chosen to lose you all over again. I can't ... I can't do it."
Of course it was the right decision. On a purely logical level, it was sensible. The only correct decision. Nothing should ever have happened between them in the first place. He had been taking liberties, using Sherlock's curiosity and desire to experiment to satisfy his own need for touch. It was only right that Sherlock step back, revoke all skin privileges and return to the status quo they had established in the first few months after John had moved in.
"Well, he's still alive," Donovan offered. "Didn't look too bad, right? Not even in intensive care and all. Looks like he's even got someone to look after him."
It was a short, brisk walk back to their hotel. Now that they were moving again, John found time to really appreciate just how cold he had been as the blood rushed back into his feet and his toes smarted as he walked. From the look on Sherlock's face, he was experiencing something similar.
"I can't really imagine you as a police inspector," Patrick told him thoughtfully. "A lawyer, on the other hand ..."
"I'll say," John muttered, still trying to imagine any scenario that would lead to him stealing a living tiger.
They had searched insects for equally amusing names and found several, but nothing could compete with the supreme hilarity of Sherlock Holmes showing him a rock called 'Cummingtonite'. It wasn't Sherlock's usual sort of humour at all, which made it all the funnier in John's eyes.
"He kept the flat very clean and did his best to hide all evidence of the child's existence, which, along with the fact that his mother did not mention any babies, leads me to believe he did not want anyone to know about it."
John turned down the hallway. The bathroom door was open and the light turned off. The door to Sherlock's room didn't seem to be closed properly, either. John lurched forward, caught between the need to see Sherlock right this second and the fear of what he might find if he opened the door.
He didn't even make a noise, this time. He was reasonably sure there were no tears, either. He was all dried out, nothing left to give. There was only the distant knowledge of the hard floor beneath his knees, the unmistakable scent of John that clung to the chair, and the rough feeling of the worn material of the upholstery against his face.
Of course the fact that John couldn't even remember their wedding was a bit of a let-down, had been from the start, but Sherlock had never thought to mention it further. They were married and lived together and that was enough. Only after his supposed death had it occurred to him that he needed it to be more than that and he had spent two years living for the moment when he could come home to his husband and ask him to be just that - his husband. Instead, he had returned to find John about to propose to a random, boring woman.
"I'm pathing him right now," his mate said, her night-sky eyes turning completely black for a moment as she telepathically relayed a message to someone else. Another Psy, then, and someone she knew well if they had an open channel of communication between them. Sherlock wondered if he was part of the group of defectors she had mentioned. It seemed likely.
Sherlock made a face. "Did you have to mention my brother? It's Christmas, I deserve a day on which I'm not reminded of his tedious existence."
Sherlock shook his head. "No one ever wants me," he said calmly. "Psy do not operate based on baser instincts. Until you walked into my life, there was no one who would have ever even considered anything but cool indifference."
Now at least there was a chance of civility. Yes, he had poured his heart out, had placed it right at John's feet, quite deliberately. It didn't make a difference in the big picture. After all, the only difference was that this time, John knew he had done it. It had been his all along anyway.
John took a breath and grasped Sherlock's hand with his own, holding it the same way he would if he were shaking his hand. And just as he had said, he did not let go.
Sherlock took this information in with a slow blink. It fit with what they already knew about Benjamin Forsythe's life. Apparently having to hide the existence of a small child on top of working a stressful job hadn't done his sleeping patterns any good. Clearly he should have tried getting a dog instead. It certainly seemed to have done wonders for Sherlock's ability to get a full night's sleep.
"Just got lucky," John said happily. "I didn't expect it, either, but apparently they had just had a cancellation. I find it's best not to look a gift horse in the mouth on these occasions."
John sighed. "You never said a word. I'm ... I'm not good at this, Sherlock. You were always so intensely private that when you did tell me things about yourself, I took your word for it. What else could I do? It never even occurred to me, crazy as it sounds. I suppose I never considered myself much of a catch. How was I ever going to assume that you, of all people, would disagree?"
Sherlock gave her a look. "Oh please. I have never once seen her cat sit on that pillow in all the time she's had it there. It's just there so she can rest her arms on it while watching what happens on the street. And besides, her cat died two months ago."
As they entered the breakfast room, they found most of the other guests in an excited huddle. Henryk and Weronikia Walczak sat at their usual table and seemed to make at least an attempt at having breakfast but only little food seemed to be consumed. Everyone else was standing together, clutching their mugs and talking in grave or excited tones.
, and then he was awake and the room was spinning around him and his stomach was heaving and there were large hands guiding him up and a warm, familiar baritone, thick with concern, though he couldn’t make out more than the basic gist of what it was telling him.
Before he knew it, Sherlock found himself making tea. People had always made a lot of silly assumptions about the two of them and Sherlock's personal pet peeve out of all of them had been that everyone thought John made the tea. Or the coffee. Or, in fact, any heated beverage, ranging from hot chocolate to mulled wine. All of these had always been Sherlock's forte and when he didn't make the tea but tea was unaccountably present, it must have just sort of happened because it sure as hell wouldn't have been made by John.
"Perfect," Sherlock assured him. "We'll have to force ourselves not to drink the water straight out of the tub."
"I do," he said wistfully. "And I do want to shift. I'm just not convinced it is safe for me to do so."
Shaking the thought off, he continued. "But instead, w-we are l-lying here in the s-snow, fr-freezing and s-staring at a... a goat."
"No no no, you aren't like any other Psy I've met, either. Changelings have a natural mistrust and dislike of Psy. Most of your kind stink of cold steel and we would no more want anything to do with you than we would want a rotting corpse in our lair. But here you are, Silent but constantly, actively, breaking the Protocol, refusing to live by any of your society's rules unless you like them. You're the first person to ever intrigue both parts of my nature, Sherlock. And with this experiment, it's getting increasingly difficult for me to remember where the lines are between us." He took a deep breath and ploughed on. "If it was up to me, I would erase them all."
He did, mind racing with possibilities, calculations. With her here to watch over him, he had approximately four hours before the need became overpowering.
Once, Sherlock had simply asked if John would mind if he stared at him. John hadn't even thought about disagreeing, but then Sherlock had stared for four hours and twenty-eight minutes, not saying a word, just watching every move he made.
"I'm on duty," Sally sighs. "The police always pulls extra shifts on Bonfire Night and with the personnel cutbacks we've suffered in recent years Scotland Yard isn't exempt from helping out. There are always more people needed than we have available. But I get the next day off as compensation, so it's not all bad."
It sounded tempting, actually. A comfortable evening eating take-out in front of the telly with Sherlock? Those used to be John's favourite nights, before.
"Now there's a long list of possible replies," Sherlock growled. "How about you start by explaining why you thought turning humans into animals was something you should waste tax money on? Or better yet, what you intend to do about the abysmal security of this facility?"
"When we visited the Yard after I was turned back. He got really hung up on that," John said, nodding at the picture. "Said I shouldn't lead you on." He grinned. "Looking at the picture now, I can see why he thought I might have been sending mixed signals."
"I don't blame you," John assured him. "It never would have occurred to me to blame you. It wasn't your fault, Sherlock. And of course you were entitled to be relieved. Hell, I would have been relieved, too, if it had been the other way around. I'm certainly rather relieved now, with the wisdom of hindsight."
"What next?" Donovan asked, jogging towards him. She had shifted and found some clothes to put on and had managed to return just in time to see the four disappear.
"No stag night," Sherlock confirmed. "At least, not one I will attend. Get Lestrade to sort out the particulars, he won't be able to make sense of my notes anyway. Tell him when it is and that he has to come up with something good."
Those were things Psy understood and excelled at. Why anyone would waste valuable time on activities that brought neither of these things was incomprehensible.
Sherlock sat on the sofa, leafing through one of his boxes of index cards of god-knew-what. He gave no sign that he had heard John speak.
He made himself a cup of tea and moved to lie down on the sofa, taking comfort from Sherlock's quiet presence.
He followed that with a general rundown of the case Sherlock had solved while he had been 'away' and concluded by saying that Johnny the dog was now back with Sherlock's parents and that Sherlock was moping about and pretending not to miss him.
She nods at Sherlock. "When you faked your own death. But also at the pool. And the pool was easy to research. So I started looking for security footage from that area. I got lucky with the corner shop. Just luck and good, honest police work. That was all it took."
He gasped and let his mouth fall open, wishing he could inhale with enough force to drag John closer by the sheer pull of his breath. He chased after him instead, bending down to meet him halfway. His hands found John's back and the back of his head and he kissed him and kissed him and kissed him.
"-and I need to turn my attention back to the case at hand, if you don't mind," he finished, ignoring John.
"All right. I was just asking. No need to get all defensive. I've never shared a flat with a Psy, I'd like to know what I'm in for."
If this was what Sherlock had based his conclusion on, then John could not help but agree with him. No one in their right mind could possibly read this and think John wanted to so much as look at Sherlock ever again.
"You need to shift, John," she told him sternly. "How long has it been? Over a year? John, this is getting dangerous. Do you really want to risk never being able to shift again?"
And all the while, Sherlock had laughed and talked and smiled more than John had ever seen him. It had reminded him of their first case together and of his blog post about his first impression of Sherlock.
He shook his head, forehead still pressed to Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t understand how I could ... it
Well, it didn't matter really. There had been enough witnesses, including the security cameras. And Mary was gone.
“Never thought I’d hear you apologise,” Lestrade muttered, and louder he said: “What’s this guy’s name? He might have held a grudge if he wanted to get back together. And I’ll need to follow up with him and get a DNA sample, of course.”
He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to concentrate on something else. It wouldn't do to think about it.
For a while, they are busy eating and all conversation is limited to praising Mrs Hudson (and Sally herself) for the feast laid out before them.
Sherlock, who was still looking at him and whose face turned increasingly serious with every second John failed to respond. Serious, and then sad.
Sherlock, surprised by what could easily be considered a flirtatious comment aimed at him, allowed a slow smile to spread over his face. "I don't hear you complaining."
He glanced at his watch. "After we've gotten some more sleep. It's the middle of the night. Come on, lie back down. We've had a stressful day, you can do with some rest."
John stretched and padded back into the sitting room. It was easier to deal with emotion in his animal form. Everything was so much simpler to the tiger. His mate was right there but currently beyond his reach. There was a strange Psy in the flat but he smelled of authority and his own mate and Sherlock needed him to be here. Therefore, John needed him to be here.
Molly made a noise that was dangerously close to a snort but when she spoke, her tone was as neutral as his. "Then, for the sake of convenience, I hope it will continue for some time."
Sherlock paused in the doorway to his room when he noticed that John hadn't followed him and asked: "Well? Are you going to stay out here tonight?"
John lifted his chin. If Sherlock expected him to understand every bit of Psy terminology he threw about, he could very well learn changeling vocabulary. "Yes. A predator's lair is his sanctuary and we do not allow strangers inside."
He met Mrs Hudson in the sitting room of 221b, where she sat in his armchair with a nice cuppa. She took one look at him, set her tea aside, stood, walked over and slapped him. Hard.
He took a deep breath before unlocking the front door. The cloud of warm air that greeted him smelled just as it always had done - of old furniture and Mrs Hudson's favourite cleaning supplies and freshly baked shortbread.
"Oh, I looked," Sherlock assured him. "For about a second, which was enough to completely short-circuit my brain. I had to hold on to a lab table to stop myself from jumping your bones right then and there."
He spent most of the cab ride quenching down on the feeling that he had forgotten something essential.
He did a quick double-blink, realising he had been standing in the bathroom, staring at John, for rather longer than politeness allowed. "Sorry."
"Erm, yeah sure," Lestrade says. "Good to see you, John. Good work on the... you know, this, Sherlock."
Sherlock stared into his cup, the corners of his mouth turning down. "Yes. He's been coming by more often and we're texting, so I suppose that's something. I just ... it's not enough, Mrs Hudson. We were standing right outside this door and I asked if he wanted to come up for a tea and some crap telly - don't give me that look, I didn't mean it as a euphemism - and I could tell he wanted to. And all he said was that he'd love to but that he had to go home to
"That's what I always tell myself, too," Patricia said, sighing. "And then two days later I hate myself because I can't remember what the hell it was."
"Right." He said and put his fork down. "You know, I was just asking if you'd ever thought of being with a man in general but it seems you're way ahead of me."
Sherlock breezed into the kitchen an hour after John had gotten up, dressed to go out and waving his phone.
They both shook their heads at that. Bill Murray, always cheerful and full of amusing stories without ever taking offense at anything, was Sherlock’s favourite out of all of John’s old army mates. He was also the only one he had met more than once, so perhaps the feeling was mutual.
"Have you found out anything new about Sora's death?" Emily asked, sitting down kitty-corner to Sherlock. The other male, Tyson, took a seat next to her but didn't seem inclined to contribute to the conversation.
Sherlock hadn't felt so lost in a long time. Every couple of steps, he turned his head and looked down at their joined hands, trying to comprehend the hows and whys of their entanglement.
“If they had found out ... if they had killed you...” Sherlock shook his head. “I wouldn’t have made it, John. Knowing I kept you alive all this time was the only thing that kept me going. If you had died just as I was on the homestretch, if it had all turned out to have been for nothing, I would have put a bullet through my brain at the first opportunity unless they killed me before I got the chance. Every day I thought would be the day where they’d drag you in and shoot you right in front of me.”
"Huh?," John murmured, pressing a kiss to his neck and momentarily distracting him. "Remember what?"
He demonstratively turned his back on his flatmate and rolled his eyes at his friends. "Sorry about ... well, him."
Sherlock opened his mouth, ready to deny it, but ... well ... John was his man, whether he knew it or not. And perhaps now, with the couple of days they had left here and the case out of the way, he could finally do something about that.
He dropped his bag by the door, stumbled two steps into the room and found himself faced with the empty sitting room and two empty armchairs and a silence that was so loud it hurt his ears.
He wagged his tail at her and went to greet her. More disinfectant, something flowery that must be her perfume, low-grade arousal - no doubt the result of being exposed to Sherlock for hours on end - and a hint of sweat, as could be expected after a long day at work. Oh, and cats. Faint but definitely there, a persistent scent that told him Molly had at least two cats of her own. He was almost glad for the disinfectant now.
Lestrade laughed. "There you go, John. That madman would have you on a strict diet if it weren't for us giving you some treats. I think he forgets that he's supposed to apologise to you for getting you into this situation in the first place."
"Uh... not really," John said. "It's a sort of trial run, you might say. Call it a trust-building exercise."
Emily and Tyson met them halfway through the park and the smile on Emily's face when she took in their scent was almost blinding.
So John cradled his cheek, stroking one thumb over that sharp cheekbone he had admired so often. Sherlock's eyes were wide open and fixed on him.
That morning, Greg Lestrade had thought he was going to have a perfectly boring Saturday. He didn't have to work, so he had slept in, had a very late breakfast that contained approximately two vitamins which clung to each other, crying softly because they were all alone, and drank half a pot of coffee.
Mycroft, with all the superior breeding one might expect of the son of an Earl in Victorian times rather than a man in modern London, could hardly decide which part of the situation he considered most outrageous: The fact that an expensive suit had been subjected to chlorinated water, or that it had happened at a public pool instead of a private one where such eccentricities may be excused. The knowledge that his younger brother had been wearing said suit as it came into prolonged contact with the water hardly bore thinking of.
close," she started, then paused. How did you explain emotional connections to someone who didn't have any? "The last time they saw each other was before he was deployed to Afghanistan. So yes, he may be sad and shocked by her death, but it would not have gutted him as it does our pack."
She stares at him, feeling the anger rising up inside of her like a tsunami. "No dirt under your fingernails, so you must have had time to clean up since you crawled out of your grave," she snipes back at him. "Did you have a nice holiday while everything here fell to pieces?"
Luckily, Mrs Hudson is already up. And she never did find someone for 221c. Feeling not the least bit guilty, Sally turns to her siblings and gives them the address. Time to get her stuff off the street before someone decides to steal it.
After that, the day had passed in a blur of joy - getting Sherlock's things sorted into their rightful place in the flat, filling the empty gaps on the shelves and in the closet with obscure books and Sherlock's expensive clothes, dinner and playtime with Rosie until she was tired enough for her eyes to keep drooping, and then getting her ready for bed together. Sherlock played her a lullaby on his violin and John watched as their daughter drifted off to sleep on the most beautiful melody he had ever heard.
"It is if the Council finds out about it. Luckily, Psy and humans just can't smell things at that level and you'll be hard-pressed to find a changeling willing to sell you out to the Psy Council. But if someone does... well, it's rehabilitation for you and who-knows-what for me." He sighed. "Perhaps you were right to revoke my skin privileges. All I did with them was put us both in danger."
He took a moment to compose an answer for Lestrade as John wagged his tail at him before standing and stretching. He turned to Sherlock with an expectant look on his face.
John thought, rather hysterically, that he had never had a lover who wanted to have this conversation with two of John's fingers up his arse. But this was Sherlock, who never did anything the conventional way.
Mary opened her mouth to protest further but Sherlock merely stared at her, calm and as perfectly composed as he could bring himself to be.
Sherlock sat up straight and tried to pretend he wasn't worried. But then John barged into the room, a little out of breath and smiling and Sherlock relaxed.
John barked again and propped himself up on the bed so he could reach Sherlock's back and nudge him with his nose.
Sherlock pulled the tennis ball out of his coat pocket. "All right then, let's tire you out a bit. I researched your breed and it appears that Tollers are working dogs and love fetching things. Particularly ducks, which is why they're so useful for the duck hunt, obviously. Now, I'm going to throw this and you are not going to injure yourself any further while fetching it. Agreed?"
He turned the laptop around so John could read the e-mail, then tried not to stare at John's lips. He had the most frustrating habit of moving them ever so slightly as he read to himself.
This one is for my best friend and flatmate who was there when the first word of this story was written almost four years ago and who was there when most of this chapter was written and who was there when this story was finished and who is still here and listens to me yell about this story all the time. Happy Birthday, love.
Only when he was certain that absolutely nothing of what he and John had done could possibly filter out into the Net did he allow himself to contemplate what had actually happened.
"Yes." Sherlock reluctantly stood and they left the dining hall and crossed the foyer into the cosy common room where guests could sit and talk and order a drink or two at the bar.
"Isn't it fantastic?" Sherlock grinned at him. "Murder on the Underground. It's both a splendid place to kill someone and also an utterly stupid place to commit a murder. There are enough cameras on there to make it absolutely impossible for the killer to walk away unseen and yet they disappeared."
Sherlock made a good show of startling and whirling around, hastily hiding his cigarette behind his back before pretending to recognise the person in front of him and relaxing. "Oh ... sorry, I thought you were John."
He was right, of course. The tea was indeed perfect. Far better than the stuff Mary made, John thought guiltily.
"Well, he definitely killed his father, though it was a spur-of-the-moment thing, judging by the crime scene."
"Sherlock Holmes ... we've certainly had our ups and downs and I haven't always been as honest with you, or myself, as I should have been. But I'm yours, if you want me, for as long as you want me."
Thanks to his sharper hearing, John had no trouble following the full conversation, listening intently to Lestrade's description of the crime scene as he washed the last of the pots and placed them next to the sink to dry off.
Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, we can exclude some of them immediately, I'm sure. Shouldn't be much of a challenge. Read on."
Loose paper was strewn about, several empty glasses had fallen over, as had Sherlock's music stand. And every single piece of furniture in the flat stood just slightly wrong. It looked as if some invisible force had lifted all of it, given it a good shake and set it down again. It said rather a lot about his own preoccupation at the time that he had not even noticed it happening.
Lestrade did and wished he could forget. "Yeah." He took a sip of his drink. "Don't want to ever have to go back to that, if it's all the same to you."
Soldiers, indeed. Was that why he had taken to John so quickly? Did that mean that, in some way, Sherlock found John attractive? He had always ignored Mrs Hudson's comments on the matter, but now it occurred to him that the landlady had known Sherlock for years before John had met him, and perhaps she knew something he didn't.
Again she glanced at her mate and he knew there was something she wanted to say but likely couldn't without compromising a pack secret. "Just a rough idea will do," he added, to spare her the choice.
John opened his mouth to respond to that but Sherlock went on. "Anyway, you don't have a place to go and you don't have a job and your money is running out. Impossible to live in London on an army pension unless you sleep rough. I can offer you an interesting job where all your skills would be put to good use. We set our own fees for the private clients and I've got my eye on a nice flat. The landlady ows me a favour so together we ought to be able to afford it."
By the time she has extracted three plates and given them a rinse in the sink, the table is spotless and Holmes has even unearthed cutlery that actually looks like it won't give them food poisoning. Perhaps she is being a bit harsh on him. Not all substances in this flat can cause a gastrointestinal crisis. Right?
Finally, the silence was broken by the chime of Sherlock's datapad. He glanced at it and stood. "There has been another one."
"Hm, and I'm sure it had nothing to do with you missing London and hating to be cooped up inside one house with so many other people for several days," John mused.
Sherlock shrugged, pressing his face to the crook of John's neck. "It was silly. I was ... I felt guilty, for being so glad she was dead while you were suffering because of it."
But it was the smile on her face and the night-sky eyes that marked her as a Cardinal that took his breath away.
"Since you stopped using your eyes, Perkins!" she called back. "He belongs to the freak. Didn't you see them come in half an hour ago?"
He held her close for the entire ride, her bee stuffed into a pocket of his jacket. He could have lost her. He had lost her, for a time. But he could have lost her for so much longer, possibly forever. Earlier he had told Sherlock that she would likely be clingy for a bit, but the truth was that he rather suspected he would be holding on for much longer than she would. Kids bounced back quickly and she had the support system needed to see her through. Still, it would be some time before he would feel confident enough to let her out of his sight beyond being in the next room.
John smiled a wry little smile. "Well, you've never been good with sentiment, particularly that of other people towards you."
Accordingly, he made sure his response was even quieter. "Could we contact them? Ask them to speak to their Psy? I want to know how they did it. I want to know how they managed to leave the Net and survive."
Sally rolls her eyes at him and he relents. "Honestly didn't think of it. I thought he had learned not to do that since John started using him as his personal chauffeur."
He leaned back in his seat, took note of the time, and kept his eyes on John for the ride. He was utterly incapable of resisting the urge to reach down and stroke his hand through the thick fur of John's back every now and then and saw no reason to stop himself. Any concerned dog owner would be attempting to keep their pet calm in a high-stress situation such as this one.
They smiled at each other. Finally, John blinked and nudged him with his arm before moving over to the small coffee table and armchairs. "Come on, we've got a couple of days left here - let's see if we can find some nice hiking routes. I feel like getting fresh air for a bit."
"Thank you for confirming my theory," Sherlock said calmly. He turned to the officers. "I suppose that is all you needed to hear. If you have any further questions or require a full statement, I will be here for another two days. Feel free to come by at any time."
"My husband will be able to tell you more about what kind of a worker he was, but he was a nice young man, very kind. He had his flights of fancy, as young people do, but no more than others."
Sherlock shrugged. "I just felt like it," he said. "Come on. We've had a long drive and you need to get some sleep."
"Now what could make you both anxious and angry? Lots of things, naturally, most often related to either me or your sister. You haven't had contact with Harry since that short e-mail exchange last week. Therefore, me. I haven't done anything but mind my experiment all day and you were already behaving that way when I woke. Conclusion: something I did last night that I don't remember, which makes you angry and which you don't want me to know about, hence the jittery behaviour. So let me ask you again. What did I do?"
Sherlock's frown deepened as he backtracked and replayed that specific section again. The victim developed a nosebleed and dropped dead.
He found the picture he had snapped of John under the flowers, in the half-second before several important parts of his brain had simply melted.
"I have every right," he said. "First of all, I can wear whatever jewellery I like, on whichever body part I like. If I wanted to get a nipple pierced tomorrow, there is no one on this earth who could stop me, and certainly no one will stop me from wearing anything as simple as a ring. Secondly, you are the last person I'll come to for advice on jewellery."
Sherlock blinks at him, confused. This is the tone John uses when Sherlock has blatantly disregarded something as irrelevant that is important to everyone else. It's the tone that suggests missed social cues, ignored unspoken rules, a demonstration of Sherlock's tone-deafness in the field of interpersonal communication.
Sherlock sighed. "Because I was already out walking with him when Lestrade here called me in. I do live just across the park. Surely you are aware of that - unless your sense of direction is as lacking as your professional skills."
Sherlock sniffed. "What could you possibly have that I might wish to examine? Now hurry up, Lestrade texted me. There has been a murder."
"I know," John said. "But the great thing about the future is that you can change it whenever you like. And if someone gives you the choice between what you
While Sherlock, apparently done with the paperwork Lestrade had deemed it necessary for him to sign, flipped through the case file the DI hat given him, Lestrade pulled John aside for a private conversation.
John sighed. "Well, that won't be the first time we end up sharing," he pointed out. "It'll be fine."
No, Sherlock decided. All things considered, things had gone as well as could have been expected. Sure, he could have done without yesterday's painful argument, but they had made it in the end. And John was here now. John had kissed him. John had said he wanted to give this marriage a chance. Sherlock would do anything at all to make sure he didn't regret it.
"We could ..." Sherlock paused and licked his lips, unable to take his eyes off John. "We could stay right here for half an hour while you explain to me why you aren't absolutely furious. That might do for you, but I can assure you it will do nothing for me. I'm afraid I'm never going to be presentable while you're anywhere in the vicinity."
Sherlock took a deep breath. "I think about it all the time, John. But since you've already made it clear it won't ever happen, I can do nothing but accept your choice and support you in it."
"And what did he communicate?" Lestrade asked, visibly torn between amusement and concern for John's well-being.
James shrugged. "I doubt that would help matters much. A bunch of amateur detectives who've read too many Agatha Christie novels hardly seem equipped to solve an actual murder, don't you think?"
While this story is over, I do of course have a whole pile of others already in the works. One reasonably short one (for my standards) is just lacking a bit of a final polish and will likely go up on the 10th of February. Those who've stuck around for a while know that I always try to post something new on my birthday, so I'll keep doing that.
Lestrade's head snapped up. "John!" He beamed. "This is a surprise. I didn't know you'd be ... uh ... back so soon."
Smiling, Sherlock continued pacing. "Oh, this is fantastic! So many angles! I know the son killed his father in an argument. But was he also responsible for the embezzlement? Did his father merely believe him to be? Was that the cause of the argument or where they fighting over some unrelated matter? And if so, who was responsible for the death of the son mere hours later? I wish Lestrade would hurry up and show me the crime scene pictures so I could strike suicide off the list of possibilities."
When she walks in, she can hear Sherlock gleefully giving instructions and shouting at people. She smiles to herself as she unlocks her door and disappears into the bustle-free calmness of her flat. At least he's enjoying himself.
"But what if the police have any more questions?" John asked. "You haven't even given them a proper statement yet."
Sherlock shrugged. "Nonetheless, it has become a tradition. It has burned down more often than not. Sometimes even twice in the same year."
He took another, shuddering, breath. "That's what it's supposed to be like, isn't it? Letting him go and smiling as I watch him leave? What's that stupid saying again, the one about setting them free? Well, I have. And he won't be back. There's a wife and house in the suburbs and then 2.3 children and maybe a dog, and a steady job at the clinic. He doesn't need me for that. He never needed me as much as I needed him."
"Can I close the window now or do you wish me to freeze to death first?" Sherlock asked from the sofa. "Bit of an overreaction, that form of punishment."
"Purple leggings and her favourite green dress," John said immediately. "And a light blue raincoat."
From afar, they looked like completely ordinary square pieces of paper dangling from the tree. Up close, they still looked like that. But add some strategically placed black lights and they would turn into pieces of art. Naturally, each and every one of them depicted a rather grotesque crime scene. Where other people would have gone with invisible ink, however, Sherlock had spent some time with his microscope and luminous bacteria.
For one crazy moment, John wanted to pull Sherlock closer and kiss him. He balled his hands into fists instead. He was getting married in three days, now was not the time for these silly old feelings to resurface. They weren't welcome, anyway.
He had no idea where his t-shirt had gone but was determined to have John's end up in the same place. The attempt to remove it was hampered by John's unwillingness to let go of him and it took some negotiation to convince him of the merits of skin-on-skin, even if they came with the drawback of having to let go for a moment.
They shared a long look. Next to Sherlock, John gave a low whine and nudged at Sherlock's leg with his nose, his tail thumping against the upholstery. Apparently, he approved of the plan such as it was.
But he held back. He had to, this time, because he knew John wouldn't like his theory and he knew John would definitely overreact if Sherlock so much as mentioned it.
"No." The word was half slurred. "I want to keep this. I've never felt ... anything like this. Please."
For once, Sherlock did as he was told. It didn't take long for him to polish off most of his plate and Lestrade watched with a curious mix of satisfaction and growing concern. Sherlock was a picky eater, he knew that from years of observation. He didn't usually dig in unless he reached a point where his body overruled that big brain of his.
Sherlock actually looked affronted at that. "Oh please. You have been acting strange all day, John. You won't meet my eyes, you've been positively jittery all day and just this morning you were radiating anger."
Sherlock waited, knowing better than to interrupt. John might be annoyed and refuse to help him if he did, so he kept quiet, trying to figure out what John was thinking based on his expression. He had learned to read basic emotions off of faces, of course - recognising and correctly identifying sentiment in others was a valuable skill to have when negotiating any type of business deal, after all - but he soon gave up. There were too many nuances he did not understand.
Sherlock hailed a cab, gave the driver the address to Barts and stared sightlessly out of the window until the cab came to a stop outside the hospital.
John doesn't know what to say and Sherlock doesn't seem to think there is anything that needs to be said.
John did return the next day. This time, Sherlock had prepared for the possibility and had showered, shaved and put on a fresh suit. The way John had frowned at his stubbled jaw yesterday hadn't escaped his notice. Few things ever did.
"Could someone have done it from farther away?" John asked. "Someone standing out on the street, maybe?"
But right then, he couldn't even be sorry and so he wasn't, knowing the regret and the anguish would come later, once the pleasure had seeped through and from their systems and the reality of what they had done finally sunk in. But not yet. Not yet.
Before he could question Sherlock further, the food arrived. "Dig in," Lestrade said. "The rest can wait a bit but you look like you're about to faint."
"Definitely not a dump," John said, depositing his duffel at the foot of the bed and doing a 360 degree turn to take in what was to be their room for the coming week.
Sherlock thought they should have. Someone must have. People were so obsessed with their relationships, surely someone had thought to make people share a bed and see what happened. If only he had internet access here, he could have pulled out his phone and researched it.
"This is where you live now? Cor, John, that's not half bad," Tyson said as he stepped into their sitting room.
Finally, the evening wound down. Their bellies were full and their plates empty, John was swirling the last dregs of wine around in his glass in that way he always did when he merely wanted something to occupy his hand and had no intention of actually drinking the last sip.
The man himself has been busy recently - my old bedroom upstairs suddenly became available and he's building himself a proper lab up there. I told him so long as he doesn't cook up meth or any other illegal substances in it, it's fine with me. Our friends at the Yard have taken to calling our place 'CSI Baker Street'. I had a good laugh about it but Sherlock found it a perfectly reasonable name. I told him we'd watch a bit of CSI and he got very excited about a show about crime scene investigators. No one tell him, please. I'm already looking forward to his commentary.
Instead, the room was empty. He checked the bathroom and even the closet just to make sure, then shook his head at himself. Sherlock had already come out - in a way - in the dining room the other day, he was highly unlikely to be lurking in any closets.
"Remember to let him sleep, John. He may very well remain unconscious for the next twenty-four hours. I assure you it is not cause for concern. Otherwise, I would have called a medic already."
"Do you think I'm very like her?" really means "Do you think I'm a psychopath? Do you think I am incapable of feeling, the way she is?"
When his phone rang, Sherlock promptly dropped the dish towel and pulled the device out of his pocket. "Yes?"
John, who was starting to wonder if he had developed some form of sixth sense for this sort of thing happening, sprang forward and managed to wrestle the man's arm down before he could do more than swing in Sherlock's vague direction. The older man was quite spry for his age and put up a good fight but John knew how to quickly and efficiently disarm an attacker and within moments he had Henryk on his knees with his arm twisted behind his back and the crowbar on the floor.
Sherlock stilled, hand still outstretched for the remote control. He carefully lowered his arm and sat back, giving John a long look, as if searching for something in his face.
Story of his life this. Sherlock had appeared, all bold and dark against the blandness of John's existence, and then been crossed out. Gone.
At the same time, John threw one foot forward to catch himself and take some of his weight off the detective, who was now completely unbalanced and couldn't lunge forward fast enough to avoid colliding with the tree behind him.
His voice wavered on the last sentence and he took another deep breath, another lungful of John-scented air.
There is nowhere for his body to go now, held between the proverbial rock and a hard place, only the hard place are the planes of John's chest and his strong thighs and Sherlock is trapped between John's body and the kitchen counter, both equally unyielding.
It was a sensible choice, in as much as Sherlock made sensible choices. But why on earth would he get a ring in the first place? John had handed him the divorce papers and Sherlock's response had been to put on a ring. For what? Was this an attempt to spite him? To draw unnecessary attention to their situation? No, that seemed silly. Sherlock wouldn't tell everyone he had gotten married only to get divorced a couple of weeks later. That didn't make sense.
And of course there was that other canine part of him, the one that had had him struggling against his own nature in the supermarket today. Perhaps it was a part of the dog whose DNA had been used in the experiment John had accidentally encountered, but for some inexplicable reason he absolutely hated cats. And the idea of chasing one had been incredibly tempting.
"I know what it is, John. Mistletoe is used in medicine to treat respiratory and circulatory system problems and to catch birds in South Africa. What I want to know is what it is doing dangling from our ceiling."
happen unless he agrees to take the job. He insisted I make you aware of my intentions. I am sorry for the inconvenient timing but this really cannot be put off."
Not a pillow. Sherlock's abdomen, rising and falling with each breath he took. Judging from his even breathing pattern, sluggish heartbeat and utterly relaxed body, the detective was still asleep.
Knowing that going back to sleep was no longer an option, he tugged the shreds off the mattress and dumped them in a corner of his room to be dealt with in the morning.
When Sherlock returned from the bathroom, he stopped dead for a moment, staring at John as if he were seeing a mirage.
Instead, he made dinner. He needed to be kept occupied in the kitchen for as long as possible, so he began cutting up vegetables for soup and, once he had enough, kept cutting and slicing and dicing until he had enough to freeze several bags of carrots for days when he didn't feel like spending too much time preparing his dinner.
Sherlock let out bitter little laugh. "You'll never see him again. And this wasn't the way. I could have told you, had you asked. I could have saved you all of this. Forgiveness does not come easily to John. Did you think stealing his daughter and luring him to you would make him stay? He would have hunted you to the ends of the earth. And when you least expected it, he would have destroyed you and taken her home. Though I suppose I shouldn't judge you for miscalculating. John is unpredictable at the best of times. Even so ... he was never one to accept bribery or extortion."
He breathed in deeply, enjoying the clean air. With this nose, he could actually smell the gradual decline of the percentage of weed smoke in the air and it was glorious. He would be able to find the scent again anywhere, now that it was stored in his mind, but for now it was being erased from the flat by slow degrees.
"Was that innuendo?" she asked, grinning. "Holmes, I think John has been teaching you some things while we weren't looking." She gave a fake gasp. "Is that why you smell like each other?!"
"Time to go," Sherlock said, picking up the end of his lead and standing. "Thank you for your help, Mrs Munkeld. I hope we will be able to take a suspect into custody within the week. In the meantime, please do keep an eye on the company's accounting. I'm sure the Yard will want experts to go over every single number and we wouldn't want any of that information to suddenly disappear in an accident because someone mistakenly put it through the shredder, wouldn't we?"
John Watson toed off his boots and closed the door with a heavy sigh of relief. He had escaped the clinic a full hour later than originally intended, having spent all day treating sore throats, first degree burns and far too many cases of the common cold to be allowed. No more. It was Christmas and he was determined to enjoy a nice, peaceful holiday if it killed him.
"It's an old building," John said, shrugging. "They always need maintenance of some sort. I see what you mean, though. It doesn't make sense for them to have hidden it here. They might have been desperate enough for money to kill Freddy to get to it, though."
She wakes up in the middle of the night to Dante hopping onto her stomach, meowing, and to an incessant dripping noise.
Laden down with their purchases, they did stop for ice cream and sat down on a bench to enjoy the treat and rest their legs for a bit.
And then, much faster than John with his personal insight into the sluggish pace of medical testing for the NHS would have expected, the lead scientist returned with a satisfied and uncomfortably eager expression on her face. "All tests have been completed to our satisfaction. We are now ready for the procedure."
"You've been to a war zone, I won't refute that you have your fair share of traumatic memories to choose from." The DI looked around to make sure that Donovan was back at her desk and that Sherlock was still absorbed in the case file on the other side of the room. "I'm just ... worried about you two, actually. You got pretty close there. Everyone with eyes in their heads could see it."
John wondered if he would ever get used to this, if his heart might one day not trip all over itself in his chest at these words. "I love you, too, Sherlock Holmes."
They all take seats around Mrs Hudson's kitchen table and she bustles about, switching on the kettle and offering shortbread.
Then his mind caught up with him. 'Friend' Molly had said. Were they friends? They must be. They lived together and hadn't tried to kill each other even once and John seemed to actually enjoy his company and if he weren't trying to be Silent, Sherlock might be willing to admit that John's company was ... welcome. And they had touched. That was what friends did, wasn't it? Touching and offering food as John often did when he forgot that Sherlock didn't eat it. And touching. Mustn't forget that. The warm hand on the back of his neck ... surely only a friend would touch you in such a vulnerable spot without killing you.
It felt ... good, actually. He felt he was becoming better at remembering the steps, starting to develop a muscle memory of where to go when and what to do next.
It wasn't the only thing John had been worried about, of course, but there was no healthy way of saying that, so he kept his mouth shut and hoped Sherlock wouldn't deduce it anyway.
"Fine," Sherlock snapped. "Fine. You tell him that. In those words precisely. Don't even think about sugarcoating what you just said to me. If he agrees, so will I. Otherwise, you can stuff it."
But John would not be John if he was in any way predictable, and so his next words are 'Come here then.'
"As I said," Sherlock said softly, not turning to look at him. "It has always been and always will be merely theoretical."
What else? Oh, yes. Mrs Hudson is beside herself with joy to have us both back 'where we belong'. We haven't had to cook any meals for ourselves in over a week and she didn't even complain when Sherlock stole all her liquid honey. Don't ask. He claims it was for science and we'll leave it at that.
"No, you're right, I don't really think you'll have occasion to spend much time with other dogs and it's unlikely one will become relevant in a case before your situation has been resolved."
Sherlock had stood precisely one and a half steps behind John and had found occasion to examine the window visible over his friend's shoulder in great detail as he fought not to react in any way. And if there was a look of mild disgust on his face, it could easily be explained away by his opinion of sentiment as a whole.
"Oh yes," Sherlock said calmly, still staring straight ahead. "I was just thinking ... I might find myself a nice cottage somewhere out here for my retirement."
Sherlock flinched and John grimaced. "I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. I meant ... I meant I wanted someone whom it was
Their little game was interrupted by the arrival of a car. Truthfully, it was interrupted before the car arrived, because John recognised the sound of that engine quite clearly - he had only just escaped it roughly two hours ago, after all. Just as Sherlock was about to go and hide in 221c or somewhere equally ridiculous, John whined and turned his head towards the window.
Reluctantly, John paused by the door and waited until Sherlock had shrugged on his coat and grabbed his phone off the table.
Sherlock had been watching him. "You agree that this is what you smelled? I'm assuming it didn't occur to you because you don't usually encounter skin powder in your life outside of work and there were no hints of anyone having a skin condition anywhere."
John managed to lift his hand and press it to Sherlock's cheek. "But he didn't. I'm fine. Give me some ice for my head and handful of painkillers and I'll be right as rain in no time at all."
She cooks a celebratory dinner for one while she listens to her sister gush about her honeymoon for the fifth time, smiling the entire time.
Something in his tone must have tipped Sherlock off. His head snapped up and he glanced at John, his own eyes widening. "Oh, god, no, not that. They never ... no. I suppose some people would say I was lucky but ... well, it's hard to feel lucky when you're being beaten into unconsciousness."
Since there was no point in lying about in bed now that he was awake and because he was actually feeling a bit peckish, John shook off the covers, jumped off the bed with a quiet 'thump' and went down the stairs and into the kitchen. It was then that he remembered that he was incapable of making his own breakfast on account of not having opposable thumbs anymore. For a moment he thought about returning to bed but his stomach was growling and now that he was only one level above her and awake enough to pay attention, he could hear Mrs Hudson snoring softly in her bedroom downstairs, so getting her to help him was not an option.
John woke in a warm bed, soft sunlight streaming through a gap in the curtains. He stretched and groaned softly as various muscle groups complained. He didn't mind. There wasn't a single ache he wouldn't mind feeling all over again if only he could get up the energy to wake Sherlock and repeat the entire thing.
It was therefore with very little reluctance that John found himself entering stores that were a bit more upmarket than he would usually choose for himself and trying on clothes he would not have dared to look at twice if he had been on his own. But Sherlock, damn him, had an eye for these things.
Sherlock smiled but before he could reply, he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. "Ah."
His first reaction was surprise - had he really slept through the night? It appeared so, and he was honestly amazed. That hadn't happened to him in ages.
Sherlock blinked and the expression was replaced with one of fond amusement. “More like a flower wig but I take your point.”
Sherlock managed to stay there for a full eighteen minutes before he gave up and migrated to the sitting room.
John smiled and took a step closer so he could look into Sherlock's eyes as he spoke. "I want you. All of you, all the time."
After a not entirely uncomfortable silence, the kettle flicked off and Molly returned to the table, pouring fresh tea for them both.
he wanted to say. But he didn't because he suspected Sherlock would not be able to agree to that. John had no right to ask him for anything anymore. Sherlock had already given him everything.
He gives her another one of those long, knowing looks. "How often do you think Mrs Hudson can bear to lose someone who is a surrogate son to her? Do you think you could stand by and watch it happen again?"
John snorted. "What else was I supposed to do? Let him ruin my wedding day? You know he would have. He made it quite clear that he wasn't joking."
“A lion, John! Some British explorer or something. They found his body in the savanna and had him sent back home for a thorough examination because the local morgue wasn’t equipped to handle the case and she showed me clear teeth imprints. She promised to make a cast.”
He places his own cup on the table next to his chair before tapping Sherlock's arm with his now free hand. "Your tea."
He couldn't breathe. Any moment now he would have to let John go and he wouldn't get him back like this, ever, and
The next afternoon, a couple of hours before Lestrade would pick him up for his stag night, John found himself inside the sitting room of 221b Baker Street once more. Part of him had expected to see Sherlock there, bent over the seating plan or pacing as he went over the timetable all over again.
There was a pause and then Rosie cried "PA!" and crawled out from in between the benches with surprising speed to hurl herself into his arms.
There was neither time nor the opportunity to get relief and he really had no idea how a dog would even go about that, save for humping someone's leg.
He reached the old hangar of what had once been London City airport in an astonishing thirty-seven minutes. A cyclist would have needed about twice as long, depending on the speed at which they rode.
"Already done," Mycroft said. "I, too, have some eyes on the street I can get in contact with." He turned and nodded to his assistant, who had been hovering in the corner, typing away on her phone. "Anthea, if you would be so kind."
There was only one source of light in the room, hidden behind a pile of wooden crates. They looked sturdy and John marked their position in case they might turn out useful later. The voice had come from somewhere behind them.
Sally doesn't know how long she and Mrs Hudson sit on that sofa. All she knows is that Holmes starts to play and the music wraps around her and she loses track of time for a bit.
And yet he was holding the evidence right here in his hands. When he thought back over the past weeks and months, the signs kept piling up, towering over him in an accusing manner that seemed to ask:
To have Mycroft Holmes point her to this specific case, there must be a connection there. If there isn't, he at least suspects there is and Sally doesn't need anyone to tell her that if Mycroft Holmes suspects something, it is likely to be true.
John wasn't sure whether to protest at the prospect of having to break their kiss to remove his jumper all the way, or to be relieved about getting rid of it. Suddenly, there were too many layers between them. There always had been, in fact, layers upon layers, some metaphorical, some real. But not now. Not any more. They were being stripped away in this very moment and he couldn't imagine a better thing to do. Well... apart from the kissing, maybe. And the touching. That was nice. And once they had gotten rid of all these layers, it would only get better.
All thoughts of apologising and making a run for it were swept clean from his mind as his entire being focused on the precise feel and taste and sound of Sherlock Holmes beneath him. He tasted of toothpaste and the tea John had made for him earlier and beneath that of something impossible to define that tasted like Sherlock's voice sounded - sinful and forbidden and dangerous. Everything John lived for.
Sherlock grinned. “You really do. But I do recall mentions of a trip to Edinburgh. Perhaps we should consider pulling that forward until the media frenzy calms down a little. I really don’t know why they have to make such a fuss.”
John sighed and followed him out the door, resigned to at least an hour of standing guard while Sherlock did his thing.
Yes, they had managed to celebrate their first Christmas as flatmates. They had even entertained guests. Irene Adler's fake death, the long-overdue end of Lestrade's marriage and John getting dumped again, however, were not conductive to proper holiday cheer.
"The wolves?" John blurted, surprised. "Everyone knows they kill intruders first and ask questions later."
He hadn't even registered them at first and then it had happened precisely as John had pulled him to his feet and he had almost stumbled right into him because ... well.
He was some sort of setter, John thought. Certainly looked as if he had an Irish Setter somewhere in there, with his soft reddish-brown fur. He was wearing a collar with a tag, his name on one side and a phone number on the other. John assumed it was Sherlock's and wondered if he should maybe save it. He decided against it. If Sherlock wanted him to be able to contact him directly, he would say so. At the moment, it didn't look as if Sherlock even wanted to be in the same room with him.
"He went to see you when you came to visit his grave. You and John, I mean," Molly tells her. "He wouldn't say what happened but he was a wreck afterwards. If he could have done things differently, he would have. He never expected it to take so long for him to be able to come back."
They turned towards the Yard and strode through the sliding glass doors together, as they always did. Lestrade was already waiting for them when they stepped out of the lift on his floor, looking exhausted but triumphant.
John didn't know what to say. Sherlock had felt like this for years. And he hadn't given him even the slightest hint. Not once. Not until now. And if he had, John had failed to notice them at the time. No, there was no "if" about it. John
"No, you're not eating out of your bowl, John! It's boring and too quick. We need something to keep you occupied so you won't get bored. Here, I stuffed your food into this kong!"
But of course that would mean facing him, giving him the letter, watching his face as he read it, perhaps. He would not risk it. If this was the end of their friendship, he did not want to see it die in Sherlock's eyes.
Two iridescent eyes opened and focused on him with unerring accuracy. There was something daring and bright in them that John thought might be hope. He had no intention of letting that go to waste.
Each time he notices one of these things, his breath will inexplicably hitch in his chest and the warm glow behind his breastbone will intensify and he wonders if Sherlock notices.
"Well, it's really good to have you back, John," Lestrade said. "I mean, he's usually unbearable without you there, so it was a nice surprise to see Sherlock act like a human being with that dog, but there's no need to put it to the test."
He could still feel John's warm hands on his skin, his breath on his throat, the broad swipe of his tongue along his neck. How could he possibly give that up? How could he, when it would hurt John in the process?
"So do I. But it will be fine. I'll get Greg to take tons of pictures and make some videos for you to watch so you can make sure it all went according to plan, all right?"
Sherlock racked his brain for something. "I ... I could phone Lestrade, ask if he's got something. Or maybe ..." He paused, remembering. "Wait here."
For a second, he thought he saw panic flicker in Sherlock's eyes but it was replaced with scorn a heartbeat later. "Don't be ridiculous, John. I've been doing nothing else for our entire visit here."
"It's time to get up if we want to get a look at the crime scene," Sherlock elaborated, sounding far too awake and excited for-
"I'm starting to feel bad for talking about them like that," Sally says. "I mean, they're two grown men. They should be able to figure this out on their own, shouldn't they? I feel like I already did my bit by stopping the wedding, though I did resort to rather drastic measures to do it."
"Very well," Mycroft said. "I shall be leaving you now. And Sherlock, do try to remember that being unable to speak does not mean you can assume you are being given consent to do whatever you like. Have a good day."
John nodded. "Then let's get out of here. Perhaps Molly will have more information after the autopsy."
As he had predicted, John was able to take Rosie home about an hour later. By that time, she was definitely too tired and nodded off before they even made it out of the hospital and into the cab.
"If he chooses to remain committed to marrying her, I won't need it anyway," Sherlock said. "So what does it matter?"
Sherlock beamed at him, jumping up in excitement. He was gone in a flash, his blue dressing gown sweeping dramatically after him. As was the norm on days spent soley at home, he hadn't bothered to actually get dressed in the morning and was still in his pajamas.
