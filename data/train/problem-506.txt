Would he have allowed himself to let it go and welcome the loved one back home?
No doubt the man had cleared out Sherlock's things the moment all formalities of the estate had been finalized. John was surprised it took so long. Must have been over a year? Mycroft was slipping … stuff had still been there when John left. But John really hadn't allowed himself to think about it. Now he wondered ...
That this change will

Sherlock worried that he might not have heard, or may not want to speak to him. Ever again. Now that...   He barely reached out an arm, before having his hand pulled roughly back into lockdown. And when John breathed in sharply, Sherlock's stilled his own intake, to hear what he would reply. The few moments they had left, were a precious commodity. And he

Harry hadn’t teased him.
Listening to a song
All because he had avoided hitting Sherlock in the nose or lips
John stiffened in his seat. His eyes burning. He swallowed to push it back. The pain. Not here. Not now.
A small grin was tugging at the corner of his mouth. The kind that could infect a person

Disappointment.
A shout and some hooligans cut by in front of them. They began wrestling over a backpack, fighting on the ground, not thirty paces or so from where they stood. Fixed. Sherlock’s eye shifted to the stance and carry of the man he had been following … bolt upright now.
Just wanting to hold onto one more minute of
He turned, and took a few strides towards Sherlock. Helping him upright. Trying to assess if any damage had been done? His hand grazed Sherlock's temple, brushing aside the curls, checking for any cuts or scratches. Even a bruise … and he would hunt those men down for murder …
Before us,
"Well -," she went over to hug him, “that's the first bit of common sense I've heard out of your mouth.” Her arms wrapping around his narrow shoulders, squeezing him against herself like a mama-bear. It felt good to have some human interaction that was of the gentler nature. Mycroft certainly was not going to have done so, the welcoming committee had been as formal as a dentists appointment. And John ...
“I’m sorry,” he says, by way of finality. And of apology, perhaps.
John leaned up against the counter. Stretching out and tapping away at the happy music that was pouring from the bar he had just vacated. His entire air carefree - as he looked up into the night sky.
John felt exposed. Raw, like nerve endings cut
Sherlock met his eyes and laughed. Releasing the tension. “I know what I want,” he stated. Allowing his gaze to linger over John’s form just a second too long and John decided he was done with this tomfoolery …
and John had headed into the kitchen.
Why was Sherlock saying these things? Would Sherlock ever have talked like that? John wondered. Boggled really, at where his mind was running away to...
Mike looked up. Really meeting John’s eyes. Hoping for sobriety. And finding it. Very, very much, finding it. There.
John's eyes fell.
“Types?” the man looked confused a second. “243? Oh, that!
He had not even tried to deduce that part!
John realized.

John came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his middle. Snuggling him tight for a moment. When something caught his eye …

Sherlock watched him walk several more steps. His mind, analyzing and supplying possible trauma, probable causes ... His walk.

He curled up into himself on the pavement rocking back-and-forth; calling, calling and calling for Sherlock by name.

He patted John's shoulders to indicate he should stay seated for a bit, and then went off into the kitchen to ask the permission of the Chef for an audience ...
Sherlock's eyes went wide. Then they also dropped, "I didn't mean it like that," he stated.
Sincerely, I am so, so sorry!
For he had been, Sherlock's world.

Rumors began spreading of people making an appearance back to their loved ones. Heart-warming reunions were shared on the news. People were calling it a miracle. There was a way to get your loved ones back!
John liked being able to surprise the one who was always one step ahead.
John realized that the young man must think he was upset at something or would cause a scene.
For it was all-consuming.
John put his hands in his pockets. He had not brought Sherlock flowers today.

He dared. Opening his mouth to start ... "Mrs. Hudson -"
If Sherlock thinks you are fun - you are either a) John Watson, or b) a Serial Killer. Watson comes first, always.
John took in a deep breath. Sherlock clearly coming to the same realization, as the man before him … The momentousness of this occasion. They could finally go back home!
He'd almost hoped she would bring up their old hijinx as kids. Happy memories. Big hopes and dreams. But at the wedding invite, she’d merely groaned, “you’re marrying that vampire?”
for the answer.
Rumors had continued to circulate … fed in part by the false information still out there.
John chuckled at the realization while he was watching the news and almost simultaneously, the phone rang.
And the insufferable prick had not shown his face.
John wondered if it was polite here to leave a tip? This waiter deserved one,
That was sitting on the tip
Once again that feeling,

In which, there are regrets ...
John sat up swiftly in his bed, throwing off the covers. He had awoken, sweating and hyperventilating. He knew that he had been screaming. Loudly. His throat felt every inch of the strain he had used in the force of it. Scratching it. Tearing the sound out as if with his bare hands to comply with his wishes ...  and now his voice was hoarse.
The dry leaves beneath his shoes crumbled. Crunching in the earthy moss and grasses that covered the churchyard, largely untended. A few graves stood out. Well groomed, with a vase and flowers regularly standing vigil.
Sherlock smiled at that. Pinning John’s arms down.
John found himself making a post on their two year anniversary -
He whispered as the doors closed,
“You know ..." John interrupted,
John folded his arms and he sat back in curiosity.
John was not sure why Sherlock had not wrapped up this case already? It rarely took days, let alone the number of months Sherlock must have spent here so far? He really must have been distracted …

His thoughts were practically shouting.
John waited patiently for the inevitable. Leaning up against the counter casually, as she gently knocked on the door between them, and then opened it up when John called her inside.
He was spared the trouble.
Sherlock knew.
John had packed up his few belongings. Not caring what fate he was running off to. So long as it was in the opposite direction of the marshmallow existence he had nearly resigned himself to twenty-four hours ago.
John looked the painful question,
With Mary around …
That's why it had been such a chilling threat.

"Oh yes! Doctor Watson, right sir?" the boy continued, "Chef made it special, just as you like."

After the initial grind to a halt, governments had taken action quickly. It had been a month of scrambling and gathering. Of talking heads deciding what was best to be done. Frantically swearing in newly promoted officials and covering essentials within the now half-missing workforce.
"Heheh! Your lady called me up twice today to make sure I had the time down right! Then she ups and bumps the appoint’d time an 'alf ‘our! Musta been tha’ worried you'd bolt?" He laughed heartily. Trying to catch John's eye again and make sure he was laughing with him?
He felt a little shaken. A little like the ground had shifted beneath him and might give way at any moment.

Wanting to see just what was going on here … and keeping alert to any red flags now … John came up with a few more questions.

Sherlock inspected the way the man carried himself.

Regent's Park became a habit. Sherlock wasn't sure if the soldier even realized it himself.
“Oh! Yes - 'course - right!” The lilt in his voice betraying some of his nervousness, he continued, “John Watson speaking -” and stopped the rest of that statement from coming out, ‘Captain, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers’...

“Of course it did, dear. John’s a romantic. And you barged in like a bull in a china shop, didn’t you? Not thinking of what it would do to him. Poor dear,” Sherlock’s eyes opened wide. He had thought John would be happy to see him. Elated even?

Nat picked up the tea cautiously, and sipped to taste ... grimacing at the results.
John grabbed a bottle from a crate that was moving past him and opened it up. Downing more than necessary in a few desperate gulps as he decided to sneak off and get a bit of fresh air wherever he could steal it.
And John realized then, how much it meant to him ...
Sherlock Holmes.
Sorry!!!!
once again, I've lost the literature reference for this page
Sherlock seemed to contemplate this ... within the parameters of John's previous statements - dinner for two, going out with each other to have fun ...? They did that every night before the fall ... Sherlock's brain was taking up too much time and not allowing him enough focus on kissing. So John made it stop.
Here he was.

This morning, when John came in to view, Sherlock saw a noticeable shift in his demeanor. Like the soldier had at last made a tough decision ...
John wondered at his humility ...

John glanced back over his shoulder, having caught that last bit - and asking with some curiosity, “Strange?” He did not expect an answer. And did not get one.
Sherlock dropped his gaze to watch John's hands then.

He could hardly feel. Let alone think.
Listening to the squeaks and sounds, creaks and groans, of a building older than his grandma. For some reason, a Cake song popped into his head, ‘It’s been a Long Time’ and he began humming out the tune as he stared at the starry, painted ceiling. The full moon coming in through the window and staring at him.
But knowledge?
The other corner of John's mouth lifted at the sight.
He had gotten his hopes up over something so foolish. And here he was.

John tiptoed up the last few creaking wooden steps to find himself in a dormered room. The window looking out over London.
A waiter came by.
"I ... I haven't," Sherlock tried.
John exhaled the remaining energy he had built up. The adrenaline coursing through him from the danger, now averted. Thrumming through his veins. The icy air highlighting the steam from his breath. Hot and cold in juxtaposition. Making him shiver.

Listening this time,
Cheering him on with reckless abandon … ?
But it was done.
He queued up at the rear of the party, feeling like an afterthought. His eyes glancing about the brightly lit dining hall that he could see in glimpses. A strong gust of frozen air hit him and he shivered. The group no longer blocking its path ahead of him.
Sherlock appeared unharmed in his vision a moment later, when the woman was down. He hadn't realized that he had closed his eyes when taking the shot. And then he caught another look at Sherlock's face. Still fixed. On him.
Be honest.
He stopped himself. Still unable to say it. Still unwanted. This knowledge that what he would have to say eventually, was in and of itself ...   unbearable.
He had just come back from the dead after all ...

And then ... MIke had thrown a rock, and sent a ripple through time.
He looked at that same nose now.
John picked through the shelves and checked the racks, the yellow-green light in the shop making it hard to read the labels. His eyes finally landing on a familiar cord with relief … His thoughts, however, kept circling back around every two seconds as he paid and looked out the narrow door to where Sherlock was still waiting for him  …
His face down. Talking into his tea cup.
That’s why he had proposed - or rather - had planned to propose. Mary had beaten him to it.

It didn't much matter.

John’s breath caught in his throat. He swallowed. His heart was racing. This near. This close. This space, so private. This room, so dark.
The man gave one more glance towards Sherlock -
Piss off.
His friends warned him to take it slow. Be cautious. And so he did. Maybe a little too slow ...
"No," John gave in, "Mrs. Hudson. I would love a spot of tea ..."

“I’ve sprained it,” John muttered, under his breath, “more mercy than you bloody well deserve!

‘Give my love to the Chef’, was inspired by a weekend of ‘Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares’ with my friend Jill. Gordon Ramsey reminded me so much of Sherlock, with his singular focus, and his kind heart (at least in the American version) - I really didn’t get how anyone could think he was mean. The poor man can’t even look at the camera when he talks … adorable! But somehow, I still get ignorant people commenting on how mean the show is. And the same with Sherlock - what a sociopath Sherlock is - or how RUDE he is?? and I … I just think … ‘you see, but do not observe’.
John quickly dug the charger out of his pocket, holding the blunt end of it up to the man’s back, like the end of a gun barrel - and turned the bully to face his companion, now getting up from the ground, rubbing his elbow.

Nat seemed to catch his tension then, humming a gruff agreement, and cast her eyes down for a moment to join him in the silence. Like she understood the sentiment, but not the subject matter ...
That end of case
Life was becoming a monotone gray, and John was only going through the motions. In the year since Sherlock had died, the edges had slowly become blurry, frayed. A stitched up pattern. Now with gaping holes wherever the swathes of life had been ripped out. Spaces that once had contained Sherlock Holmes in them.

Sherlock’s fingers brushed over the pads of John’s index and thumb. They continued down and traced each of the lifelines in his palm, like a fortune teller … and then … they slipped between John’s fingers to his surprise, interlocking their hands tightly. He held them there, for a moment. Looking away to collect himself.

A chance to go. And not involve himself in Sherlock’s hairbrained ideas -
Sherlock did not know where to place his hands. He fought internally with several options, before John took them and placed them where he wanted them, himself. One on his neck, and the other on his lower-mid back. He followed it up with the sweetest words Sherlock had ever heard spoken aloud,
The ping was almost instantaneous:

She had been receiving texts and updates regularly during her visits. They interrupted at the oddest hours. Not unlike Lestrade used to. Mostly calls from someone named Sam.
Sherlock had not made another appearance during the whole half hour he sat eating, watching, eating, and thinking. It was odd really. Because, if asked - his thoughts had been turning around again and again - to Sherlock. They always did. He felt homesick. He felt nostalgic. He felt happy. For the first time in ...  ever. He knew it wouldn't last. It was a fleeting feeling. Something to cross his palate and be enjoyed, before he had to once again swallow the pain.

But he stopped.
There was no room for halves.
He could not do it.
Sherlock added all of these things up, and did not like the tally ...
She let go like one would of a feral cat, and bounced back away to the other side of the little table, picking up his teacup from where it sat now empty, and going to refill it.
Sherlock debated his response though.
She also seemed to be sharing in the same pain that John was suffering from. And half the time she wandered into her - what he was calling ‘mind palace’ sessions - he was sure she was thinking of something else entirely.

John gaped at the intruder. Then he collected himself, a little miffed at

The gondola at last pulled up to the hotel, and docked. Depositing them on the doorstep of a much finer establishment then John had been privy to. John was staring up at it in awe, taking Sherlock’s hand to disembark.
“You always wanted to have sex with me, in my jumper?” John asked the question quite innocently.
In many of these cases, it was a filmed reveal …
"OK! Alright!!" John threw his hands up.
"John!" Mrs. Hudson came bustling around the corner to his surprise. He stepped up his pace to pass her quickly.

Sherlock shifted, sounding concerned. His hand reached out and smoothly started rubbing up and down John’s arm, to calm him. John covered his mouth with his hand and tried to stifle the remaining outburst. But of course ... no one ever could ...

John came back up the stairs after all was quiet. Silently refilling the kettle and putting it on to boil. As Sherlock stood by the window. His hand on the pane. Watching the world continue to bustle and move down below.
But most of all, it hurt that Sherlock
“Admit it,” John said, suavely, when he had composed himself, “you missed these jumpers.”
He stormed up behind the one with a hold on Sherlock’s jacket and twisted his arm behind him - pinning it up between his shoulder blades until he heard a satisfying squeak out of the burly man - in response. He was nearly twice John's size - his mind was registering.

They stood there for a few moments. Just looking each other over.
He was to be disappointed.
Clearly he had just put the man off, and he was now pitying him.
He could use hope right now.
John smiled.
Their choice had been made. And it was awful. Heartless and cruel.
He was avoiding Mike's gaze as he did so. His second, no doubt incredulous expression, at another politeness out of Sherlock's mouth?

Sherlock signaled for silence and climbed up one more set of stairs to an attic. Something that would have been used by servants, back in the day …

John reached out for his mobile,

It was Sherlock’s turn to look embarrassed, and John found him staring at their shoes, as he tried to apologize, “which is fine! By the way! Probably gets better reception than these … stupid …” he fumbled with putting away his own paperweight device, and thanked Sherlock by nodding a “ta.” John looked up at Sherlock. Reality meeting his gaze …

Still no luck.
Mike was looking at Sherlock closely. Watching as the telltale signs of his 'sociopath' façade slipped briefly below the radar, and he was staring at a young boy behind the eyes. It was somewhat disorienting ...
He stepped up and offered his hand in greeting this time. Only regretting that he had not taken his glove off first to do so ...
They all laughed and continued on as if John had not interrupted. Bustling about. Cleaning up the mess. Cooking.

“You have a lot of explaining to do, mister!” he chided, but his eyes were full of banter.
His eyes stayed glued on his feet, following the shoes of the server before him. He did not want to look up. So much for people watching. He was getting an eyeful as it was.
She was gone.

It was his wedding day.
It really isn't.
“Fine,” the man stated the obvious, while circling John with an air of appraisal …
He sighed. What the jury wouldn't be presented with, and frankly wouldn't believe - he hardly believed it himself - was that he had had no choice in the matter.
He had realized then,
John could die from embarrassment. He could. He could just die.
Afterwards.
Sherlock respected it this time.
“Hello?”
He amplifies the good in you. The better pieces of you. Like a stereo.
Sherlock wasn't sure how to read sarcasm, but he wasn't entirely sure if this was sarcasm? He decided to take it at face value, "Problem?" he asked. Genuinely concerned, but again, trying not to show it.

The evening wore on.
Sherlock was pacing the room.
John steeled himself to hear something truly terrible. He nodded. Indicating that he was ready.
Sherlock was asking, awkwardly. Indicating the unused device still sitting in John’s upturned hand. John shook himself from his thoughts.
But his eyes betrayed the tears they mirrored in her own. And shared in her pain.
His hands were shaking as he put the pills back into the bottle.
He felt the waiter hovering by his side and was about to ask about something on the menu when a plate slid under his nose.
Watson hadn't known then...

It appeared that they were tracking someone named Clint.
He wondered how old the building really was?

John could hear in his head. But he did not see the fake Sherlock again …   Maybe just knowing the real one was out there now, would help him to move on.

“We’re not a happy couple, Mary!” John had finally ended the barrage by stating.
He was absolutely breathless. And thrumming with energy.
John tried not to allow himself to succumb. He had to remain strong. He had to be the wall the waves broke upon for Sherlock. He would hurt. He would burn. If that is what Moriarty wanted out of this game he had set for them.

It was a sunny day in London …
John opened his eyes a moment later. Re-adjusting to where Sherlock had moved to … closing the gap further, and once again, drinking him in.
He sat down beside John on the makeshift bed. Twisting the duvet up further as he did so.
Sherlock was protesting, politely … “I don’t have any cash … gentlemen …” As the larger man pushed, prodding Sherlock’s pockets, groping him for a wallet or valuables … and John heard a grunt sound from Sherlock’s mouth.
John was blushing now. Realizing that Sherlock
John tried to let it slide. Let it not bore a thought into his mind, where he knew he’d never rid himself of it.

Sherlock hummed in agreement.

John shook his head. "You were brilliant, Sherlock." He stated to the cold, dark stone before him.
The voice in his head was vicious, spiteful ...
"Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you," Sherlock stepped forward to accept it abruptly as she walked up. Hoping she would then turn around. Seeing as how strangers were present, and Molly was a bit shy.

His mind far away. Not comprehending. Not registering any of her words.

John’s mind drifted back to Baker Street. The days with Sherlock. The montage of their collected life together, playing like a record - an enviable history - of brilliant deductions; flouncing in dressing gowns; italian shoes climbing over furniture with complete disregard; iodine stained fingers; steeped black tea; blue eyes in mirrors; hands steepled carefully beneath chin; crackling wood fires; takeaway cartons; manila files; the ping of a text … sad music; rosin and bows; symphonies conducted at midnight to a crowd of one; and always sad. Lovely. Lonely. Music ...

But no, Sherlock would never read that one. Because that one was all imagination. And Sherlock was a man of facts and figures. Not love and lust. John smiled at that thought.

He followed her and lifted her bags easily in his hands. Carrying them for her back into the flat. The stairway stretched above him. Green. Wallpaper. That hideous glass multicolor light. Down here, the mirror. Fogged glass doors. The coat hooks ...

A look of infinite confusion crosses his features momentarily - as he struggles with what to say in response. He pulls himself away abruptly.

A warm towel and ... of all things ... a shave.
"What do you suggest, Mrs. Hudson?" Sherlock had dutifully finished his soup,
He surfaced once or twice to check the phone line. Dead.
The loneliest place to be, when you're alone, is in the middle of a busy city that doesn't know who you are. Or care.
Hailing a cab had not been possible at this hour, and Sherlock rejected the waiting black vehicle that stood to receive him just outside of front doors ...
His eye automatically strayed from the other tables to the center of his own … There was a candle. His eye fixated on it for a moment. Almost wanting to reach out and ...
That was reality.
His eyes trailing to the cupid's bow that begged to be tasted and nudged
And a band of demons joined on cue,
“John?”
Not that it meant they had to do anything. But talk.

, will take the Linguine allo Scoglio  … and some capers with that please?” He gave the waiter a glance and a quick smile in thanks. He did not look up at Sherlock who was -
If he thought Sherlock was impressive before - this had seemed like a giant LEAP of superhuman strength!
He should come back some time. Good food. Pleasant atmosphere. Ask for a deep corner booth next time. Feel less conspicuous. Yes. He might. This was good. Getting himself out of the house. It was good. He would come back.
Not even a goodbye.
, he supposed ...
Sherlock admonished.
John overheard? How much would John welcome?
That’s all he ever wants from you.
She was happy enough for the both of them.
John licked them instinctively.
A glass of ice water and a drink menu had appeared in his absence. Along with a set of cutlery.
This wasn’t a healthy relationship.
With all kinds of love …
The bombshell hitting him with a much damage as it could. His life hanging in the balance. His future ...
She interrupted his thoughts. The warmth of her rose scented perfume tingling in his nose, “When he comes back, can we make it a rule in this house? To go ask your Doctor first?” She tousled his hair like he was her little boy, and squeezed him again for good measure. Giving him a peck on the cheek.
He let it roll on the back of his tongue. Tasted it in his mouth.
John nodded.
Sherlock’s voice now in his head.
John hurried to reassure him, “never risking a price you
So this was the man he had just travelled a thousand miles to meet …?
John smiled into his mouth. Huffing a laugh that filled Sherlock’s throat with John’s sweet breath. Sherlock kissed the smile and drank in his breath. He wanted to be filled with it, John gasped at the desire that action had caused, stopping the kisses just to catch his breath! Ha. “You are a madman. What? Why? Take me on a date? How many have we been on already?"
Sherlock’s face must have betrayed the horrible memory of his reveal.

Is that why
He was wrapped in a soft terrycloth robe, a plain white tee and worn plaid flannels underneath. The absolute picture of comfort. Sherlock wanted to nuzzle into him.

He tried to sound simply curious, and not as shaken as he felt.

“Show me?” John asked.
But really it was out of cowardice.
Sherlock quickly looped around the other way,

whispering:

John had held out hope until that moment.

Sherlock's eyes were green. Just a hint of blue. And there was a touch of yellow in the center.
He wanted a chance to see
When Nat’s head fell back and he heard her release her pent up frustration in a cry instead of a shout or smash of china, as he would have expected to see from Harry or his own mum … his concerned doctor side kicked in ...
"I'll make sure to get his attention and keep it. Get him talking ..." Mike replied, somewhat in awe of the expression on Sherlock's face, as the mask slipped back on, and careful calculations began anew, " ... what then?"
He watched John's reaction carefully, noticing how John's eyes now trailed after Molly ...
He already knew that John was made of sterner stuff, didn't he?
He would be the greater fool, if he did not risk it.
what goes on in that funny little head of yours ..."
Sherlock had abandoned her too.
He would have collapsed right then and there, had Sherlock not caught his elbow and helped him to sit down back on the pile of blankets that was serving as mattress.
But … It sounded like?
“I think you both have things to say,” she stood now, taking away their teacups with her and placing them in the sink. But instead of ushering them out, she herself went, tucking the door shut behind her.
Yes, I suppose I had help there,” Sherlock was turning a little red himself, and staring at the sky, “you …
Well, that
The devastation.
Just then, John heard the kettle beep announcing tea water was ready behind him, and he slapped at it with his hand to silence it, so that he could maintain eye contact with Sherlock.
He trusted Sherlock. Inside and out.

Sherlock could practically hear his thoughts. And the pain they were causing.
John's eyes were scanning the ground, then looking back up to the sky. Looking towards where Sherlock had gone missing. Where he had stepped off of that cursed roof, and sealed his fate.
He had just kept the checkout list to himself.
He should really have just packed himself a nice long white jacket  … and booked a padded cell instead of a hotel room ...!

holding his breath. It made him smile again. Sherlock could be so childish sometimes.
He had half a mind to take the cases on himself -
Anderson. Sally. Their vapid warnings. Instead of turning John away from him, they seemed to have been setting fuel to the fire that was burning between them. It had lit something against bullies in John. Protective. Fierce.

It almost made John
Sherlock was breathing half in through his mouth, and half out through his nose. Trying to steady his breaths. Striving for normality. John saw his nostrils flare a few times as he worked to tamp it down. His eye wandered to Sherlock's jawline, the curve of his delicate ear. Sherlock's hair was darker than John had remembered it ...  almost raven. Dark and ... with hints of auburn in it.
...   will wonders never cease?!
Apparently, the Chef also did not trust that he was going to keep calm and not cause a scene?
He had rather hoped for the anonymity of the crowded space of a water taxi. Public transport. Mortified that he had already shown his weakness to this man TWICE.
-- <> --
John had accepted that the work came first ...
Would he, as a detective, have been able to separate the two interwoven timelines at all? He looked with new eyes at
He took Sherlock’s hand. A question written between his eyebrows. Not one he was sure he was ready to ask …
Moran looked furious for a split second before bursting into another fit of grating laughter, “And what exactly are you planning to do? You’re surrounded and outnumbered. There is no way for the two of you to get out of here by yourselves and by the time big brother can rally the troops, we’ll be long gone. Once again, he will be too late to swoop in and save you.”
He narrowed his eyes suspiciously at me, a tiny smirk on his lips, “Very well…”
“I’ve been thinking this morning and…” I stopped. Could I really just tell Mrs Hudson?
“Are you sure you want to have a shower? You don’t look very steady at the moment,” I said, concerned as I helped him shuffle towards the bathroom.
Harry chuckled, but she spoke softly, "It's not, though. Sometimes you think you're in love but you don't realise what love actually is until you meet the right person..."
“Careful John!” Sherlock exclaimed, reaching towards me as I shuffled towards the back of the ambulance, waving the paramedics away.
I cocked my head to one side curiously, “Like what?”
Sherlock looked at me with faux innocence, “I was thinking that we could go and have a late dinner then go and catch the culprits of this peculiar case.”
Then I grabbed him by the collar and punched him again. And again. And again. I felt hot blood spurt under my fists, I felt the satisfying crunch of bone as I pummeled the ever-loving shit out of that smug, disgusting face.
I decided to go all the way and take off my boxers, sliding them down to join my trousers, cold air hitting my hot member. I watched Sherlock as he let out a shaky breath, eyes glued to my groin. Trailing my hand down through the rough hair to rest at the base, I began to thrust into my fist.
Greg moved forwards with purpose to seize it, the other Holmes however stayed back hesitantly, blackberry clutched loosely in his hand. I wanted to comfort him, tell him his brother was not going to be ruined by this piece of shit of a man, but I was only just able to tell myself that, let alone voice it aloud.
There have been numerous incidents like this over the last few weeks, Sherlock would drop things from his hands shaking too much, his eyes would glaze over and he would become distant for fractions of a second before coming back to reality, or play his violin much sloppier than normal, small things that most people wouldn't notice; but I did.
Sherlock looked at me wearily, “I suppose, if you must.”
“Don’t worry?” I interrupted incredulously. “Don’t worry?! How dare you tell me not to worry! My best friend, whom I thought was dead, was alive the whole time and in your care and you didn’t even think to tell me?!”
I bit the inside of my cheek to stop myself sobbing. I blinked viciously, I wasn’t going to let Sherlock see me cry, not when he needed me to be strong. So I buried my face in his hair and whispered, “Don’t say that, Sherlock. Please, just don’t…”
I sat by him, continuously rubbing his back and making soothing sounds. Once he had stopped retching, Lestrade gave him a bottle of water and he drank it gratefully but soon after this, Sherlock was fully back with us.
She looked up at me, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, “Yes dear?
“Thanks, love. And yes, it definitely is sore,” I said as I tried to carefully sit up and mirror Sherlock’s position, causing the stitches in my leg to twinge. “How did you know I was going to be awake soon?”
Then Sherlock was the one kneeling over me, clutching at my shoulders and yelling at the top of his lungs, “We need help over here! He’s been shot! Somebody! Get over here now!”
“Sherlock?” I asked cautiously. No reply. I went and stood in front of him, saying his name again.
Approaching Sherlock and touching him would be a dangerous move as the consulting detective was completely engrossed in his music and would be threatened in his currently vulnerable state. I decided knocking was the safest bet.
I nodded appreciatively at him as he took his leave. I smiled at Sherlock before bustling about to make breakfast for us both.
His clothes were getting too big for him and I am sure he has been suffering from malnutrition for a very long time. I even caught him smoking again, which was another indication that this was extremely serious and was obviously not getting any better. In fact, if anything, he was getting worse.
I blinked, once again flabbergasted into silence. I opened and closed my mouth a few times but no sound came out. I’m sure I looked ridiculously like a goldfish as I sat there struggling to find an answer to such a startling comment.
Mycroft cleared his throat slightly and adjusted his tie, “If we do this, I will use every resource at my disposal to ensure his safety…”
We watched Sherlock play in silence until he finished. He then turned to us looking more composed and placed his violin down before asking, “Is there anything else you need Detective Inspector?”
Then I spotted something I had missed before. On his left side, just above his hipbone, there was a large burn mark; it was in the shape of a circle with an ‘M’ inside it. I could guess what the ‘m’ stood for. Around the burn, there were also small scars, but these didn’t look like a knife, more like finger nails…
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no…”
“You noticed something?” Sherlock interrupted, incredulous. The rude remark sent my eyebrows right up to my hairline and I couldn’t help smiling. It seemed that through sheer stubbornness Sherlock had found a way back to some of his old habits.
Mycroft shifted uncomfortably, averting his eyes back to his phone. Sherlock also looked slightly awkward about the insinuation of Mycroft’s brotherly affection clouding his judgement, but he cleared his throat and gestured for Greg to continue.
This coupled with the fact that I put up with all his ridiculous experiments, spend almost all of my time in his presence (even if he doesn’t realise that I’m even there), constantly monitor wether he has eaten or slept, remind him to do so if he has neglected such necessities and always, without fail, drop everything to follow him into whatever danger and life threatening situations the criminal element have to throw at us, left me to conclude from my morning ponderings that I was completely, and probably stupidly, besotted with Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock’s eyes had a hint of fear in them, but there was also steely determination in their blue green depths. He exhaled with a shaky breath but nodded forcefully. He got out of bed slowly and started to get dressed deliberately, moving almost like a soldier donning his armour in preparation for battle. I left Sherlock to steady himself and went out to greet Mycroft and Greg in the sitting room, where I found the former tapping his umbrella impatiently on the floor and the latter pacing up and down with his hands on his hips.
I was so shocked that I was completely speechless. Sherlock grabbed my other hand and wrapped it vigorously around the back of his own neck, before pulling it to run down his side, making him shiver, all the while still rocking into the hand that he held at his crotch.
She giggled as I buried my face in my hands in a vain attempt to hide my blush, “Oh my god, please stop saying 'parts'!”
“Well, I noticed things were different between us since he got back, and when I started helping him get better… But nothing actually happened until a week or so ago. I wasn't going to take advantage of him or anything while he was so sick,” I replied, taking a nervous sip of my tea.
I was brought back to reality as Sherlock finished his soup and pushed his bowl away. He had a bit more colour in his cheeks now so as I cleaned up, I decided to call Harry later and arrange to meet up with her.
“Well,” I began awkwardly, "It's really no different than with bees, I guess. It's like, when someone just makes perfect sense to you, and when you look at them they just... feel right."
She bustled off, closing the door behind her. I laughed and grazed my teeth lazily against his flesh, breathing hot puffs of air onto him so that goose bumps rose on his skin. When neither Sherlock nor I moved, I said noncommittally, “We really should go speak to Lestrade.”
I tilted my head to the side; he was right of course but I then realised that I didn’t really mind. I opened the door nonetheless.
Sherlock smiled smugly, “Oh, I know!”
“But you won’t find anything!” Mycroft exclaimed suddenly, all pretence of composure gone. “Why do you think Sherlock spent so much time in captivity, hm? I wasn’t just twiddling my thumbs for ten months! I. Couldn’t. Find him! Moran left no trace and if my people couldn’t do it then Scotland Yard’s finest certainly won’t be able to.”
I shook my head and sighed, resting my elbow on the mantle, “I just wish he would tell me what’s going on… I’m worried about him.”
Sherlock came over to the couch and sat down next to me, placing his hands on my shoulder and rubbing gently. I hummed in pleasure as he expertly worked at the stiffness in the old wound. I hissed when he pressed too hard in the wrong place, earning a mumbled apology in my ear. I shrugged my shoulders and turned to face Sherlock.
I shrugged, “I dunno. They just do. I suppose it’s a thing to be close to each other but subtly.”
I moaned at the sweet friction, watching Sherlock as his lips parted slightly and his pupils dilated. I smiled to myself, I had thought our first sexual experience would be awkward and weird because of my uncertainty towards my newfound sexuality and Sherlock’s lack of experience. But now in this moment, I didn’t feel weird or uncomfortable. I felt content, at peace and helplessly turned on by Sherlock watching me.
“You’re leaving?” Sherlock asked desperately, eyes wide.
“Don’t be sorry,” I cupped his face in my hands and pressed a tender kiss to his clammy forehead, “We both got really worked up there!”
I heard Sherlock entering the kitchen with slow and controlled steps, but I kept my gaze on the two men in front of me, “Why? What’s the situation?”
We listened with bated breath to the voices echoing up the stairwell; it was Mrs. Hudson sounding slightly panicked, accompanied by the gruff voice of Lestrade and the smoother tones of Mycroft Holmes.
“Sherlock,” I said, putting my cup down and leaning forwards, “your hands are shaking.”
His hands were shaking, I covered them with one of mine, snaking the other into his hair and tugging slightly, “Shhh… its okay.”
I was also trying to come to terms with my own feelings towards the man, the key word for me being 'man'. When I first met Sherlock I had noticed that he was indeed very handsome, but that’s the only way I’ve ever seen any man. I’ve appreciated their looks, possibly even envied them, but never been attracted to them… unless that's just what I have always told myself...
“How much did you hear when you followed me to see her after we thought she was dead?”
“What would you have me do then? Just leave it be until Moran barges straight in here?” Greg fired back.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Mycroft, taking in his rattled exterior. Sherlock’s brows drew together, “The photograph? You found something.”
Greg looked doubtful as he watched Sherlock intently, who shrunk back in shame further into the corner of the room, hiding behind his mug of tea. I stepped between the two men, “It’s alright Greg, he’s going really well and things like this are to be expected.”
I turned back to him in surprise to find him gazing at me with a bold looks in his eyes, “What doesn’t count?”
“I said that later on in the evening we are going to go out and wrap up this case,” Sherlock said louder.
When Sherlock’s shoulders rounded as he retreated back into the shell he still clings to and sipped his tea quietly, I could see he wasn’t going to answer. So I said, “It was just a small relapse, nothing to be worried about.”
I nodded, "Okay, I'll just tell him that you're dealing with PTSD symptoms after being held captive. Is that okay?"
As he was speaking, I had started shaking my head and approaching him slowly, “No, Sherlock, don’t ever say that to me alright?”
“No, no, no… leave me alone… no…” he muttered, covering his head with one arm.
I didn’t say anything, I just sat there, waiting for him to deduce that I wasn’t leaving until I had the truth. He looked me over and sighed, running a hand through his midnight curls.
Thankfully I had restrained my, well, urges for lack of a better word, whilst giving Sherlock his first mind-blowing kiss, but now I was starting to worry that I would ask too much of him. The idea that my need for him would push us into something neither of us were ready for, and risking pushing him away, was making me nauseous.
Mycroft took a step back and straightened his waistcoat, feigning indifference despite the emotion written on his face, “You’re welcome. Now go home and get some rest. I’ll handle everything and be in touch soon.”
Mycroft took a menacing step forwards, mouth drawn into a firm line, eyes blazing at the sight of his little brother, "We hunt him down, that's what. And then we eliminate this piece of filth that is plaguing the world."
I nodded, not turning to look at him, “What happened? In the nightmare, I mean.”
“I can’t explain it here but I’ll tell you once we’re done,” I said just as quietly.
He looked a little more relaxed with company so I left him and went to greet my sister. She looked worried but only for a second because her face lit up when she saw me.
Mrs Hudson smiled at me one last time before raising me up off my chair and pushing me towards the stairs.
‘Hello, my pet. It’s lovely to hear from you! I hope you and your little doctor friend are well. How nice of him to clean you up, just for me… like a fresh canvas waiting for the touch of an artist.’
After Sherlock had dressed himself (quite slowly), I went back into his room and looked him over once again. He still looked pale and shaky but at least he was clothed which was a relief to me. I placed my palm against his forehead and asked him how he felt.
Supportive fluff! My favourite! As always, thanks for reading and liking and commenting!
I chuckled and we sat snuggled together in comfortable silence for a while until Sherlock sat up, looking down at where his hand was rubbing my shoulder, “John, I’ve been thinking…”
I nodded, returning his smile, closing the door behind me as I was greeted inside by Mr Wilson’s alarmingly bright red hair and Sherlock sitting with steepled fingers across from him. I sat down in the empty chair next to him and waited for Sherlock to begin.
He was hesitant in answering but he seemed to recognise me so he eventually said, “I couldn’t see anything, it was dark, I was back there… and then I was on the floor… Why is everything fuzzy and spinning?”
Moran smirked at me as I approached. My vision narrowed and I saw red. There was so much I wanted to do to that scum. I wanted to rip him limb from limb for everything he did to Sherlock and scream at him until I was hoarse but, in that moment, my hands clenched into fists and my body acted almost without conscious thought. Moran opened his mouth to sneer something in my face as I stopped in front of him, but before he had the chance, I punched him squarely in the face, harder than I had punched anyone in my life.
He took my hands and looked down at where he was holding them, “All of it.”
He sighed, “Can I ask my doctor if I could do something else instead?”
Sherlock squeezed back and smiled tightly at me. I turned back to the living room and drew my shoulders back as I regarded Mycroft.
'I’ve found you my pet. And I will be coming to reclaim what is mine. Never fear my darling, the party is only just beginning… M'
An hour later, I was researching treatments for PTSD sufferers when my phone buzzed. I answered it to find Greg on the other end.
Sherlock groaned, “Ugh, I still feel sick…”
“Thank-you, Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock growled, throwing his pillow towards the door. “Tell Lestrade we’ll be out in a minute.”
His voice was strained and I could tell that he was trying to convince himself as much as me that he was fine. I closed the door but stayed outside for a little longer and I could hear his deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself down.
I licked the corner of his mouth before Sherlock turned and mashed his lips against mine in a downright filthy snog. My trousers had become uncomfortably tight, my hardness pressing against Sherlock’s back. He tried to encourage my hand further down from his abdomen but I pulled away from his mouth, halting our hands.
“My pleasure!”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to loose it like that. I didn’t want you to know... I didn’t want you to see any of this…”
“Listen, uh, I’m going to go downstairs to Speedy’s for lunch. I’m meeting my sister there…”
He approached the side of the bed slowly and stood in front of me, hands behind his back and looking at me earnestly. Still, he said nothing.
Sherlock took a few steps back, head down, “I-I’m sorry John, I didn’t mean to upset you…”
Hello my lovely readers! Smutty smut for you today ;)
His eyes glazed over as if he was remembering something and then his hands started to shake. His breathing became rapid and irregular, sweat was forming on his brow and his face paled. I instantly knew what was happening to him because the same thing had happened to me after Afghanistan; he was having a flashback.
I reached down to still his hands where they were fiddling with the soiled bandage, “I understand. How about you go and wash up while I get this leg ready for my own shower. I need to cover the stitches up, so they don’t get wet.”
I smiled to myself; Sherlock had reverted to form slightly then.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock growled back, frustrated, “and you’re late. Are the rest of your force on stand-by?”
Sherlock stirred behind me and replace my hand with his own before licking the stripe of his own come off my chin and tasting himself. He kissed me mercilessly on the lips, tongue diving into my mouth and fucking it in time with his strokes, under these ministrations I didn’t last long and was coming all over Sherlock’s pale hand.
“No problem mate,” Greg said, as he pulled a slightly awkward Sherlock in for a hug as well.
I nodded, turning to Sherlock, "You hear that love? We're going to hunt down Sebastian Moran, and when we find him, I'm going to put a bullet between his eyes."
“You feel right.”
“Moran,” I whispered gently. I got to my feet and took his hand, leading him gently to the edge of the bed, “I’m sorry that’s been your only experience. But I’m going to change that.”
“I know, I know it’s just… overwhelming…” Sherlock said quietly, wiping desperately at his eyes as if the tears shamed him, “I’m sorry, that was amazing, you were amazing, I just… I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
Sherlock gestured towards his body and all the scars that riddled his skin.
“I know,” he interrupted, eyes darting around my face, “and I appreciate that very much. But that’s exactly why I want to say it properly this time. It sort of just slipped out before, and I want you to understand that I really do mean it.”
“Jesus… I knew something was wrong but… What are you gonna do?”
In an attempt to calm my nerves, I brushed my teeth and performed all other pre-sleep necessities slowly before making my way back to Sherlock’s door. I knocked hesitantly and upon hearing Sherlock’s bid for me to enter, took a breath and went in.
I trailed off as Sherlock continued to smile to himself, “I’ll shout if I need you,” he said.
“Are you sure the chains were what made him do that?” Greg asked when we were back in his office at Scotland Yard the next morning.
“I’ll get some squad cars outside and I’m sure you can get some snipers in neighbouring buildings?” Greg said, turning to Mycroft, who nodded at the suggestion. “Don’t worry, you’ll all be safe, I promise.”
It’s been a month or two since Sherlock came back from the dead. He explained to me that he had had to hunt down the rest of Moriarty’s followers so he had to go into hiding but I knew he was hiding something else from me.
Sherlock nodded back at me gravely, turning to grab a washcloth and dry off his face. He regarded his own reflection in the mirror and narrowed his eyes, coming to some sort of decision. He turned back to me and approached.
Now that Sherlock was starting to feel better, I had been giving him problems to solve so he wouldn’t go stir crazy. I filtered the cases on our websites and gave him small ones to solve, always feeling joyous when his eyes lit up upon hearing of a new problem to set his mind to, no matter how trivial.
“John? I want to do more, with you I mean,” Sherlock said quietly. “I don’t really understand it but I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach, like a twisting feeling whenever I see you. It’s exciting, but frightening at the same time. It’s like, I get excited whenever you’re around but scared because of… well everything really.”
When he didn’t answer, I perched on the arm of his chair and looked over his shoulder at the screen of his laptop. The message board of his website was open and there was a new message at the top.
Sherlock smiled, moving close enough to whisper to me, “I’m thinking how beautiful you are.”
“Sherlock? Look at me,” I said, placing a hand on his knee.
I shook my head; of course she’d want to know details. I sent one back, saying it was amazing but that my physical wants were scaring me a little. She replied almost immediately:
Lestrade flashed his badge and we headed down to the bank’s vaults…
I squeezed his hands, “When I said ‘I’m not gay’ and she said, ‘Well I am. Look at us both.’ She said we were a couple even then and I denied it, because I wasn’t ready to see it like that. But after that conversation, I realised how much I loved you, but I was too scared to say anything.”
“John?” Sherlock said again, cupping my face so that I was looking into his eyes. He looked so worried and I felt terrible for putting that expression on his face.
“Well, we sent word to Mycroft’s computer people to get them looking at the new messages, but I figured that Moran would be too careful to leave any traces there…”
He started to shake his head again, “No, you don’t understand. I can’t, not again… don’t let him hurt me John, please… oh god, John please…”
“Can you play it for me?” I asked gently.
Sherlock sat up fully, pulling me onto his lap, making me moan as our cocks rubbed together, “That’s precisely why you’re perfect, idiot…”
Sherlock’s eyes were still locked on his brother, urging him to postpone the strike, “Yes, but if we use these ten minutes to prepare and think this through, Moran won’t get away. Not again.”
I exhaled a shaky breath and caressed one of his ridiculous cheekbones with my thumb. I had registered him saying the ‘L’ word earlier, but I hadn’t allowed myself to really take it in with all that was going on. But now, it felt as though we were in a precious bubble of calm amongst the horrific storm raging just two rooms away. I gazed into Sherlock’s blue grey eyes, and he stared back at me deliberately.
Sherlock looked frightened as we sat down together, “But, I don’t know how. Well, I know in theory but… Moran… I don’t know John…”
He looked at me, “Hmm?”
Sherlock looked at me for a moment, his face blank, before averting his eyes and staring at the covers on his bed. I decided that a different tactic was in order; I got up and walked cautiously round to where Sherlock was sitting and perched on the side of the bed in front of him.
I rolled my eyes and asked him if he wanted anything but was promptly ignored, so I took my tea and slouched into my arm chair. There was a hush over the flat, making me concerned about Sherlock’s feelings regarding what they had done earlier. But, as I thought more about it, this was often the state of the flat and Sherlock often ignored me completely.
“That’s a lot of money just for some typing,” I mused.
One second everything had been normal then suddenly he and Sherlock were snogging on our couch! Me and Sherlock Holmes had been snogging. I could barely fathom it was real. I shot a quick text off to Harry, telling her what had happened and although I was incredibly happy, I was also more than mildly terrified.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, clearly preoccupied with whatever thoughts were buzzing around his head. I smiled at him thinly, and he exhaled a shuddering breath before crossing to the couch and perching on the edge of the cushion beside me. I felt like I wanted to comfort him, but also that I needed to be comforted in turn. I couldn’t find the right words to say, what even was there to say under the circumstances? Sherlock took my hands and smiled back at me, as though he saw what I was thinking but couldn’t verbalise anything either.
“Okay, shut it you! And why are you drinking my tea? Why didn’t you just make two cups?”
“Did you open the door for me because you were being a gentleman or because you wanted to catch a glimpse of my arse?” I asked suspiciously.
It broke my heart to see him like this, but at the same time I knew it was necessary for Sherlock to tell me what happened and how he was feeling so I could help him get better. It killed me to even think it, but I had to break down his walls before I could begin build him back up.
I reached for the arm that Sherlock offered me. Carefully, he helped ease me down out of the ambulance. I wrapped an arm around his waist for support and gave him a quick squeeze of reassurance. Sherlock smiled down at me thinly, relief and affection shining in his eyes. I smiled back at him as I began to limp over to Moran, my leg throbbing dully.
We sat like this for a little while, until suddenly Sherlock shut the lid of his laptop with a snap and a growl at it before turning on his side in a huff, bringing his knees up and curling into a ball. I closed my book and looked at him; I assumed he hadn’t found the answers he was looking for.
I sat up, “Sherlock? Are you okay?”
“I won’t be long, I promise,” I said, taking his hand and squeezing it slightly.
I glared at Greg and Mycroft for upsetting him while he was in such a fragile state. I draped an arm over Sherlock’s hunched shoulders and stated as calmly as I could, “Boys, where do we go from here?”
“Oh my God… John! You’re bleeding!” Sherlock sounded so panic stricken that my eyes snapped open again, concerned by what had upset him so.
Sherlock continued to look at me before harrumphing and leaving the table to collect his laptop. “If you want to return to work then you are more than welcome to. I’m sure I can cope on my own for a few hours a day,” Sherlock said, collapsing into his armchair to peruse his website.
I hummed appreciatively as he continued to press open mouthed kisses over my chest while I caressed every inch of his skin I could find. He found a nipple and kissed it, making me arch off the bed and make a noise of surprise and pleasure.
Sherlock didn’t look at me, just answered plainly, “Shock collar…” He then seemed to realise what he had said and, grabbing his scarf, pushed passed me with more strength than I expected him to possess in his current state. He stormed straight out of Greg’s office without looking back, tying his scarf back around his neck.
“And you should rest more! Doctor’s orders,” I said, pushing him gently back onto his bed.
My phone buzzed. It was Harry:
There was silence while Sherlock’s words sank in. We couldn’t risk losing Moran and if we got this wrong, he’d slip away. I ground my teeth in frustration, “So we still have to go.”
I tried my best to soothe him, rocking him, rubbing his back, stroking his hair, shushing him and reassuring him that everything would be alright. But the truth was, I had no idea what we were going to do, if it was really going to be alright. He had been doing so well and everything had been good until that weasel ruined everything...
“Oh yes, very straightforward case!” Sherlock mused. He smiled at my disbelieving yet affectionate look, “I expect we shall wrap it up completely tonight.”
My feelings for Sherlock hadn’t lessened or exactly increased as I had been so worried about trying to get him better. But now that he was better, I didn’t know how to proceed. But Sherlock, being Sherlock, solved all these worries in his usual abnormal fashion.
I looked around to see what had made Sherlock freak out like that when I saw them; chains.
I sighed, of course he knew exactly what I was thinking. I stood and walked to my armchair, I didn’t sit down but I gazed at Sherlock, “I don’t know if I want to. I mean, I do but I don’t want to leave you here alone.”
He shook his head and clutched at his chest as though he were in pain. His began almost hyperventilating and muttering, “No, no, no…”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, “The Woman?”
“Sherlock! How are you?” I said, closing my laptop and getting to my feet.
He trailed off again and I could see his eyelids drooping, he was obviously exhausted, both emotionally and physically. Sherlock really needed his sleep but at the same time, he wouldn’t be able to sleep soundly until he overcame the past, so I pushed on.
I had no idea what to say to him, so I held him close and started stroking his curls, “Well, um, your skin, how soft it is to touch. Um, your hair, how it curls over your forehead… and your eyes, how they are green and blue and grey all at the same time… You’re just, beautiful.”
“Why do you have such an obsession with my hair?” Sherlock inquired innocently.
“He said I was to type out the history of the building that was only ever hand written. I thought this was weird but I thought for the money they were offering I had scored big you know. They only asked me in for four hours every morning and this went on for eight weeks.”
He nodded and kissed me lightly on the temple, “I understand.”
He was talking about his scars but truthfully I hardly even noticed them anymore. They were just Sherlock. I knew he wouldn’t believe me no matter what I said so I tried something different; I licked the large scar across his chest from underneath his nipple up to his clavicle.
“He’s uh, not too good to be perfectly honest with you,” I told him what Sherlock and I had agreed upon. When I finished talking, there was silence on the other end.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut with a grimace on his face, “Yes, well I’m glad it took you eight weeks to come to this very obvious conclusion.”
The shock of hearing him talk so nonchalantly about what had happened made me drop the soup ladle I was holding. I closed my eyes, leaning on the bench. The way he talked, as if it didn’t even matter. To be honest, it scared me to death.
One such endearing thing happened as we were eating lunch that very day. During our meal, I moved my leg under the table towards where Sherlock’s own long limb was resting. I rubbed my leg against his, making him stiffen and tilt his head to the side in confusion. His brow furrowed, asking the unspoken question.
“I was going to clean you up but then you looked so beautiful in your sleep that I didn’t want to leave you and miss a moment,” Sherlock’s voce rumbled from beside me, I could practically feel the rumble of it through his ribcage.
“No!” Harry exclaimed, “What did he say?"
“Holy shit…” said Greg, quickly turning away from the laptop and stalking to the mantlepiece to gasp it with white knuckles.
The car ride back to Baker Street was silent and tense but I decided to leave Sherlock to his thoughts, allowing him to calm down some more before I broached the unfortunate subject. When we were both back in the flat I decided to take the plunge. I followed Sherlock to the bedroom and leant against the door frame, clearing my throat.
He was still breathing slightly irregularly and muttering incomprehensible things under his breath but the detective was more or less sleeping quietly.
I swallowed hard and nodded again, this time with more confidence, “I’m glad you’re alright. And I agree, we are going to finish this tonight, one way or another… But Sherlock, no matter how determined you are, Moran will try to get in your head. I think this will set you back a ways, I just don’t know how far.”
“I know, and I love you for it. All of you, really,” Sherlock looked at the people gathered in living room and even acknowledged Mycroft with a nod, before leveling his sharp gaze on me once more, “But Mycroft is right John, this is the only way to draw him out. We’ll never be safe from him as long as he’s still out there.”
I cleared my throat tentatively, “Um, Mrs Hudson?”
An image popped up underneath this last message.
Sherlock nodded turned back to the TV. I got my phone out again and informed my sister of the change of plans, before settling onto the couch with a book.
“Everyone I meet, if they want me at all, they want me for my brain. And- and if I don’t… don’t have that... if I can't get my brain to work properly again then… then…” Sherlock trailed off and buried his head back in his arms.
My head was spinning, who knew Sherlock would catch on so quick. I suppose I should have realised though, that he’s good at almost anything he puts his mind to.
I covered my mouth with my hand, my heart was breaking. I didn’t know what to do, what to say to make it better. Tears began to run down Sherlock’s cheeks as his breathing became rapid and erratic, leaning unsteadily against the mantle.
I pulled him into a tight embrace and we just stood there, holding each other. I breathed in his familiar scent and smiled, “I can’t believe it took us so long to get here, but I’m so glad we made it.”
Sherlock pursed his lips together into a thin line and balled his hands into fists. I was worried that I may have upset him again but he nodded for me to continue.
Sherlock hummed in appreciation as I plucked his blue dressing gown off the back of the door. I smiled at him over my shoulder, enjoying the sight of him stretched out amongst the sheets with a sleepy smirk and hooded eyes.
Greg choked on his tea as I smirked. He coughed quietly before replying, “I suppose that’s only natural, I mean God only knows what he went through…”
Sherlock hummed in agreement and kissed me deeply once more before getting to his feet and making his way to the bathroom. I followed him on shaky legs and stood in the doorway as he began to undress.
After a few seconds, he cleared his throat and straightened his scarf, before turning to me, “Well, I think that about wraps it up, don’t you?”
Greg spoke up again, “And it was time stamped to when we sent the message back agreeing to his terms.”
Sherlock started mumbling and moaning as ran my other hand over his thighs and moved a finger behind his balls to massage his perineum. When I did this, Sherlock bucked and groaned so loudly that I kept doing it until I found his prostate from the outside, massaging it with two fingers whilst still teasing his balls with my thumb and forefinger.
“I discovered that although its primary function is to arouse the contributing parties for intercourse and the testing of a potential mate’s genetic fit, it is also to cement an emotional bond as you said before,” Sherlock said, turning over the information as he said it.
I felt a blush rising in my cheeks again, “I know, it’s just that… what I meant was that… um, you know, you’re not well at the moment so maybe you… um…”
I heard the knock at the door and Mrs Hudson greeting my sister before she came to tell me Harry had arrived. I reassured Sherlock one last time and asked Mrs Hudson to sit with him until I came back.
I furrowed my brow, “You think I am what?”
They both turned towards me when I entered the room and asked with grim resolve in my voice, “What’s the situation, gents?”
Once the pills were gone, Sherlock took the tray and placed it back on the bedside table. When he turned back around, I shuffled closer to him and ran my hand down his bare chest gently. I placed a gentle, lingering kiss to his lips before nuzzling into the curve of his neck and inhaling deeply.
She smiled and bustled away. I turned to Harry, “Do you want to come up and see him?”
With only some slight cajoling, I was able to convince Sherlock to eat some too. Although, based on the amount he had made, it seemed like Sherlock had enough for both of us and was just putting up a fuss. He probably knew full well that he was hungry, and that I would make him eat anyway, so he had made enough for us both. Once the toast and tea had been finished, with minimal grumbling on Sherlock’s part and token needling from me, Sherlock handed me an array of pills to take with the glass of water.
We had gone out to dinner at nine and by the time we were done it was ten. We had chatted for a little while but eventually Sherlock grew distant. Now we were sitting here and because I had no idea what we were waiting for, I was observing Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at me with that expression that said, ‘why do I have to explain this to you, are you really that stupid?’ “Why would I go to the trouble of making and carrying two cups of tea when I can just make one large one for you and drink yours?”
I was so moved by this sentiment. I smiled and brought his hand to my lips, pressing a sweet kiss to the back. He smiled back but quickly pulled away as the waitress came back with our meals.
I smirked and started thrusting gently up into Sherlock where he was resting in my lap, “It was nice, I wasn’t complaining, I kind of like you horny, you were all controlling and it was very hot.”
“It was just like you said; the adrenaline was a little too much. I thought I could handle it as soon as I knew what was going on but… it seems I was mistaken. I just had a momentary lapse, that’s all. It wasn’t anything major.”
Nodding, I left him to his own devices and sagged against the door once I had closed it behind me. Letting out a shaky breath, I heard the splashing of water as Sherlock entered the bath and I squeezed my eyes shut as I tried to push away the image of Sherlock’s naked, broken body in the water.
“I’m going to get him through it. He’s really not very well at the moment but I’m going to help him. What else can I do?”
I pressed my own kiss to her temple and smiled, wrapping my arm around her slender shoulders, “Thanks Mrs. H. I’m glad you’re here to look after us.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes he is...” I confessed. "And I may have accidentally told him that earlier..."
Greg regarded to two of us with an 'aw-they’re-so-cute' face before sobering, “I’m not completely incompetent no matter how much you call me an idiot, Sherlock. I can tell when you’re hurting. I always have.”
I found once more that pacing just made me worry about him, so I went over to the mantle where Sherlock’s skull friend was sitting and leaned against it. I tried to stretch and work out the kinks in my neck and back but after I had relieved almost no tension, I regarded the skull.
“Well, I came to check on you actually but I see now that John has that quite under control!” Greg said with a raised eyebrow.
“Why do you think I’m beautiful?”
Sherlock nodded meekly, “They said I would be sore but there was no lasting damage. I had to use this salve though… they said the skin was torn…”
I shrugged, pulling the Sherlock-scented fabric closer around my shoulders, “Why not?”
Greg and Mycroft exchanged glances just as Mrs Hudson appeared in the doorway, saying quietly, “Is this what I think it is?”
Sherlock started to shake his head and mumble. He threaded his fingers through his hair and began to pull at the strands but I grasped his forearms gently to halt his movements. He looked up and stared at me when I placed a hand gently on the side of his face.
Shit gets dark at the end of this, so fair warning. It'll be okay though! I promise!
He complied before licking and kissing at the aggravated skin. Sherlock reached around, his hand exploring my abdomen and trailing up to brush a thumb over a nipple, all the while moving to scrape his teeth over my Adam’s apple. I gasped and let my head fall back against the taller man’s shoulder, head spinning.
I closed the door and moved to the bed, laying myself out on it as Sherlock looked me over hungrily yet confused, “You mean like masturbate in front of each other?”
“How the hell did you know they would be tunneling in here tonight?” Greg asked, hands on his hips incredulously.
Mycroft took a visible step backwards, a look of surprise on his face. It was only there for a moment and then his calm façade was firmly back in place. He spoke on, “It was still too dangerous to involve you. We had to make sure you weren’t in any immediate danger from Moran…”
“No, I think I’ll have a shower first. Maybe after that I’ll have some tea or something,” he said weakly, attempting to get to his feet. I rose too and helped him up by the arm. He swayed slightly and leaned on me for support.
He sighed shakily into my chest and I nodded, “Okay. Thank you for telling me.”
He looked into my eyes now, showing appreciation of my concern, “I’m fine. Just part of the process right?”
He barked a laugh against my skin which came out sounding more like a desperate sob. I pulled away from him and asked him again what was wrong.
“Sherlock,” I called before he could disappear into the bedroom. He stopped and raised an eyebrow at me.
Uh oh.
“Oh no, there’ll be nothing of use there,” Sherlock stated. “The real intrigue is at the scene of Mr Wilson’s tobacconist shop!”
An unintentional tear escaped from my eye, sliding down my cheek at Sherlock’s words. They were so defiant and beautiful; he had spoken without fear, something that Sherlock hadn’t done for a long time. Well, there was fear, terror in fact, but he wasn’t going to let Moran’s actions ruin what we could have.
Oh, shit, I thought. He had figured it out. I had been too obvious. Oh god, there was no way he would feel the same, what was I gonna say to him?
“Surely he’s not stupid enough to just come when we call?” I asked, incredulous. “Won’t he realise that the whole situation is suspicious?”
About twenty minutes later, a sharp ping sounded through the quiet living room. All eyes flew to the laptop on the desk, all except Sherlock. He let the last note he had plucked from his violin ring out, before going to carefully lay the precious instrument in its case. No one moved, all eyes now on Sherlock as we waited to see what he would do.
Sherlock started shaking his head desperately and mumbling incoherently. I squeezed his hands and shook them gently, “Sherlock? Sherlock, listen to me. I know that you’re scared, but we’re gonnna get through it, yeah?”
“Shut up Greg,” I said I put the kettle on, smiling when Sherlock came up from behind and wrapped his arms around me.
I was pleased to hear that I had been right, “So does that help?”
I swung my legs gently over the edge of the gurney once the paramedics had finished, my new stitches twinging uncomfortably.
Greg nodded and turned to me, “How do you manage it? I mean, he must be twitchy about, well everything after what happened.”
“About an hour. And yes, I did get some sleep, before you ask.”
Greg approached the laptop with trepidation and let out a quiet breath when he read the message, “Jesus…”
I tried to convince myself that it was purely a doctor’s reaction to all the scars I had discovered on his skin but really I knew it was more than that. Ever since I met Sherlock Holmes, I have been a different man. For starters I hadn’t ever been in a serious relationship since moving in with him.
Sherlock looked at me with a look that seemed to me to be a silent thanks. He nodded dropped his violin on my armchair.
As we moved through the gloom, I surreptitiously looked around for any signs of movement, either from Moran or from Mycroft’s men. The building was still, apart from the creaking of old metal in the night air. I supposed it was a good thing that there was no sign of our backup as we didn’t want Moran to suspect anything, but somehow that thought didn’t comfort me in the slightest.
Sherlock always poured his emotions into his music, meaning that with some practice, I can tell exactly what Sherlock is feeling through his compositions. I could tell he was getting more and more worked up just by listening to the intensity of his playing.
With that, I turned and tried to push down my fury so that I could focus on helping Sherlock.
“I think I’d better check you too my pet, just to be sure,” Moran purred as he parted Sherlock’s coat and groped at him as he checked for weapons. Sherlock started to tremble slightly, squirming as the other man’s hands trailed over his body agonisingly slowly.
The detective gazed at me with look in his grey eyes that I hadn’t seen in months; uncertainty and fear.
“He picked me up and took me to a special MI-6 hospital or something so Moran wouldn’t find me… hmm…”
“Well, you need to find out what happened to him. If it was something so horrible that it’s affecting him like this…” he left the rest of that sentence hanging in the air.
Sherlock lifted his chin and met Moran’s shark-like gaze, “I said ‘no’.”
Harry sat and waited patiently for me to begin, as she had done so many times before during the past three years. Now that I was here having this conversation, I had no idea how to phrase what I wanted desperately to get off my chest.
I chuckled this time, “That’s called being horny.”
At that moment, Sherlock rolled over and grasped my hand with his other one and pulled me closer. I sat there for a moment, unsure as to how I should proceed. In the end, I decided to leave him alone to rest but as I tried to free my hand from Sherlock’s grasp, his eyes fluttered open.
“Sherlock was… detained for about ten months. I don’t know how much he’s told you but as a doctor I’m sure you’ve realised how serious the situation was. When I found him he was… on the verge of death. I transferred him to a secure medical facility and nursed him back to health, the best doctors in the country were on site, don’t worry…”
“Hmm, that was nice. You should do that more often when it aches,” I said quietly.
I rubbed his back, figuring that he would tell me when he was ready. God, I felt like such an idiot. I'm a doctor, for god's sake! I shouldn't have opened my mouth... I guess seeing Mrs. H so worried about him made me feel obligated to explain Sherlock's behaviour. After sitting with him for a few more minutes and continuing to rub his back gently, his breathing slowed slightly. He didn’t raise his head but he mumbled something into his arms.
Sherlock fell back against the pillows too with a shaky exhalation, “Oh. My. God. John.”
“Oh John, you are so beautiful," Sherlock breathed, voice an octave lower and dripping with arousal.
As Sherlock pressed send, his hands began to tremble on the keyboard. I put my other arm around him and pulled him towards my chest, where Sherlock promptly shut his eyes and buried his face against my shirt.
I thought I should definitely change the subject now, so I got to my feet and asked, “Do you want some tea now?”
I put up my hands in an attempt to calm him down, as you would with a scared animal. That is probably the most apt description of Sherlock at that moment; he was cowering against the filing cabinet, breathing heavily, and eyes angled at the floor, staring unblinkingly.
“Okay. I suppose you’re not going to tell me your plan, are you?” I questioned suspiciously.
“Please tell me you have something,” I said as Sherlock moved towards the laptop.
I always felt terrible for reminding him of what happened but at the same time, I knew that I couldn’t keep apologising for wanting to be close to him. Sherlock always told me that it was fine, that he would get over it eventually but I wondered sometimes, if only for a moment, that perhaps we couldn’t get past his trauma.
“Something you need assistance with Detective Inspector?” Sherlock asked.
I didn’t say anything; I just sat and watched him. I know he knew that I was looking at him, but he was deliberately ignoring me. So I just sat there, waiting for him to get frustrated or just bored so he would open up to me. I didn’t have to wait long.
He looked up at me, confused. I smiled encouragingly at him and he tentatively picked up his violin, which was lying beside the couch. He began to play one of the most melancholy, heartbreaking pieces of music I have ever heard in my entire life. As he played, the deep sad notes washed over my soul and almost made me tear up.
“Not when you’re just learning,” Sherlock purred into my ear. I shivered as his hot breath tickled my ear, before Sherlock planted a tiny peck on the top of it.
He stopped and looked between the two of us. I could practically see the cogs in his head turning as he deduced everything about what we had been talking about. He laughed humourlessly, “You’re both worried about me.”
Sherlock nodded and continued, “I landed on my shoulder but I knew I had to keep going so I ran as fast as I could, which wasn’t very fast as I wasn’t in the best condition, and found Mycroft’s car following.
After our meal, we took a cab back to Baker Street (this time I held the door for Sherlock in order to get a view of my own) and settled in for the afternoon. As I sat down on the couch and turned the TV on, waiting for Sherlock to fill the empty space next to me, he tapped a message out on his phone, pacing around the room.
I made myself a mug of coffee and sat in my armchair, determined to wait for him to come home, however long it took.
“John, what is it? What’s going on?” Greg gasped breathlessly, looking between me, Sherlock, and Mycroft.
“Need to, need to… come…” Sherlock gasped and I let go of my grasp around the base of his cock as I pulled my mouth off until the hear was the only part in my mouth. I wanted to taste him fully so when he came explosively down my throat with a cry, back arching off the bed, I swallowed down as much as I could. I milked him through the aftershocks as he panted my name, sill moaning as I swallowed his seed.
Sherlock pursed his lips, thinking, “I think I understand what you mean. We’ll just wait and see?”
Hello again my faithful readers! I have a long chapter of smutty goodness for you as you have been so patient lately as I prepare for exams (I am procrastinating right now but meh)
“Listen, you need to take them so you can feel better. Trust me! I’m a doctor,” I said with a smile.
Sherlock thought for a moment before sitting on the arm of my chair and dumping his lanky legs in my lap, “Yes, I think it has. Can we try again? Now that I understand it more now I think I might be better…”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, wrinkling his nose adorably, “I don’t know. I did enjoy it, but I’m still not sure I understand what people hope to achieve through it other than spreading bacteria to improve our immune systems...”
“Sorry, John, I don’t know what I was doing…” he said, avoiding my gaze.
She dabbed at her eyes before clearing her throat to speak, “I knew something was wrong but I could never have imagined... Poor Sherlock.”
The sound of that name stirred a hot rage in my veins so powerful that I fought through the haze of drugs to become more aware. I realised I was in the back of an ambulance getting my leg disinfected and stitched up under local anesthesia, but I had no idea how long it had been since I had been injured. For all I knew, it could have been hours, but in reality it was probably more like 20 minutes. I lay there in the back of the ambulance for a few minutes, clawing my way back out of the haze of painkillers through sheer stubbornness and a driving need to get my hands on Moran. Looking around, I could see Sherlock and Mycroft talking outside the ambulance and registered that Sherlock had one hand resting on my foot, rubbing back and forth in soothing circles.
“I would have a cold shower and it would go away,” he said matter-of-factly. “The only sexual experience I’ve had was with…”
“Yeah, they’re in position, waiting for our signal. What exactly are we expecting?” Lestrade asked curiously.
"If there's anything I can do..."
There was silence again and I felt a blush rising in my cheeks as I thought about what I had just said. Then Sherlock said softly, nestling into me a little, “I don’t really understand the term ‘beautiful’. When applied to people, I mean. You know, I find the natural processes of bees beautiful, but… it doesn’t make sense to me with… people.”
He hadn't been eating, which granted isn't unusual for Sherlock, but he stood up from his armchair one day and swayed dangerously, all the blood draining from his face. For his body to betray him like that was another very bad sign.
There was a flurry of movement as people who I assumed were paramedics swarmed around me. I realised that Sherlock was no longer next to me and that was unacceptable.
I walked past the bathroom on my way from my bedroom to the kitchen one morning when I heard a noise coming from the within. It was barely audible so I had to press my ear to the door to hear clearly what it was.
“Will you stay with me again?” he asked hesitantly. “I don’t think I will be able to sleep without you…”
“You don’t have to ask every time you want to kiss me Sherlock,” I explain patiently, pulling him down fully into my lap.
“It’s alright, I’m right here.”
If I wasn’t already breathless from my exploration of Sherlock’s flesh I certainly was now. The sentiment was such a surprise that I could not convey my feelings any other way than placing a tender, loving kiss to his perfect lips. It was slow and thorough and when I pulled away, Sherlock was staring at me wide eyed, as though he completely understood what I just told him, without saying a word. I pushed him back down gently, kissing him again but with more rigour.
I opened my eyes again when I realised that I couldn’t feel the warmth of another body beside me. I looked over to Sherlock’s side of the bed to find it empty, but the blankets had been tucked around me to keep me warm. I pressed a hand to the other side of the mattress, which had a small amount of warmth left in it.
“It’s okay Sherlock, don’t panic. You’ve gotten through this before, remember? You’re fine, I think it’s just the adrenalin. Just look at me…”
Thanks for your patience, hopefully there will be a new chapter asap :)
I opened my mouth to defend myself but I closed it again knowing it was fruitless. Sherlock knew, there was no use in trying to deny it.
“But, what happened if you woke up with… well, morning wood?”
I shook my head, understanding what he was getting at, and grasped his neck, “No, it’s okay Sherlock. I don’t expect anything, I never have. Especially not now…”
I huffed in annoyance at this statement, and at the fact that Sherlock took the mug from my hands and took a large sip, “I do not snuffle!”
As I moved on down his chest to look at the sickly pale scar, Sherlock leaned back slightly so I could take a better look at the damage. I traced the scar with my fingers gently and asked, “How did this happen?”
When we arrived at the victim’s apartment, Greg and I exchanged looks, knowing that Sherlock was only a hair’s breadth from losing it completely. As soon as he arrived at the crime scene, he was agitated; he kept blinking and shaking his head as if his vision was impaired, he was trying to conceal his shaking hands by stuffing them in his pockets and his breathing was faster than normal.
I wrapped my arms around him and held him to me, rocking him gently and whispering soothing words into his ear. We were only like this for a second until he forcefully, but not violently, pushed me away. He tore at his shirt, clawing at the material.
I dont write much of it so I hope it's okay :)
I did a double take, “Wait, there’s an ‘us’ now?”
“What are you doing here Lestrade?” he asked without pulling back from the embrace.
Sherlock paused as he blew on his spoonful of soup and nodded quietly before returning to his meal. I cocked my head to one side as I watched him. He really was awfully thin. I thought perhaps I needed to put him back on a drip, but I knew Sherlock would never agree.
Once that was done, I turned to find Sherlock seated at the dining table peering into his microscope and examining some strange smelling specimens. I slid my arms around his shoulders tenderly, kissing his temple, “What are you looking at?”
I chuckled, as Mrs Hudson wagged her finger at us, “Now, now, there’s no need to be coy! If you two think I don’t know what happened last night then you are greatly underestimating the volume of your love making!”
In the split second after the lights cut off, I threw myself at Sherlock, knocking him out of the way as the gunfire erupted. I felt a sharp pain in my right thigh but the adrenaline surging in my veins pushed me to grab Sherlock and scramble towards one of the concrete pillars. I crouched down and shoved Sherlock against it, covering him with my body as something hot and sticky began to flow down my leg. I ignored the pain and clutched onto Sherlock, who was holding me just as tightly as the gunfight raged.
I blinked. What? Had I heard him right? Does that mean he thinks I’m beautiful then? Me, a middle-aged, wounded, weather beaten old soldier… beautiful to the great Sherlock Holmes... What did I say to him now?
We made our way up the stairs and I called Sherlock’s name as we entered the living room. He looked up like a startled cat, eyes wide, and said “You’re back!”
I let go of a breath I had no idea I had been holding and made my way over to Sherlock, resting a gentle hand on his back, “I don’t either. If you hadn’t noticed, I’m not exactly an expert in long term relationships... But I think, if you wanted to, we could figure it out together?”
I looked at him and glared, not too harshly but just enough for him to know that there was no other option. He sighed and slouched back into the cushions. I went to the kitchen and fixed him some toast with butter.
Short-ish chapter here but I wanted to get another one up quickly because you've all be so nice sticking with me on this story :)
Sherlock frowned, “What do you mean?”
Sherlock pulled away slightly and shifted his weight a little in awkwardness, “Listen, I know I haven’t ‘officially’ said it, or anything but…”
Sherlock shifted his weight nervously, eyes focused on his violin and not on me. He was obviously very uncomfortable about his breakdown last night and wasn’t sure how to deal with the aftermath, “I’m um… well…”
Despite the slight tremor that I could still detect in the hand against my cheek, Sherlock smiled at me with a hint of his old charismatic ‘Sherlock’ smile, and in that moment, I felt like we might just get through this and be okay. I couldn’t help but smile back at him with some of the mad energy we share whenever we’re on a ridiculous adventure. He kissed me softly and I revelled in the fresh, minty tase of his mouth, treasuring this quiet moment before we charged into danger once more. At least this time, Sherlock would not be facing it alone, as he had done those long years that we were apart.
“I know that this meeting may set me back, possibly quite far. I accept that. But I will get better,” he said with determination, before cupping my face gently and saying softly, “because now I know I can get better, as long as we do it together. With you by my side, I can be Sherlock Holmes again. Just you and me against the rest of the world!”
I chuckled in reply, glad that Sherlock wasn’t upset with me. As he finished unwrapping the bandage, he said softly, “I just want to shower before we do anything. Maybe even have two showers…”
Mrs Hudson smiled at me and said with honest conviction, “It’s up to you, dear. I don’t know what you should do, but if you need to let Sherlock heal. Help him get through this, and then see where you stand once he’s feeling better.”
He looked so frail and fragile, like a china doll that might shatter if you dropped it. Eventually, the bath filled up and I tested the water to make sure it wasn’t too hot. I then straightened and turned around to face Sherlock, who was trying unsuccessfully to worm his way out of his dressing gown.
“What, just overnight?” I asked, confused.
It took a moment for his words to register and I looked down at my right thigh. There was a tear in my trousers and blood leaking from the wound. Quite a lot of blood, actually.
I quickly shuffled towards him and placed my hands over his to still them, “Shhhh, it’s okay, just calm down…”
Sherlock turned to me, placing his hands on my shoulders for support, his panic taking him over. I pulled him into my arms as he sobbed desperately, muttering nonsensically into my jumper. His knees gave out under him and we sank to the floor as I attempted to calm him.
I squeezed the hand that I was holding and placed my other hand on his cheek, rubbing his porcelain face with my thumb, “Hey, it’s okay. Sherlock, look at me, you’re okay. Stay with me. You’re safe.”
As we sat in companionable silence around the table in the kitchen, I was thinking over the idea of going to the surgery.
Hands were grabbing at me, pulling me away from the vile excuse for a human being that deserved everything I could throw at him and more. As I was being frantically pulled away from Moran, I managed to land one last blow with the knee of my uninjured leg into his groin with such force that he collapsed to the ground. My official diagnosis was that Moran was left with a severe concussion, a broken nose, a fractured jaw and probably a testicular rupture.
I glared at him before laughing at him, “How do I deserve you?”
Sherlock nodded lazily and promptly buried himself under the sheets with a roll of his eyes. I grabbed my discarded pyjamas from the floor and hurried off to the shower.
Sherlock looked at me with wide eyes full of a mixture of worry, anger and even a hint of fear, “Why did you tell Mrs Hudson?”
He threaded his fingers into my hair, “Yes, God yes.”
“What about this?” I asked gently, my fingers grazing over the scarred flesh.
Mycroft nodded grimly at my acquiescence, “We send Moran a reply from Sherlock’s account, something to get his attention. We set a time and a place for them to meet and then we apprehend him when he shows himself.”
“I think you should go and have a shower,” I said.
Moran turned and began to descend the metal stairs leading down to the ground floor, “Now, now Sherlock, I thought I taught you better than that. It seems you’ve forgotten some of the lessons I taught you during our time together. But no matter, we’ll just have to start from scratch.”
“Sherlock!” I leapt to my feet and rushed over to him. He was clinging for dear life to the arm of his chair, sobbing, whimpering.
"I know where you are," I said warmly.
“… Also you often stare at me when you think no-one is looking as you were doing just now.”
Was she laughing at me? I literally did a double take. Was she really laughing at me?
Greg looked confused for a moment, having forgotten about the case in the shock, but then nodded, “Good luck, John and be careful.”
We continued eating our meal, all the while being cheeky under the table and exchanging small grins. It was as though this was all extra exciting because no one knew for sure that it was even happening. It made me feel more secure as well as making the whole situation a bit sexier…
I sighed as she moved over to the laptop, before gasping and covering her mouth with her hands. She stood there quietly, tears in her eyes, as Mycroft stepped forwards.
I returned my gaze to Sherlock’s face as he looked at me with a concerned but determined expression. He touched my elbow and said quietly, “We’ll get through it… together. Just like you said.”
As always, comments are welcome and appreciated!
Through the buzzing in my head, I distantly heard voices shouting at each other, as though I had cotton wool in my ears. The one sound that brought my hearing back to sharp clarity and snapped time back to its regular speed was a deep baritone rumbling from beneath me.
It was late afternoon when I awoke with an uncomfortable twinge in my bad shoulder. I groaned involuntarily as I sat up slightly, trying to work the dull ache from my war wound. I heard the scraping of a chair from the kitchen before Sherlock appeared in the living room.
I started to nod in understanding but immediately regretted it as black dots flashed across my vision, making me groan once more. When my vision cleared a little, I could see Sherlock kneeling beside my head, face pale with worry. I tried to muster up a smile to comfort him, but it probably didn’t look very reassuring, judging by Sherlock’s unconvinced reaction.
I shook my head, deciding not to tell him that yes he did in fact wake me up, “No, no, I was just wondering how you were?”
After Sherlock had finished his meal, he got to his feet and tottered over to the couch, before collapsing onto it and asking quietly if I could put the TV on for him. I thought that the way he asked was strange; polite, tentative, even fearful, a complete change from his old demanding nature. As I turned the TV on for him, I thought about how he had been acting very timid lately.
“I know you’re here. Why don’t we stop wasting each other’s time with this dramatic pause and get on with things,” Sherlock’s voice echoed around the cavernous room with a valiant attempt at his customary flippant tone.
“Hmm? Oh, nothing. Just finalising some things with Scotland Yard,” Sherlock answered.
“While it was still moving?”
I peeled my eyes open again to look down at the place where the pain was radiating from. Gloved hands were covering the wound, and my head was clearing a little after the initial wave of dizziness and pain, “Yeah, I’m with you…”
“We are?”
“I don’t want to deal with it; I want it to stop!” Sherlock exclaimed.
Greg approached us, shaking his head and smiling at us with bemused relief, “You know, you two really do worry me sometimes.”
Nevertheless, I pulled Sherlock’s head to my chest and kissed the damp curls on his head while Greg opened the laptop and reviewed the message Moran had left Sherlock.
Greg nodded in agreement, “I guess we’ll just have to keep a close eye on him then.”
He nodded, pulled up the hateful message from Moran and began to type:
I shook my head wearily, “No, but it’s related to Sherlock, since he came back.”
The room fell into silence at Mycroft’s outburst. It was so unlike him to make such an emotional display, especially regarding his own family, let alone admit his own failure to find a solution to a problem. I felt a pang of shame underneath my anger, he was suffering just as much as the rest of us. In the quiet of the room, I heard a creak on the top stair to our flat and looked over to see Mrs. Hudson standing in the doorway, wrapped in a thick tartan dressing gown and surveying the scene with damp eyes.
Mrs Hudson smiled kindly at me for a second before chuckling quietly.
pathetic!"
I swallowed nervously, not wanting to ask but finding that I had to know, “Where you a virgin before… well, you know.”
We sat down side by side, my hand still in his as the weight of the moment rested in my stomach. I was giddy and nervous at the same time but I was determined to make Sherlock’s first kiss the best one I had ever given in my life.
“No! That’s not enough time to prepare an organized strike and you know it Mycroft,” Sherlock said gravely, locking eyes with his brother, “If this isn’t carried off with absolute precision, we’ll lose him again. And if we wait long enough to prepare properly but we don’t show up to meet him, Moran will know something’s wrong and vanish. I can’t let that happen!”
A pained look filled Sherlock’s eyes and he looked away from me in shame, “Yes. Moran knew and… well, I suppose it was just another way to make me suffer. Something else he could take from me…”
I let out the most ungodly sound as he continued to tickle me with his tongue. I could practically feel the smirk on his lips as Sherlock revelled in how easily his handiwork could undo me. I encouraged him to explore my mouth as I had done with his; he hesitantly brushed his tongue across my teeth, eliciting a moan from both of us.
I chuckled, pecking the tip of his nose, “But it’s nice to wake up to, isn’t it?”
“I know, but it can’t stop until you do, okay?”
I glanced at Greg and he shrugged at me, so I decided to run after Sherlock and found him in an alleyway, leaning against a wall and breathing heavily on a cigarette. I quickly dodged back around the corner of the alley. This was really not good.
“Why delay the inevitable?” said Sherlock, seating himself in front of his laptop on the desk. He pulled up the web browser and went to his blog page.
Sherlock blinked, “I know I am.”
I sighed, “Maybe just for a little while, until we get used to… this.”
I mumbled back, too content with our current position to enquire further. I brought my other hand up to run through his curls, inhaling the scent of his shampoo and kissing his scalp lightly.
“I’m not sure that I’m alright,” he said slowly, “but I’m not hurt at least.”
I turned towards him and leaned on the kitchen bench. I felt a burning, seething anger in the pit of my stomach towards the elder Holmes. How could he have let that happen to his own brother? I think back on it now and realise how unfair those thoughts were, as he did in fact rescue Sherlock eventually, but I wasn’t thinking straight.
I was surprised to say the least, but I was grateful that she approved. I hugged her and said goodbye, telling her to keep in touch, to which she heartily agreed, saying she wanted to know hoe Sherlock went.
I nodded in acquiescence. I was silent for a few moments, allowing Mrs Hudson time to process what I had told her. I then thought back to my morning ponderings and the subsequent revelation and decided that I needed a second opinion regarding my feelings for the man sleeping on the couch upstairs.
Although, as the weeks rolled into months, it became less of a struggle to get Sherlock to take his pills and eat, and slowly but surely I noticed him putting on some weight. He was still the stick of a man he used to be but there were no longer bones sticking out where they shouldn’t. His flashbacks slowly became less intense and further apart so I started weaning him off his medication.
Once again, I am new to the smut writing business so I hope this is good. I'm happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy! :)
Mycroft remained perched primly on the edge of a dining chair, as still as a statue. The only movement that betrayed his unease was the tapping of his fingers on the handle of his umbrella, which he still clutched despite sitting down. Greg was pacing up and down in front of the sofa, every so often making a move to sit down but then turning and pacing some more.
Greg looked shocked as Sherlock strode passed him, already hot on the trail of this bizarre case. I smiled, “Nice to see you Greg.”
He turned and watched me uncertainly as I lay down on the bed, supported by pillows so I could see Sherlock’s face. I indicated for him to come closer and tentatively, he crawled up to sit beside me.
I turned onto my side and put some distance between us so I could look at him, “What do you want? From me, I mean. Do you want me to… I dunno…”
“What was that all about?” Greg asked quietly so as not to attract the attention of the others. Lestrade knew better than to discuss Sherlock’s mental state in front of everyone from Scotland Yard.
“Look, John, I’m very tired so can we talk about this tomorrow?”
I heard Sherlock’s voice coming from my left but there were too many people around me to see him. The pain was getting worse and I groaned pitifully. Then the pain suddenly intensified to a hundred times worse and I cried out, closing my eyes against the agony.
I froze. How could he even ask that? I turned to him, having no idea how to react, I went over to him and embraced him, pulling his head to my chest and threading my fingers through his sleep tousled curls.
I sank onto the couch to rest my elbows on my knees, suddenly exhausted at the prospect of more waiting. Sherlock looked similarly lost, pacing from one end of the room to the other. I’m sure that not being involved in the plan was killing him too. I caught his eye when he turned away from the mantle and patted the space beside me on the couch.
Sherlock rested his head on my shoulder and squeezed his eyes shut, taking deep breaths, “I’m not entirely sure but I think Mycroft was getting close to my location so they needed to move me if Moran wanted to keep his plaything.”
Thankfully I was jerked out of reverie by my phone’s incessant buzzing before I got too excited. I looked at the screen; it was Harry.
“Calloused; they’ve seen pain and hardship but haven’t lost their careful kindness…” Sherlock drew the next finger into his mouth, sucking on it gently. I moaned into Sherlock’s neck, kissing and nibbling on the pale flesh there, licking the slight scar tissue that remained there.
When I licked at the fading scar around his neck he gasped more loudly this time, muttering in my ear, “You… you feel so different than He did…”
I nodded, eyes narrowing in playful distrust, “Okay… Whatever you say…”
Sherlock sat for a minute, rocking back and forwards slightly, “I don’t want you to go…”
“Sorry for the change of plans, it’s just that Sherlock’s really not in a very good way,” I said, gesturing her to a seat in Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. She had laid out pastries and tea and various other specialities of our landlady.
“Well coupled with the fact that you are exiting my bedroom and you have nothing on but pyjama pants and said dressing gown, as well as your frankly alarming bed hair…” Sherlock trailed off before smirking. “It’s hardly a difficult deduction, even for Detective Lestrade.”
As Sherlock dozed against me, I kept an eye on the time; it was only 9:00AM. I thought that I may go back to the surgery soon; due to Sherlock’s lack of Work lately, I felt responsible for the financial situation. As I was contemplating getting up and calling Sarah at the clinic, Sherlock stirred.
It was Lestrade; he had texted me with a curious problem he needed help with, asking after Sherlock’s health. I turned to Sherlock and asked him if he felt up to returning to work.
Sherlock’s breath hitched as I straddled his hips, rubbing our lengths together. I continued exploring every inch of his skin with my mouth, hands running gently up and down his sides as he spoke. Cautiously he ran his hands over my back in return.
I was disgusted by what I found out about what had happened to him. I knew that much. But I was concerned about how I had reacted to seeing Sherlock’s body and my immediate impulse to touch him.
Sherlock grabbed the sides of his head and groaned before saying, “Why won’t it stop spinning?”
I smiled, hugging him tighter to me, “I’m glad you think so. By the way, you are a very fast learner.”
“Um… Well, uh… how long have you… uh… you know…” I stammered, turning an intense shade of red.
I licked experimentally all around the shaft as Sherlock became a quivering, moaning mess beneath me, until I found the vein underneath. I remember liking it when girls had done it to me so I started to pull off slowly, dragging my tongue against the vein as I went. Sherlock started panting my name like a mantra as I started bobbing up and down, taking his cock deeper with every thrust and rubbing my own cock against the bed for some kind of friction. He was so hard inside my mouth, I hadn’t noticed before but his cock had a pleasant curve to it that made it fit in my throat deliciously.
“I love you, John. I think I have for a while, but I can’t pinpoint exactly when it began. All I know is that the thought of you, and of coming back to you, kept me going while I was gone. You’ve saved me so many times without even realising, and I can’t believe you’re here with me after everything that’s happened. You’ve been so patient with me all these months, helping me get better, even though I don’t think I deserve you.”
