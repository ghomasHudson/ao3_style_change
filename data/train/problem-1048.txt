John remained in the doorway, unsure how to reply to Sherlock's new test. Or was his way of greeting?
"Here, what does this taste like to you?" A gloved hand was shoved under John's nose, who recoiled violently.
“Oh?” He replied, his tone playfully flirtatious. He resisted the urge to skim his eyes over her slim figure. Her tight, dark purple shirt worked wonders for her...upper torso.
“Oh dear yes I’m fine, just a small fright.” She stepped out of the milk, leaving her soaked slippers beside the puddle.
A few weeks later and John now found himself without money or food. Again. His army pension had gone to prolonging his stay at this ridiculously overpriced hotel and the leftover Chinese had only stretched over a little while. Now his stomach was demanding attention as he sat cross-legged on his bed watching the continued debate on the telly.
He had honest doubts about the chip. He wondered what chaos would ensue during exams. Students sobbing over their textbooks at three in the morning would suddenly be greeted by leapers climbing through their windows. He supposed they could give the students a quick pop-quiz and a hug before climbing back out the window.
John decided he was beginning to miss Mr. Whiskers. He set his undrunk tea down and raised his palms up. “Look, I was called here on an emergency, if no one’s dying, I think I’ll be going now. Thank you for the tea” he added gently to Mrs. Hudson before stepping back through the door he had burst through. He descended the stairs much slower now that the call of danger had dissipated.
"Oh no I ensured it." And with sudden agility, Sherlock got to his feet and went into the kitchen. John heard the unmistakable click of a kettle being turned on. He followed after, leaning against the doorframe of the kitchen watching the other man raid the cupboards.
However, his brother had kept his end of the bargain despite Sherlock’s second thoughts. There was the head in the fridge to prove it. He had originally requested it in order to practise removing the tiny chip in his head but decided he might as well determine the coagulation of saliva after death first.
He had invited John to look at a severed head in his fridge. Surely murderers don’t invite witnesses to their own crime scene. Do they?
"Lestrade, I said he's with me." Sherlock enunciated firmly, turning away and leading a very bewildered John closer to the corpse, lifting the tape for his height. The man, Lestrade, had let go of John and now stood a few metres away, running a hand through his hair in exasperation. If John had to guess, he'd say this wasn't his first dealing with Sherlock. And rather than wondering what said madman was doing at a crime scene, he turned his attention to the remains of John Standish.
Halfway through the final shootout of a James Bond movie, John heard the shrill freak-out of his pager. He dug around the sheets of the bed before finding it and shutting it up before checking the signal data. Sure enough, his trip didn't warrant anything but his two feet. He decided  to bring his jacket this time just in case the fire had died down and it's not like there was a rush  anyway.
And if by a sudden apparition, there was Sherlock, taking his other elbow and leading him back into the alley. The silver-haired man spluttered in indignation, still firmly gripping John's right elbow.
"Found anything?" Said a very tired looking Molly, coming back into the mortuary, two steaming cups in hand.
"I play the violin when I'm thinking, and sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
“The trials have been run and the project is go, and over the next month, British citizens will report to their nearest hospital for the implant. The microchips will not be activated until the first of May. During this time you will all be retrained to accomodate this new system. For those of you staying on, that is. Leapers will not be required to have a chip inserted, I’m afraid you’ll have to rely on the good old-fashion call to 999.”
John jumped back, his knees hitting the coffee table and his ass all but collapsed onto it. That voice. Sherlock sat up, uncurling himself from the foetal position and fixed John with his glassy pale stare. His eyes were somehow unfocused and painfully sharp at the same time. His hair even more ruffled than last time.
He didn’t bother with his jacket. What could be a liver in the crisper could also be an actual emergency and he wasn’t going to take any chances. It’s not like he could anyway. It was his job. And it was only a few running paces across the road.
“Oh that’s good” John said enthusiastically glancing up at the roof as if expecting to see all the criminal intentions of the people above him. Things were already off to a great start. Well that is until John caught sight of the receptionist’s expression. “I mean uh, it’s good that you’re working to fix that. Um, just put me down for two weeks, for now. On card.” He said, handing it over.
He wondered if Sherlock had walked back to baker street too. Maybe he was lying in an alley, bleeding to death. He shook his head, remembering the pager still in his pocket. No one had been murdered tonight because it hadn't happened yet. But it was probably about to.
“John? Did you hear what I said?” Sarah snapped her fingers in front of John’s nose, her mouth quirked up into a knowing smile.
John turned, by instinct, to the sofa and was surprised to see it vacant of any overgrown adults in their pajamas. Instead, Sherlock was sitting, one leg crossed over the other in a chair by the dying fire, dressed in a suit and plucking the strings of a violin. He opened his mouth to ask how the hell Sherlock was still managing to drag John out of his room and was prompty cut off before he could begin.
"Obvious. You arrived here in 6 minutes. The only restaurant nearby is the one two streets away, calculating your less than average leg height and your timing from your hotel to my flat, it should have taken only half that time, meaning, you felt some semblance of guilt toward your dinner guest, not someone you knew or they'd have understood your situation much more readily. so date it is. One you truly believed you had a chance with. Wrong, by the way. Despite your aesthetic exterior, the previous few texts she had sent to your phone had at three grammatical errors in each sentence and the improper use of the word 'hors d'oeuvres'..." his nose wrinkled in distaste "...suggesting she is clearly only educated up to a high school standard and had been instructed by her old-fashioned minded mother, most likely Christian, to find a rich husband to support her. Seeing as you couldn't even afford your own Chinese last month and had taken her to a 2.5 star restaurant, I'd say it was doomed from the start as she would be practicing celibacy until her wedding night." And with a flourish of finality he slapped John's phone into his hand (John had a very odd sense of deja vu) and swished out of the alley with a "Text me the details, Gavin. Laters."
However, once he had received his order and hurried it back to his hotel room, he found it had been one of the best meals of his life. John suspected the lack of his money spent on it had something to do with it.
While Sarah had looked the most promising candidate, he found himself turning all his jean pockets inside-out in order to find the number of a pretty blonde that had winked at him in line at Tesco's.
John didn’t blame them for their motives for joining but was sceptical at the newcomer’s abilities. Having a bunch of greenhorns at the beginning of a national trial would not give good results. It’s as if the whole world was watching to see the test crash and burn so that the country would become the laughing stock of the world.
He increased his pace. He was still at least ten minutes away from the hotel and no cabs had passed him. In fact, not a single vehicle had been on the road, probably  because it was well past 4am. John looked back at the car, not bothering to pretend he didn't notice it and his stomach did a little flip. The car had moved to his side of the road and sped up to John's pace.
“I am not having that thing anywhere near me. I don’t need your ‘concern’ to get any more invasive than it already is.” He stalked out of the kitchen, stepped around large stacks of papers and slumped into his leather chair. He picked up the Stradivarius that lived beside his chair and plucked a string continuously, glaring at his brother who was still staring at the kettle.
Recently though, John had just taken to slapping the phone onto Sherlock's palm none too gently, finding small satisfaction when he found it. Sometimes he found it under sinks, in the kettle, under the severed fingers in the fridge and once even in the pocket of the detective's purple shirt. The latter had him storming out again, if only to hide the unexpected grin suddenly making an appearance on his face.
He sighed, taking a sip of his tea which was barely warm and bordering on tragic. The one downside to being on the job 24/7 was that drinking alcohol was strictly prohibited. Technically he was on commission, ‘leaping’ to the aid of whoever needed it and only getting paid on the severity of the emergency. He found there was not nearly enough near death experiences in this part of London to sustain his endless take-away habits.
Halfway through a pleasant conversation about how many cats could one legally own with what's-her-name, the worst sound in the world began to make itself known from the confines of his trousers.
Oh glob oh glob oh glob. This is my first story! So scary! Thanks absolutely anyone who bothered reading it XD
John stared after his flapping coat in bewilderment. He had expected criminal robberies in this part of town, not rude charity.
John snorted. A gunshot wound to the medulla oblongata and some crazy blonde was requesting medical help, as if a thousand doctors could stem the blood flow that had begun to create a crimson puddle around her office grade, high heels. The onlookers surrounding the corpse glanced around expectantly as if waiting for someone to step forward, tucking their halo into their white coat as they squish the tiny pieces of brain matter back into the gaping wound in the man’s head and therefore bringing him back to life.
Dammit. He berated himself. There was just something so difficult about being professional at one in the morning. Especially with his boss being rather temptingly attractive.
He gave the man a brief nod before picking up his duffel bag that held all of his worldly possessions and marching in accordance with the man’s directions. He took the stairs that were off to the side out of habit.
"Time of death?" Sherlock queried, glancing up at John rather than Lestrade. John sighed and decided to just get this over with. He pulled out the pager and scrolled to the most recent alert. Sherlock stood and went back to hovering over John's shoulder, very much in his personal space.
He felt a curious sense of déjà vu as he rammed his shoulder into the black door, the golden address above him gleaming in the orange street lights. He tried the door knob and found it opening easily for the second time in his life.
Realisation was dawning on all their faces as John muttered a very sincere apology and all but ran out of the restaurant, pushing aside the usher and opening the damn door himself and escaping into the refreshingly cool evening.
John wondered if this argument would go on for years. It seemed to be the age old question if human lives were worth more than privacy. John supposed he was too biased to express his opinion to the television screen. It was unlikely they would hear him let alone agree with him. After all, he didn’t have to have the chip implanted as long as he remained in his job.
Not even uncle Myke's political influence could keep me in a school for more than 2 years, and that was only once, what end up in a murder. I've already had been in three traditional London schools and it never end up well.
Gregory was not, not like a normal day. Spending those hours with them saved him gives exhaustion, shearing the, although hurt, sweet company of the ginger man made his day easier. Back to the loneliness of his apartment, full of bad memories and more alcohol, it was a sad idea. He sits more comfortably in the chair.
I can only assume they did it, because the next part is just data, a few numbers and the year it got ready. 1914. It seemed to be a super building already at the time, only military, rich and important could study there, save from the war. Both wars for what I could understand, the Cold War, every conflict since, the place was improved over the years to contain more weapons, more trained people and security systems. It was a fortress.
I don't look to my colleagues while wait for him. Part of me don't know if following him to the corridor is a good idea. He could be a killer, some psicotic criminal hired against uncle Myke, but I don't let that thought go, I couldn't let the paranoia take control.
Gregory asks me to tell everything that happened, meanwhile he grabs his chair from behind the desk and puts close to me, I don't answer, observing him, uncle Mycroft follows he every move, silently questioning. The man takes an third chair and place it right beside me, indicating it to my uncle.
For the first time after my mom's death, someone was hearing my laughter every day. For the first time studying in London, I wasn't simply sitting on the first chair and listening to the teacher, without talking or looking around, too scared of screwing up something. It was a good sensation, not being just with myself.
Sherlock stands up, taking it seriously now. Mycroft find it amusing to see how his shoulders stay tense and his face falls in serious concentration, deducing, wondering, just like the boy who would call the police 15 time a day to tell them he solved a case and they were idiots. Maybe, just like when they were children, he could help his brain to work faster.
The door shakes more, making an very weird noise, my heart skip a hit and his voice gets more angry and senseless. All that because of money, or to save the marriage he was destroying himself. But that doesn't made any sense, he was actually desperate. Why? Why so desperate to get in? The man in the phone was getting the door open anyway if uncle Sherlock didn't came sooner. Than why? Angry? He wanted to hit me? It doesn't make sense! All that... Panic.
― Oh, he knows that, but he'll be angry with the idea that someone almost took me from him ― John opens a sweet smile, as if the idea of a caring Mycroft was curious ― And than he'll be angry with me because I called Sherlock. Angry plus angry and I'm to blame.
— Right... — Stands up and follows her to the door of the apartment, always smiling, convincing himself to think about what she said after — You are coming back, aren't you? Come back and be my company.
Standing on the corridor is a man who I assume is the next teacher. He doesn't say anything, just pass through us, calmly, impeccable uniform, grey hair cut very short and face full of wrinkles, but the backs as straight as they were in the first world war, probably. He waves at Pasteur and enters the classroom. I imagine that's my permission to stay out a bit.
The caring green examine every part of my face. I love how he trace every line of my curly hair, my cheek bones, lips and turn back to my eyes, and, even seeing my mother in every little part, as I know he is, my uncle Mycroft seems to like what he's seeing. He is not like my grandparents or Sherlock, and that makes part o my self hate fade a little.
Mycroft smirks, shaking his head, the grey haired man observes it mesmerized, it was a sweet smile. The inspector was, undeniably, only a observer in the scene, Louise and her uncle were playing their everyday game, she was trying to keep him on his calm.
— People won't like it, or understand it. It's better keep it to myself — I let my eyes fall, observing the carpet — But she already was with the suspect! I just confirmed — he cleans his throat loudly making me raise my eyes to his face, and rise and eyebrow sarcastically to me — But she puts me out of her class, it's like you always say: the masenger it's always guilty — I bound my head — I'm sorry, uncle Mycroft.
Mycroft doesn't answer, he just wanted to get home, faster as possible, he is unable to gather the straight to talk. Minute by minute, his forces leave the hurt body, pain increasing. His mind was focous in the pain, every part of his body pulsating with his heart. The weakness come with the shivers, teeth knocking, the cold sensation. Maybe he could pass away, but all that humiliation would kill him.
John gives me my backpack, smiling. He blinks with one eye to me, conspiring, I let a short smile scape and let my uncle take me away.
I want to say there were rich people in my old school, and the problem was with me and the hate I bring to myself. I want to say that I don't like the richy annoying kid too, and that I have no interest on getting involve with them. I want to say that rich kids have a tendency to be cruel and arrogant, and I couldn't bare their presence and their illusions of superiority. I want to say I don't have my uncle's political talents of ignoring things I consider wrong, and that my mom was exactly the same as me.
General Needham's office is on the first floor, it's big, with lots of books and some pictures. His wooden desk is very beautiful and full of papers, there's nothing personal in it, no family pictures, the whole room was about the army and that's it. I shake my head and stop staring at things, I can't deduce thing about him, if I don't, I won't have wrong things to talk about and I will not put myself into trouble.
A little of Johnlock here, hope you enjoy. Now. The next chapter will be extremely violent, but with some important plot, I'm trying to figure it out how to make it accessible to everyone.
— I don't want to give him trouble, uncle Myke — she, once again, invade him with the blue sad eyes, stormy doubts on them. — He will feel horrible for investing things involving me.
I convince myself to ignore him, it was the true after all, the proof was uncle Mycroft, who would never, in ordinary conditions, take a child into his house. But it wasn't time to think about it, even hurting very badly.
He barely lets the soldier argument against and grabs him by the arm pulling the smaller. John, while permit himself being pulled, still does not quite understand the reaction the girl had, because he would be afraid of Sherlock, even if he always acted cold with her, he would never hurt her, it is not something Sherlock does. He stares at the tall man in front of him, silent questions Sherlock simply ignores.
— I'm waiting, ginger mine... I love gingers, normally the soft throat and pale butt... — he passes the hand on the almost none hair, felling every thread, extremely soft. Amusing.
Silently, I follow to man through a wooden stair, his heavy steps making my heart freeze. Anticipation is the best trick on a torture section, I hear that "by luck" when I "walked by" my uncle's door during one of his meetings. And I knew it was right. All of that was going to be such a torture to me, get to know people I knew were going to hate me, that would probably be cruel, but the worst part was the the calm walk to my destiny. I didn't knew how would be, who or why, and, without following the steps, my imagination was running free.
The door at the top of the stairs was slightly ajar, and John started up the stairs, Gladstone following. John knocked lightly at the door.
"We haven't even started on the fun part," John said. "And we'll start off with this question: when was the last time you ate anything, Sherlock?"
Of course, Mrs. Hudson wouldn't be shocked by anything, even if she did know, not with her interesting past.
"What about you, Sherlock, any prospects? How about that lad who's researching with Dr. Binnema?" John asked, nudging their shoulder with hers.
She and John began chatting about inane topics, and Sherlock turned to the aforementioned Mr. Fielding. Sherlock sighed. Well, here went nothing.
"I'll be home for Christmas... if only in my dreams..." John suddenly appeared from behind him, and before Sherlock knew it, they were waltzing across the kitchen while John hummed the song. Sherlock's feet automatically followed where John's led, and Sherlock's heart hammered as John smiled at him.
John's hand ran up Sherlock's spine and back down. Sherlock's legs shook, and John had hardly done a thing to him. John kissed the middle of his spine and seemed determined to press his mouth to every single vertebrae on the way down.
John’s hands ran up the length of his legs, fingers catching in the soft, curly hair. Sherlock shivered and spread them further.
And then Sherlock broke into loud sobs again, and John carefully put an arm around their shoulder. Sherlock sniffled, and rested their forehead against John's shoulder.
Sherlock rested his forehead against John's collarbone, and John kissed his hair, and his temple, and the arch of his brow. Now that he wasn't kissing John, he found that his shirt had come untucked from his jeans, and somehow, he was leaning back into the couch with John overtop of him.
“We’re a couple for this case,” John said quietly. “We can’t just go into this cold, we’ve got to practice being comfortable with this sort of thing.”
John stomped out the door without even changing into his date shoes. Sherlock screamed wordlessly, and threw himself down on the couch. To his horror, he could feel tears forming at the corners of his eyes. He dashed them away, and lay there trembling with the force of his anger.
"I'm not going after a bad boy if that's what you're thinking," John snorted. "As if that ever ends well."
Why had he thought John was flirting with him? Obviously it must have been wishful thinking, because John was holed up with some woman that wasn’t him. He’d probably been on a stay-in date with her, and he’d interrupted.
John wasn’t even that interesting. He was just another neighbour, albeit a slightly less annoying one than before.
, and waited to see what happened. He didn't know why he expected Posh Bloke to be back, or why he was bothering, but he had a feeling stirring in his gut that promised him that tonight, something would happen.
He applied just the tips of his fingers and his nose to the line down Sherlock's quivering stomach and finally let Sherlock have the tiniest of love bites right next to one jutting hipbone.
"Soon you'll be done, just a few more," John said, even as he laid another mark on Sherlock's cheek.
"Darling?" John laughed, voice still more high-pitched than normally. "You're not everyone's darling. Only I'm daft enough to describe you that way. Sweetheart would have worked just as well, I suppose."
John went over and looked out. There was nothing to hang onto, no balcony or anything. They were three stories up and it looked as if a person who entered the window would also need wings. John sighed and turned back to look at the equipment.
And the thing was, he wasn’t even pretending to be unfazed. He just plain and simple didn’t care about the sleeping arrangements at all. He’d noticed there was only one bed and skipped over the awkwardness altogether while I was still stuck in limbo.
Sherlock wasn't really supposed to take hormone surpressants every single time. He was supposed to allow one heat every three cycles, but he hadn't kept up with that. He'd been surpressing his heat for years, as far as John knew. It was bound to be extra strong after being repressed for so long.
"You're lucky they let you come with me," John said. "You couldn't tell them the name of our current prime minister."
The only reason that Sherlock wasn't complaining was that he actually loved eating shortbreads. There was nothing better, as far as Sherlock was concerned, except maybe mince pies. He hated most aspects of Christmas, but the sweets were the only bearable part.
And then John tripped, and both he and Donovan toppled backwards onto a pool table. A pool table that was currently in use by what looked like a biker gang. A biker gang that wasn't very pleased that their game had been interrupted.
"We'll be there right away." Sherlock looked up at John. "The man we rescued today has been murdered."
Sherlock didn't really remember most of the ride back to Baker street, just that John let Sherlock rest his head on John's shoulder and that his fingers carding through Sherlock's hair felt rather nice. The next thing he knew, he was in his own bed, and somehow miraculously dressed in pyjamas.
John raised the leather close to his face and took in a deep breath, savouring the scent of leather. His mouth watered, and he felt hair prickling on the back of his neck with excitement.
"This is my assistant, Doctor John Watson," Sherlock said. "He's a veteran, and this is Gladstone, his service dog."
"Okay, you can have your CCTV footage," Mycroft said, rolling his eyes. "Although Lord knows why you need it."
“You know, we’re not your personal database,” Sally said as she took them to her desk. “You can’t just get us to run plates for you whenever. It’s against the rules.”
Tentatively, Sherlock checked his hair and clothes in the mirror before heading to the front door. John’s door was right next to his, and Sherlock raised his hand to knock. He hesitated.
John reached around and used the same lube to slick up Sherlock's erection, although it was hardly necessary with how much he'd been leaking. Sherlock made another whimpering noise as John started slowly but firmly stroke his cock from root to tip, swirling his thumb over the head. Sherlock pushed up into his fist and then ground down into John's lap.
Sherlock made an exhausted-sounding whimper, and John pulled him closer, wrapping his arms around his torso and bundling him close.
John eventually rolled off him and used his discarded boxers to wipe them both off a little. Sherlock hardly moved, sleepily allowing John to kiss him.
I internally shrugged and opened the case dossier. It was difficult to concentrate with John’s head resting on my shoulder – my heart was doing strange things in my chest – but I somehow managed to focus.
Sgt. Donovan went aside to fill him in. John didn't pay attention to anything else but Sherlock, who was crouching on the floor and staring at the grate. He reached out and banged on the grate with his knuckles. Frowning, he lay closer to the floor and did it again.
Sherlock examined John's cock with his hands, measuring it with the stroke of his palm, the curve of it fitting around the head, his thumb stroking up the underside. He stroked John slowly, until he decided that he'd catelogued enough with his hand. All the data he could collect with his hand had been achieved.
"Someone's got to make sure you stay on the sex crime unit's nice list," Lestrade said. "Or you won't get to take part in another case with them."
Normally he wouldn't bother with such a mundane observation, but he needed more data on how what he was trying to say translated into whatever was coming out of his mouth.
He put his hands on Sherlock's cheeks, and Sherlock whined as John's thumbs pressed against his sore flesh. John spread him open, looking down at the little whorl of his hole, pink and perfect, nestled in between his bright red arse cheeks. John leaned in and licked a stripe up his crack, right up to his balls. Sherlock moaned, and tried to spread his legs even more, although that was impossible by this point. John delved in pressing his tongue to Sherlock's hole and wiggling. He circled the tip of his tongue over each ridge, trying to gain access. Sherlock panted and gasped with each pass of John's tongue, pushing back against the intrusion.
There was always experimenting with something that absolutely reeked, so that when she came over, the flat would smell intolerable. No, again, John would be annoyed, even if he didn’t realize what Sherlock was up to.
It had little pom-poms on it, which Sherlock supposed were supposed to represent snowflakes. It also had a reindeer with a red pom-pom nose. The background was blue, and there was an arch with gold bells. Sherlock reached out and pulled on one of the pom-poms.
"You can always have him stand in the corner like a misbehaving child," Lestrade suggested as Sherlock finished looking at the body and came up to them.
“I didn’t say you had to make out with her, just be charming and ask for a couple of extra towels for our room or something,” I said, a little exasperated.
"There is not a tap up there for this beer, so I must conclude that this keg is down here for a reason other than being served." Sherlock rubbed his hands together with excitement.
Sherlock sat and waited, knowing that John was in the clinic and wouldn't answer. The car pulled up to a house, and Mummy was there waiting to greet them. Sherlock allowed her to kiss his cheek and fuss over him.
“Oh, don’t you worry about that!” the woman at the desk said. “I’ve seen the news for the weekend, and it seems like it will hold.”
He hid it in a pile of old porn magazines that he didn't use anymore and didn't know how to get rid of. It was called the "Hands-on Handbook of Bondage" and John was trying to finish reading it before Sherlock found it. He tried to memorize the steps for some of the easier knots, but John was more of a kinesthetic learner. He had to do in order to learn, so seeing the words on the page didn't help out much.
“I dream of it all the time,” I said eventually. John still stroked the back of my hand, and I took a deep breath.
The pub they were going to was just a ten minute and forty-five second walk from Baker street, and the warm summer air meant that his coat was unnecessary. John was walking closer to him than usual, their elbows bumping every now and then.
John shoved his face into the pillow, pushing the strange residents of 221 Baker Street from his mind as he fell asleep, leaving his pager in his jacket pocket for the first time.
Despite the general objection to the idea, almost 80% of the population had the chip implanted. Most had balked at the idea of serving jail time. There had been expected protest of violating human rights and something else John hadn’t really been paying attention to. His focus was on finding somewhere to live. He regretted not checking the prices of the rooms in this hotel before handing over his card.
“Excuse me?” John asked, bemused. For his first night on the job, things had gone rather strangely. He wondered if he had the right address.
He reached his door, rummaging in his pocket for the key. The room that greeted him was disturbingly similar to his old bedsit. One single bed. A small fold out table and a tiny kitchen squeezed into the corner. An inspection of the bathroom had similar disappointing results.
Sherlock shrugged and glanced around the now abandoned alley, bloodstains still adorning the crumbling walls of adjacent buildings.
He opened his mouth to offer an apologetic sort of explanation but was cut short when the door slammed open and there stood a rather short man with alert, dangerous eyes.
He switched the channel once he had a semblance of control over his giggles, realising that, for an outside observer, he would appear insane, laughing at the corpses on a 9pm hospital drama. For his occupation, it would appear deeply concerning to his superiors. He settled for a safe alternative on the comedy channel, despite finding it deeply lacking in humour. He soon found his gaze wandering to the crack in the plaster behind his telly. Six months after moving into the crummy bedsit and he still hadn’t made a slight impact. Everything still felt so temporary. Including the crack in the wall. He rather thought it looked like the crack in the wall from doctor who. As if his life as a leaper wasn’t exciting enough, he now found himself dreaming about monsters coming out of the walls.
His stomach protested loudly as he made his way down the dim hallway of the second floor. His thoughts turned to the Chinese restaurant on the corner that he had passed while in a cab. The problem with being a leaper was that cooking was as dangerous as his job. Whether it was baking a cake or frying potatoes, if a distress signal came through, all thoughts of food leapt from his mind as he rushed out to the rescue. He found this was a common problem for his co-workers. It usually meant coming home, covered in blood, to an unrecognisable pile of burnt offering, or once even, a fire burning the tea towels in a rather inncocent way. It was ironic. By preventing a danger, many had cause another. John even felt paranoid about baths. He always showered quickly and kept a robe at hand just in case. He felt no desire to replicate the eureka moment.
"Your haircut and the way you hold yourself says military but you're also a leaper, so trained in medicine. An army doctor. Obvious! And the glands have no tumors, therefore the conclusion is, John was murdered."
He made his way casually across the street, not bothering to knock. He climbed the stairs one at a time save for the eleventh and already began guessing the latest hiding place for Sherlock's phone. Sure enough, the fire was burning on it's last legs and was the only light source in the room apart from the street lamps invading their orange glow into the silent flat.
John froze. Soldier. His adrenaline was still flowing through veins and had just increased tenfold after hearing this strange man repeat that little detail. Soldier. He was still hovering by the door when Sherlock slumped into a dark armchair by the fire and gestured to the one sitting opposite him.
“I said your transfer’s been processed. They want you in central London. There’s a pay rise too because it’s expensive to find a place. It should be ok, there’s quite a bit of action. What you can’t afford now, you can surely afford soon.”
Did NOT even edit this.....please tell me if you find any mistakes. And I really appreciate criticism!!
He glanced across the road as if expecting a case of defenestration from one of the floors of the hotel. He was horribly disappointed. His phone buzzed insistently in his hand.
The embarrassment of his card declining at the Chinese restaurant was worse than forgetting his wallet in a cab. He still remembered the strange moment after he had asked to try his card again, another customer that had been waiting behind him had swooped in, flashing his card across the machine and all but shoving John out the way once he had tossed the receipt at him. He then proceeded to demand the food he had ordered over the phone in a posh, arrogant voice. John couldn’t even squeeze in a thank you before the man was suddenly sweeping out of the restaurant muttering incoherent insults under his breath, his take away nestled in a plastic bag that was swinging around rather violently with the man’s long strides.
"Sherlock I can only give you two more minutes-" Lestrade, from across the crime scene, began before he was silenced by a raised palm. Sherlock turned his attention back to John, who had regained the ability of speech.
He flicked his eyes over the pale man standing at the window. There seemed to be something familiar about him. His expression was that of surprise, not panic.
It was in a week’s time and John didn’t want to go. He decided to avoid thinking about it by returning his attention to trash telly and the pad Thai on his lap. He was losing weight at an alarming rate and he needed all the weight he could get. Any second now, he was certain a knife-wielding maniac was going to invite him into his darkened alley, the glint of his knife drawing him in dangerously close, so very close he could see the white teeth behind that feral smile…
“You can make your own damn tea Sherlock! You gave me such a fright. Keeping heads where there’s food, at my time of life, honestly.” Mrs. Hudson handed a steaming mug to a very bewildered John.
"What am I doing here, Sherlock seriously, what?" He muttered, making an exaggerated effort to remove his elbow from the loose grip. He was surprised to find the man's name on his lips, his thoughts drifting to how strange it felt to speak it out loud. Such an unusual name.
With a jolt he realised his program had ended and was now showing the late news. He glanced at his pager and to no surprise, there hadn’t been a distress call. Not that he would be able to miss the obnoxiously loud beeping from the device he was to keep on his person “at all times, John. Humanity depends on you. On us.”
All was quiet. Normal. The sun was already beginning to set and yet, the pager remained silent. He turned on the evening news, wondering if the criminal classes had forgotten to host a sweater shop heist and had all frozen to death. The telly blared to life with a grinning anchor.
The elder brother wrinkled his nose. “Hardly. I’m going to sedate you and call in a band of my employees that I have waiting patiently downstairs to take you to the hospital to perform the mandatory implantation in a sterile environment.” He glanced at Sherlock’s empty mug “speaking of which, would you like a cup of tea?” He smiled innocently.
Areas of it had been highlighted and labelled. John squinted at the small letters beside a shaded purple area. Adrenal medulla and Adrenal cortex. He felt a small sense of foreboding curling his stomach.
Both John and Molly gave confused looks to the corpse of a very blue John Standish and back to each other. Clueless to the confusion of the other occupants in the room, Sherlock continued his rant.
John stood staring at the mouth of the alley where Sherlock had just left. His mind worked furiously to process the rapid speech that had just assaulted his ears.
Instead, he found himself curled under the sheets, shivering. His days under a hot afghan sun had erased the memory of London’s unforgiving climate. The sun had been up for two hours now and yet, the pager John had carefully placed on the bedside table remained mockingly silent. He supposed the criminal classes got cold too. Maybe they were all plotting robberies under their blankets, waiting until spring to set the wheels in motion. In the meantime, they would be hibernating in order to save on food.
“I was measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.” Sherlock said adopting an air of indifference and examining his fingernails after John slammed the fridge shut and stood there, unmoving.
Sherlock snorted. “She’s my landlady. And not my housekeeper.” He added with a small twitch of his lips. "By the way doctor, how many steps are out there on that staircase?"
John was walking back to the hotel when he felt that familiar prickle at the nape of his neck. The one that told him he was being watched or followed. That sense had saved him on countless occasions in Afghanistan...and one one or two times before that.
John didn't know whether to be impressed or pissed off. He was mostly just surprised. "How did you-"
“What if I were to say that I know a mortuary attendant that would be willing to supply you with any chemical or body part you desire?” Mycroft asked, turning to face his younger, tornado of a brother who now had a glint of interest shining in his pale, oceanic eyes, his pale hands still.
Then there was Mrs. Hudson. She certainly hadn’t been expecting to find a head in her fridge. His pager was proof of that. His fridge? What kind of a relationship did they have anyway? Was she his mother?
"What do I think?" John hissed incredulously. All he wanted was a date that didn't end in stained dressed, that ended up in bed with a pretty blonde and maybe, just maybe, to sleep past 4am without being dragged out of bed to hand someone a phone that was sitting mere metres away from their hand.
Fewer familiar faces showed up to the retraining courses at Bart’s every week but luckily, they were replaced by others who thought that becoming a leaper was the only way to legally get out of having the chip installed.
And then, while scrutinising her, what he assumed was one Mycroft’s minions came up behind him and inserted a needle into his neck. He woke up much later with a small section of his hair shaved and himself in a rather unusual mind. He found, for the first time, that he agreed with the general public. There was something very wrong with this entire method of public safety. It went too far, bordering on governmental paranoia.
Sherlock paused in his movements, putting the mug he was holding on the table and let a small smile grace his lips. He placed his hands on the bench behind him and took a deep breath. "I know you’ve got a brother with a bit of money who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks you're suffering from PTSD because of the war. Quite incorrectly, I'm afraid. I'd describe it as withdrawal. Why else would you apply for essentially the same job here in London? That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?"
“Is there a medical purpose to that?” He asked slowly, wondering if the steaming mug of tea would be an effective weapon to make his escape before he joined Chip in this madman's fridge.
"What do you think, doctor?" John jumped. He had forgotten how close Sherlock had been looming over his shoulder, his hand still gripping his elbow as if afraid John would run away.
Mycroft really had sedated him. He had begun to change his mind after being introduced to the timid mouse known as Molly Hooper. She had practically squeaked when he fixed her with his gaze. Then she had turned a rather unusual colour. Had she been a corpse, Sherlock would have sampled her skin and examined it under a microscope. He imagined skinning live people without their consent would prove difficult and a bit not good.
“Sorry. Heads?” He asked her. This was the point where he wondered if he had fallen down a hole and hit his own head. Was he now participating in a mad tea party?
The detective averted his eyes as a flicker of guilt shot through him. He supposed he should have warned her about that.
And the tea forgotten, Sherlock brushes past a very flabbergasted John and swings on his belstaff with a very exaggerated flourish
Well that’s new he thought happily as he stepped out onto the slab of concrete that was only about a metre wide. There was a little iron railing surrounding him. His room was overlooking the street. Across from him were a series of flats, some of the windows lit up due to the dusk creeping over the city.
Laughter began to bubble up inside him and escaped through his lips at the image his mind had conjured up. Soon his shoulders were shaking with the gasps of uncontrollable laughter as more shots began to rip through the crowd. Bodies began to drop like flies and sheer panic caused the rest of the onlookers to flee.
John sprang up, his dinner splattering on the linoleum floor with the cracked pieces of china. He snatched up the pager that was going wild with loud shrieking beeps. His heart continued the furious rhythm even after shutting off the sound and squinting at the name and address of his newest adventure. His adrenaline began to dissolve into dread.
Of course none of John's lectures elicited a response from the detective (except a small "oof" when the cushion collided with his nose). He just simply waited with his palm held out expectantly until John huffed in frustration and stormed back down those 17 steps.
John flickered his eyes from the unusual pair of strangers in the room “Your chip has your ID on it. I’m alerted with the location and the name of the…victim” he explained.
Sherlock was up and out of his chair, scrambling for the bedroom as soon as John was finished speaking. John smiled and breathed in the scent of leather. Ah, it was lovely. He wanted this. It was something he'd wanted for a while now, but he hadn't been sure if Sherlock was okay with impact play. They had been having quite a lot of fun with bondage over the past few weeks, and that had been working out fine for them.
time John!), or climbed a mountain, but he had once eaten worms to stop his sister from going fishing. Sherlock, on the other hand, strategically used the fact he knew that John had a doctorate, had been to Kandahar (Pakistan is close to Afghanistan, but doesn't count, I said specifically Kandahar and not the Middle East, John), and had played rugby in university against him.
Sherlock edged his way forward until John was right in front of him, and both were underneath the mistletoe. Sherlock ducked his head slightly, but then thought better of it and pulled back.
If being comfortable with touching each other weren't so vital to their cover, John would find it kind of cute. As it was, Sherlock would flush and get jittery if he made a mistake, and it took forever to soothe him back into good temper.
He felt like all his feelings which he'd been holding back all this time had come to the surface and bursting through. He'd never felt like this before in his life, and it was almost startling.
John opened his arms and Sherlock twined himself around John contentedly, burying his face in the crook of John's neck. John took in a deep breath, nose in Sherlock's hair, enjoying the scent of Sherlock's sweat mixed with the faint smell of his fancy brand of shampoo.
Sherlock was heartily tired of it, but unfortunately, he couldn't get rid of it. Sherlock looked pointedly at John, who realized Sherlock's present difficulty.
"You certainly are one for dramatics," John said. "Fine, will you bloody well tell me your name, you posh bastard?"
John emerged with a towel around his waist, hair still spiky and wet, damp drops sticking to his skin. Sherlock's mouth went dry, and he licked his lips without thinking about it.
John raised his hands to touch his face and hair. His hair was once again military standard length, as if he'd gone to the military barber rather than a posh bloke with expensive taste in shampoo. His face was smooth and tingled slightly from the aftershave Sherlock had slapped on afterward. He was clean and groomed once more.
Sherlock, who fully expected to stay awake all night lying next to John instead found himself drifting off. There were worse things than falling asleep next to John Watson, and so Sherlock allowed himself to succumb to sleep
"Yes, we do," Lestrade said. "Reported stolen, although the real Dennis Tanner informed us that he would never have noticed, except he hardly ever uses that credit card, and so when it was used, he received an email notification. Anyway, we're pretty sure this guy is the murderer, so we're getting Mr. Tanner's help to bring this guy in."
The spring-snap of the crop made a visible shudder run down Sherlock's spine, and John smiled dangerously.
Sherlock had never been good at inane conversation. But nobody ever wanted to hear what Sherlock was really thinking, mostly because it was alarming. The cursor on his smartphone blinked, and he sighed. What wouldn’t John find alarming?
Sherlock fought back an eyeroll and pointed at the license plate, where the number was clearly displayed. It wasn’t even covered up with anything, or have a fake license sticker on top of it. How strange and curious.
The mobile chimed again, but this time, Sherlock turned it off rather than endure more of Mycroft's annoyingly snide and patronizing remarks.
Sherlock stared down at the screen of his mobile, a message to John open, but Sherlock couldn’t think of what to say. He was in between classes, and just wanted to say something, to remind John that he was still there. There were probably a lot of smart, attractive, soon-to-be-doctors in John’s program, and Sherlock needed John to know Sherlock was thinking about him.
Sherlock was fairly selfish, he realized, but he would give up the experiments, and the organs in the fridge, and never cleaning up after himself if he could just have this one thing.
There was one good thing about being known as anti-social – it meant that no one thought it was out of the ordinary if you were rude, abrupt, or avoidant.
“Okay, fine,” Lestrade said with a put-upon sigh. “We need two people to go to a gay couple's retreat.”
John let the crop rest just where Sherlock's crack started, but didn't dip down between his cheeks just yet. That would be for when he had Sherlock begging for it.
A lot had happened. But he had John back. That was what really mattered in all of this. They were back together again, even after all that had happened. That, in itself, was something of a miracle.
John leaned forward and took Sherlock in his mouth, running his tongue softly over the glans and sinking down further and enveloping Sherlock in wet heat.
Sherlock wished they could give John what she wanted. The heavy-duty sports bra was acting as a breast binder of sorts, however, and Sherlock felt a lurch of discomfort in their stomach at the thought of removing it.
He made a plate of apple chunks and bits of cheese and took it back to the bedroom. As an afterthought, he got some liquid honey out of the cupboard and drizzled it over the apples.
Without really thinking it through, adrenaline lending them energy, they dug through the nearest drawer and found a pair of scissors. They were lab scissors, all metal for sanitation purposes, and with a curved end. Not meant to be used to cut through anything thick. Sherlock marched down the hall to the bathroom, and before they could think about it, before they could reason it out and talk themself out of it, Sherlock grabbed a handful of their hair and snipped it off, close to their chin.
Sherlock didn't even mind the Yarders had been betting on their relationship. As far as he was concerned, he'd collected the best prize of all.
"That's the problem," Sherlock said. "If you can't resist, then how do I know you're telling the truth?"
Knowing this, I needed to first establish some things about the case. For that, I needed the hotel worker’s information.
Sherlock actually dropped his cigarette in surprise, tried to catch it, and then dropped it again because he’d grabbed the lit end.
John made them both more tea, and Sherlock helped him move and arrange his boxes. In some places, cockroaches suddenly scattered as cupboards were opened, and John’s nose would crinkle every time they found hidden mold.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. “There’s nothing wrong with you. Everything about you just makes me want to keep you longer.”
He slowly uncurled and moved back towards John. John reached out to receive him, pulling him close. Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut in embarrassment as his cock pushed insistently against John's hip, but didn't pull away this time. John ran his hands down Sherlock's sides and nudged at the hem of Sherlock's pants.
For once, Sherlock didn’t remotely care. The future he’d imagined himself since his first day at university had suddenly become infinitely brighter.
"You're doing so well, love," he said, stroking Sherlock's arse, rubbing a finger over his arsehole. Sherlock pushed back against the pressure and whined as John withdrew. "If you're very very good, we'll let you lie on my lap, how does that sound private?"
Sherlock looked back on their life and tried to remember what it had been like before they met John Watson and couldn't quite recall. It had been bad before that, but Sherlock had lasted long enough to meet John, and that's what mattered most.
"It's everything," Sherlock said, for the first time struggling with how to explain. "I hate my body a lot of the time, because it feels like it doesn't belong to me. It has nothing to do with all those body positivity things I see everywhere nowadays. It's just... what I'm feeling. It's called gender dysphoria."
It was only then that he realized he was aroused, as his cock bumped against John's hip. In shock, he broke the kiss, pushed John away by the shoulders, still feeling the warm throb his cock had made upon contact with John's body. It was disconcerting to be in this situation, one he'd only ever been in alone, with his own hand. He'd never before shared a private moment like this one.
Sherlock realized that was almost exactly what he was afraid of, and hid his face against John’s shoulder.
John turned his head and his lips pressed to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock froze, the cogs of his brain suddenly motionless with shock. It was such a soft, delicate thing, like a moth’s wing under lamplight. Sherlock shivered.
John's fingers jolted them out of their daze as they found the edge of Sherlock's sports bra. Sherlock reached up to stop them.
Sherlock thought that his flat was the most dismal place in all of existence, until one day, he nearly ran into someone in the hallway.
Sherlock looked briefly around the stage, eyes alighting on a block full of fencing swords. He bounded towards it, seized one by the handle, brandishing it with a flourish.
John started with the left leg, pushing Sherlock's ankle up to his arse and leaning against it while he started looping the rope around both Sherlock's thigh and ankle. This wasn't too hard actually, it was a bit like a cross between binding up a wound and using knots he'd learned in the army to tie things down. His main concern, which was accidentally hurting Sherlock by tying the knots too tightly, was negated by his training as a doctor.
"Look, Sherlock," Lestrade redirected his attention to Sherlock. "I know you've been investigating on your own, and I need to know what's going on. You wouldn't believe what my team and I have found in the burnt out building."
Sherlock bit his lip and then cried out again as John stroked him again, circling his thumb over the glans, pressing against his frenulum. It was pure sensation, and Sherlock lost himself in it, unable to do anything, even reciprocate, as John touched him.
And there was that "chummy" type word again to dash his feelings like a splash of cold water down the back of his neck. How Sherlock hated how John felt the need to constantly redefine their relationship as nothing more than friendly.
"Yes, and they're going to be quite put out that someone burned down their favourite dealer's business," Lestrade said with a sigh. "I should probably get narcotics involved in this."
"But I need you!" Sherlock wanted to scream, but what came out was: "Thus let me live, unseen, unknown; thus unlamented let me dye; steal from the world, and not a stone tell where I lye."
Once John had returned with it, put it under the covers and snuggled in himself, Sherlock said, "You've been oddly complacent about our change of plans."
On his own part, it had been so very easy to fall into his role. John was more worried what was going to happen when this was all over and he had to stop. Any time he felt the urge to bestow some form of physical affection on Sherlock, he didn't hold back. Letting go of his reservations had been simply a matter of telling himself that Sherlock would think he was acting.
Donovan wrapped a leg around John's (thankfully good) shoulder in order to stop herself from falling off. John staggered under her weight, but righted himself by grabbing onto Lestrade, who was just getting up. Lestrade fell over again, and Donovan was pointing at the dart and reaching for it.
Sherlock made another muffled noise and glared. John rolled his eyes, stepped forward and untied the makeshift gag from around Sherlock's mouth.
So far, John Watson had shared his bed four times with Sherlock Holmes. Those four times had been by necessity and not voluntary, at least on part of John.
It was better, damn him, and damn logic which dictated that there was absolutely no reason for it to feel better. Except sentiment. Cursed sentiment, which still lodged his throat with an immovable lump and sent a cascade of butterflies through his digestive system.
He might even have enough to get some real food. Not very much, just a couple of things. Food storage was almost impossible out here.
His heart was hammering now, a sudden flight-or-flight response hitting him in the chest and squeezing. He felt as if he were trapped, almost claustrophobic, and Sherlock was still fluttering around the flat without a care while John started hyperventilating. Gladstone whined, at his side at the first signs of distress.
Lestrade glared. "I still want them back – and Sherlock is going to disinfect them with bleach and possibly hydrochloric acid, if he has any on hand, because... Jesus, John!"
Malcolm himself was the real mystery. Why would a TV anchor become a murderer? And why these men? What connected them? The lack of information was frustrating, but I had been so focused on John this case that it had been almost impossible to think through everything properly
And he quickly stripped off his own shirt and pants without any ceremony. Sherlock did look, because John was quite correct, he’d put up with any indignity in order to see John naked.
“Hey Sherlock, if you don’t need me, I’m heading over to Chantelle’s place,” John said, interrupting Sherlock’s train of thought.
Wiggins had been one of the first people to find out John was new at being homeless and tried to help him out a bit. Once he had found out that John used to be a doctor, he had enlisted his help in exchange for some tips on living rough. It had been a bit different, being homeless in London. John knew his survival techniques well enough, but those were for the wilds. Survival in an urban environment worked differently.
John came messily all over the both of them, and it was one of the best things Sherlock had ever seen.
“The crystal says to go straight through the forest, which obviously isn't the best route for us,” John said. “I'm just going to take a look at my map and figure out if there's a road that eventually goes in the right direction.”
It hit Sherlock like a punch to the gut. John had done as asked and found him an Irish Setter puppy.
"Why would you do that?" Sherlock asked, with a sigh that spilled hot water over his jaws. "I don't believe you even can do that."
The stairs swam as Sherlock climbed them, and he felt stiflingly hot. For some reason, it made perfect sense to drop his coat on the stairs, and to start unbuttoning his shirt before they'd even got into their flat.
"The daggers already been used on someone today, mate," John said, and Sherlock cringed. Why did John feel like he had to use such chummy words? They hadn't been like that before, and if completely baffled Sherlock as to why John felt the need to call him those types of friendly word now. Unless it was to distance himself from Sherlock.
Sherlock moped in the courtyard of the castle, where Anderson had confined him. It was very dull. He'd tried shooting boiling water at the walls, but it wasn't much use against solid rock. He had resigned himself to being bored to death when he heard someone calling at the gate.
"I have a blanket, a pillow, and a book. I can certainly out-wait you, my easily-bored friend," John replied. "I won't give up so easily!"
Sherlock heard John shuffling around, taking her shoes off and putting her stuff down. Even though they normally hated it when John went off on a boring date with a predictably normal guy, tonight it would be ideal if John would just go away.
Sherlock didn't protest this time, stalking over to his chair and throwing himself down in it. Reluctantly, he held out his arm and looked away. At least if John dealt with it, he wouldn't have to bother.
Which brought John to his second point. His ex-wife was almost certainly the one that had done the deed, sometime before she'd been dragged off back to America by Mycroft's minions. It made John wonder exactly when it had been done, and if Mary had realized back then just what would happen.
John came out of the bathroom, hair still damp. My heart did something odd in my chest and I grimaced at the sharpness of its bite. John came up beside me, and he smelled of damp skin and soap.
They were ushered inside, and Sherlock was surprised to see that the pychiatric ward wasn't actually as terrible a place as he had imagined. There was a TV room, and a lounge area, and even a gymnasium.
A crawling feeling of bodily loathing filled them, but Sherlock needed to finish up today's labwork. It was an essential part of their chemistry thesis, and they couldn't skip a day just because they had dysphoria.
At least there was that. Sherlock hadn't a clue what he would have done if John had decided to go stay somewhere else. It was bad enough the first time around, returning after years of tracking down international networks of criminals only to find the only person he found important in his life had moved out, and more importantly, on. But after all this, after shooting Magnussen, nearly getting sent to his death in Serbia, solving the mystery involving Moriarty's return, and after Mary had turned out to not be pregnant after all, and also to be still working for Moriarty's network, after all that, John was coming home.
Sherlock felt a lump in their stomach, and they inched away from John. Just when they thought everything would clear up, John had to bring up this awkward topic. Of course, she didn't know that Sherlock was in love with her, but it was still horrible to have to pretend that it didn't mean anything to them at all.
"What do you want from this?" John asked. His hand found its way under the edge of Sherlock's shirt, and stroked his back.
"Yeah, you know, one time I was taking a nap and someone threw water on me while I was asleep. As if I weren't wet enough with the rain already."
"You've begun to sweat around your hairline and your pulse is up by 20 percent," Sherlock said, eyes narrowing. "Something is making you anxious."
Sherlock supposed they did look a bit strange dressed in feminine clothing, but with a masculine haircut, but then decided they didn't care. This is how they wanted to look, for once in their life. Their own reflection was mesmerizing.
Sherlock hid his face against John's chest to hide his face. John sighed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's back.
He slowed down a little as he opened the zip on his duffle. He was long over being forced to leave the army because of his injury, but it had been a long time since he'd thought of putting on his uniform again. He would never wear it in public, no. But a little fun around the house when it obviously turned Sherlock on to no end? That would be fine by him.
— It was already made — his sarcastic voice sounds in his chest in a way I can feel it in my back — But not by me... Two shots on the head.
— Dr. Watson — I try to keep my voice stable, be firm, but I can't — my uncle won't like if with keep talking at each other. It's against the rules.
Then, finding no words that would not embarrass him in front of someone so intelligent, he did what Mycroft did not expect. Gregory hugged him. The government officer was taller and hard to wrap around, but the inspector made an effort. If anyone had asked, not, he had not tiptoed, but Mycroft noticed that he did, and he also noticed the strong smell of coffee that the inspector exuded, and how his heart was calm within his chest, slowly accelerating. And he liked to notice these little things. Hours later the redheaded realised no fear came from that hug.
We practically run out the building, his hand still firm on mine. He doesn't look at me, angry just like I say to John, we were going to have a fight. Well, fight wasn't exactly the term. He was going to talk, and talk, and talk, and I was going to patiently listen. I hold his hand harder. The secure touch keeps me calm, my only worry was hold myself to him and everything was going to be fine.
Someone knocks on the door shyly and the three men look at it. The very tall and pale man with curly hair, sitted with his legs against his chest, Sherlock Holmes, just ignores it, shaking his head, annoyed, and asks inspector Lestrade, an, even being, older, with grey hair, who seemed to be way relaxed man, to continue talking about the case. John Watson, the soldier, knew exactly who was at the door, gets up and goes walks towards it, ignoring his colleague's bored voice saying to just ignore.
― No, please ― I hear footsteps coming through the corridor ― can you please tell him that it's his niece? It's an emergency!
— Well, class — Needhan turns to the kids, forcing a more calm face — Miss Holmes is you new sister — my eyes get wider facing the floor and the teacher hides a smile in his hand, clearly marking some effort to keep it together — You will share you space, your life and your learnings with her. You will grow up together, that mean you are equal. And as equal you'll be treated the same. Understood?
— Like it? ― John stops right beside me, a weird pride smile on his face. I wonder if I should let go a sarcastic cough, but it's better not ― I know it's a little messy, but it's comfortable. I would show you the kitchen, but I don't think it's safe ― he points to the glass doors on the left ― Dead body or something like that.
— Uncle Sherlock is impatient... — she smiles, while walking down the stairs, John can't avoid the thought of a little fairy slipping through his fingers.
The sniper follows her track, the small footprints and the places she bounded to hide, why bother he question, the kid is more shortie then Jim, for a fraction of second he wonders if calling his boss for a nickname was something he should do, and if it was a good time to be thinking about James.
— Nothing. Not price, no names, no upcoming revenge, suppostly, everything is quiet — he let go a dark cloud of smoke, thinking. They know what that means, and don't want to say it because of me, but I know. That was personal, organise and very calm, wasn't going to stop until complete it's objective. We didn't have how to find out anything unless who ever it was made a mistake. And that was very risky to me, too risky for uncle Myke.
