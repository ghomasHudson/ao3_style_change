“It’s fine,” Sherlock mutters, turning his eyes back to the painting. “I have no place to judge who you sleep with, anyway.”
Carefully, so as not to topple them both over, John placed his left foot on the floor, then his right. Without releasing his grip, though he did lessen its intensity, of Sherlock's shoulder's he got them both back on the bed and pulled Sherlock's head tightly to his chest.
Before he could continue, John was forced to stop and suck in a handful of slow breaths. He'd only ever said the following out loud to two people—his therapist, and of all people, Mary. Warm hands found his, the tattoos forgotten in that silvery gaze that somehow knew what John was about to say before the words had even left his lips.  He found strength in knowing that, and with a single nod, continued.
“I...this isn’t about the case. It’s about...just fancied a pint and wanted to have a mate with me to chat. You sound really knackered though, so I’ll just —“
Perhaps it was this sight that had Greg lose the ability to take precautions. To pause long enough to call for backup or do anything that his years of training taught him. Instead, he heard the crunch of glass and who knew what else under his shoes as he rushed forward and jostled John to wakefulness with shaking hands. John’s only response was a groan as his eyes slowly opened wide, and then he screamed out; a woeful wail of a creature that was already too far gone and begging to have its neck snapped in a final act of mercy.
The latest conquest of John is an operatic tenor, judging by the melodic levels of his moans. He could belt out O’ Sole Mio with the proper training, and John seems to be hitting just the right spots for a clear and exquisite high C. The part of me that isn’t seething with rage is begrudgingly impressed at what a precise hit to the prostate can do. Of course John’s cock can cause actual music. Perhaps I should do more experiments on the subject. Or, at least, grudgingly hope that I will ever get the chance.
“As if I have to tell either of you the mastery of what I do. All the planning involved..the waiting for just the right moment to strike.”
He swayed, John, still lifeless in his embrace, back to lay down on the bed. John babbled something about Morse code and tattoos, but Sherlock couldn't quite make it out. He'd have to ask John later on.
“I thought you might not want to—”
“Didn’t see you as the type to show off your pride by galavanting around without trousers, but there are all types at -- “
would always be said. Usually by John, and then echoed in a softer tone by Sherlock. There were moments when Mrs. Hudson almost believed it. When John would eventually come to stand by her front door and knock just loudly enough for her to open up her little safe haven of the world and allow him in. The chat always circled back to Sherlock Holmes. How his experiments destroyed anything that a refrigerator was meant to protect. How many more bullets ended up nestled in the folds of wallpaper and drywall. How deductions were not meant for the dates who were brave or stupid enough to enter the catacombs of 221b.
“You move back into your old room. What else is there to discuss?”
“So, I’ve been thinking. And I think — I think I want this. God help me, Sherlock, I want a whole lot more than I can have, but you were right. The other night was the easiest this has been for a long time, and I want more of that. So why can’t we? What rules are there that we can’t just have that, without any of the other crap?” John takes a deep breath, hoping that he’s making the right decision. That they can just be friends, who occasionally slide into the other’s bed.
“Sherlock?”
There was an exasperated sigh on the other end of the line, and Sherlock could almost see Lestrade pinching the bridge of his nose.
John didn’t trust the basic medical facilities in the surrounding area but knew they were too far away from his office to even consider that alternative. He grimaced as fear and doubt began to chip away at his previous confidence but, suddenly, an idea struck him. Thinking quickly yet again, he fished a hand inside each pocket of the omega’s coat, letting out a breathy “Ha!” of satisfaction as he found exactly what he was looking for. He pulled a brown leather wallet from the innermost pocket and thumbed it open. The picture on the required omega identification card stared back at him as he studied the information with a hopeful half-smile that vanished almost as quickly as it had come, melting into a disgruntled frown.
“So is that all you wanted to speak to me about?” Irene continued. “Not that I mind providing information, but you are not the type to just want that. You are solution driven. Yet another trait we share.”
“That was brilliant,” John wheezed. “Bloody all of it...”
“I feel everything, all at once. But I’m not prepared for anything like what he would want with me, even if by some chance he was actually interested in a sexual relationship.”
“Oh my darling,” Irene says in a soothing tone, clearly sensing Molly’s mood without her having to speak a word. “Who’s the wanker I’ll be disemboweling then?”
part was an exaggeration, but John barely cared. It came with sleeping with a self-entitled sociopath, and the dawning conclusion that melodrama could be sexually transmitted.
“God, how I’ve missed this...you have no idea…” With a twitch of Sherlock’s erection, John smirks. “All right, then. Maybe you do.”
“Sherlock, you know those things will kill you.”
John tilts his head up to watch Sherlock’s body. His artistic hands know just where to touch him to make his skin tingle. John had gone to bed naked more out of exhaustion than comfort, but it makes this morning even more sultry. His nudity is a heavenly contrast to Sherlock in his dressing gown and nightclothes. The smooth sensation of silk brushes his sensitive arousal as Sherlock wraps his hand around John’s erection and takes over the speed.
“I don’t know, Harry. Stop trying to be his advocate. I don’t need that right now, I need someone on my side. I can’t love someone who won’t love me back. I can’t let myself become consumed by him again, only to have him drop me whenever a more interesting case comes up. I need more than to be something to occupy his time. I need to be respected and valued. What happened with him and me...it’s not what relationships are built on...no matter how much devotion I bring to the table.”
The chest is pressed in, then released by an invisible force. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Compressions that cause the same cracking noises from before. Then it’s gone. There’s a twitch of the lips of Sherlock’s mouth as air is pushed in by that same unknown source. The breaths fight against the resistance of lungs that no longer can hold anything made to survive on their own.
Greg is looking at him too intently for John to even try to soften the blow.
Sherlock turns to Irene, not knowing if he needs to beg for assistance or threaten her in some inconceivable way. Every part of his body is aching with what he now clearly understands is his body shutting down. Each of his organs is too exhausted to continue functioning with only John there to keep his heart from turning into stone.
Sherlock smirked, followed by a quick reply. Whoever this @CJW197104 was new to his Twitter feed and brutal in a way that Sherlock respected.
He almost leaves it there. Misses out the endless fights and emotional distance. But he doesn’t. He tells Harry about the spreadsheet and the thousand other reasons he needed to leave, and when he’s done, it feels as if a weight has been lifted from his chest. There’s a hook in his throat that he keeps swallowing down, trying to keep the tears at bay, but
“You preposterously beautiful man,” he wheezes as he presses me into the softness of blankets. “As if you are allowed to die at any point for at least the next 50 years or so. I have so many plans for how to make you orgasm. Starting with another one, right now...if you’re agreeable to it.”
An eruption of fresh tears bursts forward from Molly’s eyes, and both Irene and Greta make similar empathetic sounds. A paw with calico markings is placed on Molly’s knee, and soon, she is surrounded by the three other cats in her flat, including a small new addition named Laverne. Her soft orange fur and bright green eyes both seem to shimmer in the artificial light of the flat.
“She asked about me, didn’t she?”
undertaken.
Then he folds the paper and places it firmly in his inner coat pocket.
Also John with those memory forgetting kisses, yeah? 😏
“What body?”
"No condom," Sherlock whimpered. The soles of his feet already were sliding over the soft sheets on the mattress as he tried and failed to keep still. "I want to feel all of you. Each wisp of your hair and scrape of your teeth. All the smoothness of your shaft as it enters me…"
It takes far too long for John to get dressed for the date. Is this a date? He keeps running through the conversation with Leah, again and again, to make sure. The words said and the looks given definitely lean towards this being a date, but John finds himself hesitating at every turn, the confidence from a few hours ago lost somewhere in between the clinic and Harry’s tiny bathroom. Eventually, he decides on dark blue jeans and a button-up shirt. Casual, but still smart, and the dark green shirt looks good on him. Even Sherlock had mentioned so, and why the hell is he thinking about Sherlock right now?
It’s raining off and on as they wind through London’s busy streets. The cab driver’s music of choice is classical violin. John tries not to envision Sherlock’s lean silhouette, surrounded by moonlight, as each of the pieces play, but the images are already there and refuse to leave.
“That was painted by Irene,” John remarks as he plops the small suitcase on the large double bed. “The woman can practically do anything.”
John gives Sherlock the same confused look as he approaches the table, accompanied by a deep sigh. Were the cylinders not good? Sherlock thought he was being clever, ensuring their alcohol consumption was enough to have a good time, but not so much that they couldn’t remember anything by the end of the night. Besides, Sherlock doesn’t trust himself to be drunk. Especially not around John.
John chuckled from his position to Sherlock's right. He reached out with his left hand and lightly picked up Sherlock's hand from where it sat, fighting with his trouser inseam. He kept his grip light, unsure if simple hand holding were something Sherlock would even be interested in. After a moment, when Sherlock showed no signs of tearing his hand free, John closed his fingers around Sherlock's hand and brought it up to his lips. He kissed each knuckle before lowering their hands down to the space between their thighs, then looked straight ahead until they arrived home.
Sherlock mouthed John’s last words with a roll of his eyes.
Greg gave a low whistle as he ran fingers through his hair. It was a lot to think about, and so much could go wrong.
He twisted his hand again, preparing to up the speed, but John caught him by the wrist.
Most of Sherlock's walls were cluttered with pictures or pieces of furniture. But the gap between the bathroom door and door to the hall had the least photos. Taking Sherlock's hand in his so he'd understand this wasn't rejection, simply a change in positions, John pulled Sherlock with him and pressed his back against the flat space.
He put the empty glass on the table, filled it for the third time, and reached for his phone to face the music. Mummy would be getting an email about this. Enough was enough.
“Yeah, Detective Inspector Lestrade is on his way right now. Perhaps you can explain to him why you killed all those people?” John said. Sherlock couldn’t see Micheal’s face, but the disgust that ran through John’s made him curious.
to do this. That sex is capable of being anything worth bothering with to this degree, and yet it’s everything he was horrified of is now somehow contorted into a pleasing shape. That same shape writhing at each flick of his tongue and whimpering his name.
“Sherlock...what’s wrong?”
“Does this have to do with that robbery on Rochester Square?”
Molly breaths out in relief and takes another long sip of wine. Amelia hops onto the arm of the sofa and stretches. Her short black fur shimmers in the sunlight streaming from the living room window.
“Hardly, Dr Watson. You’re much worse. Cocaine never loved him back.” Mycroft gives him one last glance and slips out of the door, his umbrella clicking against the linoleum floor as he walks down the hallway.
“I’m bringing the party to you.” Irene replies calmly, pulling the cheese out of Molly’s hands and beginning to unwrap it. “And only the best will do for my Molly.”
John snorts out a laugh, and I can’t help but join in. The two of us, him in red pants and me drinking what can only be tangentially called coffee, giggling as madly as if we were at a murder scene.
Angelo, for his part, always played an enthusiastic matchmaker. Even now, with the thrill of John and Sherlock officially being together, he hummed around, beaming down at them as they ate. Expensive red wine was poured with not at all subtle winks to both of them, and John appeared to be relaxing with the help of the more intimate setting and a healthy dose of alcohol.
That’s what’s different. All his life, he’s been accompanied by the gentle sounds of his breathing; lungs expanding and contracting in his chest. Now, the noise is gone. He looks down at his chest, but there is no movement. Sherlock tries to gasp, aiming to catch his breath, but nothing happens. His chest remains stubbornly flat, his lungs refusing to move.
John peered back up into Philip's eyes, and Anderson was suddenly reminded of that similar look that Sherlock gave when all of the pieces just snapped into place. "You just solved it, didn't you?"
“I’m going to have to check your pelvic area next...to make sure that there isn’t any deeper damage.”
A secret that Mary and a few others kept close to their chests, like the overly long dressing gown hidden in the back of a drawer full of socks or the reason why John promised not to drink anymore.
In hindsight, John wishes he had texted Sherlock that he was coming this evening. He had made a few attempts to send out a quick message, but how the hell do you begin to justify or apologise with just a few sentences? Instead, he scrolls back through the last of Sherlock’s messages. Each text's emotional weight swings wildly, and John feels his chest ache at his returned silence.
The first couple of days after
The rainbow flag that Sherlock bought billows behind them and reminds John of the way Sherlock’s Belstaff coat does the same thing. Sherlock has no real right to look so stunning in whatever he wears, but John can’t help but grin.
“Which
Sherlock stifled a moan that was luckily covered up by the driver’s quick turn onto Baker Street. John’s strong hold on Sherlock’s wrist loosened just enough for Sherlock to exhale a breath. His pants were straining against an erection created by John’s words, and Sherlock needed to relieve the pressure.
to keep moving forward.
“No, it’s not.” Sherlock finally says, relaxing his shoulders and letting out a shallow sigh. The artificial light from the kitchen turns everything a cold colour that reminds John of a hospital room. The poignancy isn’t lost on John. Sherlock still doesn’t meet John’s gaze, his eyes flickering over the piles of evidence, trying to find something, anything, to avoid looking up.
"Oh, I'll appreciate every inch of you if you let me," John whispered between kisses that were more tongue than lip. "And cheaters deserve a special place in hell just for them. You'll never have to worry about that with me."
Sherlock moves, or at least he tries. His limbs are stiff, and he can’t feel his fingertips. What’s worst of all is how quiet it is now. Only the faint noise of falling water fills the room.
The third man’s eyes blew wide with shock, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—”
John no longer drank, and that was a good thing. John no longer felt, and that was not.
And it was. All of this was.
“Erm,” he starts, his face as red as mine, I’m sure. “That was...very descriptive.”
"Bedroom with you, walk through the hall, so you don't get glass in your feet," John ordered, pointing to Sherlock's bare feet. "Strip for me, and if you're a good boy while I fix your stitches, I'll… well," John smirked and gave Sherlock's arse a light swat as the man walked past him. "I believe I still have one more promise to fulfil."
John began to move his hips, grinding against the top of Sherlock’s thigh, until Sherlock shifted to allow their crotches to lie flush against each other. They both let out a lewd groan, and John quickened the pace, his hands finding a resting place on the curves of Sherlock’s arse.
"As if it's possible even to begin to explain this!"
“There,” Sherlock said, pointing at the photo. “That dark spot on the corner. At first, I assumed it was some idiot’s thumb getting caught in the photo — most likely Anderson — but it’s not. It’s a shadow, and by the length and direction, the photo was taken in the morning.”
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders and pulls a fresh cigarette from the pack and lights it up fast. John doesn’t say anything this time, but he can feel his facial muscles tense at the long drag that Sherlock takes with the window still closed.
With a smirk, John takes Sherlock’s hand in his own and pulls him to the back door of the cottage and opens it. Outside there are large amounts of trees and the sky is littered with stars. The moon is full and shining and makes John’s blonde hair glisten like gold.
all the time, tearing his mind to pieces.
Tightening both his legs and arms around Sherlock, he squeezed his eyes shut and let out one low sigh. He inhaled again, then screamed Sherlock's name as the dam broke and floodgates opened on the exhale. He was vaguely aware that his nails were digging into Sherlock's shoulders, but he couldn't find it in him to care or to relax his grip. All that mattered was the hand teasing the crown of his cock, and the cock deep inside him.
Sally didn’t see John much at all nowadays. Unless he was somehow convinced by Lestrade to meet up for dinners at the front of the station because Greg was doing too much overflow work. She had noticed the doctor’s steady decline and inevitable comeback. Intervention had played a role as far as she could determine, and that was something to feel relief about. Sherlock Holmes had already taken up too much of John Watson's life before he had jumped. An emotional vampire even after death and that unsettled Sally. Sat heavy in her bones and that wouldn’t do now. Not when there was so much to prove to everyone around her, including herself.
“Well, I actually do detective work now. With my err — Sherlock. He’s a consulting detective.”
in there. Thousands of thoughts and ideas are occurring all at once, and the noise is so loud that it deafens out everything else. I can’t concentrate on anything; I can’t delete any of it and it’s clouding my judgement.”
Something quaked in the pit of Mycroft's stomach at the level of the incredulity of it all. The stance of the soldier in front of him with arms crossed and chin tilted up. Mycroft was heavily reminded of their first meeting years ago. Back then he had only slightly miscalculated the stubbornness of Dr. John Watson. That was not a mistake he would ever make again.
“I see, and what was your answer?”
Sherlock leaned over from the couch to see the various designer bags filled to the brim with clothing before slowly standing up and carefully walking over to inspect all the purchases.
“But if it was suicide, then why would anyone clean up - or at least try to clean up - the evidence?”
Irene places a manicured hand on Molly’s knee and gives it a small reassuring squeeze.
John sighs as he pulls at Greg’s arm a little further down the pathway and out of Sherlock’s field of vision. He’s already prepared himself for the question Greg is about to ask once they stop walking again.
“Well, y’know. You get used to it.”
With a shuffle, Sherlock sat on the metal table properly and pulled John on top of him. The noise of John’s trousers rubbing against Sherlock’s naked thighs echoed through the room, but Sherlock couldn’t care less. He had Captain John Watson on top of him with lips wet and eyes dark with arousal, and nothing in the entirety of the universe was more beautiful than that.
Taking a deep breath, John met Greg's brown eyes once more.
John’s fingers tightened on Sherlock’s hips, and he focused on his tongue. It positively wrecked Sherlock when John flattened his tongue and took Sherlock all the way in until the tip of his cock was pressed against the back of his throat and his tongue flat against his groin. Which is just what John did now. He relaxed his jaw and sunk down until his nose was flat against Sherlock’s abdomen. Then, with a hum that would have been a smirk if his lips weren’t otherwise occupied. He swallowed. As his throat constricted around the tip of Sherlock’s cock, he felt Sherlock’s legs quiver.
Below the photograph is a small editorial written by someone named Fred Danbury.
“What the fuck is this?” John spits, turning back to the spreadsheet. He doesn’t want to see Sherlock’s face as he explains. If he does, he might punch it, and that wouldn’t help either of them.
John feels his heart thumping in his chest as Sherlock watches him as if genuinely confused. How the hell can a detective be this clueless?
Sherlock let out a long and loud giggle that he knew wouldn't be possible unless he was very close to several sheets into the proverbial wind. John's easy-going charm and steely confidence were absolutely knocking down his defences, but his superbly dry yet decadent wit would be what made Sherlock crumble completely.
"...his beacon of light for so long."
“It’s nothing,” Molly begins, another sniff escaping her nose. She gives Greta a gentle scratch behind her ears, and the cat presses her head harder into her palm. “The supermarket…I was buying wine and the cashier asked to see my ID and…she didn’t believe that…”
How idiotic could I have been? I slapped down a perfectly good chance at romance because of my own desire to keep my life as simple as possible. The Work front and centre without ever giving a regard for what a love life with John Watson could give me.
Molly wraps her hand around the cool glass and glances up at her friend. Right now, it seems hard to believe, but she trusts her friend, and Irene has been out for years. If anyone knows what they’re talking about, it’s her.
But that’s what grief always did. It sunk into the soul without a proper exit strategy, and the torture of it trying to escape ravaged its host like atomic bombs. John was used to that type of suffering. That deep rhythmic pain that survived off of rage and sorrow until eventually, little by little, it eroded away. Relocated to a different human-shaped husk that made the mistake of letting it in because it was better than feeling nothing at all.
Then John is fumbling with Sherlock’s shirt buttons and Sherlock gives a hopeful purr.
Until John.
“I mean...that would be nice. There’s a lovely little shop that just opened up at the corner. I think that it’s called The Coffee Bean or...maybe The Coffee Bag?”
did it.” Sherlock corrected.
Sherlock huffs before standing up and scanning the area. The dance floor is still mostly empty, but a few women are dancing in one corner. Their friends cheer them on from the other side of the room, and if he had to guess, Sherlock would say they were part of a bachelorette party.
By the time they got ready for the game, John was bouncing on the balls of his feet in anticipation, and Sherlock had dressed and reapplied his cologne, hoping that maybe John might at least notice the difference in scent from his regular aftershave.
“I understand now that I love you, but that doesn’t change anything. I don’t think I can do this again. Not if we’re doomed to fail.”
The cab pulled up outside Baker Street, and Sherlock paused with his hand on the handle.
To accent the point, Irene pulls a comically sized bottle of high-end champagne out of the basket. Molly stares at it in disbelief. How the hell did Irene fit that in the basket?
half-sentences into the middle of John's chest. Part of a love song. The middle of a Shakespearean sonnet that Sherlock thought that he had deleted decades ago. The pin code to his bank account. All of it now lived in the linings of golden chest hair, sparkling with the fresh essence of himself.
Although, he couldn’t deny that a small shiver ran down his spine at the praise. It settled somewhere between his legs, and he had to take a sharp breath to focus himself back on the task at hand. Luckily neither John or Lestrade seemed to notice.
“You are. You’ve been ‘complimenting’ me for days, and it’s...offputting.”
to bloody kill each other?"
While Sherlock continued to voice his disgust at John's decision, John began to bring the bags inside, If only to get them off the landing. He really wasn't sure what he would do with such expensive clothes. But he supposed he should at least attempt to keep Sherlock shears away from them for the first couple of weeks.
He had a mixed relationship with serial killers. Often, the case was solved not only by his deductions, but by the inevitable slip-ups. If he couldn’t solve the initial cases within a few days, it became a waiting game, one which he resented. So, when they finally placed the killer behind bars, there was not the same rush that came with solving an isolated case by himself. Still, it felt pretty damn good.
“See you in a bit. And Johnny?” John pauses, one hand on the doorframe. “Talk to him.”
“Because it’s…couple’s don’t just tell everyone the hows and whens of their sex life.”
There was a free fall of data folders crashing from shelves inside Sherlock's mind palace. They all were moving too fast for Sherlock to tell where any of them belonged. John was rearranging all of Sherlock's internal files with just the tip of his tongue.
At first, he’d decided against changing the omega’s clothing, but after thinking it over, he’d taken into account that it might be more than a bit not good to wake up covered in your own blood.
Sherlock’s muscles tense, and his wings give a stiff twitch. John removes his hand as he turns to face Sherlock on the bed.
He was Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective; high-functioning sociopath.
"Never went to visit Dad in prison. Heard he died three years ago, something about a riot. He stopped being my dad when he killed my mother."
“Sherlock, it’s a little more complicated than that. It’s not like we just stop having sex and everything’s back to how it was before.”
“Game, yeah? What are the rules?”
"Yeah," John moaned, his breath hot and heavy against Sherlock's neck. He pressed his forehead against the underside of Sherlock's jaw and held on for dear life as the pleasure built. "Close… don't stop."
John looks Sherlock over. Identical to the way he’s done before, as if checking whether Sherlock is being deliberately dense. Sherlock feels like he’s oozing stupidity out of his pores and needs to race to the shower and scrub it off for the next week and a half.
?” she continues, sitting down opposite him for more effective cross-examination. “Clearly you didn’t make it back to the bed-sit.”
“I’ve tried to give you space and the time that you've needed,” Mycroft snapped. "Been tolerant of your vices and overlooked your sexual proclivities."
"It's this whole...could you not do
Sherlock wishes that the wine in the bottom kitchen cabinet was somehow still corked and undrunken. He could use two or three more glasses. John hums in thought.
“Is a similar thing happening between you and John?”
The man dove to the right, and John's bullet shot rang out. It barely missed the man and whizzed by his ear. With a growl, John was slammed into by a heavy shoulder and knocked down to the ground. The sound of Sherlock's voice screaming out for both of them to stop was ignored.
Molly didn’t want to be the one to pull back the curtain to reveal the gears and levers of it all. She never wanted to hurt anyone.
With a pang of guilt, John watches Sherlock’s face go from genuinely panicked to horrified. Good. He deserves to know what his fucking experiments do to the people around him.
He was questioning everything, and that wasn’t allowed. Sherlock wasn’t allowed to see anyone as something more than harbingers of data. People were meant to be collections of statistics and superfluous details. Yet John was different in a way that caused the earth not to stand still, but to vibrate.
“John, I happen to not be the type to find very much…
Shifting his stance to regain his centre of gravity, he scooped the omega’s body up from the pavement and worked his way into a standing position. He tried his best not to think too much into the consequences he could face if he was caught but it was harder than he had imagined. John was well aware that what he was doing could land him in serious trouble, but, for the moment, he had a job to do: He would care for the omega and make sure that he was safe from harm just as he had vowed to do all those years ago after being sworn into medical school.
“Apologies aren’t something either one of us needs. We just need The Work and to keep moving forward.”
is. John thinks that might break him.
“What is your issue? I
“Easier than that. Observe the lines of the shadow — short hair with a stocky build, male. Leans to the side; he has a limp. Only one man covers all those criteria, the gentleman we interviewed along with a few other neighbours. Michael Pierce.”
“He almost instinctively knew what this place was,” she continues, seemingly taking no notice of Sherlock’s internal struggle. “Started to try and find a way out. I watched him. Partly out of curiosity...the rest out of pity. Eventually, the inevitable happened. As I’m sure you’re aware, Dr Watson has a very hefty left hook.”
Sherlock hadn’t meant his last sentence to end in a question, but it somehow seemed fitting. His mind and heart were both bursting with questions as of late. He waited as John furrowed his brow in what Sherlock had come to recognise as gentle contemplation. His stomach fluttered with hope.
Sherlock mentally runs down the various areas of his mind palace for such a term, but the only visuals that come to mind with the word Belstaff are coats. He has lots of them hanging in numerous places in the flat.
“Great, you can pick me up from outside.” She winks and slips out the door, leaving him standing outside, alone. Once she’s gone, John can sense that same uneasiness he felt before he had talked to Harry. He still plans on talking with Sherlock soon, but he needs a nice time with someone different. Just to clear his head and try to have a bit of fun. So why can’t that be Leah? She’s smart, funny, and open-minded. He has no reason to feel guilty.
It takes a tremendous amount of self-control to not just walk out of the room and have Mycroft escorted off the premises. Somewhere in the more rational part of John’s mind, he knows that even if he does this, Mycroft will more than likely just swoop by the flat for an even longer talk. Best to just get all of this out now instead of later.
“I didn’t pay for a therapy session.”
“Excellent,” John interrupts before taking Sherlock’s hand in his and giving it a firm shake. “Right, then. What’s my first task? Bet I can get it done easily.” There’s a mischievous glint in his eye that pulls at something in Sherlock’s stomach.
Molly Hooper was built to be fretful. Her dark hair, just long enough to twist around her index and middle fingers when her nerves got too frayed, and small feet that could handle her daily patrol through the world. A world that consisted of the silence of bodies in wintery rooms. Their expressions in various states of resignation that came with the finality of death, no matter it’s gruesome entry or exit.
Sherlock tilted his head to see a small area of red-pigmented dirt in the treads of the man's right shoe. His eyes flashed to John.
"Should I apologise to Julia?" John asked, honestly not sure if that would help matters. For all he knew, even thinking of contacting her again might send Sebastian down a murderous path that even Sherlock couldn't stop. "I don't know how I hurt her, but that wasn't my intention. I just didn't do relationships then. Didn't think I'd do them now, but your skinny arse waltzed into my life and changed that. I should be scared of that, but," John trailed off, he brushed his fingers over the back of Sherlock's hand before saying, "I'm not. If anything, this is what I needed. You."
“Mary worked out that I wasn’t straight in the first few months of us being together,” John chuckles, but the smile doesn’t quite meet his eyes. “Curious to a fault she is. Told her everything in the space of a long weekend. She listened and asked the right kind of questions...and a few that I wished she’d left well enough alone.”
John had laughed with him. Shared jokes. Touched his hand for how long the second time?
Harry gives a sympathetic pat on the arm that John is grateful for. His head is a mess; there are at least five different things he wants to say, and he can’t decide where to start.
So it appeared Sherlock had made a good move by leaving Lestrade. John was annoyingly stubborn when it came to conversations at times. Especially when it involved the complexity of emotions, mixed in with the simplicity of sex. There had been a few more awkward encounters since that first night, Sherlock trying, and failing, to keep John pleased whilst his own mind was occupied with the case. Eventually, John had pushed him away completely, and the only communication they’d had since were half-aborted arguments about John’s emotional state.
“That doesn’t make sense.” His drink lay abandoned on the table next to Irene’s glass. He needed to keep a sharp mind; this was more complex than he had foreseen.
There was a chill in the air—wetness without the heat. John had stopped and was now resting on his elbows and looking up at him. That same look of deep suspicion.
“What is it?” John continued, then giggled at the puzzled look that Sherlock gave. “The cologne, I mean. Is it from a particular store?”
There was a scratch in the old wooden table, probably where someone's dinner knife had slipped off the plate while attempting to cut something after too much to drink. John ran his fingernail down the deep groove and pursed his lips.
Looking over the man on his sofa, it was still hard to imagine what he was actually allowing himself to do, what he was putting his license - his very ability to practice medicine! - in jeopardy for. “This is insane,” he said aloud, shaking his head for what felt like the thousandth time as a slightly hysterical chuckle slipped from his lips. “I’m absolutely mental… I can’t… I don’t even know…” He paused and dropped his gaze to the floor, closing his eyes with a soft huff as he pulled himself together and then squared his shoulders before pulling himself up to his full height. He couldn’t let himself break, not now. Not with something so important looming over him.
"And this one?" Sherlock lifted John's left arm up, exposing the underside of his bicep where a single rose on a short stem lay practically hidden.
The whip dropped to the floor and within a few steps sat on the foot of the bed to take off her shoes. The delicate toes wiggle once they are freed.

“Sherlock,” She began, then paused until Sherlock caught her eye once more. He was startled by her calling him his first name, and it unsettled him slightly. “Are you aware of the difference between romantic and sexual attraction?”
That had been the word Irene used. Some small part of him was embarrassed that he hadn’t known all this already, that his understanding of his sexuality hadn’t extended to realising the complexities of romantic relationships, but he didn’t dwell on the feeling for long. It was only by luck that he knew how to simply describe his identity -- he’d stumbled across the word asexual in the library one day, and immediately found affinity with it. The first definition he’d found fit, so he’d never looked any further. Now, he wished he had.
“What are we…” John began, but Sherlock swallowed the rest of the words with his tongue. He wrapped his long arms around John’s torso and squeezed until John’s knees buckled underneath them.
"Any time, any place," John said dreamily, mind still playing through what it would be like to run his tongue along Sherlock's trapezius muscles. "I don't always have to be in control."
That didn't make sense, though. Not when the heat of the moment was right
The doorbell rings and Molly heads over to it as quickly as she can. Laverne chirps happily as she is scooped up into Molly’s arms and the front door is opened wide.
“Now...if it’s possible to have the quiet needed for me to do the job you
John wave the gun indicating that the man should hurry off before he changed his mind. He then turned to the woman who’d been standing behind him, clutching at the back of his tux. She was dressed in an evening gown made of sparkling black fabric, a fur-lined shawl draped elegantly over her shoulders. Her eyes rose to meet John’s and he saw fear and respect play out over her face. Each emotion warring for dominance. In the end, she seemed to settle on respect and relaxed as her stalker ran off, putting distance between them. John clicked on the safety to his gun, tucked it inside the inner pocket of his tuxedo, and offered an arm to her.
John is used to Sherlock doing unusual things when a case is concerned, but he doesn’t quite know what to make of so many painting supplies all over the flat.
“It’s not just that.” John adds, his gaze settling on a point just above Sherlock’s shoulder, where a rainbow beach towel sits on its shelf. It’s easier not to maintain eye contact. “I’ve been saying I’m bisexual because it seemed the easiest and I already knew what it meant, but now I’m faced with all these identitiys and labels, I have no idea anymore. What if I’m something else, and I just don’t know it yet? What if I’ve been telling people the wrong thing? What if--”
Before now, he hadn’t fully appreciated how much his life had changed. No Sherlock meant no cases. And sure, that meant he’d finally get some sleep, and perhaps he could hold a full-time job, but no cases meant no running across London in the dead of night, no all-nighters at the yard.
“It happened once, but it’s not what you think, ok? Ms. Alder is a Madame of sorts. After the army, I needed money and wanted to turn other humans who were more willing than I ever was. She provided that service and needed to ensure that I knew what I was capable of in the bedroom.”
Sally felt John enter the room before she heard the sound of his footfalls. It was something that seemed indelible about how Dr. Watson was. A presence of warmth that seemed to travel around him. Perhaps that’s what caused something as cold as Sherlock Holmes to lean in whatever direction John was located. Even the most poisonous of flowers still needed the energy of the sun to survive.
“Pints?” The barman asks, already reaching for two clean glasses.
“No need to answer that,” John chuckled. “I picked up a bit of your deducing ability myself. Flushed cheeks. Heavy breathing. Pupil dilation and…” John shifted his index finger and thumb so that it wrapped around Sherlock’s wrist. “...elevated pulse. Oh, Sherlock. You’re gagging for it aren’t you?”
John feels like the world is the wrong way round, with Sherlock sounding incredibly reasonable with every point said.
“It’s just,” John retorted, “You don’t need to tell anyone who will listen about our sex life. That’s between us.”
“So...would it be fair of me to assume that you might see me more than just...any other girl?”
- down on his knees and worshipping Sherlock's stomach and pelvis with butterfly kisses and apologies that might cause a collapse of Sherlock's limbic system.
Time appears to screech to a halt. John’s words echo in Sherlock’s head, over and over, and his body is frozen. Is it true? This whole time, they’ve been longing for each other, unaware that their yearning was reciprocating. Sherlock could have John right now, if he wanted. And he does. He wants John more than he’s ever wanted anything.
He takes a step forward before stopping in place. The ripple of something frigid hits his spine and then the sound of something soft and familiar echoes in his ear. A voice saying his name. Once. Twice.
Shuddering, she let her gaze fall onto all of Sherlock’s belongings. All pristinely protected even after not being used for now close to two years. The slight scent of lemon on the wooden furniture met Mary’s smallish nose and the tiny amount of dust that John must have missed on the edge of the violin laid on the desk next to a closed laptop.
The sex toy was placed sitting up matter-of-factly on the tabletop. The cock directly aimed in John’s general direction, as if pointing out its proper owner. It wasn’t wrong. John’s phone rang out loudly, and only the sex toy on the table didn’t jump at the noise. Who the hell would be calling John now?
"Stay as still as you can," Sherlock hummed into John's left ear.
The Uber driver gives a cheery wave goodbye that John is too annoyed to reciprocate. Instead, his eyes stare at the sharp decline in his bank balance on his mobile as he stands on the pavement outside Harry’s flat.
As much as Sherlock hated repeating himself, every so often, he needed to make exceptions. Today would be one of those.
before plugging the papers back inside his inner pocket. They’ve already deviated from their drinking schedule, but oddly, Sherlock doesn’t mind. He’s enjoying the casualness of the evening.
Simple and easily constructed with enough information.
“He had such a long coat.”
The second mistake was that she turned to the left. To see the door to Sherlock’s room not fully closed like it normally was. She had been inside a handful of times. Always with John right there with her. His jaw as tight as the grip that he held on her hand, but he had granted her this piece of his past. She never touched anything. She knew that would be too much for John to go through, and so she instead observed how the man that John spoke about lived. Each hung shirt in the closet and the odd stains on the carpet told a story of a mad genius who chose to die with his pride instead of living with his shame.
Sherlock lifts up his head to see John sitting down next to him, and places a fresh cup in front of Sherlock before taking a gulp out of his own.
“He’s just yet another strange man in my house. I’m tired of being polite, it’s much more fun to wind them up.”
“Sounds like a very accommodating friend.”
No matter what the laws dividing alphas and omegas stated, John knew that right was right and wrong was wrong. He tucked his chin and shifted the omega’s -
If they can handle this in the middle of one of the most involved cases they have ever dealt with, then they can get through anything. It will take time and patience, but they always push through everything together. They can be friends, and nothing more.
There was a rustle of sound to Sherlock’s right. John, peeling himself out of the hedgerow with his hands raised.
After having most of his fight or flight military training tested in the sands of Afghanistan, John is a man who doesn't take ambushes well. He doesn’t take any type of shock well, come to think about it.
"Oh, Sherlock," John whispered as he pulled up a chair to the edge of the bed. It wasn't patronising or even chiding. It was the sound of a man who hated to see his partner hurt. "I'll fix you right up," he promised before peppering the back of Sherlock's thigh with open mouth kisses.
John frowned. Deduction pointed to deep suspicion.
To signify the point Sherlock gives a small squeeze to John’s arse with his cupped hands and enjoys the soft hum he gets in return.
A shudder crept up Sherlock's body from the tips of his curling toes inside of his shoes up to the electrical pulses coming off John's tightened fists in his curls. The heady sensation of want
He knew it was unfair to be this riled, but John’s comment had got under his skin. It had reminded him of their meeting with Sebastian, when John had disregarded him as a ‘colleague’. Did he mean so little?
Sherlock’s pulse rate was elevating and he knew that John would notice it soon. It was both the blessing and a curse of being sexually involved with a doctor. The intoxicating words were inching their way through Sherlock’s pores like slow-acting alcohol, and the buzz of it was all the things Sherlock never knew he needed until this moment.
"At the rate, we are going. We'll have adopted or gotten a surrogate for our first child by the end of the month. My brother will most likely jump out of a window about the entire ordeal, assuming that he can find a big enough window to fit out of."
“Is that everything?” Sherlock asks, barely breaking concentration. A stab of anger flashes through John’s stomach. Is that it? Six months of sharing a bed, ended in an almost business-like transaction? He’d expected — well, he’s not sure what he’d expected. Shouting, maybe? Either way, he hadn’t expected such a perfunctory conclusion. A gentle termination of their relationship as if it were a contract. Then again, this is Sherlock. He shouldn’t have expected anything else.
John. He was always
“No, thank you, that’s fine for now,” John replied, unwrapping his cutlery from his napkin and looking down at his plate. No correction? After months of letting anyone in the vicinity know that Sherlock was most definitely not his boyfriend, was he not going to correct anyone who presumed otherwise?
The folder labelled
Oh. Oh. Oh dear god. Is this actually happening?
I nod. Of course. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.
John snorts out a laugh that Sherlock can’t help but reciprocate.
All Sherlock had wanted was to understand John, and he’d…
If anything John’s expression became even tenser. His eyes darted from Sherlock to what was, more than likely, the quickest exit out of the restaurant.
Sherlock isn’t sure what he expected, but it wasn’t this. The walls are pale lilac, and on the far right wall is a king-sized bed, dressed in a deep purple spread and heaped with decorative pillows. All of them seem to practically shimmer, like sunshine on calming water. On the wall above hangs a gigantic bison skull, and Sherlock could swear that it’s the same skull that they have hung in the sitting room of 221b.
“He was going to delete the footage anyway,” John said around a dark laugh, then surged forward, closing the gap between their lips in a rush of hot air. The moan that tore from John’s mouth from the kiss alone would have shamed even the most weathered porn star. His hands, previously busy tearing the packet of lube open, now sought out Sherlock’s cock. He tried pulling Sherlock’s legs apart, but his trousers, still trapped around his lower thighs, constricted his movements.
“I might as well be naked.”
“Look,” he started over. “Let’s not do this here, right? I’m sorry about not correcting the server. No need to have that ruin our night.”
Sherlock leaned into John’s touch and his eyes fluttered shut. There was a warming swirl of heat in his belly as John giggled again.
A tidal wave of words tumble out from me and I am not able to stop it.
John grunted and opened his eyes. There was that suspicious concern that Sherlock dreaded to see.
This was becoming a habit. A quiet dance that Greg knew all the steps to, even if the music was the slow funeral dirge or a waltz down memory lane. The seventeen steps up to the flat enough time for him to make sure he had the proper footwear to cut a rug until John demanded that he’d leave.
“Fifty-six pages,” Sherlock says, the twitch of a smile appearing on his face. “Documentation on various ways of kissing you, holding you...what makes you laugh the hardest. The different shades of your eye colour when you climax...you are endlessly fascinating, John.”
His ability to shout is waylaid briefly by the preciousness of caffeine. John takes a few large mouthfuls as he meanders his way through to Harry’s sitting room and plops himself on her flowery sofa. There’s a bottle of paracetamol on the oversized coffee table, and John pops off the top and swallows three.
Before six months ago, Greg never considered that a person could still continue to move after their heart was shattered into pieces so tiny that no amount of manpower from the Yard could find all of them. Not even with the decades of experience that was shared among all of his fellow officers. Yet Dr. John Watson wasn’t an ordinary person. Greg knew this even before he had been properly introduced to John by the man who jumped from the rooftop of St Barts Hospital. His suicide note embedded in the ever-growing wrinkles of the slackened mouth of the one he left behind. A vessel lying writhing in bed. His naked form surrounded by more empty bottles and a cloud of something way too broken.
John all but threw the takeaway container overflowing with pancakes onto the table and stepped right into Sherlock's line of fire. He didn't raise his hands or show any fear. He just placed both hands on his hips and glared at Sherlock.
me. Not the one who doesn’t always understand human emotion, or who keeps fingers in the fridge. Not the one who can talk, in detail, about all the different types of tobacco ash but has no clue about the solar system. Until you.” John’s heart leaps in his chest, remembering that day. “You walked into that lab and you wanted
John gives a mechanical nod and spends the rest of his visit with Harry trying to fight the desire to grow a horrible mustache, change his name and to never ever drink again. He even feels too defeated to argue with Harry when she insists on paying for a cab back to his bedsit. As he begins to meander upstairs, however, the soldier within him catches a rustling sound coming from his
To be allowed to love John Watson.
“It’s obvious, John,” Sherlock sighed, but he could feel himself smiling. “There were a total of three people at the crime scene that early in the morning. Lestrade, Anderson and that new officer, what’s his name...Johnson.” Sherlock pointed at Lestrade and Johnson in the photo, both of them checking out the scattered evidence. “Anderson took the photo, so who else was there? Who else would have a reason to be around a dead body but leave before more of us arrived?”
John pressed the talk icon with the pad of his thumb and switched to the speakerphone option. The sounds of London morning blared through the once quiet room, and the deep baritone grumbles of Sherlock began.
John sturdies his shoulders in preparation for further argument, but Sherlock huffs out a breath before glaring out of the window once more.
“Perhaps he’s growing up,” The DI says with a shrug. “Trying to be a better person. Maybe stop trying to find out what’s wrong when...perhaps there isn’t anything wrong at all?”
It was unnerving, the unspoken longing. He’d never felt it before, and it bothered him that he couldn’t quite identify it. His brain ran in circles, analysing it to death, trying to understand what was different this time. What was different about John?
It took John a lot longer than he'd ever admit to doing more than simply exist within, or, more accurately- around, Sherlock. For nearly a full minute, it was all he could do to breathe in more than shallow gasps. But then, Sherlock's cock rubbed against his prostate, and all hell broke loose. His eyes opened so wide they nearly hurt, and he was more than a little surprised that his shout hadn't startled Sherlock. His cry had been loud enough that he wondered if the neighbours would call 999.
“Thank you, John.”
Two more pints were dropped off while Greg waited for John to order food. The crowd was growing louder by the second, and Lestrade knew that leaving would need to be happening in about the next hour.
at once. The exhale of relief on the other end of the line helped carry her through the rest of an incredibly depressing morning. Even for the likes of a morgue.
“Hey, sit down.” John’s soft voice was nudging him out of the haze, and he was vaguely aware of the phone being pulled out of his hand.
And of course, John doesn’t look flustered about that at all. He’s as self-assured in red pants and purple dressing gown as any of the other clothing that Sherlock has seen him in so far.
with Sherlock? As in Sherlock Holmes? The bloke with the head of wild black curls and the cheekbones for centuries? The lanky maniac who vowed in front of the entire assembly of the Met that after Anderson fucked half of the members of their entomology club that he would
"It's brilliant," John leaned over and kissed the tip of Sherlock's nose. "I'll wear it every day. Well.. maybe not every day. But I'll wear it proudly."
The following day is so bright and sunny that Molly can barely stand being indoors, even with what happened the day before. She paces in her kitchen with Amelia and Frieda close on her heels, the gentle sounds of their mews at odds with Molly’s stressed footfalls.
“Most people do it, I don’t understand the issue.” John had never made an effort to hide his previous partners; they practically paraded around the kitchen in their underwear. Why was this any different?
“It’s…” he began, then pressed the answer button and placed the phone to his ear. “Lestrade? I thought you and Molly were — “
I became obsessed with myself and my own insecurities, and I expected you to be everything I couldn’t. I hid you, not because I was ashamed, but because I couldn’t be proud of myself.”
“Yes,” Irene answers. “You are so much more than any other girl, darling.”
Great. Wonderful. Just bloody grand. I’m alone and sticky and spent while round #193 is happening on the floor above me. This is torture; a sexual groundhog day that I am trapped in. I need to tell John something tomorrow. This has to stop.
"Ok, I believe you about Julia but was there anyone at all that you exclusively dated before me? Anything at all serious, or that you truly had feelings about?"
“Thought you did my arse,” Harry snarks, and John throws back a confused look. “You’re a Watson, John. We’re not good with our feelings, but we definitely know when we’re in bloody love. And when we need to punch the hell out of someone too, but still. Anyway...you have to tell him exactly how you feel, all the time. It’s no use expecting everyone to understand where you’re coming from; you gotta tell them. And
Molly chokes back a laugh, and the shift in her emotions elicits a tiny shout from further in the flat. Greta, her calico cat, mews happily as she scampers over to rub at Molly’s leg with her furry head.
“But...John hated his father. Why would he have the raging alcoholic who abandoned—”
“Stay there,” John rasped. Sherlock’s shoulders stilled as John crawled his way down between Sherlock’s opened legs. Sherlock threw his head back while John lifted Sherlock’s left leg and draped it on top of his good shoulder. The sensation of the remnants of lube was brushed away, and before Sherlock could fully prepare himself for it, John’s mouth was on him with feverish dedication.

“It still smells like him,” John whispered, his clouded eyes only staring vaguely in Greg’s direction. “Why does it still smell like him? It’s fucking mad...fucking mad.”
“Yes, I um—I’ll be outside," Greg stuttered, his eyes darting around the room, trying to look anywhere but the six-foot of naked consulting detective, draped casually over the sofa. He stumbled back out of the flat, the door clicking shut behind him.
"Nothing I've said today has been out of fear."
“Missing you isn’t an everyday occurrence, John. I’m fine.”
His dark hair fell in thick ringlets that shimmered in the light, touches of auburn mixed in with the chocolate curls. John had felt its softness against the space between his jaw and throat as he carried Sherlock home and he couldn’t deny how wonderful it had felt. Slowly, he refocused his efforts and moved forward, lifting Sherlock’s head as he started to redo the head dressings. The omega’s mouth opened slightly in a soft whimper as John worked, but, other than the momentary flutter of Sherlock's long lashes, he remained still.
They were quickly interrupted by Angelo returning John’s cane, then Mrs Hudson’s fussing about the drugs bust. As the rest of the evening had unfurled, Sherlock had forgotten about the smell that had caught his attention.
Sherlock spits out the last word with a venom that usually is reserved for his brother's name. John frowns but has no real idea as to where to go from here.
“Kiss me,” Sherlock moaned. “If I forget, you know it always comes back...need your lips and your cock.
“You didn’t say my dancing had to match the tempo of the song.”
It was about a month after Mary that John began to wonder out loud. Little utterances that Martha would barely catch as she stood up to refill cups and get additional napkins. The tiny questions along with the crumbs of cake or biscuits that would scatter over the flowery tablecloth. Rhetorical queries as to what Sherlock would have thought of the most recent prime minister or the fact that Sally Donovan had been promoted. All subtle motivation to keep John’s mind moving before work at the clinic was set to begin.
Sherlock wakes to find himself in a strange place, but it doesn't take him long to put a few of the pieces together.
John rolls his eyes. “Kraig with a K, and come on you git, let’s get you up off the kitchen floor before Mrs Hudson walks in. God knows what she already thinks happens in this flat.”
“Well it would be a lot easier if you weren’t here!” Sherlock yells, making John jump with the noise. He quickly regains his balance, his eyes roaming over the detective. The sting of Sherlock’s words prickle over John’s skin over and over again.
Drama? These boys? Never.
of the pictures.
But perhaps he wasn’t a better person. Perhaps this was as far as Sherlock could evolve, even with someone as bright and beautiful as John by his side. Alone was what Sherlock knew and understood. It fit him; kept him secure and whole. Alone protected him.
John frowned at the last part of the man’s sentence. Harold chuckled again.
Sherlock Holmes finds himself in serious trouble as his heat is fast approaching, but John Watson comes along just in the nick of time.
“Almost at the spot,” Sherlock calls over his shoulder. John nods that he heard him, but his eyes are too busy looking in as many directions as possible. He doesn’t have enough time to take it all in, but he desperately wants to.
Pictures of dead and living relatives alike fell to the floor with various clattering sounds and some glass shattered, but Sherlock's only goal was to make John's mouth open wider with every move. He needed to make John come. He needed to ensure that John knew that
The bag opened with a small crinkle that had Sherlock checking his surroundings yet again. This was ridiculous; he’d never been this twitchy before. Yet, this time it was more than the odd nature of being incredibly sober in the daylight, trying to score a fast hit in a dirty alley. It was the sound of John’s voice echoing in the halls of his mind palace, asking him what the hell he was thinking.
“John, you barely say a word to me at home, you retreat to your bedroom as early in the evening as you can, and at crime scenes you spend all your time speaking to Lestrade. I may not be the best at subtlety, but even I can tell that you don’t want me around.”
Sherlock bites his bottom lip. Perhaps his research hadn’t been as thorough as he first thought, but most of the most detailed books regarding Vampirism are illegal.
“My homeless network had some information for me — a possible connected death to the serial killer case at Hampstead Heath. I needed to go and check it out.”
Molly nods for a moment before whispering a “yes, please” into the phone.
“Here,” Sherlock muttered before taking John by the shoulders and pulling him off of him with a pleasant
She sat at a desk most days now. The world of policing now regulated to tedious paperwork with the occasional burst of racing around. It was jarring at first like anything new, but eventually she got a rhythm down. Wednesdays were the only day of the week that drove her to the point of tedious insanity. Document Day, as most of the other officers, called it. The day when each of the previous week of reports needed to be reviewed and signed off by her personally. The apologetic faces of her former colleagues floated in to deposit stacks of various sizes on any empty spot on her desk they could find.
He winked once at Sherlock and gave his knee a squeeze before getting up to fetch his medical kit. By the time he'd returned to Sherlock, the other two men had left. John could hear the outside door slam shut. He gave the flat one look, drank in the shattered glass and shards of wood, and honestly couldn't blame them.
It was as if John was always by his side, and it was wondrous. The cologne helped carry Sherlock through the day when John wasn’t there, and assisted him in focusing when he began to wander too much within his mind palace. Perhaps John could sense the change within Sherlock as well. He commented on how well-rested and focused Sherlock was, even when a case wasn’t front and centre. So Sherlock decided that it was time to take the next step, even if it was yet another small one.
Irene looks simply stunning, as she always does. Today in a low cut green dress with sexy fishnets, her hair falls in a cascade of midnight ringlets and in her petite hands is an old fashioned picnic basket.
Sherlock clears his throat, and John looks away from the crowd and back into his new fiance's face. John's mouth opens up to ask what Sherlock wants when the soft pat of a hand lands on the pocket of his trousers.
Thunder sounds from somewhere above, and both Irene and Sherlock glance upwards. With a quiet hum, Irene rolls her eyes and finishes off her drink in a few quick swallows, then places the empty glass on a mirror image of the coffee table in 221b. The hourglass she’d been holding earlier stands proudly in the middle, the sand steadily pouring between the chambers. Sherlock dreads to find out what will happen when the sand runs out.
“Shit, that wasn’t supposed to happen so soon.”
proud of who he'd been before. But he'd seen the issue and had worked on rectifying it. And he'd done a good job.
“Fancy seeing you here,” she murmured, looking back down at her paperwork. “Lestrade is out on the Darby case if you were looking for him.”
And oh, his face was a sight to behold. His cheeks were tinged with pink, his neck flush with desire, and there was the most adorable line already working its way into Sherlock's cheek from where the blankets had creased. John kissed the line, swiped his tongue over Sherlock's bottom lip, then sat back and settled cross-legged between Sherlock's legs. He got Sherlock's knees settled on his shoulders, kissing Sherlock's calves as he got him situated.
As soon as the man was gone, John turned to Sherlock and slid to his knees. He reached up and fumbled for Sherlock’s belt, unbuttoned his trousers and wordlessly slid his zip down. If someone had told him four months ago that giving another man a blow job would be his go-to method to calm himself down, John would have laughed in their face before shooting them. There was a grunt and scrap of metal as Sherlock found the table and leaned against it. John waited until Sherlock had his footing, then pulled his trousers down to mid-thigh.
“How—? Nope, don’t want to know.” John shakes his head, trying to dislodge the question of how Mycroft knew what they were getting up to. If he didn’t know, it couldn’t bother him. “Why would you care?”
Sherlock wiggles his other hand out of the silk with minimal effort and lets it fall to the mattress. John sinks down next to him, turning to his side and resting his head on his hand so he can watch Sherlock’s face. He's looking up to the ceiling with his eyes open as if lost in thoughts that he can't vocalise yet. John waits until he can't hold it in any longer, even if he isn't sure how Sherlock will take it this time.
"No, I don't know," John agreed with a dip of his chin. "I can guess, based on his first comment to me and his Twitter feed. But I don't
“Jesus Christ, mate....you took at least ten years off our lives with that stunt,” Lestrade’s voice floats in the background, keeping his distance.
I could go out. Grab my keys and coat and find something to keep me busy until the men upstairs fall asleep, but this is not a sustainable solution. This is my flat as much as his, and I can’t be expected to make myself scarce every time he wants to get off. I’d never be home.
A giggle leaves John and Sherlock moans at the way the laugh rumbles through John’s chest and hips. The gentle tightening of their bodies just this side of domestic, and Sherlock is equally enraptured and terrified.
Gratefully the woman is dead to the world and her body is swallowed up in a sea of dark blue and downy soft duvet covers. Good. If John is quiet enough he’ll be able to slip out of the bed, find the majority of his clothes, and get a cab back to his hole in the ground of a bedsit before his partner for the night even wakes up.
Mycroft Holmes entering 221B was never just for a friendly visit.
With slow and deliberate motions John pulled the mobile out of his pocket and looked at the caller ID. Sherlock’s name flashed across the screen.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” John demands, taking a determined step into the kitchen. I sigh, swallowing down the last of the coffee. So, we’re doing this.
“I assumed up until I entered your home that you must have had a good reason to leave,” Sherlock continues. “So I showered, got dressed, and took a cab here…after a detour to the florist. However, after careful inspection of your room, it’s clear to me that my initial misgivings about you were accurate.”
At school, no one acknowledged that there was anything other than monogamous heterosexual relationships, and he was laughed at when, during their sex ed classes, he dared ask the teacher how same-sex couples worked. She ignored him, but the boys bullied him for it for the rest of the year. He simply didn’t exist. It was the difference between being odd, which he brandished like a badge of honour, and being queer. That was harder to subjugate with a snarky comeback or a scoff of indifference. One was tangible, an undeniable indicator of how he was unlike the other kids in his class, and one was invisible. The clubs made it easier to skitter across the surface of acceptance. Lingering looks that were meant for a night of fun helped Sherlock last through another exhausting week of keeping himself protected. No one stayed long enough to see the heart beneath, but it was a relief to be allowed to exist without the constraints of the real world. Here, he didn’t have to pretend to be someone he wasn’t.
Days move way too quickly, John can’t stop now. Not when he had come so far and dismantled so much. Obsession might as well be etched in his browlines.
No chapter count yet because we're still writing this story. Someone send us hand massagers though, these boys are really giving our fingers a workout.
what a beautiful present it was. John’s eyes were closed, and his firm hands pressed into Sherlock’s arse and holding him there. It was as if Sherlock was a prisoner in a delicious trap. Warmth and wetness was everywhere, and he threw back his head and moaned towards the ceiling.
John immediately relaxes once he sees more subtly prideful clothing. There are simple collared shirts with small pride logos along with varieties of small pieces of jewellery and neckties. He pauses to pick up a black leather belt with a slender section of magenta, purple and blue and wonders how well it might fit.
“Hey, I saw that…” John chuckled. “You should take a break, yeah? Before the tea goes cold.”
An index finger pushed at John's hole and gently slid in. Sherlock watched as John easily took it and took his middle finger in right after. All the while, Sherlock opened John's thighs even wider, lifting one leg onto his own shoulder and kissing John's thigh and bare ankle. By the time his third finger was pistoning in and out, Sherlock was almost on the verge of screams. John looked delicious spread out underneath him, chest heaving and cock achingly erect.
“It didn’t sound like you thought it was a mistake. In fact, if I remember rightly, it was you who initiated it.”
“Then you have quite the imagination, and a fine taste in Scotch.”
“I’m working, John,” Sherlock repeats, barely breaking concentration. John takes a deep breath and counts to ten. Now is not the time. He’ll just use Sherlock’s.
Unfortunately, logic and reason fly out of the bloody window when one has large navy blue bat wings attached to them. It also leads to screams. In a high C. Especially when one’s cock is still inserted in the arse of the god damned vampire who did all of this to him.
He’s caught, suspended in an invisible current, his body being thrown all over the place, but he keeps his eyes closed and his mind fixed firmly on John. Slowly, he begins to feel a tightness in his chest. It’s faint at first, a gentle ache in his sternum. As the water seeps away the pain becomes sharper, rhythmically pounding in his chest. His body lurches as each pang rips through him, and by the time he feels the first crack of his ribs, his eyes shoot open.
Mycroft used to tell Sherlock that emotions were for the logically disadvantaged. The well-organised mind was more respectable than to run afoul of feelings and all the nonsense that came with them. Sherlock recalls nodding in agreement at his older brother’s words, even if they were a stark contrast to the life of a pirate that he planned for himself at the ripe age of four and a half.
Getting Sherlock and his
“John,” he began. “I…”
“Why not? That’s the only thing that will have changed. We live and dine together. We chase down criminals for The Work. You're a bit slower but that’s hardly your fault. We tolerate each other’s siblings...so what else would need to be adjusted, other than us routinely having intercourse?”
"Good times, Sherlock," John whispered between licks and nibbles, "don't always require alcohol. This," he said while cupping a firm hand over Sherlock's groin and leaving a faint line of red on Sherlock's jaw from his teeth, "wasn't injured. So, if you're willing… I could suck you off."
“My last thought was evidently...you.”
"We're wearing too much. Strip for me, then strip me." His voice was heavy and slow like he was speaking underwater. His head swam at the notion that in just a few short minutes, Sherlock might be completely naked in front of him.
“You strangled them. Why?” John asked. Pierce responded with a quiet chuckle. John continued on. “Strangulation requires effort; it’s difficult to do and requires you to be with the victim as they died. Why not stab them, or even use poison?”
“John, he’s the only thing you’ve talked about all evening. I’m not looking for anything serious, so I let it slide, but it’s obvious you’re still hung up on him. I thought maybe you wanted some fun, something to take your mind off everything, but it’s okay that you don’t.” She reaches forward and gives him one last kiss, chaste and quick. “It takes time. Don’t rush yourself.”
"Have a phonebook?" John asked a bit sheepishly, "that might be the quickest. Just cross off the two or three that aren't on the list."
"I," John attempted to say between his giggles, "Christ, we just met... Do you sleep with all your Twitter followers?"
Next chapter is here. *fanfare and confetti and all that sort of nonesense*
“John, it’s fine.”
More wine was poured, and John was getting a little more handsy. Nothing too overt but enough for Sherlock to know that the ludicrous articles may have actually been worth reading.
Sherlock’s out then. John checks his phone, but the only message is from Greg, asking if they were okay after their outburst the previous afternoon. He sends a quick reply, purposefully not telling him how that particular argument ended. John isn’t sure where they stand now. Was that it? One more night of...whatever
Sherlock let out a shallow sigh and felt his shoulders relax.
frotting. Loved the way Sherlock’s cock felt against his, the added pleasure they both felt as their tips slid together. It was quite possibly John’s favourite thing to do, even if it did end in a mess. The mess was half the fun. “Come for me, and I’ll use it as lube,” he begged while moving both his hand and his hip to increase the tempo. “You can watch me. I know you like that when I use your come to get myself off.”
“Sherlock,” John said, so quietly that even he barely heard it. Then a bit louder. “Where is he?”
The cadaver storage racks are all in their correct places, within the mortuary shelving unit. All of them are grimly still except for one. The cracking sounds create a vibration that causes the middle shelf to tremble. A flurry of signals strike Sherlock’s thalamus and weave through to his amygdala.
The question had intentions that Sherlock didn’t know how to grasp, so he chose not to respond. That was usually the best approach in these types of moments.
I suppose I could find myself my own partner. Distract myself by pulling someone else apart, mapping every inch of their skin and learning what makes them shiver with anticipation. But no. That’s not how I work — I do not experience sexual attraction to others on a mere whim; my attractions develop over time, as I form stronger emotional connections with people. And currently, the only man I wish to take my clothes off for is currently upstairs, ripping off someone else's.
Seb gave a tight nod before he snorted up a loogie and spat it right in front of John's bare feet. “Fucking wanker," he hissed, appearing to not even give two shits that John had the barrel of a gun trained right on him. "Deserves a stab in the gut for each of my sister's tears."
Yet here John knelt, his mouth engulfing him and sliding up to the hilt. His soft humming noises created vibrations that made Sherlock’s long toes curl up inside his shoes as fought for some semblance of control.
“You and four other people at this point, I believe,” Sally sighed. Her dark brown eyes made sure that the door was closed as tightly as possible. “I only found out a year ago myself, so you weren’t the only one kept in the dark for longer than should have been.”
end up spending a decent amount of time hugging the toilet. He cursed himself for over-indulging but couldn’t find it in him to regret a single moment of it.
Sherlock looks up, his expression of muddled confusion. It’s a rarity to see anything like that on Sherlock’s face.
There’s more left to say, because there’s always more, but Sherlock is the one who speaks up first.
“I get it now,” John continues. “The reason that you told the taxi driver to stop in Soho and then you left. I knew that you needed space and time alone, but why Soho of all places, I didn’t know. It never connected until now.”
John was the first to give up his weapon, though he didn't take his eyes off of Sebastian for a single second. That is until he decided the only way Sebastian would leave here alive was if John Watson was not sharing the same air as him.
“Apparently,” John mutters. “I’m cute as a bat, and I
“He gave you all the information to find him before you ever came here, Dr. Watson, though this was one of the easiest sessions I’ve had in a while.”
It wasn’t right for any of this to be what came six months after. John rocked back and forth and Greg curled up around him. Bare skin smeared against a stained button-down and wrinkled pair of blue jeans as Greg granted John the permission to unceasingly grieve. This was becoming a habit, but never a burden. One that Greg would endure until John pulled himself into something that could survive without Sherlock Holmes.
powers?"
"As long as you are on those, I will not allow you to get drunk. But don't worry, I'm going to make you stay sober alone."
It was a stupid way to go about this; showing Sherlock’s haughtily frozen expression to a series of strangers. Their responses ranged from politely puzzled to downright put out, but John was used to placing himself into nearly unwinnable states of affairs. It was what had caused him to boldly step out of the shadows near a poolside while cradled in incendiaries. It was why John still imagined life before he took that phone call that began as a note and ended as a freefall.
“And what was the conclusion? Did you solve it?”
“Aren’t you going to try and convince me to go out? To say fuck-you to the transphobes and enjoy myself anyway?” Molly asks. She was surprised at how easily Irene had agreed to cancel their birthday plans. It usually takes more convincing to make Irene change her plans, especially when it’s because of an arsehole.
Then Sherlock is back at it with the sketch pad. His elegant hands flow effortlessly over the paper, and John might as well again be wallpaper. Well, bollocks to that.
There is a shuffle as the camera refocuses.
choose you.”
“Now then,” John goes on, now looking somewhat more pink-cheeked as before. “I’d like to ask a favor…”
“I’m actually here to see you,” John answered. “May I sit down?”
“Can you not hear that?” Sherlock hisses, his eyes scanning anywhere for the source of the noise. Irene leans over to rest her elbow on the frigid morgue table as she watches Sherlock mentally break apart into bite-size pieces. As if he is some kind of rare creature that she’s only seen in picture books.
John sniffs the air and immediately regrets it. The unfortunately familiar scent of death enters his nostrils and he frowns as he sees the DI shuffle over to him with an extra coffee in hand.
"Sherlock, it was bad, alright? Maybe not phonebook bad, but more than half my last regiment, and a good two thirds of another. It was easy, we all needed a connection, and sex was a quick way to achieve that. No one got hurt, or else no one was supposed to. I barely remember Julia. I think we slept together less than six times. She was a corporal, and that's literally all I remember. But after Mary, after I got shot, I was done. That life isn't me anymore, I swear."
We know this is a short chapter. However, this chapters sole purpose is to tease you. They meet soon!!
Sherlock frowns and looks away from those calculating blue eyes. Instead, he picks up the slide and lifts it up to the light.
Then there were the men.
The room before him is no longer his own.
“Wrapped up in the moment?” John parrots back, and he doesn’t give a damn at the way Sherlock snarls at his repeating the words. Why is Sherlock acting like this?
Sherlock sighed and pulled the menu out of John’s hands and placed it on the table, right as the server swooped in with fresh wine.
Oh boy, what do we even say to all of you besides thank you?
, before turning back to the gravel.
God, I feel faint…" He stumbled back a few steps, but John was already holding him steady.
was, of course, himself. But he wasn't about to put that out on the internet for everyone to see. No, if FuriousForensic did DM him, he'd simply give the man the number to his burner phone and let him make his assumptions.
John opens the fridge, searching for something to eat, but he is greeted by nothing but a container of blood. He doesn’t have to look at the label to know it’s human.
“Someone might want to tell that to him,” Lestrade said dryly. “Because he certainly looks pretty damn well dead to me.”
Sherlock feels his cheeks warm at the image of John hunched over in the kitchen as he comes literally face to face with the severed head on the middle shelf.
Also puzzling was another NYS member with a touching tribute written by his colleagues. Scott Bushe was the second police member in England to be found dead under suspicious circumstances in the past month. One member of the MET dead was a tragedy, two? Well, that was suspicious.
The Woman sat up a little straighter, abandoning her drink on the low coffee table in front of her and leaning forward in her seat. There was a wicked hunger in her eyes, which made Sherlock wonder how starved of a challenge she’d been all those months under Mycroft’s protection.
John hesitates, waiting for the catch. He glances over Mycroft’s shoulder to the computer screen. His reflection stares back at him. “I...I see a doctor. A soldier. A bloke who wants to punch you in the fucking nose. Why?”
Oops... my finger slipped and now you have another chapter to read. Oh darn
John raised his eyebrows the smallest of fractions before narrowing then back into the proper place. Mycroft dared not take a step into what was absolutely a sniper's shot.
The room spun slightly as John tilted his head back. Was Sherlock aware just how kissable those freckles on his neck were? Probably. He seemed confident enough in that department. Still, John was only just now becoming aware of that interesting little fact. He'd have to explore that later.
"The violin," John whispered, his face bright with visceral clarity. "The answer is his violin."
Sherlock turns his whole body towards John and slides closer. John's enraptured by how breathtaking Sherlock's eyes look at this angle. The usually ethereal shades of blue now a brighter shimmer of gold within the strands of his irises. A sunset upon an ocean wave calling him ever closer, and
“You weren’t supposed to be that close.”
familiar.”
He cast his memory back, trying to remember if John had ever called him his partner. No, not in his memory. The rational part of his brain reminded him that John hadn’t had a reason to; their friends had found out through the gossip circle that was Gavin Lestrade, and it had been less than a month since their relationship had changed. This was the first time either of them had needed to introduce the other as anything other than flatmates.
With a quick shake of his head, John cleared the questions from his mind. It wasn’t any of his business what the government did or did not do in connection to anyone or anything but himself and his career. However, with a newfound patient at his feet and an oath to always take care of those in need, there was only one thing the exhausted doctor could do.
“I’m aware of his ability to get into the heads of others. It just pisses me off when it’s done so flagrantly in my direction.”
“Calm the fuck down,” he growled at himself. His dilated pupils and cheeks flushed with arousal had no place here and now. “Calm the
He slowly peels off his clothes and crawls into bed, the blanket of alcohol heavy on his brain. He tries to close his eyes and sleep, but each time he does, they spring open again, and he is left feeling more awake than before. In the end, he settles for memorising the cracks in the ceiling, willing exhaustion to rear its head. He’s usually a master at getting to sleep, no matter the time or place. It was a residual habit from the army, one that came in useful when Sherlock insisted on staying awake for days,  himself up in the lab at Barts. John would often fall asleep on the chairs, and Molly had joked that they should build a bed in there. Even on stakeouts, John would nap on Sherlock’s shoulder, taking the opportunity to rest where he could, knowing that the next chance could be hours away.
“He... he thinks it would be best for us not to date anymore,” John blurts out, his tone rather more defeated than he had wanted.
“When we had that argument in the restaurant,” John begins, the memory of it drifting into his mind as painful as it was just yesterday. The day he’d refused to publicly acknowledge Sherlock as his partner, causing Sherlock to leave him in the cab alone and wander off to Soho. . “Back when I was still so stupid and ignorant of your feelings I…”
Except, did he? Harry didn’t think so, and she’d never met the man. He’s missing something, but he can’t put his finger on it.
The rest of the world melted away and left the two of them, suspended in time. He could almost read John’s thoughts like this, with his face soft and eyes wide open. There was admiration there, something that Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to. Most people looked at him like a circus freak, something to be amazed by, but only out of morbid curiosity. But John — John looked at him as if he were the eighth wonder of the world, not only something to be appreciated, but something to be adored.
Did Harry know?
, nor was it even his lengthy career in the Army. His sole purpose in life was to bring this man pleasure, both physical and mental.
John says the last word with an emphasis that feels almost dirty, and Sherlock feels a flutter in his chest once again.
“Yes...I mean...no. Not like that. It’s just...it’s confusing.” John sighed and turned back to the window, his eyes flickering over the passing streetlamps.
I would apologize about the length of this chapter, but when it comes to these two and sex nothing is short and sweet. You'll all just have to suffer through 5k words of smut.
Just in case anyone got the brilliant idea to call in the cavalry, John added curses and Sherlock's name to the string of sounds spewing out of his mouth. And, most importantly, "That's it, fuck me harder," so loud that even if Sherlock's neighbours were all elderly with their hearing aids off, they were sure to hear.
“Leah,” He says, and she greets him with a quick kiss on the cheek before reaching into her scrub pockets and pulling out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. They are standing at the back of St Barts, sheltered by a small glass canopy jutting out from the side of the building. It always amuses John when hospitals have smoking shelters. So you can smoke yourself to death whilst trying to heal.
“Sorry that I can’t be more useful to you,” the clerk says, his tone sympathetic. “But if it helps, I’m not very important.”
“That's before I knew the exact angle to spread your legs apart to get to your prostate on the first go."
“Do you think that Lestrade of all people would have kept that type of thing from you when you were…” Sally swallowed hard, but continued on. “...in a bad way back then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He sighed and instantly relaxed as soon as Sherlock was against his tongue. The salty skin and the faint smell of soap from Sherlock’s shower that morning eased the tension from his shoulders. Soon John’s only thought, only job, was to feel Sherlock harden and lengthen against his tongue. Nothing else mattered, not the damned redacted information or the fact that both the military and government had let a wanted fugitive slip through the cracks and make her way back to London.
“I give you a task to do at each of the bars we go to tonight, and if you are successful, you get a point. Any task you are not able to complete, the point goes to me instead.”
There were only two cameras left. Just two cameras to document the changes. To let the new routine of John Watson's environment create the necessary grooves. One camera peered around the corner, and into the kitchen. Observing the doctor as he drank tea and gin in equal measure, and the meals as gingerly handled as land mines. The second camera nestled itself in the sitting room. The angle of it low enough to catch the darkness that sunk under the eyes of the smaller man as he tapped away at his laptop. Blog posts forgotten in a hurricane of apologies and apathy, and that was for the best after all.
“My...a feather in my cap for getting you to be so polite. Should suck your cock more often, yeah? Daily, I think?”
“Sorry to spring this on you and Sherlock so last minute,” Greg mutters. His salt and pepper hair flutters in the chilly morning wind.
Sherlock glances up at the ceiling, chewing the side of his lip as if his thoughts are paining him. John desperately wants to reach out and take him into his arms, but he refrains, knowing that neither of them need that right now.
“Indeed, yes…” Sherlock admitted. He pulled off his Belstaff and placed it on the coat rack in the corner of the room before settling himself onto the long white sofa in Irene’s sitting room. “I find myself in a...questioning mindset for the past few weeks, with no end in sight, and I believe that your insight could be invaluable.”
happened and wasn't just a dream.
Mary was cunning and knew her way around medication. If she'd managed to get in the flat, even for a second, the open bottle of scotch would have been her first option for contamination. Instead, he changed tactics and went for the still sealed bottle of Black Label whiskey. He poured out a generous helping, drank half of it himself, then brought the rest out to Sherlock.
“Food
“Where the fuck have you been?”
John wonders if it is possible to go blind from staring too hard.
It was maddening and frightening in equal measure. The obsessive quality of Sherlock’s observations was barely contained, but still, Sherlock craved more. It didn’t help that John’s military cleanliness would make the occasional slip, and once and a while he would leave his jumpers in areas of the flat that Sherlock had full access to.
“More like three centuries,” John softly corrects, and his hand has returned to the middle of Sherlock’s back and
Italy was wet and warm in ways that reminded John of hasty kisses on summer nights with the women he permitted to cross the threshold of 221b. The ladies were soft in the face and chests and moaned out his name. They also asked very few questions, and only expected a fun night and a hasty next morning.
“Only two substances...or emotions, as you called them, can penetrate these walls enough to show changes. Fear we’ve already spoken about, and the other...you are seeing now. Love. You are being...loved.”
John managed to sit down quietly and Sally kept her eyes on the report. The words blended together in something that no longer mattered, but she wouldn’t cough up the truth until she had no other choice.
Abort conversation. Different topic, and fast. Before he has the chance to scramble for something else to say, John continues, “Because I miss you...a lot, and it’s nice that you miss me too and—“
The rest of dinner passed by with comfortable ease — both resuming the easy-going air of their previous friendship. Something still niggled at Sherlock, a prickling fear that he was getting everything wrong, that he had waded in far too deep. For most of the night, he kept it at bay, tucked into the far corners of his brain, but as the evening wore on it became harder and harder.
Sherlock rounded on Anderson, and Phillip took another step back.
The cab ride is silent, both men staring angrily out of the window. John wants to start again, demand that Sherlock open up for once and tell him what he's actually feeling, but he’s painfully aware that the cabbie will be able to hear everything they say. Though, he’s not sure it matters, since half of Scotland Yard knows their business by now. Still, he doesn’t want to walk home.
Lestrade wished for an hour ago when the worst thing Sherlock was taking apart was a toaster. The DI had one hand plugging his ear and the other trying his best to hear what the older Holmes asked him to do next.

“Says the man who takes bullwhips to corpses. You can hardly comment on the craziness of others,” John chuckled. “Lestrade just wants to make sure that all the bases are covered. Not all of us can be geniuses, yeah?”
"If I have to stop to tell you to stay bloody still one more time," John said as he ran his nose around Sherlock's crown, "I'll stop for good and leave you with the worst case of blue balls you've ever had. Nod if you understand."
A trembling sound much like what a man dying of thirst might cry out when finally reaching water flew out of Sherlock's mouth. John caught it and held it in his teeth whilst Sherlock could do nothing but grip onto John's hips with whatever was left of his sanity.
“What are you -- “ John began, but Sherlock continued on.
John was a powder keg, and the substance inside him was created to be left alone until the proper moment of detonation. A spark of fire to be the singular catalyst to make craters out of buildings and bodies alike. The burnt mortar and flesh to fall down like snowfall, as whatever still had the strength to rebuild began that specific task.
Sherlock wondered if he would ever be able to get used to this level of affection held up to him all of the time. It was hard to accept it, and yet somewhere, Sherlock realised that he just might be worthy of it a little more each day.
The rest of the day is draining, filled with crying toddlers and overprotective mothers. He suspects his last case, an older gentleman suffering from acute migraines, is worse than he’d initially thought. He decides to fill out the referral paperwork for the neurology department when he gets home. He’s starving, but the forms need completing as soon as possible. The NHS is slow enough as it is without him adding to the delay. Still, he needs to eat something soon, or he’s going to crash. As he’s about to step out of the surgery, he texts Sherlock, asking him to sort dinner out.
Sherlock turned his face to hide his blush and John giggled again.
“No, I want to make it clear that we are here together. As romantic partners. Just because we’re two men does not mean that this is not a date.”
“Evidently. The best way to irritate Mycroft is to ignore him. I’d suggest that we get onto more important things.”
“In the last days, all I could think about was you. Where you were, who you were with, whether you were okay. Mrs Hudson threatened to evict me if I didn’t stop pacing the floor, and I’m only half certain she was joking.” Sherlock quickly looks over his shoulder before turning back to the window. “When we were together, I thought you distracted me. There was always a part of my brain focused on you, constantly rearranging data into my mind palace. But then you left, and I realised — I wasn’t distracted at all.  Your absence defined you; I hadn’t realised how much I relied on you until you were no longer there. You ground me, John. You keep me right.” John notices Sherlock’s hands flicker at his sides as if he is refraining from reaching out. John keeps his ground, his shoulders softening slightly at the honesty laced into Sherlock’s voice. He’s about to interrupt when Sherlock continues, “I was scared, so I pushed you away. I ignored how I was feeling in the hopes that it would disappear. Because I rarely ever feel like this, and the few times I have, I ended up getting hurt. I didn’t want you to hurt me, so I shut you out. Placed you in a box that I could easily manage, and in the process — I lost you.”
“I want to be the one you use as a sex toy,” I begin. “I want to be bent over and rammed so hard and fast that I feel it the next few mornings. I want to be intimately connected with all matters of every part of your mouth and pelvis. I want your moans to etch into my hippocampus. I want your fingerprints to bruise parts of my body that only you get to touch. I want to be the one who shouts out your sexual skills to the heavens like an auctioneer until my throat goes raspy with praises. Then I want you to hold me until I recover enough to want to be fucked nearly unconscious again.”
“Did you text him back?”
They take it in turns to buy the rounds, and it’s not long until they’re back in a cab, heading to Leah’s flat. She invites him in, and it’s clear from the tone of her voice that this was her plan all along. John breathes out an unexpected sigh of relief.
Should he ask more? He barely knew what had happened during those formidable years; he’d never thought to ask. Sherlock knew enough — he deduced scraps of information by John’s habits and his reactions to certain stimuli, but they’d never had a real conversation about it.
John instructs the cab to pull over a couple of minutes away from Baker Street. His palms are beginning to sweat, and he still hasn’t decided what to say. Hell, he’s not even sure this is a good idea. His body moves on autopilot, tracing those familiar steps from Melcombe Street down to the corner of Baker Street, whilst his mind desperately tries to think of something to say.
“Don’t fall asleep on me now,” Sherlock murmured, brushing a thumb along John’s cheek.
Sherlock mouthed, and John gave an almost imperceivable nod.
Filthy promises that would have Mrs Hudson clutching her pearls. Granted, I am not sure Mrs Hudson wears her good pearls beyond special occasions, but my point still stands. John’s sex with women was just a thing that I learned to tolerate. A well-known activity that existed in the flat like random clients that beg us to take on level two cases that involve cheating spouses or missing paychecks. This, this feels different.
Showers are not much fun when you are running around the halls of your mind palace in a panic.
"Now," John's voice was still soft, almost a whisper, but there was heat in it, "you were saying all sorts of things earlier. Crazy things, insane things, but one of them… well, you said you wanted me to make love to you. Do you still want that? Because if you do, I do too."
again call me back."
Molly breathes a sigh of relief as the heavy door clicks shut behind her. She takes a step back, closing her eyes and letting her back hit the cold wood behind her. There are a few seconds of tense quiet, where the air feels heavy, the silence ringing in her ears. Then, all at once, her muscles relax, dropping the tension she’d been carrying since she left Barts. Her bag slides off her shoulder and clunks as it hits the floor, the bottle of wine she’d bought on the way home rolling slightly on the uneven floor. Her rucksack digs into her back, the water bottle inside lodging itself into the divet of her spine, but she does not attempt to move it. Her eyes are sticky and wet, and a tear carves its way down her cheek.
If John noticed, he didn’t say anything. It wasn’t unusual for Sherlock to space out after cases, exhausted by the mental expenditure and the inevitable crap he put his body through, but this — this felt different. This wasn’t his body forcing him to slow down. It was his mind, and for once in a very long time, Sherlock was frightened.
Sherlock’s friendly nature continues for the rest of the day. He opens doors for John, standing back to let him enter rooms first. He compliments John’s outfit; his choice of lunch at speedy’s; the shoes he picks out for pints with Greg. By the end of the day, John is left with a foreboding sense of dread. He knows it isn’t this easy. Something is still wrong, and Sherlock is over-compensating. Each time John tries to bring up the conversation from last night, tries to clear the air, Sherlock avoids the topic, either quickly changing the subject, or pretending not to hear John entirely.
Maybe that is why, when he enters 221b that evening, he doesn’t kick up a fuss at the mess that greets him. Sherlock is sitting at the kitchen table, piles and piles of painting supplies covering every inch of the kitchen. It looks like a bomb went off in the middle of HobbyCraft. There are canvases of every imaginable size littering the floor and worktops, and litre bottles of paint are stacked on top of each other. There’s even a collection of brushes in the sink.
“John?”
“Careful, John...I happen to be relatively fond of Mummy.”
“No, just me, I think.”
Its scent was strange in that tingley type of way that reminded Sherlock of honey bee’s dancing across his skin during the summer of his childhood. Back then, his parents cared for hives in their place in Kent, and Sherlock would help his Father gather up the honey after relaxing the bees with smoke and calming words. Every once in a while, a few of the insects would settle onto the small patches of Sherlock’s skin that the protective suit didn’t quite cover, and Sherlock enjoyed the tiny tickles of their feet as they rested.
"To make you an offer," Mycroft answered. "That will make both of our lives less…complicated."
Sherlock stood, his face becoming a blank slate, boxing away all other thoughts. The case. He needed to focus on the case.
“Sherlock…”
“Are you paying attention to what I’m saying at all, John? This is important research into the sporing reactions of—“
“Yeah, sorry. I, uh, just realised that I lost my job too. When I left Sherlock — sorry, I shouldn’t be saying all of this on a date with someone else.”
“No, but...it’s not like you to leave things like this unfinished, Johnny. I mean, even if Sherlock’s the first man you’ve dated, it doesn’t change your empathy or your morals. If he’s trying to reach out then you should at least let him tell you what he wants to tell you.”
That Sherlock was arranging clues. Putting all the relevant information in a detailed form to create a visual aid to solve the puzzle. Sherlock valued puzzles above everything else. He thrived from solving them, and the fact that John had never seen a datasheet so intricate before meant…
“Then why were you still-- “
John had advanced a step towards Mycroft as he tried to get more comfortable. The doctor’s eyes cold and hateful in ways that could penetrate bulletproof materials. Could break bones while they were named.
With that, the man turned and left, leaving John staring at more clothes than he'd owned in his entire life. A cautious glance in one bag revealed dress shirts, other trousers. Even a bag full of jumpers was similar to the torn and tattered one still on his back.
John never had another surprise party again.
She stepped into the room and felt a sudden chill. As if the iridescent eyes of Sherlock were watching every single one of her footfalls. A condemnatory specter casting deductions about her reasons for being in John’s world. Just a placeholder in a flimsy cotton nightgown and a barrage of dyed blonde waves that didn’t deserve John and never would.
“Sherlock,” John warned, a scarlet blush creeping up from his shirt collar.
Sherlock’s name echoed against the concrete walls, testing their soundproofing quality for all its might, and he just barely had time to cup his hand over his cock to keep the worst of the mess contained. With a happy sigh, he reached for the handkerchief in his breast pocket and did his best to clean up, though it was already quite obvious their dry cleaner would be cursing them out by the end of the day.
"I told Greg
Sherlock just rolled his eyes and walked away.
“For my laptop,” he answers Sherlock’s questioning look.
"Wait...what the hell did you do to the...never mind. Just call me as soon as you get this, Sherlock. I mean it."
This is true, but there’s no way that Sherlock’s about to admit that. Instead, he refastens the cuff of his pale blue button-down. The soft cotton fabric slips under his fingertips and this grants him something else to pay attention to while they head further into the countryside. The suitcase in the boot of the car is laughably small, but John had insisted on
10:15 pm: the little pub was a bit
"Wait up…" Greg stammered, "You mean to tell me that you're
The man turned around, and of all things, smiled at John. That was not what you were supposed to do when threatened with a bullet. You didn't just smile at a naked man, coated in curry sauce in places curry sauce had no right being, especially when that man was three meters away from you with a loaded gun.
“Okay then. You and me, against the rest of the world. Starting over.” There’s a moment of comfortable silence, and John counts Sherlock’s breaths, watching the gentle rise and fall of his stomach. There’s a lot of work to do, many difficult conversations to have and boundaries to create, but they’re here. Finally, they are here, and that is enough.
Their noses touch first — a precursor to gentle lips and the smallest of kisses. Molly’s spine tingles as slender fingers slide up the small of her back, and she opens her lips just enough to invite a little bit more. Irene hums into a deeper kiss as her tongue delicately explores Molly’s mouth, and Molly can tell with another shiver that Irene is being as careful as possible with her. It’s a gentleness that makes Molly want to cry-laugh once more.
John stood on Sherlock's right side wearing the black and white socks he had been knitted. There was also the beginnings of a lime green and lemon yellow scarf on Sherlock's lap that he absolutely refused to put in the boot with the rest of the mountains of yarn.
“What? That we’re in a gay bar? Really? Sherlock, you’ve been practically visually undressed by half the blokes in this bar since we walked through the door. Plus, I thought the drag queens out front would have at least been some clue.” John must see Sherlock’s cheeks redden even further because his smile widens and he adds, “It’s okay, Sherlock. I haven’t been to a bar like this since uni. It’s nice to be back.”
"Fucking hell," John swore as he rugby tackled Sherlock to the ground. He managed to get the gun out of Sherlock's hand and kicked it towards Greg's feet before Sherlock got it in him to fight back. But by then, Sebastian was at John's side, holding one of Sherlock's arms forcefully to the floor.
John reasons, ignoring that Sherlock would rather starve than ‘pop to the shop’.
"What's a Kiton?" Sherlock rasped. "What's a Kiton? Its
The erected penis had that slight curve to the left that John teased about, and when Harold swiveled it around the plump arse had an immaculately true to life anus. The pink pucker of a rosebud that John had planted kisses many times upon its living double. There even was the collection of freckles on the right cheek that John secretly adored. It looked like Orion’s Belt and the closest thing to the solar system that Sherlock would ever live with.
“Lestrade, can I have a sample of the clay from his shoe? I’ll take it to the lab and get a head start on pinpointing where the body was immediately buried. It must have been a wet area — there’s more decomposition than would have been expected. John, do you think that the cause of death was definitely strangulation? I am fairly convinced that this is connected to the rest of the killings, but I need to be certain.”
“It’s for the best.”
Although, realistically, he knows this, the sentence still takes John’s breath away. He almost strides forward and closes the gap between them, wanting to physically reciprocate the statement of affection — but he catches himself at the last moment. This is a big step. Huge, especially for Sherlock, but love isn’t a magic cure. They need more. They need the groundwork to be laid before they begin to devour each other, running on the fumes of lust.
Molly asked the question so fast that Sherlock barely heard it, but she gave him the same look she usually reserved for particularly interesting corpses. Her dark brown eyes had an intensity that Sherlock, on any other day, would admire quite a lot.
He pushed the thoughts of the case aside. He could make time for this; it was important. That was what Molly had advised, wasn’t it? Make time for John. If he returned home as soon as possible, he could upload more data before John got back. He’d have a usable spreadsheet in a few days, and he could begin to see the patterns he needed to maintain to keep John by his side.
"And you," Sherlock continued, rounding on John. "Is there anyone you
All at once, he’s hit with the full force of a realisation. He wants a second chance. A chance to admit how he feels, to live freely, without trying to convince himself he’s something he’s not. To be Sherlock Holmes, not the shadow of Mycroft.
“Of course.” She gave a two-dimensional smile. Sherlock could practically feel her discomfort rolling off in waves. Over his time with John, Sherlock had realised that most people fell within two categories; they were either inappropriately enthusiastic about John’s army experience, acting as if John had single-handedly saved the world; or they were embarrassingly awkward, never knowing what to say. Both frustrated him endlessly. The war was just another part of John, an insignificant detail that made him who he was.
So, of course, Sherlock provides a reasonable argument, and John searches for a counterpoint. Yes, Mycroft Holmes is as manipulative as anyone can get, but there is merit in what he said to John in that examination room. Merit John doesn’t want to admit. He swallows hard and leans forward.
Instead of running the shears through John's shirt as Sherlock did with his own, this time, he took small snips southward until John's chest was exposed, the material of the dress shirt ruined beyond repair. The speckling of ash blonde chest hair and darkened nipples were there to behold, and Sherlock did just that. He took time lavishing attention on each of the nipples with sweet little bites before wrapping his hand around the back of John's head and kissing him with the force of a gunshot.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock pressed, his eyes darting over the bed, almost expecting to see hidden medical equipment. There was nothing.
John’s voice was fading in and out as a rush white noise permeated Molly’s ears. Her eyes darted from side to side as she pulled out the rehearsed phrases that she’d been warned that at some point she would have to recite back.
“Congratulations,” she whispers before she begins to put the socks and sticker in a small paper bag.
John chuckles. “It’s a film and…you know what? Never mind. It’s too early for this.” He rolls over, punching the pillow and resettling himself. “New Rule, no painting before coffee.”
“With deduction…it’s
. Coupled with his own spotty recollections, blackouts must be a family trait.
He had, but not with Skin Tight and Horny. Sherlock cleared his throat before handing the drink to the young man. “You’ll need this more than me with those awful lines. If you’ll excuse me…”
Yet another very not good sign.
There was absolutely no complaint whatsoever in the way Sherlock's hands tore at John's jumper. John harrumphed happily with a sharp burst of air that made his nostrils flare. He removed his hand from Sherlock's groin and stood up on shaking legs. How was it that he'd gone from flaccid to hard in .01 seconds, like a highly modified sports car? What was it about Sherlock that made him feel like a teenager again?
“Is this about your doctor, then?” She asked, taking a sip of her own drink and leaning back into her seat, her legs delicately crossed in front of her.
“Have you even told your sister about us? Probably one of the only people who would understand the general hurdles that we are facing.”
Sherlock rolled both choices in his head and didn’t like how either sounded. Even more reason to get his data properly strategised so that John wanted to spend more time with him again.
It is delightful to hear John’s giggles at any time, but John’s giggles when completely naked and in my bed is life-altering.
"Did you give him the other tablet? He needs to have the second one when his symptoms clear."
As Sherlock approaches the bar, he gets an uneasy feeling, as if he’s missing something. The whole place feels different from the last two bars, but Sherlock can’t figure out what it is for the life of him. He scans around the room, eyes roaming over each of the patrons, but it isn’t until the bartender hands over their drinks that he realises what’s different. They’re in a gay bar.
“Exactly. Wait — you are?” John’s head snapped around to face him, a mixture of panic and curiosity in his eyes.
Sherlock sighed and considered his options. He could blatantly lie, and risk John calling his bluff, or he could tell the truth. He decided on the truth.
"What's wrong with my…" He shakes his head and gets to his feet, moving further away from Sherlock to gesture at his pitiful attempt at clothing. "No...it's the whole walking around naked all the time. Could you at least put on proper trousers once in a while?"
John's lips twitched up into a smirk for the first time that evening. He was rather proud of the glass shards and pieces of picture frames that neither of them had bothered to clean up. They were a reminder that their brief moment of peace
“Did you get dinner?” John asks, peeling off his jacket and draping it over the back of his chair. Sherlock barely looks up from where he’s typing away at the dining room table.
fun secret about their little brother.
John is left in shock, standing staring at Sherlock’s empty seat. He was constantly analysing Sherlock’s actions, he’d forgotten to take a look at himself.
“That my sexuality doesn’t define me.” John quickly retorts. He stands with his feet a shoulder-width apart, his back ramrod straight and chin raised; ready for war. He will not be belittled by the likes of Mycroft Holmes. So what if the first thing he thought of wasn’t his sexuality? He is more than that.
John’s grimace deepens as if the words are causing him actual physical pain.
“You either meant it as a compliment or you didn’t.” The words seemed pointed, but John said them with a smile, the kind of subtext that Sherlock found so hard to understand.
. I want to put the work in; I want to make this better.”
Whether this is real or just a figment of Sherlock’s dying imagination, he isn’t sure. He begins to dwell on the thought but is interrupted by Irene, continuing her musings.
“Jesus,” John pinches the bridge of his nose in exasperation.. “Relationships aren’t just sex, you know.”
"Mary and I worked together as a team for months. She was the head nurse in our ward. Knew as much as any other doctor, more sometimes. At first, she was charming, the perfect embodiment of a sweet and caring nurse. She'd dote on her patients, joke with the other nurses or doctors. Honestly, just doing what the rest of us did, making the best out of being stuck in a bloody war zone. Then she got recommended for the job with Mr Holmes. And that's when the real fun began."
“Lied? Lied about what?”
“I’d say a penny for your thoughts if I wasn’t already aware that what’s inside that head of curls is a goldmine,” Irene purrs. Her face is somewhat still in shadow, but as if she knows that Sherlock needs to see her more clearly, she leans forward, resting her chin on her hands. “Come and sit. We have a lot to go over.”
“It would take you literally a second to go and get it. I need mine.”
“I asked what’s wrong? Am I not doing what you...wait, are you in your mind palace?
“Don’t lie to me, Sherlock. I genuinely did just want to spend time with you tonight. You’ve been so locked in your head recently.”
Silence fell, and Sherlock turned back to the table. The strangulation pattern indicated that the victim knew their attacker, anonymous killers rarely bothered to hide their face. On the contrary, some liked to see their victim’s face as the life drained out of it.
“Sherlock…”
“Wait—” Sherlock gasped into John’s lips, sliding his hands down to the doctor’s waist. He slipped his trousers down, pants and all, until John’s cock bobbed free against his stomach.
“You all right?” Sherlock asks, his hand still tightly interlaced with John’s as another float goes by. This one is a shimmer of pink and gold with women of every shape, size and colour dancing in step to Lady Gaga’s
And yet, the thought won’t leave him alone.
“Of course. I think it’s time we pay him a visit, don’t you?” Sherlock reached out for his coat, draped over the lab bench, and stood, disentangling John’s fingers in the process. He pulled the coat on in one fail swoop and immediately pulled the collar up. They were close; he could feel it.
“Nothing, you’re just very drunk.” Sherlock slurs, pulling off his coat and scarf as best he can whilst lying down.
"I want you. You make me crazy." Sherlock frowned, and then looked into JOhn's bemused expression. "Am I speaking Italain?"
“You...erm...miss me?”
Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Spouse, or friend? Sherlock ran through the possibilities. There was no wedding ring, nor the familiar indentation that one would leave on her finger, so spouse was unlikely. The hand patterns on her neck were statistically too large for a woman, so more likely to be a boyfriend or male friend. He had been wrong before, but it was more time-efficient to follow that line of reasoning.
“Yeah, mind palace,” Sherlock replied absentmindedly.
Sherlock gives a passive shrug as he pulls away and begins to press soft kisses into John’s upper torso. He pauses to give extra special attention to each of John’s nipples and John grunts in approval. His hand reaches up and tangles into the dark hair as Sherlock continues his mouth down further.
no wonder Sherlock fancies you so much."
Finally, Sherlock turns to face John, and John can tell that he’s listening.
“Not letting you go until you say it back,” Sherlock says in mock annoyance.
"Problem, John?"
A crash of a chair hitting the floor stopped her question as John stood up. The book clutched in John’s left hand as if it was a lifeline as she watched Dr. Watson flee from her nest. A small bird that only just realized that he did indeed have wings and needed to use them. Where he went she would find out soon enough. For now, she would do what she thrived at best. Patiently waiting for when she was called for once more.
By the time John arrives at 221b, he is fifteen minutes behind the detective. John has no idea what state he’ll find him in, or how to diffuse the situation if he’s no better than before.
The next chapter of our story is here. The comments have been so kind that I have found myself crying in my morning coffee and afternoon tea more than once during this adventure. Thank you all who take the time to read, comment, and give kudos. Also another round of applause to my wonderful and patient beta reader SherlockWatson_Holmes for fighting off my spelling errors and grammatical woes.
“I’m fine.” Sherlock spits again, visibly recoiling from John. What had Anderson said to make him so worked up? “I have all I need here. Send me anything else you find that Anderson hasn’t ruined.” With that, he stalks off towards the road, hailing a cab as he walks.
A surge of pain floods through John, the likes he hasn’t felt since being shot, and at once, Sherlock appears to register the hurt and instinctively steps forward.
John goes back and forth about telling Sherlock about Mycroft’s visit. The pros and cons are fairly equal, but what pushes John to a decision is the knowledge that Sherlock will find out whether John’s tells him or not. He doesn't need lying by omission to be tacked onto the bevvy of other problems they are trying not to deal with. Unfortunately, Sherlock is a master of not being around when John needs him. Baker Street is empty when he arrives home, and if he had to guess, he’d say it had been empty all day. The hours feel like days as John waits for Sherlock to return, and John feels more like a pining pet than a proper romantic partner.
“Kensington. Ooooh. So you found yourself a rich one,” Harry says with a roguish grin, but the smile quickly melds into one of concern as John swallows the rest of his coffee in one large and painful gulp. “Wait...what’s wrong? Married?”
The driver gave a curt nod and began to drive. Sherlock crossed one leg over the other and sent off a few texts, two to Lestrade saying that they’d be there within the fifteen minutes, and making sure Anderson stayed out of his way unless otherwise instructed. The last text to Molly was halfway written,  requesting a second toxicology report, when Sherlock stopped at the sensation of John’s hand on his knee.
