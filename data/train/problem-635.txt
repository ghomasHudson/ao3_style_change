“John, I do hope you’re not planning to take this slow. You realize this time next week we could have a baby?” Sherlock’s hand dropped onto his leg and slid up, up, high on the inside of his thigh. “We need to have as much sex as possible, starting
I’m finally ready.
“I love you,” he whispered, and leaned in to press the words into his cheek, his earlobe, his hair. “I love you, Sherlock, so much, for so long.”
“What did you do with him, Sherlock?” John demanded, breathing hot over Sherlock’s pulse point, his hands wandering over Sherlock’s chest. He thumbed a tight nipple through the thin fabric of Sherlock’s shirt. “Tell me.”
"Fine, mine first. The three of you are getting whatever the hell I choose to give you, but Sherlock, what would you like?" he asked, slinging an arm around the back of Sherlock's chair. Sherlock looked up at him, unsure, maybe thinking there was a right and wrong answer. "Scotch?" he offered to throw him a bone.
Sherlock’s head slammed back against the refrigerator door and groaned in a wreck of pain and pleasure at the ache in his skull, the slide of his expensive black boxer briefs down his legs, John’s hot breath on his cock. He looked down,

"It must be a bit awkward for you, knowing Watson's sucked half the cocks in this room," Bill said with a barking laugh, slapping Sherlock on the shoulder. John winced and moved double time, sloshing a bit of lager on the floor, but Sherlock surprised him by dishing a bit of his own back.

“You’ll do, I think,” she said, bringing her hands up to cup his upper arms. Her chin twitched with a suppressed smile. “He won’t be able to keep his eyes off you.”
“Do it,” Sherlock whispered, leaning in to nudge at John’s nose with his own.

“Mrs. Hudson leads me to believe that there are certain expectations to be met when hosting Christmas for family. We have only a week to prepare. I hear we’ll be needing a tree and decorations, yes?”
As soon as Sherlock padded into the kitchen, hair damp and in fresh pyjamas, his eyes snapped to John, then flitted around the flat: half-empty boxes, stacks of unfiled papers, headphones on the bison skull. Without a word, he moved to a pile of boxes by the sofa and opened the top one, removing handful after handful of (probably stolen) police files.

"Fine. Sure." He pushed away from the table and stood, gathering the dishes from Sherlock's place, because of course Sherlock hadn't bothered.

“We’ll see,” he said.
I didn’t acknowledge that part of myself again for a very long time. Repressed is probably a gentle word for it; I forced everything into the darkest basement of my mind palace and locked the door. It didn’t work forever, but long enough for everyone to make their assumptions. Long enough for me to convince myself it didn’t exist and never had.
. I’ve only dated the one man, but my experience is broader than that might suggest, and I am certain that no woman will ever win my heart. Such as it is. That is why Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson made so many comments at the start of our association. Not because of anything they saw in you, but because they’ve always known my orientation, despite their ignorance of my romantic history. And when you showed up, when you stayed, they... assumed.

John was quietly thankful for the tiny kitchens in both 221A and B; It was hard to get away from a gathering in one’s own home, but if Sherlock felt the need to leave Lestrade’s they could get away without much fuss. Memories of Mrs. Hudson’s late husband and the drugs he built his empire upon brought back urges from a darker time in Sherlock’s life, he’d confessed obliquely. He’d been fidgety all evening. Couch. Laptop. Violin. Microscope. Violin again.

Go out somewhere where everyone will assume you’re queer. Go to a gay bar with a friend you can trust. I can recommend you a few coffee shops and bookstores in Vauxhall, or if you want to get farther from home I can send you to Islington or Camden. Just… get used to being thought of as gay before you put all that pressure on your relationship with Sherlock. You have a lot of baggage, and I’ve gone through this with a girlfriend before. It exploded in my face. No matter how much you love him, no matter how much you’ve thought about it and wanted it, being gay in the real world is…

“SHERLOCK!” Mrs. Hudson shouted up the stairs. “GET DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!”
Sherlock scowled, but swept his thumb over the back of John’s hand, not yet ready to let go. “Mummy was the mastermind behind this, you know. Meddling is one of our time-honored family traditions, and she’s the worst of the lot. She’s orchestrated all this as a method of prying into my life, so she can interrogate everyone I know and study my interactions with them.”

He pitched his voice low, pressed his hand ever-so-slightly into the softness of John’s jumper, and waited for a reaction. His own heart rate spiked, and his fingers tingled with the warmth of John’s skin beneath his jumper, though he kept his breathing under perfect control—right up until John slid an arm around his waist and drew closer, pressing their bodies together along their flanks. John chuckled warmly, perfectly timed to cover the hitch in Sherlock’s breathing.

He turned Sherlock’s hands over in his instead, and returned light kisses over Sherlock’s fading burn scars.
I just need to deal with all this stuff before I can
We’re so close to having everything out in the open. We’re almost free.
A warm rush of elation fills Greg’s chest, presses behind his eyes, and dear God it’s a good thing they’re trying to keep this quiet or he’d be crying at a crime scene. He wants so badly to ask a hundred questions, to laugh and hug them and shake them for taking so damned long, but he clears his throat and chokes it down.
And went with half my life about my ways.
I hope that means he wants this with me
“It was recommended to me. The woman at the shop called it…” he hesitated, felt his cheeks heat a bit. “…full-bodied and seductive. Perfect for a night in.”
I always knew in the back of my head that I didn’t really love her enough. She was fine, at first. It was comfortable. It was what I thought I was supposed to want, and it wasn’t anything special, but it was… fine. She met me when I was still a complete mess, a walking shell of a person. I know we don’t talk about that time when you were gone, but I just had no idea who I was without you. I felt like I’d had limbs amputated and my brain couldn’t process the new shape of my body. Maybe that’s too much. I’m saying too much right now. This is a whole other topic. But the point is, I married her for all the wrong reasons, then was horribly unhappy and bitter that I couldn’t have the things I really wanted, that I was trapped in a life I didn’t want, not really, but one that I chose and vowed to keep anyway.
None of them were John.
None of this excuses anything I’ve done. And I’ve done a lot. I have a lot of things to say to you, or write to you. I just need to know that you’re open to hearing them.
Sherlock said nothing as he slid his card across the checkout counter, but the corner of his mouth turned up in a tiny, private smile.
...please tell me you aren’t planning to jump off any buildings
I’ll end by quoting John from Chapter 83 of the fic: “If there’s anything you’re hurting over, anything that makes you be cruel to yourself, please take care. Be honest with the people in your life. Sherlock and I, we’re not perfect. We still slip. But we’ve come a long way. Get help. Beautiful things can come of it. Healing is possible.”
That’s it?
John snorted. “You know, for a genius you can be really thick sometimes.”
He sipped half-heartedly at his soup while John shoveled risotto into his mouth, scrolling through their Netflix queue until he finally gave up and put on a Bond film they’d both seen at least twice. It was only for distraction anyway.

: Mr. Holmes, how were you able to determine the link to the other veterans and the drug ring?
"On the contrary, I appreciate you all training him up so I can reap the benefits. You may have had a few quick, sandy blowjobs years ago, but I'm the one who gets his full talents for the rest of my life," Sherlock said smoothly, with a wicked grin to top it off.

“Let’s call Mycroft, then,” Sherlock breathed. “He can take care of it.”
Why did you have to? You need to tell me
John has done an admirable job of controlling his drinking. With so much to celebrate he was tempted to break his sobriety, but never did. He has set a goal of staying sober for another month before reintroducing supervised light social drinking. We did not have much to discuss regarding his anger management techniques, as he’s been riding on a high of positive life changes. Moving out of the house he shared with his ex-wife has proven to be the only challenge to his anger, but he’s largely tackled that task alone while Sherlock cared for Rosie at 221B, so he’s been able to take his time, work through each moment, and move on. John promises that he and Sherlock are keeping each other honest in their recovery and have been working hard to establish good communication habits.
With respect,
Sherlock paused with his coat half-on. Restless, full to bursting, a failed pressure valve leaking into the world at an alarming rate.
If he ever wanted a chance with John…
“And, speaking of yours…” John picked the envelop up of the bench and slid it across the table. “There is absolutely no rush to make this decision, but Mycroft had Mary sign the papers today in case… you wanted.”
I think it was a bit of both with you. I was obvious, which put dad on high alert for any sign of it from you. You were more subtle, but you were definitely a bit too into your evening runs with tyler mackinnon, you know?
He was so focused on Sherlock, on the potential of the moment, that he nearly missed the call.
Sherlock launched himself from the booth and swept his coat over his shoulders, rocking impatiently from foot to foot as John followed, careful to bring the parental paperwork with them. He waved to Angelo on the way out the door, who called to them, “Done already? No more tonight?”
Sherlock charged off the Victoria Line train and into the holiday crowds, guiding his parents to the Greater Anglia Line transfer point. Their transfer had been a few minutes off and the Greater Anglia train had likely already arrived, of-

Sherlock contemplated the mulled wine simmering on the small hob, thinking of a different bottle of wine, secreted away under his bed back in 221B. A trial run might be in order. He hadn’t yet considered how to present the wine, how to proceed after it was given. He had only two days left. Two days before everything changed, one way or the other. For better or for worse. Best to test the waters a bit.
“You understand how dire the matter is, then,” Sherlock replied, turning his lips to John’s jawline, brow, cheek,
Mrs. Hudson laid a hand on John's shoulder. "Oh, I thought it was silly at first, but it's actually quite interesting! It's called “The Five Love Languages”, and it's about how everyone has a particular way they prefer to receive love."

I’m gay too, Sherlock.
[Written in black pen on the back of a cheaply-printed pub menu. the handwriting starts sloppy and gets sloppier]
No letters stabbed into the mantle. No art on the walls. No skull.
Sherlock spun the stem of his wine glass between his thumb and forefinger, watching the wine form a tiny whirlpool inside. He smiled, a tiny, sad quirk of his lips, and shrugged.
“You know, you could just spend quality time together at home.”

I have no idea how to start this letter. You’re dead. You’ll never read it. It’s for me, not for you. But I have things I need to say before I can move on.
Sherlock is happier and healthier than he’s ever been, as different as can be from this time last month. Despite that, we actually had a hard time getting started with our discussion today; Sherlock sat down, calm and cool as usual, but he avoided my eyes in a way that initially concerned me. I tried asking how he was, but I got no response other than a brief fluctuation in his expression. When I asked how John was, though, a tactic I’ve had to use many times in the past, his whole demeanor changed. He flushed, and his calm melted away into the biggest, brightest grin I’ve ever seen on his face. He hid his face in his hands again, as he did last week, while he attempted to get his composure back.
“I never claimed to be one of the nice ones,” he said, his voice pitched in a low rumble that he knew had an occasional effect on John. And it worked—a pause, then increased respiration and heart beat, a shift, impossibly closer.
Sherlock gritted his teeth and barely suppressed a snarl.
A pause. John bit the inside of his lip, felt hot tears in his eyes but let them stay.
I’ll rescue you
John vowed never to put his hands on Sherlock in anger again.

Sherlock huffed a laugh and finally won his battle with John’s fly, slipping his hand inside to cup around John’s hard cock. Above him, John sucked in a hard breath and rolled his hips, and Sherlock grinned, leaning up to murmur in his ear.
“You’re not just… saying that to get me to stay?”

Sherlock wove his fingers into John’s hair and pulled him in for another kiss, stopping just short of contact.
Direct, to the point, but not overly pathetic or begging. John had already been at Harry’s for nearly twelve hours. Surely that was enough to fulfill his familial obligation. Sherlock’s need was obviously greater. The phone chimed.
Maybe if he’d had time to go home and process, to lie in bed and replay every moment of the not-date and analyze, he could have unearthed some usable data.

John lined the mugs up perfectly straight on their shelf, plugged in the kettle, and left the flat with a messy combination of relief and unease. Leaving Sherlock alone, even for a few minutes, set John’s heart racing—
I liked that photo, berk. You really do hate that hat, don’t you?
At least cowardice has an answer.
John pursed his lips and looked down into his cup again, clenching and unclenching his fist under Mrs. Hudson’s gentle touch. He took a deep breath in through his nose, then another, before finally meeting Mrs. Hudson’s eyes.
Mrs. Hudson snatched a magazine off a side table and swatted him with it, herding him toward the door. “You could roll around in a dumpster and he’d still have it off with you in a heartbeat. GO, you ridiculous man!”
“I can’t blame him,” John said, leaving Sherlock’s chest alone just long enough to trace a thumb over his bottom lip instead. “This clever mouth of yours is a daily torment. So you sucked him off, yeah?”
Creepy, but appreciated. Thanks, Mycroft.
John huffed an unamused laugh and propped himself up on one elbow.
Liam threw his arms around Sherlock's neck for one last hug, and Sherlock's arms wrapped around his waist with easy familiarity. When they parted, Liam drew a business card from his pocket, kissed it, and tucked it between two of the straining buttons of Sherlock's shirt.
The whole thing was so revoltingly, sickeningly normal and unassuming and completely indifferent to the drastic and glorious change in their lives. Sherlock didn’t want a fuss, but
A swell of pressure bloomed beneath Sherlock’s breastbone, a rush that was quickly tamed by the sound of John’s footsteps on the stairs. A sudden calm washed through him, fed by the remembered warmth of John’s hands on him for years,

“And after?” Sherlock asked, remote, retreating behind his mask.
John’s gaze caught on the golden sticky sweetness glistening on Sherlock’s fingers in the evening light and felt the breath evaporate from his lungs. He burned with the need to touch Sherlock, to take his hand as they walked among the beehives, to draw him close, to kiss the sweet honey straight off his lips and taste it on his tongue—
"Just thirty seconds, Sherlock. Stay there." And up the stairs he went, snatching the small bag from the back of his sock drawer and thundering back down a moment later.
John looked up from behind his hands, brows drawn. “Well, that’s helpful.”

Which brings us, as always, to John. Sherlock has been aware of the nature and depth of his feelings for John for years, but his conversation with Greg helped him admit things that he wants for himself: to be a husband to John and a father to John’s daughter. Even now, he appears quite bashful, almost ashamed, to want these things. When I asked whether he’d spoken to John about his feelings yet he said no, but blushed and hid his face as a smile started to take over. Apparently John asked him to have dinner tonight, alone, and Sherlock is doing everything he can to avoid getting his hopes up, but he’s nervous, excited, and happier than I’ve ever seen him. He attempted to present me with another set of notes on the pants and shirts he owns and their associated effect on John, but patient confidentiality prevents me from getting involved to that degree.
Oh god.

Sherlock tugged at John's belt buckle, not actually undoing it, but making his intent clear.
What was that?
Noise complaint
Sherlock has requested that we reduce our visits from once per week to twice per month while he adjusts to the greater share of childcare duties and enjoys the early days of his relationship. I broached the topic of couples therapy with him, suggesting it as a way to ensure a strong start for him and John, and he was amenable. I will bring it up with John in his session and schedule them for next week if he agrees.

Neatly dressed and groomed as always, though tired around the eyes
Sherlock’s glare was ferocious.
I was only teasing, all those times I mocked your writing. Mostly. I apologize. I do respect you as a writer, and I want your words in whatever way you want to give them to me. Your silence is far, far worse
“Everyone’s entitled to be a bit shit when they’re first coming out,

Good night, Sherlock.

With the ice broken, we were finally able to discuss his feelings about his new relationship with John, which is in his words "better than I ever could have hoped for". It appears they are off to a healthy start, and the relationship certainly seems to be having an incredible positive effect on Sherlock’s mental health. He is excited about life and looking forward to the future, which is perhaps the biggest change of all: He believes he
Just the tip, and John already felt like passing out.
Another box contained a truly Sherlockian assortment: pot lids, handcuffs, safety goggles, litmus paper, a centrifuge, and three tiny jars with a single dead bee in each. He put the handcuffs back in their customary drawer, added the safety goggles to the pile on the table, and shoved the box into a corner.
I miss you. I miss you all the time, and all I want is to move back to 221B with you. It’s always been the place that feels the most like home to me, and I want Rosie to call it home, too. I want you to mean home to her, like you do to me.
It takes a second for Greg to process, then a flood of shock forces the air from his lungs in a huff of laughter. “Since you

Sherlock’s head swam as John mouthed at his cock through his thin suit trousers. His belt was gone. When had that happened? His mind was a complete disaster area: memories from the stag night, images of John on his knees in the sand enthusiastically sucking off a faceless man in uniform, and blinding, overriding pleasure as John tugged his zip down and dipped a thumb in to swipe at the head of Sherlock’s leaking cock, then pulled back just enough to lick the flavor from the pad of his thumb.
Stop it

“I say it’s an occasion worth toasting, my dear. Shall we?”
“Actually,” he interrupted, a bit sharply due to Mrs. Hudson’s elbow jab. “I was just telling Mrs. Hudson that I found a new restaurant I think you’d like. I made reservations. If you don’t have anything on tonight.”

“Boys, honestly,” Mrs. Hudson begged. “It’s not right to be so cross with each other this close to Christmas. Can’t you just—”
You really don’t want to know. I don’t know how I managed to stay in denial this long.

Then he sat bolt upright.

The breath caught in Sherlock’s throat, and he clattered to a halt, this thumbs hovering over the keys. The icy air bit at his cheeks, burned them a rosy pink. Finally, he replied.

“Yes,” Sherlock whispered, again and again. “Yes, John. Gorgeous.”
“Your mother told me to put on a particular song from The Nutcracker and watch what happened,” John said between gasps of laughter. “She said you did ballet for years, that you were really good, could have been pro, and that they always made you play Fritz every year even though—”
“Oh, that’s all, is it?”

Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but Mummy interrupted the impending rant with swift efficiency. “It’s a little last minute extra something for Mrs. Hudson, dear. Do reminder her to open it as soon as she gets home, will you? It’s quite an urgent gift.”
John told himself.

<<<Begin Summary>>>
I’m so proud of how far you two have come. You have a beautiful family.
John thought, mentally tying a noose for himself. But Sherlock froze, pipette in hand hovering over a dish, as John's words finally sank in.
When their eyes met again, Sherlock pressed his lips together, then spoke.
"What?"
Third chapter for today. One more on the way, and it's a treat! Much more substantial, too.
So you’re gonna go for it with him?
John reached out, slowly so as not to startle Sherlock, and brushed the sweaty curls off his forehead. Sherlock tracked the movement with his eyes, then let them fall shut when skin made contact—feather-light, tentative.
“But—” Sherlock started.
“My parents were quite traditional. They filled my head with all kinds of rubbish. Took me years to clean it all out. I’ve really only come to terms with things… quite recently.”
Sherlock loved him.
I hope I haven’t made things awkward by revealing this, but your incessant harping over The Woman is tiresome in the extreme and I would like for it to cease immediately.

Sherlock’s eyes fell shut, his lips parted in a silent gasp, and John’s cock twitched.
Fine. 9pm. See you later.
Then John grabbed Sherlock by the hand, spun him around, and kissed him with one hand on the back of his flushed neck. A shocked groan rumbled in Sherlock's throat, then his hands came to rest on John's hips and pulled him close. John deepened the kiss as soon as he felt Sherlock respond, made it filthy and possessive and
Mary summoned a half-hearted sneer that nearly masked the trace of pain underneath. “We’ll see. Have a nice life, John Watson. You’re welcome for the daughter.”
If I’m really honest, I was miserable within a month of marrying her.
John’s other hand disappeared from Sherlock’s stomach, and Sherlock immediately mourned the loss of contact—until both his arse cheeks were suddenly gripped tight and spread open, exposing him completely.
/ 12:02 PM
John closed his eyes, clenched his jaw, balled his fists, took several hard breaths.
It was one of the best nights they’d had together.
“Mm. Yeah?” John breathed, savoring the tension, the
Rating will go up very soon. You have been warned. The chapter with the higher rating will be clearly marked so you can skip it if you prefer.
Sherlock would not be so easily dissuaded, though, so John deployed one of his recently acquired distraction techniques: physical contact.

The end.
He said it breezily, as if it were a simple fact that hardly mattered, but John saw through the front. Sherlock held himself stiffly, uncomfortable.
I’ve been in love with him for so long, Greg
An enormous C-17 thundered across the sky, right over their heads, blotting out the emerging stars. Sherlock locked his eyes on its vast gray body, opened himself up and poured…
“You are the rest of my life,” he repeated back.

They smile brilliantly, more at each other than at him, and turn to the curb to hail a cab. The ever-present magnetic pull between them has never been stronger, the effort to keep their affection from showing clearly visible in the lean of their bodies and the softness around their eyes. Greg can’t wait for Saturday, for the world to know what he’s known all along: that Sherlock Holmes and John Watson belong together, will
Because just as their eyes met over the honeycomb, they got a call.
Unless you’re angry with me, I suppose.
“What about you? Not gay?”
"Car to my location for transport back to Baker Street. Now."
John thought.
“Let’s go home,” John murmured. A shiver went down Sherlock’s spine as John’s warm breath ghosted over his ear, and he tightened his hold, pressing John closer to ease the ache in his chest.
His chest cracked, spilled gasps and pain and surging sore heat behind his eyes as he stumbled through the kitchen, back to Sherlock’s bedroom, to Sherlock, to
And Sherlock Holmes, with his flat full of sealed boxes, with his bullet hole and lingering burn scars, was almost certainly in love with John Watson as well.
“If that man doesn’t sweep you off your feet on Christmas morning, I shall turn absolutely monstrous,” she said, a hint of teasing under the ferocity of her words.
It’s fine, though. It’s all fine.
Iain pursed his lips to hold in a laugh, and Sherlock winced.
(The DI gestures to the two men seated at his left)
I was so obviously taken with him right from the start and it’s quite funny, in hindsight. My first impressions were correct in some respects. Sherlock is absolutely rude and arrogant, though he no longer looks twelve years old anymore, and he clearly has the posh boy public school thing going, though he also wallows on the couch in his dressing gown for days and refuses to wash a dish. But above all he is absolutely likeable and charming, fascinating, a bit of a mystery. My madman. My Sherlock Holmes.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Does it ever feel like that to you? the dad block thing?

Mornings at Baker Street, Sherlock’s curls spread over his pillow. Afternoon tea with Mrs. Hudson, his daughter making a mess of the biscuits. Cases, adrenaline, Sherlock running by his side. His child in Sherlock’s arms. A family.
Together, they slept.
With no protest from Mary, the solicitor began handing the forms over one by one. From his place against the wall, Mycroft explained the procedure.
“I took your spare key,” she said with studied ease. “Hope you don’t mind,
crazy,” Sherlock said, voicing his worst fear with a grimace. His fingers twitched in his pocket.
“Do you still…?”
[Unintelligible] don’t matter. I’ve done bad things.
Sherlock tightened his hold around John’s waist until they were flush together, until Sherlock could feel John’s heart beating against his. He took a breath, squeezed his eyes shut, and confessed into the curve of John’s neck: “I love you too. Always have.”

Perfect.
This is my last letter, Sherlock. The last thing I have to reveal. Then you’ll know everything.
Lestrade entered with a bottle of wine, which John and Sherlock latched onto with a hint of desperation on both their parts. Sherlock stayed unusually quiet, so John stuck close, hovering at his side and murmuring a running commentary of the unusual dishes as they appeared according to Jane’s barked orders. Sherlock’s low, rumbling chuckles did just as much to warm John as the wine, though the vee of exposed skin at Sherlock’s throat may have been a contributing factor. By the time took their seats, John was once again dizzy with that same hazy intimacy he’d felt at dinner last week.
Lestrade is attempting to be all commanding. John is better at it.
Yeah, stopping now is probably smart.

“I think I knew you before we met,” John blurted over Chinese food the next night, his hand curled around hidden powder burns.
“Mycroft was named for a ferret,” he spat out, then fled the kitchen.
. Yes, absolutely, he would. He believed, would never doubt John again. Sherlock leaned down and captured John’s lips in a lingering, tender kiss, pouring every ounce of his years of waiting and wanting into every slide of their lips.
Sherlock’s cheeks burned, though it was almost entirely due to the unimaginably perfect fit of John’s thumb in the hollow of his hipbone. He remembered the dancing, now. Hadn’t thought of it in years.

“Are you sure that’s what you want? We’re… I don’t know if you…” He paused, regrouped, took a breath. “Mary and I need to divorce, and I’m going to have a baby with me, probably, unless that was a lie too. I’m a package deal now, and I know that’s… complicated. And if I come home, I want to be completely free of Mary. Nothing else standing in the way, and… and I want you to want that, too. So. If you don’t then just—”
“Was this your first attempt?” he finally managed to ask.
Sherlock hauled John against him and slanted their mouths together, tracing his tongue along John’s bottom lip so he could dip inside, slide his tongue hot and demanding against John’s until they were both hard and gasping. John ground against him and let out a stuttering moan at the feel of their cocks moving together for the first time.

“Because you’ve been through enough. The both of you have been through
And as John fell to his knees on the kitchen floor, one thought occurred to Sherlock in a moment of crystal clarity:
Of course, John
John squeezed his arm, and Sherlock refused to open his eyes again until the echoing footfalls reached the top landing. His hand twitched and jittered at his side.
Maybe he needed to hear it.
: Our personal lives are not open topics for this session.
John stood from his chair and puffed his chest out, his eyes hard and wary.
They’d pick them up in the new year.
“I thought so, at first. Then there was Irene, and Janine, and I also wondered sometimes if you just… didn’t do that sort of thing. Asexual, aromantic.”

. What am I supposed to think?”
Every sibilant drawn out, melodic cadence. His body language liquid and casual, his hip cocked out to the side. John folded his arms and strangled his own bicep to keep from reaching out, dragging Sherlock back to him and away from his grabby, grindy ex-friends.
This is the second update for today. Make sure you caught chapter 19!
“No,” Sherlock rushed to assure him. “Well, it’s just brain chemistry now, just a withdrawal symptom. My brain is saying it wished I succeeded, but I don’t want that. Now that I have the option to live, I don’t want to die. I don’t
"Well, it seems to me that you've been trying to show him through acts of service, but that's apparently not his love language. Perhaps you should try something else."
Kind Regards,
“Sherlock, dear!”
Sherlock lifted his head and looked at John with those wide eyes, so achingly hopeful and resigned at the same time, and John’s heart gave a painful throb. They needed to move forward.
Dishes passed and plates filled, piled high with too many kinds of potatoes and some kind of crunchy green bean concoction. Jane dominated the conversation, which was just fine with John. He sat back and ate, watching Sherlock from the corner of his eye for any sign of discomfort. The food on Sherlock’s plate melded into a pile of unfortunate colors and textures as he pushed it around listlessly.
"You. Someone who knows you who won't constantly call him a nutter for staying with you."

“I’m knackered,” John said, startling Sherlock out of his fantasy. His eyes snapped up to John’s, which sparkled with amusement. “And we still have a lot to do before your parents arrive tomorrow evening. Want to finish this round and head home?”
By the halfway point, I could tell they were holding something back. I prompted them a few different ways, to no avail, until I finally reminded them that I’m not here to judge, and I can’t help unless I know the facts. Sherlock, who makes his living by the value of facts, seemed to take this to heart and blurted out: “We’re getting married and I’m adopting Rosie. In three months.” Then he winced and glanced at John. “Sorry.”

“So what do you do?” John asked.
John shook his head ruefully, but he laid a hand on Sherlock’s leg and looked at me without any shame or hesitance. “I know it’s fast. But this is what’s right for us.” (“Fast? It’s been
John's bright smile turned wicked, and he murmured his answer directly against Sherlock’s mouth.
"No, come on, Johnny, it's been so long. Stay for one more drink, my round!"
“I do,” Sherlock cut in. “I do, John.”
“I think we’re done here,” Mrs. Hudson said, and snatched his barely-touched teacup away. “You march yourself upstairs right this instant and put this nonsense to rest. Leave the baby monitor with me. The two of you have waited long enough and it’s time and I’d like for you to get on with it before I die, please and thank you.”
“I’ll go change,” he said, and drifted back up the stairs without another word.
John let out a harsh breath and leaned up to nuzzle their noses together, his eyes closed, his watery smile the sweetest thing Sherlock had ever seen.
John dropped his bag and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, burying his face into Sherlock’s scarf, and Sherlock’s beating heart cracked right open. He breathed in, and with it came the story of an afternoon, of crowded trains and fresh bread with dinner, of Harry’s messy flat and Tesco-brand shampoo, of John, of

John in his sessions, the absence was somewhat alarming.
It was Christmas Eve. Tomorrow was the day. Perhaps it would be beneficial…
The question and her sudden attention seemed to catch Sherlock off-guard, but he nodded. “Yes. Once.”
Sherlock shook his head, but wouldn’t look up.
Since when do I ever listen to him?
John smiled into the kiss and ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls. "This is not how I thought this night would end."
Today will be a two-chapter day! Check back later this afternoon or evening so you don't miss the second update.

Lestrade clapped him on the shoulder, and Sherlock whirled around just in time to see John’s eyes snap back up to his face, then over to Lestrade’s. The two exchanged pleasantries, laughed heartily about something or other, but Sherlock’s brain was fixated on that single moment, the briefest second where John’s eyes slid up to his face after lingering significantly lower.

The facilitator was very thorough and his comments (attached) are promising. Between the course, our work together here, and his acceptance of his sexuality, I feel that if John can continue on his current path he will be unlikely to repeat his past violence, though we will continue to incorporate anger management into our regular sessions and watch his progress carefully. He broke down in the middle of our review when the topic of his past violence toward Sherlock came up, and he admitted to an ongoing struggle with negative self-talk regarding those incidents. "I know where it came from now, but it doesn't excuse it. Even if he forgives me, it'll still be a while before I forgive myself, I think." He acknowledges the need for self-compassion in this regard, and will continue to work on it. He’ll need some practice putting his new tools to use in everyday life, but I believe he has the support he needs from friends and family to stay true. He is not at 100%, but he has worked hard over the past month, has been honest and committed. I believe he is on the road to long-term recovery, and is in a position to begin a healthy romantic relationship. He thanked me for my help, and by the end of our session he was laughing through his tears. "I can't believe I'm doing this. It's really happening. I'm actually taking Sherlock Holmes out tonight." He laughed again. "I have...
Christmas Eve morning dawned cold and Johnless, and it quickly went downhill from there. By ten in the morning, Sherlock was in full-on sulk mode, flopping about on the couch like an extremely grumpy fish out of water while his parents insisted on stirring their tea with bright good mornings, sitting in chairs with chipper conversation, and watching Christmas telly with joyful laughter.
After a moment of blissful silence, John braced his hands on his knees and hauled himself out of his chair, then picked up a packed duffel he had stashed by the front door earlier that evening.
John smiled, just a small thing, and squeezed Sherlock's arm once before letting his hand drift to the small of Sherlock's back to guide him out the door.
"Let me think for a moment... there's words of affirmation," she said, ticking each one off on her fingers, "gift giving, acts of service, physical touch, and quality time."
A hand landed on his back, rubbed a comforting circle, then Mummy’s cheek pressed into his shoulder.
Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock caught the quirk of a small smile at the corner of John’s mouth. “All right, Sherlock. I’ll stay, if you’re sure you want me to.”
“I’m going to get you some buprenorphine. It should help with the worst of the symptoms,” John said.
Molly sighed at him, then took a long drink of wine and squared her shoulders. “You’re right. I’ll show you how it’s done, then. Good luck, Sherlock,” she said, then spun around and strode straight up to Greg where he stood talking to the group that now included Stamford and Bill Wiggins. From the kitchen, Sherlock watched her lean up to kiss Greg on the cheek and wish him a happy Christmas, then skillfully maneuver him away from the group conversation so they could talk privately. Her hand lingered on his shoulder, then his elbow, then his hip. It was a matter of minutes before Molly leaned up to press a gentle, chaste kiss to Greg’s lips, which he happily returned, a blush high on his cheeks. They soon rejoined the group conversation with their arms wound around each other, glowingly happy and in cheerful spirits. Molly shot him a wink and raised her eyebrows as if to say,
“And why, John? Why is that? Come on, give me the rest. Or can you still not say it?” she said. Goading him. Testing him.
John scrawled his messy doctor’s signature on each form with a complicated weight in his chest. He didn’t want her. He didn’t miss her. Everything had been a lie between them. And here they were, signing away the last year of pain and frustration, whisking it away like dust on the mantle. A few pieces of paper, and a whole marriage no longer existed.

Sherlock stared out the window, listening to the clatter of metal on metal and letting the train’s vibrations soothe his nerves. They were minutes away from the station, minutes away from John, and once he saw John, it was only a matter of hours before Christmas Day. Supper, a single night’s sleep, and it would be time. Sherlock clenched his hand on his leg and buried the urge to squirm. When his phone chimed, he nearly threw it across the train car in his haste to raise it to his eyes.
“I want this with you, John,” Sherlock said in a fierce whisper. “I never thought I would, but with you…”
Sherlock Watson-Holmes now, actually.

They were quiet for a long moment, the only sound in the flat their slowing breaths and the soothing slide of hands over skin.
“Yes,” John agreed. “Tomorrow afternoon. She only works a half day on Mondays. I’ll meet her at her flat after work. Do it then.”
He didn’t care if they sent any love back.
He selected his clothing with care, slipping on a silvery grey shirt that always caught John’s gaze, made his deep blue eyes linger on his throat, collarbones, and chest. His favorite black suit, with the pants tailored to perfection, sitting perfectly at his narrow hips, cupping his arse in a way that drove John to distraction, and the jacket that emphasized his narrow waist. He studied himself for a moment in the mirror, then tamed his frizzy post-shower curls with a bit of product. His jeweltone blue scarf finished off the look, making his eyes glow a bright grey-blue.

“As my doctor?”
"Well well, Watson," Jenkins said, looking Sherlock over head to toe. "Who's the arm candy you brought with you tonight?"
John closed his eyes for a moment and forced his breathing back to normal. Then he reached for a pair of sterile gloves and got to work.
“No. I trust your medical opinion, John.”
This is the second chapter posted today, so make sure you didn't miss chapter 31!
His father chuckled. “Because you’re the genius who sees everything. He assumes you’ve already observed how he feels. The only unknown is you.” A rustle of fingers through his mother’s hair, the gentle smack of lips against her cheek. “At least, that’s how it was for me.”
"As much as I am loathe to admit it, you're probably right," Sherlock said, his voice overly confident to compensate for its roughness. "Mycroft would likely kidnap me and force me to go anyway. Attending voluntarily will throw him off. Your presence would certainly make the whole thing... more tolerable."
/ 4:15 PM
“Blowjobs.”
“Sherlock will need to be monitored closely until the danger has passed. Go home, Mary.”
Should you and John decide to proceed, I will ensure that the process goes smoothly.
He and Sherlock would make their own way. They would figure it out. He’d move into 221C with his daughter if he had to. Whatever it took to keep both of them in his life. Maybe, if he were truly lucky, Sherlock would surprise them all and take to fatherhood with his usual stunning competence. But all of it depended on how the next few steps played out.
I never said you didn’t. You deserve good. Like Molly. Molly is good. For you, I mean. Not me, obviously. Too many breasts.
Neither did, until Mr. Holmes came back with the last of the dishes and set it between them.
"Yes," John said, drawing Sherlock forward by the hand to get some measure of control over the situation. "This is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Bill Murray, who you’ve seen through the blog, plus Jenkins, Patel, and Harris."

Then Mycroft arrived.
John crept down the stairs from his old room where Rosie slept soundly in the cot Sherlock had bought for her. It meant he would be at 221b for another few hours while she napped, would have to head home well after dark yet again and probably be up all night with her, but his days of single fatherhood had taught him to find peace where and when he could. She never slept well at his flat in the suburbs. The chaos of 221b seemed to suit her, soothe her.
John set the tumbler down on the counter with great care, and for the briefest of moments, Sherlock glimpsed the impression of his lip over John’s on the rim, a confession. A testament. John’s eyes were dark, and as serious as Sherlock had ever seen them as he stepped right up into Sherlock’s space. Not touching, hands at his sides, just… standing with his chest mere inches from Sherlock’s, eyes fixed on Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s breathing went shallow as his entire body thrummed with John’s proximity, the air between them electric. His chin tipped down, closer, an unconscious betrayal—but apparently the exact thing John was waiting for.
Sherlock very nearly turned around and left when blaring music came spilling out of the pub and into the chilly night air. It had been a trying enough day already; John bustling about the flat, decorating, making tea and finding every possible reason to put his hands on Sherlock. It was a maddening effect of the holiday season, one that would be gone on Boxing Day while Sherlock's pathetic pining would remain, stronger than ever with the memory of John's fingers on the skin of his wrist. Now he was expected to endure the Yarders, the pub, the flirting John would surely do with the female officers and staff.

He’d been so selfish.

“Say it again. What you said earlier. Tell me again,” Sherlock asked, swaying in for another soft kiss. John hummed into it, then pulled back just far enough to meet Sherlock’s gaze.

Sherlock's cheeks went attractively pink, and he opened his mouth to deduce Jenkins, no doubt, but Bill Murray thankfully beat him to it.
He took a deep breath and stepped into the sitting room.

John's heart ached, and before he could think about it he brought Sherlock's hand up to his mouth and brushed a reassuring kiss there. Sherlock's breath caught again, and his fingers tightened around John's. Another win. John smiled faintly against the back of Sherlock's hand.
With no legal barrier to this union, I ask you now;
“Let me guess. He fucks you at night, tells you what great friends you are, how much you mean to him, then denies you in public, yeah?”
"About what?"
Then the front door opened.
It still didn’t necessarily mean John would be open to a relationship. At the very least, though, it meant that John found something about him physically appealing.

Who am I “essentially”? What does that even mean?
God, Sherlock was hard against him, and that was something he'd never thought possible.
Greg grinned at Sherlock’s warning gesture and cheerfully ignored it. “No, I’ve not had the pleasure! You must be Sherlock’s mother. Thank you for the secret invite,” he said, moving toward Mummy with his hand outstretched.

Sherlock’s eyes darkened all over again.
John wet his lips.
John hummed an acknowledgement. It fit. Some base part of him curled up in satisfaction, unreasonably glad that neither Janine nor Irene had gotten their hands on Sherlock. His hand tensed in Sherlock’s hair, involuntarily, and Sherlock gasped again. Sherlock lifted a hand to trace the inside seam of John’s trousers at the knee, then slightly higher as he turned to talk, meeting John’s eyes again.
The start of today’s session was… unusual. I was unable to avoid giving Sherlock and John back to back appointments this week, and the result provided quite a jumping off point for our discussion today. John and Sherlock encountered each other in the waiting room just outside my office in between appointments, and John had brought his daughter with him, as he’d been unable to call upon his usual minders. As soon as she saw Sherlock, Rosamund squealed and reached out for him, and Sherlock took her into his arms without hesitation, obviously pleased to see her. Sherlock offered to mind her in the waiting room while John came in for his appointment, which he accepted. He handed over her bag and left them with some reluctance, though as it turns out, the reluctance had nothing to do with leaving his daughter in Sherlock’s care.
Sherlock knew there was supposed to be a question in there somewhere, a request, but it seemed a bit redundant with the way John’s hand slid from his hip around to his lower back, pulling them against each other, his eyes shining and wet and his head tipped back and—
“Party sounds lovely, Greg, ta,” John cut in, snagging Sherlock by the elbow and tugging him toward the car. “We’ll sign our statements and pop in for a drink, at least.”
"Okay, Johnny, you've obviously done the best for yourself since we got out, so first round is on you!" Harris declared, supported by cheers from the other three who'd walked in with them. John rolled his eyes.
Why am I bothering?
I can’t. I’m minding Watson for the day while John attends a class.

I told Molly everything. I whispered it over the bar and shouted it over the music and told her every single moment I regretted. She was so kind, told me she’d known how I felt since before he left, that she’d never seen me so free and open, and told me some of her past stuff, too. Molly finally begged off around midnight but she hugged me and made sure I was okay to stay by myself, and I told her that I was more than fine. So much more than fine. She’s a great friend, and I feel terrible about the way Sherlock and I have both treated her over the years, but we’re going to do better now. She deserves better.
Mary gave a bitter laugh.

Sherlock glanced at John out of the corner of his eye and raised his eyebrows. “
Sherlock snatched up the envelope and carefully withdrew the contents. His eyes darted over the pages and, to John’s alarm, quickly grew moist.
“It is exactly that easy,” she’d said. “Put my boy out of his misery, John. You’ve had his heart for years, and I’ve grown quite tired of watching him wait for you.”
"Well, come on, Watson! Give your future husband a kiss!"

He emerges with a bright yellow shoulder bag and Rosamund Watson in his arms. He closes the car door with one hip and walks toward 221B.

He looked up to gauge Sherlock’s reaction to that frank statement, but found only a small smile and soft eyes. John’s throat tightened.

I wish you’d told me sooner, actually.
"Well, boys," John said, downing the last of his lager and Sherlock's scotch in quick succession, "this has been fun, but Sherlock and I need to get home." John held his keys and mobile in front of him in case the effect of Sherlock's tongue on his was obvious in the lay of his jeans.
“No. We aren’t. Let’s go to bed.”
Thanks so much, Molly.
Sherlock and John have chosen to exchange rings as a symbol of the vows they have made here today. The Best Man, Mr. Greg Lestrade, will present the rings.
"John," Sherlock murmured, taking advantage of the distraction. "Very few of these other men brought partners with them. Why were you so certain they'd make your night difficult if you didn't bring someone?"

“Come on,” he said, doing up Sherlock’s trousers and tugging him out of the car. They spilled onto the pavement in a tangle of limbs, and Sherlock draped himself over John as he scrabbled with the keys, gasping at the feel of Sherlock’s hard cock grinding into his lower back.

They walked close, hands in their pockets, their shoulders brushing every few steps. It was a slow dance, a magnetic pull, a build-up that John, for once, did nothing to diffuse. He leaned into it, soaked in the warmth of Sherlock’s body and the thrumming possibility of the last few minutes when everything was still unspoken.
“This is the bravest thing you’ve ever done, John Watson,” Sherlock said, lifting his hands to cup John’s face. “Now let

John cut in, desperate to spare Sherlock the gory details.
John laughed helplessly to the ceiling, a mess of confused, amused, and turned on. "Sorry, gents. Duty calls."
Sherlock cut him off with a long kiss, slipped his tongue into John’s mouth with a low keen, and the fire in John’s gut flared immediately back to life. He released Sherlock’s shirt and ran his hands down to Sherlock’s hips instead, dragging them flush against his own and grinding, hard, his blood singing with need. They both groaned into the kiss and broke apart with a gasp.

John stopped. Just… stopped right in the middle of the sidewalk, looked up at the stars, and look a breath.
Sherlock tipped the last of his wine back, then held out his cup to John, meeting his gaze full on.
“Sherlock? Everything okay? You don’t have to…”
“Yeah. It’s my job,” John said. “To look after you.”
“Welcome home,” John said, warmly but without looking, intent on his project.

"Oh, come on, Sherlock, it's just for fun," John said, keeping his voice light. "I know you don't do the whole sentiment thing, but we all know how much you love for your genius to be appreciated. What is it, then, words of affirmation? You like being told how clever you are?"
It could still be something else. Friendship. Touch starvation. He could even be uncomfortable with the touch but unwilling to say. But sometimes, rarely, Sherlock would give the smallest sign. The corner of his mouth turned slightly up, a brush of fingers against John’s, a faint hum. It took all of John’s considerable self-control to keep his hand from sliding higher in search of a gasp, a blush, a—something. He

John admitted there was little relationship left at that point, and he had in fact been wishing for divorce almost the entire time they were married, staying only out of obligation to his daughter.

The buildings had been abandoned for years; the roof was a warzone of scrap metal and used needles, but they were right along the flight path of the enormous C-17s that carried British troops to and from their stations abroad. They were a forgotten piece of London, unwanted, an eyesore to some.
The cab pulled up in front of the pub at the same time as another one, which spilled two of John's former battalion acquaintances out onto the sidewalk with a boisterous cheer. John had been hoping for a quiet moment to collect himself and make sure Sherlock was ready, but there'd be no time for that, apparently. He looked over at Sherlock to check in as he pulled a few bills from his wallet, expecting to see his usually calm, collected passivity. Instead, he found Sherlock looking a bit like a deer in headlights, his eyes locked on the men out the window, four of them now. Apparently they'd have to
John walked into the office today practically glowing. He came out to Sherlock on Tuesday, which brought him incredible relief, and ever since then he believes they have been dancing around “something”, though he’s hesitant to truly speculate on Sherlock’s feelings for him. He didn't even want to talk about their date tonight, which he is so looking forward to, because he didn’t want to “jinx it”. I praised his mature, controlled decision to wait until after our appointment today to pursue Sherlock, which brought us to the primary item on our agenda: the review of John's case notes from his anger management course.
The solicitor split off the last form and slipped it into an envelope, then passed it to John. “That one will need Mr. Holmes’ signature.”
He should have been shocked by the words, should’ve wanted to call them back, be gentler, but the way Sherlock's head fell back against the wall, the moan vibrating in his throat—it was hard to feel sorry about anything.
John’s eyes scanned Sherlock from top to bottom, then again, and again.

He approached John cautiously, as if a mere whisper of sound would send the glass to John’s lips. John smiled, but there was nothing good in the pained twist of his mouth.

, and Sherlock though of full-bodied flavor on John’s mouth, of seductive red, warmth in his belly, first kisses, and laying John down in front of the fire while a winter wonderland swirled outside their window.
He tugged at the open edges of Sherlock’s coat, gripped the dark wool in his fists and kept his eyes leveled at Sherlock’s chest for the space of two long breaths. Then he lifted his gaze.
Sherlock smirked. "Blue carbuncle," he said dryly, but didn't remove his hand from John's, didn't dare to move at all.
Sherlock arrived only a few minutes later, and he took his seat beside John, back to the window, with a soft candle-lit smile. He nudged the toe of his shoe against John’s under the table and cast a significant glance at the champagne.

Sherlock stood and removed his goggles, avoiding John's eyes now that he didn't have the filter of plastic between them. He watched his own fingers where they rested on the goggles, tapping against their clear facing.
John summoned a half-hearted smile. “We appreciate it.”
The first brush was little more than a catch of lower lip upon lower lip, more about texture than pressure; about gentle, tentative contact; about
“No! No. Stay. Please.”
How did you get over all of it?
John dragged Sherlock down with a hand on the back of his neck and crashed their mouths together again, his blood running so hot in his veins it burned away every trace of confusion and doubt, until all he could think about was Sherlock's body under his hands, his tongue in his mouth, his hard cock grinding into John's.
Please believe me, John. I never would have done that to you, but until I had completely dismantled Moriarty’s network I couldn’t be sure someone wouldn’t still carry out that order.
I hope, in trusting you with this information, you can finally understand why nothing will ever happen with The Woman. I hope you can finally let that go.
“What are you doing here?” he all but spat when John drew close enough. “She was obviously quite willing. Or did you get her number for later instead? You needn’t have bothered. She’ll quite happily take you back to her place right now, though I’ll warn you she has a rather large dog and her apartment will be a wreck.”
Sherlock shoved John out of the cab the second it stopped and plastered himself to John’s back as he fumbled to get his key in the lock. They tumbled through the door and thrashed their way out of their coats, their hands colliding twice as they attempted to hang them up, sending them into fits of laugher.
“Brian. Hi. It’s, uh… good to see you.”

“I’d like that,” Sherlock said.

“You have options, Sherlock.”
“Well, hello there, gorgeous. Long time no see.”
John wiped a hand across his eyes, straightened his spine, and met Sherlock’s gaze again.

Before anything else, I have to say again that I don’t blame you for Mary’s death. I’m so sorry I ever said that. I was just… I hate myself for not being who she thought I was, and I feel guilty for so much. SO much, Sherlock, and I can only tell you a portion of it right now, and I’ll tell you all of it eventually, but trust me. I know it’s a bit ridiculous, considering she was a liar and an assassin who shot you, but I guess this stuff isn’t always logical. The things she said right at the end really messed me up. All that, you’re perfect, you’re all I wanted… it’s hard to even think about, because she was never really what I wanted. It made things so much worse, and I just lashed out. I tend to do that a lot. I’m sorry. Again. It’s not enough, but I’m so very sorry, Sherlock.

What’s going on, Johnny? You didn’t call last week.
You and Watson are coming to 221B tomorrow for the first time in five days. I always go over to your flat when Watson will be around, which is most of the time, and you usually only come over here when you have a minder for her, so this is a rare opportunity. I assume this is because you believe 221B is unsafe for a child. I’ve taken steps to ensure this is no longer the case. She will always be safe here. I hope you like the things I bought her, but I can never tell when I’m overstepping. Am I allowed to buy her things? Am I allowed to hold her? To talk to her and play her music and teach her things? Am I allowed to be the one to go to her when she cries in the middle of her nap? I don't know how this is supposed to work.

Once this initial fact was out, John talked steadily for the rest of our session, confessing to frequent and significant sexual contact with men in the past, always while intoxicated or overseas with the Army when he thought it could be “excused”. He recounted a series of emails with his twin sister, who came out as a lesbian when they were eighteen, and described his father’s persistent physical and emotional abuse throughout their teenage years. John has been repressing his sexuality for more than half his life as a result of his father’s abuse, and he believes his past violence toward Sherlock has all been rooted in his repressed attraction and his father’s anger. Now that he’s analyzing his sexuality directly, he is questioning absolutely everything to the point of doubting every relationship he’s ever had.

And then I'd have to have some really awkward conversations."
John all but marched after Sherlock, who lowered himself cautiously into his chair and drummed his fingers along the armrests. He was so obviously nervous, but not guarded, thank God. They’d already been at rock bottom together. They had little to hide from one another these days.
"Ooh, not so fast, mate. You get a gift too, you know, and it just so happens that I got your name." He fished around in his inner jacket pocket for a moment, then gave a triumphant

Does that mean you think he...
Maybe the thought of being under John in bed turned him on a bit.
The conversation quickly moved on from there, covering Mummy’s research and Sherlock’s last case. Sherlock slowly recovered from the gift ambush, sinking easily into the deductions that had led to the capture of a female serial killer (a rarity that had thrown Sherlock at first) with a pattern of killing controlling lovers. The finale had been quite the show, and it had quickly become one of John’s most popular blog posts.

John likes the blue best.
Sherlock skidded to a stop and watched with a fond smirk as John took the suspect out with a perfect rugby tackle, wrestling him easily to the ground despite his smaller size. John moved with a compact strength, powerful and unyielding, pinning the man so completely that he had no hope of reaching for the knife in his left pocket. It was all too easy to imagine himself in the suspect’s position, being pressed down into the ground by John’s solid frame, held down by hips and hands, that mouth mere inches from his throat, close enough to feel—
Mary,
I concluded our session by asking how he felt about John’s progress in anger management in relation to their past violence. Sherlock’s brightness dimmed a bit, but he agreed that the courses seemed to be doing John a lot of good. He described the same moment in the park that John did on Tuesday, relating to Sherlock’s fake suicide, and noted that John dealt with the situation well. He finally acknowledged that John’s violence is a problem, that he did not deserve to be beaten, and that he does not intend to allow it in the future, should it ever come up again, though he doesn’t believe it will. These commitments still feel quite new and raw coming from him,  but I do believe he is finally beginning to develop some sense of who he is and what kind of care he needs and deserves. I am pleased with his progress and look forward to seeing him continue his new, better habits through our next appointment.
“We’re not going to shag while your parents are out there,” John said, resolute. He put a hand under Sherlock’s chin and tipped his face up, then claimed his mouth in a long kiss. “But waking up next to you was the perfect start to this morning. I love you.”
Anything.
“I’ve got you,” John murmured, running a hand over Sherlock’s shuddering form. “We’ll get through this.”
I should probably stop writing now.
“Cold. Hot. Nauseated. Everything hurts.” He hesitated. “Cravings. And my brain is… separated. Drifty.”
You can always say. But no, it’s long past time for me to take it off.

He stumbled back until his legs hit the the desk and slid down, propping his arse on the edge and dragging John forward into the vee of his legs. John’s lips were hot and insistent against his, a firm press that came again and again, punctuated by ragged gasps that inevitably turned to inappropriate laughter instead. They pressed their foreheads together, and Sherlock lifted both hands to cup the back of John’s head, threading his fingers through gray-blonde hair.
The door flew open, and his ‘I could just’ options narrowed significantly.
“Shockingly, I think you have been a good influence on me. I’m active, I do good for the community, I rarely shoot people, and I’m happy—I’d say that’s an improvement on the 2010 edition of John Watson, for sure.”
“Sherlock? What’s wrong?” Mummy asked, taking him by the elbow to move him to the edge of the crowd.
He opened a new text message.
. I have an appointment with Ella this afternoon. She’s going to refer me somewhere so I can… deal with this.”
Thankfully, Sherlock took over the conversation from that point, educating John about the intricacies of a successful bee hive while John took the time to quietly panic. He felt flayed open, heart on display, but he forced his attention on Sherlock’s words as they savored cheese slathered in honey and tender bits of fancy meats on tiny pieces of toast. The food
“Mycroft likes to think he knows more than he does. He thinks pulling me out of a few gutters makes him some kind of expert.” He pursed his lips, then nodded, as if coming to a decision. His eyes flickered over to John’s, then away again, skittish.
“No. He was expected to last six months at most.”

Sherlock huffed. “I said
And a note tacked to John’s chair, scrawled in Sherlock’s own hand.
As soon as they stepped out onto the rooftop, Sherlock went straight for the beehives, firing a thousand questions a minute at the poor chef. The bloke took it all in stride, though, chatting cheerily about his bees and cooking with obvious pride as he led them around the space. Long wooden boxes lined the edges, packed with herbs of every variety on their last legs of the season, barely hanging on in the cold.
Direct hit. John’s heart gave a painful throb, and he closed his eyes against the torrent of half-formed desires he’d refused to acknowledge, barely glancing at them from the corner of his eye. He and Sherlock, cuddled together on the sofa watching bad telly with the baby sprawled across their laps. He and Sherlock, lying in bed together until the baby cried over the monitor, forcing him up the stairs to his old room. He and Sherlock—

John dragged a hand over his face.
John indicated the highest cabinet in the kitchen with raised eyebrows, obviously proud of his own genius, which Sherlock acknowledged with a quirk of his mouth.

“Boring,” Sherlock said from behind his microscope. “And pointless. They’ll be here in a week. Why send a card with ‘holiday greetings’ when they’ll be here to deliver them in person?”
"Call me if you wanna go dancing sometime, Holmes. It'll be just like old times."
I wouldn’t blame you.
John stood up straight, pushed his shoulders back, and unfolded the lab report.

But back in the sitting room, it all came pressing in again. The stacked and labeled boxes, the space positively cavernous without all the clutter, all of it beat at the doors to his mind, but his brain refused to comprehend the implications. He stood for several long moments, staring unseeingly at the bare flat, until the sound of tread on the stairs shook him back to awareness.

John waited.

Mummy closed the door to the room with a gentle click, a cloud of plaster dust puffing out. “Mycroft has been saying for years that he hardly needs his own bedroom here anymore and that we should just turn it into a proper guest room already. He had

“This is what Mrs. Hudson was scolding you about?”
“I know you’re in love with my son,” she’d said over the phone at Christmas. “When are you going to do something about it?”
"John," he murmured, barely more than a rumble in Sherlock's ear. "You have a lot to process. Should we go home? Or go somewhere else?"
“Okay, okay!” He stumbled out the door and turned back to her with a smile, the last of his unshed tears shining in his eyes. “Thank you. I hope you’re right about this.”
Sherlock froze. His eye twitched. Then he leapt from his chair and dashed into the kitchen.
John laughed, high and giddy.
I did, John, I did, I would have given anything to have you with me those two years.
Also I’m going to plug my ears and sing la-la-la-la-la really loud because I do NOT need to know how many guys you banged in the army, ugh.

"All right, come on, you tossers, let's go inside and get started with the drinking before we get any further, yeah?" he begged, squeezing Sherlock's hand in a silent signal to please keep it together just a bit longer. "I need a pint if I'm gonna look at your ugly mugs all night."
Sherlock’s mouth curved into that small, soft smile, so warm and full of promise, that had been common since the end of their estrangement. He slowly got to his feet, then tugged at their linked fingers for John to stand, too.
, straight down John’s throat with a high, desperate cry. John hummed his pleasure and drank it all down, held him gently in his mouth as he came down from his orgasm, soothing Sherlock with long, gentle brushes over his thighs and stomach. Sherlock pried his eyes open and looked down at John in wonder, ran his hands over John’s flushed cheeks, over lips that grinned with wicked glee, through tousled hair that stuck up in clumps where it had been gripped. Absolutely stunning, unbelievably gorgeous, simply—
Christ, I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to you actually using my name.
Sherlock, whose respiration was dipping worryingly low again, whose face was pinched with pain even in sleep, who shook and shivered despite the blankets.
A glance; Sherlock waited, passive, his eyes soft and worried.
After he filled me in on the details of the case, we spent much of the afternoon tracking down other veterans with local ties to our initial client. Sherlock left the talking to me, fortunately, as my common ground with our victims made it much easier to relate and communicate. A pattern quickly emerged—all our veterans had some tie in their daily routine to a particular neighborhood in Brixton. The rest of our evening was spent sneaking through dirty alleys and staring at shop fronts for endless hours while Sherlock deduced everyone that walked by to keep me entertained. Sherlock was brilliant, as always, uncovering the link between particular shops, something about mud and tyre tread, I don’t know. What I do know is that it was good to be back on a case with him again, and even better that we got to help some of my fellow veterans. I’ve missed this.

Sherlock whirled around and stalked off in the direction of the tube station before she could finish, his coat a dramatic swirl around him, not bothering to check if Mummy and Father were following. They could keep up. He texted as he walked, letting the crowd part before him like water before the sharp prow of a boat.
The case had everything on Sherlock’s Christmas list: locked rooms, unusual crime scenes, a bit of lab work, and a good chase. But best of all: a showy end that let John get his hands dirty.
It wasn't all that unusual, true; He was often impressed with Sherlock, and unfortunately vocal about it, a fact that never failed to elicit snickers from any nearby members of London's Finest.
“Who are you texting?” Sherlock demanded, looking away from the road to peer over at John’s phone.
It’s been two days. Why haven’t you?
A pause, then Sherlock burrowed closer.

to take in the sight of the deadly John Watson, doctor, soldier, and furious whirlwind of barely-contained rage and adrenaline, kneeling on the floor of their kitchen with flushed cheeks, tented pants, and danger in his eyes.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment. John's brilliant plan began to crumble before his eyes. Too transparent, so obviously fishing, and he'd just revealed everything he'd always held so close for this exact reason—

Because everyone matters. It’s not something you earn. Every person matters, including you.
Sherlock took John’s hand and brought it to his lips, brushed feather-light kisses over the back, each faint contact a rush of heat and dizzying feeling that battered at John’s resolve, begged him to seal their mouths together and breathe life into their new future.
“Do you think we could make it balance on the top of the tree? It deserves a place of honor, don’t you think?”

“She’s actually right sometimes, you know,” he murmured. “I’ve found her pretty helpful this time around.”
And he let his forehead drop, let his dark curls come to rest against John’s silver and gold, let their noses brush and breath mingle and let all of it,

Sherlock scowled. “All I need is a simple gift to exchange with John on Christmas morning. Something to put in a little box with pretty paper so I can fulfill my social obligation and avoid tiresome glares from my parents. Why do you insist on pressing this pointless issue?”
"Understands?"
You have to be absolutely sure
On his third try, John found the box he needed: tea kettle, sugar dish (empty), several of their (Sherlock’s) random mismatched mugs… but John’s RAMC mug was nowhere to be found. He’d never taken it with him to Mary’s, couldn’t bear the thought of it leaving 221B, but it wasn’t in the box with the rest.

[He shuts his mouth quite suddenly and perks up, listening. John Watson walks through the door to the sitting room a moment later with a box in his hand and a backpack on his back. As soon as he walks in, JW and SH grin broadly at one another.]
And Sherlock took an easy breath in, turned to John, and pulled the bottle from his hands, letting their fingers brush and tangle together.

“What? To 221B? Where will they…” John paused, failing completely to hide the disappointment and hurt on his face. “I suppose I can call Harry, see if I can visit so your parents can stay in my room and—”
“Thanks,” John murmured with a quick squeeze of Sherlock’s knee. “I’m going to put on the kettle and take care of a few things. Be back in a few.”
“Well, son, we probably won’t have a chance to talk privately again before you make your grand gesture.” A hand patted his arm. “I’d wish you good luck, but he’s obviously over the moon for you, so there’s really no need.”
“I really thought that was it. I thought I was never going to see you again. I wouldn’t do that to— I couldn’t—”
"You say that as if you didn't engineer our presence here specifically. Please take your gift so John will let us leave."

Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and yanked him out the door. “Thank you, Angelo, but we have plans. Good night!”
“Sherlock,” he murmured, rubbing a hand over quaking ribs. “Sherlock, wake up.”

“I don’t know if I’m getting old or if it’s just your influence rubbing off on me,” he said, “but I have no patience for starstruck kids anymore.” He drank deeply, eyeing Sherlock over the rim of the cup.

Once upon a time, Sherlock would have scoffed at the idea that John could possibly know what he was thinking. Now, the real question was
Sherlock groaned.
The reply came within thirty seconds.
Once again, Sherlock took the risk. Sherlock put himself on the line. Sherlock did what John could not.
Sherlock dipped the ladle into the spiced wine and poured the dark red liquid into two cups, then made his way back to John, his nose full of the mingled scents of cinnamon and clove. A young constable John cornered him near the fireplace where he’d been warming up, but a quick glare from over John’s shoulder sent him scurrying away. John turned to him with a relieved smile and accepted his cup of wine.
“John’s feelings on the matter are still unknown, though I will grant that he has been more… affectionate lately. There could be other reasons, though.” He took a gulp of wine to tamp down the rush of hope that made him want to tell Molly about every single escalating touch over the past week, like a teenager at a sleepover. Ridiculous. “Besides, if it’s so easy, what about you and Gavin?”
“We’re going to have a baby,” he whispered into the cup of Sherlock’s palm.
