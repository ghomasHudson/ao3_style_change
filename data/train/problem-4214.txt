Once he had recovered his cool he joined Claire in the kitchen. ‘Not that I don’t love having you around more, Dad, but what’s the plan? I mean long term?’
‘I’ve only ever felt at home at your house. You opened up your life and made space for me. Made me feel like I fit in, wanted. That’s still an unexpected feeling for me.’
‘Claire!!’
‘Yeah, me too man.’
Dean shot up. Fear coursing through his body.
‘You’re not going to read it then?’
‘Lisa?’
‘For you Dean. Everything I do, everything I have always done, is for you.’
‘Looks nasty Dean, I should take you to hospital.’
John looks at Mary in bafflement. Jack steps in, ‘This is Castiel, my father.’ John always chokes on his own tongue as Jack continues, ‘Not my real father, Lucifer isn’t a nice person. Before my mother died she told me to find a new father. She was lovely. She helped me to choose Castiel.’ He turns to John, ‘She made a good choice.’
‘You know I can drive now, Dad?’
Dean shook his head in confusion.
They heard voices from inside the house and headed back in. Sam and Jack had arrived. They stepped sideways and allowed Eileen to come through the door as Dean, Cas and Claire rounded the corner, mobbing Sam and Jack with hugs.
Cas nods, realising the importance of Sam being able to keep his own life private. As a prosecutor any unnecessary attention on him could influence the cases he tries. It’s how he and Eileen met, Eileen was an interpreter for one of the witnesses in a case that Sam was dealing with.
‘Night night my loves,’ Meg waves as she waltzes off to the stairs.
Cas hadn’t fully retired, he still did the odd bit of work here and there. But it was very much on his terms now. He was sufficiently sought after. Often he didn’t have his name included on a song anymore, he wasn’t bothered, he was well know enough, but Dean knew his touch well enough that he could tell.
‘My dads got married. It was great.’ She beamed.
Claire was in her room. She could hear them laughing. Something in the tone sounded different. She started to head downstairs, peered into the living room.
‘Yes! I was talking to Patience yesterday about coming to visit. Can I sleepover at Jody’s?’
Tess whips round to him, ‘You know her?’
Somehow they had moved onto dating history. Dean was telling Cas about Lisa. ‘I dunno man, it’s like we both woke up one day and it was gone. All that stuff I used to love about her drives me nuts.’
‘Look, Cas, I won’t, I promise. But you aren’t going to be the one ruining that relationship, believe me.’
This was her first stadium gig too. His little girl wasn’t so little anymore. He stared after her as she got into Beth’s car, leather jacket and heavy eyeliner done just so. He sighed and shut the door, sent a text to his adopted son.
‘Cas?’
‘I am Michael’s perfect vessel. In the same way that sam is Lucifer’s perfect vessel. It’s what yellow eyes wanted, what it was all for. Heaven wanted it too. We destroyed their game plan, or thought we did. We both said yes eventually, just not at the same time.’ A flush spread across Dean’s cheek. How could he be so stupid. He was just a pawn all along.
He grabs him into a hug. ‘Cmere dude.’ His face is smashed into Cas’ shoulder. Cas isn’t the best hugger, sort of grabs Dean by his drenched coat and pats his back.
He looked up at Cas, ‘I saw a realtor. She’s got someone who wants a long term lease on the place. You’ll get half the rent.’
‘Hello boys is the line, yes?’
‘My sister.’
‘Come home?’ Dean doesn’t know how to respond. This is how she always got him to agree to stuff. There was always a catch.
After a week or so of very little contact Cas starts to worry. He rings
Mary hunched over the body of her dead husband sobbing. Sam came to comfort her, she laid her head on her youngest son’s shoulder letting out her grief for the life she should have had.
‘Oh, uh, no. She’s my adopted daughter. Long story. Her dad wasn’t my boyfriend, he’s a friend. It’s complicated. It was more practical, because of his job, he travels a lot, for her to live with me.’
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes with their respective drinks.
‘I was good at languages, chemistry, surprisingly, English, but I loved history. I really enjoyed looking at the different perspectives and presenting arguments. It’s why I was planning to go to law school after college.’
Dean appears triumphant after a surprisingly short time with a huge platter of fish and another of grilled vegetables. Cas grabs plates and cutlery and they sit on the deck to eat. It’s really relaxed, Dean surveys the group. Ben and Jack have become inseparable in such a short space of time.
‘Wow, some best friend! So he’s straight.’
Sam took it better than Dean. Asked more about the technicalities of the deal, his legal training showing through from all those years ago. He looked at the problem rationally. Thought about how the situation could be useful to them.
Dean turns the car off and tries to speak. He opens his mouth. Closes it again. Looks helplessly at Sam.
When they pull away, Dean steps in after.
‘Hey, he could have had a worse role model. I did kill hitler!’ Sam rolled his eyes. Several people commandeered Dean after that, wanting the full story.
Cas came and stood by him. ‘I’m sorry Dean.’
‘Ok.’ Was all he could muster as a reply.
Dean clears his throat. ‘Well, she works away a lot so we only usually see her at weekends. She’s going to come out for a week every now and then to see Ben.’
‘Are you serious Cas?’ Balthasar was incredulous.
‘There are a bunch of cool parties. I’m just trying to decide where I want to go.’
‘Thought I’d show Cas and Eileen the old haunts. Treat them to some quality Winchester time.’ Sam gives Dean an odd look.
‘Oh my god, guys, that was so awesome!’ Beth gushed to their friends, everyone’s smiles splitting their faces. Even Claire was impressed, she had seen Jack sing before but never at such a large venue.
He sees his sister’s boyfriend’s car in the drive and stops behind, gathers his things and makes his way up the slippery, treacherous path to the door. It’s flung open wide by Sam who hugs him and ushers him inside.
Dean reached up with the blade, hesitating at Cas’s neck. Cas dropped his head back, baring his throat to Dean. Dean took a deep breath before he pressed the blade against the skin, cutting as cleanly and painlessly as he knew how.
So Dean thought about Cas. Cas who was always there when he needed him. Cas who never turned his back on him. Cas who saw the worst of him and the best. Cas who loved him, after everything. After Hell and Purgatory and Metatron and Chuck and everything in between.
Dean stood up straighter. “I’m here for Cas. And I’m not leaving without him.”
him, and loved him anyway. Dean would never find that again. Not in this life or the next.
Cas. Messy hair and trench coat and all, eyes closed and face relaxed in a peaceful sleep. Dean dropped to his knees, swallowing thickly.
‘Right. Of course. I thought you probably would see Alastair there.’
That night at home after Ben had put his, crying, wailing, teenage ‘it’s not fair’ case to his parents, they sat down to talk.
They made their way back to their usual spot at their laptops. Dean trying not to think of all the images which had flashed before his eyes.
‘Yeah, dude, I’m sure it is. It was a joke.’
She grabs a class of water in the kitchen and drinks the lot, before refilling it and slowly climbing the stairs. She’s about to open her door when she spots a chink of light from her dad’s room. He’s stayed up, or tried to. She pushes the door open quietly expecting to find Cas sat up in bed, book fallen into his lap and head on his chest. She usually removes the book and turns off the light.
‘Sure thing Dean, didn’t know you liked to watch.’ Gabriel spoke around the girl sucking on his earlobe.
‘Sure, everyone has. Cas’ love life has always been a bit of mystery, it leads to speculation.’
‘Alright then.’ Cas gets up from the stool he is perched on next to Dean, turns to walk away.
Castiel nodded sagely.
‘Nothing. It’s easier that way. My work is everything. But I’m always hopeful I’ll find someone to spend my life with.’
Claire announces she’s tired of Trivial Pursuit, ‘Who knows this much random history?’
Claire held her hands up in exasperation. She was not expecting Cas to agree with him when she spoke to him on the phone that evening, Dean cackling in the background.
Cas hadn’t seen their new music played live. Hadn’t been to a concert since that terrible experience with Amara. He had forgotten. Well, not forgotten, but memories never do the real thing justice.
Sam loved seeing the delight on Dean’s face whenever Claire rang.
Cas laid a hand on his bowed head. ‘Dean, it’s ok, I know.’
After dinner Cas tells them about the new job. Sam drops the pan he’s holding, part way to the cupboard. Stares at Cas looking aghast and excited all at once.
‘Don’t think so Dean. Just business people.’
‘You’re upset I didn’t come to see you.’
‘Yes Dean. I think he just wanted to stay out of your way while Lisa was here. Give you guys some space. But then got this call, and it’s changed his plans a bit.’
‘The St Emillion please.’
‘I, well, uh...’ Cas couldn’t get the words out. He was running his hands through his hair, thinking back through their conversations about Amara, seeing just where he had misinterpreted what Dean had said.
Dean, on the other hand, was actively looking for that person. It was the reason, in a way, why everything had gone wrong. Cas didn’t want to end up being left by the wayside when Dean found someone new to play at happy families with. When he found what he was looking for, and Cas was left without what he knew was all he ever wanted.
‘Dean you’re just plain bullying him now.’
‘You sure?’
‘It’s ok. John stitched it.’
‘Sam! He’s coming this way, look there’s an empty table next to us, do you think he’s going to sit there? I might die.’
He huffed, ‘A loveable dork?’
Rowena gave up on her attempt to persuade Cas to come to yoga, ‘I cannot handle downward dog today. I may vomit.’ And left shortly after.
‘Nah, I dare not risk the wrath of morning Cas.’ Dean smirks as Balthasar chuckles in agreement.
Claire chipped in, ‘We do nothing whenever Dean stays with us. He loves to take care of us.’
He grabs a passing waiter, ‘A bottle of,’ he gestures at the glass, looking between the three of them to provide the detail, ‘whatever this is please.’ Dean passes his receipt to the waiter, preferring that to trying to pronounce the name of Chateau Castres properly.
‘Well, he and Dean have been on a few dates.’
‘Yeah well they didn’t need to. That was your decision Cas.’
‘No Dean, I am not.’
Cas smiles, waiting for Sam to continue.
‘Well no, but that’s not always a bad thing. Change is good. I’m not perfect. This is more real and personal I suppose.’
‘Rowena was very insistent we meet, said we had lots in common. You were at university together in London?’
‘So you don’t speak to me because there’s more to our relationship than with Sam? Care to elaborate Cas?’
Dean nods. ‘Yeah, I know man. I trust you’
Sam continues to look worried but Dean ignores him, slapping on false bonhomie, keeping the celebratory atmosphere going.
He looked at his phone for a few moments after hanging up. It wasn’t proof but he thinks Becky is right.
Cas was stopped in his tracks. Of course it might seem like they were a couple. But they weren’t. Would never be.
‘Dean, she’s 16, she can’t drink straight scotch.’
Jimmy came over and held out his hand. ‘Thank you Dean.’ He didn’t know how to answer. ‘For everything you did to try and save the world, I saw much of it. For everything you did for Claire. It means the world to me.’ He let go of Dean’s hand and held his arms as though to pull him into an embrace, gripped his shoulder. The wrong shoulder.
They sit quietly in a dark corner, Dean chattering occasionally, he’s very observant, likes people watching. Must be what makes him such a good actor.
Cas, in his usual way, stared at her, head slightly tilted, eyes squinting without speaking. When he didn’t reply, she tried again. ‘Do you think it is appropriate for Claire?’
Charlie was extremely excited to me Cas. She was numb to literary figures, but film stars were a different matter. She was a nerd at heart.
‘Good luck he’s in Illinois or you’ll be forcing him on me!’
‘Oh yeah, he was telling me about her the other day! She sounds badass!’
The evening ends up with all the instruments out, Cas on the piano, Claire on guitar and Dean on vocals, making a real racket, covering everything from stomping glam rock to 80s power ballads.
She heard him before she saw him. She hadn’t thought it could get much worse than this morning. But somehow, it was. Dean pulled up in front of her on a brand new motorcycle. ‘What do you think?’
‘Clarence, come here.’
‘I’ve checked. He’s still alive. He’s 130 years old. Must still have some remains of god energy in him.’
Sam sighed, pushed his hair off his face, ‘When you came to LA, he didn’t want to keep you from enjoying time with your friends so he never got you to stay for that long.’
Cas stepped towards the door and held it open for the awkward three legged race than Sam and Dean had formed.
Sam acts oddly for the rest of the evening. Eileen signs discretely at Cas behind his back, worrying. Cas agrees to come by when she’s at yoga one evening in the week to chat to Sam.
Cas was hovering near the kitchen watching the exchange quietly.
‘Shirt looks good on you Cas. Matches your eyes. Should keep that too, suits you better than me.’
Tears slid down Cas’ face. He decided to go out for a walk, he needed some fresh air to clear his head.
‘I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. But, is this what you want?’ Cas cuts in, he can’t hear anymore. Is that selfish? He can’t help it.
‘Does Cas...? Why isn’t he here? Do you see him much?’
He surveyed the room, ‘You know I will always go for a Rom-com’.
‘Me on the other hand, I’m going to want tickets ok?’
‘I gathered. Don’t know any other people currently around in airports.’
They wait for Sam at the airport with a big sign for what feels like forever. When they spot Sam’s head above the crowds Ben starts waving frantically, echos of the young boy he’s growing out of being. He almost loses it with excitement when he sees who has accompanied Sam. It’s Jack. He’s beaming as well.
‘It was cool, we finished the quest just as she had to head away for the weekend on a conference. Which happened to be in LA. So we met up to celebrate in person. And one thing led to another.’ She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively, ‘And then I never heard from her again when she got home. Turned out she was married with a kid! I hate being people’s ’gay thing’. It’s so demeaning.’
‘Deano. Just the man I need, we have to make some schedule changes. Today is the same as planned, but here’s the rest.’
‘Dad, I miss you too. But other than that, you’ve don’t the best you could. I’m happy, Jack is happy. That’s because of you and the choices you made to raise us. You touch so many people’s lives, never underestimate that.’ She gave him a hug.
‘She seemed nice.’ After Cas shut the front door.
‘Cas, this is Donna. She’s my martial arts instructor. She’s trying to drag me out to train this morning. Can you help me persuade her that I need to stay here and eat greasy food instead?’
Ben is stood behind him with a similar smile. Dean swaggers past with more fish and into the kitchen, ‘What did I tell you Jack, you’re with an expert! Cas, where do you keep the pans?’ he calls over his shoulder, already unloading things from the fridge.
‘I miss him, Sam, I do. But this is for the best.’
‘Cas? You here?’
‘I get it from my dad!’ Claire was flushed with excitement.
‘Ah, right. Got turned down. Well a stiff drink will fix that.’
‘I’ll make you dinner later.’ Dean sprints to the kitchen to check the fridge. ‘Guys, enchiladas or fajitas?’
‘Dean, you can talk to me.’
Cas grimaces, ‘Don’t be. Not for me. My brother and I didn’t get on. His mother was a wonderful woman. She soon saw the real man my brother was. She tried to leave, it was a freak accident. She was running away, he was chasing her, they both got hit by a truck. It was pure chance Jack was in the pram on the side of the road, not in Kelly’s arms.’ He sighed, ‘She would have loved the young man he’s grown into so much.’
He didn’t even return Sam and Eileen’s calls. He text Eileen and told her he just needed a bit of space. He was sure Dean had told them the full story.
‘Goodbye Dean. And my shoulder.’
‘No idea what you’re talking about.’
‘You can if you like. Sorta hoping we could hang out. I don’t get much down time with friends.’ Cas is again conscious of Dean’s apparent need for friendship. He doesn’t seem to have many people who care for him from what he has told Cas. Lots of people who surround him, but few who actually want to be his friend for who he is rather than what he can do for them.
He ponders a moment longer.
‘It’s over. She agreed it was for the best. I’m gonna miss Ben so much though.’
It was Dean Jr’s turn to look harrowed. ‘She was kidnapped. She was pregnant. Whoever it was did something, she lost the baby, we think they harnessed power from them both somehow.’
‘Cas. You remember I flew down to LA to apologise to you?’
The head peered out, largely covered in a thick had with ear flaps and a scarf over most of his lower face.
‘Hilarious as usual Dean. I was wondering how often you get to go out unnoticed.’
They stayed like that for what seemed like hours, before Dean realised where they were.
Sam, ever the astute observer, saw the agony in Cas’ face. Came to talk to him, tried to find out what was going on. Cas refused to say. He didn’t want to cause issues between Dean and Lisa.
The next few weeks are hell at work. Things get quickly out of hand. His supposed new partner Crowley is out to make himself look good and that’s his only goal. If he makes Cas look bad in the process, so be it. A totally, Cas thinks that’s a plus in Crowley’s book.
‘Cas. You remember when there was that article about you and me.’ Cas nods. ‘Are you annoyed at what happened because they may have outed you, or  because they thought I was your boyfriend?’
It didn’t take long. ‘Hello Dean’. He was home.
‘Not recently! Come on Cas. I’ve told you, I’m not going back there with her.’
It wasn’t one Cas had written. She’s right. It’s certainly one of the angrier songs Dean has ever written. It was not long after Cas moved out.
John almost chokes as Rowena eyes him up and down.
The man sighs, ‘Please. I know he’s here. I need to find him. Urgently.’
She looked around. ‘Right. When was the last time you were here?’
He was in the middle of telling them about a song that he and Dean were going to play on when Cas’ breath caught in his throat.
The weekend before principle filming began, Dean decided he needed a night out. He called Cas and suggested they go for dinner. Jack and Ben were spending the night with another friend they had made on set at a sleepover.
‘I assume he told you?’
Sam knew what he was trying to say. ‘Deaf? No, but he worked as a translator, a respectable job, unlike his namesake’.
‘Yes Dean. I don’t need the money obviously, but it will help with Claire’s college fund.’
‘You’re my nephew?’
‘You? You’ve been acting, I don’t know, not you the whole time. What is it?’
Sam and Dean exchange a look. John laughs, ‘It’s ok boys, so long as it wasn’t wasted. Tell me I at least took yellow eyes down with me?’
Cas wins every round hands down. They start giving him whisky chasers with his beer to slow him down, but nothing has an effect.
‘What the hell!? It’s Christmas. It’s about spending time with your family. Have you forgotten?’
‘That it?’
He approaches Ellen who is cleaning glasses. ‘Do you have a place for me to crash Ellen?’ She gives him a look. He knows that look. He chooses to ignore her.
The remainder of the evening is nice, Dean basks in the glow of having Sam and Jack with them.
A soft knock on the door was followed by Eileen’s head peering in. She smiled at him and held out a cup of coffee.
Dean couldn’t form words, he was so angry. He wanted to punch sense into Cas. How could he think he wouldn’t want to see him. He missed him so much. Surely Cas had been able to watch, see how much his death had affected Dean.
The atmosphere shifted. Things became tense. They all decided to head to bed rather than address the elephant in the room.
‘She’s telling the truth guys.’
Dean shifted, looked guilty.
Cas marches over and peels back the ice, exploding swollen bruising turning purple and a cankle that has grown even more in size. He regards Dean with steely eyes.
‘You asked whose face I’m imagining when I swing this axe. It’s my own. Promise me Claire, your life will be less of a mess than mine? Don’t introduce your future partner to me, just tell them Cas is your Dad. Pretend I don’t exist, I will only complicate everything.’
Mrs Harvelle’s gaze intensified. ‘Claire, I understand that you think you are grown up and in many ways you are, but that man seemed quite a lot older than you. Does your father know?’
‘Shall we get a cab together?’ Dean’s heart rate sped up.
Dean knocked on the door, hissing loudly, ‘Cas! Just next week. Please listen to me.’ He didn’t get a reply. He tried the door handle. It didn’t budge. He didn’t want to shout and bang on the door and wake up the boys, he resolved to speak to Cas in the morning. Explain properly.
‘This is Lisa’s place?’
‘Wow, Cas. He’s a bit of a dick.’
He can’t pinpoint what it is. He’s a very strange guy. But that’s what makes him so loveable. He’s brutally honest. Which some people might find off putting, but Dean thinks is hilarious.
‘I’ll be along soon. With Eileen.’ Dean smiled warmly at his brother and pulled him in for another hug. He wanted to hear all about their life, from both of them. He got in the car and drove back to The Roadhouse.
Dean decides to try writing again. He had been living off savings and now everything is settled he has bought a new house for him and Ben in LA. He can’t face going back to Texas and he’s only round the corner from Sam. Sam nags him about looking after himself, his diet, exercise etc etc. He tries to be bothered. But the whiskey bottle is more appealing. It numbs the empty feeling.
‘Yeah. Plus no one is expecting me to be here, if I don’t look directly at anyone or speak, no one will notice me.’
Albeit by a somewhat unusual method, Dean feels like some normality has returned to his life. He can speak to his angel, (his? That’s a new one he’ll need to think about) regularly, he’s with Sammy, he’s getting to know his nephew. It’s all good.
‘So, uh, do you guys have plans for Thanksgiving?’
‘Yeah of course he does, his mom does too. I’m sure they’ll be by in the next few days to say hello.’
He wakes up to a slammed door. When he comes downstairs Eileen is red faced. She doesn’t see him come in so he waves at her to attract her attention. Tears start to flow when she sees him.
‘Or I could come to you?’
‘He does his best.’
Cas stops at the bottom of the stairs and stands, stock still, looking at John.
‘Well, seeing, pretty loose thing ... not the point Cas.’
Rowena was in the corner reviewing the Book of the Damned to see if it had anything useful. She spoke up after a few hours.
‘Well, thank you Dean. This has been a most fascinating interview.’
Sam and Eileen refuse to let Cas and Dean help clear up. They make their way to the garden and sit on the deck, catching up, staring at the stars.
‘Dean...’
Sam knows a lawyer. His name is Nick but he goes by the nickname Lucifer because to face him in court is to to up against the devil. He always wins. Dean calls him as soon as his office opens and books an appointment.
She looked at him, brow furrowed.
Their performance the next day was in LA. Cas arranged for Claire to go to a sleepover with a friend and decided to drop by to watch the show. He didn’t tell Dean.
Dean let’s out a long breath. ‘Uh, yeah ok. But I don’t have anything with me.’
Jack was his usual oddball self, disappearing for hours to come back with random flower samples, which Cas took great delight in trying to name.  Claire grilled him on her crushes to find out which ones were nice people (not many) and who Jack could introduce her to (none, Jack, she’s not even 17, so help me).
‘Something smells delicious Dean.’ Mary came into the room, fully dressed.
‘Oh great.’
Dean, on the other hand, hasn’t quite got used to his independent daughter and seemed to want to rewind time. The discussion became heated with Claire stomping upstairs, shouting at Dean that it wasn’t fair that he dropped in and out of her life and he couldn’t try and control what she did for one week a year.
Cas packs up his truck quickly the following morning, once breakfast has kicked in and made him feel more human, he’s keen to get going and make it to the city between morning and evening rush hour. He’s checked his route on his phone and is reviewing the map he brought as a back up when Dean saunters into the kitchen.
Dean was stunned. Lisa had never wanted to be with him again. Getting back together with Dean was clearly cover. Neither of them could afford for the affair to come out, it would wreck their businesses which thrived on trustworthy ness.
‘Is everything ok Dean?’
‘Don’t you ‘oh yes Sam’ me, Cas. Even with that appalling disguise I recognised that face. At what point were you going to tell me that Claire’s father is Dean Winchester?’
‘Yeah. It’s no picket fence, but I think you’ll like it.’
‘Not too weird playing third wheel to true love’s young dream?’ Cas had told her about the engagement.
‘She definitely is! This is a break, what are you, Ross and Rachel?’
Cas closes his mouth in a firm line, getting up from his chair in Chuck’s office. ‘Well, I better get started on this project. I’ll leave you to it.’
Sam continued, ‘Eileen and I have been looking for it for years. Figured if we could get in here, maybe we could adapt it, get into the Empty…’ he trailed off, a pained expression on his face.
After being checked over by the doctor at the hospital Cas is diagnosed with a mild concussion and is sent home with a worried Sam and Eileen.
‘I wrote this.’
He braved a look up at Cas’ face which was just inches away. He could see the fire in the ice blue eyes. Could feel the waves of love pouring out of them.
‘Take it you guys are here for the premier at the weekend?’
John’s eyes are glistening after his older son steps back.
‘What do you mean you’re bored and lonely, where’s Cas?’
When he gets to his room Dean drops his bags and slumps on his bed. What was he thinking? Why was he here?
Her English teacher came up to her. ‘Hello Claire. A quick word please?’ She liked English, was good at it. She wracked her brain as to what could be wrong.
‘What?’ His head snaps round, breaking his reverie, ‘yeah fine man. Just tired. Didn’t catch my four hours.’ He tries a smirk, it doesn’t quite work.
He pointed to the door. ‘There, that’s where Claire took her first steps into your arms while I took a video. Over here is where I fell over drunk and dislocated my shoulder and you popped it back in before taking me to hospital. My whole life is you, and you’re not here.’
“I did,” Dean agreed. “Cas, I love you, too. I have for longer than I can remember now.” He laughed, rueful. Cas’s eyes were wide, wondering. “I thought your being an angel meant you could never feel for me what I feel for you. Imagine my shock.”
Jack smiled shyly, scuffing his foot against the floor. “I know. I understand better what that means now, I think.”
Cas looked at Dean, frowning, before he looked back up at Jack. “You... You absorbed God’s power. And... Amara?”
Sam circled the table, leaning down to examine the page. His shoulders tensed. “Holy shit.” He looked at Dean, eyes bright. “Dean, I think this is it.”
Jack’s smile was bright and eager and so, so young. “Can we go home?”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas’s eyes were warmer than Dean had ever seen them, even in his bemusement. “Are you really here?”
“I’m not.”
Dean swallows thickly. “You’re sure?”
“I came to get you.” Dean stroked his face. He was really awake. Dean could finally...
His heart clenched and tugged. Dean slowed to a stop. His heart pulled insistently to one side. When he turned in place, the pulling continued in the same direction. Dean followed the pull, hope swelling in his chest. The grip around his heart felt like Cas.
“As you wish.”
“A spell,” Dean said, scanning the page. “I think.” He hesitated. “Maybe.” He winced. “It’s something, anyway, and it’s the first reference to the Empty I’ve ever seen. Assuming this is a reference to the Empty at all.”
“I... I think we have everything in the Bunker.” Sam laughed. “I think I can do this spell. Dean, I think I can get you into the Empty.”
A knock rapped lightly on his door.
“Bitch,” Dean returned. Letting go, Dean stepped into the spell circle. He turned to face Sam. “Wish me luck.”
. There must be... But only Jack ever managed anything. And now Jack is gone, and...” He laughed, desperate. “There’s nothing. I can’t think of anything.” He hit the bed, tears finally falling.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Come on, Sammy, you really think I didn’t notice?” He grinned. “You’ve been texting her since we got back to the Bunker. You don’t need to keep away from her for my sake, you know. I want you to be happy, even if I...”
“I can keep an eye on everything,” she said, gently. “You should stay with your family. While you sleep, we’ll fix things together. But during the day, you’ll be simply human.”
Cas rested his hand on the top of Jack’s head. “Jack, you don’t have to be anyone but yourself. You... I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I did. I don’t want you to feel like you’re no longer anything but your duty. I want you to be happy.”
“Oh, good. You found him!”
The darkness in front of him felt like it was
.” She shoved him hard enough that he went flying. “
Eileen pressed herself against Sam’s side, love in her eyes. Dean felt something inside himself finally relax and release. Sammy was gonna be just fine, now. They all were. He glanced at Jack, kneeling to pet Miracle, tugging on her soft ears.
Dean’s eyes fell to Cas’s mouth. He sighed. “You really had to go and die without me. And without even letting me tell you...” Dean closed his eyes. “Cas, I’m not going to leave here without you. I love you.”
Dean bent his head and sealed their lips in a chaste kiss. Cas’s lips were cool against his, softer than a man’s lips had any right to be. Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s, his hand resting on his chest.
Dean kissed him again, his cheeks warm. Cas’s smile made kissing difficult, but Dean could hardly blame him, not when his own answering smile was just as wide. Cas’s mouth was warm and perfect against his. Dean wanted to kiss Cas forever. He never wanted to stop.
Dean pushed himself back to his feet, winded. “Then wake him up,” he coughed, “and we’ll be going.”
Dean nodded quickly. “Do we have food? I’m starving.”
found him,” she said.
, everything was black. There was just... nothing. It reminded him of something he saw on a documentary once, that the reaches of space were more “nothing” than “something.” That you could float off in a direction forever, and never find another planet or moon or sun or anything.
. You can’t
They blinked, and then they were standing back in the Bunker where Dean and Sam had performed the spell. Sam was asleep in an armchair.
Dean gripped his shoulder. “Okay,” he said. “Okay. Let’s get to work.”
He heaved a sigh, but let it go. It was hard to be bothered about things when he had Cas by his side again. Jack looked between them both and darted forward, hugging them both tightly. Dean wrapped an arm around him on reflex.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. Cas sat up, and Dean leaned back in. “I know exactly what you mean.”
“If I can’t get Cas back... I don’t know if there’s anything left for me here.” He touched Sam’s shoulder. “I love you, Sammy, but without Cas... I can’t keep going like this. Not again. I’m not strong enough for that, not after everything.”
The snow flurry had quickened to the point that he could barely make out the road in front of him. The gloom of twilight wasn’t helping matters. His headlights bounced off an object ahead. He squinted to see through the snow. Was that a car off in the edge of the trees?
‘The same as 34. I’m not sure why anyone asks that on a birthday.’ He stops, realising his comment was a little rude. ‘I just mean that you don’t notice the passing of the years at the time. It’s only when you look back at what used to be that you really notice the change.’
Dean came into view, dressed in shorts, flip flops and sunglasses. Anna let out a gasp and went purple. He bent down to look at the camera, putting his sunglasses up on his head, ‘Everything ok Claire?’
‘Sure. You got a hot date?’
‘Sure Jack. Have fun.’
Oh no, he’s not in the mood for drama.
‘No, now if you please. Look there’s a giant piano there just waiting to be used.’ Rowena looked at him through her eyelashes with a sly smile.
Or, maybe, probably, he’s got better things to do now he’s got his mojo back. It’s fine. He’ll have forgotten all about Dean now that he’s back in heaven looking after his son, the new God. Dean was just a blip in the radar during in his infinite lifespan. Probably already forgotten.
‘Of course. He’s gotta do what he’s gotta do.’
‘No, let me finish. This might be the end of me, tonight. You need to know your worth. How much you mean to me.’
Behind the bar Dean lets out a snort. ‘Ha, that’s a joke. Unless he’s doing it by accident in some misguided attempt to act honourably or for the greater good.’
Dean ducked back into the oven. He has enjoyed spending the last few days together, but he hasn’t missed it. Felt like he and Cas had formed a mini, albeit temporary he knew that, family unit. He couldn’t let Lisa know that.
Cas picked up his phone. ‘I’ll talk to Charlie, she’s the pro. She’ll know how best to do it.’ Dean nodded.
‘Are you sure? I could tell you more about how you are the most beautiful soul I have ever seen. How bright it burns. How you made me rebel from heaven. Turn away from god and all the angels and billions of years of life before you arrived. I could tell you that was all because of you Dean?’ While he was speaking Cas was slowly pulling Dean closer. Dean couldn’t look at him, just stared at his hand on his arm.
‘I’m sorry Dean.’
Ben was distraught, pleading with his dad.
‘Sure Cas. But please be careful, he is my son.’
It’s cosy.
How this had happened he had no idea. He didn’t like men. But his few dates with women since ending his marriage had done nothing to reinvigorate his previously healthy appetite for women. They didn’t have the same sparkle in their eyes, the jet black hair he wanted to run his hands through, the hilarious dry wit, the calm understanding and support. He was gone. In every way possible. On one of the most famous and desirable people alive. Who certainly did not reciprocate his feelings. Dean was so screwed.
‘Well, that’s better than a total bust. Not your type?’
Cas makes an effort to try and work out a pattern of when Luke will appear. He’s starting to see a trend between certain contracts that Marv deals with and him. Cas also begins to suspect that perhaps Luke might be the mastermind behind everything. There was always something that didn’t quite add up with Marv.
She smirked, the whole group were instantly on their phones adding the event to their calendar.
‘You’ll come?’ Cas’ head whips round in shock.
Cas paused, then steeled himself, turned to face Dean fully. ‘If we could ever be more than friends, I would count myself the luckiest man in the world.’
“Yeah?” Dean said, voice rough.
” Sam pulled back, determined. “And I won’t give up until you see him again. I will
come home. We love you. We missed you!” He rested his hand on Jack’s head. “You’re family.”
Dean’s eyes drooped as he walked. He felt tired, down to his bones. More tired than he had ever felt. He put one foot in front of the other.
“Will you remove my Grace?” Cas pulled back, caressing his cheek. “I want it to be you.”
Cas, blue eyes bright with understanding, took Dean’s hand, fingers closing around the bottle. “Then you can keep it.”
“Dean, I can’t... I’m not going to give up on you, either.”
“This might just be the best day of my life,” Dean said. “I’m not dreaming, am I? We weren’t hunting a Djinn?”
“We will. We
“That’s what’s been keeping me up,” Dean said. “I can’t think of anything, but there must be
Dean squeezed his hand, guilt clogging his throat.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, this hardly counts. How else was I supposed to get my angel back? The Empty and I had a deal, and Cas wasn’t waking up.” Remembering his endless walk through nothing, Dean frowned. “How long was I gone?”
Cas seemed to be thinking something similar, his hand stroking Jack’s back. “Jack, you don’t have to do everything alone,” he said, voice low and soothing. “You can always come home. Whenever you want, for however long you want.”
“I made a promise, Dean.”
Dean shuddered. He swallowed. “You have a deal.”
The song changed to something a bit quicker, something Dean had never heard before. “I love this song,” Dean cheered, pulling Cas into something resembling a quick waltz.
“I think... I want to remove my grace,” Cas said.
Sam pulled him in close. “I’ll start researching. Maybe... Maybe there’s something. Maybe we just haven’t found it yet.” He fisted his hand in the back of Dean’s shirt. “We won’t give up. Not until we find him.”
Being unable to see anything was deeply disorienting. There was no difference when he closed his eyes. Unless he was looking at himself, there was just... nothing.
Dean rolled his eyes. “And what if I want to keep it?” He stepped up between Cas’s legs. He looked up, unable to explain himself further.
Cas leaned in, their lips meeting softly once, twice. Dean gripped the back of Cas’s head, tilting his head to deepen the kiss. He could have this, he realized. Cas was really here. Cas loved him. Between kisses, Cas stroked his hands over Dean’s shoulders, arms, back, sides, like he couldn’t believe it was real either.
Cas shook his head with a soft laugh. “Home, Dean. Let’s go home.”
Sam glanced over the book again, double checking his chalk, his bowl of herbs, everything he’d collected and prepared. Dean watched, gut churning.
Dean laughed, but it was bitter. “I can’t just... leave it like this. I can’t, Sam. It’s not fair.”
Dean sat up. “Really?”
The was he ducked his head down against their chests reminded him suddenly of Ben, the way he’d hugged Dean when he was living with them.
Dean yelped.
“I’m sure. If you do it... I think it won’t hurt, if it’s you.” Cas’s eyes shining. His angel blade slid out of his sleeve and into his free hand.
Jack raised his head, eyes wide. “I can?”
“Sammy, wake up” Dean said.
“Yes, Jack.” Cas smiled at them both. Dean squeezed his hand. “Let’s go home.”
“I don’t want to waste another moment.” Cas’s eyes dropped. “Even being an angel wasn’t enough to stop me loving you, but... It does dampen everything.”
“Will I what?” Dean asked, dizzy from holding his breath and considering the merits of skipping dinner.
here?”
No Cas. Cas who loved him. Cas who died for him. Cas who smiled so sadly, who thought Dean didn’t...
give up. I’ll have faith, even if you can’t.”
“That’s right.” Jack pressed a hand over his chest. “She’s always with me. She says ‘hello.’ But, Dean, now that you’ve found Cas, I can take you back to Sam. And then the Empty will finally be able to sleep again.”
Tears rolled down his cheeks. Did he really come all this way just to fail?
Cas relaxed. “Thank you.”
Sam let out a shaky breath. “I... I understand. I can’t make any promises, but... I won’t spend my whole life trying to get you back. That’s the best I can give you.”
Dean shook his head. “I didn’t get a chance. I was so shocked, and... He shoved me away, and then disappeared.” He felt tears prick at his eyes. “Sam, I never got to tell him. He never knew. I... Sam, I—”
Dean sat up, and hunched over. Cas didn’t know. Cas really didn’t know. All this time, and Dean never got to tell him. He never got to...
Cas looked surprised. “Retiring? From hunting?”
“Yeah,” he agreed. “I’m getting older, and... I’ve always been resigned to hunting. It was never something I chose to do. Not willingly.” He turned to face Cas. “We don’t have to fight anymore,” Dean said, heart pounding. “Never again, if we don’t want to.”
Dean took the blade. “Hang on.” He hopped off the hood and opened the trunk. He rifled through its contents until he found what he was looking for: a small bottle. Just large enough to hold an angel’s grace.
“I think so.” Sam stooped over the table, eyes clenched shut. He took a deep breath. “Okay.” Sam turned and tugged Dean into a tight hug. “You get our angel, and you bring him back here. Don’t leave without him.”
“Yes. This is the fifteenth.” Cas looked smug, like it was only his due. It was looked good on him. “And I love you, too.”
“What if... What if we never do?”
Sam lifted his head. “Dean...”
“Jack?” Cas asked, “How are
here?” she snapped. “You’re not allowed to
Dean felt panic building in his chest. “Cas,” he begged. “Cas, buddy.” He took a shuddering breath, closing his eyes. What was he supposed to do? “You selfish son of a bitch. You can’t just... You can’t leave me again, Cas. I can’t do this without you.” He dropped his head, clutching Cas’s coat. His shoulders shook. “I’ve always needed you, Cas. You make me better. You make me
“Join the club.” Dean dropped his head back down. “I didn’t tell you everything,” he admitted. “Before. When we lost... When Cas.” He took a breath. Let it out slowly. “When Cas sacrificed himself, Cas—he—” Dean forced himself to breathe and raised his head. He met Sam’s wary eyes. “Cas told me he loved me.”
Dean and Cas pulled away. Jack was smiling brightly down at them.
Dean could see himself, but there was nothing else. He wasn’t sure how he was standing or what he was standing on, but here he was.
After the reception finally slowed to a lazy end, after waving Sam and Eileen off to enjoy their honeymoon, Dean and Cas slid into the Impala, Jack toppling into the backseat. Dean grinned at Cas, warmth filling him to the brim. “Where do you want to go, handsome?”
Sam’s eyes went wide; tears welled up. “Did you...?”
“No, Dean, it isn’t your fault. Circumstances...” He gave a rueful smile. “We needed me at full strength, but now...”
“She did,” Sam laughed. “She showed up a few days ago. Said I was taking too long.”
Eileen scoffed. “
Dean dropped his newest attempt onto the table with a heavy sigh and a heavier thud. Months of research with no results. Dean wasn’t sure how much more he could take. The book landed open, pages flipping on their own and then settling. Dean stared down at the book. For a second, it was like he could feel Jack in the room with them. “Uh, Sam?” He kept staring. “I think I found something.”
And then he finally saw something. Something tan. Dean’s heart leapt. His walk turned to a run, energy returning. He skidded to a halt and took in the first thing he’d seen since he started.
Jack seemed surprised, but he closed his eyes, concentrating. “Oh, she is awake. Well, that’s not good.” He crossed his arms. “Okay, I’ll take anyone who’s awake back out. Otherwise the Empty won’t be able to go back to sleep.”
“Let’s get inside, and I’ll patch you up, huh, angel?”
And walked.
Dean’s heart broke. “Of course you can, kid.” He shook his head. “God or not, you’re still a Winchester. You’re still one of us.”
“You shouldn’t have—” Cas’s brow furrowed. “You kissed me.”
‘Cas, I wanted to, just apologise for Dad.’
‘I helped a fellow traveller who was stranded in the snow.’
‘Sam heard you groaning.’ Her smile was wicked, relishing his pain.
Dean is sick of it. He was doing it to get more influence over the show, try to improve things he could see that weren’t quite right. Maybe get a director gig out of it. It’s become too much. He’s sick of everything. He wants out of the film business. He’s thinking of retiring. He’s nearing 40, that’s a reasonable age, right? Give up the gig. He can’t deal with all of this anymore. He’s exhausted.
‘Please Dean. I understand now. This was about so much more than me. And yes, it was just you, so much of it was you.’ Dean gave a small nod.
‘You did?’
‘You want the good news or the bad news?’
Castiel nods. He’s starting to enjoy being called Cas. Certainly better than Cassie.
Cas is usually the master strategist. He enjoys plotting his moves and trying to worm out the tactics of the other players.
‘Dean, please will you remove your socks from the kitchen side.’ Dean rolls his eyes as he complies.
He was heading towards the exit, leaving Ben behind to carry on the party. He had had enough of schmoozing for one night. A hand on his shoulder gave him pause. He knew instinctively who it was.
Claire and Dean looked at one another, slightly shocked.
‘Woah woah woah. What did you find?’
‘The one thing I want I can’t have?’
It turns out Dean’s ankle is broken. He’s in a cast for several weeks. He finds it the most frustrating experience. The silver lining is, however, that Cas cancelled a planned trip and fusses over him like a (stern) mother hen.
‘What about him Sam? I knew there was a new drummer. Keeps raving about how good he is. Sounds like he’s a good drinking pal too, they always seem to be out on the town together.’
They sit in a companionable silence for a while, watching the TV. Dean reaches out to hold Cas’ hand. Eventually Cas drops his head onto Dean’s shoulder. Soon he feels him fall asleep. Dean settles down, smiling to himself as he also dozes off, thinking about just how lucky he is.
Dean was outside vigorously pulling posts out the ground. Cas was stood next to him with a huge swathe of fabric in his hands. They were clearly in the middle of an argument, Dean venting his frustrations on the posts in front of him. Cas, resigned, waiting for him to work through his anger. This was a familiar sight to Claire.
‘Can we hitch a ride back to 1972 Jack?’
‘Wow!’
‘I’m beat, but I don’t want to leave you alone on your birthday. Want to come and watch a film in my suite?’
‘How do you do that Dad? She came and sat down next to Cas. He put his arm around her.
She was in the bathroom when she heard the notes of a different kind of music. Of an electric guitar. She couldn’t recall having seen one in their setup. She listened more closely as she left the bathroom. It was a Bon Jovi cover, much more her style of music. She picked up the pace to get back to the dance floor, but stopped in shock as she got back to the hall to see the dance floor filled with people squashed to the front of the room.
The Irish bar is gloomy, air stale. Dean seems much more at home. They stroll to the bar. Dean greets the bartender like an old friend.
‘Thank you for listening to my woes. Sorry I can’t stick around. Have a good evening.’ He stands up off the bar stool.
After scouting the bar for potential options, Meg calls it a bust and they sit down with their drinks.
‘No, he’s gone to visit his grandfather this weekend. I’m also at a loose end.’
‘Claire, what the hell? You said your dad did stuff in the music industry, we thought it was boring paperwork stuff!’
‘I thought we lost you. In the ambulance. It was odd, you said ‘Goodbye Dean’. If I hadn’t seen it come from your mouth I would have sworn it was Cas.’ Sam shook his head. ‘You were gone. For a long time.’
Eventually he gets a text that evening.
You’ve got a choice to make. I want you to choose to live.’
Gabriel watches the exchange with growing excitement. ‘Guys, can we start filming this as background.’ Dean makes a hasty retreat as Ben shows Cas how to do  a ‘cool guy’ handshake. It’s frankly hilarious. Gabriel catches it all on film. He asks them to read some dialogue, they nail the emotion of the scene, in Dean’s opinion. Gabriel seems very pleased.
‘Did the house come with its own personal supply of catwalk models?’ Lisa ignores the proffered hand and walks towards Dean who has reappeared on the stairs. ‘I’m heading to the airport, I’ll be out of your hair soon.’
‘Come on Cas, it’s nearly time.’ Cas could see Dean starting to look worried on the stage, looking around for Sam.
‘I’ve got a function, next week, for work. Would you come with me?’
Eileen commented, ‘He would make an excellent housewife for someone one day!’
She looked down, remembering how miserable Cas had seemed.
‘Is this an announcement of a new relationship? You’ve moved on from Meg?’
‘What are we going to do with him?’
His phone buzzes with an almost instant reply.
Cas is drying the dishes after dinner on Sunday evening as Dean strolls in. He was exempt from dish duty as he had cooked them all dinner, and had gone outside for some fresh air. His cheeks were pink from the cold. The snow storm gone as suddenly as it appears, making way for some warmer, if still fresh, spring air. It was still chilly once the sun started to disappear.
Dean has held out hope for years that he and Cas could repair their friendship. That they could become close once again. Since Cas had left Dean had felt a void.
That was all it took for Dean’s resolve to fail and he fell into Cas sobbing, gripping onto his lapels.
‘He’s my brother’s son. He was orphaned very young.’
The rest of Dean’s visit went by in a flash. He was soon heading out to Oregon and on to Canada. But true to his word, he started rejigging his tour dates around Claire’s school breaks. He would come to stay with them whenever possible. He had his own room and started leaving clothes and possessions at the house.
‘Smoothy, Sam?’ Cas looked up from the blender.
‘I haven’t had a girlfriend in a long time.’ Dean looked down at his glass, ‘not sure love is for me. It never works out well.’
Sam chooses that moment to stroll through the front door. Lisa is a small woman, Sam towers over her.
‘And is that why you’ve teamed back up with your old writing partner, Jimmy? It’s been, what, five years since you wrote with him? I was at your gig recently. You can really feel his influence on that one song, ‘Profound Bond’. Its a real shift away from the last album, Perdition, where he didn’t collaborate on any of the songs.’
Castiel looked startled. ‘Your new gig?’
‘Uh, yes, but please don’t say anything to anyone.’
‘So what did you get up to over spring break then Claire?’ She was catching up with her study group after returning to Stanford last week from her break.
‘I needed to tell you. But you don’t need to worry. The Empty will only come when I am truly happy. That’s not likely to happen at the moment, given the circumstances.’
Sam and Dean took the opportunity to kick back and take some time away from constant work. They seemed to get ten years younger within about a day. Dean was relishing seeing Claire and Jack together again.
‘Oh yeah Dad, that would be cool. I can do ASL at school. I know a few bits.’ Claire proceeded to sign to introduce herself to Eileen. Eileen beamed.
‘I’m very much looking forward to coffee again next week Dean. I feel we have a real connection.’
He tried to speak. Found a tube in his throat stopping him. He tried to move. He couldn’t. The machines started beeping wildly. Sam jumped up, doctors and nurses flooded the room.
‘Dean, this is Balthasar. We used to date in college.’
‘I don’t care how rusty they are. Brush them off, dust them down, polish them up, but you’re doing this job whether you like it or not. The team is extremely dysfunctional. It needs strong leadership.’
He speaks to Dean occasionally, but their easy back and forth is gone. Cas thinks perhaps Dean was disappointed he hadn’t visited. But he’s not sure. Maybe he’s moved on. Realised having a friend on the opposite coast isn’t that convenient.
‘And Cas.’
Cas was thinking about Balthasar. About his other abortive attempts at dating before. He was trying to think of an actual serious date he had been on, and he was struggling to find anything note worthy in the last ten years.
‘I think that means never, if he could get away with it, dearie.’
Cas smiles, remembering the way Dean used to fuss round him, Claire and Jack, being a protective mother hen. He nodded. ‘He’ll make a good husband to a lucky woman one day.’
‘When are you from Dad?’
‘Great! I’m sure it will be lovely.’ Sam ushers him inside.
They agree to keep things light for their son’s sake. Not make a big deal of it. Maybe absence would make the heart grow fonder.
“You got it, boss.” Dean grinned, patting Sam’s back. “I love you, man. I’ll see you on the other side.”
Jack turned, wide-eyed. “We can do that?”
“What can we do?” Sam asked, softly. “Do we know of a way to get to the Empty? Is there anything... Anything we can do to reach him?”
Dean groaned. “Oh, you just
Dean shrugged, but didn’t argue. “I always knew I might be a good dancer. Just couldn’t find the right partner.”
“It was very romantic, Dean.” Cas’s expression hadn’t changed, but Dean could read the smugness in the familiar lines. “You’re not embarrassed, are you?”
She stormed close to him, looming impossibly over him. “You’re
Dean blinked, and when he opened his eyes, he couldn’t see.
Dean and Cas sat on the hood of the Impala, leaning back, their faces tilted toward the sun. Cas’s hand was warm beneath Dean’s.
His hand rose and fell. Dean startled, lifting his face. Blue pierced him to his core. A cool hand rested atop his. He gasped. Cas wiped away one of Dean’s tears.
“Luck.” Sam smiled weakly. And then he began to chant, the words flowing smooth and practiced. As he neared the end of his incantation, Sam lit a match and dropped it into the bowl he prepared. He looked up, meeting Dean’s eyes.
Cas pinched his waist, hard.
When he stepped back into Cas’s sight, Cas understood what he meant to do at once. He smiled. “There’s no need to save it, Dean. I won’t want it back.”
The wispy blue light dripped from the cut, seeping out, glowing brightly in the setting sun. Cas grit his teeth, hissing out a sharp breath. Dean caught his grace in the bottle, stopping the top when it was finished. He kissed the side of Cas’s neck.
“Eileen, Jack, and I will cook. You two go.” Sam winked. “Enjoy the sun.”
, Sammy.” He smiled. “I want you to live a good life. I want you to finally find Eileen.”
Jack smiled, benevolent. “I’m allowed to go wherever I like now. And I know I said I wasn’t going to be intervening, but it didn’t seem right to leave everything so... broken. In this world or any of the others.”
It’s just, Cas.
Dean nodded. She was lying. He knew because he felt the same. Had for a while now.
‘Dean is a good man, he deserves nice friends.’ Lisa purses her lips.
He played it over again, stretching and adjusting the tempo. He had clearly heard it being played.
He heads to the bar to grab another drink. Only to be cornered by Charlie.
A whisky chaser and a beer bottle are placed in front of him by Ellen. ‘Best thing about heaven, no hangovers.’
Apparently he managed to drift off to sleep. He was woken abruptly by the front door slamming and Dean calling his name loudly.
Benny looks at him for a few seconds, clearly making a decision before he answers. ‘I knew Cas was your best friend, I know he’s Claire’s dad, I even knew he was in love with you.’ Dean tries to respond but Benny holds his hand out to stop him, ‘He is Dean. Even you can’t be so blind as to not know.’ He takes a sip of his drink. ‘Have you always been in love with him too?’
‘Dean,’ Sam has his soft eyes, ‘I did explain to him that him moving out was only temporary.’
‘I already am.’ Cas is surprised by the big smile from the man across the table. He doesn’t know what to make of him really. He’s certainly different to how he expected him to be. Of course the bravado was there, the film star smile. But there was a vulnerability under it that Cas would never have expected.
Fine. Maybe he had offended Cas somehow, an accidental comment that reminded him of Meg.
Cas let a small smile grace his lips. ‘I’m pleased for you Dean.’
‘How so?’
‘So, Sam, how has the new duet been going down during the tour?’
‘It’s nothing Charlie.’ Castiel’s voice is calm and reassuring after the punch in Dean’s gut he delivered a few moments before.
Sam looked up at his brother, a question in his eyes. Dean let out a resigned sigh.
‘Dean? Is everything alright? What happened at your party?’
There’s a knock at the door an hour and a half later.
Cas looks at her surprised, ‘We’ve never been together.’
Lisa laughed. ‘Modest as ever. No this, being a family.’
‘Think I’m going to head for a shower the bed, long day of travelling really taken it out of me.’ He gathers his bags and heads towards the stairs, catching sight of the paused TV.
‘Yes, no, not that. I, uh, have been putting off speaking to you.’
‘Too much pie for him?’ She asked, looking at the empty seat the other side of him.
Dean guffaws, he knows Eileen takes no prisoners. It must have been hilarious.
Dean’s voice was on fire. He was mesmerising. Cas couldn’t stop staring as he sung the melody and lyrics they had worked on together all those years ago.
‘Come on, you know you love the Dead Men Walking songs as well, if you wanted to stay for the main act, I’ve heard you sing along to them all the time. You know all the words!’
Sam sighs and gives a resigned nod.
Jody ponders, ‘Maybe you’ll find someone on set?’
‘Thank you. Are you his driver?’
She seems to know what’s going on and gives him some words of encouragement. She promises work closely with him and help. He knows she’s trying to be nice, but he barely pays her any mind.
Ben and Jack wolf down the cookies and soon start a game of soccer. Dean has forgotten what it’s like to have that much energy.
They were enjoying the disconnect from their normal lives. They ignored the news and only checked their phones once a day for emergencies.
Dean glares back, he’s not sure what she’s talking about but won’t give her the satisfaction of asking.
‘I’m not that! Damn tabloids.’ Cas stares. He had no idea.
Dean has tried to deny his feelings for so long. Tried to persuade himself it was just close friendship he craved. But having seen Cas today, he knew now that he could no longer deny it, to himself at least. He was in love with Cas.
‘Sure.’
‘You won’t bring Dean?’
Once breakfast is over, Donna heads off, making Cas promise she’ll get to see him again before they leave town.
‘Cas, I’m trying to be a better man. I want to do what’s best and live up to your opinion of me. I will keep trying. I miss you. I always will but I respect your decision and will let you go. Please know that I will always be here if you ever need me.’
‘Oh.’
Dean splutters his drink. Sam’s eyebrows raise. ‘Lisa? She still around? Haven’t heard you mention her in months.’
Dean snorts. ‘Calm down. I’m fine. The leg’s still attached. Just a bit sore and swollen.’
Castiel explains, ‘It was Balthazar’s idea. He runs my PR. He has this protection strategy. So people don’t go digging into my private life, I have high profile relationships every now and then. Usually with co-stars so it’s good for ratings. But they aren’t real. It’s a deal on both sides, helps us all out.’
Cas stopped short when he caught Sam and Claire watching, sighed and ran his hands through his hair. He sat down inside, exhausted. ‘That man will be the death of me.’
They stroll outside, heading to their respective cars. As Dean and Cas reach the door they spot fireworks in the distance. The group stand and watch for a moment.
‘Divorce?’
Thanksgiving itself was a success. Dean stuffed them all silly.
‘Your car is already inside. There’s an inspection pit and all your tools too.’
Dean nodded. He hated to admit it but he knew what Cas was talking about. Because some small part of him was trying to do that, trying to make himself a new family unit with a mother for Claire. It took Cas almost leaving without her to see that she didn’t need anyone else other than Cas. So he gave her to him.
‘You do deserve it.’ This stops Dean’s pacing.
‘I’m fine Gabe, thank you for your concern.’ The second drink was gone within seconds of being placed before Dean. Gabriel wisely chose not to comment again.
‘That’s what Mom thought, she did some investigating, before... Is she here?’ Sam nods.
Dean raked his hand through his hair. How could he stop Cas leaving now?
‘My name is Dean Robert Winchester.’ His voice is surprisingly measured for someone just thrown on a bar, ‘My father is Sam and my mother is Eileen.’ Dean’s hands release slightly in surprise allowing the man on the bar to turn his head slightly to look back at Dean. ‘You must be my long dead uncle? Now will you please tell me where my father is?’
Amara comes in with a warm smile two take away coffees and brownies for them. She kisses Dean on the forehead before turning her attention to his leg.
Dean took a breath, didn’t think, just replied, ‘Yes.’
Cas didn’t answer. He just stared at Dean. ‘Uh, I mean, only if you want it to.’ He fidgeted with the collar on his jacket.
‘Yes. I would like you to. You’re very welcome.’ Cas tries to force out a normal sentence.
A car door slams.
They both turned to look back at Cas. ‘Don’t you want to come?’
‘Just a scratch, I’m fine.’
‘The bunker?’ Cas nods. He slowly descends the stairs. ‘Well you’re always welcome here, as usual.’ Cas nods again but doesn’t say anything. He carried on looking around. Picks up some objects, things that Dean was sure had long since been destroyed. Thumbs some books. Cas nods again. Is he not going to say anything?
‘He is.’ Cas looks confused.
‘You mean you still love me?’ Cas flushed.
‘Sooo, Jimmy Angelo, why did you and Dean stop writing together?’
Then Dean spots a headline on a gossip magazine while out shopping for groceries. ‘Castiel Novak engaged?’
‘Dean, meet my friend Meg.’
He could hear them whispering above his head. ‘Hey, I can hear you damnit.’ He tried to stand fully and walk forwards. That was a mistake.
Sam nodded sagely and they buried their heads back in the books. They had been at it a few hours when Cas came rushing in. ‘I think we need to put this on hold Dean, I’m hearing murmurings on angel radio. I think Michael is nearby.’
‘Hello Dean.’
‘Right, now if I’m done with your couples counselling, I need you to take me shopping?’
‘I need to go. Now.’ He stated tersely.
He loses himself to the smell of the alcohol, to the hubbub of the party around him.
He coughs quietly, ‘Good morning.’
They shared a small smile, remembering Jody and their first weeks together. Cas had arrived first, Eileen had followed about a month later.
‘That’s it, thanks man.’
‘How did you know where to find me?’
‘I’m sorry Dean.’ He stands awkwardly, Dean reaches over and pulls him into a hug as well. ‘It’s ok kid.’
‘No, the neighbour.’
Cas has never been more pleased to see Gabriel.
‘Uh, Cas, I’ve been meaning to speak to you. I’ve had a chat with Sam. He’s ok with you moving back in next week. So would you mind?’ It all came out jumbled. Cas’ face was white with shock. He looked at Dean without speaking.
Cas shifts around for a few hours before he gives up on sleep.
They loaded the car and drove off. Claire and Jack both fell asleep in the car after an hour or so leaving Cas with his thoughts.
‘Cas, you’ve got your real family right here.’ He reached out to pull Cas into a hug. After a brief moment of resistance Cas gave in. They stood there for a few moments.
Cas’ mouth falls open.
‘It’s ok, I’m getting special Cas vision. He’s sent me up with a direct video link.’ Sam looks baffled.
Cas was behaving oddly too. She suggested inviting his date on a second date, Cas declined. He did however invite him over when Rowena was coming for dinner the following weekend.
‘No need, Cas and I are old friends.’
Cas blurts out a laugh, ‘I could never play in front of an audience Dean. That’s for you and Sam. It’s not me.’
‘Dean Winchester.’ Ellen’s reaching under the bar now, no doubt for a gun. Dean doesn’t think there’s actually one there, but you never know. Dean is almost at the man’s side, suddenly feeling naked without a knife or a gun at his side himself. He needs to find out how to sort that out. He’ll need to speak with Jack, he puts the thought out of his mind for the moment, readying to take the guy down.
Even Dean has to agree that the view was worth it. He’s smiling at Cas’ exclamation at the beauty and commentary about things they were seeing (adding to the pilot’s explanation with little snippets of detail). Cas had a beam a mile wide by the time they set back down.
‘We miss you too, Dad.’
Cas turned around and slowly the scene changed. A forest floor replacing the lake, trees replacing mountains, the wood of the cabin changing. Dean didn’t recognise their new location.
‘Worth a shot.’ Sam shrugged.
‘Are you sure? It might not work and then I’ll be back to, ummm...’
Just how could he explain that to his brother?
‘Eloquent Cas.’ He shrugs in response, unsure what else Dean wants from him.
She squeals. ‘I didn’t know he was even in town, wonder what he’s up to. Why is he here, does this seem like his kind of place? Do I look ok? Shall I go for it?’
‘Ellen has leftovers for you, then I thought we could find a film to watch? Wait out the storm?’ Cas nodded and followed them downstairs.
He thought of Sam as the little brother he’d never had. Cas, well Cas was something else. He couldn’t put his finger on it. His best friend, even though he’d only known the man briefly. Something about them just clicked immediately. Cas was nothing like his public image. He was weird and dorky and had a great dry sense of humour and knew little to no pop culture references (Dean was teaching him, don’t worry). Dean found everything about the man fascinating. And it seemed Cas felt similarly. He chose to spend as much time as he could with Dean.
‘Sure!’
‘I see him most of all. He likes to come by and sit on the porch and hear about you and Sam as kids. We talk about the apocalypse and Jack. The angels, and god. It’s heavy stuff.’ Bobby gives Dean a sideways glance, ‘but you are his favourite topic of conversation.’
‘I’m just trying to work out what’s best to do for Claire.’ He sighed, ‘Do you think we should send her to stay with you during holidays? So she gets more time with you?’
Pamela walked up and slapped him on the arm. ‘So that gorgeous hunk is what that angel who scorched me all that time ago looks like?’ Dean snorted.
When the song finished the group of teenagers went wild. After signing autographs for most of the room Dean and Sam fought their way outside. Sam caught Cas’ eye and motioned that they would head back to his. Cas nodded almost imperceptibly.
‘So you don’t know?’
‘I wouldn’t know, Dean, I’ve never been on one. I drive for convenience.’
‘What about for fun?’
Dean furrowed his brow and continued manning the frying pan.
After 5 hours his usual alarm, that he had forgotten to cancel, went off. He dragged himself out of bed and booked a flight. He didn’t know what he has been thinking coming down here. He could have apologised over the phone.
‘Ben’s great. Anyone there I know?’
‘I’m sorry Cas. I should never have doubted you.’
He turned to see Sam and Eileen at the door watching closely. Jimmy walked over to hug Sam as well and Dean heard him thank him as well, before Sam introduced Eileen.
‘No, but Dean, don’t be weird. He’s still your friend.’
‘Thank you Dean,’ he pulls his phone out of his pocket, ‘I need to call a cab, what’s your address?’
‘He’s out. Jack did it.’
‘Dean, she’s grown up now. Plus are you telling me you tell Cas about all your first dates so he can vet them?’
Dean stares for a moment then cackles with laughter.
‘Dad, look, shall we just head back and we can work out what’s going on, how to sort this out. We’ll do some research. And try and explain some stuff that’s happened since, uh, you’ve been gone.’
He lies in bed that night, thinking of Sam’s brother and his hard, glinting green eyes. Somewhere along the line those eyes merge with his favourite actor, the one from Romancing the Stone, Dean Winchester. His dreams are filled with sharp witted, green eyed heroes who come to whisk him off his feet. There are worse dreams to be had.
‘Dean, don’t worry, I can teach you some basic signs if you like?’
‘Always Sam.’
‘Hey Claire,’ Jack holds up his hand in greeting. ‘Did you enjoy the show? I heard your dad got VIP tickets for all your friends too?’ He peers around her to the group standing with their jaws somewhere around their knees. He gives a little wave.
‘I’m sorry I’m intruding on family dinner. I can go.’ Cas stands near the door. The others have gone through to the next room, Dean is almost at the doorway. He stops and turns back at Cas’ words.
‘No, I think you should judge for yourself.’
Jack comes bursting through the door at dinner time, an excited smile on his face, with a fishing rod and a string of fish that he thrusts into Cas’ face.
Cas didn’t stir, his chest didn’t move. He remained perfectly still.
She didn’t say anything, but Dean knew what she was thinking anyway. The anger that had burned in his chest for so long was finally gone. Banked into something warm and gentle. Loving. He was finally free of it all.
Dean sighed. “No.”
Jack blinked hard, like he couldn’t figure out what to do with that. He glowed briefly, and then Amara was standing beside him.
There was nothing.
Cas shook his head. “You are ridiculous, Dean Winchester.” But Cas didn’t let go of his hand. And he couldn’t keep the smile off his face, either.
Her eyes flashed, her fists clenched. “Everything was finally
“Sam?” a woman’s voice called from the hallway. Eileen rounded the corner, her face lighting up. “Dean! Cas! Jack!” She rushed over, signing quickly at Sam. She hugged each of them in turn. Miracle trotted in after her, tail wagging like crazy.
here.”
Dean laughed. “Anything we want.”
Sam’s glee was obvious. “My brother, the romantic.” He laughed. “I thought you hated chick flick moments!”
Sam came inside and sat on the edge of Dean’s bed. “Dean, I’m so sorry.”
Amara rolled her eyes. “We’re divine, Jack. We can do anything.”
Dean couldn’t seem to stop smiling. Cas’s hands were warm on his waist and in his own hand. The music was jazzy and warm, and Dean hummed along, giving Cas a twirl. Cas rolled his eyes.
“You better, jerk.”
. You must be
Sam sat up from where he’d been in a despondent slouch. “What is it?”
She scoffed. “Whatever. Get going then.” And then she vanished. And there was nothing again. Nothing but the dark.
to tell him.”
Sam winced. “Uh, it’s been a, uh. A week.”
wake him up.” Her eyes narrowed. “You find him and wake him up, and you can have him. You give up or fail, and the three of us all go back to sleep. And you stay forever.”
Dean stared up at his ceiling, thoughts whirling in endless circles, chasing sleep away. God replaced, free will reigning supreme, just him and Sam, alone together in the Bunker. No mission. Nothing forcing their way forward.
Sam floundered, jumping to his feet. His eyes went wide as he took everyone in. His eyes grew wet. “Cas, Jack...!” And then Sam was wrapping them all up in a tight hug. “Dean, how?”
Dean kept walking. It might have been hours. It could have been days. Weeks. But still, he walked, following his heart.
Cas’s smile was small, but Dean could practically feel the joy rolling off Cas in waves. “I’d like that, Dean.” He turned his hand over, lacing their fingers together. “What would we do instead?”
Jack beamed. Dean tugged him back against his chest. “Idiot,” he muttered, “you and your dad both, always making the sacrifice play.”
“Well,” Dean pushed to his feet, “what are we waiting for?”
Sam opened the door and leaned against the jamb. “I can’t sleep,” he said.
Dean took a long breath.
Dean was starting to feel more content. But, he couldn’t help but dwell on the people who were missing today.
The next few days were filled with cosy fires, snow ball fights, delicious food and a warm feeling of contentment for all.
‘I’ve missed this.’
‘Hey, that’s not fair! You can’t talk about me right in front of me!’
Dean’s mouth is opening and closing like a fish. He can’t speak. His palms are sweaty. His heart is racing.
He deleted and blocked Dean’s number when he got to the airport, crying the whole flight home. He knew he had done it for Dean’s benefit, but it was so painful, he wanted to curl up and ignore the world, shut everything out.
A few people wander over notebooks open.
Bobby was inside at the bar this time, harassing Ellen. Jo was sat at a table chatting to Ash. Charlie was trying to persuade them to join in a game of D&D. Ash looked up for it, but Jo was sceptical. They all stopped when Dean came through the door.
‘Cas...’ Dean took a step towards him, tears in his eyes, ‘I’ve missed you so much.’ He launched himself at Cas, pulling him close into a hug. It seemed to last forever. But Cas pulled back eventually.
He turns slowly, raising his glass ‘Good choice.’
She’s in a good mood, badgering him to come to the party.
‘No. But she’s got someone very caring who loves her like his own daughter. A good friend of mine. My best friend in fact.’
Dean cleared his throat. ‘You don’t have to.’
‘I don’t know exactly, but something happened. There was a big disturbance. Rowena came to see me. We tried to work it out. We couldn’t find anything. She thinks it may be something in the past. She thinks someone is trying to change things.’
