By the way he nodded in silence, I realized - alas, way too late - that his enthusiasm was apparently due to the fact that he still worried about his friend. His visions of Sherlocks and my future helped him rid his thoughts of those worries. Unfortunately I knew all too well that nothing was easy.
This still wasn’t the right time. He didn’t want Sherlock to touch him because he felt like he had to, and he didn’t want their first time to be the result of his horny dreams. “No, no I’m--I can manage.” He cringed. God, why was this so difficult? “I think I’m going to, uh,” he cleared his throat, “go to the loo, get ready for the day, get Rosie up.”
. She kept this from him. All that time, she kept him completely in the dark, even after he knew about her former occupation. John felt his fists start to shake--since when had he balled his hands into fists?
“No, it’s from something else,” Sherlock said, monotone. “I’m going to put this back,” he held up the washcloth. “Be right back.” He pulled the dressing gown around himself and got up from the coffee table, walking to the bathroom where their laundry basket was.
“Come back,” John said. “I see the look in your eyes. You’re not fully here with me. What went wrong?”
John sat back, giving him room, lead dropping into his stomach when Sherlock sat up as quickly as he could and walked briskly into the bathroom.
“It is a big piece of fruit for a one year-old,” John said, standing up. “Rosie, how ‘bout you watch
Sherlock put both tablets into his mouth and washed them down with one long gulp of water. The ends of his hair was starting to dry, and it was getting frizzy.
“It’s my turn to touch you,” Sherlock said, sitting up and, in a swift move, pinning John down onto the mattress, hands around his wrists, bent knees by his sides.
While John was occupied with Rosie, Sherlock sent text messages to Lestrade and Molly, telling them that John’s memory was gone and he thought they were married. They were just as shocked as Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock normally had no problem lying to them, and he was feeling less uncomfortable this time around than when he told Mrs. Hudson, until Lestrade texted,
Yeah, I started to actually think about the Other Sherlock and made myself sad, so I pass it onto you~~~
John snorted. He loved those little ways about Sherlock, how precise and, frankly, ridiculous he was. “Well, I’m here.” John swallowed. He was supposed to make things right. He had to be braver than he was in the first timeline. He had to at least take the first step towards them becoming...well, he still didn’t know if Sherlock truly felt anything for him, but he wanted them to end up closer than they were in the other timeline. John’s hand gripped the end of the armrest for support, feeling a little anxious about saying something so simple.
John felt him swallow and he trembled. Lifting his head, he nodded and tried to take off Sherlock’s shirt as he tried to take off John’s, and their arms and elbows bumped together.
“John, there’s--” The words stopped dead in his throat, and it felt like an ice block fell into the pit of his stomach, his eyes widening, his limbs freezing, heart stopping.
“Hello, John.” Now that he was actually here, he was a little apprehensive. Humor. Humor always lightens the mood (except when he tried it at the restaurant when he came back from the dead, but he didn’t want to think about that now). “I thought you could give me a hand,” he said, and held up his (increasingly) bleeding hand.
John seriously hoped he wasn’t taking drugs again, but that thought was secondary. He should have been panicking, he supposed, but he felt like all of the tears in his body had already been shed, and the fear fizzled into nothingness after sending the letter. He was numb. He didn’t think Sherlock could say anything that would surprise him. He didn’t even bother getting up. “How’d you get in here?” he asked tiredly, his chest empty.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. His ribs were aching. In his condition, giving up the ghost would have been completely believable.
to me, John?” whimpered, eyes squeezing shut, hands balling into fists, clutching at his hair. “I can’t do this, so that’s why I used.” He was talking quickly again, and his chest was contracting. His breathing was so quick and sharp that it sounded like he was about to take an actual panic attack.
John tried to keep himself awake for the rest of the night, but his head was on the uninjured side of Sherlock’s chest as he texted rapidly, muttering to himself about the cases, and his deep voice and heartbeat against John’s ear made his eyes slip shut against his will. He kept blinking awake, but Sherlock, the caring bastard, started to stroke his hair slowly and type with one hand.
A small quirk of his lips. “I can see the outline of the jewelry box in your pocket--not much of a deduction.”
Sherlock did, uncoordinated at first, but his body naturally synced to John’s rhythmic thrusting, and then they were both panting and trembling as slick sounds filled the room.
“Whenever you’re ready,” John ran his thumb over his knuckles. “We’ll take things one step at a time.”
A hard lump in his throat was preventing John from breathing. He shut the door carefully and left the bathroom, almost fleeing upstairs to his room. He shut the door behind him and slapped a hand over his mouth, a gasping sob leaving his lips as he squeezed his eyes shut. He climbed into bed and stared at the ceiling, memories of how happy and youthful Sherlock had been flashing behind his eyes. When Rosie started to fuss half past 5, John realized he didn’t sleep for a single minute.
“When you’ve waited this long? I think so. I’m glad you liked it. It felt risky just diving in like that--no pun intended--”
John, on the other hand, felt all of the blood rush out of his face. “I--I thought,” he said weakly.
“Don’t be,” Sherlock said, putting down the book he had been reading and crossing his legs in his chair. The position made his ribs hurt a little, but he ignored it. After realizing how distressed John was yesterday, he couldn’t find it in himself to feel angry. Mycroft would call him stupid for that, but he didn’t care. They were both at their worst, weren’t they? They were both failing to cope with the misery Mary had inflicted upon them (inadvertently. Advertently? Sherlock wasn’t sure anymore). They were
John put down his coffee mug to concentrate. All things considered, this wasn’t the weirdest way Sherlock started off his morning. It had been worse when John had to deal with actual, physical body parts in their flat. He squinted at his screen.
Sherlock looked stricken, and John hated that he put that look on his face. “Because...you’re my friend,” he said slowly, cautiously, voice laced with evident confusion.
“I really am,” John said, pecking the tip of his nose, his chest aching with fondness. “I love you, too.”
Actually, this would serve as a good opportunity for Sherlock to attempt to temporarily mend his friendship with John, until he told him about the pregnancy and Mary told all. He shouldn’t wait it out; it was uncommon for John to initiate interaction first, and he might think Sherlock didn’t want to speak to him for a while. He still didn’t know how he was going to convince John that he could be a suitable romantic partner, but getting them back on speaking-terms was a good start. John would want to go on the case with him, right? Even if he declined, this would let John know that Sherlock wasn’t actually angry with him, not anymore. Perhaps he should have been, perhaps he should have had more self-respect, but he didn’t like being angry. He was only hurt. He just wanted to spend time with John before the end of their friendship. His stomach rolled unpleasantly at the thought.
He clicked the audio file again, then again, then again until tears flowed. Tears turned to sobs, sobs turned to wailing and wailing turned to animalistic howls. He dropped to his knees on the floor beside the bed, bent double, gnashing his teeth, keening in agony.
The curly headed man stared out of the window, closed his eyes for a moment, opened them again and blinked several more times.
At breakfast he did not appear. When I cleaned the tables after the meal, I saw him scurry into the kitchen and disappear shortly afterwards with a single green apple. Stunned, I turned to Brother Elijah, who was just entering the refectory.
"You are right," he admitted, "there was a small problem, but it is now being looked after. There is really no reason to feel worried or frightened. "
The openness and trust in that smile momentarily took John’s breath away. The Sherlock that greeted him this morning was unlike any version of his flatmate John had ever encountered.
Taking her hand, John cleared his throat. “Mary. I think we need to. Um, you know. Live apart from each other. A lot of things have changed for us lately. And we need to evaluate if this is working … for both of us now.” John’s gaze had dropped to the floor as he spoke but he met her eyes at the end, hopeful that she understood.
“Stop apologizing for things you couldn’t have known.” Sherlock shrugged his shoulders impatiently. “Remove these so I can shower.”
After I had done everything in my power, I could only wait and see. The nurse who had given me admission earlier came to me, put a cup of tea in my hand, and sat down next to me.
The shock of my painful loss slowly dawned. Again and again I tried to convince myself that it had just been nothing more than a fleeting flirtation, nice, but just entertaining. Sherlock and I had experienced many things together, perhaps more than any other person would have encountered in his entire life - but now it was over and I had to accept the fact. I devoted myself to my work fully, went out after work with colleagues in the pub and could almost claim to have regained something like my normal
After a few minutes of quiet comfort, the novice had quieted and breathed a soft 'thank you'. He was about to get up when his gaze fell on Brother William and his face froze into a mask of terror. He pressed his hand to his mouth to suppress a scream and only then did I realize what frightened him:
The Father smiled. Apparently the idea of a pharmaceutically active brother of the Order seemed a little absurd. At the thought of it, quite different things came to mind - for example, that I already knew about the herb garden and the shed. It was doubtless near the room in which the honey extractor was situated. On my last visit, I had already noticed the dried herbs that hung in small bundles from the ceiling - but above all I thought of what had happened in this room between Brother William and myself. His honeyed finger in my mouth. Unconsciously, I ran my tongue over my lips. The priest looked at me so I hurriedly gave him an answer.
“Someone built a bonfire. We stayed out for hours. I was too little to slide down the hill alone but my parents, Harry, my other relatives took turns taking me. And afterwards we had hot cocoa in the big farmhouse kitchen while our fingers and toes thawed.”
So far it went well for me. Pushing back and moving quickly, I strode to the elevators at the far end of the lobby and headed up to the fifth floor, where a few meters later I found myself in front of a wide metal and frosted glass door. To my left, I spotted a small room separated from the corridor by a sash window. There was no one to see, but at the side of the window I saw a doorbell, which I pressed with trembling hands. Now it was all or nothing.
As soon as I turned the corner and out of sight, I put the tray down on a window sill and unfolded the small piece of paper that the blond had given to me. His handwriting was small, the script almost girly-no comparison to the scribble I myself called handwriting. But what astonished me much more than the outward form of the message was its content. Jonah had written only one sentence, in fact only two words - and yet they said so much more than a whole essay could have done:
John’s constraint nearly crumbled when the read the last sentence of Sherlock’s note. He bit his lips to hold back the mournful sound that threatened to erupt from his chest. He needed to get home to his laptop immediately. He needed to listen to the phone call, to hear Sherlock’s voice and his own, in order to believe it was true.
continued to text, and Sherlock had no intention of cancelling their plans. He’d eat, share a glass of wine with John, and hopefully be less than half an hour late.
“I told you, I have plans.” Sherlock’s tone showed that he’d retreated into himself again. He spoke into his mobile, face also stony.
Jonah was a novice, thus he’d lived less than a year in this convent, as otherwise he would have already taken his profession - at least this was what I had learned as part of the novice class. Had Brother William decided only recently to take a vow of silence? Might they previously have known each other better? Or maybe I was not the only one with whom he took his obligations not-so-seriously? My head spun - I just did not understand what it was with this man. The way he represented himself to the outside world, how he conformed with the things his brethren told me about him, just did not fit the personal experiences that I myself had had with him. He was undoubtedly an extremely intelligent man who possessed many talents which he provided for the benefit of the order - but I had begun to have slight doubts in my heart about how Prior Lambert vaunted his deep spirituality. If his faith was important to him, and particularly with the religious life that he seemed to take so seriously - why had he broken his vow? Out of 'interest', as he had so candidly asserted? How it turned and twisted in my mind - the nocturnal visit he had paid me - it just did not fit into the picture. And I had a slow-creeping suspicion that I had imagined it all. It would not surprise me currently - the chemical equilibrium of my body was stirred up anew each time I met the curly head.
“Don’t be upset,” he said softly. “I’m trying to tell you that’s all over now,” he gently ran his thumb over his lip. “I’m here for you, Sherlock, one-hundred percent.”
John laughed. “Of course you did. So, I figured this is one of the really good parts about being a couple; we can distract each other from the shite in the world.”
John attempted to continue his Anatomy homework, but found himself reading the same lines over and over again; that was, until his phone vibrated again. John had to face the truth: he wasn’t going to get any homework done tonight.
“Do you? I always assumed you pissed your money drinking twice your weight in booze,” John snapped out, his heart thumping wildly with adrenaline.
John hung up his phone before dialing Sherlock’s number. He put the phone to his ear and pulled back onto the road, already driving towards Sherlock’s house—almost as if by instinct. He really, really hoped that Sherlock was home.
John dashed passed the drunk and ran downstairs as fast as his legs could take him. He grabbed the car keys off of the kitchen counter and made a mad dash for his car. Thankfully, his mother wasn’t home. John didn’t want his father taking his rage out on his mum again. John revved the engine and peeled out, terrified that his father was coming after him. John sped off down the street before pulling out his phone and seeing new texts from Sherlock.
“What. Happened. To. You?” He enunciated, clearly aggravated that John was trying to beat around the bush.
He could hear his mother sniffling and he felt the tears finally pool over onto his cheeks. John pulled over to the side of the road and parked his car, feeling his heart cracking in two at the sound of his mother’s sobs.
The blonde stood extremely still, and barely even breathed. He was on-edge, his muscles rigid with stress, like a loaded spring ready to pop off at any moment. He knew the drill, and was ready for the first shot to go off.
John’s smile slid right off of his lips as he stared coldly at his father, his jaw flexing from frustration.
John jerked his head out of Sherlock’s grasp, taking a step away from him, “Can we—I don’t want to talk about it, alright? Please.”
John looked up and watched as Sherlock’s face fell into an expression of shock and horror. He saw the worry creep into Sherlock’s beautiful baby blue irises. Beautiful? He meant peculiar. Yeah—peculiar.
John’s lips perked up into a small smile, his voice a bit hoarse as he spoke, “Too late, I just did.”
John would cry until he felt like he was going to puke out his own lungs. He cried until his throat hurt more than the parts of his body where his dad’s fists slammed into. He cried until he was so drained of energy, that he would just pass out soon after his father left the room. He cried hoping someone would hear him. He cried hoping someone would save him.
John pulled into Sherlock’s driveway and breathed a sigh of relief when he put his car in park. He climbed out of the car and walked up to Sherlock’s front door, knocking briefly on the posh mahogany wood. John rocked back and forth on his feet as he waited, his eyes fixated on the ground as an attempt to hide his face as long as he could.
That traitor! But Sherlock had no time to be angry at Lestrade now. His jaw dropped, his heart raced, and he stopped breathing. John knew. His mouth shut with a click of his teeth, he started breathing again, and his eyes closed in shame, his cheeks heating, heart twisting. That was
John gasped. “Rosie, no--” he made a move to walk towards them, but stopped. Sherlock looked hurt and confused.
“He always drinks too much!” Mary said in exasperation. “He texted me to come get him before he passed out!”
sounds above him, his grunts gradually turning into whines, his legs shifting and socked feet shuffling on the floor.
John’s face softened and a small furrow appeared between his eyebrows. He put his hand on top of Sherlock’s. “Sorry for ever calling you a machine,” he said sadly.
John sighed. “Yeah, okay, sorry for making assumptions, I guess.” He licked his lips. “Am I a good father?”
John kissed his forehead. “I’ll be back in a sec.” He washed off his hand and grabbed a washcloth for Sherlock, tossing it to him when he re-entered the bedroom.
Sherlock allowed himself to be embraced, breathing deeply, his back moving up and down in John’s arms. “Oh,” he said softly.
She rolled her eyes, tossing the bucket aside. “I told you, Sherlock. I simply offered her money. She’s homeless and she needed it. Simple. John told me about your network before, and I thought at least one of them would be able to help me, so I picked one that seemed particularly vulnerable.”
“Surprisingly so.” His eyelashes fluttered when John’s strong fingers entered his mass of curls, rubbing his scalp gently. He let out a long sigh and melted like butter into John’s lap and the sofa, his spine tingling from the sensation of his skin and hair being lightly kneaded. This was good. This was better than any pill. The pain slowly started to go away in his head, and Sherlock found that his eyes were closed. He heard the front door open, but couldn’t be bothered to open his eyes.
He took a deep breath. “Don’t. I know what you’re thinking. My body may need time to heal, but my mind does not. I told you I want to move on. Please. I know how you feel about it, and you don’t need to say anything more.”
Sherlock was aware that he was breathing heavily, and it this point, his whole body had broken out in a sweat. He bit his lip hard, and somehow, it was easier to say to a serial killer. He was staring right into John’s beautiful face, and it made him speechless.
Sherlock looked like he was trying to control his expression. “Interesting, yes,” he said coolly. “That’s a way to put it.”
Sherlock untangled his arms from their embrace around John. “Where do you want me?” he asked, sounding slightly nervous.
“Usually,” John nodded, “but last night, I fell right asleep and wasn’t even thinking of it.” Sherlock had decided it was time to give his first blow job, and it zapped all the energy out of John. That wasn’t even enough to stop it.
When Sherlock looked back at him, his expression was as if he had just received bad news. His eyes were intense, but not because of their usual laser-like gaze, but because of a remorseful look too striking to ignore.
“Sorry,” John muttered. Maybe he shouldn’t have said it, but he was able to trace the point where their lives went wrong to the Moriarty fiasco, and he couldn’t forgive anyone who ever aided him. He just couldn’t.
she was. She lied, and lied, and lied,” he said in exasperation. “She left me and her baby without any consideration for how her bloody James Bond run away mission would impact us. She was selfish, and she had convinced me that she was different, and I fell for it. But, I’ve done a lot of thinking, and you know what? She wanted to do nothing but hurt us, especially you. I think she hated you,” he said bluntly, “and I could never forgive her for that, or shooting you. I’m tired of her ruining us, and I want to leave her in the past.” He took a breath. He rambled a bit, there.
“She’s always welcome here,” the smile faded from Mrs. Hudson’s face. “But, is something wrong, John?”
John lifted his head, tears staining his cheeks. “I gotta stop crying,” he wiped his face roughly with the back of his hand. “I’ve got to take care of you.”
Sherlock was absentmindedly twirling the handle of the fork in his hand, staring into space.  He started to look nervous.
John had no idea what to do about his emotional state, but he saw that Sherlock was clearly putting stress on his wound. Fighting past the lump in his throat, he approached Sherlock, reaching out his hands to stop his pacing.
Whether he was about to climax anyway or the unexpected pet name pushed him over the edge, he didn’t know, but suddenly the bubble of pleasure burst and he was coming hard, his eyes opening widely, seeing stars, shouting. John’s thrusts were erratic and hard, and then he was coming, a loud moan tearing out of his throat. With their foreheads together, Sherlock couldn’t fully see John’s face as he came, and for that, he was regretful. But it didn’t bother him much at all, because he felt the hot burst of John’s semen on him, and simply hearing his moans and harsh breaths during his climax was enough.
Honestly, I don't think there will be much more to this story. I think the next chapter will be the breaking point of the tension.
They hugged tightly, hearts beating in sync and breaths trembling with unshed tears, and despite the intense emotions he felt, Sherlock thought he had never been happier. He wanted John to hold him for the rest of the day.
Sherlock audibly exhaled. “You’re wrong,” he mumbled, “you said you’re not brave, but look at you now.”
He always had a sweetness to him that made John’s heart clench. It was true. Sherlock loved him. He felt
There was the sudden sound of the front door downstairs opening and closing, and feet on the stairs.
John thought to himself, the image of Sherlock blowing Magnussen’s brains out flashing before his eyes.
“I had another dream last night,” John said as he gently placed another strip of gauze on his torn skin.
“It is odd,” Sherlock ran his finger over his bottom lip in thought. “I would think any nightmares involving me would involve injury or death, considering recent events. Sorry for that, again.”
But Sherlock had to love him too, then. John was his other half. God, they should have had this talk before. John was joyful, of course, but he wasn’t giddy. He was calm, like he finally came home after being lost for years. Sherlock lifted his head, and put his forehead against John’s, his eyes closed.
John blinked. “Oh. Right.” He took a step towards the chair. “Am I supposed to sit on your lap like you’re Father Christmas?” he joked.
A little flame lit in John’s stomach, enough to make him feel warm and somewhat content. “You had very kind things to say about us--well,” he cleared his throat, “mainly me. Mrs. Hudson cried. In the dream.”
Or, did John only imagine that he added that phrase? Wishful thinking never did him good. “We did,” he said, giving up on the conversation about Sherlock’s love life for now (a selfish part of him was relieved).
Sherlock jolted with a shout, sitting up so quickly and clumsily that he almost fell off the sofa. His heart was hammering, each hard beat rippling anxiety through his body.
John’s lips broke out into a smile, and Sherlock felt himself mirroring it. That felt good. “I do, John, and can I be honest with you?”
God, this man was going to be the end of him. “For masturbation, Sherlock,” John said defensively, letting go of him. “You know, it makes it easier?”
But he did take the case in the other timeline. John wondered if it were because Sherlock was alone at the time, and wanted a distraction from the memories of whatever he recently endured.
John pulled back, heart thumping. He could feel the heat of Sherlock’s cheeks on his face. “We should’ve done this a long time ago,” he murmured.
“Before our relationship, I never started the day with dried semen on my stomach,” Sherlock said. “I don’t know if that’s supposed to be sexy, but I’d rather wash it off.”
“Yes,” he said with a curt nod, “I did say that.” He felt like he was going to burst into flames, but going by how deep Sherlock’s blush was, he wasn’t alone. “How, um, how do you feel about that?”
John covered up the wound. He didn’t speak of his mistakes from the other timeline. There was no point. He closed his kit and put it back in the medicine cabinet. “Come on,” he held out his hand.
John looked away, tension in every one of his muscles. “Well when will it come back?” he asked in a mutter.
He blinked rapidly and put his hand in front of his mouth, embarrassed.  He wordlessly went to the bed and lay down on top of the covers, looking at him with anxious, expecting eyes.
John’s head tilted up, their eyes slid closed, and Sherlock felt the softest touch of lips against his. There was no movement, no tongues or biting, just the gentle, warm, petal-soft pressure of John’s lips. Sherlock felt like he couldn’t breathe, his face on fire. John loved him. John was kissing him. His plan wasn’t a disaster. It worked out. Things actually worked out for him. He couldn’t remember the last time that happened, and nothing as good as this ever happened in his life before.
Sherlock, of course, noticed the change in mood. “What is it?” he asked, looking at John inquisitively.
John didn’t smile back. “We’ve known each other for four years, Sherlock, counting when you were away. Why did it take us this long?”
Blood. There was fresh blood on his back. The dressing gown must have been clinging to open cuts, and taking it off must have opened up some of them up again and made them bleed. There were deep, long wounds on his back, and they looked downright nasty. They were deep, angry, and didn’t look like they were being taken care of very well. A small trail of blood started to trickle from of the lashes in the middle of Sherlock’s back, and John realized his knees were trembling. John’s own skin stung just looking at this. He needed to do something. He needed to help. He needed to
“Dr. Watson is moving back in?” Mycroft asked, sounding genuinely surprised. “He must have really hit his head.”
Sherlock looked at him, and it seemed like his eyes were scanning John’s arms. “Hm. Maybe you could. Don’t.”
But then, John’s face hardened, he stood up straight, and folded his hands behind his back. He swallowed, voice cool, “If that’s how you’re going to be, fine. I’ll go. Goodbye, Sherlock.” He walked away, arms falling by his sides and hands clenching into fists.
“Yeah,” she whispered back, conscious of Sherlock’s (and Irene’s) hawk-like observation skills. “It’s just--what’s she doing here? I came in and got no explanation--”
For once, instead of the other way around, it was like John read his mind. “You didn’t have any wine. Have I seen you drunk before?”
Technically it would be, but from the redness of his cheeks, John could tell Sherlock wasn’t exactly comfortable with stripping right here and now. “We’ve got time.”
Sherlock lifted his head, mouth open, eyebrows furrowed deeply in pure pleasure. His eyes burned with intensity which stole the breath from John.
God, Sherlock was so stupid. He should have been paying more attention. He should have warned John the bar was coming. There had been so much blood coming from his head, enough to stain Sherlock’s scarf as he held it to his wound…He rubbed his eyes. He hadn’t gotten a good night’s sleep since before the case. Each hour that John was still out cold made him grow more and more worried. He wasn’t a doctor like John, but he knew how severe head injuries could be, especially as more time passed. The damage done could be irreparable. Sherlock swallowed down bile. He needed to eat. Too much stomach acid was sloshing around. John would want him to eat. He rubbed his jaw.
The heart monitor was going wild, and Culverton’s words would have stung more if Sherlock’s brain weren’t focused on trying to keep him alive.
“Me too,” John said somberly. “I’m sick of living with her, let alone sharing a damn bed. When you--walked in--truth be told, I was secretly glad.”
He looked down at his shoes as he paid for the bouquet. As he left the shop, he was sure his face was as red as the roses.
With a heavy sigh, John looked at Rosie, who was waking up from her nap, lying on the living room floor on her stomach atop the warm, thick blanket Mrs. Hudson knitted for her.
John didn’t think he ever saw her look that surprised. Nothing ever shook her. It immediately made anxiety bloom in his stomach. “...Yes?”
“You’re not even going to stay until he wakes up?” John asked, although he didn’t especially want Mycroft in the room. His feelings were so mixed--there was the Mary situation, but he remembered how genuinely torn up Mycroft was on the plane when Sherlock overdosed.
“I just don’t understand why she needs to be sent to daycare now,” Sherlock eyed him, as if he knew there was another reason. “She’s not even one. Oh!” his eyes widened. “Her birthday is on Saturday.”
“But you’ve opened up to me, and I promise to cherish that and never let you go down that path again.”
Sherlock remembered the last time John called him that. It was when they were in the train car, right after he returned from the dead, right after John said,
“I see the past twelve hours have been productive for you two,” he commented, a bored frown on his face.
“Well, that’s not hard to believe.” He cleared his throat. “Erm, well, definitely by...you know, the Moriarty thing. Um, I think the Woman was when I realized it was love. Thought it was just attraction before.”
,” he groaned, lip curling into a scowl. “I read your emails to your ex-girlfriends, and you weren't even this bad with them.”
“I don’t recall making any confession,” Culverton said. “Oh, Mr. Holmes, we found three potential recording devices in your coat.”
He shook his head again. “Why’d you want me here, anyway? It couldn’t have been to talk about this.”
“Good morning to you, too,” John said in amusement. “Glad to see you’re in a good mood, Sleeping Beauty.”
Would she try to do that again now? But, this was confirmation that Mary was just as ready to lie in this timeline as she did in the last one.
For the next couple of days, Sherlock’s condition remained the same; he would wake up long enough to eat about twice a day, and would then pass out for several hours straight. Sherlock wasn’t particularly hungry, and John could see why, but he made sure he ate at least a little bit of what was brought to him. John stayed by his side, only leaving to use the loo and grab food from the cafeteria. His was paranoid Mary would find a way to come in, and was relieved each time he came back to the room to find Sherlock safe.
They went back up to the flat in silence, and it felt like someone was grinding Sherlock’s skull at the center of his forehead, the aggravation from Mary giving him an intense headache. He wanted ibuprofen. They got inside, and John took off his coat and shoes and went straight to the kitchen. Sherlock thought he was going to make tea, but instead, he got a bottle of beer from the fridge.
The only other thing that made living slightly bearable was Sherlock, but it was that very situation that made him want to scream and throw things and curse the world.
John had just put Rosie in her crib when he walked to his empty bedroom, feet slowly shuffling along the floor, head down, heart heavy, shoulders hunched, mind clouded with misery. He climbed into bed, stared up at ceiling, and it felt like someone violently snatched his heart and squeezed it. His eyes squeezed shut and he let out a soft, but anguished cry. He slapped a hand over his mouth, not wanting to make enough noise to wake Rosie, and began crying into his palm.
“John was drugged, Mary,” Sherlock told her, unfazed. “Two men tried to attack them, but I drove them off.”
“I didn’t get nearly enough time to kiss you last night.” John felt a bit giddy when Sherlock’s lips parted.
John sighed heavily. Yet another thought that was plaguing his mind last night was on the tip of his tongue. “You’re going to think I’m crazy, but...well, she knew there was no way out from her past, right? And I think she knew I...would react the way I did.”
The sensation went right to his cock, and John wished he’d worn more loose-fitting trousers today. He didn’t think Sherlock noticed, though. “Want me to stop?”
“You can legally change her name,” Sherlock said. “I can badger Mycroft into having the paperwork done for you by the middle of the week.”
Sherlock trembled at the contact to his cock. “Do you want me to take my trousers off?” he asked breathlessly.
He was chewing his lower lip. "Well. With the events of the past year, I thought I permanently fell out of favor."
But then, there was Rosie. John regretted the choices he made with Mary, but he didn't regret Rosie. He couldn’t. Still, he could have divorced Mary right after she shot Sherlock and gotten joint custody of Rosie. John had been thinking of doing that, when he was feeling completely fed up with married life, but then Mary got killed. He never had a chance to make things right, not by telling Mary that he was unfaithful (he didn’t love her, but he did make weddings vows), and not by leaving her for what she did to Sherlock. He felt like he failed every aspect of his life since Sherlock jumped in 2012.
She didn’t buy it. “I wish you’d said something earlier instead of getting in your own bloody head and breaking up with me after taking me out to dinner!”
“Hey, now,” John murmured, and Sherlock was back in his arms, but this time, Sherlock returned the hug, hands going to John’s back, fingers clutching the fabric of his jacket. He remembered how alone and frightened he felt in the bed with Culverton, and he started shaking. If only he’d known then that John would make his desires come true…
Sherlock whined in protest, pressing himself against John. “Gather your belongings as quickly as possible. I want you back here.”
John picked up the remote, and curse him for being left-handed, because he noticed the ring again. “Oh yeah, actually, Sherlock, what is this ring? I don’t wear jewelry.”
Sherlock’s silence made John uneasy. He was always silent when truly in pain...no. No, that wasn’t always true. John remembered how Sherlock was animated and larger than life while ridiculously, dangerously high on the Culverton Smith case. Molly said it herself; he had been dying. He had to have been in pain, but he completely ignored it.
John remembered this, too, when Sherlock made his triumphant return and was adored in the papers again. He knew, too, that Sherlock enjoyed it more than he was letting on.
Rosie, thankfully, removed some of the awkwardness from the air. She was oblivious to the tension in the flat, and was twirling Sherlock’s hair as he held her.
Sherlock smiled warmly. “I’m very glad.” He leaned down and kissed his forehead, then kissed Rosie’s.
Sherlock could only nod silently, clutching to John like his life depended on it. He felt John’s hand gently caress the thick curls at the back of his head.
He didn’t think she could harm him in any way, and he was irresistibly curious. “You have two minutes,” he said firmly. “I’m busy.”
“Oh, please,” she said tiredly. “I know you’re not getting as many calls as you used to. I don’t blame the Yard, not wanting to let a murderer help out.”
When Sherlock woke up, the first thing he registered was feeling warm and unpleasantly sticky around his groin. He grimaced and groaned, knowing exactly what the feeling was. He ran a hand through his hair and opened his eyes. He pulled down the sheets and saw a wet spot at the front of his pants, and he nearly rolled his eyes at himself. He hated nocturnal emissions. They were nothing but a mess to clean up. He only enjoyed self-stimulation when he was awake and he could fully enjoy it. His treacherous mind and body must have dreamt of John while he was asleep, which was an increasingly frequent occurrence. He couldn’t remember the details of the dream, only having a vague recollection of John’s hands on his skin. Then, he fully remembered what happened yesterday, seeing John and Mary, the shame, the fight with John, the phone call from
It did sting, but John’s movements were light, Sherlock wondered if he were this gentle with all of his patients. He pressed his lips together.
“I told you,” worry entered her tone, “there’s nothing for me in England.” She swallowed. “I wanted a life with you, John, and I could never have that.”
The back of Sherlock’s head hurt and his heartbeat was pounding in his ears. The harsh force to his head only made his vision waver more, and he realized he was breathing out of his mouth. He didn’t know what Mary gave him--he couldn’t think--but it must have been strong. Despite the pain and the cold, he felt like he could pass right out again. He could only stare dumbly at Mary, at her eyes filled with steel and hatred.
“Right,” Sherlock closed the lid of his laptop and put it on the bedside table next to him. He looked around the room. “Hm.”
John looked down at Rosie, who was sucking her fist happily. He took a steadying breath. This would be good for them. He just had to figure out how to look Sherlock in the eye without feeling guilty.
“I guess,” John said slowly. “Wouldn’t it have been easier to adopt an older child, one that requires less maintenance?”
“Not as good of a shot as you think you are,” John winked at her, his stomach curling with indecent delight. He deserved this smugness, he thought.
“I suppose I should apologize, too,” Sherlock’s voice lowered further. “I’m sorry for not telling you the truth about how I felt about Irene sooner. I understand now that I was giving mixed messages. I simply didn’t think you felt this way. I didn’t think her idiotic flirtations mattered, and if I saw a sign that you felt more for me than friendship, I pushed it away out of fear of being terribly wrong. There.
But, the knowledge of the other timeline didn’t dampen the excitement they felt on the case, and this time, it really was just the two of them against the rest of the world. John would go back home to Baker Street--not Mary’s, and it was blissfully refreshing.
For god-knows how many times, John wondered why the fuck the universe was so cruel to Sherlock Holmes. “I get it now,” he said thickly. “I do. You were young and hurt, and you told yourself not feeling anything for anyone would be the best option for you.” John touched his shoulder. “Do you miss them, Sherlock? Your friend and your dog?”
Right? Or, no. He married her and had a child with her, but by the end, John could not stand the sight of her. That wasn’t right, but she wasn’t an ordinary person. She was an assassin. She did nothing but lie and hurt others. He shouldn’t have felt guilty over not loving her. He should hate her.
John wasn’t the best at giving advice on this issue. They were a mess and needed to loosen up somehow. Maybe they needed a better icebreaker. “You loosened up last night,” he said. “Remember, when you kissed me?”
“Uh huh,” John said, his arms around Sherlock’s back pulling him closer, and he wanted to kiss that clever, astonished mouth. “I love you,” he said again, and couldn’t believe how easy it was to say it. Maybe because he spent years imagining it. “I’m
A week passed. Whenever Sherlock saw that familiar letterman jacket, or heard John’s (delightful, heartbreaking) laugh down the corridor, he took evasive action. He kept his eyes on the floor, ducked around corners, took unconventional routes, and otherwise made his way to class as quickly as possible. John wasn’t in any of his classes, and he hadn’t shown up in art class since the detention modelling day.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, his mind getting hazy. There was another clack as John added more lube to his fingers. Sherlock gasped as John pushed them deeper than before.
“Shush, no fun for you, Mr. Watson,” the teacher scolded him half-heartedly. “This is your detention, remember.”
“You,” he answered. “And your art. Let me know if you want some one-on-one modeling sessions.” He winked again.
“Next pose, if you will,” the teacher called. John wordlessly shifted on the platform. He thoughtfully turned one hundred twenty degrees so the students in all parts of the room got something new to look at.
A quick kiss and her flushed face was gone from Sherlock's sight. He propped himself up on his elbows in time to see the lips he had just been snogging wrap around the head of his cock. He gasped and shut his eyes, better to feel her fingers tracing up the length of him, her tongue swirling around the head.
“Well,” John said, standing on the top step to leave, but not quite ready to descend. “See you soon, then.”
Sherlock walked back to his spot, a little unsteady on his feet. John had talked to him again, John had touched him, and John had been okay with the suggestive joke. It was a little much to take in. Even Michael (Mike?) had been not entirely insufferable, nice even.
The closer he got, the more Sherlock realized how much trouble he was in. John was a vision. A sheen of sweat covered his smiling face, his compact arms, and the generous amount of thigh that rugby shorts provided. His short hair was sticking up on one side from a nasty roll he’d enduring near the end of the try, and Sherlock could spot a few strands of grass mixed with the dirty blonde. His uniform was rumpled and streaked with mud, which Sherlock would have found offputting on anyone else, but in his current state he could only appreciate how it made the material cling to John’s frame. He watched John’s chest expand and contract, expelling a huff of breath into the crisp evening air.
Sherlock refastened his trousers and leaned on the table with his head in his hands. He concentrated on all the things that usually made his arousal dissipate. Carelessly collected evidence. Insipid party conversations. Yogurt commercials.
It wasn’t until the lead was secure that Molly’s friends started to divulge other, non-rugby details about the captain. Molly claimed that he was pants at chemistry, but he’d been a decent partner for a presentation last semester. She had a fear of public speaking, but with her data and John’s charm, they’d done very well.
What was it about faces that was so difficult?! Drawing them had been simple when it was connected to the rest of the body. Change one little thing, the point of emphasis, and Sherlock was fumbling around like he had never held a pencil before.
The scene skipped ahead as daydreams often do; somehow he was wearing John’s warm ups, the ones with “Watson” printed on the back. John had him backed into the lockers, kissing his neck and telling him, “I like that name on you…”
. He shared his grief over Sherlock with no one else more than Mary. She must have been laughing at him on the inside the whole time. John rose from his knees and got on the bed, lying on his back, the tears dripping down his temples. He closed his eyes. What a fucking mess today turned out to be. Couldn’t he have one normal day?
“I’m glad you did,” John said as he retrieved a pair of tweezers. “Be more careful next time, you git,” he scolded, and grabbed Sherlock’s hand with firmness and gentleness, the touch of a doctor, and the touch of a friend. “It’s not in too deep,” he said, “so it should only be a small pinch.”
He was drying his hair with a towel after his shower when John came downstairs and into the bedroom.
Sherlock put his head on John’s shoulder, curling onto his side and putting his feet on his lap. “We’re too big for chairs,” he mumbled, wrapping his arms around John’s bicep. “Well, at least I am.”
Sherlock looked peaceful, and it warmed John’s heart. He yawned, nose scrunching up, getting multiple chins.
John didn’t say anything, simply staring up at Sherlock, watching his soft smile turn a little puzzled, like he was silently asking
“Started your daily screaming?” he asked her, wiping the tears away from her red, chubby cheeks. “C’mon. Let’s get you breakfast.”
Sherlock talked out of his head last time, too, but John didn’t find it very funny, somehow. At least Sherlock wasn’t panicking like the last time he woke up. “You can’t have it lowered right now. You’re in too much pain.”
Just then, John’s doctor came in with a smile. “Knock, knock,” she said obnoxiously (well, Sherlock thought it was obnoxious).
Sherlock was quiet, a pensive look on his face. “You’re really not angry with me for Moriarty anymore?” he asked in a hushed tone.
Sherlock dimly thought that was one of the main differences between Moriarty and Mary. Moriarty loved games. Mary wanted to do things as quickly and cleanly as possible. Even taking the time to beat him was unusual for her.
“I can help you,” Mary said, leaning down and wrapping her arms around his torso. She lifted him up into a sitting position, placing a cool hand on his cheek and putting the other firmly on his shoulder. Her lipsticked lips pulled up into a smile. “See? There you are.”
An odd moment of silence ended the conversation. John wasn’t really sure if Sherlock wanted to be kissed again, and he was clearly uncomfortable with his lack of romantic and physical experience. Just talking about him ended up like this, with his face red and a big frown. John sighed, thinking about being jealous of Irene, and all the time he wasted. He remembered feeling sick when she texted Sherlock that morning they woke up here. Actually, “Sherlock?”
He cleared his throat, not trusting the steadiness of his voice otherwise. “So am I right to say ‘I love you, too’?”
Sherlock wanted to flee and never return, but his muscles were glued to the chair. Bile sloshed around in his stomach. “That’s illegal,” he spluttered.
I think this story will have, like 3 more chapters? We'll see. I'm posting this before bed so I hope there aren't any mistakes lol
He willed the shaking in his legs to cease, and he stood up straight. He walked out of the cell, ignoring Mary’s pleas. He saw Mycroft down the hall, and called his name. “Your prisoner was trying to conspire with me.”
His body wanted nothing more than to get under the covers. He knew this conversation would be emotional and already felt beyond worn out, but they needed to have this talk. “Tell me what happened back there,” John said. Too tired, too stressed to care about being embarrassed, he told Sherlock, “Tell me why you pulled away if you wanted me to kiss you.”
It was something about Sherlock admitting he didn’t know for something for once, and the pleased, relaxed look on his face, which made John realize he never did tell Sherlock how gorgeous he was. John felt like a boy telling a first crush he thought he was cute. He didn’t know if Sherlock would shrug off any compliment...but something told John that wouldn’t be the case. John placed a hand on the side of his face. “Did I ever tell you you’re the most handsome man I ever met?”
, and John was achingly hard, squirming on his knees. He took more of his cock into his mouth, Sherlock’s deep, shaky moan washing over him like a warm wave.
My lesbian ass trying to care about the men from a show I haven’t been invested in since 2017: What if I made the story about art instead
"Come in, Mrs. Hudson," a bored voice said within the flat. Some awkward position of the sofa, judging by the strain in his tone.
"John, I want you between his legs," Mary instructed. Sherlock spread his knees apart for him to have room to sit. John took his place, having the foresight to bring the bottle of lube with him.
John was watching him intently, licking his own lips and making no attempt to hide the hunger in his expression. If anything, his anticipation seemed to grow when he realized Sherlock was looking. Sherlock closed his mouth around the head of John’s cock and watched with fascination as John’s partially open mouth gaped wider.
Sherlock had to remind himself to keep breathing. “I, uh,” he said with the utmost intelligence, “yes. Of course.”
The girl handed him her pencil sharpener. “That’s the nature of art isn't it? It can’t be completely right. By definition, I mean.”
Mary took his coat at the door. "Good to see you, Sherlock," she greeted him. Her smile wasn't strained or empty. She was legitimately glad that he was here.
He refocused on John. They were so near to each other. John was right there. Right there! If he got up on his elbows he could kiss him. He could kiss that face he had looked across the breakfast table at for years. He could find out what that mouth that produced witty comebacks and beautiful laughter felt like, tasted like. More than anything, he wanted John to look at him and want it too. They were both nearing the end and Sherlock was running out of time to take the chance.
“Cheers,” John said. He started to do the smiling thing again and Sherlock had to evacuate or be rooted to the spot forever.
Whatever happened to that box he had kept these feelings locked away in? He used to be so good at it, hiding his desires- even from himself. His own physical attraction to John had gone unnoticed for an embarrassingly long time. For a detective, he had been rather slow in working that one out.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. He couldn’t remove the image of John’s dumb, perfect smile from his head, but he could destroy the physical evidence that this whole futile endeavor had ever happened. He sat up and pulled his sketchbook out of his book bag.
Sherlock allowed himself a grimace. His back was turned to them anyway. "There's no point in staying."
Sensations coursed through him too fast to catalogue. He didn't know what to focus on. A lengthy moan from Mary meant she was close. Very close. Her trusts grew erratic and Sherlock felt her natural lubrication drip past his condom onto the skin at the base of his cock. Her fingers wrapped tight in the sheets by his shoulders and her head dropped to pant heavy and wet on his neck. If her head was lower, that meant-
John's hand returned by the same route, this time stopping to encircle Sherlock's full girth. He synced the movements of his hands and Sherlock was absolutely panting. The simultaneous internal and external stimulation was overwhelming. He risked a glance at Mary, hoping that she would let him come soon.
Sherlock had experienced his fill of mutual avoidance with classmates. Even if someone were to reach out to him, his usual response was to hide. Simple shyness often morphed into biting remarks, which were really just badly phrased truths.The idea that someone might see all that and still want to get to know him was a hope that Sherlock had long abandoned, but a hope that had resurfaced in the form of John Watson.
how about Sherlock coming to one of John’s rugby games and ending up practically fainting when he sees John all sweaty and dirty?
To the left of him, John had rolled on his own condom and was applying lube to his now fully-erect cock. If Sherlock hadn't known better he would have thought John was masturbating. A dangerous thought crossed the detective's mind; is this what he would have looked like after dark, alone in his room at 221B? A spike of pleasure that had nothing to do with Mary's tongue shot through him. He wanted to watch John come. He wanted to see him gasping, brow creased with concentration as he brought himself to completion. Sherlock groaned with the new wave of arousal, too late to bite back the sound.
John bent to pick up the box from the floor. Sherlock allowed himself a moment to admire the muscles on John’s back. Were those thin red lines from his nails or Mary’s?
That was the difference, Sherlock realized. Mike was just a subject, he knew enough about his gait, his habits in action to draw him accurately, but there was no connection to draw to anything else. With John he saw details (treads lightly on right foot due to past injury, ambidextrous, communicates with everyone on the field evenly) and that only served to deepen his curiosity. What parts of him were part of his life by default and which had he picked up for the sport? Would he still smile at Sherlock if he had not trained himself to be friendly with everyone on his team out of necessity?
There seemed to be some sort of malfunction in the part of John's brain that was responsible for maintaining eye contact. Everything else was in place, his hand was steady when he handed Sherlock his tea, but he was utterly unable to look at his former flatmate.
“Lucky guess, now turn to the side, would you boys?” she requested with an edge to her voice. Sherlock drew back with a start. Mary hadn’t known that John liked to be kissed there.
I don't know what the rest of the time we'll share, from my perspective, will hold. I'm sure if it's anything like what's past it will be hectic and wonderful.
The careful attention John was paying to his skin was making Sherlock hot all over. He gave in to the pleasant feeling and dropped lower into John’s lap, drawing out a sharp breath from each of them at the sensitive contact. John kissed at his neck more fervently and with a hint of teeth. Sherlock shifted closer, sorely tempted to rutt up against John in earnest before he remembered Mary. She hadn’t told them to go that far yet. He went still, expecting her to chastise him, but instead he was met with praise.
"For Mrs. Hudson's biscuits, always," Sharlock replied. He plucked one from under the checked blanket that had kept out most of the rain. He held it in his hands and inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of a sunny London, so long ago, yet fresh from the oven.
"Let me show you something," Jawn said, pulling a cleanly creased piece of paper from his pocket. He unfolded it carefully, then held it out for John to take.
Sherlock clenched his hands into fists and let his nails bite into his palm. He worried that without distraction he'd do something horrendously transparent, like rocking into John's methodical, achingly through fingers. Oh, how he wanted to.
John closed the laptop, a motion Sherlock suspected was just to have something to do. There was an odd silence around them. It wasn’t a distancing, uncomfortable sort, like the beginning of their first venture, nor was it the companionable silence that they had often shared in 221B, way back then. It was something new, and Sherlock ached to know what it was.
"That's...!" John snatched back the picture. He saw the resemblance now. She might have even worn that same skirt recently.
Sherlock had a moment to look at John with wonder. There was more? Then John smirked and crooked his fingers up, making Sherlock’s senses absolutely sing.
"Thanks for doing this, Sherlock," John said, all honesty, smiles, and post-coital glow. "I know Mary really enjoyed it."
Sherlock tried to pay attention to the introduction on their next art unit. Drawing landscapes in perspective. Urgh.
Sherlock placed his hands on John’s shoulders and took a moment to read his expression before he made his next move. To his delight, John’s pupils were blown wide. His mouth was slightly open; he met Sherlock’s stare and licked his lips in what was clearly anticipation.
"Ah, Mary..." John's voice murmured somewhere out of sight above him. From the give of her hips Sherlock could tell he had sheathed himself in her as well.
John did so, stepping cautiously. "Bloody hell, it is me," he said after a minute, taking in the greys mixed with his blond, the continued awful taste in jumpers and the lines on his face that he saw on himself every morning.
"Perfect. Here's what I want you to do. You are going to have at him with your mouth, and your mouth only. Your hands will remain firmly behind your back. John, you're not allowed to touch either. Not at first, at least. Understood?" Both answered in the affirmative.
At that moment, John delivered a particularity solid thrust. Sherlock had to use every trick he'd ever taught himself to not give in to the tension building at the base of his spine. He was so close to the end.
John seemed to reach some decision. He stepped into Sherlock’s space, made the air leave the room with one look into his eyes. “Stay,” he whispered. “Mary gave us her blessing. Let me be greedy for just one more night.”
"Hello," Jawn said brightly. "Should I invite myself in? Or you could. It's all the same to me." He smiled.
"Let me at least walk you out," he said. With one last peck on the cheek for his wife, he climbed out of bed and pulled on his trousers, skipping the pants and only remembering to take off his condom when he was doing up his fly.
The second try had the home team bleachers roaring. From what Sherlock had pieced together from George, John had divided his best players evenly between the first and second string, instead of frontloading like the opposing team. As a result, the home team was making quite the comeback.
"There was so much I missed, being dead," Sharlock commented. Jawn shushed him and wrapped his other arm around him as well.
The girl seemed to mull that over for a moment before giving her very polite verdict of “bullshit.” Sherlock turned to her, surprised. She calmly plucked the sharpener from his hands.
John's face flushed, but he didn't move away when Mary tugged Sherlock over to share John's personal space. Sherlock noticed when John's eyes flicked to his face for the barest of seconds, though he said nothing. Sherlock's fingers lifted the hem of his jumper from where it sat on his hips and lifted it over John's head. There was an undershirt instead of a button down underneath. This was John prepared for sex, he supposed.
It was a strange request, but having free reign to taste John's body was enough of an incentive not to question it. Sherlock thought carefully about John mannerisms, what side he favored, which points of contact he shied away from when talking with strangers. At last he had it narrowed down enough to give it a go.
“I brought something as well.” Sherlock procured an item from the folds of his coat, which was draped over the armrest of the sofa.
A whistle blew signaling the end of practice. The players meandered down field and picked up their gear. Sherlock’s eye caught on John lifting his warm ups from the pile and stood abruptly. The word “Watson” in block letters burned in his mind’s eye for the majority of his walk home.
John from the future, called Jawn to avoid confusion, was taking a walk through time to straighten some things out.
John Watson didn’t care about him any more than the last lonely, vulnerable heart he had broken. Even if he did, or thought he did, there was no guarantee Sherlock would hold his interest the next week, or, who was he kidding, the next day. Stupid, stupid, stupid! He wished he could just delete this whole tangled jumble of memories and lingering feelings from his brain.
Either confidence or boredom had moved John to try a more complicated pose. He shifted his weight to the side and tucked one leg under the other. Most of his weight rested on his right hand, placed on the table by his hip. His other hand moved to his neck, putting his elbow up and accenting the muscle in his sides and lower arm.
Mary seemed to shift gears, her next words were coated with a soothing quality but no less commanding. If anything, they became more so. “Sherlock, tell me about your most recent experiment as John opens you up.”
Mary grinned and opened the package. She rolled the contents on to Sherlock's length and pushed him onto his back so she could wet his cock with her mouth again. She took the whole of it this time, or close to it; Sherlock was too far gone to know for sure.
“Hm,” John mumbled in agreement. “That. I. ...okay.” He stepped closer, bringing a humming sort of energy into Sherlock’s space. John stared at his lips, possibly remembering what he had just done to them. Sherlock leaned down and let their noses touch. In the time it took for the breath of one inhale and exhale to ghost over his face, John had tilted his head and was pressing their lips together.
The bell chimed and the boy left along with most of the other students. John stayed behind to get a signature from the teacher, who was known to forget about such things if not reminded. Sherlock pretended to pack up some things that he had taken out specifically to stall in putting back. He timed it so he was just ahead of John walking out the door.
"Could I... touch him more than this?" he asked Mary. Sherlock felt a jolt through his system and hoped with all his might that Mary would allow it. He gazed at the computer screen with pleading eyes through his haze of lust and stimulation.
“Push into him slowly. Steady and smooth, that’s it,” Mary encouraged her husband. Sherlock initially clenched around the head of the new intrusion, but a deep exhale and he was relaxing into it, letting John fill him again. A low moan came from his lips and didn’t stop until he was fully seated on the silicone object.
“Mary and I agreed that we should wait on that one,” John gestured to the ring. Sherlock noted that it was still in its packaging. He was somewhat relieved that they wouldn’t be doing anything too different from last time.
The best of the rugby drawings had been cut out, mounted on card stock, and turned in for credit. He’d have to wait until the end of the unit to dispose of those. Sherlock flipped to the beginning of the unit, to the sketches from that first day of modeling. The day Sherlock was doomed to meet John and fall for his perfect, sculpted, artists’ catnip of a body.
This invitation was delivered in person. Apparently John was over his initial misgivings on the matter. They hadn’t spoken face to face since the bedroom event three weeks ago, but texts and emails had gradually taken on their past habits of communication: snarky jokes, half-hearted insults, exasperated social commentary and the like. The nervous mannerisms displayed by either party had decreased by sixty percent, and Sherlock extrapolated that a recurrence would only aid that process, or at least not inhibit it.
