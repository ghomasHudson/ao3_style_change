"No, no, but he's a graduate chemist. Smart as a whip. He'll understand practically everything when he listens to doctors talking. Whatever you do, don't dumb things down for him. He'll ask if he needs something to be clarified. Don't ever underestimate what he knows."
John feels a cold ring under his seat. It's a fair question; he knows the panel will be eager to latch on to any figures of speech that might belie prejudice, arrogance, or lack of insight about why they're here.
"Have you got a spare pillowcase? Need to slip this into something," you tell her, lifting the offensive cough pillow so she can see.
"Or not. He's good at faking it, and all he's done lately is stay in bed awake," John reminds Mycroft.
'. Sherlock knows his brother well enough not to have inquired how long that might possibly take. Mycroft couldn't even summon his signature snide superiority to cover his anger, so things were serious.
He goes to his desk, opens his laptop and begins a furious database search regarding the scope of the patient's potential outcome.
John is blatantly amused. "So you just… appeared one day at the Drever place without any supplies? Fell down from a plane? Got sneezed out by a passing whale?"
Once back in the bedroom, he grabs John's wrist and drags him back up into a sitting position. "Open your mouth."
Sherlock had once spent eight days learning to describe and recognise the different varieties — for a case, of course. The murder victim had been a whisky expert, and he had been able to prove that he'd been poisoned with a substance introduced into one of his opened bottles, and the killer had then emptied the contents, cleaned the bottle and poured precisely as much replacement whisky into it as there had been prior to ingestion to cast off suspicion about the MO. The trouble was that whatever was in that bottle after the murder was something an expert of Joff Beadle's calibre would not have consumed voluntarily, let alone stored among his most prized possessions on the top shelf.
"Unsubscribe," he says, the word wrenching itself out of his lungs as though there is a frantic animal in his chest tearing out flesh. It slips out of his mouth with a shuddering sob.
"Why?" You know you're trying to evade, because you have no idea why he'd have this idea now, and if there is anything good that might come out of this conversation.
"This should last just long enough for you to get all hot and bothered thinking what I'll do to you after," John leans closer to whisper in his ear.
Mycroft's allergy to dogs compels him to take an antihistamine daily when visiting and it keeps the symptoms very mild, but he has still always been wary around the dog. Still, Mycroft could not have failed to see how the rest of the family had taken to Natch, how important he'd been to Sherlock during a very difficult time during medical school. Only a very cold person would not find the old, curly-haired black canine quite endearing, and John had witnessed a few occasions of his brother-in-law giving Natch a pat or a scratch. During their Sussex visit Natch has always been a kind, comforting presence to Sherlock, and though he hadn't lived together with the dog for a very long time, it was obvious he loves the creature and that the feeling is mutual. When things with Violet had been at their most tense at family gatherings, John had often noticed Sherlock seeking consolation from Natch's unjudgemental company.
Leigh gives him a slightly suspicious look, but doesn't press the point further, because the curtain surrounding the bed shifts and Marsh appears.
"You know him and understand him very well now, John. Trust your ability to read him — trust your instincts. The clues can be subtle."
It's John who finally manages to flag down a black cab. "Yeah, sorry. We don't need to worry about that today." He feels a bit guilty, now, for raising the issue right after Sherlock had spent hours in a jail cell without knowing whether he'd have to sleep there, too. "Want to go out for a bite to eat, get your mind off things?" he suggests.
Lestrade has tried to call Sherlock twice since John had told the brass at King's that he wasn't returning to work until the process was over. He knows John has talked to Lestrade several times, and that he's on Sherlock's side very firmly.
John isn't really understanding him because he doesn't want to hear these things, wouldn't want to know how disgustingly self-centred the sense of being paralysed under the pressure makes Sherlock when he can't meet the expectations of others. He thinks Sherlock is having some sort of a
"And that worries me. You should care, but instead of arguing your case, you remind me more of a deflated balloon than of the Sherlock I know. If you were at least reacting in some way… but you're not. Want to throw something? Even just a little bit?" John suggests.
" Shouldn't that conversation be enough for at least a few years? John doesn't need constant reminders of such things, does he?
Sherlock exits the OR without a word. Once John has taped the arterial line in place, he gives the patient a smile. "We're ready to start, Mrs Mills."
I wish I could offer John a sob story of abuse and innocence. I wish I could give him a reality in which I am blameless for this final assault on our happiness. In saving him, I condemned myself. Was there a moment when I felt relief that I’d found an excuse to use? Had I decided that if the plan didn't work, I'd just burn through, continue using until I expired? Yes.
lots of emotions going on, but the individual is not connected to them or able to name or express them, which complicates matters further and may trick those around them into underestimating their distress. In its extreme form, such detachment can turn into dissociation. Feelings of depersonalisation and derealisation are very common in acute trauma even in neurotypical patients, and Sherlock has a tendency to dissociate under heavy stress, so I think we are likely to witness something similar."
"You'd be disappointed to see Sherrinford — it's hardly Chequers. Just a house," he assures John, painfully aware that there is still a gaping, smarting difference between the man's house and his childhood home in Sussex. Two years ago, Mycroft had hired some burnout City boy to turn it into a posh bed-and-breakfast. He'd promised Sherlock a permanent
"I keep trying to inventory everything. Test all the systems, but I can't be sure," he says, delicate fingers trailing down his cheeks from where his fingertips had momentarily perched on his temples. "I can't know it's all there. Not until we get back to the Work. But if it's not… I don't… I don't really want to see the evidence. I can't look, but I can't
"That is very well analysed," she commends. "You should trust that thought, trust John to keep you safe in that environment."
. You even opened the door for him, hand on the small of his back'n'all. A girl notices these things, seeing as you never did any of it for me after I chucked off my knickers."
"It could have bled even if I had been very careful, yes. But I was not quite as careful as I should have been, and that is why I believe the result could have been better."
On Malta, John had so much time on his hands that missing Sherlock became a morbid pastime. Thankfully, an old diving instructor friend working in the Philippines had managed to coax him to be the liveaboard director of two luxury liveaboard trips around the region. The diving had been amazing on pristine reefs, and John had put on a few extra pounds from the fantastic food, and the groups he'd been guiding and instructing had been great, but when he had retreated to his cabin in the evenings, he'd felt like he was in the wrong place. Things with Sherlock were so new, so… delicate, and John worried tremendously about the man's safety and how he was coping alone. He would have preferred to follow Sherlock to England, to make sure he'd be alright under the stress of the aftermath of the now very public affair he'd had with Moriarty. The liveaboard yacht had WiFi, but not enough bandwith for video or even audio calls, so they had mostly exchanged emails and iMessages. Sherlock kept assuring him he was doing alright, and John didn't want to push him to be more open than he felt comfortable at the time.
He kneels down on the ground beside the gravestone. It takes him longer than it should to recall whether there had been talk of cremation versus burial. No. Harry had said something… There had been a lot people had said in those days, and he'd heard none of it.
. It's tedious. There is a definite sense of punishment in John's statements he detests, and he wants to protest that there are many things he thinks about besides and instead of sex such as what it would like to keep bees on such a barren island, how far Mycroft is in sorting out the mess he's in and what John's arm would feel like draped over his waist as he woke up in the morning. He's never been a part of any group because people don't generally want his company, so any rules he may have adhered to in terms of romantic conduct would have been by accident. Sherlock doesn't understand a lot about people, but he knows this: after the desperate, guttural sound John had made as he spent himself in his own hand, shoved between them where he'd pushed Sherlock face-first against a wall, John hadn't wanted him to stay. And that is much more important and much more hurtful than his general ideas about gay people, because it's personal. The shame of rejection he had felt as he made his way to the Drever house had little to do with his gender in that John could have just as easily rejected a woman. John had made him feel like a non-person, just a body to be used, and somehow, trying to explain why is making things better
Sherlock sticks his hands in his dressing gown pockets. "I had hoped you would have an idea. Or a theory. I don't know how I am supposed to be right now, how to perform to fulfil expectations you and everyone else has about how I should be reacting for it to be normal and healthy."
"Every islander has their secret spots. This was my dad's. Never came home without a good catch. There are trenches here down to fifty metres. Cods need the deep; they die very quickly after being pulled up," John explains.
be tired because I doubt you slept on the plane, you're jet-lagged off your tits and you've had a rerouted flight plus a very a long day."
Sherlock can't hide his confusion. "You have prior experience of how slow recovery can be. It took months for your shoulder."
"Perhaps he'd permit me to say that he feels certain expectations very acutely and intensely when you are ill or injured. And certain things in his past, in his family dynamic, make it extraordinarily difficult for him to acknowledge his own needs."
. Though this one is ornamental, it still carries the key design features which had made it a formidable weapon.
, Sherlock thinks. How had he not realised he's never been in bed with the man like this? He knows John is a great many things, but he never quite expected such an exquisite and distinct, yet subtle transformation.
"Tell her I'll call her tomorrow, if I must," Violet hears Sherlock instruct his husband, "unless it's some village charity nonsense."
The Vicodin was all for Sherlock, the lines for the both of them. He had no idea how much Victor was using daily at that point. Though Sherlock can't be certain, he'd always been convinced that Victor had no master plan of seducing him that night. It simply happened, or perhaps he just wants to believe so. He doesn't know why Victor had been the one chosen as his protective detail inside the house. He hadn't asked. Judging by Mycroft's reaction to their affair and Victor's death, Big Brother had nothing to do with it and hadn't shoved Victor into his arms. He seemed to have more regrets about the whole thing than Sherlock does.
"We've studied as well as worked together, yes. I was a late-age admission to medical school; we started in the same year."
Sherlock ignores him. It takes only a few minutes to make an order in the online system. Delivery time is estimated to be fifteen minutes.
John clears his throat, reflexively clasps his left wrist with his right behind his back — Sherlock can tell from the shifts of his shoulders.
She looks utterly delighted; you can practically see her thoughts reverting instantly to a massive index of memorised recipes so that he could spoil the strange person she has adopted so determinedly. You have a strong hunch that from her, Sherlock just might allow the kind of consolation he would be embarrassed to receive from you. The thought makes you uneasy, because you
There's a rap on the glass of the emergency exit door. It's Marie — the only one who knows that this landing of the external staircase built in case of fire is a bolthole of his.
"I know that. I accept that, now, after you have demonstrated other things could be possible. Calling this enough, John, is desecration. Calling it perfect would be an understatement. I was anxious because I worried my memories of being with you on Malta had been gilded by time. I feared it wouldn't be the same."
People lie to themselves all the time to feel better about their lives, but Sherlock has always had little skill in doing that.
to fix the fact that Sherlock doesn't look any better than he did when he was wheeled in, and it's been an hour. You nearly decide to commandeer the portable ultrasound used for cannulation and nerve blocks that just sits in the bay's corner, mocking you with the answers it could provide. As much as you itch to take things into your own hands, you can't risk getting thrown out for bypassing standard operating procedure by taking liberties. You're not a cardiologist. You're not anything that could fix this. You're Sherlock's friend and partner and companion and flatmate and his… his… but that's been side-swiped by the need to be his doctor.
You purse your lips. Sherlock has never really pushed her away, never declined her support for anything. You have a hunch she's the one he talks to about things, not you or his parents. Maybe this'll do Sherlock some good, and Mrs Hudson has certainly proven that she was weather even his foulest moods with grace.
The volume and pitch of Sherlock's voice has risen slightly. He's getting vexed because he requires more information and no one is providing that. "I'd like to see the literature pro and con acute phase tonsillectomy in these circumstances."
John hums in confirmation and gets back to work. When Sherlock comes with a shout, John’s uniform manages to remain stainless thanks to a pillow grabbed at a strategic moment and shoved at his husband's cock. John then drops onto his back on the bed next to him. Too blissed out to change position, Sherlock gives him what he hopes is a dedicated and spirited handjob, and the same pillow gets to ensure that the uniform survives this second assault mostly pristine. There's no telling how it will look after the
"I'm not done talking but come on. Let's get back to bed," John prompts, perching a palm on Sherlock's shoulder briefly before lying down.
"They're back," Mycroft comments needlessly; all three gathered in the sitting room have sat up stiffly the second they heard a car approach.
"There are theories that a brain like his may gain particular effects from substances activating nicotine receptors. They may provide additional focus, enhance the ability to calm oneself."
"I've seen you in many hellishly tough spots, and you always know what to do. Always, without hesitation. You don't generally need or want second opinions, haven't for years. It's not just me who's joked that you may well be the better tumour surgeon out of you and Greg — the pupil excels the master."
You realise, once again, how desperately he must need to hold on to the marginal sense of control he still retains over his body. He needs it to be his decision. "The surgeon will come see you once he's seen the scans and explain everything."
? It's because they look at these demands of superhuman resilience and endless empathy nobody teaches us in medical college, they look at the demands to forget their own health and sanity and give their all to the system even when they don't have anything to give, and they ask themselves what's wrong with them that they can't do it?"
"Until I met him, I imagined that what I feel when I operate will be the best thing I will ever experience. People are unpredictable, relationships are messy, sex is----"
"You never go to Waitrose on a weekday; frugality inherited from your parents will allow you to splurge on food on weekends and holidays, but it's the less expensive brands for everyday use. You justify using Ocado as opposed to downmarket services with the idea that ordering in prevents expensive impulse purchases. You went to Waitrose because it's in the same direction as Harley Street, creating a convenient excuse for the time you were absent and the direction you headed even though no one should be assumed to be able to deduce it, indicating paranoia towards me finding out. You didn't display the mounting agitation you always had on days when you saw Doctor Hooper, and you were visibly angry when you suddenly left the house. Not that many places where you could have gone, save for a pub, and you're not showing clinical signs of inebriation. Besides, you put on your work clothes today as opposed to something casual; going to a pub in the middle of the day would be a step back in returning to normal routines. Staying in the flat in a pyjama has begun to bother you based on some arbitrary principle, and your anger wasn't caused by anything I did or said today because we've barely interacted. No, it was something you have been thinking for some time, most likely, and if you didn't explode at me about it, you must have done something else to defuse it. Since you're not seeing Hooper anymore, it had to be Pichler."
John hesitates on the street by the front door to 221 Baker Street. Sherlock's features are illuminated by the streetlamp, and John can see his hesitant expression, one that seems to be steeling up as the seconds pass. Preparing for disappointment.
Were he a superstitious person, he might now study the shadows in the corners of the room, might try to spot how they must be shifting to make room for the overwhelming lightness and promise he feels. It's a tide, but this one does not submerge him. Instead, it washes away the soot of pain and regret, makes everything brighter. Victor has been here, a spectre he kept summoning. Now, Victor will be evicted, and someone living will take his place. He and John will build a new foundation for what has happened and should and
They glance at each other. "We'll revisit this topic on a better day," the surgeon finally says. It sounds a bit like a warning. "I hear physical therapy isn't going well?" he prompts.
The nurse brings something up on the computer she is working at. "It would've been time for paracetamol in half an hour, anyway."
"Spoilsport," John quips, and rolls his head from shoulder to shoulder while answering. "Watson, anaesthesia."
John purses his lips. Will Holmes adhere to his care instructions, or is he now too sceptical about John's skills to comply? John has just used his considerable expertise and expensive equipment to assess the injury based on analysing MRI images and devised a personalised treatment plan. It's hardly something a layperson could have done even if they're as clever as Holmes seems to be. "If you'd like to get another opinion, I could contact one of my––"
"So, you are recovering well?" Pichler asks courteously, perhaps to bring John back into the conversation.
The neurosurgeon's consultation phone comes to life, too. "It's the A&E triage nurse," Sherlock says tiredly after studying the caller ID on the screen. "Must I?" he whines while collecting himself off the sofa. He drops the grape container on the nearest table and presses the answer call button. "Holmes."
Truth be told, he feels like a rip tide has seized him. His calendar is rather full this week, and even with Edgar's help he feels absent-minded and wholly unmotivated even by the things he'd normally enjoy. He'd even found himself hoping that this morning's delicate posterior fossa operation was already done when he was barely halfway through resecting the tumour. The small talk in the OR is always subdued when he's operating; the staff know that inane chatter distracts him, but he had found even the pertinent conversation now grates on his nerves. His anxiety has built up to levels where it makes him feel insecure and unsure not just at home but also at work — wrong-footed about even the simplest professional decisions he has to make. It gnaws at the pit of his stomach, directionless and vast like the ocean, impossible to grip by the proverbial lapels and banish with the determination that usually allows himself to push through difficulties.
"I can't want something I can't keep… what I shouldn't keep. You don't belong here, you never did; I'm lonely and you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, and I couldn't help myself. Can't help myself," John says breathlessly in the dark of his bedroom. Though it's the afternoon, now, the light is low in the room with the curtains drawn.
,” Sherlock reads out loud from the screen when the opening credits come on. He’s perched his computer on his knees on the sofa, idly throwing occasional glances at the TV.
"I don't have a patient booked for the next two hours. Please," she prompts, pointing at an armchair.
The bitterness in his tone, I do not expect; it echoes the tone of my own thoughts. "Why would you want me, hm?" John asks. "What have I got to offer? Single dad with anger issues who's let himself go and who gets off chasing after some madman solving crimes all over London."
"I've seen her once this year. As you said, I've been busy. The new unit is up and running, and there's nothing new going on between us or at King's. There's no reason there should be a problem."
Sherlock rises to his feet and offers John a hand to help him climb out of the boat. John doesn't take it; instead, he nimbly leaps up onto the pier after placing the fishing gear next to the pole onto which he'd tied the boat. Another line, clipped to a ring just behind the captain's seat, runs to a pole at the other end of the pier that hugs the small boathouse. Sherlock would be interested in exploring its contents but wonders if it would be rude to just duck in and start investigating. Would he find bits of John's family history? Most likely there would be little there that could shed light on his recently ended marriage, though.
"Diabetes, heart disease, liver damage, kidney damage, osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia," Mycroft rattles off from memory.
"I had a hysterectomy. The reason was a benign myoma; nothing for my boys to worry about, no need for advice from Sherlock or his husband. They assured me it was very much a routine procedure, and I stayed only three nights at the Princess Royal — the Haywards Heath one, it's quite close to us."
"If it had to happen, I am glad that I was here. I can't imagine what I would feel like if I'd been told over the phone. He didn't suffer for long," Sherlock tells him firmly once again, and it sounds like he's confirming the fact for himself rather than to John. "His first family didn't want to keep him; the owner acquired him on a whim when he was having a mania episode, and Natch ended up with his mother, who was planning on taking him to a shelter."
. It seems to matter to her what he thinks and what he feels, even if she relegates much of the blame to the professionals whose advice she had been following.
Through the glass windows of the imaging room, John catches a glimpse of his husband. Sherlock's back is ramrod straight, shoulders snapped back. He looks antsy.
"I think Violet might have been fonder of Natch than even George was," John points out. "It was obvious she loved that dog, fussed over him all the time."
She shakes droplets of rain off her umbrella before sticking it in an umbrella stand left behind by some prior tenants to 221a. When Martha Hudson had sold them their flat, it hadn't just been the space upstairs — they own all of 221 Baker Street but haven't come up with any use for the two other flats yet. They simply don't need much more space for their home life than 221b. They could let those two flats out, of course, but John hasn't suggested it. It's for the best that they have no neighbours very close by — it would be world war three if they turned out to be people who raised Sherlock's heckles in some way.
He pushes his chair away from the keyboard and towards the left side of the table where it is closer to mine. He leans forward, his eyes serious.
Mycroft told him there would be no funeral. Sherlock assumed it was because there was no one to mourn for the man. It's good business for MI6 to recruit people with no families and very few living relatives. He could have argued that, without a body, very little is undisputed, but there a chance that something gruesome delivered to the MI6 had proven conclusively the disposal of their agent.
Sherlock be confused and agitated and scared to wake up in a place he couldn't recognise, in pain, hooked up to all this equipment and strangers holding him still? Why had you gone home? It's been less than a
John is taken aback. He doesn't like talking about Sherlock behind his back, especially not with a psychiatrist, but Sherlock trusts her, so John should, too. She'll know what to do with this information, knows to wield it responsibly.
Sherlock knows enough Scottish English to recognise the second word — Angus is acknowledging his departure. "This is the worst safehouse in intelligence history," Sherlock tells him with a scoff. "If I told my brother the truth about how this place has gone to the dogs, you'd get sacked."
You take the duvet to him, wordlessly drape it around his shoulders. He leans back against the sofa, closes his eyes.
"Yeah," John confirms. "I can't say for sure, but I think it's really unlikely he could tell two people apart at that distance even if they were standing next to each other."
"Mum was diagnosed with ovarian cancer just after I'd started uni. Dad died a few years later from advanced liver failure, which was a long time coming."
"A moment, please," John barks at the door. In protest, he doesn't spring to his feet but takes his time to down the last of his coffee and to wait for his computer to reboot; the dratted calendar app has crashed again. The private sector may provide many cushy perks to specialists, but well-functioning, reliable IT is not one of them. Perhaps it's a pipe dream for the healthcare sector.
The couple's younger son is not participating in the excitement. Instead, Sherlock is lounging in a deck chair under a sprawling lilac bush, transfixed by something he's reading on his tablet. He is sporting a brand-new pair of Balenciaga prescription sunglasses that Edgar has helped him pick out. Though John appreciates good men's wear, he has no desire to trail behind Sherlock for hours while he hunts for wardrobe pieces that would fulfil his strict criteria of acceptability. In contrast, John has rarely seen the PA as excited as he's been when he gets to help Sherlock do such shopping. Through personal interest in fashion and working as a personal assistant to Balenciaga's head designer, Edgar has amassed enough knowledge of such things as fabrics properties and cuts that Sherlock listens to his opinions, and Sherlock never listens to
blood products = these days whole blood is a rare means of administering these to a patient — we mostly use blood components (fresh-frozen plasma, red blood cells, fibrinogen, platelets and specialised concentrates of different clotting factors) according to individuals needs.
He looks almost appalled by the suggestion that what he'd been doing in the shower was related to sex.
He’s been trying to improve the surgical success of removing as much as glioblastoma multiforme -type tumours as possible. Possibly the most malignant type of brain cancer with a dire prognosis, it’s difficult for a surgeon to find their margins since their thin tendrils reach deep into healthy tissue. MRI navigation combined with novel preoperative imaging techniques is showing some promise in the right hands. Sherlock’s hands, to be precise. It's a side project he amuses himself with when not busy with shunt development at GOSH.
"They used what's known as INVOS to monitor brain circulation. I don't know how precise it is, but the internist told me they saw no dips in the readings."
FAST = “focused assessment with sonography in trauma”; an ultrasound examination done on a major trauma patient to diagnose or rule out problems that must be addressed without delay such as pneumothorax and blood in the abdominal cavity
He needs you. You can do this. He always pushes himself one more bit beyond normal endurance, that one step beyond normal in every way. You have no idea how he'd react if your roles were reversed. You don't care. People think he doesn't feel things, that he has no empathy. Fuck them. They don't know Sherlock at all.
John is proud of himself for having had the good sense to put Sherlock's phone on silent and leave it in the kitchen last night; the screen is constantly lighting up with messages — 83 so far — and attempted calls — 34 and counting.
"What the media says passes, Sherlock," Joanna says patiently. "The public's trust in doctors and the NHS is still very high even though these occasional scandals happen."
"GMC's requested the paperwork of four cases," Greg replies. "Zezelj, Fairholme, that one where he did the reoperation when the first surgery didn't resolve a cauda syndrome, and an older case where the patient filed several complaints with the Trust. That was just after he arrived at King's. He handled the surgery perfectly but managed to piss off the patient
"No. She was very discreet about what you'd allow her to tell me," John says, wanting to defend her. Sherlock has never come home from a session angry at Doctor Pichler like this.
me! First, you invited me here, then we went to the Centre, then the meeting, then this before you spring a job offer on me which would tie us together semi-permanently, give me a reason to spend quite a lot of time here. I feel like I was auditioning for something without knowing."
gay, and I can tell you that being diminished into a married man's sexual identity crisis chew toy gets
“Oh.” This seems to satisfy John, finally. He’s looking a bit winded, so Sherlock slows down, rambling on about things that occur to him as they close the distance towards home. He needs to distract John from further meditations on Wiggins.
John can't help but chuckle a bit, remembering the first time he'd brought a tube of Pringles home. Sherlock had nibbled at one, then put it under his microscope and declared that it didn't fulfil his definition of a crisp. 'It's a potato-based product distantly resembling a crisp in form but not flavour. A crisp is a slice of potato, and there is no need whatsoever to make it any more complicated than that. They must've used low-quality potatoes since they needed to deconstruct the whole thing into mush. It's hideous. Get it out of there.' John had complied by eating all of them.
He brings out his laptop and clicks through his work emails while having coffee, ending up consuming his own portion and the half-full one Sherlock had neglected. There's an email sent by Lestrade not ten minutes earlier with an update on the investigation; he doesn't know much but assures John that the man responsible remains in police custody. Bail seems unlikely and a state-of-mind exam as ordered by the court likely — at least according to the estimates of the Trust's legal counsel. The Coroner's Inquest will happen first, of course, to establish that Stephanie's death in the OR was due to homicide, after which there will be an arraignment. Nobody knows what the charges will be; the prosecutor is likely to examine the issue of premeditation with care before deciding on manslaughter versus murder. What happened to the other gunshot victim, nurse Joe Pilkington from the ward, will be treated as either grievous bodily harm or, more likely, attempted manslaughter. The victim is recovering well, according to Lestrade, and it's the best bit of good news John's had since yesterday.
The sun is setting when he finally gets home. He and Marie had managed to squeeze all the appointments through in three hours, but that had meant leaving the paperwork until after the last patient was escorted out. The offerings had been better than Sherlock had anticipated, and he had ended up instructing Marie to book four of the patients on his own OR list instead of dividing them up evenly between all the neurosurgeons in the unit. Two of them had spinal tumours with mildly intriguing anatomy, and he hadn't operated on spinal cord growths for some time. The remaining two had posterior fossa tumours, an anatomic area in which his skills are so far beyond Anderson's that you couldn't even see the sorry bugger in the proverbial horizon from the rear-view mirror.
, John mouths, and though it's ridiculous that such a statement of sentiment could lend him the courage he's sorely lacking right now, it does.
Andrew returns mere minutes later. Sherlock coughs, gags a little as Andrew uses the suction to make sure he doesn't wake up with a mouth full of saliva. Once the respiratory therapist arrives, with the junior doctor you saw earlier in tow, the tapes holding the tube in place are pried off.
"I don't!" he protests, "I'd prefer to delete all of it but I can't, because it won't make sense, and I can't let go of that." He admits this with a rather mournful tone — as if feeling guilty for troubling you with such a thing.
"You're supposed to do it yourself or call the emergency anaesthesia number if you need an urgent procedure."
"Not really. I got to review all the imaging results and full patient records this afternoon before they finally let me leave for the hotel, the local surgeons have done all the consenting and prep, and I will meet the patient tomorrow morning before the surgery."
, John thinks, aware that he needs to be the one to put the foot down if Sherlock starts doing too much, too soon.
Wouldn’t that be all the more reason to program it in since Harry wouldn’t have learned the number by heart? Sherlock wouldn’t really have to program any names in since his eidetic memory allows him to remember a virtually unlimited amount of telephone numbers, but the brain does process familiar letter combinations faster than numbers, so he’d succumbed to the lure of convenience.
"I’m a surgical Consultant with the Trust at Denmark Hill, and John is the Director of Operative Services. It is imperative for the functioning of this Trust to ensure his prompt recovery, so I am staying."
someone died and who killed them can be complicated, but not the fact itself that someone has passed away.
"Seatbelt," John reminds him, and he complies. He doesn't usually need to be reminded. "We could go have lunch somewhere?" John plucks up the courage to suggest. "Isolabella should have some parking in the vicinity." They've dined at the Italian restaurant close to GOSH many times when John has picked Sherlock up after a research day.
"Wanting to spare someone we life from hardship is not a deplorable thought, John. Sherlock's mother sought to protect him just and what you just voiced comes from that same need. But mollycoddling him, taking away what he loves the most because it's difficult and often stretches his reserves to the extreme is not the way. He needs to be the one to define his limits."
"In order for us to accept the love others want to give us, we have to accept ourselves and that we deserve that love. I could tell you how proud and overjoyed I am about the conversations you've had with your mother and John, but it's more important whether you feel that pride without my influence. Have these conversations changed the way you see your skills and role in your marriage?"
Sherlock can almost convince himself that he's still focussed on the case as the man disappears back into the dark. The proximity of his suitor has woken a longing he's tried to push away, to convince himself the price for it is too high to pay.
"Sherlock," Doctor Pichler starts, "you may not feel the need for it right now, but it's recommended that medical professionals who face a violent incident at work take some time off to recover."
"Do you think John will feel that protectiveness and worry only if you tell him more about what's going on with you?"
"This appears to be something you haven't shared with me, either?" Pichler points out. She doesn't sound angry or disappointed, for which Sherlock is relieved. "What doesn't John know?" she asks.
Next, Sherlock paces the floor as John endures an obviously excruciating and uncomfortable basic ENT examination complete with a fiberoscopic examination of his larynx.
He should flee, grab his violin, calm himself down. This doesn't concern John; obviously, it's all Sherlock's fault. It's always his fault. He doesn't understand himself, can't name the storms of emotions tearing through his Mind Palace, even though he's spent his life trying to bolt the windows and doors from such things. He's never had the words for them, can't even begin to organise them without the help of some therapist. John has just told him how he needs Sherlock to be the sensible one right now, to maintain his normal state, which is nothing deserving praise, but at least it's what they're both used to. What passes for normalcy in Sherlock's brain is not calm or stable or
How do you prove to the cleverest man in England that he's still got it, then? The answer comes to you one night when listening to Sherlock shouting at the telly: you do it by recruiting his only rival for that title.
"Not so much anymore. His trust in my abilities to manage seems to have increased. He even apologised for being so sceptical about the GOSH project."
Is Sherlock imagining things, or is that smile somehow lighter than before? Less tight, less reserved, less wary of what some invisible force watching his every move might think if he enjoys himself even for a moment.
"Coming home from work to John is the worst. I never know––" he draws a careful breath, "I didn't know what mood he'd be in. In the nightmares… I can do nothing right. In the nightmares he's there constantly, hounding me, telling me how I'm always messing things up."
Sherlock can't help the smile creeping up. "I'm sure I would have said the same, watching you in your old element, so to speak."
John replies by saying he'd be having champagne if they had any in the house. Sherlock's hand hovers on the virtual keyboard, and suddenly he can't come up with anything to say. The article seems to have suddenly derailed the false calm he had kept up all day. He also should have declined the finger of whisky George had offered after dinner. Sherlock doesn't particularly enjoy whisky, but George has often skipped him altogether in such offerings, making him inclined to say yes tonight. He doesn't have much tolerance for alcohol — or its effects on people. He gets tipsy on very little, hates that feeling of not thinking clearly and, even after just a couple of doses, when the alcohol level in his blood sinks, his mood follows suit.
Time to explain the obvious to lesser minds. It’s one of the worst parts of Sherlock’s job. “The table and chairs have been pushed back against the wall to make room for something, and the dust pattern dictates that there was a rug here.”
"Thank you for breakfast, John," Joanna says and rises from the table. "Sherlock… now that I am here, might I make a request? You are free to decline, of course, if you don't feel like it."
which features postcards to the fandom from such familiar names as khorazir, Beautifulfiction, Engazed, Atlin Merrick and many more. We also assembled
John can't really tell what the panel members are thinking, but they don't pose very many questions, so perhaps they agree on the medical aspects of the case.
"They gave you a bilateral serratus block for the pain at the end of the operation, but it stops working after about twelve hours." Emma says. "What that means in layman's terms is––"
Back in the sitting room, John has an odd sense of time having slowed down inside the flat while outside, the bustle of a London weekday continues. He's flung a bathrobe on top of his old, ratty pyjamas and doesn't want to enter the bedroom to put on something more proper since that would risk waking Sherlock up.
my surgical work," Sherlock argues. "People ask about what do I because they are curious. Apparently,
John wonders briefly if Sherlock had realised what she was doing with that request. Even in such a frazzled state, he just might be clever enough to realise he was being manipulated benignly.
— sex, but they should have eased into it slower. He should have told John he needs less before he can want more.
Sherlock strides to the bar and orders a drink for verisimilitude, catching the attention of a tattooed hunk nearby who raises their glass to him with an inquisitive smile.
Sherlock gives him a brief glance. His features have softened a bit. "The anatomy of this thing should be interesting."
"All the neurological, neuropsychological and cognitive testing that was offered on his last appointment with Doctor Stamford but which he declined upon discharge — performed with some important additions by professionals with particular expertise beyond that found in NHS hospitals."
John's hand is warm, smaller than Sherlock's, and his grip is as firm as his touch had been when he'd stitched Sherlock back together. "Good to meet you, William."
"I don't think so either," John offers. "At least not now. Pichler said that there's some stuff you've been remembering––"
"Great, good, good! My wife, she worry too much, is not let me work yet. But I work a bit from home, see!" the Serbian taps his nose, "when she not at home I call everyone. You English with your email so slow; I call people, get things done."
"These old, wooden, handmade things are bottom-heavy. Never heard one of them tipping over even in the November storms," John assures him and starts arranging his gear. He gives to Sherlock one of the short rods with heavy metal rings through which the line has been threaded. The reel is simple, uncovered unlike the one with a longer rod Sherlock had spotted fisherman casting lures into the roiling waves in Pierowall next to the surgery.
"You can't get hung up on this," Lestrade chastises, taking a seat on the corner of his desk. "The only way to avoid mistakes is to not operate at all. You're making it worse than it is by fuming at everything and everyone when what you are is pissed off at you."
Sherlock wraps the robe tightly around himself, looking defensive while John watches him from the doorway. "Go on, then. I can tell you want to address the elephant in the room."
The urgency of the pull to go to his husband is making John so restless that he can't resist rattling the door handle just to get something to do.
"She says that, while it's ultimately Sherlock's decision, these processes are inordinately stressful, and support is absolutely necessary. Both from family and professionally. There's actually lots on offer these days, mentoring and voluntary support services and all, but the problem is that––"
systole = the phase of the heart where the ventricles contract. There is also what’s known as _atrial_ systole, but let’s not get in too deep here LOL
Helena walks in at that moment, a fresh, sterile dressing still in its packaging in hand. "Um, Mister Holmes––"
"Oh yes. My grave mistake of calling for collegial help is what I needed to be punished for by taking the case off me."
"A physician should know that acute illness is the worst occasion for detoxing someone off a narcotic habit. Keeping him calm should be a priority for his heart. The side effects of indulging him we'll deal with later."
"Can't you come to bed?" John asks. "You can read if you can't sleep. Just… stop torturing that poor thing. That sounded violent enough to break a string," John says and cards a hand through his hair.
John flips through the apps to find the remote monitoring connection to Med Bay. Even in these exceptional circumstances, it had required going through a lot of red tape to be given even this limited an access to the Rangers' implant monitoring interface. When he brings up Sherlock's feed, he breathes a sigh of relief.
The nurse's report is succinct: "Doctor Watson woke up, had some yoghurt, another dose of oxycodone, and went back to sleep."
Eyes closed as he droops in the examination chair, John coughs some more, which sounds unproductive. It's more an attempt to clear his throat than trying to dislodge anything from his bronchi. He grimaces after each attempt; the pain he’s in must be exquisite. If Sherlock could do something,
John perks up. Now they're getting somewhere in this discussion. "What do you play, Sherlock?" Judging by the man's physique, John would bet on tennis. Or perhaps he's a swimmer. Or maybe track and field. Running, maybe. Dancer? Then again, the term 'playing' is not associated with those. Beach volleyball? John rather thinks Sherlock would look most fetching in those outfits or tight cycling shorts, but such thoughts must be put aside, professionalism and so on.
John’s nose crinkles in amusement. "It was one punch. He threatened me first, though, after I told him the tourist girl he was trying to chat up and making uncomfortable was not appreciating his attention."
"Their best — and, as I see it, only — potential strategy for establishing mitigating circumstances is to argue emotional distress from the death of Sylvie Fairholme."
"Edgar? Could you give us a minute?" John asks. He half expects Sherlock to argue, to say that whatever John has to say, he can say in front of the PA, but something keeps him from commenting.
"For some reason, less than this time. Well, it's anyone's guess how tempted I'd have really been after Afghanistan, but there was the halo so the logistics would have been challenging. Perhaps it's reassuring that the practical challenges were enough of a deterrent then." Anything compromising his balance even more would have created a twofold threat to his career: active substance abuse and tetraplegia after a fall that would have dislodged his vertebra fracture would have made sure he'd never pick up a scalpel again. There was also that fact that he'd been so focused on John's recovery. Disappointing John even more than he thought he was already would have been unacceptable. In comparison, this time his need to use had been borne out of that sense of failure, and perhaps that's why it was different. Maybe that's why he'd been more tempted.
"You can't breathe down a neck in an OR, John. Surgical masks, remember? I'd think a family member who said that is an idiot because they're not a neurosurgeon while
Sherlock's breathing has picked up, but not from arousal. No, he can recognise the early stages of hyperventilation because he's getting overwhelmed fast. He wants nothing more than to be with John tonight, to feel like this is where he belongs, to feel that connection again of which he's been dispossessed ever since John got sick. He wants ––
arterial line = small cannula in a distal artery; used for continuous monitoring or blood pressure and for easily drawing blood samples. If accidentally pulled out, the puncture site can bleed a lot because the pressure in even a small artery is much higher than in a vein.
As much as you try to push away reality right now, Mycroft's reaction has hammered it home what has happened. Sherlock's life is now very concretely in the hands of OR staff, his life hanging on by a blood pressure produced by machines. His blood has been made so runny that it won't coagulate in the perfusion machinery which heavily activates clotting cascades. Just a nick on his finger, and he could bleed dry right now.
"Leaving him alone seems to be precisely what Sherlock is after. It doesn't seem like he wants anything to do with me."
"They've been trying to establish a phone connection, but he's not playing ball. Not interested in talking to the police."
You lick your lips, leans your palms on the back of your chair for fortification. "Let's change roles for a moment. If you were my patient, what would you deduce?"
John rests his palm on the desk since he's still leaning over it, drums his fingertips on the surface. There's a soft smile that Sherlock tries to dislike but cannot. He wants John on his side. He wants John to understand. Everyone else is focused on damage control and not the damage itself — surely, John understands that the patient should matter more.
"I remember things, but I can't be sure where I was still meant to be awake, or what parts of them are real. Even the bits I know can't be accurate… they feel exactly the same, and that's… out of the things I
"Do you mean that the issues you're having now are easier to conceal from John because they are not somatic?"
In the car, Sherlock says nothing and simply continues breathing in a very conscientious manner, pulse still sky-high. You don't take his hand again; the gesture seems too intimate for Donovan's presence, but you can count the beats on his neck. You know you should be asking questions, making a cursory examination, but Sherlock always makes you second-guess yourself. Besides, he's walked away unscathed from such insane situations that a part of you is always sceptical that any of his symptoms are serious. It also doesn't help that a proper head cold will bring on such histrionics that you'd think he had the bubonic plague and not just a three-day snot virus.
"You care about me," John says quietly. "You do. That's not a question. I need you, and I don't have any problem admitting to that. But it seems like it's not the same for you."
Mycroft would make the worst therapist; his approach would likely just entail telling people to 'snap out of it'.
"It takes a bit of practice, but you'll get there," John promises. With a pair of surgical forceps, he pulls out the splinter and quickly presses a sterile gauze into the wound, which starts to bleed again.
"During my school years, I also learned that relying on the adults who claimed it was their duty to look after and protect me would not be a viable long-term strategy. One day, I would become of age, and they would no longer be there to help.
Delivery is fast, and soon he is soothing his nerves with five cigarettes, smoked while perched on the sitting room windowsill. Once the nicotine has overridden his anxiety, he curls up on the couch and sleeps for an hour.
Sherlock blinks at him blearily. It's as though someone's suddenly knocked the stuffing out of him; his shoulders are hunched and gone is the manic, nervous energy of just minutes ago. From zero to turbo boost and vice versa is how John knows his brain works. Maybe getting to fume and scoff has done the trick.
He starts reading, complexion pale and eyes narrowed in focus. He's being meticulous, drinking in every word. Tiny movements of muscles in his face signal his changing emotions, but he says nothing until he's reached the final page.
"I didn't know if you and he––" John starts explaining but then regrets it when Sherlock's hands drop to his side and he steps back.
"I would like to rephrase my earlier question: how do you think Sherlock would react, as an adult, to learning about what happened to the pregnancy?"
He wishes Sherlock had balled up the letter, ripped it up, done something that would indicate how pissed off he is at this latest injustice. How angry he
Sherlock has never established what his own type is, he doesn’t think. He has always assumed he'd know it when he saw it, but how could he know what it's supposed to feel like? All he knows is that he's never quite stumbled so quickly and with so little grace into attraction as he recognises he's done with John Watson. Surely that must be just a Westray version of Stockholm syndrome.
"John has booked a nice hotel and planned a program that should be nice for the both of you. He's taking you into account in planning the reunion trip, and the way you described him commenting on your and his uniform might point to him wanting to encourage you to enjoy all aspects of that weekend. He might even think he's making amends for the way you felt his anger alienated the two of you in Bastion. I might be reading too much into this by saying so, but I would consider it a possibility."
"Considering how much of a fuss she makes for when John and I come to visit, she could reconsider the amounts of things she cooks so that she wouldn't then have to invite more people over. Usually, the pickings are insufferable."
There is a challenge in Sherlock's eyes John finds easy to interpret: he is expecting Violet to launch into some tirade about how her youngest was bound to be the absolute worst at talking about difficult, emotional things with people.
Next, Sherlock calls the ward and is told that John is asleep the last they checked and that his night has been uneventful. Sherlock demands to know how old the information regarding his restful sleep is, and when he’s told John had been last checked on forty minutes earlier, he refuses to end the call until someone goes to the room to verify his husband's status.
"There was no outpatient follow-up after he was discharged after the endocarditis," you say, choosing your words carefully because it would feel cruel to place the blame on Sherlock right now. "Could he… could there have been a smaller operation if this had been caught earlier?"
I thought that with John returning to Baker Street with Rosie, Sherrinford being secure again, and Mycroft stepping down from all the surveillance, it would mean that we could begin our lives proper. A family; John and me and his daughter.
Violet doesn't really think she needs the services of any psychiatrist or therapist; she knows her mental health is much less brittle than her son's, and she has navigated a marriage, a challenging motherhood and an academic career without having to go moan at someone how stressed she was. No, she's here because — for some strange reason — her William has decided to trust this woman and to value her advice over that of his parents. It is a bitter pill to swallow that Joanna Pichler appears able to communicate with her son in ways at which Violet has repeatedly failed. This therapist knows parts of her youngest child which Sherlock actively seems to conceal from her, and Violet actively battles the notion that the doctor and Sherlock have teamed up against her, blaming her for things in Sherlock's life beyond her control or influence.
"I guess. It's as if… as if he's always waiting for the whole world to turn on him, to reject him. For a long time, he seemed to assume it was only a matter of time before I'd leave him after somehow realising what he's like. As though I don't
— stops John in the hall to say that if there's anything he can do, all John needs to do is ask. They all expect him to convey these things to Sherlock instead of contacting the man themselves.
John puts a pillow on the edge of the coffee table as a soft spot to land his feet while shoving a handful of crisps into his mouth. He had popped into a newsagent on his way home, picking up a sixpack of Tennents and a few packets of crisps in flavours Sherlock always vetoes because he thinks they make John's kisses taste foul. He loathes everything he thinks resembles artificial cheese, while John is a great friend of Wotsits when chased down with some lager. In pubs, he likes to experiment with craft beer but for a bit of rugby and a night in, it's got to be something lighter and crisper, and quantity is allowed to win over over quality. Most likely he'll have terrible morning breath tomorrow, but Sherlock won't be here for it.
"Things have not always been easy for us. More times than I can count, I have feared that my being on the Spectrum, which he initially seemed utterly unfazed by, would be the unmaking of our relationship. The divorce rate for couples where at least one partner is autistic has been repeatedly estimated to be around eighty percent. I do hope this will be yet another thing in which John proves I can beat the odds."
“Same old, same old. Look, if I keep talkin’ to posh folks like you, punters gonna think you’re a copper and I’m snitching or whateva.”
"I bought some local honey I'm bringing home. We had some beverages, sandwiches and mince pies at the venue."
"No, we were not in a hurry. I believe Doctor Holmes' assessment of Mrs Fairholme ended before office hours did. We don't have a habit of leaving early, not even when heading somewhere after work."
"It's just files, Sherlock, not field work. Just something to pass the time. Get your mind off the rest of it."
Then again, government systems are often so archaic or not digital at all that Sherlock wouldn't be surprised if the NHS and the police's network wouldn't interact at all. But wouldn't someone have alerted the GMC, leading to John's medical licence being revoked?
"But it's about me, then? It must be about me, since during those times I wasn't well, and he had to… um… pick up the slack?" John curses silently because it's not the right expression.
"What is going on with him now needs to be monitored. I would like to see him weekly for a while, perhaps even more frequently if that becomes necessary."
"He still ended up in a situation that made him angry at himself for not being able to do more. To fulfil his own expectations."
"Your therapist. Pichler. I suppose that is how they ensure repeat business — by painting devils where there are none."
He hates how he'd let those idiots in the OR floor break room get into his head. People can't usually lance through his defences like that. He knows he protects himself by pushing others away, prefers to be feared rather than pitied. He believes that who he is, could never be something people would want, so it's better to construct a public persona they can hate for understandable reasons. It's a mask he can take off when he goes home, put it on the mantle and breathe more freely. But is the end result different? He stands on the outside, the meagre successes of his herculean efforts at managing social conduct few and far between. People assume he's cold, aloof, mean, even psychopathic… not a person someone nice and good and likeable and helpful like John would want to be with.
Two floors down in another wing, you find the right theatre unit. The doors are locked, of course, but you hide your visitor pass and since the consultants all wear civilian clothes when not in scrubs, you simply jut up your chin and stride in after a cleaning lady who opens the door with her key fob. You don't ask anyone for the break room since that would just prompt them to inquire about your identity. Thankfully, you've spent enough time in OR units to be able to tell where the staff foot traffic and conversation points towards areas where patients are not present. The break room is smallish, with two microwaves and old sofas and a desk with two laptop computers. A toilet in the corner of it flushes, and it's none other than Marsh who walks out. You met him only briefly, and you were very focused on Sherlock, then, but if there's one thing where your skills of observation have always served you well, it's in remembering faces.
"I've had a few of those. I can tell the difference," I tell him tiredly as I cross the expanse of my —
John glances at his phone because it still isn't ringing. They are both carrying their unit's consultation phone which are used as the call taker's number outside office hours. John is glad that King's, unlike many UK hospitals, has made away with pagers.
"No matter what the reasons for it are, an abortion is never a simple decision — not even when the pregnancy is not viable," Doctor Pichler offers.
John finds a spot to park on a street lining the Square. He remains in the car since it's raining, since he assumes that Sherlock won't want to stay out for long in just his shirtsleeves. Sherlock slips out and goes to sit on the nearest park bench close to the Guard House. John can see his feet from where he's half-concealed by some bushes. They both remain in place for twenty minutes, thirty, forty.
"You can hardly expect us to have those sorts of conversations in your and Mikey's presence. If you didn't want to come here, then why––"
"Don't get snippy with me," Violet orders. "I must say that's quite a morbid way of thinking," she tuts, "Being happy that someone didn't get a chance for surgery."
"If I'm not allowed to speak about whatever I please to whoever I wish, then what am I even doing here?" Sherlock complains.
Invalided home from Afghanistan, running out of funds and convinced that his surgical career is over, John Watson accepts a mysterious job offer to provide care and companionship for a disabled person. Little does he know how much hangs in the balance of his performance as he settles into his new life at Musgrave Court.
After Sherlock had woken up like this, John had decided to pick his battles by letting the truth dawn on Sherlock that he shouldn't be going anywhere today. He should have known that not even jogging downstairs with just socks on his feet had clued London's most brilliant neurosurgeon to the fact that he's not himself entirely right now.
"I guess not." It's obvious to John from what his partner has described that no surgical intervention could have saved the patient's brain. The damage was too devastating, the delay in treatment too long, the bleeding too profuse. "Not an organ donor candidate, either, with that age and those specs."
— covered with an old, lacy bedspread. He has no desire to lie down in it: other people's bedrooms are their domain, their territory. Sherlock suspects he'd feel as restless and awkward there as he feels when forced to interact with people when he doesn't have a clear mission of needing to glean information from them.
"I think it unlikely that he will walk up to you and tell you he wants to talk about what happened. But it doesn't mean that he doesn't need an outlet."
The problem is that it doesn't fit into this flat’s aesthetic, with its marble and chrome and severe black sofas John can never quite find a comfortable position to sit in.
He lets John work on his injury in amicable silence. In the end, the doctor decides he should keep the stitches for two more days but says that it's all healing nicely. He wraps Sherlock's forearm meticulously in bandages, even pulls his sleeve down and gives the wrist a pat. "Try not to get it wet. We need to get you a raincoat, anyway."
"If insisting that physician-to-physician semantic issues justify Roger Fairholme shooting two people is your strategy in this trial, then I do pity the defendant," Sherlock counters. His eyes are blazing with fury at Wareing.
Sherlock says nothing. He just wants this conversation to be over, for Lestrade to stop lecturing at him. He's not going to become scared of operating; he'll just have to start quadruple-checking things, being certain of every damned move he makes in the OR––
"I needed to find out whether you’d be taken to the recovery room or directly to the ITU," Sherlock reminds him. "Where else was I going to go?"
"Who the hell gets burns like this and a head injury and still manages to run out like that?" Bethany says. "Someone did this," she then says, awestruck. "She didn't stop when people tried to help. Must've been running
You know she's asking because withdrawal from alcohol can make people delirious, make them convulse, and compromise surgical results.
Sherlock appreciates that John doesn't try to dismiss his claims and worries. Instead, after the conversations they've had lately, John just expresses supportive acknowledgment of what Sherlock tells him he finds difficult before applying patient logic to counter his arguments. Before, John always made light of things and that just made Sherlock feel even more a failure.
"Just look at him," Violet coos, and John hears the rustling of the pages of the photo album again. "Oh, bless him, he was such a good boy after all those classes you and George took him to."
"I have never tried to claim I was perfect or particularly suited to look after someone like William, but I did my homework; I got him all the help I could and now he resents me for it. Those women in the support group, they understand the kinds of decisions you have to make and how you must accept that this is what your life is now like and how alone you are with all of it! They have so much more support now, bless them, but you heard them: it's still so hard. I had
"Legend says it was lost, but I am more inclined to believe it never even existed. Convenient excuse;
"I have copy sent to King's College," Zezelj answers promptly, then leans away from the screen to comment something to this wife. "Thank you for calling, Mister Holmes, so I can thank you also, not just your boss Mister Less––."
, John reasons. Maybe that increases his chances that his partner might be in the mood for a bit of lovemaking.
John completes the circuit between his imagination and his body by enveloping his glans, pushing the foreskin down with his circled fingers and suckling at the tip with his lips and his tongue. The effect is nearly intolerably intense, and Sherlock only barely keeps his thighs from reflexively jerking together. After the initial assault, John slows the proceedings down, pulling away and wrapping his fingers around the base of Sherlock's cock and delivering slow, meticulous licks up the glans. Once he has Sherlock right where he must have decided he wants him, John envelops the tip with his lips again, grabbing Sherlock's wrist as he reflexively tries to shove John away as the sudden, intense pressure building at the base of his stomach almost short-circuits his frantically firing nerves.
"Didn't catch a name," Sherlock says. He sounds a bit hoarse in his own ears, and he looks at his host instead of the rather graphic sight of the wound with its surrounding skin stained with dark, congealed blood. It has stopped bleeding, but the splinter is still stuck in.
Or does it? Even in death, Victor has a wife. She is the one whose feelings got acknowledged, whose grief was allowed to be public.
"No," Sherlock corrects, and coughs into a crumpled-up tissue. You deliberately avoid looking at it, not wanting to see whether there's more blood.
"Is it?" Sherlock asks, and his tone is odd. Detached. Angry, and it seems to be directed at no one in particular. "Mycroft must have forged my signature by now."
The monitor above him on a shelf begins to emit a warning. Not an emergency one, though — just something to alert that he's approaching tachycardic. Sinus rhythm, though. The BP which has cycled several minutes before shows a perfectly normal reading and you reach up to mute the warnings for two minutes. There is no change in his oxygen saturation which remains normal, yet you can hear his breathing is off. It's shallow, fast, ragged.
"I'll drink it, then," Violet decides. "It's not like you to be this disorganised with your schedules," she then points out. "Especially now that you have that assistant."
"I agree that there needs to be a system to weed out the bad apples," Sherlock replies sharply, "but that system shouldn't be a public circus that treats doctors as guilty until proven innocent."
"Sherlock," he says, and his voice is clearer, now, loud enough to be heard even through the haze of hormones and the veil of drugs. "That’s my real name."
But none of that is happening right now. Instead, Sherlock is staring into the face of the obvious, and refusing to accept it.
"You and Sherlock should have been pharmacists," you scoff. One brother uses their extensive knowledge base for getting high and solving crimes, the second one tries to outwit the other's receptors into not shooting the proverbial wall when they can't do either.
The nurse comes back with a small bottle of intravenous paracetamol and a syringe of what is likely oxycodone.
"It was the same when you boys were small, and George worked. Holidays weren't really holidays; they were… a performance of sorts," Violet says. "We pretended at each other that we were relaxing, but his mind was full of work, and I couldn't even catch my breath, let alone take a moment to just be, busy as I was running after two boys. That mindset of just trying to survive can't just be packed away when it's Christmas or the summer."
"Can I…" John starts, removes his hand from the bottle as he twists his torso so that they are facing each other fully. He gently places his palm on Sherlock's cheek, "…may I kiss you?"
The DI gulps down something from a chipped mug, looking thoughtful. "He's probably getting frisked at the First Night Unit at Wormwood Scrubs. How so?"
There is a number he can call. That number will not connect him to the posthumous voice of John, but to those maintaining his artificial presence in Sherlock's life.
"I detest how he tries to dictate the way we interact, the way he threatens to cut ties if I don't comply with his conditions."
"They will compare what they see to the results of several high-functioning, high-performing individuals."
"For how long?" he demands. "Your physician's oath might have made you stick around for this long, but what if––"
He ends up retreating to bed before John and falling asleep. If he knew that the emotional labour of a therapy session could break through his insomnia, he would have gone to see Joanna Pichler earlier. Or perhaps he wouldn't have. Having to drag himself through the crushed glass in his psyche is a heavy price to pay for a few hours' of slumber.
God, John wishes Joanna Pichler or Molly Hooper would teleport right onto that worn old sofa in the sitting room and tell him what to do, what to say.
"Yes, after a consult with a nutritionist about pertinent diet changes. We picked up his prescription and delivered him back home. I promise you that he's quite alright."
Sherlock can't see his face in the dark, but he can hear the grin in his tone. He should be relieved to hear John is making light of this, if only to spare them both from some overcomplicated emotionally laden conversation. Yet the joke also makes him infuriated, because he doesn't know what he wants — doesn't know what he's allowed to want.
"These physicians rated their experience as stressful or more stressful as pregnancy, being fired from work, retirement or major change in the health of a family member. That's very significant."
The judge clears his throat. "Mister Holmes. We are not here to argue the validity of the semantics of the charges being examined. Answer the question."
It's the patient's fault, isn't it, for wanting the operation in the first place?" he spits out like a cobra.
Sherlock had been asked if he'd allow this lecture to be recorded and streamed online. He'd said yes to the first, no to the second. He might watch the recorded version with Violet at some point, when and if he is ever brave enough to do so.
, I hoped you could fend for yourself and keep your nerves in check just for a moment, but no. It’s time for patches, then. Could have picked them up just now.”
His physical recovery might be going well, but the matter which he'd revealed to you that one night when he finally trusted you with his worries. You have alleviated much of his dread of being rejected but you know, instinctively, that the core of those fears remains: not knowing whether the surgery has left him damaged, somehow. This is what keeps him from returning to the Work, and no neurologist or psychologist could put the issue to rest. As Sherlock had commented, tests designed for any and all patients are tests best suited for people who are most decidedly not like him. An utterly unsuitable for measuring the kinds of changes he's worried about.
"He got you transferred? I assume this means he was your commanding officer?" That would make things complicated even for a heterosexual couple in the army, Sherlock assumes.
is a good summary of how it affects his life," Mycroft answers courteously, "the precise diagnosis he received is a product of a less informed age, so it is best to say that yes, he is on the autism Spectrum. The last thing he would want, however, is to discuss it."
"I’ll be expecting you then. Come here,” John prompts, stretching out his arms so he can briefly wrap them around Sherlock's shoulders and lean his chin on his shoulder.
"Someone leaked what is known about the motive," John curses. "Only a matter of time before the Daily Fail or something publishes Sherlock's name. They're making this into some hero story now, but when they hear the guy was looking for him specifically…"
When you spot the relieved smile on Mike’s face, your nerves settle a bit. He’s a shite liar who’s never been able to conceal worry or his seemingly endless reserves of interest and empathy for people from patients and their families. People like that, you are aware; they seem to think it’s empathetic and honest. The doctorly demeanour you developed — one you'd excused as being more business-like — produced occasional complaints that you seemed cold and uncaring.
He'd been annoyed earlier that he couldn't find the remote for Sherlock's fancy audio system so that he could listen to some radio for company — an indulgence completely out of the question when the man is at home because few things cause such a nails-on-blackboard reaction as commercial radio does. John had ended up placing his laptop on the small desk in the sitting room and listening to some jazz channel chosen at random on Spotify while slowly making his way through the chicken soup he'd ordered from Siam Central, a Thai restaurant a few blocks away. The pain meds must be keeping his appetite in check as a side effect; he hasn't had a proper meal in two weeks now — just scraps of things that are the consistency of baby food, really.
After John had let go of his hand and retreated, Sherlock would have lingered on the front steps of the Drever house to watch him walk away. He would have watched John return to the cocoon of a life which Sherlock had assumed was a prison but may just be a safe haven. A sanctuary for John to escape from himself. To escape from such things as Sherlock.
“I still want to check the current literature for myself,” Sherlock insists, his protest sounding feeble in the face of two colleague staring him down. He digs out his phone from his pocket. “I just need––“
Sherlock draws a deep breath. He's uncertain about why they're discussing this; possibly John had just meant his remarks as light conversation, but Sherlock's thoughts have now turned grim and he wants to banish that gloom before it ruins their evening. "The environment was not the hard part. You were," he admits. "You were so withdrawn. Nothing I did seemed to help. Instead, everything I did just made you push me away. In fact, any time there's a problem with your health, it doesn't seem like I'm your first choice for support because you probably assume that I cannot deliver such a thing."
Sherlock makes no plans for any important conversations that night — a therapy session is plenty enough soul searching for one day. He settles on the sofa with John, feeling so drained that he manages to suffer through two episodes of some reality show in which people create and then present baked goods to professionals in the field. He has no idea why John — or many other employees at King's — seem to enjoy this program so much. Watching other people deal with food is not something Sherlock thinks should be allowed to waste prime time hours.
Glancing at Mycroft, it occurs to you — and not for the first time how different your childhood was from the Holmes'. You went to the village school, then the nearest sixth form. You have no idea why someone would live in London and send their kids to a boarding school in the same city. All those ideas of constant peer socialisation and such seem rather elitist and old-fashioned to you, and your parents could never have afforded to pay tens of thousands of pounds for your schooling per year. They struggled to make ends meet. You were a hard-working student, and you knew what you wanted, and that's what got you into a university. Not Oxbridge, not even anywhere in London, but a decent medical programme. You're aware Mycroft is an Oxford graduate, and that Sherlock attended Cambridge for an undergrad degree, then dropped out soon after, though he was admitted to a PhD program. You can't help but wonder if those two geniuses couldn't have got into such institutions even from less prestigious sixth form schools.
"What’s the clientele like in the area, then? Why not go to Canary Wharf where all the rich yuppies are bound to need their coke and Adderall for all-night work?"
Sherlock has never quite grasped how to tell when symbolic value is enough in a gift, or when favours and services rendered should be met with a more worthy offering.
"I doubt he'd understand the purpose of such a conversation; he's inherited George's pragmatism. Our Mikey lives very much in the present and looks to the future; he's not sentimental, does not cling to the past like Sherlock does. I do wonder, though… Sherlock likely remembers that summer, remembers being sent away for a few weeks."
There are days that are better and days that are not good. This morning is not a good one, which means that today won't be any good in its entirety. I follow John around, thoughts too scattered to manage proper clothes. I'm cold in just my dressing gown and underwear, flitting about just outside the bathroom door as he brushes his teeth and does whatever things he does in there after waking up. I have routines, too, now — with a child in the house, one must adjust — but today they elude me. I haunt John uselessly, plant myself in his way because I need something I do not know the name of.
John is tempted to demand to know why Sherlock hadn't called him. Once he was given sedation for the procedure, he may have been unable to do so, but why not tell him before? It occurs to John that Sherlock may have asked Mycroft to contact him. Perhaps the older Holmes has done the unforgivable and not kept John up to date like he'd promised. "I'm getting on that plane tomorrow."
. John and Edgar are, if not quite friends, then at least on very good terms these days, but there is no changing certain habits of John's, and mostly Sherlock finds his restrained possessiveness quite attractive and flattering, especially after all these years.
Sherlock goes to the kitchen and washes his hands under water as hot as he can endure. Its warmth flowing between his fingers is the first soothing thing he's found since attempting to retreat to bed. Perhaps he should take a bath. He wishes he could call John, to tell him of the test he'd staged for himself. He knows he can’t. This is one of the things which will forever separate him from his husband, but it’s alright. John doesn’t have to always understand him, but he has demonstrated empathy for Sherlock, at least when the latter behaves according to John's standards, and that needs to be enough. Sherlock knows better than to push his luck by risking John's opinion of him deteriorating further.
"Because of his history? They told you about that?" It's imperative that Leah understands that doses of opioids normally used on people will do very little for Sherlock. Or so you are convinced. So you fear.
. It appears that even in the age of female emancipation, a female composer cannot escape such imagery when being evaluated against her male counterparts.
He circles to the opposite side and painstakingly, side-first with his arm muscles bearing the brunt of the work, lowers himself onto his side. You turn on the lamp on the bedside cabinet on the opposite side and grab whatever book is at the top of the one of the piles on the floor. It's on the history of London, and it'll have to do.
He had walked out and not returned to the session. Frustration had made him as incoherent as he always is when other people require him to discuss his emotional landscape. That's why he doesn't want to book another session with her. It would be hard to express to her what he is feeling about John's recovery, and shouldn't he have learned enough tricks from her by now to try to work things out on his own? He knows that the stupid emoji is a symbol for a heart, which makes no sense; it's nothing like the cardiac organ sitting in everyone's chest. It's therefore more like a metaphor, an implicit simile, which means it's literally false. John is not referring to an actual heart; what he is trying to communicate is that he loves Sherlock.
Mike turns to face him with a reserved smile. "It can elevate the risk of other arrhythmias, and house practice is to reserve it for patients with difficult airways…"
"It'll be just some fish, potatoes and dill," John says, vacillating with his hand perched on the door handle to the kitchen. "Nothing fancy," he adds apologetically, as though expecting Sherlock to only eat chateaubriand when in London.
An intense deluge of relief and longing had hit Sherlock and nearly knocked him off his feet with such revelatory news. He wouldn't have allowed himself to be disappointed that John wasn't coming; it would have been pointless since an airport strike and bad weather and whatever else had wrecked John's original flight schedule could not be fixed, even with Mycroft's connections. Sherlock doesn't quite know what to do with the fact that John is willing to battle an aviation chaos to get to Switzerland. Wouldn't it have been more practical to reschedule his arrival for a later date than to take time off work? Whenever John takes a holiday, his administrative duties stack up, and he ends up spending at least a week doing overtime and being tetchy.
, so how could he have forgot how it all works? This has never been a problem, not really, because he loves having sex with John.
"I'm not exhausted. It just all feels so… those things don't quite feel like significant achievements in hindsight. All it feels like is as though I've opened a door, expecting the finishing line, but all I see is an endless marathon of more challenges."
"What's that supposed to mean? Of course, I say or do the wrong thing sometimes, everybody does. I just have no idea right now what that is, and I have to admit I'm sometimes too bloody knackered to play guessing games."
There's a door that leads directly from the bedroom to the bathroom. John hears it open and close. Neither of them uses it much; he wonders if Sherlock is doing so now because he's picked up on who's in the flat and doesn't want to talk to Doctor Pichler.
