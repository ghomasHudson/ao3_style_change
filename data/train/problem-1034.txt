And there are nights, somewhere between a few and many, when they lob guarded glances at one another, and John reaches out, and Sherlock grumbles, and they slow dance around each other until something gives, and then usually there is sex and usually it is fine, all fine, but not transcendent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And for data I need observations, the only way to build a solid theory, and clearly you need to be involved, since you are the subject of the theory, but not with me, since that would introduce an observer bias and in any case we’ve clearly already shown that I don’t know what I’m doing because it is not my area even though that’s fine by the way, not having that as an area is completely fine, but that doesn’t help with the data, so clearly we will need a third party in order to obtain—“
They sit in silence again for a few minutes. Tentatively, John reaches for Sherlock's scalp, muttering "don't worry, I'll try not to prod too hard."
On his third time to the sink, he walks right into Sherlock.  It’s understandable – he’s never seen Sherlock washing forks before, and feels a little surprised that Sherlock knows his way around a dishrag.  He leaves the utensils to Sherlock in favor of starting the water for tea, and that’s when it hits him, Sherlock is looking artfully innocent, as if fork-washing were a daily occurrence.  Suspicion blooms into certainty in John’s head, and he can’t help adopting a teasing tone when he mutters “Bet you googled it.  Answers.com?”
John stitched him up with only a few extra jabby parts, and fetched an extra blanket for sleeping on the couch. Sherlock did feel a little sorry about that part, but after he’d mistaken a street sign for a hippopotamus and tried to talk the wallpaper into changing colors, he supposed that John had made the eminently logical choice.
“It was a little fast, I know, I’m working on it,” admitted John ruefully.  “Isn’t that what the morning after is for?”
John realizes that this has gone too far on when he can’t stop crying after he comes, alone, in his own bedroom.
“It wasn’t locked,” states Sherlock.
.  He’s fairly certain there’s no way those words hold water on their own, so he makes do with silence.  He watches John’s eyes flick over him.  John removes his hand from the other man’s back, Sherlock finds he can breathe a little better, and he sees John nod to himself.  But then he can’t breathe again because John is moving his hand up, almost touching the other man’s hair, and John is smiling a little, and Sherlock knows
So it was fine, and Sherlock went on exploring, and eventually he wanted to see the hip, to trace the pathways that led from being shot in the shoulder to walking with a limp, and that would involve John wearing less clothing.  Not that John seemed likely to complain.  But reaching down to undo someone else’s trousers, pressing into the softness of their belly to get the button loose, tugging at a zip over a hard cock, those intimate actions were beyond Sherlock right now.   Instead he straddled John’s knees, keeping his right hand where it was, and running one finger of the other along John’s waistband, dipping below when he could.  After a few passes, he pressed his cheek against John’s belly and tongued at the smooth cool skin.  John was jerking under his head, and making small strangled noises, almost like he was about to cry, so Sherlock turned to look up at him again and John pleaded “Sherlock love, please don’t stop now, you … I can’t… please…” which confused Sherlock again – had John always called him love?  He couldn’t remember at that moment.
Finally the timer buzzes and Sherlock drops his hands from where John had asked him to stroke lightly up and down the backs of his thighs.  A moment later, the hands return and stutter out a few more strokes, then disappear again.  Sherlock clears his throat, and John cranes his neck back at him with a smile that Sherlock doesn’t return.
Whoever just left kudos -- thank you!! (and wow, you're fast!) I find posting really stressful, so it's lovely to see that people are reading and enjoying!
There is a careful approach fraught with secret codes and passwords that change from week to week, monsters that roam and quicksands and shifting tides. There is nothingness. There are echoes of shouting, and insults that can interpreted in multiple ways.  There is (somedays) a tipping point, though it shifts continually in the shimmering landscape, and some days Sherlock is happy to tumble over it and other days he digs his heels and fingertips into the bare rock and pouts.
After the giggling subsided, Sherlock shook his head and said “My way is tiring, it seems.”
Another day he may decide to acquire his first ever straight-edge razor and learn on John, and dear god, if you look up “erotic danger” in the dictionary, John is pretty sure all you’ll find is a picture of Sherlock guiding the cold blade over John’s outstretched throat.  It’s especially delightful because Sherlock compensates him for the few small cuts (“beginner’s nerves, John”) by licking the oozing blood delicately off John’s skin with the tip of his tongue.
After almost a week of this, Sherlock has reached his limit.  Yes, there’s a case, yes, it’s at least a seven, yes, he’s positively brimming with the need to go and do something -- these all seemed like perfectly reasonable reasons when he was in the process of bursting into John’s room.
“And none of those involved fucking me either,” Sherlock pushes on relentlessly.
“You removed the lock,” accuses Sherlock, and John sighs and says “because it wasn’t doing any good, Sherlock.”
Sherlock doesn’t notice a thing, and the system works brilliantly until John gets sloppy.
“Used to do this when I was a kid,” he says by way of explanation, stepping onto the first bed and springing a foot into the air.  It takes a few jumps to get the feel of it back, and then he bounces, lands sprawlingly on his back, flips to his front in the air, goes heels over head to his back again, and lays there looking up at Sherlock.
John is not sure what to say. He blinks slowly, then he ventures "I suppose that would be ok.  I mean, you probably picked the only part of my body I haven't fantasized about having your tongue on, but --"
At least, nothing that he
The long ride home is also silent.  Sherlock spends several minutes texting with Lestrade, then he pockets his phone and reaches hesitantly for somewhere in the vicinity of John’s left ear.  John’s looks up at him sideways and lets Sherlock’s hand fall to his shoulder, lets himself be pulled close, and smiles while Sherlock nuzzles at his hair.
But not often.
Once inside, he’s less sure of himself, because “Bloody fuck Sherlock!” John gasps, and buries himself in the duvet so fast that Sherlock wonders if he’s been practicing.  His violent burrowing sends the bottle of lube flying through a perfect spinning arc to shatter at Sherlock’s feet.  John goes bright red fading to aubergine around the edges, and Sherlock steps carefully away from the slippery mess.
The rest of the short ride, and indeed most of the day, proceeds in prickly silence.  By the time they arrive back at the flat, Sherlock has provoked, insulted and/or caused the arrest of a handful of imposing-looking physical specimens, but John has done one better -- he has managed to rile, vex, flummox, and/or show up the world’s only consulting detective at nearly every turn, and it hasn’t earned him a single “brilliant” or “luminous”.
John’s idea of a lovely night with Sherlock contains all of the above plus tracing the lines of Sherlock’s collarbone under his silk shirt (especially the aubergine one, god John loves that one, he hadn’t even known they made shirts that color). This makes Sherlock smile and squint at him.  It includes John leaning his forehead into Sherlock’s back, right between his ridiculously sharp shoulder blades (and bonus points if he can get Sherlock to take that aubergine shirt off) and breathing softly along the gentle knobs of Sherlock’s spine.  This makes Sherlock shiver and tip his head back. It includes John circling Sherlock’s elongated frame with his powerful arms, hands splayed not to tickle, fingers coming to rest on Sherlock’s equally sharp hipbones.  This makes Sherlock take a deep breath and turn to bury his head in John’s shoulder.  And that’s where it ends, because John, despite his large and varied experience, has yet to chart a way forward that doesn’t involve Sherlock going cool and leaning away.  He has tried more, tried less, tried slow, tried slower, but no matter how promising the beginning, the end is frustratingly the same.
He still watches Sherlock on the stairs. He still fantasizes in the privacy of his own room – although Sherlock seems quite keen on sleeping with him.  Tentatively he adds “sleeping with me” to the List of What Sherlock Likes, but for his sanity he needs his own room sometimes.  Maybe there should be a schedule for that as well.
Sherlock nods almost absent-mindedly, and continues, as if he never paused “every relationship I had, the other person wanted... just wanted… not wrong, but not what I wanted.  And either they weren’t worth the trouble, that was fine, just end it there… or they were, maybe, and then we argued and they tried to be sensitive and I tried to be … accommodating.  I’m good at that you know.”  John grimaces, remembering how many times he’s seen Sherlock shamming.  “Until I got bored,” continues Sherlock. “And then it would end too.  Not fine.”
“Right,” says John flatly.
John considers forcing the burden of this conversation onto Sherlock, and maybe he felt neglected enough to do that 10 minutes ago, but 10 minutes can be a lifetime and right now he can see how hard this is on Sherlock.  His ears are fluctuating from pink to red and spots come and go on his cheeks as well.
Or maybe it was even more like that, and John has squeezed the sap out of the memories like pressing autumn leaves in his biochem textbook.
He puts the lock on carefully and tells himself that he wouldn’t want to upset Mrs. Hudson with holes in her woodwork.  He sweeps up the bit of shavings and then scuffs over the floor to erase the evidence of sweeping.
“No,” John answers shortly.
Life was dangerous, Sherlock knew that. Their lives in particular. He was not a safe person, and neither was John.
“But I don’t, John.”
“You never felt the need to ... violate me before, did you?”
Well, that was true in its own way.  That first night.  It could have happened to anyone, too.  Anyone who had been shot in the desert, come damn near to bleeding out on the sand, spent months too wracked from injury and therapy to even think about additional activities, then months after that avoiding his therapist despite a stress disorder compounded by clinical depression, then even more months after that being cockblocked by his sodding fuckmonkey of a flatmate who interrupted, interceded, invited himself on, or, in one memorable case, sent an actual ninja armed with nunchucks to break up his date for the evening -- the same sodding fuckmonkey who, on that first night, pored over John’s body with his bloody magnifying glass, while the heat of his lips and his breath and the feathering of his lashes made John moan and squirm and goddamn writhe under him.  John had gotten himself about halfway out of his trousers before coming rather spectacularly but still technically in his pants and untouched by Sherlock.  At which Sherlock had smiled his brilliant smile as if that had been the plan all along, and started chattering about fingerprints on ice-cube trays.
"Anything?"
Sex for Sherlock is a more complicated thing, though.
“Sherlock!” John resorted to a drill sergeant’s bark now and that worked, that quieted the inside of Sherlock’s head and even allowed the visual world to drop its surrealist edges and Sherlock could see John again,
Finally a glint of amusement breaks through John’s anger, and he says softly, “something with fewer syllables than ‘Vatican Cameos’?”
There is a long silence in which no one moves.
Still, things had gone too far this time. Something had to be done.
The Kiss (in John’s mind it appeared with capital letters) had come on a Sunday in the flush of victory over a case.  That left Monday, Tuesday (wallpaper still as intact as before) and Wednesday for John to worry the problem like a toothache.  But by Thursday morning he was ready to let bygones be bygones.  From what he gathered (Sherlock seemed not at all interested in further discussions) one advantage of a schedule was not needing to worry about whether sex was ok on the specified day, and John took that to heart.  If all he had was Thursday, then might as well have a plan.  In fact John had spent the better part of Thursday morning, starting not long after midnight, mapping out a strategy, considering alternatives, running scenarios in his head, and needing to start all over when his thoughts inevitably became derailed.  But by the time he was ready to leave for the clinic, The Plan was perfected.  Because what Sherlock didn’t know, yet, was that John was bloody good at this, and he enjoyed being good at it, was a bit proud of it.  So if all he had was Thursdays, he would make it Enough.
They stare at each other for several more seconds, and the other man moves suddenly, knocking John to the bed and attempting to pin him there, but John is too fast, merely rolls to one side and flips to end up on top.  The other man kicks at his knee and succeeds in knocking it out from under John, toppling John onto his stomach in a rather undignified way, but John is reaching for the man’s hair…
“All right then,” John temporizes, and Sherlock interrupts it with “If this is about privacy--” managing to make it sound like a dirty word while John breaks in with “it’s not” and more quietly “not exactly”.
"Jesus, we've really got ourselves into it, haven't we?" John shakes his head. After several minutes, he forces himself to keep talking. "So, what would be something you would choose?"
“You have no idea,” John rasps, “what I want to do to you.”
"Under the circumstances..." offers the other man wryly.  Then, when John looks unlikely to bite, he adds "Let me know if you get bored with him."
"I meant your eyes."
Moving forward gets harder rather than easier, but finally he is at the door, the key fitting neatly, the knob turning scratchily in his hand.  He steps quietly into the dusty room, sees John look up wearily from the armchair pushed against one wall, obviously expecting one of Mycroft’s associates.  In a moment, Sherlock takes in the hunch of his shoulders and scrabbling of his hand.
"Sherlock!” John almost rolls his eyes.  “No… But when I did this with Bill," putting his hand lightly onto Sherlock's hair and teasing at one of the curls, "I bet you practically jumped out of your skin.  That's more what's meant by..."
“Why? Because of me?”
John nods.  He’s never been entirely comfortable talking about Sherlock’s mind palace, and this doesn’t seem like a good time to start.
Sherlock lifts his hand deliberately and settles it in John's short hair.  He rubs small circles and loops until John's breathing is easy again, and John knows he is sleepy, he can barely keep his eyes open, because this has been probably the longest day of his life, which is saying something for an ex-army ex-medic from Afghanistan.  "Come," murmurs Sherlock.  "You need to sleep."
“Exactly,” beamed Sherlock. “I knew you would figure it out.”
Maybe John should be angry at being made into an experiment, at being used once again to prove Sherlock's brilliance, but he thinks of all of the times Sherlock must have needed to armor himself against the person who was meant to love him, and he can't summon up the indignation.
After the artichokes were gone and he had drunk three glasses of brunello to Sherlock's one, John had smiled a bit fuzzily and suggested a movie. He eyes were closed almost before he got to the couch, but Sherlock followed anyway. It was his couch after all. He sat primly on one end and watched as John gradually relaxed into a sprawl, still smiling with his head tucked into one elbow. Sherlock steepled his hands and considered Lestrade's text, running scenarios and solutions in his mind, but it was like watching a jerky silent movie, not at all his normal electric flow from thought to thought. It was really quite difficult to think with John taking up half of the couch. Like a physical roadblock in his head. He scowled down at John and was surprised to see a hand, fingers, his own hand obviously, his own fingers running through John's hair. John's hair was soft, a bit coarser at his temples and the nape of his neck. Sherlock closed his eyes, wondering if he could identify the bones of John's skull from touch alone. He was really quite sleepy too. That must account for the jerky still-movie in his thoughts. It was ridiculous to be sleepy when he'd slept only the night before, but there it was. Perhaps artichokes or olive oil or mint had soporific effects. And John's hair, thousands upon thousands of individual strands, were tickling his palm. He thought he could probably count them by feel if he wasn't so sleepy. John Watson, he would say, did you realize that you average 335 hairs per square centimeter? And John would give him that quiet look that meant he wasn't sure whether to be impressed or worried, and Sherlock would veer off into murder weapons or the principles of retrofitting a secret room instead of saying I love you and wait, what? Secret rooms or murder weapons, then, or why beginners fail at lockpicking, or the best way to shoplift costume jewelry, although it wouldn't work if it was raining out, or essentials of surviving if kidnapped and locked in the boot of a small car...
, well, not quite as good as some of his more ridiculous fantasies, but still and all, for a first time, it is amazing, really.  A bit fast, perhaps, but aren’t all first times?  He tries to slow down, tries to think of surgery or runny noses or any unsexy topic just to get hold of himself, but every thought that isn’t
John shoves his sleep pants partly down, applies the condom and lube with a steady hand, and pushes into the other man with one practiced motion.  Sherlock is fascinated with what comes next, because he would not have recognized this if he hadn’t seen what John was doing with the kissing.  John changes his angle slightly on each stroke, he speeds up and slows down, he adds a slight twist, and each time Sherlock can see he is testing the results, waiting.  Sometimes a combinations works and John stays with it for 20 or 30 seconds, but then there is a subtle shift and John is searching and testing again. Each time he gets it right, the other man moans or curses or, in one case, whimpers, which Sherlock can scarcely credit.  Then, so softly that Sherlock barely catches it, John asks “good?” and the other man nods again.  John speeds up and Sherlock times the other man’s breaths, curious whether they follow a regular pattern or are as chaotic as they seem.  Finally the other man cries out “oh god, that’s it, harder, jesus” and jerks over and over.  John looks down at him, and Sherlock sees his hand reach towards the other man face, but it stops.  It looks like John is biting his lip – why?  Has he been hurt?  After a long pause, John pulls out, discards the condom, and finishes himself with five strong and efficient pulls.  He is silent for the first three, but his breath hitches on the fourth, and on the fifth he is mouthing words, so it's good that Sherlock is an accomplished lip-reader, which he needs to be in this profession, and he reads "idiot, git, berk, sodding idiot" over and over until John collapses onto the bed.
Five days and three cases after the trampoline incident, Dimmock hands Sherlock an honest-to-god ten.  John watches, amused and not even trying to hide his pride, as Sherlock rampages through the the case, his very own bull in a candy shop.  As two days stretch into three and then four, John is sometimes with him, sometimes at the clinic, sometimes trying to urge tea and toast, and sometimes heading pointedly to bed in hopes that Sherlock will get a little rest.  Sherlock brushes at John like a moth fluttering too close to flame, and he doesn’t follow John anywhere.  Sherlock sleeps, John knows he must do somehow, but John hasn’t figured out how or where yet.
It’s a blank door in a nondescript neighborhood in a forgettable exurb, and Sherlock doesn’t even want to know how or why Mycroft chose this place.  All of his energy is focussed on the man that he has been promised he will find on the third floor.  Despite the reams of data he has meticulously collected and preserved on the subject on John Watson, M.D., Captain, and Combat Doctor, he finds himself unable to predict how John will react to his return from the dead.  His mind won’t frame even the most rudimentary deduction.  He is, in fact, desperate for this part to be over, desperate to simply
.  Too much in fact.  Far too much.  Before he knew what he was doing, he had pushed John’s hand away, and the lack of touch bit hard and tasted bloody and he closed his eyes and clenched his jaw and waited to feel how John would accomplish removing himself from the couch which Sherlock would give up willingly if he were a better person.
It had been easier before, watching John lusting after him and trying to hide it.
Finally both men are panting, and he sees that John’s belligerence has given way to a sort of grudging respect.  Sherlock can see 15 tells of physical attraction in the other man, 5 in John.  In a lull in the action, the other man crooks half a smile at John, and John nods once.
The other man is a bit taller than John, sinewy, with blond spiky hair.  He follows John into the bedroom and makes to shake hands, but John keeps his at his sides and cuts the man off when he tries to offer his name.
“And I don’t want a show,” Sherlock manages in a barely neutral voice.  “I love you,” he adds, as if that explains something.  When John doesn’t move, Sherlock slowly lowers his forehead to John’s shoulder, then slots himself behind John and tips them onto the bed.   His lean body curls around John protectively and they are quiet for a long time.
A disgruntled Sherlock hails a cab, and when the address has been given, he mutters “You got an email request from a Mr. Easy Wilson, bodybuilder and personal trainer, who complains that his hitherto profitable sinecure has been dissolved as of --”
John didn’t glimpse anything like understanding in Sherlock’s eyes, but Sherlock had at least promised to knock.
“There are over 7 billion people in the world today, John, and a good percentage of those are not you or I.  It won’t be too hard to find one of them.”
“I,  oh.  Thursdays?” repeated John, just as if Sherlock hadn’t already stated that quite clearly.
“It’s really
“What?!”
“John John JOHN -- it’s a six at least, I realize that the world of competitive body-building is is a strange and unhealthy perversion of athleticism, and the bootleg Russian translation seems like a minute and bizarre point, but a fascinating case can emerge from -- ” Sherlock bursts through the door but stops short when he sees John getting up from the bed, eyes forward, head already nodding in agreement.
“With a third party?”
“Fine.”  Sherlock blinked, wondering what John was agreeing to, as John’s fingers caught at the edge of his jumper, yanked it over his head, forcing Sherlock into a quick grab at the couch to avoid being dislodged. “I know what you want,” John grimaced.  As Sherlock tried to kickstart his brain, John calmly unbuttoned his shirt, oblivious to Sherlock’s precarious hold on couch or composure. “Right, then,” he concluded, leaning back, “look your fill,” and Sherlock realized he was meant to be looking at John’s scar.  Because apparently John had noticed, really John was quite perceptive when it came to certain things.  That wound, that scar – the actual physical presence hidden by horrid jumpers and stripey pullovers, and why did John never just wear a simple tee? – but its consequences so obvious to a man who couldn’t help but notice everything, every tiny inconsequential detail around him.  So Sherlock was not so much actually looking at the scar as he was comparing the real, flesh-and-blood scar with the one he’d created in his mind, built from every small observation of John, from the way his shoulder hitched sometimes when he took a gallon of milk from the fridge, to the way he twisted slightly to open a cab door.  He traced each line of the scar with his eyes, correcting the geometry and colouration of his private version as he went, soothed back into a languorous contentment again.
do, since you asked, is need privacy.” John knows he should say something, really he does, he knows he should stop Sherlock, but damn, they’ve been lovers -- and
W: I’m sorry
“Forty-six minutes,” answers Sherlock automatically, and when John frowns at him, he pulls out his mobile and clarifies “46 minutes and 25 seconds.”
That afternoon, John appeared in his going out jacket just as Sherlock began emulsifying the watermelon.  John looked bemused but sounded unconvinced that disposal by emulsification was a viable criminal option, although Sherlock vigorously denied having tested that hypothesis, which John could have checked easily by counting the ears in the fridge. John looked faintly disgusted when Sherlock showed him the watermelon recipe, but leaned against the doorframe so long that he finally sat down to watch in comfort.
John barks out a laugh.  “Well, there was the magnifying glass, and the mud, and the razor, and the trampoline, and the sleeping with you…”
the first, too.  You’re the first one that I
Sherlock flops wordlessly on the bed next to him and John sets the timer and glances at the laptop.  There is a spreadsheet open, but nothing recorded.  John turns his attention back to Sherlock, starting with a heavy feathering that he knows Sherlock likes, then murmurs “tell me what you want, love.”  There is a silence nearly broken by the furrowing of Sherlock’s brow as he scowls into the mattress.  John considers stopping until Sherlock actually says something, but decides that that is against the spirit of the game, if not the letter of it.
It’s not that Sherlock doesn’t trust his memory, but he still prefers to take some notes as well.  From his perch, he watches a good ten minutes of sparring that looks, to him, nothing like a sexual relationship.  He records several attempted jabs to the eye, two shin kicks, and a bear hug, but none of this is really helping him understand anything.
Then John’s warm hands were strong on his arms, squeezing him together and the voice out of his head.
“I’m fine, Sherlock,” John cuts him off finally.  “I had a part to play, just like you did.  We’ve been over all of this.  There’s a plan, yeah?”
do. John is cursing himself already for a coward and a gentleman, but he will impale himself on his own prick before he would take advantage of Sherlock asleep.  It’s not a game of cat and mouse they’ve been playing, not angst and subterfuge and misunderstanding -- no, there have been enough words that John knows just exactly how unwelcome his advances would be.
.  John is not sure he could survive that twice.
And Sherlock finally noticed how John was rocking slightly, how his hand open and shut by his side, how his face flushed.  Right, friction, Sherlock remembered.  That was the missing element.  He could spare one hand while keeping his mouth where it was… And when he did, when he set his hand approximately over the obvious bulge in John’s jeans and pressed a little in time with the rocking, John moaned low and choked through a few breaths, and then his face relaxed marginally and he murmured something into Sherlock’s hair.
“Don’t stop now,” John murmured softly.
“Hey, it’s all right,” John’s using his talking-to-a-ten-year-old-with-a-wounded-dog voice, and it’s annoying even him.  “I thought—“
“But there should be enough for dinner, if you’d like to—“
Sherlock could go 53 hours without so much as a catnap, had done it once in a case that involved two footchases, an interrogation, a bit of brilliant deduction at the 51 hour mark, just to keep the suspect in custody,
“It’s really only a six, a sort of a cold six at that,” Sherlock essays, but John is already halfway down the stairs.
All right then.  But first he needs to get himself together.  Not entirely to his surprise, he finds that 90 seconds is indeed more time than he needs if he is methodical and goal-oriented.  Then it’s a simple job to do up his flies and grab his jacket. Lacking a swirling coat to pull Sherlock in his wake, he settles for a hand grasping biceps, and keeps his mouth shut when Sherlocks demands an explanation.
“Save some for me, yeah? I’ve got a date.”
“Bloody hell, Sherlock, are you trying to get us evicted?” John sounded more alarmed than endeared, so Sherlock lowered the torch repentantly, but that didn’t help much because “Toaster oven, Sherlock!! You absolutely cannot set the toaster oven on fire again.” John was trying to broadcast urgency and stealth simultaneously. Sherlock rolled his eyes and moved an additional one and a half inches away from the toaster oven.
“I’ll get you a new one,” he offers in a conciliatory tone.
But it had improved. A texted demand for 10 mLs of black garlic oil had delayed John, and by the time he walked in the door (Sherlock knew from a glance that the garlic oil had only been located on the third try), Sherlock was just adding mint leaves and lemon zest to his prawns and artichokes.
For that matter, he doesn’t know what Mycroft has told John or whether John expects him at all. A love of drama is a fine thing in principle, he thinks, but nevertheless he sloughs off at least the mannerisms of his disguise as he walks through the dingy hall.
“Exactly.  Clearly I need more data.”  John winced, because now Sherlock was doing that disconcerting thing where he had decided on an answer and was convinced it needed to be communicated at great speed and all in one breath.  Possibly before it could self-destruct.
“Don’t what?” John answers with a frown. “Wank?”
“Yes, there’s a problem,” John realizes he’s going to have to spell some things out for Sherlock.  “You can’t just come leaping in here with a case when I’m -- when this is -- when I need privacy.”
Sherlock relaxes a little, ignoring the second part of John’s statement, which seemed a little barbed anyway.  But John has nudged him back to thinking about Data, and he has questions.  “I don’t understand really.  You were angry and resistant, you never went above 9 tells, not even when – at the end – and then you liked him enough to, well…” Sherlock is not sure if he can bring himself to articulate it again, but John rescues him.
“Oy!” There’s a shout from the burly man who gave them the booties.  “You two!  Lovebirds!  One at a time on the trampoline!”
"What's this then?" John asks, but he falls silent as Sherlock puts hands on John's shoulders and circles them slowly down John's arms, as far as he can reach while sitting on the back of an armchair, and the slowly up John's back.  His hands feather at first, but within a few circles he is pressing, digging, smoothing, each finger separately inducing relaxation. John is surprised to find that Sherlock is quite good at this.
"Yes.  Maybe.  I mean, because you wanted to explore this question," Sherlock is backpedalling.
again, and he saw Sherlock with no protection, and when John lifted his eyebrows, Sherlock felt
“John, I—“
“How?” the single word seemed to burn through John’s mouth.
“Well, that’s new,” Sherlock mumbles into the pillowcase, and John swats him lightly on the arse.
After that things get a bit hazy.  He is fairly clear on the part where Sherlock shoved him backwards up the steps, and he remembers that getting clothes off seemed to take several days.  But in the end they are together on Sherlock’s huge bed, and somehow he ends up in Sherlock’s mouth, and
“You wanted to touch him when he came, didn’t you?”
On Thursday morning, Sherlock drank the tea and ate the toast John made him, then spent the morning searching for the right case – it wouldn’t do to have a mystery hanging over him by evening, or a 3-day marathon without sleep or food, or worst of all, something dangerous enough to call John in.  After all, he had promised, more or less, and he was reasonably sure John had understood, despite the frustrating amounts of repetition, and Sherlock knew that keeping promises was important in a relationship, really one of the first and easiest rules in that slippery world.
At least with a steaming mug in hand they’d have something other than their shoes to look at.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock immediately regrets using the word we, but his thumbs had been faster than his brain and had sent it already.  Perhaps John will assume Sherlock now uses the Majestic Plural, he is not the common wealth after all, instead of as an incorrect personal pronoun.
“Unless it’s with-”
At last, John arrives.
“It’s not that,” John starts and then sighs, “I’m not-“
Molly understands cats better than people, and for lack of a better analogy, Sherlock had been an arrogant and pampered cat before he went away for two years and before he lost his best friend to marriage and then watched Mary die and lost him a second time. Now he was acting like that cat who, after being stray for a long time, seemed repentant and starving for affection.
“We can have another made-“
“Demisexual,” John ponders aloud and Sherlock watches him with amusement as the realization dawns. John’s eyebrows lift as his mouth turns down and points to himself, “You mean?”
It was unlikely he would answer, but Violet only took a moment to consider it before scrolling to Sherlock’s name on her phone and clicking “call”. It rang several times, and then went to Voicemail.
“Erm…I’m going to lunch,” a man’s  voice in the background said, awkwardly, as though imposing, “Lab’s unlocked.”
Texts go ignored.
“It’s past 1 in the morning, what are you doing here? Is Watson ill?” Sherlock asked, his voice inadvertently betraying his worry.
“Now, to business; I hear you are looking for a new flat.” There was a groan on the other end that sounded a lot like her eldest son’s name. “And I just wanted to say that if you needed a place to lay your head for a while, you’re always welcomed to come back home. I know you were just here on your birthday, but your father would be keen to have the company. He’s bored, love. Retirement doesn’t suit him- I’ve a mind to send him back to work just to keep him out of my hair.”
All Sherlock manages in response is a shrug.
The admission stung and Sherlock’s eyebrows drew together for a moment before he carefully schooled his expression again. As much as Sherlock wanted to forget that period in their lives, he couldn’t. He wouldn’t allow himself to. He kept it close, not out of spite, but as a reminder of how very much he had to lose. John’s letter was all but nailed to the door of his mind palace.
“Well,” Sherlock says, “It is missing a few things…”
“Either you already know why and can’t stomach it, or you really don’t and you’re an idiot.”
John blinks rapidly and looks around the room, wishing that Mary could tell him what to do now. She picked a fine time to disappear. John’s throat is constricting and he fights down a swallow while simultaneously willing the tears to absorb back into their ducts.
They both look up as John appears in the doorway of the side exit, a bundle of blankets that is Rosamund Mary Watson in his arms. Sherlock offers Mary a little smile and she loops her arm back through his.
“Alright dear, good luck with the case. Do let me know when you have your new mailing address. I’d like to send you a postcard from the Netherlands when daddy and I go.”
Luckily the “extremely” part had still panned out well. While John knocked out the suspects in a business-like way, Sherlock found himself sprayed by an unknown substance with mildly hallucinogenic effects and gashed by a well-handled letter opener. When he woozily suggested that John should return to his date in time for cheesecake, he got a familiar look of exasperation which may or may not have been mitigated with fondness.
Sherlock is staring at him, drinking in every detail, and just before John breaks, he whispers "touch yourself.  You know what you like.  Do it."  and John obeys and one sharp tug is all it takes and he is completely and utterly undone.
“Right then, it’s a date,” John finished his tea and left Sherlock making ravioli number 137.
W: All right then.  Good night.
“I’m sorry – “ John begins.
W: I acknowledge that last night didn’t go as planned.
Sherlock shakes his head.  “Mine does,” he states emphatically, adding  “Yours is not very efficient,” and immediately looks stricken.  “I didn’t mean that,” he tries to cover, but John rolls his eyes.
W: I’m still sorry.
It went like clockwork.  John spotted the bottle of brunello left on the counter, and poured himself a glass, then looked over at Sherlock inquiringly. Sherlock shrugged and found himself with a glass as well. They ate and John recounted a particularly gory broken ulna at the surgery that day. By the time John was refilling his plate, Sherlock had almost relaxed again.
The first few times it happened, Sherlock treated John to a blow-by-blow recounting of his date the next morning, but that made little difference except that now John was sometimes gone for the entire night and right through his clinic shift, and Sherlock had to make his deductions after half the evidence had been erased the next afternoon. An amusing challenge, yes, but hardly a satisfactory situation.
Sherlock stopped because John had pounced on him
Sherlock wonders whether the day of the week is an important variable or merely a distractor.  He would like to wait until next Thursday, just in case, but he’s not sure John’s willingness (if it can be called willingness) can be extended that long.  John has been glowering non-stop since 9:17 this morning, the moment that he stopped proposing alternatives and starting negotiating conditions, and looks set on glowering right through the sleeping night if Sherlock doesn’t do something quickly.
Gadgets could be ordered online, but ingredients needed to be bought in person, the book was quite clear on that point.  Sherlock had always been happy for food to simply appear pre-bought.  He assumed it was John, since Mrs. Hudson was vociferously not a housekeeper.  Sherlock considered making out a shopping list, leaving it on the kitchen table, and hoping for the best, but John might get suspicious.
“Thanks.” He spoke with a bit of uncertainty. Mrs. Hudson had been the only one who tried much to get a decent bit of food in him before all this. A stranger's kindness was not something he was accustomed to.
“Get him out of here.” Mycroft slurred, his shame lacing his tone. Sherlock made no move to do such a thing. He was taking in this mans reactions to everything. He limped into the room to get a closer look at the screens. With each step it seemed the tremble in his hand was lessening. Sherlock’s head tilted slightly to the side.
“Seen a lot of injuries, then. Violent deaths.”
“What if they don’t? The world is ending. How can we rely on some backup generators that may not have been tended to in years?” Anderson said with panic lacing his voice. Sherlock heard his chair slide against the wooden floor creating an agonizingly obnoxious screeching sound. Sherlock didn’t need to be able to see Anderson to know he was now standing and staring aimlessly around the room in an overly sassy and arrogant manor.
“Sherlock?” John asked again. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked towards the shorter man.
“I insist. We all fall on hard times.” She put her card in the device and swiftly paid before he could give further protest. She then handed the man his two bags.
“You forgot something.” Sherlock said and motioned towards the cane on the floor. He was trying to hide his small smile. This was no time for joy. John practically snorted as he walked back into the room and picked up the cane. He smiled a bit as he inspected the item in his hand before walking out without another word. There was a lot for him to process in just one day. There was a lot for all of them to process in just a single day.
“Can we stop with the pleasantries?!” Greg finally snapped out of his silent stupor.
“Graham will keep their focus towards him. Hopefully this gives us room to sneak up unheard from behind and thin out their numbers. With the three of us working together from both sides we should be able to manage.” Sherlock started, “With this rope we can tie one of them up and bring it into the mansion. That will give me time to observe and experiment.”
“Fine, but you are not going out like that.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow at her and she motioned for the three of them to follow her outside. They walked to where the group of cars had been parked and she popped the boot of her own. John let out a laugh that was a mix of both shock and relief.
“John? John Watson?” Mike seemed to be overwhelmed by a sense of nostalgia of better times, “It’s Mike Stamford. We trained at Bart’s together.” He elaborated at the momentary confusion on John’s face. So an army doctor, Sherlock noted.
“It’s all gone, Sherlock. Everything. I failed.” His brother slurred out not removing his head from his hands. He wondered if his brother was even able to lift his head at this point. Sherlock inspected his brother for a moment before hesitantly putting one of his hands on Mycroft’s shoulder. The sudden weight of this almost caused him to slip from the chair.
It was mid afternoon before Mycroft started stirring from his drunken sleep. His groans filled the silence of his office. Sherlock was pressed tight into the far corner of the room on the floor with his legs pulled up to his chest. His hands were steepled under his chin as he remained deep in thought. The happenings of the world around him didn’t even register, his consciousness was elsewhere. The papers from the files he had been looking at were scattered in a messy circle around his body, the glow from Mycroft’s open laptop in the centre of it all illuminated his pale skin making it look almost as if he were glowing.
“If it’s a virus then there must be a cure out there. Perhaps this can be contained.” Molly piped in, her eyes brimming with tears of fear. Mike was leaning against a wall silent trying to process the information they’d just recieved.
“Would you care to explain to me what is going on?” Mycroft said with his bloodshot eyes narrowed.
“What is left to be fixed? Take a look at these videos and tell me there is still something left to fight for.” Mycroft went to stand up but his knees buckled underneath his weight. He made some kind of noise that vaguely resemble words as he fell into Sherlock who with the help of John caught the man’s weight. Holding the weight of Mycroft, Sherlock looked over to John who without thinking before acting was helping hold the man from hitting the ground. The cane he had been relying on was laying in the floor and it seemed as if John hadn’t even registered it was missing.
“My brother let this happen and is currently hunched over a toilet with a hangover. I don’t hold high regard for his approval right now.” Mrs. Hudson glared and moved her body between Sherlock and the front door.
“He’s… uh..” Greg ran his palm across the back of his neck smearing some blood across it. There was no words good enough to explain what was about to walk through the door.
“John…” He strained out, “John!” This finally seemed to catch attention. John came around the wall he had been behind helping Greg with the gate control system.
“I brought you something to eat.” A hand clapped onto his shoulder and shook him a bit startling him from thought. Sherlock’s eyes blinked rapidly for a moment trying to regain his bearings before he took notice of the person who disturbed his trance. John Watson stood over him with a plate of four biscuits in his hand. “I took notice of how the chicken bugged you last night. I thought maybe this would suit your palate a bit more.” Sherlock scrunched his nose a bit at this gesture before taking the plate.
“Thanks.” Sherlock stated drily as he smoothed out his suit. His eyes ran up and down the army doctor stood next to him. The man had his arms crossed over his chest while he looked exasperated at Mycroft. Sherlock did not blame John for this fact. His brother was typically bothersome, but this was a whole new level for him.
“Oh Mrs. Hudson, you should know I am rather indestructible.” He smiled softly at her and rested his hands on her shoulders. She seemed to soften under his touch.
“Are you sure bringing a live one in is the best idea?”
“Get in!” It seemed enough to get his attention and he did not protest. He whacked the woman hard across the head causing her to stumble and made his way quick as possible to the car, his limp slowing him. The woman had started her pursuit again, but Mrs. Hudson tore off the moment the man got into the car.
“Where is my brother now?” Mycroft inquired.
“Well, yes.”
“Where do you suppose you’re going?” The grey haired man stood from the chair and walked to the entrance where Sherlock’s hand was on the front door.
“In here,” Sherlock answered from his chair.
An hour later, Sherlock texts to invite John over and finds himself feeling nervous. He wants to ask John to move back in but knows that a coat of new plaster won’t fix everything. Sherlock showers and dresses with particular care which makes him feel adolescent and foolish, but foregoes cologne.He convinces Mrs. Hudson to make those biscuits John likes and she brings them up on a tray with some hot tea. He’s estimated the approximate time John will arrive but as the seconds tick closer, Sherlock worries if perhaps he has miscalculated because of sentiment.
Sherlock looked down, his dark lashes veiling his verdigris eyes. The gesture was almost demure and John hated it.
“He’ll manage, I’m sure.” Mycroft assured, unconvincingly.
“I don’t want you to be lonely,” she finally blurts, and blushes, but at least she doesn’t stammer an apology. She’s really a remarkable woman, Sherlock admits to himself, more resilient than strong, but resilience is a strength in itself.
“I’d love some, yeah.”
“How did...? No, never mind, I don’t care,” Molly blustered, her cheeks growing even rosier, “This isn’t about me, Sherlock. It’s not good for you to keep yourself cooped up here like this, going days without speaking or seeing another person.”
“Well, yes, Rosie, but that’s …” John says, and squeezes his eyes shut. “You are the most important person in my life- and I don’t know if I can be what you need. . . I sure as hell know that I am much less than you deserve, but-knowing that - If for whatever reason you still want me, I’m…” John flails a bit here, hating how ineloquent he is, hoping desperately that Sherlock will fills in the blanks for him. But, Sherlock is at sea when it comes to all things emotional so John feels he needs to state it out right, “well, yours.”
“Yes, I does,” John says adamantly. “It absolutely does. You are the most important person in my life…”
It was almost a relief when the clouds that loomed heavily overhead finally burst, tearing him from his scattered and dismal thoughts. The relief was fleeting however, as Rosie woke with a start and wailed.
In a flash, his eyes take in all the information she’s radiating. He deduced that she had started dating someone a few months ago, but he sees in her demeanor and her concern for Sherlock’s sake that it’s become quite serious. Good for her, he thinks, and tries to appear more aloof than he’s currently feeling. He’s not so bitter yet that he can’t congratulate a friend on having finding love, even from his own unrequited hell. Still, he’ll miss the grim satisfaction that he’s not the only one. At least he still has Lestrade, who has had failed romance after failed romance since the divorce went through.
“Martha Hudson,” She said with a warm motherly smile, “You’re very welcome, young man. Just be sure to pay the kindness forward one day.” The man gave a nod and thanked her one more time before they had parted ways.
“Have a look, tell me what you see.” Sherlock side stepped leaving room for John to approach the desk. The shorter man’s fingers slide across the edge of the scans and lifted them up into the light. His dark blue eyes darted from scan to scan as he switched for all the varying stages of the virus. John then put all the scans down and closely read the reports and results of all the testings done on the blood, brain tissue, and spinal fluids. He seemed to be thinking rather hard trying to wrap his mind around what he was reading.
‘No time to explain. Get in your cars immediately. Do not stop for anything. Meet me at Mycroft’s place of residence. -SH’ following this he sent the address in a separate message. His heart was palpitating a bit and his hands were shaky. He received inquisitive looks from both Molly and Mike, but his gaze was fixed out of the tinted window. This place he loved so much was about to fall, and he had no idea why or to what.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock said dryly as he ascended the steps to where his brother was.
“Then what is it a time for?” Sherlock’s voice was thick with disgust. His eyes wandered over his brother making quick deductions. Mycroft was a posh man who took appearance quite seriously, but standing now his hair was in complete disarray, his posture was hunched in defeat, there were dark bags beneath his eyes, and his eyes were glassy and displayed clearly burst blood vessels. “This is serious..” Sherlock sighed out taking everything in rather fast. It was as if his very together brother had not slept in a week, perhaps not bathed in even longer. Even his suit was creased and had clear coffee stains on it from where his shaky hands had made a spill.
“Casualties of the bombs.” Mycroft’s hand reached out, clicked a few buttons, then one of the screens changed. Sherlock spun on his heel slightly to look at the screen. On it a sleek black car, obviously one Mycroft had sent for their parents, was stopped in an alarming amount of traffic. The clip was short lived as the screen was consumed in fire and then darkness. There was a lump in the back of Sherlock’s throat but he remained stoic. Not even the apocalypse would cause him to let the world see he wasn’t some machine like sociopath if he could control it. That was his armour, his protection. Sherlock was now inspecting his shoes as if they were the most interesting thing in the world. He didn’t know what to say to his brother, and even if he did Mycroft remained far too intoxicated for any of it to truly register. He had never seen his normally composed brother deteriorate into this state and it was disconcerting.
“Biological warfare. A crime network released a virus that overtakes the brain leaving only a shell of a person, a very aggressive one.” Sherlock tried to summarize to spare his brother from having to have this conversation all over again. Sherlock watched with a blank expression as everyone in the room started formulating rapid fire questions. The tension in the room was so strong it couldn’t even be cut with the sharpest blade. The sudden silence was cut by a loud ringing of Mycroft’s mobile. He winced and raised the offending item to his ear.
“There is work to be done and no other brains left to do it.” John had finally caught up to Sherlock with his own coat on. Sherlock smiled at this fact.
“I said I didn’t want any.” Sherlock said with annoyance. He couldn’t afford to have his senses dulled by alcohol. Not with what was happening in the world. “But if you feel the need to spend the rest of your life inebriated, by all means have my share.” Sherlock picked up his fork and had a spoonful of the rice on his plate. Between each bite of chicken he had to have a large sip of water to clear his palette. He would need to have a word with the kitchens about trying to compensate for the lack of food by drowning what was there in every spice they saw.
“Right, yes. Can someone explain what in God's name is going on?” John said turning away from Mike and looking Sherlock up and down quizzically.
Mycroft’s property was large and the walk to the gate was long but it gave Sherlock time to think. This was a dangerous mission, but one that needed to be taken. He didn’t know how far  they would have to go before they found one of the dead, it could be days before they could go back home. They were leaving from a safe haven with almost no supplies for a chance that with some experiments that maybe Sherlock would be able to what? Reverse the virus? Save the world? There wasn’t much left to save anymore.
“Donovan, Anderson, grab your coats.” His tone was forceful as he shoved his mobile back into his pocket.
“Nice day out, isn’t it?” Mike spoke not looking up from the laptop his thick fingers were furiously typing on. This was part of their typical interactions that Sherlock both despised and secretly cherished. Mike after all was one of the only people in Sherlock’s life who didn’t treat him like a vile excuse for a human.
“What is going on here?!” Mycroft yelled. Just as the words filled the room the dead man entered growling, Greg’s sweater stuffed in its mouth with Sherlock holding the rope following. A silence and horror overtook the room as everyone tried to process what was happening.
“When I instructed you to come at once I don’t believe I left much room from interpretation, yet here you are with two other.. people.” He said the word as if it were earwax in his mouth.
“It appears you have saved my yet again, Mrs. Hudson.” The man sounded exhausted and gasping. He seemed a bit terrified. She smiled awkwardly, a bit terrified herself.
There was a sudden crack and the power within the mansion died out. The room was plummeted into complete darkness and Sherlock could feel John Watson go stiff beside him. The sound of cutlery on plates stopped almost immediately and it was as if no one dared to even breathe, almost as if everyone aside from Sherlock was certain that any sound would ensure death,
The sound of Greg hitting the iron bars of the gate with his machete broke through the treeline, the sound of the grunts and screaming from the creatures following like some kind of song made from the purest depths of evil. Sherlock brought one of his long fingers to his lips and looked at John. John nodded in understanding and together the men creeped up behind the creatures. Sherlock hesitated as he walked up to one of the dead that was crawling towards him on the ground; it was obvious that this was no longer a human but part of him still held reservations about killing it. It still vaguely looked like a human, it was still moving, it was once a person. Sherlock looked at what remained of its outfit and body. Two gold rings on her left hand. Married. A mother he further deduced. There were clear indentations on the bridge of her nose and by her ears. She used to wear glasses. Her hair had been in a messy bun when she died. She looked no older than thirty-five. Her family was out there, maybe dead, maybe they were alive and wondering what became of her.
“Seems that way.” Sherlock moved to stand next to the man who was quite a bit shorter than him, he finally realized.
“I will not do a thing until you explain to me the reason for this.” Sherlock spat out in his frustration.
“Moriarty.” Sherlock said and watched how his brother tensed up.
“Mr. Holmes, there two cars at the gate. A Greg Lestrade and Martha Hudson here for Sherlock Holmes.” One of Mycroft’s personal guards interrupted the conversation.
“Christ!” Greg said just a bit too loudly. Two of the walking corpses turned to where the three men stood, their pale clouded eyes were bearing down on the men like they were an exquisite feast, and in a way they were. The two dead stood up and started charging at the gate. The bodies slammed against it hard and repeatedly. Sherlock took five huge steps backwards pulling Greg and John with him. The ripped up flesh that could barely be called arms reached out towards them as the creatures tried very hard to push through the iron rods that formed a hopefully unbreakable wall between them and the outside world. Blood was dripping from these things mouths, a few pieces of ripped flesh dangling from between their teeth. Their screeches were ear splitting and a thing of nightmares. Sherlock’s eyes were wide as he inspected these things. The commotion seemed to attract the other creatures as more started slamming into the gate with loud thuds. He could hear Greg throwing up from behind him. The smell was enough for Sherlock to want to do the same.
“I’m not a psychopath, Anderson, I’m a high functioning sociopath. Do your research.” Sherlock fired back.
“Do you need any help, young man?” She said in her chipper voice.
“Yeah?”
“I don’t need your permission. Just because you have given up doesn’t mean the rest of the world is ready to.” Sherlock tugged hard against the rope when the dead man made a lunge for John again. Mycroft, Sherlock, and everyone else in the entry area were moments away from getting into a screaming match when Molly walked into the room brandishing a steak knife. Her previously long hair was now cut into a short pixie cut. Her eyes were dark and determined. Before anyone could even react she plunged the knife deep into the dead man’s eye socket and removed it in a swift motion. The man fell to the ground with a loud thud.
“How is it spread? How do we protect ourselves?” Mike asked sinking to the floor.
“Oh I really can’t accept that. I’ll just have to come back another time.” The man seemed more embarrassed now than anything else.
“And I am terrified, Sherlock, because … sentiment.  I’m taking a huge risk here because I could have it all wrong and if I do- well, it would destroy me.”
“You seriously can’t think of any reason that talking to you might set him off?” Mary asked, but her tone now slightly concerned.
“But that’s not why he was behind- my guess is that he couldn’t be deigned to bother writing the cheque- you know how he gets; fits of ennui, spending days in his mind palace…”
“Pardon?”
“Translation: I am not interested in a romantic relationship.” His voice feels sharp.
As the two stepped out of the clinic to the waiting black car, Sherlock was already on his mobile, bypassing the unopened texts from John, and checking his email for a case. It was exactly the distraction he required.
John stared. He knew he shouldn’t but he couldn’t help it. He knew it was ridiculous, and maybe the exhaustion was partly to blame but he felt his eyes start burning as he watched his best friend, in bare feet, with his daughter’s drool spreading a dark patch on his gray tee shirt, offering him – what exactly? It was more than a change of clothes for Rosie. It was infinitely more.
Violet Holmes stared out her kitchen window at the fallow garden and considered what vegetable should go in this Spring. In her mind she could visualize the neat lines of peas and beans, cabbages and lettuces, and root vegetables. She could really be using the greenhouse, but  it needed repairs and to be cleaned out and she really didn’t have the energy for that. Perhaps she could add it to Siger’s to-do list. Keep him out of the house for  a while, to stop his endless puttering.  Violet poured herself a coffee and  took the washing up rag to wipe the counters. From across the room her mobile phone rang. She dried her hands on the nearest dish towel and hurried to answer. It was on the fourth ring by the time she had stabbed her finger at the answer icon on the screen.
“We’re going out tonight, I don’t know, maybe Greg or I could set you up with someone?”
“It won’t get any easier I’m afraid,” He admonished.
“He was angry at himself,” Mary says, “For things he doesn’t even understand, for things he didn’t say.”
“I’ve made a habit of lying to Mycroft, I’ve been trying to perfect it my whole life- even so, I don’t think he’s ever had a hard time discerning the truth. You- on the other hand…”
“You’ve reached Sherlock Holmes- leave a brief message. Don’t be boring.”
“You’re not keeping me,” John muttered, “What else?” he pressed.
“Oh.” Sherlock said, his tone carefully neutral.
Sherlock reappeared with a diaper bag in one hand and Rosie still clinging to his shirt on his hip.
“I see you, Sherlock Holmes, and I think it’s time we had a chat.”
“I don’t live entirely alone, Mrs. Hudson…”
“I don’t know what label to put on the tin, Sherlock,” John admits, and hears his friend quietly exhale next to him. “I mean, it’s not really something that I… what I mean to say is that I’ve never. “
Mycroft had hired a crew to help clean and repair the place, but Sherlock doesn’t trust them to set things back the way they ought to be, but he accepts their help for most of the grunt work and structural repairs. He’s never bothered to learn about construction, but Sherlock rolls up his shirt sleeves to help install the new dry wall, and even though the task is menial, he finds he doesn’t mind. There is something cathartic about being able to physically repair something. So engrossed in his task, he doesn’t notice the front door downstairs open and close or the steady, solid footsteps up the seventeen stairs. When he turns, flakes of plaster in his hair and looking decidedly rumpled, he sees John Watson standing quietly in the doorway, a few rolls of wallpaper in the crook of his elbow.
