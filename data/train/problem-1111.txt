), dragged into the mud of the general populace with quiet contemplation and a ramrod spine.
It should be clarified: I didn’t write this for anyone to read other than myself, and if anyone does stumble across this-- Well. I just hope you have the good sense not to publish it. The thing is, you see, I just couldn’t let everything die. Not everything. That would be too cruel.
Something heavy. Tying your feet to cold and slightly sticky linoleum. The kitchen is still screaming because no one is paying any of it any attention.
I can’t be sure. But-
In the June of 2030, we had bought a dog (whom Sherlock was insistent that we name ‘Gladstone’, for some unknown reason), and it was one day in October that we decided to take him to the coast. It wasn’t far from us, you see, and the poor dog had never laid eyes on the ocean. It’s not that we didn’t walk often - of course, most days we went through the fields where sometimes pockets of silence would hit you like a physical force and it’s all I could do not to crave London again, or sometimes we’d lose him on purpose in a meadow where the grass was too high and we’d pretend not to be able to find him, a chase of sorts, ending with Sherlock crashing his mouth into mine as we tumbled to the earth, seemingly drowning under all the grasses - but this one particular outing has nestled itself in my memory, grown roots that I just can’t seem to be able to shake. So I’ll write it down as I write everything down, no doubt with airs of romanticism, but documenting everything nonetheless. I don’t know why. Only I am going to read this, and I’m the only one with the weathered memory, but it seems important to record these things, somehow. Like I’d lose them if I didn’t.
This was us, once.
“We’ll have to buy a new bed.”
Look there’s no place to keep the mugs.
“No need to shout, John. I never promise. You know this.”
A teacher. A primary school teacher, envisage him. Tired around the eyes and hands which sometimes shake when writing on the board in ‘DRYERASABLEMARKER’ but feet which are always stable foundations, shoulder width apart, proud, pride, they are proud feet. Is that enough? Does that establish our protagonist?
“Well there’s a surprise.”
What does it matter?
“Yes, a lot of things have happened here. But a lot of things are going to happen here. It’s just a building, John. A building that we’re going to fill with our own happenings and, while they won’t override the old ones, they’ll take precedence for me. The now is more important.” He flashed a sly grin at me and swept away, his dressing gown trailing carelessly off his bare shoulder.
He had swallowed and made some sort of noise under me, rubbing himself against my leg. I always loved this, being completely in control of such a wild and powerful man. He was more strong-willed than the ocean and I could reduce him to nothing more than frantic sounds and animalistic writhing.
“Burn on,” You think. Or maybe you say it because the syllables resonate in your mind for a long time after, climbing even higher than the roar of the fire can. “Burn on and turn me to ashes.”
A flaw that, of course, you are now incapable of factoring in to your final decisions. You pressed a switch and the hands started roaming and with that momentum and new-found life and energy you started this thing. With constant noise and apathy it doesn’t stop - and won’t stop - until all the seconds and minutes and hours of an unknown duration have been consumed and all the doors have been shut.
Red-tailed Hawk.
“His eyes are (
“Why is that even a considering factor?” I had yelled back.
I’d given time to collect myself. “Alright, then. You
He leaves the room and goes upstairs. He goes upstairs to where the man most decidedly is not. The photograph remains on the desk-top and the man is smiling out at nothing in particular. He is not smiling although he was told to.
My mind.
The teaspoon in his left hand taps unapologetically against the work surface. It reminds you of a clock, like it’s keeping some sense of time but the scale is backwards. The air between your mouth and the skin on your hands is the same air that he is dancing in. Through this air and his clothes and his cells and his ribcage lies his heart. Steady and beating in that cage of flesh; beating much like the spoon is.
So he had turned and replied and disappeared and strode towards me and taken my chin in his palm and put on his coat and walked out of the house and pulled the curtains tightly shut and everything happened but of course, nothing happened really.
At the time, for these two – for these three – characters you’re yet to meet, it was open. Awash with winter sunshine (and later, summer sunshine), cold breath caught at the back of their throats, trapped, imprisoned with excitement. With newness. Eyes which would fly open every morning, one set at 6.15am at the call of an alarm, the other set intermittently, throughout the night, interrupted by imagined hypotheses and a somersault of thinking. Exhilaration and the prospect of the coming day eliciting snapping eyelids and sudden movements. One set of movements up, across, to the left, to a dressing gown, then more to the left, to the shower (too cold), eyes still open. One set of movements up, across to the right, to a mobile phone, more to the right, to a kettle, and then sporadically to unfiled sheets or exercise books, and even occasionally to the outside air.
-sometimes, you want me to panic.
And then finally, when his knees gave out, you would support him with your arms and lower him gently to the floor. He’d still be warm. Solid. Your own, personal, concrete foundation.
I don’t particularly know how to start this, so I’ll suppose I’ll just start here. I’ve always been a storyteller for the one, great Sherlock Holmes, but I think this is the most important story I’ve ever told. Our story.
Crowned Eagle.
In your mind, you let his hands fall but he doesn’t move. His wrists sit artlessly on your shoulders.
Pull on his strings.
They’re aren’t; you’ve already checked.
You won’t exist-
This?
I can see your eyes and they remind me of something hungry.
Time is not on your side. You have no more left to waste.
-and slowly fail to exist and see and be, yes.
“Killed.” You lick at your upper lip, nudge it into your mouth. Something outside is getting closer, pressing harder and harder against the glass, so you turn to look at it nonchalantly. Bleak skies. Make his head spin. Make yourself unreadable. “How many people have you killed?”
I pulled both of his wrists above his head, held them down with my body weight against the arm of the couch. His neck, I think, was my favourite part of him. Lithe and sculpted; the marble column supporting the most important part of all. I kissed it then, moving my mouth down it softly until I reached the base of it where I bit a harsh mark into the flesh, surprising him. He had gasped and arched in one fluid motion, his eyes had shuttered closed against the light.
There is nothing in particular to look at. To notice. The light covers you and tries to throttle you, landing heavily on your skin. You remind yourself it is dying. That it is a dying sort of light. It doesn’t seem to matter.
Flesh wound. Superficial. You’re not-

“I’m terribly sorry to disappoint you then, but I am firmly of the belief that the bed is far too ambitious a destination as of the current moment.”
“Bigger bed!” He winked at me as his head disappeared again.
You inhale.
We were padded in on most sides by an extraordinary wall of cushions, like an embrace within an embrace. Sherlock’s head was nestled in my lap, half of his impossible form stretched over my feet, which were curled up beside me. By all rights, it should have been awkward and uncomfortable but we fit like we did in every essence of life: simply and yet, in the sinews - the invisible sinews - of thoughts intertwined between our bodies, we were horridly, beautifully complex.
The air became grey and sometimes excruciatingly white.
A feather. A claw. A beaded eye.
“Oh,” You would say, and it would be more of a breath, more of an exhalation than a real word.
It’s unfair, this job I’ve been tasked with. Of recording. Firstly, it makes me a filter. An unfair filter. And even I, with all my remembered eyes, am partial to these events. You’ll get everything through me. You’re looking at me now, from your seat at the other side of the room. How strangely thrilling it is to think that I’m thinking of you and writing of you at this very moment and you aren’t aware of it. You’re still looking – stop it.
Your beloved,
This is a tale.
“You’re only fifty two!” I had argued. Naturally, his stubborn mind was set. Two months later and there we were, our feet making dulled sounds on the hardwood floors of the building that we’d grow to call ‘home’, arguing about kitchen appliances.
Then I had dipped my head, brushed my tongue lightly over the bud of his left nipple and - with my free hand - held his right one between my finger and thumb, rolling it slowly. After a while of this I’d suddenly pressed my tongue down flat, making him jolt as I drew my teeth forward to bite at the flesh, grazing it.
“i want to kiss you”
Sand, grit, enmeshed between my toes as prisoners which have never tasted the salt. Freshwater feet, buried in veins, not understanding the point of arteries. Why would anything want to leave that? Leave her? The sea – she - - I give her pronouns like the women who traverse her. This is a female landscape. I look up and look back and I’ve lost sight of the line and I’ve lost sight of the beach and my feet are sinking into the silt. I look around and realise for the first time that I am alone. Windowless.
Time deviated and became corrupt - as it tends to in dreams - and soon the light of dawn washed in through the gap in the badly-lined curtains, swimming between the rumpled sheets carved over our feet. In the early morning golden I saw your face, creaseless and at ease, mere centimeters from my own. I wanted to reach and to feel the softness of your closed eyelids, the warmth of your temple. But of course, I had no waking body to control.
“Right. I see. So tell me, what exactly did you
Establishing character is dull. Mundane. You already know the fundamentals so I’ll be brief – brief enough that I won’t get told off for stalling. Again.
He is out, now. Gone. Washed away into the city. You stand in the kitchen with your uncomfortably stiff spine.
(a longer pause. he drums the pads of his fingers against the armrest of his chair.)
“You. So I forget nothing about you.”
“Good.” Holmes said as he went a completely different direction as soon as they got inside. John took the cue and went the other way, going into closets and staff rooms when on one was looking, having his papers on him if he needed an excuse.
“They were each missing various organs – liver, left lung, appendix, and shockingly the frontal lobe. None of which were damaged by the acid.” Sherlock said. John now took the time to look at what was in the Petri dish under the microscope – it was a lump of some kind of flesh it seemed.
He huffed, running a gloved hand through his hair in irritation. “You’re not my mother!” He yelled, facing Watson fully now.
He decided he’d work on the murder for the day- to try to avoid arousing the suspicion of John, since he was quite good at picking up social cues, and any sort of personal behavior that Holmes thought he was much too good at mimicking to be found out. Turns out he wasn’t good enough for John though.
“Mrs. Hudson!” He yelled suddenly, just as John was about to stand. She came down in a hurry, wondering if there was a break-in or something. “I need the floor-plans for the flat.” Mrs. Hudson nodded, making John question once again how Mrs. Hudson was such a contradictory person – she was so sweet, and yet had so many things you would never expect.
“John, we’re hardly friends. We’re flat mates – we look at crimes together. You’re intelligent enough I can tolerate you – now come to the hospital.” Holmes said, leaving Watson taken aback. He refused and said that when he was dismissed he could come back. Then he hung up while Holmes started rage ranting.
He got back to the flat, walking in immediately and checking to see if he was there. Not a sign that he’d been back – kettle still idle on the stove and tea out of the cupboard, left on the counter untouched. He walked over and wondered how he could’ve left it half-finished. Surely it would’ve bothered him. Holmes would go to the length of even saying it would’ve “irked” him.
“Sherlock? Where are you?” Watson asked loudly, looking in all the rooms once more – he hadn’t thought to check the bathroom though. He knocked on the door. “Sherlock, you in there?” He asked, tapping the door again with his knuckles.
“What about?” John asked, glancing toward her, double taking as she was looking down at her twiddling thumbs nervously. “What about, Molly?” He repeated, facing her fully now.
“Why did you get out of bed? You could hear it from your room.” Sherlock said, staring into his tea as his body moved sluggishly, but his mind clearly didn’t.
Holmes frowned, tilting his head. “Is that my name?”
“Are you inviting me to sit with you?”
“Well if the guy is so smart maybe it’s classmate – maybe these are all the people who were better than him.” John shrugged, having no incentive to make tea as he knew Holmes would soon dart toward the door.
“How so?”
“Are you serious?” He asked, coughing again. He realized this was his answer and put it on, knowing Sherlock wanted to talk to him if he gave him a way to stay in the room a tad longer.
“You’re interfering with my concentration on the case – tell me if something’s bothering you.” He said, sounding hardly compassionate or empathetic.
“Honestly, John! You’re not my
“I thought you’d have left and come back without me – you’d already have the details.” John said, frowning at his estranged flat mate.
“I don’t think so.” John said, picking up a newspaper and clearing his throat, starting to read over it. Holmes stared for another moment, and then continued his frantic, thoughtful pacing.
“None?” Holmes asked, turning to him briefly before bursting out the door. “Taxi!” He called, throwing his arm up in the air as John followed him quickly, pulling his shoe around his heel as he did so.
“Is it?” Holmes asked, laying back down on the couch on his back, steepling his fingers under his chin.
John was ready to lose his mind. “I’m glad you’re being considerate now,” He started, his tone already agitated, making Holmes turn on his heel to face him; “but this is ridiculous. I want to know about the case, I want to help if I can, and you’re not telling me anything – and you’re asking about how I’m feeling.” He said, waving his arms about like Holmes usually did. “I just want my old flat mate back.”
They pulled in, John getting out just after Holmes. Holmes walked toward the building, John on his heels – with much less effort than usual. Holmes was in a casual stroll, his feet laying smoothly across the concrete with each step. What happened to him?
It’s a massive game of hide and seek. How are you to know, however, who is counting in a room full of so many people? If the counter was not pointed out to you, then how are you to know whom it is? You must find where he is, and if not that, then follow where he’d been by following his path of destruction without getting in front of it – hearing the cries of people being found, asking them questions if you can but most likely they won’t tell you anything. Then you continue, hoping to find a pattern so you may be able to find the perfect spot that they’ll get stuck. Then you win.
Sherlock’s heart monitor was beeping slowly – Watson fantasized it was because of the lack of nicotine patches. But he knew it was because his heart was giving out ever so slowly – Sherlock’s breathing was hardly normal. It was slow and shallow, then quick, then suddenly deep – as if he were smelling something – and then back to slow.
“So, who was it? Who was it, John, was it his
“Well… it’s just…” She said, biting her lip and looking at the door to make sure Holmes wasn’t coming back. “He… he came asking about you and how to make you feel better. He said you were off – irritable and such… he was worried.”
“Sherlock, I don’t care about anyone more than you!” He yelled, pausing when this statement made Sherlock stop in his tracks, his eyes falling to the side slightly to stare at the wall blankly. His hands were up in a cupboard above his head, and his body seemed stiff. “I mean, I wouldn’t expect you to hurt anyone purposefully – not too badly anyway… But you will hurt yourself, and I don’t want you to. You’re my best friend.”
Sherlock refused to answer any of Lestrade’s questions, but as soon as John and him got into a cab and Lestrade was gone he started talking.
As it turned out, Sherlock was up all night trying to figure out what about that song had made Watson give that reaction. Especially since a moment before he had been so irritable about his violin playing.
“Seven days, four victims, it’s the only thing that adds up – one tomorrow, one on Monday, one on Wednesday, and one on Friday the thirteenth.” He said, as if trying to drill this in – as if he kept forgetting. John knew this wasn’t true, but that’s what it was sounding like. It was obsessive.
“Sherlock? Worried? For me?” John asked sarcastically, letting out a laugh until he realized Molly was serious. “You’re serious?”
“Why?”
“Right…” He said, nodding. “But don’t you think we should explore-”
The tea was steeped and set aside, hardly appreciated for what it was. John sipped it once too hot, and let it get cold. Sherlock stared at it as steam curled over the lip – fast at first, then slowly until it stopped.
Holmes did not play the violin that night. He sat outside of John’s room, listening to him toss and turn and breathe heavily at constant intervals. Holmes knew that he often suffered from night terrors after a long day – increasingly so after Holmes’ incident.
The sarcasm was returning, but only as self-preservation it seemed. Holmes crossed his legs, staring at the ground as his shoulders tensed. John sighed, pulling his jacket on, tired of this. “I’m going out for a bit, okay?” John asked. Holmes immediately relaxed.
“Of what?” Watson asked, his expression remaining static.
“Different blood types are just different enough that if you end up with the wrong kind in you you could get very sick or die – I have two ideas. He’s either collecting it to put in his acid or he’s testing his acid on these blood types – maybe they had different iron levels too, that could affect his acid – maybe he got into their medical records and – oh, oh – this one is clever, this one has been planning this for years!”
There wasn’t.
“Yes, I know, I saw him, met him, he almost killed me, go on.” Sherlock said, gesturing. His voice was still tender – from his throat, and because he was glad to see John again. And how happy he clearly was to see Sherlock awake again.
“I’ve decided this man is mad.” Holmes said, making John snort.
“I’ll keep today’s murder in mind to try to remember it well – in case a connecting event comes to light.” Sherlock said, focusing solely on his work now. Watson nodded, leaving the room to see the sky had fallen dark and the stars twinkled around the clouds – he hadn’t noticed on the way back from the store, but it had definitely been dark for a while. He wandered up to his room, calling out a “
“Right, so no pin-point there.” John sighed. “There’s no pin-points anywhere. Are we sure it’s even a doctor?”
John shivered in his chair, rubbing his temples as Holmes paid no mind and continued his thinking, pacing, and steepling. “You feeling alright, John?” Holmes suddenly asked, John realizing he’d stopped pacing to stare at John.
“Everyone’s wrong sometimes.” John said, and when Sherlock scoffed his face dropped. “Sherlock.” He said, waiting until Sherlock looked at him, and then waited a little more. “Everyone’s wrong sometimes.” He said firmly, leaning his elbows on his knees. “Even you. Even me.”
“Eight,” Lestrade said, frowning at John as John couldn’t help but look towards Holmes as his face lit up.
“It was test. I knew you wouldn’t like it so I went out without you, then hid my face upon coming inside, hoping you’d go to bed before I got bored out of my
Watson rolled his eyes, having Sherlock remove the peas after a couple minutes so he could assess the cuts. Only one was bad enough to do anything about. He grabbed some medical tape and gauze, gently attaching it to his cheek.
“Sherlock!” Watson called out as Sherlock slumped to the floor in a bloody heap.
“Medical records – all of the patients that have reached sudden critical condition had blood type O – the rarest of them all. They were shipped off to a specialized doctoring unit somewhere else – specializing in bowel malfunctions primarily.”
John came out from the washroom and insisted Holmes go clean up a bit – he looked horrendous – and he did so. He came out a new man, refocused and ready to go with John at his side again. He could concentrate – he knew what he was doing. He was going to go check out doctors – not John, he’s a doctor, but not – go ask doctors some questions, and… not John. The doctors that work at the hospital.
“No clue. He didn’t say, just said he wouldn’t be long.” John sighed, stepping out into the horrendous weather and getting into a cab. “I’m coming to the station – start gathering people to look for him. He’s got himself into trouble and I know it.”
“Stopped in to see Lestrade and then Molly… I just told you that. Is something wrong?” He said, frowning at John.
Please let the moon that shines on me
He came out of his room disheveled, not having gotten dressed that day, or changed into pajamas the night before. His hair was but matted curls and his eyes were dark, bloodshot, and swollen from lack of sleep.
Then he saw him. “Oh my god.” He whispered to himself, running to the figure on the ground, just a pile of trench coat and blood. “Sherlock, Sherlock, look at me.” He said, taking his pulse. His heart was beating, but slowly, and his breathing was fast and shallow. His eyes hardly opened upon hearing his name.
Sherlock returned two hours later with his eye considerably more swollen once more – the bruising had gone down but the swelling had returned. John just stared at him, then got up to get some frozen peas. He handed them to Sherlock, who was busy looking through a microscope and wouldn’t take them. John rolled his eyes, holding the frozen peas to Sherlock’s swollen face.
people are so bland - no offense.” He said, glancing at John as he got a glare shot at him. He cleared his throat, then continued; “The injection was placed here to create problems in the bowels, causing the diminishing of the interior walls of the digestive tract – hence why this one is red, because the skin is irritated from the leaking bowels.” He said, a smile still stuck on his face.
When John comes back. Holmes’s mind whirred at the thought – why wouldn’t he come back? So far both Molly and Mrs. Hudson have made a hint as to him not returning for some unspoken reason. Holmes sat on the couch and stewed as before, all thoughts of the case temporarily forgotten in his childish ignorance. He’d simply hurt John’s feelings, but he hardly knew he’d done such a thing.
But of course, that didn’t mean it wasn’t played. Sherlock had heard Watson tossing and turning in the night.
“What is it?” Lestrade asked, making Holmes look at him with an absolutely dumbfounded face.
“Sherlock?” A voice called from down the hallway, followed by stiff and decently-paced heel clicks. “Sherlock, is that you?” Mrs. Hudson appeared in the kitchen, giving Holmes a look at the sight of him – she hadn’t seen him with a bruised-up face yet. She took a good look, then asked how he’d done it. He brushed her off.
“Why do you enjoy remembering to be ill? Being ill is the worst thing to remember, I don’t understand. You’re not making any sense.” Sherlock complained, placing down his tea to start pacing back and forth, his hands folded beneath his chin as his eyes darted around. “John, I don’t understand!” He cried when nothing added up even though he was walking now.
He caught a cab over and went in for the run-over from Molly. Seven puncture wounds for the seventh victim – the middle-point. Molly slipped in a “how are you and John?” that Holmes ignored extremely effectively. As he was walking out she stopped him, standing between him in the door, making him pause. He stared down at her as her eyes locked on the table just behind him.
“I’d doubt that. That’d be tremendously unavailing.” Sherlock mumbled, then added; “And ambitious. That’d be quite a development of events – do you think that’s really what’s happening?” Sherlock asked, turning his attention to Watson fully for more than a few seconds, not watching his hands as he continued to fiddle with whatever it was he was making.
John stayed with his friend for two nights, heard about the next murder, and immediately said he’d have to cut it short and went to see Holmes at the morgue with Lestrade and Molly. Molly had everything typed out, but not having sent it through yet as Holmes wanted to look at the body.
There was a silence for quite a while. Dusk approached fast, the sky turning a murky tomato-esk colour, and Holmes hadn’t snapped out of his strange behaviour. John didn’t know what to do – or if there was anything to be done.
“Not in the mood?” John asked, almost laughing at the idea. “What kind of moods do you have? You hardly seem any different – kind of mopey, maybe, but… well, we have groceries, will you eat?” John asked, raising his eyebrows as he stood.
“Have you got a lead? A motive?” John asked, sitting in his chair, craving tea but not wanting to finish it with so many questions. “This case is buggered – it’s taken so long. Isn’t it bothering you.”
“So now that he’s learned that it caused irritation to the skin he would’ve perfected it – his real victim would have a miniscule puncture wound on the stomach and deteriorating bowels – slightly faster than normal after death.” Sherlock started ranting, his tongue moving hardly slow enough for Watson to understand.
“What if it is the same guy just trying to piss you off?” Watson asked, making Sherlock pause for a moment before he quickly resumed his precise, bustling movements.
“I thought you might like to accompany me. Shall we?” He repeated, thrusting the jacket toward him again.
Your hips are still snapping tightly as you uncoil, but now the noise is all gone and hidden away and everybody is holding his breath. In this moment of sheer idiotic complacency, you begin the slow destruction of yourselves.

“Bored, yes. I know. I can tell.” I had walked through at this point, forgetting to watch my feet as they strode across the sanded floorboards between the kitchen. Heavy footsteps have never seemed so light.
Much to the primary school teacher’s horror, the title ‘Sandy-O’ could be described as doing nothing other than sticking. Sticking, mockingly, sticking, in irony, sticking, in name, status, sticking to the soles of his shoes like something sticky and wholly unpleasant to have stuck to the sole of ones shoes and then, after all this, one day – stuck. Sandy-O. Hideous.

I feel, therefore, it’s only fair that these last eight-or-so years are recorded too, perhaps before I get too old to remember them to any significant degree of detail, or perhaps because paper tends to remember far longer than any human being could.

After that he had merely sighed distractedly into my mouth, drew me closer to him. It was only when we heard Greg laughing nervously in the kitchen doorway that we pulled apart sheepishly, his hand still curled possessively around my hip.
Your eyes fly open and you’re taking in too much air in too short a space of time and yes, there’s the ceiling and there’s the kitchen but he’s not in it so this isn’t right, this isn’t the correct place. Eyes wide, seeing nothing, submerge yourself again.

I remember the sloping dune, rolling carefully onto the sands and dotted sparsely with sharp plants, the sensation of damp and cold sand stinging the skin on my face. I can remember the shape of it, but I can’t remember walking down it, called by the crashing of the smaller waves rather than the bigger ones. What I do remember, however, is walking across the beach - forwards, always forwards - with our wellies sinking ever so slightly into the sand where small rivulets of water sprinted to the ocean under the ground. We were so small then, standing just on the precipice of everything, watching the moon play games with the water.

You know that with this dishevelment of inconsistent life, despite all of it’s apparent perfection, there would be no John Watson left at the end of it.

The hardwood floor is cold against the soles of your feet as you sit, counting seconds.
I don’t honestly recall much of the day after that, nor the evening. We had both agreed that, to each other, the future and the house and ourselves were the only presents we really wanted, and the move had kept us so occupied that we’d both forgotten about gifts until the night before, anyway. During dinner we talked as old friends tend to talk at Christmas, reminiscing Decembers gone past and recalling the moments everyone lived through with younger bones.

A swift flick out of the corner of his eye, but I know he sees me. Sees my blank face, sees me seeing him as one might see rain pelting sideways away from the ocean, or perhaps a person completely inverting themselves while growing younger rather than aging. It’s like watching something destroy themselves in front of you and not knowing how, if not to fix things, to at least make the destruction stop.
Let me tell you. For the love of God, let me.

But it’s okay, you realise, because he doesn’t even understand.
John picks up the remote. Two and a half seconds later the room falls quiet, interspersed by the sweeping undertone of moving traffic in the rain.

“What are you doing?” He had asked, taking residence of the armchair to my left.
You have never wanted to know anyone so intimately and you are very, very afraid.
I had stood on his left side as his eyes swept past me to focus on the blue above us. “Yes, I must know the exact figure, Sherlock. God only knows what I’ve eaten--”
Because there is nothing about you that I cannot identify within myself. I cannot ‘deduce’ myself - as you so eloquently put it - because I would be inevitably biased, regardless of how highly I regard my own judgement of others.
The sensation of this pseudo-chokehold somehow makes his pupils bloat even larger and his mouth begins to go soft but this is just a fad, you tell yourself, it’s just a game to him. In his ignorance-- His ignorance-- It’s no longer beautiful but instead, it tastes of relief.
It was only a case, I think desperately. An anticlimax, you’d think it would be saving me or saving himself or saving the world but it was one addict with one gun and four bullets inside the one gun and two arms and one fingertip and there, you see. That’s where it happened, that’s when the whole planet came crashing downwards. Not in our kitchen and not with the tea and the light washing through him like hessian or spider webs but I didn’t write that entry down so it had to write itself, do you understand? November sunshine streaming through the gaps where he bled from and he hasn’t noticed, poor thing. He hasn’t noticed and I won’t move I just turn and shut my eyes and give him up for a lost cause and he- well, you know what happens now. He’s so oblivious, immobile, warmed by the gentle steam and - quietly fading. Quietly fading as he looks out of the window at the birds.
We both stood there, facing towards the turbulent waters, for what seemed like the longest time. I can’t remember us saying anything and if we did, it wasn’t much. I think we were always somehow more content in our silences than we were in our speech.
He’s still staring at the floor where it used to be.
) is led more by his eyes then any quirk of the mouth, but there is a solitary indentation on the left side of his face due to (
By the time you’ve crossed the threshold into the hall you realise that your dressing gown remains pooled sadly at the foot of your bed. It would be cowardice - or inefficient, so incredibly inefficient - to return for it now. But you feel yourself in an almost overwhelming state of undress. It’s improper. It’s slightly rude to waltz shirtless into a kitchen at eight in the morning where eggs are being prepared.
I want to hold you to me forever, so tightly that neither you nor I shall be able to let go.
Your hands are still on his warm abdomen but your mind is gone, past the fluorescent shaft of artificially urban light and past and above and somewhere entirely surreal (but not quite).
I had leant over him then, placing one knee between his spread thighs. After easing myself down - slowly, slowly; I was going to take my time - I’d breathed hard and hot into his left ear, “I should probably make myself explicit: I am going to fuck you. Right. Here.”
One of your favourites only had a duration of a few seconds but you play it and replay it until you can recall it perfectly.
“But what about the descriptions?” You’re grinning at me. Cheshire cat. You know. “I need to know what he looks like so I can picture him properly. You know. In the tale.”
“why can nobody move
He doesn’t look at you. His feet are turned towards you. Subliminal, but telling. “Out.”
He thinks of the man asleep upstairs. It is the same man in the photograph. This man is not really upstairs but he was.
Prove what, exactly?
He turned to stride purposefully away but just before he tore his eyes from mine, he hesitated, stopped with one palm holding him steady against the doorframe. “You’re aroused.” He had pointed out.
Because that’s ultimately what we were, what we all are without the general togetherness of things: pieces of people joining and threading themselves amongst each other to make something whole. And then the tide comes in, washes it all away again, forces us to restart the process anew.
“A dishwasher. We’ll need to get a dishwasher.” Sherlock motioned somewhat vaguely behind him before launching himself into the middle of the floor. “And here- here let’s put an island (we won’t need a table, naturally, because we have a dining room now entirely for that purpose, how liberating, John!). An island where I can hang a light above it so I can see and maybe even some small drawers to keep my slides - oh, how excellent, there’s a plug socket right here for the microscope - and we--”
And your conversational readiness.
His lips had parted to breathe out a silent, “Oh,” and I imagined I could taste it.
There is no definitive proof against the notion. But he doesn’t love me.
I don’t like what you’re implying.
“Yes?” It’s sudden, hidden behind my (rather convincing) facade of ignorance. Like he surprised me. Like I wasn’t expecting his direct address.
Did I?
Up. Stretch. A crick in your shoulders - at the top of your spine - which won’t dissipate. It just sits, malignantly, weighing down your strides. Maybe it’s the way you were sleeping. Maybe, you think, there’s something heavy swinging from a rope around your neck.
Two: Repeats itself-
Poorly.
At this point, I’d moved back up again to smash my lips into his, to breathe roughly into his mouth, against his tongue, to leave him reeling. I remember now, I wanted him undone. Running my free hand down his chest, I had plucked at the T-shirt twisted carelessly across his body. “You do know you have your own pyjamas, right?” I had pulled back slightly but the line of his eyes never left my mouth.
He exhales loudly through his nose. “As if. When will they even begin to consider leaving us alone for two bloody minutes?”
Let me hold you, he had said. I can’t breathe:
“So I don’t forget you.”
Perhaps, yes.
“You’re different. You’ve always been different and I’ve known that, but somehow, for some inexplicable reason, some time around last november I woke up to this fact.”
) age. His only immediately identifiable ‘tell’ is a slight, unnecessary cough when nervous.”
Four: I can’t ever stop the song from gushing out.
Ultimately, there is a flaw.
Press his buttons. Pull his strings. Dance him into the palm of your hand, into the space between your incisors. Resist the urge to bite.
) 1.69 metres. He sleeps naked between May and September. [...] Commonly chosen attire: (
Sherlock’s parents had left the little cottage in Sussex to him, and he - unsurprisingly - had neglected to mention this to me until he announced completely unprecedented - one fine day in June - that he was going to retire. And that, of course, I should retire alongside him.
He’d said I’ve been here before and we hired a boat.
“Nothing taps like I do.” I smile. I don’t mention how most of the fevered tapping has been on my abused backspace key. Clumsy digits.
“Me?”
How would you know?
You won’t. Not here.
Hands that could be yours cover up the broken skin. The thumbs press inwards. Tighter and tighter.
He’d said It’s four o’clock in the morning come upstairs to bed.
Silence, and this time it drags, like it’s leaving slurred footprints in the mud on the mantlepiece. A different type of urgency that you resist for the falsehood of this atmosphere. This is of your creation.
Motionless. Your hands are braced on the table behind you and you don’t know how they got there.
It’s like a butterfly in a bell jar or ankles in handcuffs or a tiger in a cage made of chicken wire or your heart under your rib cage or a hand in somebody else’s hand.
My con-ver-sat-ional-read-i-ness.
So soft and so warm against my skin.
Nobody moves. The clock on the mantlepiece makes almost drunken noises and the only sound is clear but muffled slightly through the glass: the sound of London, our city, the sound of traffic and of life so vibrant it chokes me and of people. People buying last minute pints of milk on their way home; people 17,000 miles apart talking and laughing; people crying; people falling in love.
“i know i’m
Come upstairs,,,,,
We had remained there for longer than I can remember, just basking in the scent of ourselves and the lazy sound of the birds outside. For that moment, content.
There’s a sliver of light being forced between the curtains by a streetlamp outside. It burns with a kind of orange sincerity as it brushes over your skin, revealing nothing.
Or raw wire.
His eyes wouldn’t leave yours the entire time. Would he panic? Would he lie complacent? His eyes, half-mast and as soft as they are now. You want to destroy him so infinitely and so beautifully, to unravel him completely in the most extensive and purest of ways. To watch the light trickle out of his eyes as he - the man - is slowly extinguished, not at all in the manner of a phosphorescent orange being subverted by the sun but instead, replaced by a very particular kind of black.
You are in the living room. Perched. Perched on the back of your chair like a bird of prey.
Come upstairs it’s four o’clock
Three steps, maybe three and a half, four. You’re there. Finally the waves crest and bow and the harbour wall shatters and you press your body against the line of his back.
We must have stopped, pulled up the car, opened the doors to receive that initial shock of blustering air that tends to greet everyone near the sea in Autumn, set our feet on the ground. We must have done all of the conventional things one does upon arrival of most places, but I don’t remember it. I don’t even recall if it was Sherlock or myself driving. Probably Sherlock, come to think of it. No, all I remember is the colour of the sea set against the sky, the gradients of an ever-changing dye merging into one fine strip across our horizon, a chromatism that was like an oil spill in its lights and darks, except with only grey.
This strikes you as you wake, the thought burned into the base of your skull. It throbs as you lie there.
John is staring at a corpse and you are staring at him, at the back of his neck, at his hands, wandering through the air.
Another night; another moment; you’re trapped in both of your flaws.
i want
The line is yellow, then golden, then tearing at the seams as if the flesh wants to rupture completely apart. You follow it with your tongue. Soft stripes, soft stripes.
A few steps forward. Hesitant, now. You seem to have lost that driving force which possessed you in the hallway. Somewhere an engine is ticking over. Steam rising into the frost-ladened air, like a condensing breath which follows some sort of shout that no one could possibly have heard.
“-and the different ways you prefer your toast, and the exact intonation of your voice when you’re confused but you’re trying to mask it, and likelihood of you choosing particular channels when you turn on the television in percentages in descending order, and-- You get the gist, I’m sure.”
You take his body and turn him. His back must be digging uncomfortably into the work surface but he doesn’t say anything. He is confused and his eyes keep flicking into yours between resting on the floor or your left shoulder or your mouth, and he - beautifully - doesn’t protest. He doesn’t resist.
So he had turned and replied and disappeared and strode towards you and taken your chin in his palm and put on his coat and walked out of the house and pulled the curtains tightly shut and everything happened but of course, nothing happened really.
Now necessity and flame and yours yours yours. You breathe hot and sudden into his right ear and he stiffens against you. Both of you fit. His pyjama bottoms are too long and the hem rests stubbornly under his heel. Your hands curl over his hips, his abdomen. His hair is flat on one side and his left eye is bloodshot. You can hear his breathing stutter and hitch and slip. He is precisely 0.14 metres shorter than you.
This applies to everyone.

He had glared slightly but he knew I could see the soft edges around his mouth, his eyes. There was one rebellious curl jutting out at an impossible angle, gone awry, rebelling. The yellow wash from the lights gave him an almost-halo: the universe’s most disobedient angel. I wanted to touch his hair.
But you see, if I said just one word - just one - all of the butterflies inside my chest that make a habit of stringing sentences together (which I’m not allowed to ever express) would come pouring out of my mouth like water--
I suppose--
Stop it.
Somewhere, once, I am vulnerable and I think you are, too.
Slow. Pause. Give yourself time to think. To school every surface cell into taking on the shape of someone better, someone who he believes you to be.
You’re so warm.
PopperAlexander - I hope you don't mind me shoving this down your throat so much! I tried to take your advice and construct a second-person narrative that was more explicitly internalised, but it just didn't fit as well as I'd want it to and sounded sort of.. forced, really. So, in a bid to increase the intimacy, I just went 'fuck it' and changed it to first-person. Was curious as to how you (and anyone else who happens to stumble across this as well, I suppose) feel about this? Again, I am forever grateful for your continued support :) x
“Dull,” He had exhaled before curving his spine off the cushions so his torso pressed starkly against mine.
His eyes slide up to meet yours, then down again. He finishes his sentence - slowly. He types - slowly. He sleeps - slowly. He lives - slowly. The keys remind you of the kind of rain which follows a thunderstorm.
You don’t repeat yourself, but you make the exception.
It was in July of the same year that I had opened the fridge, only to find - to my abject horror on account of Sherlock’s absolute oath that he would oh-so-definitely-not-be-ever-touching-dead-things-again - exactly one head, three fingers from three different left hands, one third of a tongue and fourteen-point-five toenails. Oh, and at the back I discovered a (very poorly hidden) liver some three days later. I had notably, until this exact moment in time, been pleasantly surprised with Sherlock’s adherence to this particular promise and had enjoyed immensely consuming, say, some mango chutney left over from the Indian the night before without being in fear of my life.
There were some initial issues regarding the placement of the bedrooms, squabbles which I look back upon with fondness now, and whether we should have taken the ensuite or not.
My mind.
) a fascinating anticlimax. Aging and slowly dying (
John is underneath you and your elbows and your knees are growing raw from the bedsheets. Neither of you are saying anything but everything is somehow too loud and too compressed into the pocket of air between your mouths.
It wasn’t long after that I let the gentle hum of the distant, electronic voices fade into an almost-music as I watched his face. I knew he wasn’t asleep and he knew I was watching his face, so vulnerable and deceptively young when relaxed, like nothing had hardly happened to either of us at all. New men; that’s what we saw ourselves as then. I kept one hand stubbornly fixed on his skull, moving less like a hand and more like how the sea breathes sometimes, when it’s seen the sun and is wiped clean by the navy-swathed arrival of the moon. I suppose some part of me believed that my hand was holding him, his everything - because it was, under the hair and the bone it truly was his everything - like a shield might hold another rib in place for ten extra minutes or how the atmosphere forever hanging (like a version of a forever) over us, making sure nothing ever escapes. In that moment, I realised that I wanted to learn and relearn every single passage of his mind, complex or otherwise, and to walk the hallways of his thinking in a place where time doesn’t exactly exist in the conventional way. That hand - my right hand - with it, I began to walk.
-so untouched, so-- virgin?
Everything is out of place and running too fast like a loop of string tied in knots and threaded between someone’s fingers.
Two men, standing among shafts of sunlight, dust motes around their feet. Bringing something untouched, something old to life. Writing just another chapter, filling it with furniture.
Soon the light changed. Golden to white to fluorescent blue. If I closed my eyes far enough I could see the outlines of our skeletons, sedentary and rotting. Our bed became a stainless steel table and our hands barely touched. It was this moment that I realised that we are the dying, we are the already dead, I can’t let him float so far away from my skin, I can’t let him, I can’t let him, I can’t let
He had kissed me strong and slowly - with a certain intensity yet without the furious speed that enthusiasm usually incited in him - drawing my body close to his body so that we moved like water, like we didn’t have edges between us at all. An indefinite time later he’d led us into bed, warm and our bellies pleasantly full. We savoured the moments of that night, like we weren’t in a rush. Like we had the rest of our lives.
So you walk purposefully, one stride, two strides. You take him by the shoulders and grapple at his wrists. His back is against the broken plaster and his hands are draining to the colour of colder roses where they are forced above his head. It must hurt, it must hurt; he remains compliant.
(the flat dims and twists and expectorates him out again so that he is - that you are - alone. the darkness soaks everything in basalt and the bare floorboards are textured against the soles of your feet.)
Holding us both in one fist with Sherlock’s heel digging into my lower back, I had murmured, “Is this okay?” He had only been able to nod frantically so I begun to rock forwards, backwards, forwards.
Christmas itself was significantly more lively, and Sherlock became increasingly exasperated by the mere mention of decorations. Mostly because, I think, he was humiliatingly defeated by them.
It heavier, it gets heavier, a dead weight. The weight of a dead thing. Tied around your neck. All the things you could do or you have done or you will do. All your regrets and all the things you will regret.
Of course, the picture of domestic bliss that I’m painting is far from accurate. Especially not with one Sherlock Holmes constituting half of our relationship and a short-tempered army doctor making up the other 50%.
“Not dead people, per se,” His voice had been muffled slightly and I’d followed it out of the open French windows into the garden. I’d found him lying flat on his back, precisely in the middle of the lawn. “Only parts of dead people.” A pause. “And a meagre two days, if you must know the exact figure.”
Look this is where we will build our lives together
Why? They won’t let me.
Then our mouths meet. I’m craning my neck and it’s too wet at first and we’re both uncomfortable but it doesn’t matter. Here, he says more than he could ever say with his vocabulary. I’m unsure how long we stand there for, nearly motionless and pressed together like we wanted to drown, like softened and finespun dancers in the evening light.
-sometimes I want you to panic.
While I sit here and destroy-
Are you mocking me?
Am I bleeding yet?
He’d said You’re impossible and in the same breath some four years later he’d said Let me take you to Scotland.
) in the weak sunshine, you considered him (
You shift to the side and lie alongside him. The shared eye contact you exchange is one of understanding when you know that you’re both speaking different languages. He looks at you with recovered confidence, now self-assured and comfortable. In some seconds you think he’s saying: “I’m sorry.”
“Yes. Yes we have. No times of which, however, were we discussing this particular fridge in this particular house during this particular retirement. You promised--”
I can.
It’s later and you’ve learned to control your instincts, to tamp down the slight heady sensation of sickness in the pit of your bowels when you imagine stringing his sinews together and wearing him like a bloody token, or when you imagine what his pulse might taste like when it’s soaring with the adrenaline of being forced down by your hands.
You can have your bees, He’d said. Look in this corner we could grow rhododendrons.
) he was sitting at the kitchen table, his head turned so that his absent gaze fell upon some indefinable image (
“Naked,” He had gritted out the command as he’d pulled away before moving towards me again, but I held back.
“Yes.” Well, I could hardly disagree.
I’m sorry. I should introduce myself. I am omniscient in this piece of work. An overseer, someone who now – at the end of the rope – has seeing eyes which communicate with a telling mouth. A keyboard, I should say. It would be unfair to compartmentalise this into a medium for which it is not fit. There are parts of myself to be discovered and recorded; the story would have gaps in if I didn’t plug them up with bits of me. But for now. I am omniscient.
-but only when you no longer exist.
There is no such thing as a
You press your fingertips together just above your lips - in what some might say is a mockery of prayer - and say nothing. Something advances but it is in your peripheral vision.
“You’ve been at this for half an hour,” You say, crossing the room. “Tapping feverishly like a- a-,”
So complacent, so--
I love you. He remembers it and it didn’t matter all that much because he already knew there were no right moments and no right words and no right people.
He stands up, presses the laptop lid shut, spins and leaves you perched on the back of your chair, staring into the floorboards.
I’ll always be here Come upstairs Come upstairs to bed
“Tradition, Sherlock.” He had stepped away slightly so I could lift the dish out of the oven, armed with oven gloves. When I’d put it down he had pressed the entire length of himself against my back.
[new post]
“No way. Not so fast.” I’d kissed the corner of his mouth, the line of his jaw. “You asked for this. My rules.” I had been determined to ensure he was so-very-not-bored for the longest period of time possible.
always
He glares at me. His irises are cutting into my thoughts like the impossible colours of them are butter knives. Apparently, this is serious. I don’t say anything else.
Regardless, we arrived with nearly nothing, as new men might. Ready to sew our new selves into the walls.
--how many more breaths of yours--
He looks at me. I’m looking right back at him. I’ve put the newspaper down on the arm of this chair having taken the time to fold it, precisely, like something worth saving. Both of us know he is about to open his mouth and both of us know that what will come flooding out is going to be extraordinary, so extraordinary it will coat every particle of air in the living room in vanilla and ozone.
Three: From my wrists and my neck-
You find yourself endeared towards my complacency?
I want you I want you I want You
“kiss me”
He does trust you. You swirl it around your skull like wine on the soft palate. He does trust you. And yet, for that one small moment, his faith in you wavered all the same.
One of my favourites only had a duration of a few seconds but I play it and replay it until I can recall it perfectly.
I don’t really understand.
Don’t.

We stayed like this for a while, wandering from room to room and planning a fuller space, with us at the heart of it. It was good.
“i want to kiss your mouth”
The rest of the entries are images or moments or things he said.
, tradition, Sherlock.” I’d turned in his arms. “Just a more recent one, that’s all.”
Don’t get me wrong: I adored every second I spent with that man, pure adoration that went further than love and beyond into a stretch of palpitations and colours filling up every space in the marrow of my bones. But these moments of- well, freedom, were the moments in which, within myself, I felt incredibly alive and incredibly untethered to anything or anyone or even my own body. Just thoughts not following one definite path, traversing and fluttering into existence along every direction possible. And I shared them with him. I did. He was there beside me, his consciousness so far and so differently mapped than mine, but my hand was in his pocket, wrapped in his hand, I was wrapped in his hand, wrapped in him, and we were exquisitely aerial. Together, separate; what did it matter? Our eyes were pointed in the same direction and the dog ran across the sand.
Lestrade turned to her.
Sherlock stared at John’s inmovil face, for a bit too long, without noticing.
Lestrade directed his men firm and passionate like it was the academy, and Sherlock let them follow him, once again, to the crime scene.
Lestrade wanted to say something, but voice failed him
“…” Sherlock nodded.
Was it today? How long had been since John’s… death? What had he done in this days?
Molly saw him come in like it was some short of reborn war hero, and sheepesly walked up to him. Sherlock was very patient (his still half-numb state helped) while she tried to find words.
“No, it was the smell”
“Old gunshot in the shoulder. Yes”
As a result, he got kicked back, but what was a broken rib compared to freedom?
He was Hysterical, thou seemed very happy and relieved to be among the police.
“So he is behaving odd. How? Like on drugs?”
That was not odd… coming from him, but he had left it right above John’s salad.
“And you are in drugs! You are not who to claim her”
“I will wait for the results, only that, and then it will all be over”
“She is no toy! She’s Jon’s daughter and I have to make sure she is fine”
“They were already doing it and they would never stop if we didn’t change the course of action”
“Why didn’t you… say something, then?”
There was no doubt. No other way to name it.
Sherlock answered while typing in the laptop in front of him.
Rosie would never meet her dad, John.
“There was a time, when everyone was after me, to such an extent, that you had to help me fake my death. And as everyone in the streets, and in the press, and the autorities themselves were chaising me, and even when holding in his hands proof against me, specificly made for him, when all proof pointed at me, he somehow stood by my side.
On the other end of the line, Mycroft took a deep breath.
His brother, on the other side of the desk, trembling, felt the need for something hard to make his emotions easier to deal with… and though he could see John standing next to Mycroft, crossed arms, looking at him with a serious, worried expression.
“The murderer was smoking in the cab? Maybe that’s a clue. We’re looking for a man who smokes…”
“YOU WERE WATCHING!”
Sherlock wondered how much awake and capable she was now. It would be interesting (perhaps even fun!) to make a couple of tests with her... And, did she really remembered him or he just seemed familiar to her, and so, she liked his face, and the sound of his voice.
“Shut up!”
He lied back again, closed his eyes, and masaged his face with his hands, emiting a low growl.
He felt anxious. But not for drugs. No need for it, as tempting as they were.
“The difficult and exigent situation within your family, specially in your jouth must have been quite the pressure, and it explains you being protective of your family and at the time resentfull, understanding and still shy and many, many facets of your personality and little gestures that show a typical…”
He tried to solve it given what he knew.
She was one of the only persons who got to share her life with Sherlock Holmes, and knew that, actually, thou he may not look like it, thou he may rarely express them, he had feelings.
At the very least, Sherlock made sure several samples would be taken just to double check… and ordered a dental check. For good measure.
“I am sorry, John. I should have accepted your advance on me that very first time at Angelo’s”
After a while looking at John’s pale, still face, he looked around, not really taking any details in.
“No!” She had to insist in order to interrupt him “No, there was nothing, it was just a stupid swap”
Sherlock went through it all awkwardly looking at anywhere else and eager to jump into action. When Lestrade finally run out of words to ramable with Sherlock looked very deep into his eyes and said “The game is on”
Then, thoughts started racing again, more fluent than usual, as they did with the influence of the drug. He needed this.
In the middle of the room, just a few meters over there, there was something large lying on the floor.
He didn’t even go throu the many texts. He didn’t care. He went directly to the mourge.
“WHAT IS YOU BLODDY PROBLEM!?”
Sherlock stared at him for a few seconds and then reclined on his chair and answered:
“Yes I did! John and Mary shared their life together with me. They would pass out in exaustion in my couch, and I was left alone to take care of the baby… and we did fine! Wonderfull, even. I can do it”
Whas he feeling guilt, or just needed a fix? He tried to recober and think of a few words to say…
“I am curious now”
He bought a shovel, and a stone drill, together with working googles, and he… put it in a bag, and went for a coffee, to make some time before nightfall, when the graveyard would be desolate.
"Yes"
“LEAVE ME ALONE”
He faced her in the last moment.
She gestured as to hit again, and this time Sherlock backed off, but not far enough to get out the door.
“HE IS ALIVE!!” And laughted maniacly.
Sherlock stood still. Mycroft was really sorry for this, but he had to press further.
He had nearly 20 missing calls from Lestrade.
“The first months, and the first years of a persons life are crucial for cominication and social skills. Even from the womb, they recognice voices. So, even if you expent a long time without her, she must still have something of you in her, after the important, also long time you spent with her”
Sherlock made that gesture with his head, like when he wondered why he was alone in a world of ignorants
Now this is more or less how Mrs. Hudson had felt when Sherlock, excentric and messy, like a big child had started living with her. And when John had moved in.
“I had one bizzare dream”
She lied a tray of tea at his side and stood right there, staring in silence.
“…I can’t”
“…one?”
“Agent Jey… Joey… Geor… whatever Lestrade?”
’24 hourse more…’
“It was distracting. I’m trying to work”
He looked around, and after a moment of considering, grasped the coffee table and smashed it violently against the floor, and then threw it away.
Sherlock was already on his way. The driver got a phone call, noded, changed course and passed the phone to Sherlock.
“I am already going to expend the next week at the edge of a nerve wreck waiting for my phone to ring and wondering what it means every second that it does not. I am not a cold genious like you, Sherlock. Most of us, aren’t”
John stood silent as a response and Sherlock feared it would be a disaproving gesture.
“But you are not gonna get him”
And that’s becouse Sherlock was brilliant, and he knew John.
Sherlock took a deep breath.
Sherlock’s expression still didn’t change
He hadn't read it jet when the door busted open, nearly kicked off its place, and three agents dressed in black jumped on him to hold him still.
RIDICULOUS
This one had been found poisoned, on the street...
He found himself trapped in a kind of brain collapse, thinking again of the last things he said to him and the look of him in the cold, dirty, bloody…
Both chuckled in the dark. Then, Sherlock clarified:
"They can, and they will change their hair, face, eyes, clothes... Anyone"
2-	Finding what had happened to John, and the responsible one.
But just seconds later, Sherlock interrupted the silence once more.
“John, I am terribly sorry for that time I made you believe I was dead, for now I am learning what a monstruosity it was. I am sorry. …And I wish… I could say it to your… face…”
“Don’t… just do it!”
Sherlock looked at him like he would punish him for daring to speak such words.
It had John's face, and was wearing similar clothes, but as soon as they were removed there was no doubth.
“There’s been two new murders of… of people who look like John!”
The one next to him was trembling, croached to one side and lookingdown as to get as far as possible of an off-screen threat.
He trashed around the place, tried to concentrate. Made a proto-schelude for his next course of action regarding the events… and then tried to razonate about John’s case.
“What do you mean out of radius? Mycroft!”
The girl had lost the trail of words, but she still got a mic from her purse bag and raised it to Sherlock’s face.
“Of course, dear”
“No, no I wasn’t. You’ll have to find something else to apologice for, starting for those two years of dead silence”
“How did you know it was not me, the first time? Was it Molly?”
Sherlock felt invested. He took a cab to the bridge, and looked at the scene from a window on his mind palace, were he looked up every data he had regarding the case, the víctims, the press ... And spraking of the press.
I don’t do that for wimps! And you…”
He couldn’t help but remember one last time the conversation they had before he had been gone. ‘I refuse to apologice for a salad’
Imagine that a pair of birds nested near your window and you got to see them come and go as the chicks grow. Or that a mama cat had a litter under your house, and you got to feed them and see the cute kittens come and go and play…
“I worked for him. I learned of him as much as my average mind was capable of. He was the new step for humanity. Supirior. Necesary in this world. And you…”
“I…don’t know. …The cab went off radius”
“Woa, hey man, we are almost there just hold on!”
“…When john asked me to give a speech on his wedding, I was…well, quite lost. I had no idea how to do it and even thou I tried for days I still messed it up somehow…
“You married a woman. And before the party was over, she was already pregnant”
“Oh, Sherlock… I’m terribly sorry. I though maybe a little case…”
The case of John’s death.
“You attacked an officer with a shovel”
This last comment was ignored. The soldier passed an arm over Sherlock.
“Maybe. But, does she need you?”
“well. For that I’m not sorry. It was complicated, but I cared for her. And I wanted to form a family. And I got Rosie”
“We have something huge”
Sherlock didn’t lift his gaze of the computer screens (he was working with five)
He then texted the other inspector… whatever his name was and just dismissed him politely
Doc pushed the panic bottom. A siren echoed throu the tunnels, and his mates started running. Doc run out the stairs and started the engine of the truck. The others oppened the door of the big room, and hearded the copies up the stairs like sheep. They were terrified and high and didn't even atempt to disobey.
She knew, oh, she knew well, how broken the boy was.
“SHUT UP AND BARE WITH ME!”
Facing it there was a folded paper with the message ’48 H guess who’
And the four of them run in different directions.
That was John. He had been kidnapped, beaten, held in poor conditions, his face copied to those of diying victims… and he still would fight, and he would still sit calm, and glare at him throu a camera, and try to send a message.
Dog noded, and kept moving forwards... until he was close enough.
“What does that have to…?”
After geting over his problem with Sherlock, he was still readjusting to life and planing how to fit a child into their routine… when everything had happened.
“No! Just… no”
“Oh, Sherlock, please! Give the poor lady some time to sit down first at least…”
“What are you doing?” the papparazzi asked.
The cab was having trouble to either get or leave anyplace Sherlock or even Lestrade would go to. They had already found about the first corpse being fake, and the second being another John…
All in all, Rosie had been away for a few moths… and infants grow really fast. She was now close to one year old, with longer, blonde locks and considerably larger...
“You had everything planned out to avenge him, but it didn’t work did it? Why?”
Sherlock smiled. He had missed this.
“…the dna one” She said with the tiniest mouth Sherlock had ever seen.
Sherlock looked up to the criminal, taking in all of the details.
Mrs. Hudson didn’t bother him when he rushed to lock himself in and did not come out. She found out thanks to Lestrade, who was having his own hard time.
It was a woman.
‘cause he’s alive! He’s alive”
‘Not today. Give me a couple days’
At the third try, she managed.
From time to time he played the violín or conducted a couple little experiments. He exchanged many texts with Lestrade, and only one with Mycroft.
He bent over the table and sniffed deeply John’s face. His mouth, the side of his head…
“You can’t just… can’t do this to me!” Mycroft rolled his eyes with a sight.
He breathed deeply again, and his breath came out shaggy… and he decided he needed a drink. So he stopped at the closest place and ordered something…
The phone woke him up nearly as late as 13PM next day.
“No, its… see, is just, uh, I…”
Mycroft stood still on his seat next to him, akwardly staring with wide eyes.
He got home with his hyperactive brain on hiatus: it was like one of those days traffic collapsed roads.
Molly looked at him again.
“I did not”
“You could do as Lestrade and take a, few days off, if you feel… stressed”
He nearly tripped down the stairs, and he didn’t care to reach for the cocaine he had left somewere on his clothes. He needed something more.
He breathed again.
“Sherlock! This conversation went on for too long. My answer is final. No”
The ex-hostage stuttered a bit
He had been beaten, and fought back.
"We got three suspicious subjects"
“And he had all the right to do so after how you dropped of the case. The case of John. Tell me, what are you playing at…? Sherlock?”
In the back seat of the cab, he managed his aching head, reduced to a trembling tight ball in a corner, and the driver asked him if he was allright.
‘Back on the case. New trail. No need to worry, lay off ‘till Lestrade comes tomorrow’
“You really want to know?”
“Is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your dream? Before I try to get some sleep, and have nightmares?”
He left that laptop aside and started with the other one.
“He was not drudged, nor did he try to defend himself. Maybe he was talking to the aggressor, thinking he could… maybe the shot was accidental…”
“That is not my fault. Neither it’s John’s”
“Sherlock stop!”
“Yeah, but what else? Drugs?”
“I’m working!”
The detective shouted eureka, and the two of them exchanged a meaningfull, discret look.
“He’s not a dog, he is a human being”
It was the other Holmes. Mycroft.
“What was I supposed to do? Wait, arms crossed for nothing to happen? Drug myself to unconsciousness? I need that dni!”
“Well, Brains. Finally coming for your dog?”
Sherlock made a face
The criminal licked his lips. He had dreamed with this moment and it was finally here.
Oh no.
“See. They’r just wimps. You just want them but…”
“Oh, I’m intelligent. My plan fooled brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes, and threw him into depresion! Dog here was kind of worried, even”
“Why… woman? …and pregnant?”
Sherlock tilted his head.
They all let go a deep breath when the new DNA results came up.
“Give me a few minutes”
“Of for fuck’s sake!”
John crossed his arms and changed weight from one foot to the other, like he was holding back something and breathed deep. He did not answer.
Sherlock breathed deeply. The chances that this was not John but jet another fake one rose and trembled like in a wicked game of bets.
It happened so fast
“Why, Sherlock?”
“…you were right. All so right. All the tests, all of it is… is…”
“…there… was…”
“Sherlock, you can not automatically involve me. There is a high chance that the poor doctor finally lost his patience”
“Pray tell, what is next on the list?”
“It was obviously product of the stress and worries we exposed ourselves to, recently”
“Maybe he… drank something before he died?”
“Shrelock…”
“Get out of my working space! Now!”
For days.
He needed a fix.
A few meters behing the rock, Greg Lestrade breathed deeply and put down his recently shot gun.
It was so odd how she had been weeping at Sherlock’s burial, and Mary’s, and now she got to do the same at John’s. With Sherlock.
Then, out of nowere, Mrs. Hudson was there. She said some reasuring words he did not understand, and Sherlock just let her guide him throu his nightmares and pay the poor driver.
“What was that? You must have something left after the body was taken. If you are not telling me what it is then that’s a lie”
“There were suspicious clues. Every person has a distinctive, unique scent, wich also depends of things like diet and life style. John did not consume alchool nor tobaco and even under it he did not smell the same. Also, he is a strong, hot-headed, cold-bloded ex-soldier. He would’ve fight back if he was not drugged. And that man didn’t.
“I don’t apologice that easilly”
The dog stood at the edge of the rock, barking at the man who had just fallen, as the police team secured him and picked him up of the bushes.
“I did not”
Had he really spent them high? Wait, that was not usually a problem: he could manage a case better when he was high. Why hadn’t he figured it out jet!?
“I’ll sut again!”
“The bruise on his knuckles is gone. How could it be gone? It can not be gone”
“Yes, and turns out she was an spy, or assassin, and she shooted me, but she was nice”
“why were you so dessperate to seek a reaction on me? So many murders so close one after the other each one so obvious, each one diferent, why? Why you want my desspair?”
The co pilot of the flying machine descrived the situation: someone got off the co-pilot's place, went to the back of the truck and got five hostages out.
He walked all around the table and checked the other hand.
Sherlock didn't move. Lestrade moved a few steps arround, nerviously, and then walked ver y close to the detective and asked, ver y low, like he did lately.
As a character and story creator and all in all writer, I consider these two a "thing" If you'd like to call it so even if it is just in my headcanon.
“…Just to be clear, are you asexual?”
“They were not caught on camera?”
Mycroft, honestly shocked, closed the door.
Jonhn’s burial would be three days later.
“How did you know? Please, I need to know it”
“Does Sherlock sound like healthy to you?”
“Them”
“Start the record again”
The truck was as well as cornered already. There was better chance of getting lost into the woods. So sherlock joined the group that continued the chase up hill, among trees.
“On his knuckles, he punched a wall and had been complaining for a week”
Sherlock was already halfway trough the stairs
“I will help you with this, but! You will come for diner with us on christmash, and behave!”
Mycroft croached over to him.
“Mrs. Watson?” She looked at him. She recogniced him from the newspapers or tv, and John’s stories, but still, Sherlock behaved. If not, he wouldn’t get to hold Rosie.
Dog did.
Of course she couldn’t possibly know what was happening… but did she actually remember him?
Sherlock stood tall, and stumbled. Just centimeters from his shoes lay the lifeless body of John Watson.
Lestrade shook his head, and breathed deeply
John siged and looked back at him.
Like a couple arguing across the table with mere glares. Like they were playing a game of guess and Watson was saying ‘you better don’t fuck this up like you did with my salad’ without words.
“… they are playing with us. The first time, they wanted to fool us: see how we would act, with a dead John on our hands. But, probably, without really killing the real one…
"So what?"
It was him. John Watson, right there a few feet of him. He had been alive all this time, kept away somewere. And he was here now. And still in danger.
Having it removed, and lying on the ground in front of them, Lestrade nervously clenched and unclenched his fists, looking at the dead and Sherlock one at a time.
“You will never again get bored. You will always have work with Rosie arround”
“What”
“He killed himself that was not my fault!”
He walked towards the baby, and the woman who was holding her.
It had been quite emotional, and many were now trying to stay decent while whiping away their tears.
There was Mrs. Hudson, of course, and Mike, who seemed to feel a pang of regret for something… and Little Rosie, on someone’s arms… Lestrad, and even Sally, and John’s sister, who had been late, and looked more or less like him.
Then, to his brother
Wait. The smell… it was important somehow.
“No, you can’t. You have no right over her”
She had tea, and coffee, and pasteries… and was dressed in an elegan black dress.
I was starting to look rather disgusting. His fluids were starting to dry and his flesh was turning flat agains’t his skull bones, eyes sunk deeper into it, skin less and less livid…
“Oh, please, the other option is an alchoolic woman John hated!”
“So he did hit you”
Sherlock knew it was highly unlikely that he could be with his sister or any of his exes, so he checked his blog before his next move.
“Mycroft. Brother. You know John helped me. She could help me. We could take care of one another. I… need her”
“…what who?”
1-	John was dead. Fuck the world, and the kid and all the powder in existance…
Sherlock ignored that one. He concentrated.
Sherlock texted Lestrade then.
“…It looks just like John”
“We found… another one”
And they had somehow found out about the last one.
"What?"
Sherlock would listen no more. He was restless and demanding as only he would get the entire two minutes that the police took to set into action a small team of General Purpose malinose dogs wich inmediatly got the scent and run up the hill with the whole team runing close behind.
Sherlock needed a fix.
“MYCROFT”
Lestrade held Guard 1 by the neck of the suit.
Sherlock stared at nothing for a while, and only spoke when Watson though he wouldn’t already.
Mrs. Hudson hummed around cleaning the eternal mess of his home and making tea, wich was her way of dealing with stress.
3-	Taking care of the kid
“What”
Sherlock had lifted one hand. He seemed paniqued at the sight of John, alive, on camera. And another one, and another one, and a third one, plus a fourth.
Sherlock was not made of stone, as much as he had evolved into apearing so. He didn’t know it, but he wanted to run, and break into werever the baby was, and wrap her tight into his coat, against his chest, and run and run and shield her from the danger that was there and take her back to her dad… John.
'2-wc urgent. g2'
The day after is when he broke into the mourge showering Molly with his aura of ‘I own this place give me what I want’
He had his hands tied and was gagged, dressed in dirty clothes that looked even bigger size than his due to the fact that he was so much skinnier. There was dark shadows below his eyes but that hopefull, worried stare he was gibing Sherlock and only him was all so his, so familiar.
Have you ever seen a human hung by the neck? His tongue hung of his mouth, and his neck was in quite an unnatural angle.
He was sleeping when the siren started and one of his captors entered the room on a hurry. Any tiny failure on their plan could earn him time or clues for Sherlock, so withou thinking, he impused resistance: when the other crouched down to uncuff him, he kicked him on the face.
“No. Don’t go near the lab to bother my co-workers. I want you out of this place alltogether. ‘till the results come, you’re banned”
Or, well, magic powder, you know.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You… you worked with him?”
“another one what?”
Sherlock glanced at him quizzicaly.
Lestrade didn’t answer he just denied with his head. Mycroft insisted.
It was a fisic call of attention to announce his intentions more than an actual kiss.
Lestrade called the next morning, early. Sherlock waited patiently for half a second and interrupted his silence.
Lestrade waited for a few seconds. Then he walked up to him and reclined on the table.
‘give them 24 hours’
His aptitude and determination made his psicological recovery quite quick too.
“Don’t mention it” Mycroft answered with a disgusted expression.
“No. Mrs. Hudson is actually happy with the idea of babysitting and I have already planned experiments regarding the developement of an infant’s psique for the next two years”
But before he left, he went back to John’s hand.
Soon, there came a moment when his body and his brain decided they had had enough chemicals and excercise and not enough rest, and he collapsed.
“That was necesary”
“hm?”
He did this while walking down stairs and texting Dimmock, who was in charge during Lestrade’s little vacations.
“Sherlock…”
He did look at John’s face. It was him. No possible way out. Sherlock let go of his hand, what somehow took him a large effort, thou not as much as to walk away.
It could be anyone! …and also, the press had found out. Goddamet!
Sherlock went throu the rest of the ceremony like an automat, and was going to leave without another word… but he saw Rosie.
“The officer tried to take the shovel from me, and I defended myself”
Sherlock didn’t mind. He kissed the little hand and then held her closer. Breathed deeply throu his nose.
“You think is not enough?” He turned to the detective “Why aren’t you picking up the phone?”
Molly looked at him with those eyes of adoration again. Falling for him all over again.
‘not fisicly possible’
“I… had the impression…”
Molly took it all in. He had been right from the begining, from the very begining, thou drugs and the loss and the baby… and mourning companions telling him off…
“Try to sleep, Sherlock”
“Oh, my…”
But he owned this place. More than ever, like it was his house. In a swift motion, he uncovered John’s head.
Her world had become unbalanced, between depressing silence and confusing emptiness, and the chaos of a new baby to care for…
“It was not his! There must be a… a… trap or something…!”
He tiped John on his shoulder with the gun as he spoke, slowly.
“yeah, but… well. She died anyways, after having the baby. So, she didn’t really add much to the story. I think my dream was a reflection of how I could get what I want easily”
“Sorry, I am feeling quite… saturated right now and I need some distraction”
Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore. He crouched behind driver’s seat and pulled out a bit of cocaine. It was just a bit but he needed it like water on the desert. He even wished it was a syngerine…
“Sherlock… there’s no need for this, it’s been identified already…”
"People are dying becouse of you, bastard. And you'll be enjoying it"
“…Why did you marry Mary?”
John waited a few seconds and kissed the detective in the dark, getting him in the chin.
“You… you just… you can’t leave John and the rest of us rest in peace? I was on vacation for this! And the day I come back, that day you…!”
"So, do we have a plan...?"
Dog hesitated. He still felt sleepy, weak, heavy... But the helicopter was just there
“Oh!” Mrs Hudson took her hand to her chest.
Mrs Hudson interrupted him again. Her tone of voice was cold and unsecure.
“Uh… sure?”
That was it. With a shriek of rage, Sherlock threw the phone hard and far away.
“What? No”
“I need to concentrate all my resources on one case now, Mrs. Hudson”
“He wanted you to die. And the condition was that yourd friends would live. He died, and you didn’t pay the price!”
In between them, Lestrade nerviously looked back and forth from Sherlock, to the new corpse, on the table.
“Did… you drug… him?”
And Greg's face paled with horror as Guard 1 laughted on it.
“You” Sherlock’s jaw clenched, his words trembled with so much poison
The wait was exaustive.
“I… knew it would be complicated… but…! The system just doesn’t work!”
‘back already?’ The answer sounded quite healthy, considering all facts.
“You misunderstood, I certainly didn’t”
“Get out of my house and let me work”
“You drugged him right? …poison.. him… what…?”
Lestrade took a second to react, but he pushed down whatever he was munching with one last glup of coffee and he ran past Molly demanding
Lestrade walked close behind when he walked into the place… and froze, for a moment.
(sight) “you see, I ah” John wringled his hands and just kept it going the way he usually did: akward, but firm “I have… I… -I love you. There’s no other word for it, not anymore. I’ve been for a long time now. And while I was in…”
‘Mycroft, today afternoon’
“Then, why acused of doing so?”
A dead body had been found at the shore. Face down deep in the mud.
“Actually, we shall reorganice the whole kitchen, soon. The entire house, if necesary”
“Tell me your dream”
“They are all negative. We have check and double check and even the dental test… is all negative. All wrong… that man, as much as he looks like him, is not John Watson”
And he was back in the back of the cab were John had died. And the murderer drived the cab laughting at him and Sherlock argued to be taken where John was but the driver would not.
It didn’t take him a second to tell him apart. He could do it among millions, literally.
“Allright” Mycroft made a gesture with his hand, like he was speaking of bushiness
"But... Why...?"
“You were using a shovel and a drill to steal John’s body from the graveyard!”
“No. Its… its a video”
“Mycroft has offered to use his contacts to help with the adoption”
He decided to tackle the topic with humor, and sat by his side
This time, however, we already know the trick so the details are not so important anymore. …They just do this to see our reaction. Like telling you you can not eat sugar, and then hanging candy on your face”
Wait. Fuck perhaps. Sherlock’s brain overloaded. The walls of his mind castle vibrated with the sound of a fire alarm aparently instaled by John without his consentiment.
'Dog left clues on video. Brains got it. FLEE'
They persecuted him like flys to shit, and for once he did not mind: he had the theory that the murder may be involved with the press, and whatever people may say of them, it was not as important as John's life.
Sherlock carassed his knucles before going back to work… on a case of a missing dog.
‘afternoon’
“only for a while”
But annoying was not the proper world: it was upsetting, terrifying, disgusting, unnerving, infuriating…
But he didn’t want to sleep. He had slept enough the past day.
“There is… something else, we need to discuss, before bringing her in”
It was fake. Again.
“Sherlock, no. I can’t do that!”
No new entrys.
Maybe John was dead and the video was just to play with him like the rest of the case. Maybe it had arrived late and John was already dead. Maybe it was not really John, but a double who had studied his behaivour and was sending a false clue…
There was silence on the room, scept for the quick typing next to the window.
“Before she was born, I made a vow to protect the three of them. I am responsible…”
There was an odd silence, in wich it was balanced if what he had just said was more reassuring or not. Oh well.
He barely noticed he stopped talking there for a moment.
He retreated home were he stood still on his chair, looking at nothing, right in front of John's empty chair.
He went rigid. Calmly peeked at the phone and then dropped it annoyed.
It was not far from the city, but already looked like the middle of nowhere, green field as far as the sight could reach.
"This new body, is it John's?"
Sherlock thoug of a way out. He had to buy time. He had to keep him speaking. Maybe beg for John’s life? No, that could make a sudden shot so satisfactory…
“I do not believe it!”
Or was it the living room? It was a mess. Had been since… oh well.
“And I mean every christmash. This is a big… thing.”
The dog next to him barked and tried to advance. Its handler held it firmly by the collar, front paws scratching the air.
He smelt a bit down his forearm too, and then moved on to his head:
John emited a quiet, breathy laught and Sherlock guessed he had not been the only one repeating those words within his head.
John jumped onto Mrs. Hudson’s arms when she oppend the door and squeezed her carefully, to her delight. Then he excused himself, not without first mentioning his mother would be coming with the baby for dinner.
“…I was very odd”
“None of this was accidental… um?”
He felt cold. Not in terms of heat, but sensation.
…They were like the nephews she never had, see? She did care for them a lot.
“A paper! A… notebook… ANYTHING!”
“What is it. What would you keep from me?”
He took another moment “What do you have?”
He pushed them aside, and tried playing the violin.
John was dead and he needed a fix and John was dead and he had to know what happened because there was smoke and alcohol but why and the knuckles and his brother and he needed a fix and he had to fix this already but even if he did john was dead…
“…and then we played the violin together”
Sherlock fully turned to her
“Seems like the doctor left your place at 7PM yesterday… in a cab… and went south”
Sherlock was so in love. He loved it. The video that provided him with clues to find John, to see him alive and in good use of his capacities, the fact that John knew him and sent this to him… and the man on the chair glaring at him.
That is, for now. It was just a matter of time ‘till he would run out of patience… or grow used to it like Lestrade.
“A clue?”
‘and on drugs’ she wanted to add. She didn’t, but Sherlock noticed.
“what”
The one on the left was crying his eyes out, barely even looking at the camera, crouched as low as the ropes would allow it.
Wasn’t he, John’s best friend, and co-worker, and flatmate, the best option to raise Rosie with his memory? …Or did the poor kid deserve to start a brad new life far away from this tragedy, and sherlock, and all the danger that aparently surrounded him?
He kissed her again and then handed her back to her grandmother.
Sherlock’s wicked grin came back to his face for the first time in a long time.
“Your dream. Tell me about it. We will be both distracted”
It wasn’t him not being there. It was him not being, period.
Greg took it eagerly and wiped his face desperatly, to no avail. He kept dehidrating at a fast peace throu his eyes, and spoiling the handechief beyond posibility of Mycroft asking for it back. Ever.
"Keep moving!"
Sherlock took this in and then answered
One last gun shot filled the air and Sherlock flinched.
Sherlock had thrown the phone over to the wall, with such force it broke into pieces.
'Good question'
And so the searching party divided: one agent and his dog backed up by two officers went in each direction, scept the one heading up and front, as it seemed to be the stronger scented track, and most likely to include their criminal, it was follow by two dogs, with theyr workers, sherlock side by side and Lestrade and the rest of the team falling a bit behind, perhaps due to the dificult landscape, or the many donuts.
“I don’t care how but contact Sherlock…!”
Sherlock fell to his knees, hands right to his neck… cold, stiff flesh and no breathing, nor heartbeat.
“I disassembled it”
John shook his head, and deliveratly invaded Sherlock’s personal space, to hold his face firmly and kiss him fully on the lips. Well, kiss is a way to call it. It was not very romantic nor charming. It lacked the litlest bit of erotism and it was still and forcefull.
That one. The ‘I can’t believe you are considering this, and I’m waiting for you to make a counclusion I will react to quite amusingly no mater wich one is it’
“No, is not her”
“I had a crazy evil sister, who I didn’t remember, and my dog, Redbeard, turns out it was not a dog, but a kid! And she had killed it, and so, she was locked up… But she got out, and started killing people, and to stop her I had to play with her in the cells, like in the movie, saw”
She didn’t smell like John anymore… but that was only logical, why was it so upsetting? John himself didn’t smell anymore like…
Doc looked at his hostage seeking a possible reaction.
Sherlock barely spent any time at home during the days before the burial. He spent this time continously runing back and forth to the crime scene, and the place where the cab was kept and the mourge, collecting possible pieces of information, asking questions and blaming the whole of humanity for being useless and pitifull.
One of them picked the note, readed it, and closed the door.
“…Yes”
“… oh… ok, so… why are they doing this? Serial killers, taking him, changing the plan so suddenly…?”
Very soon, they were geting ready to take in little Rosie, plan wich included big changes in the kitchen, rooms and their actual routines.
Sherlock spoke like he was commenting on an odd weather.
Mycroft sighed through his nose with closed eyes before he checked the data he had already requested, on the tablet.
‘Of course. You were right about the Drs. Death. I must admit I am impressed’
Sherlock breathed deeply. Of course. Even after killing himself he had left seeds of himself to make sure his wishes were carried.
Sherlock shut the door on her face, for a second they could still hear the sentence being ended on the other side.
Sherlock checked the phone again, and seeing the absence of texts he went for the closest possibilities:
Another one.
Back in Sherlock’s head, there was loud ringing, like another fire alarm set on his mind-castle, so strong that it made the walls tremble and his tympani bleed, the certain knolege that he was alive.
‘You are not texting back. Got nothing?’
“That is, what you think about it, and if I should put some distance and leave with my daughter and maybe… keep working together in a… strictly proffesional way?”
“I mean, a normal adoption takes more than two years of constant paperwork and…! I haven’t been planing on it, and already have many ideas that would work way better…”
“The press is right”
The kidnappers of John and the other victims, and killers of some of them don’t deserve much mentioning, but for the satisfaction of the reader it will be stated that John and the other survivors made very easy their identification.
“The custody of the baby, or John’s corpse. Decide what you really need. Leave the other”
‘Let’s put Rosie and the murder at the same level of concern, just not to offend John’ he thoug. You know, propperly.
“You saw it and said nothing”
He knew it was not her, It was the entire world, the sounds of the street, the light dropping from the sun on him and the mere presence of humanity
“I don’t believe you. You have pretended to fail before, and every time you’ve come out on top. And you will not be less now that John's life is at stake”
It ocured to him he may need sleep by now. He had nothing better to do and wanted to be fresh for the investigation…
“Molly. Molly, eyes here. What do you have?”
“What else?”
“What do you mean not really? You think he would not fight back!?”
And he got a call from a paniked Greg Lestrade.
Hours later, when he started noticing his absence, Sherlock realized he had been distracted up to ungodly hours in the night…
“The plate has been checked… It was stolen yesterday”
“You… you knew this would happen”
"Only maniatic laughter, aparently"
“You were convinced you needed that baby and then you found is for the best to let her go. Just… take a few days to let the burial sink in and… maybe the… substances you’ve been taking to wash off”
'Do you have anything jet?’
Sherlock resisted, but that effort left his capacity of comunication with the real world haning from a tender piece of wet paper.
It was a message.
“Mr. Holmes, do you have any idea of who could’ve done this? An old enemy of yours, maybe…?”
“…You were gone”
“Something’s missing”

“I’ll shut before its closer!”
“I have reasons to believe your father happened to be an old-fashioned, very exigent man, situation in wich influences your sister, who is not only alchoolic, but lesbian”

“And I hope you are doing all you can to find John’s eh… kidnapper, and the killer of our six victims who had his face. …Unlike the press says”
