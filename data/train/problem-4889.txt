to Steve. Any other day, Steve would have been very pleased to know that Tony had someone so protective in his corner. Right now, Steve wished he would have sent Bucky to do this.
Steve clenched his eyes shut, nodding slightly as another tear slid down his cheek. Opening his eyes, he looked back down at Peter. “You’re going to go with Aunt Pepper, ok? You be a good boy for her, and I’ll see you in the morning.” He leaned down, pressing a firm kiss against his son’s head. “I love you so much. So does Daddy,” Steve whispered against the smooth forehead. As Pepper’s hands reached down again, Steve finally relented, trying to ignore the cold space that opened up after Peter was finally lifted form his arms.
Steve let out an angry shout before pushing back off the mat, and into Bucky. Steve and Bucky have been sparring together for years, their similar builds and familiarity of the other usually proved for an even match, but not tonight. Each punch and kick thrown by Steve was fueled by his rage, but Bucky slipped away from each one.
Clint stared at the aids in wonder before looking back up to Tony. Tony gave him a small smile, before gesturing for Clint to put them in.
Before leaving, Bucky paused, giving a last glance to the corner of his closet. His go-bag that had been packed immediately, as soon as he first stepped foot in his new house. Stuffed full with clothes, loose cash, and some pocket knives. He’d even managed to finagle a fake I.D. from some kids at the local college. He’d itched to go out and buy a gun – criminal or not, it was laughably easy to get his hands on one down here – but he had held off. He wasn’t going to give his FBI handler an excuse to raid his house, or worse, have him pick up and move. Besides, he knew his neighbor had one in his garage; it would be just as easy for him to swipe it on his way out.
“Oh really? The great Tony Stark admitting he doesn’t know something? First the Rubik’s Cube, now this?”
“I don’t know, I don’t care!” Clint responded, getting hysterical. “He can’t be here. The cops are coming and they’re going to ask questions. He’s gonna do something stupid like get himself killed, or worse, get himself arrested.”
“Tomorrow, Fury will arrest both Pierce and Stane simultaneously. While that’s happening, I’ll be taking a few of you with me, per request of the FBI. Fury thinks he knows where Pierce is housing the files, he needs us to confirm it. The rest of you, after all this is over, will be escorted to your assigned FBI handler. From there, you’ll be sent away to your safehouse.”
The Captain flushed, breaking eye contact with Tony. “I was talking with Happy. The doctor said that it helps if you talk with him, that he might hear everything.”
Sam smiled sadly to himself, stepping off the sidewalk to walk across his front lawn. Wherever they were, Sam just hoped they still had some semblance of the feeling.
“Well, we can’t exactly go and straight up tell him what we’ve been doing,” countered Clint. “He’d take off for Stark first chance he’d get, and who knows how many men HYDRA have waiting just for him to show his face back in Manhattan.”
“I wouldn’t say that,” responded Stark. Steve looked at him questioningly, but stopped when he heard a familiar jovial laugh carried over the gunfire.
“There was another explosion. At base. The rest of the team is there. I need another suit, and you need a jet. We need to get to them.” Tony led Clint to another emergency exit, picking up the pace.
Where was Clint now? Had be been arrested? Had be been shot? Phil's heart clenched at the thought of Clint bleeding out on the ground, still crying for Phil.
“Don’t thank me yet,” Tony continued. “He knows I’m hiding something, which means he’ll have people watching me. We’re going to have to be more careful about our meetings.”
If you’re starting to worry about your moral compass, trust me, you’re still in a better boat than the rest of us.”
The cop was obviously a rookie, his fresh face pale and drawn, eyes as wide as saucers. Steve couldn’t pull his eyes away from the shaking gun. The kid was like a scared rabbit. One wrong move and everything could go south.
Tony guffawed, laughing louder when he saw Steve’s scowl. “And to think I thought today was going to suck.” To his dismay, Steve had thought Bucky had been joking when he showed Steve the golf club. But what the history books won’t tell you, was that James Barnes was much more stubborn than Steve was.
“No, he never knew. HYDRA just gave me tips to give to Stane on potential buyers, some of which were HYDRA. And of course, I got him in contact with the Ten Rings. When HYDRA found out that Stane wanted to kill Stark, we decided to help. We’d get rid of an enemy, and SHIELD would never know we we’re involved. And, it had the added benefit of Stane making weapons for HYDRA without him even knowing about it.”
“You need to go up on the vasopressor.” That was Bruce. Steve tried to calm himself, knowing that with Bruce in there, Tony would get the best help he could.
Steve nodded, finally feeling his heartbeat slow down. He walked towards the front door, pulling out his phone to call Nat, when-
Natasha shot him an unimpressed gaze. “You going to tell me anything I don’t know, or are you just going to whine?”
Fury looked around the cramped kitchen, eyes locking on the far corner. “You run a podcast,” he said. It wasn’t a question. “
“Tony?! Are you ok? What’s wrong?” Steve’s eyes were wide open with fear as they darted over Tony’s form, his chest heaving.
"Face it, Loki," Pierce finished. "You have no worth anymore. You're being convicted, which will lead to your deportation and incarceration in your home country. You'll never take a single step on American soil ever again. You're
Tony snapped his head back to the cemetery where Barnes was still being housed. Tony, of course, owed the man nothing; he had already saved his life.
You and the rest of your posse had the audacity to attack me today. And because of your actions, two of my people are injured.
He could hear a soft sigh emanate from the other side of the register, the tenor laced with irritation. Steve clenched his jaw, but otherwise ignored the cashier, opting to insert his plastic card into the reader for a third time.
Tony cracked his eyes open, seeing The Captain looking at him, his face covered with dirt and grime along with a small cut on his cheek.
Tony ignored the question. “So he’s coming here? To kill me because he thinks that thirty years from now I’ll become this insane murderer called Iron Man?”
Pierce adjusted his glasses on his pale nose. “Well, I watched Stane strut through my office today broadcasting the fact that he had snatched Tony Stark off the streets to dangle in front of The Captain, and that no one even knew he was gone.”
Barnes sighed, running a hand through his greasy hair. “It shouldn’t’ve mattered. We should have kept you closer. I should’ve kept you closer.”
“Tony, please,” Steve continued, blatantly ignoring how his voice sounded more like a sob. “You’re gonna be alright, baby, you just gotta fight for me, ok?”
“Tony,” Steve tried to placate. “You’re just a civilian. The Commandos fight as a single unit. We can’t have you out there to- ”
Steve spared a glance at Sam. Although the other man was looking at the cop, Steve saw the smaller man roll his shoulders, drawing Steve’s attention to the pack he always carried on his back.
Sam had thought about killing the man right there. Thought about wrapping his hands around the man’s neck and squeezing. Thought about the rush he would get as he felt the life escape through his purpling lips.
Steve sighed, looking around the grand foyer again. There was no good way to make any further progress. This was a dumb idea. He needed to regroup and scout the building. Regardless, he had to find something fast. Tony would be up soon, if he wasn’t already, and once he found that Steve wasn’t in his head, it wouldn’t be hard for the other man to put two and two together on where he’d gone.
he thought to himself. He cursed when he saw the clock, quickly grabbing his briefcase before heading out the door for work.
Maybe he should have brought his own gun. He was sure that Bucky had a knife strapped on him somewhere, but Steve had warned the whole group away from hiding firearms on their person. They were difficult to conceal, and with trained FBI agents, it’s not like they wouldn’t already be on the look for anything suspicious about them. One wrong move made by the gang and the whole arrangement could be called off, all of them being carted off to prison. But in the end, no one had searched them. Maybe they just assumed that Steve wouldn’t be that stupid, bringing a gun to a fight with experts wielding semi-automatics.
So Tony had talked enough for the both of them. Not so different from the last time he and Barnes had spent time in this building, when Tony had tried to distance himself from Steve’s betrayal, and a one-armed Barnes pleading for him to dive off the deep end. The only good thing about this trip to the office was that Tony could finally give himself the upgrade he so desperately needed. With the weapons division shut down, Tony had been working exuberantly, desperate to finalize that product that Obie needed to hook the board in.
Another pause for Tony’s response. “I just told you,” Natasha sighed. “Steve wants you to tell them about the locations. He isn’t going to be pissed at you for spilling the beans.”
Phil’s head flopped down on his pillows, groaning when his body protested the harsh movement. “I don’t know what you want from me, Sir.” His eyes lazily tracked the ceiling, trying to make out any semblance of where he was. It didn’t look like any time of hospital he had seen before, what with the room’s severe lacking of the color white. This place was dark, the only sort of light coming for strung up industrial lights, the beams showing specs of dust and God only knows what else dancing around in the dank room.
Looking back toward the smoking pile of rubble, Tony could see the faint glint of sharp and bloodied metal shine in the flames. A fan rotor. The ceiling had been covered in huge industrial fans to keep the warehouse cool. Part of the ceiling caves in, and boom: the falling blades are one patent away from being called a human cleaver.
Tony didn’t realize a stray tear had slipped from his wet eyes until Steve swiped it away with his thumb.
“Tony, come on. You gotta stay with me, ok? Wake up; let me see those eyes, sweetheart. Please, Tony,
. Who did you blab to? There was no one else around when you met with me; HYDRA shouldn't have known. Unless of course, you went around and ran your mouth all over town. What'd you say? Trying scare tactics? Send HYDRA running to the hills, telling them that I was already working with you?!"
wrong. But here he was on the floor of another dirty warehouse, a bombed out car, and an injured bodyguard.
“Save it for someone who cares. Because this,” Tony said, gesturing between the two of them, “is over. I’m done with you. I’m done with your lies and your secrets. I know what happens to people who get caught in your web, Steve Rogers. Because I don’t know if you remember, but I almost died yesterday. I almost died because of you and your lies. Well I’m done. I’m out.”
he thought to himself, weighing his options. Tony looked down at Steve, sleeping peacefully and grinned. Steve would probably given him a free pass on this one. He reached forward, yanking at the blonde’s hair.
Tony hummed. “That doesn’t necessarily bode well,” he mused. “Good thing I’ve never been known to make good decisions. Lead on, Rogers, and show me a good time.”
It wasn’t the fight. Of course it wasn’t. He and Steve had fought much more over much less. It wasn’t that. Maybe it was the realizations. The fact that he couldn’t lie to himself anymore; that he can’t pretend to not see his father every time he stepped in front of the mirror.
Was this was what it was like, to be part of a group like this? Did Tony want this? Steve would probably pull through, and now that all the dust had settled, was it time for him to go back to square one and head home alone, or should he stay?
Tony narrowed his eyes at the driver. “Which I declined, whole heartedly! Fury would just use me until I ended up with a one way ticket to prison.”
Tony just gave a bright laugh, walking to the curb and getting into the back of a car. “See you later, Steve.”
How would Obie react? It wasn’t like Obie didn’t know that he dabbled with mobs, just as Tony knew that Obie didn’t have a problem with it. Hell, Obie was in the process of trying to convince Tony to start
A harsh laugh escaped The Captain’s lips, the man trying to give a weak smile to cover up his obvious pain. “Yeah, he’s, uh. He’s somethin’ else.”
“He’s not my friend,” Tony said on impulse. “Do you have a phone?” he asked, but the nurse had already walked back into the other room.
“I could have really used you in my teenage years when I tried hiding evidence of my soirée’s before Howard got home.”
"I can and I will," Pierce countered. "You've gotten too comfortable here. So comfortable that I see that you've forgotten who runs this town. You've been nothing but a thorn in our side for the better half of a year, giving us nothing and taking everything."
“Yea, head of the whole operation. I know, the codename is kinda weird, just all of ours. Guy’s kind of a whack job. But the things he’s got planned, I’m convinced he’s a genius.”
Tony nodded in response, opting to go the long way so he wouldn’t have to cut through the sea of reporters. He would meet Steve by the back door where no doubt, he already had a car waiting. He would get in the armored vehicle pressed tight against Steve’s sides while they loop around to pick everyone else up. And they’d go back to the speakeasy, where Tony would collapse on the closest couch, letting himself be surround by Steve, by family, by
Tony looked down at the map, curious. “Yea, this is my house. Why is it marked?” Steve tried to respond when Tony cut him off again. “Where the hell did you get these numbers?”
“Then why are we here?” Bucky moaned. “It’s one thing to drag me along but waking me up before the sun was out was downright uncalled for. Spewing some bullshit about there might being a line. Really, Rogers? The day I see a line of people buying sheets is the day you can ship me right back to HYDRA.”
Phil’s heart throbbed painfully at the thought of how he felt as he saw Clint’s phone on the ground, flames shining against the darkened screen.
“No, you listen, asshole. You can damn well keep your opinions to yourself, because I could care less what you think.”
“If your name is listed, you sure as hell don’t sound concerned,” Tony noticed. “If Pierce is going public with this and you’re somehow involved, that could mean bad things for you. No more corner office.”
Steve ignored the urge to look at the photo immediately, instead turning to see Tony looking up again at the mailbox, a more curious gaze about him. “You want to go inside, don’t you?” Steve knowingly asked.
He’d struggled for days, trying to think of the right thing to say. What could he say? Fury was anything but helpful, and it wasn’t as if he could use past events as reference. He was on his own for this one, floating alone in an endless abyss of water.
Steve sighed, sitting down on one of the long benches by the office. Rumlow took a seat across from him.
“Do they know that?” asked Sam. “All they know is that Tony Stark dumped a mob man’s name on the internet; a name that the cops might have gotten hold of. Your story doesn’t line up; they compare some data, and boom. You’ll be thrown in the clink.”
Phil should have taken Steve up on his offer. Taken Clint away to some small town and started over. Leave this life and finally be safe. But he knows they’d never be safe. They’d always be running.
“But he is just a sweetheart, the girls and I all adore him. I keep telling him that we’d love to have him over – we all play bridge every Saturday night – but he always has plans.”
Falling out of the loop with The Captain and his crew could have devastating results, especially this far in the game. Power in numbers, right? With HYDRA on their tails, Tony couldn’t afford to be left in the dust. They were already steps behind HYDRA, if Tony fell out now, he’d find himself cornered. Because believe it or not, The Captain had resources that he didn’t. Sure, Tony could hack any mainframe, get a digital copy of almost anything, but every brain needs its brawn. This was HYDRA. The fact that they had already managed to survive their first massacre was enough proof that they wouldn’t be one to disappear again with a key simple stokes of a keyboard.
“No,” Natasha negated. “I wanted you to see my face when you died. I wanted you to know who beat you.”
Steve looked at him fondly. “Tony, I know you have JARVIS hack the cameras wherever we go. You know exactly how it went today.”
Tony hummed, breathing in the familiar scent. “Remind me to never make fun of you hiding in the vents ever again.”
“The first of many,” the man hissed. “Cut off one head and two more shall take its place.” Tony watched as the man’s tongue traced the inside of his mouth, before Tony heard a crack as the man bit down on something. “Hail HYDRA.”
Sure Clint was annoying as could be, with a childlike manner that always made Steve want to strangle the man by lunchtime. But Clint was a star; he’s always a shining beacon of hope. He never pities Steve when he finds himself down, just distracts him bad jokes and rough sparring sessions to save Steve from his own head.
Tony charged down the stairs and across the living area and bar, sprinting back up the entrance steps as quickly as he could. He didn’t know who was looking out for him, because he made it in the nick of time, reaching the top as Obie opened the door.
“Besides, I didn’t think I qualified. Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, and don't play well with others,” Tony said with a smirk.
Tony leaned away, rolling his eyes. “I could be convinced to take another one,” he responded, the hand not holding his mug trailing down Steve’s bare chest. “Or, if you’re up for it,” Tony added, “you could help me break in the hot tub.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, but didn’t give an answer. He couldn’t really blame Clint; they had been sitting out there for a while, and even Bucky was starting to get restless.
Blue eyes bored right into Tony’s brown. It was a way he’d never seen Steve look at him before. Steve always manage to keep him on his toes, going as far as getting Tony to blush as he was gazed at with an artist’s appreciation, but this was different. It was a more intense, a certain finality to it. Tony shivered but didn’t dare look away.
“Fury agreed to drop his charges,” Steve tried to smile. “But, since he was still involved with us, he still has to go into protection.”
His head was swimming and his body was throbbing, but Tony pulled his head away to take in his surroundings. It was dark, so Tony couldn’t really see the extent of the room they were in. He appeared to be laid up on a small cot, not much different than the one he had holed up in his lab at the speakeasy. While looking around, he caught sight of one of his hands, or at least, he thought so. It was so bandaged that it looked more like a snowball than a hand. He looked back at Yinsen, who shot him a sympathetic look, before looking down. But he wasn’t looking at Tony’s hands.
Bucky rubbed at his eyes. It didn’t matter. None of that mattered as long as he reminded himself that there would always be one person who knew he made the right call.
“How is this rash?” countered Natasha. “What the hell is wrong with you, Clint? This is a good thing. You guys didn’t get anything for Hammer, right?”
the heat sensors?” When Tony had told Romanov what warehouse to use, he spent the rest of the day rigging up the place. Each entrance was wired with heat sensors and top of the line cameras, able to spot anyone and anything that tries to get into the joint. Connecting the system to JARVIS and their phones, Tony and The Captain would know whenever someone laid their first steps on the property.
Steve and Tony arrived at the realization at the same time, both men struggling against their binds.
He didn’t hear Bucky approaching, but he didn’t startle at the question. It wasn’t surprising; Bucky had been around him long enough that no matter the blender of issues Steve had, he was always at ease with the other man near. It was if his body perceived Bucky as an extension of his own shadow.
But everything had been worth it; the long gash on his leg from tripping over a fence, the splinters in his hands from hiding in storage crates, his ruined clothes from tapping out some wayward flames. Everything was worth it when he saw Phil standing on his porch.
“Well we can’t just sit back and do nothing!” Sam shouted. “The reason he isn’t telling us is because he’s thinking about doing something stupid. We’ve been sitting on this too long; we need to act now.”
“I’m sorry, but that’s rich coming from the man that came all the way over here to stamp his feet and whine.”
“Yes, sir,” Steve called back. He slowly made his way back to his apartment, hands grasping the vial in his jacket pocket.
“I’m not saying that,” soothed Bucky. “We’re not gonna leave Steve to fend for himself; we can’t let him meet with Loki anymore. We don’t know what the bastard’s planning, so it’ll just be easier if we take precautions and just keep Steve away from him. All we gotta do is keep Steve occupied until Stark gets here; if the man isn’t here by the end of the week we’ll just go on without him.”
It didn’t matter, and she didn’t care. All she could feel was her roaring heartbeat and unbridled joy, as if she were back in Emily’s slippers completing her sur le cou-de-pied.
Tony shivered, snuggling further under the blanket he was given, his face the only thing peering out over the thin material. “I can try,” he grit out, wincing at the sound of his voice, which sounded no better than an ancient engine trying to start.
but it was like he was an addict that had gone too long from his next fix. Each breath, each gasp, each kiss. All he could feel was Steve. And it was never enough.
Steve leaned down and kissed his head, lips lingering in the soft locks. “I love you,” he whispered. “More than you could ever know.”
Tony thought he could finally die happy when Steve put a hand on his shoulder. “Thank you. I mean it.”
“That’s what you said when I was going to bed. I promise the armor will still be here when you get back,” Steve continued, pushing Tony towards the door. “Today’s a great day for a picnic in Central Park.”
“Which is why you’re still single,” another voice replied. Wanda stepped out from behind the next car, walking over to the two men. “You might look mature but as soon as you open your mouth, the women go running.”
Barnes caught it easily, inspecting the weapon right away. While Tony didn’t get a smile from the man, the nod of approval was more than Tony ever thought he was ever going to get. It must be Christmas.
Steve’s heart constricted at the tone. Somewhere, his mother was rolling over in her grave at the thought of Steve basically robbing the older generation. A harsh blare from his phone on his desk pulled the blonde from his thoughts, the man reaching for the tech on autopilot, blank look adorning his face.
I sure hope so. One million thanks again to everyone reading; you the real MVP. Remember, I'm always a sucker for comments! I'd love to hear what you think/want.
He looked down to see Tony staring back up at him, eyes glowing in the moonlight. He was wearing a soft sort of smile, one that looked like it was made for him and only him, and Steve couldn’t help but lean down and kiss it. Tony molded perfectly against him, as he always did, the brunette hitching a leg around to push closer into his mouth, Steve sliding a hand down his smooth back to rest on the curve of his ass in response.
The man closed his eyes, before nodding slowly. “You’re right, Buck. There are always other options.”
There were small signs that it would be, with Steve yelling at Bucky with a familiar crazed look in his eyes, pleading with him to find Tony. But soon after he collapsed unconscious, whether being from distress or the concussion he suffered in the blast. When Steve finally woke back up, it had taken him one look around the room for him to realize that Tony was still missing. And from then on, just silence. Deafening silence.
Steve watched in horror as they threw the hammer away, picking up a large machete instead. Ignoring the mangled mess that was Tony’s left hand, they stretched out his right, not even waiting for a command before cutting right below his wrist. Slowly.
“Yes, Sir,” Clint said with a sigh. He watched as Steve retreated, no doubt back to the back room, anyway from everyone.
Stark’s eyes blinked up at him slowly, the drugs already pulling him under. “Where you goin'?” he managed to slur out.
“Well, what do you suggest?” asked Clint. “Because Stark is our only ally left and he doesn’t seem to be much of a team player right now.”
Steve nodded, trying to understand. In the days following Tony’s injections, Bruce monitored him day and night, looking for any sort of imbalance, and sign of the dosage having a negative affect on Tony, but there had been nothing.
“There is something bugging you,” Steve confirmed dejectedly, sliding off Tony to rest next to him. “Is it because of all the lies I told you?” Steve said softly, plucking at the comforter, unable to meet Tony’s gaze. “I know what I did was wrong, but you have to know how sorry- ”
Soon, Steve found himself pulling up to base. Almost falling out of the car, Steve breathed deep when he found the building just as they left it.
That was, until the first donation hit. It was like hearing a forgotten melody or smelling his childhood home. It was like hearing his mother laugh again. A fragile hope that dangled in front of him like a carrot; a single drag was all it took, and Steve knew he was addicted, knew he would chase that feeling to the last drop, like an alcoholic to the bottom of a bottle.
He heard Clint utter a “yes, Mother,” but Bucky didn’t turn back. His shoes trumped through the snow as the harsh New York wind nipped at his neck. Bucky could only hope that Steve didn’t look out the window to see the tracks he left through the snow. It was already tense enough between the two of them; the last thing Bucky needed as Steve tearing him a new one yet again because he left the building. Hell, it was frustrating enough he couldn’t call Steve out for doing the same thing.
On the far wall, a box of light flickered on – a laptop sitting on a dusty table. Steve walked towards it warily, gun still at the ready, Natasha’s steps falling right behind his. He could see a small camera sitting right next to the laptop, whirring softly as it moved, tracking Steve’s movements.
Steve’s brain worked sluggishly, trying to piece together what hill was saying. “No, I did it. I think I would have noticed if I didn’t place it in time,” he hissed. “It wasn’t like I- ”
Natasha glanced at Rhodey. “The man’s a bomber. I’m not gonna give him time to prepare himself if we went through the front door and up the steps.”
Tony peeled his eyes open to see The Captain leaning over him with some pain killers and water in his hands. Tony took them gratefully, flicking a small smile to the blonde in thanks. The Captain smiled back easily, leaving Tony to fall into his desk chair, sighing heavily.
Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s hand, squeezing reassuringly. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’m here.”
Bucky found himself nodding in agreement. There were many times that Bucky wished Steve shared everything about the files with him. There was a subconscious part of him that was angry, jealous even, that Steve didn’t trust him enough to share his secret. But a larger part of Bucky knew that it wasn’t true. Steve trusted him with anything and everything – like not pestering him about his SSR secrets. The files were the last connection that Steve had with the SSR, the last link to the first family he had after his mom died. Maybe it was a sense of duty, maybe it was to honor the fallen that Steve continued to keep their secrets. Whatever it was, Bucky never questioned it, and was more than happy to sit back and help support the pieces of information that Steve did share.
“This isn’t it,” Steve said in return, walking past her to the back of the room. He stepped over to the back corner and over to a wall lined with dusty, unused shelves. “Look,” he added once Natasha caught up with him, pointing over to a long cobweb stretched between the shelves, a breeze making the silk fluttering slightly.
“Nothing.” His answer was strangled, his voice hoarse as he watched Pepper reach back into his chest with the new reactor. His heart clenched again, and Tony grit his teeth.
“Did I hit a nerve?" Loki chided. "Besides, you’ve brought him so far into this that it’s impossible to leave him out, don’t you think?”
“Cap!” Sam’s voice sounded, jogging up next to him. “All the floors below us are clear. Listen, I think we should- ”
“It’s too dangerous,” Steve argued, pushing himself further up the bed, his icepack falling onto the floor. Tony huffed, reaching down to pick it up, placing it back where it should be, resting on Steve’s knee.
Finally reaching the main gate, Tony was happy to find that Strange’s people had left the gate unlocked from when they entered. Tony walked back onto pavement, turning around to read the sign.
Tony was done with them. The Captain certainly hadn’t done any favors for Tony; he didn’t owe them anything.
“You can’t fool me,” said Steve, patting Tony’s back comfortingly. “Now come on, before the rush gets here.”
Steve glanced up, not enough to catch Tony’s eye, but enough to see his figure. The smaller man was pacing around the room, harshly wringing his hands with each turn. It was strange seeing Tony this way. Sure, Tony always seemed to have some flurry of movement about him – an explosion waiting to happen, the reaction barely contained behind bars, roaring inside like a furnace as he prowled around – but this was different. His movements were jerky, almost erratic, like a single cog was out of place in his assembly line, and the machine was still trying to function despite the broken part.
“Degrees, Steve. I have degrees,” Tony huffed with a roll of his eyes. “And what do you mean for once? I’ll have you know that- ”
Nick chuckled. “No, ma’am; got very specific orders for this one.” He handed her a small, heavy package. “I’m sure you can still sign for it, though.”
had her phone out before they left the store. Knowing Steve’s luck, it’ll be trending by later today.
“Jesus, Clint. Calm down, I’m not dead or anything.” Tony’s remark only made Clint sob harder. “Wait a second. Where the hell have you been?! Steve and I have been trekking all over this goddamn earth looking for you!”
By the time the medical team had gotten down to Tony, Steve was inconsolable. It had taken five agents to finally pull him away his husband, and even then, Steve spent the rest of the time trying to get back to him. While Sam had been helping him get a handle on his PTSD, Steve knew that there would be no way anything could save him from this nightmare: Tony lying motionless in a pool of his own blood as Steve sat and watched helplessly.
Tony huffed before stepping around The Captain and out the door. He saw Happy waiting outside with his car, ready to hand him his keys.
His head jerked up at the sound of Pepper’s voice. He tried to plaster on a smile. “Pep, what can I do for you?”
“Oh please,” Tony countered. “You should’ve thanked us. You probably filled up all the confessionals with all those women thinking about what you do in your space time. You could’ve gotten a lot of free dates.”
“What, did you stop for drive thru? Where the hell have you been?!” The door was barely open before Bucky was dragged inside by a frazzled Stark.
Clint breathed in a sigh of relief when he saw Bucky slip back through the back door. Of course, his lightened mood was quickly suppressed when he saw that his friend had come in alone.
Dress shoes slapped against the tiles and Steve just barely caught Tony sliding back into the kitchen. “Please tell me world needs saving. JARVIS?”
The Captain shook his head, shifting farther to the left to give Tony more room to sit. “Haven’t seen you in a few days. Any luck with Rumlow?”
“Oh god, Tony. You ok?” Steve reached down quickly, helping the man back up to his feet. Steve tried not to think about how warm Tony felt in his hands.
Maybe it was the fact that he was still holding on to Captain America’s hand. For an awkwardly long time. It wasn’t like the man who had been Tony’s favorite superhero/man crush was standing before him or anything. In the flesh.
Without giving them a second glance, she stepped out, trying to distinguish which way to go. A quick look down the hallway and Natasha was met with more bodies. Following the trail like bread crumbs, she finally stumbled onto a pair of double doors. She could hear murmuring on the other side.
Natasha snorted, leaning back against the door and letting gravity take her weight until she slid to the floor. She shivered slightly, the coolness of the tiles bleeding through her thin tights, but she didn’t bother moving. Whatever silence Natasha was hoping to get was shattered by the sound of sneakers squeaking across the linoleum.
his everything, and to have it thrown to the side like it was just a mild inconvenience disgusted him. “HYDRA is everyone’s problem," he seethed. "They’re not going to stop with The Commandos. It won’t be long until they start attacking other businesses. Businesses like Asgard.”
There were a few murmured 'Mr. Stark's', but Tony held up a hand, and the room once again fell silent.
Opening the passenger side door, Steve shoved the kid out onto the sidewalk. “Go home Schmidt,” he said shortly before tearing away to find the bus robber. He could hear the kid shout back to him, but Steve pressed on. The police had created a perimeter after the bus robbery, so there were only a few square blocks for the crook to have gone.
“Please,” Tony smiled. “Don’t make me laugh.” When Fury didn’t respond, Tony continued. “We done here? You can’t detain me without a charge.”
Sam put a hand on his shoulder. “Ok. I’ll keep this under the table for now. But Steve, the longer you keep this from Tony, the worse it will be when he finds out.”
While most would think of it as any ordinary name, in the mob world, it was anything but. If Hammer or The Monger caught wind of who The Captain really was, it would mean bad news for Pierce. It wouldn’t be long before one or both of them went to just snatch Rogers off the street before Pierce even had time to think about making a move. No, Steve Roger’s name was the only thing keeping Pierce in the game, the only thing keeping him in charge.
Steve walked into the kitchen before plopping down in the nearest chair, pushing his head into his hands.
“Like it’d matter,” Tony snorted. “The pair of them only believe in one interrogation technique: punch.”
The receptionist looked at Steve warily, but made the call upstairs anyway. The silence that followed was awkward, with Bucky tapping his foot on lightly against the hard tile, Steve biting his lip as he watched the employee talk with Pepper Potts.
Respecting Tony’s unspoken wishes, Steve claimed his mouth in a teasing kiss again, bringing Tony out of his bad memories. Steve broke the kiss with a quiet moan, as Tony cupped his erection through his pants.
Tony watched as Romanoff sidled over to the man, pulling a small bottle of smelling salts out of her back pocket. A quick whiff under the man’s nose, and he shot into consciousness, gasping for breath. He barely had time to take in his surroundings before Romanoff landed a sharp slap to the man’s face.
“Says the man who dragged me all the way out to this hellhole to ask a question he already knows the answer too.”
“Considering you just learned about S’mores today, I don’t think that you can pass judgement on how people eat them.”
There was a time for patience. A time for waiting, for planning the next move. To gather information, build a case. There was a time for justice. There was a time for a good man.
There, sitting in the middle of the room with the biggest shit-eating grin known to man, was Tony Stark.
“Sorry, dear,” Tony apologized, dropping a gentle kiss on Steve’s forehead. “Bucky will get you some pain killers.”
But then Phil was pulling away. Clint tried to protest, but Phil ignored him, looking back up the street.
After everything that had happened, and the man looked as if he didn’t give grief more than a second glance.
Steve snorted. “It took you a few hours to find my home base. Surely Tony Stark could figure out a measly phone number.”
“You look like shit. Who’d we accidently kill today?” Bucky’s amused voice trailed in to the kitchen.
Barnes huffed. “Yeah; guy was just like you. He came in with his suits and fancy words, and well, the rest is history.”
“Great,” Tony sighed, crossing his arms. “He’s going to leave me for a mutt.” He stepped around Steve and the dog, pointing a finger in Lucky’s direction when he followed Tony’s movements. “Don’t even think about it,” he said. “I will not be pulling your hair off of my clothes for the next three weeks.”
Steve was cut off when the door banged open and a police officer raced into the room. Sam was the first to react; he saw the uniform and had his gun drawn before the officer could even respond.
Tony knew what he had to do. There was no way that he could sit idly with this; he couldn’t burden this alone. Telling Steve was a must. But now, sitting hours later after the press conference, Tony knew that it was too late. He’d already made the wrong decision by walking out of that building without Coulson, and walking out with Steve none the wiser.
"Please," Obie snorted. "HYDRA isn't out there. It's just a scam started by the cops to keep the other mobs from running rampant in the streets."
Charging up the stairs, Steve held his breath and kept low to the ground, calling out every once in a while. While most of the patrons he found were unconscious, Steve was relieved to find that the worst injury looked to be a broken leg from falling debris.
right. Whenever he thought that he’d had enough, life had a way of reminding him that he wasn’t in charge. How the hell did it come to this?
“Ok, then. I’m heading home. Oh, you have a file from Fury as well.” She placed another file off to the side.
“What do you mean wait? I basically just said that I’m the Thelma to your Louise, and you want to wait?”
“It’s nice,” Tony continued. “We went there a few times when I was a kid. It’s all wooded, and there’s a private lake.”
find. Like Steve working for the SSR was his own triumph. I saw right past his bullshit; he was just using Steve for his own advances. Phillips gave Howard everything and anything he wanted as long as Steve did his job. As long as Steve was his dancing little monkey.”
It wasn’t long before heroes all over were plastered all over the papers. And not for the usual reasons.
Finally reaching State Street, Barnes tried to hit the brakes only to realize he didn’t have feet anymore.
Tony! He’s a serious threat and you know it,” responded Pepper. “I think we should call the authorities.”
Clint owed Steve everything; he knew he would spend the rest of his life trying to give as much back to the man who had saved him.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter. I've been getting a lot of messages about new readers, so welcome aboard! As always, write me any thoughts/ideas you have and I'll try my best to throw them in!
The store was small, and although it was luckily uncrowded, Tony pulled his arm close to his chest, hoping no one would notice the blood staining his jacket. His eyes darted around the room, not wanting to waste another precious minute, looking for tools. It wasn’t long before he found what he was looking for: a bag of sugar and some water bottles. Tony smiled, bundling the products in his arms. Just like college all over again.
“And I thought it was just another thing I would get used to because Jesus, Steve, I’ve been crying like crazy. I had to put my mask down for a bit yesterday because I just about bawled when I handed those kittens over. And sometimes it’s not all bad! Like last night –
Tony tried to stay nonplussed, but he knew he was failing miserably, his frantic heartbeat a dead giveaway. He always saw Barnes as a threat, but
“It matters because you,” Fury replied, pointing to Steve, “claim that all the files are in hard copies. Unless you’re lying- ”
Tony shook his head, hands balled into fists at his sides. Maybe he shouldn’t have come home. Everything was too close, he needed air, he needed-
Clint nodded, biting his lip. “I told him what happened. He said nothing’s changed at his end. Pierce still doesn’t know about him.”
“Steve, come on, man.” He heard Sam dash in front of him, blocking his path. “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
Tony held up a finger. “Patience is a virtue.” He walked against the far wall, towards an old metal cabinet. Without even pausing, Tony grabbed the edge of the cabinet, swinging it open with practiced ease, the cabinet disgusing that fact that it was nothing more than a hidden entryway. A solid door, one seemingly fit for a bunker entrance, stood before them, complete with a keypad and thumb scanner. Tony placed his thumb on the screen, a green light appearing followed by the sound of the door being unlocked. “This is a new addition, of course,” Tony continued, nodding to the scanner, as he opened the door. “But this is the 21
Tony sighed, obviously frustrated. Steve had heard it many a time before while he was on the phone with the board or in front of some quack interviewer, the meaning ranging from ‘
“I told you the SSR started back in the war,” Steve responded. “No better place to start collecting info than inside the United States Army.”
“Over?” Obie hissed in return. He charged his gauntlets, shooting a beam over towards Tony, the man barely able to dodge in time. “Thirty years I’ve been holding you up!” he screamed, shooting another blast. Tony wasn’t so lucky that time, the force of the explosion sending him to his feet. “I built this company up from nothing!
Finding his way back to Manhattan took a little more effort than he thought. After getting back on a main road, Tony found himself somewhere in the backwoods of Brooklyn. Of course, having lived in Manhattan all his life, he had no inclination of which direction he was going. This ended with Tony driving in circles and having to resort to ask some old broad for directions.
Bucky shook his head again. “He doesn’t know who he is, but we’re willing to bet any money that Steve doesn’t know about Loki’s other rendezvous.”
Tony made a questioning noise, only then looking down to where Steve had two fingers scissoring out of him. Tony nodded, mesmerized at the movement of the digits. The introduction of the third finger had him hissing, the dull ache of his entrance becoming more pronounced as Steve tried to make room for another thick finger.
For a slight moment, Natasha could see a flash of uncertainty on Pierce’s face, the man finally coming to terms with his situation. “Fine,” the man finally grit out, arm holding the governor throwing the terrified man to the floor. Natasha waited for him to drop the gun as well, but he didn’t the weapon coming up to stare her in the face. “It may be over for me, but the least I can do is send Rogers home with another body bag.”
Yes, Stark had to be taken care of. Immediately. Normally Pierce would just result to Hammer for these sorts of things, but Stark was a wily one. He had been dodging Hammer for years; Pierce needed him dealt with now.
Fury cut him off. “I remember that kid. And I know you. I know who you would make sacrifices for. And I know that Bucky is deep within that circle. Let me show you how much I know you.”
Steve opened his eyes long enough to see the red that dripped down onto the charred ground below him. Taking a shaking and already cut up hand, Steve dragged it across his head only for it to come back more bloody. Trying to move his aching body was futile as well; the jarring movement shot pain coursing through his body, almost causing him to lose consciousness again. Steve looked around, but saw nothing but endless walls of fire and smoke, threatening to close in around him.
Heart pounding, he took a step back, Carl falling out of his arms and onto the ground. “Oh my god,” he whispered, already reaching for his phone. He scrambled to type in the number, before remembering that he should run to cover, in case another shot rings out.
The long silence’s that Barnes provided were comforting to a point, but Tony was almost manic, desperate for conversation. Anything to keep his mind off the speakeasy. Anything to distract him from the thought of Steve calling Clint into his office, sitting him down and letting him know that they’d failed him again.
Tony furrowed his brow, before standing up from his desk to intercept Barnes. “Back in the gym, you said you’ve seen men like that before. You were talking about my father, weren’t you?”
Pierce led Stane down a maze of hallways, towards the back of the prison. Their walk was silent, but for once, Pierce couldn't detect any lingering tension in the air. It was something he'd always admired about Pierce; the man was exceptionally ruthless once he had a certain goal in mind. But that was what he needed to do to survive as a business man - always playing the game, changing between allies and foes and then back again, all to just stay one step ahead of everyone else. Once they finally reached their destination, Pierce flashed a quick signal to the camera watching them, the green light blinking red as Pierce's men cut the connection.
his mother had whispered into his ear as they hugged in the airport. He remembered her tiny hand pressing down over his heart.
“Tony? Come on, it’s late. Let’s go home, ok? You know I didn’t mean what I said. Look, I miss you. Peter misses you, right buddy?”  Steve looked down at his son, who offered a few small coos, but Tony still didn’t respond.
“I didn’t say that. It’s just,” Steve sighed, “nothing’s working. I can’t sit around and wait while HYDRA continues to destroy New York. I’m getting desperate; I need to protect the family I have left.”
not eye,” he said, pointing at a sign. Steve followed Tony’s finger, catching a glimpse at a sign for the upcoming town.
Steve should have known better. Should have taken bigger precautions with Stark. Now one of his men was down. Steve never meant for that to happen. He just hoped to God that Hogan survived the blast. A threat for Tony Stark was nothing to be trifled with. Steve would have his crew pull back for a few days, just in case. If HYDRA was rising into power again, the last thing he needed was his crew fighting a battle on both sides, trying to hold the line against the nefarious crew and Stark as well.
“Why is this important?” Tony asked. “With the number of files that the SSR collected over the years, it would make sense that Pierce would put them on an electronic platform. He could keep them on his person at all times, and it would be way easier to sort and organize all of the information he collected.”
a deadly whisper on the streets. Whenever dealing with some of their more gruesome foes, The Captain would always send Barnes in to… eradicate the problem. People said that if you ever managed to survive an encounter with The Captain’s top dog, you ended up feeling like death anyway. They say facing off against him is like facing the Grim Reaper himself; his cold, empty eyes and threatening words enough to turn your veins to ice from fear alone.
Tony sighed, glaring at the door in front of him, the shining plaque with the word ‘Principal’ blazoned on the front just another reminder on how he was failing as a parent. Shaking his head, he straightened his tie before pushing the door open, taking in the other occupants of the room.
He watched as Tony’s form slipped into the water, turning only to curl a finger at Steve beckoning him closer. It was impossible to disobey. Steve raced up the steps of the tub, eagerly taking his first step into the warm oasis. The water burned up his body as he kept going deeper, and Steve couldn’t help but close his eyes and relish the heat.
Tony wanted to strangle the man. Who does The Captain think he is, talking to Tony like he was some amateur? Like he has no idea what he’s getting himself into. It made his blood boil. It had been a long time since anyone had talked to him like that. Even when he was young, gangly limbs still filling out his awkward body Tony had stood head tall and teeth bared in both the classroom and the boardroom. In the public eye, even the private. Everyone always praised how much he was like Howard in that regard. Little did they know, he'd gotten that way not because of Howard teaching him, but from the man leading the attack against Tony himself. Maybe that had been his plan all along. That was his parenting style, survival of the fittest.
Barnes just snorted, looking down at the red splatters that covered his torso and arms, unable to see the few dustings of blood that also streaked across his face. “Let’s go with that,” he replied, slipping around Tony to start the sink, sticking his hands under the stream to watch the dark rivulets drip into the basin and down the drain.
Stark steeped his head in his hands. “They’re Hammer’s right?” When Natasha nodded, he continued. “Was he buying or selling?”
"As per requested, I searched for CCTV footage in Brooklyn for facial recognition. I was able to track your movements back to inner Brooklyn, but not much father than that."
“It’s some storage facility," he explained, pointedly not thinking about how the larger man seemed to fit perfectly behind him, the scent of fresh laundry filling Tony's nose as a head leaned over his shoulder. "JARVIS found other access points, and is still working on them, but this one doesn’t fit. There shouldn’t be a computer that could hack the Joseph Grant file in some run down facility like that.”
The man sent Clint a blank stare. He was dressed casually, thick work pants with flannel that would make him as distinguishable as every other man in the surrounding 100 miles. His stance, however, always gave away his hand. The air of superiority followed him with every step, his gait firm and practiced.
Hammer balled his hands in his fists, repressing the urge to kill the frightened man in front of him.
“If you’re going to sit there and insult the sanctity of the American cheeseburger, then you can get the hell out,” Tony snapped.
“Wilson, please tell me you need me anywhere but here,” Barnes said as he answered the phone, pressing the device up to his ear. “If you could just see the shit that I’m dealing wi-
Where I become you? Not a chance.” Steve flung his shield at the truck, leaving a dent just inches from Rogers head. The shield quickly rebounded back into Steve’s hands.
A man slipped his lanky fingers through a greasy mop of hair. He tightened his grip on his package as he waited for the elevator.
“I do need those secrets, but now I know that I don’t need you,” The Skull responded, edging closer to Steve. “The SSR had been around since World War II. That’s a lot of information to have collected over the years, don’t you think? And you remember it all?”
Tony reluctantly pulled his eyes away from the staring contest he was having with the coffee machine, watching as Barnes slipped into the kitchen.
Bucky sat up and scooted closer to Steve. “Maybe Tony was right,” Bucky murmured, mostly to himself. “Did you hit your head yesterday?”
Steve spun around to be faced with Natasha. “Natasha, hi! I wasn’t- I mean, I was just- ” he broke off with a huff.
“No need to be insulting,” Tony huffed. “The only worry here is if you can keep it hidden during your spot checks.”
“We can’t,” Bucky disagreed. “We show him these photos and he’s gonna know immediately who we got them from.”
Steve must have found the bedroom eventually, because Tony felt himself shift from the comfort of Steve’s arms and onto the soft mattress. He barely had time to whine out a protest before the blonde was climbing in after him, pulling the blankets around the both of them. “Sleep,” Steve muttered, lips pressing against the underside of his ear, as he bundled Tony into his arms.
He froze when he heard Tony step behind him and clear his throat. Sighing softly, Steve pushed back from under the desk, leaning back on his knees. There, standing above him, was Tony, snickering as he twirled the pencil between his fingers.
“Steve!” Clint shouted down the stairs, all while charging into the office. He raised his gun up, just in case, but it proved useless as the office was empty of Loki as well. He had definitely been in there, however. Steve was always a bit of a neat freak, but now, papers were strewn about his desk, some of the drawers opened.
really, but Steve listened to every word, taking in every second with the man that he loved. Eventually Tony dropped off to sleep, curled into Steve’s chest.
Instead, Sam listened to the father’s lies and false promises. How he was starting a charity in his son’s name. To help with families that were separated by the war. At the time, Sam had been so proud, so happy to know that Riley could still be helping people beyond the grave.
Bright pain shot up his side as they landed one floor down, but it was ignored by the fire radiating from his leg. Zola had shot him. Bucky was up in a flash, yanking Steve to cover when he saw Zola lean over the bridge above them. Steve twisted, Bucky stumbling under him as another shot went off, this one burying deep into his side.
But that left Pierce with a problem. He had been the only one to know of The Captain’s real identity:
Clint pushed him back with enough force to send Tony flopping fully onto his bed. “You look like you would make it about ten feet. Just use this one; I don’t have any use for it.”
She didn’t tell him until it was too late – maybe it had always been too late. To this day, he still wasn’t sure if it was a blessing or a curse that he has managed to be by her side when she took her last breath. She was gone. And well, if she couldn’t keep her promise, then why the hell did Steve?
It was Sunday, and Steve found himself on the same bench in front of the same grave. Fresh tears spilled down his cheeks as his mind toiled with a familiar darkness.
He couldn’t get it out of his head. The killer in their midst. The wolf in sheep’s clothing. He found himself manic, desperately searching for clues he knew weren’t there. When he was working, he constantly had an earphone in, listening to previous episodes and the callers they had on the air. When he wasn’t working he was on his laptop, scrolling through the open forum on their website, trailing back months and months, looking for anything and everything that said:
“Pepper, it was from someone who can spell Bruce Banner. You know that this couldn’t have been him.”
“Don’t you fucking think about. Don’t even look at my ride. I’ll put a cap in your ass so fast if I see you by my baby again.” The hobo took off running. “Yea, that’s right, you better run!”
“Now you listen to me, punk. You gotta get a grip, Stevie. You’re starting to slip; people are getting worried.”
“No,” Tony answered slowly. “We drove through the night after Sam’s, so if anything, we’re ahead of schedule- ”
Steve swallowed down a fresh stream of tears. He had failed before; like hell he was going to let it happen again. They took Peggy from him, but not again.
Barnes bit his lip, looking away. If Tony had to guess, he was just as confused at Wilson’s message of Steve’s favor. “Fine,” he relented. “We’ll figure this shit out, then get you in bed.”
“It better not, or you’ll owe me a lot more of these,” Obie laughed hollowly, shaking his empty glass.
He idled back over to the couch and sat down, facing the window. His troubled thoughts were soon subdued over the familiar scratching on pencil against paper.
Thank the Lord. They're finally reunited. Thanks for being less of a dick and finally showing some humanity, author.
Steve Rogers hunkered down in far part of an alley, watching as Tony Stark escaped from him for a second time. His large hands cradled his head that was still pounding from the explosion and the added bonus of Stark's fist.
Steve shuddered before standing up, scanning the room. Nothing out of the ordinary; just a bleached white room filled with the soft breathing of Tony’s bodyguard.
Stark didn’t answer, but by the way that he pressed his phone up to his ear again and biting nervously on his thumbnail was answer enough. Of all the times for Steve to not answer his phone. Bucky itched to reach down and pull his own out to dial his friend, a fake semblance of hope that maybe Steve would pick up for him. But Bucky knew it was no use; if what Sam said was happening was actually happening, then the tunnel vision would have already engulfed him by now, and Steve wouldn’t be answering until he needed too.
Tony felt the man stiffen, his arms almost locking around the brunette. Tony could feel his heartbeat quicken against his own chest, almost hearing the gears churn in The Captain’s head as he tried to comprehend what Tony had said. He finally pulled away from Tony, his wide eyes locking instantly with Tony, mouth opening before snapping shut again.
Tony bit his lip, playing idly with their joined fingers. “If you could back in time, but still know everything you knew now, would you do it?”
Turns out the deadly duo of Barnes and Barton run that play all the time. Whenever Steve needs info on another mob, the two pounce, relying on the weaker minds of their enemies. Barnes scouts ahead, cornering and killing one of the easy targets. Then Barton swoops in, cleans the body of anything useful, like a handkerchief, a ring, or in this case, a fake tooth that they had kept from Rumlow. Anything to use as proof for the opposite gang. See, Barton, being raised in the circus, was taught that “seeing is believing.” A pair of deft hands and some slippery language was all Barton needs to convince anyone he was a double agent. Barnes and Barton let themselves get caught in the middle of a firefight, Barton guns the other down, and begins his interrogation process. Turns out that Barton supposedly belongs to over twelve different mobs, and Barnes has died a lot more times that anyone knew about.
What would he tell Bucky? What could he tell him? Steve himself wasn’t even sure what was the matter. Maybe it was the fear of unwillingly becoming the cheese in the middle this game of cat and mouse. Or maybe it was the fear that it wasn’t unwilling; that it was anything but.
“I think it’s safe to assume that HYDRA’s cleared out the rest of the locations. I need you here to keep doing your job – to keep him from doing something stupid.”
by him. And every damn day, he watched when his dad return home, a smile plastered on his face until he saw Tony. The man would berate him in every way imaginable, Howard loving nothing more than listing all of his flaws, showcasing how he always managed to fall short to the unattainable Steve Rogers. And when he was alone again, crawling back in his lab to lick his wounds in private, he would be right back where he started - with his mind wandering to the relationship his father had with the unknown man. He always wondered what his dad ever said about him to his work colleagues - the man always made it clear enough to Tony why he was never worthy to see that side of the business. But what spite did he spew for the SSR? Was it the same, or did Howard save the worst of it for his chums? Did they agree with him? They must have, if no one ever trusted him to be involved in that world. But to hear that from Steve, to hear that he was so unwanted that he wasn't even a single thought in his Howard's mind? That he wasn't even worth his own father's disappointment?
Obie rolled his eyes. “Tony. These are military contracts. They don’t take deals like this lightly. They want to see the man who designs their weapons, not the guy who does the paperwork. I already told them you were coming, so I suggest you make yourself presentable,” he finished, frowning down at Tony’s sopping wet suit.
“Please tell me it’s safe to come in,” Tony continued. “I could feel your neighbor staring at me the whole time I was outside, and I think she was just a few minutes away from putting together a hex bag of bird bones and rail tails to curse me.”
he thought to himself. He heaved out a heavy sigh and crept over to him desk, sitting in his own chair silently.
By the time he returned to Steve’s room, Bruce and the others had cleared out, leaving only a scowling Barnes on the floor next to his friend. Of course, wrapped up in blankets like a burrito made Barnes look more like a sad, wet puppy than a pissed gangster. Since Barnes didn’t respond when he entered the room, Tony broke the silence.
Tony watched The Captain roll his eyes, a small smile gracing his face. “Have a crush already, do we, Stark?”
“Well, for one, we can’t go through with this job.” Steve ignored the resounding groans he got from the other occupants in the room.
“You’ve been alive this whole time and what – didn’t think to stop in and say hi?” Tony fumed. “Do you realize what you’ve done to us, to
Tony groaned. “No. Absolutely not. What the hell are they gonna do, Pep? They’re just gonna get in the way. Quit worrying; We’ll do what we always do. Lay low for a little while and then pay the big man off. See? Problem solved.”
In fact, the kitchen remained mostly unused, Tony only slipping in for coffee, using the same mug day in and day out. JARVIS automatically starts his brew when he wakes so it is ready by the time Tony heads down the stairs. For the past ten days, JARVIS had been pouring him decaf, in silent protest. Tony had finally muted the bothersome AI, and JARVIS was left to strike back in the only way he still could. Tony didn’t mind; he could barely taste the coffee anyway.
But sex was different. Tony was always around the next morning. It was something that Steve and Bucky always secretly looked forward too, even sometimes more than the sex the night before, especially after Pepper had seen Tony stumbling out of their bedroom with them one morning, after they’d first gotten together.
“You mean whether or not we should order in?” Steve prodded. Tony nodded slowly even though Steve’s tone already confirmed that he was wrong. “That conversation? The one we had because it was dinner time? You know, last night?”
And then Phil’s arms were around him again, arms that Clint welcomed. He burrowed further into Phil’s warmth, losing himself in the security of the familiar embrace.
The doors opened smoothly, and Tony stepped out onto their floor, making his way left. Steve and Bucky followed slowly, a pair of lions stalking their next meal.
From the look on Clint’s face, Steve knew that Natasha had probably just ripped him a new one. Knowing her, he might actually have to send Clint back to medical.
After all these years, Howard still plagued his thoughts, his actions. And after years and years of defying the man - even after he was long dead in the ground - he still managed to be right. Tony had gotten involved. He had fallen for The Captain's smooth words and bright smiles. He had fallen for
While Steve had gotten considerably closer with the other members of his team (even on first name basis with Natasha, thank you very much), Steve had seen very little of Tony ever since their first encounters. It didn’t surprise Steve. Despite the fact that Tony owned the building, the man was constantly working, another trait that he got from his father. There always seemed to be a new file in his hand every day, coffee mug in the other, as Tony flited in and out of the common floor.
Pietro crossed his arms, jutting out his lower lips. “Other kids get sent to the principal all the time.”
It was his pictures. The ones from his wall in his old office. Every newspaper clipping, every candid photo, every scribbled doodle. Everything.
A hand pushed him back down onto the mound of pillows. His chest heaved in short pants as he tried to breathe around the pain. His chest ablaze, as if hot coals were dancing around on his insides.
I would love nothing more than to jam this hammer into your skull and watch the light leave your eyes, but I’ve got a better idea. You’re going to go back to Hammer and tell him everything that happened today; tell him how you failed. And then tell him this:
If anyone found out, they wouldn’t hesitate to just shove him out the door. Clint wouldn’t let that happen. He needed to be there for his family.
“So am I,” Steve responded, but ripped the foil to slip the condom on anyway. “But it’s your first time. Condom stays on.”
Pierce rubbed a hand down his face. “I don’t have time to play games with you. I’m too busy trying to clean up the mess that you created.”
Steve smiled, unable to pull the man into a hug. “Take care of yourself, Sam,” he whispered. “Make sure Pierce gets put in the ground. For the family.”
His crew mate blinked up at him, gasping for breath as he tried to form words. “Jesus. What the hell happened to you? Where are the others?” Drumm continued, running up to his injured friend.
Tony shook his head, rubbing at his eyes with his hand. It was that kind of thinking that got him in that situation in the first place. How the hell did he end up like this? Tony used to pay people to go out and get shot for him. Now here he is, sitting on some ratty couch in the boondocks of Brooklyn, nursing his own bullet wound.
“See,” Fury started, standing up to pace around the room. “If you would have told me that two months ago, I would have believed you. Now, however, is a completely different story.”
“Maybe we should shack up here for the night, get some rooms,” Bucky said, eyes blazing. “I’m sure we’re all beat.”
Now Steve was just another name, but this? Tony looked back down at the sketch of his father. A simple name of Steve wasn’t just any other name anymore. Tony’s heartbeat escalated once again, feeling his brain take off in a torrent, processing the new information.
Stark nodded, placing his head in his hands.  “I know. This waiting around isn’t doing me any favors either. We could try and draw them out again?”
“I need to get to the office, but I seem to be on house arrest. I need you to find me a way out of here.”
Steve yanked Tony into his chest again. “They can’t kill me. It’ll disrupt the future too much. But you? No one will have a problem killing you. Take the car. I’ll distract them long enough for you to get away. Go north, out of the city. Hide in the countryside until I come find you.”
Delmar had given them nothing. Just the usual ‘Hail HYDRA’. Just enough to ruffle their feathers. But he had trained for this. He wouldn’t let the rest of the organization down. The Avengers would get nothing from him.
“Shut your mouth,” Steve hissed. He'd heard this threat from Loki before; and after this nearly fatal meeting with the Red Skull, it was clear that Tony definitely wasn't safe. But any remember of that fact set fire through his veins.
“I can’t remember my mom’s face. She died when I was young. I just know she used to run her hands through my hair. Like this.” Steve grabbed Natasha’s hair, and pushed them into his blonde locks.
had told The Captain not to worry. Now he and his right hand men were about to walk into a blood bath.
Steve lowered his shield. Just then, his target showed up. Startling, Steve stared at the man in front of him. Unlike the others, this man was not bound, and there was no cover on his head. He stared back up at Steve, with the same steely blue eyes.
“But he was an asset!” Pierce hissed. “With Stark gone off in the wind, The Captain is keeping his cards close to his chest again. The people he considers his family are the only things to draw him out of his cave, now. I could have used him.”
With unyielding force, Thor brought the hammer down on the poor man’s fingers, the blow crushing each one before moving on to the next one. It was brutal; the man’s screams barely were barely muffled by the gag, but Steve never flinched once. This was just the beginning.
Across the room – well, what was left of it – was Iron Man, holding up part of a collapsed ceiling, over his head. But that wasn’t what had stopped them in their tracks. No, it was the fact that Tony, who was
“Do we need to be somewhere?” Steve asked while glancing over at Bucky, the other man just as clueless.
You’re gonna do this now?!” Bucky’s voice carried over the boxes, stopping the two men from arguing.
Steve saw worth, saw what counted. He didn’t ask about their past, just like they didn’t ask about his. They just
Clint marched back up the stairs, eyes scanning for anything missing. Who knows how long Loki had run around in here before taking off? And now he knows where they’re stationed. A sharp pang hit Clint in the chest. If Loki knew where the speakeasy was located, that meant that they’d probably have to move again. Clint sighed. He thought they'd finally found a place worthy of calling home again.
over to Sam. Steve agreed, and sent a reassuring smile Sam’s way. He had no doubt that Natasha could take care of herself, but they were stronger in numbers. He sure as hell didn’t trust Fury to pull something on the fly – much like he was planning on doing. Pairing up was the best way for all of them to watch each other’s backs.
Most of SI’s main floor had been blasted, the glass walls shattered. He could see FBI agents sheltered behind cars for cover, each popping a few shots off at an unseen target. “Hey!” Tony yelled.
“Do you think Tony looks better in blue or red?” Steve asked instead, changing the subject, looking back down at the neat rows of stacked product.
Tony looked over at Steve, but the blonde bit his tongue, gesturing for Tony to continue. “It looks me so long to notice, because I binge all the time. I mean, you know that I don’t keep normal hours and when I’m in the middle of something, I can be down here for days, but even I realized it was starting to get out of hand.”
Rogers moved to exit the library, when a sharp pain to his hand stopped him. Looking down, he saw an arrow scar forming on his left hand, pointing farther up his arm.
When the two finally locked eyes, Clint could barely get a word out before he was crushed into Phil’s chest. Clint could only hold on, shaking fingers grabbing at the front of his uniform as he pushed his face into Phil’s neck. His ears didn’t catch anything from Phil’s mouth, but the feeling of hot tears that stung across his neck had Clint grasping Phil tighter.
“But then the war ended – soldiers came home, treaties were signed, and America tried to pick up the pieces and move on. It wasn’t long before everyone realized that the mobs weren’t in charge anymore. The law struck back, and gangs were forced back into the shadows. In order to survive, the SSR evolved. Changing from an info center to a mock government agency. By that point, they’d amassed enough respect with the local groups that they were able to take charge and make some suggestions. Mafias realized that they couldn’t fight a battle on both fronts, so an unspoken agreement was formed – each mob would stay out of each other’s way, letting each run their own business, so they’d only have to worry about the law, and not another gang ready to backstab you in the alley.”
It was all too easy to call Rumlow in for some “routine inspection” on his fake tooth. Take the tooth off, inspect and replace the cyanide. But, instead of giving him back the old one, Pierce gave Rumlow The Mongers version. Same fake tooth, same cyanide, but with a small addition. A small transmitter, a bug, easily hidden within the poison.
Sam shrugged. “But we knew that. Steve met with Loki the first time you went to go see Stark. This isn’t exactly anything new.”
Steve’s heart pounded, blood rushing through his veins. This wasn’t right. Skull was dead; Schmidt was dead. He’d seen it with his own eyes. Right? Was there anyone else that could have brought HYDRA back from the grave? Who better to do it than a man who was also supposed to be dead?
Bucky’s chest clenched, already picturing the pair of them walking back out the door, leaving him behind.
Tony’s eyes swiveled over the room that had housed him for the past week. Well, he’d been told it had been just over a week. Tony was out for most of it, but figured Yinsen had no reason to lie about it. It wasn’t much; Tony could only surmise that they were underground from the dirt that was packed in to make the floor. The ceiling was constantly leaking; rusty water dripping into buckets, the sound no doubt going to eventually drive Tony insane. He and Yinsen were currently sitting in the far corner, in front of an empty barrel that someone jerry-rigged into a fire pit. Tony had seen a vent on the ceiling, so he could only pray that they wouldn’t die of oxygen deprivation. Besides, if they’ve been down there for as long as Yinsen said they had, then if lack of oxygen were a problem, they’d be long dead by now. Other than the ancient lawn chairs that were probably scavenged from the dump, and the two lumps that were barely passing as cots, the room was empty.
Steve’s eyes snapped open, looking back at The Skull and the muzzle of the gun, which was aimed at him feet.
“Don’t,” Tony snapped in response. “I don’t wanna hear anything from you. Or you for that matter,” he continued, pointing at Steve. “I just want to sit here and enjoy my soup and the lovely view.”
More shots echoed throughout the building. Zola had brought reinforcements. He looked back to where Bucky had taken his own cover, dipping out only to fire a few shots. He wouldn’t have enough ammo. Not enough to fight off the men that Zola had with him, especially with the guns that they were using. He needed to get Bucky safe.
Stark always had to insert his opinion when Loki was brought up. Always had a quip and jest ready to go. It was constantly matched with the archer’s sarcastic wit. Even the Captain lets out a few chuckles here and there.
“Alright, no need to get sappy,” Tony admonished, shifting around on the mattress. “Hop to it, soldier,” he added, gesturing to Steve. “Let’s see what all the rage is about.”
“This was a professional hit. The attack was aimed at me, and they’re using my people to get to me. I’m not going to sit idly by and let that happen,” Tony snapped.
Tony groaned inwardly. What the hell was he doing? Four days ago the man sitting in front of him could have potentially ended his life, and now Tony was giving away business advice? He rubbed at his temples, trying to get a handle on the raging storm in his head.
“Then I’ll say it. Was any of it real? Or was I just an added bonus for blondie over there?” Stark snapped.
I took a step back, took some time off, but I'm back now. I can't promise the same weekly updates as I am just getting back in the swing of things, but I can promise that I will not be giving up on this work.
A few resounding groans echoed through the room. “That’s just great,” drawled Barton. “HYDRA has their hooks in everyone.”
Rogers thought, looking down at the still body. Rogers forced himself to keep going. This was for a better cause. This was for the future. This was for Peggy.
Clint nodded before slinging his arms over Tony’s shoulders, assuming his usual position. He made sure Clint was secure before blasting up into the sky.
Steve was surprised that it was the little things that hit him the hardest as he tried to adjust to the new century.
Tony looked away, opting to play with Steve’s fingers instead. “There was a bomb,” he started. “I used it to my advantage.”
Tony let the woman walk past him and into his house. Looking back out into the woods, he couldn’t see Steve, but Tony knew he was out there. Seeing that the woman had already made her way into Tony’s kitchen, Tony thought it safe enough for him to leave the door open.
It was about a few weeks later when he heard a small chirp. He had taken to keeping his smuggled phone on his bedside table, despite the red flags surrounding the contraband. He knew he shouldn’t keep it in plain sight, regardless of how incompetent his FBI handler was, but he couldn’t seem to put it down. It became a part of him, a lifebuoy that got him through each passing day.
Tony nodded. “It’s better than taking a chance with your crew. Not to mention the early Christmas bonus you’d be getting.”
“It’s alright, Sam,” she soothed the man, grabbing his arm and squeezing it in an iron grip. The man relented immediately, letting her lead him back to Fury’s office. “What floor are we on?” she asked quietly.
Turning around, he pulled Tony flush against his chest. Looking down at him, he was greeted with the same warm, honey eyes that he loved so much.
Clint let himself be pulled up and dragged into the next room. He watched as Natasha walked over to a sleeping Bucky, swaddled in blankets on an old couch, whiskey bottle in his one hand. She pushed her fingers through his hair softly, brushing a small kiss across his forehead. “How is he?”
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony slowly, hands grasping either side of Tony’s face to keep him from moving, savoring each second their mouths were connected. Tony gave everything he could, wholeheartedly. He would give anything to Steve if he asked. Nothing was rushed, as it was just moments before, the pair of them getting lost in the other, as if they had all the time in the world.
Hammer had felt nothing but unease. While he should have been happy that Stark’s own business partner was out for him, Hammer knew that Stane would just be another road block on his journey to be the top weapon’s dealer in New York.
Tony saw Pietro’s shoulders slump in relief, the rest of the family replicating the action as Sam Wilson walked through the door.
Then, something was grabbing his shoulder, and Tony’s eyes snapped wide open in fear. There, in front of him, stood Rhodey, bloody and beautiful.
In retrospect, Tony thought as he found himself waking up again on his cot, he should have come up with a more diplomatic answer. Shifting slightly, he felt the dampness of his skin and instantly turned to his side, throwing up whatever bile remained in his stomach. Tony shuddered, not really knowing if he should count himself lucky he didn’t remember the waterboarding this time. It was bad enough the first time, in the warehouse. How no matter how much he struggled, how much he screamed in protest, there was nothing but the silence and the water.
But it kept happening. Just whispers, warnings to The Captain and The Commandos. HYDRA was coming back for them. Steve never blinked an eye. Until last week.
His stomach grumbled, and he sighed. If his grocery trip had been successful, he’d have started to make his morning dinner. He thought of the noodles Bucky had mentioned, but Steve decided against it, opting to snag an apple from the fruit bowl on their kitchen table.
Upon reaching home, Steve headed for the shower. Rinsing off quickly, Steve returned to his room, dressing for the club.
Steve stared down at the picture, zooming in on the picture, eyes pouring over each corner. It didn’t look like anything was missing. Each of the sketches remained undisturbed, staring back at him in their rightful place.
They’d done it, and Steve got to wake up every morning and remind himself that it wasn’t another life.
. Suddenly, Steve was back in the ice, but this time, he was on the other side, watching as Tony screamed, his mouth open side at is searched for air. There was no time to think anymore. Steve didn’t care.
“You should have shot me when my back was turned,” he snarled, pressing his gun harder against the governor’s head, the man sobbing lowly.
"And thank you, for making everything as difficult as possible," Tony snarked back, hanging up the phone before he could get another response.
Natasha sighed. They were no closer to getting to Loki’s scepter. The boys’ usual ‘let me prove how manly I am by berating you to a pulp’ interrogations were proving fruitless.
Seemed a bit early for hallucinations, but hey, Tony wasn’t complaining. Not when it was Steve’s voice. He felt his legs finally give out, the brunette slumping against the wet tiles. Whatever. So, he was probably dying. Even still, he kicked some ass while doing it. Steve would be proud.
Here was the next part of his day, where he wasted time by looking in each direction, pondering on how he would waste his time today. Each corner of the house offered him some semblance of solace, but Tony could never find himself able to get lost in anything.
When Hammer had been approached by Stane to ditch Pierce now that they could find The Captain’s identity, Hammer had found himself between a rock and a hard place. Regardless of Tony Stark, Stane was still a competitor in the world of weapons manufacturing. In the end game, they would still be enemies. Also, with the backing of both HYDRA and the NYPD, Pierce was someone Hammer was not ready to make an enemy. But, Stane had the US military wrapped around his finger; messing around with Army’s main benefactor probably wouldn’t play out in his favor either.
Barton snorted. “How the hell did you pass Stark’s interviews? You know he does fifty billion background checks on everyone. You wouldn’t have made it past hacking skills; he would have found you out in a minute flat.”
But there was nothing - he couldn't sketch the faces of the man that took them, he couldn't remember what guns they were using, what accents they had. He couldn't picture anything. That was, except for Tony's blood on the floor, his moans as he was beaten, his stuttering breaths as he gasped for a full breath. His soothing words as his lips moved across his skin.
Steve spun around, marching over to where Natasha was frozen, shock pale under the overhead lights. “What’s wrong?”
the brunette mouthed as he pushed closer to Steve. Clint nodded, closing the door softly behind him.
Tony stretched over on his back finally meeting Steve’s sparkling blue eyes. “What can I say? I’m a miracle worker.”
The woman’s lower lip trembled. “It’s my cat. He won’t come down.” She pointed a slender hand up a large oak tree on the right side of the road, Steve barely able to make few meows from the animal. Steve sighed but found himself walking towards the tree anyway. “Of course, ma’am, but I suggest you stand clear. There may be trouble,” Steve said in a firm tone.
Clint finally broke eye contact when Steve walked in, taking a seat next to Tony. Steve nodded to Fury before looking back up at Clint. “What do you got?”
“The same thing as you, if I had to guess,” Fury interjected. His voice was smooth but carried the threat of easily turning sharp at a moment’s notice.
Secondly, I will be out of town this coming weekend, so the next update might not be in on Sunday. However, I don't want to push it off and make you guys wait a whole extra week. So, the next update will probably be that Monday or Tuesday. That way you won't have to wait two whole weeks for the next chapter. Hopefully that's cool beans with everyone.
“Steve, Tony is pumped full of enough drugs to keep him out of it until tomorrow morning at the earliest.”
“Just place them near the largest pile of files you see,” Steve explained. “They won’t go off until I give word to JARVIS, so we’ll have time to clear out. Tony thinks we should only need one, but I don’t think we should take any chances here. We need to make sure that everything burns.”
