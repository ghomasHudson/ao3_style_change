“Lucifer’s gotta know something’s up.” Another blast shook their tail as the Borg cubes corralled the shuttle towards Lucifer’s cube.
Castiel moves to the bench on the perpendicular wall. Castiel eyes Dean. He knows he hasn't eaten since last night, he'd mostly been drinking all day. It happens like this every year on this day. Dean's never told Castiel why.
“Don’t set a foot back on Earth unless you’ve completed the mission and comb your hair.” Dean stepped out of the office and made his way to the transporter, knowing he would now be downing
"What do you m ... Of course you have a choice. Why ... " Dean starts. Castiel finally looks at Dean. He squints and tilts his head.
“Cas … how … I …”
“Dean, how did you reverse the telepathy? In all honesty, it shouldn’t work. A human reversing a telepathic link is unheard of.” Dean tilted his head shrugged.
"Why not?"
“Now why would I do that?”
"Take your team to sick bay. I'll take it from here."
"Well, it should be right there, Capn. These are its last known coordinates." Chief Navigator Fitz said, scanning the empty space around the ship.
"Oh but it's such a great face!"
“Sam. I am truly sorry. Neither of you deserved this end. Jack … he doesn’t want to chance fate. Not like Chuck did. He played with our lives and we all know how that ended. What I can tell you is that he’ll be with everyone you have lost. I know it seems dismal and hopeless but … his hope continues with you. Making the most of your life.” Cas says. He places a hand on Sam's shoulder. “I will always be there for you Sam. For anything. Just, send a prayer and I will be here.”
"Dean," Castiel pleads. "I told you the truth."
Castiel looks back to see Gadreel gaining speed on the ramp. Dean follows his gaze again.
"I will Cas. Don't you worry bout' me." Dean said nodding his head and forcing a smile that pulled at his eyes. It was apparently convincing enough for Castiel to leave, or maybe he knew Dean needed to be alone, needed to think, whether he was horizontal or not. Maybe Cas wanted to stop arguing. Maybe Cas just wanted to see Dean smile. Maybe, Dean wanted the same.
Castiel almost rips the door off its hinges getting out of the Impala.
"Dean help me. I can’t-”. Cas said finally stepping into the starlight. His blue eyes shined with fear and fury as he sat on the purple couch in front of the window.
Dean puts up a hand as a click sounds behind the door. Dean grins and looks at Castiel.
The Borg.
It felt like a dream, or a nightmare. Dean had dreamt of this moment for 30 years. The moment when he'd come face to face with this Romulan who took his mothers life away. All the times he imagined it, he never thought he would be this terrified. Something he never felt before was seeping in through the cracks. Dean had spent his whole life leading up to this moment. Whether he wanted it or not, he knew this moment would come.
"Oh hell, we watched Superman at the Academy, I know we did. At uh, one of those vintage movie theaters. I remember because you kept saying that it was 'illogical' that no one knew Superman and Clark Kent were the same person. Or did you forget that we got thrown out because you made those comments out loud, during the movie, with a packed audience?" Dean said seeing a small smile stretch across Castiel's face.
“How do you know that word?” He said, taking a step toward Dean. Dean looked down and spoke in a low voice.
"You have help, in the future. You're not alone." Castiel says.
"You're him and you're not him. It's like ... schrödinger's Terminator."
“Dean, he said something else.”
"Why do you keep calling me that?" Unit 13 finally speaks, their voice graveled and quiet. "My designation is ... Cyberdy..."
Dean pulled the purple uniform undershirt over his head. He glanced up to Cas who was rearranging the hyposprays. Dean closed his eyes and shook his head again as he pulled on his socks, pants and shoes. Just as Dean pulled his uniform top over his head, the sick bay door slid open and Sam walked in.
“Yet, Cas. What?” But Cas was picking up his pace. “Is she not as advanced as you?
“Reroute everything except the engine to shields. Everything, even life support, we won’t need it much longer either way.”
Beloved.
"Yeah, yeah I know. You, uh ... you didn't give up though. Like the friggin Energizer Bunny. Didn't give up on me, even when I was ... " He stares ahead with a soft smile for a second before he blinks and takes another swig. He takes his free hand and slaps the back of it against Castiel’s knee. "You've just always been there Cas and I …” He pulls his hand back and rolls it into a fist in his lap. “You know, I always … want to tell you more but I know it'd disrupt the timeline … er whatever." His voice was so low now that had Castiel been human, he wouldn't have been able to hear him. Dean's eyes flick to Cas' and back to his drink. "This whole thing is just a mess, you know. The past, the future, Legion ... Us."
Sam was right about this too. What happened on the Durus had Dean reeling. He was so out of it, he didn't even go through his usual ritual of greeting his favorite shuttle, the Impala. The small but sturdy ship had seen him and his family through many battles and it had become a part of the family. Dean usually would run a few scans to make sure she was in tiptop condition and though he'd never admit it, he sang to her. He sang the songs he remembered his mother singing when he was a kid. It was silly, but Dean did it anyways … except this time. He simply threw on his overcoat, opened the Impala door and took his seat at the helm.
“Anna, this is Captain Dean Winchester.” Anna turned her attention to Dean and squinted ever so slightly at him.
Castiel meets Rufus, an old friend of Dean's who doesn't seem to trust anyone but himself.
Dean shook his head, but kept his eyes steady. He felt his throat close up, and he knew that if he started talking, tears would come. Dean took a breath, and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees and wiping his face with his hands. He balled his hands to fists and rested his mouth on them and looked to Cas. Sitting like this, with Castiel's hand mere centimeters from Dean's legs, and nothing separating them but a foot of air and Starfleet Regulation uniforms; it was terrifying. It was like standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, waiting to jump.
Dean scoffed.
scared. Jesus, more like terrified. It was like there was something in his throat, begging to come out. It had been resting there making a home for years, but now it was breaking the door down.
Dean sat on the edge of the captain's chair, with Sam peering at him from his right, and Cas standing somewhere behind his left shoulder. He could feel the doubt floating in the air. It was ludicrous.
"If I remember correctly, it was
“So, why didn’t you tell him?” Dean rolled his eyes and rested his hands on the console.
“Let’s bring my baby brother home,” Dean says as they take off down the road.
"I don't know wha ...." Castiel starts, the lie rolling easily off his tongue.
"Cas? Is it … are you..." A low voice calls. It registers as a male, probably in his late 30's. Unit 13 lifts its head to see a human. One with light brown hair and bright green eyes wearing a dark grey jumpsuit. The way the human's unshaven face contorts into a small smile makes Unit 13s head tilt.
"Oh, I can't do that. I'm not done playing with him yet. See you soon, Captain." The screen changed back to the Borg cube. Dean tried to remember the last time Cas spoke to him telepathically, and how long Cas might have been under Lucifers control. It had been hours. Sam broke the silence.
“Dean, I killed him. I did this. Put me in the brig. I can’t be trusted. Please, Dean.” Cas pleaded. Dean gripped Castiel’s arms and shook him a bit.
“Captain, there's an incoming message for you from Admiral Winchester. He wants you to see him at Starfleet Command when you have a moment.”
Castiel stops dead in his tracks. He turns his head just enough to see Dean out of the corner of his eye. Dean keeps walking until he's at Castiel's side.
"I ... " Castiel's eyes stare into Deans.
He leans out the window searching for Gadreel. He finally spots him a few cars behind them. Sure enough, he sees a woman on the ground with a bloody nose.
"Captain Winchester to Commander Castiel. Cas respond. Captain to Security Team 1. Someone answer me dammit." Dean half yelled. If no one was responding, it could mean the worst. Sam stood and jogged to the Security console.
Is all that plays in Castiel's mind.
He hears the rubble move again and looks to the window he jumped through. He stays silent as he makes his way to it and pulls himself over the window sill. He turns back to Dean and waits. Dean’s gaze moves to the pile of rubble. When Dean doesn't make a move to leave, Castiel yells.
Dean blinked and for a moment saw his father lying there. Dean shook his head and blinked again, seeing Ejhil. Dean gripped the man by the shoulders and pulled him to a sitting position. He stared a moment longer and saw his father again. The image of John grinned at him. Something dawned on him. This wasn’t his blame to take. This was always his father’s. Thirty years of blame that Dean took without question, dissipated as he stared at his father. Rage took it’s place.
Dean forced a laugh and swayed a bit.
“No, Dean, I don’t. Casualty of war. Besides, unlike my brothers and sisters I’ve managed to rid myself of those emotions. It’s a wonder what the Borg collective can do to the psyche."
Cas looked down and nodded.
“Heya Cas.” He replied. Dean bit his lip. He followed Cas to say something, anything. Now standing there, he drew a blank. Cas finally broke the silence.
“The only foreseeable option would be for me to mind meld with someone. It would keep me grounded enough to fight him off.”
"Uck ammit" Dean slurs his words over the towel.
be easier to give up. They couldn’t fight. They could barely defend themselves. Dean tried to pull options out of the air until he glanced to Sam. It dawned on him that they could give Lucifer exactly what he wanted. The Winchesters. He could pull a move he made back in the Academy, something that made his father cringe.
"Don't start citing Starfleet protocol at me, because I know what you're going to say, and I don't want to hear it. I'm going. That's final." Dean paused and glanced to Cas. "I have to." Dean hated the tone that he was using now. It sounded just like his father - too much like his father.
“How do you know that? I haven't ... I mean not even Sam,” Dean almost grumbles. Castiel sensors tell him Dean’s face is getting warmer. According to his programming, that usually accompanies anger. Castiel pauses, examining Dean's face, each line pinging a different memory.
Dean stares out the window. He cocks his head to one side with a smirk.
“It is.” Dean looked to Sam. “I’ve decided to hand myself and my brother over to you, if and only if you leave Earth and this ship alone.” Sam was trying his hardest to look hurt. The crew looked pained.
"I ... I what?" Dean says, moving to Castiel's side. The last thing Castiel sees is Dean waving a hand in front of his face. He sees his mouth move but it's fading now into a different place. A different time. This is right before they escape.
Dean stood at the sliding door and held his breath as he stepped through. Castiel stood in the middle of the large vaulted room. The gigantic screen in front of him displayed the Neutral Zone and their route for the mission. The blue green display cast a cool light on Cas. From where Dean was standing, he was glowing. The sliding door slid shut and Cas turned his head a bit, barely enough to see Dean. Cas pressed a button that zoomed in on the Argenteus's current position.
“Cas, I… ” Dean starts but is cut off.
"Hey, Rufus. It's Dean. Dean Winchester. I uh ... We need help." Dean says, leaning towards the speaker.
They pull up to a long stretch of brick buildings. Must've been a factory at some point but now it's small apartments and homes. The corner building catches Castiel's eye, the coke sign, though dull and old signals Rufus' home.
“This.” He whispered before letting his lips brush against Dean’s. It was a quick and simple kiss, but Dean felt his eyes widen and his heart skip a beat. Dean was frozen but he could feel his heart begin to burn in his chest, melting everything away. He stared at Cas as he felt his arms tense up. Cas stared at Dean a moment and squinted. He took a step back and looked to the ground.
He stood and strolled over to the wide window. He took a deep breath as stars and nebulas slid past. He took another swig of coffee and focused on a particularly green cluster of stars less than a lightyear away. It wasn't a pleasant deep forest green, or even a bright emerald green. It was a green that made Dean's stomach turn as he realized it was moving. He gasped as a light flashed from the cluster and a small object came hurtling toward the ship.
Nonetheless, they were inseparable. Dean would get into trouble, and as much as Cas groaned when Dean asked him to tag along on his escapades, Cas obliged. Some of Dean’s best memories come from the Academy. Everything from watching Cas explain away how a couple thousand tribbles made their way into the Campus cafeteria, to staying up late cramming for exams they didn’t study for that week because they were too busy sneaking out and going to any vintage movie theater Dean could find.
"Yes, sir." Dean said, a gut response.
"Move out of the way," Uriel says, eyes not leaving Castiel's.
“Run!”
"You're smarter than you let on, Dean."
Cas tilted his head and shrugged. He took steps toward Dean until they were toe to toe. He peered at Dean and leaned in.
“I don’t believe you have,” Cas says taking Dean's hand and stroking his thumb along the back. Cas looks out the window. “It’s almost time”.
"It's your damn name, Cas," Dean says, his voice grating, low and uneven. He shakes his head and drops it into his hands.
"Yeah, uh. Listen I hate to cut this short, but uh." Dean gestures to his leg.
Dean wanted to say there forever - sitting on the floor with their legs tangled together. Dean wondered how sitting like this didn't hurt, but the warmth of Castiel's arms slung around Dean shut that thought out. His eyes flicked open when he remembered the book in Castiel's brain - the one that held the word beloved.
Castiel tightens a belt just above the bullet wound pulsating in Dean's thigh. Blood leaks out of the wound still, making everything slick and musty. Castiel rips the hole in Dean's pants wider, wide enough that the pant leg hangs loose below Dean's leg. Castiel digs in the Walgreen's bag to find a small black set of towels. He pulls them apart and rolls one up handing it to Dean.
"Oh for fucks sake. You're not even supposed to be sorry. It's ... you shouldn't feel it and it's my fault. It's all my fault. I just ... '' Dean turns completely away from Castiel now. "God I'm so sick of this. Of ... of feeling like this. Of feeling. Period. It's too fuckin much, man." Dean takes another drink and turns, sliding down the concrete wall.
“I’m … dead.” The word rolls off his tongue like a razor blade.
"No."
“See you soon, Cas.” Dean closed his eyes and waited for the meld to end. He felt a hot breeze on him, something like a blanket snug around his shoulders and a sound like birds. He swore he was at a beach but when he opened his eyes, the sound cleared up and the birds were the beeps of the nearby computer and the hot breeze came from the man breathing into his neck. Cas’ arms were wrapped tightly around Dean.
"Castiel?" Dean whispered. Light shined over broken glass and furniture scattered on the floor. He heard rustling behind him and saw a flash of lab coat. Dean tried to avoid it, but in one swift movement, Cas had Dean pinned against a bulkhead. Cas's arm was hard against Dean's neck. Dean could barely breathe. He looked to Cas whose face was dark.
"No I'm not coming on, Sam. There's nothing to say about it. Computer: Bridge." Dean said crossing his arms. The turbo lift whirred and propelled the pair upwards.
“Hey, with my baby at my fingertips and the best crew in the fleet, I got all the luck I need." Dean tried to smile. Cas simply stared at him.
The impossible feeling returns, feels like a ball in his throat, aching to be released. Castiel thinks about lying again. He's becoming better and better at it as time goes on. He looks back to Dean, but not at his eyes. He looks back down into the Walgreen's bag, now soaked in blood.
“I made a promise to myself years ago, that I would never read the minds of those around me. You and I have our disagreements as recent events have shown, but I share my thoughts with you, nonetheless. I’ve never read a thought from anyone on this ship.” He finished. Silence floated between bulkheads as Castiel made his way to the door. He stopped as his shoulder brushed against Dean’s.
Unit 13 whips up their own hands to clash with Dean's, grabbing both of his wrists.
“Dead.” Sam repeated, slowly rolling over the word.
Something about a cybernetic organism driving the Impala makes Dean's stomach churn. He isn't sure if it's the fact that someone else is at Baby's wheel or the fact that Castiel makes slow stops, turns the wheel a bit too sharply at intersections, and rides the edges of the roads too much. Sure, Castiel can drive, Dean figured he was programmed with that knowledge or he watched Dean enough to know the basics, but he has no ... heart in it.
"Yes, Sir." The comm fell silent. Dean sighed and took another sip of coffee. He looked up to Sam and then to Cas - his last saving grace, and made a decision.
Unit 13 scans the rest of the room to find that one wall, where Uriel entered, is bulletproof glass with seams that indicate a door. Across the way is another room identical to this one, but it's lacking a Legion unit and a human programmer. The metal table Unit 13 sits on registers as cold, even through the black jumpsuit they've finally noticed they're wearing. They move to stand but as their feet hit the floor a nerve signal is sent to their main processor. It registers as sharp, biting pain, and Unit 13 buckles under their own weight.
“Cas, please. You aren’t a weapon to me. I need you on this mission because like you said, you’re my closest friend. I mean, I’m doing this for you and Samandriel. For what he did to you.”
“When did you become such an expert on emotions?”
“How am I supposed to trust you?” Dean replies, shaking his head and laying his shotgun on his shoulder. Castiel scans through his memory. He can access the facts right now, and maybe that's all he needs.
"Get to sick bay. We probably have wounded." Cas nodded. Dean turned away from Cas and started to walk. Before he turned the corner, he glanced back, but Cas was already gone. He wanted to say something, at least about Lucifer and what he did to Cas. But, he couldn’t.
Dean shakes his head and claps his hands together.
Sam rolled his eyes and leaned forward.
Rufus leads him to a wall at the far left side of the large living room. The heavy metal door that Rufus reaches for is pulled open to reveal a small elevator door. Rufus punches a small button with a down arrow to the left. A ding rings out as the door slides open. Rufus enters with Dean at his side and eyes Castiel as he waits outside the elevator.
“We’ll have to use your vehicle for now and then find another one. Gadreel will have scanned this one already. He’ll know it’s yours.” Castiel says while walking to the Impala.
There, he saw a small clearing with a large maroon stone in the middle. A small fire rose around it. Scattered around the edges of the clearing were baskets, some empty, some stocked with what looked like berries. It looked pretty primitive. Dean thought maybe this was the wrong moon. Crowded around a larger basket were three figures. Dean leaned a bit more to get a better look and saw they were Romulans, two women and one man. The older woman was talking to the man, rambling about rations, when Dean heard her say the man’s name. Ejhil.
"Hello Dean." He said. He turned and tilted his head. Dean looked down and back up to Cas.
Dean had received additional orders that morning from his father saying that he was to take out the man who killed Mary - a man named Ejiul Neral who was beamed back off the Durus once the Auroto decided to retreat. Search and destroy. Ignore other targets. A life for a life. Dean had yet to share this new order with anyone, including Cas. Dean knew the orders were a pile of bull but something in him tugged him forward. Dean finally spoke.
Dean blinked a few times and grinned. He crossed his arms.
could have retreated,
He ran into something solid and fell back.
"Captian." Sam said, nodding and waiting for Dean to take his place.
"Yeah, yeah. I can go pretty long without sleep." Dean says as he presses on the gas pedal.
"Fine ... fine." Dean sighs. "Say the word."
Castiel doesn't realize his hands are shaking too. He hears it first as the metal of the gun vibrating against itself and sees his aim is wavering. His eyes flick back to Dean, who opens his mouth again.
Castiel's eyes never leave the road.
"I have my mission," Gadreel says, his voice low and controlled. "Do not speak a name that does not exist. That was always your mistake Unit 13. Your fatal human error."
“No, she can read people with empathic abilities, but … communication outside of the family is something she hasn’t reached yet.”
Another curse and groan from Dean remind Castiel to move his eyes to the road.
“Deck 7 then.” Dean waited as the turbo lift lowered him. Dean had avoided this discussion over the years. Whenever Castiel asked about his mother, he'd say she died on duty and that was it. Nothing else. It wasn't a lie - she did die on duty. But the circumstances? Dean couldn't face them. He couldn't face the blame that both he and his father put on him.
"I'm talking about this. You’re shutting down already, I can feel it.” Dean looked down.
"I'm so sorry." Heat washed over him again, but it was different, it was isolated and he could smell it burning? Excruciating pain shot through his shoulder as he heard shouting and footsteps around him. He craned his neck and saw a phaser burn on his back. He looked up and saw a tall Romulan holding a phaser. There were two more shots fired and waves of pain washed over him that forced him to fall on his side. Dean's vision wavered but he could see four figures moving at the opening to the clearing. One Romulan came and grabbed Ejhil. The others were shouting to the hallway, firing their phasers. The tallest Romulan walked to Dean and pointed the phaser in his face.
Unit 13 moves to hover over Dean as he reaches towards his neck. His hands close over it easily and squeeze.
I know that name, why do I know that name.” Dean half mumbled.
Then Castiel's vision goes dark. Words flash and he can hear a beeping sequence he's all too familiar with.
"Fine … fine. Dropping it. Now, I've talked to the Romulans and they've agreed to let us go. We've given them food and supplies and the medics are almost done treating their wounded."
“He’s waiting for our move. Cas and I outsmarted him in Cas’ noodle and now he wants a grudge match.”
“Have you now? I hope it’s a good one.”
“Oh well that’s fine Luci, but this is my favorite shuttle. It’s my baby. I just don’t want you to ding her up. That’s all.”
Electricity arcs across a street lamp, shorting its bulb. Glass shatters and sprinkles the ground while sparks fly from the live wire. A five-foot-tall iridescent bubble shears into existence, cutting into the street lamp at its base and forming a crater in the ground. The bubble dissolves as the street lamp teeters and falls with a crash. A figure emerges shaky, his legs waver for just a moment. A white-hot heat radiates through Castiel's hyper alloy skeleton as his hands fall to the concrete.
“Don’t even think about screaming. I’m going to take my hand away, and your going to answer a few questions, got it?” Dean said in a low voice. The man stared at Dean, eyes pierced with fear.
"How do you know that, huh? My father's known me my whole life. He knows what I am. I am responsible for the death of his wife. I started out a failure, Cas. I have to fix this mistake. I have to. " Dean said. A silence filled the large room for at least a minute before Castiel spoke again.
"I can't." Cas gasped in pain.
"Are you an imbecile? It's a simple yes or no query. I know the answer, it's no. You're not. I’ve known you for sixteen years Dean. I think I know a little bit about who you are and who you aren’t. You don't think you deserve forgiveness, yet you put you're life on the line everyday for people you don't know. You have a crew that is loyal to you, and it's not just because you have those pips that you so clearly earned. It's because of who you are, Dean. You are righteous; you lead your crew with compassion and a thirst for justice. People care about you a
"Dean, I know you, don't pretend like I don't. I know that this is ‘Classic Winchester behavior’, as Charlie calls it. I also know that there’s no way I can talk you out of this. So go be a hero, if you must."
"God, fine. Um .... What is it ... Uh." Dean runs his free hand over his mouth. " Uh ... oh ... You're not dead until I tell you. You got that Riggs?"
The whole time Uriel is speaking, Castiel turns the gun over in his hands. He's been reprogrammed 24 times now, each time he loses some memory that eventually returns. Each time he meets Dean again and it's like he can never forget him. He can forget how to pull the trigger, but this bloody heap of a human is so imprinted in his programming now, so ingrained after a year, that it's impossible to forget.
Dean was shaken from his trance when heard another voice, just outside of the Impala. Before he could step away Sam appeared in the hatch. Sam looked down and stood against the hatch-frame. Dean stepped back toward the console as Cas turned toward Sam. Cas nodded at Sam and walked out on the Impala. Sam stood for a moment longer glancing between the two men, before taking his seat next to Dean. Dean felt Sam’s eyes on him and decided to break the silence
“It’s our only option. Dean’s right, if we work together we’ll make it. Let’s do it.” Sam said.
"Dean, I wish I could tell you, but truth be told ... I can't remember a lot of it. Something happened." He stops. Castiel blinks and the countdown rings in his head. "A malfunction. My memory chip was damaged and it's trying to repair itself. Memories come back in pieces here and there."
” Cas said.
“So you convinced the crew, even though you thought you wouldn’t be coming back.” Sam stared at Dean. Dean looked away. Sam let out a breath and shook his head.
"My mission ... " Castiel stares into Dean's eyes. He sees a flash of Dean's face in the hotel the night before, of his face in the moonlight. That impossible, unnamed feeling rearing its ugly head at the worst possible moment. "I ... I won't fail, Dean. I can't." Castiel turns back as he hears more bullets fly past. "Follow behind me. Please." Castiel says. In his peripheral vision, he can see Dean shaking his head.
"Dad wanted me and Sammy to go, take up the mantle I guess. I barely got through basic. Didn't like the sergeants but I liked the ... the loyalty. You know your team ... FUCK!"
"It's ok, Cas," Dean says. Castiel closes his eyes for a moment, letting Dean's voice fill his head.
“Have I told you today, that I love you?” Dean murmurs, as he reaches his hand over to Cas’. Cas smiles and lets out a chuckle.
Unit 13 loosens his grip on Dean's neck if only to pull back from Dean's grip.
“Hello, Dean.” He hears the familiar gruff voice behind him. He turns and sees Cas. Smiling but sad. Dean stands there frozen. He stutters.
Dean turns to follow, stuffing the thick wad of cash in his jacket pocket. Castiel moves fast, walks with almost a hunch now towards the car. Dean watches Castiel's hands curl into fists like they had been all day long.
“Remember that when I’m under his control and murdering half the ship, because you wouldn’t let me leave. This isn’t about me, Dean, this is about the safety of the crew. I don’t care if I go insane, but if I hurt someone I care about again.” Cas shook his head and took a deep breath. He averted Dean’s gaze as he turned back to the door and stopped just a foot shy of it and looked back to Dean. Cas spoke, again, but it was cool and even - the voice Cas reserved for Starfleet Admirals. “I will be in my quarters meditating if anyone requires my assistance.”
Sam went to the comm panel and brought up a schematic and crew list for the ship. It was small, but powerful. Although it had been a formidable opponent when John went up against it, now with Starfleet advances, it would be a short battle, and everyone at the proverbial round table knew it.
He watches the driver open the door and step out. His ocular sensors glide over the leather jacket, the dark jeans, and logger boots. His eyes travel up from there and he sees the green in the man's eyes, the cropped brown hair and hears the familiar hum of the man's voice as he finishes out the last chords of a rock song that Castiel can't place. He feels his breath hitch. It must be a nerve signal malfunction.
Castiel crosses the front of the car and slides into the passenger seat.
“I have this, you son of a bitch.” He growled, and fired the phaser sending Lucifer back a few feet before disintegrating him from Castiel's mind. The library fell silent save for slow footsteps. Dean turned his head to see Cas, still weak from the phaser trick, but standing. The meld started to break and the library around them began to cloud up. Dean smiled a crooked smile and closed the distance between them. He reached out and pulled Cas into a hug.
"We can't go back there, not yet. We kill Gadreel and you'll be safe for a time." Castiel says.
Cas stood there, long after the shuttle bay doors finally closed. He only moved when he realized he wanted to be on the bridge, to make sure the Winchester could find there way back home.
"The Romulans are puppies now compared to the Borg. We have no business going after them.” Chief Engineer Singer blustered. “Besides, I've been slaving over the colt for ages now, I even modified it with a rotating firing frequency, specifically to take the Borg down."
A part of him couldn't believe that Cas had blasted in there and rescued him. Mostly because … it was Cas. It's wasn’t that Cas wasn't capable, it was that he hardly ever resorted to physical combat. Dean craned his neck to look at Cas and make sure he wasn't still hallucinating.
Dean rolls his eyes so far his whole head tips to the side.
He almost feels the rifle in his hands, almost feels the concrete under his feet, and almost sees Dean on the ground in front of him, a bloody gash across his face and chest. His memory processor is working overtime and most of it is static until Dean speaks.
Castiel looks at Dean. He looks down and back out the window.
"I can't talk about this." Dean said, checking the weapons supply, looking further away from Castiel. Dean felt a tug on his chair and found himself spinning around to face Cas. Blue eyes stared him down and caught his gaze.
Not a cheeky little up turn of the lips, but a full ear to ear smile.
"How ..." Dean starts.
Dean sighed as he tapped his badge and spoke in a low voice.
“Did you at least tell him?”
“You could have told him, Dean.”
"Winchester. You're close to getting sent to the crucible as it is." Uriel's voice echoes behind Unit 13. He takes a few steps towards Unit 13. "Let him go. He remains useful to Legion ... for now."
“I … I can’t.” Cas almost coughs out, taking a few steps forward. Sam sees tears in Cas’ eyes.
"I know, Dean. I know."
“I said run, you have to get out of here!” Castiel yells as he raises the muffler and swings it against the Terminator's head. The metal dents with a metallic crunch and knocks the Terminator’s head to the side.
Cas closed the distance between them. He placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder and nodded. He looked to Dean, moved his hand to Dean’s shoulder and pulled him into a hug. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and squeezed him.
“Dean … ” Dean looked to his brother. Sammy lifted a hand and put it on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas spoke.
June 20, 2016
"I'm going to run, and you're going to stay behind me, exactly behind me, Dean." Castiel almost yells.
Dean looked away from Cas. Sam was the last person he wanted to tell.
"Captian, we have to go after the Borg. We can't just let them go free!" Chief Tactical Officer Henricksen said.
"That … was my mother." He said through gritted teeth. Ejhil threw his arms up.
could have saved her!
Unit 13 logs this encounter under Human Fallacies.
"Do what you want to me. But don't .... don't hurt Dean." Castiel manages. His right arm hangs down after being broken by Gadreel earlier in their sparing.
Castiel takes a small pocket knife out of his pocket and goes for his palm. Dean glances around, making sure no one can see what they're doing. He looks back at Castiel when he hears the click of the knife opening.
"So you do have feelings for him." Sam leaned back in his chair. Dean looked down and gritted his teeth. He looked to Sam, who raised his eyebrows at him. Dean couldn’t hide from this one, not from Sam. Not this time, so, he gave in. He took a breath and mumbled.
"What .... " He starts.
It’s like a cough deep in his throat. His memory is still faulty but he manages to access a piece, a voice. It’s not his. It's ... got a subtle twang to it that he can't place. It's steadfast and strong, but lilts like a melody.
The Terminator, Gadreel, turns to Castiel now, swinging its arm into the console. Sparks fly in every direction.
“Captain … we don’t have a move.” Jo said. Dean clenched his jaw. He stared at the view screen. It
“Dean …” Castiel starts. Dean's eyes almost dilate wider at the sound of his name. He lowers his hand with the bottle. Castiel can feel Dean leaning closer, the fabric of his shirt pinching between their shoulders. Castiel continues, “Are you alright?”
“Alright Castiel, break it, you owe me,” Dean says. “Nearest highway is about a mile away, just have to make a few turns.” Castiel feels the gun hit his hand but the sound of his name coming out of Dean's mouth, its all he hears. It's all he can feel ... sense. All other sound is sucked out of the air.
"We're going to need more weapons." Castiel starts. "Gadreel will not go down with just that. We'll need to break in somewhere. A local gun store or something."
“Killjoy. You can’t even enjoy a quick synthehol?” Dean mumbled.
“Yes … who are…” The man stuttered.
The Impala slammed into the wall of the cube and detonated on impact. Inside Lucifer’s  cube, shrapnel flew and an explosion set off by the second torpedo ripped Lucifer a new one. As his neural net failed, so did the smaller cubes. Electric currents spiked and shorted out as the Argenteus slipped into warp drive.
Castiel stands and places the bowl of beans next to Dean. He probably won't eat them and he probably won't look at Castiel in the eyes again until tomorrow. Castiel does it anyway. He has to. Well, at least that's what he knew for a long time. He has to help Dean, he has to protect Dean. He never questioned it until that "has to'' started to turn into "wants to".
"Oh, come on Dean." Sam said through a laugh. Dean rolled his eyes and kept walking, stepping into the turbo lift.
"No Dean. I don't enjoy removing bullets from the one person I am supposed to protect. But ... I enjoy your stories. What I can remember, anyway." He finishes.
"Like I said Dean, I'm just trying to protect you. I don't want to hurt you." Castiel lifts his head and turns it slowly "I will never ... hurt you." Castiel's voice sounds like a warm hum, in the end, vibrating over to Dean who looks back at him, mouth open. He closes his mouth, almost as if to form a word but nothing leaves his lips. Dean and Castiel stare into each other for what feels like an eternity. The sound of an engine knocking in the gas pump behind them jolts Dean and forces him to glance away, looking to the rearview mirror.
He didn't say a word.
"There," Castiel says. "We'll change the gauze tomorrow. Should heal up fairly quickly." Castiel digs around again in the Walgreen's bag and pulls out ibuprofen. "Take some of these for the pain. I'll keep driving. We need to get to Rufus' before nightfall." Castiel gathers up the rest of the supplies and tosses them into the bag. Castiel turns so he's almost out of the backseat when Dean speaks.
“You’re not. Two officers are missing. If it was anyone but Cas, what would you do?” He paused. Dean crossed his arms. “You would be on that bridge doing everything but worry. We all care about them, we’re all family and I know he’s your best friend,” the word friend hit Dean somewhere in his gut, “but you’re letting your emotions get in the way.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Come on now, Lucifer, I wouldn’t kick you when we’re down. Besides, I know what’s at stake here. Two lives for billions. Our transporters are down, so Sam and I will take a shuttle and deliver ourselves to you. Then you leave the alpha quadrant and never come back.” Dean said. Lucifer tilted his head as a grin spread across his face.
"Sorry to break this up but … this kinda hurts." Sam said.
"When will you stop Unit 13," Uriel yells from behind Gadreel. Azazel moves to block the glass door but Castiel is quick to flick the gun out of Gadreel's hand and aim it at the three.
Except Dean couldn't do it, simply because there was no guarantee that he or Cas would survive the fall. Even though Cas looked at him now like the whole universe revolved around this point in time, he couldn't take that leap.
“They’re all here.” Dean hears Cas’ voice next to him.
Sam looks to Cas.
Dean jumped to his chair and started pushing every button.
Cas nodded and smiled at Sam.
"Dean, please."
“I am here to protect you. I was sent here to ensure your safety and make sure you become the leader you were meant to be." He thinks. He's not sure. His memory is still faulty. All Castiel knows is that when he looks at Dean, he feels the desire, no, the need to protect him. It's ingrained in his programming. "There is a line ... for the things I can tell you. Too much information can jeopardize my mission and change the future for the worse.” Castiel says scanning again. He can see the highway now.
"What happened?" Dean says, sitting up on his arms.
Dean's head cocks to one side and he takes a gulp of air. He squints his eyes and for a moment looks like he's going to speak.
"You should try to sleep without that knocking you out for once," Castiel says.
"What idiot ordered that?" Bobby asked crossing his arms. Sam spoke up, noticing his brother's apprehension.
"Come here." Dean mumbled pulling Cas to a display on the far wall.
Sam rolled his eyes as Dean laughed. They exited the turbo lift and Dean took his seat in the captain’s chair. Ensign Jo turned around from her post at the helm and spoke.
“So, what we just stay away from Borg space and we're safe?”
"Do you understand what I've said?"
The Argenteus crawled along at impulse, while the crew worked on the warp engine. It had been two days since Dean made the order to go back to Zetar, and the crew had been working non-stop. They had at least two more weeks of searching to go through to get back to Lucifer and all Dean could really do was wait. The comm would beep to life every few minutes, but it was usually a small update, nothing out of the ordinary. Even Castiel was quiet. Dean hadn't heard his voice since the day before, but Dean just assumed he was busy. Dean sat in his ready room, sipping on a mug of coffee, and stared out his window, not really focusing on anything.
The two stand now a foot apart, staring into each other's eyes. They've been this close before, hundreds of times, but this time, Dean finally leans in those extra few inches and their lips finally meet. It's awkward, they’re awkward at first but it only takes a few seconds for them to find their footing and kiss like they've been waiting a lifetime to do it. Dean finds purchase with his hands twisting in Cas’ trench while Cas’ hands slowly raise to the front of Dean's jacket. They pull apart still holding each other and rest their foreheads together. Dean grins.
Dean looks to Castiel again and doesn’t look away. He pulls the whiskey to his lips but doesn't drink. He just holds the bottle there where his warm breath blooms on the cold bottle. Castiel meets his gaze and cocks his head to the side. Castiel notes Dean’s eyes dilate and his heart rate picks up.
Castiel feels his shoulders drop and his grip releases from the steering wheel. He looks back into the rearview mirror and locks eyes with Dean. Dean gives him a crooked smile and a bloody thumbs up.
“I already said I’m coming with.”
"I'm sorry, man. That bites." Dean says with a shrug. He pauses and cracks his knuckles quietly. "What you said before ... uh about the future being bleak and cold. Is ... I mean you say I'm gonna be some big leader. Am I ... Am I, you know ..." Dean can't finish his sentence. He runs a hand over his mouth.
That’s when the tears came. They fell from Castiel’s eyes. He leaned into Dean. He was calmer now - Dean knew that - he wasn’t shaking anymore. Dean pulled Cas to his chest and wrapped his arms around him.
"That's not what I mean, Dean. You have a choice." Castiel says, craning his neck forward.
"Well ... " Dean starts, looking for a way to justify taking money out that isn't his. "I guess you're right."
The shy smile that had graced Castiel's face a few days before was long gone, and had been replaced with a frown and a furrowed brow. The ship still hovered over Starfleet Command waiting for the last of the crew to return from the short shore leave. Dean sat in his chair as Castiel looked out the window in Dean’s ready room. Dean leaned back and watched as Cas tilted his head. Cas’s eyes trailed down the glass until he was staring at the floor. He glanced to Dean and stared back out the window. Dean sighed and spoke.
“You hear that Sammy? We might just win this one.” Dean touched his badge, “I hear you Garth. Please tell me you have something. We’re dead in the water.”
“You, scared?”
Dean was still fading in and out of reality but managed to sit up and speak.
“Hey, it's called growth, man. I’m learning.” Dean said leaning in for another kiss. Before their lips can meet they are interrupted by a cheer from the roadhouse. Everyone inside is glued to the windows as they cheer and yell towards the two men.
"Why exactly were we even put on this mission? Bobby's right, we're almost too prepared for this. Why not send a smaller ship to deal with this. I mean, what gives?"
Dean mused, glad that he was in Cas's good graces again.
"There's an unnamed moon in it's orbit. It's the only M-class place around here. Should we go there?" Garth asked.
"Unit 13 is a valuable asset," Uriel says, lazily standing against the concrete wall of the training grounds. "Beat its externals all you want but if you destroy its processor, that's you on the chopping block." Uriel turns to walk away, stepping over human corpses.
"Shit, really? What does it take to kill a ... a Terminator?" Dean asks.
“Yes! Sam! Yes, you friggin happy, now? God.” Dean said, almost shouting. He stood and paced to the medical console behind his chair. There was no real reason to go, but Dean figured he should hide from this anyway. Sam turned in his chair and watched as his brother stared at the console.
Starfleet would never be safe enough. His own family was proof of that. No matter who took the blame, the fact remains. His mother died in the line of duty. So did Samandriel, and so many other Starfleet Officers. The chances of living a long life on a Starship were close to nill, and somehow Dean knew that when he did finally bite the bullet, it would be in a blaze of fire. The thought of putting Cas through that pain, or the thought of watching Cas die – they were too painful. Dean knew now that there were complicated feelings between him and Cas, bigger than friendship, bigger than words. But why dig deeper into those emotions, if it’s just going to hurt that much more in the end?
He blinks a few more times as he hears more sirens. He pushes past the thoughts ... the programming that tells him to tear that car door open. He keeps moving.
Dean scoffed and ran a hand over his face.
Dean looks at him, eyes focusing on the way Castiel's face almost crumples under the weight of ... fear? Pain? His blue eyes pierce into Dean’s skull.
"Dean ... " Castiel glances back. Dean's eyes are drooping closed as he presses on the wound. Dean's head rolls back against the window, and his hands start to go limp.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Dean said straightening up.
“Captain, I need you in the torpedo bay. I need your security codes for the send off.” Ash said.
“What are you doing Dean?” Lucifer said, crossing his arms.
"This has to do with proximity. If we stay here and back down, Cas drops out of whatever mind control he's under and the ship is safe. If we follow him, Cas stays under his control and could really lose it, but there's a 50/50 chance to destroy the Borg for good. He's making us chose. Cas's sanity and the ship, or Earth." Dean growled. "I'm not losing another officer to him, not Cas. But we can't let him assimilate Earth either." Dean gripped the guardrail as he mulled over the choices before him. Someone else, though, had an answer. Charlie.
"You're sure this is gonna work?" Dean says. He stands behind Castiel at an ATM on the side of a bank in Wells Nevada. They had run through the last of their cash at a Gas station that morning after they left the hotel.
Imzadi.
Uriel begins to move away when Castiel raises the gun to Dean's face. He feels the cold metal in his hands itching to fulfill its purpose. He feels the concrete rubble under his feet crunch under his weight. The bright red blood falls from Dean's mouth as a smile spreads across his face. A smile that doesn't quite reach the eyes, because they're too busy welling up with tears.
Castiel thinks.
Sam shook his head at Dean.
“Commander Castiel is in the Astrometrics Lab.”
A moment passes before the screen goes dark.
“At least I didn't wait until after I died,” Castiel replied, the soft annoyance prickling in his voice.
If Sam saw it then hell, probably the whole ship knew. Dean clenched his jaw before speaking and decided to play dumb.
“Hello Dean.” His normally stoic but sweet greeting for Dean, was now barely a stifled whimper. Tears teased the corners of his eyes.
"Dean, try not to speak. I'm getting you to sick bay." Cas put an arm around Dean clutching onto the man’s waist. He hoisted Dean up, making Dean cry out in pain.
As Castiel crosses into the large room he sees walls lined ceiling to floor with weapons. Military grade rifles, machine guns, hand guns. It's all there locked behind steel cage walls.
They had parked a block away across the street to avoid tracking, but now that meant they'd have to cross the open road. Castiel stares at the distance between them and the car. It’s a long way, but they have to make it. They have to.
"You shouldn't call me that. They'll only get angry. They'll hurt you." Castiel says, voice tempered and even.
“I’m sorry, man. It was selfish and dumb and -” Cas shook his head.
“I concentrated, and said a word.” He said.
"Dean I'm not here to tell you what to do. I'm just trying to protect you. That's all."
Castiel stood, emotionless and put his arm back in his lab coat. He turned with now frantic eyes to see Dean, now almost passed out on the garden floor. Cas made a move to get to Dean, but the armed Romulan was back and stood in-between the men. Cas held up his arms.
"Huh. The jacket may cover some, but bullet holes don't lie." Rufus says as he keeps moving. Castiel for his part, doesn't move. He stays frozen in place, only turning his head slightly.
"You, stay." Dean said.
"Shut up," Dean says, closing the distance between them, leaving two feet between them.
"What's g..."  Dean says crouching close to Castiel, but he can't hear Deans voice. He only hears his own processor over heating, throwing itself into over drive. It's compensating, trying to repair it's memory banks while also recalling from it. Castiel's head surges forward, almost colliding with Dean's. Pain shoots up the back of Castiel's neck. It's right where his main sensor bank is located. His vision blurs, darkens to the blood red he remembers from booting up.
"Listen Sasquatch, if you don't drop this I'm dropping you out an Air Lock. Brother or not. Computer: Resume Turbolift." Dean said crossing his arms. Sam rolled his eyes as he spoke.
“I am … I have been compromised by Lucifer and my own emotions. You witnessed in sick bay the effect that he has on me. I tried to gain control back on the planet with Samandriel, but I failed to break the connection until it was too late. If my control wavers, he could gain full control of me again. If you are still bent on facing him, I cannot be trusted. I should stay here on Earth until you return.”
“Come with me if you want to live.”
He thinks.
“That’s it then.” Dean crossed his arms and continued, “We terminate the son of a bitch.”
“No it’s not. Look, we can’t hail the Argenteus or Lucifer will know something’s up, but you’ve got that connection to him. Talk to him.”
"The ... The malfun ..." Castiel starts but he can't get through the sentence before his eyes land on a weapon. An IMI UZI 9mm. Highly destructive. Runs through humans like slicing butter. Castiel knows this because this is one of the many weapons he's pointed at Dean.
When Dean drives it's all on instinct. He drives with his heart. He knows this car like the back of his hand. Has disassembled and put her back together so many times he knows how many nuts and bolts are in her. So yeah. He's a little grumpy watching Castiel grip the steering wheel at 10 and 2.
"Why not?" Sam asked, shaking his head. Dean turned around and squinted at his brother. He crossed his arms.
Dean struggled to sit up.
“That ... was a Terminator. Model name Global Advanced Defense: Revision - Eliminator Line or Gadreel. He’s a cybernetic organism sent back in time nine years from now to kill you. In the future, a military defense program called Skynet becomes sentient and turns against humanity bringing on the destruction of the world. That apocalypse was halted by John and Sarah Connor. A new force named Legion adopted the same technology and 4 Years from now Legion will attack the world. Few humans survive, but those that do build a resistance. You, along with a handful of others, become leaders in that resistance under a woman named Dani Ramos.” He should go on. He could, but the pained look on Dean's face tells him to stop. There’s a long pause, long enough for Castiel to scan their surroundings and get a negative reading on Gadreel's power core.
Castiel sits like this for approximately 37 minutes. Castiel could sit there forever really, holding Dean up against the harsh reality of the world. But, he knows in the morning Dean will be the furthest thing from warm. Will push Castiel away, keep him at arm's length. It’s as if the night calls out of him a ghost of his past self. The man he used to be. The one whose memories flow to the brim, threatening to spill over with just another drink of whiskey.
"To the bridge?" Dean asked, walking through the sick bay door.
Dean was right for the most part about not needing sleep. He had driven for a full 12 hours and swerved only once before he pulled over at a motel at three in the morning. The room itself had peeling light blue wallpaper covering up some awful orange paint job. It had only one queen-sized bed with grey fleece blankets that felt like sandpaper, a lumpy blue chair, and a small dresser. It was the last room they had, but Dean was too tired to complain about the state of the place. He'd taken the room key and almost fallen asleep twice just walking over to the room.
The day finally comes. They’re sitting in their kitchen, in the home Cas built for them. A small 2 bedroom cabin nestled in the woods behind the Harvelles. Dean washes some dishes as Cas stands up from his seat. He says it as softly as he can.
“Shall we.” Dean led her out and they walked the halls of the ship. Anna was the one to break the monotony first.
lost it if someone hadn’t kept him company in Cas’s absence.
Cas stopped abruptly a foot from the transporter room door.
"Listen, you go near my planet, or my crew again and you're a dead man. I may be Starfleet but that doesn't mean I won't beat you like you stole something you spineless -"
Dean let out a breath and let his head fall.
“Cas, I’m sorry, but do you know how he controlled you? For the safety of the crew, I gotta know.”
"He sounds like a good person," Castiel says, as he slowly pulls the bullet out of Dean's leg. He holds it up so the light catches on the metal and the blood. Castiel drops the bullet in the bag and pulls out the sewing kit.
"Aye, Captian." The comm went silent. Dean stood and pulled his normally rolled up sleeves down on his way out to the bridge. He noted the slight wrinkle and knew hewould have to make a pit stop at his quarters to change into a fresh uniform. Dean stepped out and took short steps to Sam who stood from the Captain’s chair.
"Woah, Woah ... What uh." Dean cocks his head.
"Alright, looks like an exit coming up here," Dean replies.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean grunts out. His head rolls back to hit the cool window of the backseat of the Impala. The sound of Dean's pain echoes in the empty parking lot across from the pharmacy Castiel just came from.
Castiel hears movement in the shop and looks to the window. He looks back to Dean.
"Captain to the bridge, what the hell is going on up there!" The comm was laced with static but Sam responded in a desperate voice.
“Dean, you never installed autopilot on the Impala. It would have to be done manually. The chances of getting beamed out on time are zip.” Jo pleaded.
"Did you shoot her or not." Dean said, feeling anger come over. Ejhil watched Dean's every move and took a deep breath.
"You just can't stop saving my life, huh, Cas ... " Dean says, his words drifting as he leans back against the wall, letting his head loll back and land on Castiel’s shoulder.
"I’m very sorry … I never meant to harm anyone, I didn't even want to go. Our captain was a tyrant, he ordered us to slaughter everyone on the ship. It … I didn't mean for it to happen."
As both of Dean's hands rest on Unit 13's shoulders, they raise their head to meet the green eyes. Eyes that dart across Unit 13's face. Dean's face twists, his eyebrows turning up in the middle, his eyes going wide. Dean's jaw muscles flex before his lips part.
Castiel blinks and he sees Rufus again, behind Dean. He's far on the other side of the room now, still holding the rifle up. Castiel stares down the barrel. Dean leans to catch his blank gaze.
“I hand myself over,” he paused thinking of how much Cas would fight him on this one. “We tell Lucifer we give up. We trick him into thinking our transporters are down. I take the Impala and sail my way on over to Luci’s cube. Then at the last second I ram right into it. With the extra shielding on the Impala’s hull we could land the final blow. Ash could beam me out right before I hit, and meanwhile we’ll need everyone to be working on restoring warp to get us the hell out of here, because if we get stuck in that explosion, we'll be in a world of hurt.”
"I'm not going to make you do anything Dean. However, you know this information is crucial." Cas said. Dean sighed and closed his eyes again.
"You should eat something anyway." Castiel leans over to a stack of canned food they have.
Just as Dean merges over Castiel spots Gadreel, only now he's maneuvered between cars and is gaining on them, riding the centerline. Gadreel pays no mind to the side mirrors he's knocking off of the cars he passes. Castiel leans out once more as Dean merges to the new highway.
"I'm doing this." Dean said. Cas was silent a moment, but nodded and let Dean pass. Dean grabbed a phaser and went to the door.
"I know you doubt yourself, but ... " The way Dean closes his eyes and lets his head roll forward makes Castiel pause.  "You save a lot of people, Dean."
"Captain Winchester to the crew. Listen up, everyone. As soon as the rest of the crew get back from the moon, we're charting a course to Lucifer. I want to be sure everyone knows that this course of action is a direct violation of my father's orders. I can understand if any of you don't want to take this course of action. That's valid. It's a pretty crazy move. It'll be reckless, and probably pretty stupid. And even if we get out alive, we could all be reduced to cadets. But. This is the best damn crew in the fleet and we can take those bastards out once and for all. We can tear Lucifer a new one … for what he's done to our crew. If anyone objects please say so now." Dean touched his badge and the comm went silent. Dean clasped his hands together waiting for an objection. A solid minute passed before the comm sprang to life. Dean looked up and waited. A voice came through. Bobby.
"No."
"Yeah, well. It really feels like I don't." Dean leans against the Impala and shoves his hands in his pockets. His face falls and lolls to either side. Castiel can almost see his will breaking.
"Please, your men will live. I only injured them. Have some compassion." Cas begged.
“I have an appointment with Chief Engineer Singer that I cannot cancel. Captain, would you please show my sister around.”
“We managed to take out some of his secondary computers, but nothing he can't do without. Now he's stopped. Our nacelles are down. We’re dead in the water and Lucifer isn’t budging. It’s like he’s waiting for us.” Dean wiped a hand over his face.
"Computer, coffee - black." The computer beeped at him and a mug full to the brim materialized. Dean took the mug and held it close, turning back to face Sam. Something was about to spill over. Dean was about to tell Sam … everything, but … he couldn't.
"No, Cas you don't.” Dean puts his head in his hands. “Because sometimes it feels like I wanna rip my own skin off ... when I look ... at you." Dean rubs his face, almost catching his words before they can come out. He takes another swig. "It's like friggin torture, man." Dean leans back again and holds the bottle like a baby.
“Ash, that’s great! Where are they now?” Dean asked.
“Captain.” She said shifting her gaze between the two men, as if measuring the distance between them. Cas huffed as more unspoken words were traded between them. Dean waited in the silence trying to pick up nuances. Moments passed and Anna spoke.
"Screw him, screw the orders." Dean looked down and then back to Sammy. He touched his badge and spoke to the ship's crew.
"Where?"
"Castiel." Dean closed his eyes and felt his stomach turn.
“Alright, find a meld buddy. When the time comes, you’ll be okay.” Dean forced a smile.
Dean stares at Castiel, face twisted, mouth pulled into a thin sharp line. His eyes almost glow with a fury that Castiel hasn’t seen in a long time. Castiel hears the click of the gas pump across the way. It startles the woman who was staring enough to make her look away.
Castiel throws himself into the front seat and turns the key in the ignition. Bullets fly towards the Impala. A few land with thuds on the front hood before Castiel reverses and turns down the road. He slams on the gas and starts looking for pharmacies, grocery stores, anything that'll have first aid. He scans for long enough that he doesn't hear movement in the backseat.
"Dean, you're awake?" Cas walked over to Dean with a hypospray and injected it into Dean’s neck.
“If,” Cas paused looking down and shuffling in his place. “If that was too forward, or I was wrong to assume reciprocation, I apologize. You are still my Captain. I should have known, it’s a breech of protoc-” Cas started rambling, but Dean cut in.
Castiel stares ahead at the road and hears Dean's voice in his head. Old and new.
Ellen, Chief of Security, spoke breaking the silence.
“Ash!” Castiel stood from the Captain’s chair and turned to see the science officer frantically punching buttons.
“All due respect, Admiral, but I thought the Romulans were a neutral party now. Ever since the Dominion War …”
Dean pulls out his wallet and opens it. He pulls out his debit card and holds it out towards Castiel with a flick of his wrist.
let her die! Well, screw you, Admiral, screw you to hell! She didn’t deserve to die because of your mistake, and I don’t deserve that blame you son of a bitch!" Dean screamed feeling tears run down his face.
He's on the top of a building down the street, an automatic rifle in hand. He leans up from the gun and swings it over his shoulder. He hoists himself over the edge of the building and plummets down, landing with a crash on his hands and knees. He stands to his full height and pulls the gun from his back.
“I’m taking your soul to heaven,” Cas says.
"Hold this distance and keep a lock on us if you can. I'm taking the Impala down." Dean said.
“You’re the one firing on me.”
"That stubble goes great with that wrinkled uniform, Captain. You know I expect better from you."
He remembers Dean in the future or parts of his future at least. He remembers crow’s feet and graying hair, but the same voice, the same eyes staring back at him. He remembers being built and programmed with Legion’s most advanced learning computer. Tearing through human flesh with his bare hands. Dean's face with tears rolling down it as he sits at the business end of a rifle that's seated firmly in Castiel's hands. Being hunkered down in a concrete hideaway for a year, protecting Dean from the Terminators that will be sent to kill him. Most of his memories are still clouded, still buried but ...
"It … it was my fault." Dean whispered. Cas tilted his head.
“The cubes are failing as we speak. We got the sons of bitches; but Bobby is having a problem with the transporter. There’s a malfunction in the pattern buffer.”
"We want to get on the highway ... US 77 S will take us to California. We will need to stop for you to sleep."
"Prior to my admittance to Starfleet Academy, I was trained in over twenty styles of martial arts, spanning Betazoid, Vulcan, Klingon, and human techniques. I am also well versed in Vulcan Nerve Binding. I can easily 'take an opponent down'. I normally don't use physical force, unless the situation is dire enough. Getting you out of that cave was a dire situation. You can sit up now. I need to take a few more scans." Dean sat up as Cas scanned his back, and neck. Cas rounded the table and Dean could swear he could see Cas blushing ever so slightly as he scanned Dean's bare chest.
Cas’s eyes widened and he searched Dean’s face.
"Dean." Cas said. Dean glanced to Cas. Silence hung in the small space between the two men. Cas continued staring, waiting. Dean had no choice. He ran a hand over his face and sighed. He clenched his eyes shut, bracing himself for the emotions that were surely going to flood his way.
Dean had always felt like this, like his life was a gift given to the wrong person. Admitting that to anyone would be ludicrous. He could feel the pair of blue eyes on him. He turned his head and saw Castiel staring at him.
"Continuum jump. Yeah, alright." Dean says slowly nodding. He unlocks the Impala doors. "Look, just wait here. I'll get some dollar tacos and cheese whiz for the road." Dean says as he turns away.
"This one," Dean says, pointing to a metal door with a grated window. The metallic thud of the door slamming echoes in Castiel's ears as Dean reaches for the front door too. Castiel blinks and grips under Dean's arm tighter as he helps him up onto the curb and across the sidewalk.
Dean closed his eyes and clenched his fists.
"Well, what the hell am I supposed to do then, huh?" Dean says, loudly. Castiel looks at him and swallows. The woman next to her Nissan at the pump across the way stops and turns, craning her neck in their direction.
"Isn't the Borg mission basically the same thing?" Dean said, sounding too much like his father. Sam stepped in and spoke.
“What are you talking about? I thought you passed?”
"You are … pushing me away so it will hurt less." Dean eyes flicked back up. He could hear the hurt in Cas’s voice and it tore him apart inside. He reached out.
"Are you hungry?" Castiel says quietly. Almost as if his voice could set off an explosive if it's too loud.
“Don’t start with that.” John said shaking his head.
Dean's brow furrows as he shakes his head.
just Cas, it
Dean blinks his eyes adjusting to a bright white-blue light. His vision clears and he sees the barn he was just in. Weird. He thinks. His vision falls down and he sees his own body, cold, lifeless. If he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck, they’d be standing up.
“No way.” Dean smiles and runs to the front door. Cas follows behind. Dean makes it outside to the front door. The two men slide into the front seat. Dean sighs and adjusts the mirrors. He turns the key in the engine and it rumbles to life. Dean leans his head back and settles into the seat. He looks over to Cas who smiles back at him.
"I'm going alone." Dean said simply.
“Because I know you, Dean.”
"Captain." The three men traded looks as Garth's voice echoed in the room.
"Woah, hey ... hey," Dean says as he moves forward, arms outstretched, landing on Unit 13's shoulder. "Take it easy. Your processor is just booting up." The naked touch of a human sends another signal, one that Unit 13 can not ignore.
"Well," His head cocks to the side just a bit "Sounds like we gotta explode the son of a bitch." Dean grins wide at Castiel.
"It crashed on that moon. There's a cave system about 5 meters away that has over 50 life signs. All Romulan."
Again, Dean almost chocked on his words. Dean gulped and got out a sentence.
"Why? Why should I? Look ever since you showed up, my shops wrecked, I'm gonna lose my car, and Sam is on the line now too? And for what? For some Back to the Future bullshit? I'm supposed to care about all this? What happens if I don't? What happens if I just give up."
"That's not true. I'm sorry ... I " Castiel starts.
He only winces once as dark synthetic blood oozes out of it. He cuts two more slices down perpendicular to the first, making a U shape. He folds back the flap of skin revealing the metal alloy skeleton underneath. Dean stares at the dark metal and glances up at Castiel. His face is unmoving, empty. Cold.
"He saved my life Rufus, put the damn gun down."  Dean steps, hobbling in between the shotgun and Castiel. Using his own body as a shield.
“Can she use her betazoid mind tricks on people? You know, cruise someone’s noodle?” Cas clenched his jaw and fists just a bit.
“Trust me, he's not.” Castiel pauses pushing Dean back towards the counter. Dean looks down at Castiel's hand and moves away from it.
Dean nodded, not looking at his crew. The room fell silent and the crew tried their best to not stare at Dean. It was no secret how John treated him.
"You're enjoying this, aren't you? Sick bastard." Dean half mumbles.
Dean opened his eyes and was met with a slight breeze, and the smell of ancient paper. He expected to see those blue eyes staring back at him but instead Dean saw a gigantic room in front of him with vaulted ceilings and … no Castiel. The room held row upon row upon row of bookshelves. A library - one lined with dark wood and accented with a dark blue marble. Of course Castiel's brain would be a library. Dean looked around expecting chaos but again was met with a bay window that stood twenty feet tall. Outside, it was raining. Not a hard pelting rain, but a soft rain with a little sunlight peeking through.
“Jack. He pulled me out. It was the first thing he did when he left you and Sam. He was very persuasive to the empty. Angels will no longer go there when we die. We’ll become cosmic energy and return to Jack. Sort of a … circle of life.” Dean nods his head. Circle of life. He glances down at his corpse.
“Yeah, he’s got a piece of metal in his leg, he’s bleeding bad.”
"Dean, we're getting reports that Cas has lost it. He's going berserk, half of the security team is unconscious. Ellen's activated the holo shields near his quarters, but he's still trying to get out."
“Duck!” Dean yells to Castiel as he crouches behind a counter next to Gadreel. Castiel obliges and he sees buckshot fly into Gadreel's chest, leaving large pock marks in its wake. If he were human he’d be dead, but instead, his metal chassis shines with dark synthetic blood as he twists himself in recoil and swings back to face Dean. Castiel reaches up and catches his arms in a lock, planting his feet and pushing all his weight to keep Gadreel still.
"Lucifer said that he'll get us one way or another, and that once he does, he's gonna cruise on over to Earth, Vulcan and Betazed and snatch up a couple billion drones. I can't let that happen. We got one play, Sam.” Dean said, crossing his arms.
“Okay.” Lucifer replied. “Besides, there are plenty of other planets I can assimilate. You have thirty minutes. Don’t be late, Dean.” The screen went dark. Dean took a breath and turned back.
“Hull integrity is steady and holding. We’ve got impulse but not for long.” Sam said.
“Garth, when you beam them back, beam them directly to sick bay.” Cas said.
Castiel sticks the card into the ATM slot.
"I will be right back. I must dispose of this." Cas said taking the shrapnel and walking to a small storage room behind his office. Dean followed in silence and watched as Cas reached for a disposal drawer and scooted the shrapnel in. He closed the drawer and pressed a button that dissolved the shrapnel. Cas stood there for a moment, back still to Dean.
"Go!" He yells, pushing Dean towards the Impala.
A smile spreads on Dean's face, reaching from ear to ear, tears welling up in his eyes. He says something, but Castiel can't hear it.
"Did you just … Is that a challenge?"
“Dean, they’re trying to cut our engines so we can’t run. If they take out the nacelles-”
“What was?”
“What?” Sam twists his face. “But. I can’t … Cas, I can’t.” He says looking back at his brother's face. Cas follows his gaze.
Almost on cue, a nurse walked up to Dean, captain's uniform in hand. She glanced from Cas to Dean and moved to lay the uniform next to Dean.
"Yeah … that'd be great, Cas." Dean said, looking away from those blue eyes. Cas titled his head a bit and a small sweet smile spread on his face.
“It was me.” Cas said as he lifted his bloody bruised hands, “I killed him.” His breath hitched.“I … all I remember is a voice. I didn’t know who it was at first. But, now I do know. Dean, it was Lucifer.” He finished in a whisper.
"I've lost sight. We need to get on a different highway." Castiel says.
"You ... You built me." He thinks he shouldn't have said it because the pause of Dean's hands is almost audible. "Just take the lowermost chip out and ... " Castiel scrunches his face in pain. "Reach in with something sharp and long. You'll feel a ridge in the slot. Press it and then replace the chip." Castiel finishes "I'll shut down momentarily but I'll..." Castiel lets out a grown as he loses limb function. "Trust me, Dean, you won't mess me up. Not more than you already have." Castiel says forcing a soft smile. When Dean returns a furrowed brow and wide eyes Castiel starts to slip into a dark place in his programming. He hears Dean still talking at him but it's quiet now. Like hearing music in a cave.
June 20, 2016
Sam clutches Dean's body as it grows cold. Waves of sobs twist and contort his face. He stands there hoping if he holds on long enough he’ll hear his brother's breath again, but it never comes. The next sound he hears is the flap of wings and the rustle of fabric.
Before Dean finishes his sentence, Rufus pulls him into a hug. Rufus claps his back a few times and makes eye contact with Castiel. Castiel can see him searching as his eyes dart all over his face. Dean pulls back and cocks his head to the side.
come back. You may not have survived during the Kobayashi Maru, but we have this crew behind us now. You’re acting like we’re already dead. We’re going to survive.” Sam finished, looking to Dean.
"You're right ... about not being him I mean," Dean says turning his head to stare at the ground. Castiel turns his head. "But ... that's not your fault. It's mine."
"You didn't mean it? Oh well that fixes everything!" Dean said laughing. "That just makes it all better." Ejhil turned a bit but Dean grabbed him and pulled him back. He made a fist with his right hand and pulled it back. He swung and hit Ejhil right across the nose. He fell back, tripping over his feet. He screamed but everything was muffled now. Dean threw himself over Ejhil and laid punches on his face over and over again, all the while screaming.
Sam nodded, pressing buttons. Dean let out a breath and tried to not look out the front window. About twenty feet away, Cas stood, just in front of the door waiting with other crewmen. Dean brought the engines to life and gave a final warning to the crew. The crew in the shuttle bay ushered themselves out and stood behind a glass partition, to watch their Captain and First Officer depart. The shuttle bay door opened, and the exterior shields flickered off. The shuttle lifted off the ground and Dean took one last look at his crew. He smiled, only because half of the crewmen were cheering. His smile faded as his gaze landed on Cas. He stood a foot away from the glass and watched as the Impala floated past the shuttle bay doors.
"Dean, you must refrain from speaking. Please." Cas urged as they made it back to the shuttle. Cas struggled a bit, but managed to open the door and pull Dean inside. He laid Dean down on a cot and reached into the nearby med kit. He pulled out a hypospray that would help Dean with the pain and knock him out until Cas could get the shuttle back to the Argeneus. Cas leaned over Dean and reached for his neck. Dean felt the whoosh of the hypospray and in his last moments of conciousness he reached up to Cas’s lab coat and pulled until Cas’s ear was near his lip’s.
Castiel turns his head and takes a few steps away from the shotgun. Castiel knows he can pull the steel cage off the wall and have a weapon in less than the time it would take for Rufus to fire. On the other hand, this is a friend of Dean's. A human he should not harm.
"If I take Cas with me, will you get off my back?" Dean asked looking to Sam expectantly. Sam looked to Cas and let out a breath.
Castiel shifts his weight to have his back to Gadreel, he locks his joints below the waist, hoists him up on his back, and tosses Gadreel. He lands with a crash against a brick wall. Heavy metal shelving units holding boxes with shop rags, auto parts, and old tools collapse and fall on to him, leaving him covered in debris. For a moment there is silence.
"Ellen, what's happening?"
“You ... are Dean Winchester." He starts, choosing his words carefully. "You were born on January 24th, 1990. Your parents were Mary and John. Mary died shortly after your brother, Sam was born and John died in the military. You own and live in this shop which was given to you by Bobby Singer. You and your brother were both in ROTC and when Sam dropped out ...” Castiel pauses looking to Dean. This isn't a fact, but it's something he remembers now. Something Dean told him, or rather will tell him, only once in between swigs of shitty whiskey, “You were devastated."
Dean felt his stomach turn to knots. It felt like he wanted to cry, throw-up, and scream all at the same time. This was the last thing he wanted to talk about. Hell, he tiptoed around it with Cas and that was for a reason. Dean shook his head and paced around the cabin.
"No no no, stay with me man, come on you can fight this! This is your brain, Cas." Another crash sounded. "We gotta get out of here." Dean said, steadying Cas.
Castiel looks across the three men. The three who have raised him, hurt him, punished him.
"Nothing you don't already know, Dean." Sam said leaning back and pressing a few buttons on his chair.
“We’ve got a tractor beam locked onto you. Hang on tight.”
"You were in the Army, weren't you? Didn't you ever get hurt?" Castiel says, glancing towards Dean.
"Enter." The door slid open and Dean stepped inside. The room was long and grey with a desk at the end, and two chairs in front of it. Admiral John Winchester sat reading a pad and didn't bother to look up. Dean walked the 10 feet to stand in front of the desk, feeling himself shrink and start to feel like an ensign again.
“Deck 5.”
“He … they want to … assimilate you and your brother. There’s not a Borg in the universe that doesn’t know of you, the Winchesters. He thinks having two Starfleet officers who happen to be brothers, would strengthen his army. He will stop at nothing to get to you, and I believe now he is using me to do it.”
"You think Cas wouldn't be upset if you died now? Even if you didn't tell him how you felt? Like there's some magic switch and all the emotions go away? Sure, Cas is half-Vulcan but nobody is that heartless. You're just being stubborn."
"Stop moving," Castiel says, pulling the tweezers back. Dean whips his head forward and pulls the towel out of his mouth.
“Dean you’re gonna have to cut your call short. We’ve got company.” Sam yelled. Dean leapt up.
"Cas, what the hell? What happened?"
"Thank you Commander. Well, I should be returning to my duties. I will be in my office if anyone requires my assistance. The Captain can return to his duties when he is ready." Cas glanced back to Dean before nodding to Sam and returning to his office. Dean watched as Cas left and ran a hand through his hair. He took a deep breath and looked to Sam.
"Rufus come on it's ... it's me. You've known me fo..." Dean says, cocking his head to the side.
Castiel's first stitch is the worst. The needle breaks the skin and Dean can feel his eyes water. His teeth press down on the towel hard enough he can hear the fabric stretch. It takes 6 precise stitches to close up the wound. Castiel takes the gauze and starts wrapping around the wound, slowly and meticulously.
"Don't worry Cas. We'll find him." Dean said nodding. Cas leaned forward and reached out to Dean's face, placing his thumb near the jaw, the pointer finger next to the eye and the middle finger, just above Dean’s temple. Cas stared into Dean's eyes and Dean found himself getting lost in the moment - in Cas only a foot away, in the deep midnight blue of his eyes. He didn't realize he was sweating until Cas's fingers almost slipped off his face. He felt Cas tense up as reality slipped away. The last thing he saw was Cas blinking away a tear.
He sat back down at his desk and let his head rest on the cool metal of his desktop, relieving just a hint of the stress. The small garbled whisper in Dean's head pierced through his thoughts. It was still unintelligible, but it was strong, like a fire, engulfing and almost punishing Dean. Dean reached up to his temples in an attempt to quell the fire. This happened every time he and Cas fought. Slowly, he took deep breaths and fought to push the whisper away. A beep from Dean's badge pulled him back to reality and forced the whipser back. Dean touched his badge. Communications officer Kevin Tran spoke, filling Dean's ready room for a short moment.
"Compassion. That's interesting coming from a Vulcan." The Romulan spat.
Another sound shook Dean from his trance. A crash from the far side of he room, near the bay window. He saw a bookshelf had been shoved over and a door had been hiding behind it. Dean turned and took quick steps to the door.
Dean felt something begin to materialize duct-taped to his back. Dean wanted to smile remembering Die Hard had been showing at the vintage movie theater the same week Superman was back in the academy. Cas always said that John McClane was foolish for pulling that move, but Dean guessed, some things change.
