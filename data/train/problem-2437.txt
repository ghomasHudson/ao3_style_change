Dean let out a gasp and a grunt as he wiggled his foot again and smirked as it came loose and kicked Alistair right in the nose. There was a satisfying crunch but the force had caused Dean's chair to tip backwards.
"Nearly twenty years ago the King of Heaven banned me after I revealed his own True Mate, because his old world views couldn't comprehend who his eldest and crowned Prince son was destined to be with! He could not wrap his small mind around the idea, the truth that his Alpha son was destined to he with another Alpha. Doing everything in his power to prevent Fate from having her carefully designed way." Rowena continued fixing her skirt, turning to look over the blood coated and terrified crowd of people of all races and designations, that simply wanted to attend the bringing together of Kingdoms for the first time in hundreds of years.
"I am content." He replied dryly Officially not wanting to dig into the subject of what would be his unchangeable future.
"But really darling, tonight is going to be very special. As for your house, I know you love the little place but-" He paused, turning his hand to intertwine their fingers, bringing her hand to his lips and kissing her knuckles "Eventually, I fear that place will be to small. I mean, if we get a dog." He chuckled, amber eyes twinkling with amusement as he knew she knew what he actually meant.
Castiel awkwardly hugged the young Winchester back, giving the boy's back a few stiff Pat's and grunted as Sam released him
Then Castiel claimed he wasn't and it made the Omega want to sob. What had happened to him, he knew that wasn't his fault, what made hin feel disloyal to the man he was to marry was because his heart belonged to someone else and it hurt.
Michael tensed a little remembering the threat Dean had told him that Chuck had made. Before Michael could speak Dean had grabbed Michael's knee under the table with a desth grip, making the Prince look at Dean concerned. All Dean did was shake his head
"Yeah you're probably right. It's an exciting thing... Damn Mary Ellen isn't going to ask for a baby sibling is she?" Dean groaned into His Husband's neck, lacing their fingers together and smiling when their wedding bands clicked lightly. The angel blade rings glittering an otherworldly silver in the twinkling of fairy lights
His brothers never left his sides. Castiel helped support his brother on the right, Gabriel assisted in making sure his wounded wings didn't drag on the ground, and Balthazar growled and glared at anyone that dared look at them the entire way to where the doctor was meeting them in Michael's room.
"As-as you Wish... My King." Lucifer smiled blinking slowly. His breathing sounded wet and labored, making worry spike through Michael.
"And who told you that, hmmm?" Crowley spat out between his teeth, his eye glowing red with hatred as he sat himself down at the head of the table. "That wretched whore Abaddon, I presume?" Crowley's voice was smug, eyebrow raised as he lifted a cup pretending to admire the gold "Stole my throne more like."
"What if Dean isn't ready to get married? What if the Pronce is actually cruel? What if Dean is treated poorly? Then we're powerless once they're married and mated." Sam tried to keep his voice calm but the anger was bubbling and leaking through his scent.
Dinner went by with hardly a word. Gabriel, Balthazar, Michael, Dean and Sam hardly ate. When the meal was over, the Winchesters all retreated to a parlor to spend time the five of them, though before they were out of the dining room John pulled Castiel suddenly into a tight hug.
"Right this way your Highness." He sighed as his gold wings twitched with discomfort by Raphael's words
Castiel let out a snarl, his own wings unfurling in the room, starting off as a shadow before seeming appearing in physical form, Dean's Cas followed suit, eyes glowing blue, Castiel's glowing white as he slide his angel blade from his sleeve
Something wasn't adding up and it only caused Michael to growl. His feathers ruffled and he stormed down the hallway.
Gabriel wanted to ask, but didn't want to overstep any bounds. He and Sam had become close over this whole ordeal, and were pretty good friends. Sam had seen the Archangel get angry and even cry, but how far was pushing?
"This could be-" He stopped, nose twitching as an Omega maid walked past him, her sweet Scent wreaked with traces of Lucifer and honestly it put a further crack in Michael's heart
"Come on Adam, I'll take you to Sam" He smiled looking between Kate and John "I'm sure you all are tired." Dean added handing Baby off to Kelly. Michael rode up as the four humans had started for the castle.
Gabriel let out a huff into Sam's shoulder trying to keep his nose out of the teens neck as that could be considered scenting and the two were only friends.
Sam hummed an agreement as he kept a hand on Gabriel's shoulder, trying not to glance back as the trembling gold sea of feathers attached to Gabriel's shoulder blades and back.
"We will have to discuss something else. Dean is in a delicate state at the moment. I have already declared him as my future husband and mate. Hell and Heaven are currently at peace with the treaty signed at the end of the war. While Crowley was standing King at the signing, it was still a treaty /you/ cannot break. Should you break it." Michael stood and looked Abaddon in her soulless black eyes, Michael's own flickered with angelic grace as his wings lifted to display his superiority "It would be catastrophic for your nation."
Michael was stunning, his wings, his eyes, they seemed stern but swirling with a hidden sea of kindness... Properly hidden by war, and his scent was nice and actually calmed Dean's nerves a little.
"Kate and Adam are well, Adam is showing signs of potentially presenting as a Beta but we cannot be sure. A letter was sent out yesterday upon your arrival that you've returned, and Father should be making his way here soon. As fo Lady Moore..."
"Pretty fucked up. Let. Me. Go!" Dean growled shaking the chair enough to tip it sideways again. Then he felt it, some nail sticking out of the floor where the carpet met the wall. That could help cut the rope if he could just, get it...
"You're a kind and generous Alpha Michael. We were proud that you would be the one Dean would marry. Though there were many sleepless nights, John was sure Dean would of driven you all crazy by now." The Queen laughed with a shake of her head.
"Be agood boyfriend and gimme your pillow Cas. I'm dying over here." Dean groaned trying to pull the pillow out from under Castiel's head, his boyfriend just closed his eyes a little tighter and held the pillow with his hand, cuddling into the cool memory foam more, much to Dean's irritation.
The Crowned Prince sat back down heavy in his chair "I was young when the Witch came before, and Father forbade us from interacting with her since she was a Witch. But he was so happy after meeting Cassiel... If Gabriel succeeds do you really think it will change anything? What if- what if I'm not True Mates with who I want? And what if Dean and Castiel are not actually True Mates? Than the Wedding will still have to take place and I can never make your brother truly happy." Michael muttered with a sigh
"Of course he will. Castiel is a good man, a great Alpha. We share the same beliefs. I made sure my brother's grew up knowing that their partners are their equals, regardless of presentation or bloodline."
The two stared into each other's eyes for what Dean swore was an eternity. Blue blue blue and more blue. It's all Dean saw, Castiel's eyes were a blue that outshined all blue that the human had ever seen.
"I feel we should come up with something different. Just sign a treaty or something instead. They're close enough as friends, allies even. Sam is next in line for the throne and has expressed he wants nothing but continued peace among Heaven and Earth. Dean has expressed that Michael feels much the same and I'm willing to work with the boy when he's crowned the day of the wedding." John explained spreading a hand out as he spoke to put emphasis on everything he had just presented.
"I'm sorry Lucifer. It's just, I'm 28. I will be King soon, my marriage is arranged, the date is set... My future husband is only 18... He is practically still a child and I just..."
"Oh quit the Switzerland act, brother. I know you agree with Lucifer. But I still think it's wrong." Castiel sighed, downing his whiskey and lighting a cigarette. "We don't know squat about this place and yet here you are taking on garage after garage simply for the joy of driving a car?"
"Oh! Welcome back guys." Sam smiled looking up at the angels. Dean didn't say a word where he sat at the map table, nursing, what Sam would later tell Cas was his third beer, feet on the table, a look of anger on his face
Now the man had to live out the rest of his useless existence without Dean Winchester, without Sam, without countless other friends, alone. He had to live our the rest of his poor excuse of a human life on his own.
"That is very true." Chuck hummed tilting his head at the many cake samples set iut before the two Prince's
His eyelids felt so heavy and suddenly his chest plate and arm guards were gone, than the armor over the arch of his wings was gone.
"Oh, good morning Mama." Dean smiled leaning forward with a hand on the woman's elbow as he kissed Kate's cheek "You look stunning today! Are you sure it's not your wedding today?"
Dean looked at himself in the mirror as he leaned over the water basin and prepared to change into his night clothes.
Michael nodded as the party of winged Alphas made there way into the Castle after handing the horses over to a stable boy.
There was a brief pause and for a moment Dean thought he'd been caught. It was easier for him to hide and eavesdrop since he had no wings to worry about hiding. Still he could see and hear them and the breeze was coming in and Dean had to admit, out of the two Alphas there was one that smelled, perfect Dean shook his head quickly as the talking started up again
Michael flipped his sword in his hand, pure white wings stained with dirt, dipped in the blood of his brother, and of his own blood. One wing felt potentially broken, or at least sprained, he was bleeding heavily from his side, cuts covered his arms and legs, a few on his neck and shoulders.
The two Angel's went Barreling through the open entrance to the old little building with a roar and fluttering of wings. They tumbled into the little parking lot, punching, clawing, kicking at eachother. Their blades grazing the cheeks, arms, sides of the other but never landing any fatal blows. They slashed at each other's wings, crying out in pain from time to time as blade sliced feathers or flesh, grace and blood dripping in a mesmerizing mix down trenchcoats and dark feathers alike. Then they made to the air in a tangle of bloodied limbs, torn coats, and soaking wet feather.
"Poor little Omega." Abaddon cooed as she went from harshly gripping his hair to messaging his scalp, Dean Dean faught so hard not to but he ended up leaning into the touch, eyes slipping half closed and shoulders relaxing.
Gabriel opened his mouth to try and console his eldest brother when there was a light knock on the door
Lucifer paused in the doorway, his shoulders and back visibly tensed under his tailored white dress shirt. Where his hand rested on the wood door frame tightened, he ignored the way the wood whined under his white knuckle grip. "Kelly doesn't need the stress this life has. I'll tell her when I tell her." He released the doorframe, arm falling to his side, hands pulling into tight fists.
Dean stopped with a hiss as he cut the side of his hand by accident. He glare at the glass before throwing it away and heading to his bathroom sink.
"Jazz... I don't get the hype. Those gobble-pipes sound like someone's skinning a cat." he groaned, rubbing his temples. "Now, who's the dame? Must be a real honey bee if she's able to quench your thirst for sugar. She new? Tell me about her." he asked, trying to avoid Gabriel's question for as long as possible.
"Don't call me short, I don't call you Luci, the end." Gabriel pulled from the hug and tilted his head
Dean let his thoughts start to spiral, which was a very bad idea as he barrelled between trees, letting his Baby take him home. Before Dean knew it he was charging back into the Castle court yard as the sun was kissing the sea, his horse halted and the sudden stop nearly made him pitch forward, the prince calmed and cooed to Impala, petting her neck as he looked around, immediately recognizing the Carriage that was already being unloaded, the familiar scents of his family met his nose as he blinked a few times.
Granted, Michael hadn't expected a reaction from him, he didn't expect him to drop everything and help look for the missing Prince. In fact he supposed he got the reaction that was most logical.
"This is Jack. My husband's little demon spawn but I love him just the same. He just turned one." Michael chuckled as Castiel was suddenly beside him and taking Jack from his arms as the little boy squealed fot his uncle
"Dean you need to calm down!" Sam finally raised his voice slightly, it vibrated off the walls and in Dean's mind making him freeze and stare at his brother. Green eyes wet and wide with so many conflicting emotions "This isn't something you can hide forever. Castiel, Michael, Dad? No one is going to be mad and upset. No one is going to look at you differently, I certainly don't. What's going to happen is everyone is going to understand what happened, understand that you had no control over what happened to you, and they're going to /help/ you." Sam's voice remained firm as his determined gaze locked with Dean's, hands gripping his brother's shoulders tightly as if Dean would disappear if he let go.
Castiel nodded. Nose twitching but no further words left his lips. The Seraph simply bowed and awkwardly hurried off.
Without her makeup she looked a little less intimidating, her lips weren't actually the color of blood but a rather delicate pink, her eyes even whiter without the black eyeliner around them and her lashes were long and light.
Sam and Lucifer were almost to the doors, a demon tried to grab the boy, and Lucifer, even as Injured as he was, forced his battered wkngs to flare. A growl erupted from his chest, blood dribbling down his chin as the Demon took a step back, startled, only to be stabbed in the chest by Sam.
Gabriel's day passed in a flurry, and by the time he watched Dean and his older brother Michael ride off into the woods, he was exhausted.
Sam wrinkled his nose as he picked up something else in his brother's comfort that hadn't always been there. It was small but made Sam want to Protect his brother more than usual. Sam closed his eyes and marked it off as just his Alpha part wanting to Protect his family and a distressed Omega.
"No reason brother." He forced a smile before his and Castiel's attention was drawn to the dining room doors where their father Chuck had just entered.
It took an entire week before the entire army reached Heavens border. They had been very deep into the territory of Hell, and they had to pass through Purgatory, Eve the Queen of Purgatory, had promised them safe passage as Hell was no longer a threat to her.
"Fine. I'll tell you. You can find her on a small island a days travel from the Capital docks. It's a little island, warded and dangerous, but if why you're seeking her is of true and pure intention, than you should be able to pass with little trouble." Crowley looked up at the Prince with an amused smirk
Chuck stood as the murmuring began to erupt, raising one hand the entire place was silent yet again.
"You won't think that when you're older." Dean smirked at the dark haired little version of his brother Sam.
Castiel stood there awkwardly, wings stiff and shoulders rigid as he didn't know what to do, his blue eyes pleaded with Gabriel to do something
"We head home heroes, but none as much a hero as they who died for their people, Long live the Freedom of Heaven!"
As his hand hit the door he smiled at the familiar smell of his two younger brothers, Sam, who had recently presented as an Alpha and was named the future King, and Adam, his little half brother not yet presented.
"What is it? You're never this serious and if it has something to do with Michael's future Mate... What did the freckled jackass do?" Lucifer grumbled before sitting in a chair across from Gabriel whom remained standing beside a second chair.
Castiel said nothing, but he did blink rapidly, taken aback by Dean's outburst. One step, two steps back away from the hunter, hands still trembling, tears streaked down his scarred cheeks like he'd been slapped in the face
Dean tilted his head looking down slightly as he laughed. It felt nice that he could laugh with Michael.
Castiel blinked as he realised he probably look scary to the small boy with his wings so puffed out. Lowering and folding them in Castiel crouched back down and sat on the ground
The Alpha was so close to Dean's face he could practically taste the alchohol on the Demon's breath. It was nauseating. Yet, Dean had to fight the urge to try and get closer and that disgusted him to no end. He wasn't some knot hungry whore and he hated his body for trying to say otherwise.
The Winchester wasted job time sliding into the hole, trying not to injure himself, angel blade clutched in his fist a lifeline of sorts.
With a hand on his sword and a twitch of his wings Lucifer looked around quickly trying to find where they may have gone.
Dean refused to be looked at as if he was weak, but he was glad for Cas leading the horse by the reigns so he didn't need to think.
"Blue. But not just any blue..." He tilted his head staring at something afar off and distant, a shady smile grasping his full lips "The kind of blue that holds the entire sky, the depths of the deepest oceans, and the lightening of the gods in it... The kind of blue that holds kindness and sorrow, joy and conviction all rolling in one soul piercing shade of blue that you just can't... You can't really put into word but it's there, and everytime you look at something blue, it reminds you of a piece of that one shade that pierces your very being." Dean stopped his hands hovering as he had been gesturing all over the place.
Shaking his head and flexing his wings he went back to his post at the palace gates. They were expecting visitors and he knew any moment some would be arriving.
"Sorry he didn't let you take him to prom. Not my problem buddy." Dean groaned as he struggled against the Angel's grip
"No. I went to him with a few questions." The Archangel went about scanning the walls of books, Sam suddenly beside him "I'm sure Dean will be alright though Sam. He's one tough guy."
Yes, Lucifer eventually wanted a family. He wanted to be on top first, marry this beautiful honey pot and settle. Though the thought absolutely terrified him. What If he was a parents like his Father? Or his Aunt Amara? That was the last thing he wanted. He wanted his children to have the perfect apple pie life, and he had to be on top first. Life was dangerous and he needed to be on top and untouchable first.
"You mean the Omega Prince that human John was originally going to give /me/ before the war broke out? You lot slimy had to give the dumb human a sweeter deal am I right?" Crowley laughed at the glare that hardened on Castiel's face, the twitch of feathers from Lucifer and the way Michael's jaw flexed in controlled irritation.
"I'm sure he will be." Castiel smiled stiffly, wings shuffling close to his back. He needed to speak with Gabriel, and perhaps Michael. He needed to stop this wedding. He thought that maybe he could learn to move on, but he couldn't.
He couldn't have Lucifer, and Castiel couldn't have Dean, as much as it hurt it's how life was. It was the hand they'd been dealt.
Lucifer was growing angry. How dare some Omega talk to him like that? Didn't they teach this people any manners?
Dean nodded and swallowed. He didn't say anything in fear his voice would shake or waver even slightly. As it was he was fighting every nervous urge he had to shrink away and die.
"It's not simple. But he's ok. Just like you're okay, and Lucifer is okay, complicated, but okay. Alright?"
Michael forced the tears back as he returned the tight embrace, wings stretching out slightly on either side of the Human King.
With a beat of his pure white wings Michael shot up into the air and looked around. He couldn't tell where the intruder could have gone but he figured perhaps Madame Lilith may know something.
Lucifer's black horse was brought to him and he grabbed the reigns before dismissing three of the four search parties. With a frown he glanced once more at Castiel and then to Gabriel but still neither of them said a word.
Assuming that's what was going on, he did still take the route to his room that went past Dean's chambers.
we're nearing the end my Moosen! But Mama has already got ideas for a book 2 and 3 sooooo maybe this is just the beginning? Idfk
"Than what is it?" Dean swallowed and focused on the side of Michael's face. The Archangel had a very handsome profile, Dean felt bad he had to marry him instead of someone that would appreciate and love Michael like Dean knew he never could
Benny didn't say another word, but Dean noted how the Alpha's nose twitched when the Prince brushed past him.
"Oh, murder! What a car..." he mumbled, running his hand along the door handle. "She is a beauty." the detective agreed, opening the door and getting in. "You're quite the lucky fella, aren't you, Dean." Michael teased, setting his hat and the file down in his lap.
"I-" Dean sprang to his feet and on shaken legs grabbed the nearest thing he could find, a decorative marble flower pot, dumped out the contents and threw up anything he'd eaten recently, tears running once again down his blood streaked face. The commotion around him made it hard to focus as sound all gurgle together in waves of just blind noise, the bitter smell of flesh, the iron scent of blood and some pain in his arm made it hard to focus on anything as the Omega Prince gripped the side of the now mostly empty flower pot. The stench if his vomit hit his nose on top of everything else only making the nausea worse
"Yes well, I needed to speak to you privately." Gabriel's wings shifted before folding close to his back "My father cannot know about this conversation."
Dean hated when these things happened. Sam had presented as an Alpha and ever since he and their Father never really got along.
Cas was I'm the kitchen digging in the freezer, muttering and mumbling to himself. He closed the door with a sigh, as the cold air felt amazing in his face.
Michael turned to the shorter girl and took the now crumpled letter from her fist. Cutting it open he hastily read the letter and without a further word bolted from the dining room and out into the hall.
It was normal in the royal family to present at a young age, around 9 or 10, and Samandriel had presented as the only Omega in the family at the age of almost 9. The kingdom, instead of celebrating mourned when he was suddenly gone without a trace at the height of the war a year ago.
"I've been challenged for the throne." Michael said steadily and Lucifer didn't stop the deep growl that rumbled his chest and he quickly stood up, hand on the hilt of his sword
"My brother has challenged me for the throne. We duel at noon for the crown," Michael looked at Dean and his eyes and voice softened "And for you as our bride."
"Pray, tell us what is going on. Why this Abaddon claims you're dead, that she is Queen, and why my future husband was kidnapped and tortured by her men." Michael sat straight, chin up and wings on a subtle display of who was in fact in control of this situation
Michael of course nodded with a small smile. Stood up and offered the Queen his hand, wings shuffling to be more comfortable, one stiff and aching from being injured, but feeling better.
After an awkward, silence filled dinner the Prince's all excused themselves to bed early, Queen Kate excused herself and Adam to an early bed as well, leaving John, Chuck, and Crowley alone.
So naturally Lucifer kept his men in check. Constantly lecturing about how that is no way to talk about a future ruler of their kingdom.
Michael was pulled from his thoughts by clammy trembling hands gripping his own, blinking the angel gave Dean's trembling hands a gentle squeeze
Upon opening the door to the bedroom Michael frowned and became worried as all that he found was a neatly made bed and dark room.
He couldn't breath, couldn't think, couldn't see past the tears in his eyes. Lucifer looked around wildly unable to hear over the shattering of his heart, the beating of his frantic wings, and the gaspy sobs that tore from his throat in painful heaves.
Lucifer dove down towards a little cottage near the stables, landing outside he knocked urgently and firmly on the door.
The other person was obviously human judging by no shadow of wings or horns. Slightly taller than Castiel and of a bit of a broader build, Michael knew it was Dean. This was confirmed by their scents mingling on the wind, mingling perfectly in a balance of Vanilla Coffee.
King Chuck looked younger, his beard had less gray and his wings were whiter, Michael looked maybe 20. Raphael and Gabriel were teenagers while Balthazar was barely a teen and there was a little Castiel as a child. The Queen looked so much like Castiel it was nearly startling. Long wavy black hair and eyes to out blue the sky, a smile to warm the coldest heart, her wings nearly as black as Castiel's but with gold edges to them, and in her arms was a small blond infant.
"Castiel!" Michael shouted grabbing his brother's arm and forcing him to turn away from the startled demon "What is wrong withyou!? We came to speak with her! Not threaten her!"
"And I love getting you gifts. I know the other ladies at the bank are jealous of how pretty you are with those Pearl's I got ya. Even without my presents you're still the most beautiful gal in the world." Lucifer stated as they continued on
Michael raised an eyebrow and gently took the letter, taking a small knife from his belt, his wings stiffened unsure of whether this was good news, or if it was quite the contrary.
But the angel kept th heart beating and the breath breathing anyway. It honestly was a comfort to Dean, to feel, and hear the strong heart beat under his hear. The warmth of Castiel pressed against him was soothing. Dean didn't say anything, and Castiel didn't press him to.
Castiel's mouth flopped open, he sat there fumbling for an excuse but the Alpha came up with nothing as his gaze fell to his feey
Though he had the temper and attitude of an Alpha the poor Prince had presented as Omega four years ago at the age of 14.
"As for moving out, you know I love my house. I--" she started, biting her lip to stop herself from dropping the bomb too early. "I'm not in a hurry to move out. Even if I'd love for you to not have to drive all the way across the city each day, I think your brothers won't stand a chance. I got the most handsome one anyway, no doubt." Kelly grinned happily, tilting her head until it was resting on Lucifer's shoulder - the perks of spacious cars with one big, continuous front seat.
It was quite a lot of Alpha for one room and the Omega Prince had to swallow hard at all the dominating scents in the room.
"I do believe this has been enough drama for one lifetime! Now, Michael dear let's get you officially King and then we shall settle the desires of the heart." She purred motioning for the Minister to come away from the wall where he had plastered himself in prayer.
"Oh Sammy, just call the dear thing Jessica, that is how she insists we address her Afterall." Dean chuckled and to him this was good. This felt good. It felt right, he needed just time with his family.
The demon turned and gave Dean a smile that honestly made him uncomfortable, her lipstick was as red as blood and so were her long manicured nails.
"Be safe then. If-if you're not back by the wedding, I'm coming after you myself and, and you won't be able to stop me." Sam gave Gabriel a firm lipped look that meant business
Dean decided to trust her, afterall he needed one friend around here and she seemed nice, he didn't remember much from his heat except it was uncomfortable as always.
Castiel simply hummed in response before erupting into exaggerated snores, trying not to smile as Dean continued to curse and mumble under his breath. The bed shifted and squeaked as Dean got up, he had already shed his shirt in an attempt to keep cool, and now the sweatpants were kicked across the room, catching on the closet doorknob with a dull thud. Now just in his boxers Dean grumbled about being all sweaty
"Raphael would have no other way." Gabriel added in a hushed tone. Wings enveloped Michael as Gabriel, Balthazar and Castiel hugged their eldest brother and silently mourned the loss of Raphael. It pained all of them tremendously, that not only Raphael had forced this on Michael, but that he had been so driven to not heed any reason whatsoever.
"Good. I, and my family appreciate the initiative." Chuck commented glancing at Castiel and giving him that look that Father's give their children to silently tell them to straighten up and behave. Tk which Castiel did straighten his posture, readjust his wings and lifted his chin respectfully
"Oh! Good morning Dean!" Charlie smiled with a tilt of her head "I came with the laundry. I didn't mean to wake you." The red head smiled cheerfully as she began to put the Prince's clothes away
"Rebuilt her in my free time actually." Dean smiled a little wider, chest puffed out in pride as he patted the hood as he rounded to the drivers side, the top was down and he didn't even bother to open the door, just sorta held the top of the door and jumped in. Once he landed firmly in his seat, he ran his hands over the steering wheel with a smile.
With a defeated sigh Cas sat his head up enough to lazily grab a beer from beside his bed, where Chuck had found the stuff he never knew, nor did he ask. He just always supplies Dean with a stash, well, now it was Castiel's stash. Popping the lid the greasy haired hunter took a long swig and only stopped chugging when he needed to breathe.
"But I'm not." Dean swallowed thickly, emerald eyes flicking up to gaze into almost familiar blue, but they swirled with electrically flickering grace, full of rage, sorrow and power
"Ah, the Princess Bitch is awake." A voice off to Dean's left spoke, it was a voice that was uncomfortable on his ears, slimy and through the nose.
If a guy like Dean was to approach, well, anyone… people would stop what they were doing and help, talk, greet him, watch. However, it was obvious Dean knew exactly how good he looked- another little problem Michael tried very hard to hide. The raven-haired man with his fair skin and captivatingly light eyes wasn't just a very devoted, dutiful, rational detective with no time to flirt or sleep around. He simply couldn't bring himself to like the physical company of a woman. And God forbid if this ever got to anyone's attention Mike would lose his badge, his gun and probably anything else he owned.
"I can't do this anymore." He sniffed, blue eyes blinked several times to clear the fog of tears, red and puffy from hours of silent sobbing. He had sobbed loudly, ugly cries had torn through his throat when he found Dean. Begged him to wake up, eading for this to be some ugly twisted joke, screaming at him to wake up and be fine, to breath, to smile, to shout at him, anything! But now all Castiel could do was silently let the tears fall.
John's face fell, Sam could see anger and sorrow on his father's face and he didn't know what to say, what to do. He sat there with a punched expression as he watched his brother for not the first time in the last few days just, crumble.
"It was an honor." Castiel replied with a small nod of his head, he bowed slightly again, wings spreading slightly "Your brother is a remarkable Omega, not like any I have ever seen. He gave his abuser quite a fight I think." He noted as he remembered seeing Alistair's broken nose, bruised face and wrapped up hand
It did not take long for Castiel to find Lucifer. The Archangel was outside, arms crossed over his armored chest as he watched an official looking carriage leave down the road and off into the countryside
The armies had camped in fields and near villages where Wendigos or Werewolves, Vampires or Wraiths, would bring them food or water their horses.
His head snapped up to Castiel, eyes widening and mouth opening to speak, hands reaching for his gun, as the angel strode forwards before the hunter could actually get ahold of his weapon, The angel touched his forehead, putting him to sleep, scooped him up in his arms and disappeared.
The Archangel's gold wings shook with his shoulders as he buried his nose in Sam's shoulder. Arms coming around the human's middle, clutching the back of his shirt like a lifeline
The floppy haired Winchester hummed as he swung his legs over the large bed and stretched his arms over his head with a grunt
"OH! Michael Barnes! He's your brother in law?" Dean laughed motioning for Castiel to follow him into the garage
But the Alpha in the door way, with sparks falling around him like gold snow, with eyes glowing with angel grace, wings a fluffed mess of a winter's night, hair a tussled mess of hurry and concern, and the scent of fresh coffee and old books.
"Of course not. I only had one son try to over throw my eldest who was then forced to take his life. Though I knew Raphael was up to something. I didn't realize to what extent and I fear it may be deeper than we initially thought." Chuck pressed his fingertips together with a frown, his graying wings twitched "At least you got out in time. One threat has been eliminated but Abaddon is still an issue. Eve will behave for now but I have no idea how John will be when we receive his letter. We sent one to him upon the Omega being returned and should receive his letter in three days."
"Are you alright? Why were you running? What happened?" When Dean didn't answer and simply tried to catch his breath Michael turned to his two younger brother's
The two becoming fast friends at the young age of twelve, there relationship had always been different and Lucifer knew it was love when he presented at 15. Michael had already presented when they met but that didn't matter.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"No." Dean spoke truthfully now calmer knowing the intruder wasn't going to hurt him. "I slept decently but not well. It was..." Dean looked down at the twisted sheets around his body and to the trenchcoat he was clutching with one hand "Eventful." He smiled sadly before his eyes flicked up to meet Charlie's.
Castiel had been sent to train a few new knights and would not be back until late that night, Sam was buried in books and old war maps in the library, upon speaking to the lad Sam had kindly told Gabriel he needed some space. The Angel was not the kind of person to deny someone of such a thing, and headed off to Unfortunately, aide in the planning of his recently deceased brother.
"I said, get the fuck out!" Dean spun around to face Castiel, hands clenched into tight fists, knuckles bruised and scraped open.
Castiel buried his face in his hands as silent tears streamed down his stubble cheeks. Pills and beer forgotten, joint finished, as he felt his trembling hands rub at his face.
"What happened to his hand? It wasn't bandaged like that when I spoke to him this morning." The Archangel whispered to Charlie, his pure white wings shifted before settling behind his back again
"This better be fucking- Your Highness." He paused with a slight bow as he saw one of the Princes before him "To what do I owe the pleasure Gabriel?" Lucifer's face softened as he looked at the younger Prince. Honestly Lucifer really liked Gabriel, he was a troublemaking kid and Lucifer found it hilarious. He had taught the blond Prince many tricks as the boy grew up and it was in fact a treat to see him, though a bit concerning at such a late hour
Michael had to of misheard his brother. Yes Raphael was not directly in this immediate royal family, but he had been adopted when a close family friend of their father's died. Raphael was as much a brother as the ones that shared blood.
The door opened to a sleepy and fuzzy headed Alpha, blood and pink colored wings in a fluffed mess and a scowl on his face
"Your brother will be alright." Michael tried to comfort the human, wings twitching not knowing how, it was a lot of information to take in "He's strong. I'm sure it's ok."
Chuck stood, with a low rumbling growl, his wings shuffled and rose in dominance, chin raised and nostrils flared as his irri scent came off the Alpha with a hard glare.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Yes I am. Though I'm afraid I don't remember where the dining room is..." He frowned hating that he felt utterly useless.
As the one working headlight of the dinged up old gold car turned off Dean raised an eyebrow. The whole front end of the car was dented in, and as driver stumbled out of the vehicle Dean tilted his head. The driver had dark tousled hair and a strong jaw, a bit of scruff, his shoulders slumped and he was practically drowning in an old dusty looking trench coat that swished around his ankles. Piercing blue eyes squinted through large dark glasses as he approached the three mechanics
"No. Typical Alpha, I mean Alphas refuse to admit when they have a fear. Really, I see it in my father, I went out of my way when I learned I was an Omega to teach my brother Sam that it's ok to be afraid." He flexed his hands and looked back up from the ground and up at Michael.
Sam raised and eyebrow letting go of Gabriel's swollen knuckles, one hand going to his hip as the other tucked hair behind his ear
But all good things come to an end. To soon it seemed Lucifer pulled away from the Crowned Prince, to soon did Michael's hand leave Lucifer's cheek, to soon were their wings untangled and folded behind their backs, to soon did they step away from eachother and back into the real world. The real world where Alpha Princes, and Alpha Generals weren't allowed to be together. In the real world where Alpha's and Alpha's weren't together, and Princes didn't fall in love with Knights, but with handsome Omega's.
Castiel wasn't a child. He was 18 and yes, the youngest in the family, if he ever took the throne it would only be if everyone in his family died, but he was already a Captain and was very skilled with a blade. He didn't need to be treated like a child!
"Listen here Cassie, Hannah may be pretty, and she may be nice, but she's too ordinary. If it weren't for business I'd say break of this silly engagement. But Pop I guess knows what he's doing. After All if ya marry the head haunches daughter, then it isn't weird for the family to have someone working on the banks, and Hannah being the man's only daughter, means the banks will probably be going to you when he bites the dust. It makes perfect sense from a business perspective. BUT!" Gabriel exclaimed popping back out of his chair and swinging his body to the music, but of course faster than one would to classical music.
"We were supposed to win. We were supposed to go live a, a happy life. We were going to be happy! But then-then" Castiel stopped speaking, a sad and twisted scowl on his face "He's dead. He died in my arms and I caused it! I killed him! How fucked up is that?" A laugh bubbled out of the broken Angel's lips. It made Dean's skin crawl, his heart shattered at the broken being in front of him.
"Charlie, it's nothing like that. I just- I had a lot on my mind and overreacted." Dean gulped placing a hand gently on the woman's shoulder
"How did the hunt go?" Castiel asked looking between the boys concerned. Both seemed a little beat up, but nothing to serious. The trenchcoat angel reached up, planting two fingers on Sam's head, his scrapes and bruises healing with a glitter of grace
Michael bolted out the side doors towards the stables, Lucifer was grumbling and petting his horse's nose as Michael hurried up to him. The Crowned Prince stopped, put his hands on his knees and tried to catch his breath
"I would've come, but shit went down with Lydia and I wasn't able to come." Dean huffed waving at the little boy with the curly light brown hair "Who's this little guy?"
"No. I could smell the difference in your scent. I figured you would tell me in your own time." John reassured his eldest son with a tilt of his head "Don't let Michael force you to do anything you don't want to about it. It's your body and ultimately your choice."
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Giving his father a nod Dean smiled at his step mother Kate. The Beta queen enveloped him in her arms, petting his hair, his back, looking over his half bruised face. Peppering his cheeks, forehead, nose, with kisses
"I really got ya Dean!" The red head howled in delight. Her Beta scent was a welcome one to the Winchester, as was her laughter
Dean was officially out of the loop. He was used to people telling him he can't do this or shouldn't do that and he ignored it all the same.
Dean has to draw another breath at the image in his head, but he shakes his head, almost regretfully.
The ride home is quiet until about halfway when Cas says, “What a thoroughly unpleasant man”, voice full of disdain.
On feet that are half-numb, half-pins and needles, Dean stumbles towards the bedroom, collapsing on the bed as soon as he gets there. Cas gestures for him to scoot up it and lean against the pillows, and Dean does. His heart is beating hard, because this isn’t something they usually do. Outside of this, Cas will blow him and give him torturously long, slow handjobs, but during playtime, he never touches Dean’s cock unless it’s for more pain.
Then he’s behind Dean, pushing in, all but mounting him, his cock big and hot and filling Dean up in the best and worst of ways. The thrusts smear the come on Dean’s face, mixing with his snot and tears. Cas pins his hands behind his back, his other hand on Dean’s head, rubbing his face against the sheets.
“No!” Cas barks and slaps the two pieces of bread together. “You don’t call me that right now, Dean. You sit there, and you drink your water, and you eat your sandwich, and you sober. up.”
“Perhaps you should go in the corner and do so, then. I want to know what you were thinking, feeling, why you chose it.” Cas leans close, breath ghosting over Dean’s face. “If I’m going to own you, I’m going to own every single inch of you, from your first waking moment to when, where and how you close your eyes at night. That includes every thought and feeling you have in between then.”
The guilt eats at him, winds him tighter and tighter, and as much as he tries to relax, it’s a battle. He sleeps fitfully and wakes early, Cas snoring against his neck, an arm and a leg slung over him. Dean turns as gently as he can and studies Cas’s face. The soft lips, the stubble, the bridge of nose, forehead smoothed out in sleep.
Cas’s thumb digs into his ass cheek and Dean whines, high and pitiful, as Cas seeks out his sit bones on each side. Dean shakes his head against the floor, muttering
Dean smirks, coming up to kiss Cas again. Cas crushes their mouths together, the hand on Dean’s head pulling him close, and when they separate this time they lie panting next to each other for a while. It’s enough time to make Dean decide and he looks around, before meeting Cas’ gaze again. He coughs.
“Go slower,” Cas says, and Dean whimpers slightly and slows down. “Slower. There. Good. You can get off, if you don’t irritate me.”
Something in Castiel seemed to pause, and he took a few steps back close to Dean, eyes again searching out Dean’s, but he couldn’t meet them. He stared straight ahead, until Castiel came up right in front of him, tilting his head.
To say Dean cries a lot in the first few weeks would be an understatement. Tears become his companion. Tears of pain, when his cock strains to harden and can’t; of frustration, when Cas suckles on the cage and licks through the bars; of anger, when he wants to yank the stupid thing off of himself; of defeat, because he’s stuck in it and there’s nothing he can do about it.
Dean has been shifting and wriggling in bed since they let the lights out, restless and with his dick twitching. Normally, he’d have slid out of bed at this point, gone to the bathroom and silently jerked off into the toilet, so that he could come back and sleep, but that’s not allowed any more. He manages to stay still for a few minutes, before slowly rolling his hips against the bed. He isn’t touching, he justifies, just rubbing.
“Our honeymoon--” Cas says and breaks off. “I loved that. You were so far down, the entire time. It was like I had you under my thumb and was mashing you to pieces, until nothing existed but my pet, the only thing I allowed to remain.”
“Wanna be good for you,” Dean murmurs, unable to look up at Cas. “I need it so bad, I always need it so bad. Need you inside me, filling my holes with your cock. It feels so good when you’re inside me. You fill me like nobody else.” His face burns. “It’s like I was made for your cock, Daddy. Made to scream on your cock, for you to play with. When you don’t, it gets so confused!”
“Hey, fuck you,” Dean mutters to the guy that shoulders past him and knocks his overpriced drink over.
He can’t keep position with the wood paddle. It’s hard and heavy and it rocks him forward with every smack. Left, right, sitspot, sitspot. Cas goes slower, but hits harder, and it’s not long before tears sting Dean’s eyes, and not long after that that he’s kicking his feet, sobbing into the comforter. He’s on fire, and everything is pain, and he’s sorry, he’s so sorry. He distantly realises he’s babbling, screaming out his apologies as Cas keeps going.
He doesn’t shock Dean once. Not on the drive there, not in the store, not on the way back, not while unloading the lumber. Not even after he makes Dean nail together a trellis for … whatever the heck, Dean doesn’t listen and he doesn’t care, because holy god there’s a steel band around his balls and he could get electrocuted at any point in time.
“I keep waking up with it poking at me, it’s very inconvenient for a fucktoy. It’s just so… demanding.”
Dean whines as loudly as he can, trying and failing to thrust into Castiel’s hand, which is jerking him so. goddamn. slowly. He’s going to explode, the embers inside him now a roar, the buzzing under his skin unbearable,. He writhes and tries to pull more air in through his nose. He’s soaring, so far gone he doesn’t know if he’ll ever find his way back, but then Castiel’s hand is gone and the other one pinches his nose closed and the world stops. He can’t breathe through the gag, and his lungs are so full. He leans his head back against Castiel’s shoulder, trying to catch his eye, and Castiel looks back at him, eyes warm and soft as though he isn’t stealing Dean’s air at all. Dean’s cock
Damn Cas. Dean knows he’s blushing bright red all the way down his chest, even though he’s refusing to look down to confirm.
“No. Red. Stop. Go get dressed. I can’t talk about this while you’re still naked,” Cas says, then stalks into the kitchen. Dean hears the patio door open, then slam shut, and sighs.
Dean growled and frankly it sounded more like a wounded whimper and he mentally slapped himself over and over for sounding weak
Sam let out the breath he hadn't realized he was holding. The human watched as Gabriel went back to reading titles, pulling out a few rolled up maps and old dusty books, filling his arms until the stack reached his nose.
"I am sure of it. I need to head out now. Benny will stay with you until your father arrives to walk you into the auditorium." Dean turned to face her as Kate placed a sweet kiss to Dean's forehead
He shifts, feeling the uncomfortable weight in his bladder. Isn’t exploding bladder a thing? Before he knows he’s doing it, he’s slid off the counter and bolted for the stairs, trying to get to the master bath which Cas couldn’t have locked since he used it this morning.
Thankfully, oh, mercifully, the bedroom is right next to the stairs, which is good because Cas seems so fond of shoving now, and he’s backing Dean into the room, shoving him onto the bed. There, he pauses in the middle of climbing on top of Dean, one knee on the mattress between Dean’s splayed legs, one hand next to Dean’s shoulder.
“I like not having any control. I like not knowing what’s going to happen. I like being scared - not
In no time, Dean’s whimpering and shouting “Daddy, Imma come, Imma come, please”, and a hand on his hip encourages him to fuck up into Cas’s movements, and Dean’s gone. It’s a rush, as intense as any orgasm, leaving him shaking and panting after.
Cas lets him go and Dean sags to the floor, barely able to see. He’s coiled tighter than a spring, guilt and pain mixing and tearing him apart from the inside, a dark beast ripping him limb from limb and nothing makes sense.
He goes into the bathroom and undresses quickly. He’d never assumed he’d be like this, that they’d be like this. Neither had Cas, for that matter. Dean’s the loud one, laughing openly and filling Castiel’s life with movement and madness, but Castiel makes him stop. Like this, like now. He’d known they’d play today, Castiel said as much this morning. Cas starts a little later on Wednesday mornings, and Dean tends to do the same whenever work permits, staying late on Mondays instead. Most of the time, on Tuesdays after work, Dean’s just like this. Quiet. Pliant. Obedient. It still rattles him and chafes somewhere inside from time to time, but not today. As he showers and prepares per Castiel’s earlier instructions, he’s not nervous at all.
He crests without going over, and knows his cock is drooling come onto the bed, cries as the amazing orgasm he’d been building towards disappears through his cock, leaving him frustrated and unfulfilled, oversensitive and gaping open.
“Don’t ever make me do this to you again,” Cas whispers. “I love you. I don’t want to hurt you.” Dean snorts, and Cas amends, “Not more than you want to be hurt. Speaking of...”
Dean jerks his head up and sees tears in Cas’s eyes. He doesn’t have time to say anything, as Cas’s eyes widen and Dean suddenly remembers, ducking his head again. Cas grabs Dean’s chin, forcing him to look up.
Except... One night turns into a booty call turns into 3am pancakes at that one diner with the weird smelling waitress.
Dean manages a pathetic nod. He belongs here. Cas grinds himself into Dean’s face, smearing tears and snot everywhere and Dean wants him so bad, wants him in his mouth, in his throat, wants to be speared on Cas’s cock in any way possible. When Cas pulls him away, he opens his mouth and stretches his tongue out, trying to beg with his entire body.
He’s asked Dean to come shirtless and smiles, watching him talking to the short brunette in a black underbust, in his bare feet and low, soft jeans. That’s how it works for them. He asks, and Dean chooses whether to follow or not. There’s an element to their relationship that’s unequal, sure, but a long-term D/s arrangement wouldn’t work for them. Perhaps mostly because as much as Castiel identifies himself in terms of dominant, but not a sadist, Dean identifies as a masochist, but not a submissive. What they do, despite their discrepancies, is meet and match in that grey area in between labels.
“I dream about you catching me jerking off,” Dean says, looking straight into Cas’s eyes. “You make me come over and over and over again until it hurts so bad, and then you wait just enough that I can come again, and you wait again, until you’ve drained me dry so many times I’m screaming when you touch me.”
Heavy blows rain down on Dean and he hangs his head, wriggling as he tries to deal with the pain. Cas lights his ass right on fire, hard, unrelenting blows until Dean’s forced down on his elbows, sobbing.
Neither of them care about the mess or the sheets as Cas draws him in and Dean goes, burying his face in Cas’s chest.
Dean’s cheeks are aflame and shame burns hot in his chest, even as Cas’s hand on his cock sends pleasure coursing through him.
Cas shoves the plate at him. Dean takes the sandwich, but it tastes like dust. He eyes the corner again, as Cas turns to grab his tea mug. He leans back against the counter, both hands clasped around the mug, and watches Dean eat.
Dean doesn’t say it, but the fact that Cas shoves his him down onto his knees, back against the wall, and fuck his mouth as though Dean’s nothing more than a convenient hole, probably does more to settle him than anything else.
By the time there are six circular marks on the inside of his right thigh, looking like large paw prints as they meander from knee to groin, Dean is sobbing again. His shoulders are screaming, his wrists are sore and probably bruised, his chin is covered in drool, and his balls throb with pain. Cas hums, pleased, and presses the heel of his hand against his own crotch, the first sign Dean’s seen of him being turned on at all.
It's a far cry from now, when Cas is comfortable with what they do, as likely to kiss Dean as he is to backhand him, as likely to whisper love as he is abuse. Case in point when Dean comes in from throwing away the garbage and finds himself shoved into the wall.
Dean does, though perhaps it’s more stumbling. He’s shaking so bad his fingertips feel like they’re vibrating. He waits by the bed while Cas digs in his closet of doom. He comes back out with a hairbrush. A
The way he instantly puts the mug and Kindle down, and comes over to press Dean into the counter, his tongue fucking slow and languid into Dean’s mouth, is kind of telling.
He’s so scared, he grabs Cas’s hand under the table and holds it for a long time. That’s his story if anyone asks. They don’t though, and Cas only smiles and kisses his knuckles.
Some time later, the plug gets removed and Cas uses his hole again, leaving Dean locked up and bagged while he does. A smaller plug replaces the first, but that’s all right. It must be night time, because it’s dark even inside the bag. He wakes up once during the night, because Cas swings his legs over Dean’s chest, rubbing his cock over the coarse material of the bag until he comes all over it. Come soaks into it and Dean tries to suckle at the material but it doesn’t quite work. He falls asleep again, the scent of Cas all around him.
“I want this cycle to end,” Cas says firmly at the end. “We keep facing the same issue over and over. He says he wants me to own him, I get scared he wants to leave or that I’m abusing him, or he gets scared I’m going to leave and then I get scared he wants to leave.”
. He whines when Castiel pinches his nipples, pets him, scratches over his chest, trails his fingers over Dean’s balls. He jerks forward, chasing the friction, and keens in frustration when all it does is pull the dildo out, only for it to sink back in.
Dean scrambles to his feet, but of course Cas isn’t going to make it easy for him. Cas makes him sit on his lap, then bend down and put his hands on the floor, knees on either side of Cas’s hips.
“Dirty,” Cas says, voice as cold as the ice he shoved into Dean earlier. “Dirty and desperate. Look at you, I could put on a damn show, just you desperately trying to get off, anyway you can. Are you going to come, hmm?”
His vision blurs with tears. He lets them fall while Cas flicks on the TV, eats his sandwich and drinks his tea, wearing his fugly bathrobe.
The house is quiet when Dean gets home after work. He orders pizza, because Cas has been on some sort of health binge lately and it’s been all bbq chicken breasts and roasted vegetables. He drinks beer. He goes to sleep feeling pretty decent, hugging Cas’s pillow tight.
Cas hums. “I don’t know if there’s any gay friendly therapists around here, and I was reading up on abuse cases, and they say the abuser and the survivor shouldn’t go to therapy together, so I was thinking we’d go individually. Maybe ten times? I think my insurance might cover that, I don’t know. I’ll look into it.”
Cas draws a sharp breath behind him, and Dean turns his head to look back. Cas’s eyes are wide and he’s got a hand on his cock, staring at Dean like he’s never seen him before.
The only thing missing is the crate, but instead Dean gets Cas’s arms wrapped tight around him, and that’s even better.
“I’m trying!” Dean wails, then thrashes as the spoon comes down harder on the tops of his thighs. “Daddy!”
Shame burning through him, Dean nods. Cas could. Anywhere, anytime, Dean would welcome him, stare at strangers walking past as Cas uses him like he’s supposed to.
“Look at you,” Cas breathes in his ear. “Cock hard and ready for me. You’re going to try so hard, aren’t you? Don’t worry, baby. So will I.”
“You realise this is not my office, I’m not on the clock, and this is highly unprofessional of me,” the man says. “Fuck off.”
He draws a deep, deep breath, choking on it, coughing and falling forward, uncoordinated, burying his head in Cas’ lap and trusting. It’s impossible to tell if he’s still crying, but he’s noisily heaving in deep breaths, trembling hard, the other arm slung limply over Cas’ legs.
“Is this what you needed?” he snarls in Dean’s ear. “Does my fuck hole remember who it belongs to now?”
“I said, I wanted you to hurt me forever. I meant that, I still do. Babe, I love you.” Crap, now he’s really blushing, and Cas has gone doe eyed. “I need … more.” Dean searches for words. “I need all of you. I know you’re one sadistic, controlling bastard, and I love all of that. Can you… stop holding back?”
Dean’s cock isn’t little, it’s entirely average, long and slender with a nice curve, thank you very much. Hearing Cas call it
, but of the unknown, of what’s going to happen next and if it’s going to hurt or if it’s going to be embarrassing.”
Castiel shirt against his side made him bite back a whine, as Castiel released one arm and then the other, letting him slump down on the floor when his knees buckled. Dean rested his forehead against the bedspread, smelling the laundry detergent Castiel favoured, eyes closed. The world was a pinprick moment of the throbbing heat of his back and darkness, but this was good darkness. He felt the bed shift below his forehead and then the softness of Cas sweatpants when he managed to pry his eyes open enough. He was exhausted and raw, and while he’d never been someone to sleep after a scene like this, there was something he had to do.
Cas is waiting for him in the living room. It takes one look before he’s in right Dean’s face, pushing him back so he hits the door. One hand grips his jaw, Cas’s entire arm pressing down his chest, his elbow digging into Dean’s sternum. Cas leans in close and sniffs.
Cas’s fingers slip in, and then Cas is fucking them in and out, cruelly twisting and hooking them against Dean’s prostate, even as the spoon marks the most sensitive areas of Dean’s thighs. Dean kicks his feet where they’re bent up near Cas’s shoulders, wriggles his hips trying to get away.
When the timer beeps for a third time, Cas is up in his space before he can start arguing about pressing the button.
The sigh Cas heaves as he tears himself away makes Dean grin. Yeah. A cuddly Cas is a good Cas. He bets Cas is going to sleep all across him too, plastering himself onto Dean until their skin sticks together and Dean wakes up feeling like he’s being crushed under Cas’s weight. It’s pretty damn awesome.
“Well, you can choose. That’s option A. Option B is… well. I won’t tell you. You can have the known, or the unknown.”
That’s when the tears come. Silently and suddenly, Dean blinks and finds he’s leaking all over Cas’s shoulder. He can’t stop. He doesn’t even have words for it, but he’s shaking, breath hitching in quiet sobs.
“Come on, that’s it,” Cas encourages. “I want you to come just like this. Come on. Show me how much you need to come, even though anyone could see you now. See your pretty panties. See how hard you get from wearing them. Do you think they would like it?”
Cas hands find his hair, holding him still and he’s happy to open up as Cas slowly, carefully, fucks himself into Dean’s mouth. He’s remembering now and it’s easy to open up. His chin is wet and he knows he must look so wrecked as he looks back up at Cas, who hisses and pulls Dean off, his other hand going to squeeze the base of his cock.
Dean slinks in the door on Friday evening, avoids looking at the living room and hurries upstairs. He undresses before he opens the bedroom closet, where he grabs Cas’s belt. He takes it between his teeth and crawls back downstairs to Cas. Cas is sitting in the living room, feet propped on the coffee table and TV remote in his hand. Quietly, Dean settles near his right foot, kneeling back and taking the belt in both hands before offering it up to Cas.
They kiss slowly and then Dean shifts so Cas can pull the t-shirt off him. The covers are rumpled below him when he falls back onto the bed, Cas tracing invisible patterns over his ribs, his stomach, stroking one hip. Dean should move, should do something, but Cas touch and kisses are so gentle that he thinks he’ll break if he does, so he lies there. Cas cradles his face in his hands, kisses his forehead again, trails light kisses over his eyelids and nose, stroking gently along his cheekbones.
He falls on the tiles, screaming, the electricity punching through him as Cas steps through the door. Cas stands there, and through the tears running down his cheeks, he can see Cas’s hardon thick in his pants.
“Maybe I should discipline your ass then, seeing as it’s so greedy you couldn’t do it. Pathetic, really, no self-control whatsoever.”
“What’s it worth to you?” Cas asks. “Hm? What’s it worth having an orgasm? Would you let me pour that hot sauce into your dick? Bet that would burn. Bet you’d scream so good. Would you do that for the chance to come?”
Dean can’t look away, because something is clearly really fucking wrong. He reaches for Cas, but Cas bats his hand away.
Dean closes his eyes, clutching at Cas’ shoulders, raking one hand over his face and trying to muffle his gasps. Then Cas pulls back again, sitting down over Dean’s hips and rocking their cocks together, which, okay, no, Dean just can’t be quiet through that.
Thank you for your amazing comments. While I haven't responded to all of you, I've read every single one and they've been as amazing as you are. To Luke and Darmys, who inadvertently started this whole thing, and to Dusky, Ada, Dea, LtleFlrt, Nadia and Morrigan who cheered it on: May all your kinky dreams come true.
Dean kicks. He writhes. He curses. He’s crying, whole body racked with sobs, by the time Cas stops. Except he stops only to pick up the hairbrush, which he brandies over Dean’s ass as though he hasn’t been spanked already.
Except for a few weeks later, he’s standing in a Starbucks, desperately wishing he had some. The ten high schoolers in front of him are more than enough to set his teeth on edge. He taps his foot as he watches the barista slam down a paper cup, push a strand of red hair behind her ear and turn back to make another mocha frappu-whatever. Why, oh God,
Cas pats him with the brush. “This is a nice shade on you. Mauve, I believe. Alright, last ones, pet. Three dozen.”
, Dean wants to say, but all he can do is flare his nostrils and keen. Castiel taps his cock with two fingers, bouncing it up against Deans stomach. He draws a breath. Castiel does it again and Dean let’s it out, only to suck in half a breath as quick as he can when he sees Castiel’s other hand rising and pinching his nose shut again. He stares into Castiel’s eyes, his own wide, body trying to fight for air.
One thing keeps tripping him up though. It’s mortifying. Even after several days, he still can’t look at Cas when he shuffles over and mutters,
“You’re mine, pet,” Cas says, and tears splash into Dean’s hair. “I won’t have you be a danger to yourself or someone else. I won’t lose you.”
This chapter got a bit heavy at the end, and I want to reiterate: This is not a snuff fic. Dean's not going to get hurt (any more than Cas intends to hurt him). Make no mistake, breathplay is dangerous. DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME. I mean it, THIS IS SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS. But, it's fictional, so Imma go with nothing bad happening, because I'm allowed to.
. I want you to control everything. Most of everything. I’m not gonna be a ballet dancer anytime soon, Cas, but like. What I eat, what I’m wearing, when and if I have sex, how I fuck, who I fuck. I want to please you. I want to brat and fight you and have you hurt me until I scream and then fuck me and use me, and make me free.”
They cuddle for a while longer, then Cas prompts him over to his stomach and sets about looking at the bruises.
“No!” Now Dean’s the one clutching Cas’s hand, as though he can communicate through the strength of his grip. “Why would I? You’re
“I’m so sorry, Daddy,” Dean sobs into his shoulder. “I’m so sorry, I won’t ever do it again, I swear, I swear.”
“Well, if you like,” Crowley says, “but underneath that you should perhaps add your expectations, requirements and limits.”
“I put myself and others at risk,” he says, drawing in a shuddering breath. “I shouldn’t ‘cause you love me and worry about me.”
It doesn’t take long before Dean’s feet fall asleep and the pain makes him wriggle a little, shifting on his knees. He can’t tell if that makes it better or worse, but he gets a warning hand on the back of his neck and settles… for a while. He would doze, but kneeling and leaning forward for this long is difficult, and soon he wriggles a little again. The hand on his neck moves over to his ear and pinches it hard, making him jerk and yelp around Cas’s cock, which is now definitely taking note of the proceedings.
“Seriously?” Dean hides his face in the sheets, then draws a breath. “I love it when you embarrass me, when you make me feel like I’m nothing, when you make me feel worthless and”--he’s struggling for air now--“when you use me. I jerk off to that stuff.”
“Now, I’m going to suck your cock anway, and it’s going to hurt, but the only one you’ve got to blame is yourself, do you understand that?”
A hand on his neck bends him forward. The paddle is no surprise, but it doesn’t make it any easier to bear. Cas goes hard, until Dean’s ass is on fire and he’s screaming, clinging to the patio railing, legs weak. That’s when Cas refastens the handcuffs behind his back, walks him into the garden and ties a single string from his cage to one of the lavender bushes.
Dean manages a nod before he bolts for the front door, where he picks up his jacket, folds it over his arm and returns to the living room.
“I’ve failed you,” he says wetly, then shakes his head as Dean opens his mouth. “No, wait, hear me out. I’ve clearly failed you, if you don’t think you can, or should, tell me things. I’ve let you run the show, I’ve done as you’ve asked with the kink and the bondage, because I thought we were both happy with that.”
“What if someone could see you now, boy?” Cas says. “They could all see how desperate you are. Have you seen your cock? Look at it.”
And okay, maybe Dean had this idea of a light spanking, some sexy fun time, when he started this. Now however, it plain hurts. He’s crying out with every blow, the leather paddle biting into his ass, the tops of his thighs. Cas is being stupidly meticulous, covering every angle of flesh from the tops of Dean’s ass cheeks and halfway down his thighs, swapping the angle of the paddle so that the tip can bite in properly all over.
“Why I didn’t tell you?” Dean laughs again, but it comes out more like a sob. “It never mattered before.
Which is true. After, he’d sat in his car for about ten minutes just staring into nothing, trying to understand what just happened. Then, he’d come to the conclusion he wasn’t going to, and driven himself home.
Cas’ eyes go wide. He cradles Dean’s face again, kissing him like he’s valuable, cherished - loved. He doesn’t know what to do with that idea and shoves it into the back of his mind. Cas rolls them over, kneeling above Dean again, before reaching to his nightstand and pulling out lube and a condom.
Dinner is eaten, Dean finds a beer, Cas waters the garden. The evening sunshine makes the shadows long, but the air is still warm. Dean closes his eyes for a moment, breathing in the scent of dust and grass, mind blissfully soft and blank.
"He was seen last heading to his room. Supposedly he had requested dinner alone in his room as his heat was coming on a little bit today." Gabriel looked up at Lucifer as he continued "If he was indeed taken by an Alpha as Michael said the scent in the hall outside his room indicated, then... Lucifer this could be bad. Any Alpha with a twisted mind would take advantage of an Omega in heat, and unmated. Not to mention the Alpha could get away with it as Omega's aren't always exactly reliable sources, as they are seen as breeding tools." Gabroel practically spit the word put with a grimace as if they had left a bad taste in his mouth "Heat or not wr cannot allow anything to happen to the Prince. He is our King's future husband, and the soon to be mate of my brother, please find him Lucifer."
Dean looked over at Sam and Adam as Gabriel, whom Dean had met briefly upon his arrival, and Balthazar, whom Dean had only heard mentioned, were dragging the young human Princes out of the room to show them around.
"No thank you. My ride will be here soon. I appreciate you wanting to call with an update but if I can request you text me instead? I am, not fond of speaking over the phone if it can be avoided." His intense eyes met Dean again and Dean couldn’t help but shift under the strange and almost inhuman gaze.
Michael turned and tilted a head at Dean in an almost childlike manner. It was hard to see the Alpha Prince as a war hero who had seen lives taken, and taken them.
As they exited the building into the warm humidity of the New Orleans evening air Dean pointed to the sleek black car, the Winchester beamed a proud flashy smile as Michael halted gaping at the sight of Dean's car.
Michael turned at the sound of the voice and the familiar scent if his brother Raphael. The Alpha let out a deep sigh.
"Such as why Raphael challenged Michael to the thrown, and why this Abaddon tried to have you assassinated."
Gabriel leaned against the wall, empty glass in one hand, the other still buried in the pocket of his slacks. "Nice change of subject." Gabe laughed "Well, the garages are fun. I get cars from all kinds of places and to all kinds of people. As for music, jazz is in. You'll have to deal with it" Gabriel pushed off the mantel, setting his glass down, hands up as he did some funny shuffle and spin "Maybe learn some swing." He spun around and pointed at Castiel "The ladies dig a cool cat with a swing."
Also like before mentioned I know squat shit about New Orleans, I'm from Indiana. My writing partner is from Switzerland and my editor is from Singapore... Enjoy this chapter
Dean threw his arms up to shield his face with a laugh and an all out food fight broke out among the Princes.
Michael and Lucifer dismissed themselves to clean up and rest, promising to see everyone at Breakfast the next morning.
Sam eventually pulled back a little, nose running and tears flowing freely, Sam's mouth twitched into a small smile before it became a frown.
"Yes." He stood rather abruptly, practically shoving the clipboard into Dean's outstretched hand "My contact number is there, if you cannot reach me Michael’s number is listed as my secondary contact. Insurance should cover a portion of the repair expenses." Castiel added with an almost flustered look on his face
"Do not Cry Michael." Dean pulled his feet from the water and scooted to sit closer to the Archangel, turned to face him as Michael shifted his body "You aren't the only one feeling this way. I-" Dean paused, wet his lips and tried to decide how to say what he wanted. "I don't think I could ever love you the way I'm supposed to either. Unfortunately my heart belongs to another as well and I can never get it back." Dean's hand shook slightly as he raised it up to rest on Michael's cheek, wiping the tears away with his thumb
Michael was a great guy, a nice Alpha, he would be a good ruler, he genuinely cared about Dean, and things couldn't be that bad right?
The two Angels were nearly invisible against the dark thundering clouds, illuminated only by the flashing lightening.
"Now," Castiel began as he leaned against the door, marks crossed over his chest "Let's share our names shall we? I'll go first. I am Alpha Prince Castiel the Free Willed. This." he motioned with a slight smirk, to Luicfer standing just behind him with a glare "Is the Archangel Alpha General Lucifer or better known as the Devil if the Cage"
A laugh erupted from Dean's chest as he laid back, holding his stomach "Don't worry! I didn't tell her she was some weird gift from her big brother that happens to be fucking God now so she wasn’t exactly born!"
Michael lay back to join him, wings splayed out and arms flopped out, much how one would do when making snow angels
Dean glanced around the room, a hand still firmly on Castiel's chest as the angel still held his arms tightly to stop him from tipping over. He noticed his father, standing over one of the yellow eyed Demons Abaddon had entered with, clutching his side with bloody fingers. Continuing to look around the room he took note that Adam and his mother were far from the commotion, Balthazar, sword in hand with them,, and Sam was by the doors with Gabriel struggling to keep Lucifer awake and gently moving his wings into a semi comfortable position.
"I'll let the cars be for now until the OK is passed to resume our business." Gabriel brought the Crystal glass to his lips, smiling slyly at Cas with that near-permanent mischievous glint in his eyes.
The Alpha gaurd followed with out a word as Dean made it to his room, Dean didn't talk to the gaurd, and the tall burly gaurd, a human that his father had sent, said nothing in return.
Castiel and Gabriel exchanged a look, but before either of them could act Balthazar was jumping over the railing, his tan wings flapped once or twice to steady his landing as he tripped to reach Michael.
Castiel's eyes darted around trying to find them. He had spent to long since coming to this world trying to locate the hunter, finding odd deaths that could've been supernatural, hitting dead ends, running into other hunters on the cases. He needed Dean, and he needed a location.
"No need to explain. I get it. Just, as long as you know what you're doing just... Uh" Dean stammered.
Charlie gave the freckled Prince a small smile "Was the fight because you're nesting?" She sighed and looked up at Dean again with something in her eyes the Winchester couldn't place "Because it's normal for Omegas to feel the urge to mest after experiencing trauma and stressful situations. You've undergone a lot. But Sam of all people should understand that right?"
"No." Gabriel shook his head and chuckled bitterly "He would never. Trust me Dean, Michael is a good man. Infact he told her if she didn't leave she would regret it."
Dean shifted on the end of his bed, he was very much not presentable for the King of all people to be talking to him, he was in night clothes, wrapped in a blanket with slippers and bed head, not to mention his bed was a nest right now, and Castiel's blood stained coat was among the pillows he had been cuddling
"No reason to be embarrassed. Gabriel and I started it Afterall. I am just surprised that you won!" He laughed again with a shake of his head and wings "But no Dean, sometimes it's nice to pretend you don't have responsibilities and duties to attend. Gabriel makes sure when things get stressful that we all kick back for a while."
"You will not speak to Gabriel in such a manner little brother." Michael spoke up without a glance to Gabriel and the flash if hurt that came over his face briefly as his golden wings sagged slightly
"Sam is right. Perhaps the King like seeing bossed by his rude Alpha Mate." Castiel chimed in much to everyone's surprise.
Michael didn't know what to say to that. It was true, the headstrong, speak your mind, fight the world Dean he had grown to care about wasn't the scared, submissive and frightened person he had just talked to.
Chuck left his children alone. He considered heading to his room as was the original plan. But something else came to mind.
Everyone flinching save their father Chuck who did not see it fit to butt into an argument his two grown Archangel sons could deal with themselves, even if the subject greatly upset the King
He wasn't some defenseless whore, he wasn't a damsel in distress and he'd be damned if this dick tried to use him without him giving him Hell.
Still Michael was frantically awaiting any news of the Omega. He had discussed with his father about canceling the wedding for at least another year, but Chuck had insisted that Dean would be found, and the wedding was only pushed two more months.
"How could he?!" Castiel growled his wings raising in irritation "Against his own brother and family!" The young Prince pulled his thing silver crown in one hand and ran his free hand through his hair "Michael, he's-He's our brother" Castiel's voice fell to a whisper and his wings drooped "Raphael does know what challenging you entails correct? A fight to the death, and if he wins not only has he killed his brother, shamed his family, but then Dean would have to be owed to him!"
"That's fine. So he was comfortable and taken care of?" Michael's wings twitched as he became nervous to meet his future husband
Every knight, Gaurd, King and Prince had swords at the ready to be drawn. Michael's wings shielded most of Dean, one arm out to try and shield the human as well. His other hand twitched at the handle of his sword as the wretched Queen prattled on.
The next morning, the wind seemed to shift over the sea, the air threatened rain but not a drop fell. Clouds rolling with an ominous energy, waiting for something to happen.
Gabriel on the other hand went rigid and stiff, he caught his cup with a sad frown and glanced briefly between his two oldest brothers and then to Sam.
"Describe her, than stay her with Your brother and Gabriel. I will send Castiel and two of his men in here to protect you. King Chuck won't let anyone hurt you, alright?" Lucifer snapped a couple of times in Dean's face to get the Prince to focus "Hey, your Highness, please focus and steady your breathing."
"Yes. Afterall as a Prince I am more comfortable knowing to whom I am addressing." He pulled out the proper English, held his head up a little bit, blood on his chin and tied to a chair didn't mean he could forget the manners he had struggled to teach his brothers.
Wedding planners and florists, the tailors and bakers, the caterers and so many people were going to be arriving this week and Dean was finally coming to terms with it all and now this?
The silence that filled the air between the two brothers was heavy like lead. Dean's scent was sour, his eyes closed, head hung low as he gripped the wood of the vanity a little tighter.
"Emma make sure you have your coat or your Mom is gonna kill me!" He hollered hurrying to the door beside his room where his 4 year old son was sitting on the carpet driving cars down the roads printed on the old rug
In silence, Castiel closed the door, slipping into the shadows of the room behind the door. Waiting. He had waited this long for Dean, another few minutes or hours or days, would amount to nothing compared to the years searching for his hunter.
"Most likely stress." Charlie chimed in, she began to make the Prince's Monstrous bed, the moment though that she picked up Castiel's coat there was a hand on her wrist and a growl.
And tonight she was sure she wanted to let him in on her exciting little secret. The most thrilling little thing she had been carrying under her heart for a few weeks now.
Gabriel and Sam had decided that while they were connected by Fate, now was not the time to make any decisions. Not until Sam was older. Whether or not they would become romantically involved they left unsaid and undetermined. Fate may have protected and helped Dean, Castiel, Michael and Lucifer. But if Gabriel and Sam decided to remain friends the rest of their lives, or become a pair, that was for them to decide down the road, not some magical draw.
"No actually I-I hate attention." He squeaked feeling all resolve fall away as his body protested otherwise. His scent filled the room with need and heat and if he wasn't trying to control himself before he was really fighting it now.
"Shut up!" Dean's voice broke out over the Queen's raging. Dean took a shaken step forward no longer hiding behind Michael
The Omega held no emotion but anger and hare in his eyes. His scent poisoned with burning rage and sorrow. He pulled the blade from her chest, holding it beside his head as he raosed it up again
"A myth you say? Like the little rumors about you dear boy? The rumors uttered to me about the strange Archangel with the golden wings, the prince that isn't what he seems?"
There was silence for several minutes before the door slowly opened a little to reveal Michael's tired eyes and sleepy frown. He looked worn and older with his face bruised and tired. Years of fighting etched in his frown, tiredness of fighting and war filled his icy eyes
As the hours dragged on Dean shifted again and bit the inside of his cheek, he was extremely uncomfortable, he hadn't been given one of the annoying heat inducing drugs in nearly three days and the heat was finally wearing off, didn't mean he wasn't still flushed from the tips of his ears to his shoulders, he was covered in a fine layer of sweat over his body, and he was under a constant state of arousal and because of that they really needed to settle for the night.
