“I snore?”
to be, so I’m content,” he said with a clear air of calm.
bad."
“Well, it’s clearly real,” Holmes says impatiently, “Now if you’d kindly leave so we can get on with it…” he trails off pointedly, but Lestrade doesn’t take the bait.
Sherlock smiles slightly at this, reassured, “Goodnight, John.”
There was no further touching during the meal, but John enjoyed talking to the other people near him, chatting amicably and with an ease that Sherlock found foreign. John was working class surrounded by toffs, but he managed somehow to blend in perfectly.
he still doesn’t know.
“Where did the DVDs come from?” Holmes asks.
“If you’d like.”
“You're perky this morning,” John replied, eating his food and looking over at his friend, “Worried about the reunion?”
want John to know the extent of how little he has done; he wants John to feel comfortable touching him and kissing him, and if John knows how he’s never really done any of those things…
“Pregnant,” Watson breathes in disbelief.
for an easy way to keep up with any new stories from me or just to chat; I'd love hear from you :)
“You were going to see
“John, no!” he shouts again, face screwed up in pain and worry.
“I’m sorry what?” John blinked, a bit of jealousy and disappointment coiling in his gut, “You…and
Sherlock recognizes it immediately and chuckles, “People do little else,” he completes with a smile.
“Not bad for an old man,” he joked, smiling as he kissed Sherlock’s neck again, “but you have to remember that I had some help; after all, you
“April 1st.”
Holmes waves a hand in disregard, “It was hardly necessary. I learned all I needed to solve it in the planetarium, not my primary school classroom.”
“And how do you figure?” Inspector Jones asked with offense.
But there are people like you who I don’t mind being near for extended periods of time. I recognize now that it’s more calming to have you around than to not, but it’s a fact I’ve realized too late.
“Sod this,” John mutters, removing himself from above Sherlock as gracefully as one can in his position, “I’m fucking freezing.”
“Oh, say yes!” An older woman to the side says giddily, but John still doesn’t speak, can’t even look away from Sherlock.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
Once they arrive at their destination, they decide to swing by the inn to drop off their bags before heading towards the pub. They know they want to eat a more legitimate meal (or, to be more precise:
Mycroft calls John, warning him that Sherlock took the cigarette and that he can’t go anywhere. John’s girlfriend is none too pleased about him always choosing Sherlock over her, she infers that John is really dating Sherlock without acknowledging it, points out how his best friend can’t even bother to tell his girlfriends apart, then storms out after John demonstrates that
John stood from the bed with one sassy eyebrow raised, “Why don’t you come do it for me?”
“Always is,” Holmes adds, then reaches to restart the “show”.
John looked down at their joined bodies futilely, trying to glimpse the evidence below, as though he couldn’t trust his own sense of touch on the matter. He swallowed thickly as he looked back up at Sherlock’s face to find it averted in shame.
“They
“Indeed,” Holmes whispers in return.
Sherlock throws the phone aside and prepares to jump.
and he can’t think of a reason to do it anymore because John is
John appears in the scene, pulling Sherlock out of his mind and back in to the flat with him by scolding him about letting his food go cold. Sherlock brushes off his concern – nicely – and immediately reenters his Mind Palace, though he appears to be chatting with each woman on a different laptop in the flat. He makes the connection that it must be the same man and that he’s using the obituaries to take on the identity of recently deceased men. He deduces that the so-called mayfly man was simply thinking of an ingenious way to play the field as a form of entertainment.
“I’m not,” he reassures him needlessly.
John drinks deep, feeling the heat of the alcohol warming him from the inside. This is a bad idea. They shouldn’t be drinking whilst the temperature gets lower, but he has started something now, something which has obviously caught Sherlock’s attention.
Holmes rolls his eyes, “No, you didn’t avoid me like John is doing, remember? We started working on cases again right away.”
“Oh…oh what was his name, dear?” Mr. Holmes asked, tapping his chin, “Graham…or Gareth…”
we handcuffed together instead of separately?”
“I haven’t decided yet. But I’m sure it will be amazing,” John grinned sexily, “Now sleep; you’ll need your strength.”
“I thought you’d stay to finish out the case,” John shrugs.
“Why does
John’s tongue wets his lips briefly before he replies, “God yes,” while nodding.
Sherlock shakes his head sadly, “No, but…”
“Everything,” Sherlock stated with emphasis.
The look on John’s face is a clear depiction of how stupid he deems Sherlock to be in this moment, sacrificing himself for her. It’s not her that he wants to be safe; it’s
“Why?” Sherlock asks at his normal volume, refusing to follow social guidelines of mimicking a whisper, “Maybe he
“This was one of my favorite bits of acting I’ve done,” Holmes recalls with a fond smile.
Back to the therapist office, she asks John to put voice to the things he didn’t get to say before. He can barely get the words
– when it came to her true nature. She shoots him, and things go a bit weird.
Pushing the thoughts away, John finished his packing and carried the bags downstairs, knocking on Sherlock’s door, “Sherlock? Are you packed? Do you need a hand?”
He opened the notebook to the first page and re-read his note. His scientific side had hated to waste the paper, but he felt it better than including a card that would most likely get lost or thrown away.
“I think I’ll get over the trauma,” John smiled, shaking his head fondly.
“There now,” John whispers, still too close to the other man’s face, eyes tracing his features and continuously landing on the bow of Sherlock’s lips in wanting, “that wasn’t so bad, was it?”
is happening? What is this experiment about, Sherlock?”
Holmes shakes his head, unable to believe what he’s hearing; the man before him is more than he could ever deserve after an entire lifetime of trying, “But…”
On the lift ride up to the office, John is furious with Sherlock for getting fake-engaged to gain access to an office, much like Watson had been with Holmes when he found out likewise. The fact that Sherlock Holmes can so flippantly exploit people’s feelings for him is one of the major reasons John Watson has tried so very hard to keep his romantic inclinations hidden.
Sherlock’s offended face makes John laugh without meaning to.
John wakes to knocking on the door. One of their neighbors’ sons with a drug habit has gone missing. John offers to go retrieve him and Mary insists on coming along – pregnant or not. They arrive at the crack den and John places a tire iron down his trousers.
,” he counters, pointedly looking at the result of Watson’s not shaving for the past few days.
Sherlock lets his face fall back into his usual mask of neutrality as he realises he let too much slip, and he ignores the question before topping up John’s glass, “Never have I ever gone fishing.”
An hour later, John was on his fourth glass of champagne. He didn't feel drunk, but he did feel the overwhelming urge to piss. Sidling up to Sherlock who was chatting with another man from his class, John tugged on his arm, “Where are the loos?”
“It isn’t the glasses?” Holmes asks, thrown. Their Magnussen clearly wasn’t using anything of the sort, just recalling information at will, but this version was slimier about it that he thought he may have used a different tactic.
“Well?” He asks with a coy smile.
“It’s what he likes,” Holmes echoes the earlier conversation.
With a quiet huff of air that might have tried to be a moan, John brings their lips back together desperately. Both sets of eyes close tight against the feeling of rightness and the hope that this one night is just the beginning of something wonderful, instead of the end of the possibility that it ever
John sighs heavily and kneels so that he can remove the other man’s shoes for him before rising and guiding him under the covers.
The kettle boils and Watson makes the tea without a word. He brings the cups to the cluttered table and sets them down, “Will you sit?” He asks Holmes politely, taking his own seat.
“It is to me!” John insisted, “When? Why? How?”
“Oh,” Sherlock shuts his mouth with a click.
“I don’t know, why would Sherlock?” He asks, gesturing towards the telly with his right hand.
Mycroft sighs before turning Holmes’ chair to face them and sitting down, “As far as we can tell, they’re from an alternate 2015.”
“Some sort of conspiracy?”
“They’re challenge coins,” John explains quietly, “they’re handed out upon merit. I got my Armed Forces one upon joining the squadron, as a unity tool. Once I earned my rank of Captain, the Medical Corps honored me with one of theirs.”
“I…I think he’s seizing the moment to patch things up with John,” he says slowly.
?” Sherlock sneers.
“Yes.”
The four were frozen in time until John spoke up again, clearing his throat first, “Well, this is hardly how I had planned it.”
not turn John on even more than he is already, considering how unsexy they are.
“I didn’t think we’d be first here,” John says loudly as they approach the table; they were only five minutes early.
Holmes tuts and waves a dismissive hand, “Well they are clearly inept at it; might as
“You stole my birth certificate?” Watson latches on to this fact, not being aware that Sherlock even knew his middle name.
“Straight in to the next one, then?” He asks, still a bit cold.
Holmes points to the DVDs and says, “You just might be.”
Sherlock frowned, narrowing his eyes and glaring at John in suspicion, “Mycroft?”
“John?” Sherlock asks quietly, sounding disoriented.
“On to the next,” he says, plopping back down.
“Of course you did, you git,” John assured him, cupping Sherlock’s jaw in his hand, “You were perfect.”
When Sherlock begins to sniff the smoke from Henry’s cigarette, Holmes tuts in annoyance.
as he began to lick and suck at the shaft.
,” Holmes says, looking completely unfazed at the prospect.
Sherlock looks confused yet intrigued, lifting his hand closer to his face. John is right, of course, because the older man knows every freckle on his body better than Sherlock does himself. John would never refer to it as a fetish, but he’s definitely got a
As they’re taking their coats off and settling back in to the apartment, John yawns and runs a hand roughly through his hair.
“He sounds nice,” John smiled warmly.
,” Watson stresses.
His smile had not faltered, however, “And yet you have linked us to each other in the most undeniable way, where it’s only natural to mention us both if one mentions us at all: Holmes and Watson.”
“I’d rather not,” Sherlock responded, looking straight forward as his eyes followed the progress of the car.
Sherlock comes to awareness - or the closest thing to it that he’s been for a while - and immediately calls for John who enters the room seconds later. They talk, John puts him back to bed, Sherlock dismisses him, and then his phone makes a moaning sound from his jacket pocket.
“Stop what?”
“How the
“It was in the 90's,” Sherlock said, his voice low and obviously upset, “AIDS and HIV.”
Sherlock distracts himself on his laptop until John falls asleep, and then can’t help as his attention is grabbed by the man. He’s not even
“Why did you stop talking?”
“What?” Sherlock asked, confused, but desperately wanting John to resume fucking him instead of dealing with all this talking.
Scene change to Sherlock talking to Anderson and a camera, detailing the Lazarus plan that resulted in his not dying after jumping off the roof of a building. Anderson isn’t quite convinced by the story, saying it could have been done better. While he’s working out the details that don’t quite add up, Sherlock sneaks out.
Both men turn in surprise, having been so caught up in the show that they didn’t hear his entrance.
Watson is nervous about watching it because he doesn’t want to relive the pain and see all the signs that he missed to prevent this from happening in the first place.
John felt a blaze of anger going through him as he looked at Sherlock looking broken and dejected, “I heard a little about it. Sherlock said it was bad...”
“I have been a wonderful influence on your sense of adventure,” Holmes congratulates himself with a smile.
“Oh, nothing like that. Don’t be so common, Watson; you’re better than that,” he says with an air of genuine disappointment.
“I’m…frightened to examine you too closely.”
“No.”
“So…you’re clearly under a spell or potion,” John starts slowly, logically, “Tell me what it is,” he orders, having put two-and-two together to realize that veritaserum is somehow involved.
“Have you already deduced what happened, or are you going to make me say it?”
“Okay, but we had been friends for a drastically shorter amount of time; to imagine that I wouldn’t have been aware that I was your best friend by a year ago is absurd.”
Watson, on the other hand, has his brow furrowed, a nagging feeling at the edge of his brain just out of reach. He’s missing something, and he has a feeling that it’s something of import.
Holmes smiles sadly and sits up fully. He grabs Watson’s blessedly clean-shaven face in his hands and kisses him tenderly.
Sherlock locked his ankles and pulled John deeper into himself, moaning wantonly at the feeling before panting, “You’re incredibly easy to read.”
“Gladly,” Holmes accepts eagerly, watching with distaste as Sherlock stumbles about a bit before falling to the floor to examine something, his arse raised in the air.
“You’re going to regret this,” John sing-songed, trying to muster up the energy to pull them both to the bathroom, because that was assuredly the only way he was getting this younger lump out of the bed.
Bill reaches out his hand with a wide smile and Sherlock takes hold. It’s a battle of strength, their tight grasps, and neither is certain who wins, “It’s a real honor to meet you; I follow along on John’s blog. Can’t believe all the adventures you two get up to!”
He groans deeply from his chest as his right hand – he can’t bear to move the left one now – grabs hold of Sherlock’s cock, stroking him off as his hips begin to pound upwards. Sherlock’s face freezes in shock at the sudden dual pleasure. He falls forward so that his hands are on either side of John’s face, lost beyond words and merely able to pant and moan.
Well, two out of three isn’t bad, statistically speaking.
“Since you shot the cabbie for me,” Sherlock admits.
“Actually,” John starts on a whisper before placing some distance between them once more. They’re still dancing, but now Sherlock is looking at him quizzically. He screws up every ounce of bravery he has ever possessed, “Would you mind?”
John withdraws from his lips slowly before moving his attention higher. He moves his left hand to Sherlock’s fringe, pushing it aside so that he can kiss the freckle between his hairline and right eye. Next is the more prominent one above his left eyebrow. John moves to Sherlock’s right ear where there’s a freckle near the top of his earlobe. Sherlock had no idea this one even existed before the first time John worshipped each mark. They don’t do this often, but Sherlock can admit - if only to himself - that he truly enjoys it. He loves the feeling of John relishing in locating and kissing each and every freckle, in the intimacy of his exploration. Before John, Sherlock never truly felt desirable.
After a few minutes, Sherlock appears to be happy to pass out – completely starkers – on the living room carpet where anyone could simply walk in and see him, and John moves up on to his right elbow to stare at him with his head supported by his hand.
Sherlock looks at John and bites his lip, “No,” he admits quietly, his shaking hands attempting to undo his pearl buttons only to slip off.
In lieu of an answer, Holmes merely looks from Watson’s eyes, pointedly down at his groin, then back up to hold his gaze challengingly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed, throwing himself down on the sofa.
“Sherlock…I…” John began to argue only to be cut off by Sherlock.
They alternate this way for a few minutes: Sherlock calling out to him and John whispering “shhh” or “it’s okay” or “I’m here” as his hand slowly, gently moves down Sherlock’s arm. When John’s hand reaches the other man’s and entwines their fingers, Sherlock finally wakes.
Sherlock places his hands in the air placatingly. John can see them shaking slightly, but he knows the other man is in control. John wills himself to remain calm and to
“Perfect,” John says, trying to fight off the feeling of nervousness that’s trying to take hold again. It’s just a meet up at a bar, for crying out loud! He can do this, it’s not even remotely close to being a big deal.
“Ah, St. Decorosus,” John moves on instead, “Patron Saint of Interior Design,” he points out while nodding his head sagely.
The honest, cutting words catch them both off guard for a moment. What John really wants is to hear Sherlock tell him that his own death was never the plan, but he knows it’s not something Sherlock can give him.
The younger man moves to the couch and sits down, eyeing the case with unease, “That’s preposterous.”
“John, please,” he begs, though he’s not entirely certain what he’s begging
“They will,” Holmes nods calmly.
Moriarty threatens to burn the heart out of Sherlock, negating Sherlock’s claim that he doesn’t have one.
“Why don’t you ever correct him?” Sherlock asks, consciously using the same terminology as John.
“Oh, fuck,” John moans, hips slamming harder against Sherlock as he hears the curse escape the lips of this overly refined, bespoke-suit-wearing, posh Adonis below him. He really can’t believe his luck.
"Don't tell me she has no firewood," John beseeches, true worry seeping in for the first time.
And that’s when John remembers the potion. That’s when he gently pushes Sherlock away and steps back. He had no idea his will power was so strong.
Holmes nods sagely, nodding to the telly, “Since day one, just like this portrays.”
Sherlock and John turn matching looks of surprise on each other, wondering if they’re somehow dreaming or…
“What the bloody hell was
difference?” Watson asks with exasperation.
“Sherlock?” John inhaled sharply, his heart rate skipping up twenty beats, “What are you doing?”
“Just proving a point,” the arrogant young man sneers.
. There’s a difference between being gay and being bi, ain’t there?”
“Where’d you get the drugs?” John asks softly, forcing himself to remain calm while inside his chest his heart is still a bit broken at the prospect of what the overdose truly means.
“Yes. Around noon. One. At some point.”
“Yeah, I remember.” Greg shrugged. “Just a little, though. You don’t need to put yourself through all this.”
“I did want to before, with another friend. But we never did. I never dared ask. He would have taken it the wrong way, most likely. Like you said, Englishmen aren’t into this form of intimacy without some other motive attached.”
John pushed himself to his feet and folded up his skin, placing it on the desk. Grabbing a change of clothes he had put there earlier, he stepped past Sherlock to the loo.
John narrowed his eyes.
Sherlock hesitated. John might feel slighted by his answer.
“So you’re allowed to apologize but I’m not? That’s a bit unfair, don’t you think?”
“I accompanied Victor to the airport to say good-bye. Mycroft tailed me, made sure to keep me in his sights so that I wouldn’t slip away afterwards. He took me to his house. Stayed with me the entire day and night. He knew that if he left me alone, I would run off to get a fix. I ended up staying there for a week. But he couldn’t remain with me all the time. He had to work. I promised not to leave. He wasn’t sure if he should trust me. I didn’t know if he should, either, or how much I meant to keep my promise. Well, I did for that week, distracting myself with books and puzzles and figuring out unsolved cases that Mycroft left with me to keep me busy. Highly illegal for him to do that, but he has never fussed overmuch over that. It did keep me entertained for a bit. Victor emailed. We were in contact, but he was so busy with the move that he only wrote to me twice in that week. I read them over so many times.”
“Except for the messy flat.”
“Yes, you are. All the time. You just can’t see it past your huge ego.”
They lied like this until John needed to get up to eat something before bed. Sherlock wanted to stay up longer, but John had been awake since 6 am, so he needed an early night. Sherlock chickened out of asking to sleep together again before John shifted into his seal form and stretched out on the sofa, too lazy to go upstairs.
Sherlock tilted the phone over to John, who waved at Mrs. Hudson with an eager smile.
“I know that. I’m not an idiot.”
“Really? Sand? I’m an ocean being, so you compare my hair to sand?”
“I very much doubt that.”
“Oh,” he said, frowning in confusion at Sherlock’s sudden revelation, doubtlessly feeling wrong-footed by it. “Okay. Thanks for telling me. I mean, I’m glad that you feel comfortable enough with me to tell me that. I’m bi, so I’m queer myself. But you already knew that much.”
Mycroft forced a smile. God, why had he done that? That was the most telltale sign that this was bothering him, along with his sudden inability to look Greg in the eye, not that it would be easy to do with Greg looking down at the floor with utter misery on his face.
Greg wagged his tail enthusiastically, already moving forward, paws brushing against Sherlock’s knees. Sherlock pressed his face to Greg’s, laughing as his fur tickled his neck, and hugged him for good measure. They had just made contact when John started coming down the stairs, flippers plodding on the steps. When Sherlock had first watched him do this at his house, worry had knotted in his stomach that John would miss a step and plummet onto his face, but John had completed the journey with the skill of one who has been navigating the human world for years. Sherlock had felt rather silly for worrying. Both Sherlock and Greg turned toward the doorway when John appeared. Sherlock smiled widely at him and John uttered a happy reply before turning his attention to Greg, tugging at Sherlock’s arms.
“Thank you. I was about to say the same about yours.”
“That’s fair. Even if the idea of me being any sort of giant is ridiculous.”
Sherlock wanted to push the issue, but he bit his tongue. Literally.
“No. Nothing happened. Nothing like that. People come on to me on occasion. Try to flirt. A couple of blokes at uni propositioned me. Made lewd remarks.”
Sherlock groaned.
“You’re tired of hoarding your secret in your lonely existence and were desperate to share it with someone, and you chose me because I was there. I was convenient. And wounded. You saved my life. I owe you my continued breath. That gives me a strong incentive to not betray you, as though I even would. I would be a laughing stock if I said anything of this. And you like my musical talent. Perhaps you even find me attractive.”
“There’s no need. It happened. There’s no taking it back now. The only thing I need… want, is knowledge. I need to know how this is possible. How you are possible. What is real and what isn’t. Will you tell me?”
John laughed.
“I’ve been taking my pills, doctor,” Sherlock said. “No need to fret.”
Mycroft sighed. So melodramatic.
Despite Mycroft’s words, he looked pleased by Sherlock’s thanks. Mycroft handed him his crutches.
“It’s part of it, yeah.”
“Yeah, see you.”
John pet Sherlock’s head. Sherlock burst out laughing. John groaned.
“I’ll see you soon,” he said before hanging up. John wouldn’t want to speak in more than one word answers with Mycroft looming in front of him like an overgrown bat out of some mediocre vampire film.
“We’re not discounting the choice you made,” Mycroft said. “Not at all. We know it was difficult for you.”
“How about the smoking?”
Sherlock stepped into her outstretched arms, sinking happily into her affectionate hug, a smile growing on his face.
“I wanted coffee today.”
“You’ll do fine. Your voice is all I need.” Sherlock hated how shy he suddenly felt. “It comforts me.”
A wry smile jerked on Mycroft’s mouth. He was dancing his umbrella to and fro with the tip pressed on the floor, bouncing the handle on his fingers.
“Don’t keep it to yourself in the future, alright?”
When the sun began to dim in the horizon, John shifted to human form and got dressed. They returned to his house, where John began to cook dinner. Sherlock sat on the sofa at first, trying to continue his book, but the words kept slipping past his sight as his thoughts returned to the act of touching John so freely and how John interpreted that. Sherlock had only touched him that way when John was in seal form, so John couldn’t think that Sherlock was coming on to him, surely. Yet the doubt nagged at him.
Greg’s face dropped slightly in chagrin and he crossed his arms, glancing down.
“You changed in Sherlock’s flat?”
Sherlock pursed his lips. Good point. Hobbling on his remaining good ankle might have been precarious on such unsteady ground. He had not thought of that before.
“Oh, please. Isn’t complaining about your ex something else friends do? I saw that on telly somewhere. As your friend, I insist that you tell me everything you don’t like about my brother. Spare no detail.”
“It’s alright,” he said soothingly. “You’re safe. It’s only John. The seal is John. It’s not impossible. I felt the same shock you’re experiencing right now, but this is real. John is the seal that saved me.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“You have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Hudson. I’m following my doctor’s advice to the letter.”
They spent the rest of the drive in silence, arriving at the house a few minutes later. After Mycroft stepped out, John gripped the door handle and sucked in a long, slow breath, staring at the front seat. Sherlock did something he had never done since Victor. He placed his hand on John’s shoulder and squeezed gently.
“You know,” John said later when they were halfway through dinner. “You can stay at my place if you want. You don’t have to keep paying the hotel.”
Tilting his head a fraction, Mycroft turned to leave. No aspect of his posture, his facial expression, or his tone denoted any dissembling or falsehood. He was actually choosing to live with the uncertainty of not knowing something and trusting Sherlock’s word because Sherlock had asked him to.
“You’ll be fine. You’re a doctor. Isn’t that what all mums want their children to bring home?”
A thrill of anticipation rushed through Sherlock.
“The hell with calming down. He demands to know everything about my life but hides his own from me? Fuck that.”
“Can we just move on please?” he asked, fully aware that he was whining, but what did he care? “I hate this.” He waved his hands in the air between them. “This feel in the room. I didn’t plan for this and I don’t like it.”
“You two are hopeless, aren’t you?” he said with a long-suffering sigh, yet there was a gleam of amusement in her eyes.
With one last squeeze of their shoulders, Sherlock grabbed his suitcase and climbed aboard the train. He couldn’t resist finding a window seat that faced the platform, even if only to watch John walk away back to the car park. He kept his eyes on the shrinking figure until John turned a corner around the ticket office and out of sight. With a sigh, Sherlock leaned back in his seat and pulled out his phone, texting Lestrade.
“Can I visit you tomorrow or not?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock sat up, narrowing his eyes at him.
“Nah, that’s okay. Complain all you want. You can distract me, too.”
“Why is he always so damn stubborn? He’d have fewer grey hairs on his head if he let me do things how I want, when I want. I always figure things out, but no. We have to do things by the book until his so-called detectives have bungled the investigation so badly that I have to waste precious time untangling their mess.”
“I’ve never told anyone that,” Sherlock said, voice barely above a whisper.
“What kind of sea creatures?”
His tone was gentle and soothing, as if Sherlock were a frightened animal who needed calming down.
“Fine, then,” Sherlock said. “Let’s keep talking about John.”
“We should change into something more comfortable,” Sherlock said, glancing at their dress shirts and slacks. “Unless… You aren’t used to cuddling with clothes on, are you?”
“I’m sorry about that,” Sherlock said after a time, glancing up at Mycroft. A thin smile glimmered on Mycroft’s lips.
“I’m not the greatest doctor in the world, Sherlock. I do my bit as well as I can, but I’m pretty average when you get down to it.”
“Yeah. It was just a thought. You know how our minds jump from one thing to another.”
A few, silent moments passed, then his phone chimed with a text. He grabbed it from his pocket. Lestrade was messaging him.
John laughed.
“You’re not alone on this birthday,” Sherlock said. “We can go out to eat. Or go out of town for a bit. Get in the car and go all the way to Scotland if you want. Or France.”
“Detective!” he called out moments before Greg appeared at the door. “I have your man.”
“I’m afraid not. I’m sorry. But I promise you, he won’t hurt you. I won’t let him.”
“Good morning, Sherlock,” she said. “What brought this on? You never call me like this.”
Sherlock smirked.
There was silence on the line for a second.
Sherlock scrutinized Greg. Everything about him looked normal. No expensive items of clothing. No signs of Mycroft’s affection. Nothing indicated any kind of connection to Mycroft at all. Had there been any and Sherlock had just ignored them? Christ, he should have paid closer attention. He was never as observant as he hoped to be. Mycroft was. Mycroft always was. He must have schooled Greg in how to lie to him about this.
“No more than the usual ache,” Sherlock said, cursing how shaky he sounded. “It’s nothing. I’m fine. I was just thinking.”
Sherlock smiled again.
“Not at all.”
The details poured out of him in a gushing torrent of frustration and confusion. Crowing in glee when Greg finally caved and gave him the case. Examining the body at Lauriston Gardens with John. The thrill of sharing a case with him. Their easy comradery in this, like in all things. Chasing the cab across Soho. Laughing with him. The joy of adrenaline surging through his body. Yelling at Greg for breaking into his flat under the pretext of a drug bust, of all condescending things. Figuring out that the cabbie was guilty. Following him downstairs. Confronting him on the street. Considering going with him, just for a second. Well, no more than a minute. It couldn’t have been more than a minute.
“And you want me to make a good impression, is that it? I’m not going to clean up in here and make it look like a magazine spread. That would be as bad as putting on an act.”
“I can lie still for days. Mrs. Hudson complains about it. And no one is ever thinking about nothing. The brain is always at work. But no. My mind is always awake. Always working. I can no more relax it than a cat can decide to go vegetarian. I only ever found one way of doing so, but I had to give that up.”
“You don’t know that. Perhaps I’ll take up the habit.”
“So, uh…” he said. “You are into sex, then?”
“You better not. Are we done now? Are you going to stop worrying for five minutes? Oh, and you better not threaten John with some hackneyed speech about if he hurts me you’ll make him suffer.”
“It’s superficial,” John said, a note of relief in his voice. “You’ll be fine. Let me take a look at your ankle.”
“That’s alright. I can endure some loud films. I’ll abstain from commenting on their quality, as well.”
“I’m happy to see you, too,” John said, a laugh on his voice as he held Sherlock just as closely.
“You’re fine, mate.”
“I’m not scared,” Mycroft said, scowling.
Mrs. Hudson sat on the armchair facing the window.
Better. Sherlock sent that one. He tapped his knee, narrowing his eyes as the little notification
“Yes, that’s most certainly not a flaw to me. I can’t bear any of that. I’m glad I’m not going to have to fend it off from you.”
“Thanks. Bye now.”
“It was the cliffs I was originally interested in, but the beach is rather invigorating, as well.”
“As much as I would love to continue hugging you, I’m starved.” John leaned back, smirking mischievously. “And the sooner we eat, the sooner we can go up to bed.”
Oh. Right. Sherlock didn’t live here. He lived over two hours away in a different city, too far too see each other daily. The only kind of relationship they could have after Sherlock left was a long distance one.
Mrs. Hudson gasped and John gaped at him, beseeching Sherlock with distressed eyes to deny it.
John’s disappointed voice made Sherlock flinch. John sighed, dropping his head into his hand.
His cheeky expression would usually have annoyed Mycroft, but not this time. It made Greg’s face even more handsome, a feature that Mycroft had been allured by from the moment that he looked at Greg’s file. Fine bone structure, a strong chin (a particular weakness of Mycroft’s), soft, brown eyes, an easy, radiant smile, brown hair slowly going grey, giving him a delicious salt and pepper look. A thorough search into his background revealed a couple of male dalliances, so he wouldn’t necessarily be adverse to Mycroft’s advances. That is, unless he didn’t go for the “arrogant” type. Although, once Greg’s irritation at being ambushed on the street and dragged here had died down, Mycroft had detected signs of appreciation for his own looks.
Sherlock grinned.
Then the impossible happened. The seal morphed, skin wrinkling and expanding, falling to the side as it exposed a man underneath.
“I’m not sure if that’s a good idea considering how well you two get along, but thanks for the offer. Listen, Sherlock, I didn’t mean to make you feel left out. I just didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, that’s all.”
Yet despite his gratitude, his enthusiastic enjoyment of Greg’s company, and the growing affection that he felt toward him, he couldn’t bring himself to cave to Greg’s silent desire and agree to a committed relationship. They had never wanted the same thing. They both knew this. Greg desired marriage and children. Mycroft did not. Greg wanted cheesy romantic gifts. Mycroft vehemently did not. While they were very compatible in the ways that Mycroft considered to be most important, they were sadly lacking in many areas that Greg considered to be of equal importance, and Mycroft wouldn’t doom him to future misery by demanding commitment when Mycroft couldn’t offer him all that he desired in a long term partner. Mycroft wasn’t even sure if he wanted a long-term partner himself. He had never even considered it before meeting Greg. So, regretfully, he made it clear that Greg should feel no compunction about terminating their relationship if he found someone more suitable. Greg resented the idea that their relationship could end at any moment, and assured Mycroft that he was happy, so Mycroft let it go. Yet it was Greg who let go first.
“Weren’t you? Why did you follow him down the stairs, then?”
“I have promised to do so, and I will. Sherlock is free to do as he wishes, with whoever he wishes, without my knowledge.”
, Sherlock replied.
“Is there something else?” Sherlock asked.
“Human eyes?” he asked, voice strangled in shock.
Sherlock stopped halfway to the door and turned back to Lestrade, who frowned at him, file held open in his hands, his expression the usual exasperation at Sherlock’s manner.
`````````````````````
“You tried to talk him out telling me,” he said.
He sounded like he really did hope. Mycroft didn’t make a habit of looking uncertain in front of people. So Sherlock wouldn’t need to stuff him with wine to get him to take his guard down. Good. That would have been irritating.
“What happened?”
“What am I doing, exactly?”
“That’s a long story,” Mycroft said. “I’m afraid I’m too tired at the moment to go into it.”
“No problem. You were just protecting your brother. I get it. You have nothing to worry about, I promise you. On that note, though, you are going to back off like you said, right? You have been a bit overbearing.”
“Can you just hold me, please?” Greg stammered, voice pained and short. “Like old times.”
“A friend? Oh, how wonderful. I’ve never seen you have a friend other than Inspector Lestrade. But you don’t even call him by his first name.”
“The skull isn’t going to comment, either.”
While seeing John in the nude didn’t bother Sherlock, the thought of being pressed against him like that did give him a jolt of fear and nerves. John wouldn’t try anything. He hardly needed to be naked to do so. But Sherlock didn’t want to be naked himself. No, he didn’t. But he wouldn’t be adverse to skin contact. Quite the opposite. He would love some.
God, he needed a cigarette. He’d been yearning for one since he got on the train, but John was so proud of him for quitting, so he couldn’t indulge now. Although John wasn’t here. He wouldn’t know if he just had one. Getting up, he sat on the sofa and dug under it for his Persian slippers.
“Well, not to his face. No, I think I actually like him though, even if he is totally full of himself. But, well…”
“You can always count on my brother to be stubborn.”
“That’s wonderful,” John said. “Kelpies aren’t always friendly to those who stray into their lakes, but they don’t hurt kids. So, this makes things a lot easier. We don’t have to explain anything to you.”
“We have a few days left before you leave,” John said. “We’ll just make the best of it. Besides, I’ll be visiting you in London five days after that, anyway. I haven’t been in ages. You’ll have to show me your favorite spots.”
“Yes. I was wrong. Thank you so much for that reminder. Never mind that I already acknowledge the insane fact that you exist by ringing you and getting in your car. I’m sorry I can’t be right all the time. But I most certainly can tell an airline pilot by his thumb, just like I can tell that you hike frequently, you have no musical talent, but wish that you did, and you’re frequently on holiday.”
“Alright. I will refrain from pointing out an arbitrary fact about your stature relative to that of my people.”
Greg groaned and rubbed his eyes.
Sherlock smiled back.
“Thanks,” he murmured after a while, breath hot and broken on Mycroft’s skin before he pulled away, rubbing the tears off his face.
“You’re late.”
“I won’t, don’t worry. Out of curiosity, though, is there a particular reason why you don’t like that term?”
Sherlock grinned. Now that John no longer feared Mycroft, he was free to be as blunt and confrontational as he wanted. The sight of him facing off against Mycroft, stance firm, steely gaze daring Mycroft to protest the insult, filled Sherlock with glee and an appreciation that sang in his bones.
John nodded again.
“I don’t want to kick you out of your bed.”
“I don’t care,” Sherlock said loudly enough for everyone to hear.
“You’re doing pretty well, actually,” John said, standing up, the skin wrapped around his shoulders. “I was expecting worse.”
“Quite. In any case, there was a period of two months when we hardly had the chance to see each other. He called me one day telling me that he had met Susan, who was also romantically inclined and wanted children, so he wanted to try to date her. I said of course. I wouldn’t stand in his way. He wanted to remain friends. We didn't speak much after that, though, not for a while. It took some time for our reconstituted friendship to knit together. But we became close again. I missed our former connection, but I wished him all the happiness in the world.
“Likewise.”
“I just want to catch up.” Sherlock smiled. It didn’t look forced, did it? It felt a little forced. “You’re right. That’s what friends do. We haven’t seen each other in a while. So we should, you know.”
“No.”
“Can you tolerate cold better because you’re a selkie?” Sherlock asked.
Yet as John continued to wrap the bandage around his foot, Sherlock’s preoccupation with biological differences faded, his focus narrowing exclusively on how those hands felt and not what their temperature might signify. John, as always, was treating him with careful care, making sure that the pressure on his flesh was firm, but not too tight or painful. His hold shifted from his sole to his heel and to his lower leg as necessary, his touch gentle. Always so gentle. Sherlock wasn’t much accustomed to being touched other than by Mrs. Hudson and the occasional pat on the shoulder from Lestrade. Yet he enjoyed it immensely despite not having much chance to receive it. Flustered awe from being touched by a non-human gripped him now. The sensation of John’s thigh pressing against his heel and his hands gently tending to him made his breath grow short and his eyes narrow at John’s downturned head. He struggled to keep his toes still and not wiggle them in restless confusion at how much he yearned to lean into John’s touch and gaze at his face until he’d gotten his fill of every freckle, every laugh line, every sand-colored eyelash. Handsome in a puppy dog way, Sherlock had called him. An accurate assessment, but his regard was no longer so flatly objective.
“Oh, no. Don’t you dare call right now if that’s what you’re doing. I’m not dressed for that.”
“I haven’t deleted anything you’ve done,” he continued, forcing his tongue to move as he looked firmly out the window. “Including the not bad things.”
“You might be right,” Greg said. Mycroft deflated in disappointment. “Okay. Look, I’ll call again, soon, okay? And let me know if you need anything. Don’t just do your stoic, stiff upper lip thing. Even for an Englishman, you take it too far.”
“I know.”
“Don’t tell him that,” he said. “People get dumped for less.”
The word was a sad murmur, but Sherlock would not be guilted. He needed to get away from this man and forget everything that had happened as soon as possible, if he even could. But he must try. For the sake of sanity, he must.
Lestrade frowned, confused by Sherlock’s apparent subject change, but his brow soon smoothed out and he looked gratified by Sherlock’s invitation.
“I’m aware that you’re not a dog, but do I understand correctly that I’m allowed to pet you to the same extent as if you were one? I don’t want to overstep.”
It quickened Sherlock’s heart and stuttered his breath, and a flare of anxious uncertainty awakened inside him, for he recognized that desire in John’s eyes that he couldn’t experience himself. He sucked in a breath, telling his stupid mind to relax. John had promised him. This didn’t mean
“I don’t see how she could,” John said. “She’s human as far as I can tell. We haven’t done or said anything suspicious around her, and most humans don’t automatically think ‘selkie’ when they find animal hair on the floor. She probably thinks it’s something else.”
“How do you put up with me, Mrs. Hudson?” he asked, loosening his legs enough to grip the cup in his hands without spilling.
“No, no, don’t apologize. Don’t you dare apologize for that. This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. I’m honored. Really. I…”
Mycroft shifted in his seat.
“Would that be acceptable to you?” Sherlock asked. “You don’t have to say yes.”
“I wasn’t.” Sherlock turned to him, beseeching, begging. “I wasn’t going to go.”
“Sherlock?” John asked, frowning at him and placing a hand on his arm. “Are you okay?”
“Is something the matter?”
“I think it’s plenty intelligent. Maybe not your kind of intelligent.”
They were both jittery as they made their way upstairs. John lingered by his side on the staircase, shoulder brushing against Sherlock’s, not holding his arm since they’d ceased doing that a few days ago, but there in case Sherlock needed him. They both knew that was an excuse, but they played along just for the contact. Their hands strayed close together. Sherlock was seized by the urge to take it, but it might be too soon for that. They hadn’t mentioned handholding yet. Best wait until they did.
Sherlock puffed up with affronted pride. Mycroft braced himself for an explosion of anger and victimization, but Sherlock only pouted, narrowing his eyes in displeasure, and sank back into the kitchen, muttering. Mycroft stared at the space that he used to occupy in shock.
Mycroft huffed in quiet amusement.
“I’m okay. I’m used to it. My mood will pass. It helps a lot having you here to take my mind off things.”
Sherlock lunged for the skin. John tried to intercept him, but Sherlock already had his hands on it, on the smooth, blubbery truth of it. It felt, looked, and smelled exactly like it should. There was no mistaking this for some fabrication. An old scar, three tooth marks, marred a piece of it. An identical scar pockmarked John’s right shoulder. Sherlock reached for him, touching the scars, testing his warm, breathing skin. Two warm skins. Two skins belonging to the same person. The same creature.
Mycroft turned to him and smiled gently. The sadness in that smile made Sherlock squirm.
“I just like the feeling. Don’t read things into it.”
John slid off him and lied on his side, back to Sherlock, who pressed himself behind him and draped his right arm over his torso. John grabbed it, wrapping it more securely. He did the same with Sherlock’s right leg. Sherlock quietly let John arrange him however he pleased until they were lying still, John’s head tucked under his chin, limbs encasing him in a secure cocoon, John’s fingers twined in his.
“Ugh,” Sherlock muttered. “Don’t answer that.?
“So you are a selkie!” Sherlock crowed in triumph.
“You’re trying to cheer me up,” he said.
“I only know of a few,” John said, pulling over a chair to sit before them. Mycroft watched his progress, but didn’t draw back this time. “But they’re not all in the UK. I’m a bit of an unusual case in having lived on land for such a stretch. Yes, we say selkie.”
His despairing tone belied his words. Mycroft wrapped up his business in two hours and twenty-two minutes and headed home, instructing his driver to go as quickly as he considered safe. Mycroft found Greg in the small, unofficial dining room next to the kitchen where they used to eat when Greg was a regular fixture in his house, staring balefully at a half-eaten plate of mashed potatoes, mushy peas, and steak. He jerked at the sound of Mycroft’s footsteps and looked up. His desperate relief at seeing Mycroft awakened every ounce of the affection that Mycroft had sought to bury deep inside. He yearned to hold Greg close and cherish him like he deserved, assuring him that no one would ever hurt him again.
John kept his eyes trained on Sherlock’s face as he lowered his hand to cup Sherlock’s overly hard, wet, and throbbing cock. The cotton of Sherlock’s pajama trousers did nothing to hide the moist flesh and Sherlock buckled, grabbing onto John’s arms with a deep huff, “John…John, I...if you...I might...”
“Now he says it, so do I,” David says before quickly following him, looking like it’s quite urgent.
He kneels on the floor behind his lover and begins to lavish his hole with kisses and teasing licks without any warning. Sherlock moans loudly and pushes backward reflexively. After teasing, John moves to the left a little ways to reach the lube they have hidden between the sofa cushion and the furthest armrest.
The piece ends and I give another, impromptu, speech. Whatever compelled me to do it, I’m not certain; maybe I simply wanted to have your eyes on me again. Who knows? But then I experience one more deduction than I had been anticipating.
He had stopped denying his feelings, to himself and to others. John was madly, utterly, and devastatingly infatuated with Sherlock; from his hair to his weirdly chimp-like toes.
Now, packing everything away, John wondered how he would look standing next to Sherlock, both in their suits and dressed to the nines. He hoped that he wouldn’t let Sherlock down or make him a target for more bullies. The thought of Sherlock being bullied made John’s insides clench and a flare of anger burn up his spine. Sherlock didn’t deserve to be bullied - though he did occasionally deserve a slap - but the thought of anyone physically touching Sherlock made John want to vomit.
“He certainly appears to have spent a great deal of time on it.”
“Of course,” Holmes agrees, sounding serious, but the quirk of his lips gives him away.
Sherlock and John are back in 221B with John reading the paper. Sherlock bemoans his “boffin” moniker, and John becomes frustrated with his own: “bachelor”. John tells him that he needs to work on staying out of the news by taking smaller cases so that the press doesn’t turn on him. For a man who has spoken the words
“Sherlock?” John looks confused, hearing the traces of
Sherlock and John arrive at Henry’s house, taken back by the size of it. They sit down for tea and Henry tells them about seeing the words “Liberty” and “In” within his mind. John assures Henry that Sherlock has a plan, which the detective reveals as taking Henry back out to the moor as bait to see if anything attacks him. Both John and Henry are appalled.
Just as John’s eyes begin to close in submission to his will to go back to sleep, Sherlock speaks up quietly.
for an easy way to keep up with any new stories from me or just to chat; I'd love hear from you :)
“Sherlock,” John calls to him quietly, but he doesn’t hear it as he continues his search, “Sherlock, stop!” he calls louder, and Sherlock does, “I don’t need an ambulance, just a cab to A&E.”
Watson flounders for a moment, trying to comprehend the sentiment in the statement, “Did you go back to using after I got married?”
Lestrade practices calming breathing for a few moments so that he doesn’t strangle the git, “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I really don’t have anything requiring your assistance.”
Sherlock thought about touching the other man’s cock; wrapping his hand around it and distinguishing what movements he liked best. Could his movements, for example, wring the same moans from John as the other man is able to draw from himself?
“But ours dead, isn’t he?” Watson asks with trepidation.
“Harry.”
They sway in time to the music for two, three, five songs, the crowd slowly pushing them closer together. It’s not indecent dancing as it may have been at a dance club, but it’s close and they touch hands to limbs for support and their eyes linger as their smiles mirror the other.
Watson reaches to the coffee table for the remote and pauses the DVD - as fate would have it - on Mrs. Hudson’s face. She stops where she’s standing, transfixed by the telly.
John sputters for a moment in confusion, “We’re continuing?”
John finds Sherlock at St. Bart’s simply sitting in a lab. They discuss where the key code may be hidden in 221B and Sherlock remembers the fingers of Moriarty’s hand tapping out a code on his knee. He texts Moriarty to meet him at St. Bart’s while John is turned away.
Holmes softens immediately, “I don’t know why Sherlock can’t seem to grasp what it is that John needs; maybe it’s Mary being in the picture and he’s not certain where he fits in himself now. I don’t know. But I assure you that it’s as insufferable for me to watch as it is for you.”
Sherlock shudders at the warmth flooding from beneath John’s clothing. Despite the coldness in the room, John is like a furnace and Sherlock lets his thumbs dip under the wool monstrosity which is John’s Marks and Spencer jumper as he strokes along John’s stomach, circling around the navel sensually.
“He went back to using?” Watson fumes.
“And why
John Watson was maybe the first person to ever think so highly of Sherlock Holmes consistently; who never defaulted to thinking he was an uncaring arse who meant to hurt people. John Watson, in many ways, had saved Sherlock Holmes. Now it was his turn to do the same, and for the first time in his life, he put someone else before himself, without hesitation.
“Just now, you disappeared in to your mind. Where did you go?” Holmes expands kindly.
He lifts it, reads it. Holmes smiles before going to deliver the news to Watson in the bath, the post-it floating to another portion of the table without his awareness.
John discovers Sherlock and Magnussen tells him that he was shot. John calls emergency.
“I...may have had hopes,” the alcohol makes him admit with a blush, “but he certainly hasn’t dated any men since I’ve known him, only women.”
They’re sitting in a very old, small stone church with wooden pews and stained glass windows. They aren’t church people - what with Sherlock being too scientifically minded and John having fought in a war - but weddings are the exception. Or so John tells Sherlock.
“A mix of amortentia and veritaserum.”
“Might feel it but it’s actually the opposite,” John explains, looking above his tablet, “You should know that as a chemist.”
Bill is, of course, getting married to his long-term girlfriend, Bridget. David is already married to a woman he was with before he deployed; they have two kids and sound happy. Alan and John are both divorced (John even made it through his portion without having to get all dramatic and lay out all of the crazy details), and Zach has never been able to tie anyone down - male or female, he specifies to no one's surprise.
“So yeah…no er...bum stuff tonight,” John said as he cleared his throat and then handed Sherlock the small tube of lubricant, “Add some of that. It’ll feel nicer.”
The ride was silent and awkward. The tension in the air stifling as Sherlock worried that John would leave now that he knew the truth, and John fumed over the fact that Sherlock wasn’t getting it. He knows Sherlock thinks this will ruin things - that it isn’t real - but he won’t allow John to even speak to prove him wrong.
Sherlock has never seen anything so dashingly attractive before in his entire life.
Watson can’t bring himself to respond, because all he can think to ask is: “They love each other, don’t they?” because how
“The things I do for you,” John grumbled, smearing some of the gel onto his hand and warming it before reaching down to take Sherlock’s cock in his hand.
well. It started as a child, my empathy, but no one in my family helped me refine or control it, so it ends up suffocating me if I don’t distance myself from others. Being able to easily feel what others feel helps my disguises and undercover work come across as genuine, but prolonged openness to my empathy can leave my brain confused and I get angry so that I have a reason to be alone to find myself again.
“And do what?”
“But you
John laughs bitterly, “Because he hasn’t seen me pursue any,” he turns off the water and turns to David, hip resting on the porcelain as his hands drip with water, “Since the day I met him, there has been no other man I was able to honestly consider.”
“Well, John isn’t wearing a wedding ring like you were when we were there. Much easier to assume we’re merely friends when one of us is wearing a ring but the other isn’t.”
“Yes, you,” she mock-glared, “letting him sleep until all hours of the day!”
For me, you sat on a train for 9 hours instead of forcing me back on a mode of transportation that causes me anxiety and pretended to enjoy it.
They watch in silence as the Secret Service come to retrieve Sherlock and a helicopter collects John. Both are taken to Buckingham Palace where John finds Sherlock – still clad in only a sheet – sitting on a couch.
Sherlock did as he was told and hissed at the cold gel before rubbing it in and relaxing into John’s embrace, “This is rather comfortable,” Sherlock hummed, nuzzling into John’s neck and rubbing his curls against John’s chin.
“Fuck!” Sherlock moans as his back arches off the floor, inadvertently separating their foreheads as he brings the rest of their bodies closer together.
Then added hastily to the bottom of the page was what appeared to be a last minute addition:
“Sherlock, what the hell is this?” John yells to his flatmate in the bathroom.
Sherlock and John run, hand in hand, from the scene. Pausing for breaths, jumping fences, and finally, nearly getting hit by a bus so that one of the assassins saves them and answers Sherlock’s initial question of why they keep trying to save his life. The computer key code is somewhere in 221B. The assassin is shot and they run to another alley, John grabbing Sherlock’s sleeve once they’ve stopped. They see a newspaper and are reminded of the tell-all story Kitty is about to run.
) to find an unmarked envelope on the front step. He opens it to find bread crumbs.
Sherlock kissed him again before asking, “How?”
Over the next unknown amount of time – the enigma that is the world of sleep vs waking existing somehow outside of the common laws of time – John continuously finds himself being woken by either Sherlock’s hand somewhere annoying, or being kicked by the boniest feet in the world. It’s not quite as intrusive as his snoring was (which is somehow magically not an issue tonight), but he’s still unable to get the restful night’s sleep that he craves.
“Are you going to pout like Sherlock now?”
"Power's out," John informs Sherlock when he goes back downstairs in his dry clothes. He's still cold, but it's a start.
You are right beside me at your wedding, and if I close my eyes I can imagine that this is ours and is real, but as I glance down at you I can’t help but see that woman in the white dress, breaking the illusion.
Watson shrugs with a smile of his own, “It was the last insult in a long line. He just took the brunt of my frustration with everyone.”
is that supposed to mean?”
Sherlock messages Moriarty the answer and then the phone rings. Sherlock desperately tries to stop her from saying anything about the voice, doesn’t actually want any harm to come to this stranger, but she doesn’t listen. The line goes dead.
“It appears to be a TV show about us and our cases,” Watson answers, still incredibly confused.
“But how am I supposed to have accurate records for the experiments if we’re both asleep during it?”
“You’ve been misinformed,” John smiled, stroking a hand through Sherlock’s curls before stretching up to kiss him again, “and wanting it properly doesn’t make you a needy princess. I want to show you, I want to -- I want it to be good for you. To be special.”
Watson shrugs one shoulder, “Was kind of hard not to notice when one came in, and it seemed like an awful lot. My brain got curious to how many it exactly was.”
Hope you enjoy! Just a short one today, then we're starting on the smutty build up
“Is Sherlock jealous of Sholto?” Watson asks.
Sherlock finishes setting up the camera - and really, where he got his hands on a camcorder is not worth thinking on - and then turns the lights off before settling on his side of the bed, back against the headboard and laptop in his lap.
Sherlock performs a suffering sigh, “Last I saw them, they were on the coffee table.”
Sherlock’s brow furrows, because
Bill, for all his complaining, pushes himself from the table good-naturedly and calls to Zach, “Come, Zacharias, we have beverages to procure.”
“‘m fine,” he mutters unclearly, letting his head droop to the right as though he’s going to fall asleep with his shoulder for a pillow.
Sherlock simply looks at him sadly, taking in his face and squeezes his fingers to reassure himself, but he ends up shaking his head no.
“Sherlock, you are
John saved him from himself by turning onto his side to face him, soft eyes meeting the almost frantic ones of his genius, “Shhh,” he soothed, bringing his right hand up to card in his curls, “there’s no rush and there’s certainly no pressure.”
“Now, Cap, that’s not very fair,” Bill chides, “hardly our fault that civilian food is more edible than army grub.”
plates are about. Neither Sherlock nor I prefer to have a plate of our own food; it’s too much.”
“And that happened...because of me?” John asks, and if Sherlock isn’t mistaken, it seems like John’s voice has gotten deeper and more aroused. Blotches of colour snake up John’s chest and neck and he clears his throat, “Because of what I did?”
Holmes sighs heavily, “You
The rest of the men shout in appreciation of the barb and Sherlock finally feels as though he’s not a complete outcast with the group.
“Yes you can. Show me, Sherlock. Show me,” John moaned into Sherlock’s skin, his tongue accidentally licking at Sherlock’s neck as he attempted to lick his own lips.
I didn't see this happening. I really didn't. But, here you are: five chapters of different sleep "ailments" and how they affect our boys.
“What on earth have you been doing?” John asked, looking up from the newspaper he had been engrossed in.
“Right...” John trailed off, watching as Sherlock coughed and then immediately went back to work with a massive torrent of deductions which made the police force dizzy.
Watson can’t think of anything to say to that, but the feelings of pride and adoration swell within him.
With the last remaining minutes, John surreptitiously eyes Sherlock’s bag, trying to judge by its size whether he forgot to pack anything. He rolls his eyes at the garment bag next to the luggage; posh as ever, this man. Not trusting him completely, John decides to check the bathroom to make sure that all of the other man’s toiletries are missing (they are). When he returns to the living room, Sherlock is standing, moving towards his coat.
I grab my coat and scarf, not even pausing in my strides towards the door to complete putting them on before exiting the suffocating building.
“He’s fine,” Holmes breathes out, relaxing again in to the couch as though exhausted.
John is at work with Mary. She appears to be his receptionist, which is different than Watson’s Mary who was a dental receptionist.
“I have scotch,” Sherlock says without warning, “that’ll keep us warm.”
Now that shock is taken care of, Molly tells him that he needs to control the bleeding. He doesn’t know how to go about doing that from inside his Mind Palace; it’s not like he can cauterize an actual wound from in there. Instead, he finds Moriarty chained in a padded cell. He scares Sherlock, who falls to the floor and begins to give up. Moriarty talks about how all negative emotions are good. Just feel them.
“You…” Sherlock started, then cleared his throat before continuing, “you mean…”
“No. He kicked me out,” Sherlock sulked, looking and rubbing at the rather impressive bulge in his pants, “He was reluctant to help.”
After what feels like an eternity, Watson nods and takes a sip of his tea, “Now, back to business, then?” He asks before beginning to stand from the table, Holmes following suit.
Kitty Riley is claiming at first to be a fan who would like to bed Sherlock, but he quickly deduces that she’s a journalist coming up quickly on a deadline and she rapidly drops all pretenses. Sherlock denies her an interview before she even asks and heads for the door, but she follows.
John walked in from his shift at the surgery, pushing open the door to Baker Street and almost standing on a small pile of letters and bills which still waited on the welcome mat. Rolling his eyes at Sherlock's laziness, John picked them up and continued up the stairs to their flat, taking off his coat and toeing off his shoes as he looked over at Sherlock who was sitting silently in his chair.
The first emotion that registers with Sherlock is a deep, aching sadness. The fact that his friend is going through such a terrible and isolating situation causes his right fingers to rest at an angle over his mouth as he fights a look of despair.
“Keeps me young, boys. Now, come on and sit down; my old knees can’t take standing around like they used to.”
Sherlock was lying on his bed, attempting to read when the soft knock came on his bedroom door. Checking he was decent, Sherlock called out permission to enter and smiled when John stood awkwardly in the doorway, wrapped in his dressing gown and pyjamas.
The next morning, after John has left for work at the surgery, Sherlock takes a cab to New Scotland Yard.
Holmes glares intensely at his amused face.
I left the door open for a part 3 of the series with this ending (which purposefully echos the end of "The Cure for Snoring"), but experiments of their sex life will really not happen from me. I'm not creative enough (or good enough, quite honestly) to imagine a whole slew of those. So just go ahead and let your imagination run wild with the idea ;)
“And what about you, Sherlock?” Zach asks brazenly, “famous detective like yourself, you must get loads of attention. So which is it then: guys or girls? Or both?” He finishes asking with a barely hidden interested leer.
my best friend, which I find perplexing because I never thought I would have one of those.”
When they part, John is still smiling as he says, “To be perfectly clear, I was asking you out.”
“But he came back,” David states, confusion evident in his face and tone, but he isn’t going to push for more than John can give.
“I state again for the record: we had just met. I wasn’t entirely certain I could trust you yet, or how much you wanted to be involved.”
Sherlock enters the flat covered in blood and carrying a harpoon. John looks legitimately unsettled by the scene before him.
“It’s freeing to be able to just drive.”
“Really?” Watson asks in shock.
“If one must place a label on it, that’s probably the closest,” he admits and they fall silent.
Sherlock finally looks up Mary’s body when everything falls silent. He sees the puddle of blood forming around her head, feels the stillness of her body with his own, and he immediately gracelessly scrambles off of her. His eyes land on John, roving over his body looking for any signs of new injuries, only to settle on his leg.
The statement is enough of a shock to Larry that his pressure on John’s neck is lifted. John pulls his head to the left, away from the knife, as he elbows his captor in the solar plexus, steps on his instep, punches him in the nose, and then lands a final blow to his groin all in quick succession.
,” John growled in warning, his own left hand itching to grab his aching cock to finish the job himself. He was too close to an orgasm for this shite.
When Sherlock informs John that he should join him again, John becomes suspicious.
“And there it is: all better,” Watson muses with a small smile.
This time, when Sherlock’s lips trace timidly from his cheek to his mouth, he pulls him closer instead of pushing him away.
,” Watson smirks.
“Why are you holding me?” there’s a definite edge of embarrassment to his voice now.
“A suicide mission?” He asks Sherlock with hurt and anger, “You weren’t even going to tell me that I was about to lose you again?!”
“Seeing Mr. Sherlock ‘Married to my work’ and ‘Girlfriends aren’t really my area’ Holmes
“Didn’t he simply have a good pill and a bad pill in a tin and force you to choose one?” Watson asks, wracking his memory for the details he had later shared on his blog.
“Honesty, Sherlock. Please,” John begs.
to be home.
“Of course you had a real barber straight razor your face. Who does that anymore?” Watson goads.
“Hmm, yes,” Holmes hums in agreement.
Sherlock considered for a moment before nodding, “And how does the pleasure feel?”
Sherlock continues by insulting John (his ordinary contrast to Sherlock’s own genius), the bridesmaids (brides choose mediocre looking women), the priest (the job of the family idiot), and then finally he insults himself by admitting that he is an unpleasant, rude, ignorant, and obnoxious asshole. So really, overall, so far so good.
“Okay,” he says, at a loss for other words.
Watson reaches out and grabs Holmes’ right hand in his left without thinking. Holmes squeezes it reassuringly; he’s not going anywhere.
Sherlock has burdened himself with the task of figuring out if he could give John everything in life that he deserves. He’s come to the conclusion that, no, John is far too good for someone like him, but he shocks himself with his desire to work harder to be worthy of him nonetheless.
“We had just met.”
With a relieved sob, Sherlock lowers his face to John’s knee and wraps his hands around the outside of John’s legs for support, subconsciously avoiding the new wound on the inner calf.
,” Holmes starts, “Our case where we met Mary.”
for finding and kissing every single one on his partner’s body.
sorry,” he says honestly, because he still feels occasional guilt over it.
“It’s with you,” Sherlock said in a moment of candid honesty before he looked down at his feet in embarrassment, “it’s going to be special.”
on John’s skin.
"Oh, shut up," Sherlock smiles before he grabs the back of John’s head and brings their mouths together for a much less chaste kiss this time around.
Sherlock kissed him again before moving to tease down John’s torso with a confidence he had no right to possess, “I’ve never fellated anyone before,” he admitted while nuzzling John’s belly.
My companion sighed heavily before explaining, “They had just come from the Turkish Bath, that is true, but they did not meet each other within its walls. This pair knew each other prior to their visit; in fact, they went in together.”
Sherlock is unable to deduce the naked woman across from him; far too little to go on. Irene infers that John loves Sherlock based on the location of his punch earlier. John laughs humorlessly and asks her to put clothes on as a response.
Sherlock falls on to John’s chest, happily sated, and buries his face in his neck. He noses at a sensitive spot just below John’s right ear before kissing his neck. John sighs and lifts his right hand to run it through Sherlock’s mess of curls.
“Was it?” Sherlock huffs a bit, uncertain how this will affect their relationship now that the haze of lust has been lifted. He’s scared to lose this man because of one stupid wet dream.
better at friendship than him. Clearly.”
John’s eyes meet his again and he hears his name from that familiar voice, but John’s mouth hadn't moved. Sherlock’s brow furrows in absolute confusion; it shouldn’t be possible, so what does it mean?
With a sob I should probably be ashamed of, I turned my body towards his. My hands went to his sides as my forehead and nose met his, our lips unspeakably close to the kiss we both longed for, but it was too dangerous in the light of day. Our position was already too much.
Sherlock grinned and dipped his head, extending his tongue to lick across the wet slit before smacking his lips together, “Not terrible,” he mumbled to himself before holding the base of John’s cock and slowly pushing more of the shaft into his mouth. Inch by inch worked into Sherlock’s mouth before he gagged and pulled back with a deep frown.
“I know, I know,” Watson finally calms down completely and looks at the back of the third case, “This says it was released in 2014, which has already happened. It can’t change the past, can it?” He finishes seriously.
Sherlock’s eyes are dead, certain now that he’s guaranteed that John will never be his. He’s made it possible for John to keep Mary, as he’s previously chosen. It doesn’t really cross his mind that the choice may have actually changed in light of recent events. His love for John never wavers, so why would John’s for Mary?
“Mrs. Hudson normally brings it up,” Sherlock responded, his voice deep from lack of use. Obviously he had spent the entire day sitting around in his mind palace in silence.
“No you didn't,” Watson laughs.
Holmes shifts his eyes as he tries to think of why one shouldn’t, but simply says, “
“Yes, really; I too was young once,” he belittles, “and as hard as it is to believe, I wasn’t always comfortable being myself around people, so I tried to fit in to the moulds that society has placed on us. They never went anywhere or lasted very long, though.”
“Obviously, but what significance could not having solved it have? What difference does it make?”
“Sherlock, that's not very nice,” Mrs Holmes tutted, “he's been a good brother to you.”
John lowered his head to Sherlock’s right shoulder, lips barely brushing the taut skin as he closed his eyes, “God, Sherlock,” he whispered morosely.
Sherlock discovers the heart of the bomb under a section of the floor, but doesn’t know how to diffuse it. John demands he enter his Mind Palace to see if he’s stowed the information away somewhere. He hasn’t, but he does realize that there must be an off switch somewhere. He doesn't tell John this.
John can’t bring himself to move backwards as his breath hitches. Doesn’t
Sherlock blushes pink to his ears and bristles visibly, “Obviously I’ve been embraced by my family…although, not for a long time. And not consensually. Mrs. Hudson occasionally wraps her arms around me but I don’t count that as a sexual or romantic embrace.”
Sherlock huffed and stormed out of Greg’s front door, and letting it bounce against the wall as he stomped into the London darkness. Lestrade was left sitting naked on his sofa with the exaggerated moans of pornstars still calling out from the TV.
There are more freckles on the left than the right. John starts with a kiss to the largest, on the top side of his wrist where his watch typically falls, visible now in the comfort of their home. Next is a smaller one diagonally down and to the right, closer to the thumb. One nearly midway up the forearm on the ulna side, almost invisible for its lightness and nearness to the outside of the bone. In quick succession, he kisses three that make up a small obtuse triangle before moving on to a lone one near the crease of his elbow. He places a loving, ceremonial kiss to the inside of this elbow, just as the other, and thanks a God he’s not entirely certain he believes in for Sherlock’s strength to overcome his past addiction.
“No, nothing here either.”
“You are everything to me, and I daresay that I am in love with you.”
There was a moment of tender silence before Sherlock next spoke, his voice low and so quiet that John almost missed it.
For Gryffindor John Watson and Ravenclaw Sherlock Holmes, this means that they spend most nights - just the two of them - studying in the library together before John heads to bed and Sherlock returns to his potions experiments.
, to be specific. Early on, Holmes drops a snarky comment about Watson’s limited medical skills, and Mrs. Hudson says, “You only say that because you miss the doctor.” You can see immediately from his reaction that she has HIS number. Yes, Holmes misses the doctor and I miss him too. And this is another of those somewhat spooky ways in which Brett’s illness forces the Granada series to correspond with the canon arc–in which, toward the end of the saga, Watson starts to drop out of the picture.
The sounds they hear best, it turns out, are at the low end of the spectrum. So the whistle is also bullshit.
At any rate, when you stop to think about it, conversing in this way with material objects is about 80% of what Sherlock Holmes does for a living; and Brett really
You are more than that
“The law is what we live with,” Holmes sighs, in the penultimate scene, hoping that one day it will be replaced with justice. Paul gives Holmes and the Lucases their happy ending. We the viewers will not get ours.
Mmmmm…opium.
…oh my God. It’s a monkey in Eastern Garb smoking a hookah and sitting on a music box that plays a tinkly little version of the title music. All right, we’ve seen it now, can it please go away…
Holmes fandom had not grown very old before people started pointing out that if Holmes really wanted to hide from Moriarty till it was all over, going on a jaunt with Watson was probably the dumbest way he could have done it. First of all, Watson is not as good at hiding as Holmes is. Second, what idiot does not know at this point that to find Holmes all you have to do is find Watson and wait?
Feared it all might be a bore
Anyway, my point is that this episode really brings home how important Brett was to this adaptation. When he’s on screen, it’s riveting. But there are large swathes of this episode devoted to the Barclay/Wood/Devoy backstory–as there more or less have to be–and it’s just really hard to care that much for that long about it. This is where you really feel the comparative inadequacy of the production values. Even on a good day, Granada Holmes is just a festival of crazy wigs and unconvincing facial hair; “The Crooked Man” is full of period touches and local color, none of it particularly compelling from a verisimilitude point of view. At a certain point you wonder whether it wouldn’t have been better just not to visualize Wood’s backstory and just stay in the room with Henry Wood’s narration. But then, when you do go back to the room and Henry Wood’s narration, it doesn’t really help.
, though it was obviously written after “A Case of Identity”–and moving it to this point in the arc creates some weirdness. As written, “Red Headed League” is basically a comic story with some action thrown in at the end. The Granada episode, by introducing Moriarty, adds a kind of gravity to this story that it was never designed to bear.
Consider that in “The Copper Beeches” as written:
BTW, in the discussion below I’m going to assume that Holmes and Watson are partners (in life as in the detective business) and that the show only left that coded because it was 1984-5. If that bothers you, bail now. (I imagine that anyone bothered by this has in fact already bailed; but you’ve been warned.)
I did not actually do a spit take. But I did sit up and say, “Oh SHIT! She was THAT Natasha Richardson!”
…and the way he drops a ‘hint’ to Watson from across the table by baaaaaaing. (Watson gives him this look for a minute like, “Dude, I thought you were OFF the drugs,” before he gets it. We also learn that Holmes was tasting the evidence before Mulder made it cool:

The Victorian crisis over the theory of evolution actually pre-dates Darwin; by 1893 people had come up with some strategies for reconciling it with the existence of God, and this is one of them: there must be a divine creator superintending the process, or we wouldn’t get these beautiful things like roses that have no apparent utilitarian purpose. Now, to call this a
Just as Spock is only ever put in charge of the Enterprise when it’s about to explode, it is only at this advanced stage of crisis that Granada hired a woman to direct. Sarah Hellings, who directed this episode, is probably best known to readers of this blog as the woman who directed the classic Doctor Who two-parter “The Mark of the Rani.” She does a good job; I am particularly appreciative of the way she shoots the opera house environment. But as with all the earlier “Memoirs” episodes, she is fighting an increasingly uphill battle, which in this case is not made any easier by Jeremy Paul’s unnecessarily complicated and heavy-handed script. “The law is what we live with,” Holmes sighs, in the penultimate scene, hoping that one day it will be replaced with justice. Paul gives Holmes and the Lucases their happy ending. We the viewers will not get ours.
There’s only one interesting question raised for me by “The Last Vampyre,” which is: How did this show get
So, last night I fetched myself a glass of water and a healthy snack, fired up “Copper Beeches,” and sat back to enjoy a nice little unwind after a somewhat exasperating day, when this happened:
It’s a great moment for Colin Jeavons and for his Lestrade, who has never been that honest or that generous with Holmes before. But oh my God, BRETT’S REACTION. I can’t find a gif of it and no single image can do it justice, but the camera stays with him for a long time, and every moment is a journey in itself:
When I found out that Trevor Bowen, who was responsible for the HOB script, also wrote the screenplay for “Frances Carfax,” I feared the worst. But it turns out that like Frances Carfax’s burial, my eulogy for this show was premature. Brett still looks like he’s been through hell, but he now seems to have come out the other side. His face is ravaged; but otherwise, his Holmes seems much more his old self. The voice is back, the energy is (partly) back, and in general there’s just a lot more acting going on. This is also a great episode for Hardwicke; I haven’t been this interested in his Watson since “Devil’s Foot.” I even like Trevor Bowen’s definitely not by-the-book adaptation…until the last five minutes, when it STABBED ME in the HEART.
Linking the vitriol attack to the Secret Book is a clever move on Chapman’s part, not only because it makes the revelation of the Secret Book’s existence more dramatic, but because it emphasizes something which is only latent in the canon story–which is that Baron Gruner is basically a proto-serial killer. That book he’s pasting Violet’s picture into is no different, fundamentally, from the unbelievably pretentious journal that Paul Spector is keeping of his victims in
And getting fat
And once they’re out and about, well, Watson’s sad about leaving the beer behind and he bitches about the cold, but this is absolutely the best way either of them could have thought up to spend Christmas eve and Brett and Burke find a million ways of letting us know that. Watson joining in with Holmes on the “bet” to get the information out of Breckenridge is delightful; he almost drops the ball, but then he just sails on into the con with such confidence and zest it makes your heart grow a size just to watch him.
One thing I really like about this adaptation is the scene of Holmes and Watson in the little guest hovel, in the dark, waiting for Helen Stoner to signal them to come up to the house. As Holmes starts walking Watson through the observations and deductions he made during his examination of Julia Stoner’s room, your skin sort of starts to crawl, much the way Watson’s evidently does. I love Brett’s delivery here. The “zest” that he felt after his confrontation with Roylott has evaporated. Once Holmes realizes what’s really at stake, it’s not fun any more; he’s very worried, both about Helen Stoner and about Watson. “I really have some scruples taking you tonight,” he says, looking sadly up at Watson through the light and shadow. “There is a distinct element of danger.” From the way Holmes’s hand shakes as he lays out his Snake Defense Kit on the bed, we can gather that Holmes shares Indiana Jones’s feelings about snakes. He wants Watson there, because he himself is terrified; but he doesn’t want to expose Watson to the same terror. So in this conversation, he doesn’t mention the snake. Instead, he talks–elliptically, but in a way which seems to be pretty clear to Watson–about what the snake stands for.
I can think of no way to explain it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce THE GRANADA HOLMES REWATCH!
Holmes's brow furrowed slightly. Literary questions, unlike most others, still had the capacity to puzzle him.
It absolutely baffles me that Moffat and Gatiss passed up the opportunity to do their take on “The Speckled Band.” It’s name-checked in “Scandal in Belgravia” in the title John gives one of Sherlock’s cases (”The Speckled Blonde”); but that’s all. As a story that feels very modern in some ways but is encumbered with Victorian Orientalism plus whatever it is that explains the 19th century British fascination with “gypsies,” and in which the H/W relationship game is pretty strong, you’d think it would be right in their wheelhouse. Well, never mind; Granada did one, and they did it right. There are of course some production values-related misfires. But the guest star playing Helen Stoner is a cut above; the creepiness is indeed creepy; and most of all, Brett and Burke make beautiful music together. And all of this gets even more affecting if you read “The Speckled Band,” as I do–and as I believe the whole production team does–as another story in which Helen Stoner was in more danger than Doyle was able to tell us about at the time.
All right, let’s talk about snakes.
I’m not going to linger over these last ones. But behind the cut tag, a couple things about Brett’s performance in this one that kind of break your heart.
Later, when he describes Cubitt’s appearance to Holmes, Holmes says, “Oh now you can’t possibly know that.”  “Really, Holmes?” says Watson, as the doorbell rings, and Holmes realizes Watson’s just seen Cubitt through the window, getting out of his cab. That little smile and head tilt Burke does as the bell rings and the penny drops is just a perfect drop of pure distilled acting joy. You’ve got your methods, Holmes…and I’ve got mine. And while Holmes is teaching Watson how you solve a cryptogram, Watson’s low-key teaching Holmes some client relations skills. Watson realizes immediately that Cubitt could use some emotional support, and finds many little ways to provide it. There are also several moments at which Watson coaches Holmes about his own reactions. Holmes at first shakes these off–”He doesn’t come to me for sympathy”–but eventually learns to appreciate them (as when, at Watson’s prompting, he asks the poor distraught cook if she would like to sit down during the interview).
Every serious Holmes fan, whatever their take on the Great Partnership, has a special place in their heart for “The Three Garridebs.” As a story, it has its drawbacks. The plot is recycled and the detective work elementary. But who cares about any of that? Because at the denouement, “Killer” Evans puts a bullet into Watson, and then this happens:
Paul obviously realized that the best thing about “Thor Bridge” is watching Holmes teach Gibson this very lesson. So instead of having Gibson just take a walk around the block and then come back to Baker Street, as in the canon story, Paul expands the antagonistic stage of Gibson and Holmes’s relationship. Gibson does not in fact come back that day; and this gives us the novel opportunity of watching Holmes starting to fear that his bluff has, for once, failed. He’s so upset with himself for losing the first decent case he’s had in months…and then Watson saves him by pointing out that Dunbar is really the one who needs help, and offering to help wangle them a meeting with her. Their confrontation in Dunbar’s cell, though entirely invented by Paul, fits in seamlessly with the rest of the episode and is delightful to watch. Also delightful (and invented by Paul) is the moment where Gibson’s secretary finally comes around to the museum to invite Holmes down to Thor Bridge and Holmes asks if they’re going to send the motorcar for him. Demand the finest, honey! You’re worth it!
adapt
But with the return to the hour-long format, things seem to have settled down a bit. For “Three Gables,” and now “Dying Detective,” there seems to have been more effort put into making the parts of the episode that don’t have Holmes in them strong enough to stand on their own. Hardwicke is now clearly taking on work that would otherwise have been given to Brett. Mrs. Hudson is taking up more space. The Baker Street Irregulars are back. The guest stars are top-drawer. In fact, many of them starred in other beloved things; so if you have ever wanted, say, to see Jane Bingley really tear the villain a new one, or if you want to see the Earl of Grantham get high on opium, or if you want to see that asshole toff who crashed the Titanic get his comeuppance, “Dying Detective” can do that for you.
Young Plaidder was very confused about the London fogs. By the time I was out of college I had been to London many times and never seen anything like the kind of fog Doyle describes at the beginning of this story. I had no idea that this was because of environmental regulations passed after the deadly London fog of 1952 killed thousands of people.
Well, in fact, nobody chose this. Everyone involved does their best. I particularly appreciate the Misses Garrideb, who are the best thing about this episode. Hopkins has taken a passing reference to the fact that Nathan Garrideb does have some female relatives and out of it created this delightful maiden-lady sister act. Detective stories have always had a special place in their hearts for old maiden ladies; they’re the original surveillance team. Hardwicke plays well against them, and overall his part of the mystery is quite charming. But nothing can compensate for the loss of Brett and Holmes, especially once Watson gets hurt. They do stage the Big Scene, and Hardwicke gives it his best, but…it’s sad. It’s just very sad, and there’s nothing there, and it makes you want to bite the universe for screwing everyone out of what could have been a dynamite show finale.

the human villain…it will not do, Watson. If you would vary your reading diet beyond the papers and the penny dreadfuls, you would be aware of hundreds of precedents that should warn the canny adapter to steer clear of such narratives.

I sat up straighter.
What a little marvel of compression. All of Holmes is in this telegram. His insecurity about what Watson’s marriage means for their partnership (“Have you a couple of days to spare?”), his compensatory bragging (look, they’re wiring me from the west of England now), his not very subtle plea for Watson’s time and attention (“Shall be glad if you will come with me”), his enticement ( “air and scenery perfect”), and finally, the admission that all of this entreating and cajoling was purely an act, because you know and I know, Watson, that you are about to leave your wife at the table and rush out to the west of England with me whether it’s convenient or not (“Leave Paddington by the 11:15″).
("Noble Bachelor" meets "Veiled Lodger"). These are, let's say, uneven. I will include links to all five film reviews, with snippets, in this chapter.
But, again, balanced with this we get the story of Holmes’s developing friendship with Lestrade; and that turns out to be a (to me) unexpectedly compelling story. The three men involved in this investigation all have their own perspectives and their own theories, and it’s tremendous fun to see them playing off each other. Watson’s attachment to his own theory about this being a monomaniac with an “idee fixe” gives him more energy than we’ve seen form Hardwicke in the past couple of episodes. I particularly like the scene where he marches into the sitting room to tell Holmes the game is on, so he should finish up his tea and get dressed because they’re leaving in two minutes. That is one thing I do appreciate about what Hardwicke brings to the table: his Watson loves turning the tables on Holmes and taking charge, and Brett lets us know that Holmes low-key loves it. Take that however you will. Also delicious is Holmes trying to give Watson a hint about the streetlamp without Lestrade noticing, so Watson can score a point over Lestrade and temporarily get to the head of the class.
Holmes acts as if he’s always mildly horrified by Langdale and the fashionable set with which he mingles; but Langdale thinks he knows better, and his insinuating “tittle for tattle” game is full of flirtation and invitation. interestingly, Langdale’s name evokes an immediate spasm of disgust from Watson. Holmes can see himself in Langdale; but the parts of himself he sees there are things with which Watson can have no sympathy. So while Holmes navigates the fancy-dress ball, Watson is in his own native element, digging through grandma Maberley’s attic and sharing her nostalgia for a less complicated and painful past.
Holmes gets that. He accepts Violet’s right to make her own decision about taking the job; he does tell her he thinks it’s dangerous but he doesn’t try to talk her out of going. He agrees to act as her back-up, promising to come down to help if sent for. When Violet reports to him on her investigation, Holmes approves: “You seem to have acted all through this matter as a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter.” Holmes is content to play out the role that, conditions being what they are, Violet can’t play herself: defending her and the victim against the villain’s violence.
If the episode has sympathy for Langdale, however, it has none for his female counterpart, Isadora Klein. Paul has, thankfully, made an effort to mitigate the story’s profoundly racist treatment of Steve Dixie, though it remains the case that the first Black speaking character we’ve seen in any episode of this show so far is a thug who beats up the show’s most sympathetic character. But if anything, Paul has augmented the original story’s misogyny by blowing Holmes’s interview with Isadora Klein up into a Grand Battle of the Sexes. In fact, Paul writes for Isadora Klein and Holmes very much the way later adaptations will write for Holmes and Irene Adler, and it reminds me all over again of why I hate that. Klein manipulates him, tries to coax pity out of him, plays up her feminine vulnerability, and is enraged when he remains impervious to her Wiles. It’s cliche, it’s below standard in terms of this show’s depiction of women, and it seems a bit desperate–as if Paul is using this scene (from which he has removed Watson) to assure us that Holmes is still a paragon of virility who is irresistible to the ladies, whatever your lying eyes may be telling you to the contrary.
to produce it, as he says he intends to do, there seems to me no guarantee that the judge would even take it into consideration–especially since, unlike in the canon story, Turner does in fact die before the trial is over.
suddenly reasserts itself. It’s important for
In the adaptation, “Boscombe Valley” loses some of the canon story’s youthful exuberance; but it also gains some depth. In particular, I think, Hawkesworth uses this opportunity to give us a closer look at Holmes and Watson’s dynamics, and at the complexity of Holmes’s unofficial position.
I really enjoyed “Silver Blaze,” but I find that I don’t have a whole lot to say about it. After the mortal peril, deep thoughts, and grand emotions of “Devil’s Foot,” it’s nice to have an episode that’s just fun, and that’s what “Silver Blaze” is. But we don’t really learn much that’s new about the characters, apart from the fact that Watson is way more into playing the ponies than Holmes realized, and that Holmes seems to have an affinity with horses but really doesn’t like dogs. Actually, that last part isn’t much of a surprise; the only dog in canon that I can think of that Holmes has ever liked is Toby from
Mrs. Plaidder is signed up to one of those word-of-the-day alerts from some online dictionary, and the day they dished this one up she seized it and embraced it to her bosom as if it were a long-lost child. Until she discovered this word, she was unable to articulate it; but she is in fact a haptic person, with a predilection for the sense of touch. Haptic people get joy out of touching things–especially, it seems, things made by the hands of other people. I mean we have pottery in the house that we bought mainly because Mrs. Plaidder likes to hold it. This probably also explains why we took about eight semesters of Introduction to Wheel Throwing at the local art center in the last city we lived in. But I digress.
"Oh, that's not fair."
Watson and Holmes have completely incompatible ideas about what constitutes a holiday. The one time their ideas on the subject converged was when Holmes decided to invite Watson on tour of the Continent, and that’s only because Moriarty was chasing him and he thought he was going die before he’d have to finish it. Since the Return, Holmes has tried humoring Watson–he accepts Musgrave’s invitation to his country estate, he agrees to come with him to the back end of Cornwall–but he can’t make himself enjoy it. (Watson goes shooting with Musgrave; Holmes sits on a bench with his 50 shawls. Watson wants them to enjoy the rugged Cornish landscape together; Holmes wants to take long solitary walks and dig up the remains of dead civilizations.) This perhaps explains why "Boscombe” is the second
There is an unexpected bright spot when Fiona Shaw suddenly turns up as Mrs. Barclay’s best friend:
This is something that I actually really like about this adaptation, because it rescues Watson from much of the humiliation that is dealt out to him by the canon story. “Frances Carfax” is one of the stories responsible for the Stupid Watson myth. In canon, as in “Solitary Cyclist,” Holmes sends Watson out on a solo mission; and this time, Watson does even more remarkably badly, finally embroiling himself in a fistfight with Green from which he has to be rescued by Holmes (who is disguised as a French worker, because of course he is). Watson does a number of things in this story which are really uncharacteristically stupid even for ACD canon, including ignoring Holmes’s request for a description of Schlessinger’s left ear.
Holmes at once fixed his sharp eyes upon me. His hand, automatically moving to light the pipe, had arrested itself mid-gesture. The end of the spill burned, unattended, in midair.
Honestly, I feel like the farther I get into this series the more I understand what’s going on in Mark Gatiss’s brain. I’m not sure I like it; but it does seem to me as if both the “Shoscombe Old Place” and “Frances Carfax” episodes of this series contribute significantly to “The Abominable Bride,” just as (I believe)
So I love all that, and the aftermath in 221B, as Holmes looks at them thinking, “What in God’s name am I to do with these two IDIOTS?” And the rest of the investigation has some fantastic moments. I particularly love Holmes lecturing Green about being patient because they have to wait for the law and due process to have their day–and then, as soon as Green’s gone, telling Watson get the gun, we’re doing this the Baker Street way. “You’re a common burglar,” says Peters; Holmes replies, “My friend is also a dangerous ruffian.” Which is actually, in this episode anyway, sort of true. The little scene later that night when Watson tries to help Holmes think it through and Holmes snaps and stalks off is also very touching. I am even willing to overlook the echoing voiceover that triggers Holmes’s epiphany (STOP DOING THAT) and the fact that they went Extra Melodrama for the rescue from the coffin by staging it at the actual gravesite.
