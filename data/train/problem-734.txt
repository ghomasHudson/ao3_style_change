"This is a cincture, not a chastity belt."
"Come on, we have to get out of here."
His voice was suddenly very gentle, as was his gaze, which rested on the light of the flickering candle, the pupils dilated unnaturally by the dim light.
right above one’s head.” John dropped the food bags on the table and burst out laughing, wheezing when he tried to catch his breath.
After dinner Prior Lambert came up to me.
He took the book from my hand, tore the picture out, and held it to me.
"Could he have gone there by himself?"
I pressed my lips together and shook my head. "No. I can’t."
” John knew the public rooms of the safehouse had to be under surveillance. He didn’t spot the cameras so he spun in the living room, shouting Mycroft’s name over and over.
Sherlock’s expression changed from puzzled to incredulous. “All of them? You’re going to answer...”
"Evidence is of no use if nobody knows who is behind it. Jonah sent me to look for clues in your room, but I didn’t find anything."
"Yes, very much!" I replied, and was amazed to realize it was absolutely true. This almost meditative calm that had prevailed during the common prayer had touched me unexpectedly deep. It felt like when you finally got home after a long journey. Still very inspired by these unfamiliar impressions, I followed the blond to the refectory and to the novice’s table, where I greeted Brother Francis with a friendly nod and took the seat to his right. After a brief look around the room I remained standing like all others until grace was spoken and the brothers took their seats.
"Nobody forces me either," he replied, looking at me defiantly.
"Yes, of course, that too."
It had only been a short sentence, almost casual, but spoken with a seriousness that left no doubt that it was not a mere proposal but a statement that I had to follow. I could not risk losing my job sooner or later.
I used the time to revisit the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius Loyola, while Jonah spent much time in silent prayer in the Church preparing for his profession. The bees remained my responsibility. To my great surprise, Jonah had admitted that he had always been afraid of the little creatures since he was stung by a bee at the age of three and nearly died from an anaphylactic shock. He did not have to explain to me, as a doctor, that allergies were no joke.
Quite innocently, I asked him instead if he would be treated further in the hospital or outside.
"Brother William - into my office. Immediately."
“Because I’m going to kiss your brother and you probably don’t want to see it.”
I shook my head sadly.
“Point made. That song is as horrible as your grandmother’s fruitcake.”
And he’d thought that falling into a ‘relationship’ with Mary had helped. Now he realized that he and Mary really didn’t have a relationship. It was more that Mary led and he followed. He just went along with what she wanted so that he wouldn’t have to be alone.
“I didn’t then, when I was a kid.”
There was a time when John would have thrilled to hear Sherlock’s offer to do chores but now it just made him even more cross. Sherlock was just throwing out trifles to try to salvage his comfortable, settled life after John had spoken the one word that couldn’t be taken back.
What a fool he’d been. What a
"Don’t you want join us?" I was approached by an elderly clergyman whose thinning, graying hair stood in a heavy contrast to his bushy, jet-black eyebrows.
a breeze stings like sleet.
"Yes, go." His voice, only a low murmur before, grew louder. "Just leave me alone!"
At first I had to fulfill a task within the monastery, which could also be classified as 'charity'.
I myself spent the rest of the free time trying to explain to the other brothers who were curious as to precisely what had enticed a former military doctor to live behind monastery walls for a month. It was quite funny how quickly news of my career had spread - and they say that women are the ones that spread most gossip!
There is no comfort
"It would be good if he did not attend the Vigil yet, he still needs a lot of rest. He should not be woken up in the middle of the night."
"We would be back in a few hours!"
“I’m putting your gift under the Christmas tree.”
At the reception desk behind the glass front door sat a disinterested woman with dyed red, permed hair, pink-framed glasses and matching fingernails, who only looked up at me as I leaned on the small counter with both hands and cleared my throat.
Apparently I had struck a nerve, because my opponent turned abruptly.
"Do you know what the name 'Sherlock' means?"
"I'm going to pack my things ..." I muttered, deeply ashamed. "Give Brother Jonah my regrets, will you?"
"Well," I said with a spiteful undertone and looked at him defiantly in spite of his vast height, "His family obviously was not in much of a hurry to look after him."
"Do you?"
Back at work for just a few weeks, John was finding his new position with the team as assistant coach to be part nanny and part drill sergeant to the players. The strategy sessions with the other coaches, watching films of their opponents’ recent matches and planning their own offense and defence strategies wore on for hours. But what really surprised him was just how much he enjoyed his new job. Being told he’d never play again had seemed like the end of his dreams. But he now had a new lease on life in coaching the team he loved.
"Brother William is in a coma."
"Maybe" I replied, "Or someone poisoned you. And that's why I'll call for an ambulance now and have you taken to the nearest hospital. "
"Don’t you think that's a little overbearing? You hardly know him."
Sherlock looked left and right from the doorway, spotting a door on the opposite wall. He started across the kitchen. On his way, he appropriated a plate of food from a waiting tray. Holding it in his hand in the manner of a waiter, he was able to reach the next door unchallenged by any of the workers in the kitchen and slip through.
"Why did you get drunk out of your mind?"
He twisted the corners of his mouth to a wistful smile.
I shook my head defensively, but I could not hide how much the novice's conclusion hurt. For a tiny moment, I had hoped that Sherlock would at least reciprocate my feelings, even if he could not formally act on them. Well, though ...
“That’s it. That’s the story.”
The Father smiled. Apparently the idea of a pharmaceutically active brother of the Order seemed a little absurd. At the thought of it, quite different things came to mind - for example, that I already knew about the herb garden and the shed. It was doubtless near the room in which the honey extractor was situated. On my last visit, I had already noticed the dried herbs that hung in small bundles from the ceiling - but above all I thought of what had happened in this room between Brother William and myself. His honeyed finger in my mouth. Unconsciously, I ran my tongue over my lips. The priest looked at me so I hurriedly gave him an answer.
And the anniversary of Sherlock’s suicide? John had actually stopped at a Catholic church on his way home from work. He remembered how cold it had been inside the sanctuary. The stained glass windows were beautiful but did very little to block the biting wind. He’d knelt in an alcove devoted to the Virgin Mary, looking up at the statute’s serene face, and wondered if Sherlock had found the peace in death that had eluded him in life. He’d dropped a few pound coins into the box and lit a candle in Sherlock’s memory. It had been years since John had prayed in earnest or prayed with any actual faith but he tried that day. He asked the Blessed Mother to pray for Sherlock’s soul, to seek out Sherlock and comfort him. Head bowed, hands folded on the rail, John had let the tears fall that he mostly kept carefully in check. Alone in the sanctuary, he gave in to the despair that threatened to swallow him alive. He wanted to howl and tear at his clothing, consumed by grief, but he kept it tamped down. The only relief he’d allowed himself were the tears silently raining on his hands, still clutching the rail as he knelt.
"Yeah, that's what we all thought ... but then Sherlock got a message. I still don’t know what it was and under what circumstances it reached him, but shortly thereafter Sherlock appeared in the clinic with his brother and two strange guys and they said it was necessary to get me out of the country immediately."
"Let me be, I'm fine," muttered the normally good-tempered blond. He tried to rise but had to sit down again immediately and held his head.
"That's just incredible," he breathed after I had finished, "You saved his life for the third time!"
I'm sorry for the delay in posting this chapter. Real life got busy then I got sick for two weeks. Plus, I'm not the type of writer who can write unless I feel inspired. But - there's finally smut, so I hope you find it was worth the wait.
“Now, there, that’s better. Come over here and sit down. Tell me all about how you came to cross paths with Frank. Imagine! Breaking into Frank’s building yard! He must have been livid!” Mrs. Hudson chuckled and her eyes twinkled at Sherlock again. She sat on the sofa and patted the seat beside her.
"No."
Sherlock couldn’t sit and listen to John’s anguish another minute. He sprang from the bed and jerked open the nearest dresser drawer, rummaging around until he found a blue t-shirt and faded gray track pants. Pulling them on as he headed down the hall, Sherlock gave in to his need for action. Even if John rejected his consolation, every cell in Sherlock’s body knew he needed to at least try to comfort his (
the way it’s going to be.” She paused and gave John a not-quite-right smile that caused a cold chill to run down his spine. “You had your little fling with Sherlock. And I’m going to forgive you for it. I can’t say I didn’t see that coming, when he turned up again. You got it out of your system.” She smiled again, tilted her head and lifted her eyebrows. “And now it’s time for you to come home. And I
"You could still go away together," I murmured, deeply moved by his honest words.
The fight went out of Sherlock. His shoulders sagged as he turned toward his husband and spoke, softer now. “John. How can you think I don’t want this.” Sherlock gestured between the two of them.
"I'm still feeling nauseous...", he complained and opened his eyes in sudden realization. "Could it be that I have thrown up right in front of your feet?"
"And if you go anyway?"
John had planned a special meal to try to make up to Sherlock for his prickly behavior since his injury. John knew he owed Sherlock thanks for supporting him during his recovery. But somehow John was the one who ended up furious, and hurt, and had struck out blindly at Sherlock with the one word that would wound him most deeply. And Sherlock, always one to protect his pride, had retaliated with anger.
In order not to appear rude, I joined in the small talk before I rose.
"I already told you, John - Mycroft carefully investigated every single person  Jonah and I came into contact with. Incidentally, you're only here today because you passed his test, otherwise he would never have allowed me to send Billy to lure you on my trail. "
"I do
"Damn ...", he cursed through clenched teeth and looked at me. "Could you perhaps accompany me a little further?"
Our paths separated shortly thereafter, as vespers and supper time came along, so that we only met again in the lounge. Brother William came a little later than the other men but immediately steered purposefully to a tea table by the window on which Brother Jonah had already set up the chess board for a game. As if he were used to it, he took the seat with the white pieces and so had the first move. Jonah was able to keep up with this pace and before I knew it, Jonah's king had been brushed off the board with a loud rattle by William, who sat back and smiled at me.
"The next hospital is about a 45 minutes drive away, the examination takes another 20 minutes and that’s it. You do not have to stay there, but we would be certain that there is no cerebral hemorrhage. "
Sherlock hung his coat on its hook, turning to hide his face as he rolled his eyes at John’s response. “I got a haircut. I’d hardly call that stupid.” He crossed the room and dropped himself into his chair, not even bothering to take off his shoes before folding his legs up underneath himself.
I swung my legs over the edge of the bed and looked up at him.
After the end of the service the brothers left the church in two rows and gathered for dinner in the refectory - Brother William, however, was missing. At first I thought he had left for Brother Jonah to bring him his food, but then I saw one of the novices with a wooden tray that contained a soup bowl and a glass of water; he set out in the direction of the sick-room. In the dining room I looked around again and could not find the slightest trace of the man, who was almost painfully missing. Slowly I began to worry and longed for the evening gathering in the recreation room; I wanted to inquire after the whereabouts of Brother William and hoped that my questions would not excite too much attention.
The high, wooden double doors of the west portal were closed but, as I noticed after a slight pressure on the brass latch, not locked. I pushed them open just far enough to slip through and close them silently behind me. I found myself underneath the organ mound in a small entrance area that was dimly illuminated by four ceiling lamps, with a small basin filled with holy water on the left, while on the right a wooden shelf held songbooks for guests. In fact, I had noticed that sometimes some people from the nearby village appeared, mostly old, single women. However, they brought singing-books with them, as I had already observed.
Mary was warm, comfortable, easy in bed. As far as John was concerned there was no bad sex. It was effortless with Mary, just falling into a routine of kiss-fondle-intercourse-cuddle without much effort on either of their parts. He’d just sort of gone along. It was like they’d been together for years instead of months.
John pulled out his phone, thumbing quickly through his contacts. There it was – he still had Mycroft’s number. He angrily jabbed the phone. Mycroft picked up after two rings.
Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes but didn’t answer. But he also didn’t move away, his cheek still on John’s shoulder and his fingers twined with John’s.
“Sam,” Sherlock murmured.
"Are you a relative?"
They were middle aged men, after all. Both as set in their ways as treestumps.
"We both know that it was never really about Jonah."
The edge of the sink dug into Sherlock’s sacrum where John pressed his weight against Sherlock’s body, pinning him to the sink. “
"John, maybe you're right - it might be better if you called an ambulance ..."
“But you hate Christmas.”
“Yes! I said MI6. Who do you think sponsored my campaign against Moriarty's network?” Sherlock grinned mischievously. “How do you feel about sleeping with a spy?”
and more, made more precious by the just-below-the surface awareness of how it could all change in an instant and more cherished because they’d both suffered for the lack of it.
Sherlock leaned over the table, eyes blazing as he spoke.
"You don’t have to decide immediately. Above all, I do not want to push you in a certain direction. This is a decision that only you can make, all alone. I personally think that you can only benefit if you stay a little longer and you open your mind to these thoughts. Perhaps you could talk to one of the older brothers or with the novice master, for this is nothing new to them."
"If Brother Jonah needs help, then I want to help him get it - so why not let it be me who helps him? I know I'm just a stranger who has nothing to do with the whole thing, but maybe that could be what’s needed? Perhaps I can look at it more objectively than you or Brother Jonah can?"
"Good evening, Dr. Watson, I am Brother Jonah. Prior Lambert sent me to pick you up for vespers."
Taking a half step back, Sherlock regarded John solemnly, his gaze darting between John’s eyes. Whatever he was looking for, Sherlock must have found it in John’s gaze because he reached for John again with his answer, “You didn’t know.” The right side of his mouth tilted in a soft half-smile before he captured John’s lips once again.
"What's going to happen to Jonah when I'm gone? I promised that I would protect him ... "
"It fascinates me that he knows so much about nature, herbal medicine, beekeeping - these are not exactly topics with which one is normally occupied as a friar, right?"
I went in search of a café and got ready for a nice cup of tea when I passed the colorful stalls of a market - the Marylebone Farmers' Market, of which the strange guy in Montague Street had mentioned. Again and again I had wondered what he had been trying to tell me, but each time I came to the conclusion that his comment was probably nothing more than the ramblings of a junkie. Maybe he only knew Sherlock because he was part of his inglorious drug-using past and had enjoyed making me wonder. I was still reluctant to follow his advice and look around the market, but my stomach gave a loud growl. Now, a little stroll through the market could not hurt. I would grab a bite to eat, maybe buy some fresh vegetables, and then head home.
Sherlock sprang up and grabbed his coat. “You crush the candy. I’ll be right back.”
It seemed like a good solution to me as well so I nodded my agreement to the dark-haired man. In silent agreement we stepped out of the little side chapel; Jonah was still kneeling in the same place as before when we went back to the main room of the church. We turned, when Jonah's voice rang out, unexpected, loud and clear, as if he had come to a decision after much deliberation.
Flicking ash from the tip of his cigar, Frank spoke softly. “If you’re fucking with me, kid, cutting off your balls will be the least of what I’ll do. If you’re one of Jim’s goons, I’ll break every one of your fucking fingers. Then I’ll twist your kneecaps around to the back of your knees so you won’t even be able to sit down to take a shit. And if you do somehow manage to sit down, you won’t be able to wipe your ass.” He picked up a pen from the desktop and a notepad then held them out to Sherlock.
"Victor."
I nodded to encourage him to continue speaking.
“As you wish, John. Are you sure you want to know these
Mycroft rolled his eyes but complied with a sigh, turning his shoulders away from his brother and glaring out of the window.
"I can not talk about what he entrusted to me in the context of the sacrament of penance. If I didn’t know you were present when he asked me, I should not even tell you that the conversation actually took place. "
" How do you feel now? Interchangeable? "
Sherlock cleared his throat and glanced down at the table. “I’m going out. For work.”
Again, he tried to open his eyes and let me pull him up and lean his upper body against one of the barrels. My eyes glided over the surroundings, looking for a way to support me to pull Jonah to his feet. Only now did I see the blood that stuck at the edge of the barrel before which the young friar had lain. I had a completely new idea, and I reached for the broken bottle, which lay on the side of the boy. No blood. Not the smallest droplet. I held the lower part of the bottle under my nose and grimaced - gin, clearly. Except for a small sip, it had been completely emptied. The question from whom no longer bothered me. I could not tell exactly why it was, but the fact that he was drunk and obviously just fell made me incredibly angry. Yes, he did have some problems at the moment, but that was not a solution either.
The effect on Frank was instantaneous - as soon as Sherlock had started to speak,  Frank had lowered his cigar into a glass ashtray and sat forward with an expression of shock on his face. Once Sherlock finished his brief declaration, Frank gestured to the men standing behind Sherlock. “Out!” he growled. The workmen scrambled to clear the office; the last one slammed the door behind him.
I couldn’t do anything but stare at him. All the air seemed to have escaped from my lungs, and I felt as if I would faint at any moment. Brother William obviously hadn’t noticed it - or he just didn’t care. Instead of taking notice of my condition, he drew the bundle of chaste tree leaves which had previously been hung up to dry, from the depths of his garment, and threw it on my bed.
Sherlock leaned down and breathed in my ear. "If you can solve this knot, I'm all yours, John Watson."
He’d exchanged texts with Mycroft and before he’d even unlocked the door at Baker Street, he’d been granted access to post messages to the secure website.
Sherlock carefully got to his knees and climbed over John’s leg to settle behind his back. John rolled to his side facing away from Sherlock. He let his top knee fall forward, opening his arse for Sherlock, nervous but excited at the same time. But Sherlock gently lifted John’s leg and stacked it on top of his bottom leg. Sherlock made a quiet shushing sound. John bit his lip, confused and a little alarmed at what his unpredictable flatmate might have planned. He craned his neck as far as possible and saw that Sherlock’s hand was around his cock, lining it up with John’s opening. Alarmed, John nearly whined, “Sherl…”
What? Sherlock!
But Sherlock cut him off, “Just do it!”
The blond shrugged.
The older monk who had made that statement looked at Jonah with a mixture of mistrust and pity; it was impossible to tell which emotion was stronger.
"... you, exactly."
“I’m Carlos. And you are?”
"No, your remarks! This and the way you play with me. "
"Brother, this is John Watson, he will be our guest in the next four weeks."
"Please, lie down ..." I pleaded and put my hands on his shoulders to press him down gently.
At first I wanted to avoid it. Place a gruff reply. Something like 'If I knew what my problem is, I would not be here'. But I changed my mind. Did I really ever think consciously about why I felt
I turned to the policeman, who eyed me critically and obviously wondered why I was sneaking around the area, occasionally throwing curious glances into the buildings’ entrances and mailboxes.
Just after the turn in the stairs, John was suddenly flooded by a red-hot feeling of their
“Someone built a bonfire. We stayed out for hours. I was too little to slide down the hill alone but my parents, Harry, my other relatives took turns taking me. And afterwards we had hot cocoa in the big farmhouse kitchen while our fingers and toes thawed.”
I stopped in the doorway and looked around at him.
think? Why are you even bothering to ask now?” John’s hands fisted at his sides. “Did it ever occur to you to ask
I blushed a little, he had met with his answer but the nail on the head. "Yes, something like that ..."
"You don’t have to, of course, it was only an offer."
After I had started the job at Bart's, I no longer showed up at our weekly meetings. At first I had called her secretary with ever new excuses invented to move the dates with her, but at some point I had given up calling at all. I no longer needed her help, at least I thought I  was able to lead a normal life as a civilian.
"You sound like I will be down a long time."
Mycroft’s eyebrows twitched upward. “And Miss Morsten?” His tone cut John like a knife.
from each. In fact, you even said those exact words to Mrs. Hudson. Why would I have not believed?”
Pregnant! John had seen spontaneous healings. Impossible to believe, miraculous healing g of irreversible medical conditions. It wasn’t only faith healers who could cause patients to throw away their crutches and walk again. He’d seen patients on their deathbeds spontaneously go into remission and live many healthy years.
"I do not want to know what Brother Jonah confessed, I just want to know where he went after that."
My thoughts returned to the novice’s words.
"No, I set off while you heard his confession. And that's why I thought you might be able to tell me ... "
The chess pieces quickly found their way back to their starting positions and William opened the game with a move of one of his pawns. Jonah countered without any hesitation and would probably have continued the game at this rate if an older brother had not touched his shoulder.
But the three-day-beard kisses. Oh! the three-day-beard kisses are something else entirely. Intense, demanding, manly in a way that makes John’s toes curl before Sherlock even lays a hand on him. The scratch of wire-like whiskers at the edges of John’s lips, like tiny electrical probes sending sparks down John’s spine.
While he was sitting in his chair, his mind was far, far away. Sherlock could tell from the way the creases in John’s forehead deepened and the way his bad shoulder sloped that John wasn’t lost in a good memory. No, not good at all; the way John’s left thumb rhythmically stroked his right palm told Sherlock the memory was indeed dark. He moved to crouch in front of John’s chair, looking up into his closed-off face.
"Can we talk to each other, please? And please - stop pretending to take your vow of silence seriously. That doesn’t stop you from talking to others. "
"A voi che amate *," whispered Sherlock, tilting his head back to my touch.
With an irritated sigh, the woman turned and disappeared into an office beside the dish room. She returned a few seconds later with a small paper envelope and tossed it to Sherlock. “Don’t forget again.”
Resigned, I shook my head. "I don’t really understand myself ..."
And conjecturing.
Of course he did not answer, but he peered into my eyes, as if searching for an answer to a question that only he knew. And he held my hand a little too long.
With my hands buried in the pockets of my jeans, I retreated to my room, deeply insecure after what I had just experienced, because now there were two things that occupied me: the way Brother William had looked at me - and his relationship with Jonah. The two men seemed to know each other amazingly well, because otherwise I could not explain the knowing smile that they had exchanged at the subject of sibling rivalries. For a brief moment it occurred to me, if it could be that the two were not merely brothers in terms of their religious affiliation, but might actually be blood relatives. I  ruled that out quickly, for there was not the slightest evidence in their looks.
I knew I looked extremely horrified when I understood what Sherlock hinted at.
"See you in two weeks!" Brother Christopher called after me, as I unlocked my car.
What's going on?
"I don’t have a lot of luggage with me. We can go see some more if it’s alright with you," I said, pushing my bag under the bed.
You can not get away from me so easily …
"Obviously."
A headache settled in at John’s temples, a dull thump of anger and hurt and confusion. Sherlock and Mycroft had made plans without consulting him. At least Sherlock had explained the plan before he jumped and had thought he was keeping in touch and keeping John updated on his plans.
, petrified in horror.
"At the moment
The conversation had been more relaxed than I had ever dared to hope so I headed for the hospital just before noon.
The large leather desk chair squeaked under his weight as he sat down. He picked up the salmon from the dinner plate with his fingers since he’d neglected to nick a fork. As he chewed, he pulled open drawers in the desk. He found a pistol in the first drawer, a Sig Sauer 9mm semi. He popped the magazine and ejected the chamber, then inserted the ejected cartridge back into the magazine while he chewed another bite. He slid the magazine back into place and set the safety before he wedged it into the small of his back between the waistband of his jeans and his pants. The next drawer yielded a fat cellophane baggie of cocaine. Sherlock licked his pinky, stuck it into the white powder then took a quick taste. Smiling,he stuck the baggie into his sock. The other drawers held nothing of interest so Sherlock shut them quickly, finished off his dinner and slipped out of the office.
"Will you visit me again tomorrow? Otherwise, I’ll die of boredom. "
"What do the knots at your waist mean?"
"Dramatic performances at night appeal to you, don’t they?"
“And you, John? What have you been up to these many months? I haven’t seen you since last Christmas.”
I swallowed, unable to finish my sentence.
He shook his head and turned to go ahead of me; he seemed to have aged years in the last few days, as I noticed only now. Even if he made the impression yesterday evening that he had everything under control, his exhaustion was clearly visible.
Hands shaking, Sherlock took them and quickly scribbled Mycroft’s office number. He prayed that Mycroft was in his Diogenes Club office today.  Frank took the notepad from Sherlock and glanced at it. “A transatlantic call costs a bundle.”
"I’ll come with you."
, and
“Two then, that’s enough. I need to check in at the surgery about my job, while I still have one.” John rolled toward the far side of the bed and stood. He watched Sherlock roll  onto his stomach, taking the place John had just vacated.  John looked down at his long back, beautiful except for the white medical tape. No, beautiful even with it.
He turned to me and stuck his index finger in my chest.
I also noticed that my mind was no longer fogged by recurring confusing thoughts of Brother William. A smile crept onto my lips; I was ready to open up to new experiences and become part of the community in the weeks ahead. This also meant for me that, however, I needed to settle existing differences, even if they really only existed for me. In fact, Brother William had not behaved differently to me than he had during our brief acquaintance; he was as kind-and as silent-as ever. Nevertheless, I now realized how much I had begun to put each of his gestures  and the rare words literally - even his slight snort during the kitchen service had upset me to the extreme, while I probably would not have reacted at all if, for example, Brother Jonah had made a sound like that.
My gaze wandered along the opposite wall while I counted the windows, soundless, with slightly open lips. Did I just imagine I could see a dark curly head in the window frame over there, about 50 meters away? I leaned forward a little, narrowed my eyes to be able to see past the sun glare, but now the dark silhouette I had just imagined seemed to have disappeared.
"Can I see the chocolates?"
"Then you surely know what I mean."
"That ... that is the letter, Brother Jonah's letter! I saw him in the living room only yesterday! What do you want with it and why did you ... "
"... that Mycroft took before I even had a change to look."
"In what way?"
William’s attitude toward Jonah had also changed drastically. He watched him with an earnest, anxious gaze and devoted himself only half-heartedly to the game. He seemed to lose the last game deliberately to make his opponent happy. Both men withdrew immediately, Jonah only nodding for goodbye.
"Brother William is Jonah's mentor. They are very similar in a certain way, even if they differ strongly in character. Brother William is very self-centered, he is able to lose himself in his work for hours, completely forgetting the world around him. It’s his asset, that he can devote himself to a task with all his heart. Brother Jonah, on the other hand, is incredibly versatile and can adapt to new situations on very short notice. He has a wide range of talents but is very volatile - which is basically nothing bad, but Prior Lambert and I thought that if he was supported by Brother William, he might develop an even deeper faith and Brother William's peacefulness would be a good influence. And I am convinced that peace and silence are exactly what Brother Jonah needs now. He is agitated and cannot deal with things. Any conversation would be wrong now. It does you credit that you worry about him, but give him time until tomorrow, maybe the dark clouds will have dispersed, and if not, you can still offer him your support. "
Coming around the desk once again, Frank stared down at the top of Sherlock’s curly head while silent tears leaked down Sherlock’s cheeks. “Ok, kid. I’ll cancel that call. I can always call them later if you turn out to be a little shit.” He bellowed “Miriam” over his shoulder. “Cancel that call,” then hauled Sherlock up by the back of his shirt collar. “Stop sniveling. I’m going to send you to get cleaned up and fed. My wife will take care of you. Help her out at home today, wash the windows or something for her. I’ll decide what I want to do with you.”
Sherlock now spent very little time at the flat even when he wasn’t working. And John’s ache deepened when he thought about how he’d been the cause of Sherlock’s recent vacancy. If only John had not been so wrapped up in his own misery. If only...
"More reliable than any weather forecast, right?"
"I like to come back. Even though I have long since found what I was looking for. "
"It is possible, but the advantage is that my stay here is for a limited time and you do not have to see me again so you shouldn't regret that you entrusted me with these things."
Apple? No-one can live with just one apple ... "
you say those things?”
"We have nothing to fear now," Sherlock reassured me. "They've all been arrested, John. Every single one of them. "
I looked around, amazed. The Prior had raised his voice but he still sat just as still behind his desk as before.
As I pushed the book over to her, she smiled gratefully and pointed to the door I had just stood in front of.
He sat down on the mattress, stretched his hand to the wooden chair on which I had sat yesterday evening and offered me the seat beside him.
"No. Well, yes, a little."
am his doctor. You can call the clinic during the day, and if you can prove your claim that you’re his doctor, we’ll let you know how he’s doing. You know how it is with privacy. "
"Mr ..."
"This seems more dramatic."
Reaching across the space between them, Mrs. Hudson patted his hand where it lay on the sofa. “Young people want to be on their own, make their own way in the world. I was your age once, young man. I remember.” She stood and looked around the room. “Did you have a bag, Billy?”
I sat down on the bed and pulled out my bag, stored my clothes in the dresser on the opposite side of the room and finally put a small, blue-white patterned notebook on the nightstand. Ella’s instructions for me to write down everything that happened in my life had echoed through my head again and again and I decided to really try it this time. Yes, I would write about all the things that I experienced here. Hopefully, in the end this book would contain the spiritual development I so badly demanded to become acquainted with, along with stories about all the people I met. I would write about all that could fill my life with meaning and in a few years I might leaf through these notes, remember this time and smile fondly.
My hesitation was evidently answer enough, because he immediately raised his hands defensively.
Ella smiled back, but to my amazement, she noted nothing this time.
“Better?”
I nodded in agreement, loosening my legs from the uncomfortable sitting position and stretching, while Jonah got up a little clumsily as well. He also answered the question I probably would have asked him next:
spend his life in the monastery. I mean - don’t get me wrong, I like it very well here, the way you stick together and help each other selflessly is really impressive and I can imagine how deep your faith is ingrained in each one of you ... but have you ever thought about a. .. "
"How dare you criticize me? You of all people? The man who is to blame for all my misery? I was always there for you and what did you do? When I came out to Mom and Dad that I'm a lesbian? You just holed up in your room when they set me adrift. That’s a big brother everyone would love to have, eh, John? And yet I have always stood by your side, when you've borrowed money from me so you could pay your tuition fees, when I let you stay in my small flat when they expulsed you, too - and that’s how you thank me? Hm? For the first time in my life I am really happy and now you want to ruin that, just because you yourself are not able to have a normal relationship, for you, it is all just about fun - your colleague giving you a blowjob between surgery and lunch or whatever you do in your posh hospital to pass the time
The subject of the novice lesson could not have been more appropriate - Father Andrew spoke of mercy and forgiveness and was not tired of reaffirming that they should be an indispensable part of charity to each one of us if we were angry with someone.
"Alright," I replied calmly, "I'm sorry, Jonah, I did not want to upset you."
On the other hand, Sherlock’s tears had never bothered John. John had been a comfort when Sherlock needed him. And now that he needed Sherlock, the wall of John’s amnesia kept Sherlock from returning the gesture. John wasn’t type type of man to welcome comfort from a stranger. And that’s what Sherlock was to John - a stranger, a flatmate to share the rent, nothing more.
"I just thought ... if you want to take off your clothes before you go to bed ..."
"It wasn’t a lie. He just wanted to be close to you. "
He had not said much during his nighttime visit, but the words were firmly anchored in my memory. I was still trying to continue the conversation, especially since I no longer had to fear that he was taking my comment amiss - on the contrary, what just happened seemed to me like a reasonable ground for suspecting.
John hung his head. “Yeah, about that. Mary asked me out. It was easier to just go along. I thought my best friend and partner was dead.  I just didn’t care anymore, it was easier to go along with her than to be alone.”
"Sorry," I mumbled, clearing my throat.
What was John doing two weeks ago, instead? He thought back. It had been another innocuous night at Mary’s house. She’d made pasta for dinner. She washed the dishes; he dried and put them away. Afterward they’d finished off the bottle of pino grigio they’d opened with dinner. They’d turned in early had had rather forgettable sex. Had it been good? If asked, John would have answered yes at the time. But now?
"It doesn’t seem unusual to you, either. If I wouldn’t know exactly that you really are a computer scientist, I would have rated you as a student of the socio-psychological direction by now... "
"Can I see?"
John took a booth in the back, ordered a pint and stared at the closed file. “My explanation, my apology” echoed in his memory, causing him to wearily rub the heels of both hands into his eyes. He took a long pull from his glass to chase the memory away.
Just as Sherlock drifted into a light sleep, a sound drifted through the floorboards.
Two years he’d grieved Sherlock, believed that his lover/partner/boyfriend had committed suicide right in front of him. Two years he’d cried himself to sleep. Two years he’d lived a ghost of an existence, merely going through the motions of being alive. He and Sherlock had been involved for almost a year before his jump. They’d never actually “come out” – hadn't had to, since everyone who knew them assumed they’d been romantically involved from the start.
Sherlock cut John off roughly. “I am going out!”
"I'm sorry," the priest replied, "I did not mean to blame you for inciting him to break the rules ..."
"But..."
Sherlock was dressed and waiting for John, groomed to the nines, in ten minutes. John had changed into his best suit, the navy blue double breasted one with narrow trousers he wore to weddings (and funerals, but let’s not think of that now). His starched white shirt gleamed and he’d knotted his burgundy tie with hints of gold in a double Windsor. And he’d used product on his hair. A lot of product. Sherlock swallowed audibly when John stepped into the room and took his hand.
His face turned to a dark shade of pink and he made an effort to turn away.
I cleared my throat and interrupted him in the middle of his little speech.
"No. I'd just like to hear from you if you would approve of Brother Jonah returning to us. I'm not sure if it suits him to be alone so often - especially now, without Brother William. "
John laughed. “No, those experiences were always beer-based.”
"Dr. Watson?" Prior Lambert looked at me with a frown and I felt caught immediately.
at the bite of violin strings.
Stroking alongside the outermost bandage with the tip of his index finger, John made a sympathetic sound. “Christ, Sherlock. That night, at the restaurant...”
What Sherlock didn’t see as he flailed was John, hit by an unobservant cyclist who knocked him to the ground head-first. John got up from the pavement quickly and, since all attention was on Sherlock’s ‘suicide,’ no one thought to insist that John have a CT scan to check for concussion. Thus, said concussion went undiagnosed. John never noticed his mild memory problems because – well, he couldn’t remember, so he didn’t know he had a problem. Others around him attributed his memory lapses to the horror and grief of watching his best friend and flatmate commit suicide right in front of his eyes.
"I'm his doctor!", I lied in despair, but even this argument did not make the man change his mind.
"May I ask you something?" I blurted out as I set the plates on the tables, while Jonah followed with the cups.
"Sherlock taught me just before he took his vow of silence, just in case we need to talk unobtrusively. And after you told me what happened to Sherlock, I brushed up. "
Kissing, licking, hands roaming. Rutting, sliding against Sherlock’s hardness. The sensations - new - curl his toes.
"Soon,” Sherlock signed
I could not help but kiss him on the lips.
Mycroft paused, thinking back to the events of two years prior. “There is something, Sherlock. When you jumped, as Doctor Watson ran towards St. Barts, he was struck by a cyclist. He took a hit and was knocked head-first to the road. He got up immediately and walked to you, but I do remember witnesses saying Dr. Watson seemed rather dazed. I thought he was putting on a good show to convince Moriarty's snipers that you’d jumped. But that may have been an error. What if he struck his head when he went down?”
moving from place to place
"You called him 'Sherlock' when we were in the corridor."
"It's hard to believe that."
He clicked the audio file again, then again, then again until tears flowed. Tears turned to sobs, sobs turned to wailing and wailing turned to animalistic howls. He dropped to his knees on the floor beside the bed, bent double, gnashing his teeth, keening in agony.
“Are you even aware of the noises you make? You’re like a gorilla
Without hesitation, the nurse hit the buzzer and gave me access. I nodded my thanks and then ran down the hall to Sherlock’s room. The louvered blinds in front of the observation window were closed. I had no choice but to enter the room without knowing what to expect. I knew how to handle blind emergency situations from my time in the Army - but I was armed then. I took a deep breath, straightened my shoulders, and opened the door as quietly as possible.
After a few minutes of quiet comfort, the novice had quieted and breathed a soft 'thank you'. He was about to get up when his gaze fell on Brother William and his face froze into a mask of terror. He pressed his hand to his mouth to suppress a scream and only then did I realize what frightened him:
"I have vowed obedience - if Prior Lambert forbids me to visit him, then I will stay here."
Sherlock just raised an eyebrow and calmly took another bite of salad.
If I could believe the words of the older brother, Brother William was still excluded from the common activities of the Order until tomorrow evening, so I had plenty of time to talk privately with him. And one thing he could rely on: I would remain obstinate.
Sherlock pushed the heels of his hands into his tightly closed eyes, hard. He took two even breaths then dropped them again as he turned toward John. “John, before you say any more, there is something I want to give you. Please, just read this information and listen to the file before you say any more.”
I understood. I would like to keep that promise. I took all the time in the world as I opened each button of his outer garment in turn, even though I could easily have touched his heart thanks to his slender build. Still, I worked my way down the placket of the habit until my hands melt the cincture tied around his waist. I paused for a moment and looked up at Sherlock, who had been watching me closely all the time. Almost two weeks had passed since our reunion but we had not slept together even once - we had kissed and constantly sought the proximity of the other, but we had never gone further.
"He could show you a few things if you would like to help him out more often."
"What?" His voice was still slightly shaky; I knew this tone too well.
"You are impossible ..."
I had not seen much of Brother William or even Brother Jonah during the rest of the day - while the latter was probably staying in bed to get some rest as I told him, the former appeared in church, as usual, at prayer time and attended dinner as well, but apart from that, he was nowhere to be seen, especially not in the recreation room. He almost seemed to avoid me since my unwanted visit.
What hurt most was that John didn’t act the least bit happy to find Sherlock alive. Instead, he seemed furious that Sherlock hadn’t died.
"No, you'll recover," I whispered, pulling him closer.
"Where did they take you?"
He licked his lips, stalling for time as he glanced around the kitchen to assess the situation. He stopped stock still when he noticed the ring he’d bought but had hidden in the back of his sock drawer, now twinkling on the third finger of her left hand. It was obvious that she’d found it while he was gone, taken it out of the box and began to wear it. He hadn’t asked her to marry him, not really - Sherlock had interrupted his hesitant, faltering proposal.
Snapping into action, Sherlock took the stairs two at a time and overtook Mrs. Hudson by the time she reached the top. He followed her down a hallway leading off to the right of the upstairs foyer and into the second doorway on the right. It was a spacious bedroom furnished with a large bed, dark wood dresser and nightstand.
We went back into the room and sat side by side on the bed.
was a bit faded, obviously the key was not working properly.
"Jonah, you’d better be in bed."
"Like the Prior, I will not rashly condemn anyone. But if I was given the choice of whom I would rather believe, I would not have to hesitate a long time. And now go, John, otherwise the food will be cold before you leave the kitchen. "
She only nodded.
"Can you be sure that’s not it? You said yourself that you don’t know where he's gone since you saw each other in hospital and that you didn’t know why he suddenly chose to live as a monk. Couldn’t it be just that he only plays a role so as not to attract attention while keeping an eye on you? "
He moved around the table, which suddenly seemed a physical metaphor for all the things that had separated them the past few months.
After the initial newness of their relationship wore off, things returned to much the same as they’d been before Sherlock jumped and John got his concussion. There were a few marked differences. Sherlock no longer forgot and left John behind at crime scenes. In fact, John was usually so much at the front of his thoughts, he had to learn to think around his John-thoughts. And John gave up his full-time position at the surgery, He stayed on the locum list and worked a few shifts a week to give them an income they could rely on to pay the bills but as The Work picked up with the spread of news of Sherlock’s return, he took on fewer and fewer surgery shifts in favor of wild chases and all night stakeouts with Sherlock.
"Because he asked me a question that aroused my ambition."
“I do have things to do today,” John continued. “Get some clothes from Mary’s, talk to her, arrange to get the rest of my stuff.”
John stroked upward until his hand cupped Sherlock’s nape. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
"Why do you blush, Doctor?"
I had already gathered so many new impressions that I decided I would put pen to paper as soon as I could. I could write about the architecture of the building, the ornate cloister, the details of the herb gardens, and Prior Lambert, who had patiently answered all my questions and was clearly committed to making me feel comfortable in his convent. I could write about my strange encounter with Brother William... My eyes flicked over to the booklet. If I did, then my little A5 Booklet certainly would not suffice, that was already clear to me.
After Brother Jonah did not appear for vespers or dinner, I seriously began to worry about him. Presumably, it would not hurt anyone if I unobtrusively inquired of Father Christopher for the whereabouts of the novice, since he himself had previously contacted me, because he was worried about the young man. I looked at the clock; it was just before seven so I would probably find the Father in the lounge. Carefully, I opened the door, pushed as inconspicuously as possible into the room, which was populated by the majority of the friars, and looked around. By now most of the faces were familiar to me, even though I could not immediately assign the right name to everyone. There was Brother Elijah, the cook, who was in conversation with one of the novices, who had helped him more often in the kitchen and probably also had some interest in this regard. Father Andrew stood by the fireplace with two other priests, saying something that made his interlocutors smile ... and there was Father Christopher. He sat in one of the armchairs and studied the daily newspaper. Just when I looked over at him, he looked up so that our eyes met. As soon as I started to walk towards him, he put aside his paper and stood up.
The gaunt man stepped back uncertainly, looked at his fellow-brother, then at me, and then stormed out with an angry snort.
John slid his hands down her arms until he could grasp her hands. “No, it’s more. Um, personal. Come on, let’s sit down and have tea. We can talk.”
"Today at noon, in the church. He prayed and then asked Father Christopher to hear his confession. Maybe he could help you ... "
"I will get straight to the point, Dr. Watson - did you take Brother Jonah to the hospital to see Brother William?"
"You seem to know him well ..." I mused, giving him a questioning look.
“What’s that in your hair?” John reached up and casually picked at a spot of a white substance in one of Sherlock’s curls. “It’s dried in. Christ, Sherlock, it’s really stuck. What is this?”
A sound from the room signaled to me that my feet had been faster than my brain - I was already standing at the door, looking at Brother William, who was sitting at his desk, bending over a flat white object with a magnifying glass and tweezers. The realization of what he was doing made me freeze in the middle of my step.
"Is that a picture of ..."
"The more self-blame he feels about this ... incident, the more careless he becomes. And unless we can be sure that the danger is finally averted, it would certainly be best if he stayed in his monastery and prayed for our salvation, right? "
. The thought came unbidden.
“You didn't.”
“I didn’t say it’s bad.”
“When I was five, my family visited a cousin’s farm for Christmas. I don’t even know where we were. Somewhere out in the countryside with gentle hills. It snowed quite a bit.”
"Don’t touch me!"
"Would you please accompany me to my office for a moment?"
"Promise!" I answered and waved to him one last time before making my way home with a soft sigh.
"Why?"
This knowledge, I was sure, would never meet the high demands he had placed on himself and his work, if I could take the words of his fellow brothers for granted - and why would they lie to me? I could not escape the aura of perfection that seemed to surround him. How, then, would what I was doing ever be enough to ignite that tiny spark of recognition in his eyes once again, that he had showed to me yesterday afternoon? I had read the book until I had not been able to keep my eyes open any longer ... To my astonishment, he now gave me a benevolent look and led me immediately, as soon as I had put on the protective clothing, into his work.
Jonah's face flickered with a mischievous grin before he conspiratorially leaned over to me.
I could see how close he was to despair. I decided to take the first step and started signing to tell him that we could communicate with each other this way. My attempts were rather rough and I was sure that I made many mistakes but Sherlock seemed to understand me. Of course I could have just talked to him - his hearing was not compromised. Still, I desperately wanted him to see how much I tried; wanted him to know that he was worthy of not choosing the easiest way.
But Sherlock was too good. Within a few short minutes, John pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder and gasped, “Sherlock.”
I nodded understandingly, though I had not realized the extent of the whole game of hide-and-seek. Maybe Jonah was right that he and Sherlock were very well able to take care of themselves - or that they at least knew the right people who could see to it that nothing happened to them. I did not like to admit it but in a way I was glad that Mycroft had such a big influence on his brother's life.
"That would not have been...", I continued, but then I thought of something better. "Many Thanks."

"Yes....?"
The door was pulled into the lock with a soft click and my visitor vanished. I could not help feeling that I had just ruined everything even before it had begun and I was ashamed to have made the headstrong and incredibly fascinating young cleric feel embarrassed or even angry with my thoughtless remark. I could only hope that I would have the opportunity to atone for this in the next few days.
I had spent almost an hour at his bed, touching him softly and murmuring to him but at some point I could not endure seeing him lying so helpless, even though I was deeply ashamed of the thought. Only when I stepped out into the empty corridor this feeling changed to rage - fury about being his only visitor. Where was his family? Where was the ominous brother with whom Prior Lambert seemed to be in contact fairly often? Slowly, I began to distrust the Prior - had he not passed on the information that Brother William had been taken to the hospital?
Well, maybe he wasn’t that wrong ...
“Better?
"It’s yours," replied Jonah, smiling, "As a small reminder of your stay here."
"You should really sleep now."
After my visit to Brother Jonah, I needed two things: rest and time for myself. Time to sort my thoughts and process what had been said. I decided to take the morning off, as everyone seemed to be convinced that I, as a doctor, was going to take care of the injured friar. I deliberately avoided the other monks and voluntarily took longer detours so I reached my room a quarter of an hour later. I managed to slip in unseen and pushed the door closed behind me. I breathed a sigh of relief and for a moment I thought about locking the door, but then it came to my mind that I was the only guest at the moment, therefore it wasn’t likely that someone would enter my room. Sighing, I dropped onto my bed and just stared at the wall for a while.
He held out the file folder toward John. John let Sherlock’s hang in the air between them for long seconds. At last he raised his hand to take the folder as he stood. “What’s this then?” he asked coldly.
"But how did he suddenly know who was behind the attacks?"
This voice was definitely familiar to me, only the speaker sounded strangely panicky, the voice at least an octave higher than usual.
The ambulance came and two paramedics stormed into the room, one of whom rolled in a stretcher. They immediately went into action, checking Brother William's vital signs, hoisting him onto the stretcher and pushing him out of the room, while I just stood and watched them - a role I couldn’t stand to play.
He hesitated for a moment before adding bitterly, "If you hadn’t been there just when you were, he would have killed me - and I would not have been able to do anything about it."
"Jonah, please - if that's true, we must inform the police immediately!"
He drained the glass in one gulp, then immediately fell to his bed.
The intensity of his reaction frightened me, so I decided to give him a good talk.
And oh, how I wish I’d taken up following him again immediately upon my return to London! What a lot of pain that would have saved the both of us. Instead, I chose to surprise him (and crash his marriage proposal) and ended up with a bruised windpipe and a nasty lump on the back of my head.
"Of course, Father."
The conversation we had afterwards slightly reminded me of my therapy sessions with Ella - whereat the serious difference was that Father Andrew listened attentively, instead of taking notes. Besides, he did not look at the clock again and again, also in clear contrast to Ella, but always let me talk. When I asked questions, he did not counter with other questions, but gave me a simple answer. Perhaps that was what I had ever been lacking in the doctor's office: Father Andrew treated me as a human being, not a source of irritation which could only be borne because he ensured the livelihood.
"Would you at least listen to me?"
The man, usually so unperturbed, hesitated clearly. Was it perhaps a bad sign, even though Sherlock was supposed to be over the worst of it after he regained consciousness? I tried not to let my uncertainty show.
One long, white finger stroked the ribbon before hooking it and pulling it free. Sherlock eagerly tore the paper to find
"The poison probably began to spread in your body when you got up and moved."
"What is it?" Sherlock suddenly asked me, startled, as if he feared that he had deeply offended me with his statement - which was not far from the truth. We absolutely had to talk about it before my bitterness took root.
"That means he knew about you and Jonah..."
"I've seen him looking at you - he looked at you over and over, he could hardly take his eyes off you ..."
Father Andrew, who had come in late, but as a novice master knew the brothers entrusted to him better than many others, shook his head with conviction.
I stared at him as if I could make him open his eyes, but the reaction was the same as before: nothing. I was almost ready to give up, but then the miracle I had been hoping for so long happened. Gently, almost tenderly, his index finger and middle finger closed on my hand. The touch was barely noticeable, he was so weak, but he was clearly there. I noticed a slight trembling of his eyelashes, as gentle as the wingbeat of a butterfly - a blink, and you would have missed that wonderful moment. As long as I could, I enjoyed the indescribable feeling that flowed through my entire body as I witnessed his slow awakening.
“Mary, there’s something I need to tell you.” His tone sounded somber to his own ears.
Sherlock nodded and stuttered out, “Thank you, sir,” as he followed Saul through the door.
Sherlock took a moment to scan the room before he moved. The furniture was of high quality and the Oriental rug that covered the white tile floor looked hand-knotted. With a jerk to the top pull, Sherlock found a drawer full of elastic and drawstring waist athletic shorts, t-shirts and white athletic socks. The second drawer contained more of the same, plus sweat pants and fleece hoodies - everything he could need except pants. With a shrug at that omission, Sherlock picked out a navy blue t-shirt and navy shorts with white stripes running down the outer seam of both legs. He carried them into the bathroom, then stripped and stepped into the shower.
“I won’t write you up for this. Consider this a warning, Sam. Next time, a warning slip will go into your file.”
"Outwardly not, no. And yet, without the permission of the Prior, nobody can just leave the monastery without fear of consequences. "
"Brother William," I replied, knowing full well that he would not be satisfied with this answer.
"I'm sure your supervisor will ignore it," I smirked, pointing to heaven, which gave the young man a smile. He looked sleepy so I decided to retire.
"You would choose the same. I know that."
A slight smile rolled around his lips
“Because it was
. You. Are.
"Come," Father Lambert interrupted  my thoughts and pushed me gently out the door.
As soon as the Mass was over, Jonah rushed to Sherlock and pulled him into his arms. Sherlock smiled and returned the gesture, but it was apparent that his limbs were not yet properly obeying his wishes. Excited, I approached the small group. How would they communicate with each other now? Despite Mycroft's appeal not to do so, I had told Jonah the truth about what happened to Sherlock because, unlike Mycroft - who considered his opinion the only correct one - I knew that Jonah could handle the truth. And I was right.
"It's the ear again," I whispered, handing him the handkerchief he had previously thrown carelessly on the desk. I looked up.
Again, I snapped out of my thoughts, so unusual it was for me to hear this man speak. He noticed it and began quietly giggling, a noise that sounded more like a soothing hum with him.
"The chocolates," he panted, again with slight panic in his voice, "Where are the chocolates?"
I guessed Brother William was in the library but I only found Father Andrew there, obviously preparing his next lesson. He looked up from his notes and gave me a questioning look.
- his notes would not start with apologies. He and Sherlock had both said their apologies and agreed that none further were needed. John wanted his first note to echo Sherlock’s tender words, not apologize for injuring him further. He opened a new document and began:
"I do not want to go to the hospital ..." His resistance had become much weaker.
Still stroking Sherlock’s neck, John whispered, “Oh, Sherlock.”
Mary preceded him into the kitchen. She leaned against the worktop and faced him. The bright morning light highlighted every line that time had carved into her face. “Well?”
“Say Anderson comes here.”
"I was so scared of you," I whispered, running my fingertips over his sinewy forearm. "Honestly, I still am ... And you could just take my fear away, you know that? You just have to ... wake up. "
... It seemed to me that this tiny creature knew exactly what was going on inside me; it sat very quietly on my arm and seemed to look questioningly at me. Did bees get used to the presence of the beekeeper? Did they even develop a relationship with him? And if that was the case - were they missing him? I only realized that I had started to cry again when one of my tears dripped onto the fabric of the glove. The bee flew away and left me alone in the garden, where I silently finished my work before crossing to the small extension next to the kitchen and carefully closing the door behind me. I could not allow myself to be distracted now, if I wanted to fulfill my task.
, but ... "
"Prior Lambert did that immediately after he was informed about the events. The investigation is already underway. "
John was grateful when a clerk approached him while he browsed the Reds and Blended Reds aisle. He explained that he was looking for a special bottle, but not too outrageous, to pair with salmon. When the clerk suggested an £80 Pinot Noir, John winced at the extravagance - especially in light of his recent months of only drawing half salary - but he braced himself and dug out his debit card. Sherlock was the one who knew wines, not him, but the clerk assured him that the wine would please even the most discriminating palate.
John winced at the confident tone of the message. Sherlock had been so sure he’d take out Moriarty’s network in a matter of weeks and return home quickly. John wondered what other countries had Sherlock had visited. He’d take out a map once he got home, and a Sharpie, and draw out Sherlock’s travels. He’d open every message and plot them with pins on the map. He wondered if Sherlock could even recall his wanderings. But of course he could – he was
Or so he’d thought at the time.  Facts had proven otherwise, but Sherlock had not been privy to those plans at the time.
Sherlock had hoped to slip out of the flat before John arrived home from his new job. He wasn’t in the mood for an argument and lately, any time he tried to initiate conversation with his husband, John took it as an invitation to nag and pick and start a row. He’d been distracted by a new
"He sometimes seems rather peculiar to outsiders who do not know him, and it certainly seems a little bit strange to people to get in contact with a man who committed himself to a life in silence, but ..."
Straightening his spine, Sherlock stood with confidence he didn’t feel. He smoothed the front of his shirt and pushed up the sleeves of the jacket he still wore, the one he’d lifted at the nightclub the night before - the jacket that belonged to the intimidating man before him. He faced the boss - Frank - as if he owned the place.
Sherlock shook his head. “I left my backpack at Frank’s office.” Under the pretence of scratching his ankle, Sherlock reassured himself that the cocaine he’d stashed in his sock the prior evening was still in place. Frank seemed not to have recognized his own shirt and jacket - but he’d surely recognize his coke if Sherlock had left it in his backpack and Frank had rifled through it.
“Everything I have is yours, John. You never have to worry about money.” Sherlock spoke soothingly, his voice low.
John felt the pieces of himself start to slide apart but Sherlock tightened his grip, his strong arm holding the bits of John together while he gasped and sobbed and tried to find the edges of himself. Sherlock didn’t go in for platitudes or empty comfort words - but the weight of his arm, the rhythm of his steady breathing grounded John and kept his pieces from breaking too far apart. Sherlock pressed his lips against John’s temple and breathed, keeping a steady rhythm for John while John fought to breathe at all. Finally John’s  hysterical laughter faded to irregular hiccoughs then after a final sigh, they lay in silence for a while.
The older monk shook his head.
Washing his hair with the toiletries he found in the shower stall, Sherlock came to a decision. He’d wait it out, at least for a few days. He could always slip away if need be, call his brother or parents, and be on a plane back to England in a few hours. But for now, he’d go along with Frank and try to find out more about his business dealings, and why his wife seemed terrified of him.
I faltered. I could not tell him that….well, could I?
"We're expecting you back for tea!" he shouted after me and grinned broadly, when I then jokingly saluted.
Sherlock had quickly deduced that his looks and skillful mouth could get him both stimulants and depressants. He’d put those skills to work, enjoyed every minute of it, and gone home at the end of the term a cocaine addict. He’d arrived at the military school a heavy user of recreational drugs - the ten months he’d spent there had fanned the flames into full blown addiction.
“Why should
"We were a couple."
"I'll see what the Prior thinks of the whole thing," he avoided me, knocking on the door. A soft ‘Come in’ came from within.
Without waiting for an answer, I pulled his arms aside and continued my work as he buried his face in the pillow. Brother Elijah appeared next to me with a bedside lamp and directed the light beam to the wound so I could check if there were any chippings in it - which was fortunately not the case.
