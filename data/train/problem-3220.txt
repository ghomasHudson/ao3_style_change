She slowly walked over to the table, not taking her eyes off the ghost. She passed the chair he was offering in favor of sitting kitty corner to it, on the side where two places were already set, “I can see right through you,” she said.
The ghosts started sobbing, and Sam threw his bottle to the floor, causing the remains to shatter, “What a sweetheart!” the tallest ghost moaned.
“Yes! I tried to protect you! All these years I sacrificed for you! but what would you understand of sacrifice, beauty, and honor!? You loved him!? Well damn you! damn you all to Hell!"
She was so caught up, that she didn’t hear the bicycle bell ringing behind her, until a boy’s voice hissed at her to watch out. Claire dove into a fence, staring in shock at the boy in the red jacket glaring at her over his shoulder as he rode up the sidewalk, “Henry, wait up!” another bike blew by, this one being controlled by a pretty girl with dark hair and eyes. She smiled apologetically at Claire, before hurrying after her companion.
“Well, take your time. Relax, I’ve got everything under control up here.” A few seconds later, Dean regretted that sentence. The dozens of tombs that lined the wall began to crumble as corpse’s began to break their way free, “Claire you’d better look faster!”
Sam considered his options, “Next Halloween, we dress like Frankenstein and the monster. You wear makeup, or it’s no deal.”
The ghosts in question were floating in a seated position above the small couch that had come with the room. they were each wearing glasses and holding a pad and pencil. Sam started to speak in a German accent, “Vell, vell, ze patient has finally arrived.”
Dean jumped up, “Honey!” he grabbed ahold of her while Gabriel snarled at her, “You’ve got that school thing, you don’t wanna be late.”
Dean allowed himself to breathe when he heard Jack scream, “Papa!” he turned around to see Castiel collapsed on the floor, with Jack and Claire hovering over his prone body, “Papa, are you all right!?”
Claire was shocked when, instead of making contact with a hard wooden door, she kept going. She fell, landing on what felt like just a pillow of very cold air. She looked down, seeing that same ghost that had been in her bedroom.
“Down here he could do whatever he wanted to. But no matter how busy he was, he would drop everything to play pirates with me.”
“Well…you know that tingling feeling when your foot falls asleep?” Claire nodded, not quite sure where he was going with that, “I think I’m made of that,” he didn’t have any other way to explain it, because he genuinely didn’t know. He just knew he remembered the feeling from when he was alive, and that was how he felt all the time.
“You are him, you are Michael! You must be!” Lucifer said as he appeared before him on the stairs. Cas ignored him and continued to run, with Lucifer showing up before him every few steps, “Can you not sense it? Search your heart, I am your one true love! And now we can finally be together! Don’t you understand? Michael, you must listen to me,” he begged.
That night, as Claire put her long blonde hair up in a ponytail so she could sleep, Jack kept popping up.
Eye of the Tiger was blaring from a black 1967 chevy impala as it sped up the interstate. Claire rolled her eyes at her father, who drummed his hands on the steering wheel, singing his heart out. They were on the road once again, heading to who-knows-where. She had literally been in school for a week, and now they had to leave again. She loved her dad, but this was just an awful way for a kid to grow up. Claire finally couldn’t take the noise anymore and reached over to turn off the music, ejecting the cassette tape, yes, her dad had cassette tapes, and tossed it in the shoe box with the rest of his collection.
Cas watched the innocent children with despair, before he remembered what Abaddon had said. He grabbed Dean’s shoulders, and turned him to face him, “Dean! I’ve figured it out!”
“What a little boy. And he’s so well fed, isn’t he? Nice and plump,” Sam couldn’t stop himself from screaming as Ruby kept pinching his sides, testing his body fat, “We could have shish-ca-baby.”
“Dearly beloved,” Roman began, “We are gathered together here, in the sight of God, to join these two men in the bonds of holy matrimony. Wilt thou, Lucifer Morgenstern, have this man to be thy wedded husband? To live together in the holy state of matrimony.”
The little ghost looked around the room in confusion. The ball hadn’t hit anything else, but it didn’t seem to be anywhere…
Claire and Jack walked into the room. It was beautiful and elaborate, but Claire honestly felt as though the room was sad. She was uncomfortable in there, and said, in a voice dripping with sarcasm, “Yeah…real homey.”
Dean gave a winning smile as he introduced himself, matching each word with a defensive strike, “Dr. Dean…Winchester…your…therapist.”
“If you want out, why…I’ll show you out,” Roman bent down to grab Dean by the throat. Dean gasped for breath as the spirit began to levitate until they were far to high off the ground, and dangerously close to the attic’s high window, “Now, for the last time; goodnight Mr. Winchester,” and without another word, he threw Dean out the window.
“I can’t croak him now!” Lucifer exclaimed throwing his harpoon behind him until it landed with a ‘boing’ in the far wall.
Jack stared at her, just for a moment before answering, “No. He’d never forget about you,” and he believed it. Claire was special. The type of person who would stay in your heart long after you parted. If you were lucky enough to know her and love her, your heart wouldn’t let you forget her, “Claire,” she sleepily hummed in acknowledgement, “If I were alive, would you go to the Halloween dance with me?”
“Sammy,” a familiar voice called. They looked up in shock to see Gabriel Novak. He was short and plump, with long, light hair and whiskey eyes, “Please don’t be sad for me,” he said.
“You better, Dad. But a single guy your age is more likely to become a hostage in a bank robbery than to make new friends,” Claire said with a little laugh.
Lucifer, the proudly middle-sized specter raised a brow, “Well, sure on a scale of one to ten, with ten being fun, and one being Sam,” the tallest ghost grabbed the rest of the donut out of Gabriel’s ghostly hands, and threw it at Lucifer, who skillfully dodged the flung pastry, “Yeah, we had fun.”
“I smell…children,” the three boys couldn’t help but flinch. The witches smiled and went to follow Ruby, “It’s a little boy. Seven…maybe eight and a half.” Sam flinched from his hiding spot behind the counter and tried not to cry. He needed to be brave.
“All the places up here are big multimillion-dollar mansions!” he exclaimed, excited, “This could be big!”
“What’s to forgive? You loved him,” Dean said. After nearly losing Castiel, he could finally understand why Lucifer had done what he did.
“Like…being born. Only backwards. I remember, I didn’t go where I was supposed to go. I just stayed behind, so my dad wouldn’t be lonely. And my uncles stayed behind with me, because they weren’t able to protect me. It was all my fault. If I had just gone home when Uncle Sam had told me it was time…if I hadn’t begged over and over for this sled. I didn’t need it. You saw my playroom, I had everything. I didn’t need anything else. But Dad just never wanted to say no to me. He was always determined to give me the best life possible, especially after mom died. And then, when he eventually died, he was reunited with me. I guess you could say it was his own unfinished business, so he was able to cross over. I’m the one keeping my uncle’s here,” Claire looked up in shock, “My unfinished business is the life I didn’t get to live. The friends I never made, the family I was never able to build. My life itself, is my unfinished business, and I won’t ever be able to cross over, because there is no way fo me to have that. And my uncle’s unfinished business was keeping me safe. They can’t leave until I do. I ruined everything, for so many people.”
“And what he sees in you, I’ll never know,” Roman sneered, “But that is of little importance now. The only thing that matters is that the master’s pain must end. And it will end, tonight. The curse will be broken, and we can all, finally, move on.”
Castiel smiled, a very rare smile and leaned towards the little ghost, “Cinderella wasn’t twelve-years old,” and with his message sent, Castiel touched two finger’s to Jack’s transparent head, and a bright white light erupted throughout the room.
“Come on, bitch.” Sam picked up his bag of candy and put his mask back on. They looked up at the house Sam had stopped in front of. It was huge! Not a mansion, or anything, but pretty close.
The truth was finally known, but Roman didn’t realize that with his confession, he had damned himself.
“Yeah. The witches are dead. My soul’s finally free,” he held out his hand to Sam, and the crying boy held it, “You freed me, Sammy. Thank you,” he turned to Dean, “Hey, Dean. Thanks for lighting that candle.” Dean nodded. A young voice rang through the grave yard.
“Come on,” Ben said, dragging his justifiably scared friend behind him up the driveway. They found themselves at the large front door, it looked enormous and daunting to the preteen boys. Ben swallowed hard and reached for the handle, silently hoping the house would be locked. After all, an enormous, potentially haunted mansion on the cliffside. It must be locked, otherwise it would just be a prime spot for ghost hunters, squatters, addicts, and all sorts of looters.
“Maybe we should just do him a favor, and put him out of his misery,” Lucifer suggested with his ghoulish grin, and Sam smiled.
He screamed in terror, and squeezed his eyes shut when he opened them again, his face was back to normal, but that image would never leave his mind. He told himself that he had just been seeing things and hurried out of the room.
Dean shook his head, frantically, “Dark spirits, I don’t want any dark spirits! Don’t you make those dark spirits come out!”
Dean ignored him and went stomping up the stairs to his bedroom, “I can’t believe you made me move here!”
Crowley, her (sort of) friend, glared at her, “I believe what the bereaved meant to express was that the sudden death of her last living relative has left a great gaping void in her bank, and her life, and Abaddon wonders what he has left her to fill it up with.”
Before he could talk himself out of it, he jumped to his feet and picked up the crystal ball. He opened the drivers’ side door and buckled the psychic into the passenger seat before turning the car on and backing up until he had a straight shot, “Hold on,” he warned.
“Oh great,” Dean muttered as they approached City Hall, “How are we gonna find mom and dad in this place?” they ran into the building.
Three cackles filled the air. The three boys jumped up, Dean forced Cas behind him, and held Sammy close in his arms. They looked up, the witches were flying above their heads on broomsticks, their cloaks billowing behind them.
As he was floating, lonely and bored, something on the T.V. caught his eye. ‘Dr. Dean Winchester, therapist to the dead.’ The little ghost thought it was funny, and decided to keep watching, “Are you depressed? Are you anxious? Are you lonely? Do you need someone to talk to?” Jack nodded at every question, “No problem…if you’re a ghost.” The program cut to the man in question. He didn’t look like any of the average therapists Jack had seen in movies. He was handsome, a bit scruffy, wearing flannel and a leather jacket. He honestly looked more like a lumberjack than a psychiatrist.
“Dad!” Claire practically leaped into her father’s arms, “Dad! I saw a ghost! It was a real ghost. A real live dead ghost!”
Ruby huffed a sigh when she saw the fire under the cauldron, “I knew I left this cauldron on. Didn’t I tell you? I just knew it!”
She looked at him like he was an idiot, “I’ve studied Latin for three years, dad. You thought it was dumb, remember? Said it was a dead language.”
Judging by everyone’s reaction whenever this place was mentioned, she was positive that no one would ever come to visit. Not before the Halloween dance, at least. But as she pulled the door open, she was very pleasantly surprised to see Alex, the pretty girl from school, “Alex? What are you do—I mean, hi.”
“Hi,” Cas muttered with a blush. He sat up and grabbed Dean’s clock, “Oh my God! It’s five o’clock! My parents are gonna kill me,” he stood up and grabbed his shoes, “I should go.”
Dean decided to interrupt, “Hey, hey, hey, hey, no need for that! Listen to me, I am going to find this house for you! I am totally committed to finding the perfect house for you, no matter how long it takes. Because at Winchester Realties, we want you to be happy,” before he could say anything else, his phone rang, “Pardon me please. Winchester Realties, Dean Winchester.”
“Well, this is a nice room,” he said. He placed the box he was carrying down on the bed, opening it to help Claire get started unpacking. The first thing he pulled out was a framed picture, of a beautiful man with messy dark hair, and the brightest blue eyes.
They finally reached a ladder to the street. Gabe climbed onto Dean’s shoulder as he scaled the ladder. Dean lifted the manhole cover and Gabe climbed out.
Each ghost floated over to the umbrella stand resting by the door, and grabbed a new weapon. They floated against the Doctor, prepared to fight.
Crowley disagreed, “This place is fabulous! You could do so much with it! I mean, it is a bit spooky, but you might be able to use that as a selling point...”
“Hmpf! Sisters!” she called them both to the cauldron, “Gather round,” the three took up sides around the cauldron, “One thing more, then all is done. Add a bit of thine own tongue.” As one, the three bit down on the tips of their tongues and spit them into the concoction. The cauldron bubbled and smoke rose high, changing into a sickly green color.
Cas knew that Dean had always doubted whether or not he could be a good father to Claire, always thinking the time he had missed when she was a baby would create an unmendable rend in their relationship. His self-doubt was something Cas had thought he would always be there to help his husband fight against. Castiel knew that if Dean hadn’t been there, he would never have been able to cross over, “What parent does? Dean, Claire is growing up beautifully because of you.”
Abaddon raised a neat eyebrow as the front desk worker finally takes her off hold, “Yes, I’m still here. Find me the number for Dr. Dean Winchester.”
“You don’t remember what school you went to; how old you were? Your favorite song?” He just shook his head, sadly, to each question, “What about your dad?” Claire’s father was the most important person to her. She couldn’t imagine not being able to remember him. It was as unthinkable as forgetting the memories of her Papa.
They realized they had insulted the wrong women when they found themselves in the old Demoniac house, hanging from the ceiling in cages. The sisters were panicking below them.
As she started towards him, Crowley picked up a piece of debris from the house…a broken statue head…creepy, and through it at the car, hitting it directly in the windshield, before jumping off to the side.
Dean smiled at the pair, “Well, Mrs. Fitzgerald…taking that into consideration, there’s only one thing left to do,” he walked over to his clients, and handed them a pen, “Let’s sign some papers.”
It was her father, “Come on,” he said, pulling her towards the stairs. They ran up and were just a few steps away from the entrance, and a frantic Jack when the door slammed shut in front of them. Dean shouted through the door, “Jack open the door!”
“They were up first!” he defended himself, “I already have your breakfast made, just let me go get it!”
“But that’s not him! That’s my husband!” Dean shouted. He didn’t like this man trying to use his husband to cover his own mistakes.
Sam flew up to Dean as he continued to ignore them, and started piling his books in a box, “What? So silent? NO pearls of wisdom today, Doc?” Dean just moved around him.
Jack ran over to his sister, and grabbed onto her arm, “It’s a ghost ball,” he whispered. The kids jumped back as the ghost ball rushed at them, before stopping and moving back to the door.
Meg shot up from the bed, “Trick or treat!” Cas screamed. Dean jumped and backed away. Ruby and Abaddon burst out of the closet, holding a shaking bag that sounded like Gabe, Sammy, and the book.
The witches flew out of barriers of the cemetery and landed outside of the gate. Once Cain had retrieved his head, Abaddon had ordered him to find the book and he had gone after the children, “While Cain is finding my book, we must start collecting children.”
“Well, hello little one,” Abaddon said, still in that disgustingly sweet voice, “Such an adorable little…child.” Ruby rounded the counter and grabbed Sam’s arm.
“Dead man’s toe!” Meg cheered from her place by the ladder, she started chanting the phrase while dancing over to her sister, she snatched a toe from the bowl and began to nibble on it. It was the witches’ favorite ingredient, and just so delicious.
Gabriel Novak jerked himself awake. He shook his head, it was too early. Outside showed the earliest hints of dawn, and the rooster hadn’t crowed…so why was he awake?
“The Lazarus,” Jack cut her off. The two looked at each other for a minute before Jack grabbed her hand, and pulled her to her feet. He quickly floated through the wall, with her running after him. At least, she tried to run after him, but was pulled face first into the wall. The shock caused her to fall to the floor and Jack came back through the wall, and looked down at her apologetically, “Whoops. Sorry. I guess we’ll just have to take the long way,” He pulled her to her feet again, as she picked up the long skirt of her dress, so she wouldn’t trip over it, “Hurry up, come on!” he shouted back at her as they ran out of the attic, “My dad hid it, so that no one would find it, but I remember where it is! Awe, wait ‘til you see it!” they were both so excited, and Jack was in such a rush that neither noticed Crowley and Abaddon sneaking their way down the hall. They heard what the little ghost said, and automatically assumed it was the treasure they had been so desperately looking for. They shared a look and immediately took off after the other two.
“If I’m not back in ten days, send a search party,” she sassed, before making her way up the stairs. She wandered down the halls, before stopping outside of a promising looking door. It creaked open and she turned on the light. Inside were three beds. One was extra-long and labeled, ‘Sam.’ Another was pretty average, labeled…’Lucifer?’ yikes. The third was much shorter, marked for ‘Gabriel.’
She pulled it open, revealing Mr. Lafitte dressed as a…vampire? A pirate? A Vampirate? She could only assume. And the student council holding decorations and food behind him, “We’re here,” he said in his Louisiana accent.
“Well, hello,” Ruby greeted, turning around before being hit in the midsection with as much force as Castiel could summon. She squealed and fell to the ground in pain. While she was getting up, Cas grabbed a frying pan from the wall and hit her over the head with it, knocking her unconscious.
“You hag! There are not enough children in the world to make thee young and beautiful!” he furiously declared.
“Wait! Wait for us! Hold on!” the family turned around to see Gabriel running towards Sam with multiple suitcases.
They were both so invested in the candy, that Dean didn’t notice who had come up behind him, “Dean Winchester.”
Claire looked down at herself in awe. The dress was definitely too big, but she still felt beautiful in it, “Oh wow,” she said, obviously impressed.
The ghosts snuck up behind Dean as he collapsed on top of the karaoke machine’s speaker. Gabriel was armed with a rifle, Sam with a broken bottle, and Lucifer with a harpoon. They slowly slunk up to him, and raised their weapons in the air, before hiding them behind their backs as he turned around.
“Daddy!” Claire yelled in fear as the corpse turned its head to look at them. Dean jumped and dropped the key.
“It’s no use! I don’t remember the ingredients! I-I-I’ve got to find my book!” she screamed running out of the room, Ruby trailing after her.
Claire watched. She was still a little nervous, but it was hard to be truly scared of little ghost in a chef’s hat, making her breakfast. And to be honest, she was a little impressed with his command of the kitchen, “Can you turn invisible?” she asked, curious.
Pamala had been showing the group Castiel and Lucifer. After that, she faded the picture and reappeared, “Hold up,” Dean said, “You’re saying the only reason we were brought here is because he wants my husband?”
Cas and Dean walked farther into the room. He most definitely did not scream when two hands fell onto his shoulders. Nope. It wasn’t him. Dean turned around and came face to face with his dad. His mom had obviously done his make up to make him look like Bela Lugosi’s Dracula. He made a pretty creepy looking vampire…Dean didn’t know why he was wearing pajamas under his cape and decided not to question it.
Dean just shook his head, “Some people go through life never questioning the norm. But you and I, we’re doing something extraordinary with our lives. We’re gonna make a difference.”
“Because you fool, we want to live forever! Not just until tomorrow! The more children’s lives we take, the longer we shall live.”
He pulled out a brand-new container, “Salt,” he announced, dropping the salt down to Cas. The blue-eyed boy read the ingredients, “What’s it say?”
“Yes,” Dean slung his arms around Sam and Gabriel’s shoulders, “You know, I didn’t think so at first, but…you guys are great. I love you guys!” he pulled Gabriel closer and planted a drunk, friendly kiss on the lips. He pulled away, and tugged Sam’s face closer while Gabriel spluttered. Sam groaned awkwardly as Dean pressed a kiss to his cheek. The living man released both of the ghosts, before grabbing Lucifer by the head, and pulling him in for a kiss, making the third ghost laugh awkwardly.
“Oh yes, I very much do. You see, we wouldn’t want anything to happen to the children now, would we?”
She hadn’t seen Alex, but she had honestly known she wouldn’t. Alex had told her what Henry planned, and that she didn’t know how to say no to him. Claire didn’t really mind so much. She still liked her and appreciated the honesty. Claire had assured her that she still wanted to be friends and would wait until she was more independent from Henry.
Dean smirked cockily, even as Gordan Walker, a guy everyone knew had a crush on Cas walked up to him, “Hey Dean…fat chance,” he said before leaving the room. Dean grabbed his stuff and hurried out of the school to get to his bike. This entire town had Halloween fever, and it was both annoying and difficult to get out of the door. Everyone was spraying silly string, or wearing a ridiculous costume that took up space and made it impossible to get through. He finally made it to his bike, and took off, trying to catch up to Castiel.
“Me neither! No way!” Gabriel sobbed as he tossed his rifle aside, ignoring it as it went off and shot a hole in the ceiling.
“Neither his father, his mother, or anyone else ever knew what happened to him those three hundred years ago,” Dean’s history teacher, Ms. Mosely, finished the story. It was Halloween, and he and his family had just moved to Salem. Apparently, the Demoniac, now called Demon, sisters were important to history, “And so, the Demon sisters were hanged by the Salem town folk. Now, there are those who say that on Halloween night, there is a black cat who still guards the old Demoniac house! Warning off any who might make the witches come back to life!” Dean had to admit, she was a good storyteller. She finished the story by throwing a streamer she had curled up in her hand in the face of a girl sitting a few seats ahead of him. He rolled his eyes when she screamed.
Cas gave him an appreciative smile and headed towards the curtains leading to the library. He smiled when he saw the blonde sitting with his back to the door, “Honey, it’s late, let’s not fight anymore. Come to bed?” he jumped back when the blonde stood up to reveal, not his husband, but Mr. Morgenstern, “Oh, I’m so sorry!” he said, face as red as a tomato as he accidentally knocked over a stack of books, “I thought you were my husband.”
“Well you explained it very vividly, Abi, the way you started out with the adventure part but then you slowly—”
“You had a mom?” Jack asked, genuinely shocked. He had only heard of Claire and her dad talking about another father.
Michael walked over to where Dean was still holding onto Castiel’s body. He gave an apologetic look before leaning down to press a kiss to Castiel’s pale lips. He pulled away before Dean could push him away, and said, “My gift to you.”
Cas wasn’t happy, but he didn’t argue. They looked around the hallway, which was decorated with real suits of armor. It made a very intimidating effect, and Dean didn’t really like it.
Castiel’s hands were shaking as he took the goblet. He never got the chance to say goodbye to his children. The last conversation he had with his husband had been a meaningless fight, and now…he was going to die.
When Castiel didn’t find Dean, he hurried over to the window and tried to force it open. He didn’t want to go back out there, and risk running into him again. He banged on the window for a few minutes, but it was futile. He couldn’t open it. He turned around to brave the hallway but stopped at the sight of the pale butler.
John breathed a sigh of relief, “Good,” he glanced at Cas and pulled Dean away from the crowd “Excuse us,” he said to the other boy, “Whatever it is, just tell me?”
“We are doomed. I feel the icy breath of death upon my neck! Ruby. Take me to the window, I wish to say goodbye.”
Gabriel glared at her and raised to his full, not very impressive, height, “Hey, shut up, Skin bag!”
“Have I missed all that stuff this month?” Cas nodded. Dean groaned. He knew he had been absent, but that was just ridiculous, “All right, I’ll tell you what we’re gonna do. We’re all gonna take off this weekend.”
“You’re eight! Go by yourself!” he started to bang out a Metallica song that had been stuck in his head.
“Boys!” Meg said, hopefully before something caught her eye, “What a pretty spider,” she picked it up and bit off some of the legs.
“I was—I was—I don’t remember,” Jack honestly sounded shocked, as if he had never thought about it before.
“It’s not dad,” John said, in an over the top accent, “It’s Dadcula,” he said with a flourish. John looked over at Cas. Dean had come out the year before, so he knew the attractive young man had to be a date, or at least, a want to date, “Oh, my goodness. Who might this charming young blood donor be?” he asked, kissing the blue-eyed boy’s hand. Cas blushed and awkwardly fidgeted.
“Oh, I want to play with him!” Meg growled out, hungrily. She sang softly, “Come little children…I’ll take thee away.”
“I don’t know…something’s not right. I’d feel a lot safer walking home if we had some salt.” Dean walked him down to the kitchen and opened the spice cupboard.
Dean walked into his office, deliberately late for the trio’s therapy session. He knew exactly how he would make the ghosts leave Claire and the party alone for the night.
Sam pulled a framed diploma out of the moving box marked ‘fragile,’ “Johns Hopkins University? Very impressive.”
The wind picked up, every lightbulb in the cottage shattered, one by one. Dean tried to hurry over to Sam and Cas, but the ground began to shake and glow with an eerie green light as he was passing Abaddon’s spell book. He was nearly knocked to the ground and Sam and Cas were forced to separate to find something to hold on to.
Abaddon searched for the potion, and saw that Dean had caught it and was threatening to drop it, “Give me that vial!” she demanded.
“Well…” Cas started, walking over to his family, “Some people have pools…others have private cemeteries…it happens.”
Cain shook his head out and looked at the boys. They all shared a shocked look before Sam, Dean, Cas and even Gabriel screamed and ran.
“Hey, if you wanna kill me, kill me. But when I come over to the other side, I’m gonna be kicking your ass for all eternity, so maybe you should read this before you stab somebody,” Dean said, pulling Michael’s letter out of his pocket.
Roman left the room to see Sam and Gabriel waiting, obediently. He scoffed to himself as he saw the protective hand Sam had placed on Gabriel’s shoulder. Love was ridiculous. It made these two so easy to control all he had to do was threaten to make one of them disappear. He had done it before with other spirits, and he would do it again if these two pulled another stunt like the one tonight. He glared at Gabriel, “Get him ready. And this time, any further acts of insubordination will be dealt with in the harshest of manners.”
Deciding not to think about that, she set about unpacking a bit more. The first thing she did was unroll her sleeping bag out on the bed. She didn’t want to sleep in it until they had a chance to wash the sheets. She could speak from experience, there was nothing worse than dusty sheets. Besides, you never knew what types of critters liked to take up residence in them. And judging by the sheer number of cobwebs that covered the place, there were probably a fair number of spiders living in this bed.
“Even better,” Lucifer said, reaching for the picture. None of them were serious. It was just another way to rile up their newest…intruder? Therapist? Housemate?
“Under her bathing suit,” Dean interrupted. It was their most common argument, “I know…our daughter is a teenager.”
“Yeah, that’s a good idea. We’ve been the ghostly trio long enough. I think it’s time to make it a quartet!”
“Are you the caretaker?” judging by how young the voice sounded, he doubted it, but it couldn’t hurt to ask.
She gave a deafening screech before realizing that she wasn’t drowning. She wasn’t even in water. She hopped up and down a couple of times, testing the stability, “Tis firm!” she announced, “Tis firm as stone!”
“Boring,” Cas said, honestly, “It’s just my parent’s friends, they do this every year. I’ve got candy duty,” he said, motioning at the bowl, “By the way, Sammy, I love your costume.”
Fortunately, something did happen. The vacuum caught onto whatever these things were made of, and started to pull Sam in by the face, “Not the nose!” he screamed as he was dragged through the hose and into the vacuum.
“I killed you once, I shall do it again, you maggoty mouthed heathen!” the angry witch threatened. Cain just scoffed, walking away with Dean.
“No, no, I can’t come back early. Maybe we should just take care of this on Monday? Fantastic, okay, I’ll talk to you on Monday,” he hung up.
He was almost exactly the same. The same messy hair, bright blue eyes, messy suit, and oversized trench coat. The only true difference was the large, black wings. And then he smiled, that soft, soft smile and said in that same gravelly voice, “Hello Dean.”
The two men froze before turning around. The gate which had definitely been padlocked was swinging open, as if of its own accord.
It was genuinely awe-inspiring, even with the signs of age and disrepair. The high walls were covered in a classic brocade wall paper. The chandelier hanging above their heads looked as though it was made from stained glass. The floor made up of red and black tile gave a fascinating spiral look. Two elegant staircases on opposite ends of the foyer tied the room together.
As Dean hurried up the stairs to tell the kids, he heard a panicked screaming. He raced up to see his ten-year-old son, Jack, come running out of his bedroom. The young boy ran into his father’s arms, screeching.
Ruby and Abaddon walked farther into the room, while Meg stayed put. She reached her hand up to the beam above her head as if she was looking for something.
“Well don’t! Nothing good can come from this book! Got it?” he waited until they nodded before going back to Sammy.
Recovered from the fright of his sudden appearance, Dean walked over to him, winning smile firmly in place, “Your grandfather had really good taste,” he complimented, “I’m Dean Winchester of Winchester Realties. Charmed to make your acquaintance, Sir,” he greeted, holding out his hand.
She walked over to it, and stared at herself as she tied the long sash of the dress in a big bow behind her back. Jack’s mom had obviously been a very tiny woman, so it fit rather comfortably on her twelve-year old body. The dress was incredibly stunning, and Claire had never felt prettier. It went all the way down to the floor, until it pooled in a pile of white lace around her feet. It was practically an antique. Possibly even from the early 1900’s. Claire had never worn anything like it before, “Oh, Jack, it’s perfect,” she said, very gratefully, “You think I could wear it to the party, tonight?” Jack didn’t answer, “Jack?” she looked away from the mirror and glanced around the attic, confused by the lack of response.
They didn’t know what they were expecting, but the respected adults of the town to be dancing like lunatics wasn’t it. Sam looked around, confused, and a little creeped out. He had Gabe clutched tightly in his arms, “I’m gonna look for mom,” he said walking away.
Gabe’s eyes filled with tears “It’s Anna!” he could finally join his family! He looked down at Sammy. The young boy had reminded him so much of Anna, and he would never forget him. He leaned in and whispered in his ear, “I shall always be with you,” he gave him a kiss on the cheek and went to his sister.
Dean locked his pinky with her smaller one, forging the unbreakable pinky promise. He gave her an awkward car hug, before taking off once more.
“Oh, I think it’s absolutely incredible,” Cas said, honestly. The normally stoic man was unable to keep the awe out of his voice. Mr. Morgenstern looked very pleased that Cas was impressed with the home. He went on, “The Italian influence, the renaissance vibe, the molding, the attention to detail, it’s stunning! You never see houses like this…or at least, I don’t.”
“You got it!” Jack declared, happy to be given a task. The little ghost hung up his chef’s cap and floated right through the wall.
Jack chuckled, “Yeah, but it saves on the heating bill,” Claire just raised an eyebrow, causing the ghost to awkwardly clear his throat. He floated over to the large kitchen table, and pulled out a chair at the head, “Come on,” he offered, ever a gentleghost, “It’s okay,” he added, seeing how she looked a bit hesitant.
While Claire was brushing her teeth, Jack was exploring the room. It really was the nicest room he had ever seen. There was a nice vanity with expensive looking bottles of cologne on it, along with a silver hairbrush. He opened one of the cologne bottles and inhaled. He liked it, it almost smelled like his papa. He picked up the hairbrush and dragged it through his brown hair. After setting the brush back down, the inquisitive boy looked around for something else to do.
“Okay,” he nodded, “Granted that you guys here in Salem are all into black cats, and witches, and stuff—”
Dean angrily got off his bed and glared down at his brother, “Mom and dad told you to stay out of my room!”
She finally felt brave enough to put down the dust buster, and so, naturally, that was when the ghost popped up.
“Smash it and he dies!” she held him by the throat. Cas knew what Dean was going to do before he did. He tried to stop him, but Cain held him back. They all watched in shock as Dean poured the potion into his own mouth.
“Come to mama!” they heard that same voice call out victoriously before the vault door swung open, revealing that same ghost, clutching a padlocked treasure chest in her translucent arms.
Dean jerked away from the trio, setting the picture safely on his desk, “But, we’re not here to talk about me.”
Cas’s jaw dropped. Everyone here was insane, “You don’t actually think I’m going through with this madness, do you?!”
“No,” Gabriel said, giving him a whack in the head, “I think it’s time we gave the doc our own prescription.
“Dean, I want to see her turn to dust!” before either boy could say anything else, a broken whistle caught their attention. Sam looked up to see Cas standing by their dad’s 1967 Chevrolet Impala, whistling frantically, and pointing at the car, “Never mind, let’s go!” he said, realizing that what the witches had thought was sunrise, were actually the impala’s headlights.
“Dammit Sammy!” Dean screamed at his eight-year-old brother who came barreling out of the closet, laughing.
“What I’m trying to say is, you should never be afraid. Don’t be afraid of anything! People are just gonna end up using it against you. I’m not scared of anything, I’m your dad, right? You’re my son, you kill that spider.”
Dean looked over at where she sat, sullenly staring out the window at the passing scenery, “Hon, I’m sorry about your science group.”
Every hand in the class shot up, with a resounding ‘yeah!’ that settled it. Now, they could finally get to work.
The three ghosts stood above him, each one armed with a sword. In unison, the trio said, “All for one, and one for all.”
Dean sighed but nodded. He didn’t really want his kids going down there anyway. He turned to his daughter, “Claire, stay out here with your brother.”
The impala sped down the highway towards the graveyard. They just needed to wait out the witches. If they could make it to sunrise, they would be fine. Dean pulled baby to a stop by the entrance and they slipped inside, just as the witches caught up to them. Dean had just breathed a sigh of relief when Cain grabbed him. The zombie had finally caught up to them.
“Gabriel! Watch the road!” he screamed, a little too late as a low hanging branch hit the driver and passenger. It didn’t hurt as Sam’s head and shoulders were brushed away with Gabriel’s scalp, but it felt weird and was a really unpleasant experience. He pulled the reigns from Gabriel’s hands, “Move over!”
That was until an arm broke through the top of the coffin. The zombie sat up with a grunt. He had long, stringy hair that was pulled back into a ponytail, and through a scruffy beard, you could see a thick black thread keeping his lips together. His skin was a sickly green-gray, but otherwise, he was remarkably put together for someone who had been dead for three hundred years.
“Mom, I haven’t OD’d, I haven’t even had a piece! They’re real witches and they can fly and they’re gonna eat all the kids in Salem! They’re real!”
Jack groaned, but stepped into the elevator, “This is against all my better judgement,” he said as the elevator began to move.
“I will,” Cas said, cautiously opening the book. As soon as the book was opened, a beam of light, invisible to mortal eyes, erupted. Its power went through the roof and shone far into the sky, “Nothing weird so far.”
Gabe shook his head, “Take good care of Sammy, Dean. You’ll never know how precious he truly is…until you lose him.” Gabe went to leave.
“Oh, I’m fine,” he answered, patting her head, “Why don’t we try to go to sleep, huh? I don’t think they’ll figure out how to get out of there for a little while.” Claire nodded and the two carefully helped each other down the stairs, both very shaken up by the strange way their night had gone. They could hear the three ghosts yelling from where they were stuck, but both decided they were better off ignoring it.
Claire was tired, though. When she was ten, it was a bizarre hope. Papa’s not gone, Daddy’s gonna find him. But as the months passed, and she saw more and more of how her dad was changing, she just couldn’t take it. They couldn’t work on healing together, because he didn’t think there was anything to heal from.
Abaddon snarled at her sisters’ idiocy and crawled out of the bushes, “Listen to me you fools! The magic that brought us back only works tonight, on All Hallows Eve! When the sun comes up, we’re dust!” she waited for that to resonate with her sisters before continuing, “Fortunately, the potion I brewed the night we were hanged shall keep us alive and young forever!” Meg and Ruby breathed a sigh of relief, until she continued, “Unfortunately, the recipe for that potion is in my spell book that that little wretch has stolen! So, it stands to reason, sister’s dear, that we find my spell book, brew the potion, and suck the lives out of the children of Salem by sunrise. Otherwise, it’s curtains! We evaporate! We cease to exist! Dost thou comprehend?”
He finally made it home, slamming open the back door and passing his parents, who were unpacking the last of the kitchen stuff.
“Dad they’re coming!” Dean turned to see the zombies only a few steps behind him. He blocked Claire with his body and continued to shout for Jack to open the door.
Dean already didn’t like these people, and their utter disregard for other people’s personal space was not helping the matter, “No, no, no. As with a traditional psychological cure, it can take weeks or even years for—”
Dean and Sam were actually pretty evenly matched, although Sam’s form was beginning to suffer the longer they fought, mainly due to sheer annoyance that this bone bag was lasting against him.
“Rich people,” Sam said, nonchalantly, “They’ll probably make us drink cider, bob for apples.” They shared a look and walked up to the front door.
The followed the woman’s voice. She was in a room with half-finished sculptures. They jumped in the room, ready to attack, but all they found was a tape recorder. The door slammed shut behind them.
“No! Cas don’t do this! Please!” he begged to no avail. The light was starting to fade from Castiel’s beautiful blue eyes. He had been too late. The truth was revealed, and Roman was gone, but his husband, the love of his life, his own personal angel, was dead. And it was all his fault, “Cas, please! I love you,” he whispered softly as Castiel went limp in his arms.
“…In your wallet,” Dean’s eyes shot up to hers, but she just continued, “Um, I was thinking that maybe I could use it to buy this perfect costume I saw in a store downtown?”
The cat scoffed and slipped through the gate, “Follow me!” they followed the cat past the creaking gate into the old cemetery, “Come here, I want to show you something,” he called, “Give you an idea of exactly what we’re dealing with.”
“Like my Papa. Just certain things. Like the sound of him making breakfast in the morning. The way he would always greet dad with, ‘Hello Dean,’ the way he was never able to tie his tie correctly. It was always just a little bit crooked. Dad would just say it was part of his charm. I do remember…the way he always smelled like he had been outside in the cold. His hugs were always so warm, but he would just smell cold. I actually love it whenever Dad would move us somewhere cold after he died. Whenever it would snow, I could just go outside, and breath in deep. It was like I was hugging him again…” she trailed off, lost in thought, before asking a question she was almost scared to hear the answer to, “Jack…if my Papa’s a ghost, did he forget about me?”
Seeing no other alternative, the family stood up and followed the pale butler out of the dining room.
Dean shook his head, “You can’t help the dead, honey, they’re beyond help. That’s the nature of being dead.”
By the time the witches realized they had been tricked, the car was speeding away. “He’s tricked us again!” Abaddon said angrily.
He wasn’t alive, but he wasn’t his normal ghostly self. Instead, he looked more like a sunny side up egg with a face. As if the reanimation process had started, but been interrupted halfway through. Egg-Jack looked at her, “Am I alive?” he asked, as one eye slowly slid down his face.
They moved behind what they were surrounding and Gabriel flinched. His innocent baby sister was sitting in a chair, surrounded by the witches. Her eyes widened when she saw him, but otherwise, she made no movement.
A hand popped out of the machine. A pink hand, with five fingers. It was followed by another, equally pink hand with the same number of fingers. Dean was alive. The machine had worked.
Abaddon just glared at her for a moment, “Come! We fly!” she led the way back into the house so they could grab their brooms.
Abaddon pushed past him and grabbed her youngest sister, “Oh believe me, thou wouldst,” they stepped off the bus without another word, “What is this?” Abaddon asked, confused at the sight of all the children running around with costumes. Ruby began to panic.
A knowing smile was his only response, and she just held him even tighter, thrilled over being able to finally hug her friend. The two were so lost in each other, they didn’t notice the other students stop dancing in favor of staring in shock at the floating pair.
“…the book?” Cas suggested, walking over to it, “The witches used it to put the spell on him, maybe there’s a way to take it off.”
“That’s awesome!” Sam said, he was a real history and mythology nerd, “And I didn’t know there was a museum about them!”
“Pardon the intrusion, Sir,” Roman began, “the master was wondering if he might have a word with you in the library.”
Claire gave him a look, “Good guess dad,” she said, sarcastically. The duo started over the bridge to the crypt.
He looked at his watch, “And I’m late for lunch, so if you’ll excuse me.” he stood up, and gathered his papers into his briefcase.
“Dean! Dean, over here! This way!” he looked towards the forest and saw the other boys waiting for him. He ran over to them, not noticing the cat following after him.
Because she had only just died, Abaddon was still identifiable, with her long red hair, floating loosely around her face, and her too much makeup giving her features definition. You could even make out a hint of the outfit she had been wearing when she died.
Dean smiled, he had seen the other boy blush. He let it go and held out his hand, “I’m Dean Winchester.”
Claire’s eyes widened and she jumped off the ghost. She ran down the hall, calling out for her dad. She found her way to the staircase, opposite of the one she had originally used and tore down them into the foyer. Claire couldn’t believe her eyes.
On Halloween, Claire cheerfully made her way down to the kitchen, “Hey Dad!” she greeted, startling Dean and causing him to spill a bit of the much-needed coffee he had been pouring, “Sorry about that,” Dean just waved her off, and she went to sit down next to him. She held up a blue credit card, “I found your Visa card.”
Mr. Morgenstern gave a soft smile, “Great care and love went into the building of this mansion. This house is my inheritance, my birthright, but lately it’s become too much to bare,” he explained, before finally turning to Dean, “Tell me, Mr. Winchester… do you believe in ghosts?” he asked.
“Wait!” Jack cried, floating up to a large machine, “It’s gotta be this!” he started desperately pushing buttons and pulling levers while Claire went back to look around the desk. With all the effort Jack’s father had put into hiding the machine, she didn’t think he would make it easy to get started. She moved aside some papers and looked under dozens of design blueprints, until she got to a book that she couldn’t move. She frowned down at it, before brushing the dust off the front cover. Her eyes widened at the title, ‘Frankenstein.’ What better place to hide the controls for the machine that controlled life, than the very book that first brought up the concepts of bringing someone back to life. She opened the book, revealing nothing but a large, red button hidden in the false pages. Bottles began clanking together as a loud, rumbling noise rang through the cave.
After Dean went upstairs to tell the kids about the lake, the phone rang. It was someone looking to sell their house. Cas quickly took down their information and listened to the young sounding man on the other end talk.
Abaddon snarled and grabbed Sam by the ears, making him cry out in pain, “I’ll get you!” before she could hurt the small boy, a black cat jumped onto her shoulder and began biting and scratching at her throat, “Sister Meg, get this beast off me!” she cried. Meg ran over to help her while Sam ran over to Dean.
Dean pressed a gentle kiss to his mouth, “I thought I’d lost you,” he said as he helped his husband to his feet. Lucifer walked up to him.
“Hold on, Sammy!” Gabe cried. The cat climbed up into a tree and jumped at the witch, knocking the potion out of her hand, and clawing at her face. Enraged, Abaddon pulled him off her and threw him to the ground. His head collided with a stone and he felt himself fading.
Claire set off in search of a costume, while Dean went back to his coffee, “Scream, or sugar?” Gabriel asked in a very hospitable voice as the other two laughed. Dean just rolled his eyes and continued to ignore them. It wasn’t time for their session yet.
Sam rolled his eyes, and kept the reigns, slowing the carriage down to a much more reasonable pace. He loved Gabriel, but the man couldn’t drive to save his life.
Dean looked between his daughter and the ghost, curious, but also not really wanting to know what was going on between the two of them, “We should get going,” he said, pulling Claire close and preparing to leave the room and head to the party. For the first time, he looked around where they were, “Um…where are we?”
“Ghosts?” Dean asked, “Sure, yeah, I believe in ghosts. I don’t think that’s a good idea to put that on the listing, though.”
“It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Morgenstern,” Cas said, with a kind smile, “And this is our daughter, Claire, and our son, Jack.”
“Where it happened!” Castiel’s eyes widened as ghostly figures began to dance around the room. He let out a small scream when Mr. Morgenstern grabbed his hands and looked him in the eyes, “Where we spent our last moments together, where we danced together for the last time before you…before you killed yourself! Now you’ve returned to me, and at long last, we can be together! Why do you not remember!? You’re my world, my life! And I have loved you in death as I did in life!”
“I guess they’re still at the party,” Dean shrugged, “Come on in,” he invited Cas, and they went upstairs to Dean’s bedroom.
There was a massive cemetery. It spanned far out towards the forest, with elegant tombstones as far as he could see.
There he was, just off to the side of the mirror, sitting on a sled. He didn’t look happy anymore. Instead, he looked very, very sad, “…I begged and begged my dad to get me this sled, and he acted like I couldn’t even have it, ‘cause I didn’t know how to ride it. And then one morning, I came down for breakfast, and there it was! Just for me, with no reason at all! I took it out, went sledding all day. Dad had to work, so my uncles went with me. Sam said, ‘That’s enough,’ but I couldn’t stop I was having so much fun. Then it got late. Got dark. Got cold. Lucifer wanted us to take a shortcut home, so I wouldn’t get sick. We got lost…Gabriel fell through a lake. Oh, God, Sam was so terrified, and we tried desperately to get him out, but it was too late. We finally made it home, Sam wouldn’t let anyone else carry Gabriel’s body. He never said anything, but I knew he blamed Lucifer, and Lucifer blamed himself. We were all soaking wet by the time we got home…and then I got sick…and my dad got sad…Sam followed Gabriel…and Lucifer couldn’t cope with the guilt of causing the death of both his brother, and his brother-in-law… we all left Dad alone.”
Cas bit his bottom lip, before placing his hand on Mr. Morgenstern’s arm and allowing him to lead him away, “Although it might be a bit worn and faded from its original glamor, this house was once filled with so many things…so much life! Grand parties, dancing, laughter! And above all, hope. Being a Morgenstern meant you were denied nothing. The world was yours.”
“In outer space?” Henry suggested, with a sneer. Claire could tell he already hated her, though she had no idea why. As the rest of the class chuckled at the oh so witty remark, no one noticed as an invisible source snuck around under the desks, stealthily tying their shoelaces together.
Claire turned to see the pretty girl from earlier standing behind her, “I had that locker last year,” she said with a friendly smile.
Abaddon’s red painted lips tightened into a furious scowl, “Don’t you get it?” she snatched the paperwork out of his hand, “Flipper got more money than me!” she shrieked before tossing the deed into the lit fireplace.
All he could see was three hooded figures huddled over something. There was the one with the purple cloak from earlier, another in green, and the third had a faded red cloak. He took in the large cauldron boiling over a fire. The place reeked of evil.
“Kill him!” Abaddon commanded, tossing him a knife. The zombie held the blade up and brought it to his own face, slicing through the thread keeping his mouth shut. Dean nearly threw up when three live moths flew from the dead man’s mouth. The zombie spoke.
Jack could hear his sister and father screaming from the other side of the door, but he couldn’t bring himself to go near it. Huge black spiders crawled through the cracks in the wall, and had covered the door, “Dad, there’re spiders everywhere, and I don’t have a magazine!”
“Well, hello Dorothy!” Crowley greeted, “No one goes without paying the toll!” Dean didn’t want to waste time on these jerks again, so he just threw his bag of candy at them and grabbed Sam’s hand, leading him away, ignoring Crowley’s call of, “Hey Dorothy, the shoes fit great!”
And with that, came the wrecking ball. If the ghosts wouldn’t leave, and the house was already condemned, then Abaddon figured she might as well just destroy it. Once the house and the ghosts were gone, it would be a simple enough matter to find the treasure.
Cas smiled. It was almost time for him to go, but he couldn’t resist touching Dean’s hair one final time. Neither of them had any idea that the last time they saw each other was the last time, and they wanted to use this final goodbye to make up for it. Dean clutched Castiel’s hand close to his face, before slowly leaning in, and pressing a last, heartbreaking kiss to his husbands ever so slightly dry lips.
An hour later, John called up the stairs, “Come on, time to go! The bewitching hour’s about to begin! Ah!” he pretended to scream when Sam came running down the stairs and “attacked” Dean followed, with his dad’s old leather jacket, and he had traded his Nike’s for his old boots, “Very scary,” john told Sam, giving him a kiss on the cheek, “What are you supposed to be, Dean?”
“Cain Adamson was the local beekeeper. He and his wife, Colette lived happily in seclusion when he caught Abaddon’s eye. When he refused her advances, she cast a spell on Colette that turned her into a monster. He had no choice but to kill her. When he went to confront her, he saw the sister’s practicing dark magic. Abaddon poisoned him, and sewed his mouth shut with a dull needle so he couldn’t tell her secrets, even in death.”
Dean stared at it for a few seconds, “Oh, yeah! I remember!” he said, before pulling on her finger while blowing a raspberry. The four adult ghosts burst out laughing while Claire sobbed harder.
Al couldn’t help but laugh at that, but he stopped after a glare from Crowley. He looked down when something caught his eye, “Woah…check out the new cross trainers,” he said, looking at Dean’s Nike shoes his mom had insisted he get.
And when the bell finally rang to dismiss the class, and everyone went tumbling to the floor, no one could explain how everyone’s shoelaces got tied together. Everyone that is, except for Claire.
Jack nodded nervously, and the two of them went back to the Lazarus. As Casper sealed the door behind himself, Claire took a deep breath, and went to pull the lever. The vial was in place, and there would be no more disturbances with Crowley and Abaddon gone.
“This is Crowley.” Dean could barely contain his laughter at the two idiots, “So,” Al went on, “Let’s have a butt.”
Her sisters cheered, “Well done, sister Meg!” Abaddon said with a little clap, smirking at Sam, who sat struggling against his bonds in the uncomfortable chair.
Jack and Claire shared a look that clearly said they thought their father was insane while Gabriel looked up at Sam, “The psychic! He saw the psychic!”
It wasn’t a comfortable sensation, but at least he was through. He ran down the corridor, barely registering Claire’s worried yells. He felt the ghosts chasing him until he reached the top of the staircase.
They had looked at house after house, and Garth had found something wrong with each one, “Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, that place I showed you over on Sycamore Street was loaded with plugs.”
After he had expressed his affection to his satisfaction, he walked away from the ghosts and staggered back over to the bar where he had left his bottle of whiskey.
Her dad was there, standing at the top of the other staircase. He was using a toilet plunger to fence with a ghost armed with a cane, and if Claire was being honest, he was doing a pretty good job.
“I’m free!” Dean exclaimed as he floated up in the air, “I’ve never felt so good in my life! I can fly!”
He thought he was in the clear, when he heard the terrifying sound of the studs keeping the carpet in place begin to pull free from the floor below it.
“Ow! He bit me!” Ruby whimpered. Meg cried out when Sam kicked her in the shin with all of his flailing. Abaddon ignored them and held out the wooden spoon to Sam’s tightly closed lips.
Sam rushed over to where Dean had fallen. His lifeforce was no longer surrounding his body, and he was slowly getting up. Sam threw himself into his arms, “I love you, jerk,” he cried.
“Yes,” Roman muttered, in an unimpressed voice, “Sounds wonderful,” he pulled a set of curtains aside to lead the way into the library, “Would you care for a drink, Sir? While you’re waiting?” he offered.
Ruby, however, could smell children. Not just smell them, she could sniff them out like a blood hound. Each child had a unique scent, and she could tell the differences in smells. And right now…she smelled two distinct children.
Dean watched the party from the second floor. He didn’t want to interfere, but he also didn’t want to be too far from Claire after his temporary death experience. He knew exactly who the strange boy dancing with his daughter was, but he didn’t have any idea how it had happened.
Before Claire could ask another question, a bell gave a small ‘ding’ as Jack’s reminder it was time to cook breakfast. He floated over to the stove, lighting a burner and donning a chef’s hat. He figured that this could be a good way to show off to Claire. Maybe make her a bit less scared of him. The less afraid she was, the more likely it was she might want to be his friend. He skillfully cracked an egg onto the frying pan.
“I don’t know, but I hope it’s not raining at the lake,” Cas said, glad he thought to wear his trench coat as he took it off and held it above his Claire and Jack’s heads. They were only wearing light jackets, and he didn’t want them to get sick.
“I found a lighter,” he said, grabbing the only plain one and dusting it off, he flicked it open to see if it would still work and held the light of the flame up next to Cas. The other boy flipped the switch and light filled the cottage.
“Hey, buttercup,” the driver said to Meg, who had moved to his lap and was steering the bus, “Anyone ever tell you you’re very easy on the eyes?”
“That’s it,” Pamela confirmed. He handed her off to Sam, who in turn, handed her off to Gabriel, who gently set her on a dusty stack of pillow.
Dean licked his lips and took a chance, “What about new boyfriends?” he dared to ask. Cas’s eyes widened, but he leaned in when the other boy did. Before their lips could meet, a crash came from upstairs.
He was about to lay back down for another hour of rest when he heard it again. A high-pitched giggle coming from outside. Even though he knew it was impossible, he looked over at his little sister’s bed. It was empty.
Dean sighed, knowing he was beat, “Fine. I’m not thrilled about it, but there’s no reason to say no. I’ll take care of Sam, Gabriel, and Lucifer, okay?”
Before he could say anything else, Roman, who had been standing by one of the many dining room windows, spoke, “The storm has swollen the river.”
Dean shrugged him off, “Yeah, well the old days are dead,” he shrugged Sam off his shoulder and ran up the small flight of stairs to the loft attached to his bedroom. He may hate Salem, but he got a cool room.
“Hey!” he called, getting their attention once Meg finally got the cat off her sister, “You’ve messed the great and powerful Dean, and now must suffer the consequences!” he pulled the lighter from his pocket and flicked it open, “I summon the burning rain of death!” he declared, earning some confused mutterings from the witches who had never heard of such a thing. He flicked the bic and held the flame under the sprinkler.
The three ghosts floated outside the door, laughing at the fun they were having at the expense of their newest intruder. They were almost impressed, though. Most often, all they had to do was show their faces before some new ghost hunter went screaming out of the nearest window. This one had actually stayed longer than anyone else has before.
“Anna,” he whispered, climbing out of bed, and hurrying out of the house, not even bothering to put on shoes. It was too quiet outside. “Anna!” he called. The only thing he could hear was a haunting voice, singing.
Jack watched, feeling the beginnings of a tiny crush on the living girl before he gasped, “Abaddon!” he had certainly never heard of ghost therapy before, and he was positive that this Dean Winchester was the only person who specialized in it.  Before he could change his mind, he floated into the television set and through the power lines to the only hotel in Friendship Maine.
There was time later. Time for Dean to talk to Claire about her Papa’s visit. Time for Jack to find the formula for the life-giving potion. Time for the ghostly trio to find a less destructive way to cope with their afterlife. But for now, it was time for them all to clean up the party. Just the father, daughter duo. The ghostly trio. And the one, friendly ghost.
Claire panicked for a second, turning to look in the foyer, hoping not to see any of the resident spooks. But there was Jack, floating harmlessly right behind her. And she knew that if the other three heard another living person come into the house, they wouldn’t hesitate to try to scare her, “Uh…no,” she stepped out onto the porch, pulling the heavy door shut behind her. She stepped just far enough forward that Alex had no choice but to turn and follow her, unless they wanted to talk back to back, “It’s so much nicer out here…out in the fles-FRESH air,” she awkwardly tried to explain away her rudeness, hoping she didn’t notice her little slip of the tongue. She turned back to her visitor and felt her eyes widening when she saw Jack’s head peeking through the woold door, obviously eavesdropping on her.
Jack floated out of the Lazarus to see what was going on. When he looked at Claire’s father, and then looked at Claire, her perfect face twisted in despair, he knew what he would have to do.
Abaddon turned to her captive while Meg and Ruby forced fed Al and Crowley candy. They needed to be fattened up. “Soon the lives of all your little friends will be mine, and I shall be young and beautiful forever.”
Abaddon sighed and got into position for the circle, Meg followed suit. They linked arms and circled gently while Ruby listed off soothing thoughts.
He had bought him a stuffed bumblebee on the way home as an apology, and after ringing the bell, held it up to his face. Maybe if he tried to be cute, he would get off easily. When the door opened, he started talking, “Hi Cas, my name’s Bumble. Your husband sent me to tell you he loves you very much, but sometimes he loses track of the time,” with that, he tentatively peeked his head around the bee, and hoped Cas would be smiling. No such luck, he had his normal, stoic expression. At least it wasn’t a glare, “I’m sorry I’m late… Happy anniversary,” he held the bee out like a peace offering.
Claire really did not want a repeat of what had happened in the attic, “Jack, no! Wall! Human! Stop!” he let go of her wrist at the last second, giving her just enough time to throw her hands in front of her face in protection, as she went flying through the wall. It wasn’t a wall at all, it was a secret door to the upper part of the study that was now her dad’s office.
Jack and Claire followed the ghost ball up to what must’ve been the attic. They walked past trunks, boxes, and a mannequin wearing a beautiful white suit with silver embroidery. There was also a painting.
“Don’t listen to her!” Dean shouted at the children walking down the street towards the cottage as Meg’s spell filled the sky. They couldn’t hear him.
“But everyone here knows,” he went on, “that Halloween was invented by the candy companies. It’s a conspiracy!” he finished as the kids around him groaned.
Dean walked over to get a closer look, “Yeah,” he laughed, “you could have one hell of a weenie roast in that thing.”
“Hey, watch your tone!” his father said. He was easy going most of the time, but he didn’t allow for disrespect. Especially towards Mary.
The program went back to the narrator, “And so, Dr. Dean Winchester continues his work, dragging his daughter along for the ride. This week, they’re in Lawrence, Kansas, and next week? Boo knows?”
He laughed at himself over how jumpy he was being, and turned back to the mirror, only to receive the fright of his life! His skin was rotted, and his teeth were falling out! He had one eye hanging from its socket, and a rope around his neck!
“Oh? But we are!” Ruby snarled and the witches attacked. They grabbed him and picked up the small boy. He screamed and cried for help as they carried him to the cauldron. Dean couldn’t listen anymore. He shot up from his hiding place behind the book display.
As Dean’s heart broke, the room began to fill with a soft blue light. The ceiling had opened up, and a heavenly light was shining down into the room as the ghost ball that had led Claire and Jack to the attic and started to help them uncover the truth slowly approached. The ball slowly began to change shape until it was in the form of a man. A man with black hair and blue eyes.
“Don’t be such a jerk!” Sam said, standing up and jumping on the bed, his werewolf mask barely staying on, “Guess what? You ‘re gonna take me trick or treating!”
A painting of a beautiful man with pale skin, blue eyes, and dark hair. And although it didn’t look exactly like him, Claire could only think of one person while looking at it, “Papa?”
Confused, Cas walked down the staircase, trying to find any sort of sign of where the man had gone, but there was nothing. Cas shook his head and told himself it was just his imagination. He turned around to head back upstairs, and nearly jumped out of his skin when he saw Roman standing behind him, “Oh, Roman, it’s you.”
“Chocolates, like they have in a hotel?” Dean laughed. Cas rolled his eyes, and thanked Roman, who left. He glared at his husband, “What’s the problem?” Dean asked.
Crowley and Abaddon waited until they were back out of the tunnel and in the study before talking about the vial they had stolen, “Do you have any idea what this means?” Abaddon asked, excited.
“Brave little virgin who lit the candle,” she said with a flirty look at Dean, “I’ll be thy friend.”
A sock was thrown in his mouth. Claire had tossed a pair of socks over her shoulder and somehow managed to hit Jack right in the mouth. He spluttered for a minute and spit it out, accidentally hitting Claire in the back of the head.
“Let me go!” Cas cried, tearing his hands away. He ran away from the spirits and away from the lunatic calling after him.
“The truth is that they just need help sometimes, just like the rest of us,” the doctor said to the camera, before the narrator took over once more, as the camera focused on the picture of another handsome man, with messy black hair, a subtle smile and beautiful blue eyes.
They hmm’d among themselves for a second. Should they, or shouldn’t they? They decided, as they usually do, that they should. Dean took their silence as refusal, “Didn’t think so,” he said, before turning his back on the ghosts. The three of them rushed around so they were facing him once more.
Jack would have gulped if he still had a throat. This was it. This was his chance to make a friend. If he could just manage to say hi. That was the best place to start. He gathered up all of his courage, took a deep breath and—
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist!” Abaddon growled out, as she and her sisters went to hold the door closed, “We’re just three, kindly old spinster ladies!”
Claire rubbed her face where he had just been, “You’re so cold,” she observed, trying not to shiver.
“No, I do not, Roman. The way I see it, you only go around the track once. So, do the entire thing, and don’t waste a second.”
They ran out of the school, laughing and cheering. Cas and Sam were dancing around and Dean turned to Gabe, “We did it Gabe. We stopped them.”
“The master is not well,” Roman said, in a hushed voice, “He needs to leave this place. He needs to move on. It is of the gravest importance, I assure you. Or else I fear the very worst.”
Cas led them over to a glass case that had an ancient book inside of it, “This is the spell book of Abaddon Demoniac,” he read the description aloud, “It was given to her by the devil himself. The book is bound in human skin, and contains the recipes for her most powerful and evil spells.”
“Let them go!” Dean shouted, going to tackle the ghost. This time, he merely went right through him, and fell to the ground in front of the trunk where his children were screaming and banging on the sides. He glared at Roman, “You’re going to let my kids out of here, you’re gonna take me to my husband, and you’re gonna let us out of here right now!”
Dean followed her voice, trying to see over the two boxes he was carrying, marked, ‘Claire’s bedroom.’ “This place is very scary,” he said in a spooky voice, while Claire rolled her eyes and tried to hide her smile, “Have you had any surprises yet?”
He screamed as a black cat jumped on him and scratched at his face, biting at his neck. Cas and Sam screamed, and backed away from the vicious animal as Dean fell to the ground and the cat ran away from him, “Stupid cat!” he called after it, holding in a sneeze. Of course, of all the animals to be attacked by, it had to be the one he was allergic to.
Lucifer nodded, before turning away to put some of the books on his desk “Yes, he strikes most people that way, but once you get to know him, you’ll find that’s not the case. He’s really very…” he turned back around and lost his train of thought as Castiel handed him the rest of the stack with a sweet smile. Lucifer shook his head, “He’s really very sweet. Thank you,” he said, accepting the books, “He’s been like an older brother to me.”
Dean shuddered at the incident, “Yeah, we can go there if we can avoid a repeat performance…wow… now that’s something you don’t see every day,” they reached the backyard.
“No,” Sam said. They heard a commotion at the edge of the property of the house they were at, and Dean cringed when he saw the two guys from the cemetery terrorizing some of the kids on the street.
“And do you, Michael Godson, take this man to be your lawful husband? To love and cherish in death, as you did in life?”
“But,” Pamala began seriously, “Do not be deceived. All things are not as they appear. For the curse to be lifted, the truth must be known! And for the truth to be known, you must find the key!”
“Because— “he stopped after realizing what she had said, “Hey now, don’t be tricking me, you Latin speaking thirteen-year-old,” he said with a laugh, “Step back, okay?” they had reached the crypt, and he huffed as he pushed the heavy lid aside. His face twisted in disgust at the rotted corpse lying there. He felt nauseated at the stench of death, and really didn’t want to put his hands anywhere near the thing. But, of course, the key they needed was clutched in the corpse’s hands, “Wonderful,” he muttered under his breath before steeling himself, “Excuse me for a second, sorry to bother you,” he said to the corpse as he reached down to work the key out of the stiff fingers. He gagged at the feeling of the rotten flesh, but finally managed to grab the key, “There, that wasn’t so hard. Let’s go back to your brother,” they started to walk away, “That gypsy had me thinking that was going to be hard, that was easy.”
Dean carefully slunk down the hallway back towards the room Claire had claimed as her own, the corridor in front of him illuminated by the single flashlight he carried, “Hello? Hello? There’s no need to be afraid,” Dean scoffed at himself, and muttered under his breath, “Yeah, Dean. That’s the idea, don’t be afraid,” he raised his voice again, calling out to the spook, “I would like to make contact with you, but just one little thing, please. Don’t go popping out of keyholes or out from under rugs, okay? No spooking,” he chuckled to himself, trying to lighten the mood as he stood outside the bedroom door, “I think we can get beyond that. Now, I’m coming into the room, now. I’m in…in the room. Can ya deal with that?”
The locker three down from Claire slammed shut, revealing the boy from the bike. Hector? Harry? Henry? Claire didn’t know, and she honestly didn’t care.
“En Garde!” Gabriel declared as he and Lucifer continued the fight. Lucifer smirked and shoved the tip of the cane into the Doctor’s exposed armpit, earning himself a whack with the plunger. Gabriel took the opportunity to try and use his umbrella against Dean, but the living man ducked just in time. The makeshift weapon ended up opening up in Lucifer’s mouth, causing him to go flying back as he tried to sort himself out. Dean took advantage of Gabriel being unarmed, and used the plunger as a baseball bat, sending the smallest ghost flying.
That evening, the witches were standing on the gallows with ropes around their neck. There had been no need for a trial when they found the body of what had been Anna Novak.
He had quickly found that one of the quickest ways to get home was to cut through the cemetery, but he was stopped halfway through by two boys.
“Dean, get out of the way!” Cas screamed at Dean as they approached. He held a very large stick, and was definitely planning to use it.
“Oh, Claire… oh, Nephie what have I done?” he looked down at himself, at the ghostly figure he had become, and he hated himself. This was never supposed to happen. He had just wanted to get the ghosts out of the house so they wouldn’t disturb Claire’s party. Instead, he had ended up dead, and broken his daughter’s heart, “Don’t cry, I— oh, please,” he hated seeing her cry. He couldn’t cope with it. It broke his heart every time. It was why he had picked up her toy for her on that fateful day he had met both of the loves of his life. He had promised himself he would never be the cause of her tears, and now here he was.
“It is their concern, Sam, they’re involved!” Gabriel’s smile disappeared as he shouted up at the taller man. Before either man could say anything else, they heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
Gabriel was watching all of this from the loft. He saw Ruby stop and scent the air. He was barely able to roll out of sight by the time she looked up at the loft.
“Geez, this is serious,” Sam muttered to the other two, “I think that Dean’s having one of those fleshy breakdowns.”
The boy had the softest looking, light brown hair with blue eyes that looked strangely familiar, and unexpectedly focused on Claire.
“Okay, good,” Dean cleared his throat, and looked back down at his papers, thankful they wouldn’t need to have this discussion. He cleared his throat before going back to the original topic, “You know that I would love to buy you everything that you want. But until Miss. Demoniac pays me, that thing is pretty worthless,” they had been in the house for about three weeks, and while the ghostly trio had warmed up to the pair, they still didn’t know what their unfinished business was, and they weren’t ready to move on just yet. They liked their afterlife. Unfortunately, Abaddon didn’t like that, and she was refusing to pay the rest of what she owed him until they had.
“Hello,” Abaddon said, mocking the voice on the tape, “I want my book!” they left the school, more determined than ever.
“You’re going to turn me into one of those fat, useless, contented housecats,” Gabe said, relishing the thought of finally being able to rest after being on guard for three hundred years.
Claire’s eyes widened as two sharp, noisy razor blades lowered themselves in front of her, clanking against each other as they prepared to give her a shave. She ducked down as far as she could, giving the blades a wary look. As she finally passed them, she was sprayed in the face with icy water, making her gasp as hot air blew out of vents. Thankfully, those last two helped get the toothpaste off her face as three combs, one on each side of her head, came down and combed her hair back. The finishing touch was a final machine that lowered a black bowtie around her throat.
Before Dean could ask what he meant, Castiel began to violently cough. It was the most beautiful sound Dean had ever heard in his life. He hugged his resurrected husband to his chest and rubbed his back until the coughing stopped. Blue eyes looked up at him, “Dean…”
Roman picked up a glass of wine and poured the same poison he had used to kill Michael into it, “From this day forward, you shall be joined together as one for all eternity. Until the very end of time,” he held the goblet out to Cas, “What God has joined together, let no man cast asunder.”
The father could feel his heart stop. Not his babies! He wanted to believe it was an empty threat, but he hadn’t seen his family in hours, and he didn’t trust anybody in this place, “You wouldn’t,” he said, quietly.
They gasped, recognizing the words from the deed. They were so close to finding this treasure that Abaddon could practically smell it. They stayed at the mouth of the tunnel, watching the children, waiting for any other clue of the treasure.
The boys watched in fear as the ground beneath them started to shake. Cas cried out when he saw who’s grave they were standing on. Cain Adamson, and that was the grave that was shaking, and it looked like a casket was rising up out of the ground. They jumped to the side, Cas and Dean shielding Sam, when the shaking stopped.
He fought her hard enough to make her lose her balance. The witch flailed helplessly on her broomstick, screaming, “Hallowed ground! Hallowed ground! Sisters!” Ruby went to help her, but Cas, Sam, and Cain grabbed the vacuum cord that was dangling behind her, stopping her in her tracks. Meg flew up to help her and pulled with all of her might. When the boys couldn’t hold on anymore, they let go of the cord, sending the sisters flying.
I have given it much thought to our conversation in the garden where we then talked at great length about our “secret.”
“Yes,” the group turned around to see Roman had entered the attic, “Well done, Mr. Winchester. I must say I’m impressed; you are more persistent than I ever imagined.”
“Dad, I’m afraid of spiders, I can’t kill it!” Dean rubbed his temples and knelt in front of his son.
Dean’s eyes burned with fury. There was no way this bastard was going to hurt his Cas, “If you put one finger on my husband, I swear I’ll kill you!” he took a swing, more than ready to punch this ghost’s face in, but before he could make contact, Roman had moved.
Cain gave a confused grunt before he realized where he was sitting. He turned around and noticed his headstone…that was inconvenient. He gave an annoyed grunt.
As the chair continued to move, she felt her leg hit a latch of some kind, and heard the crackling of long unused electricity. She heard bells start to ring, and a gust of wind blew in her face, startling her. Dim lights turned on, and the chair entered a different part of the tunnel, this section filled with strange machines. She flinched when an old, dusty toothbrush, covered in toothpaste was shoved in front of her face, and began scrubbing at her tightly closed lips. She allowed herself to breath when it pulled back, only to press herself far back into the chair as shaving cream sprayed in front of her.
“You said all I needed to do was find this key! I got the key, and now you’re telling me this story about a trunk!” he was furious. This psychic was playing with him, and his family, and he didn’t like it one bit, “’The key is the answer to all,’ remember?”
With that, the table finally fell to the ground. Dean didn’t waste any time to run from the room, and if he was screaming, that was nobody’s business but his.
“Must’ve been an imp,” Abaddon shrugged. She looked over at something next to her cauldron, “My darling little book,” she said, in the tone of a doting mother, caressing the front cover, “We must continue with our spell now that our little guest of honor has arrived,” she said with a glance at Anna before turning back to the book. She gently tapped the front cover, “Wake up. Wake up my darling, come along my pet,” she gave a delighted squeal when a raised bump on the cover split open to reveal an eye, “Ruby! Stir!” she screeched before going back to cooing at her book.
“Well, yeah, if you drink blood,” Henry piped up again, earning himself a slap on the arm from Alex.
Al hit the bag of candy he had been munching on out of his friend’s hands, “That’s cause you’ve been eating so much candy, you oinker!”
Jack had heard all he needed to and turned to walk away. Dean grabbed him by the collar, “Hey, where are you going?”
His heart stopped when he caught sight of her. She was giggling, following the hooded figure to a decrepit cottage. There was a plume of purple smoke rising from the chimney, and an unearthly green glow surrounding the house.
Back at the cottage, Ruby was trying to calm a sobbing Abaddon, “Would you like to hit me? Would that cheer you up?” Abaddon gave a lighthearted slap to Ruby’s hand and continued to cry.
Now, Dean was a simple man. He had a daughter he adored, a career that (shockingly) paid the bills. He was sure he was one step closer to being reunited with the love of his life, and now he had definite proof that ghosts were real and that his career was valid. Dean Winchester certainly had much to live for, and so he did what any person in his situation would do. He braced himself, and ran straight through the ghosts.
The red haired with looked out the window at the approaching dawn and growled out, “Another glorious morning. Makes me sick! Sisters!” she beckoned, closing the window.
“Okay, I believe you,” Claire smiled, “It was kinda cool to fly above the ocean like that, but when we go back, I don’t want to be upside down, okay?”
“Wench! Trollop! You hideous, murderous, firefly from Hell!” Abaddon screamed, enraged. Cain whispered to Dean, “I’ve waited centuries to say that.”
And as Gabriel, wearing a red dress for some reason, happily yelled out, “My man!” and rushed to give him a big kiss on the lips, Dean knew that it had been stupid to believe a word any of these three ghosts had to say to him.
“Sisters, we have been gone three hundred years!” she pushed Sam into a chair by the cauldron. The same chair Anna Novak had spent her last moments in.
Dean knelt in front of the trunk, and fit the key into the old, iron lock. He pushed the heavy trunk lid open, and rifled through the contents, “What am I even supposed to be looking for, it’s all junk!”
Jack pulled his head out of the floor with a happy little squeal, “She’s here, I did it! What if she likes me? What if she doesn’t? What would I even say to her? ‘Hi, I’m Jack! I’m a…ghost?’ No, that’s a total disaster. Oh! ‘Yo, I’m Jack. So, give me a four!’” he looked down at his transparent hand. He didn’t know why ghosts only had four fingers, but it had never really bothered him before. Not until now, that is, “God, I’d kill for a pinky,” he was pulled out of his thoughts by the lights above him turning on.
The three boys waited a few minutes before climbing out of their hiding places, Cas nearly gave them a heart attack when he accidentally slammed open an oven door. He looked at it for a second before turning to the others, “I have an idea.”
Mary didn’t know what to say. She just grabbed Sam’s hand and said, “Let’s just go find your father.”
Jack floated from toy, to toy. Each one he looked at brought a new memory back, “I know this,” he whispered, shocked. Hanging on the wall, was a small mold of a hand, labeled ‘Jack.’ He touched his transparent had to it, “I had five fingers! I remember!” this was his playroom. A place built specifically for him by his loving father. He had spent so much time in here when he was still alive, that it was no surprise that the sounds and sight of all his beloved toys brought back so many memories he had thought were long gone. Even the smell, though still slightly musty despite Claire’s best efforts remained the same. Jack jumped high, another memory coming back to him, “And wait!” he said, before floating out of the room, Claire following closely behind him, deep into the attic as he dove into a trunk.
Dean was not proud of the scream he let out, but Claire really shouldn’t have snuck up on someone who thought he was alone in a crypt, “What’s the matter with you?! You can’t just pop out of nowhere like that; you almost gave me a heart attack! I thought I told you to wait with your brother?!”
That is, until a glowing white light from behind him caught his eye. He turned around, shocked as a figure he recognized, and would always be able to recognize appeared in front of him.
Gabriel tore his eyes away from the witches and looked at the chair. His sister was stooped over, so he couldn’t see her face. He was glad. Her hair, which hung like a cloak around her head, was a dull gray. Her hands were wrinkled and looked like claws. She wasn’t moving.
Jack sat bored in his playroom, idly tossing his baseball up and down. He could hear the party floors below him, and wanted to go, but he knew that he would ruin the night for Claire if he showed up as a ghost. It would have been nice to show up alive…
He had been saying that for two years, ever since Papa had died. It had fueled him through ten different moves, the loss of his credibility, the mockery and scorn, and the constant insults. It was all worth it to him, because in his mind, every ghost he could help, was one step closer to finding his husband. His angel.
And as Jack powered down the machine, and the door swung open, the four ghosts and one living girl waited with bated breaths to see what would happen. Would the machine work, or would Dr. Winchester be doomed to remain a ghost forever?
“Let’s go,” Cas begged. Before the family could finally leave, Lucifer drew his ceremonial sword and pointed it at Dean.
“Yah!” he screamed, fully prepared to fence with yet another ghost, but this one seemed much calmer than the other three.
“It’s just a little dusty. We’ll get a cleaning crew to come in, polish it up. There won’t be a speck of dust,” Dean explained.
Crowley and Al had toilet papered the entire neighborhood and were trying to think of something to do. It was Halloween, and they were punks. They couldn’t turn in early.
Claire had found an old-fashioned pump, one that looked like what Miracle Max used in ‘The Princess Bride’ when Wesley was mostly dead, and shoved the end in Jacks mouth, using the air to get him back to his normal ghostly state.
It turns out, they wouldn’t need to haunt a pile of rubble. The ghosts were there to stay and judging by the way the construction men were running away, so was the house.
Flames darted up from the artificial candles with the shattered bulb. A fire sprang up in the fireplace and underneath the cauldron. They heard a cackle and went to hide as the door burst open, nearly hitting Cas, who was behind it, in the face.
Abaddon was the last to turn around. Her hair was as red as blood, and piled in an elegant bun on top of her head. Her lips rivaled her hair in color, and her skin didn’t have a single blemish. Her clothes were by far the finest, beautiful mixtures of greens and purples gave her dress a stunning effect. She looked in a small hand mirror, “Well…younger…but it’s a start!” she cheered. The sisters laughed happily as they took themselves in.
“Tell me why not? This whole thing was my fault!” he said, tiredly, “We should never have been here in the first place. We’re supposed to be at the lake. We could be sitting in front of a warm fire by now…I made us come here. And now it’s too late.”
“Didn’t he ever hear of caffeine?” she asked, as she ripped off the bowtie, and finally escaped the chair from Hell, “What is all this?” she asked, looking around the laboratory.
“Jump on!” he told Claire, motioning towards the chair. She hopped on, taking the beaker from Jack as he pressed yet another button, this one to send the chair back through the tunnels to the starting point.
“It just so happens that Halloween is based on the ancient feast called All Hallows Eve. It’s the one night of the year where the spirits of the dead can return to Earth,” Dean looked over at the person who spoke. Castiel Novak. Shy and smart, but gorgeous. The class cheered him on as Dean tore a piece of paper out of his notebook.
“Hey, she had me floating all around the room! I was strapped to a chair, floating around a room! I’m not going back anywhere! Forget it, Casper!” he said to Gabriel.
“How do I know? I’m not the weather man,” Claire said, sarcastically, before walking into the bathroom to brush her teeth.
Lucifer sadly leaned against the door. He could have followed, but maybe Michael needed a moment to take things in. He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Roman appear, “He doesn’t remember…” he choked out, “It can’t be him…” the thought broke his heart. He thought he had finally found him again.
He made his way into her hotel room where she was arguing on the phone with room service, “What part don’t you understand? No, not ‘I ate fish,’ I HATE fish. Don’t you people have cows here?”
“Well, now he’s broke, dead, and cursed. Nice move,” Dean said, cynically. He didn’t want to feel any sympathy for a man who wanted to take the love of his life away. They had gotten out of the carriage a few minutes ago and the three of them were trying to find the crypt while Sam and Gabriel waited for them with the carriage, “Watch your step…where are we? Where is this crypt anyway?”
A strange, glowing light filled the dark room. Jack looked on in shock as a man with large, black wings appeared before him, holding the missing ball out in his hand, “You’re…” he couldn’t believe it.
The tallest ghost rolled his eyes, and showed a pretty impressive ‘bitch face’ despite not really having any discernable features, “Well, well, well. It looks like we’re gonna go into sudden death overtime.”
“Now you have no choice!” he declared, “You have to take me!” Abaddon snarled and lowered her broom to the ground, hovering above it to keep herself safe.
Dean chuckled at his daughter’s sass, but agreed, “Twenty minutes tops,” and without another word, he walked down into the crypt. It smelled like death, that was for sure, but he could honestly say that he had never seen anything like it. There were dozens of tombs lining the walls, with a small bridge over the murkiest water he had ever seen. He looked around the crypt and struggled to remember what Pamela had told him, “Okay, what did the gypsy lady say…look for a crypt…look for a crypt…”
“Only the light will lead the way! Follow it and find your way home! Go Mr. Winchester, your family is at stake! Your life is at stake for there is no escape for you unless you lift the spell! Go! Save yourself! Save your family! Release him! Release us all!”
Claire sat down next to him, wanting nothing more than to give her friend a hug, but knowing she wouldn’t be able to. They sat in silence for a few minutes before Claire asked, “What’s it like to die?”
Most of the girls and even some of the boys stopped looking at their partners as a new boy walked down the staircase, dressed as a pirate in a white shirt, with what looked like genuine pirate boots. There was a red sash hanging from his waste, trailing down his black-clad legs, and a very real sword hung from it.
She hurried under the bridge and looked for the key the best she could without putting her head below the water. Dean had run off the bridge on the other side to keep the zombie away from his daughter and looked for something to fight it off with. He grabbed one of the torches on the wall and planted his feet. As the zombie walked closer to him, he started to panic, “Hey now, go back to bed! Back to bed! I’m Dean Winchester of Winchester Realties! What’s your name!? I just came cause I needed the key! The psychic told me it was all right to get the key!” he dodged as the corpse lunged to grab him, “Look! I gotta get the key, cause I’ve got things to do! I’ve gotta get my husband!” When the corpse lunged for him again, he swung the torch in his hand like a baseball bat and hit the rotted head off. The body stopped and fell into the water. Dean breathed a sigh of relief, “Next time you’ll think twice about coming back from the dead, won’t you?” he looked down at his daughter, “Did you get the key?”
Al turned to Crowley as the witches went to leave, “Ah, man…how come it’s the ugly chicks that stay out late?”
“But he can’t die, remember?!” the distraught boy shouted, “Wake up, Gabe! Wake up! Like last time!”
Claire had enough of waiting. She furiously pounded at the door, calling out for her father with no success. She had heard so many weird things, and just wanted to make sure he was okay. The blonde backed up as far as she could, bracing herself to try and ram the door open with all the force of her twelve-year-old body.
She took a deep breath, but decided to be brave. Her eyes met Jack’s foggy ones, and she held her hand in the air, palm facing the ghost in an obvious invitation. Jack smiled, and slowly reached out to her.
“No,” the ghosts said in unison, the very rare feeling they recognized as guilt started to sneak up on them.
Gabriel watched helplessly as what remained of his family walked away from him. He walked back over to the witch’s cottage, and vowed to ensure that the prophecy never came true.
The witches cackled at the prophecy. Charles shook his head and motioned to the constable. They wouldn’t tell him where his son was. The barrels the witches had been standing on were kicked away, leaving them dangling.
Gabriel led them to another headstone. This one read, ‘Here lies the body of Anna Novak; Beloved daughter, and sister’
Pamala ignored him and closed her eyes, “Dark spirits from the grave, come forth! Rip us from the black and show us! Show us the way back!”
Jack knew he wouldn’t have changed what he did tonight. He couldn’t be so selfish and steal Claire’s father away from her. He had been dead for decades, what did it matter if he stayed that way a little longer?
“It’s protected by magic,” Gabriel said, as if it should’ve been obvious. Dean sighed and closed the lighter.
Lucifer gave an apologetic and appreciative look at Dean, who gave an understanding nod. He now knew exactly how the man felt. He would do anything for Castiel to return to him, too.
He was about to wake his father when he saw his best friend and neighbor standing in front of his house, “Balthazar!” he called, getting the blonde’s attention, “Hast thou seen my sister, Anna?” he asked, frantically.
The inside of the mansion was magnificent! There was a double staircase above a darkened entrance to another room, lush red carpets covered the floor, and lit candelabras were placed every few feet to give a soft glow.
Crowley whirled on them, holding the crowbar up in defense, “Stay back. Keep away from me! Don’t come near me you spiteful spook, or I’ll knock you into the next world!”
Sam made himself at home on Dean’s bed. Dean knew the witches were dead, but he wasn’t letting Sammy out of his sight until morning. Sam was cooing to Gabe, “You’re my kitty now. You’ll have milk, and tuna fish every day. And you’ll only hunt mice for fun.”
“It would’ve been lovelier still, if he had ever had the chance to wear it. Now, it serves only as a dark reminder of what could’ve been,” he gave the suit a sad caress.
Castiel’s smile faded, “Dean, I know you’ve been searching for me. But there’s something you have to understand. You and Claire loved me so well when I was alive…that I had no unfinished business. Please don’t let me be yours.”
“Bye, Cain,” Sam said, “Have a nice sleep.” Cain smiled, before letting out a big yawn and falling back into his grave, “Where’s Gabe?” Sam asked, “Gabe?!” he called, before seeing the fallen form of the cat. He rushed over, crying.
“You’ll get over it.” Dean had Pamela lead the way to the trunk. He was getting tired of playing these games with her, and just wanted to get everything done with, so he could safely get his husband and children out of this house. She led them back upstairs to the attic, just past the painting of Michael. Sitting there, looking just like another piece of attic junk, sat the trunk, “Is that it?”
Abaddon gave a satisfied sigh when she saw the girl. Her bright hair was moving, as if it were caught in a breeze, and she was surrounded by a dull glow. The potion had worked, “Sisters, prepare thyselves. Tis her lifeforce! The potion works! Take my hands, we will share her.”
“Hey dad,” Jack asked Dean, “when we get to the lake, can I go to that pizza shop where I ate an entire pizza, and when we got to the cabin I threw up pepperoni? Can we go there?
Cas blushed, and grabbed some candy from the bowl, putting it into Sam’s bag, “I’m really into monsters. Werewolves, vampires, witches, you name it.”
Dean charged forward. What else could he do? His family was on the other side of that hallway. He managed to dodge the first two suits but was almost taken out by an axe. He grabbed ahold of it, pulled it from the armor’s hands, and started swinging. It got the job done. He managed to get past the armor and slammed his axe into the lock holding the trunk shut. As the door swung open, his kids jumped out and he pulled them into a tight hug.
Crowley leaned over to Al, “They’re very health-conscious there in Kansas,” he said, knowingly. The two boys laughed and crowded into Dean’s personal space.
Castiel held his children close as the fireplace seemed to go insane. They all watched in horror as a demonic figure came flying from the flames to pull Roman into Hell. Lucifer and Dean covered their eyes from the flames until it was all over. Roman was gone, and the truth was free.
If anyone has any objections…” Roman said, just for the sake of tradition, as Castiel put the poisoned wine to his lips. The door swung open as a few drops of wine spilled into his mouth.
“Sir,” Sam started, wanting to grovel, and beg for him not to damn Cas to this life. Roman didn’t want to hear anything. He glared at Sam with a stone-cold face and growled out;
Dean shook his head, focusing on the road ahead of them, “Oh, yes he is…he has unfinished business.”
Claire searched the house until she finally found a set of stairs that led up to the attic. If there was any place she might find a costume, it would most likely be there. The attic was, unsurprisingly, very large, and filled with trunks, and chests, and even an old wardrobe in the corner. She decided that she and Jack should look through these things. Maybe there would be something that would remind Jack of his life? In any case, it could still be a lot of fun. She loved looking through old things, trying to think of their story.
“Not yet! You wake my father, summon the elders! Go!” Balthazar went running back to the village. Gabriel ran through the field, ignoring the pain of small pebbles and twigs attacking his bare feet. Anna wouldn’t have long, “Anna!” he kept calling, praying his beloved sister would hear him. He ran into the trees and immediately tripped, rolling down a hill. He could feel his skin tearing along with his nightshirt. He finally stopped with a painful thud, sharp branches dug into the soft skin of his face. Groaning, he looked up, hoping he hadn’t lost sight of his sister.
Lucifer led Cas back into the magnificent dining room, which apparently, used to double as a ballroom, “This house has waited so long to have it’s shroud of darkness lifted. And tonight, for the first time in so many years, I believe it will be possible. The story will finally end. Castiel, do you believe that love is about second chances? About forgiveness?”
Cas smiled at the joke, but stayed on subject, “Seriously, look at this detail. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Meg turned around and shrugged off her cloak. Her formerly scraggly blonde hair was now cut very short, but looked beautiful. Her skin was pale and clear. Big brown eyes stood out with her sharp cheekbones, “I am beautiful! Boys will love me!” she declared happily, touching her newly rejuvenated body. She was scantily dressed in pinks and purples that would not have looked right with her old form.
Lucifer snatched up the letter and began to read. He could feel his heart breaking as he read Michael’s acceptance. He had loved him. It wasn’t all a lie. He was furious as Roman said, “Must we continue to listen to the ramblings of a lunatic?”
“Sammy!” Dean said, worriedly. They took off back up the stairs, Cas clutching the container of salt. They ran into Dean’s room, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Dean started for his bed when Cas grabbed his arm.
“Don’t worry, I know exactly what I’m doing!” he reassured. Sam merely held onto the seat as tight as he could. He was already dead, but he still didn’t want to fall.
“I’ve been there, thank you. I found it quite lovely,” she said with a laugh, before swooping in and knocking Cain’s head off. Sam cried out of the grave and went to help Cain find his head. Abaddon saw. Before anyone could stop her, she flew at the boy and picked him up.
“Abaddon, the deed’s in there!” Crowley said as he rushed over to rescue the documents. They could do nothing about the house, or the will without the records. As he frantically pulled out the folder, and patted the flames out with his bare hands, he examined the paperwork to ensure nothing important was lost, barely noticing the lone slip of paper that had fallen out.
