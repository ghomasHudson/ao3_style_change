The time on the phone: 17:00. Sunday, 13th of September 2020. Alarm reads: “TAKE PILLS!” A woman’s hand fumbles at the phone, and she groans. She unplugs the charging cord, picks it up and takes it out of shot.
Quick cuts as Sam slices a few open with his knife. BLOOD SPURTS from decaying flesh. Then Sam gets off some more shots with his gun...
“Dean,” Cas’ voice was gentle and he stood slowly.  “If you want to go, I’d like to go with you.  Or, really, I’d prefer we both stay here and you let me take care of you.  I know you’re upset and feeling vulnerable.  I want to help.”
So he did the only thing he could think of.  He stood slowly, moving quietly and purposefully, the way you would around a frightened animal in the woods.  He hated to leave Cas’s sight so he darted into his room quickly and returned with a King Size sheet.  WIth Cas lying practically under the table, it was easy to drape it over top and pull out the chairs to create a proper sheet tent.
He was intrigued.  He wasn’t sure if it was all the hunter crap his Dad and Bobby were always lecturing them about. How dangerous ghosts and ghouls were and to never try to hunt alone,  that Dean wasn’t old enough, hadn’t been trained yet.  If Bobby had his way, he’d never hunt.  He didn’t really think the tunnel was haunted, but he was just a morbid son of a bitch, and felt calm here like something called him to this place other people shied away from.
He still felt a little bit guilty about handling Castiel's belongings, and although he had looked at the photo for a while, it also reminded him that it really wasn't his place to look at something so personal without permission. It kind of made him anxious to think that Castiel probably had a set location for the photo within the book, not that there was much Dean could do about that. He hadn’t exactly seen where it had fallen from so he couldn’t even replace it properly.
Not only that, but Dean shouldn’t have even been daring to do something like this in the first place. He couldn’t use the excuse that he was scared because he wasn’t anymore. He was
and it would have been all his fucking fault if Castiel’s Grace - or whatever the reason behind his consciousness was - hadn’t interfered in time.
The boy pulled a face, but he picked up a case of El Sol regardless, continuing on down the aisle. "Dad lets me drink, so I don't see the problem with getting beer for myself."
“Do it. Please,” he demanded as politely as his anger allowed him, even though her answer had been fucking terrifying.
Well, he would try his best to make that clear through a mixture of poor spelling and potentially wrong vocabulary.
He didn’t particularly want to dwell on that though. It made his chest ache to think about Castiel hunting by himself at such a young age, and although he was undoubtedly interested to hear more about Castiel’s past, Dean imagined it wouldn’t be a very pleasant story for the angel to tell.
"I h-haven't even t-told him yet," the demon sobbed quietly and Castiel couldn’t help but pity him, the air catching in his throat as he went to voice some form of apologetic reply. He didn’t know how close the boys were, but clearly, that was the person the demon cared about most in this scenario. Castiel had heard the boy speak more of his brother than anyone else, and although it did have something to do with the healing aspect, Castiel wasn’t an idiot. The boy was concerned, and unlike his father, he’d actually ensured that his brother would have care by pursuing the safest option available to him.
But this was cute. Dean meant that sincerely. He’d seen Castiel smile, but the smile the angel shared with him was softer.
Bobby's chair scraped back across the floor but Dean didn't move an inch, the corners of his mouth pulled tight into a frown. He was desperate to get this conversation out of the way, but if Bobby wasn't at all in the mood to discuss it - regardless of how honest Dean chose to be - then maybe it was better to wait a day or so.
Dean rolled up the canvas bag hastily, locking away the papers and instruments so he could put it to the side and forget about it. They shouldn’t have even had a kit like that – it was wrong and terrifying, and the mere thought of an entire species being hunted down for some false misunderstanding really did make him feel sick. But that’s all it was: some utter idiot thinking that angel blood was more useful than the fucking creature it came from – because surely they would have thought to
He stumbled a little when the demon pulled him back in the direction they came, the basket knocking between the both of them, and Castiel quickly switched his hold to his other hand, smiling across at the demon apologetically when the boy turned his head, glowering.
He rummaged through his bag momentarily, drawing out the USB charger to connect to his phone before plugging everything in and staring down at the blank message that opened on his screen at the press of a button.
Dean nodded timidly as muffled conversation sounded below them, taking hold of Castiel’s arm to do what was asked of him. He didn’t particularly want to overthink it, and if Cas couldn’t pick up on anything else in the area then there probably wasn’t anything, right?
Dean looked away completely, stalling his actions, because as much as he would have liked to let the guy go, John would be fucking pissed. "I'm not even meant to be talking to you," he muttered. He didn't have another response. Not that he needed one. Castiel was a prisoner, and Dean didn't even have to answer to him in the first place.
No. He was content with what he could make. It was all far healthier than the few canned products he had left in the pantry.
! There was still so much left to read over too. Dean didn't want to stay sat fucking worrying about whether or not Castiel could turn him inside-out with a glance, and he
Sometimes he walked down this way with Rumsfeld when Bobby was too busy to take the dog for a walk, and sometimes he did get a little exhausted but he'd mostly put that down to Rumsfeld constantly tugging him along. He'd never actually tried walking the entire distance to The Roadhouse before though. Bobby had always taken them down in his truck.
Castiel pushed him again, stumbling back against the wall. "Stop saying that!" He yelled, toppling sideways and landing hard on his elbow. He ignored the pain, as he struggled up into a sitting position, staring up at the child through bleary eyes. "What the fuck is the point when you're just going to kill me? I offered you an alternate - I offered you a choice that wouldn't risk
But there was still a large part of him regretted going through with it all, more so when he took into consideration that he most likely wouldn't be thanked by Bobby for potentially saving his life.
Dean practically jogged back over, smiling softly in apology. "Yeah. Sorry, dude." He placed his hand on Castiel's right bicep. "Good to -"
want to go out and actually do something, but he couldn't imagine hunting in this heat would be that fun. Not that he ever found hunting all that fun to begin with, but he much preferred the thought of staying home and being able to use the heat as an excuse to be as lazy as possible. "What's he hunting?"
The thing was, Dean hadn't exactly kept much from Bobby. He'd been as honest as possible and simply left stuff out to avoid getting in worse trouble than he was already in.
Crowley held his stare, any feigned attempt at friendliness completely absent from his expression. "I'll give you fifteen."
Cas wasn’t glowing. He didn’t have any light around him at all, and Dean’s attempts to touch him hadn’t produced any kind of reaction whatsoever.
But then, he didn't want it to be too overbearing, because all Dean was doing was asking how Cas was holding up. It required, at the minimum, three words, and Dean couldn't even put them in the right fucking order.
It was a few seconds more before Castiel pinched the wound closed, and Dean clenched his jaw, looking off to the side at the first piercing burn of the needle cutting into his flesh.
He tapped the table with his fingers absent-mindedly as he glanced around him, heading off back toward the bar's front entrance when he spotted the sign to the left of it.
Regardless, he'd grown accustomed to life without an oven or microwave. He didn't need that kind of food to survive, and he would definitely benefit from something vegetable-based anyway. He needed to boost his strength as much as possible.
But the thought of staying with Castiel in a motel room again gave him something of an adrenaline boost, and he found himself welcoming the risk, along with the gentle warmth that pooled in his stomach.
been able to get back to a level of energy quite like this by himself. Not on his income, and especially not with his prior diet.
"Yeah," the boy said quietly, and Castiel looked over at him properly, taking in the frown and blatant disregard for eye contact which was fairly surprising given the near constant attention he'd received before.
After two days without receiving any form of reply, it did start to concern him, although he tried to tell himself that things were probably absolutely fine. He'd texted again with a message similar to the last, and he'd considered phoning when another two hours passed and he still heard nothing back, but he didn't really feel comfortable calling Dean up without permission. He understood that Dean didn't have complete free reign at his uncle's home, and he also understood that Dean was potentially putting family first and might not have been able to talk because of it.
It was such a contrasting experience compared to all the hunts Dean had gone on alone with his dad. Bobby - and even Rufus - hadn't strayed far from him at any given time, and they also hadn't suggested using Dean as bait which was pretty refreshing. Not that Dean was adverse to it or anything. He usually felt safe with his dad, but it was nice to actually be asked what kind of involvement he wanted to have this time around, especially when it meant he could keep Bobby and Rufus safe by letting them know just how much he had to offer.
Castiel let the comforter fall back against the sheets in a crumpled mess, some of the ash blowing further along the mattress from the motion. Maybe he shouldn’t be letting himself get so bothered over something as slight as a sprinkling of ash over the linen, but his anxiety was beginning to set in.
“Nowhere,” Dean shook his head and gave a small smile. “Do… uh, do you want to come with me tonight?”
“Sorry,” Castiel said quickly, pulling him back. “Looks like it was probably from glass…” His fingers were gentle, but it still stung as he pressed around the wound. “No glass,” he announced, finally meeting Dean’s gaze with a smile. “Once you’re cleaned up, I found some skin glue in that kit and we’ll take care of it. You should probably take an antibiotic, too, just in case.”
The knowing look she gave him told him she meant more than just the ones of Kelly. He’d resisted at first, Pittsburg was
It would definitely work better than the hunting knife as far as killing the Lifeless went… he sucekd with a bow and arrow, Sam was definitely a better archer. He looked up as Castiel walked over with a few of the books, his eyes trained on the weapon in Dean’s hand. Dean laid the machete down in favor of bending down to pick up a heavy-duty rucksack from Bobby’s stash, holding it open for Castiel to situate the few books. “Go ahead,” Dean prompted when he noticed Castiel’s gaze continuing to return to a bright-blue handled katana.
Now they were parked near a boat ramp in the parking lot of the Sheboygan Youth Sailing Center. The proposition to find a ferry wasn’t necessarily a joke, either. While the Hyundai Tucson they’d taken from Kelly’s house was definitely not Baby, just being on four wheels again and able to roll down the windows and feel the wind whipping at his face? God, Dean missed driving.
“Thanks,” he said softly and felt Castiel lean into him. The other man’s shoulder was warm, a comfort against the chill air and the wind whipping at them from the speed of the boat. They didn’t say anything else, just leaning into each other and drank their coffee as the sun continued to rise.
When Castiel opened his eyes again, he expected it to be because Jo had entered the room, and he was momentarily confused when he saw Dean stepping carefully over to him, a coffee in his hand.
Dean jerked backwards at the crack of his future self’s fist against Castiel’s jaw, Missouri a hard, cool presence at his back.
“That would be me darling, and please, call me Rowena,” the woman answered, her voice bright and welcoming, a Scottish cadence accenting her words. “Castiel Kline, I presume?”
"No," Dean shook his head, cutting Castiel off. "Whether I was meant to be King or not, it's not something that I wanted in my life. Balthazar approached me when his father fell ill and he offered me the throne. I declined, Cas. That's not the life me or my brother want."
“No, no, I’m early!” Dean interrupted, giving him a sheepish smile. “I was… kind of nervous, so I went for a drive and just ended up here. I’m sorry, I should’ve called first or something.”
Twenty-one was so young, and yet… Claire had always been headstrong, stubborn, and driven. Whatever she put her mind to, she ended up achieving. She was a successful artist, living comfortably off her oil and watercolor paintings, had bought a house in the last year, and was flourishing. Kaia had completed a computer engineering program and was in school for her Masters and she looked at Claire as if she hung the moon.
“Thank you,” Dean said after a moment, still tracing small circles into Castiel’s skin. Castiel looked up, seeing Dean already looking down at him, his eyes bright and shining. “For listening… for being here.”
“Thanks, Benny,” Castiel said in parting and together they weaved through the sea of cots and crossed the floor to the bathrooms.
“This isn’t real,” Dean replied, taking a step back. His hand moved blindly behind him, but John caught the movement and blitzed out of existence. Dean gasped as his back hit something cool and solid, the chains on his father’s body hissing like snakes as they lifted to wind around his outstretched arm.
Perhaps he did want to learn about his kind, and maybe there were angels out there that could educate him on certain aspects of his heritage, but Castiel had no idea who he could even trust or rely on for that kind of information - particularly if they were hunters too.
He hissed as he was lowered onto what he could only assume was a bed, causing Dean to stall on multiple occasions throughout the process, and Castiel brought a hand up to his face when he was finally level with the mattress, drawing in a sharp breath as he tried to numb the pain receptors all over again.
He pushed himself up onto his feet, dusting down the back of his jeans as he headed toward the dirt track entrance of the scrapyard. Part of him wanted to turn around and go clean up the ash he'd left at Bobby's table, but he knew as soon as he stepped foot in there he wouldn't be able to leave without arguing his way out again and he sure as hell didn't want that. It was rare that he and Bobby didn't see eye to eye.
Well, that, and Dean also hadn’t realised just how much he’d actually hurt Castiel by being an ungrateful dick.
This whole thing with Cas had completely blown up in his face and Dean couldn't deal with it. He shouldn't have been calling. None of this would have happened if he'd just sent fucking texts instead of giving in to his emotions and trying to get as much attention as possible. He was a selfish fucking idiot.
“I’m not jumpy,” he insisted, although his words were somewhat incoherent now that he had a toothbrush in his mouth. He elbowed Dean lightly regardless, stumbling a little when Dean shoved him back.
Considering the time of the day, it was still incredibly warm; the heat of the sun burning down on his bare skin even whilst he kept to the shade. That was one of the few disadvantages to living in this particular area of land: the weather was often drastic. Snow storms in the winter, water shortages in the summer, and just a general lack of natural foods anywhere throughout the entire year.
He’d probably been holding in so much traumatic shit that it had manifested as those twisted dreams over the years, and Dean really felt for him. Hunting alone couldn’t be easy.
Dean helped Castiel kneel beside the toilet silently, worrying his lower lip between his teeth when Castiel gripped the toilet seat with his hands, not seeming to care how sanitary it was, but Dean doubted he'd be fussed about that crap himself if he felt as sick as Castiel looked. The angel was trembling as he leant forward, his eyes squeezing shut as if preparing himself, and Dean was able to take in just how panicked Cas was. He couldn't even begin to imagine how the guy was feeling right now but Castiel was holding it together incredibly well for someone who'd been screaming in pain just a few minutes ago.
Even now it was drifting over his legs, given that he’d placed himself within its reach. His jeans were blanketed by the dark mass, yet there was no other feeling other than it’s subtle weight; but Castiel didn’t give it the chance to wind around his thighs in a grip, reaching across to gently jostle Dean’s shoulder to rouse him.
Sam's eyelids drooped a little, and Castiel could see the weariness return to Sam's form, Dean's arm tightening around the boy's shoulders. The two shared a glance before Sam was talking again, his voice lower and significantly less cheerful, and Castiel almost regretted changing the subject of conversation so soon.
"But he needs me! I need to look after him a-and I fucking can't!" The demon blurted, and Castiel froze at the first touch of the shadow to his thighs, the dark essence twining around his legs in a way that he sincerely hoped was unintentional. He shut his eyes as he tried to distract himself, curving a hand round the back of the kid's head to stroke through his hair, trying to calm him down before the shadow went wandering any higher. He knew the demon probably wasn't even paying attention to what his shadow was doing in the first place, but it still didn't help matters and it was starting to make Castiel feel more than just a little claustrophobic.
He leant in a little more, analysing the edges of the wound. The skin wasn’t knitting together like it had when Cas had been asleep back at the cabin, and Dean couldn't see any evidence of it being repaired whilst the angel was unconscious.
Dean was taking a considerably long time for someone who was going back solely to get a change of clothes. It had Castiel worrying despite knowing that Dean was able to replicate the tethering sigils, and he took in a sharp breath when he felt his blade slice his fingertips in distraction; the weapon clattering to the tabletop followed closely by the gentle sound of pattering blood.
"In my defence, I didn't expect it to affect me like this after I'd healed myself of all the others issues."
"Too late," Castiel replied, chucking him under the chin before flopping beside him on the mattress, laying back. "You're in a shittier place than I am at the moment and I'm gonna try my best to make it easier for you."
“Right,” Castiel mumbled, pushing the hair from his face. “Does it make more sense to clear the third floor or the first next…”
Hell, maybe if he'd waited a bit longer before contacting Castiel again he could have slowly convinced Bobby that everything that had happened, happened for the better.
“N-no, it’s got nothing to do with that!” Dean insisted, feeling his shadow writhe in irritation. “It could be like Sam though. He gets visions of full conversations all the time. If this wasn’t from a hunt, you might just be predicting something.”
Castiel tipped his head back against the grass bank of the spring, relaxing in the sun-warmed water as he looked to the trees. Most of the blossoms had fallen to the surface of the spring already, decorating the water with a collection of pink and yellow petals, and although Castiel was used to the change between the seasons affecting the scenery each year, he always favoured just how incredible the transition between spring and summer really was.
"Dean says the pain has caused you to fall unconscious before. Is that the only side effect or are there more?"
God, Dean couldn't even put it into words. He didn't even know if he should. It bothered him to think that he hadn't even been able to greet the guy yet and
There was the sound of the mouthpiece being covered after a beat, followed by a muffled argument that went on for a good few minutes. Dean could feel his stomach twist with unease the longer he was kept waiting, able to pick out a couple of Rufus’ snide remarks about letting Cas back on the property.
“No, seriously. You’ve got ages, and I’d actually prefer not to have to resuscitate you again if it can be helped.”
if he looked back to see Dean standing even this close - but Dean just wanted to say hi. That's all it was. Well, and he also felt the need to apologise and set the record straight, just in case Castiel did actually care.
Dean wasn't really sure what he'd do if things ended up going south though. There was no way he'd feel comfortable asking Cas if he could stay with him for a while, no matter how much he'd like to, and he definitely didn't have enough money to keep renting motels unless he started hunting on his own.
that Sam was sick with the amount they had to endure. But on his own, Dean felt nowhere near confident enough to hunt. Even this: the whole babysitting Cas thing had been fucking terrifying – more so after the fact that his dad had told him Cas needed to
“It’s fine. Honestly,” Dean assured him, feeling his face grow warm. “A-and it didn’t hurt. It’s like …” He paused for a moment, resting his chin on his knees as he tried to think up a good comparison.
"No, I ... I can't do anything like that. Well, I can send someone to sleep, but that's hardly ..." He trailed off when the shadow returned to his ankles, dragging along the hem of his jeans. Castiel rolled his lips between his teeth, squatting to place his empty beer bottle on the floor. "Dean, I wouldn't -"
“Uhhh, well, for starters, like I said before, her eyes get changed from blue to purple, but that’s ‘cos she gets, like, robotic ones instead, and it’s not down to genetics,” Dean began, chasing after the guy. “And you did that thing in the kitchen where you moved stuff without touching it – as well as bringing the beam down in the main room, which I still don't know how you managed.”
Castiel didn’t have too great an understanding on how the shadow worked, but he did know he could harm it if he really wanted to. He’d always just assumed that it was an extension of a demons form and it had similar senses, but given that this wasn’t the first time during the evening that he’d found himself blanketed by the darkened shapes without Dean realising, Castiel had started to toy with it a little, surprised that he could even interact with it at all.
It actually took Dean a moment to really acknowledge Bobby's piss-poor answer considering the warnings and the general comments he'd heard about angels over the last few weeks.
It had been days since he last bathed, and it was all he could think about: cleansing himself, dressing his wound, and hopefully getting a decent night’s sleep. That would be the ideal way to end yet another hellish day.
"That's not the point! This illness is affecting you way worse than it ever did Sam and he's been this way for
He knew exactly why he was irked, and perhaps he had come to terms with it fully now but that didn't make things any easier. Nor did it ease his worrying.
And it also meant that if he'd been feeling particularly low for a while, at least he could spend the night with someone and make-believe he was normal for once.
I'm healing," the angel practically snarled, pushing at Dean's arm with his free hand when Dean went to wipe the wound again. Dean used his shadow to twine around it, slamming Castiel's hand awkwardly against the wall to stop him from interfering.
"Gone," Bobby said, turning the page of his book almost as if what he was reading was more important than anything Dean had to say. "It's for yer own good."
on that note, barely catching hold of the angel's wrist in time when he went to put money in the machine, causing Cas to flinch a little. Dean wasn't doing it to be an ass, but he was becoming more aware of just how risky a situation they were in, and no matter how much Dean wanted to simply stay where he was, he didn't want either of them getting in trouble.
Castiel adjusted the angle of his head so that he could look at Dean’s profile. “No one else has ever touched it before.”
what you're concerned about?!" Dean cried out, his shadow splaying across the floor uncontrollably, knocking the table and chairs into the corner of the room. "I just told you dad wanted to do something
He just didn't realise angels could take it one step further and full on turn someone to dust instead. And it wasn't just limited to people. Angels could take life from animals, and nature in general, but they could get far more energy out of a human than they could a tree.
“You saying some of these are hurting you?” Dean questioned in alarm, causing Castiel to wear a gentle smile.
He took the receipt as soon as it was offered to him, offering the manager a tight smile as thanks before heading back to the room.
"Are you getting anything?" He asked, not really enjoying the lack of conversation. It was mildly entertaining to hear the boy talk, even if he did ramble on about pointless nonsense. He just seemed to be so enthusiastic about everything he talked about, and Castiel was amused by the excitement lacing his words in spite of the events to come, almost like the whole childish innocence prevented him from ever staying upset.
Castiel closed his eyes, attempting to block everything out. He didn’t want to eat, no matter how hungry he was.
Dean knew he'd made things awkward without even having to look at Castiel's expression. Well, he'd looked anyway and had been kinda used to the distant look in the angel's eyes, but it was just ... well, the guy had been smiling like, literally moments before Dean had asked about the whole family side of things, and right now, Dean was desperately trying to find a way he could smoothly change the subject.
Fuck.  Dean rocked his head back hard enough for it to hurt.  He closed his eyes to try and sort through all the confusion in his chest and the growing interest in his pants, but when he did, all he could see were bright blue eyes.  He knew he’d intruded on something personal, and he hadn’t looked away when the conversation turned from a potential hookup to something tender.
Cas wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and dragged himself up over Dean.  His arms caged Dean’s head in as he leaned down for a deep, wet, consuming kiss.  Their skin pressed together from lips to thighs where Dean wrapped his legs up around Cas’ waist, pulling his hips into a better position.
“Sam!” Cas scolded, looking indignant as Dean gave him a crisp slap on the ass.  “I associate with children,” he lowered and shook his head, clearly questioning his sanity.  He’s gone in a wave of swift air currents and clean-smelling snow.
“These are the old tunnels built in the 1800s. It was modeled after the churches in Barcellona, with the catacombs and secret passageways of the Inquisition. Of course, we don’t go in for that sort of thing these days,” the nun chuckled and Sam did his best
Cas licked Dean open with fevered heat.  He sucked and nipped at Dean’s rim, thrusting his tongue in as deep as anatomy would allow, but still not enough, never enough.
Dean set down his burger and stared at Castiel.  For a moment, he worried that the other man was going to give him some anti-religious spiel or kick him out, but eventually, Dean just smiled. “Yeah,” he nodded, “I like that.”
But Dean didn’t mean it.  He knew what it was like to not know a parent.  He lost his mom when he was four. He basically lost his Dad the same day.  Growing up with no real parents, Dean knew that story, and it fucking sucked.  He’d mostly raised his brother when they were with their Dad and even now since he dropped them off at their Uncle Bobby’s place when Dean was twelve and never came back. He’d managed to figure out how to act like a fucking human being. What was it that made Castiel think he could just say or do whatever the fuck he wanted, whenever he wanted?
Castiel shrugged again and pinned Dean with his eyes, locking him in place and refusing to let Dean look away. “That’s inconsequential.”
“I’m gonna just shower.”  Sam’s voice was thick, but his shoulders were strong.  He was gonna be okay, after a little time, maybe a little forgiveness.  If Dean knew anything, it was about how much forgiveness could change things.
“Those weren’t the only times my dad was a bastard, but they were the worst.  Mostly I did whatever I had to to make sure he stayed focused on me and left Sammy alone.  I tried to set that part of me aside, just not make a big deal of it.  I dated the prettiest girls in whatever school we were going to and my Dad would slip me a box of condoms before a date like he was so proud.  I had a few guys I liked, but I made sure to never bring it home or really do anything about it.  When my Dad left us here, it was the first time I ever got to even try to be myself without someone beating it out of me.”
“Most of it’s mine.  It started out with his, but as I settled in, I wanted to be comfortable.  Baz has an eye for great design, but it’s not always stuff you’d want to hang out and watch old movies on, you know?  I’d rather get in a viewing of Psycho curled up with a blanket than sit stiffly while listening to classical music.”
Only Sister Veronica was unaffected.  Dean watched in a daze as the woman rushed to Cas’s side and pulled him into her arms, wrapping him up against her chest as she screamed over the sound of his keening.  The bulbs above flashed and burst, and Cas looked like he was struggling in her arms, but that’s not possible because there was no way a mere human could restrain an angel intent on doing something.
on me when I was their vessel, and your crass attempts to hide the fact that you’re completely terrified for long enough.  You will not speak to me that way again.”
Castiel stepped closer, pulling the scarf from her hair. “I’m sorry to pull you into this. My arrangement with Sister Veronica has made some aspects of this situation difficult to manage.”
“It’s fine.  I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation.”  Cas looked back down to his notebook as Dean stammered a little, his whole equilibrium set up.  What the fuck does that mean?  Indifferent to sexual orientation.  Did that mean he’s like Pan or Ace or straight or what?  And why the fuck did he suddenly care so much to try to nail down that point?
Dean stopped talking, his eyes dropping from Castiel’s down to his lips. “You’re not what I expected tho, gotta admit.  And you ain’t no kid.”
“What’s the matter, Cas?” Dean asked, wrapping his arms around his angel, bending his legs so the other man’s body sank against him, pushing him further into the memory foam mattress.
The tears came faster and he had to hold the cloth to his nose to keep from blowing bloody snot bubbles as the enormity of his pain crashed against him.  He gasped as his stomach clenched like a steel-tipped boot had kicked him in the gut, but no, it was just him, his heart seizing in pain so absolute it wrenched through his entire body.
The kids though seemed to be having fun, and after a while, he was able to get them into having real conversations about their families, their lives, even God.  Castiel’s quiet, easygoing approach worked.  Kids brought friends from school to join them, and when he was out, kids would give him a hug or a slap on the shoulder.  It was a real connection he was forging and every day it filled him with a sense of rightness, of calling.
They ate in comfortable silence for a while, until Dean got up to grab a second beer.  He opened two and placed one in front of Castiel, who hadn’t had more than one beer in a sitting in years.  He thought better of it, but out here under the stars, comfortable with a snoring Garth at his feet, he gave himself permission.
Hehe, who wants the next chapter?  I know, I'm a little evil with that cliffy but the payoff will be worth it, I promise!
Millennia seemed to pass as he laid there, waiting for something.  For someone.  But he didn’t know what.  He couldn’t move.  Beyond his mind, he could still hear Cas screaming, both his angelic and human voice now.
“What do you mean?” Dean looks down at his body, eyebrows pulled together in critical concentration.  His gaze drew Castiel’s eyes with it, looking over the broad shoulders, the strong chest, the tight waist that pulled into a strong v between sharp hip bones bringing Castiel’s eyes even lower.
Cas. Castiel. He was the Angel of Freaking Thursday in his Heavenly Tax Accountant get-up and mussed up hair and stupid, backward tie. He was consistent. He was reliable, at least he had been lately, and when he hadn’t been, Dean understood. Castiel always tried to do the right thing even if he screwed the pooch in the process. It wasn’t like Dean hadn’t been in the same situation more than once.
“Isn’t it?  Isn’t it always time for you to show respect for a person you love? Castiel certainly was not a he when they were with me.  And you certainly knew it.” She gave Dean a stare that could wither a lesser man’s soul.  He finally was starting to understand all the jokes about nuns scaring kids for life in catholic school.
When he looked back over, Castiel’s eyes were locked on his and that feeling, like a lingering touch, returned.  Weird.
They stood there for one more moment, Castiel wishing he were anyone else, anywhere else, just to avoid the torment he knew would come when he turned away and went to bed alone.
“She’s the woman you’re posing with for the picture on your website.  Well the CJ Novak website, anyway.  What’s your middle name?  Tell me it’s Jabberwocky, please.  If we have a kid someday I really want to name it Jabberwocky, okay?”
“It served the purpose it was intended to.” Sister Veronica stood and embraced Cas, pulling him tight against her and the tension seeped out of him.  Dean watched as his eyes softened and his muscles relaxed in her arms.  Part of him was just thankful to see his angel alive and safe.  Another part was screaming to rip her off of him and take him into his arms, into his bed, and stake his claim.
She led the two through the sanctuary and then to a small hidden door behind the altar. Dean looked at Sam quickly and motioned for him to go ahead with his eyebrows raised. He sure as shit wasn’t going in first. He hated hidden passages and small dark spaces. Was this normal in churches? It felt like something out of that European Travel documentary Sam had made them watch, so Sam could fucking take point.
.  He strode confidently to a patch of grass and stood there with his eyes closed, wiggling his toes, his face turned up to the sun.
“Or lack of one,” Dean laughed through the thickness, trying to cover his body.  Fuck, he was going into shock, he could spot all the signs his dad had taught him to watch out for.
When Cas had composed himself, he kissed Dean, a hand on his hip, the other holding his weight, and began to move. He slid slowly almost all the way out and then back into Dean, filling him completely, thick and long.  Dean whined, the slow pace torturous, but no amount of pleading or begging got through.  Cas was intent on fucking him so slowly he died from his need.
“Actually, I slept fine. Maybe one night of decent sleep just showed me how bad I needed it. Besides, I’ll sleep when I die. That’s how it works.” He nodded his head to the phone in Sam’s hand, “Just go back to flirting with Eileen.”
“Okay, let’s try this another way.  I’ll stay.  I’ll stay until you tell me to go, but you tell me why you aren’t eating.”
“Yes,” Cas whispered into Dean’s mouth, now using both hands to quickly undo Dean’s jeans.  He shoved them, and Dean’s underwear, down as far as he could before Dean took over and kicked them off.  Cas pulled his hands back to undo his belt and pull his dress pants off, careful to never dislodge his lips from Dean’s.
“Yeah, looks like he got you good,” Dean ran a hand lovingly over the dog’s head.  “He’s an Irish Wolf Hound, great for hunting and good company out here all alone, but he has no idea how big he is, and it would just break my heart to tell ‘im.”
“No,” Sister Veronica replied without inflection as she dipped more bread in honey for the crazed angel.
Cas chuckled and crossed his arms over his chest.  “I never really came out.  Everyone just kind of knew, most of them before I really knew what they were talking about.  My brothers all teased me about not dating their friends and my parents were both gone by the time I was ten.  I was lucky that the church we went to didn’t care or make a big deal out of it.  It was kind of a non-event.”
Castiel shook his head and placed his hands on the incredibly biteable inner thigh.  His shorts had ridden up and Castiel could see the way the muscles jumped at his touch.
“We’ve never spent time together before. You aren’t actually friends with me. You just want to solve me like a Rubix Cube or a crossword puzzle.” He looked down at his still hands lying on his lap.  “I should go to Meg’s.”  Anyone else would be bouncing a leg or wringing their hands, but not Cas, even in the face of admitting fear of outright social rejection.
Dean reached out and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, man.  You can always stay here if you need a night out of there.  I’ll give you my number so you can text and I’ll come get you.”
What made it all worse was that at least once a day, the man caught Castiel staring.  His blush was hidden by the red in his face from running, but he had practically fallen off the treadmill the first time the man winked at him.  Fucking
Nimble fingers dragged along the exposed skin at Cas’ collar and then down the unbuttoned v of tanned skin.  Dean’s fingers shook slightly when he tried to undo the first button.  He laughed and pulled away, embarrassed.
Castiel laughed, a real one this time that broke down all of his professional barriers and left him raw. Dean did something to him, he was impossible to resist in a way Castiel had never encountered before. The man made him say and want to do crazy things. “That’s never happened, I’m afraid. But then again, I’ve never tried using my tongue.”
Her head whipped to Dean and the strict composure that made her one scary-ass nun fell into place. “Dean Winchester, I have put up with your language, you misgendering of Castiel, your
“You broke it.  The fibula is definitely broken, I can see it poking out of the skin, but I’m not sure about the tibula.
Hmmm, Cas tilted his head to the side and Dean noticed how his shoulders had fallen and the pain in his eyes had diminished.  Whatever Cas wanted to know, Dean would tell him.  He’d sing fucking dixie if it kept that terrifying detached look from ever returning.
You guys.  You guys!  This chapter is so chock full of so much and writing it was like an exercise in how to do all the things at once.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Did you like the kiss?  Isn't Charlie awesome?  Did you expect John to show up?
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes.  Sam could be so fucking stupid sometimes.  “That’s ridiculous.  I haven’t just been de-possessed or whatever.  Demon detox?  I don’t know, but you need to sleep because pretty soon we’re going to need to get back to it and fight.”
“I don’t know, Sam. I mean, we live with the guy. We share all this history and trauma and so many betrayals, us as much as him, and he doesn’t tell us about this? Why? What about this couldn’t he just tell us?”
“So you took off all your clothes…” Castiel quirked a smile, unable to resist the combination of defensive and horrified embarrassment wafting off his patient.
Castiel ran a hand down the side of Dean’s face; the beard was thicker than it had been yesterday.  He scratched his dull nails into the hair.  “I like this,” he said, stroking it again before running his thumb along Dean’s lower lip.
Castiel sat on the couch next to Dean and pulled his feet up under him, so he was sitting cross-legged.
“Don’t you, ah, want to—you know—take care of you?” Dean felt his cheeks heat and the smile on Cas’s face told him he was blushing.  He could feel the hardness of Cas’ desire against his hip and reached down, running a hand over his hip and tracing fingers between them.
“But now,” Cas kissed down Dean’s asscheek and blew hot breath against Dean’s hole, making it flutter with need.  “To have been without you and have you back—Dean, you are such a gift.  I love you so.”
Dean sent up a hope, a prayer, whatever, that Cas was around because he had no fucking idea what was going on.
Dean kissed his way down Cas’s chest, dipping his tongue into his bellybutton, gripping the angel’s hip bones.  He licked his way lower, shoving the pants down as far as he could reach, letting them pool on the floor on their own.  He nosed his way through the curls of Cas’s thatch of hair, enjoying the muskier scent.  He licked a line from one hip to the base of Cas’s cock.
“Clarence?” Meg pulled away from Benny and ran into Cas’s arms.  “Why is he here?  How did he find me.”
Cas ran one hand down Dean’s face as he pulled back, looking down at him with white glowing eyes and a well-timed head tilt.
The heat of Cas’ cock, his perfect, thick—and, frankly, larger than Dean remembered—cock stole Dean’s breath.  He squeezed gently, running his thumb over the tip as he hummed with anticipation.
Castiel stepped in and let the water simultaneously beat on his chest and back, heat relaxing the muscles that had cramped from his long ridiculous walk.  The stress of moving across the country to a place he’d never been to live with a person he’d never even spoken to drifted away into nothingness.  All that existed at this moment was the steam of the shower.
Dean teased out Cas’s tongue, kissing and nibbling on his lips until he was rewarded with a blistering kiss that left his head swimming and his body throbbing with need.
Dean started the car back up and pulled out of the drive and out to the main road.  “So where to?” He asked, peeking over to where Cas had his arm around Meg.  Something twisted inside him but he ignored it.  Seemed like he was ignoring a lot of things when it came to Cas lately.
Castiel licked the honey with a moan.  They held it with both hands, eyes fluttering closed as they took a bite of the fresh bread with the sweet topping.
“Dean,” Sam placed a hand on his bicep. “Maybe she’s right.  I need to stitch up my arm and you need a shower.  Cas will be back.  He always comes back eventually.”
He barely knew Meg.  Had had maybe three conversations with her during all of high school before this week.  But she and Castiel were a package deal, and whatever Cas saw in her, Dean trusted. If she was Cas’s friend, she was his and he took that shit seriously.  Unlike the people he usually called friends who had all abandoned him and didn’t have the empathy to even care Meg was upset.
He had a few welts blooming but for the most part didn’t look like the picture Missouri had painted. If anything, he was really attractive—until he started bouncing on his toes and whining.
He was finally close enough to get a look at his new landlord/roommate.  The man stood a few inches taller than him and dressed like a lumberjack.  Stained and ripped jeans, a T-shirt with a flannel thrown over it with the sleeves rolled up.  He had a full beard and hair a little too long, but not unattractively so.  They appeared to be about the same age, despite the fact that Dean apparently owned all this land and the house while Castiel didn’t own anything he hadn’t carried here with him.  He was strong; you could see it in the strength of his jaw and the taut muscles of his forearms, but not vanity strong, not gym strong.  Dean was strong like a boxer, like a fighter, like someone who was good with his hands.  Castiel had to look away.
“What crawled up your ass?” Dean shot at him as he pulled out of the parking lot and headed toward Bobby’s.  He still couldn’t bring himself to call it home.
she was.  Just a woman who, like them, had the poor luck to know about things no one should ever find out about.  And to learn about them at a young age. “It must have been hard seeing all those demons when you were young.”
“Love, what’s the matter?  You don’t call, you don’t write?  If I didn’t know better, I’d take it personally.” He turned his attention to Dean, sizing him up with a lascivious gaze that made Dean’s skin crawl. “And who is this lovely thing?  Name’s Crowley MacLeod.  It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Dean gave her a small nod and then turned away.  I hurt too much to think that any of this was rooted in love, in what he and Cas felt for each other.
After class, he met up with Lisa, slung his arm over her shoulders loosely, and got their lunch before walking to the outside eating area that had just opened back up as the weather finally improved.  Dean popped a chicken nugget into his mouth as he sat down with the collection of outcasts he loosely called his friends.  The cafeteria food here may suck, but it’s free, so Dean tried not to complain too much, especially on Nugget Day.
Castiel reached for his other leg, jostling him a little as he felt around to find the knife stuffed in an inside pocket.
Cas raised an eyebrow.  “At some point, we’ll have to have a conversation about how far you want to take this.”
“Fuck, Sammy—you aren’t supposed to be like insightful and shit.  You’re just a kid.”  Dean swiped a hand across his face, definitely not to remove any tears that might be gathering.
“Yes, I will come too.  When Eileen gets here, she will watch over Cas. Sam has already texted her.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to pry.  I’ve just never met a Sibyl before.  I’d never even heard of them.  I’m sure there’s something in our books, though, if you’d be curious to find out more.”
Sam rubbed his hands down his thighs and looked at Castiel, “Ok, well, obviously, we can’t do this now, with everyone in the building. What’s the plan.”
Sister Veronica lifted her hands from her work while he checked his texts.  Eileen.  Shit, he hadn’t told her about any of this.  He managed to type out a quick message that he would facetime her as soon as he could and that he missed her.  A second later, he got a message back.
“He’s not exactly popular down here!” Dean cried, “but that doesn’t mean we’re giving up.  We need to know more about that fucking branch and about what it’s done to Cas and how to undo it.”
Dean looked around. He knew some of the people nearby but no one who would go to bat for him.  Oh, that’s right, his friends were upstairs fucking his girlfriend without him, and Victor had disappeared to chase his next meaningless hookup. Dean squared his shoulders and pulled on all the bravado he’d learned watching his Dad hunt; all the bravery he pretended to have so Sam could sleep at night, despite everything they knew about what went bump in the night.
Castiel interrupted him, his balance leaning him closer to Dean.  “There’s an inn back in town.  I’ll take Dean there and ward the room.  You should stay here with Rowena in case you need her for something.”
Castiel probed the bruises before moving on to the man’s shoulders and back, definitely finding stingers still embedded in his flesh. Dean was strong, muscular in that way men who really use their bodies have. Exactly the kind of man Castiel was always hoping—and failing—to find in Lawrence, Kansas. He kept his touch light, careful not to linger as he checked over the firm ass in his face. Despite the red bumps that were swelling before his eyes and dozens of stingers he’d found, he really wanted to chew on that ass.
Dean walked through the protections, entering the combination, and placed the box inside.  He was intrigued enough to want to open it and see what the fuck they were dealing with, but that seemed like tempting fate at this point.  Cas would tell them, and then they’d figure out what to do.  He shut the safe, spun the dial, and then cut his hand, sealing it with blood.  Now only someone of his bloodline, which at this point was just him and Sam, would be able to open it.
“I like you.  I’m enjoying spending time with you.  And I think you’re enjoying it too.  And I believe this is my fault.  That I’ve upset you.  If you let me, I want to make it better.  And I want to understand, so I don’t upset you again.”  Cas reached out and wrapped strong fingers around Dean’s wrist.
When Cas finally speared his tongue into Dean, his rim was soft and pliant, allowing him to press it inside.  The invasion was wet and welcome.  Inside Dean, something cracked.  Perhaps it was his last hold on defiance. Perhaps it was the last of his anger.  Whatever it was, it unfurled, letting Cas into more than just his body.
Today was apparently back day, which made Castiel’s mouth water.  The man leaned over at the waist, giving his gawking audience a perfect view of a tight ass that just begged for someone to stick their tongue as deep inside him as they could.  He lifted two free weights above his head and proceeded to go through a routine that had Castiel panting and sweating along with him.  He was going to need to go home to shower after this with those images in his head.
Dean swiped his hands down Cas’ back and up his sides, feeling the strength within his lithe body.  After a few moments, Cas reached between them and grabbed his cock, lining it up with Dean’s entrance.
Dean shifted in his seat, tapped his fingers to the music, and gripped the steering wheel tighter.  He needed to get out of his head.
Oh and don't forget you can bid on me writing you a story to your specs!  I'm an author for the FicFacer's auction with proceeds going to Random Acts.  Right now, the bid for me is only $15.  Got an idea or prompt you want me to write for you?  Check out the deets on how to bid!
Also, Charlie is a fucking hoot and a half.  I might have to do a whole Charlie-centric story someday.
“Bobby would love to have someone around who might be as smart as him.  I don’t come anywhere close.”
He shoved away the last person in the crowd before he stood a few feet away, staring down Crowley with an intensity that seemed to suck all the oxygen out of the room.  The hair on Dean's arms stood up and the room went silent except for the blasting music that suddenly seemed so much louder.
“What?” he opened his eyes and looked around. Lisa smiled up at him, so he dipped into a kiss, but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder.
Castiel raised one eyebrow at him again and quirked half of what one might consider calling a smile.  If you were generous.
“I can’t wait to shove my cock in there and feel you swallow me down.  But right now, you have dumplings to make.” Castiel chuckled darkly and it made the hair on Dean’s arms stand up straight and his cock plump.
Castiel laughed, “Oh Veronica, don’t you understand?  I am Castiel, purified, returned to myself without your human stain.  I can no more be removed than cotton can be removed from your shirt.  It is part and parcel of the same thing.  Someday, I’ll find my way free from your trap, and I’ll show you.”
It was dark by the time the front door slammed open and Bobby’s voice rang out. “Boys, I got the fixin's for Chicken parmesan.  It’ll be ready in an hour, so get your homework done.”
At the end everyone was excited for next week’s discussion, promising to return and tasked with bringing the oldest version of the bible they could find in their home.  Castiel himself had 5 bibles with him, lugged all the way from Vermont, and he planned to bring them all.  His energy was high, his passion and inspiration stirred to new levels.  This was what he joined the seminary for.
He pushed the door open and opened his mouth to ask but was greeted by the sight of Dean once again taking his breath away by doing something completely unpredictable.  He had taken off his flannel and was now wearing an apron and dancing with Garth. Elvis played in the background. Garth had one enormous paw on Dean’s shoulder and the strange green-eyed man held the other. Dean sang along, his voice low and rough, but still lyrical and deeply, intensely sexy.
The furniture was all sturdy and firm.  Castiel ran his hands along the desk, imagining Dean making all of this with his own hands.  Hands that would be rough and calloused but knew how to make beautiful things come to life.
“I knew I could trust you!” Charlie exclaimed, throwing her arms around Dean’s shoulders and nearly knocking him off his feet. Castiel’s hands were firm on his back, steading them.
“No, he blames Jack, and me, and Cas,” Sam replied, shaking his head. Eileen gave him a soft smile and shook her head.
“Go! Go, Cas!” Dean yelled, forcing himself to run faster. He nearly ran into Castiel’s back as Cas tripped over a small drainage ditch, but another look behind them showed they were both faster than the townspeople.
“What?” Dean laughed again, flinging the pillow back. “I think it would be an excellent name. Maybe a Deanna?”
me one, I was already predisposed and despite the warnings from Uncle Bobby and my dad… I chose to self medicate with a bottle anyway.”
“I hope you two are doing well this morning. Nurse Vicki, who was taking care of you and Lucas last night, said that everything is looking well! She’s thinking you can be discharged soon. Wouldn’t that be nice?”
“Shut up,” Dean said, nudging Sam’s shoulder before taking the pajamas from his hands. “I feel good this morning, really. And I just… I don’t tell you enough, you know?”
The October air was crisp without the sun and they were grateful for the blankets they’d thought to bring out with them. The night itself was still and quiet, not even a whisper of the wind. Jack stepped surefooted over the rocky path down to the water and turned left to a private dock.
The few rare times she saw Dean and Castiel together, she made a point of ignoring Dean completely, even going so far as to talk to Castiel about his ‘real’ future, with a woman, like a ‘normal’ person. It had been part of the reason Dean had been so terrified to come out to his father; he was convinced John Winchester wouldn’t stop at simply ignoring it and passing snide comments. He was sure John would beat the ‘gay’ from him, and nothing Castiel said would change his mind.
He went about finding his colander whilst that was happening, along with the few containers he had free. He'd gotten three more whilst shopping with Dean, one of which he'd use for the jam, even if it wasn't exactly a model container to use. Castiel had plenty of jam jars left though, so storage, in that case, wasn't really an issue. He just wanted somewhere to keep the leftovers should he have any.
"I didn't know he was an angel until you bought him here," Sam informed him. "And I didn't realise you were with him because dad kicked you out. I thought you were doing that training thing that he was on about a few weeks ago."
There was a bout of static on the other end before Dean's voice came through again, somewhat muted. "Where are you right now?"
Dean went quiet again and Castiel started to pace the ledge, pulling at the hem of his shirt. He knew it was a ridiculous proposition and it'd most likely wear him out, but Dean needed some form of support right now and if the kid's family was too busy to be there for him then Castiel sure as fuck didn't mind taking their place.
Well, obviously, most of the reasoning behind that was down to what the angel could do power-wise, and Dean didn't know the exact opinion Castiel had of him, but he wasn't going to outright ask about it. He didn't need to make himself appear anymore desperate than he already had the night prior.
Castiel set his mouth into a tight line and stared back at Dean for longer than should be comfortable, but it made him feel like at least he won’t die alone, and he’s so tired.  Spots started to float through his vision. Maybe if he just rested a little, he’d feel better later.  He could just deal with this later when he could think clearer and that would be okay.  Yeah, that’s a good idea.
He turned his back, expecting Dean to simply comply.  Dean immediately wanted to snark back, but the continued quaking in his body and a new, exciting throb in his cock made him obey.  And suddenly he understood why Cas kept saying this was dangerous because when the man touched him like that, he wanted to obey any order, fulfill any request, no matter the cost.
“Sister Veronica is in there. I’ll be in my office just down the hall checking on the progress if you need anything.” She bowed her head slightly and shuffled off, her small black figure moving quickly through the hall.
Dean opened his car door and looked back over his shoulder. “Come on, if you decide you wanna leave, I’ll drive you home or to Meg’s, whatever you want, okay?  Really, with the stuff locked in your brain, I think you’re gonna get a kick out of Bobby’s collection.”
“I thought,” Castiel shuffled her feet and looked at the ground next to Dean. “Tomorrow is Sunday, so there will be people here late tonight and all day tomorrow. I thought I could fill you in on what’s going on over dinner and we could come back tomorrow night after everyone has left.”
“We don’t have to do anything, Dean.  We can just kiss or talk.  I don’t want you to think I expect--” Cas’ sweet offer is cut off by a rumbling growl.
“You are so fucking beautiful,” Cas groaned before licking the swath of sensitive skin.  “And you’re being so good, so very good for me.”  He lavished rough kisses onto the skin next to the bone with a deep suctioning kiss and a swipe of the tongue.
“Well, I mean, who’s to say you even care, I know you said you met Castiel Novak, but him being the headline of like every Gay Boston Tumblr and Blog this morning isn’t something you’d be interested in is it?”
“Cas, have you been eating?” Dean ran his fingers down the other man’s face, feeling the sharpness of his cheekbone and the strong jawline jutting out more than it should.
“It’s a bit of a saga, honestly,” Castiel pulled a drink from his beer, enjoying the numbing sensation and not wanting to fall into the pit of his past.
Who wanted contract negotiations, raise your hand?  This is a little less formal, but a fuck of a lot more titillating for what's coming next chapter, no?
He spoke out loud, never able to get the words right in person, but sitting here next to the empty vessel, the words just poured out.
Dean shook his head.  He was never the one out of control.  Never the victim.  He hated the way Sam was looking at him.  He tried to pull away and walk on his own, but he stumbled and Sam refused to let him try again.
Dean let go of Lisa and stepped up to Meg, worried she was going to freak out. Her breathing came in harsh bursts like she couldn’t get enough air.
“What?” He said, putting a hand on the back of his neck and shifting his weight slightly from foot to foot.
“Perhaps that is true,” Castiel nodded slowly.  “But on the off chance it is not, I’d rather fail while encouraging people to find love and truth in their relationship with God, than be a dictator of His word.”  Castiel gathered his jacket and left the silenced Michael behind.
“Sounds perfect,” Cas sighed, his posture finally relaxing. “Thank you, Dean.  I’m sorry you were pulled into that.”
Dean opened his eyes and returned Cas’s glowing stare, transfixed by the alienness of the creature he loved with his whole being.  If only he could say it.  But every time he felt the words on the tip of his tongue Cas did something to derail his thoughts.
But Cas had his head all spun up. It was the same words and inflections, it was the way he heard Cas’s voice in his head, but it came out of Sister Veronica’s mouth. A woman’s mouth. A woman with smooth tanned skin and full lips, not that different from Jimmy Novak’s now that he thought about it. He’d never noticed Cas’s lips before. Doing so now fucked with his sense of what was a constant.
Castiel pulled his hands away with a shaky breath, barely able to see straight from the amount of blood gathering in his painful erection.
“You can’t tell anyone.  Please, Dean.  I was never here. Promise me.” Castiel said, his voice husky and somewhere between desperate and dangerous.
“Remind me again why you aren’t a nurse practitioner?” Amelia smiled before approaching Dean. “Hi, there, Mr. Winchester, can you tell me how you’re feeling?”
Dean allowed himself to be pulled down, close to Cas’ side.  The dark-haired man ran his hand over the back of Dean’s neck and into the short hairs at the base of his skull.  He rubbed gently, working on the tension points and warming up Dean’s skin where he touched.  After a little while, Dean’s body relaxed and he looked over to Cas.
“How about your ass?” Sam snarks, earning himself a raised eyebrow from his new friend, the nun. “Sorry.”
Castiel laughed, a caustic, bitter laugh, the idea so absurd it shocked through his trauma. “Dean, I didn’t even kiss anyone until I was in college, and including you, that adds up to a total of three people.”
“Yeah yeah, brother. It’ll be nice to know somebody. It’s been hard these last few weeks, feeling out of place all the time.”
“How a man responds to a dog attack is a good indicator of character.” Castiel looks at him seriously and Dean honestly doesn’t know how to take his response.
“But I’ve been pushing you, I know I have, and I’m sorry.  I don’t want to see you in any pain.” He pulled back his hand and was shocked when Castiel wrapped a strong grip around his wrist.
The music swam over him, and Lisa wanted to dance.  He usually wouldn’t, but tonight he indulged her--and himself, if he’s honest--he’s just in a good fucking mood.  When Gordon slapped him on the ass and told him he’s pretty enough to work a pole, he didn't even flinch, just flashed a smile and winked at him.
Sam helped support his weight as they walked out of the room.  In the hall, Dean could see the ring of holy fire a little down the hall.  When Cas saw him, the screaming intensified, and that voice in his head that belonged to Cas wailed
Dean woke slowly, warm whispers tickling the hair at the nape of his neck. Cas was wrapped tightly around him, his leg thrown over dean’s and his arm laying heavy across his chest.  The angel ran hot, his body warm, heating the room and filling it with that indescribable scent that always made Dean think of lightning striking, a clean burn.
“I… I don’t sleep.  And I didn’t want to presume… And this is just the size of beds here.” Cas’ voice went up at the end of his last sentence, and Dean smiled.  He was just as fucking endearing as he’d always been.  “I can just watch over you or give you privacy.  I don’t need a bed.”
He stopped and dropped his hands into his lap, head hanging forward.  He felt small and suddenly completely miserable.  Castiel was upset with him.  He was sure of it.  He’d done something wrong and now Cas didn’t want him, and on top of all of it, he was being such a fucking baby about it.  Tears pricked the back of his eyes and Dean wanted to run away, go home and bury himself in beer and his memory foam mattress.
Castiel kissed the top of her head and it's anything but sexual. “All that thorny pain, so beautiful,” he inhaled loudly and tightened his hold on her.
“Yes, those side stitches can be extremely painful.  You need to stretch.  For running, yes, but weight lifting too.  Before and after.”  Castiel lectured without meaning to, just hating to see the man in pain.
Vicki laughed, but it was happy and Castiel didn’t mind even a little bit that she was laughing at them. They were going to see Lucas!
now missing the last x and the 3, but he knew from experience it still worked, still played every single track.
Dean searched his eyes, a small smile poking at the corner of his lips. Then he mirrored Castiel's earlier movement, rising his hand to pull his collar down. "Neither am I."
“What?” Sam replied, standing up from the chair, only stopping when both Eileen and Cas reached for him. “He can’t say that shit to you Cas, enough is enough!”
“No, but I have been able to receive a few radio transmissions. Updates from cities close to us. And He tells me everything I need to know.” Chuck leaned back on the desk, finishing off Castiel’s glass and setting it beside his empty one. “I unfortunately lost my love when all of this began, and like most of us, I was terrified and lost over the state of our new world. What was going to happen now? How was I going to survive? What about my friends, family, community? And I knew that I had to help.
Castiel took a deep breath, trying to quell the nervous twitch in his stomach. It had been weeks, longer than anticipated due to multiple days of rain, but today was the day.
Dean chuckled and nodded his head. “Yeah, Charlie’s pretty awesome. I didn’t realize she brought her LARPing to work, though.”
“Alright,” Dean agreed, looking up as Jack came bouncing back over to them, his hair still damp and flinging droplets of water.
It was overwhelming, burning him up from the inside out and he was helpless to move away from its onslaught. Every inch of him was on fire and he gasped, shaking as he tried to twist away from the invisible source.
Dean pulled his shirt off when the heat of the fire made him sweat, accepting the canteen from Castiel and drinking without question. Finally, he felt ready, ready to get up and continue moving in whatever daylight they had left. He opened his mouth to say so, but what came out was not what he expected.
Castiel seemed to have the same idea as Dean, and throughout the rest of the meal they both sat silently listening to the bits and pieces of conversions around them. Jack was busy asking questions, and it gave them useful information as Kevin seemed to be an open book. They learned about the work schedules, meal rotations, and security for the building. Kevin told Jack how they had converted the school down the road into a farm with cattle, chickens, and pigs to feed their community. Most were not ready to be slaughtered or bred, but they had been rounded up and stabled together for both convenience and protection.
“Mr. Cas?” Jo prompted and Castiel gave a small laugh at her facial expression. Better than angel-face, he supposed.
Castiel watched the kids swim over to the deck, pulling themselves up onto it, deep in conversation. With a quick check of his watch, Castiel saw it was almost one.
Castiel replied by kissing him again. Castiel’s body was warm, igniting every inch of Dean’s body with heat even though they were barely touching. The rest of the camp melted away, and the only thing that mattered was Castiel’s body against his.
“Wait,” Dean interrupted as he landed in the hallway, turning to see Charlie throw him a look over her shoulder as she walked towards their room. “You… you do have a uterus?”
“Yeah, okay.” Dean sighed, fingers clenching in the clothes on his lap. “This Chuck dude, there’s something about him, Cas. I don’t trust him, and I don’t trust this whole ‘family’ bullshit. I am going to sleep with one freaking eye open already.”
Dean opened his mouth to respond but was met with a swooping sensation, deep in the pit of his stomach, a wave of ice moving down his spine. He clenched his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut, preparing for the landing. As his knees jammed into the solid ground, Dean missed the way Castiel had learned to let them down…
The sign to his right told him he was 70 miles from Chicago, and he could see the giant ‘Love’s Travel Stop’ sign looming over the tree line. Blowing out a breath, he moved to the side of the pavement to look over the guardrails. There was a slight decline, but it appeared to flatten out. He thought he even saw a cornfield popping up behind the trees.
Hell, he could’ve given up on Dean finding him and moved on all on his own. What the hell was up here in New York anyways, other than cold snow, ice, and dead Yankees. Sam probably went somewhere warmer, the coast, maybe. Somewhere they wouldn’t have to battle with freezing temperatures and would have created a life for himself, Jess, and whoever else he’d absorbed along the way. Hell, maybe he’d even found Uncle Bobby…
He heard Dean’s sharp intake of breath, felt the slight shake in his hands, saw the way he drifted closer before catching himself and pausing. Dean licked his lip, nervous again, and whispered, “Maybe we should-”
Dean picked up the knife again and a handful of the fabric. “I’m not sure how much longer we’re going to get away with Gilda keeping her bun in the oven,” Dean answered with a shrug. “I want to be prepared in case she does go into labor. We can’t have a newborn rolling around on the floor of a ship, you know?”
“Call my bluff,” Castiel cut him off, the sound of the safety clicking off loud in the silence of the woods. Dean forced himself not to close his eyes, keeping his gaze locked on Castiel. Despite the other man not looking at him, he knew Castiel’s complete attention was on him. The man in Castiel’s grasp, however, was not so strong and he flinched, his eyes squeezing shut.
The stranger’s eyes narrowed a fraction before Dean saw stars, pain blistering across his forehead, and he found himself back down in the leaves. “Oh look,” the man said with an exaggerated sigh, “you got blood on my gun.”
“Please,” Balthazar answered, reaching forward to place his hand at the base of Castiel’s spine, leading him forward until they were standing side by side opposite the priest. Castiel looked down at the table, the first scroll catching his attention.
spent more time ignoring him in favor of the screaming music coming through her cell phone, but he would take angry music over the drinking.
Dean laughed at that and jogged a few steps ahead to open the door for him. When he turned over the ignition, he looked at Castiel who had his head tipped back and eyes closed with a wide, gummy smile. If Dean wasn’t already in love with him? He would’ve been now.
Dean hesitated once again at the door, this time for another reason. It went unspoken that there was always privacy in the bunker behind the closed bedroom doors. Sam and Dean growing up
Jack pushed further between them, ducking his head down to look beneath the rearview mirror. Ahead of them, the lake stretched out as far as they could see. If Dean hadn’t known better, he would’ve believed they were on the coast, staring out at the ocean. “Do you think any of those boats are empty?”
Christmas,” Sam answered, pausing to look at Castiel as he dropped the bottles into the largest bowl. “For being my brother.”
Anna moved to sit on Castiel’s bed, her eyes trailing over Jimmy’s side. “You know… when things… happened? Jimmy refused to sleep in here.”
A flicker of irritation passed over the angel’s eyes and he sighed, looking away from Dean’s face. “Yes, like I told you last night, Dean. Your brother asked me-”
“You don’t know shit, Benny,” Dean hissed, pointing a finger in the center of his chest. He shivered as the feeling of ice washed over him once more and he drew his hand back, folding it over his chest.
Lawrence had a few different elementary schools, and this wasn’t one that Castiel had ever been inside of; his parents had sent him and his brother to one of the local Catholic Schools until high school, and it wasn’t in the neighborhood Dean and Sam had lived growing up. Dean was thorough as he showed off the important rooms - the offices, cafeteria, lost and found, library, computer science room, and the art and music rooms. Castiel could smell the gym before they came upon it, the scent of rubber balls, sweat, and floor wax hitting him and making him gasp at the sudden rush of memories.
Uncle Zachariah was coming today. The social worker lady that Gabe didn’t like very much had been there all morning, talking to the nurses and writing things on her clipboard. She spoke to Lucas mostly, Gabe saying it was cause he was the oldest. Castiel didn’t care why she only talked to Lucas, he was just glad she didn’t have to talk to him. Her smile was all barbie-looking, wide and unmoving and it made Castiel’s tummy hurt.
"But you can't do any of that or be truly happy in the castle," Castiel finished. Dean nodded and relaxed into Castiel's body, tucking his head beneath Castiel's neck. They fell silent, both lost in their own thoughts.
“Oh, me?” He felt himself flush when his mother nodded kindly at him and cleared his throat as he loaded a pile of beans on his plate. “It’s been pretty good - uh, mostly. I recently had to report a family to CPS…”
The vineyard building itself was oddly shaped with a large pitched roof on one side. The siding was a deep red and, unfortunately, everything around it was flat. There were cars scattered out in the parking lot and Dean paused, crouching down behind some of the grapes and pulling Castiel beside him.
“There’s a house back here, brother,” Benny said as he jerked his head back to the woods they just came from. “Looks clear, from what I can see.”
Moving through the rest of Sioux Falls, finding their way to the interstate and Castiel getting them through the East Gate, was almost… perfunctory. At first, Dean thought the other man was simply hung over, but they’d both had some Advil and a few glasses of water before they repacked their clean clothes and set out. And Dean was sure Castiel would have complained about it at least once by now. No, there was something else…
Gabriel snorted and reached down to put the seat back into the normal position. “No way, she’ll send Anna out first. Anna has been talking
They crouched down beside a small restaurant, just barely able to see the sign for The 4th Street Tap with its large Pabst beer advertisement. Charlie was running her hands along the side of the building when Dean suddenly noticed the mural. It was a well kept painting depicting an ocean scene, but what was on it… Dean stopped, cocking his head as he tried to put together what he was looking at.
“Hey, Ed,” Dean knocked his knuckles on the wall of the intake divider, making the ED Tech jump in his chair. He nearly toppled over as he spun it quickly and Dean forced himself to keep a straight face. “The guy who came in with the intoxicated teen? He’s… uh, family.”
“I said,” Lucas yelled, crossing his arms over his chest, “Castiel is a big ass baby!” Lucas squirmed back from Daddy’s hands and pressed himself against the door. On Castiel’s other side, Gabriel did the same, just in case, and Castiel was left stuck in the middle.
This would be good for them. It didn’t matter if Dean Winchester was still around Lawrence. It was a large city and the idea of running into him was ridiculous - they weren’t even in the same crowds anymore. He wouldn’t see Dean, there was no reason for him to. He had his kids to worry about, a new job to get the hang of, and a family to catch up on. He had no room for Dean’s what-ifs or could-bes.
“Chuck knows everything,” Jesse replied with an eye roll, giving a friendly smile. “I believe he has different radios set up in his quarters, but I’ve never asked. He tells us what we need to know.”
They crowded onto the front porch and Castiel looked towards the car, Jack still passed out across the back seat, before he turned back to give his attention to Kali. The house had been empty before he put in the offer, so he didn’t expect any issues during their walk through, but it was worth seeing Claire light up as she took in the large house.
Anna screamed as the last Lifeless ripped through her upper arm, fingernails breaking through her skin like a knife cutting butter. Dean shot forward, stabbing his blade through the creature’s back. It let out an awful howl, Anna’s scream matching it in pitch as it jerked away from her, tearing her arm open.
Usually a beautiful chocolate brown, they were ringed in red, tears of blood slipping from the corners and making tracks down her cheeks. Her mouth was covered in blood that Dean knew in his heart was not her own. He reacted, giving into the fight response that was screaming at him from his gut, and slammed her backwards until her head cracked against the marble counter.
Castiel cocked his head to the side and then broke into a wide, gummy smile, his laughter matching Dean’s. “I honestly never thought I would find myself back in the closet.”
As soon as Dean saddled Crowley, Castiel slipped down from the hay bale. They climbed into the saddle, Castiel shaking his head at the offer to be at the front, and then they were off, trotting into the night and to the forest path. Dean carried a long stick with a lantern at the end, giving them enough light to see by as they made their way through the thick trees.
“Morning, Dean,” Castiel answered, firmly ignoring her. “They have a tractor going out to the patch in thirty minutes. Want to grab some donuts and cider for the trip?”
“Where’s my nephew?” Gabriel asked as he stepped back, eyes scanning the front yard and landing on Claire. He gave a friendly wave to her, laughing when he received an eye roll and quick flip of her hand back in response. “Oh, teenagers. I don’t envy you, brother.”
“Claire, I don’t mind you asking me any questions, okay? But… I’m not sure if that’s an appropriate topic of conversation for us to have, okay?”
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel whispered, reaching for his leg to give it a squeeze. He couldn’t imagine not seeing Jack for four years of his life, missing his first years of growing and learning. His heart ached for Dean.
“I’m glad you’re here,” she whispered and Castiel smiled, leaning over to press a kiss to the top of her head.
could and should and would be a better boyfriend than Dean. At least he wouldn’t force Castiel to hide their relationship.
Sam hung up the phone and sat back in his chair, staring at the window before him. Then, suddenly, he whipped the phone across the room, crumpling in on himself with a broken sob. Dean stood over his brother helplessly, staring at his shaking shoulders.
friends, you know! I don’t give a fuck what happened between you and Dean, you dropped the rest of us like we meant
“Here we go,” Dean muttered as he took his spot beside Castiel, bracing himself against the door. They let Uriel give the count, then the five of them pushed.
Dean only smiled back at him. He didn’t want there to be any hesitation, any doubt in Castiel’s mind about what this was. He put the last plate down, then moved around the table to stand in front of Cas.
“You’re here! You’re here!” she kept repeating, not letting him go until Michael cleared his throat pointedly and took his spot where Anna was, giving Castiel the friendliest hug he’d ever received from the eldest Novak - outside of Michael being drunk.
In the year it took to adopt Claire, there had been a constant drive to get everything in order - paperwork, court dates, interviews. With everything finalized and the move over with, he was suddenly afraid things would get hard. What if Claire regretted choosing them? What if she ended up hating him or Jack? He wasn’t worried about himself - he was worried about screwing something up and hurting Claire even more than the last fourteen years had.
“Benny’s got him occupied,” Charlie answered with a shake of her head. “He knew I was going to try and talk to you two.”
Hanging over the cot was a small bookshelf with books that Castiel immediately beelined to. He knew there were books on gardening, mechanics, basic survival, and medicine. Bobby collected anything that he thought would be useful at the end of the world, despite Dean laughing at him every time he gained a new book. Now, Dean was swallowing back his laughter as he wondered if they could reasonably fit and carry the texts…
Dean rolled over him completely, pressing Castiel down into the mattress as he kissed the last excuse from his lips. Castiel gave a soft sigh and kissed him back, reaching up to cup the side of Dean’s face.
Castiel nodded and let himself look. There was a quilt Jimmy’s high school sweetheart had made him, folded over the end of the bed. Varsity jackets were pinned to the wall and a shelf was full to the brim of Jimmy’s trophies. Where Castiel was always studious, eager for a chess club rather than a lacrosse team, Jimmy was athletic.
"But..." Castiel's fingers tightened in Dean's hold and he pressed up, looking down at Dean's face. "But that would mean that you're-"
Chuck clicked his tongue and sat down on the end of the bed, the mattress springs groaning out their protest. “Do you remember where you were when the world ended?” He blew out a slow breath, his eyes trailing away from Dean and looking to the side of the room where the armoire sat. “I was an author, before The End, and I was cooped up in my office, typing away, with the rest of the world going on around me and I never gave it a passing thought. Then my fiancé came home, her hair pulled out of her ponytail, crying and panicked…” Chuck laughed, lifting the glass to his lips again, but he didn’t drink it.
Claire took a moment and Castiel found himself smiling at how serious she was taking his words. Then she nodded again. “When we first moved in together, after the honeymoon phase was over, there were some things that drove me nuts… but we’ve worked out a lot of our issues. I mean, if we weren’t talking then we would’ve broken up long ago, you know? And while I can’t stand how she leaves dishes everywhere, I love that she cleans the bathrooms and enjoys laundry. I hate how her hair is always in the shower drain, but love how she takes the time to help me braid mine. She has a temper, she’s quick to snap, but she always is sincere and steps away to breathe, and we never go to bed angry. I just -
Castiel chuckled and reached down between his feet, pulling out an old, worn Carhartt box full of cassette tapes. “You still have all of these?” Castiel asked as he pulled it up and started poking through the tapes.
“That’s why you’re my favorite brother,” Gabriel replied with a smirk. “Just don’t tell sour puss over there.”
“Char, come on. You’re going to be an amazing Mom! Gilda, too.” Dean gave her hand a squeeze and watched a tear track down her cheek.
It took most of the day to finish the room, Anna and Castiel working slowly but efficiently. Some of Jimmy’s knick knacks and trophies were moved to the living room, displayed on the mantle. A few were given to their brothers and placed with Castiel and Anna’s own things, to bring back to their homes.
The man’s stance was wide, confident, and Dean was immediately hit with military vibes. He clenched his hands into fists to keep them from shaking and held his head up high, meeting the man’s eyes straight on.
Dean gave a short, surprised laugh and shoved at Castiel gently. “You do not,” he replied, turning around to look behind them. The forest was quiet but for the sounds of nature, and Dean was relieved that the townspeople had given up their chase and that their crashing through hadn’t summoned any Lifeless.
Dean jerked his head up, taking in the sight before him. “Behind you!” he shouted at Uriel, the other man grappling with one of the Lifeless, a second reaching for his back. Their eyes were bleeding, skin ashen and rotting in a way Dean hadn’t seen yet. Their fingernails were shredded, as if they’d tried to claw their way through a wall to get out of the storeroom.
Dean shivered as he sat up, reaching behind himself to tuck the sleeping bag around Cas’ shoulders so the cold air wouldn’t rush in and wake him. Castiel’s breath hitched before he continued snoring softly, with each exhale releasing a small puff Dean could see. They really needed to get warmer gear…
“It’s funny how the seemingly mundane things, like a home cooked meal, going to work every day, cleaning the house… those are the weird things you miss.”
“Castiel!” Her smile was genuine, her eyes glassy as she rounded the island, tossing the hand towel in her hands onto the counter before coming to wrap him in a hug. He couldn’t help it; at first, he stiffened, but his mom felt like safety and he melted into her hug, finding himself squeezing her back just as tightly.
“It was amazing!” Ben answered back, beaming up at him. “The sprinkles looked like fire! It was so cool!”
Castiel nodded and looked into the fire, the orange flames causing light to flicker over his face. Still, even with the glow and the darkness around them, his eyes shone bright and blue, almost ethereal. Dean swallowed thickly, tearing his eyes away from Cas to look at their food, flicking a beetle away as it climbed the side of a tin.
“Yes! That!” Dean turned towards Castiel, giving him a look. “She would’ve understood my Terminus reference.”
“You girls good going with us?” Dean asked, looking over at Charlie and Gilda as they laid Samwise down for a nap.
Dean glanced over to see himself as a child staring in wonder at Santa Claus, taking his time to place each present perfectly underneath the tree. Then he filled the stockings hanging by the fake, construction paper fireplace taped against the wall by the tree. John stopped and took a handful of cookies before he picked up the bag and started back out the front door.
. The complete relief he felt was overwhelming. Castiel was thankfully patient, waiting until Dean caught his breath before rolling his eyes and punching Dean’s shoulder.
“Yes, Ben, I’m going to tell Mom. We don’t hide things from Mom, remember?” Dean gave him a soft smile and leaned over to pull him into a hug. “I’m proud of you for sticking up for your friend, and I know Mom will be, too. But no more fighting, understand?”
“You’re not s’posed to drug people.” Dean’s mouth felt thick, his tongue heavy and he allowed Jack and Castiel to reposition him on the bed. “Asshole…”
“I don’t know why I never thought of picking these up,” Castiel said as he held up his prize triumphantly. “No more burned fingers, Dean! This will -”
Alfie’s  legs were twitching, his feet falling lifelessly to the sides, and Castiel sucked in a breath as a sucking sound was heard before blood sprayed across the floor. Alfie was gone. But where was -
Dean pushed up from the table to head over to the cooler where Castiel was standing and he bent down to open it just as Castiel pressed something cold against his arm.
“Liar!” Claire screeched again, sliding into the kitchen on her socked feet. “Mr. Cas, I didn’t say that! I said-”
“Then we will find him, Dean,” Castiel replied, as if it was that simple. “Your brother left you a direction back in Sioux Falls, and he wouldn’t leave this city without leaving you another. We will find him, Dean. I feel it in my bones.”
“Everyone has their role, Jack. Wait until Chuck assigns you yours. That’s the way we keep our peace.”
"Oh, Dean," Castiel breathed out, throwing his arms around the Alpha's neck and collapsing on top of him. He held on to Dean as tight as he could, his heart aching and eyes stinging as he imagined the horror Dean and Sam had to face so young. "I'm so sorry."
“Don’t,” a man said, his deep baritone and British lilt leaving no room for argument. “Get up, slowly. And do be quiet about it.”
He parked at the farthest end of the teacher’s parking lot, breathing in deeply as he shut off the ignition. The heat in the car was nearly overwhelming by the time he finally forced himself to open the car door and get out. He checked that he had his wallet and his keys, and then turned towards the school before he did something stupid like check out his reflection.
“Don’t - I need - Cas, get a flashlight!” Dean ordered, squinting as he turned the bottle sideways, emptying out more of what little water was left.
“Jack was out on the lake fishing when he heard the shots. I don’t know what possessed him to come searching for the source - he just said he ‘felt it was important’ - but I’m glad he did. He helped me get you to the boat and to his home. That’s where we are now, Kelly and Jack’s. They own a resort on the river, cabins and such they used to rent - though Kelly says most of them are empty now except for a few family friends.”
Chuck appeared at the top of the stairs, his arms out wide as he began to descent. “Welcome home, my family!” he said loudly, his voice strong and deep as it carried over the room.
They did, however, have to get moving. At the very least, they needed a plan for what they were going to do next. Dean’s leg was still healing, and while he was sure he could manage to travel on foot, he knew that covering the average forty miles a day they’d been doing before he was wounded was an unrealistic goal. Twenty, maybe, as long as Castiel’s supply of pain meds lasted, and he didn’t tear the wound open.
“You would’ve loved him,” Sam said softly after a moment. “You would’ve found him endearing, would’ve loved his sense of humor. I think you guys would’ve gotten along great.”
“My man!” Gabriel exclaimed, wiping his hands on his hot pink apron and coming around the other side of the counter. “Give me five!”
As suddenly as the weight was there, the chains were gone, leaving Dean blinking into utter darkness.
John Winchester flickered once, twice, then stood before him. He was pale, thick double-linked chains winding around his chest and hips, dragging against the tile like a tail. They shimmered gold, flashing as they touched his skin with a soft sizzle of heat and smoke. Dean opened his mouth to ask how on Earth a ghost could be draped in iron chains and still appear corporeal, but realized there was a more pressing question.
“Upstairs!” Castiel called back and Dean smiled, anticipation already bubbling in his gut. It was rare they got a real night off from all the kids. He took the stairs two at a time, pushing open the bedroom door to find Castiel waiting for him, sitting on the end of the bed with his work shirt unbuttoned and opened.
It was amazing… how small and fragile this new, tiny human was, and yet he was here, being passed between the group, warm in his blankets, crying and smiling and
Dean chuckled at Castiel’s phrasing and tears started to fall again. His leg hurt so fucking much. “Yeah, sometimes, it’s not like all the time or whatever.”
He breathed in and was careful not to let himself touch the tempting skin peeking out, pale with soft, thin hair.  Jesus, this was going to kill him.  The spasming muscle was easy to find and Castiel pressed hard with his thumbs, encouraging the blood flow to increase in that area to soothe the injured muscle when he released the pressure.  He massaged the small patch of thigh he trusted himself to touch and the man said nothing, his breath ragged and loud.  Surely still from the run.
Veronica passed him the bread and waited while he chewed slowly, savoring each complex flavor as if it were the first time he had tasted honey as if it had come from the garden itself.
“Oh, yeah, I usually go after work or just run with Claire.  I hate the morning.  And since I’d see you tonight, I let myself sleep in.
Castiel pulled Dean into his side and placed a kiss on his temple.  “Are you upset because I didn’t let you make me come?”
“Fuck off, Meg,” Lisa snapped, turning them away from her, but Dean caught a look at her in the corner of his eyes.  She was running both hands through her hair, looking around frantically.
When they were done, Castiel looked from Veronica to the bread sitting on her side of the fire.  She ripped off another small piece and dipped it into the honey, thick and flavorful.  This time, as soon as her fingers crossed the barrier, Castiel grabbed it from her, making sure not a single bit dripped from the bread.
“The bones, Dean. I think you broke your leg.” He looked around a crease of worry in his forehead.  “Do you have a pocket knife?”
“I laid out scrubs for him, but he walked here. He doesn’t have shoes or a phone or any way to get home.” He frowned.
“Can you just cut to the chase here, Cas?” Dean growled, staring Cas in the eyes. His voice low and tired. The woman standing in front of them was otherworldly, not just because of the fire and wings and usual Cas specific magnetism. Her long brown hair hung in waves well past her shoulders and even with the formless brownish-red dress, her curves managed to shine through in all the right ways. All the ways Dean would make sure to run his hands over under any other situation. He shook his head. Why was he even thinking like that? Sure it’s been a while, but oogling a nun?
“Cas?” Dean brought a hand up to Cas’s face but instead of the angel melting into his touch the way Dean had expected, Cas grabbed it and pinned him to the bed.  His other hand moved from his hip to take his other wrist and pin that one as well.
“That’s it, I’m outlawing sci-fi in the house from now on.  No more Alien movies for you.  No more True Mysteries either.” Dean laughed.
As Dean grabbed his leather jacket and started for the door, he heard Lisa call his name. “Dean!  You never came upstairs.”
“Ha!  Here less than a day and you’re whipped already. Alright,” Dean rubbed his hands together, “I don’t know about you two, but it’s the middle of the damn night, might actually be the morning now, and there’s no way I’m sleeping until Cas gets his feathery ass back and tells us what’s going on.  So who wants food?”
Man, I must really have you guys on edge for how wary you were of Luke!  Luke isn't quite Lucifer.  Think of him as Lucifer before the fall.  Arrogant, cocky, but still sane.  Desperately devoted to his siblings even when they disagree.
“Sammy, this is good,” Dean smiled. “Maybe you’re just something we haven’t thought of yet.  I say we keep with the plan, go through the books and see what rings a bell.”
“Always a little brother.” Dean sighed and stood up.  “Call me if anything feels weird or you wanna talk.  Anything.  And wake Rowena up if you need her, okay?”
They push open the doors and find a sparse space with a few pews but hundreds of candles on a magnificent altar. Sculptures litter the alter and floor and every free space is painted with images from Christianity, including the floor. Dean spots a few Enochian Symbols as he glances around and wonders what else was hidden in the tiny chapel.
