“Should I be surprised you are down here?” A voice interrupted their playing. It was Steve who was home from a meeting in Washington. He leaned against the doorframe, he was wearing dark jeans and a darker demine shirt that defined his body and Tony found it hard to resist.
“No he is not David. He is my best friend and that’s it! And even if he is in love with me…” He takes a deep breath because that was stupid to even entertain that thought. “It doesn’t matter because I am not in love with him… I am with you! I am choosing you not Steve.” He explains and reaches out to take David’s hand in his and run his thumb over his knuckles to assure him that he was in this one hundred percent.
He moves his head so it rest on the side, his nose touching Tony’s throat. “I know but I really liked it.” Steve assures him and place a small kiss on Tony’s throat.
“Are you close?” Tony was pressed to his back and he could feel how hard Tony was though his slacks and his breath is hot against his ear and Tony’s was teasing around the perineum with soft touches and touching his balls with a soft hand making Steve buck his hips out and clench down on those stupid beads that just seemed to send out vibration of pleasure on their own accord.
They had dressed up for their date, Tony in simple jeans, button up and a jacket thrown over while David had gone for a black suit without the tie. It was nice that for once that someone else also dressed up when going out and not just him. His friends had a tendency to just go out in jeans and t-shirt and claim that they were behind on laundry. Every single time! Tony had given up and hoped that one day his friends would start dressing up, but he pushed his friends away from his mind and let David take over his mind.
“He had a long day and I had been at SI all day forgetting to make him dinner and we were supposed to have a night together and…” He defends him and logically Steve knows that this wasn’t the Tony he knew before this relationship and he should be as supportive as he possibly could but he would not stand by and allow him to go back to that relationship.
He blushes when he receives the instructions from Tony. But he will of course complete the task none the less because Tony had asked that of him. Picking up the phone again to reread the instructions he had been received so he was sure he made them right and didn’t disappoint him.
Rachel smiles a soft and understanding smile as she takes a sip of her coffee. “That’s what I said when people asked. Who are you protecting? I was protecting Simon.” She nodded to the picture in front of him.
“These are for you!” He is handed the gifts and the young man is of again. Tony closes the door with his foot and walks to his living room and puts down flowers and boxes on the table ignoring the gift box and head straight to the card that was stuck in the flowers.
“I remember that as well… It was the night I met the love of my life.” Tony replies. “And he would never doubt himself when teaching. Because he knows that it is his calling.” Tony promises him.
Steve sighs hoping that Tony would. He didn’t need to ask if he was allowed to come over. Something was up with Tony that Steve was sure of. He just continues with his grocery list and just hopes that Tony would stop by so they could talk and maybe clear the air about what is going on.
Over the five coming years Tony worked hard on building his empire and Steve to make partner at his firm. Both supporting each other every step of the way when the confidence falter and hard times came their way but they pushed through and always came out successful on the other side. They also moved two time under this time to get a bigger apartment so they each had at office at home and have an extra room for when they decided to make their family bigger which was something they both wanted.
“Steve! Tony is an adult like the rest of us and he is capable of making his own choices! And if he wants to date this David guy he is free to do so!” Bucky explained to him when he complained about Tony spending all his time with David and logically he knew and understood that it was normal to spend more time with the new partner in the beginning of a relationship. But his gut was telling him that something was completely off with David and he was no good for Tony. “Are you sure that it isn’t just jealousy talking? I mean you have had a thing for him for over ten years but you have acted on it!”
My cousin birthday was this weekend... He would have been 29 and it just got me sad and I needed to get it out.
It came and it came hard. He didn’t actually know if it was any harder than the hits before this or if his butt was burning now and made everything hurt way more than it really did. Then the next one landed making his tears fall more freely and him screaming out in pain. But he was halfway done. Only fourteen more and they were done. He could do that. He would make Tony so proud; he just wanted to be a good boy for Tony. His mind seems to float and everything is fuzzy and blurry. Oh… he was deep in subspace and down here the leather didn’t seem to hurt as mush he thinks as the leather hit him again. He changed his mind the leather hurt down here to, gritting his teeth as two more blows landed on him. But he was almost done only eleven left. And then he had taken the punishment like a good boy.
“Thank you.” Steve smiles and grabs the bowl of ice cream and start eating it and Tony just look at him in awe as he eats his ice cream and drinks his tea talking about random things, he looked relaxed and happy Tony thinks. The possessiveness flared up again when he saw the collar around Steve’s neck but also when he saw the white gold band around his finger. Steve belonged to him in every way possible and nothing would change that. “Tony next time can we discuss a new way of safe wording beforehand and not when we are about to start?” Steve brought him back to the bedroom.
“Then why don’t wanna do that for yourself?” Tony asks in a soft tone. He could see the panic rising in Steve’s eyes. The anxiety running high in his body, he looked like a caged animal just looking for a way out.
“David, go home and I will call you in the morning al right!? I can’t deal with you when you are like this!” He wished it was the first time he had a drunken argument with David but it wasn’t. Over the last two months they only seemed to fight more and their screaming matches only more intense but Tony always forgave him when he was given breakfast in bed or got flowers  or other gifts from David telling Tony how sorry he was and that he was working on improving himself and he really does want to do better.
His phone started vibrating again and he just assumed it was Bucky so he ignored it until it vibrated again. Letting the curiosity get the better of him he checked and he was surprised and chocked to see Tony’s name on the screen.
After two and half years of working from home Tony could finally rent a real space to have his office in and hire a few people to help him out making further progress to show for his investors who invested more money into his company. Steve was making a name for himself as a lawyer and was trusted with more prominent clients and bigger cases as people saw that he didn’t back down without a fight and would never lose a case.
“Yeah sorry been busy with work and David.” He puts his full focus on David again takes his hand in his.
The shower was running but Tony decide to stay in the bedroom and wait for his husband. He changes out of his jeans and shirt to his t-shirt and sweatpants and sits down on the bed. When Steve finally emerges from the bathroom his skin was pink from the hot shower and his hair dripping. He just stands in the doorway staring at Tony before finally speaking.
“I have no idea what we are doing you know that right?” Steve chuckles as he presses the keyboard slowly. He would never have the speed of Tony but then again Tony would never be able to box or run as he did so they were even.
“That didn’t look like nothing.” Rhodey replies coolly. “But I won’t tell him if you don’t want me to.” He promises and Tony had never been more grateful for Rhodey as he was in this moment.
“Then we will go to the police or we move across the globe to a shit town in Thailand if we have to!” Steve replies seriously and for the first time Steve sees a real smile on Tony’s face. It wasn’t big and it was a bit uncertain but it was definitely a real smile.
“Steve did I mention that David is a lawyer?” Tony tries hoping that it will break the tension between the two. He desperately wanted them to get along.
“Hi. My name is Rachel. May I ask if you are Tony Stark?” She holds out her hand and waits for him to take her well manicured hand. No wedding band he notes.
“I have to go! But it was nice meeting you David!” Steve gives him a smile before he is out the door.
Steve just sighs wanting to believe him but he knows it’s not true. Tony knows what he is offering when he is in a relationship. Tony had admitted once when he was drunk (When else?), that he wanted what Steve gave when he was in a relationship. Being loved and cared for and being encouraged and supported in whatever he choose to do. But the day after he claimed to have no recollection of the night before and it was never spoken of again and that had hurt more than anything else in this world. For the first time he had hoped that maybe that they could have a future but then Tony took the easy way out and that should probably been a sign.
“Good choice.” He let his hand run over the curve of his butt and smack it softly with his hand before going to his entrance and start to slowly pull at the beads for removal but he of course would tease him by pulling it out to the widest part before pushing it back in and taking it out halfway again fucking him softly with the beads. “You like this don’t you?” He questions as he pulls out the first bead and did the same thing with the second bead. The groan of pleasure he got in response was answer enough for Tony who took his sweet time teasing the blonde who was blinded by the pleasure he was feeling through his entire body. Finally he pulled out the second and didn’t even bother teasing him with the last one which Steve was grateful for. Tony’s entered two fingers inside him without problem and then a third pushing his boundary slightly but the groans he received in response told him that Steve did not mind the intrusion then his fingers left him as well and he heard Tony opening something and soon enough he was standing behind him and his loose hole was pushed to it limit when Tony pushed something slick inside him. It hurt he notes but the good kind of hurt. He clenches his teeth and inhales a sharp breath. “Relax sweetheart nothing you haven’t taken before.” Tony assures him. He takes a deep breath and calms down and trusts Tony’s words and relaxes. Before Tony continues to push what he assumed was a butt plug he asks. “Color sweetheart?”
He hears Tony coming into the room, he hears him laying down things on the smaller couch and then he walks again and he sees the black leather shoes in front of his knees. Before he knew it Tony was kneeling in front of him and pulls his chin up carefully and looked at him with kind eyes. He had rolled the sleeves up to his elbows and unbuttoned the top two buttons showing his skin Steve notes. “Sweetheart I need to ask you something and the choice is yours and you are allowed to say no if you are not comfortable with it.” Steve nods waiting for Tony to continue. “My plan for tonight is to blindfold you and use a gag ball on you.” He reaches into his pocket of his slacks and pulls out a steel ball, no bigger than a golf ball. Tony holds it out between them. “You will hold this in your hand and if you want to safe word you just drop this and everything stops.” Tony explains to him in a soft and kind voice. “But if you are not comfortable with that I won’t use the gag ball on you. The choice is yours and there is not a wrong or right answer here. Whatever you are comfortable with.” Tony assures him knowing Steve wanted to go with the answer that pleased Tony the most even if he wasn’t comfortable with it himself.
The first one comes down fast and hard. “One.” The next on the same spot. “Two.” The next two hits come on his thigh. “Three, four.” He gasps at the pain and clenches his teeth. He takes a break. Letting Steve breathe for a second before it landed on him again with a loud clash “Five!”
"I appreciate you stopping by, Howard. It means a lot to me.", Steve told him. "I don't want to keep you away from your family for too long."
“You really don’t see it?” Steve replies trying to remain calm and controlled at his husbands obviousness.
“Why not?! You have never explained fully to me why you don’t want kids!” He demands because in his mind it made no sense why he didn’t want kids of their own. Tony loved to spend time with kids, whenever their friends needed babysitters Tony always said yes no matter if he had other things to attend like board meetings for his business or lectures at different colleges.
It quiet between them. Steve would think he was stupid for thinking he could protect him and laugh at him and David would be right.
“I will hit you thirty times. This will hurt so you don’t have to count today.” He lets out a breath of gratitude that he wasn’t aware he was holding. “Are you ready sweetheart?” Tony questions.
David took a spoonful of ice cream before speaking. “My assistant didn’t send away my contracts that was supposed to go away last week, then I had a client that didn’t show up to an appointment and then my boss yelled at me for not completing the rapports from two weeks ago even though I did and the idiot had misplaced them but of course it was easier to yell at me.” He complains and Tony listens to him and nods and agrees in a humming tone at the appropriate places.
“Yes Sir!” The A.I confirms and Tony makes his way into the kitchen where Steve was putting the finishing touches on the plate of food. He looked up from behind the counter and their eyes met, Steve was definitely hitting subspace, his pupils where wide and he tried to make himself smaller then he actually was. Good luck with that when you are over 6 foot and 200 pounds of muscle.
“Jupp! Married for almost 10 years now. But you knew that since Steve insisted we should send you an invitation to the wedding. He didn’t know what a crap dad you were then.” His voice toxic hoping it would kill Howard or at least make him turn away and leave them the hell alone, like he had been doing for the last 15 years. “Just go and ignore me like you have been my whole life.”
And so, there he was. Steve Rogers. The wonderful and strong Captain America. Worthy of holding Mjölnir. And he still wasn't happy. People adored him. And he didn't care. A year had passed and he still wasn't the same. He wasn't the same Steve Rogers everyone knew. Not even close, really.
An eye roll was all the response he got. “Are you going to tell me why you took me out of my year and made me lose a year of my life?” he asked, and, despite his words, there was no mean or angry tone in his voice. It was almost playful, really.
Tony looked at him and smiled, putting on his sunglasses. “I don’t know, Cap. Look up why 10 roses and you might know.” He smiled, taking his hand and kissing it. With that, he turned and left.
Steve frowned for a moment. “I’m not sure if that’s a really bad threat or a really good promise,” he said, sitting on his bed and looking up at him. He smiled lightly and looked down. “Of course I want you to stay. I didn’t fuck the timeline up for nothing.” Tony leaned against the wall looking at him, arms crossed over his chest. “I told you and I’ll say it again. I love you, and I have for a long time. So, yeah, I do.” Tony smiled. “Oh, shut up. Are you going to sit down or what?”
Tony stayed quiet for a moment. “What do you see when you close your eyes?” He looked at him. “I just need to be sure it won’t be fucked up when everyone is asleep.”
“Or you could tell me why you didn’t go back in time and get married. Oh! Or why you seem to not really care about anything or anyone anymore.” He shrugged. “I could go on. For example-”
“I tried to live that happy life I lost, just like you told me to,” he said after a few moments of silence. He didn’t want to say the wrong thing. “But I couldn’t. The single fact that /you/ told me to, took away that happiness.” Tony frowned, not quite understanding what Steve was saying. He’d figured out that wasn’t the Steve he knew… he knew that much. “I went on the date I missed with Peggy… I managed to stay there for no over two weeks,” he explained.
Steve frowned. Was he messing with him or was that just an awful attempt at flirting? “No, you’re very stupid all the time.”
Steve shook his head lightly, mostly in amusement. “That’s what we all thought when you got engaged, Tony,” he said. He glanced out of the window and sighed, running a hand through his hair. It was pitch black. “You woke up after midnight. Maybe you should sleep,” he said.
As their eyes met, time seemed to stop. And Steve’s heart stopped beating for a moment. He looked around. Time had indeed stopped. It was just the two of them.
Steve couldn’t find words or his voice for a few seconds. All he could seem to do was look at Tony as if he was seeing him for the first time… the only difference was the feeling in his chest. The first time it was anger and near hatred at the other’s arrogance. Now? There was nothing but fear and overwhelming adoration. And he was sure Tony could see it in his eyes.
Steve’s blush darkened as he heard Bucky and a long whine left his throat. And Tony found way too much amusement in the Captain’s reaction. “I mean, I’m not so sure about the fucking… but we could get a room,” he said, raising an eyebrow. Steve stuttered, not sure of what he was supposed to or wanted to say. “I can’t really stand much longer,” he added.
Tony’s eyes widened. “A girlfriend?” he asked, almost in disbelief. Steve nodded with a chuckle. “That poor girl…”
Steve frowned, looking at him. He scoffed. “So you’re making me decide between them and me? Why?” he asked.
“Woah, hey,” Steve said, stopping him from moving anymore. “You’re still hurt badly, try not to move too much.” He looked at him with a look of clear concern. “How are you feeling?” he asked softly.
“I can’t,” he said, keeping his gaze away from Tony’s. “There are so many things wrong, it’s not just you,” he added, trying to convince Tony to let him just… not sleep.
Steve nodded, standing up. “He’s fine. Still not quite over your death, but he’s doing alright. I’m pretty sure he got a girlfriend. He’s not around much, though. I saw him a few days ago, though. He was doing much better than a couple of months ago. But we both avoided the topic,” he said. “Maybe you should see him tomorrow. I’m sure he would be so happy to see you,” he added.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, looking at him for a moment. “I couldn’t let you die. I couldn’t keep going on like this.” Tony frowned, noticing tears in Steve’s eyes.
“Well, it was my choice to save your life. You’re welcome, Stark,” Steve said, shooting him a glare and breaking free from his grip, “And I thought you would stop being a jerk after being saved from death…” he muttered, walking out of the door, pushing past Bucky.
“Don’t be loud, I want to chill,” Bucky called as they walked past his room. “Especially you, Steve, if you don’t want me to never let it go!”
Steve chuckled. “I was asleep for 70 years, I have a lot to catch up on,” he said. He had missed Tony’s dramatic self. “But, to answer your question, Banner is barely around, and neither are the others. After you killed Thanos…” Tony shifted. “They all disbanded. The only ones around are Sam and the kid.”
“We’ll leave you before the battle and you take him here-” Bucky said. He didn’t want Steve to go through any more pain or fighting.
Tony stood right in front of him. Brown eyes almost burning into his icy blue ones. “What do you want?” he asked coldly. Tony, without saying a word, gripped his shirt and pushed him against the wall. He didn’t fight back. It wasn’t forceful enough for it to be fight-worthy… and the look in Tony’s eyes wasn’t violent or even angry.
Bucky frowned and ran a hand through his hair. "You know what I mean," he said. "You haven't left this room in three days. Which means you haven't eaten-"
"You haven't eaten," he repeated. He looked at him. "Look, Steve. Have you even spent a minute with any of them? With Peter or Wanda. Hell, even Sam." Steve looked to the opposite side. "You miss him, I know. But it's not the end of the world. We were gone for five years and you still fought to get us back," he said.
“Hate you?” Steve and Bucky both turned to see Tony, holding himself up against the wall. “No. For years I wished I could.” Steve frowned and rolled his eyes, muttering a quiet ‘great’ and starting to walk away. “Remember when Ultron ran off?” he asked.
Tony scoffed. “Yeah, I’m pretty sure I can go home.” Steve rolled his eyes and raised an eyebrow. “But, oh well, that can wait until tomorrow.” He got closer to Steve, looking down. “Can I ask you something?” he asked, and Steve was sure he’d never seen Tony like that. Avoiding eye contact seemed almost uncharacteristic of Tony Stark.
Steve didn’t understand. Why was Tony being so… aggressive? Sure, it was Tony and they had their moment but they were never alone. And Tony had never gotten so close. Oh, shit-
Bucky looked at him until he was out of sight. Then, he turned to Tony. “Okay, what the hell happened? I haven’t seen him so happy since 1944,” he said. “What did you do?”
Steve turned and walked to him. “Oh, really? Last I checked, everything was about you,” he said. “It doesn’t matter the why. The point is that you’re alive now. Once again, you’re welcome,” he said.
“Thank you.” Steve smiled. “But why 10?” he asked, gently playing with a petal. “I thought a dozen was the usual,” he said with a head tilt. And Tony was oh so happy to have broken his stoic facade.
Bucky bit his lip and grabbed the collar of Steve's shirt and pulled him up, forcing him to sit. "Now you're going to listen very carefully, because I'm not going to repeat it." Steve looked at him with a frown. "He left because that was what he had to do. Tony Stark didn't want to leave. He had a wife and a daughter. He had you. And he died to protect what he had," he said sternly. "So don't even consider thinking whatever self-deprecating thought that may be crossing your mind, okay?"
When he received the diagnose everything seemed like it was on Tony’s side and he would survive it, but then it came back again and again and again until Tony’s once strong body couldn’t handle it anymore and they learned that he would not survive this unless a miracle happened and Steve was willing to travel through space and time trying to find an antidote for this, to heal his husband. But Tony had looked at him with the big brown eyes and just shook his head.
Tony gets up again and runs his hand through the soft blonde hair petting him softly knowing it always calmed Steve down. Tony tugs slightly at the collar and runs his fingers along it feeling protective and possessive of the man at his feet. He looked so beautiful like this, so trusting and loving wanting to do everything in his power to please Tony, sometimes to a fault. Steve hums softly at the treatment indicating that he was gracing just above subspace, it was easy now to get him into that sub mentality but they had struggled in the beginning to get Steve down and not trying to control the situation it probably didn’t help that Tony was insecure about what he was doing. It was laughable now but then he was scared he would really hurt Steve.
’ Tony had explained to him when he had taken him to the doctor to patch him up. His eyes framed by his plucked eyebrows, something Steve had been told was a necessary evil when you have Italian blood running in your veins. His skin had always been flawless; Steve couldn’t recall a single time Tony had a pimple on his face, even in his teenage years. But the thing he adored most about Tony was the eyes that could be coffee colored if he was angry or upset or hazel when he was truly happy and comfortable in his surroundings and it was something he could never get quite right when he was drawing.
“Not just interested they love it! They get disappointed if I am the one babysitting because I can’t do the cool experiments that you can do! Imagine if you would make our kids that inspired.” That makes Tony wince slightly, he had been forced into science and had spent years learning everything he knows today and he is glad knows the things he knows but he hated it when he was younger and would rather been outside playing football or anything else with kids his age. But when he was ten he was doing high school classes in math and science. All so he could take over Stark Industries one day.
“No! Just like I told you last night! I got of at midnight last night and you are here at seven in the morning banging at my door!? Get the fuck out!” Steve ordered the drunk who didn’t move an inch. “Get out or I’ll call the police!” He ads the threat hoping David would just leave and not cause a scene. But Steve should know better then to think that abusive alcoholics will just give up and move on.
“Come for me sweetheart.” That did it for Steve and he lets go and get the release he had been longing for all night and he hears wood breaking. “You broke the fucking desk.” Tony chuckles behind him and Steve barley register it as the waves of pleasure runs through him leaving him a heaving and panting mess. Tony pulls out and somehow gets Steve on his knees, barley knowing what side is up. “Open your mouth sweetheart.” Steve does as he is told and Tony slips his dick inside his mouth and he can taste himself and the lube on Tony.
“Look babe… I can talk to them and make them try harder alright? But it will just be for a few hours tonight and I can stop by after alright?” Tony suggests and the tension seemed to ease up and Tony felt warm and fuzzy again.
Tony received the beating of a lifetime that night. Howards beating the gay out of him, Tony would not be an embarrassment to this family by liking boys over girls. That was not natural and not how nature had intended. He had not screamed nor cried. He had winced but taken the beating like a man should. Like his father wanted him to. He had been warned if he would find Tony with a boy like that again, he would break his bones and Tony didn’t doubt that for a second. He should be glad it was only a belt. The next day he was sent to a boarding school.
“Maybe we should wait with moving in together if you act like this jealous asshole whenever I am not by your side!” Tony shouts at David.
“Just improvements for the next Stark Tablets and an idea for green energy, probably not going to work anyway…” He answers quietly.
“He have a kid you know...” Tony begins. “He never spent any time with him but his ex found me and showed me a picture. I didn’t want to believe her because…” He trails of and stays quiet. It looked like he was trying to explain it to himself in his head. “I honestly don’t know why I wouldn’t believe it. He never said anything about it and he always said his exes where crazy and that they lied and cheated on him constantly.”
“It’s not polite to eavesdrop…” He tries but fails earning him a smile from Steve. Its silence between again and all that is heard is Tony’s heavy breathing. Nothing seemed like the right thing to say in a moment like this.
“The longer I stay here… the worse it will get… he… he…” Tony stutters, tears threating to fall from his eyes. “You.” It made no sense to Steve and Tony knew that. He just didn’t know how to tell his best friend that David had always threatened to hurt Steve if Tony would ever leave him and the fear that his best friend would be hurt or possibly worse because of him was more than he could bare so he could put up with the physical, emotional and sexual abuse from David as long as he knew that Steve was safe. There were a lot of things in this world Tony would put up with as long as he knew that Steve was safe. Through everything that was the one belief that David hadn’t been able to break, that Steve would always be his friend and always be there for Tony no matter what. So instead of trying to break it, it became a threat that if he would ever try leave him or try to tell anyone about their relationship he would go after Steve. And he knew that people would hate him if they found out he was the reason Steve was hurt or dead.
“Are David the one for you Tony? Because it doesn’t feel like he is treating you right.” He admits and Tony looks Steve in the eyes.
“Babe can I talk to you?” He decided to work from home today and thought they could talk about it without the kids around.
Tony sighs he likes to calculate everything sure, but something’s you can’t base on math he had learned that when it came to Steve when he saw no real reason to why he would love Tony so much he just did and they worked together well even though they were polar opposite at times. But somehow they made it work anyway, he was not so headstrong on being right all the time, Steve stopped with his annoying habit of not using the hamper and they both started to admit when they did wrong.
“Good boy.” Tony rubs Steve’s lower back softly and feels soft kisses tracing down his spine. “Color sweetheart?” For a moment Steve thinks he can just say red and everything would stop but he knows that is not fair to Tony who was only doing what Steve had asked for and he knew that Tony would never forgive himself if he thinks he crossed a line or missed Steve’s discomfort completely when in reality he hadn’t.
“I.. oh. I imagined it..” Tony speeds up his motions and ads more pressure. “It was… ah you. Your fingers. Doing exactly wha-ah what they..” He whimpers begging for release he knew wasn’t coming anytime soon. “they are… ahh please Sir?” He begs forgetting what he was talking about. The touches were just too much for him to handle right now. Everything was too much when Tony was in charge.
He could hear when Tony raises the belt and bites his lower lip when it hits the skin. six more to go. Tony hits him again, two in a row this time. Only four to go he got this, he tells himself, he cries out in surprise as the next one hits him unexpectedly. Three. Tony was there again with his cooling hand and soothing motions. Only three left he thinks again and he knows Tony he will drag them out and hit as hard as he possibly can. His butt feels like it on fire and all he wants is something cold on it to soothe it. One hit came down. Just two to go, it was nothing yet it felt like it was so far from being over.
“Will do Sir.” He sighs and waits for his husband to up to his getaway. It didn’t take long before Steve was in his lab and was sitting on the edge of the desk and start to play with Tony’s hair waiting for an explanation.
“Can the three of you shut it! I don’t want this in tomorrows paper!” Tony hisses at them and stops in front of them. “Happy can you just take me home? I need to rest apparently.”
Steve thinks for a moment. “It was a lot.. but in a good way.. you know…” He gets out not wanting to leave the crook of Tony’s neck. He was so warm and so safe.
“If you had told me what was going on I could have helped you to get away from David--” Tony interrupted him.
“Looks like it.” Tony chuckles. “Maybe we can meet for lunch for tomorrow? Since you are in town?” Tony asks his friend. With him being in the marines it was too long between seeing each other and he was never certain if he would see him again. So when he was in town they made sure to see each other as much as possible. “I could bring David.” He suggests.
“Yeah it is…” He types away at the phone not answering him fully before looking up again. “Is it okay if he comes here? He would like to meet you.” Tony questions and what is he supposed to say to that? If he say yes he have to see them act all lovey dovey and if he says no he knows Tony will be upset and think he isn’t even trying to get to know David, which he isn’t and he wanted to be selfish and be with Tony alone.
I finally got this done! I struggled so much with this chapter! But I hope you enjoy it even though its unbeated!
“Yeah in here.” He replies and gets up from their bed he had been sitting on wiping his tears away. “You are home early.” He ads before kissing David quickly.
David had followed Tony home to his penthouse and they both knew what was coming and Tony couldn’t be more excited about it. He had David pressed up against the wall with his shirt and jacket forgotten somewhere. He kissed and sucked wherever he could reach and let his hands wander over his bare upper body, earning sounds of pleasure from David whenever he hit a good spot. His hands wanders lower and cup his cock outside his pants. “Someone is excited…” Tony teases and press soft kisses along his jawline.
He swallows the food and look up at Tony before answering. “Yes sir.” Steve hoped that Tony wouldn’t find out about him touching himself. He didn’t need to know everything he did. “Actually…” He begins but his voice betrays him.
He knows that both him and Steve are just looking out for him and just wants what’s best for him. But he also knows that David get upset for small things sense people had betrayed him in the past and was worried that Tony would cheat on him, so Tony just had to stick it out for a while until their relationship was more stable and David would see that he could trust Tony and that he wouldn’t cheat on him with Steve. It would just take a little while, that’s all.
“Tony!” Steve shouts over the back yard when he sees the brunette, excited to actually see his friend  in person again. The grip on his wrist tighten again.
“Yeah it was delicious thank you.” Tony replies and it’s quiet between them not knowing how to breech the subject.
“Go get him tiger!” Steve fakes a smile as Tony moves over to the older man hoping and praying that he is married or straight or just not interested in Tony! But who was he kidding? The brunette was perfect! He finishes his drink and decides to leave he really didn’t have to watch this! He was not a masochist!
That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. In David’s mind at least and that was the first time he hit Tony intentionally. The hand hit Tony’s cheek and the smacking sound echoed in the quiet room. Tony looked at David chocked and scared as he waited for the apology from David he was certain would come.
“No of course not! But the kids are soon leaving for college and I will be home alone all day and I will have no purpose with my life.” He explains. “When the kids were younger they needed me for everything and they were my life and my purpose!”
“That is not true…” He tugs at the ends of his hoodie hiding his hands in them. To hide the bruises on his arms and wrist, Steve realize when he catch a glint of purple under the hoodie. “I can never do anything right and I am never home enough to make sure he is okay.” He murmurs. “It can’t be easy living with someone like me you know.” He was going back to self-blame. Even though he had done nothing wrong.
“Yes it is! You have been working a month and since you began everything fell on me even though I also work and I probably work more hours than you do!” Tony was screaming at this point. “I will be at SI! I’ll call you later!” Steve doesn’t say anything he just watches as his husband walks out the door. He doesn’t even try to stop Tony because he realizes that Tony is right.
“Then you shouldn’t have wasted your time. I have nothing to say to you.” He was staring into the brown eye’s he had inherited from his dad and was glad it was the only thing he had gotten from the man in front of him. He felt someone hug his leg looking down he saw the blonde hair belonging to his daughter; he lifts her up and let her rest on his hip.
Steve was kneeling beside him, but not the comfortable version where he leans back on his feet and rests his hands in his lap while looking down. No he was kneeling straight up and resting straight on his knee caps, a stress position he thought distantly. People used it as a torture method, because it hurt like hell. Of course Steve was not like most people and could handle the pain. But even he was struggling after an hour in this position and Tony’s gentle hand running through his hair and down to the nape of his neck didn’t help the situation. Slowly he was leaning back trying to ease the tension in his knees and legs but was quickly yanked up again by his hair and he winced slightly at the pain but was back in his original position. Tony hadn’t even broken his focus from the tablet and continued to pet Steve’s hair and neck.
“Yeah rub it in my face that you are given a company without any work and you build toys as a living! Unlike me who have worked for everything I have and is still in the same position I have been in for the last four years because my idiot boss promote idiots before me!” He threw the glass across the room making it shatter as it hit the wall.
Second chapter! *Hide under bed again* Super nervous but I hope you like it and comment and kudos make me happy!
“No David you need to leave. You are not welcome here.” David tried to make himself look bigger then Steve even though David was a couple inches shorter then Steve but a bit broader but that didn’t help though because Steve wasn’t scared of David and he would punch him if he had to. Luckily though his neighbors seemed to be disturbed as well from the noise David was making so early in the morning and had called the police and took him away.
Steve was very emotional, he knew this, but he hadn't intended toto scare Tony. Apologizing seemed like it was necessary. Hearing those words Tony smiled brightly and kicked happily. He obviously forgave his godfather. Seeing Tony happy put a smile onto Steves face. It's was adorable to see the little one's smile.
The sun was just beginning to rise above the hospital and it was already warm for late May, but not too hot.
Steve sighed. Maybe he needed to talk in order to get over with it. "Yes... You know I came from the year 2023. At this point I knew Tony for about ten years already. First, we were just friends. Well actually during our first mission, we hated each other. But over the years we grew closer and closer. Right before out last mission... Tony proposed. I was the happiest man on earth... but... Tony sacrificed himself to save the universe..."
"I will.", Howard promised. "He said he'll be okay, but I'll check. He really must feel terrible. Imaging seeing your true love die in your arms and now seeing them again with no chance of a love relationship. And even worse: them not remembering anything."
"I'm alright. But what about you?" Steve could heare the worried tone in the other man's voice. He contemplated on whether or not he should tell the truth. He sighed and gave in.
As he regnized Howards voice, he looked up and walked over to the door. Quickly wipping his tears he opened the door and greeted his friend.
"Yes, this is little Tony.", Maria said softly watching as Steve stroked her sons cheek. Tony opened his eyes after a moment and stared up at Steve with a curios gaze before grabbing his finger with his tiny hand. Now Steve couldn't hold back. He completely broke down and cried. That scared Tony so much he started to cry as well. Both Maria and Howard had a look of concern on their faces and as Maria tried to calm Tony, Howard tried to calm Steve.
It was the first day since five years Steve was smiling again. Even though he tried and relive most of the life he das spent in the ice, he could not enjoy a single thing. Already five years had passed since Steve lost the love of his life, Tony Stark. They were engaged anas had planned to get married after Thanos would be defeated. But instead Steve had to watch his fiancé sacrifice himself to save the universe. It had been the worst moments of Steves life. THey might have won the war, but he lost everything. Not even his best friend Bucky gave him enough reason to stay. So he travelled back in time to the year 1965 looking for all his former friends he knew from his first time being Captain America during WW2; Howard Stark, Peggy Carter and his teammates from the Howling Commandos. But in those five years he had spent with them someone important was still missing. Until May 29 1970.
"Steve, what's wrong?", he asked, wondering why his best friend was crying. It didn't seem like tears of happiness, but more of anguish.
"Exactly. I wanted to spend as much time with him as possible. Even though seing him grow up will eliminate my chances of having him as my boyfriend." Steve wasn't sure if saying something like this was too weird to talk about.
"Good." Maria handed her son to Steve while Howard was preparing a bottle. "Make sure to support his head poperly.", she told the former supersoldier. Steve gently took Tony in his arms making sure to follow Marias words ans support the newborns head properly. He could feel the familiar sensation of his chest tightening and his eyes watering, but he did his best to ignore it. Instead, he looked down and smiled at the little one in his arms while the baby looked up at him curiously.
"Thank you for coming by, Steve. You're always welcome to visit us. We'll be heading home soon.", Maria replied with a smile her husband had on face as well.
"Oh, that's terrible!" No wonder Steve had broken down. It was painful. She couldn't imagine how he felt. She herself couldn't imagine loosing her son.
"Yes, please do, Howard. I'll be waiting here for the doctor to discuss when they'll release me and Tony."
"Oh, you're tired, Tony? Good night then.", Steve told his godson before turning to Howard and Maria.
Steve had been staring down at the photo of him and Tony. Tears were rolling doen his face when he heard the doorbell ring.
Suddenly they heard Tony whine in his mothers arms. Steve instantly looked over to his crying godson wondering what had upset the newborn.
"Yes... It's unbelieveable. I saw him die in my arms and now I can see him grow up. I just miss him so much...", Steve aswered with tears leaving his eyes.
"You didn't cause any trouble. I understand you're sad. How about you tell me something about your time with Tony? Maybe this helps."
"Do you want to go outside and get some fresh air? I can join you if oyu want.", Howard offered. Perhaps fresh air would do Steve some good. He knew the other needed to regather his thoughts.
"Thank you, Howard. You're a good friend. I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused. Your son was just born. Today should be a day filled with happiness."
"Yes, we can hold the bottle together.", Steve told his godson while holding the bottle together with him. Kicking his little legs happily, Tony moved one of his hands over to Steve'S tryinbg to grab one of the huge fingers. Steves smile only grew more when he felt the little hand touching his finger again. He could already feel the connection between them. Not a romantic connection like some years ago - thank god for that - but more a connection like father and son or simply Steve having to protect little Tony.
Howard placed his hand on Steves shoulder, noticing the change in his voice, wanting to comfort his friend. "Keep that photo close to your heart.", Howard advised.
"Alright.", Maria replied with a nod. "But take your time and make sure Steve is okay. I'll stay here anyway."
The whole time Maria and Howard smiled at the sight, watching as Steve and Tony bonded. Once the newborn had finished eating, he closed his eyes, giving a small yawn.
"Of course. I'd love to see.", Howard replied. He was curious and definetly wanted to see the photo. "As long as you wish to share it, Steve."
"I understand. You'll have plenty of time to spend with him.", Howard assured Steve, "However, how will it affect you, Steve? With not having him as a boyfriend? Will you be okay?"
Even though Steve had told them about the whole time travelling thing, they all had agreed that Steve shoould keep everything about the future secret not wanting to destroy the timelines more than he already did.
"He knew back in the future. Tsey were in love and Steve had to watch him die.", Howard explained. Maria was caught off guard by those words.
"A beer sounds nice.", Steve admitted eventhough he couldn't get drunk or anything near it. "We can discuss a day to go. And I'll keep that in mind, I'll be sure to visit."
"Oh I can imagine." Howard knew what Steve was implying with what he just said but he definetly didn't want to hear any more details.
Steve nodded and took the photo out of his pocket. It showed Steve and Tony back in 2023 cuddling and kissing on their bed. Howard looked down at the photo curiously and smiled. It was a sweet moment that had been captured and the love was clear in both of their eyes.
"So that's why you call me in the middle of the night? It's almost 3. But yes, of course I'm coming.", Steve laughed. Howard had called him from the hospital. He and his wife Maria were expecting their first child and had asked Steve to become godfather of the little boy they were going to name Anthony Edward Stark; or just Tony, to keep it short.
"Maybe.", Steve agreed thinking about a moment with Tony that was filled with happiness. "Well, there was that one time. I had decided to show Tony how to make my mother's homemade apple pie and he agreed. He really wanted to learn the recipe. We ended up making making a mess, well Tony did anyway. Whipped cream was everywhere. I wonder if Tony did that on purpose; judt to have fun."
"He was.", Steve agreed smiling as well. "We even had whipped cream on ourselves , you know. That was definetly one of the funniest days we had spent together."
Steve smiled hearing those words. "I'm so happy to hear that. You know what? I keep a photo of us with me all the time. Do you want ot see it?"
“It’s good. We are going to focus more on green energy and make it affordable as well as a robotics division so everyone can have their own DUM-E at home!” He informs him with a chuckle. “I am also looking into to expand our intern programs and possibilities to give out more scholarships to those who want a future in engineering or science based in general but can’t afford it.” It warms Steve’s heart how kind and giving Tony was. Not many were allowed to see this side of him and Steve felt special knowing he was one of the lucky few. “And dad will officially retire at the end of the year and will have a big party with the whole shebang! You should totally come!” He informs Steve.
“Of course, there is no rush. And it doesn’t matter what your answer is.. I still love you.” He lean in and press his lips to his forehead. “I am going to let you work now.” He rises slightly from the desk but Tony takes his hand making them face each other.
The paddle land hard on him making his burning butt burn even more and he waits just a second before the next one hits his butt again. “Twelve, thirteen.” Only two to go he motivates himself he could do this. He could feel the anticipation in the air just waiting for the paddle to land on him again. Smack! Tony must use all the strength he has left because that one hurt really badly. “fourteen..” He grits out and he waits again for the final blow which came down hard on his butt causing him almost to scream but he holds it in. “Fifteen!” He pants out and was glad for the support the table gave him otherwise he would have fallen down he is certain of it.
He should say something he knows that but he doesn’t know what. So instead he just leaves. Still hearing his mother crying and father screaming as he moves further away from the party. The car was still here and he got in the backseat.
He sighs. He had already decided to spend the night at David’s place. Maybe he could convince David to come out for just a few hours and see his friends. Or Tony could see his friends and maybe David could go out with his own, it could probably be good for them to miss each other for the night and it had been awhile since he had seen his friend without David. He decides to call David at once knowing he was bad at answering text.
“Want to share a cab?” Steve wonders. “I have a morning shift tomorrow anyway so I should get going as well.”
He thinks to himself but smile when he joins them at the table. “Hi! I am Steve, Tony’s best friend!” He holds out his hand for David to take it.
“So how long have you and Steve known each other?” David suddenly asks looking up from his carbonara. Tony finishes chewing and takes another sip of wine before answering.
“I don’t want to forget how he smelled like, how he talked or looked. What if I forget about him? I already have trouble remembering his laugh!” He is upset and hurt. The memory of his husband was slipping away from him.
This secret relationship went on for almost 6 months before Howard found them in the kitchen. Tony was sitting on the counter with his hands in Shawn’s hair pulling him closer and Shawn was between his legs, hands under his shirt feeling the smooth skin. Howard had given Tony that look that he just knew he was in big trouble. Shawn was asked to leave and Tony had just looked down on the floor scared for what about to come. Reluctantly Shawn had left his young lover in the kitchen and walked out of the Stark mansion and would never see Tony again.
“I know baby… Its okay. We will figure this out.” Tony promise him. “But from now on I need to work more since I am taking over the company.” He saw David’s eyes darken at this. It was everything from jealousy of Tony getting a position he could only dream of to feeling angry of not being able to control Tony all day. The grip on Tony’s wrist tighten and he was certain it would bruise. “Not here!” Tony hisses. The grip doesn’t loosen but Tony smiles as people pass them by.
Tony no longer had that spark he once wore. That winning smile and that hopeful look in his eyes. In fact, he never spoke of his own thoughts anymore. It was well and truly gone.
Tony as his omega. In society they would be recognized as alpha and omega, their bonding marks proud and displayed on their necks, their bodies joined by an unbreakable bond that would be clear to all.
“Anything. Everything.” Tony sighed and his lips curved up a little at what Steve guessed was the memory of another life. “I always imagined I’d build things. Like my father did.”
Tony had become more attuned to his needs. As a concubine he was also becoming more confident. Steve noticed there was a marked change in his behavior as compared to their first night. On the first night, Tony had been more hesitant. Or simply put, less experienced.
“It was brilliant. We were able to talk about so much! I only wish we could have continued.” Tony said eagerly but then stopped and looked a little sad as he faced the ground.
When Steve collected his bundle, he turned and made to speak only to meet the sight of Tony dropping his head into his hands. Then to Steve’s absolute horror, Tony began to cry.
Tony’s head jerked up at that and Obadiah seemed just as stunned. Steve kept his face as stoic as possible, not wanting to reveal how uncomfortable the interaction truly made him feel.
“Hey, shhhh, what-what’s wrong?” Steve asked, barely able to comprehend the sobs coming out of Tony’s mouth. What on earth could have been the matter?
“Obadiah, my lord. Obadiah Stane.” The man replied, looking positively thrilled. Calm, Steve nodded and pointed at the omega.
“For your happiness, my lord. Should you ever wish for my company, please do not hesitate to speak to my handler.”
Tony’s face paled at the words and he seemed to look accusingly at the tea, almost as if it was poisoned.
At the front door, Obadiah reached for Tony and greeted Steve with a gleeful smile. “How was he then? Did you enjoy him?”
“I am sorry.” Steve began the next day, as soon as they woke up the next morning. Tony was curled against him, their bodies loose and warm after a night of excitement.
Frozen with something akin to fear, Steve dropped the bundle instantly and rushed forward. Guided by instinct, he stood in front of the weeping omega and pulled him close, wrapping him tightly in his arms.
Just as Steve was about to clasp Tony’s shoulder and intervene, he noticed Tony’s expression and stopped. There was something there in the pain in his eyes. Something so deep and raw and lost in Tony’s eyes that Steve almost wanted to pull him aside.
He was loath to admit he still felt some remorse for what he’d said the night before. It hadn’t been the kindest thing and Tony had been much quieter after.
Who has done this to you?” Steve demanded suddenly, pushing himself up and looking Tony in the eye, a sudden rage taking over.
The room went silent, almost frigid. Tony said nothing. He simply stared at Steve in complete silence.
Omegas were meant to remain pure and true to one alpha. It was the purest and most respected part of society-the union of an alpha and omega. A pure bonding. While most alphas and omegas ran households together, there were even some omegas who wished to be the main member of the household-born to lead, even with an alpha bond in place.
The boy shrugged. “Dunno… they called early this morning and said to bring you these roses,” he said.
“No, Tony, I can’t. It’s not that simple.” Steve couldn’t quite understand Tony in general, but now… he really couldn’t understand anything. Why was he like that?
Bucky shrugged. “If we disappear, you’ll know,” he said, trying to ease the tension. He pulled Steve into a hug. “We’ll be here, buddy,” he reassured.
“No, if we do that, there’ll be no saving to humanity. I’ll go back before he died. I’ll figure it out from there,” Bucky and Bruce exchanged a look. “Please be here when I get back.”
Steve looked at him and grabbed his wrist. “Before you go,” he said. “What are we, Tony?” he asked with a slight frown.
“I fucking love you, and you still haven’t realized how much.” Steve sighed, only to hear a quiet ‘language’ from Tony. He rolled his eyes. “But sure. You’re alive, you can go back and live your life.”
Thoughts raced through Steve’s mind, loud and chaotic. And, suddenly, everything went quiet for a moment. It wasn’t for long, but it was long enough to realize that Tony was kissing him.
“Uh… it’s a long story…” he said, rubbing the back of his neck and looking around. Tony frowned lightly. “Technically, it’s been four days…” Tony raised an eyebrow, confused by that ‘technically’. “But, uhm… well, to you, it’s been about a year and two months,” he added, looking away.
“Do you know what I saw?” he asked, looking at Steve, who stopped walking as if he were waiting for an answer. “I saw you… the others, too, but it didn’t feel the same.” Steve turned to him, not saying anything. “You were dying, right in front of my eyes. And I couldn’t do anything. You said I could’ve saved you…” he said, unsure of what Steve’s reaction would be.
Tony scoffed. “We both know that’s not the reason why you did it,” he called, seeing Steve tense up. “I’m not that oblivious, Cap,” he said, taking a few steps closer.
As soon as they walked into Steve’s room, Tony shut the door. “Well, so you want me to stay?” he asked, looking at him smugly. Steve looked at him and rolled his eyes before getting kissed once again briefly. “I’ll keep doing it until you answer.”
“Where did you come from?” Tony asked, turning to him. Hearing his voice made Steve’s throat tighten as tears threatened to come out, but he didn’t respond. He just walked closer to him as Tony spoke again. “And why?”
He slowly stood up from his spot on the floor. “Tony…?” Steve’s voice was quiet, he didn’t want to startle Tony. But he didn’t even know if he could hear him.
When Steve realized what was happening, it too late to process. They were mad at each other, right? Was that a new flirting thing now? Had even the flirting changed? Either way, they were mad at each other just a minute ago… so why was Tony suddenly two inches away and getting closer? And, if he was really mad at Tony, why was he allowing him to be that close and effortlessly pin him to the wall?
Tony and Steve exchanged a look that Bucky could clearly read. “Lack of sleep,” Tony said nonchalantly as he started the coffee maker. The doorbell rang and Steve and Bucky looked at each other, slightly confused. “Steve, you should get that,” he said with an innocent smile that looked everything but innocent. Steve went to argue, but Tony spoke again. “I’m dead for the next couple of hours.”
Just as Steve went to kiss back, Tony stepped back, looking at him. “It depends on you if I live my life or not,” he said, barely managing to stand.
Tony frowned. “Get your ass here right now,” he said. Steve looked at him for a moment and turned, starting to walk away. “Steve!” he called, making Steve stop in his tracks. “Come here, we’re not done.”
“Cap…” he started, trying his very best not to sound harsh. “I was meant to die for the sake of the world. It was my choice, not yours,” he hissed.
Tony frowned. “I’m not sure if that’s supposed to make me feel better, but it’s not… it’s really not,” he said. He stood up and walked closer to him. “I’m here now. You don’t have anything to fear.” Steve looked at him. “Everyone is alright. You took me back from the dead! You’ll be fine, I know that. But not if you keep pushing yourself to pull all nighters,” he said. He gently moved his hand to cup Steve’s cheek. “Try. At the very least, try to get some rest, you may be surprised.” As he spoke, Steve’s gaze dropped to the floor.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Maybe you should, too, Cap,” he said, looking at him. “You said you barely sleep anymore.” Steve rolled his eyes. “I won’t sleep if you don’t even try,” he said.
Tony raised an eyebrow as he stood less than a foot away. “Yeah? What’s going through the oh so stoic Captain Rogers’ head?” he asked with a smirk. “Did I melt the facade?” He fake pouted, getting even closer.
Steve opened the door and frowned lightly, blinking in confusion at the teen that stood outside the door. “Um… can I help you?” he asked when the boy hadn’t spoken in a few seconds.
“Look it up on Google, I have about two minutes before the world knows I’m alive, so I’m gonna head home. I’ll see you later.” He smiled, kissing his cheek and walking out as he opened the door.
It was quiet in the Avengers' facility. It'd been a year since they'd defeated Thanos... but at what cost? Would it have been better if they hadn't played with time? If they had just left things the way they were after killing Thanos? Was getting the others back worth losing Tony? For most of them, sure. A small sacrifice for the greater good, even if it hurt them. To Steve, absolutely not. It wasn't worth it because all it gave him was Bucky and Sam. And Steve really didn't understand why Tony had sacrificed himself without previous warning.
Bucky woke up to no screams that morning. Instead, he could hear soft and gentle talking downstairs. Well, that was new...
Steve’s gaze dropped to Tony’s hand. “Over a year. I took you back a year into the future,” he said.
“No. You’re the one who doesn’t understand.” He looked away from Steve, focusing on the battle. “The world’s fate is quite literally in my hands.” Steve stepped closer. He knew Tony well enough to know what would come next. Even after spending five years apart and after a year since Tony’s death.
"But I do," Bucky said, walking down the stairs. "I'll go and beat your ass if you don't come back." Steve rolled his eyes but scoffed dryly. "You go and bring him here. You don't stay. We've been separated way too many times, I won't take another."
"I need to bring Tony back," he answered, looking at the rebuilt time machine. "We got that back for a reason, Bruce," he said as he saw Bruce was about to argue. "I don't care if I don't come back. I have to try," he added.
Bruce looked up from the papers he was looking at. "Cap, hey. You seem to be doing better," he said with a smile. "What do you need?" he asked, looking at him as Steve walked closer to him.
Steve nodded, looking at him. “I was counting on that,” he said. “Of course they’ll know. I’ll talk to them tomorrow. Have them come over here or have you go there. They live in the same place, so you should know how to get there.”
Steve stopped and bit his lip, not moving for a few moments. And then, he turned. And he was met with the most beautiful sight in the entire universe.
Steve looked at him. "Why? He's gone, and there's nothing I can do to change the past..." His eyes widened for a moment and, for the first time in a year, Bucky could see a spark light up in his eyes. "What if I could?" he asked.
“Because I love you, okay?!” Steve snapped “Because I have been laying on my bed for a year doing nothing but think about you and about why you died! Because I have been in love with you for seven years and had to put up with your death!”
Tony looked around, not noticing Steve at first. He was beyond confused. Last he knew, the facility was destroyed and he was near death. How-? He sat up quickly, letting out a groan of pain.
“No,” Bruce said. “That will mess up the entire timeline.” Bucky and Steve frowned. Bucky giving him a look, begging not to bring Steve down. “It’s dangerous.”
Tony shook his head. “Nope. I’m very stupid right now. You’ll have to tell me,” he said with the tiniest hint of a smirk.
“He hates me, that’s what happened,” he said, turning to look at Bucky, in a mix of anger and bitterness. “So, yes. We’re back to that-”
Tony frowned. “You seemed quite alright with it a moment ago,” he said. “Not to mention I’m quite literally dead to them. I’ve been wanting this for a while now. I know what I’m doing.”
Tony looked at him. “What was that?” he asked. “I’m not sure I heard you right.” Steve stepped back, only to be stopped when Tony grabbed his wrist. “How long has it been since the battle?”
“Ah, here they are.” Tony smiled, popping out of the door beside Steve. “Thanks, kid,” he said, glancing at Steve and then at the bouquet in the blond’s hand. The teen gasped as he saw Tony. He pulled out a $100 bill and handed it to the delivery guy. “Keep the change,” he said, closing the door. He turned to Steve with a smirk. “It looked like you needed a rescue,” he said with a chuckle.
Steve looked away, pushing him away gently so he wouldn’t fall. “God, Tony, of course I want you to stay. You’re dead anyway, what people don’t know can’t hurt them. But I can’t keep you here.” Tony raised an eyebrow, looking at him.
“I know you like to tinker, or at least you would like to. I know you can play the piano beautifully. I know you’re a very curious omega who likes to talk. I know you’re a kind person who just wants to be happy. I know you’re brave-“ Tony looked up sharply at that but Steve carried on, holding that gaze with an iron fist. “I know you want nothing more than to be free.”
“I’m surprised.” Tony said, keeping his voice low, almost as if to not disturb the moment. “I never would have imagined you would know how to tie a corset.”
“You are not a concubine. And you...you need protection.” And love. Love and care that Steve wished to provide. “I can give that to you. Allow me to claim you. Let me provide for you.”
“Please don’t say these things.” Tony whispered, looking down with heated cheeks. “It only upsets me. Please don’t lie like that.”
“Tony.” Steve said that morning as he watched Tony get up from the bed and begin to put on his plain white long shirt that Steve had given him a few weeks ago. “May I ask you something?”
“But...what?” Tony blinked, sounding dazed  and before Steve could stop himself, he reached out and pulled Tony into his arms, hands warm and firm as he held Tony close and didn’t let go.
“Mmmm.” Tony hummed and shifted a little closer to let his skirt settle over them. “I suppose I am.”
“You only hurt me when you say it. You don’t understand but I am never going to leave. Obie will never allow it. In fact, if he found out you tried to bond me, you would never hear from me again and I-“
“It’s a bad idea.” Tony sighed and squirmed out of Steve’s hold. After being released, Tony made his way to the collection of clothes.
Tony didn’t say anything. He simply continued to cry, the only noise in the room the faint sounds of his sobs and the slight hitches of his breath. If Steve had not been present, he would never have noticed.
That was until today, of course. It had been three weeks since their initial agreement and for the first time, Steve noticed something else. Something
The land had come to his attention following Bucky’s death. He’d been in search of a new business proposition in the hopes that it would have him removed from his home estate that was filled with the memories of his closest brother in arms. After leaving behind his life as an owner to the local farms, he’d quickly begun to make his fortune in bigger, further lands and had been told of the recently vacated home in a small town called Manhattan. It hadn’t been long before he’d taken his young alpha and beta farmers and set sail for this new land. And all had been well since.
“You should sleep. You look tired so rest tonight. Obadiah can have you collected later in the morning.” Steve said, keeping his voice hushed as he guided Tony to sit on the edge of the bed. In the moonlight, Tony looked even more exhausted than before and a faint gleam on his cheeks caught Steve’s eye.
So in turn, Steve found himself beginning to ease his behavior. He started to ask Tony to simply lie with him instead. They did not need to do more all the time.
It was different this time. Tony was not curled around him and giving him his body and his time. Steve was covering him and making him the center. And he was.
“Well it’s been a while.” Tony said plainly but narrowed his eyes as Steve came even closer. “What are you doing?”
The omega was thin, so thin, his ribs were beginning to show. His skin had paled considerably as compared to when Steve had first seen him and there were dark shadows under his eyes that even under the powdered makeup, Steve could see were deep in his skin. But the worst thing of all, was perhaps the very thing Steve had become so familiar with.
“Do you remember what I said to you the other night?” Steve said lowly, coming close enough to be just inches away. Tony continued to stare at him, eyes wide and very dark.
“Do you feel well? You seem tired.” Steve instantly wished he hadn’t said it because as soon as he did, Tony’s smile dropped. The misery was there, it was just hidden away, tucked under the surface but close to the heart. And that hurt even more.
Tony’s body was littered with marks. Bruises of fading colors and the teeth marks that Steve had first seen last week seemed to have taken hold of him in such a way that Steve could picture him being held down. Even with the make up on his skin they were visible and not so easily hidden anymore. In the back of his mind, he wondered just how much they had hurt when they’d first pierced his skin.
Had anyone touched Tony with kindness? Had held him and kissed him and told him how beautiful he was out of love rather than lust?
“As I said my lord. It is good to see you.” Tony said bleakly and smiled wanly as realization dawned on Rhodes face. “Should you ever wish for my company, please do not hesitate to speak to my handler.”
Light footsteps padded on the wooden floor. As soon as Tony came into sight, Steve looked up and beamed.
“Why-“ Tony purred, and began to step closer, the material of his skirt brushing his legs gently. “I am told I am very skilled. It would be an honour to pleasure you, my lord.”
Was Tony facing his heat? Was that the problem, unlikely as it was with the suppressants being started again.
“I am available for your use my lord. I am always available. As was always going to be my fate. You only need to say.”
Using his grip, Steve sharply spun Tony around and pulled him close, leaning down to level him with a firm look.
“Everyone be silent.” Steve said calmly and lowered his hand as he eyed the two newcomers suspiciously. “Why would you suggest such a thing? I have no interest in that practice here.”
“It doesn’t mean that is right. I will never speak to you that way again and if I do, you have full permission to slap me as I deserved.”
Steve had not had someone unknown approach him for some time. In light of recent events, he truly hadn’t expected it.
Steve hated those days. He despised them, especially now that he knew Tony hadn’t been on suppressants. Tony would not be with him and it was not just that. Tony often came back with more marks than before.
The omega was beautiful. Every detail, even down to the fine, clearly carefully styled facial hair was beautiful. He was truly a treasure.
“Alpha, will you come with me?” Tony smiled eagerly and this time, Steve gave him the warmest smile he could. He would never turn down Tony’s smile again.
“Lord Rogers.” He said, collecting the wet bundle of clothing and pushing himself up onto his feet. “What are you
“I know.” Tony smiled a little, only there was a strange feeling Steve couldn’t shake. As if something was wrong. Like looking at the jagged edges of roughened glass.
“Your tea. The way you hold the cup and hold yourself. Even the way you cross your legs. It’s obvious.” Steve explained, watching the dawning realization on Tony’s face. “Only an omega born into a noble family would sit in such a way. You have been trained in courtroom behavior.”
“Of course.” Tony smirked and then frowned. Probably because he was doing a poor job of hiding his grimace. “Is that...is that not what you want?”
And really that was what it came down to. Tony was his concubine. Steve was the alpha. The alpha of the night that would use him and hurt him-
“Why are you here?” Steve said in a low voice that spoke volumes. Still, the omega merely smirked and looked up.
Steve’s whole chest rumbled with pleasure. Tony hummed against him as their kiss grew more heated. Their tongues brushed and curled and licked and sucked. And Steve tasted every part of Tony’s mouth.
Momentarily subdued, Tony said nothing. Then he simply shook his head and looked up at Steve uncertainly, the earlier confidence wavering.
“What a beautiful omega! My, Fury, isn’t he wonderful!?” Lady Sharon, wife to one of the local wealthy tailors said delightedly. Nicholas Fury, the stoic mayor of the simply raised a brow.
Taking vigil, Steve settled in his seat and called for the ale. In the distance, he could see Tony smiling.
“Several.” Tony said and finally sighed, the fire leaving his eyes. His shoulders dropped and he withdrew once again, but Steve had seen all he needed to see.
For the first time ever, Tony looked so broken. Like his heart had been torn from his chest and ripped into two. Like someone had told him he’d never find happiness or would never see the light of day again. He looked so miserable and so upset it broke Steve’s heart.
As the door clicked shut, Steve straightened his coat and took a deep breath. He’d put on his best clothes for the occasion, a nice blue vest with a white undershirt, dark slacks and a nice long blue coat with detailed embroidery at the cuffs. He had to look presentable for what he had planned for the night.
Carefully, Tony moved away from Steve and settled onto his back. Then, as Steve reached over and lined their bodies up, Tony shivered under him and waited for Steve to climb over him and enclose him completely.
Tony fell silent and for a moment Steve wondered if he had finally been blessed with peace. But he was not so lucky.
"I suppose it depends on what you define as my needs." Tony pondered, tilting his head in thought. "He is my handler. I have a home, it is just not like this. It would be nice to watch the stars at night sometimes or maybe be allowed to craft something but..."
"You're his child are you not? Howard Stark was the owner of this manor. Rhodes told me." Steve added as realization dawned on Tony's face. Hi body trembled but he continued to listen to Steve's words.
