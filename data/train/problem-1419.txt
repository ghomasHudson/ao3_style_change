They stepped outside, as Sebastian continued to hold Sherlock. An uneasy feeling tied itself around the nurse’s gut, as he tried to concentrate on putting his feet in front of himself while Seb steered them away from the bar.
Then a shout of cheers erupted as a bell rung furiously. Sherlock tensed, unable to look away from the fight any longer. He yanked his head out of Seb’s grip, twisting in his grasp as he finally took in the sight of the younger boxer standing victorious above the other one. His bruised chest was panting, his eyes still glued to his opponent with menace as bloodied saliva dripped off his chin.
He instantly felt trapped, as Sherlock tried to pry Seb’s hands away from his body. “Come on.” Seb grunted, slipping a hand down the front of his boyfriend’s jeans. Sherlock was panicking, wondering if he was hallucinating, maybe there was something in the cheap beer. Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed a beautiful pink, bringing out the fear in his dark eyes. His messy hair was draped over his forehead, as the column of his throat peeked out of his shirt. Sebastian was mesmerised by the sight, sucking kisses over his throat and circling his hand around Sherlock’s soft dick. “So beautiful.” Seb breathed in between kisses.
John continued staring at the bewildered boy, half terrified and intrigued. He understood exactly how the stranger felt, he had been left in the streets, feeling lost and confused many times before, but had never had someone worry over him. He cautiously pulled out his phone, tossing up the idea of calling an ambulance. It wouldn’t look good if an underground boxer was seen loading someone into an ambulance. A splash of blood landed on the glass of his phone, he wiped it on his pants as he pocketed his mobile.
“I’ll follow you in.” John said, trying to calm the stranger. Even though they could both barely walk.
Sherlock clawed at his chest, clinging onto him as he put most of his weight in Seb’s arms. “I can walk.” Sherlock murmured, trying to put his lanky feet out in front of him.
Sebastian chuckled, lifting his head up and meeting Sherlock’s worried gaze. “Shh baby, it’s okay.” He murmured, “Why don’t you get my cock out and start working it, hmm?” Seb asked.
The boxer was wheezing, his chest barely expanding. He was being half dragged and half carried. He wished he didn’t let that Angus get a good jab at him, his punches were too heavy, and he was easily crushed underneath them.
Sherlock shrugged, placing his hands beside himself as he attempted to stand up. John quickly had his hands underneath his arms, carefully lifting him to his feet. Sherlock wobbled, as everything felt fuzzy, his head ringing and his eyes were swimming. “Come on, Prince Alfred’s ER isn’t far.” The boxer said, cautiously leading Sherlock out of the alley.
“How about I go get you some help.” Sherlock slurred, his blue eyes burning with care as he waited for John to agree.
An animated voice boomed across the room, “Gather your bearings it’s about to get shaky.” Sherlock flinched, clamping a tight hand around Sebastian’s bicep. The twat laughed, hauling him further through the mass of people.
Staring off at the railing, surrounding the dark concrete ring, Sherlock worried about Angus, wondering if this underground boxing championship had medical staff. He was only a few weeks off becoming fully qualified, already having a job lined up at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
John hated the sweat and dried blood that clung to his skin, almost begging for him to finish the job. He yanked a t-shirt over his head, desperate to get away from this place. It always fucked with his head. It all felt different, everything that was bad behaviour was just the currency around here. Everyone tried to speak his language, and he hated how well he spoke it.
The room fell into a quiet buzz, interrupted by the occasional chant.  Sherlock was still trying to understand how anyone could stick around to watch another round of boxing when Sebastian caught his attention. “Did you want a drink?” He offered, reaching in his back pocket. Sherlock nodded keenly, prepared to follow him. “Wait stay here. Don’t want to lose our spot.”
His name was whispered around with silent breaths of paranoia and lust. Temptation and fear circled around the crowd, keeping their eyes to the stage, and their feet on the ground. Even strangers could tell there was something powerful about him, from the narrowness in his eyes to the menace in his confidently clenched hands. There was no doubt that he was dangerous and capable.
They staggered down the street. John hissed in pain, as his shoulder grated along his collar bone, each step was sending shockwaves up his legs and jarring into his knees. He really wanted to get home, get to bed and hopefully wake up the next day. But he was determined to get the boy off the streets, in case anyone or his friend Seb returned.
The first punch was thrown by the larger guy, as it was quickly dodged before the younger man counteracted it with rapid hits to his chest. Sherlock stared with disbelief at how fast the blonde man moved, he was landing punches so quickly that the other guy barely had a chance to recover.
So many voices shouted with a mix of encouragement and argument from the crowd, as the fight began. The large man standing beside Sherlock was booing and waving his hands around angrily, nearly whacking Sherlock in the face. Until the beefy boxer threw a strong punch against John’s jaw, snapping his head back, as he stumbled on his feet. Sebastian’s arm tightened around Sherlock’s shoulder, as he flinched at the sight.
John blinked, his tongue felt funny as he struggled to reply. “Uh, yeah, I’m more meant to be asking you that.” John chuckled.
“Now boys, let’s keep it clean. No teeth. No claws. If you feel like God is calling your name, then raise your hand to surrender.” Both participants nodded in agreement. Sherlock leaned up on his toes, trying to catch more of the younger boxer. Only to be shoved back by a bulky guy, downing a can of beer. Sherlock subtly huddled up towards Sebastian, as his boyfriend easily slipped an arm over his shoulders, pulling him closer into his side. Sherlock tried to hide his discomfort as Seb held him tightly, making Sherlock feel trapped as they both watched the fight slowly play out.
A drunk patron wobblingly next to him bumped Sherlock out of his thoughts, as they spilled half their drink down his nice jeans. Sherlock frowned at the dark beer chilling his leg, trying to flick it off from his shoe. This was definitely not his scene; he rarely went out for anything that wasn’t dinner or groceries. Maybe Seb would enjoy getting a drink somewhere quieter, Sherlock scratched the back of his neck, hating how close everyone stood to him. He wondered how many more drinks Sebastian would need before he would be too drunk to try anything on him tonight.
Sebastian tightening his hand around his boyfriend’s neck, cutting off the weak flow of air. Sherlock stuttered, feeling his head swim and his brain began to scatter, as his lungs burned.
Sherlock was shivering as he stroked Sebastian within the tight expanse of his jeans, being careful to not scratch his cock on the cool metal zip. Sherlock breathed in the cologne staining Sebastian’s neck, it was the same scent that drew him into Seb in the first place. It was the combination of sea salt and forests, underlined with Sebastian’s natural musk. Sherlock tried to focus on the rhythm, trying to think of another time when he didn’t mind doing this sort of thing. When he actually craved it.
Sometimes Sebastian would slap Sherlock’s thigh, just to get his attention. Or grab him and shove him around. Sherlock had tried to tell him off, had tried to delete his phone number and completely shut him out. But Sebastian had a way of wiggling back into his life. It didn’t help that Sebastian was studying cybersecurity, and he had a gift at finding Sherlock when he didn’t want to be found. He would show up at his lectures, follow him home and constantly offer him something to help him get through the late nights. Sherlock has never had to pay for the drugs, and he didn’t intend on starting.
Eventually, curiosity got the better of John, as he looked over to the boy. “So who was the guy you were with?” He wondered.
Sherlock jumped, forgetting that there was someone in front of him, he frowned down at himself, trying to remember what he had said to him. “I think I need a doctor.” He murmured.
Sebastian rolled his grey eyes, suddenly grabbing Sherlock’s jaw and hauling him into a deep kiss. Sherlock froze up, prying Sebastian’s hands off his face as he struggled to pull away. He threw a panicked glance around the room, worried that the crowd in here wouldn’t take well to seeing two men kissing.
John stood firmly, his eyes hard and his lips pressed together tightly. The Egyptian prince seemed drunk, as he wobbled on his legs, staring down at his hands in amazement, as they caught the blood leaking from his nose. John waited, shoulders pulled back for another swing, but it wasn’t necessary as the other boxer, raised a bloody hand in surrender.
The boxer’s eyes would lose focus every now and then, the darkness swallowing up his vision as his steps turned sideways. The ground escaping his feet and suddenly meeting his knees. He grunted, the sound almost startling him, as he began to choke, the sounds echoing around his ears. He ran a hand down his throat, as it came back sticky with red. A silent mumble escaped his lips, “Please.” His voice was dry, lost in heavy panting. He could hear the scuff of shoes, and the wheeze of a struggle.
Sherlock smiled faintly, “Yeah. Sebastian.” He shuffled closer underneath the boxer’s arm, as he held onto John’s hand. The older man nodded, his stomach sinking as he worried about what Seb could have done to the boy if he hadn’t interrupted them.
His chest tightened as he could taste the blood coating his teeth. John drew in a wheezy breath. “Oi!” He shouted, surprised as the guy choking his friend continued but gave John an annoyed glare. “Put the poor fucker down.”
It was complete chaos as Sherlock struggled to stand upright as bodies shoved against him constantly. His head was ringing just from the loud chatter, not to mention the blasting music that drowned out his thoughts. Sebastian leaned into his ear, trying to tell him something. But the words were getting lost. “What?” Sherlock shouted, trying his hardest to understand his boyfriend.
Sherlock managed to get halfway towards the exit, before he stumbled over Sebastian, his boyfriend’s arms catching him from hitting the ground. “You’re gonna have a hell of a hangover tomorrow.” Sebastian chuckled, holding onto him tightly.
Sherlock wanted to step back with each hit, as everyone else would step forward. He was caught in the crowd’s tidal wave of sticky, sweaty bodies. Sebastian’s back was pressed into his chest, his presence seemed to anchor him into reality, it felt too real that this world existed so close to his.
His fists were still stinging, the never-ending ache in his shoulders playing up as he tried to walk towards the car park. Tired weary eyes scanned the streets, blessed for the silence and privacy. John’s whole body was screaming with each step, something warm was dripping down his chest, probably blood.
Seb’s grey eyes narrowed on the approaching stranger before he recognised the clean-cut expression etched into his face. “How lovely of you to join us.” He threw a glance down at the struggling Sherlock. “I’m sure you’re the expert at this type of thing.” Seb chuckled darkly. “Want to take over?”
The lighter-haired man grunted, leaning in closer as he lifted his hand up to rest against Sherlock’s neck. The once intimate gesture quickly tightened into a violent hold around his throat. With Seb’s fingertips pushing deeply into his tensed muscle, his touch burning Sherlock’s neck as it suffocated him.
A sharp sting followed his tensed neck as John faced the announcer with a wince, “If you’ve got anyone for me.”
John shrugged stretching out his back, as a headache threatened to blackout his eyes. He limped his way towards the showers, carefully checking himself over. Noticing a lot more bruises than he could feel. He wiggled his way out of the underground bar, blinking back his pain. Angus had got him good, managing to knock his head around. His jaw was so tense, and he could barely move it. His teeth were slick with blood, and he could taste it all the way up to the back of his throat.
The larger boxer didn’t hold back as he continued to swing at John’s stomach. Sherlock couldn’t watch, he didn’t want to see the handsome man get mushed into a bleeding pile of bones.
The nurse closed his eyes, the image of Sebastian was imprinted into his brain, even with his eyes closed he could still see his gritted teeth and glaring frown. The feel of Seb’s hand on his throat and one around his cock, swamped Sherlock’s blood thick with pleasure and pain, edging him closer and making him feel almost guilty as his orgasm built up.
He dragged himself towards the end of the street, lifting himself against the wall, before heaving himself up onto his feet. He tilted himself around the corner, barely lifting his head as the noises became louder.
John watched him walk off before he staggered his way towards the dizzy man. The poor sod’s dick was half out of his jeans, and still too much on show for John’s liking. “Seb?” The stranger whined. As John cautiously pulled his underwear up, then carefully zipped him back in. By this time Sherlock was blinking up at him, John paused, startled by the curious look of innocence that the man had. He didn’t look like he belonged half hanging out in a dodge alleyway, he looked like someone sweet and caring. He looked young, maybe early twenties or so, with a fine dusting of stubble along his jaw.
Sebastian pressed a kiss to his cheek, “No you can’t, love.”  He said, wrapping the boy’s arm over his shoulder and carrying him out of the bar.
When the boxer looked back up, he was met eye to eye with the stranger. Once again, the dark-haired man was staring over his injuries. “So they don’t have medical staff, do they?” He asked. Chuckling, John shook his head. It was probably the only thing you wouldn’t be able to find in a bar like that. “You need to put ice on that.” Sherlock murmured, looking at the bruise forming underneath John’s eye.
“That tickles.” Sherlock whined, abandoning his drink on the bench, as he found himself in Sebastian’s arms, being lifted to his feet.
It was a strange kind of atmosphere here, the complete opposite to the hospital where Sherlock did his work placement. Instead of silent tears and mumbled concerns, there were shouts and cheers at the sight of fractured jaws and bleeding eyes. Sherlock most definitely did not belong here, even with his sick fascination with injuries.
Everyone in the bar moved around him like glitter, sparkling eyes and gleaming sweat catching the lights. Sherlock held onto his boyfriend, not daring to let go and risk getting lost.
The crowd cheered, as the bell rung out again. The room was tense, as the two boxers circled around each other, their fists were bound with tape and their feet hopped off the mat. Sherlock managed to catch sight of the scarred boxer, his hair had gotten wild from moving about, making him lose his exterior of control, as his light eyes remained narrowed on his opponent. John seemed dangerous, the look plastered across his face, was one that Sherlock would be terrified to receive.
A few hours of opening presents had passed, it was now 11am. Everyone was happy. Despite Sherlock’s annoyingness throughout the year, he had surprisingly managed to get a ton of expensive gifts. Lots of clothing from Armani, which was probably his favourite brand. Although he was happy and grateful for the gifts people got him, he was still upset. John noticed it too. Sherlock had always tried to hide when he was upset by making a certain face, and looking away from everyone.
Sherlock looked up at John, clearly confused, “John. We live in England. Of course we are going to have BBC. I’m pretty sure it’s built into the telly, or something like that...just... turn it on.”
Sherlock slowly got up from where he was sitting. He hadn’t drank or eaten anything in a while, so he got a little dizzy. He put a hand on the wall to steady himself for a moment, and then proceeded to limp over to John, and weakly hopped onto John’s back.
Sherlock sighed, and pointed over to the sink. In the sink bowl, there was a small blade lined with blood. John groaned and squinted his eyes in disbelief.
sorry i haven't added any new chapters lately, i got depressed. everyone is just celebrating the new year, expecting that 2021 is gonna be so much better, but it's not. nothing changes that quick. and i don't believe in miracles or anything like that (because i swear to fuck, i have hoped for a miracle so many times and all that i get is even worse shit), but if some sort of "miracle" happens this year, i might cry. maybe i'll even gain faith again. i've lost hope, religion (im jewish but when has religion helped me? never. fuck religion. atheism, good morning), friends, faith in fucking humanity. WTF IS WRONG WITH HUMANITY!? YOU IDIOTS ARE OUT HERE KILLING ANIMALS, PEOPLE, THE ENVIRONMENT.
Once Lestrade left the flat, Sherlock turned towards John and extended his arms, placing his hands on John’s shoulders.
“H-hey John” Sherlock said as he limped out of the bathroom. He had taken a shower to clean all the dry blood off of him, so that John could put bandages over the punctures and sew the open wounds.
“J-John w-what happened?” Sherlock asked, unaware that he had blood dripping down his stomach, and probably broken ribs too.
“Sherlock...I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean what I said earlier. I was just upset and I’m genuinely  really worried for you...I...I just don’t want to lose you again.” John said quietly, as a single tear slipped down his cheek.
John: Good Evening Mrs. Hudson. Don’t let Sherlock see your phone. I got him a dog, can it stay with you until tomorrow morning?
“What the f-”. Sherlock looked around, but the strange man was nowhere to be seen. He soon realized he was back at his flat. He heard screams from an elderly woman coming from inside of the flat. Was that...Mrs. Hudson!?
“I think you look quite sexy with a bloody nose.” Sherlock stated, then removed his hands from John’s shoulders and went into the bathroom, starting up the shower.
John: Hey Molly! It’s John. Sorry if you are worried about Sherlock not answering your texts. Last night there was a little incident, and Sherlock now has some punctured ribs and a broken leg...and his phone got lost. So, since Sherlock can't run around with him at Hyde Park, I was wondering if we could take Lyova to your house so he can run around with Mushu? And maybe have dinner there too?
“It’s fine…” John said angrily and walked over to the kitchen in search of a cloth to catch the blood pouring from his nose.
It made a noticeable cracking noise that John winced at. He grabbed a bandage wrap and wrapped it around Sherlock’s ankle as a makeshift solution to a cast or boot.
Sherl looked at his phone, it was already 8am. He had slept in, a lot. He slowly opened the creaky door and peeked his head out.
“Yes?” Sherlock sniffed, he lifted his head up from John’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes once again.
John shot Sherlock another one of those “shut the fuck up before i punch you” looks, and the smirk on Sherlock’s face immidiatley faded.
John then slowly picked up unconscious Sherlock and carried him on his back, careful not to injure any other bones, specifically his ribs, that are most likely either broken or cracked.
There he was, Sherlock, sprawled out in the grass. Asleep, his head resting on Lyova’s stomach. Lyova is Sherl’s dog, a golden retriever, specifically. John gifted him to Sherlock on Christmas morning a few months back. It's not that he ever really asked for a dog, but John knew. He knew about Redbeard and the horrible things that happened in Sherl’s childhood. And the “subtle” hints of Sherlock saying “You know...studies say that dogs can boost oxytocin level in the human brain by up to 80%” turning into “JAWN LOOK AT THAT DOG OVER THERE PLEASE IT NEEDS A HOME” whenever they passed by a kennel, was beginning to become too much for John to handle. On Christmas Eve last year, John texted Mycroft;
Lyova sprang up from the couch, and spastically ran around the flat in search of a black bag with needles, with his long golden fur flowing behind him. This craziness that came from Lev is what Sherlock liked to call “The Zoomies”. It usually happens if he hasn’t been out to play for more than twenty-four hours.
The chimes of Big Ben interrupted their hug, and John pulled back, looked at Sherlock for a moment, and kissed him, right there in Hyde park. The kiss lasted through three chimes from Big Ben, until John pulled back and chuckled a little bit as he saw Sherlock sitting there, blushing and in shock from what had just happened.
John’s eyes began to water as Sherlock started to break down in tears. He reached over to the sobbing young man and wrapped his arms around his waist. Sherlock nuzzled his forehead into John’s neck, but kept his hands in his lap. They rested there in complete silence (other than the soft sobs coming from Sherlock) for a few moments.
“But...John…” Sherlock lifted his head from John’ shoulder and frantically scanned the woods they were in. John heard what seemed to be quiet cries coming from the detective. He was still in shock, so the intense pain hadn’t quite registered yet.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he cupped a hand over his mouth. Starting to cry, he looked up at John in disbelief, and then back down at the puppy. Crying soon turned into sobbing. No one had ever seen Sherlock cry before, at least not like this.
Sherl slowly walked over to the couch and sat down. John had to first inject him with a dose of morphine to numb the pain all over his body. Although he was definitely not too afraid of needles, they still gave him unpleasant flashbacks from when he had a drug addiction, so he just looked away.
1: the alpha/omega tags that i put do not actually go with the story lol. in my mind, alpha means top/dom and omega means bottom/sub, but i didn't want to put those either because i felt like it would mislead people into thinking that this is smut, cuz it's not (sorry). i removed the alpha/omega tags tho because there were some people who thought that the story was going to turn into an omegaverse bUt ItS nOt LoL, iM jUsT rEaLlY bAd WiTh TaGs...ANYWAYS YEAH HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND
After about 10 minutes of just standing there and staring at the collar, John finally decided to not name him yet. He would let Sherlock name him.
“Of course. But you need a shirt on first. I will carry you the entire time, but they won’t let you in without a shirt.”
John shamefully walked over to the table and grabbed a chair. He dragged it back over to the counter and stood on top of it. This time he was easily able to grab the supplies. He stood back down and put the chair back where it belonged. He didn’t like being “the short friend”, it made him think that people saw him as helpless and vulnerable.
He has just remembered, it’s Christmas. Although Sherlock is an Atheist, all of his friends and family were Christian. He got presents out of it, so he just went along with it.
John: Mycroft, come visit your brother. Need to do some last minute Christmas shopping and I can’t have him out of the house.
A few minutes later, Sherlock stepped out of the bathroom with his silky maroon dressing gown on, his wet curly hair slicked back, and a forced smile on his face. He walked over to the table and grabbed his food. John looked up at him from the chair he was sitting in,
Sherlock was unconscious, but once again, he would live. John rolled up his flatmate’s right pant leg. His ankle was twisted and beginning to swell purple. His lips and fingernails were also beginning to become as blue as his eyes. Sherlock must’ve gotten a fever from the freezing rain they had previously been running in. The closest hospital was more than 30 miles away, considering they were in a forest that was located in the middle of nowhere. John impulsively decided to untwist Sherlock’s ankle, since he was unconscious and wouldn’t feel any pain.
It was a perfect blend of give and take, and there was a warm feeling blossoming inside Sherlock as he thought to himself that maybe this time, John need not forget about him.
Lestrade told him once, over lunch, that John and Mary had split up even before the send-off party. No one knew why, but a common friend had hinted that John confessed to Mary that there was someone else he wanted to try it out with, but Sherlock barely paid any attention.
“Sherlock, I need to tell you something,” John said gently as he reached out for him. “I get it now. And I don’t want to do this anymore. Not to you. And I want—“
However, Sherlock’s world stopped when one of the team members finally got a hold of a name to attach to the gossip: Sherlock’s mind went blank as he stared at Lestrade, who was talking about John Watson, and how bright this young guy was, and how excited they were to have him on the team…
“No, no, no, I’m sorry,” John gasped suddenly, pulling back with wide and scared eyes. He opened his mouth to say something, but instead, he whimpered, lower lip trembling and eyes brimming with unshed tears of despair as he looked away.
It seemed to have gotten worse when John Watson announced that he was leaving the Yard to be commissioned to the Middle East as an army medic in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, but Sherlock would say this was just due to the increasing number of criminal cases he had to solve.
Cliché as it was, it was magic from midnight to sunrise for the pair. When the night was giving way to the dawn, Sherlock found himself saying yes to John offering him a lift home. The easy conversation and laughter from the last hours continued all the way to the six blocks that they drove together, with Sherlock in the passenger seat.
Sherlock told himself that it was a good thing that John had forgotten him: it would make forgetting about that night, setting it aside in his vast mind palace, that much easier for him.
They went to different universities and had their first encounter during the birthday of a common friend, Mike Stamford. They barely talked for two hours, and only turned to each each other when everyone else in the group was inebriated beyond comprehension.
For a few glorious seconds, John responded enthusiastically, and all he could do was to think about how perfect the feeling of John’s lips were on his: dry, flaky; peppermint and tea; warm on the outside, cool on the inside; completely addicting, and how he never before felt this kind of rush and joy—
John gave him a smile, and it unnerved Sherlock to see how unchanged that smile was (he wondered why he remembered his smile). “Hi, uh… teammate,” John said with a trace of nervousness and caution.
“I said NO, John!” Sherlock shouted furiously, punching the wall behind him, much to his own shock. John watched him wordlessly for a few minutes, and Sherlock wondered what it was that John saw: a pathetic man heaving dry sobs that couldn’t seem to come out, something in him breaking repeatedly, as though each moment Sherlock erased himself from the memory of John was relived in high definition.
And now, seeing a desperate John Watson in the driver’s seat, shaking with the knowledge of what passed between them, Sherlock knew there was only one thing he could do. Ignoring the pain in his chest, Sherlock reached out and cupped a hand on John’s forehead, muttering the words alongside promises of how it was going to be all right when he woke up much later.
“Are you going to change or not?” Sherlock repeated, stripping off his coat jacket, leaving him in a stark white button up that seemed to cling to his chest in a way that drew John’s attention.
“Sure, sweet. Grab him a plate and let us all eat,” she turned to John, gesturing for him to take a seat, “I’m Lydia. I’m certain you know my children,” she almost laughed as if someone not knowing the kids were some joke. Sherlock returned with a plate for John, taking his own seat before they all began to eat. John knew at that moment, eating a soft yeast roll and sipping tea with the three most powerful kids at his school that his life was over. It no longer belonged to him and he knew he was just a toy to them to do as they wished. ‘This could be beautiful,’ a voice whispered in the back of his mind as he chatted nicely with a Mrs. Lydia Holmes. She proved to be just as terrifying as her children, but John hoped to overlook it as he was just filled with anxiety.
Sherlock took John’s wrist, eyeing the watch. “You mother won’t be home till morning. That is why you have a second alarm, one for you to greet her and one for you to wake for school. Doctor, late and weird hours. You reset the watch frequently, but not frequently enough for it to be a timer, Not that you would need a timer when you cook, you use the kitchen timer. But, as I was saying,” Sherlock paused for a moment, “come home with us. You can sleep at our house while your mother is away.”
“Be careful what you wish for”, John’s mother used to say when he was smaller. Now, he was tired of wishing and not getting, he was determined to do and get results.
“How did you know she was going to be away?” John found himself intrigued by the middle Holmes. Not that he hadn’t been before, but now he had a subtle admiration, aside from the adoration of just what the Holmes signified, but of what he could do. He picked apart John’s life by just his watch.
“You can’t wear those jeans, they’re stained. Do you have any dress pants?” Sherlock said, twirling a finger for John to turn around. John obliged, swallowing his blush back as it threatened to creep back up.
No one messed with the Holmes kids. Eurus was terrifying in her own way, Sherlock could destroy you with a few sentences and Mycroft had influence in places most adults didn’t. Only when you caught one of the three doing something they shouldn’t unexpectedly did you gain leverage over them. Whispers had it that usually that only happened when Sherlock was high, not that John listens to whispers.
I have a new one up as well, if you like Doctor Who/Supernatural/Sherlock, it is pretty good. I think. I like it, drama and SuperWhoLock is, in all honesty, my life. So, if you like my work, check it out.
“Beautiful,” Mycroft said, rolling his eyes. “I think this could be beautiful. A respectable lad like John will keep teachers at bay when you and Eurus get up to your… shenanigans,” he turned to wards the sink to wash his hands. “But, you can’t dress like that.”
John suddenly no longer found the trio so scary and almost found them… ordinary. He wouldn’t say that because he knew they still had power over him, even if Mycroft had black rabbit slippers on.
“You didn’t set the second alarm. My guess is that she is leaving town, medical meeting perhaps?” Sherlock seemed a bit unsure of his last deduction.
People John didn’t know too well entered as well. Then the last but also the only person John wanted to see entered the room. Sherlock Holmes. For a senior, he dressed well. His money was evident, so was his confidence. Sherlock was smart, he was cold as well. He didn’t do friends very well, some said if his siblings hadn’t been in the school with him, he wouldn’t even have friends. Sherlock had skipped many grades just to be the same grade as his older brother, who had shared the grade with his 3 years younger brother since 3rd grade. Their younger sister later did the same thing when they entered 5th grade. Since John’s 5th grade, he had one 3 Holmes kids in his class.
Oh, Trigger Warnings, just in case: Mentions of suicide (but I mean, there is a lot of that) And a sad Sherlock.
Unedited. I think. I may have edited it before my laptop was taken? Forgive me for spelling/grammar errors.
,’ the word whispered into his mind, causing him to suddenly flinch away from the hand that held his wrist. His father’s voice always found a way into his life, causing him to flinch away from whatever magnetized him towards things he shouldn’t like.
Kind of a bit tough... SO, Trigger warning, First, some gay stuff obviously (that isn't triggering) but implied date rape scenario. It was a bit tough for me to write this chapter, even though there is not actually a rape, but the implications...
Sherlock’s gaze suddenly stopped John, who was still leaning a bit close to the much younger teen. “What’re you doing?” His voice made John almost shiver. It wasn’t deep, but it was cold as ice, as if he didn’t have an ounce of heat in his body and couldn’t care less about the question he had asked.
“Have what?” John found himself saying, almost wanting to ignore the fact Sherlock Holmes just admitted to being gay. It had been whispered around school, once again those little voices that came up when the Holmes siblings missed school. The words that said Sherlock had originally liked James Moriarty before Eurus but something seemed to happen between them and the youngest Holmes got the rugby captain.
“I, uh,” John moved back, putting distance between the two. Sherlock seemed to lose some of his rigidness as he watched John make distance. “Nothing,” John finally replied, heat had engulfed his entire body and was slowly creeping up his neck. Sherlock didn’t say anything else, just let John blush and squirm under his level gaze until their teacher walked in. Not once did she tell Sherlock to pay attention or to put his phone away, she wouldn’t dare.
“Watson, uh, John Watson,” he replied, trying to sound confident and not terrified of the boy his age and the other boy a few years younger. Instead he straightened his shoulders and looked at the elder levelly, meeting his steely gaze.
“I saw it. But, that is beside the question, you want help with something. Perhaps,” he paused and looked at Mycroft. Mycroft seemed to look at his younger sibling at the exact same time as they shared some silent conversation without John.
Entering the school, John’s hopes of a new, better year slowly start to vanish as he starts seeing everyone in his first class. James Moriarty, a long time disliker of John due to the sheer fact that he just exists and the current boyfriend of Eurus Holmes. John tries not to let Jim catch him eyeing him, he didn’t need his jumper ruined by whatever lunch was served today. Eurus and Jim were terrifying together, but Jim didn’t go around the other Holmes. After Jim, was Molly Hooper, a close - if not the only friend that John has. Her bouncy hair and bright smile seemed to make John feel better, despite how shit of a day he could be having. She had dated Jim back in their Freshman year, so Jim seeing her with John added to the dislike.
Mrs. Turner was in the middle of saying something about a hall pass when John shoved the door open, holding a page in his hand. “Oh, there you two are. I was looking for you, come on we have more yearbook stuff to do,” pushing a bit of an authoritative tone, sounding much like his war general father, John looked to the two Holmes boys. One looked shocked, the other mildly pleased. Both expressions were covered as Mrs. Turner turned back to them.
“Otherwise, I like this- your look I mean,” Sherlock waved a hand up and down, shoving a dark jacket into John’s arms. Next his long fingers were in John’s hair, pushing the blonde strands over and back. He smiled to himself as he fixed John’s in a very posh way. John almost wanted to push him away as much as he wanted to pull him closer. Seconds later, Sherlock moved back, pleased. “Perfect. Yes.”
My laptop has been taken by my parents so I had to get my Google Docs on the phone to get my written chapter. I have like, 2 pre written?
Once the two had gone, John could almost jump for joy. He wound up punching one of the stalls, the wood banging back into the wall before he realized he needed to calm down. ‘It’s just people,’ he kept telling himself. The last hour of school seemed to go by in a daze, because before John knew it, he was dragged to a black car by Sherlock Holmes. Mycroft was seated in the back, Eurus in the front and Sherlock shoved John between him and Mycroft. The driver didn’t say a word as they left the school, eyes following the car as if they knew something was up inside.
“I-i had a dream. A-a-and in that d-dream everyone that I love and c-care about didn’t know m-me. And y-y-you were d-dead. You died in a w-war.” Sherlock explained quietly, and then reopened his eyes, watching John carefully re-wrap the cut on his arm. John quickly finished wrapping the wound and then looked at Sherlock with a sad expression on his face.
hi guys i just wanted to say thank you for reading this, it means a lot to me. just wanted to announce a few updates :)
John rushed to Sherlock’s room and grabbed a clean shirt from his closet, he walked back to the living room. He lifted Sherlock’s arms up and put the shirt on (Like dressing a child lol).
-conservatives and republicans (not all of them, but the bad ones. i still love my conservative family. but their opinions are dumb)
“STOP YOU BASTARD!” Sherlock yelled, lunging at the (deceased?) man, punching him. The much older and stronger man kicked Sherlock off of him and punched his face twice, leaving him a bloody nose.
“Okay”, Sherlock replied, barely above a whisper. He called Lyova over to him and together they walked out of the flat, Sherlock slamming the door behind them.
“Holy shi-” John mumbled. He grabbed a rag off of the towel rack and pressed it against the cut on Sherlock’s arm, and set his head on his lap.
“Oh…” Sherlock replied, cautiously opening his eyes. He turned his head to look at John, who was struggling to get the morphine inside the syringe.
Sherlock called Lyova over. Lyova ran to Sherlock, and he picked the puppy up and placed him in his lap, playing with the floppy golden ears that were too big for his head.
John looked at the hand, but hesitated to give the syringe and bottle to him, “Promise me you will only put the amount that you need in, no more, okay?”
Mrs. Hudson came back in and held the door open for John as he walked in with a big box in his arms. He knelt down and placed it into Sherlock's lap, and sat in front of him, smiling. Lestrade started to secretly record with his phone. There was a red bow on the top of the box with a note attached to it, it read;
The detective's eyes fluttered open. He didn’t say anything, but instead just looked around the room, avoiding John’s eyes.
On Sherlock’s way out of 221b Baker Street, now with dry, comfortable clothes, he looked back at Mrs. Hudson’s shop. It wasn’t there, almost like it never did exist. He gulped and then pulled out his phone to text Lestrade.
“Oh you poor thing, you should get that stutter looked at.” She examined Sherlock again, realizing that his clothes were soaking wet with freezing water. She gasped and quickly ran to her passed-out husband’s room, grabbing him some oversized but dry clothing. She handed them to Sherlock, “Here you are. Please do change, you might freeze to death.”.
John pulled Sherlock close to him and kissed him. Sherlock kissed back and cupped John’s face with his hands. After a few seconds, John pulled away. This could be continued later, but for now he needed to take care of Sherlock.
“John can you do me a favour?” Sherlock asked, smiling as he watched Lev crazily sprint in circles around John’s chair.
After another minute of John struggling to put the morphine inside the dumbass syringe, Sherlock finally started to get annoyed. He could see John’s hands were shaking, but why? Why would he be scared or nervous to put some milligrams of drugs inside a little syringe. Possibly because it reminded him of when Sherlock had nearly killed himself on a private plane from drug overdose? Or when John beat the living daylights out of him...
“F-fine. I g-guess we can help.” Sherlock said, looking at John. John hesitated but eventually nodded his head in approval.
“I know lots of things. Also, you’re practically a celebrity, dearie.”. Sherlock still continued to follow the stranger.
Molly smiled. Everyone in the room knew about the dog except for Sherlock. You’d think he would’ve made a deduction by now, but everyone managed to hide it very well.
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. It felt like the whole world was spinning, but he didn’t. He stayed in place, and watched as everything and everyone moved on without him. He began to sob as he placed a hand on top of the tombstone. He shut his eyes tightly.
Lyova padded over to Sherlock and John, whom were still sitting on the floor. He jumped up on the couch the look at them both, and tilted his head.
“UGH MYCROFT WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHEN WILL JOHN BE BACK?” John heard Sherlock complaining, as he walked up the stairs. He chuckled a little bit to himself.
“I don’t understand why he can’t just bark once or twice…” John muttered, walking back over to the spot on the floor that Sherlock was sitting on.
John opened the drawer, which revealed a small black box. He opened it carefully, and inside there were two syringes, four bottles of only God knows what types of drugs were contained inside, seven razor blades, and one bottle of laxative pills. John’s heart sunk. He took the box and quickly ran out of the bathroom, hiding the box where Sherlock (hopefully) couldn’t find it.
He began to speed walk back to the car, fearing that if he ran he would hurt Sherlock even more or wake him up, which would cause the detective to be in tremendous pain.
Lyova ran after Sherlock, but was met by a door in front of his snout. He sat down and tilted his head. After about a minute, he whined and scratched his paws at the door. He laid down and tried to fit his paw under the crack of the door, making a horrible screeching noise. This caused John to groan and turn in his sleep for a moment. Lev sat back up and stared at the door handle, knowing he was not yet defeated. For he could not reach the handle, but he knew someone that could. He looked back at John who was still fast asleep in the living room. The pup ran to his other owner and stood beside the couch, ready to pounce on him if he didn’t wake up right away.
“Yes, yes quite good” Sherlock smiled, and stood back up. Their arms would brush together every now and then, as they continued their walk. Sometimes Lev would look up at the two of them and bark happily. Who knows what that ball of fluff was saying…
“Sherlock how much do you weigh?” John asked. As soon as Lyova heard that, his ears perked up and he growled deeply at John. Sherlock taught him to always respond to that question in an aggressive manner because it triggered his PTSD. He was almost training Lev as an ESA, but technically he couldn’t be a legal ESA, because Sherlock always refused to see a therapist.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” John asked the tearful young man as he was observing his arm to make sure the wound hadn’t reopened.
“What happened?” Sherlock shouted at Seb, curious to understand how the entire fight seemed to be flipped upside down.
Sherlock stiffened, “Seb, I’m here to get a break from everything medical, let’s try to avoid ending up at hospital please.”
A few streets over, Sebastian suddenly pushed Sherlock against a brick wall, letting him lean his head back as the boy groaned. The cool air felt refreshing, as the quiet street almost cleared Sherlock’s weary head. He could feel the alcohol soaking up his thoughts. “You’re so wasted.” Sebastian pointed out, readjusting Sherlock’s shirt where it had gotten misplaced from their walk. As the nurse giggled, his cheeks a rosy pink.
Sherlock knew that Seb was just taking the piss, trying to make him even more nervous in a place like this. Sherlock didn’t normally worry about what everyone else would think, but he didn’t want to cause any trouble that could have been easily avoided.
Seb sent him a grin, before leaning forward and bringing their lips together. His tongue easily dived into Sherlock’s mouth, seeking out his taste and choking him with desperation. Sherlock leaned back, trying to create more space between them. But Sebastian tightened his hold on Sherlock’s hips, slamming him against the wall again.  As the breath was knocked out of the boy’s chest.
With an unimpressed scowl, Seb was silenced by the dimming lights and screaming crowd. The second match was beginning.
“You thinking sober thoughts, Sherly?” A voice shouted from behind him, Sherlock spun around, wide-eyed. Seb grinned softly back at him, “Here.” He pushed a plastic cup in his hand.
Sebastian slammed his glass against the counter, his wet lips were pulled into a wide grin as Sherlock was still struggling to finish his own drink. “I love watching you swallow.” Seb smirked, leaning forward and licking a stripe over Sherlock’s neck as the boy continued to drink. Sherlock ended up giggling, sputtering his drink everywhere.
The starting bell rung out, sending the crowd into cheers as the lights flickered before an emerging figure appeared. “Ladies and brutes, savages and gents. Welcome to Vince’s ring. Have we got a hell of a night set for you?” The announcer chuckled darkly into the microphone. “We’ve got Angus Rehlim all the way from Exeter. Let’s hope he travels back home in one piece.” There was a sickening chorus of boos surrounding Sherlock as he sent Sebastian an uneasy look. He was returned with a lopsided grin and shrug. “Then… the one all you girls… and guys have been creaming over. We have for you ladies and gentlemen, John fucking Watson.”
The friction on his dick increased, as everything flooded through the nurse’s brain. Sherlock tried to gasp in a breath, staring into his boyfriend’s wide eyes. His grey eyes seemed almost black, with a surge of anger buried deeply into his dark hues. Sherlock could barely move his hand along Sebastian’s cock, as the air escaped him. His heart was beating so loudly in his ears that he couldn’t hear anything else.
Walking with as much confidence and control as possible, John approached the scuffling couple. They had their hands down each other’s pants, yet one of them had a death grip around the other’s throat. Intending to harm.
The feeling of Seb’s hips pushed up against Sherlock’s stopped the boy’s thoughts, his boyfriend’s firm cock was pressing insistently against the tight expanse of his jeans. Sherlock sobered up quickly, snapping his eye open at Sebastian. “You’re so gorgeous.” Seb whispered, his grey eyes focused hazily onto Sherlock’s, as he wet his lips tasting the beer on them. Slowly, Seb’s eyes fell down towards Sherlock’s mouth. His pink lips parted, “I’ve been in love with you, ever since I first laid eyes on you.”
Sebastian pushed his lips against his ear, trying to be heard over all the cheering, “John Watson head-butted him, knocked the fucker out.” Having Seb so close sent a chill down Sherlock’s spine, as he watched the young boxer. Sherlock was trying to understand how he even reached the taller guy’s head. He bit his lip, taking in the sight of John as he caught his breath, he was truly terrifying. Like a wave that ends up being a tsunami, it was unexpected. But there was something beautiful about his hidden power, about the vengeance buried underneath his skin. Sherlock was curious to know what built a man up like that. What kind of history had to be imprinted into his soul, to make him feel like inflicting that much pain onto someone.
The fight started quickly, John lunged into his hit, already causing the Egyptian prince to go all woozy. Sebastian was getting lost in it, jumping with each second that passed, throwing his drink back and even reaching for Sherlock’s, not that he minded.
“Fuck it’s finished.” Sebastian turned to mutter in Sherlock’s ear, causing tingles to shoot down his spine. Sherlock tried to concentrate on what he was saying. “Let’s just get pissed.” All of a sudden, his boyfriend had slipped a hand into his and was tugging him through the crowd towards the bar.
Sebastian released his arm from Sherlock’s neck, instead of letting his hand trail down his stomach, as it slipped along his firm chest, he could feel his muscles tensing underneath his touch. Sebastian continued to stroke Sherlock’s dick, as it expanded in Seb’s grasp.
“Well, if we are going to be hanging out, you cannot wear that,” Sherlock said, turning and striding to his large wardrobe. He pulled out a pair of silk pants and a black t shirt, changing into the new outfit without even batting an eyelash at the blush that seemed to engulf John. The shorter blonde seemed to fumble before pulling off his jumper, folding it and placing it on a nearby table that was littered with books and folders.
“I have some black jeans,” John said, thinking about his collection of dark denim at home. He didn’t go to church, so he never bothered with slacks. He just wore the blue jeans until they were noticeably dirty and then tossed them in the wash and wore another pair, repeat the cycle.
John must have looked as confused and amused as he felt as Sherlock Holmes being called Willy by a woman John’s size with curlers in her hair and a shirt that said ‘Best Mum Ever’. “William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” Eurus said, her lips curling into a teasing smile/snarl at John. He suddenly remembered why he feared the trio. They would eat him for dinner and not remember his name later.
“Willy, who is your friend?” The woman continued, ignoring the way the Holmes kids seemed a bit thrown back that John was still there while Sherlock seemed to gloat at his siblings while also making John still feel like an outcast.
“A-are you sure you c-can carry me all the way back?” Sherl asked, after a few minutes of John struggling to get them both in a comfortable position.
John grabbed his phone from the coffee table and scrolled through his contacts, searching for Molly’s name. He rarely texts her, so it took a while to find. John hadn’t told anyone of the incident back in the forest, so he couldn’t even imagine how many texts Sherlock had gotten from Molly in the past night. Molly and Sherlock text constantly, they are best friends after all. Gosh...She must be worried out of her mind.
John locked eyes with the detective, “Yeah, I uh...I did” he smiled, and looked down. Sherlock’s blushing increased and his eyes were rapidly moving, trying to deduct John and figure out his motives as to why he kissed him. Of course, Sherlock wanted it. He always had hoped this day might come, but never ever figured that it actually would.
*IMPORTANT* just a lil note; this chapter was written before any other chapter in the story. i'm not making many revisions so the writing style in this chapter will probably be much shittier than any other chapter. also, i did a bit of a time jump. i didn't include when they were searching for the serial killer, but instead just included when they were chasing after him. make sense?
Now knelt down by the toilet, he purged out everything he had eaten that day. He leaned back against the wall and brought his knees up to his chest, his head buried in his arms, and began to cry. Then, he remembered the stash of razor blades he kept in a box inside one of the drawers…
“With pleasure.” Mycroft stood up, grabbed his umbrella, and opened the door, “See ya tomorrow morning” he said as he walked out.
It was New Year’s Eve and Sherlock lay under the old beech tree, his head resting on Lyova’s stomach. 23:36, Sherlock was staring up at the stars and Lev was doing his own thing, just chomping on the grass and sniffing the few bugs that came across his path.
“Sherl...there’s one more, I have to get it out before it gets infected” John gave Sherlock a look of sorrow, he couldn’t bear to see Sherlock in such pain.
John opened a cabinet to get the supplies for sewing Sherlock’s opened wounds. He reached up and tried to grab it, but was too short. Usually, he would just ask Sherlock to grab things on the top shelf, since he was a head taller than John. But John didn’t want Sherlock to lift his arms up, because it would probably result in the wounds to start bleeding again.
“Ah yes. Well we can go to the kennel today and create a tag for him with his name and our phone numbers and everything” John said, ruffling Sherlock’s hair.
“So basically this man named George gets into some trouble and decides to end his life, but before he can do so his guardian angel stops him by having George save him from drowning. Then the angel shows George what life would have been like if he were never born”
Once he walked back into the bathroom, he sadly looked down at Sherlock. He bent down and scooped up the vulnerable boy into his arms and walked into Sherlock’s bedroom, placing him on the bed. He covered him with a blanket, and after a few moments of staring at the younger man, a small mumble finally came from Sherlock;
“C-c-can we take Lev to Molly’s house in a little bit? Just so h-he can run around with Mushu (Molly’s Bernese Mountain Dog), I would take him to Hyde P-p-park usually but well...I’m uh...kinda injured.”
John looked at his lap, finally beginning to realize that the detective was no longer snoozing there, and that the shower water was running. Two showers in one day? That doesn’t quite seem right, especially when it was nearly 4 in the morning.
okay but remember deb morgan saying this: "a bAbY? a mother fucking rolly polly chubby cheeked shit machine? are you kidding me?"
Sherlock’s heart dropped at John’s question, “Wha- what-”, he then looked down at Lev and smiled slightly, mouthing “good boy”.
John frantically searched for a route to get to Sherlock without having to jump off the cliff himself. He eventually found a path through some trees that lead only a few metres from where his best friend lies. Sherlock’s shirt was ripped to shreds from all the thorns and brambles he fell through, even though the brambles had softened his fall a bit.
John quickly stood up, slightly dizzy as his brain was trying to adjust to the sudden change of movement. He walked over to the bathroom quickly, and put his ear to the door. He heard the shower running, but yet no movement. As panic started to flood over him, he heard a small “clink” sound. It was something hitting the ground. Soon after the little clink, there was a slight thud.
He got up from the bed and his feet met the cold hardwood floors. He slowly opened the door and peeked his head out to see Lyova. Lev was standing in front of the door, growling with his tail tucked between his legs and his ears back. John opened the door the rest of the way and walked over to Lev. He looked through the peephole of the door and saw nothing, but heard heavy footsteps.
John’s eyes widened as he stopped in his tracks, “Fifty two- Sherlock! I-” He stopped his scolding once he felt Sherlock go tense in his arms.
After a couple minutes of waiting, John came back out with their late night dinner, and some for Lev too.
“Look, even Mycroft is crying a little” John whispered into Sherlock’s ear. They both began to start laughing in unison, while Lyova was licking Sherlock’s face.
“I am b-but I grew up J-Jewish, so that might b-be why I know the name” Sherlock replied back, trying his best not to stutter.
When they got back to 221b Baker Street, Mrs Hudson greeted them, as usual. They went upstairs and John placed the takeaway bag on the table, and placed everything in an orderly fashion.
Suddenly, as Sherlock was almost in arms reach of their suspect, they took a sharp left turn to avoid a small, yet dangerous, cliff. A cliff that Sherlock could not see in the pitch black night. Although his brain tried to convince himself to turn left, his body wasn’t quick enough. In almost a cartoonish manner, Sherlock halted to the best of his ability, but the inertia had left him stumbling. He circled his arms in an attempt to balance himself, but in doing so only resulted in him falling forward off the small 17ft cliff.
John turned his phone off and set it back down on the coffee table. He turned around to see Lyova sprinting around his chair and playfully growling. Sherlock was laughing hysterically. John face palmed.
He was an incredibly loyal pup and would do anything to protect John and Sherlock (More-so Sherlock, who was his favourite, and almost like a big brother to him) from any harm that crosses their paths. Thankfully, Sherlock almost always managed to convince John to bring him with them on cases. There were of course the few times where John said no, though. But it was just to keep Lev out of danger. John couldn’t bear to see Sherlock upset. And even though he wasn’t very fond of dogs, he was actually beginning to grow a bond with Lyova.
They walked over to the couch and sat down. Sherlock lifted his knees up towards his chest and rested his head on John’s shoulder. John grabbed the remote, and turned on the telly. He flipped through the channels until he found Dateline.
Sherlock made a face of confusion and excitement. John signaled for Mrs. Hudson, and together they walked out of the room, whispering to each other and smiling.
John smiled, “Well, I’m gonna go to the doctor's real quick and buy a brace for your leg. Oh, and crutches too. Do you want to come with me?”
There stood Sherlock, on top of the Southwark Bride. His cold feet stood in the white snow as small flakes began to gracefully fall onto his coat, and would then slowly fade away. His hands stood on the railing, and his chest heaving. Looking around the large London city, there was no one to be seen. There was no Lyova, no John...Just him.
Author's note: Good morning. I’m writing this in the midst of a hurricane, huddled under a blanket with my dog, Ginger. This story is dedicated to her and another friend of mine :) Now, enjoy this trash~
“aHgHh j-JohN...hEh...he r-really HATES that cHair-” Sherlock tried to say through tears (of laughter)
Molly: Hi John! Of course you guys can bring Levvy over! I’m so so so so sorry to hear about Sherl :( I was indeed worried sick, but I’m glad he’s alive. I can get dinner ready! What would you guys rather eat; pasta or steak?
As he was doing so, Sherlock quietly chuckled to himself and then said “Why is it always m-me that g-gets injured?”
He sighed, “I’m sorry...again. I’m just worried for you. Can we at least get takeaway on our way back home?”
Quickly, he looked both ways before crossing to make sure there were no cars, and then ran towards the alley. He kept walking further and further into the darkness as the whimpering grew louder and louder. He stopped once he saw a cardboard box with a bit of golden fluff poking out.
The man’s ocean blue eyes finally fluttered open. He turned over to the golden retriever and stared at him for a moment until finally whispering “What do you want, Lev?”.
The cut was no longer bleeding, thanks to the very trustworthy and experienced Dr Watson. But John still had debated on whether or not taking Sherlock to the hospital would be the right decision. After a few moments of his two inner voices debating, he decided not to take Sherlock to the hospital. The detective despises hospitals, and it would probably make his mental state even worse if he was forced to be taken to one.
Sherlock appeared from the bedroom and slowly walked over to the kitchen, in his black and maroon dressing gown.
Sherlock awoke the next morning. The sun shined through the blinds and was basically blinding him. He rolled out of bed and looked out his window.
“Of course, Idiot. So is Mrs. Hudson, Greg, and Molly” John listed as he sat down on the couch and grabbed the remote for the telly.
“Okay...okay fine we can watch Dateline...I don’t even know why BBC airs that stupid show…” He mumbled that last bit.
John scurried over to him and immediately took Sherlock’s blood-drenched shirt off. Thick thorns were piercing through his ribs, and blood was slowly oozing out.
-murderers (even tho im oddly obsessed with you, NEVER murder the innocent. live by the code of Harry :))
“Shh...It’s okay, Sherl. I’m here now. It’s okay.” He said to him comfortably, while he tussled Sherlock’s dark brown hair with his hand.
Sherlock’s sky blue eyes began to water, he didn’t say anything. He didn’t even know what to say, because John was right. His habits were getting him nowhere in life.
“Sherlock” He whispered, softly shaking one of his shoulders. God, he was beautiful sleeping like that. Well, he is beautiful all the time, but when he was sleeping he looked like an angel and a kitten at the same time.
After a few minutes of crying outside the local pub and recalling his and his flatmate’s recent dispute, John stood back up, calm and collected, and continued his search for Sherlock. He passed by different shops and restaurants, asking if his friend had stopped by, but none had any remembrance of Sherlock ever being there in the past few hours. Eventually, he entered Hyde Park and walked around for a bit. He never expected Sherlock to be there, of all places. Sherlock was more likely to move to Russia than to take a walk through Hyde Park...Especially on New Year’s Eve. At almost the same moment these thoughts were entering John’s head, he saw a small frail figure lying on the grass under an old beech tree, it’s head resting on another figure. The doctor shined his flashlight, and there he was, Sherlock, sprawled out in the grass. Asleep, his head resting on Lyova’s stomach. John smiled and sighed a sigh of relief. He knelt down toward the sleeping younger man.
“Levvy! Come here boy!” Lyova got up from his soft faux-fur dog bed as soon as he heard his owner call his name. He was slightly spoiled in a way, but he loved it of course. Although he loved helping his owners even more.
“Did y-y-you do it yet? Is it d-done?” Sherlock asked, squinting his eyes and forcing his head in the other direction.
Sherlock smiled, made his way over to the couch, and plopped down right next to John. He lied down and laid his head on John’s lap.
John blushed out of embarrassment, “Sorry...I’m just really nervous right now. Just the thought of needles and syringes reminds me of that….not so good period of time”
He got under the covers with Sherl and draped an arm over his waist, with Sherl’s head resting on John’s chest. A few moments of silence passed until John heard a few soft sobs come from the man beneath him.
The deep crunching sound of the dead winter leaves as they walked must’ve been relaxing for Sherlock, because surprisingly, he drifted back to sleep without putting up a fight.
“Okay okay”. John pointed the remote towards the telly, and flipped the channels until he finally found Dateline.
Home… all Sherl wanted right now was to go back home. To go home and lay on the couch, his head resting on John’s lap, and Lev lying below them, chewing a soft squeaker toy.
Sherlock scratched behind Lyova’s ear as he talked softly to him, “Hey Levvy, go fetch my black bag with the needles in it, won’t you”
2: sorry that i haven't been updating recently. i usually update daily, but i was on vacation and there is no wifi or service where i was so i was unable to update. more chapters will come tomorrow! :)
“I’m sorry…” John said quietly as he ripped the last thorn, the deepest one, out of Sherlock’s side. He didn’t scream, but he did flinch and cry out a little. John rushed to the kitchen, threw the thorns in the trash can, and grabbed a wet rag. He walked back into the living room and dabbed Sherlock’s ribcage to clean up all the blood.
While continuing to make eye contact with Sherlock, John placed the syringe and bottle of morphine in his hand. Sherlock closed his hand and got off the couch, he knelt down in front of the coffee table and sat in a childish manner. He put the bottle on the coffee table and then snatched John’s phone from his hand without asking. Sherlock’s phone had been lost in the forest while they were chasing the killer, and there was most likely no chance of getting it back.
“Sherlock!” John cried. The killer had gotten away, but John did not care. Sherlock could potentially be dead, and if not, was most likely extremely injured.
John turned his phone off and put it back in his pocket. He sat there for a little while longer, just to let the pup warm up some.
“Have you ever seen the movie It’s a Wonderful Life?” He asked, laying back down next to Sherlock, who was staring up at the ceiling with his arms rested beside him.
“Um...I was going to jump. Also, where are we going?” He asked, trying to change the subject. Azrael stopped in his tracks and turned around to Sherlock, “Home.” he smiled, and then faded away.
“Thank you guys. Please leave within the next hour. This is urgent” He said, handing over the information about the murders to Sherlock.
helloooo guys uwu. i just wanted to show you my dog Ginger. she was the inspiration for Levvy boi <3 and if you're wondering, yes, she only has one eye. she my best fren tho UwU
John opened up the small black bag and carefully grabbed a needle. He took a disinfecting wipe (from the same bag) and wiped the needle with it. Then, he attached the needle to the syringe. He inserted the needle into the vial (bottle) and pushed the air out of the syringe. He turned the vial upside down, and pulled back the plunger to the 10mg line.
Sherlock had gotten over his drug addiction nearly two years ago, and the thought of relapsing had never crossed through his mind even once (lie).
“For Christ’s sake Sherlock...Please tell me, why did you do this?” John pleaded. “Is it something I said?”
“It’s actually kind of good. Some horrible episodes here and there. But most are good.” Sherl replied back.
“Yeah..uh...of course..remember Sherlock..I was a soldier.” He said, breathlessly. Sherlock really wasn’t that heavy, but John hadn’t been used to picking up anything over 13kg since his departure from the army.
John made his way over to the leash and collar section of the store, carefully examining each and every one of the options to choose from on the shelf. Finally, he picked up a burgundy leather collar. It was a little bit big for the pup, but it was the only one left, so it had to do.
Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of Lyova’s barks coming from the other room. It wasn’t his normal, friendly or playful barks. It was more so his aggressive bark that was used when he scented a bad person or criminal.
“J-John! Are you okay?” He asked worryingly, as he pushed John’s head backwards to stop the bleeding.
Sherlock slowly lifted the lid of the box off, and revealed a dark-golden puppy. It was sitting down on a red velvet blanket, with a red bow tied loosely around its neck to match, smiling at Sherlock.
John ran throughout London, looking through places that Sherlock would go whenever he was sad or upset. He was beginning to worry. His friend was nowhere in sight and has been missing since 20:00.  John stopped in his tracks and slumped down against the wall of the local pub. He’s nowhere...John was on the verge of crying.
Sherlock awoke. His hands and feet freezing, his chest heaving. He began to hyperventilate as tears streamed down his cheeks. He sat up so that his back was against the headboard. John’s arm was still draped over his waist, thankfully.
“I know, I know, I was just joking around. You want me to put the morphine in the syringe now?” Sherlock offered
“I love you. Don’t ever doubt that.” John confirmed with a sad smile on his face as he lifted up a hand to wipe away the tears streaming down Sherlock’s cheek.
holy mary mother of fucktown there are many many more but i don't want to be a burden to the loves that even bother to read this shitfilled rant.
This portion of the story was originally going to be a flashback to the first chapter/Christmas time, but I made it a dream instead just cuz. This chapter is based off a movie from 1947 called Its a Wonderful Life. Really good movie, i recommend. basically, the main character, George wishes he were never born, so his guardian angel, Clarence, shows him what life were like if George had never existed.
“Help! Help! I can’t swim!” a voice of a man flooded Sherlock’s ears. He saw a head bob up from the freezing river. Sherlock frantically put his hands on his head and pulled on his hair, in distress. Without thinking, he jumped into the river. After a few moments of looking around for the stranger, he finally spotted him. He swam over to him, grabbed him with his now numb hands and pulled him out of the water and back onto land. The man coughed a few times before standing up and brushing off his wet shirt, then looked into Sherlock’s eyes and smiled.
“Okay” Sherlock whispered back. Sherlock opened the drawers on the bedside table and grabbed the handgun. He didn’t exactly hand it to John, but instead attempted to toss it to him, figuring that John would catch it. Instead, it flew over John’s shoulder and landed behind him with a big thump.
“Yeah I do. But the morphine might make me throw up, and in all honesty John, I really REALLY do not wanna throw up pasta” Sherlock shivered at the thought of a noodle going back up his throat.
Sherlock sat in a seat close to John, not giving anyone a second glance as he pulled out his phone and began to type away at the screen. John leaned a bit closer, unknowingly. He had admired Sherlock for the longest time, his ebony curls and calm composure. Aside from those few times… Sherlock was perfect, to John and to many of the other kids they shared classes with. Sherlock, Eurus and Mycroft were things to be admired from afar but never approached. Art pieces you dared not touch.
We are drawing to an end, guys. I am a bit upset, it seems just yesterday I was up at midnight imaging this story.
I swear I got mad at the characters for bullying John then I stopped and was like "I bloody wrote this, why am I angry."
Senior year. Still putting up with being shoved into a locker, having his tray knocked from his hands due to the occasional disagreement in the cafeteria and being completely overlooked. This year, John swore, that would change.
John suddenly realized he barely knew this person who was currently dragging him down a stairwell into a basement. Lights flashed on, just as John had almost decided to turn and run back up the stairs. He used to play rugby, he could definitely outrun a Holmes. Instead, he found himself confronted with a large room that was quiet beautifully decorated. ‘
John had shrugged on the black coat that fit him rather well and much better than the ratty leather jacket he had back home. It made his shoulders more square, made him stand a little taller next to the Holmes.
Sherlock seemed to be amused by John, a little toy for him to bend and break as he wishes. His popularity was what was keeping John from running and he knew it. He knew John needed Sherlock for his final year not to be complete hell. One word to any person and John’s name would be on every tongue at school, one word and no one would look at him like he was scum. Sherlock had all that power in his pale palms, and John knew that they both knew that John was now a puppet. He had gone too far to turn back now.
Now, John stood in the place that Jim had undoubtedly stood, in front of that very beautiful male. The homophobic whispers scratched at his throat, but John fought back all his negative thoughts. Sherlock was now staring at John as he went through his internal thoughts, having said something John had undoubtedly missed. “What did you say?”
A few classes rolled by, John only had 1 with Sherlock, 2 with Eurus (without Jim) and 1 with Mycroft. That was the most he had seen the three in his classes over the last 4 years, and it frightened him how close they were to him at almost all times.
“Military. She had leave over summer, but she leaves this afternoon. Joining my father on the fields again,” John found himself admitting. The slender fingers around his wrist made him feel like jelly, how he barely noticed the cold fingers that were undoubtedly taking his pulse as he practically swooned over the Holmes.
The four exited the car, Eurus getting into another, Mycroft heading inside and Sherlock dragging John around the back of the house. Ivy covered old stone, large rod iron windows adorned the walls with green shutters, flower boxes in every window and a stone path all the way around the building. The back had a separate door, when opened it led into the basement of the house.
John hadn’t realized he had moved down the hall until he was just outside the bathroom door. Mrs. Turner had walked right in- she wasn’t afraid of the Holmes repercussions of anything she did. John looked down at the notebook in his hand and realized they were supposed to be in a class. They were in for it, probably going to the office and getting detention. But if they didn’t…
“You can’t wear the same pair every day either. No one else will notice, but I will,” Sherlock says, his voice is almost threatening. John nods, the soldierly nod he often saw his father do when the man would videochat him during the summer.
John felt scared then. He shouldn’t have done this, should have stayed dealing with Jim and the other bullies and passing through his final year without being seen. Now he was seen and never had John felt so exposed. Both pairs of eyes seemed to see every flaw, every hidden secret deep down and they weren’t afraid to make it known. They were untouchable and it was…
A loud beeping fills John’s room, the blonde fumbled to shut the obnoxious alarm off. “Great,” he mutters, pulling himself from his all too comfy and warm bed into the chilly air, free of his blanket. He pulls on clothes, jeans and a collared button up, pulling a jumper over. He doesn’t bother with breakfast, only leaves after gathering his notebook, phone and headphones. “This is going to be a different year,” he repeatedly tells himself as he walks to school.
Mycroft marched over, snatching the yellow page from John’s hand. “This is an excellent forgery, who are you?”
Because I wanted a bit of Johnlock and to drag this out a bit, there is a bit of me dragging a bit out just to get the story along without abandoning my plotline. The plotline. Oh, dear, and it is a bit short compared to some of my other chapters. Enjoy!
John had never seen a house so big. His parents owned an apartment in London, but both his parents never seemed to be home at the same time long enough for it to have grown cramped and small. His sister had moved out long before, running away from home with her fiance Clara. Last he heard, they were in the States, just traveling. He often found himself wondering if Harry’s drinking problem had stopped, but never bothered trying to contact the older woman. Now, he felt as if his home was a mouse hole compared to the Holmes Manor.
“Get outta’ here boy, mind your business” He said quietly but aggressively. Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson, then back at the man, and shook his head. He stood back up, and once again tackled the man, this time punching him until he passed out. Mrs. Hudson hesitantly walked over to Sherlock, reaching out a hand to help him up.
A few seconds passed with pure silence, until John finally said “Ya know, I don’t think they have it here in Britain.”
Sherlock turned his head to look back at Lyova, “What is it, boy?”. Lev looked at Sherlock and licked his nose real quick before he went back to smushing bugs with his paws. Sherlock laughed and settled his head back onto Lev’s stomach. Looking at the stars, he began to doze off, thinking about good things like Redbeard, and Lyova and John...John…
Sherlock looked down at his chest, wide-eyed at the sight of thorns jabbed into his ribs, and blood dripping from his stomach and onto the hardwood floors. Tears began to grow in his eyes. John couldn’t tell if it was from pain or the fact that the killer got away.
“It’s okay, Lev. Don’t tell John.” Sherlock whispered, scratching Lev’s head. He then removed his hand from the pup’s head and quietly walked over to the bathroom, his body tense, anxiously hoping that his flatmate doesn’t wake up. He walked in and shut the door, locking it behind him. He turned the shower on, just in case John woke up, and he would think that Sherlock was just taking a shower.
“Look Sherl, they have little dog treats for Lev too! Isn’t that amazing?” John exclaimed enthusiastically.
John and Sherlock sprinted towards the alleged killer, their hearts racing along with their legs. It was a chilly January night. All John wanted to do was to get them out of this weather before they got sick.

John drew a sharp breath. “That was…” The other man tensed slightly, as though he was preparing himself for a good socking. “Extraordinary, quite extraordinary.”
“John Watson, medical student,” Sherlock said instantly, observing his companion carefully. “You recently got together with your high school best friend and you have a family member who comes home drunk on a regular basis.”
Sherlock ran through the options he had quickly: tell John the truth, deflect the question, or lie. When he saw the way John looked at him, though, and how hard he was trying to remain calm (Sherlock noted how the years certainly seemed to have brought on a certain sense of maturity about him), he nodded. “Yes.”
“So, Sherlock, care to look around the room and tell me more of the interesting life stories around?” John said with an amused twinkle in his eyes.
The mention of Mary’s name brought back the usual sadness and fear Sherlock was used to seeing now, and Sherlock knew at that moment he made his point. Carefully, Sherlock brought his hand back up to cup his forehead and, this time, John did not stop him (though every fiber of Sherlock wished John would stop him this time).
Days later, they confronted the poor American in the cab, and they made it back to the apartment building, wheezing out laughter and catching their breath. Sherlock stole a side-long glance at John, who beamed back up at him and – without hesitation – cupped Sherlock’s face in his hands and drew him in for a long kiss.
John gave him a polite smile, one reserved for old acquaintances. “It’s good to see you again, Sherlock.”
John smiled awkwardly as he took a seat next to Sherlock, who looked at the smaller man warily. It was absolutely baffling as to why John was so uncomfortable in his own skin but still commanded a certain presence whenever he walked into the room. He found it amazing as to how John had no idea what the effect he had on the people around them – Sherlock knew of at least three people in different departments who were interested in John, and didn’t want to admit that the thought somehow bothered him.
John was ninety-nine parts laughing and one-part crying when he opened Sherlock’s gift to him, a horrendously ugly jumper that they had joked about John wearing to keep himself warm while Mary was gone. He put it over his head and grinned at Sherlock.
The sudden comparison in his mind jolted him to reality, and this time, it was Sherlock who pulled away. John’s eyes were wide and scared, exactly as they were two years ago, and Sherlock cursed himself for being utterly mindless.
John shook his head, looking a little lost. “I can’t explain it, but I know what happened. I guess the dreams I’ve had aren’t dreams, after all.” He chuckled bitterly. “And I know I hurt you every time I asked you to make me forget. I’m sorry. You don’t deserve that.”
Sherlock realized a couple of days later that he had overdone the memory wipe when he casually checked up on John with Mike Stamford: John had responded ‘who?’ and swore up and down that he never met interacted with anyone from the party.
He hated himself, and Sherlock Holmes knew there was nothing and no one he hated more in the world right now.
Try as they might to avoid it, the night came to the inevitable saturation point of inebriation and happiness, and for some reason, Sherlock found himself walking barefoot down the hall to his office with John giggling by his side. They were talking about the success of their respective roles, and just how beautiful
His request hit Sherlock with the force of a sledgehammer. “Do you mean… you want to forget about…” Sherlock gestured uselessly between them, but John understood.
John told Sherlock that he and Mary were to start a long-distance relationship – she was moving to the States for her post-graduate studies. It was the day after she left, and it was also John’s birthday.
Sherlock Holmes prided himself on being able to let go of that night as easily as he did, especially since he would probably never see John Watson again.
Sherlock gave out the very same deductions he made two years ago, and it was amazing how exact John’s reactions were; how unnervingly constant and unchanging the man was.
