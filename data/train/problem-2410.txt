He exhales.
“Wanna see you,” he says again, slides his hands downward until he reaches the top of Sherlock’s pants.
It was wrong of me.
“Don’t be ridiculous, please.
Especially Sherlock, and Rosie, and he thinks he’s gotten fairly good at knowing when Sherlock is feeling embarrassed.
Dad dead the year before at 62.
And for the first time, Sherlock sees something shift behind the man’s eyes.
It’s not a look Sherlock often sees focussed on him—from anyone.
“No.”
The—the other survey.”
Rosie is sitting up now, looking back and forth between them.
“Just the postman or courier.
It felt like being wanted.”
What do you like?”
“It was my brother’s plan.
Sherlock smiles back.
“Mmm, true.”
Mycroft squirms uncomfortably, and Sherlock has to fight back a grin.
“So mostly loud, mechanical sounds?”
“Yeah?
John sniffs and balls a fist up by his side.
Sherlock looks down at the mess between them, and then back up at John, a look of mild guilt written across his features.
But I would like to try.”
But this is meant to go slow, and I intend for it to.”
There is nowhere to hide (is there ever from Sherlock).
Just sleeping.
John rolls away from him, curls tight, and Sherlock doesn’t know what to do.
“You’ll give me a pinch if you want me to stop?”
John decides to let the comment go.
It’s the first time he’s said the name aloud in 25 years.
“Mm, true…  Bit like a cosmic bus stop, I guess.”
“For this.
Something else.”
Because I trust you, but…”
It comes out somewhat strangled.
John takes another sip, longer this time.
Also said it had never come up.”
I promise you that if it’s something I’m not okay with I’ll tell you.”
Might be if Sherlock had stopped there first, looking for him.
He feels it.
“The innkeeper.”
It’s strange.
Ella looks back and forth between the two of them.
John strokes the spot again and Sherlock realises to late that he about to come, or at least it feels like he is, but whatever it is that John is doing seems to be stretching the moment out, further, and further, until his body is nothing but an all-encompassing ball of pleasure, wave after wave of if.
He doesn’t know, that’s the problem.
He calls as the shower bursts on.
John turns back and grins, a slightly filthy thing that sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine.  “Yeah?  Okay.”  And then he disappears down the hall, and Sherlock hears the click of the door, and the sound of the water turning on, and he feels like he can breathe again.
“I found it in the oil diffuser in Tregennis’ room.
John files that away for future reference, wonders if maybe that’s part of the aversion to sex, too much sensory input at once equals ‘not good’?
“I don’t—I don’t feel things this way.
Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Tit for Tat.
“Molly has them.
Sherlock looks over at him, but they’ve pulled out onto a busy thoroughfare, and John’s attention is wholly on the road.
John blinks.
It almost seems too intimate the minute it’s out of his mouth, but there’s no taking it back now.
“You’re what?”
He bites down hard on his bottom lip, and thrusts up into his fist, a steady rhythm, rocking like waves at sea, great swells of pleasure, rising, rising…
“Things weren’t great at home, then.
Stupid, fucking useless…
“John?”
“Be willing to conduct a one-on-one interview about your experiences?”
And I will remind you, that you were the one who suggested us doing more in the first place.”
“Christ, please.”
The low rumble of distant thunder echoes outside, and Sherlock steps through the door from the office to the vast warehouse beyond.  There are rows and rows of empty shelves. Nowhere to really hide. It feels like a trap, and he’s painfully aware that he’s just walked straight in.  His brother is likely frantic over his antics. John would chastise him (hopefully he will when Sherlock finds him). He knows all this, and continues deeper into the building anyway.
A private one.
“What we have been doing.”
“It’s not a binding agreement, John.
Just saying…”
‘Course.
“Patience.
He’ll no doubt be thrilled to see you awake.
Sherlock leans back in the chair, squeezes his eyes shut, and tries not to come undone.
His brain finally comes awake.
His voice breaks, and he feels horribly embarrassed.
“Oh thank, Christ.”
First joint sessions are always hard.
“John, I had my labtob in that bag!”
“Are you sure?”
And this afternoon, you were flirting, and I thought…
“I love you.”
limestone floors polished smooth with a century and a half’s foot traffic, polished oak-panelled walls, the long line of portraits of headmasters-past getting more and more modern in style the closer they get to the headmaster’s office.
If known, please share your primary triggers.”
“But if—if you’re okay with that, and you still want to put up with me, then…”
He sees Sherlock swallow, and blink.
She wanders up to Sally’s desk and stands there staring at her as she types up reports.
The silence of the flat at night gets inside him, crawls under his skin like a swarm of cockroaches, itching, itching, until he has to do something, anything, to chase it away.
“Sex?”
It was just that so much had happened immediately afterwards.
He gives the tiniest of nods.
“Wasn’t what?”
Convenient for my brother—and her Majesty’s Secret Service.”
Not sure the two are related.”
It’s pretty relaxing, and a little heady.
The corner of John’s mouth twitches upward.
He’s certainly known it since the moment James Moriarty grinned up at him maniacally and threatened John Watson’s life.
“Right.”
Gorgeous, but in a modest, homely sort of way.
Fuck yes.
He can remember, exactly, the last time he had been troubled in this way.
I—I’ve been rather selfish I suppo…”
I do.
“Thought you said you’d wanted me from the start.”
But I am begging your patience.”
A bowl of Special K and an apple will have to do, and a cup of tea to warm his bones a bit.
“Think you’re confusing yourself with me.
It’s not like he’s sitting right there, not like they’re really doing anything.
Sherlock sits up and tries not to think about the discomfort.
“You’re…”
More silence.
This is the oddest conversation John has ever had in his life and he’s completely riveted.
Sherlock turns to look at him again, and John meets his gaze for only a moment before turning his attention back to the sea with a tight sniff.
“How?”
John had been in the room with him.
His knuckles are blanched white.
This smarts more than anything else.
Sherlock asks without meaning to, and instantly regrets it.
“Hand picked so it puts less stress on the fibres, leaves them straight and intact. Longer fibres mean better yarns, and stronger, softer cotton.”
“I’m sorry.
“You’re bored.
John searches his eyes, and then nods, looks away.
“Was it quite awful?”
“You’re worrying.
So it seems.”
You know that.”
Fascination with his curls seems to be an inherent Watson trait.
“It’s not.
He would die, or kill, or sacrifice everything for Sherlock.
He wills himself to do just that, to be a man, but Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice, or care.
John tilts his chin to blink up at him.
“Does it always hurt?”
Not too spicy, though.”
“We should have precautions in place, though.”
“You know that, yeah?
John’s eyes are still searching his.
“I know.”
“To go take a proper look around.
“Christ.”
He’s utterly lost and completely found all at once.
John takes a sip of coffee and lifts a single earbud to one ear. No talking, just tapping.
It suddenly seems of the utmost importance that there is absolutely nothing between them.
“You cock,” John giggles.
“Pie!”
Just like that.
“Best show it all to me then, since God knows how much of our retirement funds you paid to get the place.
John pulls back to catch his breath.
I’ve been waiting and hoping for weeks.”
“What is it?
“Okay.
The bloke I’m working with, he has a nice place, much nicer than where I was at, and he asked me to move in.”
“Here you are again.”
Sherlock offers her a piece of waffle smeared with Nutella.
“I see you getting yourself all tied in knots.
Sherlock’s eyes drop to John’s swiftly flagging erection.
He can feel the surge of adrenaline race through his veins, and must give some tell, because Sherlock’s head snaps up, and he looks at him, looks at his hand in the envelope, meets his eyes again, and blanches.
“You wanna go t’bed?”
He motions down to his come stained shirt, and half-hard cock.
“Well you know, wouldn’t want people talking.”
The headmaster’s face goes quite red.
She does.  She always does.
Sherlock leans down to grab another handful, and John races out from under the cover of the shed to try and beat him to it.
Sherlock does and John moves around behind him, tries to position himself.
John takes another step forward, reaches out and takes Sherlock’s hand.
I’m enjoying myself—thoroughly.
“The case.
He sets Rosie up on the hearth rug with an assortment of building blocks and colouring books, and then sets to ordering supper.
He sucks in a breath, quivers out on the exhale.
I suppose we could go into the kitchen and eat them ourselves, Bug, what do you say.”
Tell Sherlock that if he can tell us how he got in, there’s a bigger one on it’s way.”
“Just thinking how I didn’t know that Christmas spirit could reduce a bloke to a hormonal teenager.
There’s no point.
John takes the scarf that is medium width, and second softest, and binds him in a figure eight pattern, he ties off in the middle.
You’re not?”
It warms him and weighs him down all at once.
Here.
The Duke nods, and John goes on ahead, ascends the narrow, rickety staircase, the Duke and Sherlock just behind.
Sherlock is completely silent, and he’s glad, he’s fucking grateful, because he’s not sure how he’s getting through this, and he can’t look at him, and he doesn’t have to because Sherlock is sitting stark naked across the room, vulnerable, exposed, at a distance.
Your death.
Most especially not on
It’s easier after that.
John’s urges when Sherlock falls into silence.
“You smell like me.”
“And you didn’t mind the, umm…”
And I have a bad habit of being a dick to people who don’t deserve it.
But when Sherlock somehow manages to push deeper, to curl his finger, just so, just as John is doing to him, John’s mouth drops open, and his eyes flutter shut.
John arcs a brow and Sherlock frowns.
I have put you in a situation of unforgivable danger.”
John feels odd, but Sherlock
What is it I’m meant to be texting?
You are the only ones a present, so you should be relatively undisturbed.”
“Yeah.”
“That’s not it at all.”
John frowns.
“It was for the best,” he says in his defence.  “Like tearing off a plaster.”
What was it brought it altogether?
It’s not tea he wants.
John wonders if it’s shock, or if he just isn’t sure what to do with his hands, so he waits, lifts his hands to cup Sherlock’s face, to trace his thumbs along his cheekbones, and waits.
You’ll be fine, but can you please stop getting injured.
John crawls onto the mattress in the first grey promise of dawn, and glides his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock pulls back a little, and lets his eyes wander, pulling in data from John’s facial expressions, to his flushed cheeks, his pinched brow, his tense body and flagging erection.
Best to get this over with.
John grins, a little heady at the knowledge.
“People don’t do that.”
“You sit down and eat.
Sullying all that white purity beneath.
John tilts in, until their lips brush against each other.
Even since we’ve been here, I…”
“Because I worked for him.”
Sherlock blinks up at John from the too cold floor, in the too bright room.
“Ta.”
John huffs and takes another nibble of biscuit.
The door to the loo, swings open, and Sherlock appears, a pale, naked streak across the room, as he shuts the window, and then hurriedly crawls back into bed.
“Sorry.
“I’m always going to be here, you know”
He goes, and Sherlock doesn’t try to stop him, because he doesn’t know what he would say, and he’s equal parts confused and mortified.
Sherlock makes his way to the end of the hall, and stops dead at the entrance to the kitchen.  The only light in the room is that on the vent hood above the cooker, and two candles in the middle of the neatly set kitchen table.  It’s homely, warm, and inviting.
John’s head drops back and he stares up at the ceiling as though begging heavenly entities for strength.
He buys her flowers the next day.
You want to get in here with me?”
Could just look at a person and tell you everything about them: their profession, where they’d just flown in from, how many siblings they had—hell, even things only their therapist knew.
“Wherever you would like,” Sherlock replies with confidence.
For a moment I was afraid it was going to be the Vicar.”
“But why?
Unfortunately, I very much doubt we will find him alive.”
“Yes.”
His head throbs.
“It’s okay…
In a way it had been.
“I’ll be fine.”
You should come back to bed while you can.”
“Could we—go to bed?”
He’s never seen John blush before.
John whispers.
Every muscle in John’s body lets loose.
I do watch the news, you know.”
He is clearly starving.
You want me to pay?
His eyes travel to John’s stomach, sticky with his come.
Sherlock shakes his head.
You’re fine.
“Yes.
I’m trying to help you understand your reactions to him touching you, I assume you meant with tenderness, in moments of physical or sexual intimacy?”
“And he worked for you.”
“I’m not angry.”
He looks content, happy even.
She resented it, and he’s fairly sure she sent him the photos just as punishment: ‘
“I have not.”
From one ear to the other, over and over again, until John thinks he can maybe feel it sinking into his blood, his bones, rewiring his brain, cracking something open inside him.
He slips a small headset over John’s head, but doesn’t place the ends in his ears.
Sherlock tucks his knees up against his chest, crosses his arms over them, and turns away again, resting his head on his knees, staring off at nothing in particular.
If you’re not too busy.”
John cranes his neck around to peek over the back of his chair.
“And you can stop, too, okay.
It will stick to your bones and keep you warm.
She balls both her hands into fists on the tabletop, squeezes hard, takes a deep breath and then let’s go.
Your brother?
He slides his hands over the length of John’s thighs, and hollows his cheeks, and finds a rhythm, and John lets out a strangled whine that Sherlock thinks might be the end of him, then and there.
“Fine.
He sucks in a quavering breath.
He sees Sherlock understand, gives him an almost imperceptible nod, and then tenses, ready to spring the second Sherlock gives the signal.
You seem to have been managing just fine with that these last couple of months.”
He has a way of reading people and using that to his advantage.
Sherlock sobers.
The clouds rolling in from the sea are heavy and dark grey, plunging everything into an artificial dusk.
He holds out his hand.
He wanted the relationship to only go so far, and now—now things will start to fall apart.
“I’ve spent the last seven years trying to figure it out.
Watson, that’s so.”
“Alright.
And there it is, the tension, all returning in an instant.
Soup and toast sound okay for lunch?”
I want us to be together, Sherlock.
“Not compared to Mycroft, or even Mummy.”
“Me too.”
After a few more minutes of things clattering against the vanity in the loo, Sherlock reappears in doorway to the bedroom.
“I cannot fathom anything you might want that could make that a possibility.”
“I think that was the ghost of William Edwards.”
When he seems to have pulled himself together, he continues.
“Yeah.
“Yes.”
His eyebrows arch to the ceiling before he catches himself and punctuates the expression with a dramatic roll of his eyes.
But, I missed you too.”
John drapes Sherlock’s coat and scarf over the arm of the chair by the lounge door, and then passes through into the foyer, and then the kitchen.
“Ah Mike.
He strips, folds his clothes neatly over the arm of the chair beside his wardrobe and then flops down on the mattress, naked, and stares at the ceiling.
Sherlock is panting, but he rolls into John’s arms eagerly, smearing his lips against John’s neck, hands scrambling around and behind to grasp John’s arse and pull him close.
I about punched him.
“I know, John.
John slams his head back against the pillow, and balls up the sheet beneath him in two white-knuckled fists.
He’s still naked, and John enjoys the view as he heads out the door to the loo, and then rolls over onto his good shoulder, and rolls the bad one out a bit.
“Do you want it to be?”
Well, did it ever occur to you that maybe I don’t?
“But thanks.”
Sherlock’s voice is like caramel, thick, and rich, and sweet.
It had to be enough.
Shall I award you a trophy.”
He hears his nose break.
Important news.
Sherlock stops breathing.
“He’s surprisingly docile.
“John.”
John watches him, looks up when Sherlock pauses at a small, pale pock mark, an old scar, one of many strung along John’s ribs like pearls.
Not sure I have to tell you everything we talk about.
Well, not if it’s going to inconvenience you, I…”
This is a bit of a short chapter, but I didn't want to leave you all hanging.  Next one will be longer.
And just a teensy bit disappointed.
“It’s something I’m going to say because I need you to know it, and I need you to know it because—you matter to me.”
Sherlock curls tighter.
Killer, I thought these were suicides?
“Quite selfishly, I’m glad you’ve found your way back to Baker Street.
Pity.
Wait.
“No.”
“So you mean that you’d never…?”
“Well, ta.”
Sherlock reaches up and runs his fingers through John’s hair, until he pulls back and looks at him.
But does it help you?
fingers itch all over again at the memory, yearn to learn the individual rise and fall of each vertebra, the silky slide of the soft, untouched skin there, to experiment with that touch and watch how John’s body responds.
“And the real diagnosis?
He nods, and he looks.
She looks up at the Duke and grows pale.
John will have been up for hours.
Not much taller than John, but much more slight.
“Why are we talking about this?”
You owe it to him, Sherlock.
“Mmm.
Breathe.
“John.”
He holds out a hand.
“Yes.
He’s changed, it’s true—nasolabial folds are deeper, corners of the mouth starting to draw down, flesh under the chin softening.
He sits down on the futon and takes John in.
“Obviously.”
to go to the school, to see the boy’s room, interview the other students, learn more about the German professor, Heidegger by name.
But given her profession, she must have had a phone?
Sherlock peeks up from from his book and finds John staring.
be experimentation, fun for a while, and then he will move on to other things.
“Have you…?”
Sherlock shakes his head.
Like an unexpected slap in the face he feels the breath go out of him.
Sherlock does, without hesitation, without question.
God, yeah.”
Harry and Sherlock stand in the centre of the lounge facing one another.
“Yes.”
Ella leans back in her chair, sets her pen down.
But leave your shirt.
“What do you…?”
But not ‘stop’.
Yeah?
“Not long.”
Well, at least I think it is.”
“You can take your time…”
And though it is not his sin to atone for, it touches Sherlock none-the-less.
“More.”
Sherlock blinks into his microscope, and then looks up.
“That the truth?”
“You—you remember the West End Murders in ‘90, yeah?
It’s quiet and warm in the car.
There’s a text.
“You’re anxious.
His phone buzzes on the nightstand, and he reaches down and picks it up.
Comforting to see the NHS is still so committed to patient confidentiality, but it does him no good.
“For what?”
“It’s addressed to you, why would you think I had anything to do with it?”
We must find him, before…”
“You have no idea.”
We’re—we’re us, but we’re not that, you know.
I mean it.
You, your attention, your care, your—your love.
It’s not as though he has anything else to do.
“Does it matter?
“You’re my best friend, and—I’ve loved you for years.”
You’ll be there.
He blinks at it blearily.
“Perfect.”
Not sure how accurate that is, but there’s anxiety, occasional rage.
The trash bin is empty.
It’s not angry.
And Sherlock’s like that.
John wonders how much of him is visible on camera.
“Come down here.
Tomorrow Sherlock turns forty-six.
“Probably should have waited to say that.
“All of them.”
John holds Sherlock tighter, and crushes the corner of the envelope in his fist, white knuckled, suddenly furious that this is still happening, that she is still trying to reach out from beyond the grave and have her say, have her way, come between them.
His eyes go wide and then darken with want.
A gift for Rosie, and news of you.”
There is nothing more confusing, trying (or intoxicating), than a person with an unfailingly strong and unyielding moral compass.
For a moment he thinks John is going to hit him, and then he thinks he might cry, and finally he feels a deep, aching regret when John’s shoulders drop and he steps away, turns away, drops to his knees and starts gathering up the pieces of the half-assembled toy from the carpet.
John follows in his wake, and only realises, after it’s too late, that Sherlock is headed straight for the condoms.
“Yes.
His brain shuts off.
God, you—your…”
“Where’s Rosie?”
He spins around.
“What it is you’re going to say.”
He gets to his feet, left hand balled into a white-knuckled fist, and moves across the room to his computer, where he sits down, and pulls up his contacts.
It all happens so quickly his brain doesn’t have time to catch up, and then a boot is hitting him in the ribs, and all he can do is curl tight, do his utmost to protect everything important, and hope beyond hope that John isn’t far behind him.
“They assign you a therapist when you get back.
God.”
And then John is blinking and sputtering as a spray of water hits him square in the face.
Yeah.
John jerks his head in acknowledgement.
When you were at school, you mean?”
He manages to calm himself enough to do exactly has he’s been instructed, and though there are a couple of very close calls, one which elicits a shout from John and strangled cry from Holdernesse, yards below, they do make it to the bottom in one piece in the end, Arthur running into his father’s arms, and Sherlock turning to look around for John, only to find him kneeling on the damp stone beside Wilder’s body, covering his face with a jacket.
John’s voice is low, and soft, and close enough that Sherlock can feel his breath whisper over his lips and nose as he speaks.
Good.”
John takes up his glass again, and takes a long pull.
Sherlock goes behind the camera, and adjusts some settings and then tosses a small remote in the air, and catches it as he walks back over to where John is sitting.
“You want me to kiss you.”
Well, here we are, almost at the end!  Chapter 20 will be an epilogue.  Thanks to everyone who has been on this journey with me, especially for your patience with the update schedule.  As always, I am so appreciative of your support, your kudos, your lovely comments, and for all those who have recced this fic elsewhere.  I truly have the best readers.
“When my brother was at Cambridge, there was a boy.
And I—“
Sherlock takes in the droop of his shoulders, the loose fingered fist resting on the mantle, the way he favours his bad leg.
Saw a dog in a rucksack on the tube.
Sherlock decides to take a risk.  he slides his hands all the way to the top of John’s thighs, and stops, strokes his thumbs along John’s inseam, and watches, fascinated as John’s breath stutters, and his eyes drop shut, and his hips roll bringing the tips of Sherlock’s thumbs in contact with his aching, eager cock.  His breath catches in a small grunt, like someone has just punched him in the stomach, and Sherlock thinks it a good sign, like perhaps he would like more, and so he lifts one hand from John’s thigh and presses it there, the whole of his palm.
John is scrubbing out a skillet in the sink.
They’ve been dancing around one another for too long now, anyway.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe the way things were wasn’t enough even when we had it?”
“When did you get ahold of my phone long enough to…?”
Sherlock pouts and John huffs out a laugh.
“What?
She stares at him for a moment, and then laughs tentatively, no doubt gauging his reaction.
Mommy wanted prints of the photos from last Christmas.
He reaches out and slides a finger along one rib.
Shit.
John cranes his neck around, and looks up at him.
Sherlock brings both cups to the table, and the left-over box of biscuits.
In truth John’s heart is racing a million beats a second, his veins flooding with adrenaline, but not because of this lunatic, no.
Second a desk lamp with a burned out lightbulb, and a new one lying on the desk beside it.
“Mmm.”
She made you a badge?”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything.
John whines.
He seems capable.
He had felt the pain as though it was his own.
He unzips, reaches inside his pants, and moans loud at the sensation of his cold hand wrapping around his hot cock.
“So?”
And then he splashes John again.
John shakes his head.
“Here.”
“So what?
“Jesus…”
There is something incredibly grounding about it—Sherlock’s weight pressing his body into the mattress, Sherlock’s cock pressing into the crease of his thigh, and his pressing against the firm planes of Sherlock’s stomach.
“Move.”
“Make a choice.”
He lifts a hand to Sherlock’s head and knots his fingers in his hair.
He thumbs open his recent calls and is just about to tap on Sherlock’s number when the mobil buzzes in his hand.
I thought you just said you wanted to shag me.”
Good-night.”
“Nice.”
It’s not his birthday, it’s not any sort of anniversary, John’s not done anything particularly brilliant of late, and besides, Sherlock doesn’t go in for all that sort of thing anyway.
Right now there is a case to be solved.
Isn’t that my line?
“Try to run, and I’ll finish what I started.”
“You were overwhelmed.
He knows that it is difficult for John, and the fact that he sits quietly, and submits to it, no tension in his body at all, feels significant.
Takes a photo every sixty seconds, which means someone broke in, came in and splashed some paint around and got out all in less than sixty seconds.
“Morning.”
John Watson doesn’t need to know anything beyond the mask he has so carefully crafted for himself.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, but John shivers a little as he nuzzles the neck of John’s shirt aside with his nose, like a demanding cat, and presses his lips just below John’s suprasternal notch.
You’ll feel better.”
John grins.
He thinks only of the game, and seems to delight in all the puzzles Moriarty sets before him.
“John?”
Sherlock wonders if it’s because he’s been sneaking alcohol to work with him, or because he’s cut back enough that he’s started to feel better.
This isn’t Dickens, you know.”
“Your eye.”
“Room service, eh?
“Let me try things I’d never have tried other wise, I suppose.
And John feels a twit.
“You’re on the mend, I think.”
He scoops up two snowballs, and rolls rather than crawls to the end of the garden bed.
I guess I’ve never met a bloke who didn’t like sex.
“I didn’t know any of that when I let this house.”
Sherlock tears his eyes away from John to take the key card from the young man at the check-in desk.
He’d awoken that morning with high hopes, with plans, plans to woo John, to draw him more deeply into the fold, but now here he is, blundering and destroying all his own best laid plans, once again, and it’s too important!
“Mmm…”
Why?”
John’s pulse is racing.
He blinks, his grip on the counter behind him, growing so tight Sherlock wonders if a chunk might not break off in his hands.
Sherlock pushes back a bit more.
“I look forward to putting up with you.”
You should say if I did.”
And then John is pulling his pants down over his hips.
There is no mike stand visible, so John figures he must have mounted it overhead somehow.
You’ve helped me—when I needed it.”
“Sherlock relaxes beneath him.
“Yes.”
He holds his hands and stares at the middle of Sherlock’s chest.
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
The camera is on a tripod pointing toward that.
Sherlock just shakes his head against John’s neck.
And still John looks.
“Yeah, we should.
Still, he pulls his dressing gown closed and ties it around his waist just to be on the safe side.
“Apologies aren’t necessary.”
The rustling on the other end of the line increases.
John cups his phone in his hands, and leans over against the window, forming a sort of cocoon with his body.
Or perhaps it’s just that she’s worn him as well as herself out with all her screaming.
I mean I like to come sometimes, same as most people, but it doesn’t have to be the usual ways.”
“Ahh, good.
“Just breathe.”
John sucks in a deep, desperate breath, like a man drowning.
He should be fine with it.
It’s tender, and slow, and deep, and Sherlock can feel John lose himself to it after a minute or two, his body drawing nearer, and nearer until they're pressed together, limbs naturally entwining, bodies slotting together, and Sherlock can feel John pressed against his belly, growing harder again, and not minding.
That is where they will either rise together or fall apart.
John huffs.
“I like the way you see.”
“Where would we go?”
Sherlock’s mouth waters, and he reaches out, looks up at John’s face, to be sure, and when he sees nothing but raw, open hunger there he trails a single finger over the the line of John’s cock, listens to his breath catch, and then release in a small huff.
“Duke?”
“Just there, beside that dresser.”
Tea first?”
You have fun with whatever game it is you’re playing at.”
“Is it salvageable?”
Jesus, if I was there…
“Don’t exhaust yourself, John.
They make a good team, he thinks.
By the light outside he estimates it to be around 10:00.
He’s fully clothed, and Sherlock is completely naked, and the whole thing is odd, and hot, and slightly disorienting, but he’s still so hard he can barely stand it, and he wonders if that is a part of it too, if Sherlock wants to be the one to loose him, to bring him relief.
But really, it would be colder without the snow.
“Yes, we should.”
Sherlock reaches out and pulls John in against his body.
Just give them what they want and this will all be over.”
He picks it up, and finds it empty.
“Fuck!”
“In two weeks then…”
“Closer.
Again, John.”
Their respective YouTube channels languish for awhile, to the point that people start getting angry in the comments.
“Fine.
John looks pained for the briefest of moments, but then he sniffs again, and sits back in his chair with a scowl.
Something in John’s chest clenches tight.
“You didn’t come.”
Come now.
“Yeah.”
He can feel his cheeks going hot, and his eyes pricking.
I’m sorry.”
“You saw me an hour ago in the car.
John does the same.
“Yes, I imagine he does.”
It’s barely a whisper, but Sherlock’s eyes are full again, sincere.
“Yes.”
“No.”
A bloke like him?
A little disappointing, honestly.
And how’s my brother?”
It’s almost imperceptible, but John knows him so intimately by now, that he can see it, feel it in the air between them.
John shakes his head.
John gasps, and Sherlock buries his face there, breathes in the musky arousal.
He mostly watches John eat, mesmerised by the way he licks the tomato sauce and olive oil from his lips, leaving them glistening and stained slightly orange at the corners.
And so John begins to massage, firm but gentle strokes, and it isn’t long before Sherlock’s mouth falls open with a long moan that breaks off into a series of desperate whines, and he starts to come, and come, and come.
on it.”
“Why?  You want to.”
But he’s never voiced it.
“What?”
“Me too,” Sherlock mouths against his neck.
From the 50s - 70s.
He looks down.
I’m sorry.”
“I started pressing and stroking, and this thing started building.
It’s liable to fall into the sea one of these days, but if you don’t mind the risk…”
“Of course.
“I’m saying that clear expectations make you feel safe.
“Didn’t know I’d lost it.”
“Quite a different conversation.”
I did what I was told.
How do I smell?”
“It’s between lunch and tea.
A man who heals for a living, and who would be horrified to know the things that Sherlock had done in those early days when he’d felt lost and adrift.
Sherlock nods.
Nothing over 45 minutes.
That must be it.
People should love who they love.”
I told you.
Sherlock, who seems so controlled, so serious much of the time, cracks wide open when he kisses, lets John taste a little bit of his soul.
He swings his legs over the side of the mattress.
Snatching up his laptop, charge cord, and glass of whiskey, he climbs back into bed, puts his headphones on, and clicks the thumbnail.
Sherlock pulls the nutcracker close to his chest like an infant.
He never would have guessed that he and Sherlock were brothers at just a glance.
It was easier when I was dead and not coming back.”
Not in the way you’re thinking.
D.I. Lestrade mumbles around a mouthful of doughnut, as he leans back in his desk chair, doughnut in one hand and paper coffee cup in the other.
The landlord.”
I only fished your ungrateful arse out of the Thames in the middle of the bloody night, in the middle of fucking January, but okay.”
“Sherlock.”
“What’s gotten into you?”
“You said things could stay as they were.”
They take the train.
“Alright.
Sometimes you have a good time, and sometimes you don’t.
Sherlock takes his time getting up.
No obvious connections.
John gets to his feet and stares down at Sherlock sitting on the floor, knees splayed open as he leans back on one hand.
John interjects, his hand reaching across the space between their two chairs, to rest momentarily on Sherlock’s knee, before retreating again.
“Do you want help?”
“Kind of like this one.
“Yes.”
He goes to the chair by the desk, takes up his coat.
“Come on.
“Is it?”
“Was a nice surprise hearing back from you.”
“Would you like to continue on this topic?”
“Felt strange being there.
“Some of them, maybe, but you have to ask him.”
He looks over at his phone, he was going to do a personal video for Sherlock, maybe he could…
They emerge from the woods beside Friston Hill Road, and follow it back to St. Mary’s Church, where they turn back onto their own lane, and head back toward the cottage.
It’s completely unexpected.
It aches.
“Jesus.
“John?”
“You didn’t.”
“And you have me tied up in knots…”
Sherlock’s eyes drag over his body in appreciation.
Sorry I’m such a mess.
“I’m not sure.”
John’s fingers stir between his.
“ENOUGH GAMES!”
He strokes once, and falls back against his pillow, his eyes sliding shut, mouth falling open.
“Did you like the touch with the pool?
All he says.
He looks delighted.
“Yeah.
He mouths against John’s neck.
John asks, as they both settle in for the brief drive.
Bring me the chocolate croissant.
It’s a poem my brother used to read me.
“Yes, well…
Dunno.
He surges forward, straight toward Sherlock at incredible speed, and John only just has time to lunge out into the room and shout a warning for him to stop, before he’s on them.
John pops up onto his elbows.
Sherlock’s shirt is clinging to his back with sweat, as he turns away.
When they finally come back up for air, Sherlock feels a like he may just have his legs under him again.
I—I didn’t…”
“Well, that’s the question, isn’t it…”
You wanna show me where?”
“For what?”
I’ve stated my feelings as plainly as I know how.
Safe enough, ready enough to be—to just
It’s a risk, a big one, but as far as affectionate gestures go, he wagers it’s a fairly innocuous one.
This is one of those situations that John usually handles so poorly, but he’s been trying, with Ella’s help he’s been trying, and he doesn’t want to get this wrong, because after the other day at pond it had seemed that Sherlock was just starting to trust him, and he doesn’t want to ruin that, not now, not when it’s been such a long time coming, and is still so tenuous a thing.
“How are your ribs?”
“I mean, I know people survive falls like that, but…
“Don’t.”
John doesn’t bother to reply.
For my own safety, you understand.
He’s at Baker Street.
It takes John a moment for his brain to catch up.
Sherlock moans.
“Shouldn’t you be offering her one?”
“I thought you hated me for awhile.”
Sherlock pulls back and looks down at him.
He’ll never be bored.
“So we going to head West tomorrow?
“What if I told you, you were right?”
“One a week.
They lay there in silence a long time.
Almost done.
John is embarrassed, but grateful.
I mean sex.
The sooner you’re here, the better.”
His cheeks are brilliant red.
He grunts, and then moans long and loud, back arching off the mattress as he spills over his hand and chest.
You have purpose.
“This you trying to force me to go?
I just need you to know that I recognise that I miscalculated the effect my absence would have, and I am truly, deeply and sincerely sorry.”
“You’ll stay?”
“I’m sorry.”
“People usually define it as
“If you must.
Sherlock breathes, moves, and John watches, flushed and fond, as Sherlock’s cock gives a twitch of interest.
John looks up, eyes slightly wide at the sudden shift in Sherlock’s tone.
There’s a woman that sometimes comes right afterwards.
Miss me already?”
He can feel his cheeks start to burn.
There’s a long pause, and John wonder’s if he’s overstepped, if he’s that fucking transparent.
John sighs, and rolls his shoulders to stretch out some of the tension, and then turns when he reaches the first step up to their flat, takes the lapels of Sherlock’s coat in hand and pulls him into a slow, deep kiss.
“You could say that.
“Don’t.
I don’t like personal attention where they look right in your eyes.
Yeah.”
“You sleep at all?”
“I love you.”
John sighs again.  “Can you say something—anything?  Just so I know you’re alright.”
And John does know.
It’s something I’ve been handling.
“How much do you remember?”
Sherlock thinks that perhaps they should get up, start off for the small villages at the border of the park, but John makes no motion to do so.
There had been Victor, at least.
“The room has been left wholly untouched.”
“A little.”
It’s not the first time the John in his head has said something of this kind.
It is only mottled glass.
“Will you stay?”
“Oh yeah?
John sniffs beside him.
“Mmm.  Just this weather.”
Sometimes he wishes they would just kill him and be done with it.
John orders a salad and a cup of tea.
Do you have any fucking idea how much?!”
“Oh, look who’s here.”
And not just what you feel for him, but what he feels for you, what he’s always felt for you, by the way.
Must want it, need it,
The night before comes rushing back.
“Because you’re overly concerned with things that don’t matter.”
There is a long stretch of silence, so long that Sherlock’s curiosity finally gets the better of him, and he peeks over his shoulder.
And what are those?”
“Mm, yes.”
John is at work, and Rosie at nursery.
Mrs. Hudson’s lovely, but you know—I think she sort of feels like I need to be drinking broth through a straw.
“He’s fucking brilliant, I won’t argue you that, but I didn’t think business was quite that booming.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Can’t believe you.”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say.  He reaches blindly for John’s hand, and when he finds it, John takes his, without hesitation, meshes their fingers and squeezes.
He’s warm, and Sherlock rolls into that warmth on instinct, feels his body light up when John hums in contentment, presses his nose into John’s hair, breathing deep, again, and again, and again, memorising the scent of him.
“I’m big.”
“Felt like my fault.”
I can’t condemn her for something I would, without hesitation, do myself.”
He thinks of watching Sherlock sleep, curls falling softly over a furrowed brow, lids fluttering, and how John had almost physically ached to be there, spooned behind him on the sofa where he could watch over him, feel and know that he was safe.
Listen to you.
They gasp in unison, and John goes very still.
Sherlock nods.
John grins, and hands the garland to Sherlock.
John bites out.
He runs a hand down John’s spine, and buries his nose in his hair, and breathes in the scent of
John huffs into his hair.
“Do you recruit all your siblings, then?
Sherlock gives an excited little wiggle of his hips, which John finds bloody endearing, god help him.
And John has nothing to say to that, of course.
Sherlock looks over and catches his eye.
“Yeah?”
Moriarty.”
“John.”
Some bloke kitted out like he’s on his way to a Comic Convention, taking down a thief outside a tiny corner shop.
He reaches down and inches his fingers between the throw pillow and his body, drags his palm slowly over the bulge beneath his pyjama bottoms.
John reaches out and steals the last of the biscuit off Sherlock’s plate, which elicits a look of shock and hearty objection.
He’s said his apologies again, and again, and again, and he doesn’t know what more he can do to make things right.
Sherlock has to tear his eyes away as an uncharacteristic jolt of adrenaline and wave of nausea rushes over him.
Maybe it’s what Mycroft had mentioned.
“At any rate, that’s when I got the idea to let it.”
“Were there any other casualties at the scene?”
John sighs,
“And just who else would be to blame?”
Water if you have it.”
John shudders a little, and then sniffs, and sits up a little straighter.
“Yeah.”
“John?”
He waits, and waits, and waits, and tries not to be too disappointed when no response comes.
He hears him tear off some toilet roll and blow his nose.
It seemed to help you when you needed it, and it has not been without its merits these last couple of years.”
Sherlock slides his hand over John’s, and John hadn’t realised how cold he was until the warmth of Sherlock’s large, warm hand surrounds his small, icy one.
I thought that was the end of it.
“This is not a trivial matter, Mr. Holmes.”
He slips into the bedroom and toes into his trousers, slips a jumper over his head, and dons his coat and scarf just as John sees the woman out with another string of apologies.
My mum got this recipe (or at least one that was almost exactly this) from her dad, who got it from his mum, and we used to have them a lot when I was a kid.
“What does?”
John’s fingers weave into his hair, and settle.
It seems like you’re feeling something.”
I know I keep saying that, but it’s only been a couple of weeks, and I need time to see how it will be.
He can feel the warmth of Sherlock’s hand sitting next to his hip on the seat between them.
Was that really necessary?”
“I’ll meet you there Saturday, if I decide to come.”
John stuffs his phone back in his pocket and gets to his feet.
His shoulder aches.
Sherlock’s eyes slip shut the minute he’s tucked back beneath the blankets.
Maybe I never got the chance to become anything.”
John sits all the way up, props a pillow behind his back and lets Sherlock set the tray on his lap.
“Sherlock, what are you feeling right now?”
But I need you.
He sighs.
“You’re worrying.
I’m sorry.
Sherlock’s breath catches.
“Told you months ago I’m all in.
John looks very serious.
“You’re a madman, you know that.
“What?
“And so?” Huxtable insists.
“I’ve thought of leaving.”
Sherlock pouts.
“Umm…”
Promise.”
It’s—it’s just a thing he does.”
But still—sometimes he wishes they would take the choice from his hands.
Sherlock nods against John’s hair, and John makes a small sound, deep and needy, and then slides out, and in again, experimentally.  The drag of it is painful, not near enough lubrication.  He feels John register it, shivers at the growl of frustration he makes.
One can’t create beauty, true art, until they’ve mastered the basics, so…
She’d liked him, she’d liked her roommate.
Sherlock approaches the sofa where John is laid out, and hesitates.
“Me?”
Sherlock has seen it, admired it, submitted and yielded in the face of it, but now he has John close, feels that tension pressed against him, contained, all but vibrating with the need for release, he wonders what John might look like, feel like, were he to ever come wholly undone, not in a moment of desperate, broken rage, but raw, vulnerable, open instead.
“How are you being compensated?”
“So…?”
But John just shakes his head.  “Unless it’s you who doesn’t want to do this, which is fine, by the way, let’s not talk about this, okay.”
But not on my watch.”
Peppermint.
“So?”
“Well, are you trying?!”
He wants to go home.
Tucked behind the bookcase is a small assortment of canvases, half finished paintings in oils, and some lovely watercolours.
He swallows.
I feel it too.
“Oh, this you letting me pick?”
Then we’ll proceed.”
“You need to clean those out good when we get back.
“Good morning, Watson.
Just—try to relax.”
I saw how it affected you, just now, that video.”
“Should get going, I guess.”
“You laughing at me?”
That is what it was about today, and Sherlock should put it out of his head.
It was a bit of subconscious attention getting, I imagine.”
No one’s ever…
John nods once.
“Get up.”
Sherlock’s hand presses, down, down, holds him under, and John looks up at him from the rippling depths, confusion, betrayal, terror.
You’re right.
John self-consciously lifts a hand to his beard, smooths his fingers over it, and then up through his limp, unwashed hair, slicking it back.
He’s lovely, John thinks, in the way seeing a sunrise the morning after you never thought you’d wake again is lovely, or how the first sip of bracing coffee on an icy day is lovely, or how the night sky is lovely, when you are miles from anywhere, and it is simply a sea of light in the deep, velvet black.
“Don’t you dare.”
John slips his own on, sets his phone on his nightstand and lays down.
“You should eat.”
John suddenly realises that work is something he and Sherlock haven’t even discussed since everything happened.
John looks up, needle still hovering threateningly close to his arm.  “Why?  Always together, isn’t that what you said to me six months ago?  Together or not at all.  You promised.  We vowed, so…  This is what we’re doing now, it seems.”
John laughs, because the shift in mood is so sudden, Sherlock so eager, and everything so utterly beyond belief, that he can’t help himself.
“Yeah, I know, but this…”
“Stay.
They assign you one when you get back.
There was a time John would have been taken aback by such candour, but Sherlock is different these days, has been for awhile really, and there’s something about the open, honest, but slightly tentative way he asks that makes John more amenable than usual to share.
Sometimes you just do things.
Sometimes, if we were alone and no one else was there, he liked it if I combed my hands through his hair.
Sherlock nods, and rubs his thumbs inside John’s knees again.
“Well with the way that snow is coming down, and they way you are feeling, if they want to talk to you, they can bloody well come here, tomorrow.
You’re less impressive than I’d anticipated.
“Oh yeah?”
There is something he can’t quite peg in John’s manner, tone, in the way he treads soft and careful around the kitchen, barely making a sound, making himself small and silent.
“Thank you.
“A man actually.”
He’s got every available man on this, I know that for a fact.”
Two years thinking I’d failed you in every way a bloke can fail a friend, and—and now you just want to come home, and go back to the way things were?
No, I’m not interested in Irene Adler in any way that would matter to you.
Sherlock hears Mrs Hudson’s radio click on downstairs, the water in her kitchen sink turn on and then off.
“But you’re not.”
I’m an idiot.
Thought he was off on the scent of another case.
The thought that they should slow down momentarily crosses his mind, but then Sherlock is pressing down on him, full weight, wet body, rock hard cock, and his head drops as he cants his hips and moans loud against John’s forehead.
John just shrugs.
Anything interesting to report?
It is always damp.
“I said no.”
And perhaps it is, in a way, but so what?
High security.
He winces.
“Can you help me.”
“At my cock?”
“I don’t want to hurt you.”
It was important to me.
“Sher, doggies!”
John waggles a brow and Sherlock rolls his eyes, before setting his teacup down on the floor.
So close.
Sherlock lolls his head to the side and opens his eyes.
He never gets much sun here, but when he does it’s always in the late morning.
Holdernesse looks down at the ground for a moment, before looking back up and meeting Sherlock’s eyes squarely and with confidence.
“Mmm.”
“Oh no.”
“We’ve made a bit of a mess.”
He returns to their shared room, even though supper is still hours away, and finds John sitting cross-legged on one of the beds, with his laptop propped open.
“It’s not your story anymore.”
“So loyal.”
Sherlock’s lips press against his scalp.
“I want to take my pants off,” John clarifies.
John hesitates with his hand on the door to the cab.
John’s eyes drop, almost shyly, but when he looks back up, he’s smiling.
That would be…
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, dead serious.
He goes back to stroking his thigh with the other, and Sherlock moans, and arches upward.
“Don’t be stupid.”
Just get locked up in my own head so much, that when things yank me out, I tend to notice.”
Sherlock sighs, and shrugs out of his t-shirt, before scooping the shirt that goes to his costume up off the bed.
“And you?”
Sherlock is overwhelmed quickly, but he doesn’t want to stop.
Okay.”
Their bodies glide together easily now, and Sherlock massages the entrance to John’s body in small circular motions that match John’s thrusts in speed and intensity.
Sherlock’s instinct is to scoff, but he seems paralysed by the possibility, that for some reason has not occurred to him until now.
“What do you think?”
John tries.
Sherlock has just spent a long, lazy hour snogging him senseless, and he still feels a little boneless.
Let’s go.”
“Only if you don’t know what to look for.”
He smiles wryly at that.
“Morning.
I’ll just…”
“Jealousy, yes.
Sherlock reaches for the glass, once John drains it, and John hands it to him, takes the apple when offered, eats it when ordered.
“And I don’t particularly care.”
“It’s not you, okay.”
“He also painted.”
“He just disappeared.
. You can choose your measure type by selecting the appropriate radio button at the top of the recipe page, which is handy.
Taking a deep breath, he does his best to delete any residual images from earlier, and finishes changing.
And Christ, God in heaven, WHY?
“Like I said.
You don’t like it?”
He offers.
It’s not a topic they’ve ever discussed.
I didn’t.”
He is tired, he suddenly realises, too tired to even shower.
John looks down at the paper, and then tucks it in his pocket before taking a sip of what turns out to be truly awful coffee.
And he kisses him, and tries to forget the rest, because Sherlock is right.
He’s in a bad position, hands pulled behind his back and bound to his ankles.
No ninja skills required in the Army?”
Man of the year!"
I could be a complete dolt.
“Hey, Sherlock…?”
“Yes, you can undress me.”
Just…”
“John?”
Jesus, ‘course I am.
Be careful.”
It’s always helpful to know how people form associations, how that influences what gives them pleasure.
Christ, you…
The man grins affably.
Okay.
After a moment he nods.
Maybe.
“Breathe with me.
“Stop it!”
What had happened in the garden earlier, what had happened between them in the kitchen only moments before, all of it is something Sherlock could only hope and dream of up to now.
Sherlock’s arms hang limp at his side, and he doesn’t say anything, do anything.
“I don’t want any part in it.”
“I forgive you.”
Besides, thought you were trying to get rid of me.”
capable of booking a B&B, John.”
“I know.
Pick up, Sherlock.
Just want to ask you a few questions,” John calls down the corridor again.
Sherlock pushes to his feet and heads for the closet, and his clothes, wills his body to settle and calm.
John remembers a knit brow, and worrying hands, a lack of words.
“Her own brother killed her?”
John’s eyes drift up to his.
It had been bloke-on-bloke.
“What do you want me to be doing?”
“Fine.”
“That good?”
It feels incredible, and John can’t help but grind against Sherlock’s stomach, just a little, just a tiny little rock of his hips, and then another.
He waves his hand about in an all encompassing gesture.
John blinks at him.
Okay.
the correspondence between the boy and his father, his mother.
She always goes to the pet shelter on Wednesdays to drop off donations.
He dips down and brushes his nose through John’s hair, it’s enough for John to look back up at him, lick his lips slow in anticipation.
Your videos, you inviting me to help with your research, and your cases, it gave me something to do, it took my mind off certain things.
“John, it’s alright.”
Then listen.”
“On the 29th of January then.”
It’s you I love, it’s you who makes me happy—not the fucking cases.
“Are you?”
“Yes…
It’s barely a whisper, but Sherlock’s eyes are full again, sincere.
John’s donned his warning tone.
“Are you alright?”
His brother just looks smug.
Sherlock sets the ladle down on the counter, and moves toward him, stopping mere inches away.
Kneels on the mattress before John and holds out his wrists.
And, last, but not least: No, sex is not a requirement of anything you and I might decide to pursue, but I am not averse to it.”
He stares down at the slight bulge in his pyjamas with a scowl.
“Perhaps.”
Wonder if a bloke like that could ever…”
He didn’t seem to care.”
Very Shakespeare.”
He’d had a couple of bad trips in uni.
Sherlock’s fingers curl around his phone.
“No.  But you are.”
Should we just freeze to death?”
You have a client.”
“It’s about time, you.”
John is clearly still feeling ill, and his tolerance for noise and jostle, visibly low, but he seems pleased to be out of the flat, away from Rosie, just the two of them, and the cold air seems to be soothing his head.
“Feel better?”
I’ll give him a ring.
“Sherlock?”
“Pants on or off?”
“You’re fine.
He’s not entirely sure he’s awake.
They’re just words!
“Can we go back to Question 4?”
Sherlock cocks a brow.
London’s a great city, isn’t it?
It’s to do with death and fate.”
“Can I ask you something else?”
“Go put her to bed.”
He’s not hard, but he’s hot and full; a delicious, yielding weight against Sherlock’s leg, a heft and shape that suggests something much more impressive than any of Sherlock’s wildest fantasies given John’s height and build.
Sherlock joins him.
He is being ridiculous.
“No.”
“Eager, are we?”
“Sto—Stop stalling.”
He shrinks, looking suddenly and impossibly young.
John steps forward, reaches for Sherlock’s belt, and Sherlock nods in assent, feels a race of anticipation and slight anxiety, as John looses it, pulls it free, tosses it on the floor and then undoes the flies of his trousers and pushes them down over his hips.
And John, it may be helpful for you to resume individual sessions outside of what we do here.”
Rosie looks confused.
“You didn’t have to buy us a Grade 2 listed cottage to get me to stay.”
“What’s wrong?”
“It’s not what you think.”
Makes you wonder if there’s a purpose in it all.”
He smoothes a hand over John’s back.
And John feels like running, falling, just—stopping.
Maybe should do what she asks though, yeah?
Sherlock hurries to correct.
“You want to sleep close, or would you rather…?”
If...”
Sherlock shakes his head.
He goes and gets himself seconds and then settles back in.
He stokes the fire in the lounge as well, and then goes to the back door, and eases it open a crack.
Text me at lunch about what you want to do for supper.”
Thought there must have been some gadget, or…”
“Don’t be ridiculous, please, John.”
Mycroft’s gaze flits momentarily to John, and then back again.
“Ahh.”
“Where is it?!”
Afterwards, they lay quiet and sated in one another’s arms, and whisper back and forth in the dark.
The mind may be willing, but the flesh is weak.”
Not when I’m thinking about something important.”
After a moment he leans in close to John’s ear again.
“Won’t tell him you said that.”
John’s face is doing a million things at once, none of which Sherlock can seem to interpret (frustratingly enough).
Why is he doing this to himself?
“I want you.
“Yeah.
“I’ve always loved you, okay.
Nearly fifty and a right wanker, who’s still too embarrassed to buy condoms with his boyfriend, and sometimes he hates himself so much he just wants to…
“Yeah, sorry I…
She nods.
Sherlock nods.
“Yes.”
John sucks in a quick breath, lets it out again, and turns on his heel to look down at Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed.
He smiles.
“No, I just mean, that’s not what people usually say.”
Right now, though…
There’s nothing but the wind outside, and the last, clinging vestiges of something that feels almost like an emotional fog, treacle-thick and cloying, that seems to wrap tight around John’s throat, making it hard to breathe.
“Ready for adventures are you?”
Is he okay?”
The sound of Rosie’s even breathing filling the room with the sort of soft white noise that makes Sherlock want to curl up and go back to sleep.
“Hear me?”
“Doubtful.
And as for what we’re looking for…”
Oh, oh John.
“Right.
“You don’t seem very frightened.”
“Couldn’t do it anymore.”
“Yeah?”
John sits up, settles on Sherlock’s thighs and shrugs out of his shirt, tosses it onto the bed beside him.
The corner of John’s mouth twitches.
“I’ve told you.
He looks down at the phone in his hand.
He’s was a bit of a drama queen, to be honest.
Could use some lunch maybe.”
This is what you do when sex is—nice.
John hands him the peeler and nods toward the bag of potatoes he’s deposited in the sink.
“I could pinch you.”
You don’t need to do this alone, and you don’t have to play this game just because this Moriarty bloke wants you to.”
But John responds in kind, anyway, and before he knows it, they’re both surrounded in a flurry of churning water, and flailing hands.
“Yeah, okay.
“While it lasts.”
Sherlock stares into his tea.
He won’t mind.”
“You’re okay?
There are heavy, dark bags beneath his eyes, wrinkles too.
Hey Sherlock, wake up.”
John hurries and changes, and then steps into the loo to wash his hands and rake a hand through his hair.
“If you don’t want to, we won’t.”
I’m a consulting detective who often encounters the dead or wounded, and who quite frequently has run-ins with dangerous and violent criminals.
He was going to cook a little something for his supper, but now it’s dark he doesn’t seem to have the energy.
Takes a moment to think about it.
It’s useless to me.”
But it’s far too early.”
The next week there had been flowers and take-away delivered, and even some contractors called in to repaper Mrs. Hudson’s lounge—Sherlock doing his penance, of course, but still…
So, I have some questions I’m going to be asking, and I need you to answer them as honestly as you can.
“Okay.”
“It’s on the table.”
Still nothing.
Sorry about that.
It’s—it’s just too good.
Come out.
“Victor.
“Too right.”
“I help you.
Sherlock can hear the lunchtime traffic pick up outside.
If that was too much, or too soon, I…”
“Ms. Thompson said to tell you that she is willing to conduct your session via Skype if you prefer.”
“John, it’s fine.
Your only exposure to touch as a child was what you experienced from your father, and it was violent and abusive.
“When you say, everything…?”
Always the little adult.
He isn’t sure which of them drifts off first, but it doesn’t really matter.
Someone commented on this tonight, and it reminded me that I still owed you all a chapter.  Fortunately, that chapter was almost finished, and I just had to wrap it up tonight, so here you go.  Enjoy.
Sherlock curls the finger already inside him, rubs gently, watches John tense, and surge, and rock, waits until his eyes roll back and he moans obscenely loud into the rose-pink glow of the room, before pressing again with the second finger, and to his surprise, John takes it.
“I don’t have to bring people home.”
Difference is permitted when paired with talent, or genius, but when it is not then you are viewed as nothing but a burden.
“You made me feel rather like I’d just won the national lottery.
“Maybe they did leave the area entirely.”
“Usually.
“I love you,” John whispers back, against his lips, pulls closer.
He will NOT cry in the middle of the bloody M&S!
The village is all abuzz, apparently.”
“It’s natural to feel that way.
“We should at least try and get to the lions.
He is different.
From the beginning.
Sherlock’s hands are braced against the hallway wall, either side of John’s head.
Not sure how I feel about another bloke having his hands all over my pants.”
“Did you mean it?”
He’s still shaking, can't stop shaking.
Nothing like that, it’s just this last hostage…”
“I’s fine.
I decided…”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say.
“They’ve placed bets,” Lestrade explains.
It’s what they do.
You can see every star, constellation, planet, distant galaxies like tiny smudges in a sea of glimmering light.”
“Yes.
“So, I guess in some ways that was all the touch I knew.
“Mm.”
You’re important to me.
You need backup?
He sees the glint of silver on the carpet, amongst the rest of the trinkets, gets down on the pretence of gathering it all up, and then picks up the ring, gets up on one knee, and realises that Sherlock’s already turned away and gone back to gathering up their food.
“You slept like the dead,” Sherlock confirms.
Don’t know what he said.
Look at me.”
Sherlock smiles.
“You already know what I think.”
Sherlock looks down at him, scandalised.
Go in the loo and wash your hands.
Mrs. Hudson is staying with her sister this week.
There is no sign of John.
When John finishes his soup, he sits back in his chair, and looks around them again.
And maybe…”
The cab stops, the back door swings open, and John comes face to face with a brunette holding a gun.
“I mean it.”
He looks down between their bodies just in time to see a small bead of precome drip from the head of Sherlock’s cock onto his stomach.
But still…
Harry sits up, feet clomping to the floor.
grateful, John, but I have no…
“He is pursuing something that’s…
“It?”
The screen shifts into focus, and it takes John’s sleep-fuzzy brain a second to register that he’s looking at Sherlock.
Or rather a dirty mattress on the floor of an abandoned boat house on the banks of the Cam, where they’d both snuck off to shoot up.
John should ask what, he should definitely, absolutely ask what before he roles over and surrenders his arse to whatever Sherlock has in mind, but his curiosity is piqued now, and god help him the mystery only adds to the appeal.
John goes rigid.
“You’re rude and awful, and I love you.”
Christ!”
It was easy.
Just give us a minute.”
He should apologise to John Watson.
He’d often leave his phone unlocked, and open to the last email he had responded to.
My love for Francesca, for Arthur, it seemed an affront to him, and if I would not love him, and give him the life he saw as his, then I suppose he felt that Francesca and Arthur did not deserve that life, or my love either.
I’ll text you the new address.”
The man leans over and fills Sherlock’s glass instead.
He shakes his head.
There’s a black screen, and then white block lettering appears.
He slows his rhythm, slides his hand down to cup his balls, to fondle them a little.
John adds.
“I know.”
“Good,” he finishes lamely.
I like this.
He doesn’t have to wait long to find one.
A flat, a family, a home.
Sherlock leaves the road and crests the nearest hill, surveying their surroundings.
We’ll both be starting out with the same level of knowledge about ourselves and each other.”
“More than.”
Kate thinks my giving it up might be endangering lives, many lives, and she has—
He watches John’s head rise and fall against his chest, borne up on the ebb and flow of his breath.
John’s fingers stir, and he slips his hand over Sherlock’s.
“What?”
John nods and stuffs the noodles into his mouth.
Hey…” when Sherlock’s eyes drop.
Sorry.”
“Good.”
“Those scratches…”
A huge thanks to
“You are,” he repeats.
And then suddenly John is moving, flipping Sherlock onto his back, straddling his hips and grinning down at him.
I doubt it was her fault.”
A few?
Chapter two picks up right after this, and can be found
“Alright.
If not for the fact that he’s just finished a case, and has little need for his brain, he would be berating himself for such adolescent internal negotiations.
John huffs.
“Want you out of all this,” John murmurs against his lips at last.
“Yup.
John drags his fingers slowly through his hair, and Sherlock’s eyes snap up.
What would it feel like?
Even advisable.
What I said just now, that wasn’t on.
When John finally strolls back into the kitchen several minutes later, Sherlock is just ladling the soup into bowls and spreading the toast generously with butter.
When he’s done he makes a pot of coffee, and retreats with a cup to the lounge.
The pleasure is sharp and sudden, and he groans loudly, and then runs his hand through the precome on his hip and belly and wraps his hand around his flagging erection, gives a tentative stroke, and groans again.
And this is Sherlock caught out.
John’s head snaps up at that.
Would he be flattered?
Jesus, Sherlock, you have to stahh…”
“So you’re here at his behest?
Sherlock nods.
We were exchanging facts and stories.”
You teetotal or somethin’?”
“I—I didn’t do anything wrong.”
Was your own bloody fault.”
“Yes.
“So many layers,” Sherlock whispers against his mouth.
“I see you.”
He will want female companionship.
Sherlock traces his fingers down the length of John’s spine.
“Fine.
Together or not at all.
John rubs a hand across his eyes.
John surprises even himself at the declaration.
Reaches out for Sherlock’s hands.
“It’s cold.
He waits.
I’d got all the way to Berlin, and turned back.”
It’s me.
Sherlock looks up at him again, eyes searching and concerned.
Sherlock’s eyes are full.
Will do.
So much, that they can hardly keep track of it.
“Not exactly true.
He waits.
They go down to the reception area, and a desk with a large bank of computers.
“I know.”
He hums while he dresses, and he hums while he cooks breakfast.
John finds himself wishing, for one brief moment, that he had known Sherlock in school.
And now he sleeps again, and he is alive, and if not whole, at least healing, and Sherlock is comforted.
Sherlock spins around and stops dead, looking thoroughly scandalised.
Everything else about John is so extraordinary.
“It’s okay.
What kind of person does that?”
“Seriously, though.
down more times than I can count, but I want to try.”
His lips travel to behind Sherlock’s ear, and his weight shifts just enough for Sherlock to feel the full, thick weight of him, how much he wants this.
They work on the dishes quietly, side-by-side until they’re done.  When the kitchen is tidied and everything put away John turns and heads for the bedroom without a word.  Sherlock isn’t sure if he’s meant to follow, but he does anyway. He shuts out the lights, checks the locks at the doors.  When he returns to the bedroom, John is undressing. Sherlock clears his throat so that John knows he’s there, and then leans against the door jamb and watches appreciatively when John doesn’t acknowledge him.
Before everything, and I need you to know that you still are, that you’ll always be, and I need you to know…”
And when he says nothing, “John you’ve had my cock in your mouth, I’m fairly certain that nothing you say now could surprise me.”
And inside only a small black card with the nursery rhyme in question crawled across it in metallic ink.
He can feel a headache coming on.
Maybe sit on a pillow.
“You feeling sick again?”
John stares down at the menu in his hand, and then up at the ornate ceilings and crystal chandeliers handing above them.
“I agree.
But ten weeks after he had started sharing Sherlock’s bed he had awakened to Sherlock flailing in the dark, crashing to the floor and crawling under the bed.
“Fine.
“I want it.”
Sherlock just shakes his head.
You there?
Wasn’t too keen on how that played out.
“You understand you can’t just stay like this.
“How are the ribs.”
He’s staring straight ahead into the darkness, seemingly hypnotised by the glowing stripes on the road, disappearing beneath their wheels, and John pushes down the surge of adrenaline that races through his veins at the memory of everything that has just transpired.
The words come out of nowhere.
The crease of his thigh is slick, and Sherlock’s cock slides perfectly into place, nerves pricking, arousal pooling, thick and hot.
“Wanted you.
“John.
Sherlock breathes.
John’s blushing so furiously, now, that his head feels light.
“Don’t have
With his sister always fighting, shouts or icy silence.
He winks, and then turns and starts to root through the first of the boxes.
He places a hand tentatively on John’s head, and feels John shudder and then relax.
Sherlock wants very much to kiss him, and it must be evident on his face, because John draws closer, lets Sherlock cup his jaw in the palm of his hand, and draw them close.
“Then?”
“You’re really good with her, you know.”
They both strip, and Sherlock audibly moans when he slips below the surface of the water and into John’s arms.
A weight on his body, hot breath on his cheek, lips on his.
“You tired?”
Well, do make yourself right at home.
“Good-night, Mary.”
He tried to make a dash for it, but—I had a gun.”
John lets himself be swept along.
Mrs. Hudson has hot scones and tea waiting, and when he mentions that John had already made him toast and tea, she tuts and declares he needs protein then, before soft-boiling two eggs, and insisting he eat them.
, John reminds himself.
“Flat’s bound to be a mess after everyone leaves, yeah?”
John’s head hurts.
Don’t blame him for wanting to paint him all the time.”
“Oi!  What the fuck…”  John.  (
Sherlock sounds distracted.
He can hardly see the point.
Push ups until his arms, and shoulders and back burn like…
“Thank you.”
John shakes his head.
But then John is rolling toward him, reaching out for him, and oh…
“I’d like that.”
“Why?”
“Tell me one of your fantasies.”
He shrugs, shakes his head.
I think about you constantly.
Sherlock’s head snaps up, and he looks at him quizzically.
“Christ, I’ve missed you.
“Good.
“Yes, we did.”
And let them know that they’re more than welcome to come to the cottage at any time, and discuss my findings.”
Sherlock (
Why should he when the weight of everything he had lost in the Spring is still pressing down on his shoulders, his chest, his throat, making it feel like he can’t breathe most days, let alone speak.
Sherlock recognises John’s neat block text from all the way across the room.
John huffs against his mouth, and kisses him again.
They sit on a park bench in silence, and watch a flock of ducks paddle across its glassy surface.
“John.”
He smiles crookedly.
“On your part, yes.
“I love you,” he whispers and gets no response save another louder snore.
“Yes.”
“We’ve talked about this before.  I understand, John.”
“Last night…”
“It’s fine.
“Yes.”
“Yeah.
“Marry me when we get home.
Sherlock’s stomach twists.
“Yes, yes.
He’s made John smile more in the last few days than he had in the last few years.
“I’m not allowed to care about my own brother now?”
“It’s to do with the surprise.”
John sits up.
“Thing I’ve—thought about.
He tucks his knees up under his chin, trying to ignore how stiff and sore he is, and pushes down the almost unbearable craving for a cigarette.
Sherlock swallows and blinks.
“Alright.”
He’s grateful for the cab.
It seems insurmountable.
Might make for an awkward situation some day.”
“Good-morning.
Sherlock’s fingers are rubbing against John’s scalp now, sometimes stroking, sometimes fluttering, sometimes simply sitting, warm and heavy against the crown of his head, while Sherlock murmurs ear to ear.
“Not going to be able to do any of that for awhile, not with your ribs the way they are.”
People don’t do that.
Not really.
Please note the new tag mentioned below.  This is a nsfw chapter.
Like the time he’d nicked a vein in uni, and bled all over Victor the first time they’d shared a bed.
complex ptsd, abuse mention,
“Yes, yes, if we’re all done chatting, then…”
Dr. Carlton is an ageing academic, a colleague of his mothers.
John initiating has made it easier.
“That first year.
This is an old one, that someone just reblogged on tumblr.  I'd forgotten all about it, so I thought I'd add it here.
Sherlock just stares.
It’s tempting to feel as though it’s his fault.
“An excellent start.”
“Jealousy.”
I don’t know.
His hands are shaking now, too.
“Jesus.
behind.
Sherlock shivers.
John chuckles.
Sherlock stares down at his hands, which he’s folded primly in his lap.
John’s shoulders drop.
He’s had to be sure he doesn’t seem too eager, doesn’t pressure him, doesn’t give him a reason to leave again.
