“Cas, let go of me!” the alpha ordered, an urgent tone to his voice as he tried to fight against his magic to break free. In vain, of course. Castiel had the supermoon’s power behind him, after all.
Anna took one look at him and the blanket in his arms, and yelled over her shoulder, “Cuddle pile!” before pulling him into a hug.
Castiel couldn’t believe that his little white lie about some work colleague’s jibe had actually worked. Yes, there were mated pairs that bit
Just then Dean arrived. He had to have come straight here to be so early.
“What’s with the strange signs?” Dean asked, indicating the walls Castiel had spent hours drawing sigils on.
Dean still saw the lights on at Jimmy’s place whenever he himself happened to be up at night. He would have assumed that with Dean regularly chasing Jimmy around the gym, he’d be too exhausted to be up at all hours of the night, but apparently not.
“Oh, really?” Zachariah asked, pausing in his speech about how he couldn’t offer the position to Castiel. His sarcastically raised eyebrow was just the last straw. As if it was so outlandish to think an alpha might want to mate him!
Cas would have loved nothing more than to take Dean up on the implicit offer to scent him—but then Dean would have scented back and it was about time to apply the alpha scent again. It wasn’t like his real scent should be scentable again, but the alpha scent should be reapplied regularly just in case. It would no doubt arouse suspicion if his scent lost some of its earthy alphaness.
breakfast. Finally, he could show off his own breakfast-making skills.
With no audience around.
He really shouldn’t ask Dean, who was already doing so much for him, to give up that part as well.
And he was perfectly fine with that.
Dream touching, however? Was completely legitimate. After all, you couldn’t be held accountable for what happened inside your dreams.
The couch was a bit small for three people, but Castiel couldn’t very well crowd Sam, so he only scooted over a tiny bit, staying within scenting range of Dean.
—did things to Dean’s alpha. Things that were slightly confusing and mixed in with a sudden, strong desire to scent mark that omega until he smelled taken.
hot tub. If anything,
All he managed to say was, “Dean—I’m…” before everything tightened and then released in a rush.
Okay, now,
Dean: That is awesome, Cas! Congrats!
Keeping his eyes closed coincidentally also kept Dean from seeing how the moonlight was affecting him. His eyes tended to glow a bright blue when they were absorbing a supermoon’s power, and despite what Dean had said, he wasn’t sure if the hunter would appreciate seeing him like this.
A beeping sound interrupted their cuddle time. Dean quickly disentangled himself from Cas so that he could get the smartwatch to shut the fuck up.
his omega to be mated by Impala right now!
“You know you mean a lot to me, right?”
Dean seemed aware of that fact, though—he was careful and soft with him as he leaned in and nosed along his neck. Of course, he was much more elegant than Castiel and found the scent gland on the first try.
When there was a knock on his door a couple of days later, his mood picked up immediately and he rushed to the door…
If praising his cuddle technique made Cas smell like that, Dean would make sure to tell him how good it felt as often as possible.
intimacy, but rather a means to an end. It became impossible not to enjoy what Dean was doing, though, when he began using his teeth in between broad licks of the tongue.
“Want to go out tonight?” Benny asked. “I could be your wingman.”
Until Cas ruined it by checking the watch.
Cas let go of him so that he could look at him, trying to figure out what his problem was. “Do you not want to scent tonight?”
“What went
It started off simple enough, with Dean’s arms around Cas’ shoulders, his chin resting on Cas’ head in a sort of lying hug while Cas was snuggling up against his side, their legs intermingling. Simple, but hella comfortable. Cuddlibi really knew what they were doing. In some of the cuddle positions, Cas would wrap himself around Dean until he couldn’t really tell where Cas started and he began.
As for the bedroom—it looked just as homey as the rest of the place, and the bed in the middle was huge and sturdy. It had to be if an alpha and an omega wanted to spend an omega’s heat in there together. And—were those
! Although Cas also felt a bit like a creep for enjoying it so much when Dean didn’t even know he was doing it.
Their eyes met and Dean’s dick, which had lost some of its hardness, came back alive. He should probably feel embarrassed to be caught with his dick far up some omega’s ass, but the few beers helped him not to care too much about being watched in the middle of sex. As a matter of fact, the few beers suddenly didn’t seem a problem anymore performance-wise.
“Are you using a new cologne?” he asked and—fuck!—scooted closer to take a whiff right from his scent gland.
Cas was still looking at him, head tilted. “But shouldn’t you find someone whose scent doesn’t bother you?” he finally asked.
Dean hadn’t meant to kiss Cas. It had just happened because he had been sleepy and Cas had been about to freak out and it had seemed like a good way of saying “I gotcha.”
alphas did.
possible for an alpha to form a mating bond with a beta. Or even with another alpha.”
you?”
“God, you too,” Dean answered, still in character, as he leaned down to kiss him again. “So much.”
He wondered if Dean was being all cuddly with the omega. If he was knotting him—or her. Maybe he preferred female omegas. Were they lying in bed right now, and Dean was holding the omega the way he had held Castiel? Probably. Dean was a very affectionate alpha, after all.
Of course, the other alphas still had no idea what had transpired the day before, or that Cas was an omega for that matter. Obviously, Dean wouldn’t want to appear alphasexual, so Cas would have to make sure he didn’t make heart eyes at Dean and give them away.
“Why are you smiling? Didn’t you hear me tell you that I’m mated to the biggest assbutt in the universe?”
He only got a soft snore as an answer.
At least, the more they got into a routine, the more relaxed Cas became during their cuddle sessions. Of course, it might have something to do with the fact that their physical contact wasn’t having any adverse effects on Dean (as he had been telling him from the beginning).
Looking back over at Dean, he realized with a sinking feeling that their journey together had come to an end. Of course, he was glad that the evil witch had been taken care of and couldn’t hurt anyone else. But with their mission completed—no curse to lift, no witch to find and neutralize—there was really nothing keeping a hunter and a witch working together anymore.
“That’s convenient,” Sam said. “Does this anonymous tipster have any proof?”
After what Jimmy had been through, Dean tried to show him how good being with an alpha could feel. All of his instincts were screaming at him to be gentle with this omega, so he slowly licked into his mouth as he softly caressed his belly, getting Jimmy to squirm and push up into his touch.
Just that. One word, no scent to go along with it. No way to figure out its meaning.
Waking up in a bed next to Jimmy was new. As comfortable as the couch was, it was nothing compared to all the room they had in bed. Not that they were currently making use of it since Dean was lying half on top of Jimmy.
Cas was halfway out the window when he realized that in his haste to get away, he had completely forgotten to take his wallet. He tried to climb back inside to get it, but slipped and fell down into the bushes.
“You’re welcome.”
. He ended up knotting his fleshlight so hard he actually broke it.
Dean had tried flirting with Bees before, but he usually didn’t get much back. He’d be lucky to get an ‘I don’t understand that reference.’ Mostly, Bees didn’t even notice that there
Dean rolled his eyes. “Don’t be ridiculous! We’re just scent-bond partners, it’s not like we’re courting or anything.”
He tried glaring at Dean for good measure, but the position he was in didn’t really lend itself to intimidation tactics. Maybe he should bare his teeth in the universal sign of ‘back off!’
—and often—but it always ended with Dean’s cock and knot shoved up his ass, while they were making out, both of them satisfied.
Cas was a complete mess. Squirming on his knot, his hole stretched around it, his neck peppered with hickeys and bite marks… Dean kind of liked him like that. Boy, was he glad that he had gone for the ‘full package’! He couldn’t
It was obvious that Dean wasn’t used to losing a fight. He grumbled and tried to twist free, and finally, when Castiel wasn’t letting him up, said, “You cheated.”
Back in heaven, Castiel did as promised and put Dean’s file away to concentrate on his other charges. After all, he had a lot of humans to help find love. One human certainly wouldn’t deter him from doing his job.
Without any idea of what his omega’s problem was, Cas usually just scooted closer to Dean whenever such a yearning arose, and then Dean would put an arm around him and Cas’ omega would quiet down for the time being.
The memory of Cas’ scent gland brushing against his own had helped him through his rut, making for some powerful orgasms.
That omega sure wouldn’t be able to service another alpha for a few days by the time Dean was done with him.
“Oh! Ah!”
He was panting by the time he was done with Cas, but he felt his rut hormones abate some.
. So of course, this light touch was way more exciting than anything else an omega could do to him.
“Oh. Well, that. Yeah.”
It had taken a while, but he was finally completely comfortable asking Dean for what he wanted when they were being intimate.
And that’s all the warning Castiel got before Dean pulled him in, flush against his side, ignoring the way Castiel flailed and tried to support himself by grabbing onto Dean’s biceps. The next thing he knew, his nose was pressed up against Dean’s neck.
Leaning over, he poked Cas in the center of his chest. Yup, he could still touch him, even though they were inside of his dream. Although touching him might not help the way Cas imagined it would.
Castiel lost the second round. For a moment there, he had forgotten all about the bet because Dean had made him feel
Dean looked as if he wanted to say something, but then he shook his head and instead took a couple of steps towards him, tipped his head upwards a bit and… was that human trying to
Somewhere along the line, they migrated to the kitchen for a snack (for Dean—Cas mumbled something about molecules), and suddenly, Dean realized that they’d been talking for a couple of hours and he’d actually had a lot of fun. Maybe losing out on that opportunity to have sex with some random omega hadn’t been the worst thing. Getting to spend time with a real-life angel, who was actually turning out to be really easy to talk to, was a lot more interesting anyway.
Dean, always the suave alpha (well, usually, as long as Cas wasn’t concerned), fumbled around a bit until he could slip his fingers under Cas’ pajama shirt so he could stroke his warm, smooth skin.
“No, I’m telling you. He conveniently bumped into me and then at home I realized the pack of gum I had in my pocket was missing.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said as he got up to get dressed again. That wasn’t really all that easy with his wings in the way, so he finally tucked them back into the ethereal plane, which worked just fine now that Dean had groomed them and they had apparently gotten what they had craved.
“Actually, it’s easier for me to feed on you,” Cas replied and proceeded to do just that, snuggling against him more tightly.
As it turned out, he didn’t have to worry, seeing as no one was around to observe them anyway since the party had migrated to the living room at that point. Staying in character even when the others weren’t around was a genius move on Dean’s part. After all, they never knew when someone might walk in on them.
There was pause on the other end of the line.
“I wouldn’t want to make you uncomfortable…” Cas said.
And if they really should run out of omega slick, he had some normal lube they could use.
“Have you claimed him yet?” Sam asked.
Jimmy seemed to hesitate, so Dean continued, “Why not leave it off just for the night? We could engage in a little bit of scent play.” He softly stroked across Jimmy’s scent gland as he said that, delighted at the way Jimmy closed his eyes and seemed to just melt against him.
She was a fallen angel.
The alpha didn’t wake up and just kept squirming around.
with Cas. Was that even possible without claiming each other? His treacherous mind reminded him that he had kind of scent-marked Cas… a lot… and that last time, Cas had returned the favor.
Castiel didn’t really listen to him negotiate some sort of bizarre settlement deal on his behalf. He was busy freaking out about how to tell Dean that apparently, they weren’t faking or pretending anymore.
Again, that familiar yearning inside of him rose and Cas pressed himself against Dean, silently asking for that hand on the small of his back, which would safely secure Cas in their embrace, soothing his omega.
For one, it supposedly talked about how pregnant omegas were supposed to stay active and take regular walks, which was why from then on, instead of just staying inside and scenting the whole time, they started their evenings off by taking a stroll through nature together.
Only when Zachariah finally started talking, he was going on about how he had really wanted to entrust him with this job, but as an alpha, Michael was just the better candidate for it.
should pay for.
He left Jimmy’s scent gland alone to look at the
“Yeah, after you taunted my alpha.”
Cas barely managed to say, “Hello, Dean,” the alpha pulled him close and started scenting frantically, like he was starving for Cas’ scent.
. And of course, they were harmless and couldn’t hurt humans—otherwise they would be on the list of dangerous species, right there alongside werewolves, djinn and ghouls.
“Uhm… Dean. Winchester,” Dean remembered to introduce himself as he held out his hand.
really was unexpected news. Why wouldn’t he have told him that they had managed to break the curse? Castiel himself had had a really good reason to keep it to himself, of course. But there was no logical explanation for why
In the end, it looked like Dean had been cocky for a reason. After multiple failed attempts, he finally managed to pin Castiel to the floor once more, a smug expression on his face that told him the alpha was already sure he had won the fight.
He hated how his voice was trembling by the end of it, betraying his bravado. Luckily, his real scent was covered by the alpha scent, concealing the scent of terrified omega. He raised his chin, hoping that it would convey confidence and ‘I’m fine’ and all those things that would tell Dean he didn’t need to worry, things were taken care of.
Somehow, they had made it to Dean’s bedroom, and while Castiel got rid of the rest of his clothes, the alpha grabbed a condom from the dresser by the side of his bed and rolled it on. He was obviously well prepared.
But even that couldn’t save them anymore.
Too exhausted for words, he licked Dean’s neck to tell him what an amazing job he had done. Dean licked him right back.
Castiel didn’t have time to protest, his niece and nephew already came running in, basically throwing themselves on him. His brother-in-law joined them shortly after and they all held onto each other in a big family group hug.
The alpha grunted, his hands firmly grasping Castiel’s hips and his thrusts shaking the whole bed.
account. And if someone is trying to attack you, I’d hope you wouldn’t be too polite to bare your teeth at them, either.”
Cas had had to lie to Dean,
“Wanna pick up where we left off before the douchebags interrupted us?” Dean asked, a hopeful tone to his voice, which Cas picked up on even though he tried to sound casual. But Cas knew all of Dean’s tells by now.
Never one to pass up a chance to make things even more awkward, Cas stated, “You were pleasuring yourself.” His eyes were fixed on where Dean had his hand balled in the bedspread as if he was trying to see through it.
of all people.
There was that barely-a-touch to his neck again, and this time, Castiel let Dean’s firm hand guide him into the correct position.
“That’s okay. The bed is big enough.”
Dean snorted. “You sound like you expect me to complain about that.”
To exactly no one’s surprise, Dean was alive, awake and full of energy the next morning. He couldn’t wait to show Cas.
They might have to go back to that lake they had passed on their way…
Instincts kicked in and he immediately started kicking and boxing the alpha before his mind had processed what his nose was smelling: Dean.
Once he was alone, he sent Cas a quick text.
It shouldn’t surprise him that Dean had sent him into heat with his constant touching, and scenting, and now even
The moment he laid eyes on that naked ass, firm globes round and smackable, he knew this had been an awesome idea. Sure, the fact that he was about to have sex with an alpha even though he was as straight as they came was a bit strange. He might even end up in an alpha fight with Cas because two alphas together in a bed without a fight for dominance seemed unlikely, but he could totally get behind some naked roughhousing with Cas.
Never once had he been this curious about another person’s scent. Then again, as long as he’d had his sense of smell, there had been no reason to be curious about it.
What he hadn’t expected was for Cas to pull back the covers, pull his pants and boxers down, and
” He still didn’t have words for everything that he was feeling, so he apologized, “I am still figuring out all of these human emotions.” There were a
He tried to control his breathing and shake off the lasting feelings from the nightmare in which Dean hadn’t been there when their pup had needed his scent.
“Great!” Sam said and started closing books and gathering up his papers. “I should go. Eileen should be back by now. And you two should probably get started on that fake mating bite.”
That was the truth, after all, but he omitted just enough so that he wouldn’t get Dean into trouble. Mentioning that he had been in contact with a hunter didn’t seem pertinent anyway. Apart from the fact that the bunker might have played a role in dampening any attempts at contacting him telepathically. But that might also have been due to his low power levels, so not worth mentioning, either.
It didn’t help that Gabe was leaning against the doorframe to Castiel’s room, merely watching while Castiel was busy unpacking.
He alternated between kissing the omega and scenting him, moving away from the scent gland to scent him all over just because he couldn’t get enough.
With all the adrenaline still rushing through his body, Cas found he didn’t even care about what Dean’s keen nose was up to now. He was at the end of his rope.
“Yeah, we might want to close the drapes.” Dean didn’t seem too bothered, but just went about his usual routine, getting ready to take a shower.
At least he had the decency to only scent the air around him. Still, it left Castiel strangely befuddled. What did you say to a human alpha who just audaciously tried to get a whiff of your scent?
At this point, Dean had become a pro at cuddling. All those cuddle positions Cas had taught him? He knew them all, and could effortlessly switch from one to another mid-cuddle.
He stopped staring and quickly put on his pajama shirt so that he could join Cas in bed.
“Yeah, so. Anyway,” Dean said, “I want a rematch. This was obviously too close, it’s hardly conclusive.”
The scenting and teasing and fondling felt so intimate that Cas’ omega desperately wanted to submit to his mate.
Yes, Dean could admit that he had maybe developed a little crush on his gaming buddy. Sue him. Nerdy omega who gave as good as he got? Sign him up!
Dean was too tense to relax. His knot was squished uncomfortably in his jeans, and he had no idea if Cas could scent his post-orgasmic hormones.
He hoped the suggestion had sounded casual and not like Dean needed Cas to say yes with every fiber of his being.
Then Dean said, “Oh hey, I’ll see you later, right? Looking forward to it,” with such a big, honest smile that there was really nothing Cas could say but, “Yes, me too.”
Since Castiel didn’t want Dean to report back to Sam that he had been uncooperative, he got up with a sigh to join Dean on the couch.
Dean had stopped moving too and Cas could just tell he was about to retreat. That wasn’t what he wanted at all.
Dean was kissing him in the most intimate of places, slowly dragging his tongue around his asshole before dipping it into it.
Instead of pushing, Anna just said, voice soft and quiet, “It wasn’t your fault, you know.”
Over the next few days, Dean kept suggesting new things he claimed to have read in his book.
By the time he realized that he couldn’t suppress his alpha any longer, it was obviously too late to go out and pick someone up. Unfortunately, he didn’t know anyone he could call, either. He had never exchanged numbers with any of his rut flings. That left him with only one option.
When the omega he’d been flirting with from afar came over, Dean knew he was in for a night of fun.
Cas’ scent was about to turn distressed again, so Dean leaned in close, making sure Cas got a whiff of his scent, which always managed to calm him down.
Cas had decided to enjoy the feeling of being in love. The jittery feeling in his belly whenever Dean was smiling at him actually felt rather nice. So did the flutter of electricity running through his body at every touch.
pup. He should be kept in the loop here! His omega was pregnant with his pup and Dean was sitting here on his ass and could do absolutely nothing. He was completely useless.
“You don’t know that,” Cas said, sad tilt to his mouth.
Once there was nothing left to prepare, they played some board games they had found in one of the cabinets, and Cas got all excited when he found a game of Twister. Of course, Dean gave in—there was no way he could say no to Cas’ big, hopeful eyes—and it actually turned out to be a lot of fun.
The reaction came in form of a punch in the arm, but there was no force behind it, so that it was barely more than a soft touch.
Cas rolled his eyes again—he did that a lot when talking with Gabe. “Thanks.”
As it turned out, Dean had some baggage of his own, as he found out when the conversation turned to family.
Yes, Cas had done that once before, but usually, it was Dean playing with the omega’s mating gland, not the other way around, which was why he had started questioning whether Cas even wanted to go down that road with him. After all, when they had spent Cas’ heat together, he hadn’t wanted Dean to bite his mating gland. Granted, they had just gotten together then, but still.
He was pregnant, so he was absolutely allowed to curl up on the couch with a tub of ice cream and scent Dean’s shirt that had ‘accidentally’ ended up in his suitcase.
of him was amazing! He’d make sure that everyone would know just who this omega’s mate was. Well, fake mate, but no one needed to know that part.
When he arrived at the alpha’s house, he just saw alpha red eyes indicative of rut sickness, and he barely had time to introduce himself before Dean had him bent over the couch, pants around his ankles and an impressive dick shoved up his ass.
Oh. Yes, Castiel assumed that might sound weird to a human. Like somehow, Castiel had been spying on him having sex—even though, of course, Dean had been having sex with
“I’m not leaving,” he said, just in case his hug hadn’t been enough of an answer. “Just… give me some time to process all of this.”
“Oh.” He had forgotten for a second there. Cas’ neck looked so ready for another bite, he had simply wanted to give it a little nibble. “Not if I bite
Dean couldn’t help but laugh, which in return got Cas to blink up at him, all innocent cuddlibus. “What?”
That’s when he realized: he was submitting to that hot, naked alpha above him, and baring his neck to end the fight was only the beginning. Just that thought sent a pleasurable shiver down his spine.
Oh, yes. And he said stuff like that, in his usual deadpan, wondering why Dean would splutter and reprimand him, “You don’t
That’s why he broke his promise to himself to keep away from earth and flew back down, making sure that he was invisible to the human eye and that he stuck the landing this time around. He’d had a lot of practice lately.
Maybe Castiel should tease Dean more often into taking charge like this if this sense of safety and security Dean provided was the result. One hand was pushing him against the (surprisingly soft) pillow, the other was still holding on to his hip while Dean was nosing along his sensitive skin, the crook of his neck, down to his Adam’s apple and back up to the scent gland on the other side of his neck.
“I’m just sayin’, you show up there with some painted-on claim on your neck, people will figure it out,” Dean explained. “I think the best plan here is the simplest: you show up with a
He swallowed with an audible click and that’s when the scent hit his nostrils. It was Dean’s usual scent, which he had smelled plenty of times second-hand and the one time in person, but it was amplified due to his rut and tinged with alpha arousal and raw, primal lust.
Naturally, he did end up with a load of Dean’s spunk in his ass, but that couldn’t have been the alpha’s only reason to visit him since he stayed the night.
Scenting time had long since become cuddling time, interspersed with some light petting (and maybe a bit of heavy petting). In any case, Cas had been on board and had even initiated some things between them. Those signals he’d been sending Dean were part of why he’d decided to ask Cas for something more permanent to begin with.
So Dean clicked his way through the different options, fondling the omega’s pup bump, spooning him, massaging his shoulders, kissing his forehead, neck, cheek and finally, when he had gone through most of the options, his mouth. When asked if he wanted to use tongue, he thought what the hell and just went for it, Frenching Bees.
Of course, Castiel had only shown Dean part of what grooming was all about. Maybe that’s why he had felt the need to come back for another grooming session so soon. The last one had been cut short.
He was done with this topic. They never agreed on what had happened anyway.
“So…” Dean said, looking around the room. “This looks nice.”
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath before he finally uttered the words he’d wanted to say for so long, “I’m not an alpha.”
“No, I mean later.”
Almost as an afterthought, Dean let go of Cas’ dick and wiped his hand off on his ass cheek.
He didn’t always use the clothes as a masturbatory aid, though. Sometimes, he liked to scent them before falling asleep. In those cases, he’d have nice dreams about the alpha and sleep through the night. Sometimes, he even liked to put them on. Being surrounded by the alpha’s scent made him feel safe and cozy.
She opened the alpha request that the omega had filled out.
a reference to understand. Somehow, that made him even more endearing.
A myriad of voices was the first thing Castiel perceived even before the huge hall started taking shape around him.
They had woken up together as usual, and Cas was snacking on Dean cuddling him (he seemed to like some cuddles for breakfast just fine). There was some kissing because Cas said those tasted the best, and… well, Little Dean got the wrong impression there. Too much stroking, too much friction… or maybe not enough.
The omega bartender, who had chosen this moment to stop by, looked Dean up and down with an interested glint in his eyes.
Dean ducked down to kiss Cas just as his knot caught and that was it. Cas came all over himself, his asshole fluttering uncontrollably around Dean’s cock, which began spurting his thick jism into him almost immediately.
“Wanna give it a try?” Dean asked, opening his arms as an invitation for a quick cuddle.
Of course, he was very aware of Sam’s presence when baring his throat, making for an awkward moment where he almost got a crick in his neck.
I wanted to write some fluff, but somehow here is where the chapter ended. I’m a bit nervous about your reaction. I hope you like the chapter anyway. And you know I’ll make it all better soon. ❤️
“Okay, that’s it! We’re done talking about this!” He used his no-nonsense voice to put an end to this discussion. Although in retrospect, he should have known that the angel would just ignore it.
Cas shook his head, unable to suppress a smile. He could read between the lines. That was clearly Gabe’s way of telling him to go for it. “You’re ridiculous,” he stated nevertheless.
Nothing, apparently. It had been a stupid omega instinct. Dean probably wouldn’t have been able to scent anything over the fake alpha scent even if he hadn’t declined the offer (which he would have), but Cas shouldn’t tempt fate like that in the first place.
A lot, he had to admit when he found out the hard way why, after not having spent a single rut alone in twenty years, you shouldn’t just go cold turkey. Rut sickness was a bitch! His alpha was going a bit insane with the need to fuck an omega, and jerking off didn’t do him any good, no matter how often he wrung an orgasm out of his dick.
Dean rolled his eyes. He had no idea what the letters stood for—‘A’ was for ‘Alpha,’ but that was about all he remembered.
Apparently, Benny agreed as he said, “We have to work together to take her down.”
The omega didn’t start scenting, though, but just lay there unresponsive, still shivering even with the blanket wrapped tightly around him.
“Mister Novak?” someone yelled, still banging on the door.
“You okay?” Dean asked and brought him out of his fantasies of a week in which he could pretend Dean was his mate.
you… And you’re only telling me
This was the reason Castiel did not come on to alphas. He read signs all wrong, even when he
That cat was out of the bag thanks to Hannah. Dean could go and be with any omega he wanted to, now that he knew the curse had been lifted.
It wasn’t that Cas had wanted to snoop—the book had just been right there (underneath a bunch of car magazines). ‘How to Take Care of Your Pregnant Mate.’
“Oh, come on! I already came inside you. Believe me—my dick is satiated and doesn’t have anything to say right now.”
This human was even more stubborn than anticipated. “You would prefer to find your perfect match yourself? Among millions of eligible omegas?” That was ridiculous. There was a reason angels were responsible for that task. Humans, if left to their own devices, tended to choose the wrong mate. Broken marriages and mating bonds were the result, and in the end, the alphas and omegas who had once loved each other would grow to resent each other.
Dean got halfway through “Reduces cramps” before Cas cut him off with a kiss.
Dean’s alpha didn’t appreciate the mocking. “Come on, this isn’t funny. My alpha is trying to show you how tough he is. You making fun of him isn’t really helping to settle my protective instincts here.”
Why was Dean wearing a shirt in their nest anyway? That didn’t make a lot of sense, so Cas helped him get rid of it.
Next step: Making Cas want more.
him! Not for real, of course, but it sure
They were lying on their sides, facing each other, no space left between their upper bodies—luckily some space left between them underneath the blankets. (Yes, there were blankets. Cas had been a bit chilly. And Dean had to admit that it really was quite comfortable lying next to Cas, wrapped in blankets—warm and cozy.)
Sam had warned Castiel not to expect any miracles too soon, and he had been right. His answer to all the questions was ‘No.’ No, he couldn’t tell what Dean was feeling by scenting him, no, he didn’t smell any components of his scent.
Perfect. Now he had complete access. He made sure to use gentle, slow strokes and caresses as the book had suggested.
Well… yes. That’s what scenting buddies
Dean furrowed his brows in reaction. He might be on to Castiel.
“I quite enjoy your penis inside my asshole.”
When they were scenting and Dean put his arm around him, he felt safe and cared for and he never wanted to leave the scent-embrace.
, but it had been fun last time, so why not? So, Dean pulled out, manhandled Cas onto his belly and pushed back into his hole from behind so that he could fuck into his undoubtedly sore ass a couple more times before knotting him.
Finally. This felt like coming home.
The alpha was already naked, and he was definitely fit. Well-defined muscles made Castiel want to step closer and let his arms wander over his chest.
He hadn’t thought he’d get lucky enough to get his hands on that belly again. These last few days, he’d had to fight his alpha instincts to keep himself from giving that omega a good belly rub. Now, he was finally allowed to.
Taking in the sleeping alpha as he tightened his hold on him in his sleep, Cas felt a rush of affection wash through him. ‘For life’ sounded nice. He wanted to have this for himself so much, he physically ached for it.
That… was a lot of information to take in all at once. Hearing that Cas needed him was nice, but…
“I can explain…” he started because Dean looked dumbfounded and he deserved an explanation even though Cas had no idea what exactly to say.
“You know, by human standards,” Dean quickly clarified.
“They have special challenges that can get us all kinds of awesome rewards,” Impala reminded him. “I heard something about unlocking new features if we finish some kind of hidden quest. We gotta play on Saturday, man!”
Decision made, Dean said, “You know what, we usually give out our cell phone numbers if an omega wants to request the same alpha again. Leaves the phone lines at MEAT open for new clients.”
“I wouldn’t know. I couldn’t smell it. To you, it was very obvious that I wanted it, but me, I thought maybe you were mad because I crossed a line…”
Instead, he turned Cas around onto his belly, placed a kiss on his shoulder blade and kneaded his ass cheeks before pulling them apart, exposing his pink little hole.
It was during one of their non-feeding cuddle sessions on the couch during a commercial break that Cas said, out of nowhere, “I’ll tell you a secret if you tell me one.”
“Oh, God yeah!” Dean said, sliding in and out of Castiel’s throat, occasionally panting, “Cas!” when he slid in especially deep.
When Cas had finally managed to take Dean to the ground in one of their play fights, Dean seemed genuinely impressed, which in turn made Cas feel proud and on top of the world.
for Dean!
“What if I had not been able to heal you? Humans are only supposed to enter heaven when their time on earth has come to an end. You time wasn’t up.”
Okay, so maybe that crush had never quite gone away. It wasn’t Castiel’s fault that Dean was the most caring, loving alpha he had ever met. If anything,
have sex with him… Keeping the timelines straight with visions was confusing, even for a witch.
compliment.”
“No, you know what? It’s good,” Dean concluded. “’Cause now I know what I want, so I can go find an omega to fall in love with and start a family.”
Dean, oblivious to the fact that his licks were sending Cas to heaven, just kept going. Dean’s thumb lightly stroked the short hairs at the nape of his neck and it was almost too much tenderness for Cas to bear.
That’s when it all clicked into place. Mike wasn’t coming. He was already
Now that he knew what to scent for, he could pick up on it, under layers of this stupid alpha scent.
“Well then, thank you for returning it, I suppose.”
Lying in bed, his back to Dean, he wished he hadn’t reacted that way. He felt cold where he could be held by Dean’s strong arms instead like the night before.
Castiel whimpered around Dean’s tongue because… this was
Suddenly, Dean stopped, his nose twitching once, twice—and that’s when Cas realized what it was he was picking up on.
Dean was such a good kisser that kissing him had an addictive quality.
This was an alpha who hadn’t been able to come inside of an omega’s ass in long enough that he just wanted to
There was no way he would give Cas up that easily, so there was really only one thing for Dean to do.
Had Cas ever even rubbed one out? The sounds he made sure seemed to suggest he had never felt anything like Dean’s hand on his dick and cock in his ass.
Cas quickly scooted away from Dean a bit so that Gabe wouldn’t get the wrong impression (which he probably already had).
“There aren’t any rules against licking.”
Dean, who was sitting next to Cas, nudged him in the ribs, and Cas laughed with him—not because he had figured out what the joke was, but because Dean’s laughter was rather infectious.
That’s when Castiel realized: the tingling hadn’t just been
Today was a cuddle day and since it was already evening, it wouldn’t be long until he had Cas back in his bed… uhm, arms, which put Dean in a good mood.
“I wouldn’t know. You’re the one who pulled out.”
Why did Dean have to be so sweet and caring?! Alphas weren’t supposed to be like that! This was dangerous territory. His omega was actually starting to feel taken care of. More than that, he felt safe and protected in Dean’s presence. He should not have let himself fall asleep at Dean’s place.
“Sorry, I’m… sorry.” He almost cricked his neck in his hurry to whip his head back into an appropriate position. It was just that scenting was usually a reciprocal activity, that was all. He hadn’t thought about what he was doing…
Their pup wasn’t the only one who had gotten used to their regular scentings. Dean had totally scent bonded with Cas, too, and his alpha had missed this so bad that Dean just wanted to keep standing here, taking Cas’ scent in forever.
But he wanted Dean to want it as much as he did. Not as a way to be prepared for his possible relocation. Certainly not if it meant putting Dean in danger.
“Oh.”
He tried to get a hand on his own cock, which was in desperate need of relief, but the alpha had really found his rhythm now and Castiel had to hang on, clinging to the pillows for support as the alpha penetrated him again and again.
He was still sitting on the bed when Castiel was fully dressed. Now it was his turn to figure out how inter-species grooming worked. Sitting down next to Dean, he decided to just try his best. Without waiting for instructions, he simply reached out and let his fingers run through Dean’s hair in an attempt to smooth it. He couldn’t possibly go through it one hair at a time, could he? Did he have to look for broken ones?
“But I was asleep, too,” Cas hastened to explain. “I didn’t mean to fall asleep, but when I woke up, we were all cuddled up with each other…” Yeah, Dean so wasn’t gonna comment on that part. “And I… I might have fed on you subconsciously…”
nearby, as in right underneath him), a rival who might challenge him for an omega.
Sam asked when he picked up.
“There is nothing to deal with. He’s a friend who thinks this kind of prank is funny. I’ll just give him a quick call.” Only his cell was back at the bunker. Which was probably the reason Dean hadn’t tried calling him. “Does anyone have a cell phone I could borrow?”
It didn’t take long until Dean filled him up thoroughly, pumping his hot seed deep into his womb. At that point, the alpha was basically the one holding Cas in presenting position because he really couldn’t keep his ass up by himself.
. Consider this your human lesson for the day. Now—do you
With those words and a last stern look at both Dean and Cas, the police officer walked away, leaving Cas alone with Dean for the first time since they had woken up scenting each other.
“Still nothing,” Cas’ voice entered his foggy brain.
Also not on their list, and something Dean was thinking more and more about: kissing. Maybe Dean should have suggested it, but he had chickened out. He really didn’t want Cas to turn him down. Better to not ask at all than ask and be denied.
Maybe he could use a friend while he was stuck here after all. He’d just have to make sure not to fall for that pretty face. Luckily, Dean was safe. After all, he was into omegas and thought that Cas was an alpha.
“Should I inspect your penis to look for traces of the curse?” Castiel offered because lately, they had only ever had sex, but he had made no other attempt to help break the curse. And while all the sex had been great, he wanted Dean to sleep with him because he
They were quite the pair—plenty of abandonment issues to go around between the two of them. But together, they’d work through it. They just had to show each other that they’d stick around.
Dean looked over at Castiel with a strange expression on his face, probably trying to figure out if he had known.
Maybe he hadn’t gotten a good scent off of Anna. An omega’s scent was important for an alpha to fall in love.
It wasn’t like they hadn’t done their fair share of scenting over the years—as roommates did. They were, after all, extremely scent-compatible. It would have been weird if they
“That’s okay. He’s a vegetarian. Just give him some seeds.”
“Heeeeeeell-oh!” he interrupted himself when his eyes took in the scene he had walked in on.
As soon as Dean had parked the car in front of Cas’ house, the omega got out with a terse, “Thank you for driving me.”
“I can see if we can get a quick order in,” Gabe said. “If you could just leave your contact information, I’ll get back to you ASAP.”
It might be hard (pun intended), but at least Cas wouldn’t get it on with any alphas either, which was a reassuring thought.
“Don’t worry, I’ll get him back for this,” he declared.
“Just for the record, any other omega, I’d have won for sure,” Dean said while they were still lying in bed together, snuggling in order to calm their alpha and omega down.
Castiel didn’t know how to answer that. Eventually, he gave the question back, “Should I be?”
Cas could take that as ‘I don’t mind staying’ or ‘I don’t mind the scent.’ Both worked just fine, even if it was an understatement either way.
“Yeah, looks good enough to me,” Dean declared, but for some reason, his thumb was back on Castiel’s mating gland, stroking over the tender skin and reawakening that strange tingling sensation. Maybe he was making sure that it could pass for a real mating bite mark.
And then there was the bite mark on his mating gland. It had felt so right in the heat of the moment, but now that he was back home, it started hurting.
“Nothing.” It had already started. Castiel could feel the prickling sensation spread throughout his body. “I’m being summoned.”
Dean immediately took a step back while looking up to see Benny who had chosen this… weird moment between them to sneak up on them.
Cas was clearly still suspicious, so he changed the subject. He’d been curious about it ever since his talk with Sam anyway. “So, were you in a monogamous cuddle relationship with Balthazar?”
The way he kept glancing at Castiel told him that the alpha had picked up on his change in mood. Since he couldn’t complain about not getting to be all touchy-feely with Dean anymore now that they weren’t surrounded by people who believed them to be mates, Castiel quickly forced those thoughts out of his head and smiled.
He sniffed the air and just knew that he had to find this omega!
get laid.
Sure, Dean wished Jimmy would have felt safe enough with him to tell him instead of Dean having to scent it out of him, but he couldn’t even begin to imagine the prejudice Jimmy had to have faced just because of who he was, and it certainly didn’t make Dean
He shivered and tried to forget about the scent of alpha near his rut, but then someone was at his door and Cas froze in fear.
When Cas felt the beginnings of his heat low in his belly and texted Dean to come over, he felt himself get a bit nervous.
This was usually his favorite part about his job. The moment they smelled each other for the first time, looking deep into each other’s eyes as the hormones in their brains made them fall in love. He had always found it utterly fascinating.
He even fell asleep right next to him, arm still slung across Castiel’s chest in an almost possessive manner, one leg wedged between Castiel’s own. He should feel crowded, but for some reason, he didn’t.
Not letting himself think about it too much, he just hit dial.
“I… I don’t know if I ‘dig’ it… I mean, I enjoy it a normal amount…”
Unfortunately, they took the anonymity of their customers very seriously and weren’t helpful in the slightest.
In an attempt to keep his omega in check, he closed his eyes, but that only made it worse. Now, he had nothing else to focus on but the feeling of Dean’s soft lips and tongue on his mating gland, which made it tingle in an unfamiliar way.
With that, he pulled Castiel against him and ducked in for a kiss.
The last time after they had been intimate, Dean had gotten out of bed as soon as his knot had gone down. It had been more of a ‘Thanks for the fuck, I’ll be on my way’ kind of thing. That seemed to be Dean’s style. He didn’t seem like the kind of man who would hang around for too long. He had appeared out of nowhere—it was just logical that he would disappear just as quickly.
Decreasing numbers of comments tell me that it’s time to bring this fic to an end, even though it’s going to be hard to let this one go. I’ll see if I can finish it with one more chapter.
“Mhm?” Cas mumbled.
Yeah, that hole was wet and ready to be pounded into submission.
Brain: offline.
For a moment, neither of them said anything. Cas squeezed the sweater tighter.
It was on top of a hill overlooking Fairy Valley, and Castiel had to admit that it was a lovely place, so quiet and serene. As the sun was going down, colorful lights were beginning to appear here and there in the valley below, flickering in and out of existence.
“What, seriously?” Dean asked. “Just like that? You don’t want to ask me anything?”
who was sitting in bed next to him.
Giving Dean the cold shoulder had felt vindicating at first. He wanted to make the alpha feel bad because
The next morning, Dean woke up alone, but that was nothing out of the ordinary. Sometimes, Jimmy was still there, other times, he wasn’t—that’s just how their little routine worked.
Trying to awaken Jimmy’s alpha instincts, he tilted his head a bit, not
Most alphas and omegas probably did this
Unfortunately, that meant he couldn’t pull Cas aside and ask him to hang back when everyone got ready to leave. They hadn’t exactly had an opportunity to be alone because Dean had forgotten all about his plans with his friends.
Making up with Cas really was so much more important than getting his dick wet.
That was nothing compared to what it was doing to Castiel, though. The fantasy that it was
At some point, Cas—who was probably exhausted because of all the hormones rushing through his body because he was now a claimed omega—fell asleep right there on top of Dean, a reassuring weight against his chest.
Until Cas came bursting in, waking him up from a pleasant dream.
Their first kiss as a mated couple. Well, that wasn’t quite true. Their first kiss as a mated couple while neither of them was under the illusion that it was just fake.
Ah. Of course, Sammy would suggest that. And it wasn’t like Dean could tell him that
Luckily, Sam was a bit more cooperative. “I’ll see what I can find,” he said and went towards the kitchen. Justin, sensing that he was the one to follow, finally left Dean alone to fly after Sam.
Cas just got up and left the room in a huff. Well, he’d see tomorrow morning that there had been no reason to get his panties in a bunch.
That mission seemed easy enough, but keeping his erection did pose some challenges after a night out drinking. The fact that he was more excited about going to bed than about what was happening here might have been a red flag, but he chose to ignore it in favor of the familiarity of an omega’s channel squeezing his dick rhythmically.
Both Castiel and the alpha ignored him completely as the alpha took a few quick steps to him so that he could push his nose against his scent gland and inhale deeply.
Cas had been left confused by Dean’s behavior once more. The alpha had initiated foreplay only to withdraw unexpectedly. As it turned out, it hadn’t been foreplay at all, Dean had only wanted to engage in a little bit of power play between alphas. Cas had always thought that was just something teenage alphas did, but apparently not.
While Benny and Jimmy were apologizing to each other (“No, it was
“Oh!” Cas gasped and looked at him wide-eyed.
Instead, Dean grazed it lightly with his fingers, teasing it a bit because he knew how much Cas loved that. Massaging it oh so gently had the omega squirm, not with a sexual need, but with a need to be cuddled properly. By now, Dean knew all of his ‘cuddle me’ poses and he made sure to hug and cuddle the crap out of him whenever he gave Dean that special look.
They were in the middle of playing ‘Sorry’ when it happened.
In any case, with his heat approaching fast, he was getting hornier each day. That, in return, meant that all he wanted to see was Impala going all alpha on his omega’s ass and pushing that cock back into it.
The perfect image of an omega ready to be claimed.
I’m not making bedroom eyes at you! I’m doing the ‘intimidating look’ thing you just showed me.”
“Ohhhhh, Dean! I totally forgot! I have this huge problem and—Wait!” She looked him up and down. “You’re the solution!” she then yelled, jumping up and pulling him into a quick hug.
The next time Dean groomed him and touched the sensitive undersides of his wings, Castiel got aroused and one thing led to another and somehow, Dean’s dick ended up in his ass again.
“Dunno. If it’s true, Mr Olderman has to be completely blind. They’re so obviously in love with each other. No way is she cheating.”
Dean shrugged. “Don’t mention it,” he said. “Any time you need some help, you just tell me, okay?”
“Good choice,” the beta commented. “One of our most sought-after slick providers.”
“Can you get this off?” Dean asked, indicating the shirt.
When he told Bees about this new development, the omega was way too amused about this. Once he had finally stopped laughing, the merciless teasing began. Dean just rolled his eyes before he remembered that Bees couldn’t see that.
Taking Jimmy’s hand had been a bit unnerving. Even though Dean had known Sam and Benny for such a long time—Sam almost all of his life—he had felt all sweaty and his throat had suddenly been dry.
“Do we have to talk about money?” Dean asked.
Most important of all: picking up on someone’s mood. Somehow, betas managed to go through life without having that problem (although they were at least able to smell
Well, he supposed that was true. Dean really wished Jimmy had said something sooner, though, which would have saved him a lot of trouble trying to figure out
“That’s why I am here. We take these allegations very seriously.”
Now he’d have to go back and buy another bottle. He just hoped that beta wasn’t there to gloat in the fact that he’d been right and Dean should have bought more than one bottle.
But now that Dean knew Cas enjoyed to feast on the occasional secret, he might barter for another one soon. He just had to come up with something he hadn’t told Cas before so that he had something to offer in return.
Thinking about the hug and the strange (but very welcome) sensations that came with it, Dean didn’t fall asleep until the early hours of the morning. Luckily, it was Sunday and he could sleep in, so he didn’t think much of it.
“Maybe both our species are a bit weird,” Cas conceded.
Again, Cas wasn’t quite sure how to answer. He definitely didn’t want Dean to go, that much he knew. But what was the alternative? Was he ready to continue where they had left off? Dean would have questions without a doubt…
“Okay, so, see you tomorrow? Same time?”
A sudden surge of protectiveness shot through him at the sight of the deep scars, which were clearly the result of an alpha marking him. Some archaic alphas used this method on omegas in an attempt to make them unattractive to other alphas, but it was forbidden as in the past, omegas have died because of this custom.
Well, thanks for the inside scoop, Jimmy, that cleared that right up. But Jimmy wasn’t really chatty when it came to his personal life anyway. He was rather good at evading questions. Dean’s best guess—from the bits and pieces that he had gotten out of Jimmy—was that he had just gotten out of a bad relationship with an asshole alpha.
“Your turn,” Cas reminded him, leaning against him.
That didn’t sound like a good idea. If he followed his omega’s instincts, he would sink to his knees in front of Dean or roll over, belly up. That was most likely not what Sam had in mind.
Jimmy’s eyes found his and bore into him in the way that was typical for him. Since he didn’t say anything and his expression gave nothing away, Dean added, “I mean, I get how that would give you nightmares.”
Only now that he had found this new way of pranking Cas, it was hard to stop. The next time he had a sleeping angel on his hands, he did it again, this time fully alert and, to switch it up, he kissed him on the cheek. He didn’t want to play the same trick on him twice, after all.
! It wasn’t just a myth omegas told their alpha mates to reassure them.
The sound of laughter brought him back to reality. The beta pulled the lollipop out of his mouth with a popping sound and said, “I see you found what you were looking for.”
Distracting Cas with a nibble to his neck, Dean maneuvered them around so that Cas was lying on his back, and Dean was straddling him.
“You just don’t want to lose another potential client,” Dean mumbled petulantly.
Oh. Yeah, okay. The scent of an alpha in rut probably turned Cas on. Who was Dean to take that away from him when Cas was about to let him use his ass for his own personal pleasure? It wasn’t like Dean would scent back or anything.
Castiel was relieved. He really hadn’t wanted to stop seeing Dean. By day, he continued working as a cupid, and in the evenings, he could still visit Dean on earth.
All in all, it was rather unhelpful because some said being attracted to another alpha like that made him alphasexual, while others said he was fine, that it was a natural urge and that he should go and make that alpha submit to him.
Before Dean could react to that, Charlie said that she was very sorry, and then Benny jumped in with a remark about his cousin, who had recently gone through an unmating, so he knew how rough that was, and if he ever needed anything…
With a flick of the hand, the flasks and vials quickly rearranged themselves on the shelves, clinking together slightly in their haste to find their place again.
Since Dean smelled irresistible as turned on as he was, Castiel started scenting him frantically in between kisses.
were objectified. That’s what you got when an omega rights activist ran an Alpha Service.
“Are you kidding me?!
come fresh from the laundry.
“Are you freaking out because of the slick?” he asked because an innocent kiss to the top of the head hardly seemed enough to make Cas spiral like that. When Cas just shrugged against him, Dean went on, “Omegas slick in their sleep occasionally. Big deal. I can’t believe that
“No problem,” he quickly said because he would much rather have Cas call him when in need than not even know when he needed help. Plus, he had really missed having the omega close. Having him in his arms only showed him what had been missing these last few days.
For some reason, a smirk appeared on Sam’s face. “That’s what I thought.”
That was the night Dean realized
It didn’t take long for Dean’s release to slam deep into him, accompanied by a primal moan. Castiel came all over the floor just in time for Dean to knot him in an attempt to keep the seed from flowing out of his hole.
“Again?” Cas asked that evening when Dean was seeking him out once more. “Maybe you should go see a doctor about your sleep problems.”
There it was—Cas’ eyelids fluttered closed, his cheeks a delicious shade of pink. How could he ever have thought taking him from behind was a better position than doing him like this?! It basically gave him a front-row seat to witnessing the other alpha’s submission.
Dean gave up on getting the burger stain out of his shirt in favor of gaping at Sam, who rolled his eyes at him. “Gross. Get your mind out of the gutter. I’m talking about the insides of your wrists, the crook of your elbow, that kind of thing.”
of the moment, it had been easy, mostly because all they’d had to do was listen to their alpha and omega instincts.
Could you scent bond with someone you hadn’t even met?
“You have no idea how long I’ve been dreaming about this!” Dean said before moving on to lick along Jimmy’s neck while he traced patterns into his sensitive skin.
Yeah, Purgaytory was awesome!
Some morning cuddle time (and maybe more) sounded like a fantastic idea, but unfortunately, at that moment, the doorbell rang.
“Are you still embarrassed because I saw your penis?”
Luckily, a new habit was established when Dean came into his antique shop looking for something for his new business. That first time, Cas sold him an old lamp—and from then on, Dean came in to buy something all the time. Apparently, making his massage place homey would make the clients feel more comfortable to come back, and the ‘stuff’ Cas was selling was just what he needed.
That… almost sounded like Dean might have been coming back for
Jimmy just blinked up at him, the mark on his neck an angry red from where Dean had licked and nibbled and bitten at it. It kind of looked like a hickey, but of course that’s not what it was. It was simply a sign of Dean’s victory in this strange kind of alpha fight.
“My brother said I’m supposed to be looking for an old guy, mid-eighties?” the alpha said. After a short pause, he mumbled to himself, “That little shit.”
Translation: That list of alphas he wouldn’t kick out of bed? Dean was obviously not on it.
He had to say something. But how should he delicately address that Cas’ pre-heat scent was making it impossible for Dean to think about anything but rubbing himself all over the omega? And
The hug went on for a little too long, but Dean was absolutely okay with that since it gave him the opportunity to scent Cas one last time.
As soon as he had given permission, Dean stepped up to him and just…
“You’re not?”
Was he ready to tell Dean that the only experience he had with sex was a painful one that had given him nightmares and made him so scared of alphas that he couldn’t face a group of them without flashing back to that experience? That he couldn’t imagine how an alpha’s big penis being pushed into his ass could possibly
Having Dean here with him made him fantasize about all kinds of things. Maybe he could ask him to come to the check up with him. Or he could ask Dean to stay the night, which would make his bed smell like Dean, which in return would be good for the pup. He did neither of those things, though, because he really didn’t want to take advantage of the nice alpha. Dean was already doing so much just by being here.
The alpha was probably dreaming about some omega, and Cas could not let this go on just because it felt good for him.
He was neither good at reading facial expressions nor at figuring out what people were trying to say when they were talking to him—mainly because they didn’t always say what they meant and then expected him to read between the lines.
Dean sighed. “What do you want me to do here?” he asked, running a hand through his hair. “I can feel how my alpha wants to pounce on you and I… I’ll be in here rubbing my dick raw for the next few days because we have this whole ‘no sex with other people’ rule. So, I really don’t think you can expect me to stay sane while I’m in rut and in bed with my fake
. Right now, the alpha was asleep, clueless to the fact that his true nature had been revealed to Castiel in a vision. He could do it quick, before Dean knew what hit him, avenging Balthazar and Alfie in the process. After all, with hunters, it was kill or be killed.
he’d even get paid for it, while at the same time, he’d give the omega what he or she wanted. And of course, his alpha would be appeased for having been allowed to breed an omega. Win-win-win.
Dean was lousy at saying the right thing in situations like these, so all he could say was, “I’m sorry.” And, “I didn’t know you were half human.”
As far as their mating bond was concerned, they had become quite efficient at satisfying it. Spending so much of their free time together probably helped. But so did Dean nipping on his mating bite. Since they’d done this a few times now, Dean knew exactly where to nibble to get Castiel’s alpha all riled up.
“And that red pen mark was supposed to convince him?” Dean asked once Cas had finished explaining his plan.
“Uhm…” Since when did Cas pick up on these things? Well, no need to lie about it now. “Yeah. So… Be right back.”
Dean, apparently realizing what was going on, thrust up into him, into that very spot that made Cas bite his lips in a futile attempt to keep some of the more animalistic sounds in.
was going on?!
That was why Castiel had called the alpha service in the first place. No strings. This might just be what he needed to get through his heats.
It was a challenge. Not an invitation for sexual activities as it would be among mates, when an omega running away from his alpha would prompt the alpha to pursue, catch and ultimately fuck the omega. No, in the courting phase, it was all about catching and
that it took his breath away. This was the scent he wanted to smell for the rest of his life.
That voice!
“I think it’s great that you want to read up on that,” Cas said because he had gotten a glimpse of the chapter title (‘Pregnancy Heat’). “But maybe you should trust your instincts more.”
“I’m not in heat,” Cas replied while turning around to get into a more comfortable position on the bed. “You can come inside of me as much as you want, I won’t get pregnant. And I wouldn’t be allowed to provide slick if I weren’t clean.”
Cas’ eyes flitted away from his, which was… interesting.
His balls drew up tight and sparks of pleasure coursed through his body.
This was the perfect opportunity to show Jimmy that he was an open-minded person who didn’t care about anyone’s sexual orientation or jerk-off habits.
any responsibilities, but he took his self-imposed responsibilities very seriously anyway.
Dean glared at him and mumbled through his teeth, “Would you not try to get us arrested for solicitation?”
Besides, Castiel had won. He had finally found Dean’s perfect match. If Gabe had come to gloat, he had come to the wrong angel.
. I didn’t fall in love with you because you’re tough and strong and can fight my battles for me. I fell in love with you because you’re kind and compassionate and caring.”
Maybe he could try using that new ‘cuddle technique’ on Cas. Or at least ask if that was something he would be okay with. That might give him some answers…
. Was
After, when they were cuddling in bed together, the smell receded a bit, but there were still some traces of it left, and Castiel knew that he would get it back.
Whenever he did that, Dean rewarded him by being extra careful with him, very softly nibbling on his bared neck and making sure the omega felt safe in his arms. Dean only had to do what his alpha instincts told him to do because seeing Cas bare his neck never failed to stimulate his protective instincts.
“He’s gonna love you,” he said.
“It took me this long to
Castiel, meanwhile, was making good use of the licking technique, sucking on Dean’s scent gland to get to the source.
Castiel had no idea if he should get up too, but he felt it was safer if he stayed seated for now. “Sam Winchester, in legal, sir,” he told Zachariah’s back.
Finally, he felt his balls pull up once more and this time, as he pumped another load into the omega, he didn’t deny his instincts to knot him good.
Cas stared at him all intensely and his nose twitched as he scented the air, undoubtedly picking up on how aroused Dean was. As if to make sure, his eyes flitted down to Dean’s tented pants. Then his mouth formed and ‘oh’ and his eyes widened. “You want to bring yourself to orgasm.”
“You... You wanna be my omega?” Dean asked, making sure he understood what was going on here. Even though this had been the ideal outcome to his plan, he only now realized that he hadn’t expected that response. ‘Oh’ had been a lot closer to what he had prepared for. “Forever? With my mating bite on your neck and everything?”
Great. Now he was picturing Cas naked with another alpha, knots rubbing together and all.
If Dean were a cartoon, his chin would hit the floor right about now.
scent (and fuck) the last few days. But Cas wasn’t quite ready to part with Dean just yet, so he invited him in. Unexpectedly, Dean accepted, even though he probably wanted to go home, too, unpack and take a shower.
—but this wasn’t about feeling good.
The only thought that managed to placate him a bit was that the alpha was no doubt still thinking about their encounter in Purgaytory. After all, Dean had used his virgin ass good, and the bite mark on his neck wouldn’t fade anytime soon.
getting marked like that… That’s unusual.”
Being praised like that did nothing to quell his omega’s infatuation.
of the upcoming month.
“You don’t go
still early. He still had time to make the alpha aware of his issues later. With that thought, Cas let himself be even more vulnerable and drift off.
Dean even invited Cas over for a free massage, but getting naked in front of the hottest alpha on earth didn’t sound like something Cas would enjoy, so he said something like “Sure, sometime…” without the intention of following through.
When he had seen Dean drive away and assumed that he was going out with the guys, his omega had felt somewhat abandoned, which was completely ridiculous. Dean wasn’t his alpha and there was no way he could help Cas through his heat even
“If anyone’s a stranger here, it’s you,” Dean shot back because who was he to tell Jimmy who he could scent?!
“Of course, I am looking forward to getting my sense of smell back. But these last few months, I realized that scenting isn’t just about the ability to smell someone else. I like the way you’re so close to me, and the way you put your arm around me. I like feeling the vibrations of your voice and listening to your stories. And I really,
That’s why he reached out and touched Dean, careful not to wake the hunter.
That round went to them as Michael just shot them a dark look while his face did a strange thing where he forced his lips into a poor imitation of a smile.
“I told you, it’s about feelings, emotions. It takes a great deal of trust to tell someone your secrets. It’s the same trust you need to let someone close enough to cuddle with you. It’s all about how you connect with someone on a deeper level.”
Accompanying Cas to the prenatal class was a lot of fun—mainly because it gave him a good excuse to touch the omega.
Cas felt a rush of exhilaration at the approval from his alpha.
Dean followed him because what else was there for him to do?
of people who were in love with him. It was kind of hard not to be. Castiel would know.
With a sudden surge of anger, Castiel buried Anna’s file among the others so that he didn’t have to look at it anymore.
They’d kissed a lot, ever since this whole thing had started. But this kiss felt like more. It was a promise of what was to come. Something that might eventually lead to the moment he had witnessed in a vision. A bite that was so much more than ‘just a little nibble.’ A bite that was, indeed, of great import.
And maybe, just maybe, he would get his last cuddle from Dean. And many more.
“I never mind getting my hands slick,” Dean said and his tone of voice changed yet again, only this time, Castiel couldn’t figure out the meaning. It almost sounded teasing, but the reason behind it eluded him.
“Dude!” Sam was choking on his own beer. Served him right. Dean had tried using euphemisms, after all. “Are you asking me for advice on your sex life? ’Cause I don’t need that image in my head. What you and Cas do behind closed doors is your own business.”
Still, if this continued, things could get awkward, so Dean quickly thought of the most unsexy thoughts he could think of. Luckily,
Yes, Castiel definitely had the subtleties and intricacies of flirting all figured out. He might just tell Dean he was curse-free one of these days. The thought of Dean celebrating by finding another omega to fuck made him keep his knowledge to himself, though, for just a little bit longer…
From then on, Dean tried switching it up, changing positions, spooning him from behind and letting his hands roam all over the omega to cuddle him more ‘actively.’
had been the one who had just gotten his ass reamed, and then he left the living room, lights turning off again.
“No shit,” the alpha mumbled.
Cas squinted at him.  “Should I put on music?” he asked.
Somehow, falling asleep in Dean’s bed and arms had been just what he needed. Maybe it was Dean’s calming scent or the way he had held him so tightly… Whatever it was, Castiel had slept through the night like a pup.
He could smell Dean’s pleasure and love, a symphony of complementing scents from his hair to the freckles on his nose; he could smell
You gotta play the hand you're dealt, though, Dean had learned that the hard way. This might be his last chance of getting to have Cas in that way, and he wouldn’t spend it wishing for something he couldn’t have.
Balthazar seemed placated by that public display of affection. But just to be sure, Castiel returned the favor and kissed Dean back.
He should probably say more than ‘Okay.’ But what did you even say to that? Luckily, Cas didn’t seem to mind. He simply changed the topic. “I’ve been wondering. I don’t know a lot about human romantic relationships. Would you consider us to be in one?”
He pulled Cas’ cheeks apart and as expected, the gaping hole was quite red.
“He’ll just have to deal,” Dean replied. “Has probably gotten this far just because of his alpha privileges.”
Cas just nodded into the pillow because it wasn’t like he was sad exactly—he was just… He had no idea what was going on with him. He could always blame the hormones.
Someone cleared their throat.
“You know,” Dean began, “kissing does provide amazing benefits for a pregnant omega and his pup.”
“I am,” Castiel reassured him. “It will just take a while for him to get there. Do you have any toys you could use in the meantime?”
This chapter is thanks to debandalex.
But he did manage to remove the spider without killing it, so Cas thanked him with a chaste kiss. Of course, he regretted it as soon as it was over and Dean was looking at him all wide-eyed, so he quickly mumbled, “Thanks,” and averted his eyes.
“Balthazar is dead, too,” Hannah said without inflection. “Alfie is the third witch who was killed with his own witch blade. A hunter, no doubt. You should renew your wards.”
!), Dean didn’t disrupt his scenting to reply.
Curious as to what her comment about Purgaytory had been all about, he found himself on the website of the club—and swallowed hard when he realized what kind of club it was.

“Why wouldn’t I have a cell phone? I might be a witch, but a witch in the 21
and the 11
News really did travel fast around the office. Or not news so much as deliberately-told fibs as the case may be.
With one swift move, Dean just pulled him right onto his lap, Cas’ legs on either side of his thighs, and kissed him roughly.
“You sure? ’Cause I could give your omega a quick fuck.” Impala sounded amused. Castiel recognized it as teasing. Impala was doing that a lot with him.
“I am aware of that, thanks,” Cas replied. He looked down at the piece of paper he held clenched in his hands. “I just… I want to get better. If I have another attack in front of customers, I’m going to get fired,” he explained.
The alpha’s cock jerked inside of him, filling Cas up with a few more spurts, and he groaned as the enjoyable spasms continued for long moments.
Soon, they didn’t just go for walks, but did other things, too. There was the time they went to a drive-in movie because Cas hadn’t understood some reference and Dean deemed it necessary to educate him about DeLoreans. According to Dean, he had to make sure Cas knew all of these things so that he could teach their pup about ‘the important things in life.’
Well, at least it was over… Until the next time he felt the need for sexual release.
“I’m slipping my hand under your shirt,” Dean said, imagining the feeling of Cas’ warm, naked skin under his fingers and how he would always let his hand roam over Cas’ hips and up his torso.
“Cas, stay behind me. I got this.”
The scent was still there, all around him, and Castiel couldn’t decide if he wanted to just keep sniffing the air or touch his own dick because he needed some friction, too. Luckily, Dean helped out, reaching around to fist his dick so that Castiel could enjoy the moment.
“How often have you done this?” He waved one hand around, indicating the cabin.
He also knew he didn’t tell Cas how much he loved him enough because he was really bad at words and at figuring out unique ways of saying it. He did say it with every touch, though, and the way Cas just melted against him when he did showed that the omega understood what he meant.
“Dean, I… I know you probably don’t want to… But my omega missed you
Dean rolled over to look at him in the semi-darkness of the room. “If all goes well, I’m pretty sure I’m about to have one. You know—that’s kind of why we’re here.”
To everyone who isn’t a dick: It’s been a while since I posted a smutty oneshot, so I hope you enjoyed this one!

love.”
Once Dean sat back down on his chair, he asked, “Are you… afraid of me or something?”
The last few times, he’d had to take care of it by himself because omegas weren’t very keen on helping an alpha through his rut if it was just a one-night stand. Rut sex was something omegas only wanted to engage in if there was some commitment to go along with it.
“You were supposed to fuck me,” Castiel said because blowing him should be considered cheating. Castiel could blow
Leaning in, he sniffed in the direction of Dean’s scent gland. As predicted, “Nothing.”
Cas blinked at him, all ‘I didn’t know alphas could get aroused by cuddling with an omega,’ which was just—come on! And then he said, “We
Even though Cas knew he couldn’t act on his attraction to Dean, and Dean wasn’t even attracted to him in the first place because he thought he was an alpha, their alpha and omega had a lot of fun playing with each other, mostly in a teasing way, but also goading each other from time to time, seeing how far they could go.
Dean was back at his side, which was a good thing, too, even though he was rather frantic. Sam and Benny might have been there, too, but Dean was his favorite. Too bad he didn’t get to tell him that.
