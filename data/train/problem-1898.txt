“Don’t worry about it,” he assured, watching Sherlock steadily until he was forced to take a sip. “I talked to all your teachers. They were actually pretty shocked,” he said, shifting off the bed, which was still their two mattresses pressed together in a large white square. “Have you never been sick before or something?”
“John didn’t have anything to do with it,” he continued calmly, because there was always a moment of truth, and it might as well be now if it was going to be ever. “You know that. I’ve always been like this,” he said, shrugging helplessly as his father’s jaw clenched. “I came home from the first day of Year 2-”
Sherlock glanced down the corridor to where Lyle had paced away, mobile to his ear, but the other one must have been listening, as he turned his head and dipped a single nod. “Fine,” Sherlock grumbled, beckoning with a flick of his chin. “Come on.”
“I’ll have what they’re having,” John said to the waiter, who smiled, dropping off the rest of their pizzas before disappearing into the kitchen to grab the next delivery. “Seriously, what’s so funny?” John asked as their friends eased down into sighs and sips of drinks.
“It’ll be fine,” he assured, a gentle smile flickering around his mouth, and John’s chest was unclenching before he had even entirely processed the words.
had manners, unlike
“Jesus!” John spouted, his chair rolling back as he jumped, his wide eyes quickly creasing with confusion.
It wouldn’t be right to call it a smile, but John’s lips did close, a swallow moving down his throat as the corners curled briefly. He then closed his eyes again, leaning his head back against the headrest with a slow, heavy breath, chin tilted up to the ceiling, but he made no move to pull his hand away, so Sherlock didn’t either.
“John.”
“Sorry, dear,” she said, lowering her hand from her chest as she smiled. “Didn’t see you there. Was that you I heard going out?”
avoid Sherlock’s gaze. “Make it quick.”
“Still, you have to eat,” he snapped, determinedly staring down Sherlock’s glower. “You can’t just sit in the dark all day. And you’ve got to stop playing that recording; it’s not healthy!” he urged, and Sherlock suddenly found himself laughing, high and hysterical.
“Dammit, Sherlock!” John trumpeted, and Sherlock jumped, too shocked to put up a fight when John grabbed him by the bicep, yanking him to a halt. “What do you want from me!?” he blustered, but there was an undercurrent of helplessness to his tone, a rippling over the sparkling surface of his too-close eyes. “I try talking to you, you’re mad at me; I try leaving you alone, you’re

ring the brothel doorbell.” He swung a hand out at the black door with a Cheshire grin, and Sherlock glared as he swept past, effect dampened slightly without his coat.
“Don’t know that one,” John replied with faux consideration, looking up thoughtfully at the ceiling, “but I can give you an eight-letter word for smartass.” He beamed innocently across the deserted café, prompting Sherlock to sneer, and then chuckled, putting the last of the mugs on the drying rack before toweling off his hands. “I’ve gotta take the rubbish out,” he said, bobbing his head back at the door behind the counter as he wriggled the full plastic bag free of the bin. “You can whip up a macchiato if anyone comes in, right?”
Suddenly, he caught movement out of the corner of his eye, and leapt up, no longer a shred of sleepiness in him as he saw the practice room light come on, a shadowy figure moving about just beyond the reach of the light. John had seen Sherlock less than four hours ago, but his fingers still tapped against the counter in anticipation, and, when Sherlock finally did approach the window, his jaw dropped.
Mike raised an eyebrow, remaining silent, but it was undeniable that he had seen the contact’s name on the screen.
“You know,” John urged, rolling his hands. “People. In a closet. Seven minutes.”
“Well,” John muttered, clearing his throat before he swallowed, bowing his head and somehow retreating from the conversation without physically moving, “guess we should let you go.”
, because it’s driving me absolutely- Sherlock?”
“Who’s there!?”
“No,” Sherlock snipped bitterly. “Molly’s impossible to practice with. Always
Ruh-roh...
“Nearly there,” he called, like he already knew, and then smirked, leaving no doubt. He laughed as Sherlock glared, and then stopped in the grass, turning to look out over the view. “Alright, here’s good,” he muttered, sinking down to the ground, and Sherlock toppled down beside him, stretching his legs out as he propped himself up on his elbows. “You alright?” he teased, and Sherlock shifted his weight, balancing on one arm as he swatted a hand against the laughing boy’s arm.
“Professor?” a boy beckoned, and Mr. Robertson looked up, prompting Sherlock to duck down to barely peeking over the window frame. “I was wondering if you could clarify something for me from last class.”
“Er.” John blinked, mind searching and scanning for the reference this question was supposed to pull up, but he came up empty. “I-I didn’t know we had anything planned.”
“Not exactly the word I was looking for,” John replied, and Sherlock laughed, shaking his head after the car as John turned around to smile at him.
Ripping his earmuffs off, he laid both them and the gun on the ledge, folding his arms as Lestrade hit the button to drag the targets closer. No one spoke as the fluttering, black specters approached, but he could hear Sherlock’s breathing get closer at his back.
Last thing, I made a
“No, I-” the man began, looking up from his work, and then stopped once again, closing his mouth while John sternly ordered his eyes not to follow the movement of his lips. “It’ll be a while yet,” he remarked, tipping his head as he glanced at the chair opposite him. “Always is. You don’t have to…keep checking in,” he muttered, waving a hand in the air between them, and John smiled down at him, shrugging a shoulder.
“Well, I’ve only just
John tilted his head, raising a brow. “Should I worry?” he asked, and Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head.
“Yeah,” John answered with a nod. “Moved in Sunday.”
John Watson was kissing Sherlock Holmes, his interview request from Bart’s crinkling beneath his trainer as he shifted even closer, snow falling outside the windows he really ought to have had the foresight to close the blinds on while the lights of London flickered out beyond them, heralding in the Christmas that was likely just beginning, alarm clocks shifting from 24
“Oh?” he said, because it seemed like John was waiting for him to say something, seemed like the whole world had gone silent to spin on this moment.
Irene’s eyes rolled over the ceiling, arms falling to her sides as her shoulders slumped with a sigh. “And you’re gay,” she muttered, rattling her head as she stepped into the room “Aren’t gay men supposed to have better fashion sense?”

at the final.”
“Right,” he muttered, but his fingers never stopped their strumming, mind wandering away as it tried to construct a face from a laugh.
“Precisely,” the woman agreed, tipping the prescribed amount of wine into a carafe. “Which is why he deserves someone who actually shows up.”
“I swear,” he chuckled, dropping the keys on top of his chest of drawers as he stepped inside, Sherlock following after him, face flaming as he quietly closed the door, “sometimes you’re
(See the end of the chapter for
John laughed, throwing his head back into the sun, and Sherlock could not help that his lips twitched in contagion.
“I read you the message,” she snipped, and there was a small tug at the back of John’s jumper, a warning from Sherlock he promptly obliged, leaning back from the girl. “It didn’t say anything about anyone else. I should- Can we reschedule this?” she asked, finger spinning in a vague circle around the group. “Saturday, maybe? When you guys get back?”
“He could be bi,” John replied, having thoroughly considered every angle of the sexuality dilemma. “Or asexual or something. But why do you think he’s gay? Does he look gay?”
John didn’t even change out of his uniform, gathering up his things and rushing back up to Kingsley House with a wave over his shoulder and a call of “See you tomorrow!”. He was trailing mud and grass behind him as he rushed down the corridor, but he paid it no heed apart from taking extra care not to slide on the corners, and then he stopped outside the door, calming a little as he pushed it gently open.
Sherlock’s eyes widened down at his hand where he cradled it in his lap, breath hitching as his heart stumbled over a beat.
“How should I know?” Sherlock snapped. “I didn’t write the damn thing. Now will you just check my lines?”
to do it apart from what I’ve seen on the telly, and they tend to end up dead or sleeping with someone’s brother-”
A sister? It could be a sister. Or a friend. A fellow ballet dancer. Maybe the elderly owner’s niece.
Sherlock snarled, rattling his head as he spun on his heels, pacing the opposite direction, but he’d been caught, and he knew it. “What about that person leaving me notes?” he spat, desperate to gain ground, but Molly only scoffed.
“The human half, I hope,” Kavi muttered, Émile punching him hard on the arm as their laughter rattled the rafters.
John blinked down at him, hand still tangled in the emerald wool over Sherlock’s ribs. “So...it’s a rich-people party?”
,” he clarified, but Sherlock only gave him a withering look, so he quickly moved on. “I told you what happened with that though. We were never
John was fond of so many aspects of sex with Sherlock Holmes, but his favorite thing, the thing that set every nerve singing on his body like he was climaxing all over again, was the moment just before Sherlock came, when the man would devolve into breathless muttering that always spun its way down to a steady stream of John’s name before he fell silent, grinding his hair into the mattress as he arched his back, mouth stretched wide in a soundless scream.
With a frustrated sigh, he grabbed the laptop, placing it beside John’s legs as he turned around, stretching up the bed on his stomach. “They’re probably all idiots,” he muttered, clicking into the message box and beginning to scroll through the requests.
“Yes, thank you, I am perfectly aware I wasn’t there when you were being shot at by the mercenary employed by a vengeful psychopath,” he answered tartly, and it was John’s turn to cringe.
“I’ll certainly be checking more thoroughly for CCTV cameras in the future,” Sherlock muttered, and Mycroft sighed in frustration.
Irene looked up at him, shaking her head as if gravely disappointed, and then shifted in the chair, straightening as she placed her remaining samosas on the table. “There are things you don’t know, Sherlock. Things about Moran, about Moriarty. Things you’ll
“Er, ya know, the usual stuff,” he muttered. “Murders and spies and detectives and all that.”
Clinking his cup down on the table, Sherlock crossed the rug to the chairs by the fireplace, flopping sidelong over the black leather. Mrs. Hudson had managed to tut him into putting on real clothes today, and the dark jeans bunched uncomfortably, a scowl wrinkling his face as he fidgeted, tugging at the denim. Eventually, he gave up, readjusting to stare at the ceiling with a sigh as he folded his hands over his chest, thumbs sliding against the thin emerald cashmere. On instinct, he turned his head toward the red armchair across from him, the pit in his stomach somehow plunging even deeper at the sight, the very color of the upholstery seeming duller with the absence of its occupant.
“You sure about that?” he teased, and Sherlock sneered, lifting an arm to swat at him, but John deftly caught it, lifting the back of Sherlock’s hand to his lips. He chuckled, the air brushing warm over Sherlock’s skin as John grazed a kiss over the knuckles. “I love you,” he said fondly, shaking his head, and Sherlock’s heart clenched, a stiff swallow moving down his throat.
“Stop, you’re ruining it,” John interjected, grinning at the offense furrowing Sherlock’s brow, and then tugged him back in with a pull on his hands, releasing them to catch the boy once again around the waist as he crashed their lips together, and Sherlock apparently let it go, finger coming up to hook into the collar of John’s jumper.
“Dad-”
John bounced back on the sofa, startling away from the sound.
“It’s very impressive,” he said, noting a right turn at the inexplicable horse head sculpture. “I imagine Molly may reconsider her decision to stay in town when she arrives. Molly is my assistant,” he added, realizing not everyone carried about dossiers on strangers, but Ben’s lazy nod suggested he had known that fact at least.
“How?”

“Great,” Irene muttered, standing up and heading for the office coffee maker, “a broken heart.”
“Oh, please, that’s much more exciting than
“Then I’m sure people will know what it is. Now
“No, that’s not what I mean,” he said, and Sherlock waited, head tilting up at him. John lifted a hand, grinding his fingers into his temple a moment before he spoke. “What if- What if she never gets better?” he asked, blinking across at Sherlock’s desk. “What if, no matter how long she stays there, she’s never ready to leave? What if she falls off the wagon as soon as she gets out? What if-”
“Mrs. Hudson,” he confirmed, and then shook his head. “But I really should get home while I can still keep my eyes open.”
He nodded, letting his hand fall back to his side.
“No, not- Not
“Yes, but they each have a team, and they don’t play against one another in regular competition.”
“I already have. Several, in fact,” Sherlock said, his voice slightly muffled coming from the bedroom.
!” A sharp breath rattled over his teeth as he turned his face away, John watching the swallow roll down his throat, not daring to so much as blink lest he shatter the tenuous peace. Sherlock’s shoulders rose and fell with steeling breaths, a final sigh hissing out as he hung his head to the floor. “I dunno,” he whispered, shaking his head. “That probably doesn’t even-”
anything, other than some rather graphic descriptions of dancers’ toes he’d like to bleach out of his brain, that is. He didn’t know what the particular twists and turns of the man’s body were called, only that he couldn’t tear his eyes away from them, couldn’t fathom ever having considered anything beautiful when this was clearly the only true thing worthy of the word, and, periodically, when the man would scowl and rattle his head with some internal disappointment before moving back to his starting position, John would stare in disbelief, unable to conceive how he could possibly think he’d made a mistake. John had watched the odd video clip of
John had done a horrible thing, but a thing Sherlock could understand nonetheless. He’d apologized for it, Sherlock had been unforgiving for what he’d always consider to be a reasonable amount of time, and, now, as per protocol with human emotions, his anger had subsided.
He didn’t need to look down to know the mobile was inside, watching Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise much more entertaining, and his lips curled in a self-satisfied smile as the grey gaze shot back up to meet him. “My sister got one of these when she left for uni,” he said, holding the book steady as Sherlock plucked the phone from the carved space. “She said she was worried about someone stealing her jewelry, but I suspect slightly less legal motivations.”
All three men turned to John when he appeared, Sherlock still seated at the corner table while the two newcomers stood in front of him, and the flash of panic in the dancer’s grey eyes as they darted between him and the visitors made unmistakably clear what John had always suspected.
“Problem, Watson?”
watery as she called over her shoulder.
He moved through the foyer, his footsteps echoing up the staircase to bounce across the ceiling above, and crossed into the opposite wing, glancing into the kitchen to catch a glimpse of lunch—some sort of stew and a side salad, it appeared. Continuing down the corridor, he passed the closed doors of the ballroom; the open door to the library, the hearth cold and uninviting; and a couple more sealed rooms before coming to a door that was open just enough to reveal a slice of damask wallpaper, flecks of silver reflecting the light of an unseen window. Glancing both ways to check for onlookers, he half expected a voice to thunder something about the west wing being forbidden as he nudged the door open to poke his head in, the rest of his body swiftly following.
John laughed, a biting bark of breath. “Don’t worry,” he said snidely, “I won’t take him for any carriage rides without a chaperone.”
“We reckon she was abused,” John said softly, kneeling down at his shoulder, Sherlock’s fingers curling back around the bars for balance as he turned. “She’s the sweetest thing,” he continued, blue eyes clouding with the sorrow of compassion as he looked into the cage, “but so nervous with people. Fine with other dogs,” he said, eyes moving back to Sherlock’s with a shrug, “but, as soon as anyone enters the room, she finds a corner.”
,” John supplied as he sat down, snapping up a kernel of popcorn with his tongue.
John looked at him a moment longer, and then sighed through his nose, shaking his head as he dropped his eyes to the duvet between them. “I don’t know. I can’t explain it, I just- I think he’s in trouble.”
“Does John know you watch him sleep?”
“I’m not moving out,” John snapped, crossing his arms and lifting his chin.
“Thief,” he muttered, but Sherlock only grinned, turning around to grab John’s mug from the counter behind him, already filled with steaming tea.
“A few times- Sherlock!” John sputtered. “I thought you said he just
John turned, following the sharp voice to where Sherlock sat, fingers white where they gripped the leather, his eyes unfocused and turned toward the ground.
What color would the kitchen backsplash be? Could they pick it out, scan through tile samples and bicker over color combinations? Would they have to help put it in, getting grout on their hands and in their hair, the chalky white standing out bright against John’s skin and blending into the blond? Was there a fireplace? Sherlock had always wanted a fireplace, the only one in their house being in his father’s study, and he wasn’t ever allowed in there.
Harry snorted, and John snapped his head up, glaring white hot fury at her, a look that quickly shifted to Sherlock as he couldn’t help but chuckle.
Sherlock let out a loud scoff. “No,” he spat. “I would get out my violin and play a sad song just for you,” he goaded with a faux-innocent grin.
John blinked. “You didn’t know his
“Hyperbole, Sherlock, we’ve talked about this,” John snapped over his shoulder, and the brunette bit his lip around a smile as he lifted his cup to hide it. “I told them the coach left at 4:30
“On what?”
“You sure about that?” Lestrade muttered darkly, narrowing his eyes.
John sighed, finally resigned. “Fine,” he said, lifting his hands. “You can hammer in the nails for this row. But I am
Sherlock gaped, blinking furiously, and then quickly settled into a glare. “Where are we going? And I am
“You’re not even listening to me, are you?”
“So…what?”
Lestrade nodded. “He’s stewing in interrogation right now. Gonna give him another ten minutes or so.”
!” he exclaimed with violent enthusiasm, and John seemed to shake out of a trance, life sparking back into his eyes with a vengeance.
“They had a bigger budget,” Sherlock replied, shrugging a shoulder, “and a lot more to work with, it not being the forties and all. But, Chris Evans is in both of them, so-”
Sherlock instinctively reached for his pocket, an old habit even more than a decade couldn’t drive out, but John tapped him on the shoulder, holding out a small square treat.
don’t care if you sleep in jeans.”
There was a shrill blip of laughter from Mrs. Hudson’s flat, and John’s head dropped, eyes blinking with confusion, but Sherlock urged him on, reaching around to open the door before shooing him into the living room.
,” Sherlock said pointedly, his eyes widening for a moment as his eyebrows rose, “that also means it is very difficult for you to think ill of anyone. You’re a fairly competent judge of character, and if even you find someone disturbing, there is bound to be something nefarious about them.”
“I’m not,” Sherlock urged, lifting his face along with a placating hand, and, though Irene’s jaw clenched, she at least hadn’t slapped him yet. Sherlock looked back toward the window, a shaky sigh rattling past his lips. “I don’t know what to do,” he whispered, turning back to find her expression softening just a little. He swallowed, dropping his eyes a moment to watch his feet shifting on the carpet. “I-I always know what to do,” he continued, twitching his shoulders in a shrug, “and, now, I- I don’t know how to-” He trailed off, dropping his face into a trembling palm as he breathed through the cracks of his fingers, and, after a moment, he felt a pressure on his shoulder, looking up to find Irene watching him with soft compassion.
me. And you did
“Here,” said a voice to his left, and John looked up to find Mike coming around the corner, already prepared to leave and holding an ice pack.
“You’re not entirely incompetent,” Sherlock shrugged. “I’m sure your- What do you call it? ‘Gut’ could narrow it down a bit.”
obvious.”
“You could’ve woken me, ya know,” John muttered, glaring as he stepped to the inside of the bench and sat down.
,” John challenged, but Sherlock only huffed, rattling his head in dismissal.
gay-”
Mycroft didn’t say anything for a long while, Sherlock eventually returning to lobbing bread at the swans, and, when he did speak, it was soft, calm, and not at all conducive to the fight Sherlock wanted to start.
Sherlock smiled, placing a hand on the table and leaning forward. “It seems like she had a profound impact on you.”
“I- I can’t,” Sherlock said, dropping his eyes to the scattered case file in front of him. “Not yet. Not until I’m sure.”
When they reached the opposite wall, John threw open a door, releasing Sherlock’s arm and beckoning him inside, and Sherlock stepped through the opening, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the surroundings: a collection of massive stage lights, wires, and control panels stacked on shelves all around him.
“I get the end pieces!” she blurted, and then bolted for the stairs, John tossing the ball back onto his bed before taking off after her.
He should do something, say something, run screaming across the hall and tell John, because, though he might have regretted telling the truth before, he really did think he had. He’d never expected Sebastian would leave more than one, never would’ve considered it, but, now that it was here, siren song singing deliverance in his ears, it felt like a second chance, a twisted opportunity he knew he should pass, but couldn’t. And, really, it was only a precaution, a last resort, just in case the worst should happen.
Olson
“I didn’t,” he replied weakly, shaking his head, and John notably slumped in relief, his eyes closing a long moment.
John rolled his eyes, but did quicken his pace, feet moving as fast as he dared on the slick slush as they tore toward the waiting cab.
Of course, John and Mary were cast as Lysander and Hermia—Sherlock rolled his eyes even now just thinking about it—and he and Molly had been given Demetrius and Helena. The fact that he spent the beginnings of the play also chasing after Hermia was something he was violently ignoring, to the point of not even wanting to rehearse the lines from his scene with Molly that referenced it.
A burst of laughter bubbled from beyond the door, startling him out of his spiralling thoughts. Checking the time on the mantle clock, he saw dinner was approaching, and begrudgingly moved away from the window, knowing his mother would want him to be there for the dining room’s unveiling.
“My…best friend?” he surmised when Sherlock did not continue, chuckling as Sherlock nodded. “Of course, you are,” he said, shaking his head fondly. “Who else would it be?”
“We can do that here,” Sherlock argued, but Irene only laughed, slotting the faux leather strap into place and wriggling her heel into the optimum position before standing up.
“A date? With who?”
Sherlock blinked at him, shuffling a bit further to the side as a girl brushed against his shoulder in an effort to leer up over the ledge to check the progress of her beverage. “Why?” he asked, uncertain a moment if John could have even heard him over the hiss of the machines, but then the blond laughed, the sound sharp and bitter.
“Thank you!” John exclaimed, waving a hand at the man opposite. “What the bloody fascination is with the awful stuff, I will never understand.”
to me a couple years ago; that would also correlate well.”
“No, I’m sure you haven’t.”
He looked down at the floor, watching the toe of his shoe scrape over the stone. “I don’t mind changing rooms,” he offered in the way of an answer, and Mrs. Hudson clucked her tongue.
Sherlock chuckled, nearly obscuring the small squeaking sound coming down the line, but John could still distinguish the faint creaks of what he thought might be mattress springs, and the image of him and Sherlock both chatting away on their beds like teenagers in a BBC soap opera was so insufferably adorable, he simultaneously wanted to vomit and doodle hearts around their initials. “There are worse things,” he remarked, his voice adopting an ease that made John’s eyelids heavy. “A boy I went to secondary school with worked at Pizza Express. You could find him anywhere just by following the garlic.”
“I- Well, yes, normally, but I couldn’t possibly leave Irene to-”
Harry smiled, ambling toward him from the bleachers, where Clara was waiting, clearly giving the interaction some space. “What I said earlier. About not liking you,” she clarified, but it still didn’t make much sense to Sherlock, and he frowned, tilting his head slightly as he turned properly toward her. Harry’s smile broadened, and she looked eerily like John for a moment, her eyes twinkling with knowing. “I do like you, Sherlock,” she said with a nod, and the reiteration only made it more puzzling.
John was still asleep on the sofa, but light was creeping ever-closer to his resting place, and Sherlock knew it wouldn’t be long now, resolving to make the process as painless as possible.
,” Sherlock snapped, and John chuckled, hoisting his bag up from the floor.
armed mercenaries, face his mother and all of her demons, not to mention the pain Sherlock himself had heaped on. He had seen John hurt, doubting, scared, insecure, and a thousand other things that still made his stomach twist thinking about them, but he’d never seen him defeated, never seen him broken. He wouldn’t have thought it was even possible, but, then again, he was Sherlock Holmes, always finding a way, even if he had to forge the path himself, and, as John dropped his eyes, lips closing as he blinked rapidly down at the foyer floor, Sherlock knew the gift he was cursed with had done it yet again.
“But, I-” he tried anyway, but John cut him off.
,” he said, pointing his now-bare fork at John.
people who were actually twitching to leave.
close, coffee mixing with something that was most assuredly John—an earthy sort of clean, like saltwater-worn driftwood—as Sherlock drew in a breath, his lungs starving for oxygen. The movement seemed to draw John back to himself, however, and his eyes dropped as he leaned back, throat bobbing with a swallow.
Sherlock smiled, and John wondered how other people didn’t notice how fake it was. “It was kinda last minute. Didn’t get a chance to mention it to her.”
Lestrade didn’t even look surprised, only nodded down at the ground. Finally, he lifted his head with a small sigh. “You should go home,” he advised, though Sherlock doubted he could refuse. “I’ll have someone drive you. And they’ll stay outside the night, just in case.”
John smiled back at him with a short nod. “Right. See you Monday, then, Coach.”
It beat him, of course, and Sherlock opened the back door, one foot stepping inside as his mouth moved furiously across at the driver.
!?” she hissed, and Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head, but their fellows were too close for him reply, Molly unfolding away from him to include them in the circle.
Sherlock passed Mary her gin and tonic and Irene her vodka cranberry before taking a sip of his chardonnay—nothing spectacular, but better than the typical bar selection.
Mrs. Hudson still looked decidedly skeptical, brushing past John and walking to the foot of the stairs. “Sherlock?” she beckoned softly, her hand on the base of the railing as she leaned forward, those extra few inches apparently making all the difference in propelling her voice to his ears. “We’re going to get Thai food. Would you like-”
“There has, and it’s
He was awake—the rhythm of his breathing made that obvious—but only just, eyes closed and lids fluttering, but, as Sherlock watched, his lashes cracked open to reveal a sliver of a gaze, a gentle smile curling the corner of his mouth that remained visible above the blanket, and Sherlock heard the music playing before realizing his hand was the source, holding the glowing ember he wouldn’t dare name tight in his chest as he released its song into the night.
Although it was probably indistinguishable to John, Sherlock winced. He had hoped he could successfully distract John from this line of questioning. He supposed he could just cut out the less savory bits. “I was always going into the Met, offering my assistance when they were being incompetent, which is always,” he added with a scoff. “Lestrade finally saw reason and started calling me in. He’s risen in the ranks quite quickly since then. I think I could get him to Detective Inspector by summer.”
John chuckled, just one short, strangled laugh, but it sent Sherlock’s heart spiraling in his chest.
“John,” the man said softly, and John flinched his ear away from the sound, “I’m sorry, I- You’re right.”
John stopped, Sherlock carrying on a few more steps before noticing his absence and turning back, brow furrowed in confusion. “
The man appeared every kind of relieved to get away from the scene, and dithered a bit at the edge of the path in front of the flat, asking them no less than five times if they were certain they were alright, if they needed anything, if they wanted him to sweep the flat first. Only when Mrs. Hudson came to the door did he leave, giving her a quick wave and a smile that immediately withered as he caught sight of the thunder in the older woman’s gaze, and he nearly peeled out, leaving the lightning portion of her wrath to Sherlock and John.
John had managed to find the throw pillow, but also to knock it off the sofa, the pillow resting on the floor beneath the armrest his head now lay on. “I lost it,” he whined, and Sherlock might have laughed if he wasn’t so tired, simply sighing as he retrieved the displaced cushion.
,” he stressed, perhaps a little louder than intended, a woman at the next table casting a dark look over them before shuffling her chair half an inch farther away, “the last one doesn’t count. It functions as a trilogy, and it will remain, forever, a trilogy.”
“I- No,” he said, brushing down his jumper to compose himself before lifting his chin. “I’m- I’m fine.”
“Okay, that’s a start,” Mary urged, leaning forward over their combined armrests. “So, she works a lot. Good. Maybe…maybe you could get her one of those foot massage things! Or a gift certificate for a spa! That’s even girlier than the lotion though, isn’t it?” she muttered, grimacing sheepishly, but John just laughed.
John didn’t see the point in replying—it hadn’t been a question anyway—and swallowed hard instead.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, his patience for this conversation running lower by the second, and then looked clear over John’s shoulder, leaning to the side to make the slight even more apparent. “Text me if Lestrade arrives before I get back,” he directed to Mrs. Hudson, turning to the door without so much as a passing glance at John, but Captain Watson had apparently reported for duty that day, and John stepped forward, slipping his shoulder between Sherlock and the exit, one tan hand pressed flat against the door. Sherlock stared down at the fingers a moment, his vision blurring as it blazed red at the edges, and then slowly lifted his chin, fixing the man with the darkest glare he could muster. “Move,” he growled, but John didn’t so much as flinch.
God save them, singing telegrams.
“Yeah,” Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head at her, “she might need a bit of training.”
Sherlock shrugged, his knuckles popping loudly as he twisted and tugged at his hands. “That it would be inconvenient for you to be allergic to bees.”
okay, because if there was one thing John understood, it was the indelible hold addiction clasped onto its victims. “You told me,” he comforted, lifting a hand to cup gently at the side of Sherlock’s jaw. “You could’ve just not mentioned it, but you did. That counts for something, alright?” he urged, sweeping a thumb over Sherlock’s cheekbone, and, after a moment and a ragged breath, Sherlock nodded, eyes closing as he leaned his head back against the door, breathing slow and deep. John pulled his hand away, stepping back to the door. “I’ll be right back,” he promised, and, after a nod of acknowledgement from Sherlock, he opened the door, closing it behind him as he searched over the dorm.

John stood silently in the doorway, knowing better by now than to interrupt in the middle of Sherlock’s observations.
“Yes,” John broke in, a bit too nervous to wait for full sentences, and Sherlock’s lips dropped apart, his eyes wide and searching as he turned.
“They called
For instance, to any ‘normal’ person, someone moving a single seat up from where they had so childishly exorcised themselves from your company wouldn’t be anything significant. Neither would answering a call to breakfast with a dismissive grunt, stealing pencils, using their roommate’s shirt to mop up a chemical spill, or lying flat on the bed muttering up at the ceiling, but, John wasn’t much closer to normal than Sherlock, and he was absolutely ecstatic.
“Sherlock!” Molly gushed, and he turned, feigning surprise as the girl rushed him, although the hug did catch him off-guard, forcing the air from his lungs as she pinned him to the chair. “Oh, thank god! We were so worried!”
“I hardly stopped him.”
“Mycroft said Redbeard used to sleep with Sherlock when he was sick. I guess he thought he was there.”
John laughed, Irene smiling back at him, and then directed him to place the box atop a long table that had been set up near the tall railing surrounding the roof, an array of beverages and snack foods already littering the plastic surface. “How many people you expecting?” he asked, taking note of the spare liters of coke beneath the table, and Irene shrugged, beginning to unload the plates and utensils.
The door to the ballroom was cracked open, but the large room appeared to be empty, his shuffling footsteps echoing over the ceiling as he padded to the glass wall. Lornes twinkled below him, the courtyard a glowing beacon in the dark, shadows of people moving through the light streaming from the lampposts. The tree was still a silhouette for now, and Sherlock glanced down at his mobile, seeing there were only a few minutes left. He had expected there to be at least someone else in the ballroom, but, he supposed, most of the staff lived in town, and those left here had likely seen it too many times to bother staying awake. Still, he wasn’t surprised to hear footfalls behind him, though he was surprised at who they belonged to as he squinted into the dim light.
“No, just-just cancel it,” Sherlock insisted, flicking a hand through the air. “I didn’t even wanna come here,” he grumbled, and John laughed.
are you-”
“It sat in my room all that week, and I got to thinking, you know, I don’t even
Sherlock laughed, a rustling sound carrying down the line, as if the man were shaking his head against the receiver. “I think you’re severely overestimating my popularity.”
Sherlock hummed, more because the pause required a response than any actual understanding on his part, and then took another drink of water, casting his mind about for a change of subject. “What did you tell Irene?”
Mike stepped out first, an awkward breath passing before Sherlock waved John out ahead of him, and then dithered at the door, frowning down at his mobile as he scrolled over a novel of a text. “I’m so sorry, sir, but I’m afraid I’m needed at the palace.”
,” he spat, hissing over the loathsome word.
John nodded thoughtfully as he straightened, and then turned to Sherlock, his mouth quirking in amusement. “How come you can remember
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock scoffed, shaking his head at the words as he held the jacket aloft in front of him. “No. No it would not.” He stared at the heavy, wool jacket, his fingers absentmindedly rubbing into the fabric. “I’ve never been on a team.” The admission had escaped before he could think to censor it.
He shut his eyes, trying to regulate his breathing, but it was no good, the walls of the corridor still seeming to be closing in around him, and, in a fit of panic, John bolted, skidding on the hardwood as he rounded the corner and started down the stairs. Just shy of the bottom, he realized he had nowhere to go, the world outside 221B Baker Street forbidden to him until they found Moriarty, and sank down to the steps where he stood, balancing his arms on his knees as he cradled his head in his hands.
The cab ride was quiet, full of anxious excitement, and Sherlock’s nerves were buzzing by the time he entered the Met.
John chuckled, shaking his head, but Sherlock thought he understood now.
Sherlock gave him a fondly confused sort of smirk, and then left the room, his leather shoes quiet on the steps.
Entry 1 - Wednesday, October 23
John smiled down at his trainers as they marched through the fourth floor, looking up at the odd man in front of him with renewed curiosity. “You really think that’s how it happened?” he asked, and Sherlock hummed in confirmation as they turned onto the final landing, his footsteps quickening against the concrete. John matched his pace, considering a moment before vaulting to the front, catching the handle of the door ahead of Sherlock’s reaching fingers. “So,” he said, pulling the door open and smiling at Sherlock’s furrowed brow, “what are we looking for?”
“Well, what then?” Sherlock challenged, leaning back to brace himself on his palms, his elbows locked. “What would you have picked?”
“Sherlock-” Irene began, small and penitent, and somehow that shocked him out of it.
“Preferably,” he said, twitching half a grimace.
Mycroft Holmes, hammer of the British government, a man seven years his senior who needed only to snap his fingers and someone halfway around the world would drop dead,
“Of course I do,” Sherlock chirped, grinning broadly as he scanned the street for a cab. “I know everything.”
“You don’t remember?” he said, hoping to hide most of his tension with a sip, and John shrugged, placing the French press back on the counter and returning to his seat.
A few moments of tuning later, he lifted his chest, spine straight and arms up, ready to begin, but found his mind void of preference, eyes roving their way to John, as they were always wont to when not directly occupied.
“Why?” Sherlock crabbed, moving back to face the sergeant. “Why do you care?”
thinks a lot of themselves.”
“Constable Donovan!” John spluttered, surprised and humiliated. He had no idea what he looked like right now, but if the state of that towel he’d used to wipe his face was any indication…
“Because Moriarty might be watching them too,” Sherlock broke in, time too short to be skirting around the point, “and, if they leave here thinking everything’s fine, he’ll start to wonder if you’re really dead.”
me, just aloud,” Sherlock muttered, fighting off a blush at the obvious dichotomy even John was bound to notice. “You usually read them aloud.”
It wasn’t an unfamiliar feeling, this specific kind of nausea, the type of thrilling twist that spasms through you for a second at the top of that first rise of a rollercoaster. It was the same way he had felt about Mary when he had said goodbye to her outside her maths class that first day, or Sarah before that, when she had kissed him outside her house after their first date—John had sprung for popcorn, a big deal when you’re 14. Sure, there had been other girls in-between—not too many, much to John’s alternating pride and chagrin, depending on the company—but none of them had inspired that sort of feeling, none of them had even come close. And now... Well, now it was happening all over again, but—god help him—it wasn’t directed at Mary anymore.
He then quieted as Sherlock started once again reciting the characters’ lines, wriggling a little closer on the side of the hill, and it was all Sherlock could do to keep talking as the boy’s tan hand pressed against the back of his own, a little too firm for even Sherlock to write it off as an accident.
John let the sniping wash over him, content at the normalcy of the holiday squabbling, and he slowly shifted his hand beneath Sherlock’s, freeing his thumb so he could trace paths over the dry palm of his detective.
to thank you for coming all this way on such short notice, and at
“She lives just down the street from Mum,” John explained, and Sherlock turned to him, confused. “We used to walk home from school together sometimes.”
“I-” he began, tapping his fingers against the envelope. He swallowed hard before continuing. “I have something for you as well. I mean, in comparison, it’s rather- Well…” He dropped his head, turning the envelope up to his face before pushing it across toward John’s chest.
John quirked a brow. “Really?” he challenged, and Sherlock rose to it with a nod. “Well, go on, then,” he urged, folding his arms and shifting his posture to more directly face the man. “Tell me I’m a Libra, or whatever it is you do.”
Sherlock leaned against the counter by the small of his back, folding his arms as he looked out the kitchen window toward the street, unable to see anything through the curtains, but he could hear a car door slam, wheels rolling a second later. He smiled, shaking his head as he huffed a laugh through his nose, kicking at an overlooked piece of glass on the floor.
John simply stared at her a moment, blinking blandly. “You’re that person who reminds the teacher we had homework, aren’t you?” he finally murmured, and Mary glared at him while Molly and Sherlock chuckled.
“’Get all weird’, John? Really?” Sherlock said wearily.
John chuckled, apparently aware, and they slowly made their way out of the room.
“Want me to give her decaf?” he muttered, bobbing his head toward the two girls, but Sherlock only laughed.
“Because he said I could bring you,” Sherlock explained, but only silence greeted him. “Molly?”
“What could someone possibly do in a closet for precisely seven minutes?”
Sherlock frowned, tilting his head at the screen as it chimed again.
Sherlock pouted, nothing short of sulking into the room behind him as John headed toward Dimmock, who was engaged in conversation with Molly by the fireplace. They both looked up at his approach, polite smiles on their faces, and John wondered what it must mean that shouting matches carrying on up the stairs were no cause for alarm in 221B.
“Oh my god,” he wheezed, covering his mouth with a hand and trying to rein it in. “What would that even
“A what?” Sherlock muttered, looking down at the invitation, and then turned his attention back to John as the blond chuckled.
“John,” he began again, “I have to. I have nowhere else to go.”
“What?” Sherlock asked, sending the piñata flailing away in a dizzying rotation as he turned to the blond.
“You know something, Alice,” he said, more venomous than Sherlock had ever heard him, and the woman’s faint trembling became even more pronounced, “and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.” He flicked a glance their direction, indicating to go ahead of him through the door. “I’ll give you some time to think about what you wanna say next,” he added, and they left, leaving the woman to hang her head and sniff quietly down at her lap.
“Long shift,” Sherlock remarked, and John shrugged, pressing down on the accelerator.
Sherlock closed the file, heart palpitations dissipating with the covering of skin, and turned to face John.
“Maybe,” he said, nibbling his lip, “but it was some time ago. I was going to put my landlady down.”
“No,” John echoed, shaking his head, frowning at the boy’s stiff spine where he stopped just inside the doorway, arms folding over his chest. “Why?”
“How would you suggest we do it, then?” Lestrade barked, peeling free one of his ears.
“Sherlock.”
“John!”
again.
“What!?”
John shook his head, mouth twisting into a disdainful sneer as he scoffed. “No, he wasn’t,” he snarled, and the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stood up at the icy venom contained in those three words.
‘I’m not miserable,’ John had blustered, to which Sherlock had simply quirked a brow.
He merely hummed again, but it sounded less agreeable.
Sherlock smiled, biting hard on his lip as he fought to keep it from blooming into a grin.
Sherlock was on his mobile when John reappeared, but he cast him a small smile as he walked past, checking on his tables, one of them requesting another drink.
John stayed still a long time, propped up on his elbow until his shoulder went into spasms, and then lowered himself down onto the mattress, pulling some of the duvet from behind him and bunching it up beneath his head.
Sherlock looked up abruptly, clearly shocked, but the surprise quickly gave way to narrow-eyed suspicion.
Sherlock turned to him at that moment, and there was a flutter of panic wherein John instinctively wanted to hide his staring, but then he remembered he no longer had to, and simply met Sherlock’s gaze levelly as the detective lifted an eyebrow.
“Kent,” he said simply, his eyes narrowing slightly as they shifted between John’s.
Sherlock cleared his throat, shuffling minute inches closer, but the effect was staggering, the moment spiraling to intimate as his voice lowered. “John?”
Sherlock smiled for what felt like the first time in days, rolling onto his back as he held the phone in front of his face with both hands.
There was a plush area rug covering most of the room, a simple pattern flecked with creams and grays so as not to conflict with the deep jewel tones and gold draped across every other surface in the room. A navy velvet chaise was pushed under the wide window, draped with a soft gray throw blanket and single gold-embroidered pillow. A desk was set into the corner, warm wood stained dark, an upholstered chair turned out and waiting for an occupant. The bed took pride of place, a large wooden four-poster with purple velvet curtains tied back with decorative gold rope, the luxurious color bringing out the purples and blues in the lush bedspread, gold thread stitching repeating swirling patterns over the surface like a star-strewn tapestry of the night sky. His bag was open at the end of the bed, the garment bags holding his suits he’d folded inside already hanging in the open closet set into the wall, and Sherlock lowered his briefcase against a leg of the bed with a muted
“We don’t all bring a compass to the club.”
“I do understand,” Sherlock interrupted, the anger gone from his voice, but it was replaced with something even more disturbing, a bitter sort of resignation John didn’t want to ever hear from his mouth again. “Moriarty needed to believe you were dead, and I wouldn’t have been convincing enough if I’d known you weren’t. It was the only logical thing to do,” he said evenly, eyes never leaving John’s. “If it had been the other way around, I would’ve done the same thing.”
John did, Sherlock growing gradually stiller as the story spun on. By the time he got to the part where Sherlock found him, the man’s fingers were parchment-white on the leather arms, and John was feeling supremely guilty. And he was about to make it worse. “Actually, there was something I- I thought of,” he said, and Dimmock’s eyes snapped back up from his pad.
in the loo.”
“-and I just
“Pretty good,” John shrugged, placing his folded fresh t-shirt and jeans into the locker for after the game. “Little nervous, I guess. First game and all.”
“Oh, that-that was my roommate, sir- Coach!” John corrected with a snap, and Coach Powles laughed, shaking his head down at the floor. “It…it was actually his idea. That play,” John ventured, not wanting Sherlock to get into trouble for being on the sidelines.
“Good,” he replied, nodding deeply. “One of us should,” he added, grinning as Sherlock laughed. “Well, I’ll- I’ll see ya later,” he said, flipping a brief wave, and Sherlock smiled, returning the gesture with a nod.
The instant the leather hit his hands, all sound drained from the universe, his own heartbeat wailing in his ears as he willed his legs to give more than all. The world could be burning away behind him and he would not know; his focus narrowing solely onto that goal line getting closer and closer with every, burning meter. Movement flashed across the corner of his eye as the Leamington fullback charged toward him, the last sentry blocking his path. He took three, long, lunging strides, and then propelled himself forward, feeling a chunk of dirt come loose under the spikes of his boot. The line passed beneath him, a blur of white in the green, and there was the faint brush of a body against his calf before he was crashing to the earth. The ball was under him, an uncomfortable pressure against his stomach, and there was nothing but dark and dirt and echoing silence. He lifted his head to the pitch beyond him, raking his cheek against the grass until his eyes found a pair of black shoes.
Sherlock smiled, every hint of nausea and chill disappearing with that one, simple, merciful act of John allowing it to drop.
John pointedly avoided Sherlock’s glare as he shook his head. “Naw, just banged it up a bit when I dove in here for cover. It’ll be fine after I ice it.”
As if he needed Sherlock’s opinion on his love life. Please.
Sherlock merely shrugged, and John couldn’t help but smile at the perplexing boy.
“All I ask is that you watch out for him. Make sure he doesn’t run off on some hunch and get himself killed.”
“Nothing,” he softly assured, and then, because he could now… “I love you.”
“Of course,” he said softly, moving toward the door, and then stopped, turning hesitantly. “You know, if you- If you need anything, anything at all, I-”
“I- The last time we- That night,” he finally settled on, looking at Sherlock uncertainly, as if there was any conceivable way he could have forgotten, “I-I didn’t mean- If I- If I made you…uncomfortable-”
Irene grinned. “Why, thank you, gentlemen! Just up here, right?” She pointed back toward the stairs, and then immediately began ascending them, not even looking back at them for confirmation.
?!” Sherlock exclaimed, his eyes wide and scandalized as they flashed with silver indignation.
Sherlock blinked, his forehead wrinkling with faint uncertainty. “I- I haven’t-”
“Yeah, seriously,” John spat, stepping to the side to block her view, “and he’s damn good at it too. Now don’t you have something better to do, like—oh, I dunno—catch the killer he found for you?”
“Shh,” the blond’s voice said from overhead, “just breathe. It’ll all be over soon.”
“I- Sherlock-”
“Well, sometimes it’s John,” the man countered, but quickly continued. “We found another one. Hannah Olson.”
“How can you even tell he’s having a hard time with it?” Anderson asked, apparently unable to take a hint, and Lestrade’s exasperated sigh carried through the walls. “He’s like a bloody
The heavy oak door shut with a soft
The mentioned sofa and one of the chairs were dark leather, and John’s fingers twitched with the urge to confirm his suspicions on their softness. The opposite chair was large, covered in patterned, red fabric, and looked like it would be hard to leave if you ever sunk down into it. The room was flanked in two different wallpapers, both swirling designs in brown and crème, but the otherwise garish contrast somehow worked in the room. Directly in front of him was what appeared to be the skull of some sort of bull, hanging on the wall in all its macabre glory. The bookshelves surrounding the fireplace were full of dusty, leather-bound volumes, as well as an odd contraption John assumed had some vital, scientific purpose. The tables and other surfaces of the room were littered with cardboard boxes and papers, and John knew without being told that Sherlock had stayed here at some point, although it could have been for anywhere between two days to two months, knowing how quickly he could make a mess of a place.
. “I’m so sorry; I didn’t see you.”
His microscope and various other papers and petri dishes had been pushed off to one end of the table, stacked and sorted with obvious care. In their place were two large plates—one piled with waffles, the other with slightly burnt bacon—and a variety of syrups, whipped cream, and jams, the latter likely intended for the toast that sprung up at that moment, drawing John’s attention away from the powdered baking mix still clinging to his arm.
“Why not?” he muttered, leaning over the edge of the bed to peer into the shadows beneath, snatching his phone from the cold tile with a deft swipe of his hand.
“I did Chinese food recon when I moved in, alright?” he snipped, shaking his head as Sherlock laughed. “Now, can you pick a place before Mrs. Hudson faints of hunger?”
to, and I-” A swallowed rolled down his throat, eyes blinking at the ground before he drew in a ragged breath, lifting his chin and holding Sherlock’s gaze with heartstopping sincerity. “I know I hurt you,” he said, and Sherlock had to look away, arms folding protectively over his chest, “and you have every right to tell me to bugger off, but...I
“Eurgh, Sherlock!” John bleated, grimacing.
Sherlock was sure he was going to throw up, his stomach twisting and twirling like one of those horrible circus acts his mother had taken him to once as a child. He shook his head, lifting a trembling arm as he took a shaky step back. “John, don’t.”
“I can’t do it.”
“We’ll be fine; go ahead,” she assured, and Greg nodded in temporary parting, tapping at his mobile as he made his way out of the throng of impatient travelers. Molly watched him go, a dewy smile on her face, Sherlock staring at her with a climbing brow when he noticed a bright yellow suitcase in the corner of his eye.
“Really?” John chirped, tilting his head with a faux-frown of consideration. “Why would I have to thank you? After all, you
John pressed his lips tight together, trying to hold a blank expression. “Maybe I was just going the wrong way,” he argued. “Like you said, I haven’t lived in London very long.”
For a split second, just long enough to feel the beginning spike of panic, but not so long to yet understand why, John did nothing, simply holding Sherlock to him as Sherlock pushed against his mouth, and then, tentatively, his shifted his lips, even that small movement sending a shiver shooting up Sherlock’s spine. A blink later, however, and his shiver turned into a gasp, one of John’s arms tightening around his waist while the other lifted, tan fingers tangling in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him close and tilting him slightly as he fit their mouths more firmly together.
“Oh, come on, don’t be like that! We were having a good time!”
“Comforting,” Sherlock grumbled, reaching for the door handle, but Victor blocked the way, Sherlock’s hand stopping short in front of the man’s bare chest.
His skin was pale, stretching across prominent cheekbones that swept in sharp angles across his face. Brown curls hung haphazardly across his forehead, but it was his eyes that sent a cold shiver up John’s spine. They were pale, grey-green in the light from the window, and staring up at him with an intensity that froze him to the spot. There was something threatening in that piercing gaze, as if Sherlock could see every hope and secret laid out bare in front of him, and John screamed at himself to look away, but he couldn’t bring his eyes to do it. He started when the boy spoke, forgetting that time had not frozen quite as much as he had.
“Really, Mr. Watson, there’s no need to cause a scene. I assure you, I am not taking you anywhere but back to Langley.”
“When did you see her ring?” Mrs. Hudson asked, leaning forward with a squint.
“Right.”
of the lock.
Victor sighed, his entire body wilting with relief. “Thank you,” he squeaked, nodding fervently. “Thank you, sir. I-I swear, I won’t-”
345 steps later, he threw open the laboratory door, physically shaking with restrained rage.
Scotland Yard!”
“Captain.”
Sherlock shrugged, shifting the glass farther in from the edge. “I didn’t like any of the beer.”
He’d need another few minutes to be sure.
There was a thud as Sherlock’s arm must have come back down onto the desk. “Can I do a soliloquy?”
“No, I just...need to lie down.” He nodded, as if to congratulate himself on his fabulous idea, and then leaned forward to place the cup on the table, Sherlock pressing him back into the cushions as he wobbled.
“No! Well, yes, but that’s not the
“Oi, Watson!”
At first, he had blamed himself, questioning everything from his handwriting to his morning breath, but, in the end, all his theories were rebuffed, Sherlock not the type to let a grievance go unspoken if it were against another person. No, it was this case, John was sure of it.
“Pity,” Sherlock deadpanned, the lab door closing with a snap between them, and John was still giggling about it as he lathered shampoo into his hair ten minutes later.
“Thanks,” he murmured, and Mycroft bobbed his head in acknowledgement, giving Sherlock a last pointed look before descending from sight.
Mike shook his head, fighting back a smile. “No, it’s Sunday,” he answered, holding out his hands, which carried the salvation of two pills and a glass of water.
“I like it,” John said as he took Sherlock’s hand.
“Well, that depends,” Sherlock said, leaning forward as he planted his elbows on his knees, chin perching on his hands as they folded. “How much did you use on Jeanette Parker?”
“Already drinking, I see,” John muttered, and Greg sniffed, shaking his head as he released John from his side.
“What about him?” she echoed, leaning forward as muffled voices rose through the floorboards. “He faked his death!”
Sherlock knew it wasn’t necessary, knew nothing would happen tonight, knew enough about Moriarty to know he was nowhere near done with setting the stage, but he also knew all these arguments would be futile, so he simply nodded. “Alright,” he replied, feeling the beginnings of the adrenaline crash tugging at his muscles. “Thank you,” he added, giving Lestrade a pointed look, and the man returned it, still torn even as he nodded. Sherlock turned away, walking toward the door, but Lestrade called him to a halt.
“Is that what the kids are calling it nowadays?” Molly drawled, waggling her brows when John gave her a flat look, and then laughed, John turning away to rinse out one of the blenders. “So,” the girl continued after a time, folding her arms on the counter as she leaned forward, “he mention the ballet thing yet?”
“Because we’re covered in black powder and we’re about to start lighting things on fire.”
John looked mutely between the article of clothing and Sherlock’s face, clearly expecting the latter to burst into laughter and reveal some grand joke. “No,” he finally said.
Slowly, his laughter died away, and he smiled distractedly at the side of Sherlock’s face. Every feature was suddenly so much more defined, from the slope of his neck to the shades of steel in his eyes, and John just couldn’t stop beaming, his ribs stretching to the breaking point around the bubble of happiness that expanded exponentially in his chest at the thought that he might actually have this, might get to trace those cheekbones and brush at those curls, find the answers to all the questions he tried not to ask himself.
!?” Mycroft spouted, rounding on Sherlock, eyes blazing.
of December, after all—but it was strange that there should be anyone to hum in his room at all. Of course, it was also strange that his room should have a bed big enough for him to be splayed out as he was now, or a pillow as soft as the one he was currently lying on.
This was supposed to be up on Saturday but it's been a fucking WEEKEND y'all. Anyway, this chapter is 5k and will have to last you a while because I'm moving and plan to be unpacking or asleep for the next couple weeks.
“Mr. Watson, please,” he interjected, and a shiver ran down John’s spine at the cool venom in those words, although the man’s tone hardly rose at all. “Get in the car.”
“You fixed it!”
“Miss what?” the customer said, and John started, snapping a look down to find the man had leaned forward, peering up from alongside John’s hip.
“Okay, so,” said a voice at his right, and he jumped, hiding the message under the table as John approached, “here’s a card.” He passed down a small slip of paper, black with white and red writing in what he was sure was supposed to be an eye-catching font. “It has the time and address and everything on it, but I wrote my number on the back just in case you get lost,” John added, shrugging a shoulder, evidently oblivious to any reason why this would make Sherlock’s throat close up. “It’s just a party, sort of a mixer type thing. And, of course, we’re always recruiting for the society,” he tossed in with a wink that Sherlock might have hallucinated. “Irene wanted to do a theme, though, so it’s technically a traffic light party.”
His mother’s lips closed, a smile twitching at them as her eyes sparkled with restrained mirth. “My hands are clean,” she assured, lifting her palms up in demonstration, and Sherlock leaned forward, scrutinizing them with narrowed eyes a moment before cautiously handing over the card. She smiled at him as she took it, turning the heart over in her hands to read the message, and then stilled, expression stretching with growing wonderment as her eyes scanned over the words again and again.
John wolf-whistled at an orange polo he knew immediately would be his personal favorite for the day, earning himself said shirt being flung out of the changing room like a whip a few moments later, hitting him square in the face.
With a flick of pale fingers, the photograph fell into the heat, the corners curling as they blackened, and then it caught, shadow and flame circling the frozen happiness for a moment before it was completely devoured.
John grinned, grabbing fists of the orange material and cocooning himself tightly. “You want one?” he asked, jerking his head backward where the EMT had removed a small stack.
“You did,” Sherlock replied, and John huffed a breathy chuckle. “Several times.”
“It has everything to do with this.”
“John!” he blurted, a hand gripping onto John’s shoulder as he supported him to sitting. “Are you alright?”
“Always wanted to know where I was, who I was with. Honestly, you’d think we were committed,” he replied, scoffing up at the grey clouds before sucking in another drag.
Sherlock couldn’t argue or agree, couldn’t do anything but try to keep himself from hyperventilating and/or jumping out the window he calculated he could reach in between 2.3 and 2.8 seconds.
“Mhmm,” Sherlock murmured as he stomped through the elaborate, marble foyer, and John glared furiously at the back of his head. “Ah, Lestrade!” Sherlock chimed as he swept through a doorway. “And Anderson,” he added, his tone and face falling into disdain. “Here to miss more evidence?”
Sherlock shrugged, but there was nothing uncertain about his gaze, cold and calculating. “No more than everyone else does,” he answered easily.
“I dunno,” John replied, shrugging as he leafed through his limited options for neckwear, “it was kind of a longshot. And then I ended up with you for a roommate.” He turned to the brunette, flashing his most dazzling grin. “Doesn’t get much luckier than that.”
He waited, his fingers tapping against the sides of the smartphone as he stared across the street. He could tell the moment John’s mobile buzzed in his pocket, saw the stiffness ripple through his muscles, and watched as he ignored it, leaning further over his coffee and continuing to talk to Mary.
“Oh?” Sherlock inquired, though he was unconcerned, Mike’s awareness of the shift in their relationship having already been obvious to him.
“John!”
“Have you been washing it?”
“She wanted to check out the bookstore,” Harry replied, tone a touch forced, and Sherlock turned, looking across John to scan shrewdly over her face.
He typed in the password—Iwant221believe, one of John’s few joys in life being changing his password to something Sherlock had to work to remember—and waited for the previous session to load. Several tabs were open, John gleaning from the titles that all of them related to stages of maggot development, and he quickly minimized the one left on the screen, shouting across the room with a grimace.
“And, in the winter,” he continued, gesticulating over his knees, “they form a cluster in the center of the hive—the queen in the middle—and shiver to keep the temperature up, rotating from the outside to the inside so no bee gets too cold.”
John crossed his own arms and stared right back, lifting an eyebrow with slow deliberation.
“‘Fraid you’re out of luck though,” John sighed dramatically. “I’m just one of the forwards tonight. No hooker for me.”
“So, all reactions are reversible, right? Like, in theory?” Irene began, rolling her hands in the air, and John nodded. “So then, why do we not use an equilibrium sign for all of them? And how can you tell?”
, but I was actually thinking of me.”
“I will be in a bit, just...coming down from the adrenaline rush.” He turned his face as Sherlock chuckled, smiling at him through the darkness. “Not every day a woman climbs through your window.”
Sherlock huffed, and John turned, finding the detective leaning against the side table, fingers tapping a rhythm out where they gripped the edge.
about!?” he spluttered, and John stared at the backroom door, his hand still resting on the wood even as he stopped applying pressure. “They were in here for five minutes! And Victor and I are just friends, I don’t know what you think you have to be jeal-”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, starting toward the bathroom. “Text me.”
“I’ll tell him,” Sherlock continued, letting some of his anger slide away as he turned his head to the side. “Eventually. Soon,” he added as Lestrade opened his mouth with an intake of breath. “I just- I need time. I need a
Sherlock growled in frustration, spinning on his heels away from them. “I’m taking the stairs.”
“I’m gonna try not to take that personally.”
“Respect,” John supplied icily, watching Irene’s pale, fuzzy face turn to him from the corner of his eye. “He wants to impress him.” John looked up, eyes boring into the wall he knew Sherlock’s door lay beyond.
“I should go,” he said, waving a hand toward the pitch, which was filling up with his teammates running drills.
“Do you like it?”
Seconds later, he turned the bend, and time abruptly moved into slow motion. He couldn’t say exactly when he realized what was happening: at the glint of the gun held aloft halfway down the hall ahead of him, the flash of the pistol as it was fired, or the cataclysmic bang that shattered through his body, but, either way, John was diving into the alcove of an office and hoping, of all things, that he wouldn’t be buried next to his father.
“Jesus!” John spouted, wrenching his fingers free as he whipped around, steadying his back against the shifting metal wall.
Lestrade blinked, Sally glared, and Anderson gaped like a gasping fish.
“You never call,” Molly murmured, a fond glint in her eyes that normally meant he was getting a hug whether he liked it or not, but the baggage trolley was between them, so she merely reached a hand out to drop an affectionate squeeze to his wrist. “Well, if you’re foolish enough to think you can live without me,” she teased, wrinkling her nose at his rolling his eyes before looking back to Greg, “I would prefer to stay in town, I think.”
He jolted, turning halfway through a message he probably would have regretted sending anyway.
His murderer was being far too loud. And chuckling, the insensitive berk.
. That and
John hovered, his fingers scraping against the wooden table just above Sherlock’s notebook.
She stopped, lingering several meters away at the top of the hill, but Sherlock could still clearly see the tortured expression on her face, the shine of her eyes before they dropped to the ground, her jaw shifting as she swallowed. She looked up again a moment later, clearly having steadied herself, and, holding his eyes, she shook her head in a single slow motion, and that, somehow, was his final straw.
“And what’s wrong with that?” Sherlock snapped, folding his arms defensively.
to him. Not all the time, not at all apart from that moment, actually, but it had been there. And then he had run away, texting that insipid girl in order to cling to his heterosexuality.
John’s eyes shot up, widening with shock a moment before a disbelieving grin unfurled over his face. “Needs must,” he muttered, shrugging, and Sherlock laughed, relief bubbling up from his chest and cascading down his limbs.
“Finally!” Molly cried, shoulders wilting forward in relief. “I’m starving! How long does it take to shower, honestly?”
He’d grown up being shuffled between the manor and boarding schools, his father’s work keeping him away from home and his mother unable to manage them after she got sick, and then, after she died, he never wanted to go home, the hollow halls haunted with the ghost of her and the family they once were. He’d stayed at school for every break he could from the age of nine, only back at the manor for summers with his brother and the never-the-same staff, his father still on a plane more than he was in his own home. And then he was gone too, a sudden heart attack in his top-floor office at the law firm.
Sherlock bent over his knees, gasping as he groped at his ribs. “I’m sure my brother could have something arranged.”
He tightened his arm around her waist, releasing her legs to land on the ground, and she righted herself with a satisfied huff, flipping her hair back over her shoulders.
John licked his lips, Sherlock tracking the nervous tick with his eyes, and then swallowed, blinking away to gaze unfocused over Sherlock’s head. He pulled his legs back, releasing Sherlock’s foot as his mouth opened, but Sherlock held fast to his loosening hand, silencing whatever excuse or apology he had planned. John frowned, squinting at his captured fingers before meeting Sherlock’s eyes, brow furrowing with a question Sherlock couldn't find the words to answer.
“Oh my god,” John breathed, stepping across the marble to break out onto the terrace. “Oh my
“Fair enough,” he allowed, and Sherlock chuckled, the both of them gradually falling to silence as they stared across the space between them, which John closed slightly as he began ambling forward. “Look, um, I know it’s not really your thing,” he started, rolling a hand through the air as he tipped his head, “but- Well, everyone always goes to Pizza Express after the games, and- I mean, if you’re not busy…” He trailed away, apparently incapable of getting all the way to end punctuation, but the sentiment was conveyed regardless, and it didn’t escape Sherlock’s notice that his heart flipped even grander than it had been all week, the feeling apparently redirected.
“As I was saying,” he snipped with a pointed
Mike smiled, shrugging a shoulder. “I just think it might be better to go to Harrison directly. It was his decision, after all, and you will need to deal with him in the future if Vincent is taking a step back. It may garner more resentment than necessary for you to go over his head.”
“I don’t want to play Scrabble,” Sherlock replied, chuckling faintly before meeting John’s wary expression with a reassuring smile. “And I might take you up on the takeaway later, but, right now”—he bent his knee slightly, tugging John a few inches closer where his skin caught on his shoulder—“I really wanna put that rainbow condom to good use.”
Once again, John shook his head, his face heating as he realized how absurd it all sounded now that he was forced to explain. “Not really. I mean, it was just the once, and not for very long. He’s really only coming because he’s a friend of Irene’s—she’s the old friend Molly invited.”
“Oh!” Harriet Watson said, just as startled as Sherlock as she drew her outstretched hand back to her side. “Sorry, I- Hi,” she muttered, lifting her fingers again in a faint wave. “Sherlock, right?” she added, pointing questioningly at him, and Sherlock was just opening his mouth to reply when John drew up behind him.
John glared at him, but it was only a flash, the half-hearted attempt of someone who knew they were exposed. “Fine,” he muttered, an obligatory expression of irritation before returning to his search. “Taylor,” he finally spoke again, this time much more certain.
“Oh my god.” John folded his arms on the table, dropping his head over them, but got up when his mobile beeped a few moments later, walking back into the living room to retrieve it off the coffee table. “Melissa,” he mused, pausing in the doorway, and Sherlock hoped Mrs. Hudson wasn’t too alarmed by his stomach crashing through her ceiling. “Melissa… Oh,
be alright.”
Mrs. Hudson and he swapped ratings for a few minutes—her favorite so far had been the blue and purple paisley number—before a loud, frustrated sound emanated from within the fitting room, something between a growl and a whine.
“Queen Mary just scored,” she reported from the skyway, and Sherlock blinked at her, growing more outraged with every toe he lost feeling in.
“You could’ve left it out,” Sherlock suggested with a shrug.
A door clicked open behind her, swinging in as the occupant stepped out to lean against the doorjamb. “I’ve created a monster,” Irene Adler said, a fond smile curling her scarlet lips, silver nails perched on the hip of her tailored black dress. “This must be what having children feels like.”
Maybe Moriarty had taken John from him after all.
Sherlock nodded, quirking his lips politely, and John could tell he was evaluating Harry, trying to figure out which personality he ought to portray for this encounter.
people, and, for a price, he can make a call and make your problem go away. Something like-”
“Yes it was!” she screamed, and John coiled back a half step. “If you had kept your mouth shut-”
was something new, something Sherlock had never seen before, and he couldn’t predict it, couldn’t see the variables and possible outcomes laid out in a list before him to be weighed on the grand scale of probability. And, where only a few months ago that unprecedented challenge would have ranked highly for best possible turn of events, now…well now he wasn’t the only one at risk.
window.”
There was the sound of a door opening, and, a moment later, Sherlock appeared at the top of the stairs. His arms were crossed, his lower lip pushed out slightly in a pout as he glared glittering, silver daggers down at John.
The man had opened the file on the table, one hand flicking through the pages while the other twisted a pencil in the air, the arm propped up by an elbow on the white tablecloth. His dark hair swirled in thick curls that hung down from his forehead as he bent low over a page to make a quick notation, and, as he leaned back, the candles of the centerpiece caught on his sharp cheekbones, draping shadows over his thoughtfully furrowed face.
Sherlock frowned at the side of John’s face, uncertain if it was a trick of the firelight making it look pinker than normal. “Like what?”
A ball had hit the chain-link a few meters from where they stood, one of the impromptu lunchtime games on the lawn having apparently stretched beyond its bounds, and Sherlock barely had time to find the oblong leather object in the grass before it was being snatched up, tan hands protruding from the telltale blue-and-white-striped cuffs of the school’s rugby team jackets to pluck it from the ground.
“Only once?”
“Won’t have to cut it off, then?” Sherlock murmured, and John chuckled, lifting his eyes to the detective.
“I’m going to get you some,” Sherlock answered, planting his hands on John’s shoulders and steering him toward the stairs, Mrs. Hudson covering her grin with a hand before hiding behind closed doors.
“Yeah, that’s one thing I don’t understand,” Lestrade said, shaking his head as he frowned at Mycroft. “You said we were supposed to pretend John was alive in order to draw Moriarty out, but now we’re actually…pretending we’re pretending he’s alive?” he murmured, finger shifting side-to-side through the air as he puzzled it out, but it must have made more sense to Mycroft than John because the elder Holmes nodded.
John smiled, that appearing enough of an explanation, and then disappeared, two cups clinking down onto the counter a few moments later. “So,” he said as the cutlery drawer rattled, “how was your night?”
“And then you called him a vampire superhero and laughed until you almost threw up.”
“Like a vase?” John teased, and then broke out giggling, the resultant stumbling making Sherlock’s task impossible.
“That is certainly a word,” Mrs. Hudson laughed. “Well, I suppose you’re headed to lunch. Sally should have everything ready in another ten minutes or so.”
“Were they, though?” Sherlock quipped with a patronizing tilt of his head, cackling anew as John glared. “Oh my god!” he gasped, trying to pull air into his lungs. “Oh my god,
“Well, yes, but, if he doesn’t
“And you want me to…go there?” Sherlock murmured, pointing from his chest to Greg.
“Good for you,” John deadpanned, and Sherlock didn’t know who was more startled by the rebuke, himself or Irene.  Irene probably wasn’t also having strange, heated, leaping sensations skittering over her chest, but he wasn’t going to rule anything out. “Now, do you know what Moriarty likes?” John crooned, voice rising through the sentence, like asking a question of a child.
“Yeah,” John confirmed, lifting his brows with a deep nod. “I opened at work this morning.”
marathon set up on John’s laptop in front of him. “Why?” he asked, eyes narrowing up at John in the doorway, or, more specifically, the blond head that poked around the doorframe, the rest of him hidden behind the wall.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, John chuckling, and then they lapsed into silence once more, eyes repeatedly meeting and darting away.
without a constant stream of scientific commentary I honestly don’t understand a
Sherlock did not immediately reply, simply watching Victor for a long moment in silence, the blond’s face gradually growing puzzled. “No,” he finally said, so soft, it nearly didn’t carry to John’s prying ears, but then he shook his head, voice strengthening as his jaw set. “No,” he repeated, and Victor sighed, diving back into his tirade, which John took as his cue to leave.
It was a long moment before Sherlock answered, fingers shifting against his biceps as he tightened his hold on himself. “Did you hear anything?”
“Wait, hang on,” John interjected, lifting a hand as he stepped out from around the counter, moving between them. “How did you know I was gonna ask him to that party? Or that I sent the secret admirer note?” John folded his arms, tilting his head as he awaited an answer, and Molly floundered, mouth flapping as she looked between them.
can do that,
“DON’T MOVE!” John shouted, Sherlock ducking his head as the flashlight beam temporarily blinded him, lifting his hand in a shield to search the scene, bile rising in his throat as he anticipated the shot.
John shrugged against what he now thought was probably the
Not sure if he trusted water ‘resistant’ to protect his electronics, Sherlock lifted the bag from his shoulder, leaning it against his calf as he stripped off his coat, and then tossed the book bag back over his arm, putting the coat on overtop to better protect the precious cargo. Doing up the buttons, he took a deep breath, looking determinedly down the road before breaking out into the storm, turning his collar up in vain against the pounding deluge.
comfort him.
There was a sniff John took as affirmation, or at least indifference, and twisted the handle on the door, gently pushing it open as he peered his head around.
John’s knees nearly faltered in relief. “So no one would know who you were.”
“No, I-I didn’t mean- That’s what I do,” he muttered in a rush, turning his hands in the air. “My-My job. Well, not my
“We can talk more about it tomorrow,” he assured, and Sherlock smiled, exhaustion coming up suddenly now that he gave it permission.
“And that bothered you?”
“No,” he said, looking at the menu over John’s head, “she’ll be even more insufferable without her caffeine. I’ll just have a large light roast, black with two sugars.”
“John, I-”
John turned to where Sherlock had appeared at his left, frowning between the two of them with an increasingly wary expression, and John might have explained had his eyes not taken the liberty of scanning the man’s thin burgundy jumper and trim dark jeans, the image instantly paralyzing his tongue.
He could
Victor laughed, but it was a high, anxious sound. “Come on, Sherls,” he urged, wincing slightly as his wrist struggled in vain within Sherlock’s grip. “I’ll even give you a taste. On the house.”

Moran nodded, turning on his heels and flashing a glare at square-skull as he passed, and the man wisely took a step back. “Oh, sir?” he asked, twisting back, and the suited man halted, turning and tilting his head in eerily polite inquiry. “What should I do with the file?”
Sherlock tilted his head.
Mycroft paused halfway through leaning his umbrella against the wall. “Good point,” he murmured, and Sherlock’s eyes nearly popped out of his head, not sure the universe could handle an implied ‘I love you’
suggested), it was impossible for Michael Parker to make it from Claire Jones’ flat to his office in the time between the call to the police and his meeting, Sherlock was still uneasy about the situation. They hadn’t talked about it, and he was certainly not going to be the one to bring it up, but he was fairly certain of what he’d seen in John’s eyes in that fitting room. He’d spent the better part of the night awake, trying to figure out if he were merely inventing what he wanted to see, but had finally come to the undeniable, unbelievable conclusion that John had been
John’s stomach clenched, his fingers following as they encircled the strap of his bag. “What about him?” He managed to keep the rising anger out of his voice, enough to fool Donovan, at least.
“We should go,” he murmured, forcing himself to step back, his hand trailing down Sherlock’s chest a ways before it separated completed, his fingers physically aching in dissent. “Before they come down here looking for us.”
I sound like a completely irrational, possessive
Sherlock flopped down onto the bed, lying on his back and breathing deeply as he returned to his thinking posture, decidedly
“You-You can’t,” the brunette futilely contested as John slung an arm over his waist. “I’ll get you sick.”
, if Sherlock hadn’t been pretty sure he was gay before, John Watson arriving at their school two years ago had sealed that deal pretty thoroughly. Fucking rugby shorts.
a library, let alone how to navigate one, but he didn’t think he could be blamed for that.
Absentmindedly, Sherlock shook his head, slowly dragging his hand away from John’s neck. “I-I don’t- I don’t understand.”
“I hate to be the one to break this to you,” John said with mock sincerity, tipping his head as he passed Sherlock, standing between him and the man, “but not everyone wearing a green shirt is going to want to sleep with you. In fact, most of them probably won’t even wanna talk.”
He delayed replying, rushing quickly past the last few shops.
flat after he’d washed it after the last game of the season, but, evidently, Sherlock had had other plans, and now turned to John with a smirk that clearly had several more ideas John wasn’t yet privy to. “Morning,” he chirped, as if he wasn’t the worst person in the entire world, and John narrowed his eyes at him, scanning down the man’s chest as he approached.
article had brought in, they weren’t exactly struggling for clients, but one never knew when their fifteen minutes were up, and having royalty on their resume would open the door to a whole different level of clientele.
!?” John shouted, and Sherlock recoiled, palm planting behind him as he leaned back over the duvet. “You’ve been lying to me for
“Oh, and my cousin, Bethany,” Mrs. Hudson continued, apparently
Sherlock huffed, moving to snag a peppermint from the bowl himself. “Does he know you’re not…masculine-inclined?” he asked, and Irene twitched a shoulder, popping the sweet in her mouth.
on you, Sherlock; I just wanted to keep you safe.”
“You’ve got a VIP in your section,” she said. “Well, not him, his date, but he’s not here yet.”
John frowned, following Sherlock’s gesture, a dim memory sparked in his mind of three men who’d been seated near the pitch, all of them wearing ties and frantically scribbling whenever John caught a glimpse of them as he ran by.
“No, please,” Irene Adler said, tone bored and eyebrow raised as she squinted at them in the light, “don’t shoot.”
“No, it’s fine. Really,” he added, smiling to combat John’s chagrined wince. “He, er… Well, we’d been dating for about six months. I was about to graduate, and he’d just gotten a job offer in America, so he…asked me to go with him.”
He didn’t know how to
“We’re not in it this year. This is Japan and New Zealand.”
“That’s ridiculous,” John snapped, rattling his head as he turned away, and Sherlock shuffled closer across the mattress.
John stopped texting at some point, presumably having gone to sleep, and, shortly after, they arrived at Langley, Sherlock stepping out of the car and away without a word. The officer lingered, however, the headlights passing in at least two circles before Sherlock reached the Kingsley House door, and he cast a glance back as he entered, shooting a glare that was likely lost on the man due to the distance. His steps grew heavier as he drew near the dorm room, exhaustion finally catching up with him, and he had nothing more planned than collapsing onto their now-double bed as he opened the door, flicking on the light before his stomach dropped out.
The crack cut through the night like lightning, the whole world momentarily narrowing down to the spot on John’s left cheek where his mother’s hand came down with a fury only matched by the fire in her eyes.
!” he trumpeted, shaking his head violently. “How did you even- Holding hands!” He laced his two hands together, shaking the conglomerate in the woman’s face. “This is obviously- Where the hell did you get...
“Talk about yourself like that, like you’re some sort of…lost cause?” John replied, his voice closer now.
A man rushed into the room, breaking his line of sight, and Sherlock turned to him, not wanting his eyes to linger too long on what, to everyone else, would simply look like a blank expanse of wallpaper.
“How big of her,” John teased, reentering the living room to drape himself widthwise across his chair. “What did Mycroft go through for again?”
camera?”
He was still standing quite close, apparently sucking all the oxygen out of the air between them, and if Sherlock noticed the flecks of golden brown in the boy’s blue eyes, it was purely scientific.
Just down the corridor was the library in what appeared to be an intentional study in contrasts, bookshelves stacked to the ceiling with everything from ancient leather volumes to tattered paperback romances—“The princess has…particular tastes,” Mrs. Hudson muttered when he squinted at a spine—a Persian rug of muted reds and oranges stretched out beneath a heavy oak desk and soft leather armchairs, the marble fireplace cold in the hearth, but bedecked with sparkling spirals of ribbon and dangling silver snowflakes across the mantel.
John tried not to be affected, but he felt the small stutter of disappointment in his chest. It was stupid of him, he knew it was, but John always started considering what his life would be like with a girl shortly after taking an interest in her. Would their jobs be compatible? Would they be able to make enough money? Where would they live? Would they agree on takeaway? TV shows? It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, but he couldn’t help it any more than he could help that he had wanted to live in London ever since his family’s first trip there when he was nine. But John had never let these little disappointments keep him from seeing where something could go, and Mary was too incredible not to give that chance to.
John glared at him.
sure that it is
John rolled his eyes. Sherlock signing some of his texts at all was odd, but a single word? Was that really necessary? It was probably intended to be a dismissal, but his question had been left unanswered.
“Hey.”
“Huh,” Sherlock hummed, squinting toward the board. “I would have felt much less ridiculous ordering that.”
“Are you okay?” John had asked, tilting his head with a frown as Sherlock looked up at him, and, though Sherlock would never say he skittered back, that didn’t mean it wasn’t true.
John laughed, a brief endeavor, considering how much the shaking hurt his head.
Sherlock smiled, a soft huff of laughter pushing through his teeth as he looked down at his shoes.
“400 pounds!?” John spouted, fork clattering on the edge of his plate as he dropped it. “Jesus! Can I dump him and take odds on tomorrow?”
The blond looked up at him, a soft sound that maybe one day hoped it would grow up to be a word drifting out of his throat before he looked away again, eyes moving further down the storefront.
Sherlock shook his head, slow and grave. “You have a leak. Someone here at the Yard.”
“Well, if she’s attractive, and he’s
“Oh, no,” Jeanette said, a smile on her face but a subtle wistfulness in her eyes. “I went for political science.”
“Yes,” he admitted frailly, and Sherlock blinked, surprised to hear it even though he’d already known. “I was going to tell you,” John insisted, lifting his hands in pleading. “Really, I was, I just- Well, I didn’t know what to do! You were gone that week, and I thought you’d be gone forever, and then, when you came back… I thought it might get you to stay around.”
His grip tightened around the vial, obscuring the liquid from view with his white-splotched fingers. Blue eyes formed in his head, shattered with surprise and hardened with disappointment.
In spite of this focus, John still jumped when the toast popped, his head flinging back in alarm before he cleared his throat, the blush reigniting in his cheeks as he wriggled the bread free with his fingertips. “Do you, er…” he murmured, flapping the warm bread at him in offering, but Sherlock shook his head, prompting John to nod and drop the slice onto his own plate. He hesitated then, shifting his weight between his feet as he looked between the living room and the seat opposite Sherlock at the table, his fingers twitching in and out of fists at his side. “I don’t have to- I mean, if you’d rather I didn’t- I can go somewhere else,” he offered, waving vaguely toward the living room. “The other table, or-or upstairs.”
“It’s 4am,” he snipped, and John shrugged.
“It is
The men blinked at him a moment, and then rushed forward, eager smiles on their faces as Sherlock moved into the room.
John stared at his friend, suddenly so small and fragile in front of him, grey eyes darting everywhere but John’s face. “Okay,” John answered softly, nodding as Sherlock lifted his head. “Okay.”
“No, you’re not,” John said, not angry or argumentative, just sure.
approached
John shook his head, smirking at his roommate’s retreating back for a moment before hurrying after him, resolving that, if Sherlock wasn’t going to slow down, he’d just have to learn to keep up.
“Oh my god,” John wheezed, lifting one of his hands to wipe his thumb under his eye, Sherlock’s hand carried limply along with it. “That was adorable!”
The swan ruffled its feathers, turning its head around to peck at a spot on its back, but nothing more, and Sherlock sighed, leaning his skull against the bark of the tree as he peered up into the canopy.
fic, or is it more one shot material? Is that something you guys would even want or...? Yeah, just thoughts, give me your thoughts.
“Livin’ the dream,” Molly mused, looking wistfully off into the distance, and then giggling as she peeked back at John’s flat expression out of the corner of her eye. “I should go,” she said, turning toward the door, and John walked out around the counter to follow her. “Gotta get something to eat before my shift,” she added, and John whined, shoulders wilting in desperate longing at the thought of food. Molly chuckled, shaking her head fondly at him as she lightly gripped his shoulder in condolence. “Only two more hours,” she probably intended to encourage, but John only groaned, the girl rolling her eyes at his pain as she pulled open the door. “I’ll see you Tuesday,” she said, stepping halfway out onto the pavement, “but I’d better hear from you before then! I want to know
!” he mocked, grinning at Sherlock’s glare. He then leaned forward, swatting across Sherlock’s knee “Come on, tell me,” he cajoled, but Sherlock only shrugged.
Sherlock watched out of the corner of his eye as John blinked again and again, his eyes searching the faces of his teammates for the confirmation he could not read the signs of.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, not entirely sure why he was being provided this information.
“Do you want-” John blurted overtop of him, thumping down a step to see around the wall between them, both of them stopping to blink at one another before dropping their chins with shy puffs of laughter. “Well then,” John murmured, lifting his eyes, the timid smile illuminated in the soft yellow light of the staircase knocking Sherlock breathless, “your place or mine?” A corner of his lips twitched higher, reassurance of the jest, and Sherlock looked back over his shoulder, considering a moment before pulling the door shut behind him.
Not that anyone was required to say much of anything in the presence of Lord Chaplin, who interrupted at every possible turn to regale them with anecdotes of Jeanette’s accomplishments while she dropped her gaze to shift penne around her plate. All fathers were proud of their daughters, Sherlock supposed, but most managed to brag without sounding like they were hawking prized cattle, the conversation somehow becoming a medical history as the entree plates were cleared away.
“Average,” Sherlock finished, nodding thoughtfully. “Well,” he clipped, thrusting his hands in his pockets as he looked up at the sergeant, “we’ll just see about that.” With a flash of a smirk, he moved to push around Lestrade to the door, but John’s voice stopped him short.
“Well-” John started, feeling like the last thing the violent spasms in his stomach needed was alcohol, but it might help with the rivers of cold that kept shuddering over his shoulders and down his arms.
Sherlock rattled his head, pulling in a ragged gasp of air. “I-I can’t,” he nearly whimpered. “I can’t- I-I don’t- John-”
“And that singing telegram that interrupted English?” Mary continued, eyes wide with incredulity. “They’ve been all over the school today.”
“Okay,” Sherlock sighed, lowering his phone and turning back. “The local precinct is sending over a car to take us to the Yard. They’ll be here in about 15 minutes. Can you pack up while I go wake Coach?”
He opened the back door just a crack at first, peering side-to-side, and then quickly jumped out, closing it softly behind him before making a beeline for the pavement.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but didn’t reply, a denial more embarrassing than his fright at this point.
“He was back ‘round the corner,” John continued, addressing Dimmock, Sherlock’s face too difficult to watch any longer. “Rob- Moran wouldn’t have been able to see him, and it was quite dark.”
“You knew they knew!” he blustered, and Sherlock sucked his lips guiltily over his teeth. “And you just-just
He couldn’t pick which expression was his favorite, Sherlock’s incredulity or Irene’s begrudging respect. He smirked over his chicken, popping a plastic fork from the cutlery packet with a quick smash against his thigh.
to get out, and, though he would’ve expected that to terrify him a few short months ago, he’d actually never looked forward to anything more.
Also,
“I’m not calling him.”
“Later,” he assured, peering up through his lashes as he nodded, and John brought the sun out with his smile, dropping a nod before turning and heading toward a side door.
As promised,
The woman blinked between them, her face furrowed with a perplexed frown. “How-” she stammered, “How do you eat an orange with the peel still on?”
Irene gave him a pitying look. “Moran stole the Carl Powers file. The first case Sherlock ever
“What rank?”
“Mrs. Hudson has some pictures she wants to hang later,” he said, delicately balancing his toast on the edge of his plate. “Wanted your help with it. Apparently, her level’s faulty.”
“He just gave me a ride,” he murmured, his whole body hot with shame as he felt John’s eyes on the side of his face.
“Of course,” Jeanette said, waving her hand at the device, everyone else shrugging and nodding in response. “Saves me the trouble of trying to read upside-down,” she teased, and Sherlock chuckled, pressing the red button on the recorder and clearing his throat again.
“Probably not,” she answered, shaking her head as her eyes dropped back to him, “but bring up a few just in case. Don’t want people whining for coffee again.”
you!?” Donovan shrieked, dropping the files she’d been carrying to the floor in a fluttering heap as she turned to glare at Anderson.
what I-”
John frowned, looking to him, but Sherlock didn’t have any answers either, shaking his head minutely. “The...weather delay?” John ventured, and Mrs. Holmes nodded, oblivious to their confusion.
weren’t, anyway—it was- It was me.”
‘The hell with Mycroft!’ she’d barked, the owner of the name making a hasty and silent retreat down the steps at her back. ‘I’m asking
Sherlock grinned. “He’s a psychopath.”
What did one say to the possible psychopathic stalker who had sent them a doctored box of conversation hearts?
“Oh, you’re an artist?” he asked, though he already knew, but it would stifle the conversation somewhat to let on he had read her entire life’s story before leaving the castle that morning.
! Just how much was John going to find out had been a lie, because he was going to find out, starting with where the
“She can stay as long as she needs,” Sherlock supplied, but John shook his head, turning to sit back on the edge of the desk, his arms crossing.
“I could hardly look worse,” Sherlock retorted, eyes sparking, and Mycroft’s gaze flinched away, a swallow moving down his throat as his fingers tightened on the handle of his umbrella.
“You’re not going to, then?” John asked, tilting his head up at Sherlock’s coffee curls.
“That’s a lot of fancy words for
“Oh, Sherlock!” he called, stopping just before he reached the edge of the stands.
“No problem. See ya around,” he signed off cheerfully, and was gone with a muffled click.
“Oh, er, Angelo, this is Sherlock,” John interceded, Sherlock giving a nod while Angelo grinned. “He’s, er…a friend,” he finished stiltedly, Sherlock lifting an amused brow while John suddenly became fascinated by the tablecloth.
“Wow, that was terrible,” he muttered, eyebrows knitting together. “You must really be sick if your lies are
“I guess I’m just tired,” he muttered down at his knees, and John temporarily abandoned his hair to stare at the man through the glass door.
After taking a moment to steady himself, leaning his skull back against the wall as he closed his eyes and blew out a breath to the ceiling, he pushed upright, striding confidently around the corner to the dining room to carry valiantly on. Except, it seemed, the battle was over, at least for him, Sherlock sitting alone at the table, pinching at the bridge of his nose with his fingertips.
“Greg, John. Greg,” Lestrade corrected.
“Weren’t you supposed to go on some sort of tour to get that information?” Sherlock answered, the teasing glint in his eyes the only thing keeping it from being condescending.
“They dragged me out to a car,” John said, rolling his shoulder at the memory, the indignity still stinging a bit. “Threw me in the back and told me to stay down. We were a couple minutes away when-” He stopped, eyes dropping to the carpet as he forced a swallow through his tightening throat.
“John, I really-”
“Hey?” John called softly, twisting around in his chair.
Sherlock’s breath hitched, John unable to look up to see the matching facial expression, but he didn’t yank his hand away—or punch him with it—and, emboldened by that small success, John continued, skating the pad of his thumb in a line down the pale skin.
“Doesn’t Mrs. Hudson live somewhere in London?” John questioned rhetorically. “I’m sure she’d like to see you. And we have to get those books from her anyway.”
“My grandmother’s dead.”
When he was a child and still had a family to come into London with, he would always insist on stopping by Regent’s Park to feed the swans. Although, truth be told, he was mostly concerned with one swan in particular, a small cygnet he had named Harold for some reason he could no longer remember.
about!?” Sherlock spluttered, rushing up to John’s side before he could make his escape into the back. “I don’t want Victor to come to the show!”
“By having a lot more money,” Lestrade supplied, John tipping his head at the point as Lestrade passed back the card. “I’ll need your driver’s license too,” he said, and John nodded, placing the thin plastic on the table for the man to copy from.
as opposed to what they posit wanting. They may rate qualities associated with submissiveness and compassion as very desirable in a partner, but if, upon meeting them, I discover they have a…strong personality,” he muttered, polite but pointed, a small chuckle rippling through the room, “I know they need a partner who will challenge them in kind. Anything less would ultimately prove unfulfilling to both parties.”
“They have another tutoring session this afternoon at Lindsey’s,” Molly continued animatedly, practically bouncing in her seat, and John smiled, her excitement contagious. “He’s totally gonna ask you out. Why else would he want to meet up
John twisted up to him, startled, a million possible meanings running through his head, but Sherlock was giving nothing away, looking back at him with a smile touched with nerves around the edges.
“That’s-That’s The Eye!” he gushed, pointing out across the water. “And-And St. Paul’s! And is that- Holy shit, that’s Big Ben!” he added, turning and moving a few feet back toward the door as he pointed out along the bank to their right. “This-This is
He didn’t feel anything. Nothing apart from guilt over not being able to feel anything, but, still, he’d
“Not hungry,” Sherlock murmured, pulling away from his microscope to jot a note down in a book to his left.
?” he drawled, and Harry wrinkled her nose at him.
“I love you,” John blurted, and Sherlock’s far away figure visibly shrank with shock, as if every muscle in his body had gone slack. “I love you, and-and I have to go,” he rushed, the two women within mere meters of the door now, and he turned away, hurrying back behind the counter as Sherlock’s protests blared from the speaker.
“Hot apple cider! I know those fingerless gloves aren’t cuttin’ it!”
“So, what’s the case you’re working on?” John asked, following as Sherlock crossed to the dormitory.
“No need,” Sherlock muttered with a quick rattle of his head. “It’s only logical.”
John’s forehead furrowed, his stupid lips turning down in a stupid frown. “Did I…
“No,” John clipped, rattling his head, but Sherlock lifted a skeptical brow. John dropped his eyes, scratching lightly at the side of his neck. “We-We just wore nice stuff,” he muttered, shrugging a shoulder. “Black trousers and shoes. White button-downs. Bowties.”
“The owner was about 30, made it big with some internet startup, I think; I wasn’t really listening,” she muttered, dismissing it with a flick of her fingers. “But people like that tend to like throwing their money around, so, I followed him. He was
“Sebastian,” he said, swallowing down the anger that flared acrid up his throat. “I saw him coming out of our dorm when I got here.”
“We don’t have any new clients scheduled before Christmas, and everything’s pretty much planned for the holiday mixers. Irene can handle anything else that comes up.”
. When I was 9, my father took me into the garden and told me it was about time I learned how to defend myself like a ‘proper soldier’” He curled his fingers around the words as he said them, smile holding fast while Sebastian’s collapsed. “He was ex-army, you see. Special Ops. One of those ‘The enemy is everywhere!’ types, ya know?” He dropped his head like he and Sebastian were sharing a grand secret, and the man paled. “So, three days later, I could fire a gun, had my own set of knives, a fairly impressive hand-to-hand repertoire—if I do say so myself—and a rather detailed diagram on how to snap someone’s neck.”
“Come on, before it gets cold,” she urged, and then disappeared around the doorframe, her footsteps thumping down the stairs a moment later.
“Go to sleep.”
Twin snorts answered.
“Then-Then why-”
…before Christmas?”
Sherlock started, but held the fabric in place at his shoulder instinctively regardless. He twisted back to look at John, who was already resituating himself on his back. “Won’t you be cold now?” he asked, expression a little lost, his fingers tightening at the collar of the jacket.
“They stopped coming when father got sick,” Sherlock said, rather abruptly, as if he didn’t trust himself to get it out if he waited, and John froze, watching him as he stared out the window. “And then, after he died,” he continued, sounding rather removed, “mother didn’t see the point anymore, I suppose. She died three years later. Pneumonia, officially.”
“No,” he breathed over a long-suffering sigh. “We danced a little at some wedding or other a few years ago.”
“Series finales of
Sherlock stared down at the message, not quite sure how to respond, or if he even wanted to. He probably would have to explain to John at some point why Molly’s behavior had changed, but he hadn’t composed a reasonable explanation yet, and he couldn’t exactly tell the truth. There was only one option, then: defensive haughtiness.
John scoffed, rolling his eyes, and then went back to fussing with his collar. “A brothel. A
“Yours,” Sherlock chirped, grinning as he held the jumper aside by the shoulders, the colors the mirror of his own—red through the body, the pattern navy and white.
. I-I didn’t understand. I couldn’t fathom what would drive people to such ridiculous lengths. I mean, it was just hormones, scientifically speaking. Surely another person being involved didn’t change anything. So, I- Well…”
“Your plus one is here, sir,” he said, or seemed to say, his mouth shaping the sounds Sherlock’s brain interpreted as those impossible words.
“I can’t go, I’m sick,” Sherlock muttered, burrowing back into the book, leaving John to glare at a faded midnight-blue cover.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
?! Sorry, I-I’m sorry,” he muttered, a hand darting out to grasp Sherlock’s arm through the blanket as his rage momentarily boiled.
Sherlock dared move closer, slipping his hands out of his pockets to twist at his fingers, but stopped when John did, though he was still meters away.
“Still here,” Sherlock replied, prompting a frustrated sigh.
“No, it’s-it’s fine,” John stammered around his coughs, clearing his windpipe of citrus-flavored beverage. “So…how have you been?” he asked somewhat awkwardly, plucking at the tab on the top of his can. He hadn’t talked to Mary much the past week outside of classes, too preoccupied with making sure Sherlock didn’t burn the school down, and he suddenly felt shy with guilt.
And if he could do that, if he could sit two floors away and make Sherlock think he had to live without him, and that didn’t tear him
“I’m not avoiding you,” Sherlock argued, and John huffed a mirthless laugh.
Everyone had said it was a beautiful service, and he supposed it had been by the typical standard, but Sherlock had found the bright colors of the innumerable flower arrangements jarring, artificially lurid against the barren December backdrop of the cemetery.
