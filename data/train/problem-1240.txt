“God, John,” Sherlock’s pained voice cut through the haze of savage lust and made John release his flesh in sudden clarity. Shocked by his own loss of control, he stared at Sherlock’s neck. A bright purple bruise emblazoned the snowy skin, framed by the imprints of his teeth. What kind of randy teenage-nonsense was he doing here? He was usually a very considerate lover; enjoying himself but in a disciplined, measured way, more intent on pleasing his lovers than himself. These carnal instincts had been a part of him, well-guarded and never fully explored, but nothing had ever kicked them into such a high gear as the detective trembling under his touch. How could he let them take over like this, especially with a partner as inexperienced and vulnerable as Sherlock? Why did he always have to hurt him? Shame prickled in John’s veins as he watched Sherlock bring up one hand to his neck, brushing over the sore spot with an incredulous look.
“But you still pretend that nothing between us has changed. We spend every day together, sleep in the same bed every night, we
Their eyes, still locked on each other, widened in synchronized overwhelming sensation. Inch after inch John let himself sink into Sherlock, the tightness absolutely world-shattering. Sherlock’s hot skin beneath his fingers seemed to vibrate with the effort to stay relaxed, to take John in, all of him. An anxious hand felt for John’s and held on to it in an almost painful grasp.
Sherlock swallowed hard and gave John a clueless or maybe panicked look, no words coming to his aid. Yes, what exactly did he have in mind?
Sherlock listened to the song three more times, still not quite sure if he was to believe his ears. When the cabbie finally pulled up in front of 221B with an indignant comment about music, Sherlock handed him a few pound notes, apparently giving a more than generous tip going by the sudden change in the cabbie’s demeanour. Twenty pounds or two thousand—Sherlock couldn’t care less.
When he has put the kettle on and returns to the sitting room, John is still standing near the door. His shoulders have slumped. “I just thought you would call if anything interesting came up,” he says and the disappointment in his voice crushes Sherlock.
He feels nauseous. And he prays that after today, Sherlock sticks to something as harmless as a cigarette.
He could hear Sherlock’s eyes roll next to him but the mention of his job was an unerring manoeuvre. It didn’t fail him on Kristen, either. The smile finally returned to her face.
Sherlock was about to snap at her for her lack of understanding the incredible seriousness of the situation but then decided there were more pressing issues to address. He quickly shooed Mrs. Hudson upstairs to grab Rosie from her crib and get her to the safety of her own flat before the little girl could get in contact with him or John. Fear and concern still fogged his mind as he paced up and down the sitting room, waiting for Mrs. Hudson to bring Rosie down.
At first, John was utterly horrified when his daughter for the first time expressed interest for something as far removed from science as possible, especially fearing that Sherlock might make some snarky comments about romantized and outdated gender roles, but, to John’s surprise and amusement, he has supported Rosie in her royal extravaganza with as much enthusiasm and diligence as he usually displays on a crime scene. He even convinced Mycroft to buy her a yellow gown—“Just like Belle’s! Thank you, Uncle Myc”—for her birthday. John has never seen anything funnier than Mycroft Holmes, the personification of the British Government, bowing to her majesty Rosie the First and graciously accepting her invitation to tea.
Sherlock glared at her and continued his endeavours to demolish the content of his kitchen cupboards. At every broken piece, Mrs. Hudson flinched but only slowly retreated to the door.
At the sight, John’s heart hit the ground, a heavy thud muffled by the carpet. With the force of a million missed opportunities, pent-up for far too long and now finally breaking loose, he cried: “Because I love you, Sherlock. In every way possible. In every way one person can love another and a thousand ways more. I love you so much that it scares me to death, that it shakes me to my core. I am terrified. But, God, I love you and I don’t want anyone else to raise Rosie with me. You two are the only family I will ever need.”
“Does she though? Sometimes I get the impression that I’m the one spending least time with her, with work and cases and everything,” John replied, voicing something that aggrieved his conscience for a while now.
For those of you who recognize the song from the OST of Love, Actually: There is a chapter coming up featuring that Christmas favourite of mine :)
John let himself drop to his back and ran a hand through his hair, trying to detain his arousal. This was… shit, to say the least. After the rocky road they had already travelled to get here, such a trivial problem should be the last thing to thwart them. It just wasn’t fair. Or maybe something was wrong. And this wasn’t meant to be.
There was nothing left, not even tears. Everything was gone. Sherlock stormed outside and let the door snap closed behind him. The air was freezing now, attacking every inch of bare skin with needles as his legs carried him down Baker Street with no conscious destination. Yet, Sherlock didn’t even bother to button his coat. What was the point? Pain was all he was able to perceive at this point. It didn’t really matter whether it was mental or physical, did it? Pain remained pain.
“He is really not in the condition to see anyone right now,” Mycroft reiterated, lowering his voice and head in an air of accusatory rigidness. “You promised me to look after him.”
He turns back to John, his mouth slightly agape. In his head, a thought manifests, too hopeful and too ridiculous to exist.
And, yet, he knows he shouldn’t be this worried. They’re both in their thirties, they’re married, they’re financially stable. There is no reason to have this giant weight on his chest whenever his thoughts cross the subject.
Going by the wagonload of gifts that are, for the time being, occupying their sofa, the coffee table, and half the sitting room floor, there are quite a few new things added to their household.
John let go of his wrists, instead taking Sherlock’s face into his hands, brushing his unruly hair back and placing gentle kisses on his flushed cheeks. His voice came out hoarse and breathy: “Would you like to… you know, top? Since it’s your first time and it’s probably… more fun.”
He didn’t want to face John now, not while he was still fighting the urge to throw a jealous fit, so he kept perfectly still. He heard John click his tongue in slight irritation as Sherlock didn’t respond or bother to shift his long, slender body to make room on the sofa for him before he finally placed Sherlock’s cup on the coffee table and retreated to his own armchair. John picked up something to read—
John turns on the spot, an animal rampaging in its cage. “I’m still coming to terms with all of this, alright?! Do you know how shocked I was when I heard you sing that song? I had to see your face to know if it was true!”
—he hated it. Between solving cases with Sherlock, taking care of Rosie, and working here he had barely time to eat or shower, let alone sleep for a decent amount of time. He sighed in exhaustion as he opened the last of the patients’ files he had to update and rubbed his tired eyes. When John finally locked the door to the clinic behind him, it was almost 11 pm. He sent a quick text to Sherlock:
The confession stirred up something in Sherlock that had, until now, only lazily bobbled in his head. “Did Jason give any reason why he started stealing in the first place?” he chimed in, leaning forward in his seat. “He wasn’t exactly destitute, was he? Why steal something you could probably just ask your parents for?”
Still, he is definitely not ready to face John like this, unprepared and vulnerable. He needs to get him to leave, to come back when his thoughts aren’t a tangled mess anymore.
Sherlock met his gaze with those incredibly iridescent eyes, the expression on his face almost unbearably soft. John reached out to him and pulled him and Rosie closer until they all stood right beneath the boughs. He looked up to Sherlock and then the little plant, hanging so heavy with meaning. Then, he smiled apologetically and placed a loving kiss on Rosie’s forehead. Sherlock’s lips perked up in a satisfied grin before he followed suit and placed his on Rosie’s cheek. The little girl giggled happily, knowing she was so loved by both.
It’s quintessential Sherlock to have left the wedding, without saying goodbye, without a sign of life. He had gotten it over with and vanished at the very first opportunity.
Sherlock lets his gaze roam over the beloved face now, all pain it causes aside. “We don’t though. We never do that,” he states. Something weird is going on with John. Sherlock can’t place his expression.
For a few seconds stretching like chewing gum their eyes fire at each other. Greg orders his body to shove the damn folder into Sherlock’s arms and just leave, but either the pints or his conscience override every command.
Before Sherlock could object any further, John grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. Somehow, those drinks John had offered him continuously all night seemed to heighten Sherlock’s touch perception even further. From where John’s fingers were wrapped around his own, a tingling made his way across his skin in electric waves. Sherlock wobbled a little with the thrilling sensation but John seemed to ascribe it to his level of intoxication and steadied him by putting his arm around Sherlock’s waist. That didn’t exactly help.
“Oh no,” Sherlock’s voice pierced the air, his alarmed tone jerking John to a halt. He anticipated a revelation about a case or even a masked figure jumping out of the bushes, ready to attack them.
And they were back in Baker Street, behind closed curtains, a sweet violin tune playing. John’s brows were now slightly puckered in concentration while the alcohol gently clouded his eyes. He had insisted on them having a drink to loosen them up a little and reduce the awkwardness of the situation. Sherlock laid his hand in Mind-John’s and desperately recalled the sensation of the other man’s fingers resting on his waist as they moved through the waltz. On the last few notes, John bent him back, Sherlock’s weight not troubling his strong arms. His face hovering over Sherlock’s displayed equal parts of pride and bashfulness.
He was content to just bath in John’s radiance every day, to soak up his warmth, and fight the demons of his past on his own. As long as John was by his side, Sherlock knew that he would emerge victorious.
“You just have to read John’s blog to realise: They’re old-fashioned heroes, living their own modern fairy tale, full of dragons to slay and mysteries to solve. Everyone can see that they make the perfect team, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. And for a while, these two were stumbling from one adventure to the next, always on the brink of tragedy. Old-fashioned heroes face old-fashioned villains in varicoloured disguises and everyone who has ever read a fairy tale knows that heroes are forged by danger, by failure, and by sacrifice. But now that their tale finally has its happy ending I can relate the whole story, the real story to you all. And it begins with a best man speech…”
With every passing minute he wonders when he has become such a whiny, pathetic cliché. If he starts watching cheesy movies and eating ice cream straight out of the tub, he should really consult a therapist. Or a caricaturist.
“Sherlock—,“ warned John, cocking his head and glaring at him from under his brows, but the younger man could not keep the words fuelled by his own discontent and anger from bursting out in a fiery stream.
John licked his lips and took a deep breath, readying himself for his final words: “I am bisexual. And I am in love with the most brilliant man to ever walk this earth.”
Slowly, he felt his nervous energy trickle away. The sting in his chest, however, didn’t vanish but softened to the numb dragging pain right below his sternum Sherlock was already all too familiar with. He sensed a sad smile flicker over his lips as he realized how omnipresent this sensation had been throughout the years of silent pining. The familiarity was oddly reassuring. This pain he knew, this pain he could manage.
“Oh.” Sherlock sat back in his chair. And he had thought that this whole situation couldn’t get any worse. “How?”
John raised his eyes and hands to Sherlock’s face, forcing him to acknowledge the complete absurdity of his utterance: “No. Don’t you dare say that. They’re a part of you and nothing about you could ever be anything short of perfect.”
“I’ve had it up to here with your secretiveness,” he barked, the sinews on his neck visibly tightening. “I am still in charge here, Sherlock. I am responsible. Haven’t I earned your trust by now or what kind of shit is this? When will you finally stop going rogue under my supervision?”
When they each lay in their respective bed—although Sherlock’s rearrangement of the furniture had rendered the distinction between them futile—John checked his phone for messages from Molly or Mrs. Hudson. He felt a sting of guilt because he hadn’t managed to call at a reasonable hour to ask about Rosie. Hopefully, she was still too young to remember that he abandoned her occasionally.
“You—can—go—harder—John,“ Sherlock pressed out between groans, pushing his heels into John’s back. “Give—me—all—you—got—Captain.”
With embarrassingly shaking fingers, he grabbed the phone. When was the last time he had shown such a ridiculously emotional response to the chance of rejection? He had dealt with it his entire life; people being repelled by him, people telling him to piss off. Why did it hurt so much more when it came from John? “You
As they lay in bed that night, John on his back and Sherlock carefully sprawled over him to not accidentally touch the sore flesh under his dressing, the nightly world around them seemed a little softer, a little less bleak.
“She always finds a reason,” he said, sat down on the bedside, and looked his friend over carefully. “You alright now?”
Sherlock could see the disappointment on Lestrade’s face as he smiled politely, handed Mr. Rowley his card, and said: “If you think of anything or Cal shows up, please contact me.”
“But what if they’re… what if they’re a problem child? God knows, I was,” Sherlock mused, his voice growing more worried with every word. “What if they didn’t speak or only cried or couldn’t make any friends? What if everyone thought they were a freak, just like their father? Why would you want to risk having a child like this?”
After what had only felt like seconds, John woke all of a sudden with his heart pounding heavily and an unsettling sense of danger tingling in his chest. His foggy brain scanned the room for possible attackers. This kind of nightly disturbances had haunted him since he had returned from Afghanistan and only worsened over the past few years after Sherlock’s suicide. The only period in which he had not regularly been overwhelmed by terrifying nightmares had been here at Baker Street. But since then, John thought, he had at least always known what brutal images had chased off his sleep because they had usually burned themselves into his retinas and tormented him even with open eyes.
Just in time for Rosie’s afternoon playtime, both of them were on their feet again. Mrs. Hudson had won through and cooked them a lovely meal. Only when the delicious smell of roasted meat and vegetables had floated up the staircase, John had realised how ravenous he was. Sherlock must’ve felt the same since he emptied his plate without a single word of complaint. He even did the dishes while John sat on the floor and played with Rosie. Being shot did have upsides then.
Greg looks at the list. John’s positive traits fill two pages in tiny, neat handwriting. The other page, the one with the anecdotes, looks rather bleak in comparison. “‘
Sherlock had glared at him, his grey-blue eyes narrowed. “Fine,” he had finally said, slightly digging his front teeth into his plush lower lip while dragging out the f-sound. John caught himself staring at that damn mouth a little longer than necessary and quickly buried his gaze in the drink menu.
“No, it’s alright. You know, I’m not good at this stuff but… honesty.” John wet his lips and lowered his gaze for a moment, giving himself a decisive nod before starting to tell a story he had kept disclosed in his heart for the past decades, its sharp edges hardly abraded by time and whiskey: “My Mom… She was brilliant, an amazing woman: loving and kind and funny. Terribly stubborn though. My Dad was working construction when they met and her folks didn’t deem that good enough for her. But she broke with her family and married him anyway. That’s just who she was. They had Harry and then me, and we were a happy little family in a small terraced house. And I played in the street or in one of the gardens with Harry and my friends and when we’d come home we’d have dinner together, the four of us. And Dad would tell bad jokes and Mom would laugh—such a light, clear sound—and kiss us good-night and sometimes dance with us in the living room… I loved her so much. She passed when I was twelve. Breast cancer.”
On one of these yellow brick roads, Greg, John, and Sherlock came balancing over to the crime scene. Their destination, shielded by a curtain of tarp, didn’t hold any grandeur or wonder though. It was just a bit of muddy ground behind a garden shed, a rather dismal place to die. Sherlock swallowed against an unfamiliar lump in his throat.
He shoves the disc back into the envelope and buries it under his ugly Christmas socks at the very back of his sock drawer.
No, nothing in his face proclaims that he is married now. Or that he is only months away from becoming a father.
The plane lifts off the ground and John leans back in his seat. It’s a wonder they’re able to take off with all the extra weight of his thoughts pulling on him. He tries to shove them up into the luggage compartment but as soon as he loosens his grip they fall back onto his head.
Only when he reaches the door and fumbles for his keys, John’s frozen fingers realise that there is something in his pocket that hasn’t been there before.
. Sherlock drew in a harsh breath and John came up to his face again, cupping it with loyal hands. He found the pale irises fogged up with a layer of tears.
On the other side, Mary yawps and stretches. “The next few days,” she says as she rises, “I’ll do nothing but eat, drink, lie in the sun, and get pampered.”
“How did she end up at the Yard? And why didn’t Rutherford inform her parents? If it really is Laney,” John said, cocking his head suggestively.
Sherlock raised his brows in playful contemplation. “I wouldn’t put it past their level of incompetence to miss those crucial clues. They usually do.”
In the all-cloaking darkness, John’s soft voice, already muffled by imminent sleep, floated to his ear: “It’s nice when you’re being kind, Sherlock. Just took me by surprise a little, I guess. But I like it.”
They got up from the sofa, carefully avoiding any kind of contact lest they ignite this special fire smoldering between them again. “I’ll take care of Rosie,” Sherlock said, sounding almost convincingly casual.
At the mention of his late wife’s name, John felt a lump grow in his throat. They didn’t exactly avoid it but, in everyday conversation, she just didn’t come up that often. Come to think of it, that wasn’t what a grieving widower was supposed to do, was it?
As he lies next to her in the dark, he is certain that, within three days, he has managed to become the most despicable person on the planet.
“We could take Rosie, if you want to get rid of her,” Molly suggested in the rather awkward silence, setting down the champagne bottle and scrunching her face at her less than ideal choice of words. Her eyes flickered to Greg whose smile deepened even more. “I mean, if you want a night alone. I’ve barely spent time with her since you moved back in together. I’m beginning to feel like a horrible godmother. And you obviously need—”
“But if you go downstairs you’ll have to put on more clothes and I would really have things rather go in the opposite direction,” Sherlock murmured against John’s temple and tugged at the tight t-shirt that had already exposed several inches of his lower abdomen and back.
The rest of the evening was spent in relative quietude while both men dwelled on their own thoughts. At half past ten, John got up and made his way to the bath- and then the bedroom. Sherlock gave him the usual ten-minute head start before he followed suit. As he entered the bedroom,
Being close to John had always been demanding for Sherlock, a challenge for his mind and body alike. Bearing his touch—ever too faint, too little, too platonic—was torture and yet something Sherlock wouldn’t renounce for all in the world. Too delicious were the surges of electricity that set his nerves alight wherever John’s body bordered on his. But now, there was a new meaning, a new depth in those formerly innocent brushes of limbs against limbs, skin against skin. And Sherlock wasn’t sure how he could ever handle that. His whole body already quivered with heat and an uncomfortable lightness that made him worry about fainting again. That couldn’t happen. Once had already entailed a level of embarrassment sufficient for the next decade or two.
“Yes, obviously, two days ago. Did you only notice just now?” Sherlock replied with an amazed chuckle, not sounding the slightest bit embarrassed upon John’s enquiry.
He thanked fate that Sherlock was asleep and couldn’t observe potential signs of his inner turmoil. The case justified a fair amount of emotional distress, he thought, but John would rather Sherlock didn’t have to wonder at all.
This chapter features past abuse and drug usage (nothing explicit or graphic) as well as suicidal thoughts: If any of this triggers you, please take reasonable precautions before reading :)
“We’ll have the Panna Cotta with two spoons, please,” John told the waiter nonetheless and, upon Sherlock’s mouth opening to form an objection, he added: “You love Angelo’s Panna Cotta. I can’t let you go home without having it. It’s not getting wasted. I’ll eat anything you don’t, alright?”
Everything looked exactly the same as they entered Angelo’s—and still, all was changed. The tables, the bar, the walls—everything was warmer and brighter and full of promise. Or maybe it was just the way John shone, how his weary face was glowing from deep within, illuminating, radiating. Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off of him. He had been so wrong. John wasn’t simply his conductor—he was light himself, his fixed star, his sun: the centre of his universe.
They are both sitting in their chairs, a fire happily crackling beside them, filling the flat with dancing, golden light. Rosie is perched on John’s lap, her little fingers reaching for his face and teacup. John dodges them expertly and bounces the leg she’s on. At the movement, Rosie lets out a high-pitched giggle, her mouth opening in rapture and revealing soft, pink gums. John chuckles and settles his arm more firmly around her, tugging the little girl closely to his chest.
It’s pathetic, to cling to his old life like this. He’s always despised people who reminisced, who refused to let go of whatever grandeur the past had held for them.
“Well, he was pretty drunk,” Greg interjected but a nudge from Molly’s elbow silenced him at once. Sherlock lowered his eyes back to his empty cup, lips pursed in embarrassment.
The movie headed towards its emotional climax and Sherlock tried hard not to show the realization the story evoked in him. There were so many kinds of love, not only romantic: between parents and their children, between friends, between siblings (although that one was tricky; Sherlock could write a book about it… or a whole library full of them). And every kind of love was valid and good and precious. That was a beautiful thought, a reassuring one. Because he no longer needed to define his feelings for John Watson. It was love, plain and simple.
Sherlock lets his eyes roam between them, relishing in the feeling of belonging amidst these wonderful people, until his gaze falls onto the man next to him.
After a few minutes, John had regained his composure and settled into this new position. What else was he supposed to do? It was not like he didn’t enjoy having Sherlock this close to him. The warmth of Sherlock’s body slowly leaked through his coat right into John’s skin and invigorated him far more than the caffeine possible could. Cautiously, John raised his left hand the few inches he could without waking his friend and placed gentle fingers on Sherlock’s thigh, slowly rubbing his thumb over the smooth fabric of his expensive trousers. Upon the touch, a little pleased sound reminiscent of a purring cat escaped Sherlock’s throat. John’s insides turned a somersault at this endearing noise.
The story—about Alex, about broken promises, about a dark path leading into drugs—that hit John’s ears in dull words now made his mind spin in nauseating circles. His thoughts passed a day, a few weeks ago, when a trembling Sherlock had wept into his shoulder in the neon-lit hall of a Norfolk police precinct. It had resurfaced then, John knew, come up and clawed its way back into Sherlock’s conscious thoughts—this abysmal trauma. He should’ve addressed it. Once more, he had missed the mark—as a doctor, as a friend. And he understood—why Sherlock had taken all the pain for all these years before finally snapping, why he had willingly accepted every beating, every insult, every heartbreak. Because Sherlock was utterly and unbendingly convinced that he deserved nothing more, that abuse masked as selfishly distorted affection was enough, that true love wasn’t meant for him.
His shoulders slumped in defeat as he spoke. He loaded the bananas on the belt a little more forcefully than necessary and pinched the bridge of his nose, pressing his eyes shut against the cold neon light. It was already dark out. They should be home by now, lounging in their chairs or on the sofa, watching something trivial on the telly. But between a particularly gruesome triple murder and flu season at the clinic, neither of them had had time to go out for groceries. With Mrs. Hudson gone to her sister’s, their emergency food supplier had forsaken them as well, leaving their fridge and pantries shamefully empty. They had had no choice.
“Why do we have to have a party again?” Sherlock sighed, lazily perching himself on the sofa’s armrest, fidgeting with a paper. John shuffled over to him and stood between his legs, allowing them to be on eye level.
Lestrade nodded grimly. “Cal broke Beaumont’s gun cabinet open and took one when he left the house. He says he just wanted to threaten his parents to leave Laney alone. But Jason came after him, with the ring, and caught him red-handed. He urged him to not be stupid and put it back, to take the ring instead and use it to get away for a bit until Jason would’ve managed to get more money and join them. But Cal wouldn’t hear it. ‘Money doesn’t solve everything’, he said apparently and he threw the ring away.”
The earth beneath them grows smaller, cars and buildings shrinking down to the size of ants, until they’re swallowed by the cloud cover.
Sherlock gazed at him. He was standing on the other side of the slab, awkwardness personified, while Greg purred something fortunately indistinguishable in Molly’s ear. John shot Sherlock a clandestine grin, forcing him to bite his lip in order to keep in the snicker tingling his throat. As they finally sat in a cab headed back to Baker Street, bright giggles erupted between their breaths.
“You could’ve told me, you know. Earlier. Before the wedding,” he said, struggling to maintain a neutral calm tone.
Outside, some cars come to a halt with screeching breaks. The sirens of the ambulance are joined by the low humming of rotor blades. In the blue light blinking through the window, Sherlock looks almost sheepish.
John has to set things right. But before he can blaze the trail to his future, he must face the demons of his past.
“Actually,” Mrs Hudson finally says, “I think he’s talked Molly into letting him use the lab today. Usually, she doesn’t come in on Saturdays but you know how persuasive he can get. He said something about dissolving toenails, I didn’t ask any further.”
Sherlock threw on a t-shirt and his midnight-blue dressing gown and followed him. John had already brought Rosie down from her room and heated a bottle for her. While the little girl had breakfast, they both tried to avoid even the most innocent of touches. But it was no use; like planets caught in an orbit, they were always drawn back to each other. How could you fight such gravity?
They’re sitting across from each other at one of the battered wooden tables, its top patterned with a mosaic of stains and water rings.
He’s lived most of his adult life without anything else filling his days. It’s always been the Work that defined him.
“I know I don’t come around as often as I should. You’re not even the first grave I’m visiting today,” John said with a pained little chuckle as he bent down in front of the marble tombstone and let Rosie’s little hands place the posy on the ground. “I really haven’t been the best widower so far and you know how sorry I am about that. I even forgot to wear my ring. I really didn’t mean this to happen, not consciously at least, but I… I just can’t stop myself from moving on, Mary.”
Now that Sherlock comes to think of it, all his friends seem to have made a pact to not broach the topic in any way.
Mrs Hudson can barely utter a confused “Bye, dear” before John hangs up and jumps out of bed. He’s got no time to lose.
“Here, let me take her. Your side…,” Sherlock said and heaved the little girl into his arms. Rosie immediately grabbled at his face and giggled.
“I’ll never know what he would’ve wanted now, will I?” Cal howled, choked by the tears brimming in his eyes. “Because he’s dead and everyone’ll think I killed him!”
John laid a hand on Sherlock’s, moved by his concern for Rosie and his efforts to help in spite of his uncomfortableness. These tokens of his affection he had displayed over the past two months they lived together again spoke volumes and yet John had failed to grasp their meaning for the longest time. What but love would incite Sherlock Holmes to help with chores? “You go shower, I’ll take care of this.”
Greg has never seen him look so small and soft and utterly forlorn. He steps closer again and carefully places his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Taking a deep breath, Greg lets go of his glass at last. “Just let me get another of these,” he says, heaving himself off the seat. Seeing that Sherlock has finished his cocktail, too, he adds: “Want another?”
Apparently, he is, at least to some extent, judging by the way words of praise roll from his tipsy tongue with such ease.
John and Sherlock stopped in the middle of their embrace and looked at her like two school children caught red-handed eating forbidden sweets. John felt some of his blood return to his cheeks in hot embarrassment. The scenery their landlady was facing right now must look absolutely ridiculous: John in nothing but pants and Sherlock’s t-shirt, Sherlock with bite marks and hickeys all over his bare torso, slow-dancing in the smoke-filled kitchen while their pancakes merrily burned on the stove.
“Jesus, Sherlock, what happened?!” she exclaimed, her eyes wide with worry. “Come in already. And calm down, dear God. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“I feel like we’ve piled up all our past mistakes and shortcomings right here, all our doubts and fears,” he said, fixing his gaze on Sherlock while firmly planting his hand on his back. “And I don’t want any of that stuff in our life when we’re moving forward. Together. As you said: No more secrets. No more hurting. Let’s just leave all of it behind us, for a fresh start.”
Sherlock’s knees almost give out at the sound of these words he never thought to hear like this but, now that they hang in the air between them, there can be no doubt about their truthfulness.
For a moment, he remains deeply immersed in his thoughts. When he speaks again, his words flow hastily, as if they can’t wait to be spoken: “It really wasn’t though, don’t you think? A choice, I mean. Mary is the first woman in my life that… I’ve had girlfriends but while Sherlock was still around—he managed to scare them off pretty easily—” he laughs nervously—”or I did, I don’t know. I probably didn’t even mind at the time. I mean, Sherlock and I, we were always busy with some case or other and he’s right when he says that the Work doesn’t leave much room for anything else. And, honestly, I was fine with that. I liked my life like that. I could’ve gone on for… I wouldn’t’ve minded…”
This needed to mean something. Why else would John be so cryptic about it? He could’ve just sent the song or chosen other words—any other words—to prompt Sherlock to open the link.
To Sherlock, the task equals an attempt to climb down Kilimanjaro, naked and blindfolded. You might as well just sit down at the top of the mountain and freeze to death. It doesn’t make a difference. You’ll die either way.
But what can he do now? He’s made a decision, a promise, a commitment. He’s made a vow, mere hours ago, for better or worse. It’s not about what he wants anymore. He has to think about his wife, about the two of them and their life together.
This was not okay. Had he learned nothing over the years? Hadn’t he caused enough pain already? If there was even the slightest chance that someone he cared for would have to suffer because of his weakness, then Sherlock had to stay strong. Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly, his parents, even Mycroft—
Sherlock doesn’t know how long they stand there, clasping each other like holding on is the only thing keeping them alive. The summer night outside drifts by and still John is crying, a thunderstorm washing the past years’ dust and dirt away.
In the sitting room, only a few meters away now, Sherlock’s voice begins to sing a song John recognizes from
“You interrupt me on a very busy, urgent case because I didn’t reply to your text?” Sherlock sets his cup down a little too forcefully, spilling tea onto the saucer.
Frustration is clogging John’s throat. “This is messed up, honestly. What are you expecting me to do?”
“Jason was definitely dragged to the shed, based on the furrows here. He was already dead by then; the reanimation wasn’t successful. The other person present sat him up against the shed and removed his jacket.”
“Of course, I don’t.” Sherlock’s voice, too, was barely more than a whisper but the words reverberated from every corner of John’s body, leaving soft varicoloured marks all over him. “I love you too.”
He stepped out on the curb in front of the Yard and felt freezing, steady rain needling his face. In any other weather, he would have considered walking home, just to waste some more time.
“Yes, but there’ll be pictures she’ll look at when she’s older. And early impressions are incredibly powerful in shaping children’s bonds and attitudes, John,” Sherlock replied with a frustrated and openly worried tone before he closed the gap between them with one elegant step and let Rosie grip one of his slender fingers.
Dusk has fallen when John steps out of the tube station. Winter is rearing up again, stretching out frosty fingers for any sliver of exposed skin, and the air is heavy with the scent of imminent snow. John ducks his head against the icy wind blowing down the street and hurries home.
“Yeah, good point, good point,” Sherlock mumbles, retrieves a pen from his inner pocket and begins frantically scribbling down ideas in the document’s margins.
Sherlock turned up his collar and scuttled down the stairs. “I highly doubt it but since you insist on it, there’s no point in fighting, I guess.”
The room fell silent for a few seconds, the parent’s grief coating all of their lungs like oily, slate-grey haze.
When John returned from his shift at the clinic that evening, he found Sherlock and Rosie in her room upstairs. As he was climbing the stairs, he could already hear Sherlock’s baritone waving melodiously. He was sitting in the armchair they had put in for nightly feeding sessions, Rosie on his lap, a book opened in front of them.
“Ridiculously small price to pay to finally be with you,” John said, continuing to play with Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock felt some warmth spread in his chest despite his freezing environment. Their first dinner at Angelo’s was one of his fondest memories. “That’d be nice indeed.”
“No, I—,” Sherlock starts without knowing where his words are headed. He pauses. “I meant what I said, I believed it then. This has never happened to me before. I’m not sure when it started exactly. It just happened. I rather it hadn’t.” The aching in his chest confirms his words and Sherlock heaves his mouth upward into a sad smile. “But I’ve learned a painful lesson on the autonomy of feelings. You can wish them gone as much as you like. They rarely listen.”
For a few minutes, blissful, sated silence covers them again. Sherlock relishes in the calm movement of John’s body beneath his, the waxing and waning of his breath, and considers letting slumber take him for a few hours. It’s a tempting prospect to simply drift off, being held so closely, so safely, so lovingly.
“Can you get up?” he asked and assisted his friend with gentle but determined hands as the other slowly nodded. Sherlock was still half paralyzed and remained seated on the bed as John bustled about to get him fresh pyjamas and sheets. “Put that on,” he commanded calmly and handed the detective some clothes but Sherlock was so numbed that he didn’t move. Gingerly, John brought him to his feet and positioned him on the wooden foot of the bed so he could change the sheets. Sherlock obviously wasn’t up to the task. In the quietness of the scene, John could now here faint wailing come from upstairs. Another child that needed comforting. He shortly pressed his eyes shut to gather himself and then addressed Sherlock once again: “Do you think you can change alone or do you need my help?”
“I’ve known since you jumped for him,” she said lowly and a sad smile flickered over her lips. Greg shifted in his seat and placed his hand tenderly on Molly’s thigh.
Sherlock shot John a dumbfounded look but Angelo simply beamed and nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, anything for Sherlock and his friends.”
At the same rate as John’s self-hatred grows, his affection for Mary shrinks until it is not even enough to make him think of excuses for working late or going on a run instead of having dinner together.
John’s eyes prickled with tears and, for once, he made no effort in fighting them. What Sherlock had done was incredibly thoughtful and, coming from the most self-absorbed person he knew, it was nothing less than a declaration of love, for him, for Rosie, for Mary. The two seemingly contradicting feelings that roamed his heart day and night came crashing down on him: missing Mary and loving Sherlock; being caught in the past and longing for a future. How was he supposed to keep all of this inside?
Sherlock gently supported John with a steady arm around his shoulder, glancing at him every few steps. The shadows beneath his eyes shimmered lilac in the rising sun as they stepped outside. John could only imagine how tired he must be.
When he emerged again five minutes later, John was still waiting where he had left him. Sherlock deliberately overlooked the inquisitive expression on his face and hailed a cab to Bart’s, busying himself with his phone. John got the hint and spent the ride quietly staring out the window. Still, Sherlock could sense his impatience, waxing like the pale winter moon, could read it in the frequency with which John clenched his fist or shifted his legs.
John could mark the exact second in which his own disillusion reached Sherlock. “You’re right,” he said, voice significantly deflating. “Why don’t you have all that stuff? You are the
They had said it before. Never like that, never directly. They had squeezed Mary into the space between them as a buffer, used her to make stating it easier, this ancient truth engraved in their bones: Sherlock Holmes loved John Watson. John Watson loved Sherlock Holmes. Or he once had. Before everything had been twisted and broken between them.
“What is it?” John asks hoarsely, as he eventually takes it. To his dismay, he notices his fingers tremble with the familiar tremor as they clasp the paper.
Greg leans back in his seat. “Don’t overthink it, mate. Maybe just include one of your cases. They’re usually entertaining and ridiculous enough.”
“You’re lying, you’re all lying!” Cal’s voice shrieked loud enough for the officers outside to hear. As if in slow-motion, all-consuming panic rippled through his body. John could see his nerves light up like a Christmas tree. And he could pinpoint the exact moment Cal made one last fatal decision.
“I may not be the greatest at picking up on emotional cues but even I can tell that something’s on your mind, Sherlock. Don’t you remember what we promised at Angelo’s?”
So, Sherlock wouldn’t try to take control; He would merely initiate, make an offer. He would present himself, subject himself to John’s wishes and urges: a wilful subordination.
“I thought so, too,” Sherlock said, his eyebrows raised in slight annoyance, and began stocking the fridge with eggs, cheese, and poultry. “We’ll have to watch that. According to my research, her esophageal muscles should be fully developed by now. Maybe we should switch formulas. Or I’ll just have to burp her more often, change the feeding position, or—”
Sherlock bridged the distance between them with outstretched arms, flung them around John’s neck and planted a kiss on his cheek. His eyes sparkled with excitement as he met John’s in the mirror.
Shouting and cheering filled the flat at his words. “You’re engaged, oh my God, you’re engaged! Congratulations!”
“But you know how all of this works. You’ve been on dates before, hundreds of them,” Sherlock whinged, pulling his lips into a pout.
“Happy New Year, Sherlock,” John said, his voice so quiet that Sherlock doubted anyone but him could hear it. Warm fingers wrapped around his wrist and gave it a little squeeze. Once more, John knew exactly what Sherlock needed.
“I need anecdotes,” Sherlock says, finally looking up. Upon beholding Greg’s dishevelled state, his face falls as if he’s just now drawing in his surroundings. “Didn’t go to any trouble, did you?”
At her last comment, Sherlock let out a furious howl that made Mrs. Hudson finally hurry back out the door and, in another frustration-fuelled frenzy, hurled the remainder of the dishes at the smiley face on the opposite wall. The smashing sound of the projectiles finding their target rose to a familiar and tragic melody, echoing in his ears and somewhere in his ribcage.
Over the next few rounds, Sherlock got the distinct impression that John’s statements were particularly aimed at making him drink. He never stated anything that would embarrass Sherlock all too much, never revealing anything about his ignorance concerning sex. But more often than not, Sherlock was the only one drinking when it was John’s turn. The other participants rarely managed to include Sherlock, although Marcus seemed eager to try, growing visibly confused with every added piece of information—or rather lack thereof.
“I didn’t see it. I knew I missed something but I just… didn’t see it.” Sherlock raised his head to meet Lestrade’s impenetrable gaze. The DI hadn’t said a thing since Sherlock had started talking, not even to interrupt his retelling of the caresses in the alley. All tired eyes and unshaven chin, he still looked at Sherlock now, waiting for him to continue.
Sherlock suppresses a yawn. He can’t remember the last time he’s been this relaxed. “The timing just wasn’t right.”
“There wasn’t on his clothes or under his nails,” Molly’s tinny voice came from the speaker, “but since you said there was a good chance the suspect was his boyfriend I thought it would be a good idea to… check for recent sexual intercourse although you didn’t particularly request it. So, I stayed late and did some smear tests and found traces of— sperm in his throat.”
His throat is awfully dry all at once as he stares down at the densely packed words without reading a single one.
Now that he came to think of it, they hadn’t talked about the implications of their first time at all. Had John even asked Sherlock if he was alright afterward? He couldn’t remember. They both had been a sweat-soaked, cum-covered mess, barely able to find their way to the bathroom through the thick, endorphin-induced fog. In hindsight, Sherlock had been awfully quiet. That should have tipped John off, shouldn’t it? Since when was Sherlock Holmes ever at a loss for words? John should have seen that something was wrong. A familiar mixture of guilt, shame, and worry began to simmer in his guts.
“Surprisingly, it was.” Sherlock covered what little was left of the cake with foil and put it in the fridge while John let the sink fill with hot water and dish soap. As he grabbed a sponge and the first dirty plate, he felt a pair of slender arms wrap around his waist.
“No, no. It’s just…,” Sherlock said, his voice again oddly restrained. “Alex always used to tell me things like that. And later, other people did, too. They just never actually meant them. The words are just somehow… tainted now. I know it’s silly, they are just words after all and I’ve been called far worse but—” He shrugged. His sad little smile was wiped away by John’s tender thumb. Memories of their first days together sprang from the treasure chest in John’s mind: Sherlock—captivating, extraordinary, but oh so insecure when met with benevolence—who had a hard time processing John’s genuine compliments about his clearly fascinating mental capabilities. The world had spoiled his trust in praise, in kindness, in people caring about him. And John finally understood why Sherlock’s body was mere transport to him, a mean to an end—to carry his brain, to chase criminals, to manipulate people if necessary. For him, there was nothing sacred, nothing loveable about it. How could it be after people had been lying about its worth for all these years?
Sherlock snorted indignantly, his voice a poignant reflection of the hurt feelings that flooded his system: “And whose fault is that.” The words had slid off his tongue and dropped to the floor before he could catch them.
“Oh.” John didn’t know how else to respond to this timid version of Sherlock. It physically hurt him to see him like this, small and ashamed and so very exhausted. As much as the day had taken its toll on John, it had certainly not spared Sherlock either—if he hadn’t received that last text, if he had found the flat empty upon his return, after such a huge fight.
Next to him, Sherlock gave a jolt and a little indistinguishable whimper. John quickly kept talking, drawing Cal’s attention back to himself. “Running isn’t an option, Cal, just put the gun down. You don’t want to do this. Think about Laney.”
John and Sherlock looked at each other in open and unapologetic adoration. “Well, that we are,” Sherlock said and bend down a little to kiss John again, a heavenly confirmation. John’s eyes fell shut as Sherlock’s lips met his, endorphins running in his bloodstream like a stampede of tiny elephants. The world around him drowned out again, all his senses fixed on Sherlock.
The club they ended up in was everything Sherlock had expected it to be: loud, crowded, dark, and hot. The bass hammering from the speakers welcomed them in a wild embrace as soon as they stepped through the door. Sherlock felt it echo in his body like a second pulse. The air was saturated with sweat and perfume and alcohol, forming a dizzying fog that coated his lungs. People were moving on the dancefloor, swaying like a single being to the electrifying rhythm.
On his way home, Sherlock stops three more times, relishing each cigarette between his lips while the sunbeams warming his face slowly get lost between the buildings. As he enters Regent’s Park again, runners and people with their dogs passing him by, the sky above has already changed from a radiant pink to an intense, rapidly darkening blue.
I've not written anything Mystrade-concerned but, if any of you encourage me to, I'll give it a go! :)
Collapsing onto him, John released Sherlock’s hands which at once came around his body in a tight embrace. John felt himself slip out of Sherlock but didn’t dare to move since the arms and legs around him still held on in almost desperate determination.
“How do you—?” John began with a puzzled look but then just shrugged his shoulders and handed Mycroft the glass. “You know what, don’t tell us. That could be our engagement present.” He returned to Molly, Greg, and Mrs. Hudson but not without giving Sherlock a wink and pinching his butt, a bright, mischievous grin illuminating his features.
“Molly, I… we… he doesn’t…,” he mumbled through his fingers, unable to form his horror into a cohesive sentence. Speaking was incredibly arduous.
Sherlock props himself up on his elbows and meets John’s eyes. A grin spreads on his face. “Lay it on me.”
John followed silently like a shadow as they descended to the ground floor where Jason’s parents waited. Greg led them into a spacious sitting room and kept discretely in the background as they approached two sofas and additional armchairs grouped around a massive coffee table in front of a fireplace.
“We can still try,” John teased, earning a silent laugh bubbling out of Sherlock. “Well, there is always adoption but, to be honest, I thought… surrogacy. You know, with you as a donor. I’m always amazed when I spot parts of myself in Rosie, and I think having a child that’s part you, too…”
Fused together in the backseat, their laughter slowly ebbed away. London crept by outside, smudged and dazed.
“Okay, well, let me think,” John said, letting his tongue slip out between his lips again. “Every relationship is unique, so, if one of us isn’t comfortable with something we can just say so, alright?”
The shadows around Greg’s eyes seem to darken as he looks back at John, unsmiling. “No, he doesn’t know I’m here. And I’m not even sure he would want me to do this.”
“Yes, everything’s great actually,” John hastily reassures her. “I’m just calling to ask you for a tiny, little favour.” In hindsight, he could’ve been a little more considerate, John thinks as Mrs Hudson lets out an audible breath.
Sherlock took a look around. Music was filling the air; something he had heard before on the radio or while stalking John’s Spotify account, though he couldn’t name the song right now. Small groups of people were scattered all over the room and the adjoining kitchen, all chatting vividly. Oh God, he needed a drink. As if summoned by this thought, John appeared with two beers. He handed Sherlock one with an encouraging grin. “Cheers!”
“Well, I best be going now. Rosie is overdue for a nap and she gets unbelievably cranky when she falls asleep on the tube,” he says and heaves his daughter into his arm as he gets up.
“What?” Sherlock sat back up. John tried hard not to laugh out loud at the adorable indignation saturating his question.
He felt Lestrade’s eyes burning on his skin in unbearable sympathy as he watched from his place at the plain metal table. The notepad and voice recorder on it seemed to hum expectantly, another unsettling sound joining the cacophony in his head.
Sherlock furrowed his brow at the sudden change of mood, his eyes trailing off, looking for the step he had just missed. Hesitatingly, he said: “Yesterday, when you went out. The internet offers quite a few insightful sources on all kinds of matters and I thought this—”
John had realized—after Sherlock’s outburst last night—that he had wrongly dismissed the perils and pains the destruction of Moriarty’s heritage had entailed. But to what extent Sherlock had suffered in those two years had still been hard to grasp in sight of all the grief-laden months he had endured himself. Only now, as he let his fingers feather-lightly trace the spiderweb of misery spread out over Sherlock’s back, he truly understood.
Warm lips met Sherlock’s in a tender kiss and sent an avalanche through his body. Every fibre, every bone, every cell seemed to be filled and overflowing with John, only John. Sherlock let himself sink into the kiss, eyes falling shut and hands holding on to the only fixture left in the universe.
“You’ve made a commitment,” Sherlock states and the fact that he’s right makes him nauseous. He forces the words out because he knows they have to be said. “To Mary. And you’re not the kind of man who leaves a pregnant woman.”
“Don’t worry about that, mate. I’m just glad you’re alright.” Greg gave him a weary smile. “But maybe try talking Sherlock out of poisoning me if you can. I think he’s still quite pissed at me.”
Greg hesitantly turns around and meets Sherlock’s eyes. To his alarm, they are filled with tears again.
As John woke again, the bedroom was ablaze with sunlight. He squinted until his eyes had attuned to the brightness, then raised his wrist to look at his watch. A mumbled curse escaped his lips as he realized that he had already slept through two alarms. That usually only happened when he was drunk. He must’ve been really knocked out last night. Slowly, the curious and partly discomforting events of last night filled his conscience. He turned his head and found Sherlock still sleeping beside him, a halo of dark curls spread across his pillow, chest heaving in calm steadiness. Even in this relaxed state, he looked decidedly worn down. Circles of dark purple shone through the pale skin under his eyes and his cheeks were even hollower than usual. Guilt stung in John’s chest at the realization that he hadn’t perceived the obvious traces of exhaustion on his friend. In light of last night’s revelation, it seemed negligent that he had just blamed any signs of fatigue or discomfort on The Work.
He stayed in his room or roamed London for as long as he could possibly allow himself, only returning after twilight when the darkness offered cover for his wasting heart. John took the hint, turning off the lights in their flat as well. It made it easier for him too, Sherlock guessed. Pretending was less difficult when your eyes didn’t betray you.
Mycroft closed the door behind him and, immediately, Sherlock turned around and asked: “What are you doing here? Picking up some of your stuff?” His voice had gained back some of the cold indifference he used on boring clients.
Sherlock stayed silent for a few seconds, his brow slightly furrowed in thought. “Honesty,” he finally stated. “I don’t know what else I want because I’ve never come this far with anyone really. But I know that I don’t want to pretend anymore. We’ve lied to ourselves, to each other, to everyone basically and look where it got us. I don’t want any more secrets between us.”
The tree they chose barely fit in the corner of the sitting room. It took the combined strength of both John and one of Sherlock’s homeless acquaintances to get it up the stairs, while the detective himself strolled idly behind, carrying the shopping bags and commenting on their suboptimal towing technique.
“I’m not gonna fall for that.” Cal’s voice rose to hysteric heights. “How stupid do you think I am?!”
Greg is still not quite following. How is the best man speech involved in this matter of life and death?
“I’m not a police officer, Laney,” John said. Lestrade and Donovan took the hint and slowly backed off. “I’m just concerned about you and your brother. Do you think you could tell me? It’s really important that we find and help him, so you two can still go away together.”
And So, John found himself back in his home, spending every day with the two people he held most dear in the world. He found himself chasing criminals throughout the enigmatic and spellbinding city of London with his even more enigmatic and spellbinding flatmate again. He found himself caring for his infant daughter. And he found himself healing.
A first wave of relief puts out his worst fears but the worried voices in his head can’t be drowned out quite as easily. There are still too many possible threats.
When his eyes finally ran dry, Molly stood up to get him a tissue and Greg returned to the kitchen, this time to make coffee, in a silent agreement that it would be a long night. Sherlock was endlessly grateful for their discretion as he dried his face and took several deep breaths. Confiding his feelings to Molly and Greg was such a relief—as if the mere articulation of the horrifying thoughts clawing at the inside of his skull made them lose some of their viciousness. So, he kept talking, sharing, trusting, and every genuinely sympathetic response soothed his soul. His sense of time lay buried beneath all the secrets and sorrows he piled up on the table until a mighty yawn pried his jaw open.
“Mary.” The name cut through the warmth of the room as if someone had smashed in a window, letting the cold autumn air invade.
“Still, you are definitely more experienced in this area than I am. I don’t want to cross some invisible border or accidentally hurt you or do something wrong just because I don’t know anything about romantic entanglement. There is so much at stake—our life as we know it and Rosie’s and The Work and… I will most certainly mess this up and then you will hate me and I will lose you—”
As usual, John thinks grimly and presses the toothpaste so forcefully that a large share misses his brush and lands in the sink.
At half past five, John couldn’t stand it any longer. He rose from the armchair, gathered everything he needed, and put it in the backpack he had repurposed as a diaper bag for Rosie. She began to whine again as he dressed her but, mere five minutes out on the cold dark street, sleep took her back into a warm embrace. John steered the pushchair down Baker Street to the underground station. His eldritch steps echoed on the almost empty platform of the Metropolitan Line. In less than two hours, hundreds of people commuting to work would crowd the space, pressing into each other, shoving and pushing to get into the carriages. This morning, only three other passengers got onto the tube with them. John made use of the few minutes he had and sent one last text to Sherlock’s phone.
They shared another kiss, giggling against each other’s lips, hands roaming warm and willing skin. Again, Sherlock gave John a little spin and caught him in his arms, bending him back in a mirror of the motion they had practiced all these months ago for his wedding waltz.
The grin apparently chiselled into his skull, he waits for Rosie to wake up, plans already forming into fantastic scenarios in his mind. He’s all but vibrating with excitement.
“I’ve risked my life for you every single day for months, making sure that none of Moriarty’s henchmen would try to use you as leverage against me. And after I finally succeeded, after I had gotten myself beaten and battered, I came back and you were gone. You had moved on without me. I know you suffered, I know I put you through hell but I never doubted that you would understand
John’s alarm melted into a relieved chuckle but, at the sight of Sherlock’s oblivious face, he swallowed it quickly to avoid any further questions about
Now, that he sat in the car, a peacefully sleeping Sherlock by his side and every mile bringing them a little closer to the home they shared, an almost incomprehensible amount of gratefulness and serenity flooded his veins. That his life would feel this complete again only months after Mary’s death had been unthinkable for so long.
“I spent half of last night spilling my guts to Molly and Greg,” Sherlock explained with an embarrassed grin.
When they returned to one of the busier streets, with wobbly legs and mischievous grins, midnight had already passed. Fingers intertwined, they threaded through the few people crossing their path when John’s phone buzzed in his jacket. He fished it out of his pocket with his free hand, determined to not let go of Sherlock. The cold light of the screen painted his face with deeper ridges and sharper edges.
The final result definitely made up for all the inconveniences endured earlier. With Rosie cuddled up against him, Sherlock sat down on the sofa and examined the flat. Overall, it already resembled some of the pictures he had seen online but, surely, more could be done to prepare 221B for a perfect Christmas.
“Can we tell him now? About the ring and everything,” John asked, stifling a yawn and watching the passing cars and their drivers, unfazed by the temperatures outside, with obvious envy.
Working with Sherlock was an elementary part of his life and dictated most of his everyday routines but they hadn’t been out of town for a case for quite some time now. He felt a little nervous at the thought of spending the night away from Baker Street. Rosie, he knew, was safe with Mrs. Hudson and Molly, but now that he and Sherlock were finally growing closer again he feared that anything out of their usual routine might disturb the perfect homeostasis they had achieved.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted the other man’s confounded stuttering, trying to sound as placatory as he could. “I’m an arse, forget what I’ve said, okay?”
Sherlock’s heart danced in relief as he sank back into the shredded remains of his flat. He let out a dark, velvety chuckle from the depths of his chest. Soon, this would be his,
. It couldn’t be clearer. John lets out a disbelieving puff of air—half laughter, half sigh. Why has it taken him so long to see it?
Sherlock puts on his Belstaff and scarf a tad more forcefully than necessary, choking himself a little. That only adds to his bad mood.
Sherlock needs distraction, something to feed the hungry furnaces in his head, something hard, a piece of metal for his intellectual forges to shape into theories as sharp as swords.
He felt transported back to the first night they had spent together, the first chase for the first case. The way their steps had echoed in the streets Sherlock knew better than the palm of his hands—John beside him had coloured them so differently, like a new lens being slipped over Sherlock’s vision, filtering the ugly parts out and only leaving brighter, more exciting shapes.
As they reached the playground, the sun had retreated entirely. John shot worrying glances up to the clouds that gradually changed to a darker shade of grey. Just as Rosie sat on the toddler swings, the sky opened up and it began to snow. Thick fluffy flakes waltzed to an unheard melody and settled on every surface, hushing the world with their soft embrace. Sherlock took Rosie in his arms as she tried to catch the snowflakes with her hands and then her tongue. He let one icy crystal land on his bare finger where it melted and Rosie’s eyes grew big in awe. John just stood there and watched his daughter laugh and cheer while the snowflakes slowly nestled in Sherlock’s hair. The little white patches offered an enchanting contrast on his dark curls and John could hardly fathom how stunningly, how devastatingly beautiful he was. As Sherlock’s eyes met his gaze, his brightly beaming smile shifted into something calmer but not less happy. John would have given his life to keep these two, the people who occupied every last nook of his heart, as happy and content as they were in this moment. Gravitationally pulled to the center of his universe, John stepped closer, barely resisting the urge to bury his hands in Sherlock’s snow-covered hair and pull him close, closer. And he wanted to tell him. Tell him, how his life was nothing without him in it, how he cherished every precious moment with him, how they were together now and he would never let anything come between them again.
Accepting Sherlock’s invitation to return to Baker Street so unceremoniously wouldn’t be an appropriate response, now would it?
Sherlock just shrugged and raised his upper body from the sofa. Usually, they would both go to bed at the same time, since neither of them would fall into deep sleep anyway unless they lay next to each other. Sherlock would never admit it but the adoption of John’s regular sleeping pattern had significantly improved his own well-being, just as the fact that John made sure he ate enough. Tonight, however, a strange resistance stirred in Sherlock at the thought of laying down next to him.
At the words, Mrs. Beaumont gave another pitiable sob, forming words nonetheless: “No one would’ve wanted to hurt him. He didn’t have—enemies. Jason was a good boy. He—”
Tentatively, John brought his other hand up to Sherlock’s chest, sliding up over the fabric in a slow stroke until he reached his cheek. He gently cupped Sherlock’s burning face with cold fingers and silently asked for permission once more.
Having signed all papers, John swapped the hospital gown for his trousers and a shirt Greg had graciously brought from his locker. John’s own shirt and jacket had been ruined by the blood spill and the ambulancewoman’s scissors. To top things off, Sherlock handed John his own Belstaff with a stern look. John grumbled but put it on. The too-long coattail flopping around his legs, he left the hospital.
From underneath a smorgasbord of documents, he retrieves a tightly folded piece of paper. The edges are slightly worn already from having been handled so many times by tentative fingers.
For a moment, he fears the nausea tugging at his guts will get the better of him but after a few deep breaths the feeling subsides again, and he drags himself into the bathroom. Greedily, he grabs one of the toothbrush glasses, fills it at the tap, and empties it in big, rushed gulps. The cool water is a boon and John hastily fills the glass a second time.
“Jason was a good boy,” his mother reiterated, red eyes fixing on Sherlock in an almost pleading manner.
“Monday morning,” John replies absentmindedly while searching the dancing crowd with his eyes. Something in his features wipes away the last bit of doubt on Greg’s mind even before John says: “Where could Sherlock possibly be? You don’t think he’s left already, do you?”
“Happy New Year, John,” Sherlock replied, trying to make it sound as sincere and affectionate as he could.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice pierced through his conscience and Sherlock felt a warm hand slightly joggle his shoulder. For a second, he considered simply ignoring John—but what was the point? He opened his eyes to find John standing next to the sofa, his familiar features smiling down at him through the dim light of the one lamp still burning. “I’m going to bed now, it’s getting late.”
John hung up at the sound of the beep. Sherlock had declined his call. That meant he was at least noticing that John tried to contact him.
He has pushed the thought down, has carefully, forcefully avoided even coming near it, and, yet, it has snuck past his defences.
“Sure,” Sherlock replied with a shrug for lack of a better answer although he really wasn’t sure if drinking was a good idea. Alcohol could either soothe him or make this a hundred times worse.
Mrs Hudson only giggles and pats his arm. “I’ve made you the lasagne you like so much. It’s in the fridge, you just have to reheat it.”
They split and began looking for possible hide-outs in one of the houses. After a few minutes, John waved him over and gestured to be quiet: Behind one of the bigger wheelie bins, there was a door with a broken padlock hanging from it. The snow had been freshly shoved aside—recently opened then.
John and DC Fuller watched as Sherlock examined the body in his familiar fashion, almost dancing around the gurney in swift movements, completely forgetting about his surroundings.
John pointedly looked at the gun—“isn’t an option. You can still set things right. You stole a few things but we retrieved the ring and if you give back the other—”
“Yes,” Sherlock rolls his eyes, “I’ll be a good boy, eat my vegetables, not watch too much telly and be in bed by ten. Happy? So, before I give in to my urge to push you down the stairs, please just go.” He stresses the last word and tries to look cross enough to place some emphasis on his threat.
As the less energetic verse took over again, John slowly swayed against him, letting his body follow the rhythm, eyes closed and still mouthing the text: “
“Four texts from Greg asking if you’d figured anything out,” he said, his eyes skimming through the messages under furrowed brows. “Man, he really is nervous about this case, isn’t he?”
“That’s enough, Sherlock,” John said, his voice calm but stale. He lifted their shopping bags off the counter and made for the door without so much as looking at the cashier or any of the other customers. For a second, Sherlock stood there completely motionless, his eyes following John out of the store. The sight of his back, upright and sturdy as always, extinguished Sherlock’s anger as if John had emptied a bucket of ice water over his head, leaving nothing but wet, charred doubt.
Sherlock could almost hear her blush over the phone. Although, that was admittedly a pretty genius idea.
And Sherlock would make it count. He would soak all of John up, would consume him completely, let every fibre of his body be graced with him until neither time nor trauma could ever erase the traces this wonderful man left all over him. And he would give and give and give as long as John would let him, whatever he asked of him and a million things more. If good things weren’t meant to last, if their time was inevitably running out, Sherlock would spend every second cherishing John, aware of these moments’ preciousness. Didn't transience attach a special value to things?
Our journey is drawing to a close. One more chapter full of fluff lies ahead! :) And the sequel is already in the making if you are interested!
“That’s lovely, Sherlock,” John’s voice sounded softly as Sherlock paused for a second, guiding Sherlock out of his own head, filled with odes to John, John, John.
“I’ve just fed Rosie and put her down for her nap,” he said in a low voice, shying away as John reached out for him. “Don’t. She spat up all over me. I need a shower.”
As the couple straightened up, he shot Sherlock a look, asking for his approval. Behind their sofa, Greg slowly paced up and down, his nervous energy itching on the back of Sherlock’s neck like a persistent bug crawling up the length of his spine. Having his superior sitting here obviously took its toll on him.
He didn’t bother with the gate and jumped straight over the fence. His longer legs caught up with John and he risked a glance at him, seeing his own determined yet thrilled expression mirrored back at him.
John’s cheeks turned adorably pink at her words. “No need to worry, Mrs. H.,” he quickly interrupted, “a one-year-old makes for a great chaperon. We hardly get a minute to ourselves, Rosie keeps us on our toes.”
I was so nervous to write this chapter and I'm still not quite sure if I met my own expectations. As a cishet girl, writing a coming-out, especially of someone who has suppressed their feelings for so long, is not an easy task. I really hope I lived up to it. Please let me know if anything bothers you or if my approach feels inappropriate!
“Don’t worry, love, we don’t have to rush anything,” John said with what was probably meant to be a reassuring smile. He climbed the first step leading up to the door of 221B. Sherlock swallowed an exasperated sigh and stayed put, their still interwoven fingers pulling John back this time. With the elevation of the step, he was for once just as tall as Sherlock—if not even a few inches taller. Sherlock stared up at him in the unfamiliar angle and pulled him a little closer still. In the cold air, purified by snow, John’s breath ghosted over his face in an exhilaratingly scented mist—wine and dessert and delicious promises.
“Don’t act so shocked,” Sherlock said in a slightly huffy tone. His eyes glistened in the dark and, for a few seconds, he remained silent. John was just about to wish him a good night, when Sherlock’s voice, now earnest and small, floated up to him again: “He was right when he yelled at me. What I did was reckless and disrespectful and unnecessarily dangerous. It’s just… I’ve always handled the work like this because the officials I worked with were mostly idiots who didn’t trust my methods. It was more efficiently to do as much of their work as possible, unhindered by their bureaucracy and whatnot. And it was more fun this way, I admit. Running after criminals, putting myself in the line of fire. There was nothing at risk but my own safety. But now… Greg was absolutely right. I thought I was guided by my worry about Rosie, about you. But if I had been I had tried to stay out of harm’s way, for your sake. I’m in this unfamiliar position now of having people in my life who’d be actually affected if I got hurt.”
Sherlock painted the words on his jaw with light kisses: “I don’t want to forget any of this. Ever. I need to remember how you respond to me, what you feel like.”
“She looks just like mom,” Harry mumbled with a softened expression as she watched Rosie wrinkle her nose in her slumber.
John’s hand finds its way into Sherlock’s, squeezing it as they listen to Greg’s words. The brand-new wedding band pressed into Sherlock's skin feels natural, like a missing part of his body returned at last. He can’t believe it took so long for them to arrive here.
“I did do that, didn’t I?” John asked in mock astonishment and grinned. Having Sherlock so close to him, begging for his attention in this endearing, half-seductive, half-bashful way—it was just too good to not tease him a little longer. He let his finger wander higher over Sherlock’s collar bone and his neck up to his face. Slowly, he raised up on his toes, letting his thumb brush over Sherlock’s ridiculously plush lower lip while wetting his own. How he had ever refrained from kissing the man in front of him for so long was a mystery to John. This mouth was made to be kissed, this body was made to be claimed and worshipped and loved.
Sherlock followed his motion, his eyes glued to John’s lips. Mere inches apart, he let his gaze suggestively trace down to their joined pelvises, his voice lowering in quite the same manner to a lascivious growl: “We… could put them to use. I did a bit of research on the topic and, as it seems, we—”
he ended up in a suite on the top floor, wide and bathed in warm sunlight, falling through several floor-to-ceiling windows on the right-hand side. A giant dark green sofa, with an absurd number of fluffy cushions in all shapes and sizes spread upon it, stood in the middle of the room, facing the wall opposite the windows. The niftily patterned ivory wallpaper barely shone through between all the photographs, tables, sketches, and diagrams pinned to the walls. The only other piece of furniture was a double bed with luxurious sheets nestled into a nook to his right. Sherlock stepped into the room.
A grin sneaked itself onto John’s lips. “I would’ve shagged you years ago if that gets me pancakes.”
John tries to shake off the thought and digs his hands deep into his pockets against the cold. Rosie’s little winter hat tickles his chin. Naturally, she has long fallen asleep—unimpressed by all of John’s endeavours to keep her awake in hope to get her to sleep through the night.
Silence rages on between them, only interrupted by Sherlock’s heartbeat echoing in his ears, heavy and hurtful.
Sherlock took another deep breath, drawing in the smell of John. His chest ached in unfulfilled desire as he made them dance, again and again, unable to disengage from the agonizingly beautiful picture of John’s face shining down on him. His mind gradually overwrote parts of the memory with images and sensations from New Year’s Eve—the way John had looked at him on the dancefloor, eyes filled with fiery determination, his body pressed against Sherlock’s—until the illusion was so perfect Sherlock could almost taste it on his tongue. He had quite a bit of experience in this area, by now: distorting his own memories into daydreams, molding them into something sweeter.
I hope you guys liked some more of that Mollstrade sweetness because I adore those two together <3 And I hope you're not tired yet of Sherlock's POV because discovering all the layers of repressed emotion is just fascinating for me and I just can't stop :D
They rushed around the corner—and found the alley in front of them completely deserted. Both slithering to a halt, they eyed the brick walls full of more or less skilfully applied graffiti, the heavy back entrances of various restaurants and cafés, and the few dirty cardboard boxes and trash bags leaned against wheelie bins. None of them offered enough shelter for a person to hide.
“Angelo,” John quickly added with a smile Sherlock couldn’t quite classify, “could you get us a candle for the table? It’s more romantic.”
John pulls on his sock with a speed evocative of a geriatric sloth. “Go ahead. I’m gonna need a minute.”
Without his permission, the thought of Sherlock’s dark timbre with the magical ability to make Rosie fall asleep within minutes crept into John’s mind. Mere hours ago, they had bantered about it, carefreely and intimately. Mere hours ago, they had existed in this sphere of unadulterated happiness—a little family, unconventional but nonetheless perfect. How had they managed to destroy all this in one day?
But John didn’t want to fall asleep. Not yet. Not while the sensation of having Sherlock pressed against him, skin to skin, was still fresh and vivid, with crisp, shining edges that made his heart ache in overwhelming happiness. If he was lucky, soon enough their touches would lose this feeling of novelty and instead gain a reassuring, homely quality. But for now, John wanted to soak up as much of this pleasant giddiness that came with Sherlock’s naked form against his.
Sherlock keeps his head down, busying his fingers with ripping the last chip into bits. “But then a client came and it all got… so crazy and I couldn’t think. Just couldn’t think right. And then when we were in that cell… together, on that slab thingy. He refused to let go of me. He held on so tight, so tightly. And we were half—half asleep already but I think… I’m sure John kissed me… Just this once, on the forehead.”
“For Rosie? How’s Rosie going to kiss people under the mistletoe, Sherlock?” John asked exasperatedly and turned back around. Then, it hit him.
Even as Sherlock’s fingers on the guitar abate in their fervour, John still feels the aftershock trembling through his body.
“John, Greg, get a real drink. It’s not fair if you’re only drinking beer while the rest of us is having booze,” giggled Stella and Sherlock bit his lips to suppress the comment that already lay on his tongue. He really didn’t want to rub someone off the wrong way. John would be so mad at him if he behaved badly tonight. And… he wanted to attend a party like this at least once without being asked to leave because he upset or insulted anyone by accident. In his few years at university, he had never managed that, no matter how hard he had tried.
At last, Greg pulls a square envelope out of his jacket pocket. “I’ve got something for you. From Sherlock. He wanted to give it to you the night before the wedding but I told him not to. I thought it best if you don’t see it but after what you’ve said at the wedding…”
“So, how're things?” he asked, consciously keeping his voice interested and relaxed. With Harry, he always struggled to hit the right tone. Her disarming honesty made every conversation a minefield of possible conflicts and awkwardness.
The anger that bubbled up in him like boiling sulphur kept spilling out. “Oh, it’s so much easier, sitting in your chair and judging other people, without having to give their problems a second thought, you insensible woman. Just so you know: This man is a war hero, a doctor, and now a widower and single father. He’s the most hard-working, loyal, and intelligent man you’ll ever meet, but you wouldn’t recognize intelligence when it hit you in the face, now, would you? What have you ever accomplished in your life, apart from becoming a bitter, arrogant underachiever who can’t even work her way up the ranks by shagging the manager? What on earth gives you the right to spill your unqualified, self-absorbed opinions on decent men like him? You’re not even worth the dirt under his shoes so, for fuck’s sake, just shut up.”
He’ll make the best of it. That’s all he can do, really. He loves Mary, he really does, so, he can learn to love the baby and the new life it brings. A lot of parents probably would’ve never thought they want children and still love them once they’re in the world. Surely, John will be one of them.
A quiet smile flickered over John’s lips, making Sherlock question the rationality of his thought process since John obviously found it amusing. Was there anything funny about him trying to not tank Greg’s career?
He will tell him today, John decides as he carries the groceries back to their flat. Rosie will start school in a couple of weeks. It’s high time she gets her own room, to invite friends, to do homework, to have a place she doesn’t have to share with her father. Sherlock will surely understand that, won’t he? Yes, John will tell him today that he and Rosie will move out.
He still has no idea what to expect but he’s certain he can’t shelve this confrontation any longer. He needs to know.
John swallowed heavily around the lump in his throat. He had good reasons for not visiting his father’s last resting place, even after he had returned from Afghanistan. But now, other even more important reasons had finally brought him here. He needed to get this off his chest.
Sherlock stared at the ringing phone in his hand, his mind paralyzed. A strange sense of loss lingered in the air, as the ringtone finally died. Only seconds later, however, it rose from the dead again. Sherlock still made no effort to pick up. What was he supposed to say? The call ebbed away once more, followed by a text message:
Sherlock gave a non-committal grunt, his brain too heavily marinated in endorphins to form an actual sentence. He barely registered where he was. As John continued his way to the main road, Sherlock followed him blindly like a sleep-walking puppy, his lead consisting of John’s warm hand in his.
“Oh, I’ll be the nicest person you’ve ever seen then,” Sherlock growled, leaning into the touch and trying to snatch John’s neck with his lips but the other deftly dodged his assault and instead began to run his hand back up again, over the nape of his neck and into his hair.
John stares at him, his throat bobbing as he swallows. “Why didn’t you tell me that? When you came back. You said you were worried about my indiscretion.”
“You knew on the stag night.” Sherlock turns again and carefully eyes John’s expression, looking for minuscule clues of whether he’s telling the truth. “You must’ve known.”
The light-hearted sounds of amusement John freed from Sherlock’s chest with skilful movements of hands and fingers resounded deep inside his mind. He only now fully realised how incredibly lucky he was. Sherlock was right, and so had been Greg; He shouldn’t risk the life he had finally been granted, a life full of love and joy and warmth, a life he could spend with Sherlock and Rosie, as a family.
“You’re awfully quiet,” John said after a few minutes. “Under other circumstances, I’d be thankful for the silence but now I’m starting to get worried.”
“I can’t tell you,” Laney wailed, repeating it over and over while red-hot tears streamed down her cheeks.
John raised his brows, head swaying from side to side as he weighed Sherlock’s deduction. “Makes sense. Why didn’t you tell Greg right away? Don’t you think he ought to know, with his boss involved in the whole thing?”
His eyes glistening with emotion as well, John rose and caught him in a tight embrace, burying his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, words muffled against his skin: “I love you too. So, so much.”
At the sight, John’s stomach turns in some kind of sympathy nausea. Or maybe it is just the mere mentioning of the pregnancy that makes his insides crawl with discomfort.
“Hi,” Sherlock replies, the word barely more than a breath. The blood rushing in his ears drowns it out easily. “What—what are you doing here?”
Only two hours later, the flu got hold of Sherlock, as well, although not as badly; he only threw up once and slumbered next to the still feverish John for the remainder of the day. As the sun began to set again and Sherlock trudged off to the kitchen to get a glass of water, he found a get-well-soon note from Mrs. Hudson next to a tray loaded with salty crackers, herbal tea, and a pot of chicken soup; obviously a substitute for her usual afternoon tea and biscuits. Sherlock resolved to thank her next time he saw her—if he remembered to. He reheated the soup, made them each a cup of herbal tea, and carried everything back to the bedroom. This being-a-good-friend-thing became easier by the minute.
. He grabbed his empty teacup from the side table and hurled it across the room at the opposite wall where it burst into a myriad of porcelain shivers. The sight of the ricocheting fragments had something peculiarly relaxing and gracefully destructive about it. Sherlock’s eyes gleamed at the sight of this outlet for his boiling thoughts. So, he rushed into the kitchen, threw all cupboards open, and seized as much of the tableware as he could carry.
“Nothing to worry about, Mrs. H.,” John reassured her with a weary smile and reached for his fussing daughter.
“I didn’t beg,” Sherlock spits. “And just because I need your assistance with something as frivolous as these… bloody wedding formalities it doesn’t mean you—you get to manhandle me. I can handle myself just fine.”
“And while I know that most people find it difficult to maintain a friendly relationship with someone who is attracted to them I can promise you I would never make any advances or make you feel uncomfortable in any way.”
Sherlock turned around, feeling the sparks fly from his eyes: “You’re finally asking the right questions.”
–were so caught up in the idea that I’d just run off to another little adventure and just didn’t want
Just as he was about to close his lips around John’s cock, Rosie’s wailing, distorted by the baby monitor, pierced the excited silence. They exchanged a look, disappointment prominent on both faces, before John cleared his throat, pulled his pants back on and left the room with a quick peck to Sherlock’s pouting lips.
“Alright. You won’t try again? Do I need to call someone?” The man seemed trapped between his genuine concern and the waxing chorus of horns that urged him to move his car.
Now, he was sitting on his armchair, his eyes closed in concentration, contemplating his further course of action. John would certainly want to talk about all of this eventually and he needed to be prepared. “Gather data and derive the logical solution,” said a voice in his head that annoyingly resembled Mycroft’s. Sherlock shook his head to get rid of it, yet, followed the instruction.
The sound of the door shutting set John back in motion. As if in trance, he climbed the stairs and took his crying daughter in his arms. She was the only thing that counted now, his little girl, his Rosie. He bounced her in a mechanical movement, his mind around that toddler-shaped fixed star filled with overwhelming, all-consuming blankness. Something inside him had shut off, maybe permanently. Rosie seemed to sense his agitation and refused to be calmed down as if her life depended on it.
“Harry, over here,” he called as his sister stopped at the entrance and searched the room for a familiar face. As she spotted him, her eyes lit up in a smile that John tentatively mirrored. His facial muscles stung under the forced expression. It was much more terrifying to confront someone that could actually answer.
It was hard to resist that military authority. “Unbelievably, impossibly good,” Sherlock responded, eager to fulfil his wishes and put this newly-discovered way to stimulate his lover to the test some more. “I have never experienced such pleasure before. You have no idea how long I have dreamed of this.”
John sank his teeth into his skin once more, feeling the wildly thumping pulse beneath his tongue. At the contact, Sherlock rolled his hips up to John’s, searching for friction on his leaking cock. John’s own hard length was aching by now, demanding release at all costs. He couldn’t be tamed any longer, he would raven Sherlock, break him open and tear him to pieces, make him scream and cry, fuck the last bit of sass out of him—
Sherlock halted mid-munch. He hadn’t known that John cared about such old-fashioned traditions. But then again, he was a romantic. “What else are you supposed to do?”
His face tells of more sleep (even when taking the strain of being a single parent to a baby into account) and his hands disclose that he has widely given up on drinking. When he’s taken Sherlock to his check-ups at the hospital, and now, when he’s monitoring Sherlock’s recovery himself, John is calm and collected, a little more solemn than he used to be maybe, but he looks relieved, freed from a burden, as if it had taken this violent thunderstorm to finally wash off some of the dust and guilt that had settled on him over the years.
John’s hands clenched around the steering wheel, the knuckles turning white from the pressure. He needed to do something, he needed to end this vicious cycle of hurting and guilty silence.
Sherlock springs to his feet, his heart lodged tightly in his throat. He throws the remote down, together with his resolution, and all but leaps over the coffee table. As he scrambles to the desk, Sherlock’s thoughts weave into hectic patterns of worry and remorse.
John climbed onto the backseat and settled with a hiss. He had almost forgotten how much it sucked to get shot. As soon as they got home he’d take some of that pain medication. And sleep. For at least two days.
John stirred first and raised his eyes to the ceiling where the little girl cried for attention. Hearing Rosie’s distress brought Sherlock back, as well. He drew in a sharp breath and gained control over his limbs. He had already taken several steps towards the stairs, carefully as if the shards of his last protective wall between them could actually cut his feet. Mumbling that he would look after Rosie, he froze once again as John’s voice cut through the dimly lit room: “No.” This one word was cold and commanding, encrusted with his natural military authority.
It’s completely dark outside already though it can’t be later than five. The London traffic creeps by, cars trapped in long lines although it’s Saturday, and Sherlock admonishes the universe to better get him a cab. Being stuffed in the tube with loud, smelly, importunate people is the last thing he needs right now.
On his next attempt, he let the phone ring for almost a minute before he gave up and sent yet another text, trying to sound as worried as he really was.
“A majority, I guess,” John replied and lenient blue eyes wandered over him. “You don’t have to play if you’re uncomfortable with this, Sherlock.”
He opened his eyes fast enough to see the dreamy expression on John’s face turn into confusion and then dismay as he beheld the tears shimmering on Sherlock’s cheeks.
221B still slumbered in darkness and silence as Sherlock scaled the stairs. He sucked in the familiar smell in a deep breath and opened the door to the sitting room, preparing himself for the abandoned battlefield he was about to behold. Sherlock felt it before he saw it, the foreboding making the little hairs on the back of his neck stand on ends as if something cold had just brushed over them. Something loomed there, painted black against the diffuse orange light seeping through the window: the dark silhouette of a man, leaning against the desk, waiting for him.
But obviously, John had underestimated the obsessive amount of thought and energy Sherlock would put into this endeavour. His fault, actually. When was the last time Sherlock had done anything half-heartedly?
The music grows louder and other scents mix in with John’s aftershave but Sherlock’s olfactory index seems to be currently out of order.
John’s eyes kept springing back and forth between Sherlock and the tiny, golden ring. “Okay, makes sense but… why a ring?”
His mind inevitably wanders back to the appalling note he’s written Sherlock just a few months ago, right after Mary’s death. He curses himself again for having stooped so low, for having wreaked his anger and frustration on the person least deserving it.
“You don’t understand,” John sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I mean, the risk of injury is that much higher. It’s incredibly easy to hurt you if I don’t do it right. And even if I do it right, it might still not be pleasant for you.”
“I just…” Greg wets his lips. “If you had had another option, do you think you might’ve chosen it instead?”
John knew that refusal was pointless because it would entail a string of arguments and deductions from Sherlock concerning his apparent sleep deprivation. And anyway, he was way too tired to get a cab in the pouring rain with a grumpy baby. So, he just nodded and, too, took a sip to avoid having to make any further comments. The soothing liquid sank down his throat and slowly dispersed the cold in his body.
“Oh, ok.” John simply smiled and risked a glance at Sherlock’s throbbing erection next to his own. “Well, if you want me to… I could try to take care of you.”
“I’m going to put her down for a nap,” said John as he carefully peeled the toddler from her snowsuit and doffed his own jacket. Sherlock only responded with a hum, already stretched out on the sofa. When John came back fifteen minutes later, he hadn’t moved an inch. Sherlock’s mind still replayed their encounter with the woman on the street in excruciating detail over and over again. Anger and frustration sizzled in his guts, making him slightly nauseous.
Sherlock, of course, was intrigued by the tricky case (he would have taken positively any distraction that day, pondered John) and, before he knew it, they put their suitcases in the trunk of the small rental car Sherlock had organized and off they were to the coast. Sherlock spent the three-hour ride almost completely in silence, already contemplating theories, John guessed, while he was stuck with nothing to do but stare out the window.
“Wait a second, I’ll get you something else,” John chuckled and made his way back to the table that functioned as a bar for the night.
Sherlock stares at him, brows drawn over his eyes like a pair of irritated caterpillars. Greg might’ve laughed at his bewildered expression if his blood wasn’t still fuming underneath his skin.
Sherlock left the room while Katie still recorded Ms. Brower’s statement. John followed him, thinking he might be sick if he stayed another second. In the coldly lit hallway, Sherlock leaned against the wall and covered his worn-out face with slim elegant fingers. John couldn’t quite hide his surprise to see his friend this agitated. Usually, a solved puzzle put Sherlock over the moon. Often enough, they had raised looks of reproach and anger when Sherlock had displayed his self-satisfaction a little too openly.
Rosie is in the middle of her princess phase, ever since she has seen her first Disney movie. For the past weeks and months, she has barely talked about anything else than her favourites—Belle, Elsa, Moana, Cinderella, … She insists on watching the same films over and over again whenever John and Sherlock allow her some telly-time. The rest of her days, she spends reenacting her favourite scenes, soundtrack included. John can (more or less proudly) claim to know the lyrics to
Sherlock raised his head, his piercing eyes almost affronted. “He was dangerous! Look what he did to you. It was pure luck that he didn’t hit any vital organs or…” He swallowed heavily. “It was me who pushed him to this extreme in the first place, with the whole nocturnal chase. Because I was so sure that Cal had stolen from his boyfriend and let him die to not get caught. I saw the pictures of Jason lying in the snow and all I could think of was Rosie. If someone had treated her the same way, pretended to love her just to let her down like this… I was so eager to catch the one responsible myself. And then, when we visited the Rowleys, I saw the abuse springing out from every corner and, again, everything inside my head screamed about Rosie, about how someone had to protect these kids, how I had to protect them.”
“Of course, dear,” she said at once, taking the toddler in her arms. “I can keep her at my flat for the night so you boys can talk.”
Nevertheless, John finds himself retreating to the hot tub or the sauna more often than he’d usually have just for the fact that his pregnant wife doesn’t want to risk anything by coming with.
Greg gives him a pitying smile. “I’m afraid you have to. But, still… If you don’t usually say that kind of stuff to each other, it’s a little weird—”
The milk slowly bedewing with little drops of perspiration, Sherlock hurried back to the check-out, finding that the cashier had already begun to scan their items. He shimmied past the other waiting customers and slammed down the milk just as the clerk picked up the last item, the box of formula for Rosie. Her eyes coolly eyed the packaging before wandering over to John who still tried to calm down the baby while packing up the groceries.
The garden swarmed with officers and forensics in the usual blue overalls when they arrived. What had once surely been a neatly trimmed lawn now resembled a mud pit, soaked by melting snow and rain, and tormented by a dozen pairs of plastic-wrapped shoes. The area around the shed, as well as a few square feet of ground leading to it, however, had been cleared and carefully roofed over by canvas covers. Make-shift pathways made of some sort of yellow plastic tiles encircled the areas to allow the Yarders to examine the location without tainting the evidence.
But John didn’t divert his gaze and reached for Sherlock’s hand, feather-light fingers entangling. The sensation made Sherlock shiver and freed him from his paralysation.
Sherlock was secretly glad that he could avoid most of the drinking during the game. Even with a nourished and rested transport, his tolerance for alcohol seemed to be much lower than everyone else’s. And he was far from sobering up since John made sure to replace his empty cup with a full one every half hour or so. Every time he got up from his chair next to Sherlock, Marcus would seize the opportunity and strike up a conversation, obviously trying to make up for the lack of information the game offered. In his obvious interest in him paired with the disregard of his less polite comments, he reminded Sherlock of Janine. He wasn’t sure if that was a good or a bad thing.
The phone is buried beneath some of his notes and hides from view and touch for torturous seconds until Sherlock can grab it. Hastily, he unlocks it.
Instead of snapping at John, Sherlock now followed a new approach altogether: He tried to reciprocate these acts up to his own capability—which didn’t allow for much, really. Pleasing people was not Sherlock’s strong suit; that had been made clear throughout his entire life. Yet, there had to be ways for him to show John how much he loved having him around again but, as always, Sherlock couldn’t quite figure out what made John Watson tick.
His resolve survives the last bit of some BBC series on the telly and the evening news as well as another helping of lasagne (
“Are you sure? I don’t want to rush you,” he said, concern easily winning over his own arousal. Sherlock’s well-being was all that counted; Even the beast agitatedly prowling in his lower regions agreed to that.
Sherlock still lay there, eyes closed, and showed no signs he had heard him when John came over to bring him a cup of tea. “Sherlock?”
He only remembers how early it still is when Mrs Hudson answers with a somewhat disgruntled “Hello?”
John’s eyes widen but his stance doesn’t lose any of its rigidity. “You… you could’ve told me afterwards,” he insists. “I would’ve understood.”
Sherlock took another deep breath and closed the distance between them, uncontainable relief and longing flooding his system. “— absolutely amazing.”
If the alcohol hasn’t substantially altered his memory, he has told Greg how he had decided to marry Mary. There was nothing alarming about that.
They sat in the Boathouse Café and watched as the world was slowly painted white. Rosie’s attention was completely captured by the snow flurry outside while John and Sherlock warmed their frozen fingers around cups of hot chocolate. The comforting flavour coating John’s mouth, he took in the sight of his little family. Could this day get any better? Half-way through their drinks, the last snowflakes made their way down and the skies eventually cleared again. Rosie seemed disappointed and shifted in her seat. Sherlock pulled her on his lap, dripping words onto her blonde curls as sweet as the hot chocolate. The sun breaking through the clouds outside could barely shine half as bright as John’s smile.
“I’ll better go down and fetch Rosie. Maybe you two could… put on some more clothes while I’m gone?”
John traced her features with an inquiring gaze, noting how emaciated his sister looked, how spent. A pair of the same blue eyes, though more prominent in her child-like face, stared back at John, surely counting the deeper lines on his own face.
“Of course, I did,” Sherlock huffs, the aching right behind his sternum pressing the air out of his lungs. “If you loved me then why did you marry Mary anyway? Why didn’t you say something? Don’t you think that’s unfair, if not towards me then at least towards Mary?”
,“ John began to sing gently, more as to remind himself of the lyrics. Sherlock loved hearing John sing; his voice was rich and extraordinarily expressive as if music unlocked something deep inside of him that was usually not allowed to see the light of day. More times than he cared to count, Sherlock had listened to John crooning songs to himself while making tea or breaking into song under the shower when he thought no one could hear him. Every time, an unfamiliar sensation spread in Sherlock’s body, sailing on his bloodstream to even the remotest of his shores.
