“You’re welcome, baby,” Dean said, removing his fingers and slapping Castiel right over his swollen hole. The omega jerked as that same feeling of pleasure and pain radiated through his whole body and he moaned helplessly, eyes falling shut.
“That’s right, sweetheart,” Dean said, smiling down at him and removing his fingers from Castiel’s hot heat and moving his cock from where it had been pressed firmly against the omega’s ass to rub the head right over Cas’ hole, enjoying the feel of his cock getting soaked in slick.
“Such a good boy,” Dean said, the praise hitting Castiel deep inside. He wanted to please his Alpha, always.
He felt Dean’s hands in his hair again and he cracked open one eye to see the Alpha leaning over him, smiling at him fondly before he kissed the tip of Castiel’s nose.
He let out a mournful little wail and twitched his hips up, wanting to be filled again. As sated as his body felt from being so well used by the pair of Alphas, it no longer felt right to be so hollow. His hole was still fluttering from his orgasm, trying to clench around a cock that wasn’t there. He whimpered again, feeling cold now that his Alpha’s warmth had left him alone.
All of those fears had disappeared when he’d first seen his Alpha, so beautiful and strong, smelling so wonderful. His Alpha would take care of him, and make him feel good and safe and he didn’t have to worry any more.
Dean grabbed the omega right at his waist, enjoying the way the way his large hands framed the beautiful curve where Castiel’s round ass met the taper of his waist, digging his thumbs into the cute little dimples that sat at the small of the omega’s back. He threw his head back and just fell into the blissful rythym of a good fuck into a well-pinned omega.
Grabbing the pan he’d made eggs in off the stove, he gave it a cursory scrub before rinsing it off. He’d wash the dishes more fully later, but right now he had an omega that no longer had a dick inside him to get back to.
“Damn right I was,” Dean said, picking Cas up and turning to lay him out on the couch between them. He didn’t bother pulling his cock out of his omega, who was whimpering and rolling his hips against Dean. Cas was flushed and beautiful, that pretty pink blooming all down his chest. Dean slid his hands up his omega’s sides and then pinched his nipples.
“Beautiful,” Dean said softly before moving to the head of the bed and sitting with his back against the headboard. He pulled Cas into his arms before settling the sniffling omega against him, the angel’s back against the hunter’s muscled chest. He spread the omega’s thighs and draped them over his own, before spreading his legs and leaving Castiel completely open to his touch.
Sam pushed the hampers of dirty laundry towards the washer and stepped up to the omega, gliding long fingers over the tight buds of Castiel’s clamped nipples. The omega let out a muffled keen, baring his throat as best he could with how immobilized he was. His bright blue eyes were dazed.
He threw open the door, and barely registered the Beta dude holding a leash before his eyes were drowning in blue. He couldn’t move his gaze from the bluest eyes he’d ever seen, large, framed with long, sweet eyelashes.
Dean slid his hand from the small of the angel’s back right between his cheeks, rubbing the pads of his fingers right against that tight, wet little hole. Cas squeaked and went even more boneless against him, hole fluttering as he huffed against the Alpha’s neck, breathing in Dean’s scent as the hunter slid his middle finger right into that tight heat. Cas jerked, moaning as he was penetrated for the first time.
“Tightest cunt I’ve ever fucked,” Dean said, rotating his hips a bit to make Cas clamp down on him to keep him inside.
I was unable to believe that what had happened that night, was had conspired between Dean Winchester and I, was simply just a pleasant conversation. It didn’t fit a single element of Dean that I’d learned thus far, so I knew there were more meanings, I just couldn’t seem to figure them out, no matter how many hours I gazed at my ceilings, counting the grooves in its popcorn surface as if I had nothing better to do with my time. But, in fact, it seemed like my time was spiraling down and out, circling the drain and teasing me with each minute that passed by where I was in Dean’s vicinity.
“It’s nothing...I just had a difficult night yesterday. That’s all,” I confessed, the partial truth I was concealing tingling at the tip of my tongue, daring to be said but refraining from admitting the whole truth to my friend. I wasn’t ready for the I-told-you’s that were sure to come my way, hot and spewed from her lips at the mere sound of her victory over me.
Dean, again, wasn’t satisfied by my answer and substituted it with his own without any sort of filter or thought as to what he was truly saying.
“Yeah, probably. Bobby said he doesn’t need me for very long today, just until around 4 o’clock I think.”
I could still pick out the very streets we’d driven down, while my hand had been cringingly, yet delicately, glued to the top of his thigh as he transported me back home. The cheesy and probably intrusive act had been done out of my complete state of “wastedness,” of course, and for twelve torturous hours during the following day I went over each element of the exchange over and over again in my blotched and scattered memory, horrified over whether Cas had really wanted to do what he’d done. My anxieties and fears, however, were eased the next evening when I got a brief phone call from the recipient of what I knew was probably my worst kiss to date asking if I was feeling okay and, as a side note, making sure I would be coming back to visit him again once I was feeling up to speed and willing to consume significantly less alcohol.
The omega couldn’t have moved even if he had wanted to, pinned by the large body behind him, bound in metal, and so all he could do was lay there and get fucked hard. He could feel the slap of the Alpha’s large balls against him and with every thrust he fell deeper deeper into a haze of submission.
Castiel barely noticed the grunting, animal noises he was making every time the Alpha’s cock slammed home, and eventually he went to that beautiful place where everything was bliss. He felt the sharp pleasure when the Alpha knotted him, and the soothing feeling of being filled with come left him limp and sated.
Castiel was limp with pleasure. His whole body felt sated and content, and he was happy to just lie quietly, stuffed with cock and being filled with come.
“Ungh, that’s good,” Dean said, throwing his head back and closing his eyes so he could savor the feel of his cock being worked by the omega’s throat. His knot unlocked further and the Alpha carefully pulled out completely, looking down just in time to see one last spurt of come splatter all over Cas’ face, which was already a mess of spit, pre-come and tears.
Castiel blinked away tears as he was filled with the first of many loads of come, looking devotedly up at the man who owned him, ready to worship him.
In response, Dean removed his fingers from the heat of his omega's wet cunt and moved his hand to the back of the angel’s neck, clenching, and Cas went completely pliant. Grabbing the collar with his other hand, he yanked it out of the way and had his fangs sheathed in Castiel before anyone could’ve reacted. He drew back and looked down at his angel, who was staring up at him adoringly and purring, the very picture of a claimed omega.
Cas jerked and wailed, spitted on Dean’s Alpha cock, his insides clenching around Dean’s cock as he was stretched wide.
The compound he’d been raised in had been so sterile, white walls and no Alpha scent at all. Some of the omegas went through sexual training, but Castiel was to remain completely untrained and untouched and so all he knew of Alphas and sex had come second hand, from whispered conversations between omegas. He’d heard horror stories of cruel Alphas and he’d been so scared when he’d been bought, that he might end up like some of the other omegas brought back to the compound.
“Thank you, Alpha,” Castiel said shyly, already feeling how relaxed and natural he felt, cradled in the metal that would keep him perfectly presented for use.
“I’m sorry, what was that?” Dean said, bouncing Cas on his dick just enough to make the omega arch and moan, pussy twitching around him.
“There you go, Cas,” Dean said, spanking his ass a few more times as the omega adjusted to what was filling him, arching as the sharp pleasure danced across his skin.
Dean dropped his jeans to the side, cock already half-hard again at the sight of his pet in his bed, body clearly telegraphing how much he wanted to be fucked hard. He climbed onto the bed, reaching for the omega's collar and taking it off. He didn't want someone else's random collar on his omega. Once he'd discarded the collar and leash, he moved until he was caging Castiel with his arms, holding himself above the panting omega. Slowly he settled his pelvis over Castiel’s erection, sinking onto the angel until they were skin to skin from shoulders to feet. Cas let out a strangled moan, his eyes fluttering as his instinctive hip movements caused him to rub his hard little cock against Dean’s.
“Sure thing, Sammy,” Dean said, dropping Cas back onto the bed and stretching. He felt fantastic, every bit of stress evaporated. Yeah. This had been a fantastic idea.
Beginning to feel a bit like I'm writing porn and flinging it out into the ether but uhhhhhh if people are still reading here's another chapter. I probably won't do Castiel POV very often, it's kind of tough when he's pretty much constantly been cock drunk and wrecked but I probably will never do Sam POV so it kind of had to happen. Plus, I thought it'd be nice to kind of check in on how the angel is feeling, which is basically, thrilled lol
“He’s very pretty, Dean,” Sam said, one hand easing down the omega’s throat to his collar bone before cupping the angel’s face. Castiel let his eyes half close as he rubbed his cheek into the Alpha’s grasp. He choked a bit as two large fingers slid deep into his mouth, his eyes meeting the Alpha’s hazel gaze. He instinctively began sucking on the fingers filling him.
After several minutes of bouncing the omega on his dick, Dean pushed Cas forward, the angel collapsing on his front, limbs noodly and unresponsive as Dean grabbed the omega’s hips and arranged him face down, ass up, wet hole presented to the Alpha.
He heard his Alpha speaking with someone and noticed the scent of another Alpha but was too hazy and comfortable to react, even when he felt his master pull him upright by his hair. Trails of drool were falling from his open mouth, and his eyelids felt too heavy to keep open. His Alpha dropped him back on the bed and Castiel just drifted, feeling his body twitch occasionally around the cock filling him.
Dean settled back on his knees, ready to wait out his knot and twitching every so often as he spurted more seed into Cas. He heard Sam before he saw him, the other Alpha walking up to Dean’s door still sweaty from his run.
“Such a good boy,” Dean said, giving his omega another firm stroke of his little cock, enjoying the quake that shuddered through Cas’ body. “We’ll have more lessons later, baby, and I know you’ll learn them just as well as you learned this one. But because you’ve been such a good boy, and because it brings me pleasure to watch you, I’m going to make you come hard.”
“That didn’t stop you from dumping a gallon of jizz all over his face, now did it sasquatch?” He pulled the plug out slowly, causing Cas to let out a sweet whimper and tilt his hips, offering up his tight cunt. The whore really loved getting fucked, which, let’s face it, was convenient for everyone involved.
Cas was wrecked, limbs sprawled out, his whole body yielding, mouth open and drooling into the sheets. His pussy spasmed around Dean’s knot every few seconds, internal muscles milking as much come as possible from the thick Alpha dick rearranging his insides.
The omega looked at him with desperate eyes, his eyelashes damp with the tears from the rough face fucking, nodding minutely and moaning. Dean could feel his knot starting to unlock from where it was lodged behind Castiel’s teeth. The hunter growled and slid his cock in and out of the angel’s stretched lips in infinitesimal thrusts, allowing his balls to slap gently against the omega’s chin as drool poured out of the angel’s mouth in messy ropes.
“Don’t be, sweetheart,” he soothed. “That’s what your hot little cunt is supposed to be doing. Means I’m doing my job, making sure you feel good.”
Dean slid a hand over the slight bulge in his jeans, rubbing through the denim as he closed his eyes and fantasized about what he’d do to the omega first. Fuck, he needed to get laid. Dean was not an Alpha that lacked for partners of any gender, but sometimes after a difficult hunt he didn’t want to spend his time sweet-talking busty Beta chicks into dropping their panties. Sometimes he just wanted to bend a slut over and fuck them until they couldn’t walk.
“And what are you here for, Cas?” Dean said, stubbornly keeping from sheathing his cock in the omega’s quivering cunt.
“You can keep your hands on your thighs, or behind your back,” Dean said, two fingers under the omega’s chin and tilting his face up a bit for a sweet kiss. “If an Alpha approaches you, drop your mouth open and be ready to take a cock down your throat.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” the omega said, looking up at the Alpha with a flutter of eyelashes. The hunter dropped another kiss right on the sweet blush of Cas’ cheekbone.
“You’re such a good fuck toy, omega,” Dean said, setting his cock right at the angel’s swollen rim. “Such a pretty set of holes for cock.” He slid just the head in and stopped, ignoring Cas’ mournful whine.
The omega let out a slutty purr in response, muffled by the massive cock that was stuffing his mouth full, eyes sharpening just enough to look up at the Alpha adoringly before he went back to working his tongue against Dean’s knot.
Dean settled himself solidly on his knees before thrusting his dick all the way into the omega with a loud smack, grabbing the angel’s arms and crossing them at the small of his back, holding on firmly as he rode the whimpering slut into the mattress. Cas was letting out a wrecked grunt every time Dean’s cock slid home, his balls slapping wetly against the pinned omega.
The Alpha started fucking, enjoying the way the omega’s cunt clenched around his dick desperately as Sam settled into a rhythm that he liked. Shortly after he started, ignoring the omega’s mewling as he was fucked hard, he realized that Dean had added hand holds that were bolted just to either side of the omega. Sam would never, ever, tell his brother, but he was a genius. The Alpha grabbed onto the hand holds and really started railing the omega, who fell completely apart, his animal grunting muffled by the fake cock that was filling his throat.
“Damn, Dean, I couldn’t have even been gone an hour!” Sam said, taking in the cock drunk omega. “How did you manage to fuck him completely brainless?”
“You can come as soon as Sam knots you, okay baby?” Dean said, continuing to pet the omega as he whimpered.
Cas was on another plane of existence, screaming himself hoarse into the sheets his face was pressed into.
Dean carried him down the hall and set him on another bed, one that smelled of a different Alpha. His Alpha tilted his chin up and kissed Castiel, and it felt so good. The omega melted, putting his arms around Dean’s neck and trying to press his body as close to his master as he could.
“Good omega,” Sam said, his rumble hitting Castiel hard. His eyes drooped and he just relaxed, enjoying the feeling of his throat being stuffed with cock. As he laid there, warming Sam’s cock with his mouth, he heard Dean’s voice and the chair next to Sam screeched as it was pulled out.
“Come, slut,” Dean said, and Cas' spine jackknifed as he came, every muscle in his body seizing and clenching around Dean, causing the Alpha’s knot to pop.
“Is there something you want, sweetheart?” Dean asked, lips quirking as his fingers sank into the angel’s hips, probably leaving bruises as he ruthlessly curbed the omega’s thrusts against him.
Sam grumbled to himself as he dragged two full hampers of laundry down to the laundry room. At least the bunker had commercial grade washing machines and dryers, impressively built monstrosities that would probably keep running through several more apocalypses.
“So, he’s yours. You requested a virgin angel, so that’s what you’ve got. He’s never been touched sexually. He hasn’t even been around Alphas before so he’s never smelled Alpha pheremones. He's as pure as it gets.”
“Yeah, okay,” the beta said, rolling his eyes. “No one’s gonna take him from you bro, I just need you to initial here to confirm that you heard what I’m telling you.”
“C’mon, baby, come back to me,” his Alpha said, chuckling. Castiel felt his body being rolled over until he was on his back, and it felt completely natural to just let his legs fall open, baring himself to his master.
“Yes, Alpha,” Castiel said, his eyelashes fluttering. Sam slid his fingers back into the omega’s mouth and this time he let his lips shape themselves around the Alpha’s large fingers, just letting them be, instead of sucking. He could please this Alpha, he knew he could.
“This is for you, baby,” Dean said, running his fingers through the omega’s thick hair and making him moan with pleasure. Castiel crawled onto the pillow and settled.
“I’m here to - unnh - to be fucked, Alpha,” Castiel moaned, eyes quickly losing coherency as Dean ruthlessly finger fucked him.
He strode into his room, not bothering to close the door, before dropping the omega onto his bed with a bounce. The angel settled onto his back and seemed to instinctively spread his legs, showing off his wet hole and tight ass to the hunter.
He reached forward to grab Cas by the hair, pulling the limp omega up. The angel’s mouth was open, drool running down his chin, eyes completely unfocused.
Dismissing the beta from his mind, Dean finally, FINALLY was able to turn all of his attention to the pretty little pet who was whimpering against him, the smell of his slick permeating the air around them. Dean carefully undid the ring gag, dropping it to the floor of the bunker. As beautiful as his slut was when gagged, now was not the time.
“That’s it, baby,” Dean said comfortingly, rubbing one of his hands over that sweet little hole and cupping Cas’ balls in his hands before stroking the omega’s cock with a firm grip. Castiel jerked, and moaned into Dean’s neck.
“Now ain’t that a sight,” Dean said, chuckling as he started stripping off his clothes. Castiel watched with wide, lust-filled eyes, but stayed where he’d been put, hips working in tiny little circles as he watched the Alpha disrobe fully.
“Such a good boy,” Dean cooed, sliding his fingers out slowly before pushing them back in gently, rolling his wrist in a circular motion while stimulating Cas’ prostate with soft touches. He was rewarded with a small gasp and then the rolling of the omega’s hips as he rocked his pelvis on Dean’s fingers, and another spine-tingling flood of slick.
Once he had the laundry started, he turned back to his gift with anticipation. The omega was sobbing, and his pussy was so wet it was dripping down the wall. Even though his mouth was stuffed full with a cock gag the omega had drooled over it so much he was sloppy and wet, and his eyes were lidded and cock drunk as he writhed and moaned against his bonds.
Dean was content to hold still, his erection growing as he watched with amusement as the desperate slut beneath him became more and more frantic, whimpers turning into moans as he worked his hips. Dean reached down and grabbed Castiel, holding him still and causing the angel to cry out in protest. Those blue eyes locked onto Dean, wordlessly begging him.
“Morning, baby,” Dean said, peppering soft kisses along Cas’ neck before pressing his lips against the angel’s eyelids and cheekbones in a featherlight caress.
“You like that, don’t you slut?” Dean said, not expecting an answer from the fucked out, mewling angel beneath him. He didn’t need an answer anyway, from the way the whore’s cunt was tightening around him as he got fucked, the omega was struggling to keep from coming. Dean could feel his knot forming, working to tie the Alpha to the omega and pump him full of come.
Dean initialed quickly and slammed the door in the delivery guy’s face. He heard a muffled “have fun!” through the door.
Dean began kissing his neck, nibbling over the omega’s mating mark and causing Castiel to shiver. He felt his Alpha’s knot unlock, and then Dean was pulling out, leaving Castiel unbearably empty. The Alpha nipped him hard on his neck and then rolled off the omega.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at his dumbass brother in disbelief. He was currently balls deep in an omega that was orgasming his brains out all over Dean’s dick and Sam wanted to play some stupid game?
He tapped his cockhead right over the omega’s soaked hole and enjoyed the sound of the wet slap as Cas jolted, letting out a low groan. He slowly slid the head of his dick past Cas’ swollen rim and paused.
Dean laughed out loud. He rarely won rock paper scissors, but when he did it never failed to make Sam salty.
Sam pulled his dick from Castiel’s mouth and began spraying thick Alpha come all over the whimpering omega’s face, grunting with every spurt. Castiel laid limp at the Alpha’s feet, letting himself getting covered with seed. It felt like it lasted forever, the omega letting out little moans of pleasure as his tongue darted to lap at the rich taste of Alpha come.
Dean joined them back on the couch, reaching out and cradling Cas’ head in his palm. Sam released the hand around Castiel’s throat and allowed the omega to lean forward towards Dean. Castiel managed a weak purr in between grunts and rubbed his cheek in Dean’s hand.
Cas beamed at him, his blue eyes bright and happy. His scent was all honeyed arousal and ocean breezes, making the kitchen smell absolutely amazing. Fuck, but he was really getting attached to this sweet omega.
He pulled the coffee carafe out of the maker and rinsed it out, smiling to himself as he heard Sam’s satisfied grunt and a quiet, rumbling “good omega”. After all of the “we don’t really need an omega, Dean” and “what if the omega gets in the way of hunting” bullshit that Sam had been spouting, Dean was working hard to keep a nice, smug “I told you so” from passing his lips.
Dean undid his jeans and brought out his hard cock. He slid the head over that hungry little hole, coating it with slick before sliding it just past the rim. The hunter grabbed the angel by the hips and held him up at a better height for fucking, strong hands digging into the omega and leaving him dangling, the tips of his toes brushing the kitchen floor.
“I’m here to be - unnh - fucked,” Castiel cried out, little sobs falling from his lips, his hips frantic against Dean’s hands.
The omega licked his lips, tasting Alpha come for the first time with a hungry look on his pretty face, before staring up at Dean and dropping his mouth open again, silently asking for more.
Eventually, he registered his Alpha’s knot unlocking, and then he was empty. He let out a mournful whimper, twitching his hips up to try feebly to get it back in him. A hand pet through his hair and he closed his eyes at the blissful feeling.
Dean cradled the crown of the angel’s head in one broad hand and stroked the other down the omega’s neck, squeezing slightly so he could savor the feel of his cock sheathed firmly in Castiel’s throat. He ran his fingers along side the omega’s brand new mating mark, a bone deep feeling of completeness bursting from him with a satisfied rumble.
In his opinion, this is what omegas should look like all the time, drooling and fucked out, cunts dripping with come and slick, and spread open for another knot.
“That’s right,” Dean said, proud of his sweet boy. “You don’t need to ask. You don’t need to beg. Because I’ll let you come when I want, and only then. If you come when I haven’t told you to, you will be punished.”
“You were made for this, baby,” the hunter said, his hands gripping the angel’s hair in a tight fist. “Built specifically to take my cock.”
He yanked the leash and the omega fell into him, eyes wide and dark, panting slightly as his smaller form plastered against Dean’s muscled frame.
The Alpha picked him up, carrying Castiel effortlessly through the bunker, with the omega rubbing against Dean and purring the whole way.
“Suck,” Sam said simply and Castiel began sucking the cock deep in his mouth, moaning with pleasure at the taste and feel. He worked his tongue along the hard dick, before the fist in his hair held him still and Sam began fucking his face, hard, balls slapping against his chin. The omega tried his best not to choke as he was brutally face fucked, tears gathering in his eyes, and his body went completely slack, allowing the Alpha to use his mouth.
He kissed Castiel’s temple and sighed happily as the omega started purring. Dean already couldn’t imagine a life without Castiel.
“You did good, sweetheart,” Dean said, stroking the scent glands on the inside of the omega’s thighs. Cas mewled, turning his face into Dean’s neck and rubbing his nose against the gland in Dean’s neck.
Eventually, though, he sighed and withdrew his soaked hand and left the omega wailing and trying to undulate his hips as he turned to the laundry. He sorted the different loads with a small smile on his face as the desperate omega behind him squirmed and whined.
Didn't want you to have to wait long to find out what Dean had planned for Sam's laundry day! So here it is. Also, look, Sam POV! Something I didn't think I'd ever do lol
“Okay, shoot,” he said with a smirk, adding another finger into the tight little ass of his fuck toy. He felt around for the omega’s prostate until the angel shuddered and moaned and then finger fucked the squirming omega while he drooled into Dean’s neck and humped against him.
“You like that, angel?” He said, watching as those blue eyes met his, completely cock drunk and dazed.
“Fuck, ungh,” he grunted, before he held Cas against his balls and emptied down his throat, knot catching behind the omega’s teeth. The angel stayed pliant, swallowing Dean’s seed as the Alpha groaned.
“If I’m cleaning the kitchen, then you’re doing the laundry, bitch,” Dean shot back, before closing his eyes and picking up the pace. Every time he slammed in, balls slapping against that wet pussy, Cas grunted with satisfaction, and soon was singing a chorus of “unh, unh, unh” as he got fucked hard.
The Alpha spanked the angel’s sweet little ass, hard, watching in satisfaction as the omega let out a strangled grunt and arched his back even harder. Dean amused himself for a few minutes warming his hand on Cas’ pretty ass, enjoying the noises coming from his pet as the pink from the spanking spread across the angel’s ass cheeks. He untied Castiel’s hands and the omega didn’t try to escape, just tucked his arms against his body and gripped the bedsheets in his fists as he cried.
Castiel mewled helplessly, choking around the thick Alpha dick as it fucked his face. He wanted to come so badly, but no one had given him permission.
“I know you like that, slut,” Dean gasped, his balls twinging at a particularly pleasurable spasm of the omega’s throat around his dick.
“To be - unnh - to be fucked,” Cas grunted, “Alpha, please, please - ” Castiel’s pleading turned into garbled wail as Dean fucked into him with a hard smack. He kept one hand on the omega’s waist and used the other to grab the angel’s hair in a tight fist, keeping him immobile as he fucked Cas as hard as possible.
“Fuck, baby, you smell like heaven,” Dean groaned, putting his nose right against the angel’s scent gland in his neck and breathing deep. It was partly covered by the collar and Dean wanted to tear it apart with his teeth and replace it with a bite. The omega whimpered, swaying against him. Dean wrapped an arm around the small of Castiel’s back and slid a thigh right between the angel’s legs. He pulled Cas tight against him and licked his neck as the omega moaned. He could feel the omega’s small cock hardening against him.
The omega was pinned to the wall, arms stretched above him, and his knees spread wide and attached to the concrete, leaving his wet hole completely exposed. He had a cock gag muffling his whimpers and his nipples were clamped. The delicious smell of omegan arousal was almost overwhelming.
Cas just looked up at him in confusion, tears forming again in those beautiful blue eyes as he panted against the Alpha.
“Fine, but you’re cleaning the kitchen, jerk,” Sam said, leaning back in his chair and watching the omega’s eyes roll back in his head as Dean slid all the way home.
Dean leaned back, letting the omega’s face up from the mattress, and listened to him wail with every sharp thrust.
He stroked his hands down Castiel’s sweaty back. The omega was still twitching around the knot that was stuffing him full.
“One, two, three, shoot,” Sam said, before throwing scissors. Dean held up his fist clenched in rock in triumph.
“Unghhhh,” Castiel groaned out, drooling against Dean. Dean slapped him on the other thigh, causing the angel to jolt and cry out.
Turning back to the table he ducked his head and took in the sight of Castiel, purring and leaning into Sam’s leg, looking every inch a happy omega as Sam ran fingers through his messy hair.
“Dean,” Sam said, stretching out his absurdly giant body and cracking his neck. “Can I use his cunt?”
“Do you understand, Cas?” Dean asked again. The omega squirmed against him before saying in a small voice, “you’re going to tell me what I did wrong.”
Dean Winchester sighed and checked his watch, before turning back to his laptop and refreshing the delivery tracking website yet again. The page reloaded, only to show the tracker still hopelessly stuck somewhere in bumfuck Kansas cornfields. Dean rubbed a hand along his jaw and cursed the GPS gods yet again for forgetting that Kansas was a place. A place where impatient Alphas might be waiting to finally claim the Omega Angel they recently bought from Heaven Inc. The hunter threw back the last of his whiskey just as his brother Sam walked into the library.
Cas leaned into him, purring. Dean tossed the smaller man over his shoulder and stood, the angel’s startled yelp making him smile. He smacked his hand onto Castiel’s round ass, just to hear that noise again. The omega obliged with another yelp, then began wiggling temptingly, his thighs covered with the slick that was pouring from his slutty cunt. Dean slapped him right over his swollen hole, enjoying the wet sound and the strangled moan the angel let out before the omega went completely pliant.
As if on cue, the dryers behind him let out the buzz that let him know that his loads were done and he spent a few minutes dumping clean, warm clothes into the hampers. He’d drag them upstairs and make himself a sandwich before watching TV and folding.
“It’s okay, baby,” his master said, sliding two fingers into the omega’s fucked out cunt. “This is what all omegas are like.”
“That’s for you, baby,” the Alpha said, before sliding two fingers into Castiel’s fucked out hole. The omega arched instinctively, chasing the pleasure of those fingers and it caused his body to fall into place, and he settled comfortably, despite being cuffed.
“You like that, sweetheart?” Dean asked, petting his fingers through Cas’ wild hair as the Alpha settled himself on his knees.
Sam could admit it to himself, even if he probably wouldn’t admit it to Dean, getting an omega for their personal use at home had been a great idea.
“Good boy,” Dean said, fucking the omega with solid thrusts, enjoying the soft mewls that fell from Castiel’s lips with every pound of Dean’s cock. He rolled the omega under him, straddling the angel’s thighs with Cas’ legs beneath him lying straight in one long tempting line.
Dean was feeling pretty fucking good. He was enjoying a Star Wars marathon with his brother, there were no current apocalypses, and Cas was cuddled up on him, draped over his chest and purring, while his tight little pussy warmed Dean’s cock. The Alpha took a moment to pet down the angel’s spine, enjoying the spike of affectionate purring that rumbled in his ear. He’d known that having a pet would be awesome, but this was pretty goddamn blissful. The scent of content, aroused omega made Dean feel mellow as hell and he just basked in the feeling of having everything he could ever want right here with him in one room.
Sam let out an appreciative rumble and removed his fingers, pulling out a chair and sitting comfortably.
Dean Winchester was not a cuddler, but even he had to admit that waking up with a purring, well-fucked omega in his arms wasn’t the worst thing in the world. He nuzzled his nose against the omega’s neck, basking in the happy pheremones. He pressed his mouth gently over Castiel’s mating mark, nibbling over it before kissing his way up his angel’s smooth neck and grinding his erection against the sleeping omega.
“Good boy,” Dean said, smirking, and headed down the stairs. As much as it might be fun for Sam to come home to their new toy face down and ass up taking a knot in what passed for the bunker’s foyer, Dean had other plans, plans that involved a bed.
He walked into the laundry room and stopped dead, eyes taking in the naked omega bolted to the wall with a growing smile. Sometimes he really did appreciate his jerk of a brother and his skill with a drill.
He didn’t give another thought to the passed out omega, knowing Dean would come collect his toy whenever he felt like using it again.
He felt his orgasm starting to tingle deep in his balls and slowed down. He wasn’t quite ready for it all to be over. He looked down to where Cas was whimpering beneath him, pulling his cock all the way out and spreading the angel’s cheeks to enjoy the sight of the omega’s pink cunt, glistening with slick and clenching around nothing. Castiel bucked weakly, tilting his hips in an effort to get the Alpha’s cock back into him.
Dean rolled his eyes. He knew that it had been him that had really wanted a beautiful angel pet, but the fact that Sam preferred running in circles in rural Kansas rather than be on hand when their new pet arrived was batshit crazy in his opinion.
“There you are, sweetheart,” Dean said, pinching his nipple again and causing the omega to jerk at the pain, which was still somehow pleasure. He began whining, his hips rolling in gentle circles at the sensation, which made him feel achy and strange, heat from his nipples traveling down to his cock.
Leaving one hand wrapped around the omega’s wrists, he grabbed Cas’ hair with the other and pressed his face firmly into the mattress, leaving the angel arched obscenely.
“If you want to return him, you have seven days. If you return him without fucking him, you can get three quarters of the price but as soon as you fuck him, you can only get half of your money back, capisce?”
“You’re so pretty when you beg, baby,” Dean said, predatory smile widening. “But you’re misinformed.”
Dean closed his eyes and threw his head back, settling into a nice steady pace that was slower than normal. Today was about basking. There was no need to rush to orgasm, because Cas was his and he wasn’t going anywhere and Dean could fuck him ten times a day if he wanted to. Right now he was going to savor every sensation of being buried deep in his omega, the scent, the feel, the sound of balls slapping as his omega was spitroasted between two Alphas.
I thought my statement had driven the point home well, strong, and true, and left no room for error or retaliation. I should’ve planned better though, knowing Charlie’s knack for debate and always being correct in situations similar to the painful one I was trapped in, and she still shocked me with her reply. Her reply blew me backwards, into next week, and into a defeated sort of submission.
But Cas redefined the expanse of such words, the worth of the phrase, the power its confirmation holds over them both. Dean wants to take a stab at it.
“Oh, well, I know some but...it’s never really been-it’s never really been something that I’m very well-versed in…”
But then a strange scent made its way towards me, teasing my memory and wrapping its fumes around my mind until the picture to go with it faded from the smoke into clarity. Gasoline and car grease.
“I’ve told him my name a good six times, simply because he asked for it…” I murmured, still confused as to what the man’s motives were. I should’ve been intrigued, of course, in finding out, but it didn’t seem of much purpose to me then.
“You know, that’s usually the thing people do when they like someone,” was her response. While I had made the few steps backwards to regain even a fraction of my desired personal space back, she’d remained in place and the smile spreading wide and true across her cheeks made her even more difficult to face by the second. I hated feeling so looked down upon, but that was not the only disliked feeling within my mind at that moment. There were several, and Charlie’s words only made them more and more apparent.
He’d expressed to me, more upfront and directly than ever before, how he knew he’d failed his family, especially his brother. It was then that I could see the remnants of what John Winchester had planted within Dean’s hand: the notion that he really was worthless and had failed their family, when in reality I couldn’t think of a better person. There had been a time where I’d thought my support and admiration of Dean was illogical and had gone too far, but I knew now he deserved every bit of it and more. He was just struggling to see it.
The dark eyed man, the hue of his irises deepened by the circles under his eyelids and the shadows his deep brow was casting downward, nodded his head vigorously after being reminded of my name, which I’d told him a good six times that evening, and I imagined myself rolling my own tired eyes in annoyance. I held them still, however, choosing politeness over my irritation’s relief.
Kevin laughed dryly, a laugh that I’d come to know was one of sarcasm and didn’t actually mean humor had entered the conversation.
Sam said it was a great idea, and that he couldn’t wait to see me in one of “those black kinda-dresses that haircutters tie around their waists,” meaning aprons, and scampered off to find something to watch on TV. With his giggling form went the last of my good spirits and the last bits of any optimism I had though, and the scattered, broken sounds of his cartoons served as irritating background noise as I cleaned up the mess his hair had made across the bathroom floor.
It took me a moment to remember that she couldn’t see my angered expression, my usual response to her endless remarks and one-liners, and forced myself to hash out a satisfactory text of annoyance to her.
And just as he had a week ago, Dean Winchester turned his head a full one-hundred and eighty degrees, leaning against the wooden doorframe with the chipping and peeling paint, and gave me one long look of green and amber and a brokenness that just wasn’t clear. It was hazy and undefined and very, very wholesomely cohesive. It consumed him until, it seemed, that there wasn’t any salvageable pieces to understand.
Somewhere throughout the night, the online-aliased man mentioned something about his cousin finding the profile and showing awkwardly flirtatious interest, a detail that I figured was a highlight of the saga I’d been listening to for a good twelve minutes, but I had to cut him off, if only briefly. The last of Dean Winchester’s double scotch, with no ice, had passed his lips, and, if my time with him proved to be historically correct, he was definitely not there for just one drink.
I couldn’t marvel over the way Dean carried himself: with long strides but hunched shoulders, a sign that I took was of confliction, or the way his leather jacket fell expertly across his broad wingspan, or the way in which he downed drinks that caused the muscles in his throat to contract and release like the machine I’d so closely compared him to. Except, upon reconsideration, there was little mechanical about Dean. He was painfully human, and that’s where a lot of his problems seemed to lay, and that’s why I didn’t have time to daydream about such things. I was distracted by the fact that he’d had a childhood full of someone else’s, how his brother Sammy had essentially been dumped onto those very hunched shoulders, and how he’d never once complained. He still didn’t, twenty-two years later. And how, when Sammy left to do what Dean had encouraged him to chase after his whole life, the rest of Dean’s life had been shipped out to California along with his brother.
The sinking of my heart and the urge to sigh, one that I fought tooth-and-nail to repress, had me convinced that whatever conversation I’d somehow managed to stay engaged in had ended, and in something resembling a trainwreck. I’d blown my chances, let them crash and burn, and it was all I could do not to shrink away and fall back behind the safe walls of the kitchen, perhaps confide in Charlie in hope of lessening my embarrassment. Whatever “I told you so’s” she could conjure up were certainly worth an escape route…
No. Zero-sum implied two losers, both he and the greater Beyond. Surely the Big-U Universe wanted him limp and breathless. Why else would this be happening? Why else would his fingers be losing their feeling? God, the tingle was infectious. He craved for it to spread and to quell the hurt. It wouldn’t be long. If he could just close his eyes…
I knew it was cheesy, something straight out of all those damned chick-flick movies Cas’s partner-in-bartending-crime Charlie Bradbury had gotten him temporarily hooked on, but I couldn’t help but routinely think back to that fateful Sunday night and reminisce over how sheerly crazy and revolutionary it had been. The expected outcome of what was such a dreadfully anticipated day had been thrown out the window, balled up into an unrecognizable mass and forgotten, all because I’d come crawling back to the one person in my life who seemed to be willing to hear me out, let me lean on them, and all because that person had been feeling a bit more daring than usual.
The actions that followed my dad’s final, closing arguments are still, to this day, a blur of shouts, beer, and the rush to grab my coat and leave.
Soon, however, I remembered that I had to speak as well, and threw out some sort of courteous reply that I could come up with on the spot. All the skills my boss had taught me so long ago when I'd first started working at that small corner pub, like the small smile of politeness now engrained into my very face, were escaping me and it was sending my mind into an unnatural panic mode.
I didn’t know. The lady obviously felt some kind of emotion for the man, or her makeup wouldn’t be running and she wouldn’t be on her fifth glass of wine with tears in her eyes. I gave the lady one last look and, again, couldn’t understand her emotion if the love wasn’t real.
“That’s...damn it, that’s not what I meant, you asshole,” I grumbled, though was trying my best to share in the laughs.
“No...no Charlie, don’t apologize,” I stammered as I stitched my reply together in a way that would include each point I wanted to make in a way that wasn’t too insensitive or factual. “It’s fine, truly. I know you were only joking. I shouldn’t have taken it so harshly.”
I agreed with him very strongly and thus earned a pleasing tip that I slid in the same pocket of my pants that held my cellphone, and the increased weight caused my pants to pull down even further along my waist. A little flustered, I began adjusting my belt, pulling the clip loose for just a moment as I yanked the other side tight. It took too many moments, however, to fit the belt into its new loop and I stood fiddling for an embarrassingly long amount of time. I hoped Kevin couldn’t see me, and I hoped that whoever had just entered the pub wasn’t too judgmental of my compromising state. The doorbell gave out a harsh ding, one that somehow stood out from all the clergymen and women around me.
“cool, see u then. oh-remember to keep an eye 4 that mystery dude. who knows? maybe he comes more often than just thursdays.”
Dean Winchester and Castiel are standing under the cover of scant darkness together. Dean’s wounds are healed; Cas is clean of the Empty’s blackish sludge. Things feel real. They feel fair. His jaw relaxes.
I heard my own footsteps creak their way across the rickety hardwood floor as I approached the door, and I pretended like my dad’s shrieks of rage were nothing more than Sam’s cartoons buzzing around in the back of my head, background noise to an equally as somber, defeated scene.
Maybe compliance wasn’t too bad when Dean was asking for it though, and his interest translated in my mind into some kind of stranger-to-stranger care, and maybe after all the people I’d had the pleasure, and sometimes the pain, of listening to, I could confide in someone else for a change. It wasn’t me who’d asked for it, of course. I was just answering Dean’s inquiries so as to prevent him from being an unhappy customer. My job.
Dean's voice sounded just like he should have, in my opinion after having invasively stared at him for the past few hours or so. It was deep and rough around the edges, like its noise was reverberating around in his chest and rasping as it did so, but no amount of gruffness could take away from the firm and present intent his speech had. I imagined, from those three words, that whatever Dean S. Winchester said was always taken seriously.
The walk in the chilled rain had started at the pub, after I’d closed up shop for the fourth day in a row since Charlie’s want to alleviate me of the task seemingly evaporated into thin air and memory, once the clock had chimed one in the morning and Dean Winchester had left the premises a little more sober than usual. I liked to attribute the increased amount of coherent thoughts and the lack of dangerous alcohol pumping in his system to the awkward yet slightly charming and kind conversation we’d kept going for the better part of two hours. It was one of the few pleasantries that kept my spirits from falling into the murky puddles below my feet on my journey homeward.
I don’t think I answered in the way that was appropriate, which would be something resembling a “you’re welcome,” and there followed a brief yet awkward silence that I felt sting the air around me until my scrambling for something to help the conversation resurface. Unfortunately, Dean’s passion was not something that I found myself well-versed in.
“As much as alcohol helps, Dean Winchester, I think what you need most is someone to listen to whatever has got you in this state. It can really help, trust me.”
“Oh, you shoulda seen him and Sammy,” he started, and the tears in my heart grew deeper at his denial, at his dismissal of his own pain.
“Don’t mention it,” he stated as though it had been rehearsed dozens of times. He was walking towards the door now, and instead of the sound of his feet against floorboards sending excitement running through my veins, it was an omen of loss, of a goodbye that I wasn’t prepared for yet. What had that stare meant? What was I supposed to do?
And with that, Kevin gripped Charlie’s keys in his forever-shaking hand and walked, half backwards, towards the rear entrance of the pub, shooting me uncertain, partially guilty, and all-together confused looks as he went. No amount of desperation or soundless pleading from me could convince him to stay, it seemed like, and I was forced to simply listen to the sound of his fading footsteps until the back door had closed and Charlie’s vision immediately flicked onto my still form, the gaze so heated that I had to turn away.
“He did mention something about the coming of Christ,” I answered, slyly, taking the opportunity to be humorous in strides and as a great comfort. “But the hell and sin part is to come within the next week or so, I believe, so he’s just preparing now I suppose.”
I watched as Dean’s hand rose high into the air, and as he used the other to support himself on the doorframe, and he waved to me with an air of such casual departure that it nearly drove me mad. I felt like a piece of me was being severed while he was about to stumble drunkenly out of the door without so much as a care in the world. And yet, I could only gaze on and replicate the gesture of carefreeness. Of friendship.
I dipped my head, not in a prideful way, but one of relief and acknowledgement. I’d done my job for the night.
Dean nodded his head and then ran his hands through his strangely disorderly hair, its appearance most likely brought about by the weather dragging on mercilessly outside, yet it seemed as though everything about him was deteriorating in a way that I couldn’t grasp how to help stop. It was absolutely maddening, almost as maddening as the strain and the pauses in his voice.
“And thanks again Cas. Really. You’re...I-uh, thanks,” he decided on. The tail end of the sentence was said with uncertainty but he quickly shook it off.
“Once we lost Mom, I KNOW it was hard. I can’t imagine what it was like having Dean and I on your own. But she left us to you, she trusted you. You broke that trust, Dad! You broke it-no, you break it every time you pick up a beer and drink too much. Every time you get a little too out of it. That’s why we’re here now! If you’d only-”
“I wasn’t gonna deny it anyways,” he chuckled. The black car door opened and closed with a click and a loud slam, and then there he was, standing inches away from me with red cheeks and full lips upturned into a smirk of knowledge, of preparedness for what he wanted to come, and it was beginning to feel like we were in a scene from one of Charlie’s romance novels. The snow and the chilled air served as a sufficient backdrop and I couldn’t shake all her tormenting about bloody soulmates away, so I embraced it, much like Dean’s warm, soothing left hand embraced my own and how my right hand found its own way onto the small of his waist and hung there, unsure and terrified and immobile because surely I was having a heart attack and was about to melt into nothingness on the spot.
He paused, but the pause was too short for me to act upon, and he who created the conversation’s lull beat me to it.
“Yeah. You’re right. We’re…God, we’re stupid. Sam was tracking this hunt, we were lost back at the bunker, we drove in here without a plan. Without a thought. I guess…you know, we’re so damn used to having backup these days that we forgot what it’s like to fight alone.”
I’d met several mechanics and car junkies over the years. Their outward appearance was always rather predictable: unkempt hair, neckbeards of some sort, tired eyes, and very able hands. Their movements were often heavy, but they approached most everything as if it were a problem that could be fixed with a little bit of elbow grease and sweat. This included conversations with me, because whenever they were asked a trying question they dissected it, examined it, and tried to find the best route of repair. Most often they were just trying to repair their egos.
weren’t sacred. They were being cut down the middle by a lumbering younger sibling who looked as though someone had cut a hole in their chest and was yanking out their heartstrings one by one.
“Damn it...yeah, I know…” I muttered angrily and I arched my arm backwards to reach into my pants’ back pocket where my phone was ringing profusely and at the most inconvenient of times. Without reading the number displayed across its screen I answered the call, breathing my introduction heavily and awkwardly into the speaker until I was sure whoever was on the other end would be entirely convinced that I’d just been running some sort of marathon.
“Hey, you sure you brought the pretzels? I looked everywhere but I didn’t see any-” Kevin began, a worrisome glint in his dark eyes. Charlie extinguished it swiftly.
“It’s not really an offer, I’m afraid,” I retorted. Soon after I backed up a step, because Dean was about to exit his vehicle. I could see his hands linger around the inside door handle, the same hands that had lingered around mine, and I shivered with something other than the cold.
Dean continued to ramble on about his reluctance to be so “touchy,” apologizing several times over for his dumping of problems and reassuring me he wasn’t so emotional all the time, that he had a backbone, that it was the alcohol talking, and maybe I would’ve believed him, had I not done such a great job in understanding his quirks.
Wow...this part is a monster both in length and in content. I hope its endlessness did not detract too much from your enjoyment. Thank you for your support thus far, and don't worry, by the end of this story, Dean and Cas will do more than awkwardly converse.
“John, you’re talkin’ a boat-load ah nonsense,” Bobby insisted, finally catching Dad’s eyes and sending him a forbidding, dangerous look, though my father wasn’t in the state of mind to properly receive it. “Just shut up before you say somethin’ that you’ll regret, okay?”
“Don’t Fridays get kinda boring though?” he inquired with something close to a scowl as he observed the remaining customers now spread out far and wide across the hardly vast landscape we both were standing in the center of. “I mean, it seems like the same kinda people come in over ‘n over again.”
“Nah...that’s not what it was. I think it was just ‘cuz I didn’t want to be left alone at home after so many years.”
Upon receiving his latest beverage, Dean eyed it up thoughtfully, though I wasn’t sure what was so captivating about a glass of rusty liquid at the time, and clutched it firmly, his long fingers wrapping around its whole. And, in a volley of very deliberate and very desperate movements, he threw the drink back and swallowed it hole. The burn it must’ve caused couldn’t have been pleasant, but it was the result of that burning that Dean needed to get through his rendition of his childhood: an absent, worry-free mind, free of the chance of consequence.
He was obviously furious. His hands were shaking around his glass, fingers trembling and seemingly unable to hold still, more than mine had been during that drink’s preparation. I saw him grind his teeth together so fiercely it nearly made me flinch. Each sip was followed by a loud exhale of hot air, like steam creating as an after product of that motor I concluded was running within him. And when I stood close enough, I could feel and hear his left foot tap against the floor, but it wasn’t to the subtle tune of the song playing in the background of all the background’s noise. It was his own little beat, his own tune, which happened to be one that I struggled to keep up with.
I knew that the stuttering in my dad’s speech was brought on by nothing but the lack of oxygen in his brain and the poison making its own way through his bloodstream, but I liked to entertain the thought of his words failing him. This argument, like I said, had happened many times before, and each time I allowed myself to pretend that my father was failing in putting together full, coherent sentences because he knew what Sam was saying had some right to it. And yet, at the same time, I wished Sam would shut up. There was just nothing in the world to gain from the yelling and I couldn’t bear to think of him leaving again, being thrown from my dad’s latest dwelling, and finish the deja-vu session I was trapped in.
“Is everything alright?” I chimed, emanating as much casual, platonic, and still stranger-like concern as I possibly could without my voice trembling at how false it was. “You seem a little out of it, if you don’t mind me asking.”
“Oh, a guy you met at the bar, you say?” Sam continued, and all the glares in the world wouldn’t get rid of the gleam his own eyes possessed, the one that knew he’d backed me into what he considered to be a pretty amusing corner, and I rarely agreed.
He was obviously stressed, or he wouldn’t be hunched over with a crease in his brow staring at a dent in the bar’s surface, seemingly unable to give off any true emotions or let out even the smallest puff of steam. So I imagined cars and repairing them came as a hobby, a reliever of that impending stress, and he probably owned one that he was awfully proud of. (I’d once met a man who drove a classic Volkswagen Beetle that his father had bestowed upon him after passing of cancer, and he then proceeded to down an infamous number of shots and crash the car into the telephone pole just outside the pub. He was uninjured and I got to make my first 911 call on the job.)
He was crazy, drunk, his statements driven by his craziness and polluted by his drunkenness. My head turned to one side in confusion, my eyes squinting as if trying to understand what he could’ve possibly meant by such a remark, and where it had even come from in the first place. My searches proved rather fruitless, however, since the alcohol proved to be a sufficient enough shield. Everything I could’ve gathered from his sentence could be blamed on the mundane poison working through his system, so no matter what I bothered to observe or analyze, he was still drunk. People said stupid things when they were drunk. That was the same for every night of the week, and Thursdays were no exception.
I’d failed in my favorite game of learning the Thursday night tragedies’ stories and troubles, and Dean Winchester had brought upon that loss. I hadn’t been able to learn his story and analyze the reasons behind his presence and his volley of drinks, and I could barely even bring him to speak as he threw back the contents of each glass and bottle.
“I’m glad to hear that you and your brother are doing well again, Dean,” I said, noting my voice was now a whisper of shaking sincerity mixed with the sensation of walking on glass.
And I had been able to tell that the day was not typical from the moment the sun had gleamed through the window, so I suppose Cas’s general mood and willingness to go a little too far for eight in the morning shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me, but no one would’ve been able to completely handle his hands snaking their way around my waist, his brute force in prying my lips open, and I felt lost and engulfed in a way only Castiel could make feel safe and okay.
I wasn’t lying, at least not at that point in time. But immediately after those words had passed my lips, I began thinking too much and regretted letting Dean bring my family up. The flashbacks gave me too big of a headache to focus much and I had to be concentrated if I wanted to succeed, and at that point it seemed as though Dean was racing ahead of me. I was left helplessly struggling to keep up while I was swimming through the sound of each of my brothers’ voices, confused as to why I could remember Michael’s most vividly and Gabriel’s the least.
He’d truly been to hell and back, if he wasn’t still stuck on the journey home. Whether it be his lack of a father, the way he really did raise ‘Sammy’ to be the amazing young man Dean described him to be, what happened to their late mother, or just the constant pressure he was under from John Winchester even so many years later. He felt trapped, confined within the grasp of his estranged dad, and he’d tried to make something of a point earlier that day, but had failed miserably. His father wasn’t having any of it and Dean couldn’t understand it.
Sam flung the bottle in my dad’s face, waving it just under his upturned and flaming red nose, as though he was wafting the fumes into his nose in generous helpings. John Winchester didn’t even flinch and remained unblinking, stiff like a soldier.
“Well...look at it like this: you ever get so used to somethin’, somethin’ bad and probably unhealthy, that it becomes a norm in your life? You expect it to be there, and it’s weird when it’s not?”
Dean paused at the door as his right arm fell onto the frame for support. In a long, drawn out movement, he turned his figure around once more to face me, and the face I was met with was rather shocking and drastically different from its appearance at the start of that long night.
“I guess I’ve taken your hypothesis on my feelings about Dean Winchester to heart and, well, I suppose, theoretically, there could be more there than just a platonic interest, but I know that such a feeling is not mutual, which is totally, absolutely okay,  and I don’t expect-”
Eventually I’d gotten around to asking Dean how he’d come to know my name. I didn’t find it odd, mostly just a step toward mutual familiarity and, dare I say it, some warped kind of trust where only one half of the party was sober. Dean informed me that he’d heard “your redhead coworker over there,” obviously referring to Charlie, use it and “figured you wouldn’t really mind.” He was right. I couldn’t mind less, and I gawked at the three times within that Sunday evening where he even shortened my name, like he had that previous Thursday, into Cas.
My whining was half-heartedly remedied by a weak frown into my bottom lip, and despite my false attempt at sounding at all vexatious, I couldn’t help but relish in the light grind of stubble against my lower cheek and chin and the beginnings of consciousness fading back into my partner’s eyes. The same sunlight that had woken me earlier had even more magical effects on those eyes, and just like that the day was destined to not only be good, but maybe even great.
“Geez, Castiel, get a grip! You’re obviously into the guy. I can see how you look at him! He’s totally gorgeous, with those damn green eyes and rugged jawline. I would be right there with ya, if I was into that sort of thing…”
Sam had seen the drop fall to the floor as well and attempted to busy himself with the sight of it, trying his best to avoid the question in a way I rarely ever saw him do. If I remembered correctly, which I did, it was Sam who’d always been the advocate for telling the truth and confronting things head on, and he’d never been one to shrink away from Dad’s challenges. Why in hell was he starting then?
Charlie shot me her own kind of smile, one full of knowing and amusement, and I often found myself subject to that gaze. I pushed its somewhat demeaning nature aside as she approached me, dropping that same lively voice down to something resembling a whisper.
“Here, will you do me a big favor?” She continued with too much enthusiasm in her voice to be considered normal, but I suppose Kevin hadn’t known her long enough to detect it, or perhaps I was just being my insane, analytical self, the self that gotten me into that current mess.
“You make me happy,” Dean whispers before reaching back to Cas’s coat and closing their distance between them. It’s not just physical space that cleared, either; it’s years of unspoken truths, of quietude, of fleeting grazes, of sacrifices, of grace, of damnation, of tears, of anger, of hurt, of separation, reunion, embraces, scars, blood, stab wounds, Heaven, Hell, the tattered remains of a story that an angel of the deceased Almighty Lord had shriveled to pieces in Dean Winchester’s name.
A real chance? A real chance at what? I started to question whether her motives and mine were on the same page anymore, but couldn’t bring myself to speak up, so I waited and listened, suppressing every objection and every embarrassment I felt.
I took a long, crisp inhale of tense air into my lungs, letting the energy within it light up my lungs, before speaking once more, hoping it would drive home the point.
Yet even through my fascination, and minor worry, I observed. He was obviously an angry person, and the emotion seemed relatively common for him to experience. He obviously thought he knew how to deal with it: coming to a bar and drinking it away until the cause of the meanness and the frustration was as blurred as his vision. He appeared to me like a man of destructive repetition, my reasoning played out in front of me.
“It’s kinda like that, I guess. Without my dad and all the shit he put us through, I wasn’t sure who I was. If dad was fine ‘n great, I wouldn’t know how to be a brother to Sammy, or how to do things on my own, or how to be strong. If he hadn’t done what he did, I guess that would mean I couldn’t teach Sammy how to not do those things. So...in some twisted as fuck way...it was worth it. He turned out alright, didn’t he?”
Dean was actually the one who reminded me of this, and had he not I would’ve kept listening far into the early morning hours until my eyes drooped shut with exhaustion. Once he finished telling me his potential career in cosmetology that Sam had suggested too many years ago, he nodded towards the clock hanging on the wall behind us with a bittersweet look on his face.
“That’s not why you’re here,” I corrected him, adamant in making my point. “If...if you need to talk about anything, you know I’ll listen.”
Even if I wanted to speak up, even if I wanted to voice whatever inner demons I’d had locked in some backwards hall of my heart, I wouldn’t know where to start. I didn’t know how to break away from my dad’s grip, how to pry open his fingers from around my shoulders and throat until the force left pinkened fingerprints in my skin. And perhaps the reaction was psychosomatic, but I felt my own hands crawl upwards along my neck and rest on its back, fitting in the place where those markings had appeared so many years ago.
“And then there’s me,” I concluded, eager to snap out of memories that I hadn’t gotten the chance to think about or relive in ages, and I remembered why.
I stumbled backwards one more half-step to avoid Charlie and I’s noses nearly colliding and managed to croak out the epicenter of my current confusion.
This wasn’t fair. He’d never been treated fairly. Standing before the blazing effigy of his childhood home, Dean Winchester had never been treated fairly. And maybe that was his “okay,” but Castiel was paying the price, and never had Dean wanted to revolt for something more. Yet through clenched teeth, the universe forbade it.
It had been months since I’d seen my father in person, going on a year, actually, and while I sent him monthly checks to make sure he had some sort of roof over his head, and while I still thought about what exactly it was that I was leaving behind (before I met Cas, the definition of family was something that I ashamedly held onto, and it was a hard thing to have torn from one’s grasp.), it didn’t hurt quite as bad as I’d expected it to. It was liberating at times, especially when those times were spent with elbow grease and a mix of oil and sweat running down my forehead, or hearing of all the wild campus stories Sam had to tell me, usually only consisting of something a professor told him, because he was never truly able to shake the “teachers’ pet “ title since at least the fourth grade, or leaning against the bar I’d come to know so well in my signature spot, chatting up the redhead waitress in a way that was entirely casual and friendly while I snuck every chance I could get to talk to the dark-haired, blue-eyed bartender,
“You better shut your damn mouth boy,” Dad growled, low and rumbling, and he was barely even slurring anymore. “If you know what’s good for you. You have no clue what you’re talking about. You have no idea what it was like, losing Mary, and being stuck with-”
In only a few short moments, as promised, I’d presented the drink to Dean and he fell into routine silence once more, leaving me to fend for myself and develop a strategy, one of stealth and cleverness, and one that would require me to make no social errors and speak with no awkward monotone voice. It was sure to be a difficult task, though I needed to be prepared. It needed to be carried out.
Dean sighed again, the emotion along his features described earlier falling into line with the exhale of air, and he looked all together as if he wanted to let go, fly into the wind, and leave behind whatever what plaguing him so. And then he rubbed the back of his head, and though I didn’t smile, I acknowledged the habit, and ticked it off in my mind as something I’d officially memorized.
“Hah, I don’t mean to be a buzzkill or nothin’, just...ah...just makin’ sure you’re not into me or anything like that, hm?”
I watched Dean sigh, lips blowing together as the air blew past his mouth, before he said, “Heh...is it now…” Promptly after, however, he cleared his throat and decided to be charitable by speaking once more. I was already out of ideas.
Upon meeting my own petrified gaze, Dean wiped his eyes and nose clumsily on the sleeve of his shirt, after having taken his jacket off and placing in on his seat, without much shame. He appeared to be entirely exhausted, like he’d given up in a battle or struggle that I was unaware of. In the midst of my desperate attempts to construct some sort of hypothesis as to why he’d arrived in such a state of mind, I heard my subject clear his throat and try to steady his breathing. He was about to speak.
Again, Dean shrugged, and then he rubbed the back of his neck, and I ticked the action off in my head.
“Lucifer, er...Luke, was the odd one out, and I suppose there’s always one of those, too,” I continued, mirroring Dean’s quick remark about Raphael. “He’s full of dry humor, the feeling of being misunderstood, the need to be rebellious...those sorts of things. He used to recommend music to me.”
“Oh, of course,” she answered finally with arms crossed around her chest and her leg jetting out in a calm, leisurely sort of stance. The only response she earned from me was a curt nod and silence.
Swallowing the lump of something embarrassing that had begun blocking my airways, I nodded my head and traveled to the open bottle I’d used just a few minutes before. My mind was racing at I poured, the basic action taking far longer than around seven seconds within my head, but just that to the rest of the outside world. And that outside world was full of world-wide-web sex offenders in denial, the sharp tang of scotch in scuffy glasses, and the scent of leather, spices, and car grease.
“Do you mean that?” Charlie whispered, breath as fleeting and chilled as the breeze cascading up and down my button-down’s sleeves, somehow touching down on my skin, and I was enveloped in goose bumps.
"Ay, Castiel, can you lock up for the night?" He asked me, removing a loud pair of keys from his jeans' pocket and jingling them in his hand as he awaited my response. I wasn't entirely sure what he thought I would say, however, seeing as though I didn't have much of a choice.
I couldn't help but notice how blatantly angry he seemed. The emotion was radiating off of his stern voice yet quaking and trembling hands, which were now clasped together on the counter, fingers interlocked with one another, and in the way he still refused to look up at me. While I didn't think he was a partaker in "common courtesy," I would've assumed he would want to show me he meant business, and a mere gaze from his earthy eyes, harsh brow, and sharp jawline would've almost willed me into silence. Almost.
“He’s right handed. It’s the hand he holds his drink with and the one that holds his wallet in,” I interjected, but quickly realized that my small Winchester-tidbit had done little to help my case. Charlie’s smile just deepened.
“If there’s always something, that something must be especially severe today. You’re...very aggravated.”
Dean smiled and lowered his hands, dropping one to the side of his face where he lay against it, and, seizing the opportunity, I went to retrieve the drink I knew he’d order, grabbed a glass, and began to pour while watching the changes in his facial expressions. They went from a sad smile, to wallowing in an unidentifiable misery, to curiosity, directed at me, and then back to his sad smile.
“Hm?” was my reply, still dazed and about ready to dissolve upon meeting Dean’s wide, romance novel-worthy eyes.
Because in reality, that closure was just a shield to what I knew was true somewhere underneath the disguise of the game, of my used-to-be intentions, and of my dismissal of Charlie’s words and her lesson on the art of soul mates. Deep down, I wanted the lesson to be true, and I wanted to be living it then.
Maybe his generally overwhelming and extreme nature would serve as a good enough distraction from the insanity running marathons back and forth inside of my head. If it didn’t cease fire soon, I really could stroll straight into traffic.
“But he left, and I’ve barely heard from him since,” he continued, after seeing I was in no position to reply or interrupt his piece. I was too intent on listening to it in full.
“Had I not walked in on them...on them...you know, doing that, I would’ve been under the impression that he was willing, too!”
I suppose it took one to know one, but I kept such a sad thought to myself as I sipped my scotch. There were two intrusive ice cubes floating about the amber liquid, and I sighed.
“Why, is it that obvious?” I continued. Darting over to a dusty, rusted old mirror hung behind the bar where I was stationed, cleaning its surface as diligently as I could without nodding off due to the physical exertion, I took note of the bags under my eyes and the general sunkenness of my face. Yes, it was painfully obvious. My question to Charlie lost its meaning or purpose, but still she answered with a minute smile of sympathy on her face.
The first hole in those freshly-constructed defenses had been blown in, and I swallowed the mental pain to clear the lump in my throat and to free my voice.
“God Cas, you really need to watch a few shitty movies. Remind me to lend you a copy of The Notebook or somethin’ okay?” Charlie chuckled as she began to wipe down the end of the bar opposite me in what I assumed to be an attempt to look busy. I gave her some half-hearted okay, eager to hear her true response to my question but still running my eyes over every table, every booth, every occupied corner, and every barstool.
Dean neither heard nor saw little of the time between his fourth, third, and second to last breaths, but the voices in his head raged. They sounded just like him, despite the former being way more impassioned and the latter unsettlingly jaded. As his stare slid down Sam’s person, their foreheads eventually colliding with a defunct
