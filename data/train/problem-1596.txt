“No… there’s no longer any pain, John.”
by Ludvig Prinn;
“What exactly are you working on?” I question.
Both men turn to me, awaiting my answer. Despite my initial surprise at Dr Johansen’s disclosure, I feel that he’s telling the truth, and that he is the right person to help Sherlock.
After I make tea for both of us, Sherlock has me sit on the sofa, while he turns his chair at an angle to the fireplace. This isn’t going to be good.
“He slowly rose and reached out two monstrous tentacles towards me. They encircled my wrists and I was pulled quickly and forcefully until I was mere centimetres from him. His foetid breath was hot and wet against my body. Then he raised his right hand, extended a claw and raked it down my chest. Searing pain coursed through me and I dropped to my knees and screamed. That’s when he released me and I woke up.”
“Perhaps it would help if you told us what happened at Caird and Rayner. The live feed from the MI6 team’s cameras went out almost immediately after they entered the warehouse.“
“You should have gone back to bed when I told you to.”
I interrupt. “Hang on a minute. If this is anything like Caird and Rayner… You
“Just keep an eye on him. And you might want to get him to talk to someone.”

“Most impressive, John. But then you do have a keen interest in military history.”
Professor Abernathy rises slowly from the table. “Mr Holmes… if you and Dr Watson will follow me please. I’ll take you to the vault.”
“Your loss would break his heart? When the hell did he say that?” I ask.
“That’s not the point. I just don’t like either of you boys getting hurt. I worry about you two, always running around chasing criminals and such.”
Sherlock joins me on the floor, buries his face in the juncture between my neck and shoulder, and hugs me.
“Sherlock!”
Slowly and painfully I sit up, move onto my knees, and manage to stand upright. I don’t think anything’s broken, but I’m going to have some spectacular bruises. At my age I should be dead… Wait… I look down at my hands – they’re smooth and free of liver spots. I touch my face; it, too, is free of wrinkles. What the hell is going on?
“Where is he, Mycroft?“
out of Auckland in the 1920’s. En route to Callao in 1924, his ship was attacked by a heavily armoured steam yacht. The crew of Emma overtook the other ship, but soon found themselves on an unknown island that turned out to be R’lyeh itself. All the crew were killed by Cthulhu except for my grandfather, and he only managed to escape because he ran the ship into the creature and injured it. He returned home and documented everything, but died in 1925 under unusual circumstances. The story, and my grandfather’s journal, have been passed down from my father to me, and will go to my son after I’m gone. So I’m in a unique position to treat your partner – I already believe his story.”
Sherlock isn’t sure we’ll be returning to the cottage, so he advises the Hastings’ of our departure plans.
“What happened to you today? You mentioned something about a psychic attack when you woke up in hospital.”
“That was my first thought, but why go through all the trouble of hauling in barrels of acid? And why remove them once you’ve completed your task? If the purpose of all this…” Sherlock gestures towards the stacks. “is merely to obtain the bones, why not just kill them elsewhere and bring them here?”

“I’ll explain when we get home.”
Mycroft glances over at Greg. “There was no one there, John. The place was deserted.”
It takes another two hours before the doctors release Sherlock into my care. They insist on running a few more tests (and rerunning others), then give us a list of precautions and symptoms to be aware of, before we’re allowed to leave.
Mycroft rises from the chair and he and Greg start to leave. “There are two armed guards outside in case my brother tries to make contact. I’ll send a car in the morning to take you home. Good night, John.”
“Love you, John. Good night.”
Sherlock’s face falls. “I don’t know if I can ever go back there, John. I’m sorry. I should have discussed this with you before now.”
I’m back at Baker Street two hours later with a slight alcohol buzz. The flat is pitch black, but I can see Sherlock’s silhouette in front of the window.
“I’m alright.”
the information, Mycroft.”
Once Sherlock and I are fully kitted out, Mycroft opens the door and ushers us inside.
Dr Johansen jots down some notes before proceeding. He directs the next question to Mycroft. “And you are?”
“Thanks, Greg… Where’s Sherlock?“
“Caird and Rayner,” Sherlock explains, “owned and occupied this building as a sail-makers’ and ship-chandlers’ warehouse from 1889 to 1972. It’s the only original building of that kind surviving in Tower Hamlets. Because it was a sail-maker's loft, the main part of the building just had a ground floor and a full height space in which to hang and manage sails, with a gallery around the inside perimeter at first floor level. The rear of the warehouse has two double loading doors which open onto the Limehouse Cut, which as you know, links the lower reaches of the Lee Navigation to the Thames.”
“Then why did you ask?”
, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming
“I always knew you were a remarkable man, Mr Holmes, but I never knew how remarkable and unique that brain of yours was. I wish all my patients had the ability to delete information they found distasteful or upsetting.”
We come upon a wall that’s had a large hole blown in it. As we step through, I reach out and grab it for balance – my hand comes away wet.
“Greg, are you okay? Do I need to get my medical bag?”
The crewman taking the video moves closer to one of the bas-reliefs and brings the camera into focus. Dear God, no!

Bunny Galore is the host of
Sherlock pats the sofa and I walk over and join him. “My brother is an enigma, John. Don’t fret over it.” He hands me the remote and we settle in to watch a bit of TV.
A strange sensation washes over me, as if I’m moving at great speed. I open my eyes and find myself in a gigantic underground cavern. It’s freezing. A noise behind me makes me spin around. I almost wish I hadn’t.
“Somewhat… Today wasn’t exactly a bad day, but it wasn’t good either. I always leave Dr Johansen’s office feeling a bit out of sorts.”
After exiting the lift, we walk along more passageways and finally arrive at our destination. The Occult Collections Vault is just that – a vault. A solid steel door six inches thick protects the collection; once again a key pad and palm reader are adjacent to the door, but this one also has a retina scanner.
from 1993-1996.
“John, how are you feeling?“
It's been four hours since Sherlock lost consciousness. The doctors have run every conceivable test they can think of including an EEG and MRI, but all the results have either come back negative or normal. But something out of the ordinary obviously happened. Lestrade and I both witnessed it.
Sherlock leans forward, elbows on knees. “There was a presence, John… I know what that sounds like, but hear me out. It started when we entered the chamber – a soft buzzing sound – but more than that. I could
My solicitor has been given strict instructions that the statue locked in my safety deposit box is to be hand delivered to the Curator of the British Museum, where it will be placed in the Occult Collections Vault for perpetuity. Under no circumstances should it be removed from its case, unwrapped, or left unguarded for any reason. The statue itself isn’t valuable – it’s chiseled from a single block of obsidian – but the figure it represents… the world must never know about that.
“Greg…”
I pull back a bit so we’re facing one another, then cup his face in my hand. “I love you, and I'll always be there for you no matter what happens, Sherlock.” I kiss him very tenderly and wrap myself around him, as if my love alone could protect him from all the evils in the world.
“Oh, if you insist.” He says with a chuckle.
Radio check to all the teams, then it’s a go.
Sherlock slowly walks around the flat, occasionally picking up an object and examining it, but mostly just observing – until he reaches his violin case. He hesitates momentarily, opens it and removes both the violin and bow, then begins to play.
“I’ll reach out to him in the morning. In the meantime, you get some rest. They’re keeping you overnight for observation.” Mycroft holds up his hand. “And before you start asserting that you’re fine, I suggest you look in the mirror.”
The ground surrounding the statue is drenched in blood; in some places there are standing pools of it. How many people were killed here?
I give Mrs Hudson a very watered-down version of the case. She’s worried about Sherlock, naturally, but probably not as much as she would be if she knew the whole truth.
Sherlock carefully inspects each pile of bones, even crawling on the ground to get a closer look. He finally stands up and turns to me. “John, please give me your professional medical opinion of the remains.” His voice is loud over the two-way radio.
“Do you remember the first time I told you that I loved you? It was after that whole Magnussen business, and that assassin who shot the both of you. You were in hospital, and I thought you were unconscious. I was poring my heart out to you, begging you not to die, because I loved you and couldn’t go on without you. And you said…”
“I love you, John Watson, and I always will.”
Mycroft walks away; we follow.
Back home at Baker Street, Sherlock stares at the map of London he’s pinned to the wall. He marks both murder locations with a black Sharpie, then draws a line connecting them.
“John… John, wake up. You’re having a nightmare.”
How Sherlock and I obtained the statue has never been documented. There are no case notes, no photographs, and neither of us discussed the matter once it was closed. Some things should never see the light of day, and this object is one of them. It belongs buried in the deepest, darkest pit along with those cultists who worship the creature depicted upon it.
We take things slowly. Mycroft must have put the word out, because our friends call ahead to schedule a time to visit. Lestrade, Molly, and Mike each stop by to say hello and ask if we need anything. None of them stay long.
Sherlock squeezes my hand, and when I look into his face, his eyes are filled with tears. “Of course I will, John. I can’t imagine anyone else at my side but you.”
Once again Sherlock Holmes has completely amazed me.
The game is on.
The man is a mess – hair disheveled, clothes rumpled and dark circles under his bloodshot eyes. If he’s here to ask for assistance on a case, it must be very bad indeed to have affected him like this.
“Both locations are on the same longitude, and they’re both tied to the Thames – Caird and Rayner via the Limehouse Cut, and Convoys Wharf directly. We need to finish our research on Cthulhu. Once we do I’m sure we’ll have a clearer picture.”
All the surviving cultists are zip-tied, loaded into vans, and driven off into the night. I assume they’ll be arrested and detained at some government facility, but they can rot for all I care. There are also ten captives being held in the warehouse. Thankfully, they’re all unhurt.
I won’t go into all the minutia regarding Sherlock’s treatment, just that he’s in hospital for 197 days. I visit every single one of them, even when Sherlock doesn’t want to see me, just to let him know that I haven’t given up on him – or us.
Sherlock looks at me like I’ve grown a second head. “The scientific or common name?”
He goes on to explain about what we found in the warehouse and the psychic attack made on him. Dr Simondson and Professor Abernathy listen intently. When Sherlock finishes, both men are visibly shaken.
“Go, John. I’ll just be sorting through documents anyway. The worse thing that can happen to me is a paper cut.“
Sherlock’s statement is likely to take some time, so I go first. I’m taken into an interview room with recording equipment; Greg accompanies me. I relate the events of Sherlock’s kidnapping and subsequent rescue. I don’t know how much of this is going to be admissible, but I add as much detail as I can.
We immediately call Dr Johansen and explain the situation. He’s understandably skeptical, and wants to meet with us both. We agree to return to London in two days.
We’re traveling in the wrong direction for either Baker Street or Whitehall, and I doubt Mycroft would take us to his home, so that leaves only one possibility for our destination – The Diogenes Club.
Lestrade doesn’t seem too happy to see me. “I thought you were at home recuperating.”
“Thank you, Anthea. That will be all.”
“Okay, I’ll make a note of it. You just relax. I’ve got you.”
I check in with one of the security team to let them know Sherlock is home alone before taking off down the street.
It’s hot; the Afghan sun beats down mercilessly on our platoon as we crouch behind the crumbling remains of an ancient fortress. Breathing is almost too much of an effort. The dry desert air sucks the moisture from my lungs and refills them with dust and sand. My limbs are heavy; suddenly I can’t move and I start to panic…
“John? Has something happened to Sherlock?”
“Rash… Sherlock you haven’t started using drugs again, have you?”
Sherlock puts the tea down, walks over and hugs me. “They won’t risk coming here, John. Not after the show of force you put on last night.”
“Does it still hurt?”
Sherlock turns from the window, walks to the sofa and sits down. “The first Christmas you spent at my parent’s house after I’d been shot by that assassin. It was when he and I stepped outside to have a cigarette.”
“Sherlock…” I whisper.
“What are you looking for?” I question.
And this is a
“Shit! Shit… I’m sorry, Sherlock. I’m sorry. It’s okay, I’ll just go back to the house.”
-	H.P. Lovecraft,
“Alright, dammit. The things I do for the bloody Holmes family.” Greg goes to a file cabinet, pulls out several sheets of paper, then hands them to me. “Fill these out. We have to make it official.”
We hear the front door open, followed by several sets of heavy footsteps on the stairs. It’s Mycroft, along with his ever-present umbrella, and four men in suits – they’re each carrying a cardboard storage box – which they place on the floor by the desk.
I'm afraid I've let my imagination run a bit wild in this chapter. I've never been to the British Museum, and I'm sure all the security I've included here doesn't actually exist.
Despite the lack of activity by the members of the Cult of Cthulhu, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. How was I to know it would be Sherlock’s size 11 when it did?
The police have cordoned off a two block area surrounding the warehouse, so we exit the cab and walk the rest of the way, weaving around emergency vehicles and police cars as we do.
In the end we decide that Sherlock needs to be sectioned for his own safety – and mine. He’s admitted to a private facility; apparently it’s the same hospital that treated him for drug addiction when he was younger. Mycroft feels he’ll be more comfortable there, since he’s already familiar with the place.
I nod my head and smile at him. “Yes, thanks.”
“John?”
Skip the section after Sherlock and John give their statements if you feel this would upset you. The rest of this chapter should be okay after that.
The elder Holmes wants to debrief Sherlock on the spot, but I draw the line and tell him it can wait until Sherlock’s hydrated, cleaned up, eaten and a had a decent night’s rest – in that order. He backs off after I give him a scathing glare.
- H.P. Lovecraft,
Greg runs a hand through his hair, sighs, then leans forward on his desk. “John, I can’t help you, as much as I would like to. The Yard was taken off the case. If I went against Mycroft, my arse would be on the line, not to mention my marriage.”
We follow Professor Abernathy down several corridors until we come to a lift. There's a key pad with palm reader attached to the wall beside it. The Professor places his hand on the reader, waits as it scans his hand, then keys in a 10 digit number. The lift doors open and we step inside. I'm not sure how many levels we descend, but it seems to take several minutes. I feel like I’ve stepped into a James Bond film; all I need now is to see Q when the doors open.
“Good choice on your part. I’m going to make a cup of tea, then I believe the three of us need to have a serious conversation about the events of last night.”
“I’d have thought that was obvious, John. It has to do with chemistry.”
We leave the doctor’s office and have a celebratory dinner at Angelo’s that evening, complete with wine. All in all, things have turned out much better than I could have ever hoped for.
When he doesn’t answer, I grab his forearms to get his attention. His eyes are wild and terrified and he frantically tries to pull away from me. I release him; he turns toward the statue and begins yelling.
I make up a tray with tea and biscuits and bring it out to him. He opens the door at my knock and takes the tray from me.
I open my eyes slowly – actually just the right eye – the left one is still swollen shut. My head is pounding in sync with my heartbeat, and I really think I’m going to vomit.
After arriving home, we both toe off our shoes and settle in our chairs with a cup of tea. Since Sherlock said we should discuss what happened in the warehouse, I begin the conversation.
That night, Sherlock and I make love for the first time in a
Sherlock speaks for the first time since entering the building. “Yes, John. Unless I’m mistaken, and I very much doubt that I am, we are now traveling parallel to the canal. In fact…” He reaches down and grabs a handful of dirt, sniffs it and lets it sift through his fingers. “High concentration of nitrogen and organic matter. This was marshland before the warehouse was built over it. But why block this section off? It makes no sense.”
for himself.
All of the books mentioned in this Chapter are taken directly from Lovecraft's works.
It was decided (by Sherlock) that now was a good time for us to retire and move to Sussex permanently. I don’t disagree.
He doesn’t answer. But I notice that he relaxes a bit; uncurls and stretches his legs out. I take this as a sign that he is listening, so I keep talking.
“Nonsense, Mycroft.” Sherlock chuckles. “I think Dr Terror would be a better choice. Don’t you, John?”
I hand Wiggins an envelope full of cash. “Pass that out as a sign of good faith, will you.”
Mycroft and Lestrade both stop by that evening to welcome us home. Sherlock explains briefly about deleting the information on the cult. Mycroft isn’t sure that’s such a good idea, but it’s a moot point as it’s already done. He tells us that there’s been no cult activity since the night we rescued Sherlock, but will reactivate surveillance on Baker Street now that we’ve returned just to be on the safe side.

The lead news story is about an archeological discovery somewhere in the South Pacific. A series of underwater earthquakes has brought a heretofore submerged island to the surface. It was discovered by the crew of a Japanese freighter on its way to South America. The video footage is shaky and obviously taken with a mobile phone, but it’s

And scream until my throat is raw and my voice is gone. The man on the throne spreads his legs apart and beckons to me; I drop to the ground and crawl to him – emotions alternating between shock and disbelief. It can’t be; it just can’t.
It takes me a couple tries, but he finally opens his eyes, blinks, then looks around the shed before facing me.
“Unless the location is important.” I offer.
“Sentiment, brother?”
When I come around, it’s morning and I’m in bed. I get up slowly and feel the back of my head – it’s tender, but the skin doesn’t appear to be broken. After a trip to the loo, I wash up, swallow a couple Paracetamol, then make my way to the living room.
It’s Lestrade. I make the mistake of turning my head a bit too fast and… oh, crap. Greg grabs an emesis bag from the wall dispenser and I empty my stomach contents into it. He hands me a glass of water to rinse and spit.
The character name of Gustaf Johansen and the story he tells about the
I’m not worried. I have plenty of firewood, the pantry is full, and there’s an ample supply of petrol for the generator. Despite my 75 years, I can still get around on my own fairly well. Not that I get out and about much any more. Food is delivered weekly from the village, and the young man who brings the groceries – Andrew Hastings is his name – also  chops firewood and does general maintenance around the cottage. He was fascinated by the bees from a young age, and Sherlock was more than willing to pass along his knowledge.
Sherlock looks and sounds so pitiful God, how can I refuse him? “Do you have someplace in mind?”
The warehouse is immense, and not just in height. You could fit a rugby field in the main building, and still have room for spectators. We pass through another door at, what I think is, the rear of the building. I glance at my watch. It’s just past ten in the morning, but the warehouse is already heavily shadowed. Inspector Lestrade gives Sherlock and I each a torch, which we immediately click on.
Before Sherlock can reply with something snarky, I ask Mycroft, “How many people were killed at the first site?”
I must have momentarily lost consciousness, because when I come to my senses, my teeth are chattering. All the heat has been leached from my body, and I’m in danger of contracting hypothermia. Escape now is imperative, even if I have no idea where I am or how I got here.
“Your whole body tenses for just a moment before you start struggling. If you dream about getting shot, you’re more relaxed. Either way, your nightmares are always about your time in Afghanistan.”
I gasp at the sight before me. It’s a cyclopean room, circular in shape, with bas-reliefs carved into the walls. Directly ahead of me is an elaborate throne, hewn from the stone of the cavern. But it’s what’s sitting on the throne that sets my heart pounding frantically.
to harm my mate?“
“What?” My voice actually squeaks, so I clear my throat before continuing. “Sherlock, we’ve gone over this with Dr Johansen, individually and together. What those cultists did to you… You can’t blame yourself for that. They raped you. Even if there wasn’t penetration, they performed sexual acts on you without your consent. That’s rape in the eyes of the law. And it doesn’t matter to me that we haven’t made love in a while. We still hug and kiss; you let me sleep with you. Sherlock, waking up with you in my arms is absolutely wonderful. I could just watch you for hours. Geez… now I sound like a stalker.”
“No, John. It’s best if you wait out here with Mycroft.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Talk? Yes, of course we do. We discuss the stories from the paper; Sherlock even deduces a bit. Last week I had Sherlock choose a novel that we would both read and discuss. I try to keep his mind occupied. He’s always at his best if he isn’t bored.”
Sherlock’s breathing evens out, and it isn’t long before he’s asleep. I pull the blanket from the back of the sofa and cover him, then turn on the TV, mute it, and spend the next few hours half watching crap telly.
I scream.
“Evil? Mycroft what are you on about?”
“John… easy there, mate.”
“I thought you might like a snack.”
It takes us nearly 30 minutes to get there. The cab parks as close as it can, then we walk – talk about déjà vu. It’s another deserted warehouse, but instead of uniformed police, there are lots of men in dark suits with earpieces and stab vests. We approach the barricade and show our ID’s. After a quick radio check, we’re waved through, and the guard points us in the right direction. I have a bad feeling about this.
Mrs. Fish
. Sherlock has taken the
“Considerate as always, John. Thank you.” He gathers me in his arms and kisses me.
Sherlock raises his shirt and I gasp… there's a red line of raised flesh running from his left shoulder to his naval. As we watch, the redness fades and the skin returns to normal.
“Yes, sorry. I got worried.”
“What if I file a missing person’s report? Or report that Sherlock’s been kidnapped? You could investigate that, right?”
“I’m fine other than a headache. Why are you here, Mycroft?”
Sherlock pours us both tea, then takes a seat himself. There’s a slight tremor in his hand as he takes a sip. I’ve upset him. Christ, if I’ve caused a flashback…
“No; I've already seen what's inside, and once is quite enough thank you. The scene’s been left pretty much as it was found. It isn’t pleasant.”
“Like, shite, but that doesn’t matter right now. What’s being done to find Sherlock?“
“You’ve never mentioned that before, Sherlock. Have you told this to Dr Johansen?”
“I read something earlier regarding dreams. Ah, here it is. It’s an article describing an alternate dimension accessible through a person’s dreams called the Dreamlands.”
“That’s very good; just the type of thing he needs. I know this hasn’t been easy for either of you, but he is getting better.”
I open the bottle and recognize the scent of peppermint oil. I follow the Inspector’s instructions and find it does help mask the smell rather well. I offer the vial to Sherlock, but he refuses.
“This used to be the Royal Dockyards, right?”
“Take him home, John.”
We both stand and Dr Johansen opens the door for me. Sherlock’s reading a medical magazine; he breaks into a smile when he sees me.
He pulls me down and I lie next to him. “Better?”
by Friedrich von Junzt;
Sherlock looks over at me. “Some correlation between the two, John?”
We take Sherlock to Barts for a more thorough check-up, despite his protests that he’s unharmed. He hasn’t let go of my hand since we left the warehouse, and I’m concerned.
After Professor Abernathy gets the door unlocked, Sherlock and I enter the vault. It's bigger than I thought it would be – at least 6 metres long and the same number wide.  The air is cool, so it's obviously climate controlled as well. Most of the books are in locked, glass-fronted cabinets.
“So what was this place?” I ask as we approach the derelict building.
Ablutions complete, I slip into bed, pull up the duvet and close my eyes.
“You have an appointment at the British Museum tomorrow at 11:00 am. Dr Richard Simondson, the curator, and Professor Michael Abernathy, who’s in charge of the Occult Collection, will be interviewing you to determine if you’ll be allowed access to the vault. You’re to meet them at the lecture rooms. It’s the best I could do.”
“It would be better if I showed you. This way.” He points his umbrella towards the two hanger-like buildings in the distance.
“John… I’m afraid you and my brother have stumbled upon something very ancient, very evil…”
“Bodies? Not just bones?”
As one, the things move towards me. I pivot – there’s only one direction open to me – up a steep flight of stairs. I begin to run, hoping there’s some form of egress from this place.
Sherlock holds out his right hand, palm up, and one of the cultists places an ornate dagger in it. It’s already been used, judging by the dried blood on the blade. He raises it above his head and cries out something in that strange language, then slashes the blade across the kneeling cultist’s throat. Arterial blood sprays across Sherlock’s torso and onto the ground.
Sherlock steeples his fingers in front of his lips and mulls over this new development. “If I agree… and I’m not saying that I will, I want access to all the information you have on Cthulhu and his followers.
Sherlock has been growing increasingly restless, despite my efforts to keep him occupied. He eats just enough to keep alive, hasn’t slept in days, and his interactions with me have become hostile. I don’t know if his behavior is a by product of his kidnapping, but I’ve had about all I can stand. I grab my coat and practically run out the door.
A crushing pain in my chest has me reaching for the bottle of Glyceryl trinitrate that is a constant, comforting weight in my pocket. I place a tablet under my tongue and wait for the symptoms to subside. One of these days it won’t be enough, but for now I close my eyes, relax and keep breathing. However, the image from the bas-relief is still fresh behind my eyelids, and I shake my head to try and banish it.
I get up slowly and retrieve my laptop. The story needs to be told; the world needs to be warned before it’s too late. For there is no doubt in my mind that the island the Japanese freighter stumbled upon is none other than accursed R’lyeh.
Sherlock laughs. “Oh, John, if there’s one constant in the universe, it’s that no matter the problem or situation, a cup of your tea will always set things to right. I’d love one, thank you.”
“As ever John, you see, but do not observe.” Sherlock rolls over to face me and takes my hand. “If you did, you’d know that I love you too.”
It’s obviously what he needs, because he kisses me back so hard that we both fall backwards onto the rug. After that we both dissolve into a fit of giggles. We lay there for several minutes, until the sound of footfalls on the stairs has us scrambling for our chairs. Mycroft appears a moment later.
“Oh, enough with the quotes, Mycroft.” Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns back towards me. “He’s right though, John. We do need to talk about what we found in that underground chamber. But first you need to get me out of here.”
Mycroft hands his brother a t-shirt, track pants and some trainers, and I help Sherlock get them on after I do a cursory examination – he has some superficial contusions and abrasions on his arms, legs and torso, and he definitely needs a bath, but other than that he seems fine.
I look at the titles, a bit daunted by the task.
“How so?”
Sherlock kisses me again, then the two of us work on making breakfast.
Suddenly a voice cries out, “Everyone freeze!” The MI6 team has finally arrived.
Only one more person to try, and if he doesn’t know where his brother is… no, I won’t go down that road quite yet. I manage some dinner and a cup of tea before Mycroft gets back to me.
Sherlock interrupts. “Professor Abernathy, I am well aware of what the vault contains. My interest is not trivial, but vital, because I believe forces are at work, as we speak, to unleash one of those horrors upon the world.”
“Yes, of course. It's in the rear section of the vault, along with related titles.”
“I hope you’re right.” I give him a quick kiss on the cheek, then head to the kitchen. “Breakfast?”
The information on the Dreamlands is taken directly from the
what happened to Sherlock there. Are you really willing to risk your brother’s life, Mycroft?”
Motion in my peripheral vision makes me turn, but it’s just Sherlock. He slowly backs away from the statue, hands pressed to his temples, torch discarded at his feet. His lips move, but there’s no sound emanating from them.
Sherlock pulls the document from the box and begins reading.
“Cthulhu came to me in a dream… I was in a huge, dank cavern standing naked before him. He was sitting on a massive throne, intricately carved with symbols. He looked exactly like the monolith at Caird and Rayner, except he wasn’t made of stone, John… he was
It seems that Sherlock is a property owner, much to my surprise. He has a cottage in West Sussex that he bought as a place to spend his retirement years in. And there are bee hives. I should have known – the man is obsessed with bees.
Sherlock’s intense gaze finally snaps onto John. His hands twitch at his sides, his lips press into a tight line. John timidly reaches out and brushes the smooth, porcelain skin of Sherlock’s jaw. Sherlock visibly flinches.
“Wouldn’t that make him easier to spot?” John asks, following him. “If he did handle the morphine legally, a pharmacist would have record of it.”
“You’re a wanted murderer, John.” He slaps a pair of handcuffs onto John’s wrists. “I owe your capture to the Yard, as well as my own sanity.”
“I’m almost there,” John pants. “Are you?”
“What is it now, Sherlock?”
“I thought you wanted me the way I want you." He draws in a deep breath. "I love you, Sherlock, and I'm so sorry for everything."
“Nothing compares to a brilliant, criminal mind.”
“My name is Clandestine. You know why I’m here.”
Sherlock spends the following morning at a motel assessing the body of a young woman. The manner of death is consistent with their annoyingly clever killer. The only difference with this scene is that the killer changed his message.
The other officer nods and opens the door for them. Lestrade and John make their way to the door.
“You know not to do that, Sherlock,” she mumbles. “It makes me think one of the dead came back to life.”
Lestrade shakes his head grimly. “Not all of them, unfortunately. We’re still looking for the third victim’s family.”
The three continue out the door. The other officer tips his hat at Sherlock before closing the door after them. Sherlock releases the breath he didn’t realize he was holding in. He stares at the syringe then at the door. He knows what the right thing would be to do, but the cold ache clutching at his hardened heart says otherwise.
“That’s it? There must be something we’re overlooking!” He takes off into the laboratory. “Where are the hair and fluid samples? I must see this for myself.”
“Really? That doesn't make sense."
Molly sets a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it gently. “You’ll figure it out, Sherlock. You always do.”
A smile tugs at the corners of John’s lips. “It doesn’t take a genius to know that crime is your oxygen, and mysteries are your aphrodisiac.”
“Something, anything, that can help me solve this case faster.”
. Well, he’s done a thorough analysis on the body, so it must not be something physical. Internal, maybe? If that’s the case, he’ll have to get an expert opinion, just to be certain.
“Why? Would shagging a wanted man leave a mark on your conscience?”
“You got anything, Sherlock?”
“Our killer struck again.”
“But I did all that for you! And we just had sex!”
John puts down his book. “Why?”
Sherlock’s eyes don’t follow the swaying needle. He keeps them fixed straight ahead on the board.
“That makes her number three. Christ, how many young women have to die before we catch this guy?” Lestrade shakes his head in disgust. “Do you blokes have any leads, yet?”
Sherlock slowly stands back up when John’s words ring in his ears:
“The good doctor doesn’t believe in playing it safe?”
Lestrade stares at him, impressed. “Did you just now come up with all that?”
Sherlock starts pacing, a mess of thoughts filling his brain. “The killer is taking the precious time to lure each victim to a filthy motel, instead of a dark alleyway or vehicle. This is a fantastic way to minimize suspicion and maintain control over the naïve victim. He can do virtually anything to end her life in this position. He could stab her, shoot her, beat her, but those are far too messy. He likes to keep his hands clean. Cleanliness and organization are important attributes of our killer’s profile.”
When Sherlock returns to 221B, he unleashes his frustration on the wall. As he adds more holes to the collection, he imagines each bullet tearing through the killer’s body. The thoughts fill him with a morbid sense of satisfaction. This is exactly what he’s going to do to the bastard once he catches him.
John walks downstairs quickly to meet Sherlock, wrapping his arms around the detective as he comes. "I really like purple on you."
Sherlock's back in the outfit he wore on their first case together since the amnesia hit. They'd been on several cases since, everyone except friends like Mycroft, Lestrade, and Molly gushing over their adorableness as Sherlock meticulously reteaches John each medical detail on a case-by-case basis. The friends worry Sherlock is going to get himself hurt, and that John is going to awaken one day furious. They've been on over fifty cases in three months. They only allowed actual date night once a month, that way the rest of the time felt like normal. John even gets confused about Sherlock's experiments and scolds him. There's something about John's personality that still exists perfectly even if the memory ceases to return.
Sherlock sighs as he runs his hands up and down John's sides. "So, as we've talked about, it's probably due to be your turn?"
"It's quite thrilling, could be dangerous even," John says as he grabs his coat out of Sherlock's hands and walks ahead of him out the door. Sherlock follows, a smile growing on his face as pieces of John start to become recognizable again.
John comes back looking somewhat more composed and sits next to Sherlock again, focusing on nothing but her meal. "The food here is excellent."
John speaks first. "I'm angry that I can't remember a single thing about you. But I feel like I know you. I feel like you're special to me."
"A few minutes, if you would," Sherlock whispers breathlessly as he smiles up at John.
"So good," John finishes Sherlock's sentence and sits back up beside him, finger-combing her hair out of her face. "We've got to do that again."
After John puts the kettle on the stove, she turns to see Molly behind her. Molly is smiling ear to ear. "John, we're not really that stupid. We can pretend to ignore the mess on your table and your floor, or you could just tell us that you and Sherlock need some time and will catch up. Everyone will understand."
Sherlock grins. "Of course. I'll pack my bag in the morning and leave within the next two days to find him and get things taken care of, as these days us working together has been a bit of a difficulty."
John knew immediately that Sherlock wasn't just asking if the gesture was welcome, but if the emotion behind it was okay to John. It was a big question that Sherlock could barely process, and John knew the best way to approach it was to be gentle. "It's, uh, a bit awkward," John starts, and Sherlock nods as he begins to pull his hand away. John shakes his head, taking Sherlock's hand into both of his.
"Of course not, it's quite…sweet. Being someone's first is a compliment in any mannerism," John replies as he picks Sherlock's coat up from the ground, helping the detective shrug back into it.
Sherlock searches the doctor's eyes, seeing that he is being completely serious on that statement. "I get bored of a lot of things, Doctor Watson," he says smoothly, putting down his tea on the table. He grabs the tea from John and places it down on the table as well. "But never think for a second that it's possible that I could ever get bored of you."
"Good luck," Lestrade calls after Sherlock as he flees out the door.
"I am perfectly healthy," Sherlock says calmly, flipping another page from another cold-case file. John sighs, reaching out and pulling the file away from Sherlock to grasp the detective's attention.
Sherlock's eyes dart up at John's words. "Well, we're friends, John."
Sherlock pulls away after another minute, taking the time to breathe and really look at John. Flushed, grinning like an idiot John Watson that is just waiting for Sherlock to say something. "I can think, but it's not much," Sherlock mumbles.
John files that away under ways to get the older Holmes to leave them alone before grabbing a rag and cleaning himself off before going back to Sherlock's room and wiping the half-awake form of Sherlock Holmes clean as well, smiling as Sherlock pouts at him. "I will let you get back to sleep soon," John promises, going to walk away before he feels a hand on his arm. "Yes Sherlock?"
John reaches forward and pushes away Sherlock's pajama bottoms in one swift run, glad and concerned all at once that there were no pants underneath. He reaches forward and runs his hand up and down the shaft of Sherlock's member before gripping onto it and tugging like he would his own. Sherlock responds by digging his fingers underneath John's pants and rubbing his fingers over her entrance directly, making John cry out into Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock flushes. "That perhaps might be the case, but not often, only sometimes in moments – particularly moments related to you."
"You didn't have to strive to look so well, you could have very well worn your pajamas and I wouldn't have cared," Sherlock murmured, leaning over so his lips can whisper in John's ear. "You could have worn nothing, actually, and I definitely wouldn't have minded."
"John, may I," Sherlock says as he moves his hand up John's side and feels John tremble under his touch until his hand reaches his neck and John stares up at him, unsure. "Tell me if you want anything to stop."
John stands up, smiling gently. Sherlock reaches forward and wipes off the stray cum on the side of John's lip with his thumb. "I'm sorry, John."
John notices the confusion on Sherlock and it makes him chuckle. "I am taking you up there because I know you will just stay awake in your room and read case files if I take you to your bed, so I want to make sure you actually get some sleep."
"You make it very difficult to pay attention," Sherlock says lower than his typical register. Sherlock looks out the window for the rest of the car-ride and despite some small questions from John he ignores, there is complete silence. When they get up to the flat, Sherlock reaches around John's feminine curves and grabs around the ass and pulls John closer. "I couldn't think my mind palace was trying to make deductions, and then I heard you talking and thought about this morning and I…and when you bent down to do your own work all I could think of was doing this," John moans softly as Sherlock kneads the arse more, "and I couldn't concentrate on anything else."
Now Sherlock's quite literally hovering over me, watching to make sure this story ends correctly. I could explain to you about how I got my memory back after a particularly heated night and forgot the part that mattered at the wrong moment. I could tell you that I was nursed back to health by a detective with red-rimmed eyes from crying with just the power of clashing lips and bodies.
John nods, a frown forming on his face. What the hell is going on with Sherlock? He's acting like a fourteen year old kid who's got a crush for the first time around John. Then it hits John, harder than he'd perhaps like to admit it did. Of course Sherlock would act like someone who's having a first crush, for all John knows it could be his very first crush. He can't process it properly so he's acting childish about it, like many other things.
John gives the driver a nasty look. "It went just fine. Is the fare covered for now?"
John smiles understandingly and moves off of Sherlock's lap, taking the moment to address the cabbie. "To the closest coffee shop, keep the change."
"Yes, okay, are we done now? Or do you want to brag about the fact that you made things easier again, because I am not in the mood to fuel your ego Sherlock," John says as he puts down his tea sharply and goes to walk upstairs.
"Excuse me? Is that really what you say to them?" John asks as he walks closer, trying to get Sherlock to understand.
"But all we've been doing lately is," John takes a deep breath. "I mean, it's just…it's not like I don't want to because I do and every touch is just, starting a fire," John smiles awkwardly. "Too much information?"
"Of course we're still sharing a bloody cab-" John starts before Sherlock walks away from him to the other side of the cab to get inside.
"Come on, it'll be more comfortable to sleep without feeling sticky," John says, tapping on Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock ponders that idea for a moment. "I didn't get enough time to figure out if I like that sensation or not."
"Oh, I know," Sherlock says with a smile. "Just something I've been dying to try, if you wouldn't mind," he hovers over John's body, moving down until his face is hovering mere inches over John's hard clothed cock. John nods and Sherlock mouths his member over the fabric, hearing John's hands clasp the sheets on either side of him, ready for anything. He then pulls away just long enough to shuck off the offending fabric before surrounding John's member with his lips, swallowing it all back, humming and swirling his tongue almost expertly. It's mere minutes before John is pulling him back up by his hair.
"That's an improvement," Sherlock states in a very monotone voice.
"I have to look nice, it's a fancy party," John mutters softly as Sherlock holds her fingers still.
"Mary was a wonderful girl. Her parents did not approve of our engagement after finding out how we met, but I thought that it didn't matter. I enlisted and she promised she'd wait. I came back and she had already moved on, already had a husband and child," John says before sucking in a sharp breath. "Does the great Sherlock Holmes need to bring up any other latent traumatic emotions, or can I be done now?"
John smiles at the notation of the red lettering on the back of Sherlock's old coat. "Must've suited you too for you to have kept this for so long."
John doesn't answer with words but with motions, feeling like everything he's doing is somehow right as he undoes Sherlock's zip with his teeth. He pushes away Sherlock's offending final layers of clothing just enough so that if they needed to walk away, Sherlock wouldn't have to be pulling everything back on in a rush. John licks the tip of Sherlock's leaking member first, eliciting a shaky moan from the detective.
Sherlock smiles deviously and yells up to the cabbie. "Listen driver, I am going to need you to aimlessly drive around town for a while and not look towards us. A hundred should do the trick, yes?" The driver just nods and takes Sherlock's money.
It is a few hours later when Sherlock wakes John back up. Not purposefully, really. Sherlock is just dreaming another one of his dreams. John wakes up to the calling of his name. "Sherlock, hey, calm down."
"We can forget dinner," John suggests as he stands up, waving to Angelo to indicate they'll actually be leaving. "If you would like, that is."
Sherlock looks up, an unamused frown posed on his face. "I was about ready to solve that one."
"I love you too, you daft idiot," John whispers as he moves his hand under the table to caress Sherlock's thigh. "Third date, wow, we're odd."
Sherlock scoffs, brushing off the comment as if it has no meaning. It's not until a few days following that Sherlock is caught in the dilemma. For the first time in days, John comes down for tea. Sherlock watches in silence as John habitually, by some thought process locked into John's brain Sherlock feels he can be thankful for, remembers where to sit.
"That was Irene…it wasn't," Sherlock reaches his hands forward then hesitates. "May I?"
"We are out," Sherlock states firmly. He leans over to John's ear and whispers. "Have you never been so aroused before that you have just wanted to climb your date on the way there?"
Sherlock opens up his legs, waving his knees around as he waits for John. A bit of nervous energy is coursing through him, much more defined than that is his arousal. They've done just about everything else by this point, but this will be the first time for Sherlock with John and at all. John pushes in the first finger and Sherlock hisses a bit, not expecting the feeling of the burn in the way it is. Sherlock nods for John to add another, and eventually something clicks in John's brain and he bends the fingers upwards, eliciting a deep moan from Sherlock's core.
John shrugs. "Sherlock would likely tell me if there was, they are his friends more than mine. We've only been recruited once to their facilities and it's likely their newest member that was responsible anyhow. Looks remarkably like Sherlock too, funnily enough."
"I am perfectly aware that it's been twenty-one days, John, and as you can see I am perfectly fine," Sherlock says, though the rare spots of grey under his eyes show that he's lying. "Now, John, give me back the file" Sherlock asks, clearly showing more of his frustration to John as he reaches out for the file.
John smiles brightly. "I'm glad. I love you, Sherlock."
"Oh," Sherlock replies slowly, starting his way up the stairs, hiding the fact that he is, in fact, blushing.
"Yeah, hang on," John says before lining up with Sherlock's entrance. "You are one-hundred percent sure on this."
Angelo smiles wide as he leaves the candles there and says he's got just the meals, on the house as always. Sherlock smiles ear to ear as he rubs his thumb over John's hand.
John is quite lost for words. This is new experience for him as well. "You better fucking not," John mutters before thinking about it much, and starts begging him to move. Sherlock obliges, thrusting in slow languid movements at first before fucking into her better, faster, harder.
"Well, uh, no – definitely don't be sorry about that," John says with a goofy half-smile, quite sated from orgasm as it were.
John glares up at Sherlock. "Really – are we really doing this right now?"
There's an amount of sentiment that Sherlock doesn't even understand himself in the gesture and the words that leave his mouth next. "Don't leave, come lay with me," Sherlock asks of John. John throws the rag he used to wipe them both off to the floor, forgetting he's wearing Sherlock's robe as he climbs into bed beside the detective, wrapping himself in Sherlock's arms. Sherlock grins. "You look quite good in my housecoat."
"Teasing is half the fun," John says slowly, smiling as he takes Sherlock's hand and walks them out the door and out of the flat.
"There was something I thought was missing in my deductions so I resorted to research, it was quite fruitful," Sherlock replies before reaching for his own tea and taking a sip. John sighs, stripping away his jumper that's now likely stained with tea. Sherlock smirks. "What, now that I know you were a porn star you're going to give me a strip tease?"
Sherlock smiles ear-to-ear. "It really is."
"Precisely," Sherlock replies, walking closer to John. "Unless you're afraid you won't be able to maintain your own control, completely understandable."
"Might it be time to pay those friends a visit then?" John asks carefully. "I mean, I like this body too and all, but it might be nice to be myself again."
"Will you shut it?" John asks in a fast, frustrated whisper.
"It all, it went away, I couldn't think," Sherlock says in a tow of panic.
Sherlock shakes his head. "The almost touch. It must have been excruciating for you, knowing how sexually driven you find yourself now. You'd have to have extreme control over both emotions and bodily functions and it really fascinates me."
John gulps, trying to contain his own mind from wandering. "Can we at least go for coffee? I – maybe I am just as shit as you with this."
"I'm not sure you would agree if you knew," Sherlock mumbles as he reaches forward and places his hand in a gentle caress on the side of John's face. "I'm not your boyfriend."
"On the contrary, if I tell John that I don't want him the amnesia is permanent – what if he doesn't want me around, this new John, if he feels that I'm lying about the romantic elements? It wouldn't take more than an idiot to deduce that I was responsive to his actions," Sherlock says as he lifts his head to look at Lestrade. "What is the right thing to do?"
Sherlock crawls out of John's bed and heads quickly towards the door. John calls after him as he descends the stairs. "Is everything alright, Sherlock?"
It was almost a full day later that Sherlock woke up slowly, his eyes blinking a few times to re-adjust to the light coming through the windows. John was still huddled around him, his head bent into the crook of his neck peacefully as he kept on in slumber.
"Doing what? I'm simply stating you are in your natural condition, it musn't be that uncomfortable," Sherlock says, his grin not so visible through the dark but hearable in his tone of voice.
John smiles brightly. "Yeah, I think I am."
The cab driver gives time for both of them to cool down from their arousals and share a long silence before finding a coffee shop and letting them out, thanking them for the generous tip. As soon as the driver pulls away, Sherlock looks to John apologetically.
It takes seconds for John to give in, unbuckling his own belt before moving to straddle Sherlock's lap, hastily doing away at the buttons of Sherlock's coat. When they are all unbuttoned, he marvels at the erection that was hiding underneath. "Do you use your coat to hide that often?"
"I was being precautionary," John claims as he allows Sherlock to help him shrug into his coat.
"It shouldn't surprise me that you are so conceited, it really shouldn't," John says firmly as he moves to take off his shirt. "Alright then, strip down." Sherlock takes a moment before following John's lead until they are both in just their pants. "We can stop at this point, for comfort reasons."
John opens the front door and glares at Mycroft. "Go away, nothing's wrong. My boyfriend, your brother, is asleep and actually has a smile on his face."
The hard thing to explain is that John can't seem to resist Sherlock. And Sherlock makes it extra difficult for John to keep composure at various intervals. Telling Sherlock that she likes his voice was a ridiculous and stupid mistake. A really stupid mistake.
It takes three weeks for John to notice the change. At three in the morning, John's begging Sherlock to sleep. "It's not right, Sherlock, it's just not healthy."
"I am not good with small talk, I am only good with the two of us," Sherlock ventures. "Dates are tedious and frightening to me, but if we must."
John's hands scramble into Sherlock's hair, begging him to keep going until she explodes and they do just that. Sherlock comes back up and buries his face in John's neck as his fingers slowly move backwards and forwards between her folds, seeing she is still wet for him, that they still need more. Once Sherlock has reached three fingers John's practically screaming to just be fucked already and that's all Sherlock wants, to get lost in her. When he's fully seated inside her he just takes a moment to breathe her in, hold her tight, and then they thrust against each other until they are both fully sated and panting.
"It's more than that," John insists, searching Sherlock's eyes to see if the detective is lying to him.
John clears his throat. "It's been a long night, Sherlock."
Sherlock doesn't understand it. He doesn't do feelings, he just doesn't. They are messy and they don't fit right in deduction measures when it comes to himself, so he never takes the time or effort towards them. His companionship with John is the closest he's ever come to another human being in his life, and that was starting to become slightly more complicated.
"You're welcome to any of my jumpers," John answers as he curls his head into Sherlock's shoulder, grinning. Maybe Sherlock could start understanding sentiment after all.
"I'm doing it," John says as he pulls out his fingers and gets to work lubricating his member.
"Just a talk then," Molly says with a wide grin as she walks him back downstairs.
Mycroft sighs. "You'll make do, Sherlock. Just be careful what you tell him, do try to be truthful."
John looks confused. "What, something I said?"
"I'm a little upset you couldn't wait for me to talk to you otherwise, but right now, I don't particularly care," John says, as he pulls Sherlock close again. "If that's okay, we can worry about that later. I'm more concerned about."
Sherlock looks at the screen and back at John. John puts his laptop down and pulls out a small box from his pocket. "Sherlock Holmes, you know these things aren't easy for me. I do love you, and I am happier with you than I've ever been with anyone else."
"Better, what do you mean better?" John asks quickly. "Do you know what's bothering Sherlock? He hasn't left his room all day."
"So you've told me," Sherlock says, a goofy smile consumed with only the purest happiest meets John in response, and John just reaches forward and connects their lips again. John slowly undoes the buttons of Sherlock's shirt and skates his hand down each piece of skin that gets exposed as he does, earning soft moans into his lips by Sherlock. He pushes the purple shirt off of Sherlock's shoulders and it falls away forgotten behind them. Sherlock sits up in John's lap and swiftly pulls way John's jumper before John flips them around and yanks away Sherlock's trousers and pants. Sherlock moves his legs up, hiking up his knees, exposing his entrance to John. John moves away for seconds to grab lube out of the nightstand and slicks up his fingers to swirl around Sherlock's entrance, silently asking if Sherlock is sure. Sherlock nods and he throws his head back as John reaches his finger inside of him and within seconds finds the right spot, making Sherlock's hips cant up, begging for more pressure on his prostate, for more.
'I said yes. I must marry John Hamish Watson, immediately as possible. I would do so quicker if he wasn't pulling at my clothes while I'm completing typing this, and if he wasn't scolding me right now because I'm readying to publish more about this even as he continues to do so. Wait loyal readers of John's blog, for when we have that Sex Holiday thing. John's correcting me to say Honeymoon, but we all know the base mentality of it works better with my title. I love John, and he's murmuring he loves me too even though I won't let him have the keyboard back. I am completely and utterly enamored with my blogger.
"Of course," Sherlock replies like it should be obvious before really starting to feel the appeal of masturbation. "Do come back soon."
John finally looks to Sherlock and half-smiles. "It'll be different."
Mrs. Hudson stops them in the hall. "Hello boys, where are you off too?"
John grabs Sherlock's hand and guides it down to the detective's own member, pulling along with it for a moment. "I just have to get some things from the bathroom. I'm clean, tested every few months for work. You?"
"We'll make this quick then," John says softly before her lips meet Sherlock's and she leans against the shower wall.
In exactly twenty minutes John is rushing to the door, grappling on the hooks trying to find his coat, perplexed when he can't. Sherlock taps him on the shoulder, indicating that he has the coat in his other hand. "I wouldn't have left without you if you were a minute late."
"Tell you what?" John asks, acting as if he doesn't know where the question is going.
"Sentimentality doesn't hurt on occasion," Sherlock says softly as he sits down on the bed. "I'm almost finished packing. Is there anything I can do for you?"
John sighs. "I don't know, to be honest. Can we just focus on now? I'm asking you out and you still haven't answered me."
Sherlock watches John, patiently waiting as he takes a first sip of his tea for John to explain. John takes a sip of his own tea as well before speaking. "Sherlock, I know you. I also know how a first kiss affects someone. You may play brave on these matters, but all moves are cautious, new. And how passion clouds a mind is scary for a regular person. For you, who lives in his own mind, it is worse."
John's eyes flicker down to Sherlock's and just nods. Sherlock reaches up and smashes his lips to John's, for some reason no longer feeling so delicate about the occasion. It feels too good, the sensation of Sherlock rubbing harder against her clit and the battle of tongues that Sherlock is assuredly winning.
"I know, carry on," Sherlock says with a large grin, joking of course.
Sherlock lays his lips on John's, letting himself at first run through his mind palace and find all the moments that he's wanted John, all kept in its own section. He sifts through anatomy and what to do but he's not quite clear on it all, and that's where John comes in handy because at least one of them has a decent amount of experience in this area.
"I love you more than I've ever cared for anything else," Sherlock answers softly, learning the truth about it as he says it.
Sherlock's eyes turn darker. "Tempting," Sherlock mutters as he runs his hand down the front of her torso, down the center until his fingers are running right over the front of her jeans. Sherlock's eyes flicker up again for approval and John just nods. Sherlock runs his fingers in between her legs over her jeans and watches as John's legs start to turn to jelly just at the insinuation.
"No, uh, don't be sorry. It was, um, good, fine yeah," John replies before hearing Lestrade burst into the room outside of the closet, that being their que to be able to leave.
John nods and continues one finger at a time until he's reached three and finds that it comes in handy to be a doctor simply to know where the prostate should be and how to make your lover almost shake apart from pleasure is quite the arousing moment. "Sherlock, are you ready?"
Sherlock rolls over looking over John's flushed face with amusement. "Are you attempting to ask if we can go on a date first?"
Sherlock smiles a very vindictive smile. "Then let's hope we can finish you off first, because you are already wet under my fingers. Unless you'd rather go uncomfortable all night and try to explain why until you finally just," Sherlock chuckles as John shakes her head. He pulls her legs and softly helps her lay back on their table before he spreads her legs wide, rubbing her thighs before he dives his head under the layers of her dress and playfully tries a few licks over the fabric of her undergarments. She trembles against the ministrations and spreads her legs impossibly wider, a silent beg for more.
Sherlock blinks a few times before he tunes into John's words, his heart shattering a little more with each syllable. "Sorry, yes, long case."
Since then Sherlock had been dealing with an extreme amount of frustration. "The doctors say that he has amnesia. However they were vague when I asked if it would be permanent or not," Sherlock replies formally to his brother, knowing he wouldn't understand any of the emotional toll it's taken on him.
John heard a sharp rapping of knocks on his door. He opened it to find a very annoyed Sherlock with red circles around his eyes, showing that the detective not only had a heart but it was broken. "Can you make Mycroft leave? He's only been saying 'I told you so' and I'm not finding it very conducive."
Sherlock starts to kiss back as fervently as he can until he feels his mind start to pour away in it and he panics. He pulls away in a tow and freezes. "Sherlock, what – what's wrong?"
"What's next, Sherlock, you going to bring out an experiment notebook – all these questions, I am a human not an experiment subject," John says all too quickly.
"Is that a yes?" John ponders awkwardly. Now they are both acting a bit like teenagers at the matter.
"You're worried he'll come back to his memories and get angry, like you'll have taken advantage of a drunken bloke at a pub," Lestrade suggests.
It's not like John is complaining though. John's starting to get used to it. For the most part. Although, the first time he got my 'time of the month' as they call it, John was a swearing, emotional mess and Sherlock was surprisingly helpful. One could guess 'surprising' would be the best word to apply to Sherlock since the changeover. He's very…interested, focused. Not on his work like usual. Unless he is using John as an experiment base which there is no proof of but John is scared he might find. Sherlock just seems focused on John and there's no way around that.
The John-locked Consulting Detective,
Sherlock reaches down and tucks himself back into his trousers, zipping back what John had initially unzipped so fancily. As he redoes his buttons he flushes red to John's words. "You don't mind?"
Sherlock smiles as he reaches out his hand for John's. "Yes, John, I'll be your boyfriend."
John tries to think of a way to tell Sherlock over the next few weeks that they should prioritize their other responsibilities. As their friends and family sends more texts questioning where they are, she struggles in trying to starting to discuss it as any touch or word from Sherlock seems to set her off just as bad as Sherlock is working to distract her and she's feeling it's hard to object the idea them touching and fucking each other all over is the best way to let the time pass, others be damned.
"It does seem rather rude," Sherlock jokes as a weak smile approaches his face. "I suppose this is the part where you say we're just friends and apologize for the rest of it."
Sherlock can't find it in his mind to understand the behavior or the forgiveness, but follows John into the coffee shop nonetheless, eager to hear more. John orders both of them teas and some cookies before leading Sherlock to a table by a couch, which they both take their seats on.
John chuckles. "You will have lots of time to figure that out later if you'd like."
"Sherlock, I didn't mean," John tries to amend, but Sherlock is already getting up and is halfway out the door. John hurries after him as the same cab as before pulls up.
Sherlock slowly pulls his lips from John's member. "Sorry, that was unexpected."
Sherlock pauses for a moment before stopping his motion to reply momentarily. "That was the original intention," Sherlock says with another gulp before Sherlock purses his lips together tighter as he resumes movement.
Sherlock pulls away only long enough to yank away her soaking pants before he's back licking between her folds, deep into her. She attempts not to scream out as Sherlock so skillfully plays his tongue against her, dipping and swirling in all of the right ways. It's when Sherlock adds his fingers that she really starts shaking against him and Sherlock has to use his free hand to steady her thigh. He moves to pump his fingers deeper into her while he moves to focus his tongue on her clit and that's when she can't take another moment and explodes for him. Sherlock comes back out from under her dress smirking. "I need to clean up a bit before I go, as you might want to as well," Sherlock smiles as he offers his clean hand to her, "Round 2?"
Sherlock waits for John to take a good sip of his tea before replying. "So John Watson, army doctor/porn star is it?"
"Too tired for me to kiss you?" John asks as he reaches down to kiss his Sherlock.
"Yeah, okay, case," John mutters angrily almost under his breath. "We literally are stuck in a closet, murderers outside, and unable to move until they leave."
John continues to thrust until he hits a breaking point, reaching down and grabbing Sherlock's member in his hand and tugs on it sensually. "I need you to come, Sherlock, please. I can't last much longer."
"Now look who's overeager," John says as he pulls away, reaching up on his toes to peck Sherlock's lips.
Mycroft, which to John had just looked like a man simply sitting on a bench reading a newspaper, puts the paper down and glares at Sherlock. "I just need to speak with John for a moment."
John smiles and mouths thank you before she leans down over Lestrade's shoulder to let him know they are leaving and Lestrade awkwardly waves as they run out the door. John turns off their stove and practically runs to the bathroom and strips off her dress to jump in with Sherlock.
Sherlock smiles and nods, knowing there are more cold-case files in his room. Sherlock gets to the stairs before he stops in his tracks. "John, this is the way to your room."
John goes home and Sherlock is already there, looking out the window, playing his violin. John walks until he is a few steps away from the detective before he speaks. "I didn't mean to chase you away."
Sherlock's eyes light up. "You remember?"
Sherlock nods. John moves forward and places his lips more gently than the first time on Sherlock's. It's tentative, simple, Sherlock tries thinking it out in maneuvering in his head, the movements he's to make. Then the feelings seep in and his brain starts going mushy again, and it's all about the way John's lips feel against his and thought has disappeared into instinct.
"To think, this all started because John, what a beautiful lady you made," Sherlock hums his appreciation, "but you can't imagine how handsome of a man you are."
John shivers as Sherlock's hands move down from the arms of his jacket to grasp around John's hips, pressing himself forward against John's back. John leans his head back onto Sherlock's shoulder. "You aren't making it easy to be gentlemanly."
"Nothing's off limits," Sherlock whispers softly. They kiss and they start to move against each other, moaning into each other's lips at the change in sensation of grinding against one another. John focuses in on Sherlock's neck and Sherlock can't help but start panting. "Feels, so good, please."
"Sherlock," John can't form words past Sherlock's name as she nods. Unfortunately, before she can take his hand, there is a knock on the door. "Shit, you go…clean up, I'll stall them."
"That assisted your PTSD into quickly worsening because you felt isolated, you didn't like Harry because she was throwing away her marriage and your relationship didn't work out," Sherlock finds himself amazed as he pieces everything together.
"If you must," Sherlock says. As John goes to move her fingers to the keypad of her phone, Sherlock's hands are on her, stroking her thighs before his hands meet the hem of her little black dress and she drops the phone. He pulls the dress clean off of her before his hands find her breasts. "Forgot something else as well," Sherlock makes a noise low in his throat as he kneads them with his hands, latching his mouth to her neck.
"I, um, I don't think, I'm tired can we maybe talk about this at a later time?" John says, brushing everything off as easily as he can.
Sherlock chuckles. "I don't think I'd have it any other way. But before I get too lost in you, I have something to say, and I really want you to hear me this time because - "
