Mia's face lit up as she smiled and turned to Sam then said, "SHE JUST SAID PLEASE! SHE JUST SAID A NEW WORD!"
I like this quote because it shows that no matter who or what you are, we're all scared of not knowing and not living and that essentially puts us all on the same level. We should all love and care for/about each other because we never know when we're not going to be here anymore.
Ben said, "Ever since my mom died I've just felt so lost and empty. Even being around you guys and having my dad, I just still feel so alone. And I feel like I should be okay now but I miss her so much. I mean she wasn't always around a lot but I know that's because she had to work her butt off all the time. And she's my mom. She's all I ever knew," then started crying and leaned on Mia.
Next was government and nothing too interesting happened there, though Mia enjoyed the current events section at the beginning of class.
Mia said, "yeah. [A few beats of silence] Is there anything else you want to say or talk about?"
They both sat down at the table and Claire said, "yeah this is great! I'm not used to being away from the girls for this long, especially Kaia, but it's nice to be able to just hang out and not have to worry about anything."
When the festival was over, Dean and Cas got one more hot dog and one more cotton candy each then ate it while walking back to where they first came, just enjoying each other, Miracle, and the night sky. After they finished eating, Cas whooshed them back home and they showered then went to bed in their matching pajamas, Cas in Dean's arms and Miracle on the bed at their feet.
Cas did that damn head tilt and eye squint then said, "no Dean you're not crazy. I think they look alike too."
Mia woke up and quickly turned off her alarm so it didn't wake up Sam and Charlie - he didn't need to get up for another hour and she just didn't need to be up yet - then got in the shower.
When Ben finished, he put everything back then went to look for Dean and when he found him, Dean was counting the money from the safe to put into the drawers. As he was putting the 100's in there, Ben said, "Hey Dad, I'm done."
They both got to the game room at the same time and quietly but quickly walked to the board games.
Jack smiled and said, "thank you, Mia. Would you like to see more?"
He said, "You ready to go?"
The girl started crying as Sam and Ben realized they were all still exposed and could get attacked again at any time.
Claire said, "yeah! What do you wanna play?!" as she started walking out of the room.
"When?"
Jack made a pained face but said, "yes. He was harder to... forgive but, as God I need to give everyone a second chance and he asked for one as well so he also got wiped then sent to training."
The guy said, "if there's a single scratch, I will sue," then walked into the shop.
Claire said okay then they both slowly snuck out of their rooms.
Mia said, "well, what are we going to do until then?"
The rest of the day was great. They worked on the car that came in last night, an old '84 Mustang, in between other customers and goofed off in between that, pulling pranks on Carlos and the other guys in the store.
Band class went by pretty smoothly and the teacher always kept extra instruments so Mia got to play a little bit again. Ben played the trumpet and that's what Mia used to play so they shared music and Mia followed along really well!
Sam said, "Oh. I'm sorry," as he pulls her into his chest and onto the bed then continues, "you know her anniversary is coming up soon."
He said, "because I just got off of a double shift and I hear everyone else complaining about theirs after a few hours."
Ben said okay then continued with his homework, even dancing in his seat a little.
Jack said, "we don't but we still do sometimes."
Sam said, "so did we but Dean how- how did you figure it out?"
*Flashback*
Cas said, "I'm not sure. She's been here for awhile and she was just added to my rotation last week so no one really told me much."
She smiled and grabbed his hand, cracking the door so they could hear Charlie if she woke up as they walked out to the kitchen.
Dean said, "Cas, this- this is amazing! Wow!"
Mia looked up and said, "yeah where are we going?"
She said okay then walked to her room while Sam was sitting at the table looking at something for a case he was working on.
Then, it was FINALLY lunch time, good thing too because Mia was starving.
Sam worked while Mia read for about 2 hours before she closed her book and went back over to Sam.
Ben turned to Dean and said, "you really talk about me that much?"
Mia turned around and said, "Hey, go back to sleep baby."
He said, "kinda. Cas had the idea of making them separate but together and allowing people to go to other heavens if they wanted but I came up with the house, which is where they all sleep."
Mia said, "yeah I wanna check on Charlie first though."
Once Cas was dressed, he pulled Dean out of his thoughts and said, "Dean, ready to go?"
Hannah said, "no I've got a dead girlfriend inside."
So, every morning when I brush my teeth and wash my face, I repeat this mantra to myself in the mirror while looking myself in the eyes. Then, after I say "I love me," I kinda give myself a mom look for a moment then soften my expression and really look for the beauty in my face. I'm not perfect and have days where I see more/less of things I like/dislike but slowly I'm feeling better about myself and finding more things I like than dislike about my face. I started it on the first of the year and it's really helped me so I thought this week I'd share it with you guys. Y'all are welcome to use it yourself or tweak it/add to it if you want, in fact I encourage you to do so. I really suggest you come up with at least one positive thing to say to yourself every morning in the mirror because, whether you think it will or not, it really does help and I actually started looking forward to doing it after a few days. Also, if you do use this, add to it, and/or come up with your own, I'd love to hear how it's helped you or what you added to it or came up with! (Sorry this explanation ended up being kinda long but I just wanted to express how much it's helped me and how I think it'll help you. üòÅ)
Cas smiled and said, "okay c'mon," then walked inside.
She said, "I think I found a case and I know you're done hunting but I could use your help."
Ben smiled and threw his arms around Dean then looked up at him and said, "wait, how many kids did you tell him you had?!"
have a girlfriend who basically lives there so I think she's next."
Dean said, "umm well what kind of questions do you have for me?"
Mia looked up and said, "huh? Oh, um," then smiled wide and continued, "pretty much since she got here."
Mrs. Walton said, "no problem. I saw the way you changed and how your eyes got excited when I said what we were reading so I thought I'd give you a chance."
(See the end of the chapter for
At the shop, Dean showed Mia around the same way he did Ben while going around and unlocking the doors. When that was done, Dean went to the office and showed Mia everything he had to do on the computer and how to count all the money. He even let Mia do a few things when she asked because it seemed interesting and helped her write better if she actually did it.
Ben laughed and said, "Yeah like that'll ever happen," then they pulled apart as Dean came in the door.
Mia hugged him again and said, "of course. I'd love to listen to you and learn about your mom. I'm sure she was amazing since I know she's the only person that could come close to the way Dean loves Cas," then pushed him slightly and said, "now go say hi to your dad," and smiled as Ben got a huge smile on his face and ran to hug him like he was 5.
They walked to his class and went through the same routine of introducing Mia to the teacher then sat down. As they sat down, Mia said, "so do you have practice today?"
Mia quietly cracked the door enough for her to slip through. She walked to Charlie's crib and stood, watching her for a minute, then carefully kissed her forehead and said, "bye baby girl. I love you," and walked back out to say bye to Sam.
She said, "it was like 2 days after I'd decided to join Sam and Dean and we stopped at the bunker between hunts to restock on some stuff and so that I could get a little tour of it. Anyway, we were reloading the car and Dean had me put the cooler in while he finished something else. I walked into the garage and was looking down so all I heard was a loud 'buzzz' then looked up and saw Cas on top of the Impala. Naked. And covered in bees. I guess he was waiting for Dean and wanted to surprise him, again. Cas didn't notice me for a minute but when he did, he started blushing and scrambling to explain then eventually just poofed out."
When they got there, it was a similar scene to the one she'd just left but in this one, Sam is cooking and Jess is coming home from work. As Sam comes out of the kitchen, Jess sets her stuff down then picks up a baby girl and kissed her forehead before Sam kisses Jess's lips. The baby starts whining a little so Jess gently rocks her to sleep as I, or well Heaven me I suppose, knocks on the door. Sam opens and gives me a hug, Jess coming a few seconds later. Sam goes back to cooking and Jess and I talk in the living room while she starts on grading papers and I go through Sam's case to help him out. I never saw myself going to law school but at the same time could see me helping him out in that way.
Once he let go, Mia said, "how long have you worked here?"
"Eileen?! What are you doing here?!" Cas said.
Once they got to Ben's room, they sat down on the bed next to each other and Mia said, "what's up?"
Sam and Mia both said, "Stanford!"
"Mia, you ready?"
He said, "well it was work. No one new today but I did have to meet with my boss today for my yearly review and she gave me a pretty nice raise."
Mis said, "that's so sad. I'll definitely come back and visit her."
After a few minutes, she looked at Jack and said, "thank you. Can we go see Jess now?"
About a week later, Dean came home from work and saw Mia at the table writing while Ben was across from her doing homework. By the number of books he had around him, Dean assumed it was something like Chemistry or Math. Dean walked over to give them both hugs but Mia refused until he showered so he sat down then asked where the kids and Sam were.
Mia said, "okay. So we have to be up at like 8?"
Mia laughed and said, "I suppose so," as Cas started going around and checking all of the her IV's and other vitals.
Mia said, "oh my gosh! What happened?"
Once they sat down, it was silent for a few minutes while Ben checked his phone and answered texts.
Hannah said thanks then walked away as they walked to the Impala.
Mia said, "this sounds like an amazing place to work. I will let you get back to it though. Keep it up, Carlos."
For the first week, I chose a quote by Jared that I just heard him say in his and Jensen virtual Creation panel when I finally watched it like last week. He says, "I think it's the mistakes that make something perfect." He may have been talking about how the demon blade got connected together backward and how it then had to stay that way for the rest of the show but I still found it really inspiring and sweet.
Dean, who was absentmindedly scratching Miracle's head and staring at the ceiling, said, "hmmm?"
They went to Mary's first since it was closer and Mia saw a beautiful scene of Mary and the boys making dinner together. Then, John came home from work so the boys ran to say hi as Dean gets scooped up into his dads arms. They all look happy and Dean truly looks untouched - undamaged.
Jack smiled then portaled them to Heaven. To him, it was slow, like driving a car to the gas station, but for Mia it was instantaneous.
Mia said, "yeah that's where Sam and I met."
Dean smiled as they walked off because they were having so much fun that they didn't want to go to bed. He almost gave in just because of that but knew Jody would have his hide if she found out he let Claire stay up any later.
"Yes. The law says they're allowed to have their wings out as much as they want as long as they're not disturbing anyone and she was in a pretty empty store when the owner came and asked her to put them away. Anna did nothing wrong and wasn't even knocking stuff over when she walked."
Mia and Ben both said, "Ruby?!" then Mia yelled for Sam and Jack as Ben yelled, "Dad!," knowing both Dean and Cas would come running.
Mia looked up at him and said, "yeah next week right?"
He came out about 10 minutes later and kissed Mia's head as she handed him a plate with avocado toast on it.
At the end of the game, Ben had won but Claire refused to let him so she called for a rematch and that happened about 3 more times before Dean came in and said, "hey guys I know you're having fun and I love that you are but it's late and I still have to keep you on some sort of schedule even though it's the weekend."
Mia said, "all the time. I think about her every day, her number is still in my phone even."
They were in the shaded field area away from the actual playground and standing in front of a picnic splayed out.
Everyone said okay then Ben said, "Can I go?!"
Sam breathed out, "Dean!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean said, "oh hell no! Not happening again!"
He said okay and she walked to the car then blasted Who You'd Be Today by Kenny Chesney on repeat and cried.
Mia walked into her room smiling and Sam, who was sitting on the bed, looked up and said, "Hey babe. What you thinking about?"
At home, they walked in laughing and Sam, who was at the table, could immediately tell they had had an amazing day and couldn't wait to hear about it over dinner.
As Ben went to sit down, Dean said, "You
Sam kissed Mia then sat down and they ate while laughing and talking about their day for like an hour then Dean and Ben went to bed.
Marg said, "Cas! Much better now that you're here!"
Ben took Charlie into his room and laid her in her crib next to his bed, rubbing her back to get her to fall asleep, which she did pretty quickly.
Jack loved that they taught him all they did but sometimes hated that he was the only one they were explaining something to. Mia loved Sam,
She heard him get up then she walked to get dressed herself and chose a pair of jeans with her favorite Stanford shirt and one of Sam's flannels.
They talked and ate and people watched for about 2 hours then decided to take Miracle on the trail.
A/N - hope you like it! There's a few references in here, like usual lol. Remember: Always Keep Fighting, Love Yourself First, You Are Not Alone, and You Define You. Love y'all!
Carlos said, "since it opened. I was the first person Dean hired and I'll be the last to leave if something happened to this place."
Tessa and Sam sat down and she said, "so, how's the case you have now?"
Cas smiled and said, "yes, AM."
Mia said Sam went for a run and the kids were down for their naps. Dean said okay then said, "Hey Ben, how would you like to come to work with me tomorrow?"
At the beginning of February, Gen shared her and Shep's intentions for the month and I commented saying I'd be more like Shep and be a penguin. Gen liked the comment so I told myself now I had to at least be a penguin for a few minutes so I made a video of myself waddling and sent it to my friend then the other day wrote the quote of the week on my water bottle as a reminder to just loosen up and have fun more and be more like a kid a little more often.
*next morning*
She said, "you know I'm still only at the beginning. How was work?"
This is a line from my friend's (Nayeliq1 on both Wattpad and AO3) book Happiness Is(n't) In the Having - which you should read if you ship Destiel - and to me, it's so true. You don't think about it until something happens but the things that end up hurting you the most are the ones that you love the most. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't love or get close to things but to me, it means that the pain shows how deeply you loved something, and the more pain you feel, the more and deeper you loved it.
After they were done eating, Sam said, "you ready to go, babe?"
Sam walked in and said, "Eileen! It is you! What's the case?"
"What you working on baby?" She said and stood over his shoulder.
The first person to perform did a cover of Can't Help Falling In Love by Elvis and Cas seemed to really enjoy it. It was now Dean's turn to watch Cas in amazement and wonderment. He couldn't help but get lost in those blue eyes and perfect face and fuck he loved that angel more than anything, except Sammy.
Hannah nodded and Sam said, "okay. I need you to get it and then you and Ben need to get close to me and once we're together I need you to pour a circle around us."
They smiled and laughed then Ben told her to set it up and pick her balls then break them.
Dean sat down and smiled again then said, "Good. I'm glad they're getting along."
*next morning*
Little Charlie jumped up and put her arms out to be picked up by Charlie, who grabbed her and said, "how's my mini me?!" as Mia said, "it's good! I've gotten a good chunk written. I'll write more after everyone leaves and the kids are in bed if I'm not too tired."
Sam said, "okay babe. Love you!"
She said, "because you're like famous around here for what happened to your girlfriend."
After all the hugging was over, everyone helped bring the food out and they served themselves then talked and ate for like 2 hours until the kids got too impatient and wanted to open their presents. Everyone gathered around the giant tree, it went all the way up to the ceiling and the bottom was big enough for Little Charlie to stand under it almost, that Dean had asked Jack to make for them and put it in front of the stairs.
Quote of the week: Always Keep Fighting and Love Yourself First because I Am Enough and I am NOT Alone and I define me. I got this. There's nothing I can't do. I love me.
They walked to the crew room and as they did so, Cas pointed out different things like where his patients' rooms were and who was who then said whether he liked them or not.
In the crew room, a few other people were there and they all said hi as they passed Cas on the way out. One person stayed though, and Cas introduced them.
She said, "Hannah."
Dean said,¬† "Yup!" and Miracle barked then Cas smiled and told Dean to close his eyes before whooshing them to a park that was normally half an hour away.
Ruby said, "wait -"
he was going to be getting her though so she slept in a little bit later than she usually does; Sam got Charlie up since he'd taken the day off to spend with her weeks ago.
As they walked to their rooms, Cas was leaving for work so they all hugged then Ben said, "bye Dad!" while walking away.
They ate in silence for a few minutes before Sam said, "do you have any other questions?"
They said okay as they walked out of the room then raced down the hallway to see who could get there first.
She said, "Ben I have a 2-year-old, I'm a light sleeper. Plus, our rooms are next to each other and I have insomnia."
Jack said, "no. You have to be invited. But, no one would come in uninvited anyways because this is Heaven and we're all good and happy here. It's more a precaution. Cas has seen too my things go wrong that weren't supposed to."
(See the end of the chapter for
A few hours later, Dean walked in from work and could hear them laughing from the door. He smiled and set his stuff down then walked to check on them and saw them playing pool.
The 4 of them came in and said, "what?" then they all saw Ruby.
Mia smiled and said, "aw thanks."
Tessa said, "okay great. Usually, I have more for you but that's it for today." They started to stand up and as they walked to the door, Tessa said, "oh and Anna said that she's really grateful you're helping her."
Mia stood up then shook Sam awake, telling him he needed to go to bed and that she was going to go shower. He stretched then started cleaning his stuff up and was already back asleep when she got out of the shower.
Dean nodded his head and Mia went back to writing and remembered the first time she met Claire.
Ben nodded then a white light came from Cas's hand as Ben yelled but did his best to play it off like his other dad would then sat down when Cas finished.
"Yes but the owner's arguing she was being disruptive and other stuff beforehand."
Mia smiled and said, "so it sounds like you like working here and work hard?"
Sam nodded then turned to Hannah and said, "do you know where she's buried?"
"Thanks... Eileen?"
Dean sat down and said, "that's fine sweetie but I need you to at least go in your rooms. You'll have all day to spend together if you want. And you know you're welcome here as much as you want Claire."
*morning (or night, depending on how you look at it)*
He trailed off and Sam said, "yeah. I'll be fine."
Mia and Eileen stayed up half the night talking about Sam and Eileen even told her about Ruby.
Mia nodded her head then let out another "wow..." as they walked into the cafeteria.
Mia said, "okay! Who are we gonna see first?"
Ben looked up at her and said, "How'd you know?"
Dean waved his hand at her and took a sip of his drink as he pulled out of the drive-thru.
Eileen handed her to Mia and said bye.
After they were done with that, they decided to go back to the hotel and changed then went out to Mia's favorite place to eat, a Mexican food place with really good tacos. They spent about 2 hours there eating and talking then went home and passed out pretty quickly.
Ben said, "yeah! Sure!" then ran and hugged his dad with a huge smile on his face. Dean smiled just as big and hugged back. Mia smiled too and thought to herself that Ben was probably excited because he
Dean said, "you, Jack, Claire, and Ash."
Eileen said, "yeah... I got a lot of stuff to get done at home."
Mia smiled down at her then kissed her head and said, "Hey baby girl, what's up."
Mia thought for a minute about asking to see her family or Jess but shook her head, not wanting to disturb them.
By now she's full on sobbing and Sam sees so he comes to comfort her as she cries into his shoulder repeating over and over again, "it's not fair. Why her. I miss her so much." Sam just rubbed her hair/back and did his best to soothe her. After about 10 minutes, she looked at him with bloodshot eyes and red cheeks from crying so much and said that she was gonna go to the car and let him have his time. He wiped the tears from her face then said, "are you sure?"
The first thing they did was go to the administrative office to get passes so they could get around campus. After they had their passes, they went to Sam's dorm hall he had as a freshman then Mia showed him hers. Next, they went and said hi to their old teachers. Only one of Sam's was still there but 2 of Mia's were. They talked to each teacher for about 5 minutes since it was between classes. All the teachers wished them luck and were happy to see them happy. Sam's teacher said he was glad to hear that he ended up finishing.
They sadly said okay then walked to the map room to say goodnight.
Mia said, "why's that?"
Mia smiled and came out of her flashback and saw that Sam was now playing with Little Charlie and Ash was asleep in the middle of the floor, that kid could fall asleep anywhere it was crazy. Then, she looked at Ben and saw him just sorta staring off into space and decided to go talk to him and see if he would let her connect with him at all.
As she looked around, she saw a long white hallway with a big open room at the end of it. In the hallway, there were various doors and in the big room, there were a bunch of angels walking around doing different things; it looked like the main room of an office.
Mia looked around in complete amazement for a while, just repeating wow over and over, and Jack watched with a smile.
A/N - Some Dad!Dean and cute/sweet sibling moments! Hope you enjoyed it bc I really enjoyed writing it! I've been obsessed with Eileen/Shoshannah lately so will probably be doing an Eileen focused chapter soon! Sorry I forgot to update last week! Still getting used to posting on here! Remember; Always Keep Fighting, Love Yourself First, You Are Not Alone, and You Define You. Love y'all!
Dean said okay then opened the garage door and waved them in. The customer pulled in then Dean showed them where to go to get inside the store. Once they were inside, he got under the car and checked all that he could while asking Ben about school. Once he saw that everything was good, Dean got out then lifted the hood and started asking Ben questions about where things were then showing him other things that he thought he might not know. Ben remembered a lot more than Dean thought he would from working on the Impala and was impressed.
The 5 of them stood at the edge of the campus under the cover of nightfall and Sam had a big grin on his face. They stood for a minute, assessing where to start, then Dean clapped his hands together and pointed to a building he figured out was the AKA house as he said, "alright we have to go there. Sam and Ben take the bottom floor, and Sam
Quote of the Week: Be more like Shep, be a penguin.
Sam shook his head and smiled saying, "like father like son."
A/N - Hope you enjoy!! Remember; Always Keep Fighting, Love Yourself First, You Are Not Alone, and You Define You. Love y'all!
The next morning they talked to Dean, Cas, and Jack, who were more than willing to let them go and keep Charlie. Mia and Sam left about 2 days later after figuring out that Cas was going to take some time off work to help watch the kids (usually Mia and Ben did it since she was writing still) and Charlie and Jody had both already agreed to watch them when it was needed.
‚ÄúFallout? Seriously?‚Äù

But then, Abby Voiced Dean, Castiel was attacked, Dean
Intellectually, Dean knows that the other man is just as much a victim as he is: neither of them gave their consent, they were both literally forced into their current positions against their will, but that doesn't make Dean feel any better about what's happening. Especially since he is still

Even then, every alternative would be explored, including the transplantation the fetus to a womb that

‚ÄúCharlie... Could you please explain that?‚Äù
something. ‚ÄúSo, where is he?‚Äù
‚ÄúBut-‚Äù

went down enough for him to pull out of Dean. That, however, didn't stop him from continually fisting Dean's aching cock. No, in fact, he seemed to go at the task with newfound vigor. He commanded Dean onto his back using that damned invisible force, then continued pumping Dean mercilessly until the Omega was a whimpering sobbing mess of need and desperation.
Dean looks up, and notices that Castiel is above him. ‚ÄúCas...?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes. You have a point.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood morning, Dean,‚Äù Cas's voice rumbled in greeting. The Alpha opened his eyes and smiled down at his mate before pressing a loving kiss to the top of Omega's head.
phase.‚Äù
"Who are you? Why the hell am I here?!" Blue-Eyes (as Dean has decided to dub him) demands after straightening back up. He has the graveliest, sexiest voice he's ever heard, like whiskey and chocolate. It was soothing and grating all at once, and the man himself was a sight to behold, and just as naked as Dean. He was all dark hair and lean muscle going all the way down to- nope,
He wandered down the aisles once again in search of a janitor's closet. Once he found one, he grabbed a mop and a wheeled bucket. He then filled the bucket with water from the conveniently-placed industrial sink with a hose attachment and added some cleaning liquid to it. He then grabbed an extra bucket that looked pretty clean for holding pickles. At the last minute, he grabbed a rag, just in case, and shoved it halfway into his back pocket, then headed back out to where he'd left his mess.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Benny answered. ‚ÄúAlmost everyone gets assigned jobs that match their talents. You woulda been put in the garage to work under Caleb anyways, so this works out.‚Äù
just a few hours. The two of them continued on and soon they were turning into the kitchen. They paused in the doorway for a moment to take in the sight.
‚ÄúYeah, that was my thinkin' too.‚Äù There was a moment's pause, then Benny said, ‚ÄúSo when ya wanna get started?‚Äù
This one doesn't slam its way out of his body like the others, but it lasts so much longer. His head is thrown back, his eyes are closed, his hips are in the air, and his mouth is opened in a perfect O. Just as he thinks Cas is gonna let him pass out from this one, it finally stops, and he falls back into his seat, breathing hard, heart beating out of his chest, and a thin sheen of sweat forming on his skin ‚Äì which is so sensitive, every movement sends waves of electricity coursing through his body. His clothes have suddenly become very constricting. He doesn't even care that Sam is unconscious right next him.
He finally looked up to meet the eyes of the two Omegas in front of him. They wore twin expressions of shock and disgust at being spoken to in such a manner. Nevertheless, they did as they were told and vacated the area, following their bond-mates down the hall, muttering something to themselves about indignities and retribution.
While Cas had been working, Dean's naughty hand and wondered to his throbbing cock and had begun furiously pounding away, still achingly desperate for a release that is yet to come. Cas thinks about removing the offending appendage, but then thinks better of it. Dean can stroke himself as much as he wants, but it won't change the fact that he won't come until Castiel is ready for him to.
to his body to make that possible. He also noticed that Cas was nailing his prostate like it was his damn job; and most of all, he noticed his own cock, swollen and heavy, lying neglected against his stomach. It gave a little bob every time Cas thrusted inside of him, causing the tiniest bit of delicious friction to the head.
, but he was still thinking a mile a minute. There just
‚ÄúDean!‚Äù Castiel scolded harshly, his fingers tightening on Dean's thighs, his voice taking on a timbre that demanded obedience. Though he didn't mean to do it, it did have the desired effect of stopping Dean from further belittling himself in his presence. ‚ÄúI never want to hear that kind of talk coming from you again! Understand?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, he shouldn't bother you guys anymore, for a while at least. But if he
Conference Room A.
Dean broke the kiss momentarily to ask, with his voice full of confusion and incredulity, ‚ÄúWhy the hell is my ass leaking?!‚Äù
‚ÄúNAY!!‚Äù The Betas shouted in unison.
The attention finally got Dean's notice and the Omega opened his eyes wide to watch his mate as the Alpha worshiped his body. Dean watched as Cas continued lower, gently kissing Dean's abdomen, dipping his tongue into his bellybutton. He dragged his tongue down until it reached the elastic band of Dean's boxer briefs where he planted one more kiss. Then, Cas hooked his fingers on the waistband and pulled them down and out of the way.
‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Dean said, astounded. ‚ÄúI hadn't even thought about that.‚Äù He glanced back over towards the suits hanging from the wall. ‚ÄúSo I guess I'm gonna have to wear one of those, huh?‚Äù
‚ÄúHm,‚Äù is all the Alpha said.
‚ÄúWell, alright then. But I hope you don't mind, I've kinda got my hands full here with this rebuild.‚Äù
?! You're making me nervous.‚Äù
‚ÄúDean?‚Äù the Alpha ran through the main living area, but his mate wasn't in sight. ‚ÄúDean!‚Äù he ran down the hall and to their bedroom calling out his mate's name as he went.
‚ÄúAbout another 45 minutes or so,‚Äù Benny answered.
his pups, will be fine. And it's not like this is going to be all that stressful, anyway. It's just a retrieval mission. We shouldn't even need to bring a security detail.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, our little Omega stooges have served their purposes. We're looking into viable candidates to fill their positions as well.‚Äù
There was a chorus of grunts and half-formed utterances as greeting, but Donna didn't seem to mind, or notice. She bounded into the room and helped herself to the simple breakfast of eggs, toast, and coffee.
a lifetime of getting to know you to realize what an amazing person you are. I can look into your eyes and know
‚ÄúNothing, it's just... I saw a lot of the other Omegas nearly jumping out of their seats to help the child before her father intervened.‚Äù
of the facility!‚Äù He let Dean go and began pacing and gesturing wildly. ‚ÄúI have no clue how long I'll be gone. They couldn't fucking
Cas doesn't seem happy with that answer, but he apparently has no better suggestions so he just finds a corner and plops down. Dean does the same, going straight back to the same corner he was in before, knees pulled up to his chest, hands resting on his knees. He tries his damnedest not to stare at the other man, who doesn't appear to be affected by his nudity at all. One of his legs is stretched out in front of him and his arm is resting on the knee of his other leg that just slightly bent. He looks relaxed- or as relaxed as one can be in a situation like this.
It seemed like forever, but Alistair's knot finally,
‚ÄúIt didn't take much to come to the conclusion that she was working for the Alpha Councilmen. So we had to come up with a different plan, and quick.‚Äù Jody took a breath and looked pleadingly at everyone at the table, including Gabriel who had stopped his pacing but still looked livid. ‚ÄúYou're right. We planned this poorly. There's so much we could have done differently. And we
‚ÄúWell, my triangle appears to point up, while yours points down. I believe they are meant to indicate our sexual positions: I've been designated as the 'top' and you are the 'bottom'.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you...‚Äù he paused, swallowed hard, ‚Äúare you sure you don't remember anything from when we were separated?‚Äù
‚ÄúI'll see you later, Dean.‚Äù He licked his lips, still tasting his mate's mouth against his own.
When Dean was ready, he explained to Cas everything Meg had said, and the images it elicited in his mind once she'd left. But not just images. Sounds, scents and sensations accompanied what he'd seen, painting a vivid image of a scene that couldn't possibly have happened.
‚ÄúSo, how do ya propose we do that, darlin'? Fightin' fire with fire?‚Äù
Cas, on the other hand, did not seem to have such a compunction.
Dean smiled indulgently and dropped the empty duffle bags he was still carrying on the floor. Cas noticed them for the first time, but before he could question Dean about them, the Omega wrapped his arms around his panicking mate and guided the Alpha's head to the crook of his neck, hoping that his scent would help to calm his nerves. It worked, and the scorched scent of distressed Alpha quickly dissipated.
‚ÄúDammit!‚Äù He cursed again. Was it supposed to be like that? Or were some of the lights supposed to remain lit? He didn't know. Anxious about having to face Ellen's wrath, he shoved the rag back into his pocket, then reached in and gingerly ran his fingers over the darkened display, hoping maybe he could fix it. Somehow. He had a screwdriver, after all!
‚ÄúWhat d'you mean?‚Äù Benny asked, suddenly on high alert.
‚ÄúWell, yeah. I couldn't help it. Alfie said it was just part of my new biology. But I promise,
He started off by explaining how his conversation with Meg seemed to knock a few memories loose; then he told her about his nervous breakdown he'd had when Cas found him. Then about the need to just get out and
Sensing the true motivation behind Dean's distress, the Alpha stepped closer to his Omega and wrapped a comforting arm around the frightened man's shoulders, drawing him into a warm embrace. ‚ÄúShush, now,‚Äù he cooed. ‚ÄúI told you before that everything's gonna be alright and I meant it.‚Äù
‚ÄúPretty good, and yourself?‚Äù Hector shook Dean's hand in greeting as soon as the Omega was within reach.
Cas chuckled again. He was relieved Dean was taking this all so well. By the time they were finished discussing the events of the past few days, the swelling in Cas's knot had gone down enough for him to gingerly pull out of Dean's hole, which actually involuntarily clenched around the member, trying to keep it in.
Cas took another deep breath. ‚ÄúThey removed the bullet and sewed you up. You had lost just enough blood for your pressure to drop rapidly, which is why you passed out, but you didn't lose quite enough to require a transfusion.‚Äù He took a deep, steadying breath, the Omega's rich scent doing wonders. ‚ÄúYou were very lucky, Dean. And our pups. We were able to check on them, and they seem to be just fine.‚Äù
The thought sort of blind-sided him and he didn't really know what to make of it. The two of them had been thrown together and forced to mate and bond and reproduce, but he ‚Äì neither of them ‚Äì had had any choice in the matter. And sure he was fond of the guy. Cas was thoughtful and kind and patient and Dean felt like he could relax and be himself around the Alpha. But when did he start feeling like he
‚Äú'Missing'?‚Äù Jody asked. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What happened to him?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah. There are certain stops along the most commonly taken routes to and from the facilities. We're gonna stop at one soon and y'all can get out then while we refuel.‚Äù
Charlie became uncomfortable. She looked at Dean apologetically, sympathy clear in her voice as she said, ‚ÄúI'm sorry, Dean. I know you're uncomfortable with this, but an appointment like this is mandatory. Prenatal care is highly important.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, okay. See ya, Cas.‚Äù Dean smirked to himself when he saw Cas's tongue darting from inside his mouth. He'd most definitely have to give his mate something
the happiness flowing off of the Alpha in waves. Maybe if he was lucky he could be infested with some of that happiness too. Well, he could at least
‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù Sam said before either of the Beta Councilman could answer. ‚ÄúYou guys said you had a plan to stop them... and now you have them.‚Äù He cut them a dangerous look. ‚ÄúWas
like it, huh?‚Äù Gabriel retorted. ‚ÄúDidn't you notice how odd they were acting right before the attack? Jody was looking around like she was
Also, I feel I should mention that Charlie doesn't know about what happened to Dean. The only ones who know about that part of Phase 2 are the Alphas (like Alistair) who are a part of that portion of the phase, and the people who are in charge.
Sometime later, Dean and Cas were able to finish their abandoned meals. Then, the same Omega who had served them ‚Äì with the emblem of two concentric circles on her sleeve, a symbol of service status ‚Äì came and took away their dishes. Afterwards, the three of them took a short bathroom break, each of them using one of the three lavatories ‚Äì one for each of the primary designations: Alpha, Beta and Omega. It was surprising to see that there were actual toilets and sinks in the bathrooms, instead of the strange fountains that they'd become accustomed to.
Two of their other neighbors, whom Cas and Dean still had not met, were standing in the hallway looking in at the bloody scene before them. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù one of them asked. It was another Alpha female with her Omega mate behind her, staring wide-eyed with a hand covering her face. She must have been the one who screamed.
Jody met Benny's eyes in the mirror. He shook his head slightly before turning his gaze back to the road ahead.
‚ÄúAlright, if we're just about done with the dramatics, I've got a lizard that needs drainin',‚Äù the Councilman made his way to the open door on the other side of the room, which led to a hallway.
‚ÄúNoted. Now, who's going first?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Dean said. ‚ÄúAren't you worried about more people know about the mission?‚Äù
But, I feel like I owe you guys an explanation (you can skip this part if you don't care). So much has been happening since my last update and I just haven't been able to get to it. I've moved twice, faced the prospect of homelessness in the process (luckily it didn't come to that) and I had to give up my dog because the only place I could afford has a 20lbs weight limit on dogs and my boy weighs a lot more than 20lbs. (but, I plan on getting him back as soon as I can afford a better place)
‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Dean enthusiastically agreed.
what had happened to them, and the Alphas who were involved were all on fertility blockers while working, so mated Omegas couldn't get pregnant by an Alpha that wasn't their's. So what was the big deal?
Charlie led them down to a door with a placard next to it that read, ‚ÄúConference Room J‚Äù. She pressed down on the door handle and swung the door open, gesturing with her arms for them to enter ahead of her.
‚Äù Dean answered shortly, seeming to lose his patience.
retinal scanners, Benny? Really. Paranoid much?‚Äù Jody snickered.
do,‚Äù she informed him, ‚Äúis get your ass over to Conference Room A. We've gotta talk.
Well, there's nothing they could do about it. The only thing
‚ÄúSo... how do you feel about carrying his pups if you dislike him so much?‚Äù
eat fruits and veggies and healthy fats like nuts and avocados?‚Äù The disgusted look on the Omega's face told the doctor everything he needed to know. ‚ÄúYa-huh,‚Äù doctor Rufus grumbled with a knowing look in Cas's direction.
‚ÄúCan...‚Äù he swallowed and licked his lips, ‚Äúcan I see him?‚Äù The shock of being pregnant suddenly took a back seat to the fact that Dean had other family somewhere.
In the center of the glass wall was a glass door and a metal keypad with a retinal scanner to the left of it. Jody stepped up to it, punched in a ridiculously long series of numbers, and then leaned down for the scanner to read her eyeball through the plastic of her hood. Before long, there was a heavy clunk and Jody opened the door and allowed everyone to follow into the room behind her.
‚ÄúYes, Dean. Listen to her, there are still things we should talk about before we go.‚Äù
The sight made Dean feel uneasy. Having seen enough, he decided to avert his gaze and instead take in the other sights around them, beyond the street and the metal graveyard.
The Alpha smiled and squeezed Dean's shoulder again. ‚ÄúIt'll be fine. Don't worry.‚Äù
(See the end of the chapter for
Red on his fists.
‚ÄúWhy? What do you remember? Did something happen to
worried about him. Can you tell me where he is?‚Äù If Alfie was willing to talk again, Cas surely wasn't going to waste the opportunity. Just as Alfie opened his mouth to give some sort of response, they were interrupted by a familiar, yet unwelcome, command:
Well that doesn't sound ominous at all, now does it? ‚ÄúI don't like the sound of that, Alfie.‚Äù
who you are. You're strong, kind, funny, beautiful and so,
‚ÄúDefinitely.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy head is starting to hurt,‚Äù Dean complained, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúIt's just a good thing you didn't give in.‚Äù
He finished off with telling them about how Alistair basically admitted to raping him, Cas losing his temper, Dean pulling him off of the vile pervert. Finally, he completed his recounting with Al saying all of those disgusting things. Seeing nothing but red. Just... red. Everywhere.
‚ÄúThis is still a very nice apartment, Dean.‚Äù Cas wrapped an arm around his mate's back and placed a gentle hand on his opposite shoulder. ‚ÄúIt's sure a far cry from our
The stayed still for a few moments before either of them spoke. Just breathing and trying to get their raging heartbeats under control, while exchanging a few languid kisses on lips, necks and shoulders. Cas was still battling his inexplicable urge to sink his teeth into Dean's flesh, particularly the bit where his shoulder and neck meet. It didn't help that, for some reason, Dean now had his face buried in the crook of Cas's neck as well, breathing deeply.
grab another pickle jar to take back upstairs. He stood back up and quickly finished mopping up the rest of the juice. He put the mop and bucket back in the janitor's closet then went back to the aisle where he'd left the cart and the other bucket full of pickles.
‚ÄúBecause it's gonna be okay, Cas.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah. I can manage,‚Äù Dean confirmed.
it's gonna happen again. And soon! If the look on his brother's face is any indication. But he's just gonna pretend not to see that too.
Then there was a shot.
‚ÄúHmm...‚Äù the doctor repeated, brow furrowing, still prodding at Dean's middle.
‚ÄúWe're basically gonna be reshapin' the entire Council, ya know that?‚Äù
‚ÄúHoly shit, we're outside,‚Äù Dean breathed. Then he immediately huffed in frustration as he realized the situation: he was finally outside but he couldn't even enjoy it because of the stupid suit he had to wear. He wanted nothing more than to get a breath of fresh air and feel a breeze on his face, but it was not to be. He quickly sat back in his seat, his suit crinkling in the process.
That got Benny's attention.
‚Äù He shuddered dramatically. ‚Äú
Charlie chuckled at that before answering. ‚ÄúFuck buddies! That's a good one.‚Äù
After a moment of consideration, Cas asked, ‚ÄúYes. Why was I put in a room and told to 'mate' with Alfie? I just don't see the point in that. The whole 'Phase Two' thing.‚Äù
, except more bare walls. "I guess not," he admits. He seems to deflate a bit, suddenly looking like he doesn't know what else to do. He almost seems a bit defeated.
Dean's body. Not outside of it. On the ground. On Dean's chest. On Castiel's chest. Tacky and drying his on hands.
Cas merely shrugged unapologetically. ‚ÄúMy... protectiveness wouldn't let me stay away for long; and once you were stable I saw no reason for there to be so many people around you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know, it's gonna be okay,‚Äù Dean answered, ‚Äúbecause I'm coming with you.‚Äù
Red on the floor.
There were voices. Vague and far away.
Following the doctor's orders, Dean got up on the examination table and sat back, paper rustling, crinkling and tearing beneath him a bit as he moved, and rested his head on the flimsy pillow that was provided. Once on his back, he hooked his fingers beneath the hem of his shirt and raised it enough to expose his belly.
~*~*~*~
The space was massive, especially when compared to the space that Dean and Cas have shared, and it had the feel of a large lobby from some fancy corporate office building, complete with floor-to-ceiling windows, except they couldn't see the door that led outside. Which was for the best, since the sky was overcast and it seemed to be raining.
‚ÄúWhen's the next lecture? I'd very much like to attend.‚Äù Cas asked, clearly interested. Dean snapped his head over to look at the Alpha as if he'd sprouted a second head.
about it, am I right?‚Äù
It was about time he got some answers.
She waved her key card in front of the black panel to the right of the door, just like before, and the door clicked and swung open. She stood to the side and motioned in the direction of the open doorway. ‚ÄúAfter you.‚Äù
Five pups! He could hardly even imagine it. How does someone wrap their head around a thing like that? How does something like that even
‚ÄúDean!‚Äù He lied Dean down on the floor and caressed his cheeks and patted his face, calling his name over and over, but Dean stayed lifeless. Cas began to panic as he shook Dean's shoulders and screamed his name, trying to rouse him, but still, there was nothing. No response. ‚ÄúDean! Please! Don't... don't...‚Äù Cas stammered as he suddenly felt a fog descending on his mind.
The smokey scent underlying her natural pheromones made Dean's brow crease and his lip curl in displeasure, but he quickly schooled his features so as not to offend the other Omega, but something in his own scent must have tipped her off because Meg looked at him with a single raised eyebrow.
commit murder. A rather bloody and violent crime in this case,‚Äù she very pointedly glanced over to the stains then back at the couple. ‚ÄúAnd he was an Alpha. We need all the Alphas and Omegas we can get to produce more offspring and repopulate.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you, Marco. Hold all of mah calls and reschedule my other appointments. I dunno how long this is gonna take.‚Äù
‚ÄúGet rid of ya? Like...‚Äù Donna trailed off.
‚ÄúYep. That's it. When you start a new day of work, either here or any other occupational designation, you'll need to find a clock like this to sign in for the day. Then, when you're done, let it scan your arm again in order to clock out. Got it?‚Äù
‚ÄúBut, I mean...
‚ÄúI see Goldie Locks has been eating my porridge.‚Äù The stranger stated, slowly moving closer to Dean, a wolfish smirk plastered to his face.
Dean bucked up into the touch, seeking more of that delicious friction on his leaking cock. Their hands roamed as they moaned into each other's mouth. Cas's hand found Dean's throbbing erection, and he gave it a few strokes, causing a whimper to escape Dean's mouth. Around that time a delicious scent met Cas's nostrils.
‚ÄúHm?‚Äù Cas said, not sure where the change in topic came from.
What the hell just happened?
‚ÄúHeya, Jody,‚Äù Benny greeted the other Beta once he was back inside the private conference room.
‚ÄúWell, Dean...‚Äù Charlie began, tentatively, as if she didn't want to say anything at all, ‚ÄúI hate how this is going to sound, but I've gotta say it.‚Äù Dean and Cas both looked up at her expectantly. ‚ÄúThe thing is... you
‚ÄúI could go fetch 'em if you'd like,‚Äù the medic offered.
‚ÄúBenny-‚Äù Jody tried to placate him.
‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Jody confirmed. ‚ÄúYou
Sighing, Dean answered, ‚ÄúYeah, well. He did. And no, I didn't like it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Jody interrupted, clapping her hands in front of her. ‚ÄúPickle juice. Panel. Obviously a secondary entrance. Got it. Benny,‚Äù she turned to her colleague, ‚Äúwe've
‚ÄúPretty sure. It's warm,‚Äù Cas assured. But when Dean still looked unconvinced, he decided to take the risk and plunge the rest of the way in. Before he could think better of it, he placed his whole body in the path of the flow. In turn, the water immediately expanded to accommodate his girth, completely engulfing his body.
Charlie had chosen to seat them in the dining hall that was conveniently called Dining Hall A. It was spacious, though there weren't many people around. Charlie explained that most people ate dinner as soon as possible, and she'd purposefully chosen a time to come that was a bit later than usual so they wouldn't be overwhelmed by so many bodies and scents and noises. It would take a few days for their bodies to acclimate so they could comfortably endure being around so many people at once.
‚ÄúHonestly? No. No, I'm not, Cas!‚Äù
had in any of these facilities ‚Äì ever! ‚Äì but you, Dean, were put in a horrid situation and it should never have happened!‚Äù Benny admitted vehemently, a dead serious look on his face. Jody nodded in agreement next to him.
‚ÄúI know, it's just-‚Äù he paused, once again looking for the right words to describe his thoughts. ‚ÄúI dunno, I just wanted to have a contingency. In case things went sideways, that's all.‚Äù
, in the case of multiples.‚Äù Charlie turned off her pointer and turned back to Dean, who had stopped his pacing in order to view the short presentation. She beamed at the Omega, clearly pleased with herself. ‚ÄúDid that clear things up a bit?‚Äù
Benny and Jody exchanged looks before turning back to address their audience.
~*~*~*~
Cas nodded vigorously. ‚ÄúYes. Spoon. Is... is that okay?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat means you would have had to share Castiel with other Omegas,‚Äù Charlie supplied, seeming to catch on to what Dean was having trouble articulating. ‚ÄúMaybe even five or six others.‚Äù
, but some is better than none.‚Äù
Dean nodded. He did remember. He mourned the loss of a brother that he didn't even know. At least not anymore.
‚ÄúDude, look, I don't wanna sit still okay. I gotta
‚ÄúYou assume correctly. And I believe you've already had the
‚ÄúNo, Dean. We
‚ÄúWait, is it the pup that's got you upset?‚Äù Castiel asked, noticing Dean's unconscious gesture.
Cas thought for a moment, then answered, ‚ÄúI
‚ÄúCan and will,‚Äù she shot back. ‚ÄúNow I want you to go down to the storage unit and get one of those big jars of pickles and bring 'em back up here for Joel to cut up.
‚ÄúHm? What was that?‚Äù Benny asked.
Frowning, Benny took a few steps forward and looked in the doorway. He could see Jody talking with Dean and Castiel in their living room. They each stood to the right of the crime scene where the couch blocked their view of the red, stained sheet that covered the bloody lumps formerly known as Alistair.
‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù Alistair said with a chuckle, removing his hand from Dean's tender flesh. ‚ÄúWell, it was fun while it lasted, eh sweet thing?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you feeling better, Dean?‚Äù Cas asked after a few more minutes. Everyone had calmed down, spirits seeming higher and there was chatting and teasing all around them.
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Dean leaned forward to get a better look out the windshield. ‚ÄúWhat's happening to the road?‚ÄùAbout a hundred feet ahead of them, the tunnel they'd been driving through began to narrow into a wedge where the ceiling met the floor. That didn't seem right.
‚ÄúYeah, you'll be going to that by yourself, buddy,‚Äù Dean declared vehemently. Cas simply rolled his eyes at his mate's refusal to expand his mind.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she squinted her eyes at the two of them for a moment before saying, ‚ÄúYou're the newbies, right? You're Charles.... or Clarence...?‚Äù
! Like- just absorbed into the wall!" Castiel's eyes go wide for a moment as he remembers.
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Cas said after thinking about it, ‚ÄúCharlie did tell us that memory erasure is pretty delicate. Being exposed to people from our past can trigger memories. That's why she said you couldn't see your brother, remember?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe all have an equal right to be here, Ruby. He was mated to all of us,‚Äù Bela defended Meg.
Dean huffed and shook his head. ‚ÄúAnd if I refuse?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot for us,‚Äù one of the Omegas said.
‚ÄúWhat's with that freakin' voice tellin' us to 'mate'?!‚Äù
After a few minutes of silence, a thought crossed Castiel's mind. ‚ÄúSo, Alfie, why didn't you make any requests for the room to give you any of the things you need? Shower, food, water, or anything else?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yeah, then what was it?‚Äù Cas challenged, a glint in his eyes.
Meg chuckled darkly, ‚ÄúI'll take that as a 'yes'.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere's that
‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Gabriel said, ‚Äúwe still need to get the dishes done before we finish our packing. It might take more than 30 minutes.‚Äù
‚ÄúSeven months,‚Äù Castiel said to himself. ‚ÄúOnly seven months.‚Äù
‚ÄúI really like her,‚Äù Castiel confessed after he heard the main door closing.
‚ÄúHi, Dean,‚Äù Sam and Eileen greet.
All Dean says is, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs get out of the car.‚Äù
Dean shook his head. His lips trembled, and Castiel knew that he was about to cry, but Dean wanted to fight against that urge. ‚ÄúBut she can kill you now so Lucifer becomes the next heir and she can marry Lucifer.‚Äù
The next morning, they call Rowena to ask for their help, but she refuses to help them.
Yesterday they arrived home from a hunt; nevertheless, Dean is already looking for a new case. They should get some rest, they both need it, but Dean feels better when his head is focused on a case. His thoughts aren‚Äôt so poisonous and harmful when he has to focus on finding and killing a monster.
Dean simply smiles and meets Castiel‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúNothing. Just that I love you.‚Äù
Axe in hand, Dean goes to the closest tree, ready to build a pyre he never thought he would have to build.
‚ÄúFor now, I think so,‚Äù Dean answered. ‚ÄúThanks for the help, Ash.‚Äù
‚ÄúShut up or you won‚Äôt get any pie.‚Äù He warns.
Dean drinks a long sip of his beer to work up his courage and he looks at Cas. ‚ÄúDo you‚Äî do you wanna dance?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo. I want a calm night at home.‚Äù It won‚Äôt be calm, because Dean is everything except calm, and damn it, Castiel really loves that about Dean. He is looking forward for tonight. He is always looking forward to spend the night with Dean.
by The Doors plays in his car, just where it stopped when he parked the Impala in front of the bookstore. Dean finds himself drumming his fingers on the wheel along the beat of the song and he is soon singing the lyrics with Jim Morrison. It helps him to fade away that shitty lonely feeling.
When they pull away, Cas slides his body down carefully and takes Dean‚Äôs cock in his mouth. He only sucks him for a small time, just a couple of bobs of his head, but it leaves Dean breathless. Then Cas moves to the inner of Dean‚Äôs thighs and leaves a few kisses there.
Cas doesn‚Äôt behave like this around Sam. He gives Sam his personal space. He doesn‚Äôt share a bed with Sam when the three of them are hunting and there are only two beds. He barely touches Sam, and when he does, his touch doesn‚Äôt linger. He barely teases Sam. He doesn‚Äôt lock his eyes with Sam and stare at him as if he wanted to see his soul. He smiles differently at Sam.
Dean shrugs. ‚ÄúYeah, but it kind of was your look.‚Äù He looks at Cas‚Äô clothes; he is wearing a grey sweater and some faded jeans that are about to get torn on his knees.
Dean got for Sam the whole collection of the books from
That‚Äôs the last thought Dean has as himself before the Mark takes over him and everything becomes blurry until Metatron stabs him in the chest.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a fever,‚Äù Dean mumbles, bewildered. He sees Cas‚Äô eyelids falling shut, and Dean cups his face. ‚ÄúHey, Cas. Hey, hey. Don‚Äôt fall asleep. Tell me what else you feel, please.‚Äù
The phone keeps ringing for a while until it stops. Then, Sam switches it off. ‚ÄúI really hope he doesn‚Äôt show up.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are never going to forget that, are you?‚Äù
‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù
The pain in Dean‚Äôs chest comes back and Dean suppresses a sob.
‚ÄúBurritos.‚Äù
Meg doesn‚Äôt offer any further explanations about it and just tells them to drive to the hospital, so that‚Äôs what they do.
‚ÄúI have wanted to do this for a long time,‚Äù Castiel confesses. ‚ÄúEven more so since we started sleeping in this bed.‚Äù
‚ÄúI completely agree.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo good, Dean, so good.‚Äù Castiel says. One of these days, Dean is going to come by only hearing that sexy voice. ‚ÄúYou can stop now. I‚Äôm going to fuck you.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you want some privacy with your boyfriend, you just gotta tell me,‚Äù Benny says as he gets up. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt need to be subtle, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood morning, Cas,‚Äù Dean murmured when they stopped kissing.
Cas smiles in appreciation. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Then he takes a long deep breath and looks around. ‚ÄúI missed being at home.‚Äù
Dean can‚Äôt believe he gets to have this now.
Dean turns his face slightly, taking a look at his back. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Dean says. He starts to stand up, but he groans, in pain. ‚ÄúFuck, it hurts.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I join?!‚Äù Dean yells happily, bringing Sam‚Äôs and Jess‚Äô attention to the window.
They come up with a plan to kill Amara by using a bomb made of souls. But in order to use that bomb, somebody has to carry it inside themselves, and Dean is the only one who can get close to Amara.
, Dean‚Äôs mind insits.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still mad at you,‚Äù Dean mutters, watching how the condom gets inside the bin.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that for sure,‚Äù Sam replicates.
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Dean inhales sharply. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt thinking properly, I thought pain would make it go away easier. That it was what I deserved.‚Äù He looks down and then, he closes his eyes. Castiel kisses his forehead and Dean can‚Äôt help making a shy smile at that. He should have looked for Cas‚Äô comfort. It feels better than the pain. ‚ÄúDo you forgive me?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù she asks.
It wasn‚Äôt until Cas saved him from Zachariah, after coming back from the year 2014, that Dean finally realized that he was falling in love with Cas. He had started feeling something the night before they faced Raphael. He had laughed so hard with Cas, he had enjoyed his company so much, and he could feel something big and scary building in his heart, but he tried to ignore it. But a couple of days after that, when he and Cas were on that road, Dean finally realized he couldn‚Äôt ignore that he was falling in love with Cas.
Castiel blushes a little and he even makes a tiny smile, although is a bit sad and tired, but it is a beginning. ‚ÄúDo you think you will be capable?‚Äù
There‚Äôs a small silence in between them and their attention is back to their sandwiches. Soon they fall into a conversation, asking about each other‚Äôs days. Dean wonders how this easiness in between them happened without any notice. Does it even matter? He adores it; that‚Äôs what matters.
‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Cas asks, really worried.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd kick you if you weren‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù
‚ÄúGive me a fork and I will tell you my verdict.‚Äù
‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù Gabriel said, giving him a sassy look. His brother had aged, but his sassy expressions remained the same. ‚ÄúAsk me. I can see you‚Äôre dying to do it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you want some raspberries?‚Äù Castiel asks with a curious look.
Dean exhales sharply and he squeezes Cas‚Äô hand in a lovely way. ‚ÄúI really like it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd once we are there, what are we gonna do? We can‚Äôt do the same spell we just did. We don‚Äôt have more ingredients.‚Äù
Zachariah nodded and bowed his head. ‚ÄúAs you wish, Your Majesty.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat happened the year after your father forced you to leave.‚Äù
Dean smiles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually pretty good.‚Äù He caresses Castiel‚Äôs jaw, feeling his stubble on his knuckles. ‚ÄúBetter than you think.‚Äù His fingers brush Castiel‚Äôs lips and the ex-angel kisses them. He grabs Dean‚Äôs hand and kisses his palm, and Dean can‚Äôt help blushing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also really good at making me blush.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will.‚Äù He looks down as he shuffles his feet for a brief moment before he lifts his eyes and looks at Dean. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the name of that song you were singing?‚Äù
Dean comes and he presses himself on Cas, who comes almost a few seconds after him. Dean holds him tightly, as if he thought that Cas could break into million pieces after this. Dean can even feel Cas‚Äô heart beating. What was all of this about? Why did they make love? Why did no one pull away? Why did no one of them could stop looking at each other‚Äôs eyes? There are too many questions in Dean‚Äôs mind. He would like to know the answers, but frankly, right now, Cas is in his arms, with his forehead pressed on Dean‚Äôs, inside of Dean, and it feels great. Dean doesn‚Äôt want to let this moment go. It feels like a dream, but it isn‚Äôt a dream.
_____
‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt looking for something healthy right now,‚Äù Dean confesses. He takes a sip of his drink and sits in front of Rowena. ‚ÄúThanks for saving him.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than decent, Cas. It‚Äôs almost perfect.‚Äù Both he and Sam know how to heal each other, but they always end up doing a bit of a mess. Cas, however, does a perfect job.
‚ÄúYes, I love it.‚Äù He laughs and Dean does it too.
Dean tests the waters, wanting to know if Cas remembers of feels anything about his past life, but all he gets is Cas saying that he doesn‚Äôt feel like a bad guy.
‚ÄúCan I little spoon you?‚Äù He hates not having Cas in his arms. Maybe Cas needs space, but Dean knows Cas; whenever he puts distance in between them, he needs to have Dean closer than ever.
As Dean changes into his nightwear, Castiel gets in the bed and he lets out a pleased sigh that could almost be considered a moan. Dean turns around, hoping that his cheeks don‚Äôt get redder than they already are, and finds Cas lying in bed, with a soft smile on his lips.
Dean laughs and reaches Cas‚Äô lips to kiss him sweetly. Cas knows him so well; he always knows when Dean needs humor to ease things up. It‚Äôs surprising how well Cas knows Dean. ‚ÄúI love you so fucking much.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I have to do a lot of paperwork and cancel contracts and I need to find another job and a lot of stuff.‚Äù
‚ÄúShit, I haven‚Äôt asked you, are you alright? Are you healed?‚Äù Dean asks, taking a good look at Cas, making sure that he is in fact alright.
Once he has everything, Castiel walks towards the door. ‚ÄúGoodnight, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù He makes a ball with a napkin and throws it at his little brother‚Äôs head, which only makes the taller Winchester laugh. ‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course I did,‚Äù Castiel says as he closes the briefcase. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to do the same with the watercolors.‚Äù
As Dean told him, on Thursday, he gets a call telling him that his car is ready, so once Castiel finishes his day at university, he will go and pick up his car. Thanks to his car insurance, he won‚Äôt have to pay a cent.
Castiel makes a thoughtful face. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt Wednesdays when the farmer‚Äôs marker comes to Lebanon?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, I know.‚Äù He looks down at his hands and then at the screen. He doesn‚Äôt miss Castiel‚Äôs intrigued face looking at him. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt,‚Äù he suggests with a funny face.
Dean nods, not looking at Cas.
But Cas looks at him with decision. ‚ÄúDean, you've already taken the Mark. You can't take it again. I can. It's the only way.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet me go, Dean,‚Äù he muttered, feeling how his blush was making its way into his cheeks.
Sam chuckles as he presses play. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you enjoy a movie that doesn‚Äôt have sex scenes, cowboys, Clint Eastwood nor Harrison Ford in it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Cas says.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mean, I‚Äôm just a sensible guy who knows that his glutton husband would eat the whole filling in just one sitting.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust practice.‚Äù He shrugs casually. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything special.‚Äù
Dean nods and walks away. The sound of Castiel‚Äôs door being closed sounds behind him and Dean doesn‚Äôt look back. He never looks back. Just in case; he doesn‚Äôt want to do something stupid. Because that‚Äôs what he is, a stupid guy who has fallen for Castiel.
‚ÄúNo. I want to be here. I‚Äôll get some sleep later.‚Äù
Dean looks at Cas.
Dean drives to Castiel‚Äôs and he parks the Impala in front of the building. When he waits for the elevator, Dean puts his mobile on silent; it‚Äôs really annoying for work sometimes, although Dean‚Äôs phone barely rings.
While Eileen walks to Sam‚Äôs room, both Winchester brothers start to prepare all the ingredients needed for the spell that will get them to Hell. By the time Eileen comes back, Dean is already cutting his palm to add his blood to the other ingredients.
Sam looks at him, prouder than ever.
‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù Cas answers.
They keep kissing for a long time, only separating their lips when one of them needs to breathe. When that happens, their eyes meet and they smile at each other, and then, they go back to kissing and caressing each other, not wanting to take things further, just content to be like this, kissing and holding.
Castiel grins, beautifully, and Dean‚Äôs heart skips a beat. ‚ÄúI love you, too, Dean.‚Äù He leans and kisses him.
‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôve got sense of humor.‚Äù
Dean glares her while Castiel chuckles.
‚ÄúThanks for that.‚Äù Dean says pretending to be annoyed.
His mouth and tongue are warm and wet, and Dean loves it. Castiel does every little thing he knows that Dean loves. They know each other‚Äôs bodies so well and they know what each other enjoys and they put it on practice.
‚ÄúWhy do you still worry about us? We‚Äôve been through a lot, and we still choose each other and we are still together.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you want for breakfast?‚Äù Dean asks, letting his eyes linger on the exposed skin for a few seconds before he looks at Cas‚Äô face. ‚ÄúBesides, coffee.‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs grin only gets wider after hearing that word. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs shower and have breakfast.‚Äù
Dean wants to cry. But he feels so dead inside that he doesn‚Äôt feel that he can cry nor scream. Cas is dead, and Dean thinks he has died too. He feels dead inside.
After a while, Dean pulls away, but Castiel‚Äôs hands remain on his shoulders, not wanting to let him go yet. Just like Dean, whose hands are resting on Cas‚Äô hips.
Sam frowns confused. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
‚ÄúThings fucked up,‚Äù Dean finally says.
Castiel smiles. ‚ÄúYou never need it, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù Castiel asks as he starts to dress his salad.
‚ÄúI hope you get some sleep, Cas,‚Äù Dean says.
The rain kept falling onto him and his vision began to black out.
Castiel makes a shy smile. ‚ÄúYou will have to wait until we get there.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Adam says, turning around to face Dean.
‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôre dealing with a djinn,‚Äù Dean supplies. ‚ÄúAnd the normal kind, not the kind who likes to turn your insides into jelly and feed on nightmares.‚Äù Carefully, he pokes a gloved finger on the victim‚Äôs stomach, making sure that the body feels normal. Satisfied, he pulls his finger away and looks at Cas, who has a pensive face. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
This is the sex Dean likes, when he and Cas are pressed together and Dean‚Äôs hands are free to touch everywhere. Cas is sitting on the bed and Dean is sitting in his lap, his knees rested on the mattress, riding that cock in steady thrusts. Castiel‚Äôs hands are cupping his butt cheeks, nails digging a little into tender skin as Dean keeps rocking his hips in the way that drives the blue eyed man crazy.
Castiel rolls both of them, being Dean the one pinned in between Cas and the mattress. He pulls away from Cas‚Äô swollen and wet lips and he arches his eyebrow, earning him a challenging look from the ex-angel. Dean grabs Castiel‚Äôs wrists and he rolls the two of them, pressing Cas‚Äô back against the mattress.
‚ÄúWhat about your failing grace?‚Äù Dean asks concerned.
Castiel laughs. ‚ÄúAssbutt.‚Äù He leans to kiss Dean sweetly, cupping his face.
‚ÄúBecause those don‚Äôt have this amount of grease.‚Äù He points at the hamburger and looks at him with an obvious face, but his eyes are full of concern.
Days pass and Dean and Sam keep hunting as well as they try to find a lead on Kelly, but Cas still doesn‚Äôt answer. Even Sam is worried when Dean tells him that Cas isn‚Äôt answering at all.
Before Dean can say anything else, Cas is already leaving. He doesn‚Äôt look at Dean at all on his way out.
He leaves the book on the bedside table, marking the page he was reading and he opens the door of his bedroom, revealing Cas, who is shaking.
‚ÄúPretty much, yeah,‚Äù Dean says, voice cracking. He looks at the place where Sam is, and he quickly turns his head away, not wanting to see any more of it. ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I bother you if I stay here?‚Äù future Castiel asks as he looks at present Castiel. He settles on Dean‚Äôs left side, kneeling on the mattress so he can be able to suck Dean off.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got too much faith on me, Cas.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe lyrics are restless, like you, and there are references to
‚ÄúTurn the sign.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tradition we have,‚Äù Sam begins to explain. ‚ÄúDean makes three different types of cards, in this case, given that you have joined us tonight, there are going to be four stars and two hearts; one painted and one that isn‚Äôt painted. He is gonna leave them on the middle of the table, face down, amd after shuffling them, we‚Äôve gotta pick a card. The one who gets the painted heart gets the dishes and puts them in the dishwasher. The one who gets the unpainted heart has to clean the rest. The stars just have to remain seated and enjoy.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it is nice.‚Äù The stare he makes is all charming and heartwarming and it kind of makes Castiel‚Äôs heart to melt. ‚ÄúFor now on, whenever you are depressed, all I have to do is explode a burrito on my face,‚Äù he jokes as he approaches the TV table.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll try. But he is a giant, I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôll resist if he does something.‚Äù Kevin says with a grin.
‚ÄúYeah, I am. But I‚Äôm your assbutt.‚Äù They keep kissing passionately and dirtily, making both of them moan. ‚ÄúShower together and breakfast?‚Äù
Dean made a cocky and proud face. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre gonna love that.‚Äù
‚ÄúClaire is on her way to the bunker,‚Äù Castiel explains before Dean can ask. ‚ÄúAs soon as Sam and Eileen give her all the materials for the spell and she gets a few hours of sleep, she will head here to Spokane.‚Äù
The moment they have ordered and the waitress is gone, Cas takes off his jacket, revealing the tanned skin of his arms and the strong muscles of them. He looks so damn good with that.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Dean asked with a curious frown, leaning into Castiel‚Äôs touch. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your ‚ÄòI‚Äôm about to say something sappy‚Äô face.‚Äù
‚ÄúCas, I have to drive to Phillipsburg and it is almost an hour long drive. The sooner I go, the sooner I will come back,‚Äù he explains as he puts the last toast on a plate. He kisses Cas‚Äô temple, trying to make his frown disappear. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go back to bed after breakfast?‚Äù
Dean looks at his brother, who is waiting for an answer. Dean sighs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù But both of them know that sentence means ‚Äòno‚Äô.
They don‚Äôt talk about Castiel anymore. Their conversation changes the topic suddenly, because the three of them know that there‚Äôs nothing more to say about Dean and Castiel, something that Dean really appreciates. They talk about their jobs and about some TV shows and anything that comes to their minds. Anything that helps to make Dean forget about Cas for a while.
Dean turns his face and he makes a soft smile. ‚ÄúGood morning Cas.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes. I saw him in a few photos in that house. They might have Sam in that abandoned house.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe plan changed, Dean. Something went wrong. You know this. Something always goes wrong.‚Äù
Dean lets out part of the pain inside him. He knows he will never be able to let it all out. The pain will always be there. It will always be endless. It won‚Äôt matter how much Dean cries and wails; the pain will go on forever. He is going to be grieving for the rest of his life.
‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs gonna be okay, I promise.‚Äù He cups his face and presses a lingering kiss on Castiel‚Äôs forehead, making the angel sigh.
Castiel makes a beautiful smile before he kisses Dean tenderly. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He places his arms around Dean‚Äôs neck, pressing himself a little closer and keeps fucking into his cock with those tender but delirious movements.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Castiel says with a sweet voice. ‚ÄúBut I hate seeing you suffering.‚Äù
Cas saw love in Dean. He believed that what drove Dean was love and not anger. He didn‚Äôt think Dean was broken or destructive. He thought the opposite. He saw light in Dean‚Äôs darkness. He found beauty among the broken pieces of Dean. He found love in between Dean‚Äôs rage.
Dean and Sam are in the war room, trying to come up with an idea on how to find Kelly, when the door opens and Cas appears. He remains on the rail, looking at the two of them from above.
Thank you so much for reading, for the kudos, the bookmarks, the comments and the subscriptions.
‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù Dean says.
‚ÄúStill‚Äî‚Äù Castiel took a deep breath and looked down, feeling really tired. He was feeling really cold from the rain. ‚ÄúI should have been more cautious. Dean wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation if I had‚Äî‚Äù
Even though Castiel chuckles, his blue eyes are glaring Dean a little. ‚ÄúYou were at that time quite insufferable. You were extremely cocky and disrespectful.‚Äù
Dean chuckles. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù
At least that‚Äôs something good, but Cas is still going to leave. ‚ÄúThen I expect you to come here as much as possible,‚Äù he says with a charming smirk. He has to pretend that knowing that in a week Cas will be gone doesn‚Äôt affect him.
Castiel is sleeping soundly next to Dean, who has his arm around his back, keeping him close to him. His fingers move on his shoulders, caressing him softly, hoping he won‚Äôt wake up. His breathing is even and soft, and its sound calms Dean. His hand is on Dean‚Äôs chest, his fingers brushing the place where Dean‚Äôs heart is, almost as if he was protecting it.
‚ÄúYou know damn well that you are,‚Äù Castiel answered with a sassy voice, making Dean chuckle. Castiel stretched his leg and he began to softly kick Dean‚Äôs foot with his.
‚ÄúYou were right. Jack is struggling. And I've tried, but‚Äî‚Äù
They wait for the rest of their waffles and then they start having breakfast on the table. They sit next to each other and add the extras on their waffles. Dean pours a small amount of syrup on his while Castiel sprays some whipped cream on top of his. His index ends up with some whipped cream and he takes longer than he should on licking it. Dean tries to focus on his waffles but he is easily distracted.
‚ÄúWhat has he told you?‚Äù he asks a bit alarmed.
Charlie grins and she punches Dean‚Äôs bicep. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my Dean!‚Äù The three of them chuckle. ‚ÄúI got you this, to celebrate your recovery,‚Äù she says as she hands him an apple pie.
‚ÄúCas,‚Äù Dean begins to say, clearing his throat. He feels how his skin is about to set on fire with their proximity. ‚ÄúPersonal space?‚Äù
‚ÄúMy sun and star looks wonderful blushed,‚Äù he teases a bit more. He loves seeing Dean blushed.
Dean just stares at him.
‚ÄúWhat? Are you serious?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt force yourself like this,‚Äù he says worried but there‚Äôs a hint or warning in his voice.
Sam then begins to explain to Cas everything that happened with Jack. Dean barely listens to those explanations. He is shocked by the fact that Jack brought back Cas. After everything Dean had said to him, Jack brought back Cas to life.
house and around that, was everyone in their heaven. To separate heavens but also keep everyone together, there were walls about 7 feet tall between them but they were also only a few feet long so that if people wanted to, they could make friends and go to other people's heavens.
Cas said, "yeah she really is. It's too bad her kids are too stubborn to come visit her. None of them will fly here. They all always tell her they're busy with work."
Mia said, "cool. Is that next?"
Mia walked over to her desk and said, "hey, I just wanted to say thanks for letting me read a little bit."
Mia smiled and attempted to say okay but her mouth was already stuffed so it didn't work too well; everything tasted better here than on Earth.
Sam said, "yeah that's pretty accurate. Um, he always jumped in between us when Dad did happen to get a chance to get to me but he usually didn't have to. Dad didn't hit me very often, mainly Dean, and Dean would never let me jump in, though I tried. Most of the time Dad and I would yell, and fight that way, and then Dean would start being a smartass and talk back because he knew our conversation was headed towards me getting hit and he just refused to let it happen, especially because he eventually believed he deserved to always get beat on."
Sam said yeah as he glanced at his phone and realized they were late and that he was probably going to be late for his next meeting.
She wrapped her arms around him and sorta snuggled into his chest then said, "you're welcome. I love you too, Dad."
Jack said, "this is the globe room - we're not very good at naming things, kinda like my dad - and this is how we check on all the humans and other angels down there at once. All angels have an assigned section and/or person, depending on their level of training and specialty. They all have to come in here periodically to check on their section or person and if they need help, they'll press the dot that lights up then it will let me know who went where as well as take them to whoever's in trouble," he points to the corner where 2 angels are and continues, "That's Naomi and Uriel. They reigned before, when Chuck was gone, but are in training again so they can relearn how to act and our values. Right now it looks like they're taking notes for their service class."
After explaining this all to Mia, Cas said, "I knew when I found him in that barn that he was changed and still hadn't healed from the physical and emotional scars he'd gotten there. I could feel his pain. Not just his pain from Hell but also from everything he'd ever been through. But I could also feel all the love he had and that he hid it. Not very well, but most people don't. I knew there was more to him than they'd ever told me about him."
Ben nodded as the bell rang and the teacher started taking attendance.
Dean said, "alright. Sammy, you get the gear, I'll call Jody to see if she can take the kids, and Mia and Eileen you guys get the food and beer."
At the bunker, they unpacked everything then Mia and Dean were about to leave to get the kids when Cas walked in from work.
"It sounds pretty open and shut doesn't it?"
At this point, they were all standing behind the counter as a customer walked in so Dean waved Ben to the back where they worked on the cars and Carlos took care of the customer. Dean showed Ben around the garage and started to work on a car they got the day before when Carlos came out and said the customer wanted a car wash and general check up and that they were bringing the car around.
When they got home, Ben said, "thanks for coming today, Aunt Mia. I wasn't sure if I was going to like having you around that much but I did."
She said, "it's in California. At a school, Stanford."
He said, "Oh. They got in a car crash like my mom?"
After they both said goodnight to everyone, they went to their rooms and got ready for bed.
Mia waved back then Cas said, "so Mia, first I've got to make rounds then, unless I'm needed somewhere, we'll have a little bit of a break to eat and talk for a bit."
Quote of the Week: The things that can hurt you the most are those that you love more than anything.
After they were set up, Sam surprised Mia by telling her to go shower then get dressed up to go to dinner because he wanted to show her his and Jess's favorite place to go.
He said, "o-oh."
"Sometimes. But I know he's happy and loves you and Charlie and you love him so it's okay."
Dean held the leash and as the path narrowed, Dean and Cas had to move closer together and ended up holding hands, even after it widened again. Yeah, they were already married but Dean still had a hard time showing affection so Cas relished every moment it lasted and made sure to never point out when he didn't pull away because it then caused him to.
Mia stifled a laugh when she heard their names and when Jack was done, she said, "isn't Naomi the one who made your dad kill thousands of fake versions of your other dad to brainwash him or something?"
Dean looked hesitant so Mia said, "Dean let him go. It might be his only chance to go on a hunt and he can stay with me or Sam the whole time. We know that school like the back of our hands. Plus, I was part of AKA for a short time so I know that'll help."
Dean growled in frustration and tried to speak anyway. ‚ÄúI... r-remember!‚Äù the Omega gritted out slowly as he fought his Alpha's Voice.
‚ÄúOnce you were no longer in danger of bleeding out, we hauled ass back to Gabriel's bunker so that you and some others could be tended to. There's a medical bay with lots of equipment, much more than the medics carry in their kits. Since you're pregnant, you took priority over the others.‚Äù
should be the one in control. So he quickly leaned down and nipped at Dean's collarbone in gentle reprimand, growling lowly as he did. He wasn't sure why he did that, it just came to him, but it had the desired effect. Mostly.
My father is the one I scammed- I mean PERSUADED ‚Äì to draw them for me, but I don't know how long it's going to take. However, as soon as he gets it done, I'll post them on the appropriate chapter.
Dean scoffed, then sank back down onto the bed, placed his elbows on his knees and clutched his down-turned head as he said sardonically, ‚Äú'Congratulations'. Yeah, great. Thanks a million, doc.‚Äù A few tears slid down his face and he angrily swiped them away.
to talk to Jody!
Instinctually, Dean moved away. Something about the guy didn't sit well with him. ‚ÄúUh, yeah.‚Äù Dean glanced over to the array of delicacies before returning his gaze to the man who was continually advancing on him. ‚ÄúSorry, man. I was just hungry, y'know? And, uh, thirsty.‚Äù Dean gestured to the fountain, still not taking his eyes off the stranger. He didn't realize the guy would be so intimidating. He woulda left the stuff alone if he had known.
Amy fired right as a dart embedded itself into her shoulder, the force of it causing her shot to go wide. It missed Jody... but hit Dean instead.
Dean scoffed at the compliment but did seem to calm a little. He took another look at himself in the mirror, then heaved a sigh as he accepted his predicament. Well, sort of. He'd still grumble about it every chance he got, but for now, he would let it slide. ‚ÄúAlright fine. Whatever. What's next? Food?‚Äù He looked back and forth between the Beta and the Alpha expectantly, as if one of them would magically make his food materialize. ‚ÄúFood, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúW-well, with the other Alphas, they only moved on to Phase Three...
It was long and rectangular, and Dean, once again, could not identify a source of light, though the room was very well lit. The door they'd just gone through was made of a clear glass that could be seen through, however, the back wall was made of an opaque material that was completely blacked out, hiding whatever could be on the other side. And the shorter walls on either side of the rectangular room were made of cement.
Dean notices the Angel isn't even breathing heavily. The bastard isn't winded at all, when it's all Dean can do to keep it together. Which he's failing miserably at. He wants to bitch about it, but all he can do is whimper and take what the Angel is giving him. He bites his bottom lip, which has become swollen from him worrying at it, and he closes his eyes again. He just tries to endure it all. Cas will let him come eventually. He can't keep them like this forever, can he? Can he?! He suddenly starts to panic, just a little. He opens his eyes, and meets Cas's vibrant blues, seemingly staring right into his soul, which he probably is.
Dean softened up, but only a little. He didn't
to go into the schpiel, is there anything, in particular, you'd like to know?‚Äù
an emergency.
‚ÄúWell, can I... hold you? Like turn around and... you know... nestle back into me?‚Äù
‚ÄúUh, no. No. I don't think so.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Dean asked, ‚Äúyou don't mind me saying that about him?‚Äù
Benny knew she was lying, but he couldn't call her out on it just yet. He put on his best poker face, doing his best not to let his seething hatred show. He nodded tersely and said, ‚ÄúFine. Just go get your bag and meet us at the bus.‚Äù
What could
Dean looked down at himself, at his chest and stomach which had both become sticky from his own drying cum and he could still feel the cooling stream of Cas's release on his leg. He grimaced at the uncomfortable feelings and then nodded before stepping forward and around Cas, who vacated the pool to make room for Dean.
‚ÄúDid... something happen while we were apart?‚Äù Cas pulled back from his task of further marking up Dean's neck to look the other man in the face, his brow knitting in concern. He knows Alfie told him that Dean was well and safe during their time apart, but that doesn't mean that nothing could have happened to him.
‚ÄúYep, check it out.‚Äù As they passed their little kitchenette on the way to the door, Dean plucked the empty bowl up from the counter, showcasing it proudly for his overbearing mate to see.
It was all quite a depressing sight, to say the least.
‚ÄúYes. We all do. Everyone here had to go through similar processes.‚Äù Charlie answered. ‚ÄúWell, except for the Betas like me. We had to have our memories erased, just like you guys, Dean's brother and his mates - literally every other Omega and Alpha - but us Betas didn't have to go through the Conversion process.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay... well,‚Äù she turned back to the monitor and pointed to each of the shapes in turn as she explained. ‚Äúthese two only have one dot in them because they each contain only one pup. But this one,‚Äù she pointed to the largest of the shapes, which was actually more of an oval, ‚Äúthis one has
Someone was in it.
‚ÄúWait...‚Äù Dean squinted at the window, brow furrowing slightly, before continuing. ‚ÄúIt was raining just a second ago. We saw that through the windows in the lobby. What happened?‚Äù
Jody was struck silent, her face a mosaic of shock and hurt, but Benny had a few things to say, ‚ÄúWhat the hell do ya mean, 'suicide'! We just saw 'im. He was fine!‚Äù
Seriously, what
dangerous. So Cas decided to try going further in. He took a tentative step into the flowing water, causing it to turn the vibrant orange once more. Once both feet were planted firmly in the water and it was lapping at his ankles, he reached out and ran a hand through the upwards flowing spout. It had been completely silent before, but now, with the disturbance of his hand, there was a gentle splashing sound accompanying his moving limb.
Cas's hands shifted and found their way to his mate's hips and Dean wrapped his arms around the Alpha's neck, one hand carding through the other man's raven hair. He nearly melted at the warm breath that ghosted over the exposed flesh of his neck and shoulders. He was almost grateful for the ridiculous Omega uniform at that moment.
its way out of his body, and he nearly screams from the sudden intensity of it. ‚ÄúOh fucking son of a bitch!‚Äù The car swerves dangerously, and it's just lucky that the back road is empty at this time of day. Dean gets Baby back under control and quickly pulls over, gasping for breath once he does.
‚ÄúHe, uh...‚Äù Cas began, stammering over his excuse. ‚ÄúWe invited him over, to talk. He seemed interested in getting to know us when we first moved in. But then he... he attacked my mate. So I defended him and he... well-‚Äù Cas finished his explanation there, gesturing in the direction of the bloody mess that used to be Al.
Dean could feel his orgasm hovering just out of reach, but it just wouldn't happen.
better. Thanks.‚Äù Dean ran a hand through his newly-cleaned hair nervously. Unsure of what to do. ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, sorry about that brothah. But you're gonna have to put up with that for now.‚Äù
seem to be getting warmer, as another bead of sweat began trickling down his face. He swiped it away angrily.
Once Cas was finally satisfied, he grabbed his aching cock and lined it up with Dean's prepped and flowing hole before slowly pressing in with one long, slow stroke. Dean groaned loudly as he was filled up so beautifully with his mate's monster cock. Cas didn't stop until he was fully seated inside and he finally let out a low groan of his own.
Castiel breathed in a loud gasp as he woke, his eyes flaring wide and feral as he looked at Dean with a ravenous hunger. ‚ÄúDean...‚Äù he growled out.
Dean shifted his weight from one foot to the other as his discomfort began to grow. They did know he was
Council agreed,‚Äù Gordon interjected. ‚ÄúWith two new Omegas, I'd like to think this could be considered a whole new Council. Well,‚Äù he shrugged, ‚Äúa new
Sometime later, when both of them were clean, dry and pleasantly drowsy, they stepped back out of the flow. It shrank back to its normal size and faded back to its base color of crystal clear as the two stepped away from it. They paused when they spotted a new addition to the room. There was a cylinder in the floor, parallel to the food wall (which had been cleared of the uneaten food). It was about 3.5 feet in length and was just as white as the rest of the room. Glancing at each other, the two of them took a few steps forward to inspect the object, but stumbled slightly as the texture of the floor suddenly changed.
‚ÄúThe bait? As in Alfie? You were using him as bait? For what?‚Äù
that has to go? Why not some other person?‚Äù He crossed his arms as he stared down his friend, confident he'd stumped her this time.
?!‚Äù Dean blurted out incredulously, cutting Cas off. ‚ÄúI've been out of it for
‚ÄúSo...‚Äù Cas began after a few moments of silence, ‚Äúdo I have a video like that as well?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I know Bela and Adam don't really like him either. Ruby and Lilith, on the other hand...‚Äù she paused, heaving a great sigh and rolling her eyes dramatically, ‚Äúthose two were
The pair were led down the hall again, but this time to a slightly larger room. This one had a desk to the left with one of those tiny sinks and a short, a short, round rollie stool for the doctor sit on, two seats to the right, and a large, cushioned examination table with paper covering it.
been!‚Äù Dean demanded, arms crossed, frustration sprouting from every pour.
met him.‚Äù
Amara scoffed. ‚ÄúIt's not like any of us actually
Once Dean calmed down, he noticed that the flow was quick but gentle, and he didn't even feel a current. He would have expected them all to be knocked off of their feet as the water surged around them, but nothing of the sort happened and they remained upright.
They sat there for a while longer in comfortable silence, just enjoying each other. Later, when they finally disentangled themselves from each other, with Dean in the driver's seat, Cas in the back, Sam would finally rouse from his deep slumber.
‚ÄúThat's right! Egg production drops. So if we want to produce the most amount of eggs, then we... anybody?‚Äù The Alpha male prompted.
‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù
Benny laughed, then said, ‚ÄúWhat? You tryna get rid of me for longer?‚Äù
Dean pointed at them and asked, ‚ÄúWhat are those for?‚Äù
!‚Äù Dean begs. He's gasping and writhing, but the Angel just smirks at him, the bastard!
Donna pulled a tube of jelly outta nowhere, popped the cap and squirted a huge dollop onto Dean's lower abdomen. The Omega flinched, expecting it to be cold, but it was actually pleasantly warm, almost hot. That realization out of the way, Dean settled back and watched the tech expectantly. She had taken out a wand and was methodically dragging it along his belly, smearing that warm jelly all over as she did. He wished he could see the monitor, but she had it turned away from him at the moment as she studied the screen, brow creased in concentration as she moved the wand this way and that without needing to look at it.
‚ÄúAnd... we're not sure where Amy is,‚Äù Sam added.
The two of them snuggled into each other for a few more moments, just enjoying each other's company and presence. The peace didn't last for long, however. Before they were ready, the room's automated lighting system decided to kick in, informing them of their need to rise and start the day. Dean grumbled in offense and Cas signed wearily, but eventually, they disentangled themselves from each other's limbs and reluctantly climbed out of bed.
~*~*~*~
‚ÄúIt's in just a few days. You can find printed schedules in the rec rooms,‚Äù Charlie supplied.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked, beginning to get frustrated again. ‚ÄúWhat am I lookin' at?‚Äù
"So... what now?" Cas asks, unsure.
‚ÄúYes. That's it. You were given the Omega implant, and Castiel,‚Äù she turned to the Alpha, ‚Äúyou were given the Alpha implant.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, ya
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Cas answered.
‚ÄúMm-hm. Thirsty.‚Äù Stranger looked Dean up and down, licking his chapped lips. ‚ÄúYeah, I get it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù Hector thought for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat's that called?‚Äù He pointed out a part under the hood.
Dean quickly located the strange tile he'd found and crouched down in front of it, trying to study it and find out what made it different from the others. Using his fingertips, he felt around the edges going up and down each of the four sides. After a few moments, he felt like he might be able to lift it from the floor if only he had a bit more leverage.
‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù she stopped in her tracks and turned back around to face Dean once again. ‚ÄúYa did a good thing.‚Äù Dean's brow knit in confusion, but then she continued, ‚ÄúAlistair was a bane. He was horrible to his Omegas, even the ones who liked him. He was the worst kind of influence on his children, and we are
I seriously hadn't planned on killing him. It just sort of happened. I really think he deserved it though, and I really like that it was Dean who did it.
‚ÄúHm,‚Äù Dean said thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWell, in that case... I wish we had a way out of here!‚Äù He exclaimed loudly, bending his arms up at the elbows and spreading his arms out, spinning around to face the rest of the room expectantly. When nothing happened he said, ‚ÄúExit? Doorway? Open says me?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell... does Cas's scent seem to make it better?‚Äù
‚ÄúI really am sorry, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou may not have a choice, Castiel,‚Äù Alfie announced, as if reading the Alpha's mind. He picked himself off of the floor after the latest wave of his heat and got himself into a sitting position next to Cas once more.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
person I've ever met!‚Äù
The room contained a large television screen suspended from the ceiling on the left. In the center of the room was a large conference table, elongated and oval, with a tablet resting on top. To the far right of the room was another floor-to-ceiling window that took up the whole wall, and it was showcasing a brilliant and sunny afternoon sky, with a grassy field and gentle breeze blowing through it, bending the tall, green blades.
‚ÄúWe've just found out that we're expecting quintuplets,‚Äù Cas explained, ‚Äúand Dean is less than thrilled about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd how do you know if something's wrong with the spark plugs?‚Äù
‚ÄúMost definitely. Alphas are stereotypically very possessive and territorial. Not to mention pretty hot-headed and aggressive. Conflict would definitely be a major issue if not nipped in the bud.‚Äù
Try as he might, he couldn't help but notice... everything. He noticed that he, thankfully, didn't feel any pain when Cas's (admittedly
‚ÄúOh, crap. Hold on.‚Äù Charlie moved past the two and rushed over to the window. Once she reached it, she banged on it once with an open palm. A ripple of color erupted from the point of contact and spread out to the edges of the glass before going still once more. When nothing else happened Charlie grunted in mild frustration before repeating the action once, twice, three more times before finally the scene outside changed. The view shifted and the sunny field gradually darkened and became slick and rain-soaked. ‚ÄúThere we go. That's better.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe left for work, as well. About an hour ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúI couldn't agree more!‚Äù Without further ado, Dean stepped forward and immediately dumped the rabbit food off of one of the platters, and then preceded to load it up with burgers and a few of those mini pies.
Well,
distraught over Gabriel's death,‚Äù Abby explained, her voice and features dripping with mock sympathy. ‚ÄúShe just couldn't see staying in office for even another day. So we took pity on her. It seemed cruel to make her stay any longer than she could stand.‚Äù
After that, they each relaxed a bit more as they talked ‚Äì though Dean was the one who did most of the relaxing since Meg had already seemed as relaxed as she could possibly get. They ate more fruit together (Dean only grumbled slightly), and gossiped.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
(See the end of the chapter for
Both Cas and Dean's eyes grew wide at that. Castiel was the first to recover. ‚Äú
‚ÄúWell, the maximum punishment would have been indefinite. Meaning he could've been locked away for the rest of his life.‚Äù
That caused a whole new wave of questions to bombard Cas's mind, but he would have to circle back to that later. At least now he knew there wasn't anything wrong with him, at least according to Alfie. He still felt guilty over his body's response, involuntary though it may be.
,‚Äù Dean insisted. It was still hard for him to say it, but he was beginning to accept his condition more and more.
‚ÄúAmy! There you are,‚Äù Benny exclaimed, pretending that he hadn't already found her just minutes before. Or that he'd just overheard her scheming with Abby.
‚ÄúNow,‚Äù she said, cutting him off and shooing him in the right direction with her hands.
‚ÄúOh. Sorry, man.‚Äù He immediately sat still. He hadn't even realized he'd been fidgeting as much as he was. Instead, he occupied himself with looking out the windows.
‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù the lead Alpha groaned, speaking to no one in particular, ‚Äúthey're gonna draw a crowd.‚Äù She took a deep breath and turned back to face the others in the room.
‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù Cas sighed. He didn't know what to make of this information. He seemed to just be accumulating even more questions. Cas, who had been facing Alfie with the wall to his left, turned so that he could rest his back against the wall. He thumped his head back and looked at the ceiling. Alfie did the same, resting his back against the same wall, though he did it without thumping his head. After a few minutes, Cas continued, still looking at the ceiling. ‚ÄúWill I get to see Dean again?‚Äù
Quickly, before he could change his mind, he explained to her the concerns he'd been having about the voice that Cas had used with him after his ultrasound a couple of days before. It didn't seem like it should be that big of a deal, but he just couldn't let it go. If there's any way that his free will could somehow be overridden, then he had to know about it and nip it in the bud.
Mia's abruptly brought out of her daze by a crashing sound and jumps but also smiles to herself because so much changed so quickly in her relationship with Jack and they quickly became pretty close friends; Jack finally having someone newer than him and Mia having someone sorta new that she could kinda cling onto.
for them both and went online to look for ideas. He finally settled on the Valentine's Day festival for tomorrow night and bought the tickets. Dean himself thought the whole thing was cheesy and overrated but knew Cas would enjoy it. He was happy with his decision and decided to surprise Cas tomorrow when they were out.
Hannah nodded then said, "yeah. Brimrose Cemetery. I can show you the way. But why?"
Dean said, "well good. I'm glad. You deserve it."
Cas said, "no it takes about 15 minutes but I like to be early."
Mia laughed then said okay and pecked Sam's lips and yelled "love you!" as she and Dean walked out.
Mia shrugged and said, "I don't know when Jack's going to come for me so I thought I'd hang with you guys until he does."
Ben said okay then they talked for about an hour and he told her about Lisa's favorite food (lasagna), her favorite song (My Heart Will Go On), her favorite movie (Titanic), how she was always so strong and never gave up and she always gave her all, and Ben's favorite thing about her; no matter what happened she always had more love to give, even when the person she gave it to didn't deserve it.
Dean said, "that's great to hear, bud. Do you have any friends? Or girlfriends?
Sam stretched then said, "No, it's okay. I'll get up and eat with you then shower once you leave."
They only got one wiper done before the next person got there. They needed their headlights replaced and that took about an hour for each headlight.
Feedback is appreciated. Guess I‚Äôll put my normal Wattpad end A/N here?
When they got out, Dean asked Cas to dry them off and he did then they continued on the trail. As they walked, Dean said, "Cas, earlier I was thinking about our first date and... do you remember the trail guide, Kris?"
Dean said, "oh. Well, looked like you learned a lot and she raised you well."
They walked through the lunch line and got a few different things. Mia got a burger, a fruit cup, and chocolate milk. Ben got pizza, a piece of apple pie, and orange juice.
After government was gym and they were playing tennis. The teacher told Mia she didn't have to participate if she didn't want to but she did anyway.
Everyone said goodnight and Cas nodded then Mia kissed Sam and Charlie goodnight and left.
By the time Ben came out of his daze, the car was done being washed and Dean was asking him a question, waving his hands in his face. Ben looked at him and said, "huh? Sorry, I zoned out."
End chapter
Ben said, "Hey," back then waved a hand and said, "come on! I'll show you to your room."
Cas took them and excitedly said, "Dean I love it! I can't wait to go tonight!"
Mia looked around and said, "umm I think just Dean and Jack."
(See the end of the chapter for
Hester nodded and Mia said, "did he ever tell you about the first time we met?"
Ben looked up from his phone and said, "yeah sure," then got up and started walking to his room with Mia following.
Jack smiled and said, "glad you like it!"
When they walked into the men's room, Dean said, "wow Ben you do better than me!"
Ben said, "definitely not."
of people in it. In the middle was a
Mia said, "you're leaving?!"
Cas smiled and blushed then nodded his head and poofed to his room.
Hannah said, "o-okay," and looked confused but did what she was told.
When it was closing time, Dean had Carlos do the bathrooms then let Ben count all the money and showed him how to put it all in the safe and the computer.
Dean said, "yeah of course! I'll have Jody give Claire your number and then she can text you."
Mia cracked Ben's door and saw him cuddling her with them both asleep on his bed. She smiled then closed the door and walked to the car.
"AM?!" Mia said.
"Do you ever miss him?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack said, "You'll regret it. You'll get sick, at least, if you don't. Now, close your eyes."
The last 15 minutes of English were always free time to get caught up on reading or other work so Mia took the time to talk to her a bit.
Mia said, "yeah, I bet. If either of you have homework though, you might want to get some of it done."
Mia said, "oh. Well, you did a great job from what I've seen so far."
When he came back, she was finishing up so he thanked her then said he had some notes to finish and then they could go home. Mia said okay and went back to reading.
Once they finished eating, Cas said, "so what do you want to ask me?"
Once Cas let go, he still held Dean's hand and said, "ready to go?"
Mia said, "do you have any happy memories of you 3?"
As Mia got out of the shower, she smiled at the memories and got dressed.
"Guess that's why we all hold onto life so hard. Even the dead. We're all just scared of the unknown." - Sam Winchester
Once the song was over, Mia asked if they could stop at Starbucks up the road. Dean rolled his eyes and huffed but pulled into the drive-thru anyway.
The next morning, they all got up and and went back to Stanford so Mia and Sam could show them around a little bit before going back to the bunker.
They all waved bye then Mia said, "I'm gonna go out her down and take a nap myself."
(See the end of the chapter for
Once he set everything up, they all settled in and grabbed they own choice of junk food from the pile. There was so much there that Dean yelled at Claire (privately) then told her she had to pay it back somehow.
"Correct."
"Um, sure. You have good handwriting. I could have you start researching this case for me if you want?" as he handed her a case file.
She said, "hey Cas. How was work?"
Cas said, "are you ready to go?"
Dean said, "well, didn't she look a little like Ruby to you or am I crazy?"
Mia nodded her head then said, "yeah! What did you and Ben do yesterday?"
I like the second quote because it shows that no matter who or what you are, we're all scared of not knowing and not living and that essentially puts us all on the same level. We should all love and care for/about each other because we never know when we're not going to be here anymore.
Cas said, "yes. I didn't understand it then but that's why I knew so much about him and what he was feeling and how he thinks and what he wanted. I wasn't supposed to recognize all of those things but I was already starting to think on my own and rebel so that's why it happened with me but none of the other Dean and Cas's. The mark I left on him wasn't just physical. It was emotional and mental too. That's why he and I are so connected and seem to read each other's mind sometimes. Well, part of it. It wouldn't have been so strong if we didn't already have some connection."
Sam smiled and said, "awww thanks. You ever miss her?"
Jack and Cas said, "Ruby?!"
As they walked, Cas said, "a patient in her 60's. Her name is Marg. She's recovering from burns on her legs and part of her chest."
Jack said, "a little but it's okay," then smiled and said, "come one. You're probably hungry."
Sam said, "really? I thought I was the only one still grieving."
Dean said, "she let you do that?"
Cas said, "yeah that's because she's such a bright person and her soul is the brightest out of all of us and I feel and see that every time I'm around her or her name is mentioned."
The third quote I chose because it's my favorite Sam quote and I was watching season 4 a few weeks ago and it happened to be in the episode I was watching (4.4 Metamorphosis in case you were wondering). To me, it always feels like he's speaking directly to me because I always feel like I'm constantly on the edge of falling into a depression pit and feeling like I have no choice other than to do everything I already do. But this reminds me that I don't have to give in to that pit and I do have a choice. I may not choose some things like when I pay bills or go to work or things like that but I still make important choices everyday like what I decide to eat and drink or when I go to bed/how much sleep I get and how I treat those around me. Those all may seem like little things but they really are the big things and can easily affect everything. This reminds me that even when I do fall into that depression pit, I can choose to figure out what's depressing me and how to get out of the pit. It's definitely not easy but it is possible.
Jack walked away and Mia started looking around, observing everyone and taking everything in. After a few minutes, she started to zone out and ended up thinking about the first time she met Jack.
She walked through the shelves and ended up pulling out a random book that had an interesting looking spine. As she sat down at a table, she opened it and saw the text change from Enochian to English so she could read it.
Mia sees Dean get the biggest smile she's only ever seen on his face when he's with his kids or talking about them as Sam walks up to her and puts his hand on her back saying, "Hey I heard you talking to Ben. You did amazing."
Mia said, "aww sweetie. I know what it's like to feel lost and alone like that. It sucks but you'll get through it, I promise. And there's no timeline for grief. I'm not gonna say it gets easier because it's not that it gets easier, you simply just learn how to live with a hole in your heart. And sure eventually there will be days where you can talk about them or think about them without wanting to cry but you don't need to rush it. How, when, and where you get there is different for everyone and that's okay. I still think about and miss my family every day. So, no timeline. And never let anyone make you feel bad for still grieving because even years later, I'm still grieving."
Mia said, "well Sam, Dean does have his own business and you know how he loses track of time. I called him half an hour ago though and he said he was finishing up the car he was working on then would be on his way. And Jack is literally God so I'm sure he's busy too."
When he got back, dinner was ready and Ben was picking up his books. The kids were up from their naps and already in their chairs as Cas had gotten them up, and Sam came out of the shower a few minutes after.
At about 7:30, they were both ready and went out to the car. Mia drove to the school and they got there at about 8.
He waved his hand for her to come to the back door and they went out to the garage. Dean grabbed Mia a water bottle from the cooler then showed her the 3 cars he was working on at the moment; the '84 Mustang that he and Ben worked on, a '97 Camaro, and a '67 Impala. His favorite was, of course, the Impala because he already knew what needed to be done and how to do it without a second thought.
Ben quickly ate then went to put his shoes on and even ended up beating Dean to the car. On the way there, Dean let Ben pick all the songs since they listened to the same stuff and it took only about 10 minutes to get there.
Sam said, "there's this little coffee place I always go to around the corner."
Mia said, "okay well tell me about her!"
Sam and Ben ran to it and when they got there, the poltergeist was leaning over one of the girls with its hand around her neck and the other girl was across the room, staring and not knowing what to do.
"Hey Mia I need to be to work at 3 so I need you to be ready by 2:30," Cas said at dinner.
, in 10 minutes or I'm coming back in here and you're not gonna like it," then shut the door.
Dean put his arm around Ben's shoulders and said, "that's okay. You don't need a lot of friends. And girlfriends will come eventually."
Classes started at 8:15 so they quickly went to the office where Mia meant the principal and signed a visitors paper then they walked to his first class, Biology.
Carlos thought for a second then said, "probably Dean, honestly. His energy when he's here is just amazing and so happy and infectious, you can tell he truly loves what he's doing."
Dean started to walk out but turned back around to say, "Sam, are you sure you'll be okay? I know you haven't really been back there since..."
They both smiled and Tessa went out then Sam turned to Mia and said, "Hey you wanna go get lunch?"
Mia sighed and said, "okay. Can we go see Jess? Her and I were close friends when she was with Sam and I miss her. Plus, I noticed that a lot of Sam's nightmares have to do with her and his mom. We never talk about them, and please don't mention them to anyone, but I'm always there to comfort him and I'd like to know that she really is okay and safe."
Cas said, "no, not really. A lot of people look alike in this world and, Ruby being a demon, she really could take almost any face or person she wanted."
Jack walked through the buffet line with Mia and made sure she was sitting down then said, "now, you eat and enjoy and I'm going to take care of a few things. You can explore a little bit after you're done or come find me. And if you can't find me, just call my name."
He smiled and said, "you're welcome. You ready to go?"
Mia's smile got wider and she said, "sure! I'd love that!"
Mia said, "I know sweetie. You're exactly like your dad. But I promise you there's nothing wrong with sharing your feelings or crying other than when you think everyone is asleep."
Ben shrugged his shoulders and said, "eh a few friends but no, no girlfriends."
Today Jack had agreed to take Mia to Heaven, at least for a little bit. He hadn't told her
When Mia was about halfway done with her sandwich, she said, "so I know your childhood was difficult, but could you tell me more about it? Like what's one memory or thing that really sticks out?"
She said, "you're welcome," and hugged him until he let go, which was a few minutes, but she didn't mind because she was learning more about Dean as well as Sam but also felt like she and Dean were
Hannah nodded then said, "yeah. She was the other one in our group but about 2 months ago started acting really weird and then a few weeks after she killed herself and I started seeing her at her funeral about a week later."
When they brought the drawers out for the registers, Carlos was already there sweeping. Dean introduced them then, like with Ben, Carlos hugged Mia but was more respectful and only gave her a side hug, though he still gave her a squeeze before letting go.
Hester said, "bye!" then walked out and Mia went on her phone while Cas changed. After he got done, he said, "alright, you ready to go home?"
Mia asked what his favorite childhood memory was and about how he felt he was doing as a dad with all of his kids individually. Dean said his favorite memory was getting the Samulet because it made Dean realize just how much he was doing for Sam as well as the fact that Sam actually recognized and appreciated all he did for him. He also said that he felt like he did a pretty good job with Ash and Jack but felt like he could do more with Claire and Ben so had been doing his best to get to know them and connect with them more.
They rushed out and Sam managed to gather all his stuff for the meeting then get to the room on time, though barely.
"Ben get up!" Dean said as he turned Ben's room light on and pulled his covers off. Ben just groaned and rolled over to go back to sleep.
Once the sun was down, they decided to go to the bookstore Mia wanted to check out then a few places Sam wanted to show her.
Ben said, "thanks! I used to do that all the time for a few months when Mom needed the extra help and I got a job."
"That's so good! She's daddy's little girl huh?"
Mia said, "why?"
Ben groaned and worked on getting out of bed then finally got up and got dressed. Once he got to the kitchen, he saw Dean at the table eating breakfast and sat down. Dean handed him an egg sandwich and said, "hurry up! We leave in 5 minutes."
Dean nodded his head and said, "yeah. I think it hurt me more than my dad. I mean, Dad was, he was hurt but for different reasons. He was hurt because Sam was supposed to stay with us and that was our legacy and all that crap. He was more mad than hurt. I, I was hurt because I felt like someone I had been through everything with, someone who was basically my purpose and reason for being helpful was leaving. It felt like the only thing I knew was safe was gone. And when I went to see him that night at school, as you know, I stood outside for hours scared because I had already been most likely just left by my dad and I couldn't take the hurt I knew I'd feel if Sam didn't want me either. That night felt like the one who always gave me direction and told me what to do had left and the other person, my purpose basically for so many years, had left once so what was stopping him from doing it again? I was terrified that night."
‚ÄúSir?‚Äù asked Charlotte, her gaze cast downwards.
‚ÄúUh, Cas? What are you doing?‚Äù asked Dean as he tried to look the man in the eye awkwardly.
‚ÄúI was having trouble sleeping‚Äù replied Sam, which was partly true. He was plagued by nightmares ever since the night they escaped the vampire hoard.
" Maybe he didn't do it."
"Dean?"
Sometimes there's no rest for the good either
Sam gave him a smirk and then gave him a gesture to ‚Äútake the floor‚Äù.
wildly in the wind. As it swayed it made an awful metallic singing that Sam was certain would haunt his dreams in the days to come.
‚ÄúDean? Whoa!‚Äù came a familiar voice from the front, the wagon came to a full stop.
Castiel by this point had cleaned Charlie‚Äôs wound and decided that it was more from shock than anything that had the woman pass out. When he voiced his opinion to the others they all breathed a sigh of relief.
"Seriously, what the hell?!"Dean repeated.
It was like nothing Dean ever thought it would be... and he
Claire grinned and grabbed hers. Cracking it open and taking a deep pull. "Hell yeah. That's what I needed" she murmured. Dean grinned back at her as he took a swig from his own.
Someone was talking to him.The hot blonde woman who had given him his first drink, quickly followed by three more. He tried to concentrate on what she was saying but he couldn't hear her over the screaming coming from the stage. She pressed herself against him and kissed him.
Sam quickly pulled a sheet over his brother‚Äôs now naked form while Cas took his bag from Charlie, indicating for her to place the towels and water on the stand between the beds. She did so and quickly left after Cas dismissed her wordlessly.
was broken by the sound of pebbles scattering and a soft gasp. Sam squeezed the other‚Äôs shoulder before he began inching forward again. As he raised his sword, ready to swing he was knocked back by the fleeing form that flew from the crypt.
"Same", replied Dean, then he quickly added "Holy shit! It worked Sammy!"
‚ÄúWait, that is why you have been going out every night? To patrol?‚Äù asked Gabriel. ‚ÄúYou have been doing that every night since you arrived here!‚Äù
Why was I there?" Dean furrowed his brow trying to remember. " Why can't I remember anything? Fuck!" He wanted to throw something in frustration. No. He wanted to break something.
" We're sorry. The number you have reached is currently out of the service area. Please try again later" a mettallic voice announced.
Jody realizes that Donna hasn't  answered her messages or been in contact for hours.
At that exact moment the room began to spin. His stomach lurched and he suddenly felt the urge to throw-up. He was trapped behind the table though. The blonde woman on his right was gripping his thigh and some dude with a safety pin through his nose and a tattoo that read "Kill Everything" scrawled across his scrawny bicep was on his left. More people sat across from them.
Sam's lips twitched as he tried not laugh. "I doubt that", too late he realised that had spoken out loud, earning glares from everyone. He cleared his throat. "Cas is right. Enough bickering. Just tell us what's going on, Gabriel?"
" Ouch! Watch your bony elbows!" Claire hissed when Alex accidently hit her in the ribs.
‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù said Cas, who was still unable to look the younger Winchester in the eye. ‚ÄúLet us go check on our brothers‚Äù. Without a backward glance, Cas strode out of the carriage house.
Frowning she checked the current time and compared it to the last reply Donna sent her. Four hours. " Fuck. Fuck. Fuck," she chanted while pressing the call button. " C'mon Hanscum, pick up! "
"Well, that's my cue to go get us some grub. Do you want anything?" Dean asked.
Closing his eyes, Dean braced himself and yanked as hard as he could with his good hand just as it bobbed him upwards and back down again.
He turned away switching his focus onto Dean who was now shivering and trying to hide it. "You cold, Dean-o?" Behind him he could hear Claire's soft, trembling sigh of relief.
" Want me to..." began Jody but Dean cut her off.
Looking around frantically for a means of escape Claire sees only one option.
Dazed but not unconscious Dean tried to scramble upwards but was pushed back down. The gun was just out of his reach...
Gabriel stared into Claire's frightened eyes. "Ah" he said softly, "I understand". For a moment Claire thought she saw sadness and pity in his gaze then it was gone just as quickly.
Suddenly John smashed the bottle against the edge of the sink. Dean jerked at the noise.¬† In two strides John was on him again. Lifting him up by the shirt front.
On stage he could see a five hundred pound man with a massive black mohawk scream into the microphone. People were jumping and flailing about in front of the band. The whole scene seemed chaotic and he felt an overwhelming panic set in. His body started to quake and his breathing became erratic.
The blow had snapped her head back. Eyes watering and blood gushing from her nose Claire knew it was broken. The demon laughed which pissed her off. She launched herself at it only to be tossed back against the wall and lifted up off the floor by her throat.
‚ÄúPersonally? I think they are playing with us much like a cat does with a mouse before it finishes the job,‚Äù answered Dean as he looked over the dead at his feet then returned his gaze to Castiel‚Äôs‚Äù Trying to scare us before the final blow‚Äù.
" I don't have much time. Sam is here. I heard him. His screams confirm that he's alive. Listen to me carefully, Dean, you have to find us! We were fooled and looking in the wrong spot! It's at a Fairy rift...Crap, ...they're coming. I have to go."
Gabriel angrily wiped his tears away and looked at his brother in astonishment, ‚ÄúHow can you tell?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe...thing...it had glowing eyes...‚Äù the young woman was still looking around as if expecting the creature would suddenly appear from thin air. ‚ÄúPlease, do not allow it to take me again!‚Äù
"I don't understand the question then", Cas frowned.
The lights in the bunker began flickering then exploding in a shower of sparks. Claire covered her head but didn't run.Then everything was doused in red light while an alarm blared. Dean let out a cry of distress.
The bunker was like a stupid maze. She wasn't sure which way to go. She stood there listening, trying to figure out which direction Dean's room would be. This time Dean let out an animalistic scream of pain and Claire took off running.
old!" Dean exclaims and instantly winces from the pain.
Jody hung up her phone and rubbed her temples. Her headache was creeping closer to becoming a friggin' migraine.
Gabriel tossed that memory aside and grabbed another.
" What?"asked Jody as her mind raced. She cleared her throat "What the hell is a queera on a stick have to do with the Winchester's?"
Putting his hands up in front of himself Dean very slowly got to his feet. He took note thar this one wasn't wearing any armor, so it wasn't a guard. Dean figured he had several inches in height and at least twenty pounds on the guy. He could probably take him, even with his injuries...
A cannon blasted through the pine tree that was a mere three feet from Dean‚Äôs shoulder. Cursing his luck he began to move through the woods as fast as he dared, the sun slowly sinking behind the horizon making his flight more precarious. Risking a glance behind him he could see the Confederates advancing and he knew that he and Sam had to get going else they risked capture and possible death. Again.
‚ÄúHow many? How many sons of bitches do we have left to wipe out?‚Äù He felt his temper rising and that was good. Rage was an emotion he could use and better yet-control.
Castiel jumped to his feet while Gabriel rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúSomething attacked Miss Bradbury. We were trying to discern the extent of her injuries and find out what happened when
"So, where is it now?" wondered Claire.
Xander stopped feeding to block and the blow. His chin dripping in Dean‚Äôs blood he looked down and laughed at him. ‚ÄúNice try, old man‚Äù he taunted. Just as he was bending back down to finish Dean off there was a whistling sound and then Xander‚Äôs eyes widened, his head slid sideways onto the ground while his body fell back onto Dean's legs.
"You better think long and hard before you finish that sentence", Dean growled. The sisters exchanged questioning glances.
Gabriel laughed while Sam nearly choked on a mouthful of air.
A soft knock at his door brought Dean out of his grim thoughts. ‚ÄúCome in‚Äù he answered.
She started to hit it harder. Dean was the best damn hunter in the world and a tough son of a bitch. A total bad ass. A strong and fucking terrifying killer. He killed Hitler and Gods...Even Death! If he could be hurt and broken by whatever monster he just went against what chance did the rest of them have?
"Oberon's host! Free your friend by breaking what is round!" That said the woman vanished.
‚ÄúI realize my stature is short but do not mistake me for a damsel in distress big guy‚Äù huffed Gabriel as he followed him, pulling a Remington revolver from his coat he scanned the surrounding headstones and tried to keep up to Sam‚Äôs long-legged stride. ‚ÄúWhat are we looking for?‚Äù
"What do you mean by Mini Dean?"
Sam's P.O.V.
Distracted by his thoughts, Dean didn‚Äôt hear the soft footfalls behind him until it was too late, before he could turn around he felt the searing white pain on the back of his head before the world became dark.
!" Dean muttered in anger.
Gabriel pulled the chair over to Dean's bedside. The hunter twitched but didn't wake, Gabriel sighed.
Taken aback Dean stared at her. ‚ÄúI ah meant for you to ah make it. You know...since I ah...‚Äù he glanced down at his splintered leg in embarrassment.
"Sa√≠rse. You say it like sur-shuh", answered Sam as he searched for something he could use to cut himself with.
" Quit your whining, Winchester."
Jody and Donna share an uncomfortable ride back to Donna's house.
(Sorry for the long wait but life happened and I
‚ÄúWhat do you mean by society‚Äôs rules?‚Äù
They were standing so close that Dean could feel Cas‚Äôs breath on his face. Slowly he lifted his hand and brushed Cas‚Äôs hair off his forehead. It was soft under his fingertips and he wondered what it would be like to fist his hands in it.
"Beer and a protein bar? Really, Sammy?"
‚ÄúWell, that is a darn shame‚Äù, she sighed dramatically while she gave Dean another once over and left.
Dean took a deep breath and nearly passed out from the pain. " Son of a bitch! Mother fucking son of a whore!" he wheezed while gripping the bed to stay upright.
Sam brushed Dean‚Äôs hair off his sweaty brow and sighed. If Castiel was to be coming in soon, surely it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to lay down as he waited? Sam wondered to himself and then gave into his exhaustion. He would wake when the almost doctor came in... as he lay on the empty bed he couldn‚Äôt help but think about Gabriel and his beautiful eyes. There was something about him the Sam couldn‚Äôt help but be drawn to...it will be interesting to learn more about the mysterious individuals who made Crossroads Manor their home he thought...He spared one more look at the still form of his older brother before his hazel eyes fluttered shut and soon Sam was off into a deep slumber.
‚ÄúDean?‚Äù Sam saw the anger that was building in Dean‚Äôs face and knew he needed to defuse it before Dean could self-destruct.
" Help me roll him" said Alex once she was certain they had taken care of everything on Dean's front side.
Deans memories and lack there of, are playing havoc with his mind.
‚ÄúSam? Why are you standing there boy? Those pigs need feeding!‚Äù exclaimed Missouri as she came up behind him.
"Dean! Dean! You're hurt. Badly. You can't .." began Jody.
" Dean! Dean, it's Jody. You're safe!"
Charlie nodded and turned to leave but stopped and quickly crossed the room to the dresser. Opening the top drawer she indicated to Sam to look inside. A smile twitching on her lips.
‚ÄúGood, Brother Joshua knows how to wield the whip well. Father will be pleased‚Äù.
Sam stood over Dean and looked down at the table. The property was much more vast than he had thought it to be. The borders went well beyond what he had been walking. ‚ÄúNo wonder the vamps had been able to sneak in and out,‚Äù he thought to himself in disgust.
https://www.presspubs.com/fairy-falls-part-of-indian-legend-of-love-gone-awry/article_4e30ae32-ab98-51bc-9b7a-dea6deda6666.html
"No. I'm just fucking peachy, thanks", Claire said looking up from the broken phone whose pieces she had been gathering from under the table.
‚ÄúSo, you think something waited out here to kill Joshua after they had feasted on the pigs? Why?‚Äù puzzled Dean as he looked between Cas and the corpse.
Dean waited for Sam to say more but apparently he wasn't going to,"Care to share with the rest of the class?"
" What the fuck?!" Claire bellowed as she found herself pinned between Alex and a strange man. Though because of her broken nose it more or less sounded like " Whab da duck".
"You'll never find your precious Sammy or the angel!" It warned as it flinched in pain.
"Why don't you grab some shut eye", Dean suggested giving him a side eyed look. His brow was furrowed a bit, which meant Dean was concerned.
"Isn't that the chick from
"You certainly have yer hands full with that one!"Rowena said with a shake of her head. "Now that¬† it's just us grown ups let's discuss terms shall we?"
"I'm a nice guy" Gabriel shrugged and helped Claire to her feet. "Now go crash in Sam's room. He has a pillow top mattress" he winked at her. "Room twenty one."¬† He then disappeared.
‚ÄúThanks, Cas,‚Äù said Dean whose ears had gone pink at the tips.‚ÄùI can speak up for myself though.‚Äù
Dean smirks. ‚ÄúLove it when you save me a lot of work.‚Äù
‚ÄúGive me your knife,‚Äù Castiel says.
Seeing that Dean and Sam remain quiet, Cas simply turns around and walks away. Dean instantly follows him, because he needs to. Their conversation isn‚Äôt over. At least not for him, because Sam remains on the war room and doesn‚Äôt follow them.
‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù Charlie asks suddenly.
‚ÄúShut up, Dean.‚Äù
Chuck smiled and closed his eyes, exhausted. ‚ÄúGuess that when one is about to die, he sees things clearly. It would have come in handy back then.‚Äù His voice was almost a low hum, but Castiel could still hear him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the load you‚Äôre going to have to carry until the end of your days. It‚Äôs a heavy burden. It‚Äî‚Äù But Chuck didn‚Äôt finish his sentence.
‚ÄúIt is. But I‚Äôm still worried about how this would difficult the driving.‚Äù
Because they already have the person they want, and that is what really matters. They will get the other things they want sooner or later after they figure them out.
‚ÄúWait, there is‚Äî‚Äù Cas says, suddenly, pulling Dean away from his thoughts. Dean looks at him, with glassy eyes, looking lost, but almost ready to speak his truth. Cas looks so beautiful right now. ‚ÄúThere's one thing she's afraid of. There's one thing strong enough to stop her.‚Äù
Dean sings the songs, feeling how his lungs are craving for air and how his throat feels raspier the more he sings, but he doesn‚Äôt care; he is going to put all his voice in this moment and he is going to jump as high as he can with every song. He can believe that he is seeing AC/DC.
‚ÄúNot a single hello?‚Äù Dean teases.
‚ÄúHe went for breakfast.‚Äù He zips up his bag and then he sits on the bed. ‚ÄúHey, Cas,‚Äù Dean starts to say. Castiel doesn‚Äôt meet his eyes. He isn‚Äôt ready to do that yet. He feels a bit better than when he left the bar, but his heart still aches. ‚ÄúWhat happened last night?‚Äù
Things aren‚Äôt perfect, though. Cas has terrible nightmares about the Empty and he has days when he experiences the trauma from the time he spent in that place. He also has nightmares about losing Dean. And he also has days when he misses being an angel and days when he still struggles with certain aspects of being human. Dean also has nightmares about his time in Hell, about the horrors he saw during his hunting years, about the people he couldn‚Äôt save and of course, about all the times he lost Cas. He also gets days when he feels like he isn‚Äôt enough for Cas, days in which his self-loathing hits him hard, days in which he still feels that he is only a fucked up hunter, even if he isn‚Äôt a hunter anymore.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to cook,‚Äù he answered, casually. He had never learnt because he wasn‚Äôt supposed to learn. He was a man and a member of the royal family, so cooking was something he never had to do.
‚ÄúI know, Jody. I know,‚Äù Dean tells her. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù He takes a deep breath. He used to talk to Cas about the worst stuff, and even though he has talked to Jody and he knows that she won‚Äôt judge him, that she will understand him because she also lost her husband in the past, Dean doesn‚Äôt know how to talk about it. He still hasn‚Äôt fully accepted that Cas is dead. He is grieving him, but he can‚Äôt accept Cas‚Äô death. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to even start talking about it.‚Äù
Dean leans to his ear and whispers, ‚ÄúThat I can‚Äôt help it if you like to suck my cock.‚Äù
Castiel turns around and he makes an honest smile. ‚ÄúDo you really have to ask that?‚Äù
‚ÄúI was protecting you,‚Äù Castiel snaps. He grunts at the feeling of Dean sewing his flesh. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt get into his way, you would have died.‚Äù
Cas glares him again. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt joke about that.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Sam says.
Dean moves away from Cas and leans onto the front seat to open the glove box and grab the lube and a condom. This isn‚Äôt the first time they are doing this in the Impala since they got together, so Dean always carries lube and condoms for any occasion. As he grabs those things, Castiel kisses Dean‚Äôs butt cheek and his fingers caress his rim. Dean shivers and moans at the touch. He even drops the lube and the condom on the front seat when Cas manages to lick his rim.
Their hands trace each other‚Äôs bodies; Dean‚Äôs hands move up and down on Cas‚Äô back, reaching his ass and gripping it tightly, loving how firm it is, earning him a surprised gasp from Cas. Cas‚Äô hands move of Dean‚Äôs sides, and his fingers sneak under Dean‚Äôs t-shirt, caressing his skin softly. He rubs his crotch against Dean‚Äôs in slow movements that drive Dean insane and makes him claw his nails on Cas‚Äô back, feeling his shirt and t-shirt. Dean likes taking things slow, but he likes taking things slow when they are naked, so he begins to take off Castiel‚Äôs shirt and t-shirt, which makes Castiel smirk.
Castiel nods and pulls away, going back to the kitchen to finish his remaining breakfast. He looks sad and frustrated. They were having a really good morning but Naomi had to come and fuck it up.
Dean smiles and takes a sip. ‚ÄúFuck, I missed your coffee. No one makes coffee like you, Cas.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you do it Dean. You work hard with your engineering and you can‚Äôt relax on weekends,‚Äù Sam says, sounding worried. Dean knows that his little brother wishes that he could take more time off, but if Dean doesn‚Äôt work, who is going to keep paying the bills? Sam needs to have all the facilities Dean never had.
‚ÄúDean,‚Äù Castiel says, clearing his throat.
He lies to himself and lets himself fall into that lie. When he and Castiel are like this, so close and so intimate, Dean feels as if he wasn‚Äôt Cas‚Äô whore. And he grasps himself to this feeling, seizing the moment. It doesn‚Äôt care how many times he says he has to figure things out, he wants something like this every night. Cas pressed against him, making love to him, Dean giving him all he has, kissing him and feeling him everywhere, being as intimate as they are right now.
‚ÄúBobby, you can‚Äôt even move,‚Äù Ellen says with a teasing smile.
The moment Sam notices Dean is there, he moves his sight away from his mobile phone and looks directly at Dean, making a soft but worried smile. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Sam simply says.
‚ÄúJerk,‚Äù Sam says.
Her words made Castiel emotional and he felt his eyes getting a little bit glassy. He was glad that he was able to change people‚Äôs lives for better, that what he was doing was making a difference, a good difference.
Castiel chuckles. ‚ÄúOnly a little?‚Äù
Castiel stirs and he presses his face against the pillow, letting out a small grunt.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dick,‚Äù Dean chuckles as he begins to place some groceries in the fridge.
They kiss whenever they can, until one of them, or both, has to pull away to let out a really loud moan. Dean opens his eyes and he sees how fucking beautiful Cas looks right now. His lips are parted, his eyes are half closed and his face is flushed. And the moment he opens his eyes and that ocean Castiel has for eyes meet Dean‚Äôs, it makes Dean‚Äôs heart do crazy wild things.
‚ÄúI just wanna go to bed and try to get some sleep.‚Äù
‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he confessed. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt like that I can only listen to it if I go to the opera or if I hire an orchestra. I would love to be able to hear music at home, alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust call me to inform me, okay?‚Äù
He spends the hours left until Cas arrives watching
As they play together, Cas keeps grinning, looking beautiful and Dean can‚Äôt help mirroring it, because he is so damn happy right now. He presses himself closer to Cas, as a way to make sure that he isn‚Äôt dreaming or dead and this is his personal heaven. But the sound of Cas‚Äô laugh makes him realize that this is real, that this isn‚Äôt a dream nor Heaven.
, Castiel is already grabbing with the fork some pasta and eating it. He makes a pleased sound that sounds a bit like a moan, and Dean can‚Äôt help the smile that makes its way into his lips and the happiness and pride he feels.
The hunter spreads Cas‚Äô legs and he places them on his shoulders. He sees how Cas‚Äô eyes open widely the moment he is completely exposed. He even blushes, biting his lower lip and looking at Dean with anticipation; he knows what Dean is up to, so the green eyed man smirks and he gets his tongue on Cas‚Äô rim.
‚ÄúYes, please.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you buy a ring?‚Äù
Soon all the trimmings are placed. All the branches are occupied with a trimming, some of them with two, and it looks awesome. But the top of the tree is still empty, waiting for the star or the angel to be placed.
Dean closes his eyes and inhales needy. ‚ÄúI needed to take the pain away for one night.‚Äù He hates himself for worrying Sam and making him see how he was because of the alcohol. ‚ÄúI just‚Äî‚Äù He takes a deep breath and rubs his exhausted eyes. ‚ÄúI just wanted to stop feeling things for one single night.‚Äù
Charlie just stares at him. She looks as if she is waiting for Dean to say that he is just joking. But Dean looks away, embarrassed, and Charlie‚Äôs face changes into a frown.
When Dean feels settled down inside Cas, he lets out a breath he was holding and he opens his eyes to look at Cas, who is biting his lower lip and looking at Dean with desire. He cups Dean‚Äôs face and kisses him, both of them moaning into it.
Thank you so much for reading, for the kudos, the bookmarks, the comments and the subscriptions :)
Dean smiles and gets his hand on Cas‚Äô thigh, squeezing it tenderly, and Castiel smiles, clearly knowing what Dean wants to say with that gesture. Dean will forever be thankful for having someone who can understand him like Cas does. Getting to know Dean, when it comes to the feelings territory, can be exhausting and exasperating, but Cas is patient, and he knows the many ways Dean expresses himself when he can‚Äôt do it with words. Cas understands Dean and knows him, even when Dean doesn‚Äôt even understand himself. But Cas does. He always does. And Dean is so fucking lucky for it.
‚ÄúWhen will you come back?‚Äù Dean asks after the laughter has faded away.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs delicious, Dean.‚Äù He grins and has another fork. ‚ÄúYou are really talented.‚Äù
Dean searches for the footage from last night, and the moment he finds the footage that shows he and Cas walking in, running from Billie, he immediately presses play and drinks the last of his beer before opening another bottle.
Gabriel chuckled. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I let everybody believe.‚Äù
Castiel blushes even more and he makes a funny face. ‚ÄúYou are the worst.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you mad at me?‚Äù Dean mumbled into his skin.
Castiel blushes a lot and he makes one of his most beautiful smiles, the one that Dean knows Cas only uses with him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a nice thing to say, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, really. We're not gonna send Lucifer into battle inside Cas. What if he doesn't make it?‚Äù
Dean chuckles and looks down, pressing his chin on his collar. He can feel the beating of his heart in his fingers. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say things like that, Cas.‚Äù
And Castiel looks wrecked with those words. Dean frowns in confusion and he is about to say something, but Cas talks. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs late. We need to sleep.‚Äù His hands move away from Dean, even the arm that was tangled with Dean‚Äôs.
‚ÄúThat should be something I should decide myself, Cas.‚Äù
Dean opens his eyes widely and his brows arch as much as possible. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù
‚ÄúThis time it was a regular carriage,‚Äù she commented casually. ‚ÄúThat guard knows that I‚Äôm a kicker. But something I didn‚Äôt expect happened.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! I told you it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to play poker with gummies and m&m‚Äôs instead of money! These things are delicious!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say?‚Äù Castiel keeps laughing. ‚ÄúWell, to be honest I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to propose while your cock was still in my ass, but‚Äî‚Äù Both of them chuckle at that. ‚ÄúBut this is very Dean Winchester.‚Äù He strokes Dean‚Äôs cheek as he smiles. Actually, he likes how Dean proposed, because that‚Äôs how Dean is. He doesn‚Äôt want a sweetened Dean, he wants his Dean, this Dean. The one who can be so badass, awkward and sometimes the cheesiest guy ever. All those things make Dean who he is, and every day that Castiel spends together with Dean, he falls more in love with him.
‚ÄúGood morning, Dean,‚Äù Castiel says with his usual grumpy morning voice, sitting on the bed, resting his back against the headboard. He rubs his eyes and Dean can‚Äôt help smiling at how adorable he is. ‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù
Dean moans and gasps, arching his back and rocking his hips at the same rhythm. Their bodies move in unison, their lines and curves fitting together like a perfect puzzle. Cas thrusts back inside with the same delicacy and gentleness. He presses his forehead against Dean‚Äôs nape and Dean feels how Cas‚Äô panting breathing caresses his skin.
‚ÄúIs that possible?‚Äù Sam asks, who has approached Dean and Cas.
‚ÄúJust order something you can‚Äôt cook at home but you‚Äôve been willing to cook,‚Äù Sam suggests and Dean grins at that great idea.
‚ÄúAre you alright, Dean?‚Äù Castiel asks, giving him an intense and worried look.
‚ÄúHave you told him?‚Äù Sam asked.
While Dean makes scrambled eggs for breakfast, Castiel makes him coffee. Cas has woken up in a good mood this morning, despite of the nightmare he suffered last night, but once they got back to bed, he fell asleep easily and he didn‚Äôt have any nightmare that could torment him.
Castiel smirks and kisses Dean‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúI love you too, Dean.‚Äù
Again, Dean chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got that irritated look on you. Meg‚Äôs back?‚Äù
_____
Castiel quirks an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
Dean looks at Sam for a moment, wanting to make sure that his brother is seeing what he is seeing, and then, Dean immediately puts his gun down and kneels in front of Cas.
As Eileen explained in her message, the spell Cas did has kept a hold on him, hence why he is unconscious. The spell Dean is making is a counter spell to the one Cas‚Äô made, forcing the magic that has taken a hold of Cas to go away.
‚ÄúThen it must be a really old ghost,‚Äù Castiel adds.
. It only takes him five seconds to start dancing along the rhythm, using the broom as a guitar or a microphone, that depends on which part of the song plays. He moves his hips effusively, pretending to be a younger version of Mick Jagger.
‚ÄúHey, Cas, listen to me,‚Äù Dean interrupts.
Meg had arrived to the palace to spend some time, like she always did. But she was trying to get even closer to Castiel and was putting more efforts on being alone with Castiel, finding the lamer excuses to be with him. Castiel had always been aware of Meg‚Äôs sexual desire towards him, but Castiel didn‚Äôt feel anything towards her. Her failed attempts to make him develop some desire towards her were always a bit frustrating, but now they were being exasperating. Castiel wished to be alone, and more importantly, he wished to have a break so he could sneak from the palace and see Dean. It had been almost a week since he last saw him and he was dying to see him again. Dean knew that Meg was staying at the palace, which meant that Castiel couldn‚Äôt see him as often as he wished, but he had expected to visit him during the last nights.
Dean chuckles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a friends meeting with burgers. What are you expecting?‚Äù He walks towards the rack and grabs his leather jacket to put it on.
‚ÄúWell, it's not exactly medical,‚Äù Dean confesses.
Castiel and Dean glare him and say at the same time, ‚ÄúShut up, Sam.‚Äù
Dean gives him a playful smile. ‚ÄúFeeling cheesy tonight, Cas?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs weird, man. If they lived in packs like vampires, they might get two victims to feed them all, but djinns are solitary beings. The only time we encountered two djinns was because it was a mother and a son, and even then, they both feed from the same victim.‚Äù
They got dressed and went downstairs. Dean walked him to his horse and they kissed before Castiel got onto it. They said goodbye to each other and kissed again before Castiel rode away from Dean‚Äôs house. He would see him again in a couple of nights.
Castiel gets his legs around Dean‚Äôs hips and pulls him down, which always makes Dean grin. He rests his hands on Castiel‚Äôs hipbones, lifting him just enough so he can align his cock with Castiel‚Äôs hole. The tight ring of muscles easily gives away and Dean slides inside his husband, whose hands are on Dean‚Äôs blades. Dean leans closer, until his and Castiel‚Äôs foreheads are pressed together, breathing into each other. Without the condom, it feels more intense, warmer, tighter, and Dean loves it.
