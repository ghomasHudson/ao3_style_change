. That’s how bad it is.” John laughed, big and loud. He studied her face, and found clues that pointed him in the right direction: the crow’s feet hiding behind red and swollen eyes, the rawness of her buttoned nose, and the tiredness that took her body in a moment of honesty, when she thought no one else could see.
Finally, he turned to face Sherlock, and something flinched inside Sherlock’s chest. As the kettle hovered over the cup, Sherlock noticed that it was getting dangerously full.
John nodded; his eyes went wide as Sherlock began to tug at the sleeves of his jumper and pulled the thing up and over his head. A pale turquoise, sleeveless shirt lay underneath, sweat causing it to cling to Sherlock’s lower back and abdomen. The muscles of Sherlock’s upper arms made John’s mouth go dry as cotton. John blinked a few times, trying to find tracks for his thought process.
“Well you’re here now, so I don’t have to fool with Herr Holmes.” Irene smiled and Molly chuckled, her posture becoming less tense. She opened the door, and Irene filed in behind her.
Molly stood in front of a floor length mirror, fiddling with her ever present flyaways. Without recognizing he had already started, a sob escaped his chest and he felt the warm tears break free from his lids. Molly turned to look at him and grinned. Molly had a gorgeous smile, always, but today it was radiant, and she was an ethereal creature, glowing right out of her skin. Her dress was simple: a floor length empire waist in white silk. The straps were thin and accentuated her shoulders and her now fantastic posture. Molly’s hair was falling in curls down her back, only the sides woven up into intricate braids. She reminded John of an Elfish princess. It was perfect. She was perfect. He glanced at Jane, who already had tears streaming steadily down her face.
Damn him. He always knew. John squeezed a bit of toothpaste onto the bristles of his brush and began to scrub, trying to keep his eyes on the mirror. There was a small window inside the shower, and it allowed sunlight to pour through it. John was gifted a rather explicit silhouette of Sherlock running a bar of soap over his shoulders.
Callum’s thick eyebrows were knit with worry, and he chewed on his bottom lip. Molly felt a warm stirring in her chest at the sight of the precious gap between his two front teeth. She reached out for his right hand and grabbed it firmly in hers, turning it over to inspect the nails. They were destroyed.
John opened his eyes to find Sherlock looking fixedly at him. His hand traced John’s jaw, catching on the rough stubble left from two days without shaving.
“I’ll let you unpack your things and get comfortable. There are pyjamas and warmer socks in the top drawer. I thought you might need some. I’ll be in the kitchen.” Sherlock was out the door and trotting down the stairs. John sat on the bed, his bed, and began to unlace his boots.
John leaned forward to Sherlock’s mouth and bit and nipped and licked and moaned into the beautiful cavern that shared Sherlock’s brilliance with the rest of the world. Watson couldn't believe he was the only one his genius deemed worthy of kissing it. John yanked open the drawer to the side table. It only took the click of the cap and Sherlock was propped up on his elbows, watching, recording John as he rubbed the lube between his fingers, warming it before coming into contact with Sherlock’s skin. He knelt again, between those long legs, and ran his tongue against that gorgeous prick as he gently slipped in a solitary finger. Sherlock groaned at the sensation, equal parts discomfort and arousal. John's hand and mouth moved in unison and Sherlock’s breathing pattern spiked. A second finger, and then a third, Sherlock’s cock was hitting the back of John’s throat and Sherlock was quivering and moaning and crying out. John was painfully hard and leaking.
John couldn’t wipe the stupid blush from his face. It was nearly two in the afternoon and he was still in his pyjamas. He could smell Sherlock in his shirt.
“Yes, put yourself to good use. Dishes are in the far right cabinet, above the counter.” The stool whined as John pushed it back and made to set their dishes. After, he joined Sherlock at the stove, wrapping his arms around his waist and nestling his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder.
He smiled as he retrieved his Supras. His sleeveless shirt was waiting somewhere in John’s room, but he couldn’t bring himself to wake him. He stood inside the bedroom, waiting for his eyes to adjust even a miniscule amount so he could make out a mound of fabric lurking on the floor.
He may have interrupted the story - may have cut Sherlock off mid-sentence, and yes, in most circumstances that would be very poor manners at best but it doesn’t matter because Sherlock is a work of art. John will look at him every day and find something new to admire, something new to be moved by, something new to surprise him, frighten him, engulf him, absolutely consume him.
.” The pale, gorgeous topography of Sherlock’s body was pulled taut. John growled deep in his throat at the sight of Sherlock’s face twisted up in pleasure; his eyebrows were pitched high in the middle of his brow, mouth slack and open, and his chest was swelling with his frantic breathing.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stared John down. “Yes. Prepared. With a ring. To propose. Are we actually in the same conversation or…?”
“It’s nothing, really. But I didn’t want you to think I was actually as pathetic as you believe me to be.” Sherlock picked up his nearly empty cup and made for the door, dress shoes crunching on the cement.
“Different man, Jane. Remember that.” He kissed the sliver of skin her v-neck sweater left exposed. “You are going through so many changes. Watching it is incredible. I don’t want to get in the way.”
“Know that you and Callum are my family. My brother and sister; the blood I believe to carry in my veins." A solitary tear ran down John's right cheek. "I would do anything and everything for the pair of you, and know you would do the same, because you already have. I love you both, so very much, and there isn’t another couple on the face of this planet that could outshine you.” John looked out across the room and watched their guests sniffling and wiping their eyes with their napkins. Callum’s mother blew him a discreet kiss. “Please raise your glass in honor of the two best individuals we have ever encountered. To Molly and Callum, and to the eternity that awaits you. I love you.”
The arm they belonged to was long, pale, with gorgeous blue veins surfacing at the soft skin near the palm of his hand.
John took in the pallor of Sherlock’s skin and the way he was folded slightly at his waist. “Follow me.”
“Sherlock,” John murmured. The sweat touched ringlets continued to travel across John’s chest, lips soft and slick on tender skin.
John had chuckled at that, and given Callum a square smack on the ass. John Watson loved rugby, he was one
“So you’ve done it then.” It wasn’t a question, and John felt there was a hint of accusation in the statement. He opened his eyes to find Sherlock leaning against the counter, his legs crossed at the ankles. He was staring at John, eyes unwavering and looking a bit sadder than before.
John was sitting at the bar, downing his fifth pint. A comfortable buzz had settled into his bones. It was Friday night, and the pub was packed with dancing bodies. The lights were low, and he could feel a little bass deep in his chest.
Sherlock broke out in gooseflesh, tears pricking strongly at the corners of his eyes as John took the shampoo in his hands to Sherlock’s scalp, rubbing his fingers in tiny circles until the lather was running down Sherlock’s back. He pulled John’s chin up and kissed him hard.
“Hello. I’m Captain Watson. I’ve taken over this shift. I’m just going to check your vitals and let you continue resting.”
“You’re up early.” It came between huge huffs of air, that gorgeous voice of his. It still seemed a bit touched by sleep.
“John, are you alright? Do you need to sit down? Water? Pain reliever? What is it?” Sherlock’s face was precious – tired, concerned and his brows were furrowed with worry. John chuckled.
John was breathtaking. Sherlock felt a strange ache in his chest just from watching him sleep. It was an overcast day; the greys and blues leaking through the glass panels of the window toned John back; he had less of a glow and Sherlock was appreciative of this. His skin tinted cool made him seem more human, more attainable, more worthy of Sherlock’s touch, though that much was certainly still up for debate. Sherlock hardly believed himself to be worthy of a man of John’s character. He was curled up around the empty space that had housed Sherlock’s body. Thoughts of the previous night filled his vision.
John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s thigh, steadying his breathing. He giggled after a moment, realizing the absolute absurdity of the situation. He looked up at Sherlock from his knees. The brunette’s eyes were glinting deviantly, the right side of his mouth pulled up at the corner.
More to come... For all my amazing readers, thank you for staying kind and staying positive. So much has happened in the course of a year, I'm better for it, but I think it's time we return to our boys. Don't you?
“He covered dinner. And opened the car door for me. And paid for my ticket. And bought me a large popcorn though I only wanted a medium. He also got me toffee apple stickers, which are my favorite. I don’t know if I’d mentioned that to him or not. And he’s so funny, John. Clever. Ian took movies so seriously; I could never ask him anything in the midst of one or he would get frustrated and mouthy.”
Callum was practically trembling at the top of the aisle. He was chomping at the bit, rabid to lay eyes on his stunning bride. He was even more eager to slip that tiny symbol of eternity over her gorgeous ring finger, peppered with the tiniest scars.
Sherlock found Molly and Soo Lin in the break room. Even as they nibbled over the last bits of a late breakfast, they sat discussing choreography. He smiled as he opened the door to the refrigerator and pulled out the remnants of his morning smoothie. He leaned against the counter, swirling the contents of his drink inside its cup.
He slid his thumb underneath the seal of the white paper and pulled out a single sheet of stationery. The scrawl was nearly illegible, gorgeous, and totally unfamiliar.
John took a sip of the steaming beverage. He felt the heat slide down his throat and break up the frozen knots in his stomach. He sighed quietly, leaned his head back and closed his eyes.
“I’m proud of you,” Jane said softly. The taunt had left her voice. John glanced up at her. Her face was gentle.
John sipped his eggnog in front of the warm fire heating up 221b. He was curled up next to Sherlock on the sofa.
Jane turned and floated into the living room. She stood in front of the shelves of DVDs; something B noticed she did a lot. “Your collection is so different than mine. And larger, too.”
John nodded, beaming from below. Sherlock turned back into himself for a while longer, relishing in the quiet and the captain’s stabilizing presence. They hardly knew one another. Perhaps eight days? And John Watson was already acknowledging character traits, and apparently flaws, of his. That puzzled him. No one was ever quite close or observant enough to draw conclusions about Sherlock, and certainly unable to speak of his habits or frequent behaviors. Sherlock didn’t have friends, and he certainly had not intended to start anytime soon.
Sherlock was trying to talk himself out of the absurd physical impulses he was experiencing. One was particularly bothersome, as it wouldn’t go away: he desperately wanted to crawl into John’s lap, right there in the back of the cab, and grind against those perfect hips. Sherlock moved his eyes up to John’s face; he was staring out the window, licking his lips.
“I apologize for my comments earlier. What I said was childish and selfish, and you did not deserve it.” John’s eyes widened as he laughed. Sherlock was taken aback by two things: one, that he apologized. Two, that John Watson was laughing at his apology.
Sherlock wriggled up in bed and tugged the chain to the lamp. John hissed and covered his eyes. “Sorry,” Sherlock mumbled. John blinked, smiled, and rested his hands in his lap. “Let’s go with the obvious first. Queen and Country?”
“Molly, hi. Yes! I have a proposal for you. You most certainly do not have to agree, but I think you might be interested.”
Sherlock turned his face away. The brakes of the train squealed to a halt. John witnessed one, solitary tear fall to Sherlock’s cheek. Acting on instinct, he took his thumb and gently wiped it away. He then tucked two wild curls behind Sherlock’s ear. It felt like home, to touch him. “Sentiment. It’s a bitch, isn’t it?”
He knew Sherlock would not write to him again. He also didn’t give a fuck. That bastard destroyed everything and walked away from it. He didn’t give John a chance to validate and explain what he was actually intending to do that night. If the fucking egotistical prick had waited, he would have known John had held a tiny black box in his pocket.
“Oh… John…” In one swift movement, Sherlock pulled John onto his lap, his large hands gripping into the doctor's hips. “Your feelings are reciprocated.” John reached over, pulled the chain to the lamp, and then he took Sherlock to bed.
“That would appear to be the case, seeing as I can’t seem to keep my hands, eyes, thoughts off you.” John wanted to move past this point, as he had decided to do two days prior, and accept that for whatever reason, yes, Sherlock Holmes was a fantastic, gorgeous, perfect, brilliant exception. Sherlock pushed off the wall, now standing over John, and wrapped his hands around the captain’s waist. He kissed John’s hair, his temple, his brows, lids, nose and cheek. His words ghosted across John’s skin:
John’s skin crawled at the sound. How could he be alive? How could he be hearing this man speak? He hated his mind, hated whatever sick game this was. Wake up, John. Please, god, wake up. This can’t be real. He isn’t here. You are dead in the fucking desert, you moronic twat.
John was twisting the deadbolt of his door when he caught sight of the white tip of an envelope in his letterbox. He plucked it up and turned it over in his hands.
John returned with an equal ferocity. The heat of the water had started to wane, and John tilted Sherlock’s chin back, delicately tracing the lines of Sherlock’s veins and arteries in his neck as he rinsed the soap out of his hair. The tap was cut off, and they took flannels to their hair. John smiled at the wet strands plastered to Sherlock’s forehead, the rest mussed and disheveled. He kissed the smirk off Sherlock’s face.
"'Fraid that one is pretty obvious," he chuckled, "I love England." Sherlock nodded curtly, his lips drawn in a mildly disapproving sneer. "What's that face, then?" John huffed.
John chuckled. “Your piece this afternoon was stunning. It was so beautifully Molly. It was brilliant. Thank you.”
Sherlock picked up his mug and habitually raised his eyebrow. “Yes, well. Don’t get used to it.” And with that, Sherlock walked into the living room, plopped into his gray, leather chair and turned on the telly.
. He looked up to find two parecetamol and a glass of water sitting on the bedside table. John stood, not trusting the medication as he knew he had been far too gone to even consider doing such a thing, and wobbled to the door.
“Shower. Now,” he growled into her ear. She needn’t be told twice. He gave her arse a hard spank as she made her way to the bathroom, peeling her clothes off layer by layer and dropping them to the floor. They lay forgotten as steam filled the room.
The match was on the telly. About a third of the team sat in various places in John’s living room. “Alright, boys. I’ve got Imperial Stout, Guinness, Jameson, and the means to make hot toddies. Pick your poison.”
The disc jockey came on over the microphone, one headphone pushed back behind his ear. Molly and Callum stood and walked to the center of the floor, where a large space had been left so others could dance. A bright song began to pour the speakers. It reminded John of Christmas and laughter and the smell of chai tea. Everyone began to clap in unison, and Callum grasped Molly’s hand.
“I missed you. It’s only been two days. I had to ask Jane what to wear. What do you make of that?” John murmured through a smile pressing against Sherlock’s mouth. He planted another small kiss on the lush cupid’s bow. Sherlock chuckled; it was a deep, warm sound in his chest.
John set the mugs on the coffee table, sure to find coasters first. Sherlock’s flat was impeccably clean; it wasn’t that he believed Sherlock to be a mess, but he certainly pictured Sherlock to be comfortable. It was stunning – all white and glass and shelves and boxes, but it felt sterile. The sofa was comfortable, at least, and he was keeping company with one of the most intriguing men in London. That was really all he needed.
John brought the last image to the front of the stack and a small hum left his throat. John was standing on the platform, likely on the last day of one of Sherlock’s visits. His back was facing the camera, his face turned to the right, eyes hunting through the crowd. In the background, a train had come whirring into the station, blurring defiantly when asked to sit still for a photograph. John’s eyebrows were knit together up high on his forehead in a look of worry and dismay.
“You’re the only one that thinks so,” Callum quipped. John gave him a playful shove where he sat on the floor next to him.
“Mols. You look amazing.” She blushed at that. “I have something for you. I thought it might, I dunno, calm your nerves.” He extended the envelope to her, and then wrapped his arms tightly around Molly. As he kissed her cheek, he whispered, “This is better than winning the International Cup. Straight from his mouth. As he was in tears.”
“What is it, sweetheart?” Though he was truly filthy, she caressed his sweat stained cheek, brown eyes huge on her face.
"Has she done all your ink?" He glanced back at the right sleeve in a newfound admiration. He had thought they had been an assortment of artists, each tattoo requiring a different skill set.
“Alright, Mr. Holmes, you seem to be doing just fine. A delayed reaction time, but that’s to be expected with the morphine.” Sherlock chuckled. He knew Doctor Watson had looked over his record. What a precious man, to feign naivety at his last ten hospital visits scrawled in nearly illegible handwriting on the dust covered folder. Even when you worked for the government, for SAS, for your literal big brother, damn Mycroft, that indulgent prick, some things never change. “Is there anything I can get you?”
“221b Baker Street. It has a nice ring to it.” It was the first time John had spoken since boarding his plane.
environment, familiar with where everything was, watching him slice the basil and make his measurements without a single proper unit of measurement. Ambient jazz was playing from the den and John felt completely at ease.
“No, Doctor Watson, I most certainly am not. Although I believe that is an easy conclusion for anyone to draw about me.”
John chuckled in response, and leaned around to give Jane a thumbs up behind Callum’s back. She smiled, and turned her attention toward the cabin doors. Callum only saw a glimpse of white through the now-standing bodies. His heart lurched in his chest as Molly and her father broke free of the people impairing his vision. The violin matched the stammer of his heart and reminded him to breathe. How had Sherlock anticipated his feelings at this very moment?
The violin. Oh god, that beautiful instrument. Sherlock and strings were a combination that could birth an entirely new galaxy. John laced his hands behind his head and leaned back into his pillow, wallowing in the sound and waves of nostalgia.
There was a soft knock on John’s door. He had insisted Sherlock just keep the spare, but being the gentleman he was, Sherlock had politely refused. John’s breath caught in his chest as Sherlock stepped inside the foyer. His mouth pulled into a small smile. John was still waiting for the day his heart would get used to the elegant sod standing in front of him.
“Are you just going to stand back there or?” He would rather have him where he could see him, if he insisted on staying and ruining his perfectly nice night. The sound of sand against boots grew closer and soon Watson was standing right next to Sherlock, less than an arm’s length away. Sherlock turned his head only enough to see John Watson in his peripheral vision. His posture was straight as an arrow; he was stocky and strong and looked different in this light. Sherlock turned to observe John thoroughly. Softer. Handsome, even. His eyes were fearfully expressive, his mouth was an easy tell as well. It was turned up at the right corner in a small smile. His brows were relaxed, eyes wide and alert. He always seemed on. It was three in the damned morning. Most soldiers are savoring every second of sleep before that god awful, spine splitting morning call came at 0430.
“Don’t apologize for caring about me, Sherlock. I’m sorry I twisted that up and made it seem nasty. It isn’t. It wasn’t.” John’s hand was now out and around Sherlock’s shoulder, carding through his hair. Quiet found them; it didn’t press this time. It was gentle and welcome. Sherlock let his fingers trail along John’s elbow, the pale light falling in stripes across his shirtsleeve.
“Make me a stronger drink?” Callum offered. Molly turned to look at him, and he wilted under her eyes.
John knew that Jane Jesep was a woman that loved her job more than anything else in her life. The kids in this room, whether they were aware of it or not, were her number one priority, most days slotting even above her own needs. There had been several late evening conversations about a particularly infuriating situation at school, or nights Jane wouldn’t leave the building until well after seven. She never complained of it; she never seemed as though she would rather be doing something else. Jane was absolutely certain she had the best career in existence, and no one could tell her otherwise. As John watched her with her kids, he put her on the same level as Sherlock and himself – they eat, sleep, and breathe it, would inject it intravenously if it were possible, and even during the off-season, it was still all-consuming, in the most beautiful way.
The beeping of life machines was a sick addition. John was dead and didn’t need God’s morbid sense of humor trying to convince him otherwise.
“Do you have to word it in a way that makes me feel like an absolute imbecile? And easy, I’m not bothersome every week. Just… most weeks.”
John ran his hands through his sandy hair. It was getting too long. It was incredible how much hotter an extra inch of hair can make a man in a desert. He laced his boots, checked that all his patches were in place, and then made his way to the barracks to perform a routine check. He lingered in the doorway as the soldiers stood at attention. He paced the length of the room. “At ease.” His squadron fell to parade rest. Captain John Watson. Since when had he become a leader? A peacekeeper worth fearing?
Sherlock pinpointed Cassiopeia. He never indulged in nostalgia or silly things, like stories about constellations. But Cassiopeia was a soft spot for him. He had discovered it with Redbeard, during a summer at the country estate. The wind rustled again and picked the damp curls off his neck.
“Mr. Holmes?” Sherlock blinked, once, twice, then turned back to the counter. He handed Prim his check card and snagged his dinner.
She tried desperately to find Sherlock’s eyes, to reassure him he most certainly could do exactly as he pleased. However, she knew him to be a cautious and courteous man. He wanted John to handle this situation as he deemed fit, and until he got the go ahead, Sherlock would stand by, a guardian.
John tossed and turned in Sherlock’s bed. It felt huge and empty with only one body in it; John didn’t blame Sherlock for sleeping in his smaller bed. At least there the feeling of solitude was less… overwhelming.
Sherlock tucked the blankets around John. He lay sleeping in the middle of the bed. Sherlock perched on the window sill, drawing his knees up to his chest. The weather was finally growing warmer, and summer nights would be here in a few short months. A breeze swept in around his ankles. John stirred, and tucked his chin farther into his elbow.
Sherlock’s ears perked at the tone of his voice. Genuine concern. Pathetic. Was this guy new? Did he not understand standard procedure of reading up? Surely, if he did, he would know his patient is a coked out sociopath: unpleasant, untamed, and unrelenting. The agent looked into the doctor’s eyes, doing his best to destroy him, deduction by deduction. It worked every single time. All he needed was one, tiny character trait to pull, and he could unravel him. He could reduce Captain Watson to a trembling pile of fury and hatred. Now, where to start.
“Think, John. What else happened almost one year ago, exactly?” Sherlock hiked his eyebrows on his forehead, as if he were giving Watson a hint.
John sat silently, chewing Sherlock’s words. How was it that this man could make him feel bitter and heavenly simultaneously? It was certainly a skill he had never encountered elsewhere. John knew Afghanistan had made him harder; he couldn’t change that. He was desperately trying to come around and melt a bit, to chip off the icy blocks from his shoulders. By the time he was loose again, they would send him back to hell. On the other hand… Sherlock seemed intrigued, possibly even flustered, by some of John’s newer developments. He was sexier. Sherlock had said that. John felt wet warmth on his throat, then teeth and tongue, playfully nipping at his neck. His lower lip was grazing slowly across John’s pulsing veins. Jesus fucking Christ. An aroused Holmes would kill him before Afghanistan did.
Callum Everett poked out his bottom lip in a pout. “Come on, John. Don’t make me go alone. There will be men in tights, for chrissake.”
He just nodded, unable to bring himself to turn around and put those pale eyes to a gorgeous voice. He would be sick if it was who he believed it to be. But then again, why wouldn’t it be? Jane looked from him to the source of sound, and then back. Her eyes widened a fractional amount. “OH.”
Callum put his finger to his mouth and made a gagging sound. John smacked him hard on the shoulder, and his friend chuckled.
"I've discovered I'm a huge fan of text tattoos. I didn't want them all to look the same, so I had to get crafty eventually. That one's fairly new. The final piece to the sleeve."
“I think we look incredible together,” John attempted, his voice barely audible. He looked back at the photo, and decided to do a very twenty-two year old thing: he set the photograph as his home screen. Sherlock kissed his temple at that, and then his mouth was moving down his ear, to his neck, soft lips against salty skin.
How? How could this man sing and yell and destroy and build and narrate the most stunning things John had ever thought to think, without ever saying a word, without ever pausing or stopping or resting or hell, maybe he wasn’t even breathing? All John knew was that this sight was ripping his heart out of his chest and wrapping it in warmth and everything perfectly lovely. He was perfectly lovely. Inhuman was by far the most inaccurate description of Sherlock Holmes he had ever heard.
They were wrapped up under the covers, bundled tightly together. John was giggling profusely at Sherlock attempting to impersonate Anderson. They had consumed three drinks too many. Their bodies were warm and fizzy on the inside.
.” The detective wrapped his hands around John’s back and gave each ass cheek a firm squeeze, pulling John’s hips deeper and harder into his. He clearly responded well to John’s foul mouth. Their breathing was ragged; the force of their grinding hips was absorbed by the mattress underneath them. Sherlock asked in broken bits and pieces, “Are you my commander?”
Jane walked slowly back into her classroom, her administrator trailing behind her. They both sipped on their tea. “Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I don’t think that will be necessary.” They lingered in the middle of her room, the smell of earl grey blending in with traces of bleach.
John’s teeth broke through the close-mouthed smirk, and he winked. “Sherlock. Glad to see me, are we?”
Sherlock leapt onto the stage, tossing in his slippers, towel, water bottle and pulling out a pair of sweatpants and a hooded sweatshirt. He zipped the bag up and slung it over his shoulder.
Determining this, Sherlock took the last sip of his tea before standing and gathering his things. He wrapped his scarf around his neck and laced up his trainers.
Jane snagged the ruler from the middle table and handed it to Kirsten. John watched her as she walked around the room, speaking to each student as she went, tapping a few on their shoulders and working to redirect them to the task at hand.
“Are you going to wrap them or not?” He had tried his best to let his bite back in, but it was a feeble attempt. John’s eyes found his. Sherlock felt his heart clench at his expression.
“Okay, sweethearts, three minutes until the bell. Make sure you submit your work into the third period box before you leave. Don’t leave a mess on my table or you
Surely this punishment had carried on long enough. Sherlock had been waiting to hear from Mycroft for well over a week now. It was getting a bit redundant and had lost its charm. Had it ever had any charm?
He loved that Sherlock spoke twice as fast when he was excited, the way his eyebrows launched upwards on his face and his voice changed when he tried to recreate a pompous big brother, the large, sweeping hand gestures as he finally reached the climax of the story, and his chuckle at the recollection of it all. Sherlock was an artist. He was in the traditional definition, of course, being involved in many areas of creation. But his very existence called for one to reassess how they approach each oncoming day.  At the core of his being, Sherlock’s life was a work of art. His character, his demeanor, his love and play of language and his careful interactions with everything and everyone that surrounded him opened him up for interpretation by any and all. He chose every day to be a man in search of more, never settling or succumbing to the expectations of those that believe their opinion to be of the utmost importance. He bravely faced each challenge as though he were attempting to find multiple solutions for a rather involved problem -- he experimented with vernacular, with sound, with strings and sweats and stargazing; he believed everything could be seen in a new light and could offer more than its made-purpose intended.
John heard the violin. He closed his eyes and laughed softly. The first few notes rang true and familiar: Shine, by Collective Soul. This was the first of a million times he would cry today. He was certain. He lifted his lids to the sound of creaking doors and gasped at the sight.
Sherlock stared, dumbfounded, and then made his way to the top step. He didn’t step inside the door; any closer proximity and he’d devour John alive. The rugby captain was dressed in his university best: Sherlock’s mouth parched at the sight of black denim clinging to John’s gorgeous thighs and skimming down to fit snugly about his ankles. His feet were covered in a pair of worn, ratty, and faded pair of orange Chuck Taylors. John wore a faded, gray, years-old Incubus t-shirt, highlighting the taut muscle of his chest and biceps, and over the t-shirt was a long sleeved, pine green and black flannel, sleeves gloriously cuffed to reveal the blue and red of his Union Jack. His hair was mussed, sticking this way and that in perfect dishevelment. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to thread his hands through those blonde strands and give a firm tug. John’s blue eyes were just as analytical, and Sherlock bit his tongue to keep from grinning as he watched John’s own eyes dilate.
“You’ve hardly had to do any of it. And I’m not blaming you or being resentful of that, but honestly. If anyone hates doing it, it’s me. So stop complaining.” John and Jane glanced at each other, trying to feel out what the best move would be.
Sherlock leaned against the counter and watched John. They had been staying with one another nearly every night since the Underground. Before this freakish incident,
John raised his hand and grinned. “Really. I said I’d come, I want to come, so if you don’t mind a third wheel, I believe I’m seeing a ballet for the first time tonight.”
“It’s for you, you idiotic cock. Or it was, it was meant for you. That Christmas. Before you mucked everything up.” He wiped away the tears from the corner of his eyes and looked back at Sherlock. “I was going to propose to you, before you went off on me like that.”
They had turned all the other lights off in the flat, relishing in the light pouring from the fire. It made Sherlock’s eyes a little wider, the hollows of his cheeks a bit more defined, the softness of his lips more desirable than ever. How he would return to a cot, sleeping apart from this divine human, he did not know. He pushed the thought out of his mind. No, not tonight. Tonight was perfect. Warm and kind and gentle.
“Do you have to word it in a way that makes me feel like an absolute imbecile? And easy, I’m not bothersome every week. Just… most weeks.”
He reached for the envelope and opened it carefully, savoring the wrinkle and cracking of the paper coming unglued. Inside, nine sheets of paper were folded and tucked away. He pulled them out one by one:
Sherlock stared at the ceiling, tapping his thumbs gently together. His initial thought was of the rapid escalation that had shattered his composure into a tiny, million fragments. John Watson was first and foremost on his mind, and Holmes could already feel the man leaking into more than one location in his mind palace. He sighed, frustrated, and decided to pace instead.
“Understandable. You should rest.” And with that, he returned to his post by the tent. Sherlock gave a final wiggle of his toes in the sand before working his way back to his cot. He rolled over and fell asleep covered in the shadow of the Captain outside.
“Perhaps I do, Jane. Would that offend you?” John turned to glance at her over his shoulder and winked. He absentmindedly stirred the sauce on the stove as he toed open the refrigerator.
Watson winked and dropped to his knees on the sidewalk. For a moment, Sherlock was certain he had forgotten what breathing was. Breathing is boring. His heart flinched deeply in his ribcage. Sherlock watched as he stretched out parallel to the ground and began a series of pushups.
Sherlock hung his head and squeezed the bridge of his nose. “Christ, John. I’m not being a prat.” John sat seething. Sherlock’s icy eyes found John’s deep ocean blues. John was taken aback by the expression on Sherlock’s face: it was one of pity, and fear, and god forbid, affection? Compassion? No. It could not be. “You are a fine man, John. Bright, kind, clever occasionally. You have put yourself through medical school, which is an accomplishment to take great pride in…”
“Yes, well, I feel as though you’ve begun to make an experiment of it.” Sherlock jested, voice full of fondness. John could do anything he wanted, Sherlock was sure, and he would be perfectly content with it.
going to say you are breathtaking. Before you interrupted me.” He winked and Jane gave his hand a squeeze.
Sherlock unfolded himself from the couch and led John by the hand to his room. The door shut and they were shimmying under the covers together. Watson felt warm all over, like sitting by a fire after a cold walk from the tube. He felt Sherlock fold himself around him. His hand fell cautiously across John’s hip. The doctor smiled, knowing Sherlock had remembered the six inch slice he had earned rested on that side of his ribs. He never forgot anything.
He wandered back into the sitting room and sat cross legged in front of John. Sherlock noted the amount of water left in the glass; John had already taken a few sips. He tenderly pulled a sock off John’s foot began to rub his thumbs into the arch. He applied pressure to the icy extremity in an attempt to get his blood circulating properly again. John mumbled incoherently, his head falling back to rest against the back of the chair. That was a good sign. Sherlock removed the other sock, gave his left foot a quick rub, and then took the glass and placed it on the coffee table. He crawled up onto his knees between John’s thighs and caressed his kneecaps gently with his thumbs.
“Don’t fret, John. It works. And you look… Incredible.” Sherlock opened the door and clutched John’s wrist, pulling him out of the flat and snatching his coat en route. John locked up and turned to face the street, wordless.
The man leaned close to Sherlock’s ear and began to whisper something into it, making Sherlock grin and duck his chin closer to his chest. John clenched and unclenched his left fist, prepared for the left hook, should the opportunity arise. They were on a case, after all, John justified.
“Bandages? Wounds? Battle scars?” John laughed at Sherlock’s attempt to cover the look of mild disgust on his face. “No, I’ll be fine. It amuses me… you solve murders and examine and sometimes wreak havoc on dead bodies. But your stomach turns at the thought of changing used bandages. Is it because I’m still alive?” Of course, John had been teasing, but Sherlock stared at him, intense and unwavering. John felt a bit shy under this line of vision, and began to fidget.
It was damp and cold. Wind pushed through the broken panels of glass and brick, whistling and stirring rubbish across the floor. It felt like ages before John found Harry’s shoes with the flashlight. She was lying limp in the corner, wearing nothing but a tank top and jeans. “For fuck’s sake…” John lifted her face and her lips were too cool. Her color was off, her skin clammy to the touch. John took her pulse; it was running rampant. Watson tried to take a few steadying breaths to hold himself together, but it was proving to be difficult. Tears blurred his vision.
Rhys would stag his way through the entire break, likely bringing home a different girl every night; Jasper said he had a few guitar gigs lined up at the local pubs. Most everyone had plans. Naturally, John had none. He had debated calling Katherine, but knew it would take too much work to salvage the barely-there relationship that had existed anyway, and he didn’t even want that. He was propped up on the sofa, popcorn on one side, whiskey in the other, watching the sixth season of Doctor Who when his mobile chimed.
Sherlock felt like a god. Did John Watson make all his prey feel this way? Holmes wondered how the captain feasted. Would he sink his teeth deep into the unseen skin of Sherlock’s thigh? Would he growl as he came down Sherlock’s throat? Was he a rough lover, all fire and heat and urgency? Did he mark first? Would Sherlock’s skin welt and bruise under John Watson’s touch? The detective certainly hoped so. He shed his trousers and pants to the floor in one fell swoop. He tackled the last few buttons and tossed his shirt aside. The detective crawled onto the bed and stood up on his knees, presenting himself.
“I’m ready for a proper fucking shower, and to skip the mummy wrappings every day, but all things considered, I’m fine.” He knew it wasn’t what the captain had wished for, but Sherlock felt confident that John expected nothing in return. He was asking to ask, and offering help when he could give it.
“Once a week he came here, gave me an update on how you were doing. Told me how conditions near your base were, how they were expected to shift, whether or not it was a risk night for you. I feigned disinterest, but I spent the entire week waiting to hear how you were…”
Soo Lin stood and exited the room, gifting Sherlock a sweet grin on the way out. Molly gathered up the papers from the table and turned in her chair to face Sherlock. “How are you?” she asked timidly. She fidgeted with her tights, picking at the runs and fuzzes.
“I remember you talking about what beverages you consumed at Stamford’s last house party, and that you had taken a particular liking to this one.”
” His knees were hardly serving any purpose anymore. “I know you’re pining for me, Mr. Holmes. Know you’ve thought about the way I look at you, the things I notice, the way I touch you.”
“Yes, of course. I can always have tea. Thank you.” John plopped heavily onto the sofa and kicked off his trainers. As he was adjusting the pillow behind his neck, he glanced up and saw Sherlock standing next to him, with a mug in his hand. He had no shirt on and the sharp contrast between the deep navy of the dressing gown and the alabaster tint of his skin was distracting. John reached for the cup, breaking his eyes away from Sherlock’s abdomen, and whispered a thank you. Sherlock stood there a few moments more, his hands empty. John searched the icy eyes and concluded the detective looked puzzled, possibly intrigued. Then they went blank, and he turned to retrieve his own mug from the kitchen.
The brunette’s eyes grew wide, his mouth popping open in fear. John cackled aloud before responding. “Yes, alright, alright. Leave me alone to it, fine.” He kissed the man on the forehead before disappearing into the bedroom.
. He pressed the palm of his hand firmly to the scar on his left shoulder. It had been giving him more trouble than usual this week, but John was used to it. It always ached when he was in a bad place.
The bags were dropped onto the kitchen table. A click of vials was soon followed by a rolling and a shatter of glass against ceramic tile. John peeked over the top of the newsprint to see Sherlock absolutely seething, fists clenched into pale, blotched balls and shoulders drawn up tight against his neck. He couldn't help it: a chuckle slipped out.
There was a knock at the door and John opened it, lazy grin spreading across his face at the sight of two of his favorite people.
“Brilliant..." John breathed. "Right. Yes. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll let you return to your vent session. Enjoy your evening.” John stepped outside into the hall and made his way for the doors to the building.
Practice came back full force. The boys were well rested and eager for their last match of the season, even though they knew their captain would work them literally to the bone. Jasper was healing from John’s sprints, Egan and Rhys feeling the wrath as they fell into scrums with the ruthless blonde, and Callum just trying to keep stride with John’s pace. B and Wesley spent two extra hours in the weight room each day in an attempt to add on just a little extra bulk, if at all possible.
John felt his breath catch in his chest at the proximity of Sherlock’s waist to his own. Instantly, his cheeks heated. He looked incredible tonight; he wore a pale green button up under a black suit, topped with a deep pine colored tie, now drunkenly loosened. It did amazing things to his earth flecked irises.
He had planned to rehearse at Marylebone early in the day, staying as late as he deemed necessary in order to accomplish the desired results. However, knowing John’s attendance was now to be accounted for, he felt an odd need to begin later and stay later. Part of him feared that John would decide it was a trivial idea, coming to watch a single man, one he hardly knows, dance for hours on end; how could that possibly serve as an entertaining activity for an ordinary individual? Sherlock shook his head, growling in frustration. He was overthinking this entire situation, he knew. John wouldn’t come if he did not wish to.
The apartment was frigid. Sherlock gathered if it had been ten degrees cooler and the humidity level higher, he would be able to see his own breath. He stopped at the thermostat in the hall and bumped it up.
He curled up against Sherlock’s back. Once he was comfortable, he stilled, hesitating. With the back of his knuckles, he traced Sherlock’s spine, down and then up, only once. He planted the smallest kiss between the man’s shoulder blades, and then his head found his pillow.
Sherlock laughed. It started as a deep chuckle and exited in a resonant baritone, bouncing off everything in the room.
John saw the sun sneaking up to the horizon. It was finally dawn. He lifted his fingers to wipe away the wetness from his eyes. Emotions at night were one thing: others couldn’t see you. But Soldier John had to come back with the sunrise. It was part of the job description.
John took the glasses into the kitchen to refill them, and plucked two fortune cookies from the bag. He grinned at the mini desserts in his palm. He handed Sherlock a cookie and watched as he absent mindedly unwrapped it.
“I would surely hope you’d invite me in after driving me all this way.” He gave Sherlock a firm pat on the arse as if to shoo him along. “Go on, then. After you.” John snagged the bags and followed Sherlock through the front door.
John scrubbed his hand over his face and sighed. His eyes had taken on a steely grey. "Yeah. Yes. Harriet."
John’s face creased in confusion. His eyes shifted back and forth, trying to sort out Sherlock’s words. Sherlock smiled as he saw the light appear in John’s eyes. “Are we… are you on a case?”
“Molly told me you compose all the music. Is that true?” Sherlock nodded, now too far invested in the silence to shift out of it now.
He may have interrupted the remainder of a lovely narrative - may have cut Sherlock off mid-sentence, and yes, in most circumstances that would be very poor manners indeed, but it didn’t matter because Sherlock is a work of art. From the way his eyes crease when he is searching for the perfect word, the way he moves his spoon when dissolving the sugar in his tea, how even his enormous hands could relay he was pondering on something under the surface... John will look at him every day and find something new to admire, something new to be astounded by, something new to surprise him, frighten him, engulf him.
Sherlock now felt an overwhelming need to violate the doctor’s space, just to see the reaction. He refrained from brushing against him. At least, until they reached the room at the end of the hall. Watson opened the door and Sherlock grazed his free arm across the captain’s hip as he entered the room. He dropped his bag to the floor and turned to face John. Ten percent eye dilation. He stepped close and spoke quietly to him. “Thank you, John. Sorry for my sour mood today, although, you are quite clever enough to have already deduced its cause.” He carefully tucked a strand of lengthening blonde hair behind Watson’s right ear. The doctor shivered. Self-control easily noticeable – knuckles are white from gripping, muscles of the thighs tensed, face fixed. Eyes now dilated fifty-two percent. “Might be time for another haircut, don’t you think?”
Sherlock ditched the blanket, prowled across the lot and met John's eyes with insane ferocity. Watson felt as though he were being hunted. Sherlock grabbed John’s face in his hands and kissed him, in the middle of the street, in front of
The DJ booth was massive, long and placed straddling a corner of two metal walls. A dark-skinned man with dreads was spinning behind it, one ear free of the huge headphones. His ears were gauged, a tattoo of a Vulcan greeting barely visible against the dark skin of his neck. Yes, this place was going to be just fine. The DJ spun, and the song changed. To his left, John saw three women walk into the center of a ring of people. They all looked to be early to mid-twenties, and they stood in a straight line. One of them, with long blonde curls and a young face, gave a flirtatious wiggle of her fingers to someone in their direction. John glanced around, eager to see the receiver, and chuckled to see Sherlock returning the gesture. Sherlock gave her a two fingered salute.  A brunette next to her, knitted hat pulled over her brown, frizzing waves, shot Sherlock a bird, and smiled, her tongue caught between her teeth. Their center member, dreaded and natural faced, silver hoop in her nose gleaming with each rotation of the lights, took a step forward.
“Yeah. They haven’t been edited or read over. I did it for fun, during off season. Used to keep me sharp.”
“Yeah, B. That’d be fantastic. Thank you.” The boys began to settle, on barstools, against the kitchen wall, on the sofa. Rhys pulled himself up on the kitchen counter. They all sipped their beverage and looked on at John with kind eyes.
Four blades? Why did it matter? Which BRAND of four blade razors was he supposed to get? Gillette? Was the pivot action really
“Listen, I know you probably have something planned for this evening, but, well. If you don’t…” Sherlock watched as John straightened his shoulders and laughed inwardly as he
The girls then fell into a v shaped alignment, and Sherlock tugged John forward, breaking through the crowd until they were making a place for themselves in the ring that surrounded the dancers. John crossed his arms and watched, as each girl stepped forward, right knees bent at a ninety degree angle, in perfect unison with the first drop of an electric beat. Their hips slung side to side with intention, locking solid with each repetition of the cymbal in the song. The forward-most girl dropped suddenly into low side-lunge, left knee bent impossibly, right leg out and straight. The girls were then horizontal with the floor, legs, knees, and hips rolling against the concrete, but never touching. The blonde grinned as she moved, face laid open. It was obvious she enjoyed what she did, and her partners danced with the same ferocity. Their hair whipped like an extension of their bodies, sharp sprays of brown, blonde and red. John turned to Sherlock, watching as Sherlock looked on with his head tilted, hand resting under his chin, his elbow finding leverage against his chest. He was smirking, one eyebrow raised. He knew them.
“John, don’t pay me such an empty and useless compliment. You know perfection is an ideal created by the absurd and unfair expec—“
The musician turned and faced John, taking his violin from his shoulder and setting it on its stand. He strolled up to John (God, wasn’t he a sight in motion? Like darkness itself...) and extended a hand. John unfolded his arms from his chest and met him with a firm grip. His handshake was strong: a pleasant surprise.
Tears stung his eyes. John didn’t know how his tear ducts still functioned. He had cried more than humanly possible the last three months. “Sherlock, there’s something I need to tell you.”
“There is so much more to you than the first deduction, John. I’d like to see it all, if you’ll allow it.”
Watson’s breathing went wonky. Sherlock’s eyes widened. He had only said his name. John’s reaction made no sense. He had said his name a hundred times, possibly thousands. Something about understanding the context of the single syllable coming from his lips changed the meaning of it entirely. Fascinating. It was the knee and the forthcoming conversation that made it exceptional.
The bag hit the metal in the bed of the Humvee. He went to grab the door when he realized it was already open. John stood there; face as emotionless as he could muster. A smile was quivering at the corner of his lips, begging to be seen. “I’m not a fucking child, Doctor Watson. Afraid I’ll rip up all your hard work opening a goddamn door?”
John, clutching Sherlock by the shoulders, transferred a hand to the back of the dancer’s neck, drawing him closer. “Sherlock, this is all well and wonderful, but I’d bite your arm off to get a taste of you.” He traced Sherlock’s clavicle with his tongue, ghosted the smallest kisses across his neck, nibbled at the base of his throat. Sherlock pressed his palm to John’s chest, pushing him back into the billowing duvet of the bed. Hips still aligned, he gathered the hooker’s hands up above his head, pinning them to the sheets. With that, he licked the inside of John’s mouth, breathed warm exaltations in his ear, caressed John’s nipples, already raised and tight, between his surprisingly warm fingers, bit at the skin of his ribcage, and dragged his hips down John’s solid thighs, extracting a wicked sound from John’s throat. Then Sherlock followed the curvature of John’s biceps with his tongue, bit at the skin of his right shoulder until John bucked his hips, and traveled across his chest to the firework on his left, scar tissue splayed out in tendrils, shiny, silky, and pink. He kissed the point of entry tenderly, caressing John’s side with light, delicate fingers. John’s fingers tangled into the brunette mop of hair hovering above his chest.
The song changed. It was one of John’s favorites, a beautiful, acoustic version of a popular radio hit.
The taxi ride back to 221b was a blur. John only vividly remembered Sherlock sliding his hand from John’s knee to the inside of his thigh, and then the detective’s mouth was on John’s neck, breathless, frantic and hungry. Watson was torn between utter humiliation, that poor cabbie, and dangerous arousal. He decided on the latter.
John sipped again as he waited for a response. He glanced up at the telly to see Amy clutching a dissolving baby wrapped in a white cloth. Rory stood gaping next to her.
Time passed, but the door finally opened. John knew only one man came to check on him at this time of night. He sat as still as he could. The filthy being approached, his eyes were dark and empty, and leaned close to John, running his fingers carefully down his back. He began to whisper in John’s ear; John never understood what he said, but this was the seventh evening this man had come to him and had John in some way or another. Watson focused on his breathing, trying not to react to the external stimuli. The fingers slipped under the waistband of John’s tattered pants, his hot, wretched breath poisoning his skin. John fought back the strong instinct to wretch. Finally, the opportunity arose. The man’s hand was reaching for John’s chin, to tilt him up and rape his mouth with his tongue. John, with the last, tiny bit of energy his body contained, crashed his skull against the other man’s head.
“Don’t avoid the conversation. I’m not a fool. I do notice, in fact, when your behavior changes, and every time this comes up, you become a cold, guarded prat. So, on with it, then. Spit it out,
“Besides, it would take nothing more than your voice to get me there. All you’d have to do is ask.” Sherlock turned right to head toward the main street, John’s mouth agape, staring after him.
John dropped the bags to the floor and pressed Sherlock against the counter. A look of surprise stole Sherlock’s mouth and his harder, grey eyes. John kissed him, pinned him to the cabinetry, and Sherlock let his fingers curl into the thick fabric of John’s denims.
There was a sharp rap of the doorknock to her flat. She jumped, boots clacking against the wooden floor. Jane swung open the door to John bundled on the front step, sand blonde hair blustering about in the wind. He stepped inside only for a moment, enough to hold her and remind her to find the floor again. She had been feeling so small, so insignificant, these last few days. Somehow, just a few seconds of being with him reminded her of her power. Jane’s arms gripped him about his middle and she sighed, letting go of the murmuring demons fleeting about in her head. She snagged a knit cap and pulled it snug over her messy curls, slid her hands into her mittens, and then looked to John. “I’m ready,” she finally said, knowing some of it was a lie, but most of it was a truth, and that would just have to be enough.
Short chapter today, loves! Forgive me! I have lesson plans to write tonight! :( A great post tomorrow though, I promise! CT, more Lestrade and Donovan! As always, thank you, you perfect souls, for taking your free time to read my little story. Your words and thoughts have given this narrative a ton of momentum. Couldn't have done it without you! :*
Jasper, B, and Wesley yanked up another table and joined the boys, while the rest of the team filed in and made themselves a seat. John grinned as he finished his third bowl of Fruit Loops.
“My apologies. I’ll be gentler.” Sherlock stared as John deftly unwrapped the gauze to his wounds. He inspected them carefully. Most of them had started to heal. A few of the deeper slices were having a hard time, even with the stitches. John applied an alcohol doused cotton swab to the irritated areas, Sherlock hissed at that, wiped them dry and applied new ointment. “I know this may not work, but would you be comfortable leaving these exposed today? They need to breathe.”
John pulled the image up on his phone again, grinning. He felt Sherlock peering over his shoulder. His cheekbone rested against his hair.
“Yeah, Cap. What’s he like? Doesn’t he dance? With Molly? That’s a good lookin’ bloke, even I’ll admit it,” B chipped in. John blew out a relieved exhale, and then laughed.
What followed left Sherlock in a state of absolute disarray. Had his lungs collapsed? A regular movement had suddenly become a sensual one as John shrugged out of his flannel, shoulders moving in perfect synchronization, and as it slid off his arms, John caught it deftly in his right hand, slinging it over his shoulder like a coat jacket. He turned to one side, feet moving in quick steps across the concrete, locking his knees, ankles, hips. He found Sherlock’s eyes, and winked menacingly before gliding across to Chachi, dropping the shirt in her hands. She raised her eyebrows, obviously impressed and whistled loudly. Sherlock bit his lip as John found new ways to excite him – the tiniest flicker of the flesh of his abdomen as his joints locked solidly into position and out again, the absolute teasing expression on his face as he danced, the confidence radiating off him in waves. His form was untouchable, bias or none, and the ring of people spread out, gave him more room, whistled, hollered, yelled, clapped, mobile after mobile reaching up above the person in front of them, recording him. He slowly began working his way closer to Sherlock. The want running through Sherlock’s veins was scalding him alive; John Watson as a rugby captain was enticing alone. John Watson as a man was a beautiful, perfect enigma to be solved in the most delicate and thorough of ways. John Watson as a sexual being was, thus far, mind-blowing, tantalizing, and stark. John Watson as a dancer was a gift Sherlock had not believed he would ever witness, sharp and perfect and surreal.
John grabbed Sherlock’s bare arm and yanked him to an emptier part of the floor. He stood in front of Sherlock, facing him. The stupidest grin was plastered on his face, he could feel it. His lips were tingling a bit from the whiskey and stout, his body warm and flushed, confidence lingering amongst Cassiopeia and the Little Dipper. He watched as Sherlock roved over his figure, paying particular attention to the ink on his arms. John closed his eyes, tilted his head to the side, and it started with a small tick in his left hand. Once he placed the beat, Sherlock was done for. John bit his lip in anticipation. He found it, gave one tug upwards on his right leg’s denim, making room to move, and stepped forward. He opened his eyes, and Sherlock’s mouth parted in response. John’s left hand pressed flat against Sherlock’s chest, and he rolled his hips forward so they were flush with Sherlock’s. He gave Sherlock hips one, lethal grind before bending back, hand finding the concrete, hips parallel with the floor. Sherlock moved his leg further between John’s knees before folding over to pin him to the floor. Each of Sherlock’s hands bracketed John’s skull, and Sherlock’s hip dipped against John’s thigh. Sherlock rolled up to his knees, then to his feet, and John crawled up Sherlock’s body, hands no longer tentative or shy. The entire warehouse was empty, as far as John was concerned. Sherlock, as always, held his undivided attention. John licked his lips, taking a step forward for Sherlock’s every step back, never more than a few centimeters from his body. They moved in a fantastic, sinuous rhythm. Unlike their first dance, it was less sex-in-clothes and so much more about their synchronicity, their ability to move jointly.
He lifted his hand to touch him, but pulled away. What happens when he does? John imagined breaking a spell: Aurora waking up, confused and uncertain. Why was he in his bed? Oh, but John liked him here… Loved those long legs hanging over the foot board, one arm folded up under the pillow, serene face directed at the window. The moon kissed Sherlock in all the best places. His cheeks, his full, pouty bottom lip, his shirtless shoulder and muscle of his oblique, and two, sweet dimples dead center in his lower back, right above the elastic band of his cotton pyjamas. Watson loved the way he fit next to him in the bed. He had kicked the covers down to the foot board. John silently watched his back move with his breathing. He was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen.
“You brought me here,” John murmured against Sherlock’s open mouth, planting a small kiss on his lower lip.
John stared at the beautiful, tousled, man lying on the bed and felt the now-perfectly-normal prick of tears. Had those words actually left his mouth? Here he was, consulting detective, boy genius, self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath, asking for nothing more than someone, for John, to tell him he loved him. Sherlock Holmes had the best heart of anyone he knew, and he could not think of anyone better suited for sentiment. He never would have guessed...
He turned from the small bed back to Watson. The look on his face was nothing short of terrifying, in the best possible way. His eyes were dark, pushing the sea blue only to the very rims of his pupils. The doctor had a crooked, devilish grin set on his beautifully structured jaw, clenched just slightly, and Sherlock felt so much like prey. He had never felt so feasted upon in all his life. He knew then that Captain wasn’t only a term used during the day job; Sherlock deemed it worthy of escaping his lips if this is what John looked like before ravaging a man. He could easily see himself shouting it out mid-climax, John Watson thrusting between his pale, spread knees, fucking him senseless. Sherlock felt blood relentlessly pour between his hips, and watched as the captain extended his index finger in a come-hither fashion. Without giving his mind the proper time to process, his feet stepped forward until he was sharing John’s air. Watson laced a finger through one of Sherlock’s belt loops, tugging him until the detective’s hard on was resting solidly against the doctor’s waist. John gave a chuckle, palming Sherlock through his trousers. The detective let slip a delicious gasp. Then the doctor’s breath was hot on Holmes’ neck. “Mmm, clever Sherlock. You think you’re the only one that knows how to get exactly what they want?” Sherlock felt faint. Jesus Christ, was he actually going to pass out? His lips began to tingle. “Don’t think I’m oblivious. They don’t call me Three Continents Watson for nothing,
Sherlock was on his fourth drink, and the warm relaxation of a solid buzz was creeping slowly through his bloodstream. Irene was smiling lazily across the table, holding her lipstick stained glass in her right hand. She winked at him, coy as always. “See? Isn’t that lovely? You really ought to relax more often. You’re so structured, Sherlock. Every second of your day is plotted out from the first inhale you take in the morning.”
John rubbed his thumb affectionately across the lion that covered the entirety of his bicep and shoulder. A small smile claimed his mouth. "First one. Was scared shitless, honestly. I got it as a reminder to be brave. We were enduring a lot, my family and me. And, well..." he trailed.
“Just a few minutes past midnight. How are you feeling?” He approached John and caressed the hollow of his cheek. “Good to hear you talking.”
The room then filled with murmuring baritones and tenors, quiet clunks on tables, and Sherlock’s soothing voice whispering, “hear, hear,” encouraging the other gentlemen in the room to do the same. Molly choked back a sob, moved by the ferocity of agreement, and Callum squeezed her into his side, planting a firm kiss on her temple.
Jane kissed them both goodbye, B waiting patiently on a lower step. “Thank you both, so much, for having us tonight. Sherlock, that dinner was to die for.”
“I love you. From your debauched hair to your curling toes.” And he kissed him, deep, sweet and slow, before sweeping him off the bed and carrying him to the shower.
The waiter met them at the table, fawning over Irene, as she crossed her long, uncovered legs in his direction. “What can I get for you, ma’am?” he barely managed.
Sherlock was in his fifth rotation of the choreography when he heard a seat unfold in the third row of the theatre. He ignored the inane swooping in his stomach and continued on. He closed his eyes and briefly wondered if an entire theatre can feel suddenly warm and plush and whole just at the mere presence of one man. He wouldn’t put it past John Watson to be capable of such a feat.
Irene came back to his side, wrapping her arm around Sherlock’s and resting her head against his arm.
As if in unison with his thoughts, there was a gentle rap on the door. John groaned, huffed a loud, irritated sigh, and slowly pushed his way up and off the couch. His socked feet barely lifted from the floor as he made his way to the foyer. Sherlock smiled at him from the top step of the stairs. He pushed his way through the door and into John’s space, planting a firm kiss square on a pair of thin, smiling lips.
“You know what.” John nodded his head toward Sherlock’s now mostly healed arms. The pink was still a jarring contrast to his milk white skin. The detective’s mouth opened and shut a few times, attempting to formulate words and failing.
Jane tapped out the last few sentences of an email. She swiped a tear from her right eye. There was a knock at the door; she groaned inwardly, not wanting human interaction on her already brief planning period. Reluctantly, she went to the door, and smiled at Dr. Phillips waving through the tiny window.
“Oh, look at that, Sherlock. Someone is playing a game with you. How handsome they all are!” Irene’s nails touched to her lips as she watched them.
“Thanks, Holmes. I appreciate it.” John was about to veer to the left when he felt a hand around his wrist. He glanced up, grinning like an idiot.
The handle of the door twisted and Sherlock’s eyes shot to the sound. His heart was pounding in his ears, blood continuing to gorge to his agonizingly hard erection. He heard the boots first, and Sherlock started at his feet. He soaked in every inch of John Watson with his eyes, sure to remember the smallest detail. The captain stood with his legs spread nearly shoulder width apart; his uniform hugged him snugly across his hips and ass. Goddamn, he had a gorgeous ass. His uniform shirt was untucked, sleeves rolled up to reveal tanned skin, veins thrumming and evident. The two top buttons were undone, revealing a white shirt underneath and the faintest gleam of dog tags. Oh. Sherlock felt his cock twitch. Interesting. Watson’s left hand was shoving up the sleeve of his right arm, causing his biceps to flex in response and pull the sleeves tight against his flesh. The hollow of his neck shone with a thin layer of sweat. The detective wanted to bite him there. He wanted to leave a purple mark, right where Watson’s pulse ran wild after PT in the mornings. His mouth held a mischievous smirk, but nothing like the lecherous smile from earlier. Sherlock wanted to press his thumb between John’s lips and feel the captain’s tongue. He wanted to lick his way inside and discover everything there is to learn about Three Continents Watson firsthand.
John shut the refrigerator door and winked at Sherlock. He popped open a ginger ale and joined his lanky counterpart on the couch. “Been doing it since I was a kid, actually. It was a thing Callum and I liked. Sort of weird, maybe, but we did everything together. If one of us wanted to learn how to fish, the other researched the best bait and hook. If one of us needed to figure out how to make eggs without them burning straight to the pan, the other went through various experiments to help sort it out: spray, margarine, butter, low heat, high heat. I was fascinated with break dancing, and so I practiced. Looked into it. Met a few people. I showed Callum one afternoon, in secondary school. We were getting ready for rugby practice.”
