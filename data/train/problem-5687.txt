“So you got demoted,” Tony pressed wiggling his eyebrows.
Peter sputtered. “You can call me Natasha, Peter,” she informed him.
He stepped forward again. “Wait! You didn’t let me finish.”
Steve looked away from the speakers and smiled at the approaching man and rubbed his head. “How’d you know,” he asked putting on his best sheepish smile relaxing his muscles to appear more casual.
Peter shrugged and flicked the plate up spinning it on his finger. “Why are you asking me about my suit?”
“Oh,” Peter said again, “polygamy is cool. Does that mean you’re Bi?”
MJ shoved Peter towards Wanda and Peter stumbled over. He looked objectively confused and Tony walked across the room to be busy with something else to hide his emotions, because really who wouldn't get choked up at people choosing you as family. “Spider-Man,” Fury greeted, “I don’t have to tell you to drive your old man nuts.”
Ned would have cracked by now, but Mj was Mj no matter how scary the Black Widow was Mj would kill him if he cracked. She had said so. So Ned was not going to crack. Nope, not going to crack. He was just going to keep his head in his hands so he couldn’t mess this up.
“Nat made mimosas,” Sam announced passing a one to Loki and Bruce.
Sam paused. “Hey F.R.I.D.A.Y play file Peter R5,” Sam ordered.
Bucky loved the internet. He had his own Tumblr account and everything. While he didn’t take pictures of anyone or if Wakanda everything else was fair game. The name for his account was NotTheWinterSoldier76 which he thought was hilarious.
“It’s all cool,” Bucky interrupted.
He kept his eyes trained on the street. Without much flair, a man in a grey suit appeared in the street. He was wearing sunglasses despite the fact that it was night. Bucky stopped his juggling and tossed another rock up at Scott. “What,” Scott barked coming over to hand his head over the roof.
The air around Loki flashed white and suddenly he was a bit smaller, just as lanky, but wirier. Sam locked his jaw as Loki’s face softened, but his cheeks were hollow from hunger, and eyes baggy. A proper seventeen-year-old. Sam finished cooking as Natasha brushed and braided Loki’s hair.
U spun around Steve moving his camera towards the man’s butt. Steve skittered away while Tony laughed. “That ass is a national treasure,” he exclaimed, “I wanna bite it.”
Polyamory wasn’t a big deal to Steve. After he had fallen in love with Peggy, Bucky had kind of fallen for her as well, so they had been a triad. It was strange not knowing he was part of a triad, but he supposed he really should have known. “Best tactile mind of his generation,” Tony snorted.
Steve did not elect to respond after that. Sam snorted as they entered the kitchen pocketing his phone. “Hey Nat,” Sam greeted the redhead who was humming while she cooked.
Loki nodded and Bucky opened the door further. “Go play with Steve, Sam,” Bucky ordered, “he’s one of his whimsy art moods.”
No, not really. Just then the front door open and Steve waltzed in with a smile and a black eye tossing his keys into the air. “I’m home! Sorry, I’m late,” he called turning to shut the door behind him.
Ah. So that’s why he hadn’t talked. “You don’t have to keep it in,” Sam assured him, “that’s the opposite of what to should do.”
And no one was surprised when Mj and Ned showed up after school the day Pepper and Tony got back with Peter’s missing work.
“You look like you belong here,” Thor noted.
Loki turned his head Sam's warm eyes met his. “Sam where are we?”
Most of the team thought that he and Sharon had a thing going on, and he supposed they might. Honestly, the idea of dating Peggy’s niece sort of disturbed him, especially since Peggy was still alive and they had been sort of dating when he went into the ice. Sharon agreed, even though she did admit that what she felt for him wasn’t necessarily familiar or friendly. Steve didn’t really like thinking about that mess and really they were both happy with their weekly wine nights. Wednesday nights Steve would bring a bottle of red wine to her apartment and they would drink while watching trashy reality tv shows and doing each other's nails.
Steve let out a huff of air and shrugged. “You’ve always been that way. You enjoyed going out with them, but you always said sex with them didn’t do it for ya.”
“Buck you barely remember your mother,” Steve fired back.
“Sure is,” Steve agreed, “thank you for your time, Ma’am.”
“You look like you could use three days sleep,” she announced before dragging him out of the room.
Rubert rubbed the back of his head. “Sorry,” he mumbled holding out his hand to Loki, “Rubert. Sam’s brother in law. Luckily I married Sarah while he was away, so I didn’t have to deal with two scary brothers.”
Mj looked up from her book at that, “hi Wanda.”
Loki felt bitterness because even with Asgard’s distrust in magic they still respected and feared it enough to go through the proper training. “I know you have a sorcerer here no matter how unpleasant. He should have taken responsibility and trained any magic child on Midgard.”
“Uh well apparently she’s a Princess and a genius and I’m just Peter?”
Loki nodded. “I have a father,” Loki began, “he rolls his eyes when I dance across the couch to get his attention, but when I ask for it he always gives it to me, and my Mother shares stories with me so I can share some with her.”
“Thank you,” Rhodey told her.
Rhodey gave him a strange look. “Are you feeling ok Tones?”
“I’m going to die,” Peter exclaimed.
“Ask Stevie how many naps I took,” Bucky put in.
“I’m sorry I would help, but I have to get home,” Wanda announced looking around for Happy.
Loki nodded as he sat up. “Got to use some words Lo. Can’t tell if you’re nodding to pain or being healed correctly,” Tony pointed out.
Steve shoved the other men out and looked back at Sam and Bucky. “We’re good Steve,” Sam assured.
“You are. I’m just acting dramatic for you,” Tony muttered.
“Come to bed,” Steve grumbled, “you can be assholes about this tomorrow.”
“When we were young, Odin made me go to Thor’s chambers every night to brush his hair,” Loki told Sam.
“Loki?”
Wanda hummed. “But why,” Tony asked.
The tray dropped. “Oh my god,” she squeaked, “I’m so sorry, but I can’t believe someone is calling him out on his shit! I hope he gets them.”
Tony laid against the bed and groaned. “F.R.I.D.A.Y did you record that?”
Steve didn’t know that he was dating Tony Stark. Honest to god he didn’t. Sure he had been flirting with Tony a little before he had discovered that Bucky was alive, but they hadn’t really gotten further than that. At least that was what he had thought.
No. Yes. There was so much to say and she couldn’t say any of it. “Thank you,” she said instead.
Bucky shrugged. “Sam calls them fidgets, but yeah a lot of them are like puzzles. It’ll probably hold your attention for a bit. He said some people with ADHD. I dunno though. Just that we have the bin available and it helps some people.”
“Alex please stop,” Sam groaned.
She pulled them both in and Lo was introduced to all of Sam’s cousins and his Sister and his sister in law, and nieces and nephews. “Is Gideon still in the kitchen,” Sam questioned.
Steve Rogers knew damn well who Spiderman was. He had found the kid. Of course, everyone thought that Tony had because he was a genius and had F.R.I.D.A.Y who could watch out for those kinds of things, but nope it had been Steve.
No one relaxed until Brunnhilde spoke up after Tony growled. “He could be anywhere in the world.”
“Peter,” Loki explained, “small fragile little things that get squashed by the big ones, but your not small so it’s okay.”
Ah. Peter Parker. That was what Steve needed. A name and address was what he needed to give to Tony so he could do more research.
Natasha laughed and pinched him, “and so do you”
“Where’s Bucky and Steve,” Sam asked Loki.
“Yes,” Loki agreed, “but in Midgardian years I would be closer to seventeen.”
“Rhodey Bear,” Tony screamed running into the room.
Tony made a grunting noise. “Well now, what are you supposed to do for your honeymoon if you've already done the European tour?”
Clint took a long moment to consider that. “In New York, you don’t know Mj, Mj knows you,” he answered finally.
“What’s an R5,” Bucky questioned.
Sam took a sleeping Loki back to his room.
The robot indeed gave him a fist bump and Peter said pumped his fist into the air and both Peter and the robot started to dance. “I’m impressed,” Tony commented.
Bucky snorted. Then Peter turned towards the open field and a jet black quinjet appeared out of nowhere. It was already landed and the gate was opening. Bucky jumped to his feet and started towards it. Steve sighed and sat up watching Bucky stroll over, and he took a moment to enjoy the view. Tony watched curiously. He wasn’t sure on what terms he stood with Wakanda and if Bucky wanted to brave this storm good for him. T’Challa and Shuri stepped off the ramp with Nikita and Okoye right behind them. “If it is not our White Wolf,” T’Challa greeted, “I did not expect you to be waiting for us.”
“This Holiday has a large Midgardian purpose,” Loki noted as they were driving back home.
His mother was silent for a long minute. “How is that possible? There wasn't any place at the time was there?”
“You can’t go near him,” she stated.
The pair eyed each other for a second and Bucky set his phone on the table. Then Peter was rambling and firing off more questions and Shuri kept up with his ramble and he was eagerly keeping up with her.
The younger boy stumbled over with a cheery smile. “Hi-yah!”
Loki looked at him suspiciously. “Good morning,” he answered back his voice hoarse.
“Why can’t you go,” Loki questioned.
“We’ll have Avengers thanksgiving the week before so Loki can have some practice and everyone can go see their families on the actual day,” Steve decided.
Steve gasped softly when the pen made its first line. After that, the only sound was the tv and light breathing.
Natasha closed the window and made a shooting motion towards Sam. “Don’t worry Loki and I are good. Have fun.”
Loki tried not to focus on anything. Not even his swirling thoughts. Not of his own memories of Odin dragging him to the planets of their allies and laying Loki at their feet in offering. His angry hand on his shoulders crushing it, telling Loki what he would do to him if he didn’t obey these people. How eventually all he had needed was to hold Loki shoulder and tell him to behave to reduce him to a trembling mess.
Loki followed silently. Sam cooked in silence while Loki laid on the couch half-watching him half reading. Sam didn’t bother to say much. They ate in silence and after dinner, Loki slipped back to his room.
He watched Spiderman who definitely was not a full-grown man answer a call. His body tensed in the all shoot position which reminded Steve of how Bucky use to react when his Moma came looking for him when he didn’t come home on time.
Clint and Rhodey waisted patiently watching the panic spread across her face. “Wait! No,” she exclaimed, “that was an accident. I totally didn’t mean that. I’m so sorry!”
Natasha flipped open the first page. “It’s enchanted so that who’s ever reading sees it in their most common language,” she announced.
“Why not,” Tony demanded.
“Uncle Sam,” Janie demanded, “what kind of monster are you?”
Wanda’s eyebrows arched up. “Really,” she questioned.
Good days Loki acted like a slightly reserved and shy teenager, maybe a little content, but bad days he sat silent and still staring out a window and flinching at anyone who came too near. Sometimes he only sat and screamed. Some days were worse than others and Sam spent many days on the couch with Loki watching movies and musicals and dance videos just trying to soothe him. Some days it worked and some days it didn’t.
Confusion and horrification were deep in Thor’s face. “That can’t be true,” Thor stated, “our father and Loki never saw eye to eye, but-“
“Still take,” Steve corrected.
“I like you,” Wanda declared.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he answered.
His mother remained silent as he opened the box. “I got married Mom,” he confessed.
Loki didn’t touch the picture but sat up. “Why isn’t your husband here.”
Fuck you. Seriously you can just fuck off. There is no way in hell you ever deserved Steve, not that I do either, but that’s another story, who did you think you were messing with.
“Why would you know,” Peter demanded.
While Shuri was friendly, funny, and intelligent she had a hard time keeping friends. The Wakanda people were amazing and smart, but even they couldn’t match Shuri’s intelligence. And if you can’t keep up with her she didn’t always have a ton of patience, even though she often had more patience for that than those she was trying to talk to. And her schedule was varied. She didn’t have the time to keep connections. Then there was her mental age which was much higher than most of the people her age, because of all the things she had gone through. But Peter seemed to be doing her good.
“Right,” Steve agreed.
“I forgot about that message,” Sam said as she entered, “I thought we had at least a few years to figure this out.”
“Is he ok?” Sam asked.
The girl's eyes widened further. “Rebecca get out of here,” the manager yelled, “I’m sick of hearing about this guy whenever he messes with someone.”
We spent the night in the broom closet kissing. It was the only thing that would keep him from going out and getting his ass kicked. So he was out and I wasn’t, but we made it work. After we got out of basics they sent us to the pararescue training. The other guys had been there for weeks and were the new guys. But after a week Rylie and I were on par with the best of them. We knew everything about each other, knew how we were going to react. Wingmen they called us. The Hawk and his Falcon. There was always speculation about the two of us, but it was pretty high up in government clearance so we kept it hidden.
Rhodey looked over at Pepper. “Peter,” he answered.
Peter rolled his eyes. “I’m not your legitimate child so it doesn’t matter.”
Pepper shrugged, “he’s spending the night, but he has school the next day. It depends when you get in.”
The other teens frowned at Loki’s sudden defensiveness, about something that no one accused him of. “The only non-obvious way you could cheat is if you were shuffling the deck,” Drake stated, “and you haven’t shuffled the deck.”
Loki snapped his fingers again and he died as well. “I’m sorry to draw you into this Angrboda,” Loki told her kissing his son’s cheek.
Bucky was recovering well and he was interested in engaging with the rest of the team other than Steve. Steve was so proud of Bucky’s recovery. He had never loved anyone like he loved Bucky. Though he was also trying to repair his relationship with Tony. It was going surprisingly well. They both had things they had done wrong and now it was their responsibility to fix it. Which Bucky said was insufferably moralistic and Tony had been quick to agree.
“It would be my pleasure,” she answered and the elevator went down.
And like all things Wanda’s not sure how to answer at first, but she nods. “Sure,” she agreed wiping away the tears.
“Steve you can’t cook for crap,” Bucky declared.
Tony blinked because he hadn’t said who. “I will make arrangements. Expect me in a week.”
Loki learns more about trust and so does everyone else.
Sam smiled. “Sam!”
“Murdering someone's children is a little more than fucked up,” Rhodey snarled, “but what Loki said was very different. No wonder the guy has a few screws loose.”
Steve frowned. “Do we have a way to contact Thor?”
He flung himself at Bruce who clung to him like he was a lifeline. “What is going on,” Tony demanded stepping back, “did you magic in here? I thought you couldn’t do that without the bifrost.”
Wanda liked the hip-hop music from Sokovia and neighboring countries. It made her feel closer to home.
The surprising thing came when a girl stormed into the room. She had a hard face and bushy black hair and she was dragging a boy behind her who looked terrified but resigned. The girl assessed both Natasha and Cho and nodded her head putting her bag down beside the bed and walking over to the hologram screen.
“Like you don’t,” Sam retorted.
“Oh, ah right. Um,” Peter exclaimed.
Steve’s breath hitched. “Yeah,” he admitted.
“Wanda you’ve had one conversation,” Tony pointed out.
Wanda watched Happy punch the professor. “What the hell,” Happy muttered shaking out his hand, “what kind of creep starts to tell a girl how sexy her brain would be on an operating table. Fucking sicko.”
Loki frowned. “It’s a tethering spell that binds me through my magic,” Loki stated.
“You do love me, Stevie,” Tony exclaimed, “and here I thought you were going to tell me to add more stuff to the suit.”
Steve groaned and settled back on the couch next to Tony, continuing to show Tony the pictures he actually did want to see thank you very much. “Small agents,” Tony exclaimed as Clint and his family walked into the room.
Tony made to stop the video, but Steve swatted his hand away. “Sorry Mom,” Peter groaned.
Sam hugged him. “I’m glad you like it. Now let’s go get ready.”
“Yeah Sam,” Loki asked popping his head up.
Strange threw him at another wall with a flick of his wrist and the Avengers in the room yelled.
He poured another cup and eyed Loki. Loki wanted to shrink back, but Natasha was still braiding so Loki fought off the impulse. “Good Morning Lo.”
Sam passed out around five in the morning and was woken up to light shining in his face. He groaned and shifted, but felt a weight against his side. He looked down and saw Loki. Loki looked back up at him. “Hi,” Lo greeted.
The door to the bathroom opened. “You’re awake,” Sam greeted, “how are you this morning?”
“That is not proper English,” Loki noted and looked at the time, it was the earlier part of the evening.
When Sam, Natasha, and Wanda left the room Loki looked up at the camera. “House Temptress please show me what happened yesterday before I passed out.”
Sam nodded. So all that was left was to wait. And wait they did. Tony eventually made his way over to Wanda and they started a game of go fish with Clint and Scott. Bucky had joined Sam on the couch and Natasha had squirmed her way between the two of them and Sam was obediently doing her nails.
“You are though,” Steve teased, “go play your game.”
Wanda never meet Fury, neither had Vision, or Peter, and Sam had only meet the man a handful of times, but he knew better than to disrespect him because of that.
“Make someone else do it. You give up too much of your time anyways,” she exclaimed.
That felt more comfortable. “I have no such plans to,” Loki answered.
“Be good at languages,” Steve suggested without sympathy, “I was pretty good with them before the serum.”
“Theater without words,” Loki shook his head.
Everything and nothing. “You aren’t going to drop this until I go will you?”
When she woke up she was in a soft room that smelled like lavender. Wanda rubbed her face as she sat up on the bed.
Sam for a moment looked pained. “Yeah,” he agreed, “it’s one of them. Rylie he was my best friend, but he was killed in action.”
“He’s a murder, Sam. He won’t hesitate to kill you,” Rhodey warned.
“I volunteered,” Sam answered.
Tony wasn’t sure what he was expecting for an answer, but a small laugh wasn’t one of them. “Maybe,” he agreed, “they tend to adopt me.”
Wanda returned rubbing her hands off on a rag. “Yeah Steve and I enrolled at the community college here. He’s mostly taking art classes, but I think he has a few oh- Bucky what are they?”
Tony took in a big breath. “What’s this,” he asked.
Sam was woken up at four in the morning by F.R.I.D.A.Y. “Mr. Wilson Loki is currently awake,” she announced.
Wanda cried again and he held her through it all.
Tony shrugged in reply. “Not any time soon,” he admitted, “I don’t think we have the relationship for that, but I think if he would like that one day I would too.”
Tony: >:I Why am I the only true Diva alive?
Wanda laughed tears rolling down her cheeks. “I missed you too,” she answered.
Sam watched Steve and Bucky kiss and made a gagging sound. Loki laughed and Steve flipped him off. “How was it while I was away,” Sam asked as he and Loki arrived in their house.
Bucky Barnes
Sam pushed everything down. It was one thing to cry with his Mom for an hour it was another to break down in front of the entire family. Not that he thought it was a bad thing it just wasn’t something he was ready for. “Yeah Rylie and I were together,” he confirmed, “since the first night at training, he made me his husband and then he died.”
The week crept up quickly and Aunt May told him to be good and let Happy take him away. Peter was nervous, to say the least.
There was loud yelling from down the hallway and Loki sighed. “He is so your kid,” Alex laughed.
Sam turned around to save Natasha’s bacon and sent off another text to Steve.
She hadn’t even thought about switching colleges but she was relieved. Without Peter here, until the others arrived she could end up alone. Tony and Pepper were busy people.
“Not recently, but I know how.”
Everything was the same as it always was. Loki rubbed his arms. “Bad dreams,” Sam guessed.
Oprah. Steve and his mother said that there were protest going across the whole country, but Sam couldn’t think of that. He just wanted his marriage certificate. It hurt in all the ways he had never let it hurt before.
“If your doctors hadn’t already messed this up further it wouldn’t take that long.”
“I have a spell cursed upon me that prevents me from harming anyone. The Magic has a mind of its own, and the mind of its maker. Thor does not trust magic and since he instructed the spell through Heimdall the spell must see my magic as a weapon and I can not direct it at another even their own magic. I would suggest taking a step back.”
“Why what,” Sam questioned.
“I don’t need to be with anyone to be happy,” Sam informed the pair, “I’m happy as I am now.”
Pepper greeted her with a warm smile and Wanda sank into a seat. She listened to Tony and Rhodey chatter. After eating half of the cookie dough Wanda fell asleep. It was the best sleep she had gotten in months.
Sam blew out a deep breath. “So do I,” he agreed, but he wasn’t sure what he worried about the most.
Where had that come from? “I’m a twink,” Loki added.
This Bucky was soft. Bucky before Hydra had not been. That Bucky had been rough, suave, angry, and a compleat gentleman, but not soft. This Bucky was and Steve found himself loving that.
Yeah, it could have been. Between the hot chocolate warm pretzels and ice cream Wanda fell asleep. When she woke up she was in her bead and her head was thumping. The events of the previous night rushed over her. She groaned and threw a pillow over her head.
Loki nodded. Sam got up pulled a piece of the sandwich off of it plopped it into his mouth and chewed it. “Do you want the door open or closed?” Sam asked as he left.
Sam left and went to find Loki. “Hey Lo,” he called waking into the guest room where Loki laid on the floor with his older niece and cousins’ sons.”
“Of course it does,” Sam assured, “it always matters.”
She gave him a soft slap. “You will not push me away again,” she growled.
Peter whooped and ran off. Peter came back with the gold cart. “So where is everyone else,” he heard Sam asked as he stopped the golf cart.
Wanda felt the fear and confusion she had at the other colleges, the people here were not so easily tricked as they had been in France. Not when she lost all five Scarlet Witch look-alike contest. It would take getting used to but she could do it.
She couldn’t spend much time looking over the room. It was to empty. Wanda pulled a new outfit out of her duffel bag and left the room as soon as she could searching for any other human in the house.
Loki nodded slowly. “Great,” Sam agreed, “we’re going for a walk.”
“Tempters are very refined. They are drawn to one thing and know everything about it. It’s difficult to train to be one, so most Tempters naturally come into what they are. They protect and keep safe what they are connected to and that things react to them. Thor’s human girlfriend has a Temptress.”
Steve’s eyebrow flicked up. “F.R.I.D.A.Y play City Lights,” he ordered.
“Did you add a heater?” Steve asked.
“It suits you,” she snarked, “you certainly act like one.”
They sat in the kitchen. Tony had taken Peter to school and Wanda was being dropped at college as well by Rhodey and Clint. “Friends what is going on,” Thor asked as soon as they were all sitting.
Natasha chuckled and the pair left Loki to get used to his new room on his own. Natasha helped Sam make dinner and eventually corralled Loki back down to eat.
Tony rolled his eyes again. “Natalie talk to Banner and make him give me my coffee back,” Tony demanded.
“Good morning!”
“What made you come?”
“And it was a…”
Steve blinked and shook his head. “No,” he argued.
Later back at the compound Tony thought that he’d always regret bringing Peter into that fight. That was why he couldn’t look at him. Peter was supposed to be his and Steve’s responsibility, but that was ruined now.
“Which is,” Odin pressed.
Bucky and Loki talked about power arrangements until Sam walked in. “Hey,” he greeted, “dinner is ready.”
“You’re not going to die,” Aunt May answered, “Natasha is lovely.”
Natasha laughed and they stepped into the kitchen. Sam waved putting a piece of pie on a plate. “Hey,” he greeted.
Tony stayed silent as Bucky spoke. He guessed the other man had a point, somewhere. “So you understand that my Ma wasn’t offended when she realized I loved Steve’s Ma more. And he knew that. He knew I worshiped that women" Bucky paused for a moment "he didn’t tell me when she died.”
Loki focused on Wanda and the way her magic was pulsing at his mind. He searched for the section it was aiming for. It was the section in which his memory of invading earth was in, the part the Mind Stone touched. Loki looked a the android who had the mind stone.
Sam laughed and let F.R.I.D.A.Y play through the videos. “Will you stay?” Loki asked his eyes fluttering shut.
Loki couldn’t even defend himself now, but when the spell was gone it would be different. Seeing as it wasn’t Sam figured he could sooth that worry. Sam knew that Loki resented not being able to fight, he would feel the same way.
“We’re proud of you,” Gideon announced, “for sharing this with us. Now please tell me you are dating Alice because I have fifteen dollars on Alice.”
Peter opened his mouth in an O shape and then snapped it shut before nodding. “Hey, Mr. Loki! How are you hanging? Fitting in? Doing? Getting Comfy?”
There was a set of staircases that lead to a basement that sounded quieter, the lights looked gentler. “The café is down there,” a short little woman announced with a smile, “you have that newcomer look. It’s for the younger people, the ones who don’t want alcohol, or for people with sensation sensitivities. Welcome home.”
“This one,” he told them.
He turned his head and watched the three other exiled Avengers plus Scott, and Vision floating next to Wanda walk in. “Mr. Stark,” Vision flustered, “I believe there is an explanation.”
“Hydra had the Winter Soldier kill my parents,” Tony confessed, “and my reaction was not something I am proud of.”
“Are they going to hurt you?”
“Sam!”
“Snicker Doodles?”
Loki stared at him. Which Sam thought that said more about his mental state than anything he had said today. “Let’s go get dinner,” Sam suggested walking away.
Wanda waved goodbye to Peter and followed Pepper down the hall. Pepper paused waiting for an answer. “Once,” she answered, “but not for very long.”
If it had just been Steve Sam would have shut the door on him. “Hey Sam,” Steve greeted in a voice that said he was righteously angry, “Bucky and I are going out with Clint and Wanda for ice cream. Do you want to join, Lo?”
Natasha looked at Fury her eyebrows twitching up, but she nudged the kind of teen to stand next to Peter and Wanda. Wanda slipped her arm around Loki’s waist and drew herself in front of him. He dropped his chin down to her shoulder and Fury looked over the three of them and nodded. “Well, I’m sure between the three of you-you can get your parents into trouble.”
“The only thing that you are is amazing,” Tony answered, “what have we talked about self-deprecation?”
“White button-down shirt under the sweater with the color out, and blue jeans. We’ve talked about this,” Shuri demanded
It was different though. It was different. Thor has put the spell in place, he had put the chains and muzzle on. He had done that. Not their father. Thor was doing this to him. Thor was giving him away.
“I wanted a nap and I’m not sleeping in a fucking chair,” Bucky answered climbing to his feet and leaning against Steve’s back.
“Obviously,” Steve agreed not trying to fight the smile on his lips.
“Of course,” Wanda answered, she didn’t want a house for herself.
She put her book in her bag and a call from Pepper came in. “Hey Mj,” she greeted, “how’s Peter?”
Sometimes it amazed Sam how easily they joked about Bucky’s missing memories but then again the pair was fucking weird to begin with.
Thor left and Sam took Loki up to his room. Loki was bedridden for a day the memories he had brought up to much for him, but he was back on his feet the day after that. He practiced ballet with Natasha and fought with Wanda over a cake recipe and Sam knew Loki would be okay.
“Bruce!”
Then he curled up against Bucky and fell asleep. Bucky woke up in the middle of the night like he usually did and detangled himself from the furnace that was Steve. He went to see if Tony had stalked their kitchen with food. Halfway to the kitchen, he tripped over Steve’s damn shield. Bucky rubbed his face taking a picture of it.
“No one living likes me?”
Steve grinned at him. “Sam likes to say stuff like that,” he agreed.
Loki agreed and they spent their night eating ice cream and watching The Notebook for whatever reason.
Still, Bucky clung to him. They touched, cuddled, occasionally kissing on the top of the head or hands a careless gesture. And they had started out in separate rooms. They really did and that lasted about a week. In their defense...well there wasn’t much to defend. They both had terrible nightmares that kept them up but felt better if the other one was there. And they got separation anxiety. So it wasn’t really a surprise when neither of them managed to stay by themselves the whole night and joined the other.
Natasha chuckled, “Steve and Bucky eat like that as well. My metabolism runs a bit high for a human, but nothing on your level. Tony showed me your schematics. Steve told him that you probably had a high metabolism so Tony was watching out for it.”
She looked up at him her eyes twinkling. “No problem Captain.”
Peter handed over the phone. Bucky put Shuri’s number in it and then put his and Steve’s in as well. “Is she ok with that,” Peter asked.
“Do you want me to leave?”
Sam: Did you see the dorito article?
Well, Loki didn’t speak much in general. Only if he was spoken to. Even then he mostly preferred to communicate with head shakes.
Loki took in a deep breath. “Thank you.”
“Still,” Sam argued, “no one’s asked you to be a part of that and if they did you’d have all the right to say no, but you haven’t. So thanks.”
Douchebag,
Tony almost gagged when Clint used his nick Name fro Rhodey. Clint grabbed Rhodey’s hand holding it in his and patted Wanda’s leg with his free hand. She sunk into her seat. Before any of the Avengers or the newscast could react to the shit show Clint had just caused Bucky walked in with Steve on his toe. The producer signaled for a pause before either of the men could step onto the set.
Steve caught his arm before he could get very far and pulled him back into the kiss. It was Tony’s turn to gasp. However, Steve was a really good kisser and Tony found himself captivated. Ha CAPtivated.
He left and Loki put his chin in his hands. “That was extravagant,” he noted.
The screen faded away. After the Avengers hurried off stage to the dressing rooms. The news studio was silent and then it was a flurry of emotion and excitement. Bucky showed them the video of the proposal, and they made plans to go out to eat, but to pick up the kids first.
“Who rules here,” Loki inquired.
Sam nodded. There was a knock on the door. “Sam!”
“What hurts маленький паук,” Natasha asked.
With that Scott grabbed the bottle and went back to work. “Ladies, gentlemen, and nonbinary pals were are about to start our Tony Stark look-alike contest,” Natasha’s voice carried over the speakers, “so can I have all my Starks bring it to the stage?”
“Flippity Flap,” Peter exclaimed seeming really put out despite his good words.
The problem was that Tony was in a relationship with Pepper Potts who Steve felt honored to meet because she was all that Tony bragged about and more. Steve respected that. It didn’t appear like Tony was seeing anyone outside of Mrs. Potts either all the news articles seemed convinced that she had set him straight and was going to be his one and only forever. So Tony was monogamous which was fine.
Sam didn’t say anything. “He thinks highly of you Sam,” Natasha admitted, “you’re doing the right thing.”
Chase smiled softly. “Are there any other families in this complex,” Steve questioned.
Scott snorted. And Tony waved a stack of papers. “Rhodey sent me as his messenger boy.”
“Yeah,” Sam answered, “Loki’s not going to hurt him, and I think I’m going to move Loki into my place.”
Tony gulped. “Sam and Steve were afraid that her angry arrival would aggravate me. The only time I really did anything was when I thought Steve was in danger. A second assassin waving knives around yelling that seemed like a situation that wouldn’t end pleasantly, but it was actually the opposite. It was like I was processing the world correctly for the first time. The only thing I was capable of was to offer her my understanding.”
The three other people let out various noises of disbelief and horror. “You haven’t seen the videos! Sam, you asshole what have you been doing with him,” Rhodey demanded.
“So where are we,” Wanda questioned.
Wanda sighed and listened to Tony ramble taking in her surroundings as he lead the way to the house. It was beautiful. “Hey Tony why are we not in New York,” she asked.
“I didn’t know either” Bucky answered licking his lips “but you and I are two similar kinds of fucked up.”
“I don’t think you have grounds to decide what’s healthy,” Sam answered and Natasha shot him a glare, “I’m not worried so much about Wanda as I am about Clint and Rhodey. I think they’ll go crazy if they don’t know who she is talking to for much longer.”
“It is,” Sam answered, “but downstairs is our coffee shop clubhouse and the teens like to go down there. Bucky gives them glow in the dark stamps and Natasha makes sure they don’t try to sneak upstairs and if they do someone drags them out and they can't get a hold of alcohol so it’s good.”
Thor left that afternoon with Valkyrie on his heels, who said a fond farewell to Natasha. Mj was there and she had a word with the women before she left. “Well Lo,” Tony said resting his chin on top of Loki’s head, “I got to say I’m glad that I don’t cause the most drama here anymore.”
Tony sighed rubbing his face and Peter winked at Wanda from under his dramatics. “Don’t you know what’s in your own house?” Wanda asked searching around for a spoon.
Tony rolled his eyes and flopped down onto the couch. “Blasphemy,” he yelled pointing at a camera and then leveled his look at Steve, “why must you turn my children against me, Rogers?”
“It’s fine Ned,” Peter called back “now come on!”
“I don’t care,” Tony exclaimed but then he sighed, “F.R.I.D.A.Y where’s the alien?”
“I can’t do that Lo,” Natasha explained and smiled fondly before turning her attention back to her task, “now Sam, food!”
Loki climbed out of the bed. He was in a flimsy piece of cloth he remembered Thor complaining about and calling a hospital gown. Well. Loki walked to his room rolling his eyes. He found a black pair of pants and a green hoodie in his closet. As he slipped them on a knock came at his door. “You may enter,” he answered.
Your first letter absolutely sucked. It was cold and heartless and I hated it and I hated you. And now I read this and I can only laugh because if I don’t laugh I’ll cry. I think Pepper is going to get it framed. I’m not sentimental like that. And just so you know fuck you too.
Sam knew that very well. “I think she’s going to be spending more time in Washington now,” Bucky added his jaw clenching.
Sam sighed. “Normally I wouldn’t push,” Sam stated as Natasha sat on Loki’s other side, “but you literally told Natasha and I that you are biologically a pescatarian and that being forced to eat meat in Asgard hurt your development.”
When he lived with us, not like they were wanted fugitives or anything. Oh, and she was nice despite the fact that he had killed her boyfriend's parents wasn’t that great? “It is a pleasure Pepper and please call me Bucky.”
“Do you want to see if you can leave this place for a day,” Sam asked.
“Goodnight,” Loki replied.
Loki rolled over and his eyes fluttered heavily open. “Sam?”
“So I’ve heard,” Bucky grumbled with a smile and opened the doors.
The result was Tony scanning the entire neighborhood with Thor giving them all a troubled and suffering look. The shapeshifter was gone and would appear again when he wanted to. Thor knew this, new that there was a chance that they wouldn’t know even if he did show up again in another form.
Steve had never shown any interest in anything like that before. Wanda shrugged. “Well, he took me there to get registered and kinda got sucked in.”
Steve: Yes and fuck you for encouraging Clint
Strange locked his jaw. “Whatever,” he snapped and set the book down, “I will instruct her.”
“No,” the boy yelled stumbling to his feet, “I won’t say it you old cow!”
Loki looked away. “Preferably isolation and solitary confident.”
“Can I drive it” Peter asked.
Bucky sighed. They were terrible judging his fashion choices making him change his outfit. If it was just Sam he would have flipped him off and while Shuri was happy to flip anyone off Who mildly annoyed her he wasn’t going to endorse those bad habits around her. So he went back to his room and changed again.
Loki sighed. “When I worked up the courage to tell him I showed him the earnings first and before I could explain he asked me which poor women I had stolen them from and if it was my tongue or my fingers that persuaded her,” Loki answered the innuendos dripped from the words, “and before I could deter him from that path he laughed at me and told me that he was glad I was not a woman or I would seduce men from their fortunes and wives and then take on other diplomats with my pretty lips. When he finished laughing I stabbed him and I wouldn’t speak to him for three years. But I don’t think you’ll have that problem. I hope your mother cries.”
Soon Christmas came. Sam took Loki to meet Rylie’s mother who doted on him much to Loki’s pleasure and they visited his family on Christmas Eve, but on Christmas they were home, with Natasha singing in the living room while Sam baked in the kitchen, Steve was drawing the fireplace while Bucky and Loki played the board game Peter gave Loki for Christmas in front of it. It was a very good day.
Tony hadn’t expected Bucky to feel guilty over it. He had figured that those problems had gotten worked out. After all, Hydra has used him as a weapon. It had taken Tony a while to get to the same point, but that was besides what he was talking about.
That had been all she wanted from him. Support, someone to watch her back and he had given it to her freely. He rolled his eyes but smiled.
“Is that a kid,” Sarah sputtered.
Steve blushed more. “How is he?”
“That’s Lo, Tony,” Steve answered, “you forgot that he’s a shapeshifter.”
He took Loki back to his room and rejoined the rest of the gang. Bruce was explaining his time with Thor and how he and Loki ended up back on Earth. Sam told them about everything that had happened since, and Tony showed the video proof. Darcy cried.
She turned away to hide her blush and Tony laughed. “You’ll be great at it,” he assured her.
“No,” Loki protested, “that’s a lie!”
That made ten words today, Sam noted. Shuri smiled and shook her head. “The cool part,” she repeated holding out a pen-like object, “is that this Steve can use this to draw on your arm.”
It was silent for a couple of heartbeats. Bucky shifted and leaned over Steve to give Tony a kiss on the lips. “Good Night Tony.”
Sam wasn’t sure what that was about so he ignored it. Instead, he enjoyed the gentle day with Loki. That night Sam watched Loki’s breath rise and fall in his room sound asleep.
Wanda had been walking from her late night class to the student parking lot where Happy was suppose to pick her up from. As she entered the parking lot in the dark mind you, someone grabbed her arm. “Miss. Maximoff.”
The boy gasped. “How do you know who I am?”
“Sure,” Sam agreed, “but nothing else. This is stressful enough.”
Wanda smiled and sat across from him. “Eat whatever you want” he offered “I tend to grab whatever looks good.”
“Thank god,” she answered and then stepped forward pulling him into a hug.
Rhodey snorted. “Of course,” the man agreed, “that was the start of the joke that you’re Tony Stark’s Niece.”
“Let me in Sam.”
Steve laughed. “Asshole,” Bucky muttered and sighed, “I remember having sex with dames,” he admitted after a while, “I remember you doing that as well, but I didn’t like it. Like eating stale chips. Sure you can do it, but you don’t really want to.”
Mj’s eyes didn’t leave the book. “Through the front door,” she answered, in more of a duh tone she had any right to have.
“Movie night,” Sam announced passing Loki a bowl of popcorn.
But Wanda said nothing and let Pepper chatter. Pepper was a lovely person. Her strength was firm but quiet. Wanda loved that. “Congratulations on your engagement,” Wanda told her.
“You didn’t come to dinner last night,” Sam noted sitting down across from him.
“That would be helpful if we knew how frost giant biology worked Babe,” Jane answered.
Bucky handed the man his phone. Steve snorted. “Did you really just pickpocket him?”
“He’s Sam and I’m Mrs. Black Widow,” Natasha asked leaning against the counter next to Sam bumping his hip playfully.
Dummy wandered over and beeped at Steve. Steve patted the robot's side. “Really Dummy you to,” Tony complained, “why do I even keep you.”
Loki let out a deep breath and nodded. “Thank you.”
“Sam tells me I have PTSD, depression, maybe separation anxiety, and a handful of character defects and poor coping mechanisms that all lead to behavioral issues that make me a handful,” Loki chuckled, “apparently I need attention or I’ll get into trouble.”
Tony groaned. “I’ll call Strange. Natalie give me a cookie.”
“Did you invade New York,” Tony demanded.
“Same idea,” Tony waved off.
“A couple,” Chase answered, “the Albrights on the first floor have two kids a boy who’s three and a girl who's five. They’re sweet. Then the Johnsons on the third floor have a thirteen-year-old daughter, of course, there’s us, and the Frisks who are now expecting a daughter. This apartment complex is more for the elderly and bachelors I’m afraid. Though the next one over is full of families. Oh yeah. I almost forgot May Parker is raising her nephew Peter. Her husband Ben died last year, shot in a mugging. They’ve been having a rough time so I’m afraid they aren’t the most sociable. Peter is about fifteen I think. Anyways they’re on the fourth floor, right above this one I think.”
Steve smiled. “Twins actually,” he answered, “they’re sixteen. It’s been hard on them, but we are moving forward.”
Tony looked at Peter. “Did that actually happen to you,” he asked.
“If I’m up this early and not screwing you then I get to say whatever I want,” Bucky answered.
Loki’s eyes caught on Wanda and he leaned forward slightly. Sam got out of the car and waved the girl over. Her face lit up when she saw him. “Sam! What are you doing here?”
“Revised,” Rhodey trumpeted with a smile.
Natasha looked at the young spider and the badly wrapped box. She took it gingerly. “This is for me?”
“Exactly,” Sarah agreed.
Wanda rolled her eyes and slipped the women her ID. The women looked at it and frowned. She looked between the pair and her frown deeper. “Jesus Christ,” Tony muttered as they sat down a minute later, “the other two colleges just gasped at us. Geez.”
Steve: Screw you, Sam. We are not that bad.
His mother was silent waiting to see if he would continue and when he didn’t she pushed. “To who Baby? How is that illegal?”
Loki’s eyes popped open. He sat straight up and saw a child with tousled brown hair. “Peter,” he asked rubbing his eyes.
Loki did not attend dinner. “Hey F.R.I.D.A.Y,” Sam asked, “what is Loki doing?”
“Sam did not speak of a Vision,” Loki noted.
“Ned and I were doing a research project in sixth grade about Captain America and we got really confused as to why there’s no public record of any letter he wrote. So three days latter Ned and I are neck deep in conspiracy theories and looking at letters that Bucky wrote to his mom, and the more we read them the more we realize that they were tampered with so we started to search for the originals and we found a place with copies of the originals and Bucky asks his mom to look after Steve like all the time and his mom says that Steve wrote him every day. So Ned hacks like every government agency he can think of until we find the letters. And we spend like three more days trying to figure it all past the government cover-up and crap and then we leaked it to conspiracy theory sites ‘cause hacking is illegal folks.”
Tony and Rhodey laughed. “Well, I’m sure she’ll be happy to hear all that tomorrow bud,” Tony answered.
Tony and Steve made it their joint mission to help out Spiderman- Aka Peter Parker- AKA the most precious child to have ever existed according to Tony. Who had decided to make a new suit for the kid after they determined that the kid was just wearing a costume and had zero protection.
“Where else would he be,”  F.R.I.D.A.Y snarked, “would you like me to take you down.”
Sam rolled his eyes and went to find Loki. “I have a question about the spells on you,” Sam stated as he found him reading at the kitchen table.
It all but confirmed that Loki at one point had been some kind of sex slave at one point. Sam felt his stomach turn. “Loki,” Clint breathed.
His mother held him until the tears dried out. “Do you still wear your tags,” she asked.
A minute later Tony’s camera whipped around to follow the ball past Steve and Bucky kept his on Peter who always made the best facial expressions. Peter jumped up and down doing handstands and backflips. Steve got the ball and jogged over dropping down next to Bucky who had sent Tony his video. Bucky whined and Steve sighed wiggling until he was in Bucky’s arms.
“I guess he had a point,” he admitted and his brain glitched back to being an awkward mess, “you got heart kid. Where’re you from?”
“I don’t think Bucky is small,” Sam corrected.
Loki both understood and didn’t. “I don’t know how this fits into grammar,” Loki said a half an hour later, “but I do not mind.”
Five hours later Peter was resting peacefully in a hospital bed his fever slowly going down. Cho and Natasha were sitting by his bed and Wanda was updating the team about his condition. And Tony was basically having a panic attack across the world. Natasha had spent the last hour and a half getting him to calm down.
“You were annoying,” Bucky quipped back.
“I’m going to get goats,” Bucky announced.
She reached forward and kissed his cheek. “Call soon hmm? And I want you to transfer your videos and pictures of Peter into the community folder.
Loki flicked his fingers out for a second. “I never lived on Jotunheim” Loki admitted “Odin stole the power from the planet in order to slowly kill it, so what I saw was shambles of what it once was, but Jotunheim is too cold for it to allow many animals to survive and most are not very big. So instead the crops adapted to grow in the freezing cold and the Jotun learned how to fish and create fisheries in the cold. I believe your word is pescatarian. While other meats are not lethal they are not easy on Frost Giant digestion or break down in the way that food should. Besides that, it does not matter what I eat.”
Loki doesn’t focus much on what happens around him after that, because Sam was there and Sam was safe so Loki watched the movie like the Temptress requested and fell asleep as the next one started.
Sam hadn’t thought that Loki would notice that. “Tony has a son,” Sam answered, “and Clint has a daughter.”
“He was walking through Queens and saw you put doing your thing he followed you home,” Tony answered, “he’s nosy as fuck and investigated. Then he brought your name and address back to me and the rest is history.”
Maybe Thor had known what Odin had done. Maybe he acted like he didn’t so Loki would have a reason to stay in Asgard. Well, Loki didn’t want anything to do with Thor anymore.
Peter blinked hazily at her. “Mom,” he croaked, “it hurts!”
Loki ran out of the room. Sam left as well. He was not having this argument today. Loki didn’t leave his room for two days. Another week past and everyone was more settled with the idea. Steve, when he came out of his house, said it was like having a Cat that Sam took care of. “The muzzle,” Steve told them, “and the way that Loki’s eyes were dead and let himself be manhandled unlocked some pretty violent memories Bucky had been suppressing.”
Steve
Every head in the room whipped up to the tv. A plane crash was on a beach. Sam winced at the sound of Bucky’s metal arm being crushed again.
Sam forced himself to stop talking. Loki looked at the picture again and back at Sam. “Losing your spouse is pain beyond measure,” Loki murmured, “thank you for sharing with me.”
“Of course,” she agreed.
And so Loki talked and Thor listened. Neither moved until Loki had finished. Thor cried. He sobbed. Thor had never been the smartest Asgardian, but he had amazing empathy. “I was stolen from my first family and kept apart from my second. I will stay with this one,” Loki finished.
So yeah Rylie was my husband.”
Tony sighed. “I close my eyes and see fucking wormholes. I should at least be able to tell him that.”
Tony paused and raised an eyebrow. “And what if I come anyways? I don't need your permission.”
I’m glad you’re back at the compound, I don’t like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I’ve been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere – even in the Army. My faith is in people, I guess. Individuals. And I’m happy to say for the most part, they haven’t let me down. Which is why I can’t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but – maybe they shouldn’t. I know I hurt you Tony. I guess I thought – by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but… I can see now I was really sparing myself. I’m sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you were only doing what you believe in, and that’s all any of us can do, it’s all any of us should. So no matter what, I promise if you -- if you need us. If you need me, I’ll be there.
Thor leaving Loki with them hadn’t made a lot of sense until now. Loki was a child. No wonder Thor had wanted to leave his kid brother somewhere safe.
“Credits?”
“I still did it,” Loki exclaimed.
“I don’t care,” she announced, “you’re my new best friend Loki.”
Still, he took Wanda from Vision. Loki felt a warm hand brush through his hair. “Come on Lo,” Natasha cooed, “let's get you to bed. Sam’s out in the yard with Bucky, and I don’t want to have to carry you.”
“First I’d like to help Sam with his work at the VA,” she answered. “but later I would like to help treat the mental health of super enhanced and individuals like the Avengers.”
“White Wolf!”
“But what about your family,” Wanda demanded.
Happy glared at the gift box in Peter’s hand as they arrived at the ranch house. “I don’t think that’s going to impress her bud,” Happy informed him.
So the Black Widow became part of Peter Parker’s life.
“Well it’s considered to be not as good,” Sam answered, “and everyone would rather see it in the theater, but theater isn’t exactly cheap and everything on Broadway is in New York, or it stops running, so stuff happens.”
Wanda looked down at the pamphlets she was given her eyes scanning it and she feels Tony shift and the air in the room turns stale and as she looks up Tony is already on his feet a fist in his hand. Tony looked up at the guy unimpressed his other hand held out in front of Wanda who the punch was aimed for.
“Heimdall sent us into the city,” Thor answered, “and then Loki teleported us here.”
Steve’s eyebrows raised. “First of all, I had nothing to do with it,” Tony announced, “from what I’ve gathered is that Rhodey and Sam did this behind our back and we are the only ones not involved.”
Loki shrugged. Sam prepared for a bad day the next day, but besides a few melancholy moments they were ok. A week later before bed Sam sat on his bed staring at his and Rylie’s wedding rings and the photo of them.
Sam: Be dressed and out of bed before we arrive.
Scott shrugged. “Kids need a loving stable environment with their entire family giving them support. She has plenty here, but from what I get neither of you got closure with each other in general and while her perception of you has been turned on its head she’s being forced to realize that she wants something different and that makes her moody and scared. And I love this kid as a little sister, so you fix your mess with Steve so that you can fix your mess with her.”
When Sam pieced himself together he whipped away his tears. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you,” he told her hanging his head.
“It’s not a big deal Mom,” Sam answered.
Clint’s face scrunched and he sighed to Bucky. “Did he just say he doesn’t drink anymore?”
“I knew I liked you for a reason,” Natasha answered as Loki said, “I don’t understand how can toast be a country?”
Natasha sighed. “It’s not your fault,” she waved him away, “it’s probably better that we have a  clean slate to work with Tony isn’t the best at hand to hand. Want to come Sam?”
“Why do you do this to me,” Bucky whined.
“Didn’t you know that Steve was taking college classes,” Bucky stated, “the fan people have been aware for months.”
“My point stands,” Bucky answered flicking Steve's nose.
Tony had seen Steve around gay couples and his eyes had burned with such fire, but sometimes Tony caught Steve giving him lustful looks. It pissed Tony off because he couldn’t tell if Steve was secretly homophobic or had a secret crush on him and he was a genius so he should be able to figure it out, but he couldn’t. And as they sat on the couch together after months of wondering Tony finally gave in to his curiosity and lust. Consequences be damned.
“Leave a note next time,” Natasha ordered harshly.
Bucky stared down the street disinterested. It wasn’t a particularly busy night, but it wasn’t dull either. Natalia was inside patrolling, Clint was bartending, Wanda was running the coffee shop downstairs and Scott was fixing something on the roof.
Rhodey walked over and slipped a hand over Peter’s mouth. “Well, I haven’t seen my kid in about a year,” Scott stated, “so if you don’t mind, I’d like to get to her?”
“And there are different practices to study?”
She started to sob all over again. Clint brushed her hair and cooed gently. “If we had a problem with it,” Clint informed her, “we would have told you sooner. A family can’t get too big and I can’t imagine my life without you now.”
Keeping his story in mind Steve answered, “not really. My wife did most of the cooking, but I gotta step up now.”
Sam looked up and as result, Alex nailed him in the head with a pen. Sam ignored Alex watching Loki rush into the room. “Lo,” he exclaimed and couldn’t stop the smile from spreading onto his face and pulled him into a hug.
Bucky shrugged. “My job is to make sure Steve doesn’t die,” he explained as he eyed Tony.
Natasha shrugged and left the room. Sam followed after her. The next morning Sam was showing Darcy and Jane around his house. They were busy shoving things into his closet. Damn it. “Please put my toaster back,” Sam requested, “I will teach him how to use it.”
“I’m making a very large anonymous donation to Midtown High,” Tony answered, “if that kid and any of his classmates are that smart than they deserve the best equipment money can buy.”
Steve’s mind flashed to Bucky and how Bucky would love this place more than sin. The man who had swung him into dancing pouted, “you’re taken.”
“Hi,” Loki greeted.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed, “not the worst though. Rylie and I slept on rocks in Afghanistan.”
“The infirmary,” Sam answered.
“Because you’d be lost without him,” Steve answered taking the seat across from Tony.
“Vermont legalized it while we were on leave. One of the first fifty homosexual couples to get married in the United States,” Sam admitted.
“Peter that’s the first time I’ve seen someone keep up with Shuri without a struggle,” Bucky answered.
The words hurt to say and the understanding and anger that came across his families’ faces told him he wasn’t alone. “Of course,” Gideon agreed, “anything else?”
“Thanks,” Bucky told him before leaning in to kiss Steve.
Loki sniffed it and put it down. “What are my mimosas not good enough for you,” Natasha demanded in the way that Sam knew she was teasing.
Sam heard the grief in Loki’s voice and remembered that he to had lost his spouse, lost two wives. That Loki would understand his grief.
“Thank god for ex-girlfriends,” Tony snickered.
When the morning light drifted into the bedroom Loki turned his head to see Sam sitting on the ground leaning against the bed sleeping. Loki turned over and tapped the top of his head. “Bucky I’m going to slap you,” Sam groaned, “and if you make that Toy Story joke again about your arm I’ll slap you with it.”
Loki shoved the blankets away. “Grief is troubling and permanent,” Loki stated, “I’m sorry that you are suffering through that.”
“We’re you two suppose to come over today,” Wanda asked leaning against the hospital bed.
Natasha picked up the plate of cookies and put it in Loki's hand. He followed her down the hall to the main parlor. “There’s my favorite Niece! Welcome home!”
“Who the fuck is this guy again. He looks familiar.”
Steve
The blond man slapped the boy and a crack sounded through the air as the boy fell. “Say it.”
Peter grabbed his bag and scrambled after her. “Wait you’re going to be training me,” Peter squeaked.
In the shower, Loki watched the water cascade down and he slipped down with it until he was sitting against the wall. Then he let himself cry, letting the sound of the running water mask the sound of his muffled sobs.
He read the article and groaned. He texted Sam.
Loki shook his head no. Definitely not. He was hoping to keep the broth down. “Alright,” Sam said handing over the glass full of water. “I’m going to make a snack, you can stay or go.”
Loki sniffled. “Ok,” he agreed.
“Good. I want to meet my grandchild properly,” she announced.
Wanda smiled. “Still missing grandkids,” Fury declared impatiently.
Peter nodded. “Sure,” he agreed, “I love pie! Well I love all food, and I kind of have a really high metabolism after the spider bite, and before I tried to hide that, because it’s not like May and I had a ton of money and she didn’t know of course,” he prattled following her into the house, “so I wasn’t really eating the best, and then Tony started to let me hang around and he noticed my eating habits even though I was still trying to hide it, but it’s all good now Dad worked out my dietary plan which helps a looot and he made this cool little energy bar things that work as great snacks because of all the calories and that helps, and they taste okay but not fantastic, right? So I eat a ton. Food I always good.”
He caught her even though she barreled into him full force. “I don’t like to be touched” he complained holding onto her tighter.
Truth. Despite the closeness of the Compound, it wasn’t personal. “Everyone has a house here,” Tony announced, “well except Cap and his boy toy, I didn’t think they would ever want to be apart. And everyone has their own room in the main house. That’s where Peter, Pepper, and I will live. Peter has a house here to when he’s ready to leave and you do of course, but I was thinking you should stay in the Big House until more of the others arrive if that’s ok.”
She gently tugged him away. Everyone followed. Natasha almost felt bad for Thor the confusion and desperation that was clear on his features, but she didn’t have time to pity him, she had a child with Sam who needed her to keep him safe from his past and his own mind. So Natasha had no pity. She had only rage that the older brother had refused to see how broken the younger was.
“Sorry Bucky,” Steve apologized his voice full of worry and anger.
He started to thrash and Natasha immediately slid into the water pulling him into his arms and holding him still. “It hurts,” he sobbed.
“I know,” Peter answered rolling his eyes.
Then she hung up. Wanda fell back onto her bed and let the tears slip down freely. Damn Clint. It was unfair. Why did he have to act so fatherly one minute and then go and remind her that he would never actually fill that role for her? And damn her for thinking he might actually want to. And damn her do thinking she deserved a normal family. And damn her for wanting that. And damn her for crying over all this shit when she should just be happy to be alive and safe and have a strange little-broken family that as trying to figure itself out.
“You never told me you could draw.”
Peter felt himself bounce with excitement. “And this one,” Rhodey announced pulling the last book out of Peter’s lap with a fond smile, “is your Dad’s first chemistry book from MIT.”
The plate dropped to the ground as Peter gasped. “Sometimes Tony really is a genius,” Sam announced, “plastic plates. Who knew?”
Tony’s eyes snapped over to the other man. “You..do?”
“Yes,” Peter agreed, “It’s heck.”
“Tony. Get out,” Bucky said for the doorway.
“No problem,” Bucky chuckled, “you need anything you call.”
Steve smiled and grabbed Bucky’s hand and kissed it. “Alright,” he agreed.
Pepper entered the room. “Hey Mom,” Peter called testing the new word on his tongue.
Loki looked at the black man. Sam. He said his name was Sam Wilson. Loki looked at Sam. He was radiating nervous energy and confusion. Not like Bruce did. No Sam looked like he was about to defuse a bomb. Well, Loki supposed he was a bomb. He could kill him. He could kill him with a flick of his wrist. Except the spell prevented him from hurting anything here. From using his magic to teleport. And Thor had the spell adjusted so was trapped here. He couldn’t take anyone hostage to escape because that would hurt them.
Clint saw him and walked over. “Did a minor slip in” he inquired yelling over the volume.
Steve Rogers, the annoying little ass that he is, bought a bar in France. Bucky has always said he wanted to be a civilian in France and that still tickled his fancy now. T’Challa gave Bucky the best therapy he could find and Shuri had a million test to make sure the programming was gone and the arm was perfect.
Steve felt Bucky tense and his finger dug into Steve’s hips. “Loki fought with us valiantly to save our people,” Thor announced, “and has turned away from the side of darkness to the side of light. He is a deviant god, but not an evil one. We have rekindled our relationship. I’m afraid though that Loki is well known across the galaxy, and while he has served Asgard diligently for hundreds of years as a diplomat and negotiator I am afraid he has his own share of enemies, some of which I created for him.”
“Thanks, R5,” Ned exclaimed.
“Cool,” Wanda agreed finding the spoons and handing one over to Peter, “what are we watching?”
Steve laughed. “Did he just meme?” Tony questioned.
“After Natasha left,” Steve explained and pulled Bucky off the quinjet leaving Tony to follow, “we decided to go sightseeing. Vision gave us a few recommendations for some great places in Europe.”
“Pepper has a few dealings to finish this afternoon,” Tony answered.
Steve blushed and the man laughed. “All the pretty ones are, except for me,” his head tilted back, “it’s in the eyes.”
“Perimeter,” Bucky answered.
Loki was seventeen, had six children and two wives who were all killed by his father. “Wait how old is Thor supposed to be then,” Clint demanded walking in.
Lilia ran off again and Wanda stared at the picture. Laura still looked worried clasping Wanda’s hand in her own and Wanda pulled herself together.
T’Challa rolled his eyes. “Hello, Baby Bird.”
Cho instructed Natasha to put Peter in another awaiting ice bath to keep his temperature from rising which it had been doing. Natasha cursed something strong. Which made Peter cry out so she forced herself to calm and stay next to him.
Settled in? What was that supposed to mean? “I know who is in charge now,” Loki answered.
“Yes,” Bucky answered the same time Steve said, “no” and Tony answered, “maybe.”
Tony called at lunch which was nice even if they had been texting all day and Aunt May called right after and Pepper called at dinner. Peter fell asleep watching Star Trek with his head in Natasha’s lap while she pet his hair which okay was so not normal but it was relaxing so who cared.
He shook his head at her. “It’s still Rhodey, not Colonel” he answered passing over a cookie with a smirk “Pepper is in the screening room picking out a movie for us to watch.”
Eventually Bucky and Tony had decided to work in their relationship together which delighted Steve so the pair started to hang out more. And then they were hanging out as a group and it was nice. They laughed a lot and got into small little fights (the playful kind), and they cuddled on the couch sometimes because they were all touched starved.
Tony sucked in a deep breath. “I mean you have two weird new in-laws and Clint really wants to see his wife and kids, but,” Bucky’s voice trailed off, “they all feel like their Dads had a fight during Thanksgiving and they got split up during the custody battle.”
He watched Tony stare at Spider-Man’s webbing. “Check the internet Cap or the group chat Clint sent a whole article link.”
“Thor didn’t know,” Sam confirmed taking his hand which was as cold as ice, but that didn’t concern him.
And Loki’s subconscious had chosen a form that could pass for Sam’s son. Loki strolled out of the room and started to play Kidz bop again. Sam called Steve and started to complain. Steve was unsympathetic.
“Alright,” she declared, “in the car. You can’t be late.”
“Who said I’m going to MIT?”
The video repeated for the twentieth time. Sam now understood his Sister’s half dead expression when his niece demanded to watch the same episode of Blue's Clues again.
She laughed and brought him into her arms. “Go to sleep, you all have a press conference tomorrow.”
Steve looked over Thor’s face. “My eyes? What happened to your eye?”
His eyes flickered to Rhodey and now that it seemed to be clear that this wasn’t going to turn into a fight he asked softly, “how are you holding up?”
Mj snorted. “What,” Natasha demanded.
Tony handed him the paper and looked at the next one.
The screen went blank and Steve buried himself into Bucky’s arms. “I am so stupid.”
Before Loki could reply Sam arrived setting a different plate in front of him and taking the plate he had prepared himself away. “Loki,” Sam sighed sitting down, “why did you grab a plate full of meat?”
Tony gapped behind his back at where Bucky must have gone off to and then went into his plane. On the plane ride back to New York he got the best sleep he had in a year. Peter greeted him on top of the tower. He jumped off the hammock and ran over. “Dad,” he exclaimed, “omg you would not believe what happened like an hour ago. It was so cool!”
The men came tromping up. Sam held his breath waiting to see if Loki would react negatively. He didn't even look overwhelmed. Thank god the Avengers were crazy. “When did you get a kid,” Rubert demanded looking down at Loki.
“That’s mighty forward of your bae Sam.”
Bucky laughed. “How about I help you with cartwheels in an hour?”
“You see an actual theater production outside of the theater,” Loki scoffed.
So he could leave his cell. Good to know. But what was a F.R.I.D.A.Y? It didn’t sound like he was talking about the Midgardian weekday. “Oh,” Sam exclaimed reading his face, “ F.R.I.D.A.Y is one of Tony’s AI’s.  F.R.I.D.A.Y say hi to Loki.”
He took a selfie of them in front of the banner kissing Steve’s ring. Then he posted it on Twitter.
He got up and leaned over the railing. “Bucky you finish up and go wash up,” he yelled down.
Bucky rolled his eyes at him and climbed up onto the bed. “What,” he asked confused, “not yours and my anniversary Steve. Our anniversary with Tony.”
“Sure,” Bucky agreed without thought handing his phone over.
“You haven’t seen Lord of the Rings yet! How long have you been here,” the Temptress yelled.
Sam groaned again lifting up his head and stretching out his neck. “Good morning Loki,” he greeted.
As Angrboda pointed the man disintegrated with a scream. The generals looked both unimpressed and terrified. “Odin should put a better leash on his pet,” one of them muttered.
Loki looked away from him. “You don’t gotta say anything about that,” Sam announced, “you just have to tell me if you want the plate you got or this one.”
Wanda froze. Clint didn’t even blink. “Geez, it’s like you can’t secretly adopt a kid anymore. Rhodey Bear I can’t believe this! It’s like two grown ass men can’t adopt a child together before people throw a fit about it.”
Sam obeyed. “Sam is going to wrap his arms around us,” Natasha announced.
Sam bit his lip. “So what do we owe the pleasure of this call?”
Sam took the jewelry box out of his bag. “You're not getting married,” she stated as she noticed it.
The boy flinched and looked down at his feet before tilting his head back proudly. “My name is Loki Odinson of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose!”
Sam smiled slightly. “It’s better than just the sweater and sweatpants.”
As November hit them Sam got a call from his mother. They were a pretty close family, but he did tend to be the oddball, especially when he moved out of DC. “I booked your ticket for the flight home,” she announced when he picked up, “and don’t tell me you aren’t coming home for Thanksgiving.”
Tony gave him a sympathetic look. “Don’t worry about it. You’ll find your hubby and if you don’t you can be mine!”
Peter blushed. “Thanks, Steve!”
Bucky shrugged. “It was my body that did it. So didn’t I do it? Wasn’t it my fault for succumbing to them? Maybe there was a way I could have fought Hydra off.”
Wanda hid her disappointment. “So how does it feel to be Tony Stark’s Niece,” he asked wiggling his eyebrows.
Bucky looked down at Loki and dropped the blanket in his lap before going over to Steve and climbing on top of him. Steve sighed and stretched out his body to get more comfortable.
Plot? What's plot? Help. XD. Let me know what you think! <3
Steve got up from the table and laid down next to him on the ground and propped up his head on his elbow watching Bucky’s face. “Yeah Buck,” he answered.
Loki flinched. “I’m sorry Master,” Loki cried out his forehead bobbing to the floor with a rough sob “I’ll be better, I’ll be better. I promise! I promise! Please, Master.”
Sam nodded once and Bucky tossed him a pen, which Tony didn’t even know was thrown until Steve caught it. Without any other thought, Steve signed and Tony felt his breath leave him. “Sam remind me to sign up for civil laws classes once we get pardoned in the states and get home,” he requested.
Sam resisted the urge to facepalm. “That’s Bucky”, Sam informed him, “and they are engaged. It’s not really considered polite to call someone a bedmate.”
Sam nodded. Natasha shooed Tony and Bruce out. “Bruce was just being whiny,” she complained dumping a bag of grease onto the bed Loki was occupying, “he knew what he was doing just fine.”
“Believe it or not some people think I’m a genius,” Tony answered holding up the bottle.
“Because Nat has her own family to spend time with,” Sam answered, “and we aren’t dating.”
“Then you shouldn’t neglect it,” Sam answered.
“Why?” Sam asked.
“They’ve changed a lot since Bucky and I were born,” Steve stated, “remind me to show you a silent picture.”
Except, that week Pepper and Tony were out of town and then Aunt May had a family emergency in Nebraska with like a third cousin Peter had never met before, but May didn’t want him coming with. And Ned got grounded so he couldn’t stay with Ned so Peter flitted around the living room while Aunt May talked with Tony.
Steve and Bucky left after dinner and Wanda arrived with a baby cactus. “Hi Lo,” she greeted as Loki peered around Sam who was opening the door.
Scott stopped inspecting the bottle. “What? No! I’m pretty sure Steve’s in love with you though I’m not sure how that works when he’s dating Bucky, but that’s beside the point. My boss made my suit.”
Sam choked. “And the radio was silent until I landed in safety and there was a small crack. ‘The Hawk is down and Falcon is clipped.’
Scott and Clint continued down the hallway starting to bicker. Bucky got up and stepped over to Steve. He cupped the other man’s cheek and stroked it with his thumb. “Your numbers in my phone and on the fridge, I’ll text you tonight, send me blackmail pictures,” Bucky demanded.
Loki smiled. She was a kind but snarky temptress and he enjoyed her voice.
You know my name.
“What’s that questions,” Bucky asked.
Loki obeyed watching the spy close the book before retrieving the hairbrush that was kept in the kitchen for some reason. She hummed softly as she brushed. “More people are coming here today,” she announced, “Clint and Rhodey’s daughter Wanda is going to come home with her boyfriend Vision.”
Sam grunted. “You’re such a Mom,” he gave in.
Tony gapped. Bucky chuckled softly. “Sounds rough, I know. It kind of was. But that’s also Steve. He doesn’t really tell people things. It doesn’t matter what it is, but if you don’t ask about it or it’s not important at the moment he won’t ever bring it up. It doesn’t occur to him. When I showed up to the funeral he just looked at me and ‘said hi Buck’ like he had no idea he never told me anything.”
He said goodbye and hugged Wanda again. Then he exited the bar with Bucky on his heels. When Black Widow tells you to do something you don’t question it.
Clint called that night and they talked about the day. “I’m coming to the states in two weeks,” he announced, “but I’m going to see my family first. It’ll probably be three weeks before I see you kid.”
“Natasha help,” Bruce requested.
“Yes,” Natasha admitted.
That appeared to be the end of the discussion as Pepper got a call and they said their goodbyes. Bucky and Sam didn’t say anything about how they were planning on keeping this behind Steve’s back because it didn’t bother either of them.
“No. You can stay if you want,” Sam answered.
Steve was great because he blushed so easily and he was so pretty when he blushed but he didn’t say anything back, just changed the conversation. Tony could not figure out what Roger's deal was, but it was pissing him off.
Loki shook his head no seeming puzzled. “ ‘kay,” Sam agreed, “I want in on next game.”
Steve once told Sam that the best thing about his big body was that he was big enough to hold Bucky. Now with Loki Sam understood. As Sam held Loki he began to think of something he could take Loki out to do. Nothing extraneous or full of people. Which didn’t really help because Loki’s likes came down to reading, magic, any kind of theater, and gardening. They could just go for a drive, but Sam didn’t want to drag Loki around without some kind of pay off. If it went bad with no positive pay off that wouldn’t do well for anyone. Especially Loki.
Then the video stopped. The title of the video was R5, Peter Parker, and Ned Leeds Winners Of Midtown Highs Fifth Annual Robotics show.
Loki shook his head no. “I can’t,” he choked.
Janie stared and Sam watched her mind work. “But Vermont was the only state to legalize gay marriage before you got back and they wouldn’t let you get hitched overseas.”.
Tony huffed and thrust out his spatula. “I am your father and I will not have this kind of blasphemy in this house young man!”
Loki shrugged. “Typically my magic would naturally fight and redirect this, but since it did not prevent this from happening I would say I could not prevent it. Only bear what was to occur.”
Peter squawked. “How!”
“I thought you were at Steve’s,” Sam muttered.
It was silent for a moment. “I thought you’d be in charge next to Cap being his boyfriend in all,” Tony stated.
Shuri and Tony rolled their eyes. Bucky looked down at Peter and he knew how to get Shuri's attention off of him and please the young girl at the same time. “Oh. Shuri look who’s with us.”
The next day they repeated the cycle. But Loki stayed long enough to help with the dishes. Pretty soon Sam found that he had a demo god following him around wherever he went. Which was fine. That had been the goal. To get Loki comfortable with him.
Sam joined Rhodey in chugging their coffee. He looked at the time. He wanted to give Loki a chance to join them without being prompted, but he was going to have to go get him soon.
“Do you think we can handle more,” Steve asked suddenly.
“He’s exhibiting some pretty extremely symptoms of PTSD,” Rhodey noted.
She pulled them into a hug and Sam kissed the top of her head. “Ah,” she exclaimed, “well come in! Come in. We’ve been waiting!”
“Sleepless in Seattle,” Rhodey answered as Wanda carried the bowl over to Peter before dragging him out of the room before following Pepper’s signature to the theater room.
Bucky and Steve laughed while Peter blushed and stuttered. “Hi,” Peter gulped he looked at Bucky’s arm. “Hey, that’s not the same arm I saw earlier! Which was really cool by the way. What’s this one made of, who made it? It looks like the vibruanim from Cap’s shield. It has to be biocompatible right? What technique is used to connect the nerves?”
“Oh I’m sorry evil Germans capture you and torture you for seventy years and you think it’s your fault,” Tony yelled.
Loki snorted and set the kids down. “Hel,” he instructed, “I want you to cover your brother’s ears and put your face in his fur.”
Steve was eating a hot dog in front of the Captain America Apartment Mesum wearing a red hoodie t-shirt that said I Love Brooklyn.
“Did you know that there is a vigilante in Queens?” Steve asked skipping over that entire conversation.
He smiled proudly. “Dad,” Peter yelled bounding over, “I’ve never seen how far I can throw, but Steve wants to see now. So I’m going to run to the other side of the field so make sure F.R.I.D.A.Y gets it on camera please?”
The smirk on her face told Sam she was pleased with herself. “Even like skin. No one will be able to tell the difference unless they touch it. Next week I’ll finish with the technology that’ll make it actually feel like real skin.”
“May’s phone broke,” she announced, “you’ll have to call Howie Parker to get in contact with her. Peter gets really sick once a year for no reason and is down for about two weeks,” she looked over at Cho assessing her again, “you have Helen Cho here as your doctor right, you’re not a doctor so you can’t do anything. Spend another day or two at your meetings get everything put together, whatever you can’t afford to put off any longer. Peter won’t wake up until then. I’ve already spoken to Miss. Potts about it, she’ll be here tomorrow. Now go to sleep.”
Of course, he did because screw Stark. “Did Stark tell you anything else?” He asked, like how I’m the one who helped make that suit for you or how I have a whole training regiment prepared for you.
Tony set the flowers and vodka down and hugged the other man. Bucky froze at first but slowly hugged back. “We’ll work on it,” Tony promised when he pulled away.
Sam looked him over. “Look at you,” Sam exclaimed, “a day in the gardens and you have light in your eyes and color in your cheeks.”
“Go to hell Tony,” Sam spat.
“What are you supposed to send to him,” Clint asked, “hey moron come get your sad brother. You fucked up and need to fix it.”
Bucky, in fact, did not fight monsters. Nope. Not even close. He played in peaceful and ran a very successful farm and village.
Inside, the bedroom was already a mess, a respectable mess, but a mess still the same. The bed was turned out and Loki felt sick at the idea of climbing inside it. From a door inside the bedroom, a light was on and the shower was going music loudly playing. Loki set the book on the bed, but couldn’t bring himself to get on it. Instead, he went to the center of the room and sunk to his knees fanning them out and lowering his head till his hair touched the ground artfully pooling in front of his face. He placed his hands tightly behind his back and summoned a set of chains in front of him so Thor could tie him up at his leisure. Then Loki the Whore if Asgard waited.
“He said an Mj kidnapped him,” Loki answered.
And your right I’m desperate and scared and I just want to keep everyone safe, but I guess I’ve been that way since I got out of that cave. And I guess I’m scared to rely on others to help me protect them after Yinsen. It always seems like when I’m left to my own devices with the help of others all I cause is death. Maybe that’s what drew me to you. The beauty of your immortality would make it impossible for you to leave me. Then you left. Part of me understood. In my heart, I knew what you were doing and why. I couldn’t accept that though. Typically people leave me because they died and you’re the first one to leave me because of choice.
“Sam you’ve been getting random texts that make you grin all month, we’re happy for you,” Dax stated, “so when do we get to meet the lucky guy?”
He was wearing one of the horrible Christmas sweaters Bucky and Steve had got him, damn them. “What about school,” Sam suggested, “it’ll give you something to do during the day while I am at work and since it’s winter you can’t do much in your garden right now. Peter would go to the same school, Midtown Tech is opening an arts hall. Theater, dancing, music, writing, painting, things like that. Peter thought you might enjoy it.”
