“Hi,” Steve said over Thor’s body, trying to keep on his feet as Thor steered them over to the table, “how did you end up in this situation, then?”
“Dammit,” Steve muttered. He would turn on his navigation, but data was fucking expensive and, as a result, he just… hadn’t bought any. Yes, that meant he was probably the only teenager in New York who went out without instant internet access, but he’d never really needed it. Before now, anyway.
Steve just rolled his eyes as Tony squeezed his butt playfully, digging around in his pocket with his left hand and hugging Tony closer with the other. “You know, you’re lucky you’ve got such an organised boyfriend,” he declared as he found what he was looking for and pulled it out of his pocket, waving it in Tony’s eyeline. “I even got it strawberry flavoured. Your favourite.”
“Ugh,” Steve rolled his eyes and then let them shut again as Tony’s hand moved to brush the hairs off his forehead, “long week, more like.”
“-Then I don’t care,” Steve mumbled, rolling his body so that he was draped entirely over Tony. He kept his head tucked into the warm body next to him, mouth moving down to Tony’s neck and over to his sternum as his hands lifted to Tony’s wrists, essentially pinning him down to the bed.
“He didn’t hit me, I told you, I swear this wasn’t… it wasn’t intentional okay, you know he wouldn’t,” Steve held out his hands and stepped forward, pushing Bucky’s door closed again. He hurried quickly over to the passenger seat and slipped inside, looking at Bucky with a tired sort of smile. “Thank you for picking me up, by the way.”
“-Yeah, Steve, surprisingly enough that wouldn’t have been my chosen method of transport either,” Tony had snapped back at him as he’d begun to unzip the tattered undersuit, covered in tears from where his body had rolled across the concrete, “unfortunately I didn’t have much choice.”
“Of course,” Tony nodded and then, using all the willpower he could muster, pulled away and turned back to the trousers now lying across his desk. He yanked them on hastily and then picked up the buckle, looping it through the holes with slightly shaky hands. Caffeine deprivation, that was what it was- he just needed a triple espresso to wake him up and he’d be raring to go. “How do I look?”
Of course, at those words, a cheeky little grin spread across Steve’s face, and he looked down at Tony, who was nestled safely in his arms, and cocked his eyebrow. “Oh really?”
“How does someone exactly get ready to fight an intergalactic army intent on wiping out half of the universe?”
Steve turned to face him and backhanded him across the face so quickly that  Tony didn’t even see the hand fly.
He blinked. Looked down at his leg. Shuffled it a little. It ached, hurt when he moved it too far, but there was no agony. No seeping wound, messily bandaged by Bruce and left out in the freezing cold.
He put a hand to the door when he reached it and took a small breath. “Steve?” He called out tentatively, “Steve, sweetheart, it’s me. Tony. Iron Man. I’m coming in now, okay?”
When Room 7 loomed into view, Steve took a deep breath and then gingerly placed his hand around the doorknob leading to the observation deck. He turned his head just a little to the left and noted the next door along. Should he go through that one, he’d come face to face with Tony, inevitably sat shackled to the table in the interrogation room. As it was, Steve would be one the other side of the two-way mirror, blessed with invisibility.
He squeezed Tony’s ass, smiling as the man groaned softly, and then couldn’t help but laugh in amusement as he listened to the shuffling sounds of his friends hastily backing out of the room. “Please don’t have sex in the hospital,” Bruce pleaded with them as the door swung back open again.
Steve just… wasn’t worth that much trouble. He wasn’t like Tony- he wasn’t cool and he didn’t make everyone laugh and he wasn’t popular- he was nobody.
Steve couldn’t help but grimace a little. He didn’t like Tony’s friends. They weren’t real- that much was obvious from the get-go. And Tony always wound himself tighter around them. They were just… bad.
Because at that moment, a lorry veered around the corner and skidded next to the curb, sending a sheet of freezing cold water directly toward Steve.
“-No,” Steve told him firmly, his hand beginning to wipe very gently across Tony’s hair, sweeping up the moisture, “I’m not leaving unless you’re absolutely sure that you’ll be okay and you don’t actively want me to be here, alright? Until then, I’m going to sit here and clean you up, and I’m going to make sure you’re safe.”
“Man,” Bucky swallowed and looked down, “I’m so sorry. You must’a put up a heck of a fight for it, though.”
Susan took him in. He hadn’t washed the blood off his hand from where the sink edges had punctured the skin. He was shaking. He didn’t even want to think about how his face looked.
Steve knew by that point that Tony smoked for a myriad of reasons. To focus. To forget. To calm his nerves. He figured the reason for this one was the latter; because when he took the cigarette to his lips, Steve noted the tiny stutter of his hands.
Fifteen minutes later, the car turned into one of the grandest driveways Steve had ever laid eyes on, and he wondered if it was too late to reconsider Tony’s offer of having him get patched up there.
Steve looked at him for a good, long while before tentatively closing his fingers around Tony’s wrist, terrified of the answer he would receive from it. But it was okay. There was a pulse. Tony was alive.
This time it was Steve who handed him the new cartridge, standing up from his position opposite both Bucky and Tony and then walking over, taking Tony by the shoulder. “Stay with us,” he said shortly, letting his hand linger against the juncture of Tony’s neck before slipping away again to retrieve his shield from the corner of the room.
Something sounded up above him, a strange sort of crackling noise, and Steve looked up hastily, eyes widening as he clocked the strange bright light that was hurtling toward them. For a second he thought it might be a meteor, but it was moving too erratically for that, and… it looked sort of like a person. Natasha had seen it too, and their sadness turned into battle-mode, both of them reaching for their weapons as the bright light careered down toward them.
“It was hardly a mistake,” Tony said, his voice cold and damning, “Or if it was, then it was about a hundred successive mistakes. Starting from you knocking on my door by mistake. Then moving on to you telling me you were a PI by mistake. Then telling me you still loved me, again, by
The AI remained silent for a moment, before there was a flat, “understood.” Tony nodded to himself, feeling the pain behind his eyes when he tried to remember how to get the repulsors to fire up. Nothing was coming to him… yet. It would. Once he was in the air and he didn’t have a choice, it would.
“Uhhh, guys?” Clint called out from across the Penthouse, and everyone turned to him in question. He held up his arm, now with a Peter attached to the back of it. “He’s latched on again. How do you get him off?”
He wasn’t sure who’s voice that was- Tony’s or Bucky’s. There were images in the back of his eyes that didn’t fit the surroundings, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
“It was always going to happen eventually,” Thor answered carefully, when he became aware Steve wasn’t going to. “It doesn’t matter what caused it. Point is, there’s no going back from it.”
Steve paused, and smiled softly, dragging a stray piece of Tony’s hair back and then pressing a kiss to the space it left. “And- well- you’re my best fella. Seems like they belong to you more than me, now.”
Tony’s smile, if even physically possible, grew bigger. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone has ever told me,” he said, holding out a hand for Steve to take, “now can you please take my hand and let me escort you to the vehicle?”
Peter stopped, and then sighed, trying to find the words. “Tony is… weird,” he said in the end. When Steve just raised an eyebrow, the kid hurried to elaborate. “I mean- he’s so… around his so-called buddies, y’know? But then he’s there with us, and he’s… well, you know.”
He wanted to fucking tear them off. Wanted, for the first time, to be pathetic and weak again. That would have kept Tony at least a little bit safer. Given him an extra fraction of autonomy. He could have pushed Steve off every time he pulled Tony in at night, could have fought back when Steve hit him. As it was, Tony had been helpless.
He shoved his way out of the doors, stepping out into cool morning air and feeling his skin pebble with goosebumps. Then he sighed. “Fuck, I forgot the keys—”
Tony stared at him, mouth opening and closing wordlessly as the rest of the team began to jog out of the room and over to the armory. The words rung in his ears, like Steve had screamed them out to him.
But Tony shrugged breezily, the excuse already on his tongue. “Just because I don’t like kids doesn’t mean I’m an asshole to them. I wanted to make sure he was happy during his short stay at the Avengers Tower. I’m a good host like that.”
“Shut the fuck up, loser,” the bigger guy spat on him, actually fucking spat on him, and then punched him in the mouth for good measure, “this’ll teach you not to talk shit about people who are gonna be more than you ever will. The fuck were you even talking about- Ty’s a fuckin’ beast, he’s got people fallin’ at his feet.”
Tony paused for a moment, before jerking to life with a nod and a finger-point in Steve’s direction. “Right! Yes, because I was… doing that, yes, okay, going-“ he started walking back again, not bothering to turn around in favor of keeping his gaze fixed on Steve. The amazed look of disbelief was still flitting around in his eyes as he watched Steve grin back at him.
the team. And if he no longer had that going for him… well, it seemed unlikely they’d want to just hang out with him anyway.
Steve just squinted. “I… I mean, I thought. You know. You would be getting outta here… without me. Eye for an eye, and all that.”
There were a million things he wanted to say to that, but he wasn’t sure how to convey it without getting angry—not at Tony, but at the situation itself. It was just so unfair. Of course, though, Tony took his silence for agreement and Steve watched him avert his gaze, shuffling a little further away on the cramped mattress almost subconsciously. Steve quickly saw to halting that, however; pulling him back in and rolling him smoothly up onto his chest. When Tony looked mildly surprised by the action, Steve just leaned up and kissed him. The moonlight from outside shone in through their cracked-open window, illuminating the other man in a soft white glow. He looked almost ethereal like that.
“Tony!” One of them yelled, hurrying forward. She was wearing a huge fur… thing, and ridiculous pink heels as she scurried over and threw her arms around him, embracing him in a hug that he returned with a laugh. “Tony, what a surprise! Sweetie, it’s been so long! Months and months- God, when was the last time-“
Steve hummed happily again, tilting his head and once more nuzzling Tony’s cheek. Tony let him, and even nuzzled back a little, just to hear Steve do his weird purring thing again. It was kind of cute. In a super weird way.
So he stumbles upright and Steve steadies him, firm and strong and warm as he always is. Tony isn’t particularly aware of where he’s going, because Steve pretty much just carries him the whole way there and Tony is fine with just letting his head fall against Steve’s shoulder and stay there. Possibly for the rest of his life. He wouldn’t complain.
“Come inside,” he said a few moments later, pulling away with a final light press of lips, “we’ll hang out at Bucky’s for a few hours and then go home, how does that sound?”
“I’m gonna ask you this, and it’s gonna be blunt as fuck, but I need to know that he hasn’t just treated my best friend like shit for no reason,” Bucky began, eyes on the road as his fingers moved and put Rhodey’s voice on loudspeaker, “Rhodey, do you think Tony has some sort of PTSD that stems from the abuse he got from his dad? Or any other sort of issue like that.”
“Oh, be quiet, you donut,” Rhodey chastised, smacking him delicately on the chest, “you don’t need to keep it together. Not for me, or anyone.”
“We’ll need to arrange a funeral,” Clint said dully, at some point in the night, “he’ll… he’ll have had contingency plans, a will, too.”
His phone pinged, and he pulled it from his pocket without thinking, checking the number briefly. Then he stopped. Looked again. Looked some more.
, Steve wanted to say, except his mouth didn’t agree with him, and so nothing came out. The world was fading around him, and he wanted to fight it, preserve this memory of having Tony holding him, but the urge to just
“That’s the point.” He waved a hand. “I’m fixing it. And it won’t matter if I die, because I will never have existed in the first place.”
Steve brushed it off, because it wasn’t Tony’s fault. He could see how much it worried him- how hard he tried to keep Steve out of it. He’d figured that had been the reason for why Tony didn’t treat him like anything more than a close friend when they were out in public. He just hadn’t wanted Steve to get hounded by the press. It had seemed like the only explanation.
Steve hadn’t known it then, but when he woke up the next day on a Friday morning and got ready to go to school all over again, he was never going to be able to forget what happened in the next 24 hours.
Steve smiled faintly to himself and leaned down to spit, popping the brush back into its little container. As he straightened his back up again, he felt something tighten painfully once more in his chest and winced, hand covering his heart as the other went to the sink to steady him. He figured that it was taking his body a little while to work its way back to normal, and so until it did his heart was just having a spasm or two every now and then. Not overly serious; probably just a valve that had been tightened by the electrical pulse, but nothing that wouldn’t be fixed over the next forty eight hours or so while the serum worked its magic. If it hadn’t gone in a few days or so, he’d let someone know. But until then, he wasn’t going to worry too much.
Tony smiled softly; pressing a kiss against Steve’s cheek and then turning back to the view. Steve knew they had to start heading back soon- they must have been gone more than an hour, and it was definitely considered rude to just abandon your guests at your own birthday party, but-
Steve cut him off as he jumped forward, wrapped his arms around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him into a fierce hug. He could feel the painful sting behind his eyes, so he buried his head in Tony’s shoulder and clenched them shut, feeling Tony as his own arms wrapped slightly desperately around Steve’s waist and then pulled him closer.
Peter’s future was starting to look bleaker and bleaker by the second, and Tony had no Goddamn idea what to do about it.
Tony just hummed and waved a hand. “Don’t need it,” he said, which was true. He was working on a research-high, and it was keeping his body and mind constantly moving. “You about to go on your run?”
She tugged at her hair and folded her arms, looking at Tony with the same face that Tony had pulled so many times on Steve that it made him have to stifle his laughter. He doubted Tony would even last three seconds before caving.
Steve glanced over to Bucky, and his eyes were rolling, but when they focused back on Steve, he looked uncharacteristically soft. A hand brushed playfully through his hair, before stopping at the back of his neck. “You sure about that?” Bucky asked him lightly, raising an eyebrow. Double checking. Always looking out, just in case.
“You think?” Rhodey pressed, voice getting harder, “why did you leave if you only ‘thought’ he was okay-“
Tony saw him in the days after, when he was laid up in bed with a pained expression, breath coming in shallow as he tried to breathe through four broken ribs. Tony saw him bleed the same as any other soldier, red and deep and deadly. He’d put his fingers over stab-wounds to stop the otherwise fatal flow, sat by his side as Steve hovered on the line between life and death. And yeah, Steve healed faster, was harder to hurt. But that by no means meant that he didn’t. He put himself in more danger than anyone on planet Earth, constantly jumping in front of bullets to stop others getting hurt, signing himself up for painful missions that would push him to the edge, simply because he was the only one who
He’d been about to sigh in relief, but at the additional words, Steve held off on that action in order to stare at the other man, his brows drawing together. “I’m not that much of an asshole,” he responded shortly, “just because he’s my ex-fiancé doesn’t mean I wish ill of him. He’s a good—”
the last word was spat with such disgust, and JARVIS’ audio picked up his feet as they clacked down the hall, got closer.
Rather than look even remotely relieved, it seemed Tony only grew more miserable. “Okay,” he said quietly, eyes firmly on the floor and jaw in an impossibly tight clench. “I understand. I… thank you for just trying this long, Steve. I didn’t deserve that. I’m just- I’m sorry for putting you through th-“
“Steve,” this time it was Thor’s voice, low and serious as he rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder, “if we take him to the hospital, it won’t take long for word to get out. And right now, when Tony’s in this state and we don’t have a plan of action against Howard, it’ll give the bastard a head start that could ruin any chance Tony has of coming out as the victim here. You don’t understand how much power that man holds. Bad press could ruin him.”
Tony just sighed, leaning his head against the headrest. He could feel his heart beating, too fast and too loud under his ribs. It ached against the bottom of his reactor, but he focused instead on Steve’s firm grip against his leg. His hand was warm. It was nice. He still wanted that fucking Martini, and the need was sitting uncomfortably on his tongue. He was sure he’d never used to get this stressed out and anxious when he’d had alcohol to ease the way.
extent when he’d actually believed Steve had put him in hospital of his own volition, really. Abuse, like everything else, was just another part of life, and he should have learned how to handle it better by that point. But Tony was just—weak. He cried too easily, always had done, no matter how many times his father had tried to ‘train it out of him’.
He sniffed and leaned forward, carefully brushing the flecks of dirt off the stone. Pulled out the weeds that had begun sprouting around her grave. Cleaned it up, nice and neat, just the way mom liked it. Had liked it.
“I do not think about making out with him in the… you should- I- shut up,” he snapped, folding his arms and then promptly burying his head into them whilst his friends just wolf whistled and cheered around him.
Steve himself decided he should probably start looking for a cab rather than just standing around watching Tony, so he glanced into the road and held up a hand. “One week,” he agreed with a nod, “I love you t—”
“Buce!” Peter seemed to be having an absolute ball, with his new words, mouth split into a beam as he bashed his hands into Steve’s chest. “Buce, Seev, Seev, Seev!”
Steve just rolled his eyes and smiled over at Tony again before looking down at his food. “You’ll understand one day, kid,” he said earnestly, patting Clint on the shoulder. Clint just harrumphed and shoved him off with a sullen pout, muttering something about ‘totally being able to score more dates than you Cap, shut your mouth’.
about what I’ve done,” Tony lurched forward on the table, throwing his words angrily at Steve like they were weapons in themselves. But a second later after a truly cowering glare, Tony composed himself again. He sat back in his chair and turned his head away once more, the only indication of his distress being the heaving of his chest. Steve watched as a single tear slipped out of his eye, unable to be held back. Steve followed the path it made down his cheek, collecting in the hairs of his beard.
Tony stared down at the data on his tablet with a deep frown and a worry-bitten lip. On the screen, scans of his own brain and closeups of his limbic system, his hypothalamus, all the weird mushy stuff that Bruce had been explaining to him earlier but Tony had been a little too exhausted to listen to, all planted themselves on the tablet’s surface in a freaky sort of clarity. It sparked some bits up in a worrying red, and he read the captions with a deepening sense of foreboding. He hated getting brain scans for this exact reason.
Thor leaned down and said something in his ear, and Tony looked up at him for a moment before nodding a little and turning back to Steve. “Are you- are you sure? I can go if you want, I’m not-“
“You’re made of stardust, y’know. Before you became you, and before the world even existed- you were pure stardust. Everything we touch and breathe and exist from is just the remnant of stars, and the gases and elements they created,” Tony whispers into the silent room, watching Steve’s chest rise, in and out and in and out. “The chances of that stardust managing to create you- Steven Grant Rogers- are so
“If HYDRA find us here, we are all dead,” Tony snapped, “If you can get down back to civilisation and call for help before they arrive, then everyone might come out of this alive.”
And that left the one thing that AIM had truly set all this up for. It left Peter, unguarded, in the one place where not a single Avenger could get to. It was a pretty well organized plan, if he was being honest. Not one Tony had ever seen coming.
Steve leaned down, setting him on the bed gently and then rocking back, looking Tony up and down. His cheeks were flushed, blue eyes turning silvery in his arousal—and boy, hadn’t
Thor was quiet. Around them, the rain had finally stopped completely, leaving only the sound of heavy patters of rain dropping off surfaces and sinking through to the grass.
Tony blinked a few times, then shrugged. “Just wondering. I don’t want to- to intrude or anything, you know? And there are a lot of people who don’t exactly have… the highest opinions of me.” He shrugged again, looking down at his feet, “didn’t want to ruin your party, that’s all.”
That was why, as soon as he got back home, he went straight into the workshop and put it into blackout mode. It’d been a week of seeing the way they looked at him- now he just wanted some privacy. Time to refocus. It hadn’t been as big of a deal as Tony had previously thought- instead, it was just like any other stupid battle they had to deal with as Avengers. And so that meant Tony would be able to bounce back from this soon enough.
“Oh, well excuse me for having other things on my mind, Steve,” Tony responded curtly, looking at him with an incredulous face, “and it’s not like I just sit here and do jack shit, you know. I’m working to keep this whole fucking building running, usually running your errands for you-”
“You’ve always been different, Steve,” Tony told him, a broken smile flitting across his face, “it’s how we managed to do this for so long. I thought- I thought maybe they’d last forever. I was selfish and stupid and I was so desperate to believe it I didn’t… I didn’t think about the fact it might affect you. And it’s obvious now that it has. We were wrong. You aren’t immune to my magic, and I can’t stop it. You don’t-
“Stole a general’s badge and then waltzed in like I owned the place,” Steve told him with a small smile, “worked for a little while, ‘til I could get to the janitor’s room and find a uniform.” By that point, Tony really did look incredulous, and Steve quelled the quickening of his heart as he continued. “I never found any solid evidence though, and so I left. But they must have found out there’d been a breach and traced it back to me. Then, obviously, figuring that I now knew too much…”
Sam’s eyes narrowed, and he stepped further out into the corridor, but Steve just sighed and looked up at him, shooting his friend a weak smile. “Seriously, Sam, don’t worry. I’m fine. It just… didn’t go as planned. But it’s fine. I’m fine. I promise.”
“Steve,” Bucky interrupted, his own voice sounding almost as haunted as Steve’s as he leaned forward and rested a hand over his forehead, “it was
Tony’s mouth opened and closed a few more times, before he too, slowly lifted his hands to cover his face. “Oh no,” he said quietly, “oh… no, that’s not good, that’s very very not g-“
“Tony, you’re holding a baby that someone dumped on your doorstep, and we’ve just found out that he can stick to us like glue. Nothing about this makes sense.”
There was something curling in his gut, tighter every second, sinking low and taking all his insides with it.
Steve always said he found Tony in his workshop a thing of beauty. But Tony never realised quite how enthralling it would be to see Steve in his equivalent. With paint covering his arms and hair and clothes in the same way grease tended to cover Tony’s. The spark of light in his eye, the passion that pretty much radiated out of him.
Sam laughed. “Bet Hammer wasn’t happy being left in the dust for Tony. Again. What’s that- third time he’s stolen one of his girlfriends now?”
Steve looked at it for a moment, before taking it from Tony’s hand curiously. He wondered what it was Tony had done to it- maybe an upgrade or something? He hoped it wasn’t too complicated for him to understand.
Steve looked at it. “So I’ll just go back and put us on the other one,” he said, and it was so easy to him. He didn’t understand why Reed was looking at him like Steve was breaking his heart.
The man didn’t turn from the TV. “These creatures go through so much violence and pain, yet it is so, so funny. That duck was beaten repeatedly over the head with a spade mere minutes ago.” Thor pointed at one of the animations. Tony was pretty sure that one was called Donald. Or maybe Daffy. He couldn’t say he’d ever paid much attention to their names. “I have not slept all night, Tony. How are you even alive?”
Oh god, he should have known this was coming. He should have done more. They were going to take Peter and they were going to do God knows what and it was all his fault. And now he needed to think, needed to
So she didn't. Simply turned to her food and began eating, nonplussed about the fact her best friend had just said he was involved in prostitution. Steve found their relationship to be confusing on the good days, but he chose not to comment. It wouldn't get him anywhere. He was at least certain they weren't fucking or anything- not if the way Bucky and Nat had been ogling eachother over the past week had been anything to go by, anyway. Honestly, Steve was kind of regretting inviting Bucky and Peggy over in the first place. They'd made firm friends with the rest of the guys, which only ever meant trouble for Steve. Now all his friends were in cahoots. Cahooting about Steve and how best to wrap the bubblewrap around him, no fucking doubt. Bucky and Peggy were the worst helicopter parents he'd ever goddamn known.
“—works, yes, I know. But it will be a world where Tony’s still there, and I’m still with him.” Steve swallowed. Suddenly his voice was weak. “I have a chance to take all this back. Nothing in this universe will stop me from using it.”
There was a short pause, and then none other than Director Fury himself was speaking down the line. Usually he got one of the lackeys, sometimes Hill or Coulson. Fury was a new one. “We need you in,” was his opener, voice just as sharp as Steve’s, “I can’t disclose any information over the phone. But it’s top priority. We’ve got some new intel that’s just come in, and we want you briefed and leading the mission.”
Steve swallowed. “So you’re saying… this was some sort of episode? A- a PTSD thing?” The memory came back to him, and he shut his eyes slowly. “Shoes on the floor, you said. They were… that’s what we both woke up to. His shoes on the tiles.”
Tony made a face. “That was not your lovestruck face,” he said incredulously, “that was your ‘what the fuck is happening here’ face.”
“Oh, Peter,” Pops said sadly, turning himself a little and bending down to scoop him up into his arms, holding tightly as Peter bit on his lip and tried not to cry.
His eyes narrowed, and he turned down his head. What was he wearing? Jacket- just some thing he’d bought from Target a few months ago, nothing expensive. Shoes- he looked down at the scruffy trainers and cleared them off the list. The only thing he had with him was the backpack he’d taken with him to help carry the pizzas back. Chances were they weren’t going to make a move on him anyway- they seemed otherwise occupied. But preparing for the worst was just a habit, by that point. He’d been too used to getting caught off-guard by those types of people.
Steve pulled away, irritated. It seemed everyone had decided they knew what was best for him, all of a sudden. Even, apparently, Tony fucking Stark. “You don’t have a clue about me.”
Bucky groaned loudly and let his head sink into the carpet, half his face smushing into his calculus in defeat. Beside him, Steve and Sam did variations of the same thing- Sam took the wall, and Steve rested his head into his hands.
For the third time, he attempted to stand. But the movement made him dizzy and nauseous, and he wasn’t sure trying to walk anywhere at that point would do any good. Knowing his luck, he’d just fall straight into the road and then get run over by a truck. Or maybe the ambulance that was coming to help him. That sure would be ironic.
“Sir, I think perhaps it may be best to wait for backup before dealing with this,” JARVIS told him quietly, clearly coming to the same conclusions as him, “we do not know what we are facing here, but it does not look to be something that Captain Rogers would be doing when in his right mind.”
He’d known getting electrocuted hurt. He’d experienced it a few days ago, after all. But the pain that lanced its way through his body the moment that he made contact with the metal was like something he’d never even felt before. Like icy fire surging through his bones, ripping straight through his frame. The tightness that he’d been feeling in his heart suddenly became less of a squeeze and more like a crushing sensation, clenching down on his heart like an inescapable vice. He felt himself get flung back as every single muscle convulsed, and the air rushed over his body like an afterthought to everything going on. He vaguely felt himself hitting the floor a second or so later, the sensation secondary to the burning agony in his body. Something was crushing on his chest and the world was darkening, and he couldn’t breathe-
Tony and Steve looked over at each other. The tension seemed to turn up a few notches higher. By this point, they were both very familiar with AIM’s work.
Cursing quietly, Steve shut his eyes and tried to get some rest. Tomorrow, he’d tell Tony that he wanted to try this again—rekindle their relationship and pick up where they’d left off. Then he would call up SHIELD from a secure location and tell them everything Tony had let him in on, ask them whether they wanted him to hold his position or go straight in with the arresting process. It would be messy, and painful, and Steve was going to get himself together and just fucking do it, because
He stepped into the machine and looked to the small control panel, trying to find the one that would shut the chamber door and catapult him back in time. They liked to overcomplicate things, did the Tescillians. A lot of buttons for relatively few actions. He found what he was looking for a second later, however, and without a second thought, he pressed down on the panel.
Once they’d kidnapped him, it didn’t take long for all of them to end up in the communal kitchen, dropping Tony gently on the table and then pressing a mug of coffee immediately into his hands.
Hiking his bag up irritably, he pushed against the current of students and went back in. The swarm of kids filtered out once he got away from the main exit, leaving him to march down the empty science corridors in relative peace once he reached them. Room six caught his eye, and then room seven-
Tony clenched his eyes shut and pushed Steve away weakly. This time, Steve went- and with no one to hold him up, his shaky knees buckled and he fell to the floor. It sent another flame of agony through his midsection and he whimpered, curling up into himself. It hurt like hell. He was pretty sure a rib had been broken completely.
They were silent for a few rather awkward moments, until Steve blurted “thank you. I wanted to… but then you weren’t at school and… yeah. For Saturday. It was real good of you to take me home. I’m sorry for ruining you night.”
“I feel like it kinda was,” Steve bit his lip and tried to get Tony to actually look at him. He knew Tony was upset, and hated the fact that he was some of the reason why, especially after everything Tony had gone out and done for him. He felt like a tool. “And look- sorry for snapping, earlier. I know I was asking a lot of you. It wasn’t fair for me to assume my friends were able to just walk in-“
Suddenly, there was a sudden jolt, and Steve felt the pain flare up against his temple as it was hit by something sharp and brutal.
He shut his front door hastily and then turned, looking out onto the street where a sleek black car was waiting right outside. A driver with sunglasses on at 3am nodded to him, and he nodded back curtly, slipping into the backseat. He was now wide awake, the concept of an oncoming challenge overtaking him, and so all thoughts of sleep were long behind him. It was easy to fall into this mindset, and the adrenaline was a familiar buzz in his system. This—this was one thing he could do, and do well.
He sighed, shifting Peter higher up onto his hip. It was hard to imagine that there was a dangerous terrorist unit out hunting for something as completely ineffective and harmless as the child in his arms. Peter clung to things randomly whenever he felt like it, but that was about it. As far as Tony could tell, that was as far as his range extended. Useful, but not something worth going toe-to-toe with the Avengers over, surely?
His mind went back to the videos, wondering how many other enhancements Peter possessed that AIM didn’t know about. The adhesive capabilities were all they were aware of, but Lewinsky had seen signs of augmented strength too, and God only knew what else might start to crop up as Peter grew. It was probably for the best that the kid ended up with Xavier- he was good at handling shit like this. The Avengers were more punchy-kicky than… baby.
He glanced at the clock on the bedside table as he quietly padded back on to his side of the bed. 8:22. Not the earliest that Steve could be waking his partner up, really. And he was sure Tony wouldn’t complain when he discovered Steve’s reasoning.
Until the moment Rumlow killed him, however, Steve was going to give as good as he damn well got. With a snarl, he ducked under the next swipe and then threw a hand upward, finding Rumlow’s wrist and gripping tightly. He had the advantage over Rumlow when it came to sheer strength, and after a second of resistance, Brock had no choice but to give way; sliding to the side as Steve drove the blade in the opposite direction. It buried itself in the nearby wall with a grinding thud, and Steve didn’t waste time trying to pull it back out again. He’d never been much good with a knife, and he had always preferred a simple fistfight over anything else. Not wasting any breath, he immediately hiked up a foot, swinging it around and hitting his opponent dead in the chest. Rumlow stumbled backward with a wheeze, and Steve followed vigilantly, his fist rising for a swing. But the other man recovered too fast, using his backward momentum to fall to the floor and roll, rising straight up again and tackling Steve in the midsection in the space of about two seconds.
Eventually, the boy’s eyes slid away, and he took a seat right at the back of the room. He didn’t look over to Steve again, and after a while Steve just shook his head and turned back around, hands clenched around the edge of the desk.
“And then there are the added impossibilities of you; a broke skinny kid from the 40′s, undergoing experiments which make you into a superhero, before crashing into the ice and being trapped in stasis for 70-odd years. Coincidentally, just in time for our paths to cross.”
Tony Stark was definitely plotting something, and was in it for the long haul here, because he wouldn’t just be nice to Steve for no reason. No way.
Steve nodded, already moving. “Thanks.” His SHIELD combat-boots squeaked along the floors as he hurried through, and for a second he wished he’d stayed in his civvies when he’d made it onto the jet. Tony probably knew who exactly Steve worked for by now, but still. Steve didn’t want him to see it in the flesh—somehow, that made it worse in his head. Like rubbing salt into the already-agonising wound.
“March 1st, 2016,” she said shakily, rocking him against her hip as he slept soundly. He was bigger than he had been in the first few videos; looked a little healthier and like the Peter that Tony knew. “I can’t do this any more. I can’t watch them hurt him. So I’m leaving, and I’m getting him somewhere where I know he’ll stand a chance of being safe. Where exactly that is, I’m not sure yet. But I… I can’t just stand by any more. Somehow, Peter has managed to retain his soul throughout this. He can still smile, still be happy. I’ve been helping him a little, and I think he’s even starting to get to grips with phonetics. If I can get him somewhere safe and normal quickly, he may still have a chance to— to be a child.”
All that time they’d been searching, and they’d never heard a peep. He’d just thought Loki had been lying all those years back, but then… God, and Steve had fucking abandoned the search. He’d let Bucky down, again.
“Me and Clint would still be working in SHIELD,” Natasha said quietly, looking over at him with tired eyes, “living in barracks, never knowing who we could trust. My room was ten square feet. I didn’t know what family even felt like. Not until you gave me one.”
. He hadn’t seen him all day, and if he got back any later, the man would probably be asleep when Tony got in.
“He’s had a bit too much mead,” Tony leaned forward and whispered to him, before punching Thor in the knee. “Back off, you absolute man-whore.”
Tony quickly pulled them out of the room, both of them smiling like idiots as they hopped over their friends’ bodies and made their way out the door. “Use a condom!” Steve heard Bruce call quietly after them, and he almost turned around to shoot the boy a scathing look, but ended up finding himself getting tugged out the door before that could happen.
Steve felt the strangely familiar sense of dislike at the mention of the people Tony hung out with. Putting a tentative hand on Tony’s arm, he watched as Tony followed the motion with his eyes. “Did they… what did they do?” He asked softly, half dreading the answer.
“I love you,” Steve said, surprised at how easy it fell from his mouth, now there was no future for either of them. No chance of making things worse, or losing a best friend. “I’ve loved you for years. Never stopped. Not through the civil war, not through anything. I loved you so much some days it consumed my entire fucking
Tony said, more angrily this time as he spun around and clumsily buttoned up his shirt. His fingers were shaking. “No, you… God, he was so close. He was so… God, fuck,
Steve laughed shortly. Oh, the days when he’d come back every day with a new shiner. Bucky was now a trained professional in Steve-Rogers-Based First aid. And those sorts of skills were ones you kept with you for life.
The effect was immediate. His younger self paused, freezing up in shock, and Steve took the opportunity, headbutting him quickly and sharply and knocking him clean out. Other Steve lay sprawled out on the floor, out cold to the world, and Steve looked at him. He wondered what those extra five words were going to do. It was a dangerous game to play, but maybe… maybe it would work out. Perhaps those five words could save the universe.
“I’ll see you ‘round, Steve Rogers,” he said, revving up the engine, “please don’t get into any more fights.”
Tony took another second to remain in Steve’s arms before he pulled away, taking a quick breath in. “Uh, they said 4 o’clock. Pepper might be a bit later.”
He loved riding on Tony’s bike- it was a kick of adrenaline he rarely got anywhere else. Tony went a little too fast and turned a little too severely and Steve shouldn’t enjoy it, but fuck, he did. He loved it, and Tony knew damn well he did. Every time he laughed and clutched tighter to Tony’s waist, he heard the responding chuckle from Tony, felt the extra kick that he put in just to show off. It wasn’t wise, but Steve got the feeling that after that heavy conversation, it was what they both needed. Although to be fair, Steve would enjoy it just as much if they’d been talking about nothing but the weather- simply the fact he got to put his hands around Tony’s waist made it enjoyable enough.
He made an incredulous face, mouthing their names and then raising his eyebrows. No doubt they were skipping class- probably hadn’t even gone to it in the first place, if they’d been hanging around with Ty Bain and all the others since the end of break.
Steve shrugged. “Since coming outta the ice? Maybe… 5 or six times. I don’t know what triggers it- some months I just… don’t sleep. And it’s so- so- I’m just…”
“Cap, I need you to take nightshift- everyone else is absolutely exhausted. You okay with waking me up in a few hours?” Natasha asked, as they sat in their stakeout and breathed heavily- still burnt out from the fight they’d just been caught up in half an hour ago.
“Not as far as I am aware, sir. Captain Rogers’ vitals do appear to have failed to be registered.” JARVIS’ voice was slightly concerned, and of course, Tony had known that this wasn’t an error- his phone didn’t malfunction, for one thing. No, this was—this was something on Steve’s end.
Pulling out his phone quickly, he dialled Natasha’s number, only having to wait half a second before she picked up with a crisp: “You coming back up?”
Steve stared, silent- rooted to the spot as he watched the second person he loved more than anything else in the world fall to his death.
“No lasting damage,” they said to him as they finished checking him over, and Steve heard Tony breathe out a quiet sigh of relief next to him. The doctor looked at his notes with a small shake of his head. “Incredible, really,” he muttered to himself, “that really should have killed you, Captain.”
“Steven you are truly wonderful,” he declared loudly, leaning into Steve’s shoulder, “if a little too trustworthy. I feel like I would’ve needed a solid hour and copious amounts of alcohol before I’d willingly give up my phone to another soul.”
Next were the blueprints that he had to approve and send back down to R&D. That required a little more brain-power, maybe even enough to distract him. It was engineering. He was good at that. “JARVIS, patch me through to Collins.”
“No,” Tony said firmly, shaking his head and looking down, quickly plucking the bottle from Peter’s hands before the boy could throw it uncaringly onto the bed. “No, I need to… I can track them fastest. I’ll be okay.”
“Ha ha,” Steve jumped down quickly, thankful that he had actually managed to stay on his feet that time, “I’ll have you know that I have excellent balance, actually.”
Steve stared down at their room in shock, coat dangling off his fingers as he got caught in the motion of throwing it over the chair. He looked around their bedroom- or at least, what was left of it, with a gaping mouth.
With the situation diffused almost as fast as it had ignited, Steve relaxed. Tony lay down next to him a few minutes later, smiling a little nervously at him as he got comfortable on the rug. There was a childish sort of happiness in his eyes as he snuck glances over to Steve throughout the rest of the movie, and when Steve moved a little so that their shoulders were touching, he liked to imagine he could hear Tony’s breath hitch. It was certainly hard not to notice everything about Tony just then; he was so close. So… strangely real, in that moment. There was nothing Tony was hiding behind- just him, all him, lying on the rug next to Steve, surrounded by friends and with sugar grains coating his fingers from where he’d dipped them in the popcorn. His eyes were huge, reflecting the lights and explosions of the TV screen, and Steve spotted a small streak of black behind his ear from where he must have tucked his hair with dirty fingers.
Steve always said how much he loved Tony’s heartbeat. Tony could tell that it was one of Steve’s grounding points, that he listened to it to remind himself where he was and what he still had. Sometimes he just held Tony’s hand while they sat together, fingers brushing over the pulse on his wrist, and then it’d stay there for the entire time, just settled, listening to the constant thrum. It made Steve blush when Tony brought it up, as if it were a silly thing to do, but Tony understood. Of course he did. He loved the sound of Steve’s heart as much as Steve loved the sound of his. The proof that he was there, that he was alive, that there was still hope. Sometimes when Tony couldn’t sleep, his mind too full of the what-ifs, the ideas, the fears and anxieties, he’d settle his hand over Steve’s chest and just listen. Let the thoughts fall away and leave only the sound of Steve to surround him. He’d count the beats all the way up into the hundreds some nights.
, it would be like… i don’t know, rolling a dice a trillion times, and having it land on the number two for each and every one of them. That’s how unlikely you are just to begin with.”
“Bye,” was all Steve called out, before sliding out into the corridor and immediately pressing Tony against the wall, mouth meeting Tony’s possessively, greedily.
“I’m an asshole,” he repeated, “and you don’t- you don’t wanna be getting caught up with me, Steve. Believe me. I was… I was being selfish, okay, but your b- but I realized that Barnes had a point. I
He swallowed sharply and pinched his nose, trying to stop the bleeding. On the bed above him, Tony was silent.
Steve blinked in confusion, watching the two guys nod nervously and then scurry off down the hall, muttering to one another and glancing back as they did so. Which just left Steve and Tony with his stupid jangly zips.
Steve swooped in and snatched the piece of pie Tony was cutting into, shoving into his mouth rather unceremoniously, despite Tony’s protests. “That’s fucking rude, Steve.”
Steve was strong—strong enough to take out a whole HYDRA compound on his own—but not even a supersoldier could withstand a heavy blow from an Iron Man suit flying head-on at 60 miles an hour. Tony’s hands collided with Steve, sending both of them skidding along the floor and crashing into a table or two if the clanging was anything to go by, and while they were moving, Tony swiftly and efficiently brought his fist across Steve’s temple, using just the right amount of pressure as he impacted.
Steve looked horrified, and he put his hands up, trying to reach out for Tony. “No, wait, Tony, I wasn’t… I was just… please don’ go, let me explain, I’m so tired, please stay with me, I just need to sl-”
Steve closed his hands delicately around Tony’s wrists, bringing his hands up to kiss his palms. “Don’t be sorry,” he murmured, “just be open. Talk to us. We’re all messy, Tony, but we stick around for one another. You’d do the same for us. Don’t treat yourself like you’re less, okay?”
Eventually, though, he fell into the zone. Driven by determination and anger and a dozen other emotions, Tony worked voraciously through the hours, first doing the research and checking out any similar contents on the web, then working off that in order to make his own. He’d never made a website or blog before, but he knew the basics of it, and he knew how he wanted it to be laid out.
. Controlling your life so that you wouldn’t end up finishing it yourself was pretty much all he did for half a year, and Goddamn it, he did it well. Look at you now- you’re better. You’re smiling more. It’s brilliant for us both to see.”
Bruce nodded, shuffling sideways so Thor could also enter the room. His eyes went immediately to Peter, who he beamed at with the wattage of a million suns and then made grabby hands for. Tony, just happy to have two hands to hold his coffee with, let him, and soon Thor was making Peter squeal with laughter as he was thrown high into the air and caught smoothly by the God.
steal your god-damn shoes!” Sam yelled, throwing his hands in the air, “you probably just left them in some dirty-ass corner in your room like you always do!”
Bucky just shoved him into the wall and smiled. “That’s why I only ever do it once every year,” he said, “so don’t be expectin’ any good advice for the next twelve months. You just used up your quota.”
Tony could only stand there, numb, as he watched Steve walk away from him. His cheek felt like it was on fire, and he should probably go find some ice for it, but if he did it felt like it would just make things a little more real.
Steve felt something twist uncomfortably in his gut, and he pursed his lips. “I get it,” he said softly “don’t worry Tony. Honestly. I- I mean, it was… I can see your reasoning, that’s all.”
Tony bit his lip a bit, looking back to the TV. His fingers fiddled absently with the hairs at the back of Steve’s neck.
Tony just shut his eyes and shook his head, moaning a little. “Worse,” he gritted, “Obie’s… come si dice… Obie’s smart. Smarter than— than Howard. Lives’n Cali. Can’t be alone, per favour, please, just… no hospital.”
Steve wrinkled his nose, wandering back over to Tony’s side and then leaning over to the third draw down on the left, pulling up open and delving inside to retrieve his sketchbook. “How about Tchaikovsky?” He said, and then huffed when Tony blanched.
“Steve,” Tony sighed, “it was a spontaneous thing, the guy admitted it himself. He saw a shot and he took it. You could never have known.”
Steve opened his mouth, ready to argue on principal, but Tony shook his head. “Steve, if you won’t let me drive you to Goddamn hospital, you will at least let me get you somewhere with some half-decent medical supplies.”
“Not my fault you’re a massive fucking tease,” Steve muttered grumpily, falling into step beside Tony, “it’s not easy to think when you’ve just been kissed like that.”
Steve watched Tony as he bit his lip and looked down a little- and really, it should have been feeling more awkward than it was; Steve was a fumbling beginner at best, with no experience prior to this moment- and yet it was obvious even to him that Tony was… Tony was gone. Tony was gazing at him with the sunlight in his eyes, and he was so beautiful, so very beautiful, yet he seemed to only want Steve. All the choice in the world, and he only wanted Steve.
Tony paused, but then his head jerked up and he practically beamed. “Really?” He asked, beginning to bounce on his toes.
Steve only briefly admired the AI for its sheer humanity before he got to the point and put the computer at rest. “Tony’s stable,” he explained, “it’s been a rough night. But we’ve patched up the cuts and iced the bruises, we put his shoulder back in place and have been keeping an eye on the concussion. He’s not woken up yet, but I imagine he will fairly soon.”
“I think we got them all,” Bruce told him, wheezing in a short breath as he shuffled upright and turned to Tony, looking him over. “There were about fifteen of them. Nat and Rhodey went out and picked off most of them. I took the four that managed to get through the door.” He turned to Steve. “Are they still alive?”
“The things I love don’t stay,” he murmured, voice becoming even more slurred, and Steve figured his energy must have been leaving him- spent from the emotional breakdown, “things I love jus’… get hurt. I hurt them without even… an’ mamma, an’ Jarvis an… it’ll happen, it’ll…” he stopped making sense after that- at least, to Steve he did; spiraling off into muttered Italian that Steve couldn’t understand, before groaning suddenly and pushing a hand through his hair. “God, I am way too drunk,” he said through a huff of air.
“Well, kind’s good enough for me,” Peggy shrugged, leaning back on the couch and poking Steve with her foot, “just be careful, alright?”
Tony sent back, mind made up as he lifted himself off the desk and stretched. Whether he did the paperwork now or in the morning, the pile of it would never really get any smaller. He’d much rather spend his remaining hours of consciousness doing something productive. Like Steve. Hah.
Now all he needed to do was beat Thanos, take the gauntlet, bring back the rest of the universe, and everything would be fine.
But Steve believed him. Truly, wholeheartedly. Maybe love did make you blind, but it also made you observant. Fine-tuned to the object of your affections; honed into them on a frequency no one else was on. Steve had known Tony for years. Had loved him for pretty much all that time. He knew, as soon as Tony gave the explanation, that that was the answer.
Steve’s chin tilted as he gave his friend a pout. “Fine,” he said, taking Tony’s hand, “we’ll go back to my place then. I feel like we’ve crashed your Netflix binge enough for the day. We’ll leave you to it, huh?”
Tony, with a lack of anything to say, simply pulled a face and then stood up again, going over to the kitchen in the other room with Peter still tucked into his arm. The baby seemed to be pretty happy, letting off little gurgles and babbles of nonsensical noises now and then as Tony walked them through into the other room. He noticed that a highchair had been set up, and so popped Peter’s butt down on it before going about making two coffees. “How was your day, squirt?” He asked wearily, back turned as he grabbed his and Steve’s mugs, “anything interesting happen? You met Thor yet? He’s fun. Just don’t let him try and convince you into holding his hammer. It’s just embarrassing.”
“Some sort of robotic weapon has been seen emerging from the coastline of Santa Barbara. Armed and dangerous, casualties have already been recorded, and military aid has only just been called, but I’m calculating a fifteen minute delay for their arrival. I am sending coordinates now.”
“Whoah, slow down, Soldier,” Tony said with a laugh, taking Steve’s wrists and gently pausing their descent down the buttons of his shirt, “I don’t think our friends would like it if we got naked in front of them.”
He knew what Tony was going to do before he even did it, because it had been 12 years, and Steve had learned more and more about him through each one of them.
“They don’t know what I know about him,” she continued, “their tests aren’t doing anything other than hurting him now. But he’s smart—I think there’s got to be some sort of accelerated cognitive capabilities involved here, because he’s coming along leaps and bounds without much help from us at all. He’s strong too… he can break things that babies shouldn’t be able to break. Lift things. Superhuman strength should have been added to his file weeks ago, but if I tell them he’s capable of more, they’re going to do more experiments on him. I don’t want that to happen. Not any more.”
Steve shrugged, leading them both inside and grabbing his keys. “Few hours, maybe,” he said, “it’s fine.”
Tony wasn’t stopping, and Steve knew he wasn’t going to beat him unless he did something drastic. Tony’s reactor wasn’t a part of him any more, but it still powered the suit. He’d be okay.
- when Tony said later that it would be better to keep it casual, Steve found himself agreeing on autopilot. He knew it wouldn’t end well, seeing as he had already found himself half in love with the man by the time he’d taken his clothes off, but in his defence, he probably would have said anything if it meant that he would be able to sleep with the guy. The way he’d felt for Tony on that night had been something he just hadn’t felt before. A connection on a deep level, an understanding and an appreciation. Tony, to him, had been perfect.
No matter how hard Steve tried, suddenly the air wouldn’t come. Something blocked his throat, a hand, a vice, a noose, and he just stared at the pen blankly, wondering what the hell he was supposed to do now. How he was supposed to go forward from here. He’d just lost everything,
“What’s a Jarvis?” Steve asked, turning around and cocking his head over to the desk that was covered almost entirely in electricals and various machines. Like one massive computer.
They were still locked onto each other, their gazes fixed until Tony blinked and then cleared his throat, moving away. “You want something to eat?” He asked, stumbling over to the fridge. “Drink? I’d imagine you’ve had a pretty busy day.”
Tony side-eyed him over his cigarette, and then pointedly stubbed it out against the chimney. “Ha ha,” he said sarcastically, before pouting, “and thank you for making me waste an entire goddamn cigarette, by the way.”
Steve waved when they all turned to look their way and pushed Tony forward as the man spluttered. “I am not… we’re… shut up,” he muttered half-heartedly, dropping his bags at the door. “Did you break anything while we were away? Set anything on fire? Cause a rift in spacetime, maybe?”
Steve laughed, and this time it was a lick of the lips, which was honestly just unfair at this time of day. “Uhhh-”
The communal floor hit him with a wave of laughter as he stepped inside, and he stared numbly, watching the scene unfold around him. Thor was running around in the massive living room, leaping over couches and vaulting the countertops whilst Steve followed in hot pursuit, Peter tucked firmly into his side. The boy was cackling maniacally, arms outstretched, trying to grab the God of Thunder. “You can’t run forever!” Steve called out to the other man, who only let out a boom of laughter and then army-rolled away from Steve’s swiping hand.
He waited until the time came to wake Tony. After a few cursory checks that proved the boy hadn’t worsened, Steve told him to go back to sleep and then waited again.
Hastily wiping at his eyes with the back of his sleeve, he tugged at the handle of his suitcase and then lifted it up, pulling it out of the room. Should be enough to see him through for a couple of weeks. He sent a call to the rest of the Avengers, knowing they’d have arrived back home by that point and telling them to meet him in the common room in five minutes, then quickly hurried down the stairs to meet them all. He owed it to them, at the very least, to tell them that he was leaving. Even if he didn’t have the courage to say why. The teams were in various places at the tower- Bruce down in the labs again, Natasha and Clint in the gym, Thor possibly out doing some gardening. Tony just gripped his suitcase tight and waited, knowing that his car was sat outside, ready to take him away. He wasn’t sure exactly where he’d go just yet. But he’d work it out soon enough.
They were both sat on the grass outside the tiny barn Steve had rented, a blanket under their backs as they stared up into the blissfully clear skies.
He heard Steve’s responding chuckle and turned his head, watching the man roll his eyes and then slip his sunglasses back onto his face as they reached the top of the hill and got hit with the sun’s glare. Tony felt kind of like a broken record at that point, but God, he’d never get over how beautiful Steve looked when he was relaxed. Out of the uniform, wearing a faded red Henley and running a hand through messy bedhead that he hadn’t bothered to flatten out that morning. The glasses framed his face well, and from the passenger seat Tony admired the sharpness of Steve’s jaw. That thing could cut glass if given half a chance.
When none of the standing parties made to move either, Steve just sighed and wound his arm around Tony’s, before sinking down to the space of floor he’d left a few minutes ago. Tony resisted for about a second before just following along, ending up sat a little rigidly on the rug, still not looking Steve in the eye.
“You’ve already gotten yourself into enough trouble, Rogers,” a voice—sounded like the gym teacher—told him roughly as he hauled him off, “I suggest you keep your mouth shut from here on out.”
He heard Rhodey’s chuckle as he stepped out of the door and looked out to the car Pepper had now sat herself in. “I’ll see you ‘round, Steve. Look after him for me, yeah?”
Tony laughed loudly and ran a hand through his hair, sending the boy one of the most condescending looks Steve had ever seen. As he walked forward, he caught the tail end of Tony's conversation. ‘-Reed, when you manage to bend the laws of thermodynamics to your will, please do come back to me with that, but until then there is absolutely no way-“
Ty smiled and then cocked his head back in Steve’s direction. “What’s your name?” He asked politely, but Steve couldn’t help feeling his hackles rise all the same.
Tony looked up at Steve with a small note of apology on his face. “I left it somewhere in the Gala,” he admitted sheepishly, “sorry-”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “right, so you’re doing them a favour by putting the place to use, I suppose?”
He froze up completely, feeling the way his skin had torn at the beginning of his jaw-bone. That was going to bleed.
She’d only started adding the ‘always’ after they’d discovered her illness was terminal. That became how she’d sign off. Love you always, Steve, have fun at school. Behave yourself at Peggy’s, you understand? Love you always.
The boy just shrugged. “My mom likes fancy beds. But I had to strip the entire house of its furnishings, pretty much.” Thor grinned, and then bounded forward like an enthusiastic puppy, grabbing Steve’s face and kissing his forehead soundly. Steve just blinked, accepting it as Just A Thor Thing by that point.
“What would you rather I called him? Because I can think of a hell of a lot more sickly sweet names than that; what about ‘my love’? Or ‘Cute-Ass’? What about shawty, you think Steve will like that-”
“Steve,” he breathed, feeling the other man next to him when they settled on the floor, “we have to… call Thor. Comm… he’ll be—”
Tony swallowed, turning his head. Steve leaned down and kissed him gently, his hand cupping around Tony’s jaw. A slightly confusing response, sure, but Tony would take it.
He refused to stay in the hospital after the third day. Apart from his Brain Fucking, nothing else much was wrong with him, and a hospital was a dangerous place to be for someone as bored and inventive as Tony Stark could get. The team made a few half-assed attempts to keep him in, but were fully aware they were in vain, and eventually they just let Natasha go start the car as the rest of the team escorted him out of the building.
Thor just laughed. “Yes, Steve, we have the seal. And his dummy, and his special green plate, and everything else you’ve told us about. You know, considering you’re only going out for a few hours, I feel as if you’re overreacting just a touch here.”
at the other man without wanting to just curl up and shut his eyes. “How about you hop out and then we can both engage in that fun little activity that most couples would be doing at this time of the night?” He countered instead, running his fingertip across the damp skin of Steve’s arm.
But he didn’t know how to put it into words. Didn’t know how to condense the massiveness of his emotions down into some pathetic little sentence that wouldn’t ever truly show Tony what was going on in Steve’s soul in that moment. So he said I love you instead, and hoped it would be enough.
“Alright guys,” he turned around quickly, making sure not to speak too loudly and wake the ones who were sleeping, “we’ll see you in a bit.”
Fury was stood waiting, his hands resting on the desk between them. He wasn’t moving, not one muscle, and Steve figured the Director was probably waiting for him to react first and then go from there. But Steve himself wasn’t quite sure what to say. In fact, a rather large portion of his cognizant brain-processes were choosing instead to focus on the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock that Fury kept in the corner of his room. It was a funny thing to have in a top-security office. A little out of place. Maybe it was an heirloom or something. Steve didn’t know. He really needed to stop thinking about the clock right about now.
“What the hell are you waiting for, buddy?” Someone gave him a gentle shove forward, and Tony didn’t know who they were, couldn’t really say he cared much either, but they seemed to be wanting to help, so he listened to the last bit anyway. “Go after him before he runs for good!”
Steve gave him a small salute, stepping backward. “Piece of cake,” he promised confidently as he reached the door.
He spared one look behind him before turning the corner again, and noted with an (admittedly very self-satisfied) smile on his face that Tony was still stuck to the spot Steve had left him in, staring up at him with a dropped jaw as Heather Whateverthefuck attempted to pull his interest back to her.
With a groan, all of them jumped to their feet. Steve, who had returned from his run by that point, looked up to the ceiling. “JARVIS, what’ve we got?”
Across the room, Steve was rocking Peter gently in his arms, humming another Gaelic lullaby that he knew from memory. Tony loved it when Steve sang those lullabies in his off-tune voice, and it worked like a dream, always sending Peter off to sleep with the strangely enrapturing words. Steve caught Tony watching him and smiled a little bashfully, tongue tripping over one of the lyrics as he lowered Peter down into the crib with practiced grace, tucking the blanket up over his body and then making sure no limb was exposed. Tony loved the care Steve put into every action regarding Peter. There wasn’t a single movement that wasn’t accounted for and thought over; Steve moved like a ballet dancer even when he wasn’t around the baby, but whenever Peter was in his arms, it was like all that dialled up to eleven. He held him softly, just like Tony had taught him. He combed Peter’s hair meticulously, making sure any tangles were dealt with painlessly, even if it took him double the time.
So, without even thinking about it, he leaped forward and extended his arm, pushing it out of the way before it could land anywhere near Tony.
“What… what are you doing?” Tony asked, brow furrowed deeply as he stepped further in and took a shirt from the pile of luggage. Steve quickly snatched it back, stuffing it into his bag defensively.
A hand curled through his hair, yanking him up to look at her. She was smiling, yet again. “Okay,” she said, “I guess it’s time to bring out my ace card, huh?”
“Don’t think, drink!” Someone said (screamed) to his left, shoving a large cup of...something, in his hand and then laughing as she stumbled away. Was his discomfort really that obvious? Probably.
But Tony simply snorted, pushing out from underneath the base of the machine and staring at Steve with his grease-stained face. “It absolutely does not,” he said derisively, “it looks like a bucket of bolts I threw together half asleep, which, okay maybe I did- but that’s not the point. I’m totally going to slicken this baby up soon. This is just a prototype, and right now it’s leaking all sorts of stuff. Gamma, x-rays, electricity. Don’t touch those poles by the way-” Tony gestured to the large staffs that were surrounding the entirety of the chamber, and Steve eyes them up warily, “they’re running live to stabilize the machine. I’d really rather you didn’t electrocute yourself for a second time.”
There was a cup of coffee in Steve’s hand, and Tony looked at it in surprise. “Didn’t know you liked it black. Or caffeinated. What happened to the ‘coffee is the devil’ shtick?”
Steve took in Tony’s face; every beautiful inch of skin and hair and soul, and then he laughed deep in his chest, leaning forward so their foreheads brushed. “It would be cool,” he agreed, “very cool.”
“Has this happened before?” Steve asked quietly, just as Thor pulled out of his parking spot. The other boy glanced at him, and then turned back to the road.
But Fury shook his head. “No,” he responded with a clipped voice, “but after this conversation, you might wish he was.”
“You either get in the trashcan or you spend the rest of your life in a cell,” Steve snapped, “and no, don’t say anything along the lines of ‘I chose the cell’, I don’t have time for that. Just get in the fucking trash, okay?”
Steve kept very still, allowing his enhanced senses to pick up on the faint beats of Tony’s heart, so quiet they were hardly audible at all, even to him. They were most certainly there though, soft and reassuring and constant. A steady beat. An anchor.
As the days passed, Tony only became more and more determined to give Steve the perfect proposal. He focused any pent-up energy and lingering anxieties on the challenge, charting up data and running through ring blueprint after ring blueprint until he’d gotten it down to three solid ideas. Steve probably thought he was working, and yeah, perhaps for half an hour or so every few days he was indeed checking up with Pepper to see if the launch had gone smoothly and such, but most of the time he was calling up restaurants and booking tables or texting Bruce and debating whether it would be feasible to get ahold of point-four grams of Vibranium from Wakanda, depending on how hard he batted his eyelashes at the king. He was pretty certain he wanted it to be Vibranium, after all- and if worst came to worst, he could always synthesize some more. He’d just have to get Steve away for a little while so he wouldn’t notice the workshop getting turned into a bombsite—
“Aye,” Thor nodded proudly, pounding his chest with fervor, “I was taught English by a Professor of Norse Mythology. He thought it amusing to teach me to sound like a Viking! I too, find this funny- only when inebriated though.”
but he didn’t think he’d be able to take hearing Tony’s voice tell him they were over right now. Steve was pretty certain he’d just… shatter.
Tony was centimetres away from him. His eyes were shining, and he was obviously holding back a smile. Steve glared sullenly back at him, really hoping that the red across his face and down his neck wasn’t visible.
God. They were probably yelling at each other right now- over Peter himself this time, which might mean it was his fault if they split up, if this was the argument that set everything in motion,
But Tony was just sat there. He looked…. Well, Steve wasn’t too sure what that look meant. Like confusion and- and a strange sort of happiness, all at once.
Peter burbled, a sticky hand reaching, as usual, for the light in Tony’s chest. When he couldn't reach, his brow folded and his little podgy fist clenched, flying around in Tony's vicinity, trying to get a hold on any part of him that he could reach. He always wanted to touch, did Peter. Like he'd said; he loved attention, and even though Tony was still apprehensive, it was damn-near impossible to deny the boy that when he was looking at Tony so Goddamn earnestly. It was like he'd taken that puppy-dog gaze straight out of Steve's 'how to wrap a Tony around your little finger' handbook.  Downright embarrassing how fast Tony caved to that, these days.
Clint pointed a finger between the two of them. “Your sickeningly obvious lovey-faces while everyone’s trying to eat. It’s off-putting as hell, man.”
“This is all I’ve been thinking about for weeks, Tony,” Steve said with a broken little laugh. “It’s the only thing that’s ever on my mind. I got a knife in my leg because I was beating up a terrorist and then suddenly I remembered the last person I’d hit had been
He had discovered early on that he wasn’t the only one the relationship whose colouring gave away their emotions. Tony blushed like crazy if the right thing (and mostly Steve-related things, he’d found out with amusement) happened.
, okay, sorry, guess that wasn’t actually a question, huh?” Tony scrabbled for purchase around Steve’s neck as the man gently wound his arms around Tony and then hefted once more, picking Tony back off the floor as easily as if he weighed nothing at all. “You know, I really can walk by my own, you don’t need to do this, I know you are currently in Big Strong Alpha Mode or whatever, but I am actually a human with legs that work, and so I think I’ll be-”
Then, a second later, there was a tremendous bang as Steve slammed his foot into the door frame and sent the whole thing flying off its hinges. Tony jumped in surprise. “Isn’t that supposed to be reinforced?” He asked Bruce in incredulity.
Tony put his tongue in Steve’s mouth and everything sort of short-circuited for a moment, leaving his brain blissfully empty of all thought aside from
His fingers curled around the door handle and he pushed it open gently, hearing Thor step close to his side. Then he slipped into the room and, for the first time since it’d happened, Steve looked at Tony. At the man he loved more than anyone and anything else in the whole world.
“But he doesn’t look so empty when he’s with you,” Jane explained, and Steve felt his breath catching in his throat at her words, at the way she said them. So… simply. So honestly. Like it was just some every day fact. “He’s smiling more. I don’t know, you just… you fit with him. That’s all.” She smiled, tucking her hair away again before shrugging her head to the side. “Anyway- I should probably get to class. My teacher is a total dick about late marks.”
Tony opened his mouth to say something along the lines of ‘you’re a goddamn New Yorker and you can’t handle a bit of piss?’ When his train of thought was suddenly interrupted by JARVIS’ voice, speaking up through the sound system. “Excuse me sirs,” he said politely, “but it appears Peter is attempting to mash Lego blocks into the DVD player.”
“Oh, you’d prefer us fighting again, then?” Pops asked, with a raised eyebrow as Dad’s head popped back up into view and looked smug.
“Ugh,” Clint’s voice knocked him out of his little trance, and he blinked, looking over at the archer as the man pulled a face,
They made their way into the hallway, Tony taking point with Steve and Nat behind him and Clint watching their six. It was while they were halfway down the dimly lit corridor that the next blow hit, with Thor getting in touch with them via the comm, his voice grave and breathless.
“Please?” Steve looked at him earnestly, his blue eyes startlingly clear from where Tony was sat, a few short centimetres between them. “We can make out with each other while something else plays in the background.”
“He’s in the principal’s office again?” Steve sighed, and then remembered he was supposed to be mad at her and gave her an obligatory shove in the shoulder, “also, I do not approve of feeding my best friend copious amounts of vodka and then persuading him to buy a car. That’s what a lot of people call ‘morally wrong'.”
Steve couldn’t let that happen again. Who knew how hard Tony would lose it if he knew? What if he refused to help? Steve couldn’t put Bucky’s one chance at salvation on the line like that, he
Tony wasn’t asleep, far from it. He was still sat upright and staring vacantly at the mirror, obviously deep in thought, but when he heard the sound, his head snapped to Steve. Their eyes met, and when Tony registered him, his face turned into one of surprise. This clearly hadn’t been something he had expected.
“Stop,” he whispered to himself as his eyelids clenched shut, his hands curled into his knees and he cradled himself in the middle of the ruined bed like a child, “please, please…” He didn’t even know what he was saying or to who- he could feel the tears spring up from his eyes and let them fall easily, and God, this one was a bad one, this one was really bad, he needed to take a breath and he could hear someone talking to him, probably JARVIS, but it just felt like white noise in his head. The silence was so loud it blocked everything else out.
Tony was definitely Iron Man. That much was now undeniable. Steve had seen it himself. But Iron Man didn’t go out and fight evil robots—hell, he
He grinned into the pillows, knowing his cheeks had probably gone a little pink from the thought alone. And dammit, now he just wanted to see Tony all over again- barely awake for more than ten minutes, but his mind had already gone straight back to that boy. He seriously needed to get a grip on himself.
- and then Steve was pretty much the opposite of all that. Tony would have to be absolutely shameless not to feel at least a little bit of embarrassment, walking around with someone like Steve on his arm.
Pops didn’t say anything, but he started moving across the room, and then sat down on the edge of the bed. They were both quiet for a while, and it was obvious that his Pops was trying to think of something to say.
Steve remained silent, placing his hand on Tony’s and locking their fingers together in acknowledgment. It was always hard to talk about things in the way they seemed to- but he was just grateful Tony had told him at all. It meant a hell of a lot. Especially when that sort of stuff was what put Tony’s life in danger- Jesus, he could still barely believe the stories about his dad-
“So you’re a PI,” Tony muttered encouragingly, his eyes burning holes into the side of Steve’s face as he pulled out an antiseptic wipe. “How did that—sorry, this’ll sting— how did that end up with you turning up at my house then?”
She walked forward, and Steve’s eyes widened as he raised his hands in defense and stepped further behind Sam- but she seemed not to notice, instead just curling her hand around one of Steve’s raised hands and then pulling him back into the kitchen with excitement. Steve turned and looked a little helplessly back at Sam, but the bastard just laughed and then wandered after them, not a care for Steve’s pleading eyes.
Tony leading them, Steve walked through the huge, empty mansion. In all honesty, he barely even noticed it- too focused on Tony’s hand clasping around his own.
“Your dad hits you,” was all he said in the end, which really was terrible, because he saw Tony’s face just shut off completely, turning away from Steve and then beginning to start walking again.
“Good.” He pulled a pan out of the drawer and placed it on the stove with a clatter. He didn’t even feel remotely sorry for her. If all went to plan, her and Hammer would hopefully be getting jail-time for it. It wasn’t going to take any of it back, but hell, it would be satisfying to see them face the consequences. “Any other news?”
Tony turned off, driving parallel to the queues of traffic in front of them, and Steve just looked at him in something similar to bewilderment. Even now, he still couldn’t work out why Tony was spending so much effort on him. Poor old Steve, needing help yet again, and Tony didn’t even think twice- just hopped in his old man’s car and picked him up off the sidewalk like it was no big deal.
Safe? Tony had absolutely no reason to feel anything but. Why would he? Everything was back to normal now. “Steve,” he chided, keeping his voice warm and fond, “are you still possessed by an alien artefact?”
Steve looked at the both of them, mind working as best it could at 7am on a Sunday morning. “Thor called you The Cavalry,” he blurted in the end, which… wasn’t really what he’d wanted to say, but that was early-morning thought processing for you, “I kinda get that now.”
“Fourth,” Clint corrected her through a mouthful of food and then turned to both Tony and Thor, “why does it mean you two have to hide though?”
He looked down at it, realising he’d moved to the bed. Calmly, he dropped the apple on his bedside table and then crossed his legs.
"What do we do?" Steve hissed, his frown deep. He was still looking at Peter as if he was seconds away from exploding. "Do we even know how old he is? How much food he needs? God, I knew this was a bad idea- what if he wants... like, breast milk or something? Do we have any of that?"
“You don’t need to, it’s okay, I get it,” Tony told him quickly, ignoring the way everything that had seconds ago been pleasant now felt uncomfortable- the dampness of his clothes he’d previously ignored, the way the lights were a little bit too cold and it was making his eyes burn. He didn’t want to hear Steve say that he wanted a family, but just couldn’t fathom it being with Tony. He didn’t want to have to accept that as fact and realise he just wasn’t family material. It was true, but it didn’t make it hurt less.
He leaned forward, pressing his mouth over Steve’s heart. “I love you so much,” he whispered, the thrum of Steve’s pulse thumping through his lips, “never do that to me again.”
Tony debated the question. He still had a hell of a lot of work, and if he went home then Steve would probably want him to sleep, which Tony wasn’t particularly keen on. But, at the same time…
Tony knew it the moment he stepped in the room- Steve always had a vibe he gave off when he got like that, and Tony could positively smell it on the man that morning.
pay, actually,” Tony dived in and stole a chip from his plate before he even had time to counter, and then threw it into his mouth with a wry grin. “So just keep the money and leave me be.”
Pulling out his phone with a sigh and stopping to lean against a wall, he dialled Natasha’s number and waited a few seconds, only for it to go straight through to voicemail. He was about to try Bucky’s when he remembered that none of them were going to answer- Natasha had declared a no-phone rule as soon as they’d all stepped in the door. ‘To appreciate Clooney’s work without distractions,’ she’d said.
and damn if Tony was going to let that slide. Once Steve had had a proper sleep, he was getting right on the phone with the best therapists he knew and arranging some appointments. And then have words about the size of Steve’s ever-growing schedule, and how to say no to some things for a change. Or how to tell Fury when to shove his reports up his ass. Although that one might be Tony’s job.
Tony’s face shone. That was the only word to describe it. “Okay,” he whispered, “alright then, let’s get married. I have—I bought a ring and everything, it’s back home, I was just—probably could have done it at a better time, somewhere a little more romantic than a hospital room, but—”
Sam nodded, and then changed the topic over to the match results from yesterday. Steve allowed it to wash over him, grateful of Sam’s presence that morning. Grateful of Sam as a whole, really- the boy and his family were a Godsend.
Steve laughed, jumping on behind him and wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. “Put your foot on it, Stark.”
He opened it, and looked at the blank screen in confusion. Then he checked whether his GPS was on, which it was, of course. And even if it wasn’t, Steve’s vitals report would still get to him. He’d designed to be almost impossible to lose connection with, in order to avoid scares on Tony’s part. The only time it wouldn’t give him an update was if Steve wasn’t actually in the suit at all—even if he was dead, the vitals would show it.
seeing you like that, it scares me because I can’t lose you. I can’t, Tony. You matter more to me than… than pretty much anyone, okay? And when I think about you just- just stewing in all those horrible untrue thoughts- doing this just to try and prove yourself, God, I just want to punch myself in the face for not doing something sooner.”
Steve snarled and started up on a run, but was sidetracked by another fight, and then another, and then another. He couldn’t get close enough to help, and could only watch with a painful cry of Tony’s name as his husband was punched into the dirt and left there, lying still in his attempts to get Thanos away from the stones. Luckily, however, Thor arrived on the scene a second later and with a roar of mighty thunder, slamming into Thanos at a hundred miles an hour and throwing him off target. The Titan stumbled precious feet away from the gauntlet, and that was all they needed. Thor struck blow after blow while Steve ran as fast as he could, lifting his own hand and summoning up Mjolnir. He resisted his instincts to go to Tony, pushing them back as far as they could physically go in order to finish the fight, save the universe.
Tony looked at him incredulously, before it faded into hurt. “Do really think that little of me?” He asked, voice quiet.
Loki sat there blankly for a moment, before a smile broke out on his face. He laughed, shrugging in defeat. “Touché,” he admitted, “but what else is a fucked up 17-year-old with a broken family and a boatload of undiagnosed mental health problems supposed to do?”
“Bellissimo,” he breathed almost imperceptibly, eyes fixed on where his fingers were tracing, hardly even aware he was doing it, “così perfetta.” And Steve wasn’t fluent, but he knew a compliment when he saw it, and he smiled softly in response. Tony trailed his hand all the way down Steve’s neck, landing square on his chest, right over his heart.
He sighed and looked up at the ceiling. Something to distract himself with, that’s what he needed. He’d done pretty much all of the chores in the house and didn’t have any homework, so after a few seconds of debate he decided to take out his sketchbook and draw once more. The soothing motions of a pencil going back and forth was grounding, and he let his mind wander absently whilst faces were traced out onto the paper. He needed to call Bucky and Peggy and tell them what had happened. At times like this, there was always time for friends and possibly ice cream.
Steve took a step forward automatically, and then the last addition brought him to a stop again as reality crashed back down around him. God, what was he… what was he doing?
Again, Steve and Tony shot one another a look. “Home sweet home,” Tony said through a sigh, and Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist, thumb running back and forth along the warm exposed skin of his waist.
“Steve,” Tony turned and pulled his face close, kissing him softly before rubbing a thumb across the ridge of his cheek, “you know how to control yourself. I wouldn’t let you close to him if I didn’t think you were safe. All you have to do is grab some water and run it through his hair, alright? I’ll make it doesn’t go in his eyes.” He leaned down and cupped the side of his hand over Peter’s forehead again, waiting for Steve to pour the water this time.
Tony laughed once more, before obediently leaning down, although dodging Steve’s head in order to snake his arms around his waist instead. With a yelp, Steve felt himself lifted off the floor and sat on the desk with another thump. It was only then that he felt Tony’s lips brush his forehead lightly, and Goddamn it, that shouldn’t have felt as good as it did.
resolve- he would keep working, absolutely no distractions, not even tempted by the smell of popcorn beginning to pop in the kitchen-
Tony must have spotted him as he walked up the street, because a few seconds later the car door opened and he stepped out, a big smile on his face. In his hands were about six cookies altogether, and Tony was holding them up with pride.
Tony looked up at him with at least four day’s worth of stubble, and possibly three day’s worth of no sleep under his eyes. He looked like shit. Even worse than Steve did, probably, which was saying something.
Steve harrumphed sulkily, but stepped back—of course, not before he’d nipped his fingers under the towel around Tony’s waist and quickly tugged it off with a flourish. Tony just eyed him from the reflection of the mirror, but Steve didn’t notice. Too busy staring at other parts of Tony’s anatomy. “You’re an asshole.”
Steve said nothing, simply swallowed and looked away. There was a dark, petulant part of him that was still a little angry at that. Upset that Tony hadn’t managed to just pull himself together for long enough to offer Steve at least an apology. But it was stupid and irrational and selfish of him to feel that way and he knew it. Tony had been frightened, cornered like a caged animal. He hadn’t been thinking straight. God, some of the shit that Steve had said to Bucky back in the immediate aftermath of his mom’s death would’a put Tony’s simple statements to shame. He hardly had a leg to stand on here.
gone to see a doctor about how you’ve been feeling lately, have you? I know you don’t want to, but I was just... wondering”
Steve watched Tony begin to step forward, raising his hand in fury- but before he even knew it, Steve was there, planting his own body in front of Tony and bracing against the chest that knocked into him in an attempt to reach the other guy. Tony's hand curled quickly around the fabric of Steve's shirt, ready to just shove him off without thinking about it, but Steve held firm. He was good at that. "Tony, seriously, you're only gonna get into more shit if you start a fight with him here," Steve spoke quickly up at Tony, ignoring the confused whispers of the growing crowd around him, "if he's done something real bad, just wait until after school, at least. But you've already got fifty cameras on you. They see you taking the first swing and no amount of lawyers are gonna be able to save you from the court case."
The session finished up at 5, and as soon as Steve was out the door he’d pulled out his phone, checking the new message that’d buzzed during the hour. One was from Clint, asking him to send pictures of the science homework ASAP, and the other two were from Tony, telling Steve to ring him. Although when he did try, it only went through to voicemail, so Steve figured he must have missed his window. Damn therapy, ruining everything with all its stupid feelings-talk.
was all he needed. After that, he shut the phone off and opened up a new folder on his private database. He’d deal with the two of them later—he had a billion questions he wanted answers to, but they were going to have to wait. Maybe later he could get in touch with Stark himself, ask him what the hell had led him to finding all this information out.
that the idea of permanence, the concept of maybe actually doing this with Steve, together, was… it was there. It was attainable.
Steve and Thor looked at one another, then back to Tony while he was quiet, undoubtedly listening to Ty on the other end of the line. Tony snorted at whatever it was the other boy said. “Ty, the drugs charges alone would send you down… yeah, I know I was in on it too, but out of the two of us, which one has more to lose? You just played your ace card last night—you got nothing on me any more, sweetheart. So by all means, take this to the cops. But out of you and Steve, I promise, you’ll be the one who’ll come out of it worse. And you know me, Tiberius. I don’t make promises I can’t fucking keep.” With that, he pulled the phone away from his ear and ended the call, throwing it back onto the couch with a soft thud. He looked over at Steve. “He’ll drop it,” he said, his voice certain.
He couldn’t let Steve keep doing this to him. No matter how much he loved him, Tony just couldn’t. Deep down, he knew it wasn’t right.
He huffed a little, head leaning back against the cushions of the couch. “God, I don’t know. I’d been doing okay in the beginning- I hadn’t used to go to this highschool, y’know. Went to a fancy place for ‘gifted kids’ and everything. I got into MIT by the time I was fourteen, did you know that? That’s where I met Rhodey, actually.”
Steve snorted and then picked up the ten dollars from the table. He glanced at it for all of a second before launching forward and shoving it down Tony’s collar, which earnt him a horrified yelp and a quite adorable spasm as his fingers tickled the back of his neck.
and now these were the consequences of his actions. This was the aftermath of everything that he’d done
With Tony at his back and New York in front of him, Steve sat on the roof and watched the Sun setting over his city.
“I…uh, remember we had- uh- plans? Your big party at the tower! and then you and me were going to catch a movie afterward? I don’t… I mean, obviously, you’ve got other plans, and that’s fine, I don’t mind, honestly,” Tony assured him, blustering around back and forth between his two feet and generally looking like he’d rather be anywhere else than in Steve’s room.
fifteen, don’t worry,” and then he pushed them both forward toward the table with a clap of his hands. “Guys, look who I found!”
“Wow,” Tony chokes, gripping Steve’s hand a little tighter as he looks at the truly beautiful piece of art in front of him.
Steve just rolled his eyes and then stepped sideways, letting their shoulders brush together lightly once more. Thor didn’t speak up for a little while, and his body remained unnaturally still. A droplet of water slid slowly down the centre of his nose as he remained stoically staring into the same spot on Sarah Rogers’ grave.
“I am currently sat in the passenger seat of the car which Sir used in order to make his way here last night,” the AI said smoothly, whilst Steve’s eyes went wide, “I need you to grab the system in which I have been downloaded into and bring me upstairs so that I can complete a full health check upon Sir myself.”
Tony stumbled forward, taking Steve’s hand in his shaking fingers and holding on desperately. He wasn’t above begging, never had been. For Steve, to keep Steve, he’d do just about anything, as shown from the events of the last few stupid
“Absolutely not,” Mr. Wilson said immediately, voice hard, “Steve, you’re already on thin ice with the school as it is, you can’t let your attendance fall, and I won’t lie to the school about where you are.”
Tony felt something cold settle in his gut as they talked amicably around him. Something bitter. They’d brought War Machine in- as they goddamn should’ve, obviously- and hadn’t missed Tony. And Rhodey… Rhodey was probably a better Iron Man than he was anyway. He followed the rules and knew the right plays and he didn’t piss around on the comms. Steve would probably appreciate that. If Rhodey stayed on while Tony was off, they were all probably going to realise how irritating working with Tony really was.
With a scowl, Tony toed a baby shirt out of his path into the bathroom, where he brushed his teeth and took a shower. He heard Steve come in half-way through, but there was no tell-tale burbling or crying that implied Peter was with him. At least Steve had actually given him to Thor for the night. Because this was their time, and they were supposed to be having fun, not sulking in the shower.
The man’s head turned stiffly to him; something strange in his gaze. There was an unnerving lack of emotion in his eyes, and Tony felt his hackles rise instinctively. At his side, he could sense Natasha doing the same. This just felt… wrong. But still, the man smiled again, the little twitch pulling his mouth up a fraction of an inch. “Seems an awful lot of equipment to buy for a baby you were only holding onto for 24 hours,” he said, waving a hand over to the high-chair in the kitchen and the now-empty boxes of toys and equipment stacked up in the corner of the room, ready to be taken out by the cleaners.
Oh. Fuck, yeah, that was probably important. Steve shot off the first part of his old address in Brooklyn, before cutting off jerkily as he remembered that that wasn’t his home any more. That place was probably stripped bare and put up for sale for some random stranger to poke and prod and look in, now. Ha.
“Yeah, but I just…” Tony blinked and looked up at the ceiling, smiling bashfully as he waved a hand around the room, “I just want to tell you again. You do
“Thank you,” he said quietly, and Bucky turned to look at him with a wry smile, but Steve just pushed on, “for always having my back. Even if it does mean you do stupid shit like this because of it, you mad mother-hen.”
Tony knew about his life. He knew what Steve did, because he had to. And honestly- Steve had gotten in fights with 90% chance of mortality; he’d brawled with the best and been put through the worst and most horrifying that the underworld of New York had to offer- but to this day, the most terrifying thing Steve had ever done was admit to Tony about the life he led. The prospect of losing him had been overwhelming, it had sent Steve into a panic- he’d put it off for months in his fear of the response. But when he finally, finally managed to tell him the truth, Tony had barely even batted an eye.
Steve snorted and threw a bandage at the gap between his eyes, before catching it swiftly and then turning back to the sink in order to fill up a bowl of warm water. He could sense the pout his best friend was making behind him, so he rolled his eyes and turned around again.
She raised her eyebrows and smiled at him. But it was strained. Tony could tell. “How’re you adjusting,” she said as she walked further in and looked at his leg, stuck out awkwardly in front of him. “Bet that’s gonna be annoying.”
Tony thought, glaring over at the other group. They were one the right side, where the one exit was. His first thought was that they’d probably rigged the entire basement floor to blow, but he quickly discarded that one. Once you left this corridor, everything beyond it was volatile enough to destroy the entire city, should it be tampered with. These guys didn’t look the type for that.
“I promise you, they’re never going to get those weapons on the market,” Tony told Steve with utter conviction in his voice, pushing him back onto the stool. “Do you trust me? Because I need—I need you to trust me here. They won’t leave American soil.”
“It must have been some truly spectacular ass you were tapping,” Natasha commented idly, raising an eyebrow at Tony, “I take my hat off to you, Stark.”
"Oh, those are some famous last words," Bruce said with a small grin, patting Steve on the shoulder before backing up. "I'll be up early so we can get started on the DNA testing. For now, I think that everyone should get back to bed. It's late."
“No, sweetheart,” Steve told him, “no, it really isn’t. We’re people, and we’ve been through a lot. Being perfect every day is never going to happen.”
“Thank you,” he said quietly, looking up at her. She curled an arm through his and walked them both up the steps. That was a great thing about Natasha- people got out of the way when she walked through a crowd. It was probably the face- the combination of strikingly gorgeous and utterly murderous was always one to strike fear into the souls of even the toughest teenagers.
Later that night, after having managed to finally tire each other out, Tony lay with his cheek rested on Steve’s chest, fingers trailing lightly over the taut skin of his lover’s bicep. Steve was still conscious in some sense, but his eyes were shut and he was motionless, limbs loose and body pliant.
Tony looked at Steve, suddenly feeling a hundred times smaller. It just… it all seemed so absurd to him. Halloween was supposed to be fun, but Steve was so upset by all of it. It was like someone had gone and poured cold water all down Tony’s neck. He didn’t know what to say, so he said the first thing popped into his head. “Can’t you… Why can’t you just have fun on the one day that normal people are gonna accept you?”
Steve kept his eyes fixed on the shirt he was folding in front of him. “Birthday plans,” he lied, before spinning around to face Tony, preparing to usher him back out of the door.
“He’s there, Steve. He’s okay,” Bucky repeated quietly, voice laced with sadness as he looked down at Steve.
. Every action had been made of his own volition. Tony had been worried about him and Steve had punched him, and he’d thought it was what Tony deserved. Tony had been acting the way he always acted on that talk-show; chatty and flirty and confident, and Steve had hit him and called him a whore and vehemently believed it was the right thing to do.
Thor cast a glance into the small crowd, and his eyes stopped on one of the boys in the back. Dark, greasy hair and a tall frame, with blank eyes that just stared back impassively. Something crossed Thor’s face for a second- something horribly sad- before it blanked out and the look of disdain returned in full force.
Rocket eyed it, something falling in his face as he snatched it out of Steve’s hands. For a moment, Steve thought that Rocket was going to tell him to fuck off, but then instead the raccoon just sighed and threw it around in his palms a few times. “Quill loved these fucking things,” he said quietly, “had a bunch of ‘em. One time, after me and the rest of the Guardians nearly goddamn killed ourselves by sharing the force of the power stone, Quill gave one of these little guys to Yondu and played it off to be a fucking infinity stone. It was so dumb. Quill was…
Honestly, it felt less real than it had when Steve was hitting him. Breaking up was just… absurd. Not even in Tony’s realm of possibility. They were—they were
Later that night, he lay back on his bed and held his phone up about an inch from his face, smiling up at the barrage of texts Tony was sending him about some argument he’d been having with Bruce earlier that evening. It was adorable, really- watching him get so frustrated over something Steve could barely even get his head around- and he laughed to himself in the empty room, glad Tony couldn’t hear and get offended.
There were moments, some survivors Steve had talked to said—moments before things happened, when they felt like they just knew, deep in their bones, that something was going to change their entire world in those next few seconds. A woman in her forties; Katheryn, Steve think she was called—told him that before her son was turned to dust, she’d looked into her little boy’s’ eyes and just known, deep in her soul, that these were their last few moments together, and so she’d told him she’d loved him as quick as she could, and sure enough, a moment later he’d been gone.
him, and Tony… well, he’d take that. If it meant that they’d stay, he could take it. Once all of this was over and is memories were back, he’d probably stop thinking about it all together. Shove it back down into that dark little hole where it belonged, never to be heard of again.
Tony was breathing heavily. Obviously now the drugs had worn off a little and he was in the middle of a pretty severe comedown. He looked like shit- tired eyes and slightly pale face, but with cheeks flushed an angry red. He turned his head down and stared at Steve for a few moments, probably debating whether or not to start telling at him instead- but in the end he just pushed off turned on his heel.
“I… I got mugged,” Steve shut his eyes and then winced when the cotton swab Tony had been working over his cut hit a particularly sore spot, “sorry. I’m okay, though. I’ll be heading back to Nat’s in a little while.”
Sometimes Steve forgot most people didn’t know about Tony’s genius tendencies- and that Tony didn’t want the information shared, either.
God, it hurt. It hurt so fucking much. Tony felt like he was tearing out his own heart with every photograph on the wall that he laid his eyes on. All of this was his fault. Steve Rogers, Captain America: literally picked for the strength of his heart, the kindness in his soul- and Tony had managed to twist him into something unrecognisable. Something cruel.
Steve didn’t have time to try and process Tony’s shock-fuelled words. He just pressed a frantic kiss to the man’s cold forehead, thanked God for their luck, and then slid around the side of the car in order to deal with whoever it was that had decided to try and shoot Tony Stark in broad daylight.
Tony hummed, the vibration tickling Steve’s neck. “I know,” he said through a breath of air, and then a second later, Steve felt him go limp. Fast asleep.
The door slammed again with a final thud, and Steve just looked through the small gap under the bed, mouth hanging open in complete shock. He couldn’t even believe that had happened- that those sorts of words had been said to a child, to
That couldn’t be right, there had to be more. It had been an active HYDRA site when Steve had headed in. Where the Goddamn hell had the rest of them gone? “Do their vitals match up to Steve’s?”
Peter writhed in Tony's arms, and he pulled another face as he tried to settle him with gentle noises that did absolutely nothing. "Bruce can't do shit, he's not a pediatrician," Tony stood off the bed as well, turning to face Steve with the squirming mass tucked against his chest. "Look, can you hold him for a second? I have no idea what I'm doing-"
“Steve,” he turned his head back to the speaker of his name quickly, already feeling the blush crawling up his cheeks. Tony had turned to look back up at him, and Steve noted the way his eyes had widened a little. He looked surprised. A little…
“I don’t know why you feel the need to be a dick at any given opportunity,” Steve cut in immediately, holding tight to his bag as he stood straight in front of the taller boy, “I don’t know where you get off at from making other people feel like shit, either- but all it makes you is an asshole who no one actually likes, you know. It doesn’t make you tough shit. You’re not bigger ‘cause you pick on little fucking kids or dig in the places that you know would hurt someone, and I assure you, if I see you doing it to
On a completely irrelevant note, he bet that if he kissed Tony now, he’d probably taste faintly like the strawberries Steve had seen him eating for lunch.
“Would you expect me to apologise on Armistice Day?” Steve asked quietly, “if I jumped because Thor popped his bag of chips too close to me and I nearly flipped a table? Would you think I needed to be sorry for that?”
“I understand that you’re trying to look out for me,” Steve admitted after a moment, sighing loudly, “and I get that I haven’t been my best this year. But you- you can’t just hide me away from the rest of the world and refuse to let anything unpredictable touch me. I’m my own person and I won’t let you do that.”
And then, as the realization hit him, he sprang vertically off the couch and landed on his feet with his hands raised. Steve looked up at him in confusion, but Tony just whooped, fist pumping the air. “I remember!” He yelled, looking at the other man in ecstasy, “I remember the suits! Steve! I remember them!”
“Nnnrgh,” Clint muttered as Tony walked forward with a laugh, “I don’t give a shit. Not my husband.”
Steve nodded, mentally bracing himself when he heard the phone shuffle as Sam passed it over. In the end, though, it wasn’t that bad. Mr. Wilson was more concerned than angry, asking questions and whether or not they needed to come over and get Steve home. Steve declined—he’d had to tell them about Tony being kicked out of the house, but he didn’t feel like it was his place to tell the Wilsons why or what exactly had happened, so he’d left the explanation rather brief. He didn’t want to imagine the looks on their faces if they saw the state of Tony just then.
Tony has to admit, he was kind of distracted with the other works of art in the room to look much at what Steve was creating, but once he sets his eyes on it, it’s rather hard to look away.
Tony wordlessly extended a hand, and Clint passed it over. He’d check it over later. A few more comments were made, but ultimately they’d done pretty good, and there wasn’t anything else that needed working on. Steve breathed out, running a hand through his hair as he glanced at Tony. “Anyone fancy working through the second rout—”
Steve watched a silent tear slip slowly down Tony’s face, and he leaned forward and gently wiped it away with his thumb. They smiled at one another, their hands holding each other so tight it was damn near painful. “Go back to sleep,” Steve told him, “I’ll be here when you wake up.”
Tony had gone totally nuts, screaming at him until his voice got caught in his throat and he started to choke up. Steve was so distraught by the sight of Tony like that that he just hadn’t had it in him to try again.
Sam didn’t say anything- but his hand rose and squeezed against Steve’s shoulder. “Well, you’ve done fucking great so far, dude. Honestly- I’m kind of shocked. When dad said we were taking in a fifteen year old guy rather than the usual foster kids, I thought it was going to go… very differently.  You’ve been better than any of us could have imagined.”
“Tony, hey, wait,” Steve said, but Tony was already turning and heading for their room, Peter still tapping absently against the reactor casing. He was a warm little mound against Tony’s chest, and it was nice. He could admit that. Babies were totally annoying and dumb and useless, true, but there were some benefits. Like a ready-made excuse to run from awkward situations. That was a definite plus.
He shook his head and took a breath. That wasn’t now. That was done. Bucky was back, and he was stronger than ever.
Steve smiled, watching as Tony shuffled on his feet for a few moments. He seemed… nervous. A little erratic, just like he got when he was on the verge of a huge discovery.
how it sounds to hear you screaming through the comm like that as you fall through the air without your fucking suit-“
She shrugged, picking at her nails like she always did when she was stressed, “Our imaginations went into overdrive. I may have helped him on that front, and that’s my fault. But I was worried, and Bucky was worried, and then we just sort of got caught in a spiral. It ended with Bucky convinced Tony was blackmailing you into sniffing five lines of coke and then going back to his mansion to have wild drug-fuelled sex.”
“One day, friend,” Thor sighed happily, eyes glazing over as he began to daydream, “one day he’ll make me angry when he’s near a trash can, and I will fulfill the lifelong dream of throwing him into the garbage where he belongs.”
Steve huffed, leaning back against the wall of tower and looking down at the buildings. Tony spared him a glance; the orange light bouncing off his face, the breeze whipping up the hairs that strayed across his forehead and the smile on his lips that had been there pretty much permanently since the day had begun.
For a brief second, he found himself glancing up. Past the ceiling, past the sky that separated them.
“Now, we all know I am not one to believe the rumours,” Sam began with, which was a) a total fucking lie- Sam was a gossip and the world knew it- and b) not a very good way to start a sentence. Steve figured that his sense of embarrassment was about to get a whole lot worse. “But basically… I was on the phone to Nat this morning, who’d just been on a jog with Jan who had slept over at Carol’s who had been at some party last night, and
“Steve?” And that was his teacher calling him, shit- he jerked his head back off the desk and then blinked at the empty classroom. “Did you not hear the bell?”
Afterward; when Tony was spent and exhausted against Steve’s chest, curled into the space where he fit perfectly, Steve let himself check the phone that he’d ignored pretty much all day. There were some updates from Pepper, saying how all the demos and PR trips had gone smoothly, and the predicted figures were hitting above expected already. He checked the time: still a couple of hours before they released it to the public—apparently there were people queuing out the door for it, which was fairly typical in a Stark Product. Tony’s designs were the best in the world and Steve didn’t blame people for getting enthusiastic over them.
He swallowed, turning to the man sat behind the desk in the main corridor. The guy was typing away at his computer, but when he felt Steve watching, he looked upward. “Can I—”
How could you-” He couldn’t finish, his throat wouldn’t work; and he was still trying to pull away but it was weak, and Steve was on his knees, fingers shaking as they curled around Tony’s waist, whispering broken apologies into Tony’s stomach, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I love you, I’ll make it up to you, I’m sorry baby, please-”
“-Shhhh,” Steve murmured as he walked out of the door once more, this time with Tony in his arms, “Safe, Shh.”
His heart did a little spasm in his chest, and he sighed, thumb hovering over the answer button for a few seconds before he pressed down on it. Might as well get it over with now- the excuse, the apology Tony had undoubtedly already prepared. Steve would accept it, of course he would. It was
They all murmured their agreements and quickly moved on, but Tony noticed that Steve was quiet beside him- he hadn’t ever thought a man could eat potatoes morosely, but Steve seemed to be doing it pretty well. When Tony squeezed his thigh and raised his eyebrows askingly, however, Steve merely schooled his face back into a smile and then shook his head, quickly slipping back into the conversation and giving Tony the impression it wasn’t something that needed talking about.
The man was pink-cheeked, tamping down a bashful smile as he looked at Tony. He was leaning forward, closer than usual. And his arm was raised, bent awkwardly above them.
His eyes closed with a defeated little hitching of his breath. He felt a hand press against his cheek.
“-well this sounds heated,” Tony said in amusement as he slipped down into the seat next to Steve and then smiled in greeting. Steve just harrumphed, shooting Sam a very dirty glare from over the table.
Chin up, eyes hard, he walked into the kitchen, steadfastly ignoring Steve’s presence as he directed himself to the coffee machine.
So that meant he was probably going to have to just suck it up and face Tony at some point, then. How completely terrible.
“Can you wait a few minutes for Thor to get here?” Bruce asked, and Steve glanced up at him, “I know that the connection’s been broken—I just – I can’t take any chances, Steve. We already failed to help him the first time around. I… I can’t let it happen again.” Bruce’s face was tight and the guilt in his expression was obvious- Steve supposed they were all blaming themselves too, to some extent. For not noticing. For letting the signs slip under their radars, because they were
And, a few moments later, with a guttural moan into Tony’s bruised skin, Steve did. He shuddered and pulled Tony impossibly close, enough that it felt like every inch of them was connected, and then he sunk into the bed with a heavy sigh, arms wrapping themselves around Tony’s back. They stayed there for a while. Just catching their breath. Feeling one another. Tony felt like he was somewhere else; like the only thing in the universe was Steve’s embrace, and from the way Steve was holding him, it seemed as if his thoughts were being reflected right back at him.
Someone like Tony- someone with that much potential, with that much… inherent goodness in him- he didn’t belong in the life he’d chosen for himself. Jesus, he could have gotten into college already if he put his mind to it, Steve bet. With the ability to create robots like he had, Steve didn’t doubt it even for a moment.
Tony watched him go, before turning back to Steve and running gentle fingers through his hair in greeting. “Hey, babe. You doing okay?”
He turned his head; looked out through the crack in his curtains where the streetlight and the orangey glow from the sky looked back at him, and realized that she was right. He’d started to let himself be happy. He had friends- good friends who were there for him and who understood him. A home where he was loved and people who he could rely on, even though they weren’t his official family. He felt as if he actually wanted to get up and
“What’re you smiling at,” Tony mumbled, propping his chin up against Steve’s sternum and looking at him questioningly, and Steve blinked, realising that Tony was right and a fond, absent-minded smile had been plastered over his face for the duration of his little daydream.
With a sigh, he shook his head and continued, his hand going to the door. Taking one last short breath and steeling himself, he pulled it open.
“What were you saying?” Steve asked, grinning like a smug bastard as he took in Tony’s slack face. He dipped in for a soft kiss, hand winding around Tony’s wrist before snatching the bag out of it with a laugh. “All talk, Stark. That’s what you are.”
His heart felt heavy and he ached. It should have been cathartic, getting rid of something that was causing Steve pain, but it just didn’t feel like enough. He needed to do more.
“Tony?” he asked, pulling off the helmet when they ground to a halt just outside. “Where the hell are we?”
Steve rolled his eyes, plucking the cigarette from Tony’s fingers and trying not to wince as a mound of rubble landed somewhere close to them, making the ground quake and the air ripple. “Back in the forties, they used to think smoking cured asthma, you know.”
I was lonely and all the neighbourhood kids would rather spit at me and call me a freak than play goddamn tag with me. I was lonely and my own parents chose to ignore me, or- y’know- just hit me if I was being annoying enough, so they weren’t exactly up for it either.”
“Huh, you ever considered the fact that maybe if you’d given more of a shit about your fucking boyfriend I wouldn’t have had to go haul ass down here to pick him up in the first place?” Tony asked, cocking his head, and Steve knew that look- he was gearing up for a fight, he was getting battle ready- “Who the fuck thinks it’s a good idea to send someone who doesn’t know where the fuck they’re going or what parts of the town are safe off to get pizza? On his own? Whilst all your fucking phones are switched off? I’m not the one who fucked him over today,
Tony gasped, feeling the heat as it warmed the armour plates. The temperature gauge started to rise up in his HUD. He moved his focus between observing the fire-guy and watching as yet another body rounded the corner. This one moved differently; there was a smoothness to his motions that gave it away even before Tony saw the sleek metal underneath his uniform. It was the robot one. Clint and Natasha were on him immediately, however, leaving Tony with the Pyro and Steve with the two speedsters.
Steve cracked a small smile. His thoughts had drifted to Tony again, surprise surprise. “Crystal,” he answered, hand going back to the door as Rhodey stepped through it. “Also, I’m just gonna formally apologize on Bucky’s behalf. I’m guessing from the last time you saw us all that your impression of him is- uh- not that great. But it was all just a misunderstanding and-“
He tried to make his mouth move into an ‘I love you’, but he wasn’t even sure whether he did that right. Somewhere in his periphery, he saw Thanos lean down, pick up the gauntlet, and then everything went dark.
“Who initiated?” Clint got straight to the point, rolling onto his bed and looking at him from upside-down, “it was Tony, wasn’t it? Was he a good kisser? What base did you g-“
So he went on with his life. He stayed in Wakanda and thought about the fact he’d just lost everything,
Tony sighed in dismay, worry fluttering around in his belly. “But this isn’t healthy and I’m worried sick!” He exclaimed, “Steve, you look like death, I
, and then suddenly everyone else backs down and leaves me and Steve to do everything, to have him every night, and you’ve seen how goddamn difficult he can be, but for some reason we’re doing it all the time, which—which is totally unfair because as you can tell, he’s a fucking nightmare, and it’s dumb anyway, because he can’t… he
There wasn’t a message waiting for him when he opened his phone, but that wasn’t unduly concerning. It was rare either of them had the time to type out a message while on a high-stakes mission. Instead, Tony pulled up the encrypted link to Steve’s vitals report, intending to give that a quick glance through instead.
“Steve, kid, please, next time you have any kind of emergency, let us know before hand,” Mr. Wilson told him toward the end of the call, “that’s non-negotiable. You cannot just leave the house at midnight without telling anyone, okay? That’s not how it works in this house.”
He waved back fondly, rolling his eyes as they all bounded away again a few moments later, pushing and shoving at one another. God only knew how they still had the energy to run around anywhere- still young and full of life, he figured.
Tony hummed, shuffling his hand out from between their chests in order to press his fingers against the sharp jut of Steve’s jaw. “I might mess up again,” he whispered, “I’ll try, Steve, I will, but I’m still learning about everything. It might take a while.”
to, of course… but I think you should take that opportunity.” He tucked a loose strand of Tony’s hair behind his ear and swallowed. “You need a break, Tony. This is killing you. I won’t force you into anything—but nothing terrible is going to happy if you miss a few days, you know?”
“No visible results,” she declared, clipped, “more tests will be done tomorrow in order to see whether the test subject reacts to different stimuli.”
“We are indeed talking, Mr. Rogers,” the AI actually sounded amused, which was pretty amazing, really, “there is no other explanation for the exchange of words across one intelligent being to another.”
Tony shrugged, his cheeks just going the slightest shade of pink. “I… uh, I thought you might all be asleep? I didn’t want to wake your whole family by ringing the doorbell at midnight.”
It’s probably a mixture of alcohol and overwrought emotions that does it in the end, but suddenly he’s stumbling forward and his mouth is on Steve’s and he’s kissing him with every emotion that he’ll never be able to speak about and hoping that Steve knows; that he’d understand, just for a moment, quite how much he means to Tony.
“Pretending you’re okay now. Let your whole… the whole ‘Jolly Viking’ persona go for a bit. I don’t mind.”
Blood. There was blood all over his hands, Steve could still see it, even though the water had washed it off. Tony’s brain matter was smeared over Steve’s jacket, which was now neatly bundled into the washing machine, ready to be swept away. His life had simply come and gone. Just like that. Tony Stark was just another speck in the universe, and life had disposed of him- his brilliant mind and his beautiful face and his boundless heart- like it was nothing at all.
There was a moment of quiet, where Tony simply looked down at him and ran his tongue across his lips while a billion different emotions crossed over his face. His eyes were shining like crystals in the sunlight, and his hair stuck up in places where Steve had grabbed it.
Tony grabbed the pillow back from Steve and smacked him with it. Steve spluttered in offence and hit him back. Of course, this ended with Tony pinning him effortlessly a few moments later, hands digging into his sides and tickling him ruthlessly, despite Steve’s loud yelling and ungainly flailing.
“I should probably get a bit of shut-eye,” Tony said eventually, after the next round of silence got too long, “been a long day of doing nothing again. Wish I was wherever this message is being transmitted to. Rhodey, Steve—whoever the hell it is watching this, you gotta do me a solid and keep going, alright? Save people. Possibly fix everything. You know the drill.” He sighed, sadness and regret radiating off his body as he shuffled upright and then raised a hand to what Steve had to assume was his own helmet. “See you all on the other side.”
Bad shit happens, sometimes, and Tony deals with it. He does it as best he can, and sometimes Steve is there to help him through- because for some reason Steve seems to like him more than most- but sometimes he isn’t.
She cocked her head over to him and mouthed ‘how you doing?’, whilst leaning back on her chair and twirling a pen in her fingers. Steve just shrugged, rolling his eyes a little. ‘Okay’, he replied.
Steve nodded slowly, shutting his eyes. “Have you scanned me?” He asked quietly, “my brain. You scan that?”
Tony threw up his hands, looking over Natasha’s shoulder and into the living area where Clint had Peter settled on his lap, feeding him a bowl of something or another. “I don’t know,” he admitted, “could be. But this wasn’t a suicide. Someone came to take her out.”
Stepping out onto the common floor five minutes later, he wasn't entirely sure what he'd been expecting. Mayhem, perhaps. That was closer to what he'd been envisioning, if he was being honest. However, the scene that he took in seemed remarkably serene and somewhat disturbing. Mainly because Tony could see the Black Widow in her full uniform, sat on her belly and looking up at their giant HD TV screen as it played an episode of what appeared to be Peppa Pig.
He finds it difficult to tell people he cares, and show others that he loves them. Sometimes even physical touch or people handing him things makes him uncomfortable, so the Avengers moving in proves difficult at the beginning, because… well, he just isn’t used to that much casual camaraderie and contact being thrown around. Totally new ball game. And it scares the shit out of him.
“I fucking hate people getting involved in my private life, to be honest,” Steve said bitingly, glaring at them both, “fame is not something I give a damn about. All I care about is-“
Tony didn’t answer for a moment, and he wavered dangerously, like his legs were seconds from giving out. Since meeting him all those years ago, he’d barely aged a day. Steve- Steve had developed laugh lines and a few silver hairs, but… well, demons took their power from other beings, and stayed forever young. Angels shouldn’t have aged as quickly as Steve had, either, but he figured that’s what happened when you spent all your time in the company of someone who naturally sucked away your life force.
“Son of a Goddamn bitch,” he breathed, leaning back on his desk chair heavily. It took about ten seconds for him to process the video, the words, the amassing trepidation and realisation of how fucked they all were, before he leaned forward again and quietly fired up his computer.
He was just—sweet. Steve loved him, it was obvious. And Steve took very seriously to people harming those he loved. Tony knew this from experience—God, by the end of his own attempted kidnapping last year, he’d actually felt sorry for the bad guys.
“Don’t tell anyone,” Steve whispered, eyes haunted. “You can’t. They’ll take me off the team if they know how bad it gets, they’ll think I’m crazy. It usually wears off after a few weeks, I just need to wait it out, don’t tell anyone-”
Another second, and then— “It appears they are similar, yes, although everything is spiking erratically. Baseline humans would not be able to deal with this level of physical stress without going into cardiac arrest, so if it is not Captain Rogers, then it is most likely one of the enhanced soldiers he was trying to contain.”
He stepped forward, resisting the urge to outwardly cuss as he leaned up and wrapped his arms gently around Tony’s shoulders. This was not about him right now. His guilt could come later. “I love you,” he said into Tony’s neck, feeling the other boy slip his hands around Steve’s waist and sink into the embrace. “I love you, and this is gonna be okay. I promise it is. We’ll work something out. You and me, yeah?” He pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s jaw. “I’ve got you.”
Steve just shook his head. “It’s alright, I already asked ahead. They said it was fine. Plus the school commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan would be a nightmare.” He cracked a small smile. “Thanks, though. Big of you, considering you two are apparently sworn enemies.”
Steve huffed tiredly, knocking their shoulders together, and he heard Tony’s responding chuckle in the quiet of their elevator. If there was one thing they truly were excellent at, it was fighting and then making up quickly afterward. Practise, mostly. “Of course it is, dummy,” he mumbled in response, “seeing you falling out of buildings with no immediate aerial support is-”
He sighed, pushing back the thoughts and squeezing between the crowds. It had been a hard week. But he was glad he had his friends to fall back on- he was glad they were there. And hell- maybe Sam was thinking along the right lines, maybe he
Steve was staring at the baby like it was a bomb about to go off. He hadn't said a word. Natasha stepped forward, her hair loose and limp around her neck. She tilted her head and squinted. "Did they leave anything else?"
Thor tried to argue it, but his face told a different story, and Steve could see he was already struggling to remain awake. He probably could’ve if he’d shoved some caffeine down his throat, but he didn’t need to. Steve was here to keep watch, and so eventually Thor conceded, making Steve promise to wake him if anything happened. He tucked a corner of Tony’s blanket in under his shoulder absently before he said a quiet goodnight to Steve, the action ultimately useless, but full of obvious affection. “Stay out of trouble ‘til I get back,” he told the sleeping boy, before giving Steve one last nod and stumbling off to his bedroom exhaustedly.
Tony laughed, imagining clean-cut, lovely Steve with a scruffy lumberjack beard. “Yeah, I’m using the first one right now. No shaving for a month, baby.”
Steve raised his eyebrows before leaning in again, his smile pushing into Tony’s mouth. Tony surged up to meet him enthusiastically, and Steve felt… he felt fucking high off it. Tony was
“Alright,” Thor conceded in the end, “if you think that’s what’s best. At the very least, we’ve got guns now.” He waved to the bodies around them and picked up a fallen weapon from the body of a dead HYDRA goon, and then tossed it over to Steve. “Be careful. Don’t take unnecessary risks.”
Somehow, looking at the excited boy as he swooped down and smacked a large kiss against Tony’s cheek, Steve doubted that. “Sure, Tony,” he said through a small laugh that was hidden by his hand- and Tony grinned back at him for a second, before ducking low and dodging another of Thor’s kisses. “No, leave me alone, you brute, I don’t want your love!”
He saw Zeke nod slowly, shrugging. “I think you should be. You’re in too deep, man- running around with Stark, trying to pretend you’re someone. But you’re not. You’re just a nobody. You didn’t even pick the right guy to suck up to, either, instead of someone with actual status you just went to the school whore-“
It was quiet when Tony woke back up from where he’d drifted off on the couch, and he jerked his head upright in surprise. He hadn’t even realised he’d fallen asleep.
“-I have to, I have to see him,” Steve could barely even register what his own mouth was saying, and the restraints were strong but he was stronger (so strong, oh God, he was fucking lethal, a monster), and he ripped his wrists away from the table with a surge of force, feeling his bone groan at the tension, but ultimately hold strong as reinforced metal snapped around him. Natasha’s voice was rising in the room but she wasn’t important, nothing was important other than Tony, lying in some hospital room because
“Yeah, Tony’s apparently a whiz at engineering, he’s been giving us tips on how to keep it structurally sound this whole time,” Clint told him, punching Steve’s arm lightly as his own form of greeting.
She sighed, looking away with an apologetic face. “Sorry,” she muttered, “I don’t mean to… we’re just-“
“Who are you talking to?” Tony turned, spotting Steve as he came through the doors. He was drenched in a sheen of sweat, bottle in one hand and towel in the other. Tony blushed, tipping out the coffee into their mugs separately.
651, 652, 653, 654. Tony rolled his eyes. “You know what? We’re having an electricity-free week when we get home. I refuse to let you near any of it again. You can’t be trusted.”
it was all his fault, he was going to die knowing that he could have prevented this, he could’ve stopped it-
Surprisingly, too, if he was being honest. He didn’t think someone could hurt that much and walk away alive.
But something in his gut was telling him that that was probably not the case. He’d stepped over at least twenty bodies and counting, and like he’d said, no bullets, no signs of any obvious weaponry. Tony doubted whatever HYDRA could concoct would match up to this level of raw strength.
Behind him, Steve laughed, soft and deep and lovely. “I don’t even want to know what you did to piss off George Clooney enough to back away from marriage to Pepper Potts. Must have been bad.”
Everything else he’d loved about the future was gone, and now he just had to carry on. Let the months pass by and try to wade through them.
“She’s not wrong,” Sam said, looking at him fondly even when Steve just rolled his eyes at him. He tried to think of an appropriate way of responding to that, but found himself lacking.
It wasn’t really what he wanted to say. He wanted to say that Tony was stupid for putting all his chips in on Steve, that he should have just left it alone, not provoked Ty like that. He also wanted to say that, despite all of that, there weren’t quite any words for the way that it made Steve feel, to know that Tony would sacrifice all of that for him. It was hard to comprehend, really.
"Math is impossible," Sam declared loudly, "it's official. Literally no one on Earth except nerds and Albert Einstein can do this shit."
The thought of going up to their room made his hands shake worse, however, so after another few seconds to steel himself, he wrapped his hand around the leg of the desk and hauled himself into standing, biting back a groan. Steve really did pack a punch- and that wasn’t even one-tenth of his entire force, really. Tony had calculated it. Tony calculated everything about Steve, these days. Where he stood in the room. How many strides it would take for him to reach Tony. Power and distance per second, impact radius. Stuff like that.
Well. Whatever they’d tried, it had clearly backfired, seeing as every last person except the one in the room with Tony was dead.
“You’re doing it right now, I bet,” Jan laughed a little, patting his arm, “trying to find excuses for what I said because the idea that he might just like you is
It was probably an inappropriate moment to feel the sharp sense of pride on Tony’s behalf- but Steve did anyway. They were too young, too naive to care about anything other than what was in front of them, and Steve was just fine with that. Howard Stark could burn, and Steve would stand at Tony’s side and cheer him through it the entire time if Tony let him.
“You know he’s never going to get it right, right?” Tony asked, turning around from where he was crouched and watching Steve try and cheer DUM-E on as he cut into the bread. “His code just doesn’t allow for anything other than failure.”
stints he’d done in terrorist camps, that was small potatoes. Tony was fine. They hadn’t even tortured him that much, all things considered. Just some electroshock therapy and… And whatever it was that they’d done to his brain.
Tony’s fist clenched. Don’t freak out. This was alright, he could just do something else. Wasn’t like there wasn’t a myriad of other tasks to complete, and the blueprints weren’t urgent. He just… God, why couldn’t Collins just answer his fucking phone? It wasn’t hard. Click a fucking button and help Tony try to translate whatever mess he’d made all over the graph paper. He’d just set himself up and gotten out his angle-measuring ruler and his pencils and now he had to go and put it all away again, so he’d essentially wasted five minutes of precious time. Fucking bullshit, he was firing Collins. Asshole.
Steve awoke softly, gently, quietly, as he always did when pulling himself out from the grip of a horrible nightmare.
Steve too, probably. He was just good enough not to say anything. Yeah, maybe they flirted. A lot. Maybe even enough to make Tony hope, to push a little- even when he knew that ultimately, Steve wouldn’t want anything to do with him.
annoying,” he declared, pointing to his shirt in evidence, “look, he ruined my clothes. Little gremlin,”
Tony chuckled and then looked over to Sam with a shrug. “Wanna go, Wilson?” He asked with a wiggle of his eyebrows, and then Steve laughed at the sight of Sam’s face dropping a little as he held his hands up in the air.
Tony himself was stood at the doorway, having only just walked in from a late night at Stark Industries. He’d been aware that Thor had intended to have a ‘small gathering to celebrate the day of his birth’ that night- but when he looked around the open-plan communal floor, he had to say, it definitely didn’t look like it had been ‘small’. There had to be at least fifteen people passed out on the floor alone. Not even counting those still standing.
“Get fucked, Zeke,” Tony waved, stooping low to collect the bag and rolls of paper he’d dropped by the corner. When he straightened his back up again, he jerked his head down the corridor before looking back at Steve. “You’re getting a lift back home with me,” he muttered.
For the next two minutes he watched, horrified as they – for lack of a better word-- tortured the two-month old baby to try and see whether he would respond. Peter screamed and cried, legs kicking out in distress as he lifted his arms up and begged to be held. But what was worse was that not one single person in the room even batted an eye, except for Lewinsky herself, who began to get slightly agitated toward the end. She eventually motioned for the noise to be cut off, and as the pitch faded away, Peter’s crying remained, loud and horrible and sad.
“That’s—” Tony’s hand flailed around, trying to find the words. He turned to Steve. “He’s not pressing charges,” he told Steve in the end, apparently deciding that it was the best course of action to just ignore Thor entirely.
Steve wasn’t sure why he was quite so obsessed with Tony’s eyes, but it was fast becoming a problem. It was just… the colour of them. So perfect and enrapturing. Everything about Tony was just flawless, though. Eyes, face, hair, body- all of it. Steve wanted to paint him; draw the way his hair fell into his eyes and how his cheek dimpled when he smiled. He could sit there and just look at Tony forever and through each moment, he’d find something else to fixate on. Because Tony was perfect.
Finally, Steve just looked at him once last time more before mumbling an unintelligible excuse and then turning on his heel, walking through the crowds with remarkable speed for a guy so big.
Tony looked up and saw him, his fluffy blond head peeking out over the sofa. He was beaming at Tony as if he were the best thing since sliced bread. “Guys, look!” He said again, bringing his hand down and smacking a shoulder that looked like it could possibly have been Clint’s. It seemed he used enough force that he managed to dislodge Clint from the couch entirely, and Tony watched with a small wince of sympathy as he was sent rolling onto the floor below. Steve, however, seemed not to notice. “Tony’s here guys!”
Ah. Yes. Friends. Important friends that were probably still worried about his safety. And things. Right.
By the time that Peter was clean enough to be let out of the bath, both Steve and Tony were pretty much soaked from the waist up, either by soapy residue or splashback from Peter’s movement. Tony silently mourned the state of what had once been a beautiful silk shirt- but a second later when he watched Steve huff and just decide to pull his own T-shirt off entirely, revealing a perfect upper half that Tony had seen countless times but still never quite got used to, he decided that the sacrifice made had been worth it. “Take him out and dry him off, will you?” He nodded to Peter and then stood up, feeling his knees ache as they extended, “I’ll go get his sleepsuit.”
But when he tried to close his eyes a second later, the sound of the man’s distant screaming filled his ears once more, coming back to him like a horrible record stuck on repeat.
He wasn’t stupid though. He knew that was a long shot. It would be unlikely he’d get out of this without being caught, but… at least Tony would go free. That was what was important in the long run, and Steve had to remember that. Tony was fighting the bigger fight here, and Steve needed to get him out so that he could do that freely.
Steve’s smile ticked a little, and then he sighed. “I don’t wanna watch a horror movie, Tony,” he said with a note of finality in his voice, “you can put something else on if you want, but no horror.”
Staring at the sea of open and vulnerable faces, looking up to him for advice, it swept over him with a horribly sort of realization. If he let the lesson go, then they’d not get an answer. And if they didn’t get an answer, then they could end up getting their ass beat in a relationship too. And Tony... maybe he could take it, but these kids?
Neither of them said anything for a few seconds, and all Tony could hear was Steve’s breathing. He wanted to move, to stand up so he was a little better defended, but he realised with a horrifying lurch that he was simply too terrified. Steve might kick him, and one of those feet would probably go straight through his ribs.
Steve nodded, because it was true. Because he didn’t know enough about time travel to even give a hypothesis, and all he could do was hope. “At least there might not be a rift between us when Thanos comes,” Steve murmured, “at least we have the chance of being together.”
But then Tony had to leave; a lab experiment that was very time sensitive, and Steve told him not to blow himself up, and Tony pinky-sweared before walking off with his hands in his pockets and his hair dancing in the wind. Steve just watched him go, along with most of the rest of the kids in the parking lot. Tony drew attention like a magnetic attraction, and at any one point there were always eyes on him.
But it had all moved on so quickly. Steve had worked everything out eventually and ended up genuinely doting on the boy, and Tony had too, and it’d all started to feel so terrifyingly
“Exactly,” Thor said beside him, wrapping his arm delicately around Tony’s shoulder, “and we’re not leaving. Not for anything, okay? It’s always been me and you, hasn’t it— getting through highschool, one shitty day at a time? You’re not alone; I goddamn won’t let you be. I need someone to braid my hair for me at morning break, and I sure as hell am not asking Sunset to do it.”
With a sigh, Steve let his head come to rest on top of Tony’s. “Sorry for waking you,” he mumbled, “just go back to sleep honey.”
Tony kisses him again before he can finish the sentence, because now he’s aware that Steve actually, for whatever reason, wants him too, there is no stopping him. Steve is a hell of a kisser, and Tony wants more.
And then he was off again, crouching down with Natasha and waving a finger toward one of the rafters in the ceiling. Tony simply watched, breaths shallow, vision hazy. He couldn’t move. Could barely even talk.
“I’d like to say I am not a stray- I was coming over here anyway,” Bruce muttered, sitting down next to Sam with a huff, “and can we just put it on record that I hate Thor. I hate Tony for introducing me to Thor as well.”
There was a deep sigh, and then Steve watched Paul move his hand to the dial on the radio and turn it down a few notches. He brought his other hand out and placed it on Steve’s shoulder warmly. “How many times do I have to ask you to call me by my first name?”
Tony chuckled to himself once more, before it merged into a little snore. Steve wondered if he’d even been awake at all whilst he’d been making that machine.
“Don’t worry you guys, you’ll all soon have husbands and wives of your own. No need to feel jealous, your time will come,” he promised them, cackling as the whole group groaned in frustration.
Tony jumped wildly, looking up at the opening door. He put his hand around the gun he kept under his desk, not too sure why. Comfort, maybe. Not that he needed it. It was Steve.
"You need to sit down," Steve said, folding his arms. Tony stepped walking and turned around, looking at him in amusement.
Tony just waited a few seconds until Steve was finished having his small moment of panic, and then positively beamed when Steve looked up at him the next time around. “You better fucking catch me, Stark, I swear to Christ.”
“JARVIS,” he gasped, already turning around and lurching out of his walk-in wardrobe and over to their bed, unable to hold off any longer, “pulse, now, give it to me.”
The rest of his sentence failed to leave his throat, as Rumlow chose that moment to do an admittedly amazing flip, dislodging Steve’s grip on his arm and then somehow ending up reversing the manoeuvre that had been used on him, resulting with Steve being the one in the chokehold instead. Before he could even hope to counter, Rumlow snaked his fingers around Steve’s waist, digging right into the deep cut he’d created a minute earlier. Steve screamed.
patting him on the head and assuring him he’d grow enough to part the crowds one day, but until then he’d have to bear being shoved and prodded with elbows.
It was light when the world blurred back into focus. Steve could feel it against his closed eyelids. He must have been out for quite a while. He was also pretty comfortable, which was strange, all things considered. He’d sort of thought he might be waking up in a jail cell, or not waking up at all, so the soft sheets were nice. And there was talking, too. A familiar pair of voices: one dry British, the other sarcastic American, both of them rattling off quips to one another like an old married couple. The familiarity of it brought back memories of an old life, where things had been easy and the world had been kinder. It made him want to smile.
He put the tablet down back on the desk and then shifted nervously on the stool where he was sat. Steve just watched, waiting for something. The oncoming anger. The yelling. Tony telling him that he’d done what needed to be done, and he’d fixed Steve up, and now Steve needed to get out of his life, for good this time. It wouldn’t be any less than what he deserved.
Tony vaulted the countertop and jogged toward him, heart racing. He didn’t know what had happened to Steve, but it was
And right under the signpost, Tony was leaning casually; his collar turned up and his hands tucked away in his pockets as his foot scuffed absently along the pavement, back and forth, back and forth. He was staring at the wall, hair messed up and wild, and when he breathed out, Steve watched a plume of smoke billow from his mouth once more; the tendrils curling and wafting until disappearing into the still night. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut and he leaned his head back against the post, the picture of bliss, if only for a second before it faded back into neutrality. Steve watched him lift slender fingers up to his mouth, slot the cigarette between his lips and suck a deep breath inward, before repeating the action of before, throat exposing itself as he tipped his head back once again.
Tony turned to Steve, who just blushed and then shrugged. “I wanted to make sure,” he mumbled, “and anyway, I went and got the table for us!”
Steve was struck dumb by the weight of Tony’s words, mouth simply hanging open like it was the only thing his face knew how to do. Tony was looking up at the ceiling, and even in the halflight Steve could see the faint flush on his sharp cheeks, the nervous tap of his fingers. Emotions were dangerous to Tony. But he was letting them out anyway. For Steve.
It reminded him of his ma. Staying through the bruises, through the screaming. Joseph Rogers, while he’d been around, had been scum. But Sarah hadn’t left. Because she’d had a duty to Steve, maybe. Or maybe just because she’d still loved him, under all that. Steve had never asked.
Tony stopped in the middle of the path, looking at Steve with his eyebrows raised. Steve paused too, chin raised stubbornly. Because fuck backing down, he was right and he knew it. He was never going to just stand there and let people talk about Tony like that. Treat him like that.
Rocket grunted. “I dunno, we heard about a bunch of warlocks who managed to use the stone without exploding into a thousand little pieces by sharing out the power between them, and then we tried it. Amazingly, it worked. God knows why. Maybe we were just too stubborn to die.”
