<< There is a door on the back. We found tire marks. The maid confirmed that Ford's car is missing from the garage. They went away with it >> Greg anticipates. << The car was found just four miles from here, in an isolated area and out of CCTV surveillance. They must have got into another car and God only knows where they ended up >>.
<< No. Neither that, nor anything else. The only thing we can do is study the area and speculate where the corpses come from >>.
<< I haven't learned. So I was born >> answers and John find an unusual sad note in Sherlock's voice. Morgan leans over to lick Sherlock's hand and receives a caress from him.
The doctor just nods to the inspector, without giving too much weight to his words. John follows the track on the carpet, which from the stairs seems to divide in two directions: one door to the bathroom, the other to a closed door.
<< I hope this is really going on, Greg >> John whispers, serious. << I hope that Sherlock is there, to risk being strangled by a crowd of tourists and club staff. I prefere this, instead that to know he is dead frozen >>.
<< Kind of him >> he smiles. << But it also happens to me, sometimes, very rarely, to make mistakes >>.
<< Call it ‘Stockholm syndrome’ if you want. He's not even my type, I have to be really traumatized >> Sherlock plays down with a chuckle.
<< Or, much more likely, he will blame his wife for what happened by forcing her to end her work and passions >> says Sherlock. William nods resignedly and John gives his partner a stern look.
<< Your brother is right >> says Sherlock, capturing the attention of the three Lestrade. << That's their purpose, Lizzy. They want to
<< There are so many things to throw them in jail for life >> Greg nods. << You know well, however, that I will have to report and do not want to hear about exclusive journalism and similar bullshit, Fox >>.
<< You have been very good. Have you seen how many results you have achieved? In a little while you will be able to jump on it >>.
<< Quite >> the brother replies, bringing a glass of fresh water to Sherlock's lips, from which he takes a few sips.
The door of 221 B closes behind them. In the silence, amplified by the absence of Mrs. Hudson, visiting her sister, Sherlock and John go up the 17 steps, next to each other. In those three months, the patter of Morgan's paws had accompanied every ascent and descent. He had jumped on them when they came back home, alone or together. It is strange not to have him among them, ready to crouch at his kennel at the foot of the bed and, then, jump at their feet as soon as they felt asleep.
<< Morgan is smarter than you, Anderson >> the consultant shouts loudly, walking beyond the main door.
He never considered himself beautiful. His face was judged expressionless by some and by the disturbing mimicry by others and, although he persist in saying that he is disinterested in the judgment of others, these considerations still weigh today as boulders. Sherlock has always been proud, however, of his eyes and hair. The cut, the shape and the particular color of his eyes have given him many positive awards. Even when they were judged disturbing, the judgment was expressed in a fascinated tone. The eyes of the man in the mirror are circled in black, tired and frightened. The sclera of the right eye, the one involved in the blow taken to the head, is bruised with broken capillaries that make it disgusting and terrible to look at. The color of the irises, then, is a dull gray, without any hope.
<< A proof of the case of the victim of the Spa >> he says to the girl. << Can you verify that the organic traces correspond with those found on the victim? >>.
<< They are not men! >> he exclaims loudly, then bringing both hands to his mouth. The breath stops for a long moment.
<< And his colleague. I also participate in the cases, not just report what he tells me >> John retorts, clenching his fists.
<< She will find a person more present than me and capable of loving her >> he answers, thinking of how absurd that thought, that conversation, all this situation is.
<< Yes, it is beautiful >> John retorts, tearing Sherlock's shirt off without any restraint, which makes his flatmate laugh with taste, while the buttons clink falling on the floor.
<< I didn't even know we had any at home >> Sherlock replies. << You don't feel well >> he notes and John doesn't like his eyes on him at all.
<< Good night >> he says and so they say goodbye. Without a comfortable kiss, without a 'see you'. Yet another fruitless attempt to combine something with a woman.
<< John ... >> Sherlock says, meeting the sad look of his doctor. << Mycroft told me that I will have to undergo an operation on my leg to avoid being lame. It will not be beautiful at all and I will have to do a long rehabilitation. I do not want at all that Mycroft is by my side. He would only emphasize how little goodwill I would take. You are a doctor and then ... well, even if it was psychosomatic, you were lame. I think I will need your help, if you like >>.
Something happens to the entire human machine when we helplessly witness the suffering of a person it loves. Any kind of suffering. From the simplest flu to the most complex of surgical operations. It tries to do the impossible just to see the other return to shine with health and well-being. At the same time, it experience the powerlessness of being unable to do anything but stay there, by the other side, waiting for it to pass. It hopefully that will pass quickly.
<< Do you really want me to tell you, John? >> Sherlock asks him in a heavy tone, articulating the words well. In the depth of Sherlock's clear eyes, the doctor realizes that he doesn't want to. No. It better that remain in the past what belongs to the past. << Your new and very recent conquest awaits your response. Don't keep her waiting >> Sherlock adds, even sketching a smile, while the boy intones Ashes Remain's 'End of me'.
<< Shut up! >> John thunders. His voice echoes against the walls. << You screams orders since you arrived and doesn't even know what you talking about. No, now listen to me >> says John, interrupting the chief. << This child is not our son >> he says, pointing the finger at William, who, intimidated, hides behind Sherlock. << He is the son of Albert Ford. Yes,  the man that could ruin your private economy with his death. Our dog found  this child hidden inside his bedroom closet. Mr. Holmes, the consulting detective, is successfully pursuing the investigation. To your knowledge >>, John adds, approaching the chief, threatening. << I am Captain John Watson, ex fifth Northumberland riflemen, three years in Afghanistan, veteran of Kandahar, Helmand and of the damned Saint Bart hospital and now official blogger of the consultant detective Sherlock Holmes. It will be a real pleasure for me to write in my next article how Scotland Yard's chief commissioner gives priority to investigations not to save the victims of a kidnapping but to safeguard his wallet! >>.
They remain silent for a long moment, each lost in his own thoughts related to that little great absence.
<< Oh, don't even imagine how many >> Sherlock chuckles, while his hands go further and further down John’s back.
John  tighten Sherlock's hand. He would like to ask him about his childhood. If it was similar to William's. If he felt alone. If, like the child, he had at least a nanny and a cook to take care of him. John only knows about Barbarossa, the dog with whom Sherlock played pirates for five years. Just like William and Morgan are going to play pirates right now.
Anthea enters the office, announcing herself with two shots on the door. She hands a packet of papers to his boss. Then remains still half a meter from the desk, her hands folded behind her back, in a resting position.
<< Wait! >> says Greg, grabbing him by the arm. << How can you be sure that he was attacked by a man? >>.
<< Humiliation hurts more than beatings, John >> Sherlock replies gravely. << Mr Ford is not stupid. He knows that leaving marks on the body of a child can make a problem also for an untouchable like him >>.
<< No, stop it, listen to me >> Sherlock says, placing his hands on John's chest to support himself better. << I risked dying. I got damned close this time and I only realized it by reading Mary's letter. It was very cold in that pit. God, I don't think I've ever suffered from the cold as much as that night. I still feel cold, despite now being warm. I don't know if it's normal. I know, however, that when you squeezed me this morning the cold went away. Even now, the cold is going away >> whispers and John feels his skin crawl. He tries to contain the effect of Sherlock's words, his closeness. John is afraid of making a bad impression, leading Sherlock to move away from him. << I thought that you have always warmed me with your presence, with your words, with the laughter that we always had at the least appropriate moments and places >> they both chuckle without needing to bring examples. << And above all, I thought about how much heat I felt that night. I thought about it while I was shaking in the cold. I thought how much I would have liked to go back there, in your arms. It doesn't matter what happened the next day. It was the last thing I thought of before slipping into my Mind Palace. A warm and beautiful memory >> Sherlock smiles, caressing John's amazed cheek. << I cried for Mary today. For the loneliness that woman must have suffered. I know what it's like to be alone. I've been alone for a long time. Since you are here with me this loneliness is gone. It would be foolish to continue ignoring what I feel for you, to let pride and honor take away the warmth I need. I have a desperate desire for you, John >> Sherlock says, putting his lips against John's amazed ones.
For four days he hasn't moved and John knows that he won't move even when Mycroft returns. Yes, it could be possible that Sherlock waiting that John isn't in the room to wakes up.
>> says Sherlock with a different tone of voice. << Canadian-born violinist came to London for an audition >>.
<< No. You are yourself. You have never done anything that could have led others to think that we are together >>.
<< No, Jason. I haven't seen this man. You know how small the country is and how much people murmur here. A foreigner ... this foreigner would have caught the eye and I would have known, in one way or another >>.
<< Because she risks suffering yet another injustice >> he replies seriously. << Mary ended the life of five killers. They should give her a medal >>.
Sherlock performs the last bend and in the way of getting up he loses his balance. John grabs him, but tumbles on one of the wooden sticks they use for some exercises. He falls back on the floor with Sherlock on him.
<< We must hurry! >> exclaims the woman with a worrying urgency in her voice. Mary take Sherlock in her arms. Sherlock's stomach making a turn and he must play attention to not vomiting on her. Mary seems to suffer no effort in carrying him down the corridor. She puts him on a cold and smooth surface and only when she activates the shower does Sherlock realize that he is in a bathtub. The water takes a while to warm up and when it finally becomes hot it is so pleasant that he can relax. Sherlock gives himself up completely to the water and, with a trembling hand, he grabs a wrinkled soap without any perfume and uses it to wash himself. The broken leg hangs out of the tub and continues to pulsate waves painful and angry. Sherlock try to isolate this pain in a room of his Mind Palace and thanks to this hot shower he manages a little.
John's stomach boils with anger. So much anger and so much annoyance at the idea of being there, unwanted intruder in front of a silent flirtation.
<< From your point of view yes, Sherlock. I think that would also be good for you to relax. It's not as bad as it seems >>
<< I want to beat another track on the web to try to get around the system and enter that damned blog >> he says, rolling his eyes. John chuckles and stands up.
<< Jesus, he decided to help her despite what she did him. Nobody would have done the same thing >> exclaims Greg, incredulous as anyone who came to know what Sherlock was doing for his jailer.
<< I have not really used these words >> Sherlock admits and John, at his side, brings his hand to cover the embarrassed eyes.
<< The same thing he did to Byron and who knows how many others. He took advantage of the malaise caused by the excessive heat of that sauna to lead me here and ... well, I'll let you deduce the rest >>.
<< Yes >> John nods. << She are not the serial killer. I don't know, however, how much the murder of the brothers and the mother will be able to change her punishment >>.
<< Leave her, Morgan! >> shouts Sherlock's deep voice and the puppy obeys. << Give me a good reason not to kill you here, now >> he whispers to the woman, bending her right arm behind her back.
The excavator, stopped for several days, looks like an old snow-white dinosaur, which is looking forward to being able to move to shake snow off. Before it was put into forced rest the excavator had dug a hole of considerable size and depth. An excellent job that had brought to light something exceptional. To see it, however, it seems that he doesn't give a damn. The excavator is only interested in being able to shake away the snow from the rusty joints and go back to attacking the freezing earth.
<< I was called to deal with Rosaline Jackson's suicide case and the investigation led me to Felix and I found out what this really is >> Sherlock replies that tells the girl the background mentioned by her brother. Lizzy looks at him with the same astonished expression of her father and at regular intervals she shakes her head in disbelief at the things she is hearing.
<< I saw something that is strange >> William says, stopping outside the kitchen. He doesn't know if proceed among the scientific department's men.
<< Because we don't have his eyes, John >> says Greg, pointing Sherlock. << In these last two cases the drawing was clearly visible. One even engraved on the skin. In the others, however, it did not immediately catch the eye >>.
<< Yes, I realize it, but this is not a good reason not to say things as they are. You saved the life of a friend's daughter. You made a beautiful gesture and you are doing everything to minimize it, to not get emotionally involved. You can't become a cold machine just to stop Moriarty from acting his intent, Sherlock. Don't you realize that, by doing this, you still play his game? >>.
Yes, because does not take much to say that the consultant would have tried to seduce the doctor, not the other way around. Sherlock is the 'crazy' one, the freak; not John, the brave soldier. John, who would have guaranteed himself the dose of adrenaline and danger and the occasional fuck without even having to go looking for it around. And Sherlock, poor fool, would have begged his attentions, hoped for his avances and would have deluded himself that that could be love.
<< Mycroft, I believe that the situation is so delicate as to be lucky to have good professionals ready to collaborate with us >> says Sherlock, who is certainly not lavish with compliments towards others who are not himself.
The woman freezes again and Sherlock fears the worst this time. She wakes up much quickley than usual and jumps to her feet, making the bed jump. Mary approaches the desk and from a drawer pulls out a round mirror set in a finely worked silver handle. She sit down again over the bed, smiling.
Sherlock sees a body lying on the pavement at a fair distance between the car and the gate. Lying on his stomach. The head pours into a pool of blood that still expands.
John is visibly against it, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.Greg arrives with his entourage, just as the stream of people leaves the pool. The magic session must not had so relaxing after all, given the less civilized way in which many of the men react to not being able to access the locker room.
<< I love you, Sherlock >> whispers the child, sinking his forehead in the hollow of Sherlock's neck.
<< I have adjusted them by adapting them to your size. If you had had a jacket and elegant trousers in your clothes, I would have spared myself the trouble. Fortunately, you have at least one decent white shirt >> Sherlock says. << The good thing is that you will have to wear it only to stage our arrival >>.
<< Sorry if I make you partakers of this thing that has nothing more to do with your investigations >> says the woman, wiping a fallen tear to her face.
<< Sense of guilt. Sense of duty. Another adrenaline-charged mission. This is John doing. It is not me who he seeks. Himself, perhaps, but now I don't care anymore >>.
<< There is, in fact >> reiterates Sherlock. << Mary didn't kill all those people. She executed only the brothers and the mother >>.
<< I can't stand small spaces >> Mary whispers, gently shaking his hand. << Dad closed me in the storage room every time I did something wrong. He pulled me by the arm and closed me there and if I cried, frightened by the darkness and the spiders, he would beat the door, saying that he would have killed me if I hadn't stopped immediately >>.
John brings his hands to cover his face. He lets them drop to his mouth and shakes his head hard. Sherlock accidentally notices that crying and wiping his tears.
<< And from that moment on they started bullying you >> says Sherlock to Lizzy, again surprised by his intuitions. Greg makes the consultant's astonished gaze travel to his daughter, while George shakes his disconsolate head.
<< Did you like it, Billy? >> she asks sweetly. << Come on, get out of there. I don't want to do anything to you, you know? I just want to take you to your parents. Don't you want to see your mom and dad again? They miss you a lot >> she try to convince William, in a persuasive voice, but the child is not fooled. He understands that Sharon will open the doors and find him and Morgan. William turns his frightened gaze on the puppy. Morgan licks the child's nose and then turns towards the doors.
Sherlock sighs, intimately unconvinced of the doctor's words. He feels day after day the terrible certainty that he will never come out of that room alive.
The effect is not immediate and perhaps even worse. Sherlock seems to deflate little by little. He mumbles more and more as he loses his strength, remaining hung in the arms of the nurses. John brings his hand to his mouth, shocked by that scene. He cannot believe that that is the same man who left Baker Street. John turns, feeling the need to escape for a moment from what is happening. His eyes rest on the other Holmes. Pale, his forehead pearled with sweat, which he wipes with a handkerchief. John can see how much  misses to Mycroft not having the secure support of his umbrella. In fact, he seems to be about to collapse.
"We are flatmates, this makes him untouchable" he says, trying to keep himself calm. "And then, fuck, did you see the guy who went to bed with him? When could I ever compete with one like this? A few years ago, maybe ... and if I were half a meter taller, too. "
The 'dance' that usually takes them to bed has always been accompanied by Morgan's curious and embarrassing little eyes, in their first three months of love.
<< Why do you want to help that woman, Sherlock? >> Mycroft asks him, who is really struggling to understand it.
<< I want you. God, as I want you >> he says, letting his hands slip in Sherlock's pants to grab his firm buttocks.
<< Stop, the two of you! >> Greg shouts, getting up in turn. << If you shout we won't get anywhere >> he says to Lizzy, trying to keep calm. The girl returns to her seat, however, glaring at her brother, who supports her attack, undaunted.
Sherlock didn’t awaken that evening again, so John and Rosie prepared to go to sleep. But when they were finished in the bathroom, Rosie- already in her pyjamas- aimed for Sherlock’s bed.
“Move back here.” His gaze was so intense John felt the urge to cry but his eyes filled with glitter of hope and happiness rather than tears.
‘Hey.’ John said with the most loving smile, sat next to the bed, bent down to Sherlock and kissed him. But he wasn’t aiming for just a peck on the lips as he did the last two weeks. No. He wanted to kiss Sherlock properly again. To know that it is still him. His husband. Sherlock knew it, and he opened his lips instantly to John's and then dragged the kiss out for what felt like an hour. The most beautiful hour ever.
His husband looked back at him and answered sincerely. ‘As good as I can be.’ He smiled crookedly but then furrowed his brow. He sighed.
After a brief conversation with the doctor they found themselves in the corridor just a few steps away from Sherlock’s room. John stopped. He motioned Rosie to sit on a chair and seated himself next to her.
Sherlock woke up again before his parents arrived but even John could observe that it irritated him, this dependence on him and he feared what the visit of his parents would do. He thought that he and Rosie had better leave them alone, because too many people in the room might cause even more distress for Sherlock.
He gave Mycroft a few minutes and then came back. Mycroft sat in one of the chairs and had his eyes fixed on Sherlock.
“I’m so sorry Sherlock. I’m sorry for everything that I’ve caused you. It will never happen again. I will never hurt you again. Promise.” A moment of silence followed.
‘John?’ Sherlock didn’t understand what John wanted to say and he had the most delicious confused expression on his face. And suddenly, John had to kiss him. His existence depended on it. And so, he did.
‘I love you.’ John answered and let the words sink in. It felt so elevating to say it out loud. Sherlock just stared at him and his eyes looked like they were watering. John hid his own face into Sherlock’s neck and hugged him tightly. After a while, Sherlock found his bearings and said the words he had thought he would never have the chance to utter. ‘I love you, too.’
’Twelve days. It happened the Thursday night before last.’ As John finished the sentence, new tears were falling from Sherlock’s eyes.
He barely finished the first chapter when Sherlock started moving suddenly. John looked up from the book. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, but he was moving his hands and legs rather violently. And suddenly John realized that he was trying to get rid of the wires attached to his arms and finger.
At that moment, Sherlock knew that he was beaten. So, he just nodded and walked out to dress himself. He couldn’t help it. He was so scared for Rosie. If he wore so distinctive clothes to school, well, that would go awfully wrong. A lot more than it did anyway. Children can be cruel.
Meanwhile Rosie stopped crying, watching these two, maybe thinking how it would end and who would be the one to free her from this boring cot. In the end it was John. He lifted her which was rewarded with a big smile and loud “Da!” from her side. John smiled at her too and then looked at Sherlock again.
Lestrade arrived about ten minutes later when John sat at the exact spot with his head in his hands. ‘John.’ He said cautiously, sat next to him and gave John a cup of coffee. He knew he would not drink it, but at least it was something to do…to hold on to.
It was very early when Rosie woke up. She heard her dad breathing heavily in his sleep in the other bed. She was still lying on Sherlock’s bed, right next to him with her hand across his chest. As her brain was starting to work properly after sleep, she realised that Sherlock had his hand on her arm and that the hand was moving. She raised her head and looked at Sherlock.
“You know, Watson, if you’d wait a moment after you finish the tower and looked at it you might observe the flaws so that the next time you could build it better. There’s no point in destroying it the second you complete it.” Rosie was looking at Sherlock, mesmerized by the low velvet voice John would say, as she would fully understand him but as soon as he got quiet she continued in her action not minding his advice.
‘No need for that. It’s only natural and it’s good to let it go.’ He tried to console his daughter and put his arm around her shoulders. ‘Are you alright?’
, thought John. He really didn’t know how to behave either and he felt even more inappropriately with Rosie here, for some reason.
‘Sherlock? Love, can you hear me?’ But no response came, and he continued to trash. ‘Sherlock, please stop!’ John shouted and tried to stop and calm Sherlock. ‘Sherlock! Stop it!’ But it was no use. So, he called the nurse, who then shouted at some others to help her. They held Sherlock down while one of the nurses checked his vitals and the monitors for anything abnormal. After a while Sherlock calmed down. Caroline turned to John with a small smile and said he was alright.
Just when he was in the middle of squishing Sherlock’s arm, he heard quiet steps on the floor. He turned around and
After dinner they decided Sherlock could use a proper wash. They prepared a plastic chair in the shower for Sherlock to sit down, which he rejected until his legs gave out and it was only John’s readiness that saved them both from falling down. After that, Sherlock became resentful and remained uncooperative throughout the whole process. But John steeled his nerves and they managed without killing each other after all. And when John led Sherlock back in his bed, he kissed him with considerable force, pushing his lips against Sherlock. Just a reassurance of sorts. For him and for Sherlock.
‘Yeah.’ John sighed while still holding Sherlock. ‘That was stupid, I’ll give you that.’ He said and they both chuckled.
John shook his head and concentrated on Sherlock again. He sat on the chair right beside him and kissed his hand. ‘I love you, you hear me? And Rosie loves you, too. So much.’ He took shaky breath and kissed the tip of his nose. ‘Come back to us.’
After he calmed down a bit, he tried to assure John that he didn’t need the physical therapy. In the end they reached an agreement that Sherlock would let John help him and do some exercise with him. And if it proved fruitless, he would attend the physio. Another part of the deal was that they would start immediately, and it would be difficult to judge who was more exhausted at the end. Because Sherlock certainly didn’t help. He was like a bloody teenager.
In the morning, the doctor examined Sherlock. In the end, he was only left with a smaller head bandage, pain medication and additional supply of nutrients, but he should start eating and drinking on his own, too. Sherlock then tried to stand up and he did it, even though he didn’t do any step forward, as his muscles were stiff. But with a wheelchair and John’s help, he could use the toilet. After the examination, Sherlock was so exhausted he fell asleep.
John took a deep breath. It pained him a great deal to talk about this, for some reason. But it was better to say this before Rosie was there. ‘Yes. He moves his arms. Usually it is as a result of prolonged pressure. But one time…one time he reacted to words, too. That was when Rosie gave him the Bee.’ He said and pointed at the stuffed animal above Sherlock’s head.
John thought better than to say more and motioned Rosie to go towards the door. ‘Be right back.’ He told the room and closed the door. They didn’t even step away from the closed door when he crouched down to Rosie. He didn’t have to ask if she was alright. She wasn’t.
‘Okay, stop. Rosie, don’t listen to him. Go make friends and don’t judge anybody before you get to know them properly.’ John said seriously.
It was Mycroft Holmes himself. John would have laughed if it wasn’t for the circumstances. Because the look on Mycroft’s face... He looked so uncomfortable, pained and sad. And on top of it, he desperately tried to control his expression. But failed, of course, so it looked as if he ate three kilograms of lemons.
‘Dad!’ Rosie with tear-stained cheeks shouted, ran to John and hugged him tightly, while John kneeled to her and stroked her blond curls. Mrs Hudson came to them and joined in the hug.
‘John, I have a feeling I should thank you. If not for saving my brother in the first place and calling an ambulance, then for being here and…caring.’ He said with something which seemed as a loss for words. Could it be?
‘Nothing. I just…I will try to make myself and Rosie invisible, I guess.’ John said and then cursed himself for doing so right away. ‘I think they will bring you food soon. Are you hungry?’ Yeah, when John thought about it… it would not be a happy evening. Sherlock would need help with the dinner and if he stays like this…
‘Sherlock, stay with me okay? Don’t dear to leave me!’ John said while trying to stop the bleeding, which seemed the only thing he could do to help. ‘I love you, we all love you. Please don’t leave us… oh Christ where is the ambulance?!’ Just as he muttered this, he heard the siren.
So, John was left alone. He waited in the hall and thought about nothing. His mind was completely blank, and it stayed that way every time he wasn’t at Sherlock’s side. And when with him, he only managed to squeeze his hand lightly, kiss his hand or face and repeat how he loved him.
‘Well, yes. That’s true. But it’s definitely more hopeful.’ The doctor said. When John didn’t say anything, he continued. ‘Anyway, I will leave you for a while and then we will start with the CT scan.’ And he went away.
Sherlock looked up from the boiling water and turned to John, confused that John would thank him for making tea with so much weight in his voice. ‘For what?’
Rosie looked up at him as he lowered himself beside Sherlock. Then he picked up his left hand. The ring finger wasn’t attached to any wire or anything and it seemed alright for Sherlock to have it returned. So, he looked into Sherlock’s face and then slid the ring on his finger.
He called the nurse, who called the doctor and John told him what had happened. Doctor, of course said his ambiguous diagnose but sounded pleased, hopeful. At least to John’s ears.
They still helped Greg, of course, but they tried not to behave so recklessly. They had Rosie to think about. So, after a rather nasty case which ended with John in the hospital for a few days when Rosie was two, they agreed to step back a little and leave the chasing to the police forces. That particular case proved to be ground breaking even on bigger scale, however. It was after John got home from the hospital and Sherlock made tea for him when they stepped out of the slowly-killing-them ‘just friends’ state.
The atmosphere in the hospital room changed as they fell silent again. It was Rosie who broke it after a while. ‘He looks… like he is far away from us.’ She said and John thought that that is in fact a rather accurate description of how it felt.
a younger child, they would have them with them now. His clothes and bag… all new and expensive. He has a new iPhone in his hand because the parents are worried about him and want to stay in touch with him all the time and well, why not buy him the best when they’ve got the money for it. He’s got no candies for other children and he walks- ‘
In the evening, John sat on Sherlock’s bed and they enjoyed the company once again. They talked about casual things, about Greg and Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock’s parents and about food. Sherlock grew curiously fond of food, actually.
The weekend was gone in a blink of an eye. Rosie enjoyed a peaceful Saturday with her grandparents. They spent most of the afternoon feeding duck in Hyde Park.  Sherlock’s condition seemed to be improving. He didn’t respond to commands per say, but he still reacted stronger when Rosie played and when John kissed him, he was rewarded by a hand clutch, too. But as Monday came, John fell into a bad mood when Rosie went to school. All the changes for better happened throughout Friday or Saturday and then it stayed the same again and John began to fear that it would stay like this forever. The doctor sounded hopeful. Nevertheless… John read about cases like Sherlock, in which it seemed that the patient was waking up but then stayed in a vegetative state, so they were responding, sometimes even to straight commands like ‘open your eyes’ or ‘move your hand’ but never regained full consciousness.
When Caroline came to check on Sherlock, he remembered the ring and asked, if she didn’t know how it appeared in the room on the table and not on Sherlock’s finger.
They both turned to him suddenly and tried to smile. Mr. Holmes spoke first. ‘Of course, John. Come here.’
‘Hey, sweetheart. When Sherlock wakes up, it will probably not be for long again. And he might be confused and don’t talk too much. But that’s alright, do you understand?’
When his cup was empty, he knocked on the door and stepped in carefully. Both Violet and Siger Holmes were on the right side of Sherlock’s bed. Violet was caressing Sherlock’s shoulders and hand and her eyes were red from crying. Siger was holding her hand and his eyes were fixed on Sherlock’s face.
John was oddly relieved. He loved Sherlock’s parents and it was really unfair to keep this from them however well Mycroft might have meant. And maybe…maybe…he hoped that their presence would help Sherlock to come closer.
Sherlock then took a deep breath and started explaining. ‘When I was in a fight with the suspect I punched him in the face hard. He fell to the ground, but I knew he would be up again in a moment, that it is not over. But I looked down at my hand and there was a bit of his blood on my wedding ring.’
‘Shhh.‘ John tried to soothe her while he put her in his arms. He felt disappointed, too, but he knew that it was dangerous to get overexcited about these little things. ‘It’s okay, Rosie. This is a very good sign.’ At least he thought it was. ‘Papa just needs more time. This is completely normal. The improvements happen gradually.’ He held Rosie in his arms and rocked her until she stopped crying.
‘Yeah, she’s brave. She was here with me all day yesterday and left this morning for school. She should be here in a few minutes, actually.’ John said. He didn’t know if he should say something about Sherlock’s state. But he supposed Mycroft had told them already, however he’d known. Violet seemed to be thinking about the same thing.
Other than that, the day was rather unsuccessful. John didn’t rouse any new reaction from Sherlock, who now opened his eyes in reaction to pressure, but other than that, nothing new.
‘Caring?’ John asked incredulously. ‘I love him, Mycroft. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for him.’
John entered the room, barely acknowledging the nurse as he was transfixed by the image of Sherlock. His curls were gone, his head bandaged. He was attached to IV fluids and a couple of devices with catheters hanging from the bed like snakes on a tree. But the worst of it all was the endotracheal tube leading from his lungs into the ventilator which supplied Sherlock’s body and most importantly now, his brain with the so much needed oxygen.
‘John. How are you? How are you coping?’ Mrs. Holmes asked and John thought that he really didn’t know how to answer.
Both smiled at her. ‘Okay, that sounds fair,’ said John and with a big grin he continued and pointedly looked at Sherlock, ‘not a fuss like when you went to the primary school for the first time, right?’ Sherlock looked at him, confused a little bit, but then he realised.
They sat down in Mrs Hudson’s living room. They made the tea just to have something in front of them. Nobody took even a sip. John took a deep breath and steeled himself. He had to get together for Rosie. He had to explain the situation to her as much sensitively but at the same time truthfully as possible.
‘I don’t know if you can hear us or if we’re helping by saying these things to you… but still. Know that we miss you here and would very much wish for you to come to us. Because we love you…Yes I repeat myself I know…’ John laughed but it sounded more like a choked sob. He held Sherlock’s left hand to his face tightly.
The next day (was it Tuesday? John didn’t even know) started as the day before. Mrs. Hudson visited in the early morning and then went to school with Rosie. Initially, she tried to convince John to go with them at least for a little while so he would be outside, too. And initially, it seemed like a good idea. But then, when they were to leave, John just couldn’t. He couldn’t leave Sherlock alone now. What if he woke up to an empty hospital room? That was just unacceptable. Fortunately, Mrs. Hudson understood and didn’t pushed him.
Before they went to sleep, Rosie played the violin for them. She would go to school the next day, John had already decided, and after that go to Baker Street with Mrs. Hudson and come back to the hospital the day after that right from school again. When John told her, she didn’t protest. John knew it was too much for her and even though she would like to be with them, the hospital environment wasn’t exactly pleasant. And if Sherlock had another fit of anger…
Only now did John look around to see the room properly. Wow, he thought. ‘Hey, we can start with describing the room.’ John said and felt like an idiot, but it was his only idea.
<< John, they also told us that in storms like the one that is breaking down from them, it is normal that many areas remain isolated. Sometimes even for months! And the Lake District Ski Club is one of these >> insists Greg. << Sherlock had told them that it would drop before the weather alert, in order to escape the storm. You know him, he will have been caught by another clue and he will have wasted time, getting stuck up there >>.
<< Okay. But do not make our names. We will be undercover, so you do not be surprised if you sees us different than we are >> Sherlock smiles, turning to John, who looks at him in amazement. Sherlock will also agree to do the doormat with wealthy clients, but that doesn't mean he has no intention of taking revenge on John for it.
"I agree, Sherlock, but we'll take care of it when and if the opportunity arises, okay?" John intervenes. "She is a god-fearing woman. I really don't think she would risk anything more than the caress she gave you."
<< Thank you >> John replies, taking the cup from his hands. It is pleasantly warm at the right point. John brings it to his lips and takes a sip finding it really delicious.
<< Mary, could I take care of it? >> he whispers carefully, studying the woman's words and reaction.
<< Philipp, shut up! >> Lestrade incinerates him. Anderson, resentful for being scolded, leaves the door. << Sherlock, tell me what you know. I don't have all day and I'm dying of heat >>.
<< It is German. The sauna master pours water mixed with aromatic or balsamic essences on the stones of the stove, producing a lot of hot steam. Then increases the thermal stimulus with towel strokes aimed at people at regular intervals >>.
The door slams and heavy steps, fast and that do not promise anything good attack the steps. Sherlock puts the violin in the case, closes it and slides it to the ground.
"Sherlock, what's going on with you?" John asks, with more than a note of concern in his voice. The consultant does not answer him. Sherlock's had a lot of dreams these days. The side effects of taking morphine for too long a period have started to make themselves felt with this perennial drowsiness.
<< Behind a gesture of this type there can be a thousand reasons, Mr. Jackson. At the moment I have few elements to be able to give you an answer. I need to find out the meaning of that drawing and for this reason, I will have to take away your daughter's notebooks >>.
<< I don't care, Inspector. She may have gotten rid of him recently. The smell of ammonia is terribly strong and therefore recent. I'm not going to waste any more time >>.
<< Are you ... Greg's son? >> John asks in amazement. George nods, blushing and the similarities John has noticed and set aside, come back to show him how the young man is the rejuvenated and miniature copy of his detective friend. << Jesus. I knew he had children, but I didn't think they were so big >> he adds, shaking his head in disbelief and the boy runs his hand through his hair in the same gesture of nervousness as his father.
<< Between one thing and another, you skipped your exercises today >> John points out, taking advantage of a Sherlock's short break. The consultant looks like a boy caught with his hands in the parent's wallet. He finds boring the exercises that the physiotherapist has imposed on him and tries in every way to escape. More than boring, John thinks that they are painful and that Sherlock tries not to do them so as not to show how much his leg is giving him problems. He try to appear stronger and indestructible than actually is.
<< It will not be continued, let alone! >> he chuckles confidently, deciding to dismiss it as a matter of fact.
<< Being together >> concludes John, now determined to go all the way. << Is it for Moriarty? >> asks him and Sherlock nods.
Who knows, perhaps 'three-continents Watson' that single case highlighted as wrong and never to be repeated would have made it happen again, to always blame it.
<< If it is not a mass grave and the corpses are not dead on the same day it could be the landfill of a serial killer >> Sherlock says even more excited.
<< Consulting detective >> can't help specifying Sherlock. << It's not a questioning, it's just that... you're ... different >>.
<< I would rather say an exterminator, given the place where we are, Lestrade. The devil, as well as its opposite, are only a literary creation >>.
John enters the bathroom and urinates. There is a towels laying on the radiator. Could be used by Sherlock to dry the puppy after washing. An unusual move for the consultant, which leaves everything lying around.
Something diverts the consultant's attention. Sherlock brings his hand to his right ear and looks at Fox. The journalist, with tense expression, looks at him while heading purposefully toward him. John remains in his place and witnesses another wordless communication. He sees Sherlock turn pale and put his hand to his mouth. Fox must have given him a bad, indeed, very bad news.
<< I will need to analyze all the notebooks of the girl and her pc, if we want to find the meaning of the drawing >> Sherlock tells Lestrade as they leave the room to make room for the coroner.
<< Sherlock, I fear that the situation is rather delicate >> John whispers worriedly, going to meet him. << This woman is completely out of her mind >> John says, passing him a package of typed sheets. << Her story about the kidnapping. It is not a Crime or or thriller story. It is pure splatter and I hope hasn't yet realized her plan >>.
John unbuttons Sherlock's cuff and rolls up his midnight blue shirt up to his elbow. He puts a small quantity of ointment on Sherlock's wrist and start massaging it.
<< Is Mr. Holmes there? >> Lizzy whispers, brushing aside only half of the blanket of hair with her small hand with black lacquered nails. The many bracelets on his wrist jingle first going down to the elbow, then falling back to the wrist when she puts her hand back on her hip.
Those words are a punch in the stomach, strong enough to take Sherlock's breath away. A whore. Yes, that's how he felt, even if he never had the courage to say it even to himself. A silly girl in love used as the cheapest of whores. And it was this love that made his price low.
Sherlock realizes he is naked. Naked as a worm. Whoever put him on that bed stripped him, washed him, medicated him, and plastered his leg, before tucking him in the felted woolen blankets over raw cotton sheets.
<< I know, but what alternative do we have? Outside I would freeze to death and you can't taking me to Hataway. What else can we do? >>.
John watches Sherlock walk away wondering how he got there. How did he understand. John never mentioned it. Never mentioned it to anyone, to tell the truth. Yet Sherlock understood it. John is amazed, admired, but also frightened. Although six months have passed since he followed Sherlock in his investigations and saw him solve puzzles he still cannot say that he is used to it, by drawing up deductions from things that most people would never have seen.
<< Of course, it isn't. However, there is nothing we can do. Have you seen how it is snowing? I do not put anyone's safety at risk, even on board the best of snowmobiles >>.
<< That woman threw my brother into that pit as if it were garbage, Inspector! I demand justice for what my brother had to suffer at the hands of that woman! >> John heard him say in a peremptory tone a few steps from the closed door of the room. Maybe John would also have to fight for justice. The thing that interests him, however, at the moment, is to see Sherlock's eyes open again, his lips to move and his voice to begin to deduce all that his gaze encounters. He wants to make sure that his friend's mean of transport and his brilliant mind are working. Only then John will calm down.
<< Kelly is here! Is coming! >> sobs. William's knees tremble madly. The girl, armed with a rolling pin, reaches him. She sees the dog barking at the front door. Splash of saliva drops down every time that he  bark.
<< Of course, Chief Commissioner: the wife. The high-sounding name of Albert Ford has pushed all of us to focus on him, without even taking a look to someone else. At least until William took me there >> Sherlock adds, caressing the child's hair.
Seen from outside, Sherlock must admit it is creepy. He finds nothing of the pleasantness he felt. He sees only one naked body raging on another and this other inciting him to continue.
<< Mysterious and idiots >> he points out and Morgan barks, finding himself in agreement with Sherlock. << What did you find out? >>.
<< Did she show you that draw among her drawings? >> John asks, noting how Sherlock has remained too calm to hear the words of the spouses. The two look at each other again.
<< I have nothing else to tell you >> says Sherlock. << You will wait for the results of the analysis of the internal cameras’ videos. You shall have them from Scotland Yard >>.
<< What else should I do? >> Mycroft retorts, shrugging. << As I already told you, what happened between you and my brother is not my business. Any kind of involvement is none of my business. What fault would you have if not that of behaving like most men? Of course, I would have hoped it would not be so and, of course, especially Sherlock hoped it would.
Sherlock opens the first entitled "The man's best friend" and quickly reads some passages, giving an idea of the woman they are dealing with.
Cause the shouting of the men outside the locker room, the sauna master enters the retractable door and finds himself pointed at the eyes of those present.
The man's heartfelt words are like a contracted stomach balm, which relaxes a little wrapped in an intoxicating heat.
<< Do you think it's the continuation of the crazy game in which Moriarty involved Sherlock last month? >>.
<< If it's a problem that people think we're together? No, John, it's not. I don't give a damn what people think. I thought you understood it >>.
"Calm down, Sherlock!" John says. "You have to stay calm. It is possible that it will take days before someone notice your absence, because of this damned storm. You must resist! She is crazy. Totally crazy, but she calm down if you obey her. If this entails a few  meals, I would say that it can be done, don't you believe it?. "
<< Details that your father can handle >> John intrudes, to whom the sudden way in which Greg's face has lost all color has not escaped. John's stomach sends back a strong stab and must suppress a groan. Sherlock gives him a worried look.
<< You said that you would keep the secret! >> Lizzy yells, pointing at her brother, who leaps towards like a spring.
<< Yes >> retorts John. Mycroft sighs producing a long hiss. As if he was trying to stay calm, although he doesn't seem like he is going to lose it.
<< It is the minimum to be capable to eat, isn't it? >> she blurts out, still bending over him. She has bad breath, an indication of bad digestion and poor oral hygiene. The smell hits Sherlock's face and he must make an effort to push back the vomit. The woman places the tray abruptly under Sherlock's nose.
<< No, its exact opposite >> Sherlock points out. << For this we need that Lizzy collaborate with us. So that we can use her access, assuming that they haven't already thrown her out completely, and enter the system to find out by whom it is managed and  eradicate it. At least until someone will tries to emulate it. However, I managed to understand how it is structured in broad lines. I looked for suicide reports in which the victim left a drawing as a ticket and I found this data >> he says, by opening a file on the desktop.
With the help of Hataway, John contacted three of the four families who lives in the homes around the zone in which they found Sherlock's car, although he had already spoken to all of them, even if at different times. The three repeated that they had not seen anyone, much less rescued anyone. From the research conducted by the teams of volunteers put together by the men of Hataway, howhever nothing had come out.
<< I want to participate in the investigation >> John says, resolutely. Sherlock looks at him wrong.
<< No. I am a consulting detective, the only one who exists in the world and my name is Sherlock Holmes >>.
<< I soap you and you shave >>  happily says the little girl Mary, pulling out of her pocket a jar of shaving cream and an old brush. She start preparing the cream carefully, mixing it with the brush. The beautiful cheerful smile lights up her face.
"What the fuck is wrong with me?" he asks himself, while, without saying a word, as he usually does since John knows him, Sherlock leaves the apartment quickly descending the stairs. The closing door hits John like a slap in the face.
<< Really? Mr. Holmes, I knew I made the right choice by calling you. Can I reassure the founding members that it was an accident? >>.
<< Turn off the sauna! Excessive heat alters body conditions, don't your men know? >> says Sherlock, looking with contempt at Anderson leaning against the jamb of the sauna.
<< In front there is the nose and behind the tail, how can you not understand it? It's so obvious >>.
<< When I met Peter I was in the library. I looked down from the fourth floor balcony. I've always liked that place and nobody was there. I thought jumping over there wouldn't be bad. Like jump from a high diving board into the pool, I did it a thousand times. It wouldn't have ended the same way, but they are… details >> she minimizes, by sketching a smile.
<< Yes, Billy, I have bad news. I watched the video and, to be sure, I confronted Juan and we came to the same conclusion: that man is in shock >>.
<< Grandpa tried to teach me, but my fingers are too big >> she says embarrassed, hiding her hands behind her back. << He was always laughing saying that it seemed that I using a saw rather than a bow. He had learned on his own. He could only play a few songs, but it sounded really good and I sang it. I think you know a lot >>.
Sherlock agrees. John invites him to sit on the sofa and sits down beside him. He takes Sherlock’s left wrist and begins to count.Sherlock watches John. The warmth of his hand around his wrist is pleasant. He must try to prevent himself from approaching his forehead and placing it against John’s temple, in the frantic search for reassuring physical contact.
A pendulum clock ticks noisily. Mark six, but, given the soft light of the room, it is not easy to understand if is the morning or in the evening.
The Ford's house is large and too perfect. Morgan precedes John and Sherlock, running free. He smell the bushes of red roses in the garden, chasing insects among the decorative rocks and staring at anyone who smiles or acts like an idiot towards him.
In these two days Sherlock has learned that he must start with the most watery dish. He dips his fork, muttering a tired 'Thank you' and pulls up the usual chicken. Sherlock soon discovered that Mary's cooking is not very varied. She forced him to eat the same dishes for lunch and dinner, the same quantities and all at the same temperature. He now manages to keep his hands steady around the fork, a sign that somehow the torture of meals is bearing fruit. However, Sherlock has to swallow everything very quickly, because her benefactress does not tolerate that time is wasted.
<< I know. I know that you will take care of me, my captain >> Sherlock says, running his erection with his finger.
Sherlock follow the footprints to the entrance of the building. The door is open, wide open. The precious carpet of the large living room has been dirtied by footprints of excited run. It will remain stained forever.
<< You prevented me from doing it >> Sherlock retorts, intent on reading a message just arrived on his phone. A smile curves his lips, and then immediately disappears.
<< I saw your flatmate >> she says, pronouncing that last word with disgust. << He looks for you, together with the inspector. He wants to bring his lover home and I don't want a perverted pig under my roof! The devil in the house, that's what I brought, damn me! >> she shouts, throwing herself over Sherlock, her fists closed like two hammers that she drops fiercely on his poor limbs.
The doctor and the consultant reach the kitchen and find Morgan sunk with his whole head in a huge bowl and William kneeling beside him with a handful of biscuits. At his side a woman in her fifties, with abundant breasts and soft shapes, offers to William a glass full of milk. Red eyes indicate a recent cry.
<< Molly confirms that the victim death from cardiac arrest >> Sherlock informs him. << There are no signs of sexual violence, but traces of semen have been found on the victim's body and on the bathrobe he was wearing. Obviously not belonging to the victim. The cameras do not show that Byron entered the locker room. It is possible to  see him come out and no one else enters or leaves there before or after him >>.
<< More than luxurious, I find it tacky >> retorts John, glancing at the bathroom with shiny blue walls and almost entirely occupied by a huge Jacuzzi. Then, remain motionless in front of the bedroom door.Sherlock takes a seat on the sofa in the sitting room and studies the flyer of the services offered by the Spa.
<< Do you think having the British government here can make any difference? Is it capable of melting the snow on command? >>.
Sherlock stops at the sound of that angry voice. He is trembling from head to toe, frightened, as if that man is chasing him.
<< Sorry, Annette >> this was, in the end, the correct name of the woman. << This morning I had to deal with a really unpleasant situation >> he says and his mind proposes him two images: on one side the lifeless girl; on the other Sherlock who relieves him of the case while exchanging smiles and glances with an unknown vagabond. John doesn't know which one disturbs him most.
<< You know me >> chuckles John, relieved at the idea of not having to venture alone among those ruthless and icy mountains.
<< I just thought it would be better if he did not find out that you also lied about Molly >> John says, bringing to Sherlock's mind that detail that has so easily forgotten. << She is really happy to have saved you and imagines you now with Molly at your side, ready to get married. This happy ending was created by Mary and it would be bad to ruin it >>.
<< For six months I have been helping you in your cases and in this period of time I have seen you not sleeping and not eating until you came to terms with it. Yesterday, however, I'm going home and you was here in ... company >> he says, giving him an eloquent glance.
<< That woman would have killed you too, if John had not been with the breath on that absurd inspector's neck first and then determined to reach the pit after that woman said she threw you inside >>.
Sherlock backs away frightened. The man's arm rises again and the sharp blade points him, eager to sink into his flesh.
<< It is admirable that you do not want to give your father further concerns >> John starts groping.
<< No, you have none >> Sherlock confirm, seeing John's head bend over even more. << I ... I felt used >>.
<< Two men who exceed in drinking, usually can get to the hands ... but this does not seem your case to me >>.
<< Do you know your mother's novel? >> Sharon says loudly, slowly crossing the kitchen. << You love crime book and surely you will have asked her to read her novel, even if it is not a reading suitable for a child >>.
"The slap of the airbag" he thinks, happy not to have broken the bones of his face as well as those of his leg and, he fears, also some ribs. Sherlock must admit that he has less hollow cheeks, though. Regular nutrition with chicken and vegetable broth is taking effect.
William runs away and the dog is immediately behind him. The girl snorts . << You will only make me waste time, Billy >> sighs and, climbed over the passed out nanny, enters the house.
<< The moment we discovered him, he deactivated all his accounts and we lost his contact. It would have been difficult to trace the real host from the fictional Caribbean one, but at least we would have had a chance. Now not even this >> Fox snorts. << As I said, we will continue the research of other cells around the world, in order to eradicate them. The portal no longer exists and many people linked to it have been arrested. We just have to hope that no emuls are born and that the young in crisis can really be helped by those who are able to do it.
<< Edward, what's going on? >> asks the child Mary and, feeling himself the greatest of idiots, Sherlock melts into tears. She approaches and, with this new delicacy that she has shown him since the day of shaving, Mary places her hand in Sherlock's hair in an attempt to cheer him up. Sherlock promptly grabs it and sinks it into his face, feeling the scent of pine, iron and sawdust.
Mary hands that delicate battered object to him and Sherlock takes it with the same delicacy. He places the custody on his belly and snaps the hooks. A puff of dust rises as he slowly opens the lid, discovering a violin as beautiful and precious as his own.
John sits up slowly and rubs his face. He turns up the nose at the strong smell of its own sweat. The reason that led him to go to bed without take a shower has the same effect as a bucket of cold water in the face. He gets up and goes down the stairs. Puts his ear on the door, listening. No noise. No yelp. He opens the door cautiously and peeps out.
<< I don't know what you're thinking. I intend to close this story tonight and to set a trap for my attacker >>.
<< Oh, fuck >> shakes the head Greg. << But for you it was just an adventure. The next day you told him and he got pissed. I can imagine the scene that made you >>.
<< Shut up! Shut up! >> Sherlock continues to shout, clutching his hands around Moriarty's throat more and more.
<< With the nanny. I left Morgan with him >> he adds and the two men exchange a worried look . << There is no time to waste! >> Sherlock shouts and with John rushes out of the apartment. Greg communicates to his men in Milton Keynes the place where the Fords can be held prisoner.
The consultant closes his eyes with his hands clasped to his chin, while the guitarist intones an excerpt of The Buggles' 'Video killed the radio star'. He listens to it absorbed in contemplation and it is absurd, since, outside of classical music, everything else for Sherlock is only garbage unknown to his Mind Palace.
<< It won't be a serious loss. No more blogs or porn films to cheer you up the evening >> Sherlock mocks him, trying to get up back.
John agrees and places more kisses in Sherlock's hair. He stops for fear of being inappropriate. He doesn't wants to give him the idea of taking advantage of the situation.
<< Are you sure? Couldn't she be scared enough to hide her corps somewhere? As you said, she is a six-year-old child and children at that age are afraid of being reprimanded. I seem to have understood that that woman had a very severe father >>.
<< Oh, forget it, I'm digressing >> laughs John, caressing Sherlock's nose with his own again. << Is that okay for you? >>.
<< Since Silver's death, the bickering between Mr and Ms Ford increased >> says Kelly. << Billy has lost a lot of weight. He didn't want to eat and every morning I found the bed wet. Billy his very embarazed for this and asks me to promise him that I don't tell nothing to his parents. He would like to say it to Ms Ford, but He his afraid that  this thing could escape to her during one of their quarrels >>.
He tries several times to start a conversation, but every attempt dies on his lips. The pain of Sherlock is so contained but at the same time desperate. He is holding the letter Mary wrote to him, dedicating her last thoughts to him. A writing as a small child, full of grammatical errors to make the skin crawl and a sincere love to tighten the heart.
<< Nothing different, except the fact that she no longer showed us her drawings, as Mr Holmes said >> she says, just looking up to meet the Sherlock's investigator gaze.
The detective places his hand on his shoulder and the doctor slowly turns to him. John is trying to maintain a dignified demeanor, despite the storm inside of him, that is worthy of what has recently left them. A demeanor that John carries on from the moment Hugh Paddington confirmed his suspicions. Sherlock had really gone away from the club and ended up off track. That image, that he had kept dormant and immediately pushed back into the depths of his unconscious when he timidly went up to his mind's eyes, came true. It took two days to get Hataway to start the search. Two more to find the exact spot from which Sherlock flew down. Another to find the right front wheel from the white and soft snow's blanket. Until today, the day when a team of local volunteers has decided to descend to see who the soul that the mountain has claimed >>
<< Oh, I think knowing that you told someone that you are engaged and about to get married with her would make her really happy, yes >>.
<< Oh >> she exclaims in amazement. Mary squeezes her hands against each other and the leather gloves she wears rub against each other, creating an unpleasant crunch. John notices how tight they are for her.
<< Your brother told me that he is worried about you, William >> Sherlock hears him say and would like to run away from what is about to happen. << Claims you have been using drugs for some time. Cocaine, specifically. He is afraid you have become addicted to it >>.
John felt the ground collapse under his feet after those words. Sherlock deprived of the opportunity to move to carry on his work does not even want to imagine it. Sherlock life would be characterized by long days of boredom, depression, black mood. He may return to cocaine use and the propensity to suicide that would result.
Sherlock opens his eyes and it doesn't take long for him to realize that they are in Baker street, lying on top of each other on the living room floor.
He stares at the sofa again and the memory of what happened there just two days before his departure invades his mind.
<< A bad bastard, that's what it is >> sighs the detective, rubbing his face. << He has the reputation of being a bad temper. One of those who is better not to have as antagonistic, if you don't want to be destroied. I don't understand exactly what's his work, but he is a majority shareholder in a significant number of large giants of the British economy. We have checked everything that concerns him and we have not found anything >>.
<< Other hospital souvenirs >> he mumbles and his stomach starts to twist. He looks around in search of his coat, his clothes, the trolley he had with him in the rental car on which he traveled, but finds nothing. There is not even a closet in which all its stuff may have been putted.
John wakes up screaming. He falls from the chair on which he had dozed off, finding himself on the floor.
It's a stupid reaction, he knows it well. He would have liked that John doesn't discover what happened to him, but it was not possible . Unfortunately. Sherlock takes his wallet and looks for the business card of the hotel manager. He calls him and, despite the late hour, the little man answers at the second ring.
<< Sure. Pirate and governor of Jamaica. Our Morgan is just 221B Baker Street's Governor. Isn't he, John? >>.
Sherlock smiles, thinking about his skull. He didn't talk to him about his nightmares, but he shared case theories with him. The skull has always listened to him without ever replying, helping him considerably, he must admit, to find the key to the problems.
Sherlock's benefactress nods. With rapid movements, the woman goes to the bed, bending over him. Sherlock closes his eyes, convinced that she wants to hit him with those big hands. Instead, she uses them to operate a lever located on the side of the bed, to lift the top of the bed and allow him to sitting.
<< I don't know, John. I have to understand the meaning of the drawing that she is engraved on the skin before venturing hypotheses >>.
<< I'm not his father, Greg! >> John reply annoyed. << Sherlock is an adult and quite free to go where he likes best, if you hadn't noticed >>.
<< Captain, I'm afraid you went down heavy with her. If her explodes furiously, all the men present here will not be enough to keep her calm >> whispers Hataway, his worried gaze fixed on the woman.
<< Mark told me that he double-checked the test he did to me at the beginning and found out it was wrong. I don't have the necessary requirements to stay in the group >>.
<< Thanks anyway, Leslie. I hang one of these on the bulletin board, if you don't mind >> says the inspector, showing him one of the posters they have prepared in which the photo of Sherlock with the deerstalker on his head stands out above the word 'disappeared'.
<< To attract his attention, Cooper told him who was your father and the master must have spent a bad quarter of an hour, fearing to see the whole Scotland Yard swoop into the apartment. He must not have liked it and decided to punish the girls. The master will have used the tactics of cyberbullying and instigation to commit suicide, to punish the girls for endangering the organization >>.
<< Are you really sure, John? >> Mycroft challenges him, suddenly becoming serious. << Do you really think you know my brother to the point of being able to put limits on his grudge? >>.
<< It is unusual for me to leave Morgan with someone else, but...That child ... is so alone >> whispers. << He needs a friend. Nobody should be alone at that age >>
<< Was the cardiac arrest therefore caused by a dispute with another individual? >> hypothesizes Greg. Sherlock sighs.
"I don't see why you too must suffer the consequences," Sherlock thinks, before returning to stare at the door. "I knew it would happen," he sighs, running a hand through his hair. The regrowth is now more than visible and in the village Mary will surely have heard of the missing Londoner. Paddington and Hataway have not heard from him for days and, now that communications have been reconstituted, they will have been able to talk to each other and realize that he never came to the police station. Sherlock should have prevented Mary from going into town to shop, but what would he be for? Only to delay the inevitable.
<< When I saw him on you I lost my head >> John admits and feels his hand tighten slightly. He grasps and Sherlock slowly raises his eyes to meet him. << Nobody can hurt you and hope to get away with it >>.
<< What are you saying? She held you prisoner. She beat you, segregated in a storage room and thrown away like garbage and would you like to help her? >> asks Mycroft incredulously.
<< Human bones >> he mutters to himself and a spark of euphoria lights his eyes. << It has all the air of being a mass grave >> he adds and the idea of finding out who created it reddens his cheeks more than the frost of this morning, which promises a good snowfall .
Sherlock takes place at the top, as far away from John and his woman as possible. Check that the beard is not coming off due to the heat and sweat and finally knows the sauna master. The sauna master greet those present explaining what is going to do and what the rules are. Then, he pours water on the stove. A dense cloud of flavored steam invades the environment.
<< Yes, you understood correctly. Howard Byron has bruises that could indicate an assault as being the consequence of an occasional relationship consumed the night before in the locker room. The inspector Lestrade will inform you of how the facts went >>.
They climb the stairs and reach the little room where they find William immersed almost completely in the large camping backpack and Morgan looking at him curiously, his hairy head tilted to one side. As soon as Morgan sees Sherlock and John he runs towards them, placing his front paws on their legs and licking their hands. They both kneel before him.
<< He found him behind a bush in Bristol, while we were returning from this last investigation. Don't ask me how he felt him, because I'm asking it too. I saw him run away and, when I went to look for him, he had this little creature in his hands >>.
<< He is dead >> the inspectore interrupts him. << It's been five years now. He slipped on the frozen steps of his cellar and broke his neck bone. The eldest son, Jack, came to call me. A tragic misfortune. He was good. Bad character, heavy hand on their children, too, but he knew do  his work. He saved many lives and helped to gave birth to others. His home was transformed into a real hospital in seasons like this. We miss the presence of a doctor here. The closest, when Keswick is unreachable, is in Penrith, not just around the corner >>.
<< This room has been not only cleaned, but recently disinfected >> Mycroft tells him, wrinkling his nose at the intense smell of ammonia. << The mattress is more loose than that of the other rooms, a sign that it has hosted someone for a long time. The fireplace has just been turned off >>.
<< Silver was my dog. We were born on the same day, but he died on March 15th. After breakfast I went out to bring him the food and he, instead of running towards me happy, was lying on the ground. Dad said Silver died of old age. Kelly, my nanny, and I buried him in the garden, made a big cross and put all his toys around it. I miss him so much >> William  whispers and a tear rolls down his eyes. Morgan promptly licks it off and the boy smiles accepting the puppy's pampering.
<< Why should you compete with Fox? >> Sherlock asks him, placing the now empty cup on the arm of the armchair.
<< Are you already done? >> she asks in amazement, offering him the bowl full of the usual boiling chicken broth. She sits next to him and as always watches him eat slowly. When he is done, she gets up with the usual urgency, ready to load him on her arms and bring him back inside.
<< These signs on the carpet >> says Mycroft, pointing to the steps of the stairs. John does not listen further and follows what the consulting detective's brother indicated. He hardly hears the woman asking the inspector why the two Londoners are taking similar liberties in her home. Hataway leaving her to his men (he has carried almost all the command) for follow them upstairs.
Different points of view, of course, that made the difference between the family of benefactors and that of mad assassins. Ruthless killers who had no problem throwing a man still alive, even if exhausted, into a pit, letting the cold, hunger and hardships put an end to his existence.
<< Sherlock! >> he says and the consultant turns to him, slowing his pace until he stops. << You can't tell me such a thing and then leave as if nothing had happened! >> John exclaims panting.
Sherlock's eyes burn and his throat starts to itch. He coughs a few times, cursing himself for wearing contanct lenses. He removes them by rubbing his eyes, taking care not to be seen, and goes back to studying the sauna master. He is muscular and nervous, but also strangely flexible in the way of shaking the towel. The master is not very tall, nor too imposing, yet he has a stage presence that allows him to keep everyone present in hand.A warm wind, moved by the towel, expertly stirred by the master, spreads through the sauna.
<< Oh ... yes. Animals need food and I need something too >> she replies, blushing conspicuously. Mary steals glances at John, who is struggling to sketch a polite smile.
<< Is this what you will do then? >> Mycroft asks him. << Do you take the blame for what she did, saying you was wrong to lie to her? >>.
The man grabs a large knife. He steps a few steps towards the child's body and raises his arm over the child's head, ready to hit him.
<< Yes, it's true, but at the moment we think it's better for William have a good friend next to him >> says Sherlock.
<< You trust a lot of this irregular >> John says, with a touch of acidity that does not escape the consultant.
<< Hey, folks, a man from the government has arrived who says he's the brother of your missing friend >> says Hataway, breaking into the dining room of the small police station. Beyond the frosted glass, John glimpses the unmistakable silouette of Mycroft Holmes. John takes a deep breath and with Greg follows the inspector.
<< Why not? I will train him and he help us in the investigation. A spare nose is always useful, as yours doesn't work >>.
<< I can imagine why you worried >> John continue. << Your father has tried a lot in the last period, but he is always Gregory Lestrade, the cornerstone of Scotland Yard. He deserves to know how his children are and you deserve to be able to tell him what is beautiful and also what is less beautiful you find yourself living >>.
<< She will have to find a solution >> he repeats and once again panic pushes to take over. Edward has been threatened. A punishment awaits him, if he still dares to have the bad habit of masturbating to the point of bleeding.
<< Because you can't wear a beard too and you need something to cover your face. Put these too >> a pair of black colored contact lenses passes him.
<< Greg, I can't stay here while Sherlock might need my help >> he sighs, taking his head in his hands. << The last thing that we known about him is that communication received on Thursday by the police command, where he warned them that he would go to them. But, from what your colleague told us, they never heard from him again >>.
<< Molly told me that the victim had a cardiac anomaly. He would not even have to stay in a sauna. That bastard must have approached him as he did with you, taking advantage of his malaise. If instead of abusing Byron he really helped him, maybe we wouldn't have a body in the Bart's morgue >>.
<< She is right, they are beautiful >> Mary laughs, slowly moving aside a Sherlock's now arid forelock that has fallen to cover his healthy eye. << My mom never laughed. She always screamed and beat me a lot. Dad never hit me, mom, however, many times >> Mary says, embarrassed.
Sherlock thinks about it for a few moments. Yes, maybe part of him hopes to be saved. He is a human being after all. He feels, however, that he is wrapped in a heavy veil of indifference. He does not care. To live, to die. To be saved or not. He does not care.
<< Why on earth? >> John asks, frowning. Fox exchanges a glance with Sherlock and John does not need the Holmes acumen to understand who made the decision to make that omission.
<< Lizzy came very shaken by the only one she attended two weeks ago >> George intrudes, eager to say what he knows. << I was afraid they had done something bad >> he says visibly swallowing. << Lizzy continued, however, to say that it was not fair they had thrown her out of the group >>.
<< It is possible that he was already sick before. I found an anomaly of the mitral valve. That man should never have gone to a sauna with a heart in those conditions. Poor guy. He would have needed help and instead was the victim of abuse >>.
Mary smiles. Despite the brutality of what she just told him, she smiles. As if what her father was doing was stupid and foolish.
Sherlock leaves his Mind Palace and turns his gaze to the door at the exact moment it opens, introducing the detective into their private space.
<< Can you hear me, shit? >>. Martin mumbles a fatigued 'yes'. << Now we will call the police and hand you over to them and you, as a good child, will confess your crimes. Promise me, otherwise I will squize your penis so tightly to break it and make you impotent. I am a doctor, I know how to do it and I was you I would not challenge myself >>.
<< Sorry, I didn't want to disturb you, but I saw you read about the Aufguss and I can only praise it >> the woman says, leaning towards him. << I am Clarissa >>.
<< However, they must have a common characteristic  >> Sherlock says, jumping in turn into the hole. He  kneeling next to her.
<< I dreamed about my father >> Sherlock says, shaking her hand. << He ... was a monster >> stops, his throat tightened with emotion. << He killed my mother and her lover
<< Good morning, Mary, I'm John Watson. We met in front of Jo's shop a few days ago, I don't know if you remember me >>.
"Oh, please, not here in front of everyone!" James exclaims, looking around pretending embarrassment. He pulls him away badly and Sherlock falls down to sit. His leg, which is slowly waking up, sends him a stab of pain so strong that it makes him scream. "Oh come on, how much scene for a little pain."
<< Oh my! You ... you are Peter >> exclaims the girl, pointing to Fox with a voice so high as to startle everyone ... except the person concerned. Fox smiles at her and nods without taking his eyes off her stunned gaze.
<< I don't know, Edward. They were here and then they were gone. I think they went away. They were older and worked. When dad died, nobody came here to be visited. When mum died, me and my brothers were the only ones left and then ... and then I was the only one left >>.
John carry on that cuddle even when Mycroft returns to the room. He no longer cares about absurd concepts such as decorum, reputation, decency, adequate attitudes and so on.
<< I was ready to blow up with you in that pool to eliminate it. You should deduce the answer from you, my dear investigative consultant >> John answers, placing another kiss on those beautiful lips, which kidnap Sherlock for another intense moment of dizziness.
<< Let's take stock of the situation >> says Sherlock in a theatrical way, pacing the space in front of the pit, back and forth. He puts his joined hands under the chin. << Two weeks ago, our excavator friend discovered this mass grave which counts  40 bodies who died in different eras, as you rightly pointed out. The hole is 4 miles from the Lake District Sky club. The district club commissioned the works for the construction of a new ski track and a new club to accommodate vacationers. The city of Threlkeld is at 12 miles from here and the city of Penrith is at 32 miles. Before the beginning of the works, this area was devoid of homes and even shelters. There was only that small chapel >> Sherlock says, turning to indicate a stone construction now almost totally eroded by bad weather. << It is possible that our serial killer is also a devotee and comes to deposit his victims in the shadow of the Virgin to lighten his conscience for the evil he has done >> hypothesizes Sherlock, drumming his fingers together in rapid succession. << Do you have any hypothesis on the cause of death? >> Sherlock asks to Molly who has diligently listening to him. The girl jumps into the hole and kneels among the corpses to examining them. Sherlock watches her attentively.
<< Sherlock. His name is Sherlock Holmes >> he punctuates. Greg's hand rest on John's left shoulder and squeeze it. Greg's  hand causes to John a twinge of pain, sinking his fingers right into the old war wound, but manages to distract him from the desire to fill the woman with insults. The fact that she starts laughing again like a little girl, doesn't help his good friend's attempts at all.
Mary leaves the room closing the door behind her.  Sherlock puts his head over the pillow, realizing only now how tense and immobile he has remained. His stomach is in turmoil for the large amount of anxiety and food that has introduced. Sherlock feels it ready to exploding. Sherlock closes his eyes and forces himself to breathe slowly. He inflates and deflates the abdomen and diaphragm to quell the panic that feels under his skin and soothe the stomach.
<< Sure >> he says, keeping calm. << Then let's wait and hope for the best. Are you planning to let Greg know about this story? >>.
<< I'll kill you, little bastards! I'll tear you to pieces >> Sharon screams. Her face is a mask of blood and her body gradually becomes covered with bruises. She disarm William with a kick. The child falls to the ground, the baseball bat rolls away. With an additional effort, she gets rid of the dog, that flies towards the wall against which it collides, before falling to the ground emitting a faint yelp.
The boy finishes the piece and announces that he will perform a medley of covers by different authors. Start the first of these, The Cure's 'Boy don’t cry', and sketch a smile in the direction of the consultant, he reciprocates.
<< You too lied to me >> he replies seraphic. << You said you hadn't been able to retrieve my suitcase >> he says, still pointing at it in his hands.
"The ideal set for a horror movie!" John says and Sherlock nods agreeing fully. As soon as he realizes it, however, he snorts again.
Greg looks incredulously at the smug smiles of his children. He brings his hands to their faces that he always caresses with that fear of breaking or damaging them.
<< No, even if I would be tempted >>.Sherlock lets him go cautiously and John approaches Martin still lying on his side and grabs him by the collar of his shirt.
When Sherlock’s eyes focused on his, John smiled. ‘Hello, love.’ He said quietly and raised Sherlock’s hand to his mouth and kissed it.
The day after that was uneventful, too and suddenly, it was a week since… the night. John and Rosie had a routine every day. In the morning, they washed and ate breakfast, which mostly consisted of a tea and Mrs. Hudson’s biscuits. Then, Mrs. Hudson, Greg or Molly came and picked up Rosie for school. Then John washed and shaved Sherlock, the nurses and doctors came to do a check-up, they also moved Sherlock to avoid bed sores and John massaged his limbs. Until Rosie came from school, John then busied himself with talking to Sherlock, reading or watching some DVD and it was more of the same with Rosie, besides she did her homework, or someone paid them a visit and brought them a decent meal, too.
‘No need to thank me for that, John,’ Sherlock said. ‘It’s…’ Sherlock didn’t know how to express himself. Making John happy or satisfied at least was like breathing. Actually, no. Breathing was boring. This was the most important, essential but also natural thing for Sherlock to do.
‘Yeah, Sherlock. It’s alright. Let’s go to the bathroom.’ He said but Sherlock was now gripping his arms tightly and wouldn’t move.
As they stepped into the room, side by side, Rosie tightened her grip on John’s hand and when she saw Sherlock, she stopped as John did when he first saw him at the ICU. John gave her time and just stood there with her. After some time, Rosie lead them both to the side of Sherlock’s bed next to the window. They were approaching his bed slowly, but as they were only two steps from him, Rosie let go of her dad’s hand, quickly closed the distance between her and Sherlock and hugged him as tightly as the wires and all allowed. Tears were falling freely from her eyes now and she wasn’t letting go for a while.
The tests came out fine so Sherlock was free to leave. Just before he did, the doctor tried to explain what he should do and no to do just yet, but Sherlock didn’t pay much attention. After all, John was his doctor and he would keep him right.
They didn’t even know how long it was before the doctor came. It certainly felt like a lifetime. ‘Dr. Watson?’
‘No. They’re my favourite. And anyway, you gave them to me, you should be flattered.’ Rosie said a bit too loudly and surely too sophisticated for her age. John just smiled a bit. Yes, she could get quite bossy sometimes.
In the hospital, they sat him in the waiting room. Sherlock was taken to a surgery. And then, it really hit John. He was useless now. And he was scared to death. He began to cry. He desperately tried not to see the worst scenarios. And failed, of course. He thought about brain injury. About Sherlock’s brain, which was most probably without the supply of oxygen for…how long? How long did it take for the swelling to develop, blocking the passage? How long did Sherlock lie there before he found him? How long was he late?
‘I was angry. I took off the ring,’ Sherlock said with a tiny voice. ‘I put it in my pocket because I didn’t want it… the symbol of our commitment and our family to be stained, to be connected to the violence.’
<< 'The other' thought that you and Edward were together. She hit a lot him the first day >> she confesses sadly, confirming John's intuition. Johanna is none other than him. Sherlock had to change his name in a female name to be able to tell her how John used him. Why Sherlock let himself go to such confidences John does not understand it. Maybe Mary threatened him in some way, or ... or, more simply, in the absurdity of what Sherlock was experiencing, he felt the need to let off steam with someone. Of course Sherlock is not the type of person that tell his own business around, but John himself is realizing how sweet, welcoming and protective this version of Mary is. And he realizes, too, how she has become infatuated with the consulting detective, to the point of hating with all her might the woman who dared to harm him.
<< Hey, do you agree? >> asks and the puppy barks. The girl laughs amused and gives to the puppy a piece of bread.
<< Oh, Jesus, yes >> John sighs, letting his head dangle in his arms. << He ... was so peaceful. Quiet. Different from the usual, in short, and I ... I got scared, Greg. I was afraid of him >>.
<< I think this is not a problem >> nods the consultant. Morgan paws towards Sherlock and rests his head against his belly. Sherlock caresses him on the neck for a long time, where he knows he likes him. << Thanks for all that you have done for us, little one >> whispers him, placing his forehead against Morgan's ruffled head. The puppy lifts his head and licks Sherlock's face, accepting kisses and caresses from both of them willingly.
Sherlock opens his eyes and finds himself sitting on the bed. The wind creeps between the fixtures, producing that sound so similar to a cry.
<< You took another dog. I expected that. You and your parents consider other living being simple objects at your service. I have something for you, little one! >> Sharon says, throwing a piece of sausage that throws to the puppy's feet.
A strange silence falls between them. John holds Sherlock's hand, while massaging him wrist . It's crazy. All the times he has to touch his body it is to medicate him.
Sherlock and John join Greg, that talk to a girl in her thirties. She has blond hair pinned in a large cignon, and her face marked by tears. She still sobs silently. The detective introduce them to the woman.
"Stop that!" exclaims the captain's voice. This is enough for him to shake himself and start shaving.
Moriarty sighs, putting on one of his puppy-like expressions. He kneels in front of Sherlock and theatrically caresses his pained face.
<< You don't… don't you digest that I smoke during a case? >> asks him amazed. John nods, realizing how stupid the thing he just said is. Sherlock smiles and shakes his head.
The woman's mouth draws a funny 'O'. The hand that knots the braid stops completely, prey of amazement. Her face then squeezes like a sponge and explodes into tears.
<< Yes >> she answers immediately, her gaze fixed on the notebook. << Why did you get it? >> asks him.
<< Of course, but I am also an ex-soldier accustomed to the battlefield and action and Sherlock is not a simple detective, but a consulting detective >>.
<< I can also give you the benefit of the doubt, but this is what seems to be happening >> Greg looks at Fox annoyed. << John, I will allow you to participate in the investigation. I expect to find you in front of Mycroft. I have no desire to deal with that other phenomenon alone! >> Greg exclaims and descends the steps leaving the 221B.
<< Did your dad lock you in the storage room to punish you? >> Mary asks him, moving the chair closer to the bed.
<< Don't lie to me, bastard! >> she says, grabbing Sherlock's neck with her free hand. << You, pervert without god! How dare you perform such acts of disgusting lust in my house >>.
<< Do you really think so? >> Sherlock laughs in turn. << Right now, the police team sent to Milton Keynes is pulling Mr and Ms Fords to safety from the cellar in which you have hidden them. A damp, moldy cellar, like your at home. It was very simple to force the PC password and read your latest unpublished novel. I found it compelling and, by the way, thanks for the detailed description of your grandfather's cottage on Willen Lake >>.
<< No, Mary. You executed murderers. I am sorry only you have not been able to eliminate them all >>.
"What does that mean? You made yourself men of every color under your weapons. Do you become homophobic?"
<< As you may have guessed, Fox is one of the investigative journalists who make up the editorial team of 'El mundo'. We worked together on several cases years ago and we kept in touch via e-mail, updating each other on our lives >> Sherlock says, looking up at him before returning it to the cup. << He contacted me with a message when we left the Jackson's house to tell me he was in London. Using the music code, Fox told me he was on an undercover mission for the investigation into cyber bullying they are working on and that led them to run into this portal >>.
John holds his gaze and, staying on his knees one step away from him, helps him breathe.John can't believe this panic attack was caused by him. It could be the result of a pressure drop, but he is not sure. The bathrobe that Sherlock wears has opened and highlights the chest and left arm with which he supports himself. Attention is captured by the bruises. Not yet purplish but already well present.
<< I want to take care of Mary's funeral. I don't want that they put her in that sort of mass grave which is the asylum cemetery >> he whispers.
he says rationally, feeling on the belly skin the now dry presence of what the attacker has left on him. A new hitch goes up to his throat. He represses it.
<< So... killed by you or by a needle in my arm... what changes? Didn't you say that? Somehow you have to die >>.
"The mind has a big power over the body," continues John. “I know they are concepts very far from you, but try to concentrate and imagine that the wound closes. Imagine one platelet at a time coming together and the inflammation will disappear. I know you can do it, Sherlock” John encourages him. Sherlock realizes how valuable John's advice is. Despite the annoyance he feel towards him, Sherlock puts his joined hands under his chin and diligently follows the advice of his doctor.
<< Bad story >> she notes serious. << What do you have to do with it? >> asks him and John doesn't hold back from being annoyed this time.
Sherlock does not question the truthfulness of his brother's words. Nobody more than Mycroft would move seas and mountains to find him and make sure he is well. Certainly it is a huge ball-breaker that insinuates himself into his life, by pretending to be informed of everything and to control him. It is also true, however, that Mycroft is the only one who has a valid reason to save him. If only to prevent him from throwing  mud on the reputation of Holmes family, as their father used to shout. That's why Sherlock decides to listen to him this time.
It is not the first time that a homophobe beats him. He has suffered many beatings as a student and has always faced them with dignity.
Fox is a character I created. He is the protagonist of my novel. It appeared, together with his investigative journalists colleagues, in another of my fanfictions (Hasta la verdad, siempre!) That I will publish here in the future
Sherlock takes the lens from the case and this time it's John's turn to take his jacket. The consulting begins to scan all the walls and only when he reaches the one furthest from the front door does he stop victorious.
<< Undoubtedly the first thing that catches my eye is her size >> John begins, but Mycroft interrupts him immediately.
John hears Sherlock speak in Spanish and it amazes him. John knows spanish, but does not spend too much time listening to what Sherlock and the expert are saying. The speech left hanging still spins in his belly. The answer to your question... struggles to find it, put it into words, mentalize it. It's something important, though. Something that has already created a distance between them, John feels it. And maybe that's why he never addressed the topic.
"Bravo, Sherlock! Keep her in good mood and you will see that she won't hurt you any more”John says in Sherlock's head. Sherlock snorts in front of that umpteenth intrusion.
<< No, Dad, I don't calm down anymore! >> exclaims the girl out of her mind. << I can't stand what she did to you! I can't stand that I can't be with you, even if for a short time. I do not accept this decision and I do not take peace of the fact that even for a moment I thought she was right and that it was fine with you. I thought that you really didn't want to stay with us and that you didn't love us anymore, as she continues to say >>.
<< I know, Greg. We all know it >> John continues, pointing at himself and the Holmes with a gesture of the hand. << But you were a boy too and you know how difficult it was to talk to your parents. Especially when you saw them already tried and shaken >>.
<< You didn't tell either of them what your sister did two months ago >> deduces Sherlock and the boy looks at him in amazement. George swallows several times before slowly nodding, his gaze down. << And you fear that she will repeat it >> Sherlock adds and the boy tightens his eyes from which some tears fall.
<< Hey, Myc, are you all right? >> asks him, taking refuge in his instinct as a doctor ready to take care of others.
<< I didn't want to >> she whispers in a broken voice. << I tried to stop her, but did not listen to me >> adds and big shiny tears are released from the eyes and roll on her cheeks. << I convinced her to leave him a blanket, so maybe he can survive >>.
<< Hey, Billy, I think you're right, you know? Adults lose sight of priorities and sometimes forget to be simple human beings. Maybe this story will help your dad to learn that it is good not to underestimate others >>.
<< How can you remember the commitments that I myself forget? >> John question, annoyed by that second unwelcome intrusion into his private life. << We are on a case and I ... >>.
<< This is the landfill of a serial killer >> Sherlock replies, recovering with difficulty from the last retch.
<< If you listened to your intuition, instead of silencing it as always, and if you observing rather than looking, you would understand the reason for what I just said, John >> he replies, addressing him in an unusual way in the presence of a client. << Since my colleague has not understood who you are, can you please introduce yourself? >> he asks the boy, who witnessed that scene incredulously.
<< I will reply when we are out of here in more humane temperatures! >> retorts acid. << You fathom the video footage of the cameras, especially the one out here, and you will find your other man. You should be able to interrogate him and understand if you are dealing with a rapist or with an occasional lover so fiery as to make his partner heart attack >>.
<< He should be in his kennel, right? >>. John try to be serious, but Sherlock's behaviour is so beautiful that he doesn't .
<< You was busy in these two days: everyone knows Morgan in the neighborhood! Angelo gave him a giant bone and  sais that you are too rigid >>.
<< Dogs' skin is very hard. I don't think my cold hands bother him >> Sherlock says nervously. John caresses Sherlock's fingers, the back of his hand, the hollow of the wrist.
<< Let's go and see if Morgan and William agree >> Ms O'Hara says, confirming to them that Morgan will be in good loving hands.
"Jesus, they make her go around alone" he sighs. John's eyes are increasingly attracted by the features partially covered by the blue scarf and by the enormous hands forced into leather gloves.
<< Yeah >> Sherlock nods. << And the fury made her lose sight of the danger in which she would have put herself if she killed me. Mary was unable to make 'the other' the reason. Her bad part is pure madness >>.
<< Sit down! >> the guard orders her, pointing to the chair, before going to the wall she leans against. Mary does not carry out the order. She approaches the chair but remains standing, hrt eyes fixed on John.
<< I am ... relieved of this case >> he sighs, despising to seem a victim of circumstances. Greg rolls his eyes. He turns his back on the door and plantes his hands on his hips, giving Sherlock a look of reproach very similar to that dedicated to his children to quell their quarrel.
<< Damn asshole! >> exclaims. << And damn storm >> he adds, turned to the window with snow-caked glass.
<< Exactly! Fuck, then I had seen right! >> George exclaims enthusiastically. << In according to me this invitations sounded strange because they did not ask for any authorization from the parents. It do not reassured me that Lizzy said they happened in public places. I secretly followed her to one of the last public seminars she attended. I didn't like at all the adults who held it! >> George shakes his head in disgust.
<< Hey, Captain Kidd, can you keep it a secret? >> asks Sherlock with a whisper. The child nods, raising his eyes to meet Sherlock's eyes. << Even my parents were two idiots. My father was just like yours, violent with words and hands and cold as ice. The only thing that mattered to him was his reputation and career. The other things were a frame that had to be perfect and flawless. My mother suffered his outbursts, but, unlike yours, she did not read me  books before going to sleep, nor did she play pirates with me. She too was distant, unreachable. I learned not to cry anymore, to not feel anything and to use only my intelligence, the only thing that seemed to be really important. But family said to me for a long time that I was a fool >> Sherlock says, wiping the tears from his face. << Then I tried to run away from them. From their memory. I hurted myself to drive away their voices. I have lost sight of myself in an attempt to make myself accepted for who I am, to change them. Except that they didn't change, they always remained cold, severe, distant and lost in their priorities. I was changing instead. I became like them, because, unfortunately, I loved them and wanted their love. To the point of forgetting to love myself. In spite of all this, if I am the man that you see now, is also thanks to them. If they had been different I don't know if I would have pursued my goal and created this unique profession in the world. I don't know if I would be happy as I am now. I could not choose my parents, but I was able to choose my friends from whom I obtained the love and recognition that I needed and that I deserve. Also from the four-legged ones >>, Sherlock says, caressing Morgan who opens an eye and then closes it, muttering annoyed, << and from the two-legged ones >> he says, placing his heartfelt gaze on John's moved one. << William, surround yourself with trusted people who can remember how much you are worth and love you for who you are and not for what they want you to be. You have Kelly, who loves you like a mother, and your mom. Well, I think that after what happened, she will be able to fight for you. For yours and her happiness >>.
<< If you were such a maniac and you saw your latest victim return to the place where he suffered your aggression, what would you think about? >>.
<< Since returning from the pub, you mean? >> Greg asks him and John nods, carefully watching the wooden floor under the snow-wet boots. << Oh my God, it is already difficult to deal with him when he is sober, I dare not imagine when he is drunk >>.
<< More than psychiatry there is an exorcist to be alerted >> Greg mumbles behind him, lost in reading the same manuscript.
Sherlock nods against John's shoulder. He crouches in John's arms in search of comfort and, although not the best of times, John feels great joy.
<< It will pass soon, you will see >> the little Mary said, looking, however, alarmed the liquid more red than straw yellow present in that object. She replaced the antibiotic bag and increased the morphine before leaving him alone in the dark.
<< A divorce is never a walk for a child and I fear that your husband, madam, will not give up his grip so easily >>.
John decides to leave Sherlock's hand and leave that room after days sitting by his side. He caresses Sherlock's face, barely beaded with sweat. John remains hesitant to look at Sherlock's lips, eager to place his own on them and kiss him.
<< The Fenix portal, a complex and well-organized system that has been operating for months in most of Europe and impossible to eradicate >> Sherlock whispers, his gaze lost in front of him. << I feared from the first moments that there was Moriarty behind that hellish circle. The constant failures of Sky always gave me confirmation >>.
<< Too involved? >> the detective replies loudly. << Haven't you understood yet that without him you lose your compass? >>.
<< I want to stay with you >> whispers the child. Sherlock and John exchange a surprised look. << Mum and dad made a mess, I don't want to be with them anymore. I told dad that I didn't like Sharon and that I didn't want that she staied with with Silver, but he didn't listen to me. Dad said I was too young and that those were big decisions. It's  fault of mom and her book if Sharon's gone crazy. I don't want my parents anymore >> William says, crying silently in the consultant's warm and reassuring embrace.
Sherlock is speechless. He hears John's voice far away and cannot grasp the meaning of what he is saying to him. A drug was the only possible explanation for his being dazed and strained. This was what happened to him when he made morphine. Sherlock cannot believe that his body has betrayed him, that it was a malaise caused by excessive heat that made him a helpless victim in the attacker's hands. There hasn't no external cause of chemical origin. The only external cause can be attributed to his stubbornness in not taking care of himself. Maybe John is not wrong and he has really a food problem. Sherlock has always been uninterested in food since childhood and even then said that digestion slowed him down.
<< Oh my God, how blind you are? >> Sherlock replies, shaking his head in a theatrical way. He grabs John by the arm and brings him to the wall. << The victim has very evident bruises on his left biceps >>, he says, grabbing John’s biceps with his hand, << a sign that was held firmly by a man's hand. The victim also has a bruise less marked but still visible on the left cheek, which tells us that the killer must have kept it this way >> he says, placing his left hand against John's cheek. << And another on the right collarbone where he rested his elbow >> he says, leaning against John. << It is possible to deduce that premises on him with considerable force. Do I have to go on or is it clear enough? >>.
<< I'll take the big one that Silver liked so much! >> says the child enthusiastically and Morgan jumps around him happily.
<< I'm not crazy, Mycroft. You know how a Mind Palace works. Even you came to my aid. You spurred me to relive that scene. That terrible moment when I had to run away from our father for the second time >>.
<< The forensic's men found the uniform with the tear, as you said. They were trying to force the PC password ... >> Greg says. Sherlock looks up at the sky and pushes him away from the door to enter the studio. He is forced to cover his nose and mouth affected by an intense smell.
<< No, because at this time you'll be there to watch my back >> Sherlock smiles satisfied. << Unless you have an appointment with the woman that was with you at the sauna >> Sherlock adds, waving his hand in a theatrical way.
Sherlock stops breathing. He bites the lip, a gesture that makes the heart and the flap of the soldier's trousers flicker. Without saying anything, remaining in apnea, Sherlock's right hand long fingers  approaches to touch John's lips.
<< Where are your brothers now, Mary >> asks her and the woman suddenly shuts up. Sherlock fears that he has taken a false step. Now, she will fall into a trance and the violent Mary will come out and put an end to Sherlock's suffering once and for all. Instead, the Mary-child shakes her head and shrugs.
<< Damn, I couldn't have left you there! >> exclaims. << I lost my best boots, damn you. Why did you come to travel in this weather? >> she says, pointing to the storm outside the window.
A scream comes down and John holds his breath. He knows they are going to say it. They are about to announce that they have found a man's corps, the seat belt still inserted and the face covereb by the exploded airbag .
<< So, doctor, do you think that we will ever have the pleasure of seeing safely again that fool I have for brother? >>.
Sherlock chuckles shaking his head. Then he looks at the master with disgust, as if he were annoyed by his smell.
<< Mom was nervous. When dad gets angry we are all more tense, but I never seen her so nervous. Mum tried to convince dad to call the police, but he said to her that she was stupid >> whispers William.
<< I don't say this, no. I saw him smile and play with the puppy, and I assure you that it was a good sight. That guy needs to thaw out a bit. Sherlock's already changed a lot since he's with you >>.
<< You are right. Ashley doesn't deserve it >> he says and he's not even sure that that's the girl's name. << See you tomorrow morning >> he says, keening to go away.
<< Oh come on, don't be the cold and emotionless consultant detective >> John says, pinching Sherlock's thin thigh. << I don't believe it anymore. You read some pages of her novel... >>.
John thinks, approaching the puppy, that tends his legs towards him. John caresses him, smiling at his quick licking his hands. Sherlock washed the puppy with one of his precious shampoos, judging by how much it smells, and his fur, despite the dim light of the room, seems have a pleasant chocolate tone. Despite the washing, it's impossible to understand the puppy's breed .
John remains still, his hands behind his back, watching Sherlock do that unusual job of tidying up before sitting down in his armchair. Only then does John take his place. John sees Sherlock looking an unspecified point on the chimney and he decides that it takes tea to face the latter part of the story. John puts the kettle on and prepares the cups, occasionally glancing at his flatmate, always lost in contemplating the fireplace. John sits down with the two cups in his hand and, contrary to what he thought, Sherlock wakes up to take his own from him.
<< I think it can happen there as in other places where you allow yourself to lose control, Sherlock. Maybe nudity helps >> gets out of the bathroom and slowly rotates on itself. << So how am I? >>.
Nothing even towards the Abbott farm, the only one they have failed to contact, given the communications that always stop there with these climatic conditions. The inspector tried to convince John of the impossibility of Mary's involvement in this story.
<< I don't allow you to speak! >> the man shouts interrupting John. << I don't know who you are and why you are here. I feel directly involved in this case and I will not tolerate further wasting time. Lestrade, I consider you responsible for the presence of these strange characters on the scene... >>.
<< The impact must have broken that large branch that destroied the windshield >> continues Hataway, indicating the huge branch that slipped a little further and held back by another tree.
<< In your opinion, Lizzy, why did Daisy and Rosaline commit suicide? They looked like two senior tutors, as you described them >> asks Sherlock to the girl, diverting John from his thoughts.
<< I was an asshole, Sherlock >> he whispers. << I ... I could go back I wouldn't say anything. Not even one of the absurd words I said on Sunday morning. I ... I kicked the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm sorry. I'd like to ask you to forgive me and give me a second chance, but ... Jesus, I wouldn't give it to myself. I was afraid of losing you. It was very bad >> he says, sobs. << I'm happy to know you are alive and ... that's enough for me >>.
"You taught me something new Sherlock, yet another!" John thinks, sighing, now that the door before him opens and Mary Abbott enters, accompanied by another guard.
<< I bought him some boxes of pet's food. They are in the last drawer of the kitchen. The leash is close to the violin >>.
<< Do you think that the kidnapper already tried three months ago to enter the house and that something went wrong? >>.
<< For this reason I tell you that you was lucky. And you decided to turn your backto this luck . Pathetic >> Mycroft says disgusted. << Your children are lucky because they have a good father next to them. One of those fathers who continues to love them, who never doubts or gives up and who continues to struggle despite having no faults. The children for whom you says you are fighting and who, instead, you have put them in dangered them, by leaving them at the mercy of themselves, this children are lucky because they will overcome this bad moment, knowing that they can count on their father, although if he stay with them for few time >> Mycroft says, smiling at Greg, who blushes embarrassed by these heartfelt words, which everyone couldn't think could have come from someone like Mycroft.
‘Hey, love, listen to me. Don’t worry. Sherlock didn’t mean it. It is possible that he won’t even remember that he behaved like this later. It is the brain injury talking, alright? It will get better.’ He explained slowly because Rosie really needed to understand. She furrowed her brow and didn’t say anything.
‘Yes, I think I am.’ She whispered. ‘I… shouldn’t I say something to him?’ she asked, and it occurred to John that he didn’t say anything to Sherlock yet.
‘We’ll do a final check up tomorrow morning and if it all comes out all right you can be going home in the afternoon.’ Doctor Moore said with a warm smile. ‘Of course, you’ll need to continue the exercises and I would advise you to start going outside only gradually. Try to stay in a quiet, calm environment for some time.’
‘Okay, I think we should get back inside.’ John said and smiled encouragingly. He feared another outburst; however, he didn’t want to leave Sherlock alone. ‘Can we?’ Rosie nodded.
‘That is nice of you, Rosie. But be careful, okay?’ If he were honest, he didn’t want anything else than to cuddle with Sherlock at night again but obviously, he wouldn’t fit.
‘I cannot explain that, Rosie. But that’s how it is. Coma is not a proper sleep and the patients are tired after they wake up from it.’ John said honestly.
So, Sherlock must have taken it off, then, John thought. But when? Had he have it on before the chase? ‘Well, Sherlock,’ he said when alone again, ‘I guess that’s another mystery only you can enlighten me about.’
After Rosie let go of Sherlock reluctantly and went to school with Mrs. Hudson, nurse Caroline came to check on Sherlock, and on John, too, probably. She also brought a bowl of water and washcloth. John took it from her and started to wash Sherlock gently. Then he shaved the stubble that had formed on his face and which he usually couldn’t stand. He then moved and massaged his limbs as the nurse said would be good.
They sat next to each other and were holding hands in a silence until John broke it. ‘Thank you for telling me. I understand how it might have felt. But I also see how much you have changed over the years. You enjoy every bit of family life… yeah, I observe sometimes, too. Even the lazy Sundays you love.’ He smiled at Sherlock teasingly and nudged him. When their eyes met, he continued. ‘And you are a wonderful father to Rosie.’
‘But John, I don’t want to do that. I used to put work on the first place in front of anything else and it was the stupidest idea ever and it was slowly killing me.’ Sherlock was positively panting now, tears falling freely from his eyes and to John it seemed dangerously close to panic attack. ‘And when I took off the ring it felt like doing it again and I’m sorry John you and Rosie are the most important-‘
‘Yes, it does. But I think he is actually quite near.’ He answered and lost himself in thoughts for a second. ‘He just needs to break through.’
So, after Rosie returned, greeted them both and told them all about her day, she prepared to play Sherlock’s favourite peace from her limited repertoire. But as she didn’t play for so long, she had to bestir her fingers by ‘tedious’ scales and etudes. After a few minutes, she was ready.
John stood beside them, his eyes glistening with new tears. He let Rosie have her private moment with Sherlock and then bowed down to them, one hand on Rosie’s back, the other on Sherlock’s arm and kissed Rosie on her head. Only then did Rosie let go of Sherlock and sat down in one of the chairs beside the bed. She placed her hand on Sherlock’s wrist.
‘Yes, we will go now and come back tomorrow.’ Mrs. Holmes added and tried to reach for Sherlock’s hand, but he avoided her touch.
‘The point I want to make is that it doesn’t matter that I don’t recall who was the first in history to exchange wedding rings. Because I know the one thing about it that matters. That is, why I put it on your finger.’
‘But Dad! I’m seven, I’m not a baby. Besides, I saw human eyeballs and a human heart yesterday and it was interesting.’
Rosie didn’t even register it from her position. She shifted so she was half lying beside Sherlock with her face pressed against his arm. John kissed Sherlock’s hand once more.
Rosie was silent, just nodded again. Usually, she was very talkative and had a response to everything but now it was obvious that she was sorting that out in her head and was preparing. She was afraid. But that was okay, John thought. It meant that she knew it wasn’t going to be easy. The fear meant understanding, too.
John didn’t even realize that the room felt silent until Rosie appeared at his side. ‘Papa?’ she whispered and reached for Sherlock’s hand, which John released. ‘Did I play it well?’ she asked quietly and Sherlock, miracle of miracles, moved his fingers and pressed them against Rosie’s palm. She smiled while tears spilled from her eyes. John put an arm around her shoulders and hugged her. He was smiling, too and even though he knew this still didn’t mean Sherlock would recover fully, he felt happy.
‘Of course. We will run some tests in the following hours, too, including identifying the coma level. We will inform you about that in person tomorrow.’ The doctor confirmed, and John squeezed Sherlock’s hand one more time, whispered one more ‘I love you’ and went away. He didn’t protest. After all, he knew that ICU was strict in this, for good reasons, and besides, he was too tired to argue. Not mentioning the fact that he had a seven-year-old waiting for him. Nevertheless, nothing could stop him from feeling like he was abandoning Sherlock. He couldn’t think of anything else during the ride home.
Sherlock wasn’t answering for a moment so he wanted to try and explain: ‘Because if it’s just because you feel that this is your fault or-‘
And just like that, it began. They made love for the first time two days after that. After a year went by, Sherlock asked John to marry him, which John did just a few weeks after that in the presence of their families and closest friends. They enjoyed their happy domestic life with John helping a few hours a week at the clinic and both helping Lestrade with cases not boring but not too dangerous at the same time. They brought Rosie with them, however not at crime scenes involving dead body and she was not allowed in the morgue either even though she argued every time.
John thought about it for a while and then continued. ‘Well, it’s a new environment, new teachers, new potential friends.’
‘But then I stopped to think about what it means. That I… that I am putting you, our marriage… and Rosie aside because of work.’ Sherlock was now breathing quickly, and he was on the verge of crying. John wanted to say something. To assure him that it was okay, that he was overthinking it. But he didn’t manage as Sherlocked began to rant.
It was like unwrapping a gift under a Christmas tree, thinking it is the new video game you wanted only to find out that it is a box of socks. The moment of joy was over. If Rosie wasn’t there and didn’t look so shocked and perplexed, he would have thought that his brain played tricks on him and that it didn’t happen at all.
Mycroft stood there so awkwardly that John just sighed and stepped back from Sherlock. ‘I’ll give you some privacy, shall I.’ he said and aimed for the hall though he didn’t get any response.
“You were dying just fine yourself even without my help, yes!” John was shouting now. With this memory in front of his eyes he started to feel fully how he’d hated himself for it. Sherlock remained silent this time; head slightly tilted downwards looking on the floor. After a little while John continued.
‘Yeah. I’m at the hospital. Sherlock…’ his voice trailed of as new tears threatened to flood his eyes and he let out a shaky breath.
‘This is great, Dr. Watson. Patients are extremely tired after coma and they aren’t awake for more than a few minutes the first time, as Mr. Holmes here. It will lengthen gradually.’
‘Please. The coloured water they called a tea at the hospital was killing me.’ John answered as he sat at the kitchen table.
‘Hey.’ John said awkwardly when they entered the room. Sherlock was half sitting half lying on the bed and he looked much more relaxed. In answer, he looked at them both, smiled and then asked:
Before he managed to say more, doctor Moore entered the room and motioned to John to follow him outside. There, after the necessary courteous ‘good mornings’ and ‘how are you’s, the doctor began to explain what it looked like with Sherlock.
‘Can I sleep here tonight?’ Rosie asked as she settled into her previous position. ‘I want Sherlock to know he is not alone if he wakes up at night.’ She said, always so thoughtful.
Rosie fell into her chair. ‘But he-‘ she started but couldn’t continue as tears were falling from her eyes and quiet sobs escaped her throat. ‘He moved his hand but then… why-‘
‘Actually,’ John said, ‘I know about something. Could you bring…or rather have Rosie’s violin brought here?’
‘Yes. We should.’ A few seconds of silence followed, then Rosie whispered: ‘It feels… odd. When he’s-‘ but she didn’t finish as she felt like crying again.
John thought she might ask about this. He didn’t want to deny her of seeing Sherlock, but it could be very destressing for her. Especially on the ICU. Besides, there was a reason for the hospital rules.
Rosie nodded and John left. He suddenly realised that he hadn’t eaten anything since that morning and his stomach growled.
Sherlock remained motionless, but John continued to lightly press his lips against his and pressed down the worry. Not yet. After all, he still remembered how Sherlock reacted to being called his best friend. And just as he began to pull away to really check out on Sherlock, the full soft lips began to move against his and it was one of the most powerful moments of his life. The kiss remained innocent but insistent and full of emotion.
‘It will be a long process to full recovery.’ The doctor said to John after he saw his worried expression.
‘Sherlock?’ John whispered. Nothing. It was so weird. Sherlock’s eyes were open but unfocused as if he were looking through the ceiling. John saw that Rosie was confused and she tried very hard not to cry again. John then reached for Sherlock’s hand and squeezed a bit but that didn’t rouse any reaction either. Instead, Sherlock’s eyes closed slowly again.
So, the next day, they forced themselves to eat something early in the morning and set out to go to the hospital. Mrs. Hudson said she would go and see them in Sherlock’s room in the afternoon. During the cab ride there, John got a message.
Sherlock raised his hand as much as he could and laid it onto Rosie’s. He smiled weakly and then looked at John. His eyes were almost closing again. ‘I-‘ he tried to say but John understood even though he hadn’t finished.
‘There.’ John said when he finished. He thought about what to say next when his phone rang. It startled him, and it took him a while before he went to answer it. It was Sherlock’s mother. Suddenly, as he looked at the name on the screen, John felt a new wave of sorrow. He took a deep breath.
‘That’s beautiful, Bee.’ Sherlock said, a bit choked up, and laid a kiss the top of Rosie’s head. ‘Thank you.’
‘Sorry.’ She said while John was sitting down beside her. He smiled as much as he could in the moment.
‘You know, in most hospitals, children under twelve aren’t allowed in the ICU rooms.’ She just frowned a bit. She wanted to see her papa, of course, but she was terrified of it, too. ‘And they could move him to a regular room in a few days and then we could even stay with him longer.’ John really hoped for this. And then to hell with visiting hours.
‘No, no. He won’t.’ John answered, trying to convince himself. But he wanted to be honest with his daughter, too, so he added: ‘Listen, why don’t we all sit down with tea and talk?’
“Oh hello Rosie. Your father hasn’t woken up yet. You’ll have to wait.” she only stretched her arms more and whimpered a bit. Sherlock stared down at her, a hint of fear in his eyes. As he was standing there Rosie started to cry. John woke up and as soon as he saw the scene he knew what was going on.
Sherlock scoffed. “No, of course I’m not scared of her. Although children can be very dangerous. There was this case in-“
He also called Mrs. Hudson, who agreed to walk Rosie to school from the hospital. When he was speaking to her, he realised he didn’t know anything about Sherlock’s parents. It wasn’t like them not visiting Sherlock or to visit with Mycroft, unnoticed. Maybe they didn’t even know. But now it was quite late in the evening, so he thought it would be best to think about what to do the next day.
‘Food.’ Sherlock simply answered and the way he said it reminded John of the time in Baskerville when Sherlock pronounced the word ‘friends’ as if it were the most repulsive thing in the world. Ever since that night, Sherlock had never been so angry. Until now.
room tonight or tomorrow morning. But we want to make sure that there is no further damage to his brain so today we will do more tests like CT scan, MRI.’
“John I… I’m scared.” That was something John hadn’t quite expected. Sherlock hardly ever admitted his fears or uncertainty along almost every other emotion.
John stopped and leaned heavily on the wall of the abandoned factory. Obviously, he was not on the right track and he should run back to find Sherlock, but he needed a while. He couldn’t catch his breath and he felt like his whole body was on fire. After all, John wasn’t thirty anymore….or forty for that matter, and also, he and Sherlock weren’t chasing criminals in the middle of the night for quite some time now.
‘Yeah, but that’s the point, isn’t it?’ John said and broke Sherlock’s train of thought. The thing is, that by this point John was done. He was really tired of the pretending and cautiousness. It was still possible that Sherlock didn’t want romantic relationship, but he would have to rely on the strength of their friendship. He had a lot of time to think in the hospital as he couldn’t sleep in the sterile environment. He just went through the facts in his head…that they lived like a married couple already. Heck, they raised a child together. And John wanted all of it. He craved it. Because he loved Sherlock with all his heart and saw that Sherlock cared for him in the least. And so, in the hospital bed he decided that he would stop being coward and do something about it.
Downstairs they stopped at the hallway to kiss. Sherlock broke the kiss only reluctantly, but he needed to say this. ‘John.’ He whispered, and John knew immediately that it was something important.
‘John, Rosie can’t go dressed like this, she just can’t. It’s her first day! You think she’ll make a good impression in this?’ Sherlock shot back and pointed at Rosie with an expression of disbelief. She had her bee dresses on.
They took a cab to Baker Street and at 5 p.m., they arrived home. Just as they stepped inside from the street, Mrs. Hudson and Rosie greeted them with open arms.
‘I’ve explained already to Mr. Holmes earlier this morning, but I presume you’d like to hear it from me directly, too.’
At that, John started laughing like he hadn’t for quite some time. ‘As Your Highness commands.’ He said finally and kissed Sherlock’s forehead. ‘But be prepared for some sort of a welcome dinner or something from Mrs. Hudson. You’ll have to wait for the sex.’
“Sherlock, for a genius you have really silly fears. I’m sure you won’t drop her just like that and you certainly won’t hurt her just by holding and carrying her.”
‘Over here!’ he screamed after what sounded like ten years of waiting until he’d heard the approaching footsteps. The paramedics appeared, and John let them tend to Sherlock. They carried him on the stretcher toward the ambulance. In there, John held on Sherlock’s ankle, which was the only part of him he could reach from his position and prayed to whatever God was above that Sherlock would survive.
<< From a woman during an occasional relationship >> answers Greg.Sherlock glares at him and strokes away.
<< You shouted. Many times >> she says. Sherlock didn't hear her go up the stairs. He didn't realize how firm she was at the door. Mary-child's eyes look at him curiously, leaning on the chair next to the bed.
<< These are the documents I requested from the chief of the hotel >> Sherlock tells him. << The names of the Spa staff and their planning >>.
The shift in the clinic is slow and boring. Colds, rheumatism, gastritis ... must be the equivalent of jealous husbands and petty thefts from Sherlock's point of view. John has made up for the hour of delay and is about to leave, waiting for the clock of the stamping machine to strike at six. He has repeatedly thought of sending a message to Sherlock, both to apologize for the illogical gesture he has made, and to ask for updates on the case. John wrote many texts between one patient and the other, but in the end he always deleted them, putting away his cell phone with a sigh of heartache. Yet another painful twinge pierces his stomach and takes his breath away. John puts his hand on it and tries to breathe deeply to relieve the pain.
<< Well ... there is always a place in the dormitory for you, Captain. It is not a problem for me if you wants to stay. And you too, Mr. Holmes >> the detective says, turning to Mycroft. << I have a communication from Scotland Yard here for you, colleague >> he adds, handing Greg a circular. He takes it, reads it and snorts, rolling his eyes.
<< Because I lied to her >> retorts Sherlock. << I was wrong to lie to her. I should have told her immediately who I am >>.
<< It is absurd, Sherlock >> chuckles the doctor. << This makes us understand how Moriarty doesn't knows nothing about human nature! A daughter who kills herself destroys her father much more than discovering her stuck in a round of pedoprostitution and seeing her compromising photos online. It is certainly not pleasant, but at least one does not cry over a lifeless corps >>.
<< You don't risk forced labor anymore, John >> Greg sais. << Do you want to tell me that Sherlock is completely indifferent for you? >>.
Sherlock asks him to climb over his back and the enthusiastic child clings to his shoulders. Morgan barks at that strange new game.
<< You're the one who always wrong the times, Sherlock, not him >> she smiles at him. Sherlock looks at her bewildered, unable to understand her words. << Love does not kill, my son. Love saves >>.
<< I don't know, John >> says Greg, who works to guarantee a moment of privacy to his friend, by tightening the venetian blinds. << Why do you have to think of the worst? Even his brother is calm and we both know how much smarter he is than Sherlock. If Mycroft Holmes smelled something worth worrying about, do you think he wouldn't have immediately mobilized the whole MI6 for Sherlock? >>.
<< John, I guess it is better if you take him away from here and quickly >> Greg said elbowing him, when he saw him shake off Bryan, that he was taking too much freedom whit him.
<< A rather unusual modus operandi for a kidnapper >> says Sherlock, his hands clasped under his chin. << And also for someone like Ford. I can't see him being subjected to the blackmail of a stranger, just because he keeps his wife under fire >>.
John hears Mrs. Hudson go to open and then Greg's heavy and fast steps on the stairs, which John too is now able to recognize.
<< Apparently >>. Sherlock lets go of the blanket and shakes his brother's hand. << You have always been at my side every awakening from those frightening journeys that I made in the abysses of my unconscious >> smiles at him, seeing him blush just on the pale cheeks.
<< You are smarter than Sherlock, even he admitted it. Don't say, however, that I told you, please >> John adds, biting his tongue in front of what had to remain a confidence. Mycroft laughs amused at a time when laughter is totally out of place. Just like his brother. << Do you see? You are the same! >> John exclaims, rolling his eyes. << I can assist you as I did to him >>.
<< Drink the broth, it will do you good >> the woman invites him, interrupting that silent quarrel. Although he would do without it, Sherlock takes the plate with both hands and brings it to his mouth. He must keep the woman in the 'happy child' mode as much as possible if he wants to get out of here alive.
<< You wanted me to touch you, you damned pervert? >> she cried, tearing off of his body the stained sheets. For a moment Sherlock had feared she would hit him in the genitals. Luckily she had only thrown to him at a towel, that Sherlock had used to stop the hemorrhage. She ran out, leaving him in bed, naked as a worm, still partially wet from the wash she was carrying on.
<< You are right. For this reason I will report it. As soon as I finish the criminal investigation and take that bastard I will make known what he did to me and I will try to convince the other victims to do the same. I would do the criminal a favor by being silent and I would fail in my mission: to ensure that justice is done >>.
<< In obtaining authorization to lure other young in exchange for a fictitious recognition valid only within the portal. There are super-known teens, famous as Hollywood stars with a lot of power in their hands. Literally the power of life or death over their peers. The last word, of course, belongs to the portal manager, but it seems that it is very easy to convince him >>.
<< To save you, Mary >> tries to explain John, but the woman looks at him confused. << They want to accuse you for killing all those people >>.
<< Two days? >>. John looks at the date on the clock radio and can't believe he slept so much. << You just went to bed, I guess >>.
