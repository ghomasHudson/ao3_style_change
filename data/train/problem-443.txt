“What do you know about all of this?” John had zeroed in on a lifeline, a miraculous, deus-ex-machina lifeline, and he was about to use it.
John was scrubbing the worst of the dust off his face, and said through his sleeve, “Moriarty. But he’s almost cert’ly dead now—“ added the doctor as Sherlock unconsciously grabbed his shoulder, scanning the debris as if the madman were about to leap out and strike.
The detective saw stars for a moment, but after he could see past the haze of pain being punched in broken ribs produced, he realized that he was now lying flat on his back, as the thug’s blow had knocked him clear over the back of the chair to which he was theoretically still bound hand and foot. That explained why the bit of hired muscle in question was now looking at Sherlock as if he were some sort of ghost. Or rather, as if Sherlock had simply confirmed his suspicions that he was, in fact, some sort of ghost. At any rate, it was a particularly handy supposition, as it sent the larger man practically running from the room.
“Anderson!”  Lestrade rebuked his inferior. “This isn’t a drugs bust, so stop poking around or you’ll get us all killed.”
Sherlock had even started solving cases again. He and John had developed a system in which John would read e-mailed requests for help aloud, and Sherlock would do his best to indicate the solutions to people’s puzzles. John ended up with a far greater knowledge of how many mundane cases he and Sherlock were given on a regular basis, as the only ones they could solve under the circumstances were ones that didn’t require the detective to directly observe anything. And yet, he still solved nearly all of them, usually before John had finished reading their descriptions. These were the cases that Sherlock would normally turn down before John got a chance to see them, but as far as entertaining his detective was concerned, they were the best the doctor could do under the circumstances.
The detective shifted his position slightly, testing how much he could move in each direction. He also wiggled his fingers, bringing blood flow back to them as a way to gauge exactly what position he was in, but even before they started to swell and ache with feeling Sherlock deduced that what was holding him to the chair was, in fact, a straightjacket. It was obvious really; when one was tied with traditional bonds, one could expect significant chafing against the skin while struggling. In this case, attempts to move were met with more widespread pressure and an aching in his shoulder muscles consistent with having his arms pulled around his front and behind his back. Therefore, straightjacket. Doubtless, there were some extra straps holding the device to the back of the chair, although he didn’t doubt he’d be able to unfasten them when the time came.
So John had been forced to make another last-minute rescue, illegal gun blaring as he raced to save his oft-captured flatmate and more-than-friend.
Sherlock lifted his head and seemed to ponder this for a minute before looking at the top of John’s head, twisting as much as he could with two broken ribs.
Still, it would be better for John if I escaped sooner. Prolonged absence is more likely to result in psychological damage. How much more likely, I’d know if I had an internet connection. Sherlock longed for his phone, not for the first time. Being deprived of research was as bad as lack of food and nicotine withdrawal put together. He had managed to create the perfect network, access a perfect web of information, just to be cut out of the middle of it and put in a box like any other spider a schoolchild found interesting.
The dark-haired man was lying across a beaten-up couch, rosining his bow. Without looking up, he responded, “You spoke to Dr. Donovan.”
John ignored her entirely. Although the footage had no sound, the doctor could almost hear the strain of human ribs, the crack of head against pavement. In spite of himself, he half stood up, all instinct telling him to go, to help the man on the computer screen. Lestrade saw the movement and put a hand on John’s shoulder. “Watch,” he said, not unkindly.
As Mycroft left, John turned back to Sherlock. His Sherlock. Moriarty wouldn’t be taking him away without a fight.
There is a lot of running around and hand-waving and it all comes to a head where John is caught and the big bads know that he was trying to expose them and he has a letter opener to his neck (they're going to make it look like suicide) but and Sherlock comes in. He's doing a remarkable impression of a human being, despite being mostly flying somewhere above reality. Sherlock is pointing John's gun and bluffing about his ability to use it, and it seems like it will work but it doesn't. So, he produces the specimen jar and shares a meaningful look with John. We don't know the meaning. John does. Sherlock throws the floppy bag of drugs in the air, everyone goes to catch it, the biggest bad does but John takes the opportunity to get the letter opener. He STABS THE BIG BAD IN THE HAND, THROUGH THE SUPER DUPER BLOOD THINNER BAG. This gets some of the drug into the wound, and even around the knife it starts bleeding alarmingly. John smugly informs the bad guy that if he wants any chance of survival at all, he's going to have to leave the letter opener in and get medical treatment immediately. Big Bad and Big Bad's Goons are distracted enough that John and Sherlock get out.
“What do you want?” Sherlock asked the air in front of him, rather more softly this time. It would be good to know the sensitivity of the microphones in this room.
And there was nothing for it, a sulk there was to be. The microscope had been his last chance, his last hope at staving off the black mood that had been looming these past few days. All his life, Sherlock had lived in Schrodinger’s box. And at this moment, as at any moment when true boredom loomed, he knew there was nothing that could keep the vial of poison from spilling its contents. The detective could do nothing now but close his eyes and wait for the swirling gas of malaise to dissipate. With a pained expression, he settled to wait out his personal hell.
“That,” said Sherlock, indicating the older man, “Is Elihu Stubbingwicke, eccentric medical researcher and the founder of Biopharm Limited. Two years ago he died, and left the business to his son, Kenneth,” Sherlock pointed to the younger man in the picture. “And with the change in management, Biopharm doubled in worth overnight.” The consulting detective sat back and looked at John, having apparently made his point.
John looked over at Anthea, who was sleeping like a perfectly normal stick-person with her head on a cushion, looking so different from how Sherlock did when he took over that particular couch. The detective could sleep in any position, whether sprawled like an emaciated starfish or curled up on one side with his face in the pillows like a little child, but he never looked ordinary.
So John’s closest person in the world was present, perhaps even aware to some extent, but trapped in his own skin. Still, Sherlock was alive, and safe, and that was more wonderful than John could say. Everything else was just details and time.
The doctor rolled his eyes. Usually he’d have better manners, but the man in front of him had just given him two thirds of a heart attack, and was now acting like nothing much was happening. So, John reasoned, sarcasm was not only allowed, but called for. He responded, “Hmm, let me think? The man in the middle of a dangerous medical procedure and a dangerous government mission goes missing without a word in the middle of the night, and I assumed he might be in some sort of trouble. Yep, I was totally overreacting.”
But would he though? This was an old building, one with solid construction, and Moriarty didn’t seem to be wearing half as many explosives as his victims from his first game with Sherlock. And the detective, up a level and towards the back of the flat with his experiment, should be fine in the case of a minor explosion. Mrs. Hudson was out, the street had been deserted and probably still was, would there ever be a better opportunity?
“Again, unimportant, Doctor. You are doubtless aware of his somewhat . . . unique position in the biopharmaceutical facility?”
At least John seemed to understand that. For all that he could be so dull at times, John always understood the most important things. Sherlock felt his lips twitch a bit, and fluttered his fingers against John's sleeping wrist before sinking towards the darkness again.
P.S. Sherlock's look to John was just telling him to utilize the distraction. He didn't even think of using blood thinner as a weapon. But he was super impressed, and tells John so. John is a little smug.
“John!”  Sherlock batted blood-streaked hands from his doctor’s face, patting him down in search of serious injury.
“So, tonight is the last time I can be sure to be in possession of all of my faculties. Thus, it has become imperative that I share with you my findings, as I may be unable to adequately do so in the future. Trust me, I’m no more pleased with these circumstances than you are.”
He tried the men’s bathroom, the women’s bathroom, Umbrella Man’s closet, and even the staff lounge to no avail. John was considering the relative immorality of checking the other IPs’ rooms while the occupants were still asleep when he ran into Sally Donovan. Zeroing in on the familiar face, he approached her.
The consulting detective closed his eyes slowly. Moriarty certainly didn’t understand him, or his association with John, at all. The best he, Sherlock, could do was find a way out of this particular plan before Moriarty could involve anyone else from the outside. Because while Sherlock could take whatever the criminal threw at him, he wasn’t sure if John could. No, amend that: John could, but Sherlock didn’t want him to. John wasn’t part of the game, didn’t even approve of it. And he shouldn’t suffer for its sake. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have much in the way of a sense of justice, but he knew with complete certainty that John was off limits where his enemies were concerned. And the detective knew beyond all doubt that he would do whatever it took to keep him that way.
Not that it could in any way be compared with Afghanistan. No, thought John. The people at play here are certainly more dangerous.
Sherlock knew it wasn’t wise, but he couldn’t help himself at the moment. He strained his neck as far as he could from Moriarty’s face, then smashed his head hard into the other man’s nose. Moriarty sputtered, blood gushing.
Sherlock groaned. “It’s right in front of your nose! The amount of money spent on research and development is far in excess of what would be expected, especially since hardly any of it is going towards development of new drugs. No, Biopharm is only looking at new types of incubator organs! What does that tell you?”
It would have to be something sarcastic and cutting, otherwise the doctor would be racked by unnecessary guilt. But if he were to do anything outright cruel, John would see it as anger at his own inaction and would feel guilty at that, too. So, the usual manner then. John would be frustrated, would say something emotional, Sherlock would counter with a rational reason why John had no reason to feel guilty, John would sigh and stomp about, and everything would be back to normal by dinnertime. A dinner Sherlock would eat, as there probably wouldn’t be a case on and the lethargy of early starvation was rather distracting.
She looked at him pityingly. “Well, you’d better get used to it. That’s just about normal for him.”  She went to leave, but John stopped her.
The heart monitor, and common sense. His Sherlock needed a doctor, a real doctor, and now. John could help best by being this doctor.
Sherlock was getting slightly concerned. He was still in his little cell, but as to how long he’d been there, Sherlock could no longer say. That, he recalled was one of the withdrawal symptoms for nicotine addiction: time seems to stretch. But the thing that was really concerning the detective was the trembling. That, unlike his pounding headache, was not a symptom of withdrawal from nicotine. It was related to hypoglycemia, which was caused by going too long without food. Sherlock cursed internally. Usually he could go days without eating with no affect but hunger, which was easily ignored, but these affects of low blood sugar, trembling, muscular weakness, and sluggish motion, were always more of a distraction. The detective had no patience for physical needs, putting them second to whatever he found more interesting. And, for the most part, he was able to treat his own body however he saw fit without any negative side effects. But sometimes, things like hypoglycemia would happen, which was eminently frustrating. Under normal case circumstances, this was the point where Sherlock would begrudgingly accept John’s offer of toast before returning to work. But toast wasn’t an option here, so what was normally just an annoyance became an outright problem. It would certainly be more difficult to escape a straightjacket without being noticed when one was taken to shaking uncontrollably every time one attempted even the slightest voluntary movement.
John wasn’t entirely sure what had woken him up. The room’s little second-hand bed wasn’t horribly uncomfortable, and the facility wasn’t inordinately noisy. If anything, the room seemed a bit too quiet.
Sherlock was on the floor, torso in the kitchen but legs insistent on remaining in the living room. He’d been trying to reach his microscope (just because it was unlikely he had the fine motor control to manipulate the dials didn’t mean he couldn’t try). However, there had been a catch at the edge of the rug, and, unable to steady himself, the detective had come tumbling down.
Then, dimly, Sherlock was aware of something on his feet. Or rather, under them. John had lifted Sherlock’s legs, seated himself on the couch (probably with a book, by the sound of it), and replaced said legs on his lap.
At that, the Detective Inspector’s face softened a bit, and John remembered who it was that took on the brilliant addict in the first place.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m perfectly capable of such a menial task as taking care of—Wait, Molly’s off? Why?”
Obviously things aren't that simple. John has to operate on Sherlock without anesthesia, on paper because of Sherlock's drug history but really because anesthetics would corrupt the blood thinner drug Sherlock's body is being used to create. John calls them on this by bringing up his medical knowledge of how there are anesthetics that are not habit-forming, but no one will give him access to any and he is told that if he refuses to operate they will get someone else. Because Sherlock basically has a bag of super potent blood thinner inside him, and if it is damaged he will bleed out and die, John won't trust anyone else to operate. So, yeah. Sherlock is just tied down really extensively and his life depends on his ability not to move while being basically disemboweled and John's ability to not nick the bag. Remarkably, this ends well. Someone makes an offhand comment to John about how impressive it is that he didn't kill Sherlock by accident, as survival rates for carriers of that particular drug are about 20%. John refrains from stabbing them.
It had been nearly twenty-four hours since John had gotten Mycroft’s text, thirty-two since his flatmate had been hit by a cab and summarily abducted, and although their progress since then had been significant they weren’t yet at the point where John could take to the streets looking for his mad friend.
The detective looked down at the offensive yellow puddle, before finally raising his head to meet John’s eyes.
But John was not to be put off. He scooted himself sideways over to his flatmate, earnest if not graceful.
On the screen, Sherlock was attempting to hail a cab, one hand raised, when one of the passing taxis broke away from the traffic and full-out ploughed into the detective, drawing a little shriek from Mrs. Hudson.
John didn’t mind the blanket. He didn’t need it, but the doctor reasoned that if he calmly accepted the blanket, perhaps Sherlock would be a bit less morose about drinking the bottle of pineapple-banana smoothie one of the secret service agents had happened to have on her. And although John completely believed his flatmate when he said the drink was vile, it also had enough salts and sugars to make Sherlock stop shaking.
“Nnnnn.”  That one sounded annoyed, and no wonder. John had a feeling Sherlock could lose a limb and not ask for an increase in pain meds. Not when pain meds were indirectly responsible for his lack of physical control, at least.
Sherlock found himself sitting on a cold metal chair in pitch blackness, with no reference point to figure out where he was, or how he got there. He attempted to stand, but found that his ankles seemed to be tied to the chair’s legs. No—scratch that. A jingling sound when he moved told him that handcuffs were more likely. Someone (someone doubtless working for Moriarty) had cuffed his ankles to the chair legs. Good to know for later—if the chair were to fall over, there was a chance he could get the cuffs off of it. But knocking over the chair wasn’t a good plan, immediately. Not enough information about his situation. Better to wait, observe some more. Observe things like the fact that his arms wouldn’t move. Not that he could see them not moving, or even feel them (whatever was binding him was tight enough to cut off his circulation), but not being able to feel his arms was as good as a letter informing Sherlock that his arms were not currently under his control.
“John!” called Sherlock. Well, it wasn’t a very loud call, but being able to speak was infinitely better than the alternative. As was being able to see, and to walk, although the latter was what had gotten the detective into this predicament.
Sherlock was waiting, eyes closed. The cuffs at his ankles were both undone, and the straightjacket sleeves only appeared restrictive. The detective was certain he could detach the jacket’s straps from behind the chair in seconds, so the only real barrier between himself and the hallway beyond was the (doubtless, locked) door in front of him. So, Sherlock was waiting for Moriarty to make another of his visits.
The door was opened, of course, and Moriarty came in. His walk had changed, as it was wont to do, and so, when he spoke, had his manner.
Today had been an alright day so far, but something seemed to be bothering Sherlock. He hadn’t made a sound for hours, but the detective’s facial expression showed a range from pondering concentration to abject misery. Finally, John had to ask.
He led the limping doctor down a ridiculously modern-looking hallway and to a bank of elevators. To John’s surprise, the interviewer pushed the “down” button.
She smiled at John, sadly, and patted his arm. “I’ll just call in for you, then.” Mrs. Hudson reached for John’s pager.
Actually, John mentally amended, Sherlock would probably take the opportunity of having an ultrasound machine in the flat to try some new experiments on dead things.
Sherlock took a steadying breath and twitched his left shoulder, pressing gently at the stitching of the straightjacket’s right sleeve with his other hand under the cloak of the former motion. His efforts were rewarded as the final line of stitching gave way, and the detective fought down the urge to start clawing at his bonds immediately. Instead, he allowed his torso to fall as far forward as it could over his knees, doing his best to appear exhausted as his ribs twinged painfully. So I’ve been here for a little over two days then, thought Sherlock as he assessed the sensation. It certainly seemed like longer, but that was always the case when one was going through substance withdrawal. But John probably felt like it had been more than two days, and he had no vices more extensive than tea. Well, tea and danger. And caring about people. That would be the one driving John up the wall right about now, the caring about people. The ex-army doctor could never relax when there was someone he felt he should be helping, and he’d definitely feel that way about Sherlock. Feel that way more than he would about most people, if Sherlock was honest with himself. Which he most certainly wouldn’t be. Thinking about John caring about him wouldn’t help John, only escaping would do that. So, back to escaping. With one last hope that John had at least considered shooting the wall to minimize the side effects of caring (he’d find it an effective emotional release, and Sherlock had already drawn the target and everything), the consulting detective snaked his arm down one leg and got to work. That was the only permanent way to make sure John was alright.
The detective still wasn’t looking at him, which was probably why John didn’t back down. He kept watching his friend, determined.
“Technically, this is a kidnapping, so I’m treating it as such. That means that I have more leeway as far as investigation is concerned, and more resources. But it also means that the matter couldn’t stay . . . private.”
The first thing John noticed was that far too many internal organs were visible. The inside of a healthy human body is a net of membranes and fats within which the vital organs are safely nestled. But in this case, such protection had been cut away, sloppily patched to prevent the worst of the bleeding. And there was bleeding. This was to be expected with any abdominal surgery, but that was hardly a comfort. The too-visible internal organs, intestines and the like, looked like aluminium cans that had been kicked once too many, and John noted at least four large burn marks. Only the steady beeping of the heart monitor kept him from shooting the perpetrators then and there.
“Good news, Sherlock Holmes!” Moriarty seemed to enjoy saying his full name, reminding himself exactly whom he had captured.
“Right,” answered the doctor, and he continued to put his clothes in the dresser. But then he perked his head up again, looking towards the strange detective. “Where did you get it?”
Sherlock met his captor’s gaze with a look of ire. Of course John hadn’t given up; he never would. And this particular mind game of withholding food, obviously intended to make Sherlock long for John to stop trying, was utterly pointless. For one, John would never stop trying. And second, how Sherlock felt about the matter had no bearing on anything, as he had no way of communicating his opinions to John. No matter how much he might wish, at this moment, that Dr. John Watson had never even met him, because if John had never met him then John wouldn’t be feeling as guilty as he doubtless was. The knowledge that there was another human being who cared whether Sherlock lived or died was pleasant to have, more pleasant than Sherlock would readily admit, but it still wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth causing that person, causing John, pain. But there was no opportunity to explain this to John now, even if the doctor would listen. Which he wouldn’t, because not caring wasn’t in his nature, so there was no point in the whole hypothetical endeavor in the first place. There were also more useful things to be thinking about.
Moriarty laughed. “Why of course! They couldn’t live, after touching what was mine. So, I arranged some rather nasty accidents. Even for the medical students. Yes, they were forced to do what they did at gunpoint, but they still should have known better. So, I burned them alive,” sang the consulting criminal. Then he grinned again. “That’s what I really came to tell you two. That those mean people were all dead. Consider it a gift.”
“You found this place on your own. Found it,” the detective ran his eyes over John once more, “and led a team here.” Then Sherlock looked up at John’s face, a rare honest smile on his features. “Brilliant.”
Even if the detective had been clairvoyant, he probably wouldn’t have heard John’s plea. Just staying conscious had become enough of a battle to effectively keep Sherlock distracted, although he could dimly appreciate that at least he wasn’t bored. His headache had increased to skull-splitting proportions, and he felt slightly dizzy. It was impossible to say how long he’d been in the little room, although it seemed an eternity. Still, as far as escape was concerned, progress had been made.
“Alright,” said John, swallowing his surprise at the breadth of information Mycroft had at his disposal. “We’ll be needing more computers if we’re going to sort all of this. Mrs. Hudson, do you have a computer downstairs?” She nodded, and John continued on. “So then you should go turn it on and see if you can track the ambulance. Detective Inspector, you find out who hired the ambulance. I’ll look through the records for anything unusual there.”
“Second,” Sherlock cut in. “You enlisted in the military, which speaks to a willingness to break social codes of conduct in attaining an end. If the end were important enough to you, would you do so here?”
Sherlock recoiled slightly at that last statement, a physical reaction Moriarty picked up in an instant. He swooped around the back of Sherlock’s chair, hands digging into the detective’s shoulders and face just centimeters from his right ear.
“No need, I’m not interested. If you want to know something about Mr. Holmes, you should ask him yourself.”
“No,” said John. “I can’t. I won’t hurt people like her, even if they don’t think they mind. I’m a doctor, and I made an oath to do no harm.”
John wasn’t scared. In an emergency, he never felt anything but calm. It was an excellent quality for a doctor, a soldier, and anyone who had an emotional attachment to Sherlock Holmes. So when he looked down into his friend’s very person, John’s reactions were clinical. Which was a good thing because, if he’d made room for emotion, there wouldn't have been room for anything else.
Anthea looked up then, catching John’s stare and holding it. “Whoever has your friend has found a way to keep Mycroft from finding him. But my employer has a high opinion of your abilities, so he sent me to assist you here.” Anthea looked as close to upset as John had ever seen her. It couldn’t have been easy for Mycroft to give up her help, or for her to leave him to sort out whatever international affairs on his own. And now, everyone was relying on John to see that the sacrifice was worth it.
“Of course not,” the criminal snapped. “That would be entirely unnecessary.” Then, Moriarty’s voice became low and conspiratorial. “Pets are known for their loyalty, after all. And besides,” he continued, “there’s always the offchance that someone might figure out something helpful from one of my messages. A very small chance, in the case of your colleagues, but a larger one with regards to whatever member of government you have in your pocket.” Moriarty’s manner peaked again, his voice filled with unholy glee. “You didn’t know I knew? Oh don’t be silly, detective. I know you’ve had help. But you won’t be getting any now. I’ve made sure of it.”
By the time John got to the back of Sherlock’s right knee, he’d entered a sort of Zen state. The doctor was so far lost in his own head, he nearly missed the sparkle aimed his way from the head of the tub. But a light caught his eye, and John looked up to see Sherlock, his light eyes open, alert, and shining.
The criminal had come twice in two days, and it was the third day now (as an entirely uncomfortable jab to his ribs showed him), so it was not unreasonable to assume the madman would be back today. So all there was to do now was wait. Sherlock entertained himself by assessing what he’d say to John when he got back.
“It’s nothing.” Sherlock’s confusion was edged with a bit of panic. “Happens, sometimes. Stops eventually.”
Ignoring him, John went on. “I’m sorry, but a patient asked me to speak to you about a, well, a potentially . . .” John looked around him, suddenly feeling a bit ridiculous. Did he really believe such a far-fetched story, and from a person whose sanity is already in question?
He didn’t doubt that he’d be able to undo the cuffs with one hand, even if it was shaking, or that he could completely free the hand in question without drawing attention to himself. The trouble was his ribs.
Sherlock felt the concussive force of the blast from the kitchen, and it took him a fraction of a second to get from “Why is my microscope shaking?” to “JohnJohnJohnNoMustFindJohn!”  By which time, he had already shot off his stool and tripped half way down the now-half-decimated staircase to 221’s former front hall.
“You don’t like thinking about that, do you? Yes, your Johnny-boy will cry to his psychiatrist for a few weeks, perhaps, but he will get over it. He will realize that he’s better off with a normal life anyway, and he will get over you. And then you’ll be alone again.” Moriarty was speaking in sing-song. “Alone with no one to even think about you.”
“See?”  John said softly. “My pulse means that I’m here. And as long as I’m here, I’ve got you, and you’re safe, and everything is going to be fine.”
It was already dark by the time John got home. He’d been out at the surgery all day, followed by a trip to the grocery store and a stop at an ATM before finally returning home to 221B Baker Street. He’d known immediately that Sherlock wasn’t home, but that was hardly unusual. John knew that his flatmate wasn’t off solving a case, because Sherlock would have texted him about that—probably. Unless he’d left his phone at home, or forgotten to charge it, or had forgotten that he hadn’t texted, or had simply been unable to take the time to do so. But still, Sherlock usually managed to text, if only to have someone there to say “Brilliant” when he finally deduced whatever undoubtedly brilliant solution would solve the matter at hand. No, it was more likely Sherlock was off at the mortuary again, collecting body parts like some modern-age Dr. Frankenstein for his somewhat disturbing experiments.
Then, the detective allowed his eyes to close as John continued to methodically check him for injuries, only a slight blush on the smaller man’s features.
John, a bit dumbstruck by the room’s dark-haired occupant, didn’t move a muscle. The man, probably the one the nurse had been complaining about, was certainly a striking character. Everything from his height to his skin tone to his hair cut was unusual, and most unusual of all was that he was somehow able to appear in control and impressive while wearing nothing but a hospital gown. Doctor Watson had spent enough time in hospitals to know that no one—absolutely no one—could look dignified wearing that generic cheap polyester. Except for this person, it seemed.
“Of course she was helping you. You were in charge of this whole operation, that much was obvious from the angle of your shoulders as you ran down the hall.”  He caught John’s eye, recognizing the need for elaboration.
“Sorry about the taxi,” the sing-song voice went on, not sounding sorry in the least. “We had to get you here, and alone, for all of this to work.”
The doctor opened his mouth to respond, wrongfooted, when Sherlock cut him off again. “Never mind, not important. A doctor, with a strong moral principle, taste for adrenaline, and no aversions to following orders, has just fallen into my lap! It’s Christmas! The game is On, Dr. Watson!” The enigmatic patient was now pacing the room, practically manic with excitement.
“Five days, John. Hardly a week.”  His usual nonchalant nature was belied by the hypoglycemic shakes wracking the pale man’s figure. John wished he had thought to bring along some orange juice.
The doctor shook his head, trying not to think about the three children Moriarty had just admitted to killing. “Leave,” spat John. “Now.”
Seconds after the clip began, a figure walked into the frame. John recognized his flatmate instantly; the distinctive dark halo of curls and dramatic long coat all he needed to identify the world’s only consulting detective, although the large bag of human body parts did lend credence to the theory. Mrs. Hudson gave an admonishing click of the tongue, and started saying something about how Sherlock might just give knitting a try if he needed a hobby so badly, before John shushed her. His flatmate, his friend, was in danger. Good Tenant John couldn’t help him, so Soldier John was in charge.
John took a second to catch his breath before panting, “I was . . . looking for you . . . Woke up, you were gone.”
John spoke up, turning down the volume on the police scanner as he did so. “What you’re saying is, someone is trying to run the police ragged so they can’t help find Sherlock?”  His mouth went dry as he was speaking.
John smiled, but didn’t let it reach his eyes. “Thanks for the advice, then. I suppose I’ll just be going . . .” He left the room more confused than he’d been going in. He’d gotten some confirmation that Sherlock Holmes wasn’t insane, at least, but John wasn’t sure what to do with the other information he’d received. The doctor had met a lot of questionable characters in the army, and Sherlock hadn’t fit the profile of a sadist. If anything, the man seemed, for lack of a better word, misunderstood. John was surprised at how protective he already felt of the strange IP, but his instincts had served him well in the past and he wasn’t about to start ignoring them now.
The man with the umbrella laughed. “Come come now, Doctor. You hardly need to keep Sherlock Holmes’ secrets from me.”
For the first time since he’d gotten Mycroft’s text message, John realized that, if Sherlock was going to be found, it was only John who’d be able to find him. Mycroft couldn’t help, and Lestrade wouldn’t have the resources until it would almost certainly be too late. So, it was up to John. And John wasn’t about to let his best friend in the world down.
John pressed on. “And for what else? You can’t expect me to be of any help if you don’t tell me what the plan is.” The doctor went to scan the room for cameras before stopping himself.
With the simple touch of legs to feet, John was leaning against the outside of Sherlock’s box, making a patch of warmth for him to curl around or shun as he saw fit. A little action that spoke of someone waiting, someone who was with him in spirit now, and would be with him in truth when this spell passed. Someone who would be standing there to catch him as he staggered out of this personal hell, possibly with tea. And while Sherlock doubted it would make his stay in the box any shorter, it made it slightly more bearable.
Anthea still didn’t look up, but her expression changed slightly and, when she spoke, her voice was softer than usual. “Because he’s being blocked. Mr. Holmes was handling some negotiations abroad when half the diplomatic issues he’s been keeping an eye all blew up at once, all unexpectedly. There didn’t seem to be any connection between the cases, except that he was involved. So, he deduced that it all must be some way of trying to distract him from something else. After checking on a number of other possibilities, he had me try to locate Sherlock on the CCTV. I, of course, found the footage you saw before. But it’s all my employer can do, at the moment, to keep half the political stage from imploding. There simply isn’t time to look into a missing person, whoever that person might be.”
“Please don’t interpret my concern as anything sinister, Dr. Watson. I’m merely looking out for Sherlock’s best interests. To that end, I’d like you to do something for me.”
“Actually, no I don’t. When I was notified that I was being subcontracted out by the army in lieu of a discharge, I was rather surprised. I don’t see why your company thought I’d be an asset.”
Wilkes leaned over the table, and said in a conspiratorial whisper, “Well, Dr. Watson, you certainly want us. Your psychological profile says you don’t do well when you feel useless, and going back to Afghanistan certainly isn’t an option.”
“Shhhh . . . don’t worry. Everything is going to be fine. I’ve got you. It’s John, and I’ve got you. I promise.”
“Then if the person can’t keep you safe, and they know it, they’re telling you that whatever happens, they’ll be right there with you. That you won’t be alone, even if it looks like you are.”
“Phase One is looking for you, Phase Two is giving up, and Phase Three is forgetting that you’d ever existed.”
John realized exactly how odd that phrase would have sounded to him a few months ago, but still he pressed on. “And at eleven-twenty-two, I received confirmation from a reliable source that Sherlock had been kidnapped.”
They stayed like that for hours, until it was almost certainly too dark for John to read. And yet he stayed, well into the night, loath to leave Sherlock alone when his mind had so obviously turned against him. But finally, when the doctor was almost certain his detective had fallen into sleep, John carefully levered himself out from under the detective’s legs and stood. This was followed by a soft groan, as he stretched after so long in one position, and then an even softer one, as his semi-comatose detective apparently noticed his absence.
Wilkes put an entirely unwanted hand on John’s arm. “So, you don’t want to do implantation support. So fine! Most of our doctors don’t do that anyway. Stamford in there, he just does supportive care—keeping the IPs as healthy as possible until their surgeries, when the synthetic organs are removed and they go back to the outside. You can even do the surgeries if you’d like.”
“Well, you’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?” asked John. The past few months of dealing with the criminal classes, and Sherlock’s brother (where was Mycroft?), had eradicated whatever fear response the doctor hadn’t lost in Afghanistan. Now, he was just angry.
John’s detective didn’t respond other than to curl even further in on himself, twisting his face away from the doctor.
John was getting annoyed with Sherlock’s tone. “So, they’re looking into making more specialized incubator organs.”
“Alright,” replied John, feeling like he’d bitten off a bit more than he could chew, and not minding half as much as one would expect.
“So, someone else is really running the company?”  John thought he was catching on, but didn’t want to be too sure yet.
Pulled out of his anxious reverie, the detective settled back down next to his blogger. They sat like that for a moment, listening to the sirens as first-responders arrived to dig them out, when John broke the silence.
Sherlock was turned to him with a somewhat accusatory air, clearly bothered by his absence, so John wordlessly handed the clean garments to his detective. After running his hands over the set for a few seconds, a light of recognition seemed to go on, and the consulting detective lay the pyjamas aside. John wouldn’t have been surprised if Sherlock could tell him their age, make, and even color from the quick textural perusal.
“You don’t look well at all. A meal would probably help, but your Dr. Watson is still being far too persistent for my tastes.
Sitting quietly on the edge of a bed with a gun in his hand gave the doctor an uncomfortable sense of deja vu. All in all, it was far too similar to those first miserable weeks in the bedsit, before he'd ever met Sherlock. John had been alone then, too.
The detective gave a little shrug, which John knew to mean that he would very much like to be clean, but didn’t want to ask. Didn’t want John to have to fill yet another need for him, didn’t want John to see him as weak in yet another way. The doctor was long used to such attitudes from patients, but it still hurt to see it in his Sherlock. John would do anything for his detective, and hardly resented an opportunity to show the affection he couldn’t always voice. And what better way to prove this to Sherlock than to go above and beyond the call?
“Yes,” came the soft answer, and John responded by helping Sherlock into a standing position. The detective seemed far too tired for someone who had spent the majority of the day curled up on a couch, but his black moods always left him drained.
When Moriarty made his move, it was Lestrade who noticed it first. Or rather Lestrade’s police scanner, which veritably went insane. John wouldn’t have been surprised if the sheer quantity of angry and panicked voices coming through the machine caused the little black box to vibrate off the table. It sounded like every car in London was calling for support at once.
John Watson. Ever the gentleman. Although Saint was more like it, really. True, Lestrade didn’t have quite as strong a dislike for Holmes as most people seemed to, but Dr. Watson actually had to live with the man. If there was a heaven, Lestrade couldn’t think of a better way to qualify for admission.
They spent several minutes like this, John waiting for any indication that Sherlock had, well, completed. But after five, and then ten minutes, nothing had happened. John’s knees had started to hurt by this point, so he half-straightened, looking behind Sherlock to check the toilet bowl. Still nothing, but as he went to kneel back down, he realized that his detective was shaking. Sherlock’s face was pinched, and there were even tear tracks down his cheeks.
But now, John. He wasn’t trying to speak to Sherlock, or to otherwise distract him or force him from his prison. But at the same time, the doctor wasn’t leaving him alone to face his demons. John, as always, had found a third option.
Testing the phenomenon, John turned and walked back towards the phone she’d tried to answer. As he got close enough to reach, it started to ring again. This time, Dr. Watson picked up.
So, the detective was alone, and he was bored. He’d already figured out the dimensions of his cell (four meters by six), his placement in it (roughly central), and its components (entirely concrete, run through with a steel frame, and fluorescent light fixtures in the ceiling). His eyes were certainly accustomed to the lack of light by now (he’d been there for at least eight hours, and conscious for two of them), but he couldn’t see much if only for a lack of visual stimuli. Currently, the only objects that broke up his field of vision were his own knees and shoulders, although he could see a set of speakers behind him if he craned his neck back far enough. Sherlock was also aware of a small black box mounted above the door in front of him, and imagined it must be a security camera. Chances were that it wasn’t the only one in the room; he’d have made sure to install at least three if the tables were turned.
Sherlock opened his eyes and waited for the painfully bright blur to resolve itself into shapes. It seemed that Moriarty had put on a more serious, less flamboyant persona for this particular visit, and this one exuded not glee, but power. The detective was reminded strongly of Mycroft.
Initially, the bait and switch goes well. John puts a very mind-palace-y Sherlock in a supply closet along with the vital memory stick full of data, and leaves him his gun despite knowing that there's no way Sherlock could fire it effectively (still dizzy, post-operative, etc). John just can't bring himself to leave him defenseless. Then, John goes ahead with the plan of reporting to his supervisor and pretending he has no idea where Sherlock went. However, everyone is suddenly making a much bigger deal about Sherlock's disappearance than John expected, and it's because the little specimen jar holding the bag of blood thinner John took from Sherlock's abdomen is missing, too. Yes, Sherlock managed to palm it while being mostly out of his mind. He probably would not have done so had he been in possession of more of his mind, but in his current mental state he felt he had a right to keep it. Maybe for an experiment.
Just then, Anderson gave a little shriek as the petri dish he’d been snooping around burst into flame.
“Three,” replied the madman conversationally. Moriarty seemed pleased that his audience was actively engaging him.
The detective looked confused. “I’ll give you proper instructions when the time comes. All you’ll need to do to be an effective assistant is to carry them out.”
“Don’t worry,” John whispered, moving even closer to his love’s head and holding his hand even tighter, fingers drawn to that reassuring pulse. “I’ve got you, and it’s all going to be fine.”
John held the back of Sherlock’s hand to his own forehead. Unprecedented. It was a good word to describe everything about the consulting detective, as well as everything about John’s own life since meeting him. Unprecedented to be the flatmate of someone so strange and amazing. Unprecedented to grow closer to him, in spite of it all, than you’d been to anyone else ever. Unprecedented for him to ask if you loved him, unprecedented to answer honestly, and most unprecedented of all for him to respond in the way he had. For him to look down so nervous and tell you that he knew he wasn’t good at this, but that it made him glad that you loved him, and that he didn’t respond like other people but that if he did, his response would be that he loved you back.
“Stop looking at me that way, Dr. Watson,” chided Mrs. Hudson gently. “I’ve already told you, I’m not leaving.” She stood up to pour everyone some more tea.
Sherlock waived aside his concern. “Of course not, John. This place is a front, one factory where they’re doing what they say they’re doing to show the public. The side research they do here is to fit other people as weapons, probably people in other countries. That’s where Elihu comes in, he had loads of accounts and contacts overseas, especially in war-torn countries with little regulation. He probably arranged for some of his friends to run the smuggling components of their organizations with and through Biopharm, with the stipulation that they financially take care of his son’s empire while the stupid boy twiddles his thumbs. You see, there isn’t a shadow leader of Biopharm, it was all set up ahead of time and is just running like an old clock. Take out the gears, and it will stop with no one to repair it.””
The detective made a disgusted face, then, with a fair bit of effort, propelled himself off the chair and into the television set, then to the kitchen door. “I suppose I’ll just continue the fingerprint experiment, then. Could prove crucial to this case. You didn’t throw away my set of fingers, did you?”
The few belongings John hadn’t put in storage were now in the mid-sized box on his lap: several sets of clothes, a laptop computer and charger, his phone charger, a mug, some family photos, a small electric kettle, and one very-illegal firearm. John still wasn’t sure why he’d kept the gun. It wasn’t that he’d had an overwhelming desire to keep it, so much as it just didn’t seem worth the trouble to return the thing. And if keeping the gun led to some sort of difficulty, he couldn’t bring himself to care.
But by the time John was back in the apartment, the scrap of paper open in one hand and his other resting on the map-covered kitchen table, he allowed himself a small smile. Not long to wait now.
John looked up, suspicious and angry. “Your doctors—are they all like me? Subcontracted against their will?”
John pressed his forehead against the side of Sherlock's face in affectionate response, and the last thing the detective heard that night was, "I missed you, and I'm glad you're back."
Next, Sherlock tried to remember how he’d gotten into this situation. The last clear memory he had was of waiting for a taxi on the way back from the mortuary. None of them were stopping; taxi drivers seemed to have an extreme bias against passengers holding clear plastic garbage bags full of frozen human feet. He had just decided to walk home when one cab started to pull over. The problem was that it didn’t slow down as it reached him, and the next thing he was aware of was losing consciousness flat on his back on the pavement with the wind knocked out of him, surrounded by ice and feet. The pain in his ribs would certainly bear out the story that he’d been hit by a cab. Vaguely, he wondered what the feet had come to.
An hour later, both inhabitants of 221B were sitting on the back of a parked ambulance, both inexplicably wearing orange shock blankets and watching the completely unnecessary number of secret service people with guns currently swarming around the abandoned building in which Sherlock had been held.
John sat on the edge of the bed they shared, looking down at Sherlock. Aside from the heart monitor, one could almost believe that he’d simply caught his detective in a rare moment of sleep. John grinned to himself—like that would ever happen. The only times Sherlock slept were when he and John were together. This was quite possibly because, without John’s regular patterns of eating and sleeping to remind him, Sherlock simply forgot that bodies need maintenance. Two months ago, when they’d been on a train home from an out-of-town case (“The Misplaced Mare,” in John’s blog), the doctor had been forced to verbally inform the mad detective that he was tired and should sleep. Sherlock had argued, but John had made the case that the violin and experiments were at the flat and the train didn’t have internet, so sleeping now would not be any more boring than whatever else he could be doing. Sherlock had looked pleased, then proud, and told John that he’d made an excellent point. The detective then proceeded to wrap himself slightly tighter in his coat before falling asleep almost immediately, looking like a delicately balanced statue as he bobbed with the motion of the train. At the time, John had wanted to move to the seat beside his detective, to hold him and keep him steady while he slept, but the doctor had held himself back. The last thing he wanted to do was alienate the most important person in his world. John desperately wished that the change in the nature of their relationship had occurred sooner, that he might have had such a memory to visit now.
With one arm around his detective’s waist, John walked them both to bed. He hated that there was nothing much he could do to help when Sherlock’s moods took him, but the face pressed against the top of his head as they walked, and the heartbreaking smile when he settled them both under the covers, told the doctor that the little he’d done just might have been enough.
“Oh, I didn’t want us to be interrupted,” said Moriarty, responding to John’s thoughts instead of his words. “Unless you don’t do what I say. In which case, I’ll be sure there are lots of innocent little bystanders to get blown to pieces by this,” he indicated his explosive vest. “By the way, isn’t it gorgeous? Black is really my color.”
“What did you do, exactly?” Lestrade might want the girl’s full story, but John was only concerned with a very specific piece of it. The young student skipped ahead, eager to oblige.
Sherlock smiled, seemingly pleased with John’s enthusiasm. “Anything. Government secrets, flashdrives of missile codes, small weapons, bombs, illegal drugs, antique jewelry, whatever can be reasonably fit into a human.”
Moriarty positively giggled. “No questions, not this early. I’ll leave you to puzzle it around in that brain you’re so proud of.” Then, he paused.  “I doubt you’ll figure it out, but you won’t be able to keep yourself from trying. Don’t worry though—I’ll tell you soon enough!”
It really wasn’t as amusing a thought as it seemed, and the detective knew that he was becoming rather desperate. But he wouldn’t try to rush, couldn’t afford to make a mistake and let Moriarty, or whatever henchman he had watching his monitors, see what Sherlock was up to. How many criminals had panicked under the pressure of doing virtually nothing, and been summarily caught? Sherlock knew John wouldn’t agree with the comparison, but that couldn’t be helped. Capture was capture, and deception was deception, and he’d be a fool to ignore the very mistakes he exploited on the other side of this equation. Moriarty would have more trouble trying to keep this spider in check.
Moriarty pouted. “Why, to visit Sherly, of course. I heard he wasn’t feeling well,” he added in a conspiratorial whisper.
Dr. Watson had mostly finished by the time the ambulance finally found them, of course, and the doctors in the hospital decided that he’d done too good a job to justify operating a second time. No one in that hospital, or any other, probably, had dealt with a case even remotely similar to this, but the detective was stable and appeared to be doing well. Lestrade wished he could say the same for Dr. Watson.
Seeming to read John’s mind (for the umpteenth time in the last fifteen minutes), Sherlock said, “And if you want to be sure I’m telling the truth, speak to Dr. Sally Donovan. She was the initial government plant. You’ll find her in the staff lounge at this time of day, but knock. Anderson’ll be in there, too, and no one wants to see that. Fourth door on the left, just past the bathroom.” With that, he turned back to the violin and continued to play, seemingly unaware that John was still in the room.
“Hey,” John whispered as he leaned in, putting a grounding hand on the detective’s back. “It’s alright. We’ve got nowhere to be.”
As John wondered on his new situation, the third shocking circumstance came about. Dr. (or, as John now thought of him, Somewhat Sleazy Doctor of Business) Wilkes had all but run from the room to get the necessary forms for John’s employment, leaving John alone with Sherlock, who hadn’t waited more than half a breath before zeroing in on the doctor, a look in his eyes speaking of hardly restrained excitement.
“So you don’t like my idea,” Moriarty coughed, the light of triumph in his eyes in spite of the blood dripping from his chin. “Too bad. You don’t really have a choice in the matter. John will forget you, whether you want to believe it or not.” He moved to flounce from the room, turning only as he reached the doorway.
John gave Sherlock a look as if he were the dull one, and then, breaking into a small smile, the doctor gave the detective’s chest a pointed look and said, “Not burned.”
“You do know breaking into laboratories isn’t exactly conducive to keeping a low profile?” asked John conversationally as they reentered their room.
But he hadn’t gone more than a few meters before the consulting detective heard running footsteps coming down the hall towards him. Sherlock readied himself for a confrontation. He might be weaponless, and not in top physical form at the moment, but the running figure was probably unaware of his presence, and that counted for something. He analyzed the sound of steps down the hallway. Male, small, controlled pace. Probably trained to run for long periods of time, like an athlete or a soldier . . . Wait!
But difficulty didn’t seem to be something John would find himself short of any time soon. One day a soldier, next day accomplice to some sort of government-hired private detective. “Consulting Detective,” Sherlock had called himself.
John knew that even if Sherlock was awake beneath his eyelids, the detective would be so out of his skull on pain meds that he probably wouldn’t be able to understand the words. And his detective wasn’t the sort to respond to just a calming tone of voice.
“Excellent decision, Dr. Watson.”  The man on the screen stood mostly in shadow, in what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse, but John could make out a black umbrella in his right hand.
Within the first week, things fell into a sort of pattern. John would wake up early and make himself a cup of tea while browsing on his laptop. An hour or so later, a technician would come in bearing breakfast and whatever vitamins and immune boosters Sherlock was due to be given that day. John would remove his own food and put the rest in the room’s miniature refrigerator, then retreat to the staff lounge. There he’d spend a few hours chatting with whatever doctors and, occasionally, administrators who weren’t busy, keeping an ear out for anything that seemed important. Sometimes he’d wander the hallways, idly exploring. This was all easier to do without his cane—John hadn’t even noticed it until the next day, but when he’d gone looking for Sherlock in the middle of the night, he’d apparently been in such a hurry he forgot the thing. And waking up to see the hated crutch still where he’d left it before the little adventure had been a powerful case to the doctor’s subconscious that he hadn’t needed it in the first place.
John wasn’t quite sure that statement was accurate, as he’d personally been looking forward to being let in on his IP’s mission. But he remained silent on the point, choosing instead to wait for whatever Sherlock chose to share with him.
Sherlock was thankfully unconscious, secured to a perfectly clean metal operating table that looked quite out of place in the abandoned factory the group in question had been using for its base. Monitors beeped and the floor was littered with animal bones and spent sutures, and three young people in full surgical attire were crowded against the wall behind the whole arrangement, eyes darting as they made futile attempts to hide their bloody gloves.
John certainly wanted to know as much as he could. Since he was apparently part of a scheme that would involve another human’s life in his hands, he wanted to be sure he went into it with as much information as possible. Even still, the doctor skimmed the sections on employee benefits and the code of conduct, skipping straight to the parts pertaining to medical treatment.
They stepped out of the elevator and into another brushed-steel hallway. Wilkes led John to one of the thick metal doors, looked briefly through the reinforced-glass window inset, and walked into the room.
The Consulting Detective frowned slightly, a micropipette frozen in midair. “That still doesn’t explain why you’re here.”
Dr. Watson shook his head as he accepted back his phone, and was about to respond to Dr. Wilkes’ frantic glances towards the door when the man with the violin cut in again.
At about two in the afternoon, another technician would arrive, wheeling in a cart. Sherlock would extend a bored arm and, a few vials of blood lighter, take it back. Since he wasn’t yet in the final three months of treatment, he wasn’t being given any shots yet. John knew from Mike Stamford, with whom he’d become friends, that things would get worse when the shots started. Molly was further along than Sherlock, and Mike was spending less and less time away from her room. The shy IP was only a few weeks away from removal surgery, and she was displaying all the symptoms of stomach flu. Mike assured John that she’d be fine, that it was a very common side effect of producing the neurological drugs Molly was assigned, but John was still worried. And even if Mike’s IP was only bothered physically by what she was going through, that would hardly be the case with Sherlock.
The Detective Inspector gave a doubtful, apologetic shrug. “I’d do it, of course, but getting clearance for something like that takes time. Weeks, sometimes.”
John turned to Anthea, who shook her head. “Busy,” she responded to his unasked question as she continued to type. He didn’t push the matter, as it was about as useless to argue with her, he’d found, as it was to argue with her employer.
John grabbed the device in question from an endtable and turned it on, gritting his teeth at the delay, while Mrs. Hudson and DI Lestrade attempted to acquaint themselves with their new companion. The landlady’s offer of tea was met with a mild “Thanks,” and so Mrs. Hudson set about to find a clean mug, chatting all the while about not actually being John and Sherlock’s housekeeper, while Lestrade tried in vain to catch the young executive assistant’s eye.
“You’ll be living in here, of course. All the personal physicians live with their IPs, protocol you know. Now, you said no to implantation support. What about removal surgery?”
“Mycroft’s PA is on her way back to her employer at this point. After she called in the backup, there was no reason for her to stay.” Sherlock still somehow managed to look dignified while drinking neon yellow pineapple juice.
Slightly alarmed, John stood up and flicked on the room light. But no, there was still no one there. The doctor went to the door of the room and leaned out, as there was always a chance his IP had just gone to the bathroom or something. But the hall was empty, too. John made a decision, put on a jumper over his pyjamas, shoved the gun (which had been stashed in his underwear drawer, thank you very much) into his waistband, and set off down the hall.
And so, giggling like lunatics, the two strangest people in the building climbed up into the basement to go to sleep as the sun was coming up.
The detective made a slightly more exaggerated twitch of one shoulder. Feigning muscular spasms wasn’t too difficult, as lack of food, water, and sleep, in addition to nicotine patches, had left Sherlock in a questionable physical state as it was. If John could see him, Sherlock knew he’d have that brow-wrinkled concerned look right about now. Chances are he had it anyway, wherever he was. John was a very loyal person, and could not be comfortable if he knew his friend was in any sort of danger.
Now, John was sitting in the hospital room holding his best friend’s hand with two fingers absently on the pulsepoint, only half-aware of the outside world. He’d listened to the doctors, of course, but they couldn’t tell him much more than he knew already. Stable, and no indicators of brain damage, but it was a case with no precedent so the outcome was unclear.
Anderson straightened, horrified. “That would be a waste of police resources! Legally, there isn’t even a missing person yet!”
All together, they were making progress. John had managed to black out entire areas of London where they were sure Sherlock wasn’t, as well as tentatively deciding that he was most probably still somewhere in the city. Although he couldn’t be completely certain about this, Anthea assured him that the comings and goings of London were of particular interest to Mycroft. Somehow, this was reassuring. But then another message from Anthea highlighted most likely spots for holding a hostage, and that undoubtedly useful data was information John didn’t want to wonder why Mycroft possessed.
