Belatedly, Cas realizes Dean is waiting for him to offer a place to sit; this is his room after all. He takes a seat at the edge of the bed, gesturing for Dean to take the chair near the desk. Dean swings it out and pulls it toward him, and suddenly they’re sitting so close their knees are almost touching. Cas can just about feel the warmth radiating off of him.
It’s just that Cas had hoped he’d felt some of the same... traces, of something between them, that he had. Something wonderful in the middle of this confusing and bloody episode in their lives. Something that would make Dean want to seek him out in the aftermath, rather than run away.
“Hey buddy,” Dean says before she has the chance. She bites down a smirk — some things never change.
A knock at the door makes Cas jump, realizing suddenly just how silent the room was. No wonder that ticking was getting on his nerves.
“Cool beans.” She does a quick scan of the room. “Where’s Cas? I was gonna ask him what he wants on his pizza. Sam’s almost ready to put them all in the oven.”
Dean chuckles a bit at that, letting go of the last shreds of self consciousness he was still clinging to despite everything.
“Don’t worry Dean, I’m sure Charlie will protect your heart-attack pizza from the aromatic herbs I harvested for our family with my own two hands,” Cas deadpans.
Charlie sniffles, and Dean releases her hands so she can swipe at her cheeks. “Sorry dude, I’m just — ‘silly’ is the last word that’s coming to mind right now.”
“Yeah, I guess I didn’t really think it was silly either.” He clears his throat — seeing Charlie cry has him on the verge now himself. “So, yeah. Glad you’re doing good, ‘cause I was a little freaked. And I’m serious about looking into the whole TV show thing, because you’re right - it’s uncanny. I actually said out loud that I think I might be kinda gay, which... is definitely true, but. Not how I normally would have phrased it.”
“About what I felt — what I wanted, when I didn’t know who I was. I realized it’s not just something some other, better me could want.”
Crossing the room to answer, he wonders what Sam or Charlie might want at this hour, somewhat guiltily hoping it’s Charlie here to propose a Netflix marathon of some kind, it has been a while since they’ve spent quality time together —
“Do you want to?” she prompts quietly, and something about how carefully she asks, not wanting to push him more than he can handle — he feels a rush of bravery.
Dean feels his eyes bug in surprise, quickly trying to school his expression. “What did you just say?” There’s no way she could have heard him, Dean was certain he was alone when he’d made THAT particular remark.
“I...” Cas starts and realizes his voice is hoarse, thick with emotion and the last 10 minutes or so of disuse. He clears his throat and tries again. “I think I understand, Dean. But maybe... you can tell me, about some of the things you felt. What is was you wanted.”
For a moment the room is silent again, save for the ticking of the clock. Cas finds he doesn’t mind it so much right now, as it counts the seconds he’s sharing with Dean.
Cas watches Dean’s face, starting to really remark upon how... light he seems. Despite the earlier tension, only just now starting to dissipate, Dean seems... unburdened, in a way.
He looks back up from where he’d started to stare at his hands, and now Charlie looks ready to cry. She reaches and he accepts as she squeezes his hand. Smiles again, watery. Dean pushes on, grounded by the contact.
“Don’t deserve many kudos, I’ve barely even copped to anything yet,” he flexes his hands, closes them into fists. Wishes faintly he’d grabbed a beer before starting this conversation.
She and Sam spent that morning poking around the library, unsure exactly where to even begin research into such a tenuous connection, until Sam started to wonder aloud where Dean was—apparently he hadn’t answered his texts, and he’d usually turned up by this time of morning for his caffeine fix.
It’s been one week since Dean confided in Charlie over the kitchen table, before disappearing into the bunker in search of Cas. The next morning over coffee in the library, she filled Sam in on the possible weird connection between her favorite show and the latest hunt, leaving out Dean’s contribution to the list of coincidences.
He must have gotten it right, because Dean’s eyes crinkle as he replies, “Yeah, ah, you’re not wrong.” Dean’s arms swing at his sides for a moment as he casts his eyes around the room. If he notices how sparsely it’s kept, he graciously doesn’t mention it.
Charlie’s eyebrows raise marginally, but she’s smiling. “Nah you’re good dude. We’re friends.” Dean can’t help but smile at that. “I guess I was lucky, I was pretty young, like, 15. I met someone who helped me figure it out. It was the first time I ever wanted to kiss anybody.” She looks wistful for a moment, remembering. “I had a… rough time. Y’know, as a kid. Never had many friends, or stayed in one place for very long.” Dean’s breath catches. “So when she - Maddie - actually gave a shit, wanted to stick around me, listen to my stupid jokes... plus she had these freckles like you wouldn’t believe.” She huffs a small laugh - still wistful. “And it was like... a curtain fell. When she kissed me, I remember thinking, ‘this is what’s right.’ Hm.” She’s smiling, but Dean feels like he could break apart. He can tell she’s allowing him a moment to chime in. He can’t.
“Aww, c’mon baby don’t be like that,” Dean cajoles, tugging Cas by the hand closer to the couch with a good-natured smirk. “Hey, I’ll make us pesto this week, maybe add some of the sage you’ve got coming in,” he adds, quieter, and — okay, Charlie is seriously so happy for them, but she’s ready to give them some space now.
He hummed, taking a long sip of his coffee. Cas then looked back at Dean, ocean eyes sending chills down his spine. “I’m glad I caught you on a bad day. We might not have met otherwise.”
Castiel looked over at Gabriel pleadingly, who responded by shrugging. “No way I’m getting involved in this!”
Dean pressed the sticky note onto the back of Castiel’s laptop as Gabriel entered the room. He grinned mischievously, handing the bottle of hot sauce to Dean as if it were a bomb.
The way Castiel laughed.... it was from deep within him. Dean wondered how long it had been since Castiel had last laughed this hard.
A nervous laugh escapes Sam’s lips. “Slow down there, Romeo. Shouldn’t you ask him out on a date first, or something?”
Castiel stood a few feet from the bed, hand resting on the desk. He looked exhausted, his movements sluggish and body covered in sweat. “Can we do it one more time?”
Castiel smiled at the thought of Sam and Gabriel waking up in twenty years and arguing over who stole the blankets.
He decided to focus on Castiel’s belongings. On the table was a still-open laptop, a pen, and sticky notes.
He arrived back to his room late at night. He had dragged Sam and Charlie, along with other drunk wedding guests, back to their individual rooms. Then he had to find Gabriel and bring him back home. That took another two hours.
The woman sighed, walking over to the counter and sitting on a stool. “I don’t know if you remember me, but I came in here once with Cassie. The name’s Meg.”
It took an hour to get back to his apartment, and the two got out of the car. Castiel had snapped out of his shock, embarrassment and anger replacing the numb.
Dean rushed out of bed twenty minutes before his alarm went off. He had to win this war... ‘Coffee War,’ was it? Yeah, that’s what Gabriel had called it.
Sam choked back a sob. “Dad was drunk. He was every night.... and I knew that I shouldn’t have bothered him.”
The bartender walked over to a shelf, pulling down a mug. He filled it with beer and placed it on the counter by Castiel.
Dean’s voice was shaky when he first started talking, but he quickly warmed up. He talked about the first time Gabriel had met Sam.
Fuck! What was he saying?!? He barely made it out of Dean’s apartment alive the other night!!! Why was he willingly letting this happen???
About twenty minutes later and a couple entered the bar. Dean brought Castiel over to them, walking him through the steps in waiting.
“Well, don't be afraid to start up a conversation with Dean. I’m sure he will be very pleased by your skills. Off of the dance floor, I would give him a little space to be with Sam. It is his baby brother’s big day, after all. You can hang out with me until Dean is alone. Then I would swoop in and be Prince Charming. Also, don't pretend with him. He always appreciated when people were open around him. Dean is a relatively closed off man, so encourage him with your body language to relax. He’ll follow suit.”
The celebrity was in a T-shirt with the words ‘Good Morning, Vietnam’ printed on it. Castiel found the clothing highly inappropriate, especially for a live interview. Lucifers eyes pierced Castiel’s like spears.
Gabriel walked over to the two neighbors. “Yay! So Dean is finally making friends! He is the most boring person you will ever meet. He goes to work and then he goes home. Sam and I have been trying to get Dean to do do other shit, but he is persistent in being a loser”
Ughhhhhhhh. Castiel knew that this would happen. Lucifer always found a way to bring romantics into his interviews.
Sam muttered something under his breath. He then placed a large hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Why wouldn’t he?”
“Mary was kind. She was a terrible cook, but knew how to make the best Mac and cheese. She was really smart too, from what I can remember. Sammy definitely got his brains from her. She liked gardening and took a lot of boxing classes. She was never able to stay still too long, always wanting to go on hikes and road trips. I Guess I got that from her.”
What was scarier was that Dean wanted to know Cas better, and not from tables away. He wanted to talk to him outside of the cafe. Dean wanted to take walks with him in the park, and maybe visit him again at work.
Ever since he had yelled at Cas, Dean struggled sleeping. Without the drug, it would take hours for him to get tired. When he (eventually) dozed off, he would have nightmares.
The redhead nodded. “Well, tell him to stop being a wuss. I think I found the modeling offer of a lifetime!”
Castiel’s mouth hung open, his brain completely shutting down. Freckles were littered across the broad shoulder, trailing down underneath the fabric...
His eye then caught a glimpse of light brown hair, and the model whipped his head around. A man was standing by the reception desk, talking to the man. He wore a tight black shirt, leaving almost nothing to the imagination. The man laughed, it echoing throughout the lobby
At first the man ignored him, either staring out the window or typing away on his computer. About ten minutes later and the man turns around. “Will you STOP staring at me???” He snapped, eyes glowering at him. Dean smirked, not allowing the man the satisfaction of peace.
“It’s a scary and self deprecating... and an unstable line of work. There are perks, but I don't particularly enjoy the job itself.”
Castiel chuckled, ignoring how Dean’s mouth was slightly hanging open. “You are too. actually, you look a lot like a friend of mine. Meg Masters. Have you heard of her?”
He got ready for work, eventually walking out from his apartment. Dean got into the elevator. He hesitated, his index finger hovered over the various buttons.s
Gabriel walked over to his brother, ruffling his hair. “By that, Cassie means that he broke in before I got here.”
That’s when Dean heard the sound of someone walking towards him. Surprisingly, it wasn't the clacking of heels. Thank Chuck for that.
Dean bit his lip, refusing to let himself cry. “And he is going to be happy.... that’s all I can ask for him...”
Castiel’s throat went dry. This was not the time to panic. He can freak out after the interview, not now.
Sam rolled his eyes. Castiel agreed to help, getting down from his stool and following him out the back door.
Dean laughed. “I would assume so.. that’s why it’s called a ‘horror’ novel! Why, are you scared of reading it?”
He’s could almost feel the anger radiating off of himself. “But you didn't tell me. Not even when people began to.... gossip”
“Please, it’s just Dean. And uh, I think there might be an issue for me. See, I’m more of an engineering student than a biologist. I don’t think anyone here is going to be studying anything close to what I am.”
Unknown guy swings around and suddenly Castiel knows exactly where he recognizes him from. It’s the guy that Charlie was trying to introduce to him at the annual departmental meeting. And from the expression on his face, Dean does not seem happy about being paired with him. Not at all. Castiel must have made quite the poor impression earlier with his brush-off.
Castiel just stares at Dean and can’t answer. There’s too much to say and too much fear that Dean will pity him if he explains. And he really doesn’t want Dean to think any less of him.
Castiel slumps in his chair and returns to ignoring the other grad students, wishing his flaming cheeks would cool. Meg gently punches his arm and he glances over to see an annoying sympathetic look on her face. “It’s ok,” she mouths at him. Great, just what he wanted, Meg’s sympathy, however authentic it may actually be.
Castiel looks at the message for a long moment. He’s not wallowing, he’s…ok, he is wallowing. But it had been a terrible meeting and two of his committee members had lit into him for not making any progress since the last meeting. So maybe he is entitled to wallow a little.
“Thanks for saying so. That hasn’t always felt true, but you’re right. I hope your time in grad school is much smoother.”
Impressive, thinks Castiel. Most first-year grad students can barely describe their project in less than five or six sentences. Some don’t even know what they’re working on at all. Castiel’s esteem of the unknown guy rises a little.
Dean’s frown deepens. He looks like he wants to say something to Castiel, so Castiel quickly busies himself with finding a scrap piece of paper to scribble down his number and school email. There’s a sigh from in front of him, and then similar movement.
Dean’s reply is almost too quiet to hear, but Castiel stops breathing when he hears, “Believe me, I know."
“No. When I do have energy to do anything, I have more than enough work stuff to keep me busy. And classes are starting next week, so that’s going to eat up a lot of time.”
Sulking, he lets Crowley’s announcements wash over him after the last student reports their introduction. None of them matter anyway – he’s doesn’t have to worry about paperwork submission deadlines or course creation forms or international student concerns, so he focuses on the table in front of him. When can it be time for lunch so he can just grab his box and leave?
And this is why he loves Billie. The lack of judgment. “I know. But the fact remains that I have failed at that, too.”
Charlie’s face is so earnest and kind. It wouldn’t hurt to admit to everything - how he hasn't written anything for his dissertation in over a year, how work is crushing him, he feels nothing but dread about the future, how he's mentally and physically ill, how everything is impossible and will never get better.
"Screw the project, Castiel. I'm talking about you. I'm talking about you being ok, because it doesn't seem like that's happening right now."
Dean reaches out and grasps Castiel’s shoulder. “Seriously, I don’t know what to say. You don’t even know what this means to me. Thank you.”
“I’m sorry I missed going to the movie with you and the group. I have a big deadline for work that’s eating up all my free time right now.”
Cas continues staring at him, even though it’s got to be making him cross-eyed from being so close, and Dean feels relieved. Something deep inside of him is soothed by having all of Cas’ attention – it feels right in a way he tries not to think about too often.
“Yeah, well it’d be better than fighting with you over something that doesn’t even matter. Seriously, you need to relax.”
Charlie gives him another calculating look, like she wants to say something more, and then smiles a little. “What did you have in mind?”
As the sun sets, dread slowly begins creeping in. He should be working. He should be writing. He should be doing anything but standing around with a warm, undrunk beer, talking to his friend and watching another grad student chicken fighting in the pool.
Castiel settles on the sofa and reflexively tries to put forth a smile, but then remembers he doesn’t have to pretend here. Thank fucking god.
“Yeah, it is. So come on in.” Dean pulls Castiel in and closes the door behind him firmly, like there’s an air of finality about that statement and decision.
“Which brings us to your final project.” Dr. Mills’ voice cuts through Castiel’s musings and he focuses back on her.
“No, she didn’t. And now I’m afraid that future relationships might go the same way – that they are all predicated on being in the same situation and/or place forever to succeed, which is impossible because people change all the time. Even my relationship with Sam has been different lately. I came out here to be closer to him, and then he went and got that internship to Harvard.”
Castiel steps aside so the brothers can embrace, and he swears that Dean’s eyes are a little damp. Sam is no better, and there’s some sniffling from them both.
Not exactly thrilled about the inevitable discomfort of wet, cold jeans, and yet unable to find any alternative, Dean kicks some snow aside and settles down next to Cas.
“Missed you at the patch. Charles over there tried to carry a pumpkin bigger than she was and nearly dropped it.”
Castiel can’t go pumpkin picking with Charlie’s pre-Halloween party, but makes it to the carving party afterward. Dean makes room for him beside himself and internally Cas beams.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “How many times am I going to have to tell you that it’s still Castiel? Or ‘Cas’ as you and others are so fond of saying.”
The molecular students immediately start chattering. Castiel sees the ‘ologists’ exchange glances and nods. As he suspected while reading the syllabus earlier, he’ll be partner-less and end up doing double the work anyone else has to. Typical. Although, it will be nice not to have to talk to anyone or fake pleasantries for the sake of a grade. Yes, this is a good thing, he decides. A gift from the mental health gods even.
“I guess.” Castiel tries to think. “There once was a time where I just assumed I would finish. Because until this point I never hit any real snags with school. But somewhere along the line I started to doubt.”
“Heh, you don’t have to say that. But I appreciate it.” Dean watches Cas’ eyes for a moment. “I’ve thought a lot. About today.” Dean continues. Cas holds his breath. “I talked to Charlie, and we think it might actually have something to do with this like, 90’s, sorta-feminist, well, sorta not? TV show that she promised we could all binge watch.”
Something in Dean’s posture eases with the invitation. “Yeah, thanks Cas,” he steps through the threshold, passing Cas, close enough to smell his shampoo from the shower he must have taken when they made it home. He’d smelled the same when they’d met as strangers today. When he’d held his hand. “I know we haven’t really - caught up. After everything.”
But... he has to see this through. He sought out Charlie for a reason, damnit. If he lets himself get distracted now, who knows how long it’ll be before he gets over himself enough to try again. No, the imminent danger has passed — he can allow himself this. He has to.
“Alright you crazy kids, I’ll be right back,” she says, turning heel toward the kitchen. She half-shouts back over her shoulder, “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!”
“Yes,” he replies, closing the door with a soft click. “It seemed like you... needed some space,” he tries, hoping he sounds understanding rather than accusatory.
“We might wanna do a little digging into this Buffy thing. I may have...” He heaves a sigh, gathers his nerves. Despite his best efforts, his next words come out a bit hoarse.
“Dean, that’s - thank you for telling me.” Her voice is so earnest, Dean finds himself snapping back to meet her gaze and releases a held breath.
“Dean,” Cas acknowledges, and Charlie could melt at the smile on his face. “Charlie, thank you so much for making dinner.”
“Back at the bookshop, when Cas and I were tracking that vamp, I shoulda been scared outta my mind. I mean, I kinda was for a bit there, not gonna lie. But... something kept telling me that I was safe, as long as I could keep Cas by my side. Like, deep down, it was just this, this truth that we belong...” he almost says to each other, but that can’t be true, not yet. Not until he knows how Cas feels about all of this. “That we belong together. It felt right.”
“Jeez, Cas, I uh—” Dean lifts his own free hand to rub the back of his neck, but he’s still smiling. Cas feels a wave of affection as Dean’s hand falls back to his knee, and he notices for the first time the print on Dean’s pajama pants. They’re printed with cartoon strips of bacon, of all things. ‘Wake up and smell the bacon,’ a few of them demand from their speech bubbles. “That’s kinda a long list,” he finishes. There’s something more in his smile now—mischief? Like they’re sharing an old inside joke. Maybe they are, in a way.
Cas lets the breath go, trying not to be disappointed that Dean is here to talk about the case. Of course that’s why he’s here.
His brow furrows—he hadn’t been expecting that. In most situations, Dean is far more likely to side-step a difficult conversation, still finding a way to say what needed to be said, but while maintaining a certain level of distance. Emotionally.
She puts down the spoon she’d been using to stir honey into her tea— he remembers when Cas picked it out. They’d gone to pick up groceries for Charlie when she first accepted their invite to stay in the bunker. It’d cost an arm and a leg but according to Cas, “manuka” honey was worth it. Dean wouldn’t know, he passed on trying a spoonful when everyone at home scrambled to get a taste of the “million dollar bee spit.” Too rich for his blood.
Charlie rolls her eyes good-naturedly, catching a glimpse of Cas doing the same as Dean snakes a casual arm around his waist.
It’s been about an hour since they returned to the bunker after what has to be one of the weirdest days Dean has had in a while. Which, considering the typical threshold for weirdness in their lives, is certainly saying something. He’s showered and spent about 2 minutes trying to write in the journal Sam insisted he should start, before deciding today’s events don’t require much more reflection. He needs to take action.
Cas lets the book he was trying to read fall into his lap where his legs are stretched out on the bed (
As his hand cups Dean’s cheek (slowly, allowing him the chance to turn away—he doesn’t), Cas replies, “Well, perhaps we can start with my list, and compare notes.”
“But, y’know, the more I thought about it... about, um.” Dean pauses, his eyes quickly sweeping Cas’ face. Cas could swear he pauses at his mouth, and swallows reflexively. Dean’s eyes definitely track that movement.
“He should be here any minute, he was gonna go water the plants - I guess it’s best to do it after sunset, something about letting them have a chance to drink while the sun isn’t drying them out.”
“I dunno man, it actually sounds a lot like something you’d say,” Charlie says with a light punch to his shoulder. “Can I start giving you kudos yet?”
“Anywho. It’s not like that for everybody, like I said I was lucky. I had this Aunt Marie, she didn’t come out til she was like, 50, after divorcing her husband. She wasn’t with anybody, just kinda realized it once she had the freedom to... consider all her options.”
“Ladies and germs,” she addresses the couples splayed throughout the Dean Cave, “we are in for a real treat tonight. Prepare for some serious deja vu.”
But since they got back to the bunker after the bizarre incident at the bookshop, it’s been undeniable that Dean is avoiding him. Cas can’t possibly begin to examine the reasons why that may be.
Now, after a week of dead ends, they were nearly ready to chok the whole thing up to a series of coincidences—but not until this final leg of their research was complete.
Cas sighs and swings his legs over the side of the bed, setting his book on the night table. He’s feeling restless, all too aware of the fact that he’s cooped himself up in this small space. For a moment it seems so foolish, but then he thinks of the way Dean looked away when their eyes met in the rear-view mirror on the drive back from Jody’s, Dean rushing out of the garage into the bunker without so much as a glance once they were finally home — no. It’s better this way, at least for tonight.
He raps his knuckles on the doorframe, trying not to startle her. “Charlie, hey. How you, uh, how you holdin’ up?”
“That’s alright, Dean.” He answers simply. Really, he knows Dean often needs some time to himself after a difficult day. He doesn’t want him to feel bad about that.
“This helped me feel brave once,” Cas says, his voice so quiet. He can still recall with perfect clarity the feeling of Dean’s hand in his, and wonders if Dean is thinking the same thing.
Hey, everyone! The next chapter will move forward in plot, and I’m super exited to share it with you!
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “I—Sam’s and Gabe’s wedding is in five weeks, and they want me to bring a plus one. I haven’t found anyone yet...”
He got into the shower, realizing a second too late that the water was ice-cold. Dean cussed, running a tired hand over his face. The water heater must have broken. Again.
The man was silent for a second, hovering about a foot from Dean. “It’s what neighbors do, from what I have been told”
Dean felt his face burning. “Uh, he really likes bees, honey mint tea, and reading. He is a wonderful listener and story teller. We used to hang out in the mornings. I would make him the tea and he would walk me to the restaurant. He is extremely smart and kind.”
Dean’s cheeks warmed. “It doesn’t matter what he looks like... he is a good person, and that’s what matters.”
They, fortunately, finished the scrapbook yesterday. Castiel was no longer in risk of smashing his lips into Dean’s.
He flinched back, clamping a hand over his mouth. The model had to leave early that night, just to remain mentally stable.
Jo had very well noticed what was going on now. She had a hand on his wrist, and was saying something that Dean couldn't understand.
Dean’s eyes widen when he sees a mass of people by Bobby’s Cabin. Practically everyone he had ever known had swarmed together, forming a circle around something.
He now had on a white, button down dress shirt, with a blue tie. The open blazer and slacks were black.
The first time he met Castiel, he was hiding from a mob of teens. And.... oh my god. Castiel is a model!
He was one block from the grocery store. He heard a loud and long gasp. A teenage girl was standing there, a huge smile forming on her lips.
He paused, frowning at his rival. “Wait—are you not angry at me for rigging the chair to break? You haven’t yelled at me for that yet.”
What he was really thinking? ‘If I come in, there’s a eighty percent chance that I do something that I will regret’
He nodded, going to the back of the restaurant. He began to make the man’s food. Despite not being able to see, Dean had learned how to cook as well as he previously did. As long as everything in the kitchen was in the correct place and order, things went well.
Lucifer walked over to them. “Okay. We are back from commercial in four minutes. Let’s get you situated!”
It took about a moment for Dean to realize how close they were. Dean could feel every movement Castiel made. The man’s breathing caused his back to press farther into him.
Jo shook her head. “Look, you are very adorable when you say it like that, but that’s not what you should go for. One thing I know about Dean? He’s used to having to be the charming one. He would be in for a... very happy surprise if you were confident, charming, and in control. He doesn't get that treatment often.”
He was roused from his thoughts when Claire coughed uncomfortably, eyes shifting between him and her uncle. Dean, suddenly self conscious, smiled shyly at Castiel. “See ya later!”
After completing their task, Dean and Sam made coffee and sat in a booth together. The restaurant wasn’t officially open yet, so they used the time to relax.
The girl pulled out her phone and nestled between Castiel and Dean. She was around five feet, so she looked like a child compared to them. The model flinched when Dean rested his arm around his shoulders. Castiel hitched a breath, a giddy smile on his face. His face burned, but he tried to seem composed.
Jo gave him a mischievous smile, nudging him with her shoulder. “Now go. Don't worry so much, you’ll do wonderful!”
Castiel felt a pang of pity in his chest. He knew he should change the subject. “Do you like it here?”
Dean’s foster father and ex-teacher at the school for the blind, Bobby was one of the closest people in his life. He had moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a few years back. He would drop by for holidays, but they kept in frequent contact by calling.
The bartender’s eyes softened, a tiny smile sliding onto his face. Before he could respond, there was a knock at the door. Dean walked over and opened it, revealing a dressed up Charlie.
Castiel continued. “There’s a woman with light blonde hair and blue eyes. Next to her is a man. Black hair, pale blue eyes. In his arms is a baby... it’s really tiny.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, flopping down on the couch. “He’s just a really nice neighbor... a super attractive and charming and funny and—
Dean nodded, fidgeting with his hands. “Look, I’m no stranger to drinking. Hell, I’m a bartender! I deal with it every day. But I also used to know a person who had an... addiction to the stuff.”
After John had... caused Dean’s accident, he lost custody of his children. Sam and Dean now lived with Bobby. Sam went to a normal school, and had a relatively uninteresting childhood. But Dean went to Bobby’s school for the blind. He hated it at first, but he eventually accepted it as a part of his life.
The way Dean expressed himself was.. enticing. The man always had perfect posture, maybe even too perfect... tense, even. Dean’s freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks, perfectly contouring his tan skin. The way that Dean would smile is what destroyed Castiel the most. His lips would part, and a cocky, annoying (and almost charming) grin would form.
At first, Dean was happy. He finally got to lay down his gun, retire from hunting. He had a house of his own, a new world to explore. There seemed to be an infinite amount of beers in the fridge and he could always take baby for a ride. Most importantly, he was surrounded by a lifetime of family and friends.
He looked down at his keys, then at Rowena. He went into his apartment, grabbing a oversized jacket and a pair of slacks. He grabbed his pair of fake glasses and put them on. Rowena frowned at him.
But as he scrolled through another page, he glimpsed a blurry photo. Castiel chocked on the air around him, scrolling back up to see the picture.
Dean bowed his head. “Sorry. Guess I never thought my little brother would get married... well, like, you know. I thought I would be prepared for it—
He chocked. Did the lady think they were... dating? The model looked up to see Dean’s reaction. Were his cheeks red too?
Dean grimaced. “Uh... I was wondering if I could bring you as a plus one? As friends, of course! I know you are dating Gilda.”
Castiel recalled that he was in a bar, which he could not remember the name of. He was drinking and....
The bartender felt as if he was drowning. His entire body felt frozen and on fire at the same time. Breathing had suddenly become a burden, every inhale equivalent to swallowing knives.
Dean’s heart skipped. He didn’t know if he should be shocked or suspicious. Cas actually wanted to talk to him?
The bartender made a last ditch effort to see Cas, showing up to his door and knocking. He waited for what felt like an eternity.
Castiel felt all remaining confidence draining from within him. “Uh—It’s not that I am afraid of commitment, it is just that the relationships never felt... real.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, ignoring how his stomach fluttered. He felt guilty about taking the flannel to New York with him, but he couldn’t find the heart to leave it behind.
The man scowled. “Well, I was GOING to leave in five minutes.... but I think I will be staying longer. Much longer.”
Castiel settled underneath the warm and heavy blankets, sinking into the perfect mattress. He sighed contently, causing something in Dean’s chest to flutter.
Rowena smiled. “That would be great! It is not the usual ‘leather and chains’ outfit that you wear, and it looks fashionable!”
Castiel squinted at Lucifer, his head tilting slightly. “It has been quiet. I have not been seeing anyone”
The mixtape started off with rock from the eighties. He didn't remember hearing the songs before, but the beat and percussion sounded familiar.
The angel huffed, squinting up at the hunter. “I just saved your life, Dean. You should be grateful.”
Dean’s hand instinctively fell to Castiel’s hip for balance. His body may have stabilized, but his heart raced in panic. He gripped onto his neighbor’s hip tightly, and his face burned.
Dean grinned. The university was on the way to the house he was working on! Maybe he could get Cas coffee...
Dean let a groan slip past his lips. This was so embarrassing! What if Cas laughed at him, or worse, never wanted to talk to him again??? He was already waiting for Dean to continue, head tilted to the side. There was no going back now...
It was around eight in the morning. Dean had to go into work early with Sam so they could unload the food delivery truck.
Dean continues, despite his brother’s snickers. “And those lips. Damn, I always have to stop myself from—
“He hung up. Dean hasn’t talked about you in a long time... whenever I try to bring you up, he hangs up.”
“Why the fuck are you like this?!?! No, you can’t get a new book!!! Do you really think I would waste money on that???”
Castiel, while Dean was in the restroom, had swapped tables. He was now sitting by the window, a smug smile on his face.
He was angry that something like this ever happened to Dean. That the man he cared about so much had been hurt.
Dean hand raised to his neck, a charming—er—annoying grin forming across his features. “I would love the company! Are you okay with waiting for me to get ready?”
Castiel drummed his fingers against the steering wheel. “Crowley is a fashion designer up in New York. He offered me a custom made jacket in return for an extra couple hours of work.”
Sure, even before today he struggled falling asleep. But that was because he missed sleeping next to Cas.
So that’s exactly what Dean did. He stared at the man from inside his makeshift towel hood, trying to look angry.
Well, obviously he was also a Youtuber of some type. He was grinning like a toddler on the other side of the screen, eyes wide. His voice rung from the speaker.
Castiel huffed, and his words slurred together. “I’m just tipsy, Dean, not stupid. I can get home just fine”
So he didn’t hesitate to rush forward. Next thing he knows, his head in nestled in the crook of Cas’ shoulder. He melted into the angel, eyes welling up.
The photographer led the model over to another room. This one having only cameras and a white screen behind.
The man offered Dean a gummy smile, his eyes glinting dangerously. His eyes then drifted up to the moose. He tilted his head to the side, eyebrows furrowing. Suddenly Cas seemed stiff, his smile fading.
This was... very unlike the man Dean had gotten to know. His neighbor was intelligent, kind, and genuinely cared about people. This seemed way out of character.
Dean, unlike so many people Castiel knew, didn't want anything from him. He just liked being around the model because of who he was...
Dean roused himself from his thoughts, helping Castiel into the apartment building. Castiel murmured something under his breath, his warm hand pressed into Dean’s trapezius muscle. The bartender could feel his heart racing.
There the model was, sitting on a mahogany chair. His dark hair neatly set up to look messy. His hooded blue eyes looking into the camera seductively. He had a tiny smirk on his face. His legs were slightly spread, and one his arms were leaning against the window sill. The model looked as if he was either about to get into someone’s pants or jump out of the window.
Dean popped the pills in his mouth. He then downed a glass of ice water. It took a while for it to kick in, so the bartender busied himself with cleaning his kitchen.
Dean chuckled. “It depends on the customer. There was one lady last night, Karen. She is usually just annoying, but last night was awful. She was so drunk that she started stripping...”
The words caused a wave of relief to wash over him, but Dean was still unsure if Cas was being honest.
The past week had been torture. Each day seemed to stretch on longer, and Dean had spent every moment he wasn't working on the mixtape..
He leaned over and shut off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness. The only light in the room was entering in from the window, partly covered by the curtains. Dean was back, sighing as he sunk into the mattress.
“I’m so glad we’re out of there. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing family again... but I had no idea how much longer I could listen to my cousins’ ramblings about reality TV.”
Dean stood in shock, drenched by a bucket of ice water. It had fallen from the cieling, as if it had been propped on top of the door. He spun around and locked eyes with Cas. There was a thin smile on his face.
She scowled up at him. “You asshole! You didn’t respond to any of my calls! Are you going to invite me in, or will I have to break in myself?”
Dean tuned out their conversation, playing an enticing game of Candy Crush on his phone. Three minutes later and Cas shuffled up to him. He shifted his weight when he spoke.
At first things were running smoothly. Castiel had gotten used to modeling in the mornings and waiting tables at night. Fortunately for him, he was a fast learner. He would make a couple mistakes Every night, but the ones he made were tiny, something he could fix within seconds.
Something about the model was always able to relax him. For the first time, Dean had fallen asleep without needing to use drugs or alcohol.
Bobby smirked at him. “It’s obvious, idjit! You’re always looking for him. Oh—and don't get me started on the looks you keep pulling!”
It felt wrong seeing the old car so unattended for. Baby was Dean’s prized possession, the one thing he took care of no matter what.
Dean took this moment to slip his hand out of Castiel’s. He felt wrong leaving him like this, curled up on the couch alone. Dean took off his flannel, draping it over his sleeping friend. Maybe he could use it as a blanket tonight?
Gabriel scoffed, unlocking his phone and getting onto social media. “Here, That’s him. Looks familiar, right?”
Oh right, and Meg had also (very) subtly mentioned that Castiel also digs men. He decided not to tell anyone that he knew that... Dean had never had as much hope as now. He still had only a one in a million chance with his neighbor, but he would take whatever he could get.
It was as if Castiel had been made for Dean, and Dean for him, the two fitting together like puzzle pieces
“Yup, but make it to go. There’s a house I’m working on across town, and I need to get there early.”
The remaining of brunch was slow. The meeting stretched on until late afternoon. Sam and Gabriel, Charlie and Gilda, joined Dean and the model for dinner. They stopped at a burger place on the way back to the hotel.
He put his hand out, and Castiel brushed up against it. Dean tried not to shiver from the contact. His hand was moved back to Castiel’s arm.
He could almost see the tiny smile forming over Castiel’s lips. Dean wondered what they tasted like—
That’s why the angel was so good at comforting the hunter before he died. He always knew when Dean needed him most.
Dean had been running around for the past three days, making sure his employees were on task, that customers remained happy, and that the food was still edible. It would be an understatement to say that working as sole owner was a nightmare.
The model circled him, trying to find any flaws. Once in a while he would make a slight adjustment to something. He ended up only an inch away from Dean’s face.
Castiel walked back down to his apartment, shutting the heavy wooden door behind him. He stepped onto his tiny balcony, calling Lucifer back.
Castiel shook his head. The lady smiled, her hand resting to her hip. She winked. “Have a wonderful day, you two!”
Karen clucked her tongue. “You actually look a lot like his boyfriend... Lucifer showed a picture of Castiel and him together. He said that the man was only an acquaintance, but we all know that he likes him.”
He was aware of every movement Dean made, whether it was His breathing or his arm shifting slightly.
They went to check out the book. Castiel got an.... interesting... look from the employees. One librarian winked at him and the other wiggled his eyebrows. Castiel was thankful that he was the only one able to see this. He would have died from embarrassment if Dean could see what they were doing.
John smashed his beer bottle on the floor, driving a wimpier the the younger Winchester. Dean was glaring up at his father, his fists clenched.
The bartender felt his stomach flip. “Hey, Cas! I was just getting ready to go to work... uh—do you want to come with?”
So he took a deep breath, entering the crowded shop. He found Meg at a table in the corner, wearing a sundress and floppy hat. She grinned, beckoning him over with her hand. Castiel sat, giving his friend a tiny smile. They made small talk for about twenty minutes, talking about work and whether
Sam flinched, dropping a shot glass on the floor. He glared at his fiancé, exhaling an exasperated breath.
Gabriel’s expression hardened. He then looked down, defeat creeping into his facial expression. “I.... yeah, Dean’s gone.”
Castiel hummed in acknowledgment, slowly moving back into his apartment. Dean walked a couple steps behind him, his hand still glued to Castiel’s upper arm. No, Dean definitely didn’t feel how fast Castiel’s pulse was. Nope, no way.
Dean finished his coffee and took a shower. He climbed into yet another pair of worn jeans (are Jeans the only pants he owned???) and a green military jacket. He felt a nervous jitter in his stomach.
Okay. This is all normal. It’s completely and totally normal to bring your breathtaking neighbor to your brother’s wedding as a plus one, sleep with him, wear his hoodie, and introduce him to your foster father.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, but Castiel spoke over him. “And, yes, of course I’m upset! What John did was sick. There are more than a few interesting words that I would use to describe him. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to let that define you. You are your own person, Dean, and I won’t have it any other way.”
Dean arrived early to the cafe again. He walked in, sitting down in his (very empty) seat. It was almost depressing how great he felt when beating his rival.
“Huh... okay. Castiel is said to be the ‘play boy’ of the modeling industry. Do you know if he is good in bed???”
Dean would still wake up trembling from nightmares of when Castiel died, from nightmares where he lost everything, but he had his angel to hold him when he woke up.
Dean never sat this close. Sure, there were a couple times where they would accidentally touch, but this?
“—never mind that. I am upset because you kept it from me! I trusted you... and you couldn’t even tell me what your job was!”
Dean scowled, pushing his brother out of the way so he could see Cas better. “Look, Sunshine, I am winning this thing. You’ll see.”
Every other morning, Castiel would show up to Dean’s apartment. He would accompany the bartender on his walk to work, and then go back home. Sure, it might have appeared clingy to most people, but his neighbor did not seem to mind.
After another ten minutes of talking. Gabriel kept catching Castiel glancing over at Dean, who busied himself by doing laps in the pool.
“Dude, litterally everyone thinks you look perfect. Like, Jo went on a twenty minute rant over text about—
He brought the rim of the mug to his lips, taking a long sip of the warm liquid. He was shocked with how good it tasted. The flavors were balanced perfectly, the minty flavor not overpowering the sweet. Dean didn't put sugar in here... it tasted more like honey.
Dean rolled his eyes, hanging up on his coworker. It was difficult to run his own company. He had to find interested clients, work on multiple houses at once, and ensure that his employees were happy. Dean loved his job, but sometimes it could be a bitch...
Before he could react, Dean sighed, nuzzling deeper into the covers. His mumble was barely audible. “Five minutes....”
Castiel instinctively walked over to Dean, resting his hand on the man’s slumped shoulder. But the bartender shrugged his hand off, going back to pacing around the room.
A natural light flooded into the room, rousing Castiel. He forced his eyes open, squinting at the window. A quick glance at the wall confirmed that it was—
Sam’s continued, wiping hastily at his tears. “Then I heard it. Even through the loud music I could hear the bone cracking. Then nothing. I waited in the dark for what felt like forever. I went downstairs and found...... John was gone. He had gotten into the Impala and hightailed away from his mess. Dean was on the ground, unconscious and lying in a pool his own blood. There was so much....”
“Don’t sweat it, kid! This will all be over in ten minutes... but remember that you’ll be live the whole time”
He needed to distract himself for the killer hangover he had. Meg had stuck around the bar until closing time, and even convinced Dean to take shots with her.
It was early Thursday morning, three days after the fight. Castiel had just arrived in New York City.
“Yes. A few of the students’ parents tried to offer me money in return of a good grade. They keep pestering me, even though I keep refusing...”
“People think that.... I don’t know how to put this lightly. People believe that you two are dating!”
His car pulled up to the studio, and Castiel slipped out of the backseat. Rowena was waiting there for him, a big smile on her face. Today he would be having a live interview on ‘Love, Lucifer’.
Dean and Castiel continued their morning in a companionable silence, one drinking tea contently while the other unloading the dishwasher.
The man sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “I still have no idea what to say. I have written down a million things, but none of it felt right.... actually, can you help me?”
The bar tender sighed. It was around eleven at night, and they were closing early. The day had gone by slow, and it was quieter then usual. Sam and Gabriel wanted to bring him out drinking.
Sam nodded. He remembered how distraught his brother was when he escaped purgatory alone. Wherever Dean looked, he saw his angel.
He left the cafe, getting into the Impala and speeding off. It wasn’t until he was working on a home that he realized he had called Castiel ‘Cas’. In only three days, Dean had given his rival a nickname.
Sam cleared his throat. “Sorry—I just—I can’t help him. Honestly, I think he’s beyond help... I’m scared that the only person who can really help him is you.”
Fuck—what if Dean does something wrong? What if he messes up somehow and ruins everything? It was a miracle that Cas even accepted!
The Empty pinched the bridge of it’s nose, obviously unhappy with being awake. “That’s why you keep waking up. You simply won’t give him up. I hate love.”
A chuckle. “Yeah. She really is... but she looks out for me. Rowena keeps me grounded, I guess. How are you doing?”
Castiel was supposed to be listening to Rowena right now. She was telling him about a bunch of possible meddling contracts.
Dean rose an eyebrow, frowning at the Gabriel. He loved the guy, but often had to fight the urge to strangle him. Instead of killing his friend, he offered a tiny smile. “Can I get my usual? Maybe add a slice of pie into the mix?”
His eyes drag across Cas’ body. He had ditched the trench coat and jacket, now only wearing a dress shirt and pants. If it was anyone else, Dean would have thought they were overdressed.
John was furious at his son, bitch slapping him across his face. Dean backed up in surprise. The drunk rushed towards him, grabbing his son by his shirt collar. He punched his Dean’s face ruthlessly, taking all his anger and grief out on the preteen.
Dean chuckled quietly, squeezing his brother’s hand. “I was.... Just thinking about a conversation I had with Cas this morning. What’s it to you?”
Castiel felt something in his heart ache. Dean smiled down at the model, waiting for him to start reading.
Dean rose an eyebrow, noticing the hint of sadness in Castiel’s voice. “Don’t worry, I’ll come back soon. You can always drop by my apartment too, if you want”
His excessively messy apartment provides little solace. All he can see is the dirty dishes on every surface in the kitchen, the mail piled up on the coffee table, the unfolded laundry on his tiny dining table. He knows he should do something about it. Anyone should be able to handle such simple chores. But not Castiel, no. His depressed ass is too incompetent to act like a normal adult.
Castiel stares at Dean’s reflection in the mirror. A day like today is one for risking things, so he turns around, steps into Dean’s space and kisses him.
“Look, Cas, I don’t know exactly how you’re feeling cuz I’ve never been in your exact situation. But when Mom came back, and we found out that she was a different person than we’d been brought up to believe, than what I remembered, it was hard. It’s always hard to see someone you care about not acting like themselves or not how you remember them.”
Castiel grits his teeth and forces a smile as heads turn his way. He was hoping it would escape everyone’s notice that he’s having to retake some of his coursework due to it expiring because he’s been a student too long. Looks like that’s not going to happen.
When Dean opens his apartment door to Castiel on Thanksgiving Day and catches sight of Sam hiding behind him, the rapid shift of his expression to joy and wonder is everything Castiel could have hoped for when he concocted his plan to get Sam here.
Castiel tries to relax his shoulders, but another group of grad students enters the conference room to enthusiastic greeting from the others, and he can feel his anxiety ratchet up another notch. “I just want to go back to my office.”
“I don’t know what I feel. Everything’s numb. I should care, I should be feeling panic and fear. I mean, all of my work is about to amount to nothing and everything I’ve been through could be meaningless. And I’m just…I don’t even know.”
“Ok. Do you want to do it while walking to the gym by the union? I need to battle a gym for today’s research.”
The remainder of the session passes thankfully quickly, though Billie does try to convince him to give the campus LGBT group a try again. Like someone his age and orientation would be welcome in the community. They end the session with Castiel deciding he’ll work on spending more time with Meg and Charlie in the next week to help with the feeling of loneliness and isolation.
But Dean seems to understand. He grips Castiel’s shoulder and Castiel suddenly realizes he hasn’t had a hug in ages and he craves it momentarily. But Dean says, “Wanna watch some Battlestar? You can come over to my place and eat some mac ’n cheese, cuz that’s the fine level of budget cooking you can expect from Casa de Dean.”
“Sure.” Dean doesn’t sound convinced. “Well, let’s try finding some patents and then we can be done for today. We can always meet next week to finish up.”
“Maggie either doesn’t know that Harry cheated on her with his field tech this summer or she doesn’t care.”
And later that night, when he’s trying desperately to pull words from his brain to add to his dissertation, he absolutely doesn’t think about how lovely Dean’s face was, despite the frown. No, and he doesn’t think that it’s unfortunate that he annoyed Dean, because Charlie has good taste in friends, so there was a chance they could have gotten along. Instead, it’ll be an awkward and frustrating semester for both of them.
Great. Looks like Castiel has managed to piss off someone else with his lack of social skills. Is it his fault that he just doesn’t have the energy to be overly polite and interested? It takes everything he’s got just to show up to class sometimes, never mind socializing.
Castiel locks his computer and follows Charlie out of the building, informing Pamela on the way of where he’s going. They take Charlie’s car to the local campus coffee spot, and order – a black coffee for Castiel and a double-expresso something or another for Charlie.
Not just watching Battlestar. Dean invites Castiel to come to the university gym with him and Castiel accepts, feeling less self-conscious since all the students are gone and he knows Dean won’t judge him. Castiel actually finds he enjoys gym time, and even though it’ll be a while before he sees any obvious results of working out, the change in his mood is noticeable. Plus, he has always liked running, so it feels good to get back into that.
And it suddenly occurs to Dean that he’d also failed to consider the time difference for Cas’s captivity. How long had he been Asmodeus’ prisoner, trapped beside Lucifer, the bastard who’d possessed him for all those months?
They go back to watching the movie. A while later, Dean asks, “Have you ever been in a relationship before?”
Of all of his brothers and sisters, Gabriel is Castiel’s favorite. Not just because they’ve stayed in constant contact while he’s been in grad school, but because Gabriel is the black sheep of the family, and in their family, that is actually a good thing in Castiel’s opinion.
Cas swallows, and Dean swears his eyes start to shimmer just slightly, so he looks away and pretends it’s just the cold wind making Cas’s eyes glisten. Dean’s voice betrays him with a little waver, though.
They start walking toward the union, both looking down at the phones to play the game. Halfway there, Dean speaks up again.
Charlie’s got a frown in her voice. "He's usually less abrasive than that. Something must be wrong."
“Sure, of course.” Charlie doesn’t sound convinced, but she’s too kind-hearted to push. “Well, if you’re not going to be there tonight, then you should at least meet our latest sci-fi nerd-in-arms right now.”
“How quickly you forget. Time passes differently in Hell, Dean. Do you recall that your 40 years in Hell was only 4 months on Earth? If Gabriel truly was a prisoner in Hell this entire time, it has been considerably more than just 8 years for him.”
Meg smirks and leans back on the counter to assess the other assembled grad students. “I see Maggie and Harry are still sucking face on the regular.”
And the hugs he gets from both Sam and Dean when it’s time to leave for the night are the first ones he’s had in ages. He really does feel like family and it warms him to the core.
Castiel shakes his head. “There are those that are sex-repulsed, but there are also those for whom sex is just like a hobby they don’t feel any affinity toward. Doesn’t mean they hate it or dislike people who do like that hobby, it’s just sort of a non-issue for them.”
He pushes past her gently and makes a beeline for the door. Behind he hears someone say, "That's Castiel? The guy you thought I'd hit it off with?
Gabriel pats him on the knee. “You just have to keep looking, bro. Something will click and you will feel like life makes sense.”
“Welcome to the annual Environmental Science program meet and greet luncheon. For those of you who don’t know, I’m Dr. MacLeod, director of the program here at ECU.” He pauses, and Castiel wonders if he’s expecting applause. “Now, the purpose of this meeting is to get to know one another and make everyone aware of any new departmental policies. You can have lunch and socialize as soon as we take care of business. Understood?”
Billie gives him a thoughtful look. “Do you believe that coming to understand yourself as being ace has contributed to this?”
Dean follows Castiel the rest of the way to his office before saying, "Look, I don't know what's going on exactly-"
He can’t keep a tinge of impatience from creeping into his voice as he says, “Ten years. I’ve been here ten years.” Castiel doesn’t look up, not interested in seeing the pitying or disdainful looks the other grad students are probably shooting him.
Thankfully, the meet and greet had been on a day his boss was in meetings all afternoon, so he hadn’t felt guilty telling Pamela that he was going to be taking the rest of the day off.
“She fully supported this decision. Mr. Novak, do you understand? You are aware of the deadlines you’ll need to meet?”
Castiel sighs. He knows Meg is just trying to help, but she is mostly just compounding on his misery.
“And I’m not gonna lie to you and tell you everything’s gonna be fine or that Gabriel will definitely find his way back or something else cliché like that. A millennium of torture, I can’t even imagine what that’d do to someone, archangel or not. I know forty changed me forever, in ways I wish it hadn’t.”
“So it seems that all of you have found partners. Anyone still solo?” When no one answers, Dr. Mills claps her hands together. “Good. I suggest you exchange contact information right now and then I will get on with the lecture.”
“Some pain is too much for one person alone. That’s why you got family – they can prop you up when things get to be too much.”
“Maybe you could let us in?” teases Sam and pushes past Dean. “Wow, this place is smaller than mine,” Cas hears Sam say as he gets a good look at the inside of Dean’s place.
They are both quite for a bit, listening to the movie playing out. Then Dean turns toward Cas and says, “And you should know that finishing your PhD doesn’t mean you’re destined to be or are trapped into becoming a scientist. It just means you finished.”
After everyone mostly cleans up after the pumpkin guts, Dean breaks out a couple of bottles of bourbon and Castiel gets pretty buzzed fairly quickly.
His anxiety builds and builds all through everyone else’s intros, barely listening as the other grad students speak. And then all too soon Meg is wrapping up her intro and all eyes are suddenly on him.
“Oh, I sometimes forget that you work full time on top of everything else. That’s gotta be hard to juggle that and getting all your dissertation written.”
“Yes. Despite some of the, shall we say, obstacles you’ve had to face during your time here, we believe you’ve been given plenty of time and understanding and have used up quite a few departmental resources. So it’s time for you to either step up or you will be asked to leave.”
“Drinks are in the fridge or ice chest and food’s in the kitchen as usual. The pool out back is pretty occupied, but the slip and slide down the hill is available. Are you feeling ok? You look a little pale.”
With a sigh, Charlie reaches across the table to put a hand on Castiel’s. “Dude, you don’t have to pretend like everything’s fine. Because the next ‘thing I have planned’ is the Halloween party and you usually can’t wait for that.”
Billie gives him an appraising look. “We’ve discussed before what it would mean for you to not finish. Do you still feel that way?”
Castiel shrugs. “He’s interesting, is all. Besides, I don’t have anything to offer even if I were somehow interested.”
He’s sitting in a small patch of snow, looking up at the cold stars, shoulders drooped. Dean imagines his wings are probably drooping right now, too.
Castiel follows Meg to the back to find an active party scene. The pool is over capacity, though the end with the diving board is open to what looks like a bellyflop competition. The top of what looks to be a home-made slip and slide is peaking over the top of the hill and there’s a line of laughing grad students waiting.
Castiel grimaces. “I’m running an experiment at work that requires daily maintenance, plus there’s the issue of my overdue dissertation.”
Castiel swallows. He could just say that he’s happy working at his job, which isn’t really true. Or that he came in on an unfunded project and it took him a while to get everything set up so he could do his research, which is true. But he likes Dean, quite a bit. And he’s still slightly drunk, so the words come out before he has a chance to edit them.
Castiel looks up from his undrunk coffee. Charlie is giving him a sympathetic look, and although he would rather prevaricate, Charlie is one of his oldest friends and is good at getting reluctant people talking.
Castiel is coming back from the bathroom when he overhears Sam telling Dean in a low voice, “You’ve got something special in him. You better not screw it up.”
Cas drop drops his head back onto the back of the sofa, looking over at Dean. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting to make other people happy, as long as it doesn’t make you miserable in the process.”
“I don’t want it to. But it does. And there was an added bonus this time. The program director told me I have to finish by next spring or I’ll be kicked out of the program.”
Castiel almost doesn’t go. He thinks about texting her that’s he’s got a headache or some other plausible reason, but Charlie has a history of marching over to people’s apartments and knocking on their doors until they emerge, and then she drags them to whatever event they’re avoiding. After missing the latest X-Files party, he thinks he might be on her list of people to drag out, so he decides not to risk it.
Dean grunts in sympathy, but Cas just keeps staring upward, like the cold stars sharply twinkling above are going to give him an answer. Or comfort. One of those two things Dean can help with, but he just settles down further into his jacket and stares at his shoes.
And of course, Dean tells him quite frequently that he would have been proud of Castiel even if he didn’t finish.
Three days before Christmas, they are hanging out at Castiel’s place, watching Mad Max: Fury Road, when Dean asks, “Do you think Charlize Theron is hot?”
And suddenly Castiel finds himself hanging on to every word Dean says as he explains the game. It does sound fun, so thirty minutes later he’s walking around campus with Dean, catching Rattatas and spinning Pokéstops and before he knows it, he’s completely out of work mode and not feeling guilty for doing something fun. In fact, a couple hours later after he and Dean have parted ways in much better spirits, Castiel realizes he actually forgot what it was like to feel so bad for a little while.
Meg purses her lips and then lowers her voice. “Lilith keeps hogging the LCMS. And Eve won’t shut up about her NSF grant, so being in the lab right now is sooo annoying. I suppose I could come in at night, but a girl’s got to have a social life, you know.”
Sacramento is a lovely place. The weather is nice, the conference venue for the national meeting of the Ecotoxicology Society of America is easy to navigate. The host hotel is even nice.
“Why do you think I quit school and became a baker? To piss off Mom? Yeah, and because it was something I chose and something that fulfills me.”
“So, first thing we’ll go around the table and give your name, advisor name, a brief synopsis of your research, and how long you’ve been in the program. Shall we start with you, Inias, and go counterclockwise?”
Castiel considers changing the subject or maybe even lying and saying everything is just fine, but Gabriel reads him really well in person. Plus, he’s been feeling extra stressed lately, and it might be nice to get some of it off his chest.
"I don’t know. Thing is, no matter what I choose, there's pain ahead. I can't avoid it, I tried avoiding things and it's just ruined me. I mean, look at me. I’m out of shape, I’m passively suicidal, I’m a complete mess. How can I possibly finish and what will finishing even really do for me?"
Castiel huffs a hollow laugh. “No. I do.” No, he doesn’t. He’d much rather be home and alone right now.
It’s as he’s drifting off that he realizes it would have been nice to talk to Dean after the meeting. He’d been so kind and strangely understanding the other day, helping to diffuse Castiel’s bad mood so easily. Quickly, Castiel opens the Pokémon Go app and sends Dean a gift, then turns off his phone and falls asleep.
The episode of Great British Bake Off that has been playing in the background ends and Castiel shuts off the stream. His apartment is suddenly too quiet. Better just go to bed than face the blinking cursor on his dissertation for another second.
A little sliver of excitement catches on Castiel’s brain. “Wanna come to my place in like an hour and watch the first episode? I’ll order pizza.” An hour would be enough time to shove all the mess of his living room into his bedroom and clean up the kitchen. Castiel tries not to make it obvious how much he wants Dean to say yes.
Over on the left side are Dr. Rodriguez’s thermal tolerance rice lab students. And behind them are the transgenic mice lab. The molecular bioscience students always tend to sit together, whether it’s seminar or class. To Castiel’s right are the ‘ology’ students – herpetology, ornithology, mammalogy, entomology, and ichthyology. Castiel has more in common with them than the molecular group, but most of them are studying population ecology, not ecotoxicology. Too much chemistry for them, he guesses.
“She said there’s some kind of group costume thing for her party and wanted to know if I was in. Said the theme was going to be Battlestar Galactica since we could all be pilots in tank tops or something.”
Dean leans his head back on the sofa. “Cassie. We met in undergrad when we were both journalism majors. I actually thought she might be the one. But then I switched to engineering to make my dad happy and we drifted apart. I like engineering, but Cassie and I had a huge fight about how much I do things to please my dad.”
“Uh, I’m-” he clears his throat and starts again. “I’m Castiel. My advisor is Dr. Milton but I’m currently working in Dr. Shurley’s lab. My dissertation research involves studying the difference in ecotoxicology of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey and native bees.” Castiel pauses, then says in a rush. “And I’ve been here a while.”
Castiel hears the guy yelp as Charlie probably elbows him. As a receiver of Charlie’s pointy elbows of discontent on occasion, Castiel can sympathize. But he’s in no mood to be around people right now, so it’s for the best if he just leaves. And he does.
Dean looks up and Castiel reads uncertainty in his eyes. Timidly, he says, “I kinda think Jamie is hot.”
“Of course he won’t. You aren’t the same as you were eight years ago,” Dean says softly, squeezing the arm around Cas’ shoulders to let him know he means that in a good way.
He’s been thinking about doing it for weeks now, and this seemed like the perfect moment. Dean must agree, because he immediately deepens the kiss, pulling Castiel closer to him. They part a few moments later, both out of breath, and huff little laughs at the looks of wonder on each other’s faces.
“I’m sure he just needs some alcohol to loosen up a bit,” comes Meg’s voice from over his shoulder. “Here, Clarence.” A bottle of beer is shoved into his chest and Castiel grabs onto it reflexively.
“You are so fucking stubborn, you know that?” Dean throws up his hands. “Fine, you find something that’ll work for you and I’ll just pretend it applies to my research too.”
“I have, yeah.” Castiel’s stomach turns. “And it once was a point of pride to say I’d survived all of that. But now I just feel tired. I feel tired all the time.”
Dean held back a choke, pursing his lips. Castiel, did in fact, choke, spluttering out a couple incoherent words.
Kevin continued. “Castiel has been on trending for the whole week. In my opinion, the model isn’t going anywhere any time soon. I believe that he will be continuing his modeling career in the United States, with the exception of a few international photo shoots. Crowley, a fashion designer in New York City, announced on Twitter that he would be offering Castiel Novak many opportunities, all of which he can do in the proximity of home.”
Kevin then shut down his PowerPoint. “So, you guys have also been asking a lot of questions. ‘What will happen to Castiel Novak?’ ‘Will he fade from the public eye?’ And the most frequent question ‘who the hell is that bartender?!?’ Well, I am happy to attempt an answer to all of these.”
He was lying on his back, left arm wrapped tightly around Dean, who was using his shoulder as a pillow.
Castiel watched himself in horror as he ran through the airport, dodging through massive crowds and swiveling his head around like a lunatic.
Sam’s stomach churned. Who could Dean be talking about? He hadn’t been dating anyone to his knowledge. Hell, he hadn’t had a one night stand in over a year.
He was on his side, hair ruffled and a lax expression settled across his features. Sunlight peaked out from the slightly open curtains, making his tan skin glow.
He had lost too much time already. He would be damned if he wasted another second. “Take me to Dean.”
Dean’s cheeks burned. He scoffed, hoping to cover up his flustered appearance with annoyance. “No, you jerk, I was just curious!”
“What do you mean? No catch. I get a ten minute interview, you get ten thousand bucks. That seems pretty worth it to me...”
Castiel continued going to the restaurant, forcing Dean to teach him how to bartend. He modeled in the late mornings and helped wait tables between eight and twelve. He would walk then back home with Dean, where they would sometimes watch movies.
She decided to stay in the hotel. Ellen went to Gabriel’s bachelor party, who had declared to her that they were going to get ‘very drunk’.
Castiel chuckled. “Aren’t you supposed to buy me a drink before taking me home? That’s usually how these things work...”
“Uh, same as always. Gabriel and Sammy are still arguing over tacos and burgers. Sometimes I wish that I could trade my blindness for my hearing. Then I wouldn’t have to hear them complaining all the time!”
Castiel hung up on her, checking his social media. Rowena was right, people were talking about him and Meg a lot.
Dean nodded, grabbing his keys and jacket. They left the apartment and went down to the lobby. Garth looked up from his phone and saluted them.
The seven year old ran back up the stairs. John was obviously drunk, swaying to the side and crashing into the counter.
About two hours into her marathon and she hears a frantic knock at the door. She gets up to open it, thinking that her mom had forgotten something.
Castiel shifted, sounding more comfortable with the turn their conversation took. “Yes, the apartment is nice. I still need to get some of my possessions out of the moving boxes, and I need to go shopping for some furniture.”
Rowena had her hands on her hips, her face matching the same shade as her hair. She must of had a heated argument with their client.
Basically, Gabriel and Sam are struggling to get Castiel and Dean together. This chapter is on crack. Have you ever watched parent trap??? Well, there’s serious Parent Trap vibes going on...
Whenever he did talk, Dean would only respond to questions. Each reply would be cut throat and accusatory.
The model was sitting in a bar with Crowley, Rowena, and a couple other rising models, Balthazar and Anna. They were all discussing the shoot they would be doing over the next week.
Dean strolled back into the living room, greeting the (very) distraught model. He wore a less revealing, albeit tighter, T-shirt, along with jeans. Castiel could see the strong muscles moving from underneath the shirt.
The bartender walked over and pressed the device in his hands. “Just a bunch of classic and popular songs that I strung together. Something for you to listen to...”
He turned away the second Dean peeled off his shirt. He only caught a glimpse of tan skin in the reflection.
Dean stood back up, walking over to his new seat. He sat and waited for Castiel, who entered the cafe about half an hour later. He grinned when seeing Dean at a different table.
Dean found himself parked in front of the coffee shop. He got out of the Impala, running through the parking lot. Despite his best efforts, he is once again drenched by the rain. He stumbled into the shop, slamming the door behind him.
Fifteen minutes of walking and lighter conversation passed by when the model caught eye of the library.
Jo giggled. “Well, you came to the right place! Lucky for you, I actually took dancing lessons back a couple years back.”
Dean’s speech was sweet and simple. He talked about how Gabriel and Sam met, and added in a couple funny stories and jokes. Dean didn't even seem nervous! Somehow, he managed to pull himself together on the car ride over.
He opened the door. Then remembered. Shit. He tried to sound suave, but his voice betrayed him. “I-uuh. Hey! Sorry, I just woke up. You can come in if you want, but I need to get ready...”
Dean buried his face in his hands, taking a deep breath. “I’ll... I’ll let him go. I can’t be the one that stopped him from winning ‘Next Top Model.’”
Almost every day after that, Dean would pray to Castiel. Most of the time he would tell the angel about his day. A new case he was working on, Sam and Eileen getting together and going on dates, anything that came into mind. Almost every day he would reminisce about the times Cas was alive. About them watching movies in the bunker, the silly arguments they got into. He apologized a lot too.
“I’m glad that I helped you. You know.... it should not matter which gender you are attracted to. Unfortunately, society makes a really big deal about sexuality. Love is love, and it is different for everyone. Sure, relationships can be rocky, and it’s hard to find the right person. Love is not about what someone looks like, or their popularity, but about how they make you feel. Love is growing with someone else, and learning who they are...”
Castiel smiled. He hadn’t seen a relationship so light hearted in a long time. In the modeling world, every relationship was put under a giant microscope.
Dean bit his lip, suddenly seeming very small. “I’m going to miss you, Cas. You have no idea how much....”
Lucifer smiled widely at the cameras. “Welcome back to ‘Love, Lucifer’, everyone! I am joined right now by the rising model, Castiel Novak! I can tell you, the man is just as good looking in real life as in the magazines! Tell us Castiel, how do you feel about being here today?”
Dean chuckled to himself. “Actually, there was! There’s a regular at my bar. Her name’s Karen. Well, she has a very bad habit of getting wasted and blacking out. About five days ago, she got so drunk that she started stripping!”
Castiel rolled his eyes, exasperated. “I threw my hoodie in the back seat. If you lean, maybe you can reach it.”
Before Castiel could react, the bartender had turned around and rushed for the bathroom, slamming the door behind him and starting the shower.
He pulled out his phone, grimacing when he saw a long list of missed calls in his notifications. Dean brought the device to his ear, lips pursed together. It was going to be a long day...
He was furious, upset, and embarrassed all at once. He was going to do the only thing that could help him forget about today.
The bathroom door opened, Dean trudging over with a tired expression on his face. He flopped onto the bed with no hesitance, groaning.
Dean had never been this close to Cas before. They were sharing a table only meant for one person. If he moved himself any closer, their knees would collide.
Out of the blue, Dean spoke. He said more than the angel had heard him utter to anyone since before he died.
Dean’s charming—er—cocky voice echoed in the late summer air. “Oh yeah! So you got arrested for reading a book on top of a mental institution.... care to explain???”
It was getting increasingly difficult for him to stay professional. Castiel had to keep stopping himself from slipping his hand into Dean’s, or from moving his thumb against the man’s bottom lip.
The plane trip back home was not as bad as the previous. Dean merely squeezed his hand like a lifeline, his head hung low. Castiel might have lost all feeling in his fingers, but he counted the flight as a success.
For the first time in the period Castiel knew him, Dean looked angry. His jaw clenched, and his shoulders seemed to tense up.
So the model slipped underneath the covers, trying to keep as much distance between him and Dean as possible.
Jo was very proud by his improvement. Somehow, she was managed to change Castiel from the worst dancer in the actual history of the world, to even better than HER! And she had been dancing for years!
Dean’s lopsided grin was enough to make him pass out. He had never seen him so nervous and excited at the same time. His green eyes conveyed an emotion Castiel could not decipher.
It was a picture of him and Dean standing next to the taxi, right before he had to leave for the airport. The bartender was holding Castiel’s hand in his, a tiny smile on his face.
The man paused for a second, then chuckled. “That is a good question, but you won’t believe me if I told you...”
He sat down on the couch. “Well, we need to find something that will be meaningful. Something that they can both get on board with...”
“It’s kinda important that everything is in the correct place. If it isn’t, I’ll have problems cooking later.”
Why in Chuck’s name would Castiel want to leave Dean behind? To get judged in some stupid competition he won’t even win?!? Funny story!
“Yeah!!! He would obviously choose Castiel. They would be hitched by the time the wedding was over.”
The man was humming to the song  ‘All out of love’, a lopsided smile toying with his perfect lips. The sun peeked out from behind the puffy white clouds, illuminating his tan face.
He bent over to pull out a tiny pot out from under the stove. Castiel got a great view of Dean’s ass.
Gabriel pressed a hand to his chest. “I came up with it myself! Sounds cool, right? I’m calling today, ‘The Battle Of The Sugar Packets!’”
Okay, so I have been struggling with a few of the upcoming chapters. I believe I know where I’m going with the plot, but I wanted to know how you guys are feeling about the story.
Castiel turned and left, almost sprinting out of the building. His rib cage was pounding, and his hands shook.
The shorter man immediately countered. “It’s my fault, Dean. I forgot that the wood was raised a bit over there... I’m sorry”
She laughed, her dark brown eyes sparkling. “Cassie was a huge nerd, always reading and writing. He was super shy too, usually keeping to himself. It took us a while to be friends, but the wait was worth it.”
The bartender took his clothes and walked into the bathroom. He didn't close the door in order to maintain conversation with the model. What Dean didn't know was that there was a mirror reflecting off the wall, revealing the inside.
Castiel couldn't help himself from glancing back over at the picture of Dean. He felt his chest tighten. Here the model was, lying in his bed with only boxers on at one in the morning, looking at a picture of his VERY attractive neighbor.
Castiel tried to wiggle father away, in order to respect Dean’s personal space. The other wouldn’t have it, making a tiny groan and shifting with him. If the model tried moving again, he would fall off of the bed.
The younger brother put his mug down, rubbing the back of his neck. “Guess we have that model guy to thank for it... and you, apparently”
Castiel chuckled, unaware of Dean’s unease. “Then there’s a boy, around four. He has a lopsided grin on his face, and he has really bright green eyes—like yours. That’s you.”
Dean got ready to sleep, and git into bed. He lied there for what felt like hours, thinking about his neighbor.
He gulped, looking down at Dean’s slightly parted mouth. He wondered what would happen if he were to lock lips with him, and how he would react if Cas were to bite his plump lower lip and tug at it—
Dean was just being nice, but everyone else thought it was undeniable proof to their ‘secret relationship’.
Cas gasped, His eyes blown wide. He repeated Dean’s words, as if trying to translate it. “You want to get a drink with me.”
The tallest man immediately lost all his confidence. “Calm down—you two are acting like Gabe and I...”
Cas rambles about his family, going into detail about his experience as the youngest of four children. Dean laughs when Cas tells him about the prank wars he had gotten into. It is evident by the end of his story that he was going easy on Dean in their Coffee War.
He grabbed Castiel’s hand, holding it in his. He knew that he was still crying, but he made no effort in hiding it. “I love you too, Cas. I love you so much...”
Everything made sense. Why Dean’s stomach churned whenever the angel got too close, why his body heated up whenever Castiel complimented him.
Gabriel had called Dean last night, just to tell him about Castiel and his barbaric forms of revenge. He went into vivid detail about all the things that Cas had done in retaliation to pranks.
Castiel drank some of the water. He then sat down in the closest booth. “I.... I have something I have to tell you all.”
The went into the elevator, Dean chuckling to himself. “It’s strange to think that you’re the same man that ran into my bar just this summer...”
He felt small under Castiel’s frightening gaze... And safe for some reason, just like yesterday. Was that weird?
Castiel couldn’t help being distracted. He should have been at home right now, apologizing profusely to Dean.
Bobby grunted. “You never apologize... to anyone. Who is this friend of yours, and what makes them so special?”
There was a quiet knock at his door. Dean thought that he had been imagining it, but he was proven wrong when hearing it again.
The entire world stopped. Everyone in the bar was frozen in place, staring at the two in shock. Castiel’s hand gripped at the bartender’s jeans. He hooked his thumb on the belt loop, pulling Dean closer. He felt a hot tear hit his jaw. Whether it was Castiel’s or his, he wasn't sure.
He hung up on Bobby rushed out of the bar before Gabriel or Sam could react. He sped down the street, getting onto the freeway.
Rowena giggled. “Are you two finally dating? You know, you two have been circling each other the whole summer—”
Green eyes. A smile that could crumble any stone wall. A laugh that gave him a heart attack whenever he heard it.
“Yeah, the really handsome man in the corner. Woah, he’s gorgeous! His jaw line looks hard enough to cut glass...”
The model had completely tuned out the show by now, smiling down at Dean as he ran his hand through his hair.
Castiel waited for the voice to come back. He held on to the hope that Dean would try talking to him again.
“Eh, she didn’t look like she was really all there. You, however, were made for this. I was wondering if you would be down for a solo modeling session? You see, I have business associates that might be interested in employing you.”
“Dude, are you kidding me??? You can’t ignore what’s going on anymore! Everyone thinks you’re dating the man, and he doesnt even know you’re a model!”
Dean and Castiel dove into an endless conversation that day. The only thing that stopped them from continuing was the call Dean had gotten from Sam. Apparently, the water heater had broke.... again.
About thirty seconds later and the door opens. The sweet aroma of something baking hit Dean. Heat radiated in the apartment.
Charlie and Sam shared a deadpan expression before turning back to glare at him. “Are you kidding us right now?”
Dean shot him a reassuring grin from over his shoulder. “You’ll do great! I’m going be there the whole time. I’ll take over if you get nervous, okay?”
The man’s eyes glinted dangerously, making Dean wish he had shut up. Before Castiel could say anything, his phone rang. He pulled his phone out of his trench coat pocket, putting it to his ear without breaking eye contact.
Sam sighed, defeated. “I haven't seen you eat since we found out about Cas... and I think you’ll die if you don’t eat something.”
So instead of grabbing his brother and hightailing it home, Sam creeped over to the bar. The bartender, an exhausted looking woman in her mid twenties, grimaced. She, just like Sam, seemed to be disliking Dean’s performance.
“Gabriel... I hope you don't mind me mentioning this, but Dean brought something up yesterday. I wanted to know how to approach the situation without making him feel uncomfortable.”
Castiel sighed. He was on set, taking a break from modeling. Rowena was talking to their client, renegotiating their terms.
“Nope.” Dean tosses back more bourbon. “Kid’s on a mostly unpaid internship at a hoity toity law firm, so he’s just as strapped for cash as me. And I think they make him work that whole time, too. Guess I’ll have to wait until next year to see him.”
“That’s it, Castiel. You’ve been ignoring texts and avoiding me at seminar. We are going out for coffee
Meg texts him that night while he’s trying to “work on his dissertation”. Which really means he’s sitting on his sofa watching Great British Bake Off and agonizing over his life.
“Sounds like maybe that life isn’t what you really want. Or maybe you’re just burnt out. Ten years is a long time to be working on one thing constantly.”
They stay that way until Dean can’t feel his toes and the ass of his jeans is soaked completely through. Somehow, wet pants just aren’t all that important right now.
Castiel gives yet another half-hearted smile as Alfie from Dr. Zeddmore’s lab waves at him, then turns and pretends to be reading the lunch box labels.
He waits a minute or so to see if Cas will say anything more, and when he remains staring resolutely upward, prompts, “What’re we doing up here, Cas? It’s fucking freezing.”
“Got it. Must be leftover from when Meg dumped that entire pumpkin’s-worth of stuff over your head.”
“Quit my dissertation?” Castiel tries to make it sound like that’s a novel thought, but the knowing expression on Gabriel’s face tells him he’s not been successful.
Well, that’s direct. “I’m fine, just swamped right now. I promise I’ll come to the next thing you have planned.”
“I think it’s made me realize that I have nothing to offer people. That I am misleading them when I try to start a relationship, so it’s just better if I don’t date anyone. Besides, grad school has ruined my physical and mental health, so it’s not like anyone’s been asking.”
They exchange information without a word, and Dean immediately turns back around. From his rigid posture, Castiel guesses he’s either annoyed or frustrated.
“Kinda hard to fix something that’s been broken since you were a teenager. It’s not like I can magically just start believing in myself and loving myself.”
Dean looks over at Castiel and there’s so much gratitude in his eyes that Castiel has to look away. “Cas. I don’t even know what to say.”
Gabriel grabs the remote and hits pause on the movie, then turns to face Castiel. “What are you going to do?”
So, he decides to go for a distraction. “I’m really ok, promise. And now that you’ve reminded me about Halloween, I think we should probably figure out our group costumes for this year, don’t you?
“Cas! I was worried you weren’t coming.” Charlie gives him a huge hug and Castiel returns it with as much warmth as he can muster. He’s low on spoons today, and he’ll probably have to spend tomorrow in bed to recover, but the smile on Charlie’s face is worth it.
The joint gym sessions have really helped Castiel feel more confident in his body. Quitting his job had helped a bit too. Dr. Shurley hadn’t been happy, but Dean had encouraged Castiel to do something different for a while. Castiel thinks he wants to write grants for non-profits, but he’s actually happy working at Starbucks for now. He feels more in control, more satisfied with his life and is even coming off of some of his meds because he’s not as depressed anymore. He’s pretty sure that has more to do with Dean than being free of his dissertation, but Billie is helping him keep an open mind. Some of the other grad students have shamed him a bit for leaving academia, but Dean shuts them down with “Any of you finish yet? Didn’t think so. Don’t judge what you don’t understand.”
But then he imagines Charlie’s reaction. She’d probably be speechless and he’d feel embarrassed about revealing so much and do what he could to immediately escape. No, better he suffer this alone. No one else needs to know about how badly he’s doing.
Dean must too, because he starts talking about his brother and how bummed he is that he won’t get to see him during the holidays. Apparently, Sam is on the other side of the country right now, and Dean can’t afford either the plane ticket or the time away from his project to see him.
Cas just sighs, so Dean waits another minute, then adds, “I know Asmodeus had eight years to torture Gabriel, but he’s a tough son of a bitch. We get those stitches off and he’ll be back to sassing us in no time.” Dean adjusts his jacket against a gust of icy Kansas winter wind. “Plus, that’s gotta be just a blink of the cosmic eye to you guys, right?”
Castiel wants to keep arguing – it’s been a while since he’s felt so fired up – but the unexpected softness in Dean’s face stops him short. “Okay. What do you suggest?”
“As you can see, you’ll be pairing up with another student in the class to complete three smaller projects that you will combine into a final oral presentation. I want you to be sure to pick someone in your area of expertise since the tasks will relate to your research.”
“I have experienced grief many times since my creation, none so painful as the times when I harmed you and Sam, or when you died or were grievously injured, or when my siblings were cast out of Heaven by Metatron, or when I realized the enormity of suffering I had caused after absorbing the Purgatory souls.
Castiel closes his eyes, then takes a deep breath and opens them. “I once thought I was. His name was Balthazar and he was in my lab. We spent all our time together, and I fell for him pretty hard. But I had to hide my feelings, even going so far as to pretend we weren’t friends anymore.”
“Well, Crowley gave me an ultimatum a couple of months ago – finish by spring or get kicked out of the program.”
Later, Castiel is alternating playing solitaire and mahjong with almost frantic energy while Chopped is on in the background. It’s the teen tournament and all every contestant seems to talk about how they’ve always wanted to be a chef.
I am working on your chapters as quickly as I can. A few other students who are on track to graduate sooner are currently my top priority. When can I expect chapter 3 from you?
There’s no way he’ll actually make that deadline, but maybe he’ll magically feel better and remember how to do research again and stop living in this nonstop nightmare. And maybe he’ll split into two copies of himself who can manage to doubly avoid his life. That’s probably about as likely as him finishing right now.
“But this is the first time I’ve felt grief because someone is still alive. I am unaccustomed to such pain. It is unsettling. How do you bear it?”
They both drift off and Castiel is shocked to realize he feels happiness for the first time in what feels like forever.
On autopilot, he turns around and reenters the conference room, pointedly ignoring Meg’s attempts to get his attention. Castiel walks over to the table holding the boxed lunches, grabs one without looking, and tries to escape.
“I’m on my third advisor. My first one was a verbally-abusive ass who did some shitty things and I testified against in university court. He chose retirement over being fired. My second advisor was manipulative and cruel, and I was not sorry that he got a job elsewhere. But it did slow down my progress pretty significantly. And then there’s the issue with my mental health, which is poor due to all the stuff I’ve been through since I got here.”
It’s a week after Labor Day and Dean and Castiel are sitting in Dean’s office trying to work on their group project.
Dean comes up behind him and rests his head on Castiel’s shoulder, looking him up and down in the full-length mirror. “Looking good,
“Your brother is very important to you. I’m glad it worked out that he could come for one of the holidays. Sorry it couldn’t be Christmas.”
Crowley smirks. “Well, we had a little chat. And we’ve decided that you have until spring to successfully defend or you’ll be removed from the program. You’ve been here too long, you see, and it’s becoming quite the problem.”
“I guess it would mean that I didn’t give up. That I finished what I set out to do. That everyone who said I couldn’t was wrong.”
“I hate having to see all the other grad students and knowing I should be done by now. It’s embarrassing. I know they all wonder why I’m still here.”
Cas considers this, then says, “God made the archangels the strongest of all of us, absolute, but he did not make them invincible. Gabriel will not be the same. Maybe will never be the same again.”
“Probably,” Castiel says, tossing his laundry into the basket. “She does like to make my life slightly miserable.”
Dean lets Cas huddle against him and relishes this easy closeness. He tells himself he’s letting the nearness linger on the pretense of it being cold, but knows it’s for another unspoken reason entirely. And he ignores the hopeful leap of his heart as Cas lays his head down on Dean’s shoulder and exhales deeply.
Castiel pulls his face together into a semblance of a normal expression and walks into Dr. Milton’s office. “Yes?”
But on the way home, the dread turns to anxiety, which won’t help him with work. The only way to handle that is a walk that completely tires him out, so he parks his car and heads toward campus. The gutted feeling won’t go away, but at least he can escape the feelings of emptiness and loss for a bit while he walks. It’s better than feeling like nothing will ever be ok again.
“No.” Castiel looks up. “I mean, if nothing else has gotten me to finish so far, why would this? If anything, I feel worse.”
“Yes.” Castiel’s heart is thudding in his chest. Has he ruined their friendship or whatever this fragile thing is between them by revealing his sexuality?
He’d written her a couple of days ago asking when she’d get him his chapters back because she’s had them for nearly a year. It’s certainly not all because of Anna that he’s stalled out in his writing, but it would be nice to actually get some feedback for a change.
Castiel swallows and wishes he could just vanish. Does he really have to say? Crowley gives him a look that clearly says yes. Reluctantly, he murmurs, “Ten.”
Oh. He’d forgotten about that. Usually Charlie’s viewing parties are one of the highlights of his week, but right now, he can’t imagine having to pretend to be ok around other people for one more minute. He needs to go home and hide under his covers for the next week.
Frustrated with himself on many levels, Castiel gives up on trying to write and heads into the lab. Maybe some late-night work will help get his mind off of the fact that he’s totally screwed.
Billie gives him a moment. He appreciates that about her. Of the eight or so therapists he’s worked with in the last 16 years, she’s his favorite. She doesn’t try to tell him what to do, doesn’t make him feel bad for being such a failure, tells him that he’s worth more than what his parents have made him feel, and works with him at his pace. He trusts her a great deal.
Of course he doesn’t. “C’mere.” Dean acts on pure instinct and pulls Cas against him. Cas goes without resistance, shuffling slightly over so that he’s flush against Dean’s side. He feels warm.
What is he supposed to say to that? Thanks for deprioritizing me even though I know why? Also, you’ve had my chapters for almost twelve months, what does ‘quickly’ even mean to you? Also, chapter 3 is a mess and I haven’t written a word in months?
Castiel shrugs. “Mostly the same. Some days I sleep fourteen hours and some days I sleep two. I have started taking those vitamins again to make sure it’s not because of some kind of deficiency, but I’m still exhausted.”
One of those students catches Castiel’s eye and he realizes it’s Dean. He’s in deep blue swim trunks and is sporting a pair of aviators. Castiel watches as Dean takes a running leap and disappears over the edge of the hill. A loud whoop goes up from those waiting, so Castiel assumes Dean must have either gone very fast or done some kind of hot dogging trick.
They both strip down to boxers and hop in, Castiel thinking that if it weren’t for the alcohol, he’d probably be feeling very self-conscious right now. Instead, when Dean wriggles a little closer, Castiel can’t help but respond in kind, until they are practically snuggling.
Castiel chats with Meg for a while longer, watching Dean from the corner of his eye, trying to be sly. From Meg’s shit-eating grin, he knows he’s not being as subtle as he hopes.
When Dean reappears over the edge of the hill, Castiel examines his figure. He muses were he capable of being attracted to someone, he would find Dean extremely attractive. He’s tan, nicely toned, and his features are quite symmetrical. But being ace, he only finds him aesthetically pleasing.
“Gah, no science talk. We’re supposed to be celebrating the end of summer and the start of more annoying classwork, so leave the science stuff at the door. Come on, let’s go see what everyone’s doing in the back.”
“He was super religious and considered homosexuality a sin and asexuality to be fake. So, I thought it was better if he hated me for being a ‘bad friend’ than hate me because I loved him.”
Castiel walked over to the pacing man, hands resting on his shoulders. “Calm down, Dean. You’ll be great. Sam will appreciate you, even if were to show up in jeans and a T-shirt.”
The bartender let a small smile creep onto his face. He then brought a calloused hand to his shoulder, resting it on top of Castiel’s.
The man had stopped by three times since since his hangover. The man spent a couple hours with him on those days. He would make him honey mint tea, and they would talk. With every conversation, Castiel felt a stronger pull towards Dean. It had become overwhelming at this point, and he could barely contain himself.
The bartender listened as the man walked away, and the door closed behind him. Dean let out a shaky breath.
So Dean took a shower, standing numbly underneath the falling water. He had no idea how long he was in there. The steaming water became ice cold with time, but the man barely noticed.
He was shocked when the man had said he was blind. He sounded so cavalier about it, as if it was an amazing quality. Castiel felt bad for him at first, but the bartender seemed perfectly fine with it.
He looked up, eyes locking with electric blue. He offered a small smile. “Don’t get used to it, Sunshine.”
Whenever he talked to the man, Dean would feel a strange warmth wash over him. Castiel’s deep and low voice echoing in his head. His words slurred together from drinking so much. The way that—
Oh crap... Sam knew that Dean couldn’t sing before, but he really sucked. It didn’t help that Dean was drunk. His speech was slurred, his words harshly clashing together.
Dean laughed again. His voice shook slightly. “Uh—the couple will throw a bouquet of flowers at a crowd. Whoever catches it will be the next to marry.”
Dean let go quickly, facing ahead. Now that Castiel’s saw him better... Dean’s eyes were beautiful. The shamrock green irises were looking ahead blankly. His lips were impeccable. his Cupid’s bow and bottom lip were the perfect shape.
Castiel followed Dean out of the apartment complex. They walked down the street, the warm wind blowing against them.
Dean dialed a number into his phone, pressing it to his ear. Charlie Bradbury, his old roommate and best friend, had a spare key to the home. She would be more than happy to help him out! But she lived an hour away. She offered to bring her keys down after work, but she wouldn’t be able to leave work until four.
“Look, I know you told me to go chase my dream and pursue modeling, and I tried. I really tried, but I can’t do it... not without telling you something first.”
Balthazar couldn't keep his giggling under control. It was funny on the first day of working together, but Castiel had (finally) grown tired of it.
Castiel felt like he was about to go through a nervous breakdown. He only had five weeks to get a gift, clothes, a plane ticket, and mentally prepare to be Dean’s date.
Dean felt a wave of disappointment wash over him. Castiel seemed to notice this, because he immediately back tracked. “My apartment number is 314. I might not always be there, but you are always welcome”
Castiel shrugged, pulling out a phone from his trench coat pocket. He held it out for Dean to take. “Put your number in.”
Dean sighed, opening the car door. He got out of the Impala, reaching back inside to grab Cas’ coffee.
He left the coffee shop, but not before looking back at Castiel. He was still standing, watching Dean leave with a smile on his face. Something about Castiel made Dean’s heart race. At first he thought it was because he just hated the guy, or was embarrassed around him.
The man scoffed, looking at Castiel when speaking next. “Well, when you decide to ditch the guard dog, come find me.”
Dean rushed in, standing in the middle of the living room. His head was bowed down, facing the hardwood floor. He was silent a minute, biting his lip.
“Cas... look. I can’t do this anymore. I want to believe that you’ll come back... that somehow you’re able to hear me. But what if I’m just fooling myself? What if I-I’m going crazy?”
Castiel felt his cheeks flush, remembering the conversation from earlier that day. “He is very kind. And very... observational.”
A sense of dread washed over Castiel when seeing the bed, which was positioned in the middle of the room.
Everyone but Castiel and Dean followed suit, standing up and filing out of the room. Gabriel was the last one to leave, shooting Castiel a wink and grin before closing the door behind him.
He scanned the coffee shop, eyes landing on the figure across the room. Cas was, today, reading a book. He was biting his bottom lip, eyes darting across the page. It was adorable how caught up in the book Cas was—
Before either of them could say anything, a gasp rung from down the street. A young teen, maybe fourteen, was standing opposite from them. Her eyes were wide with shock.
Castiel walked slowly to the right. “About three feet from you is a sofa, which is facing the TV. There is also a kitchen table by the window,”
Once in a while when Castiel was alive, Dean would unintentionally pray to him. This only happened when he needed something so much that he would unknowingly pray for it... and in specific, pray to Cas.
Okay... so a super charming and hot bartender lives only a floor above him... That doesn’t change anything
He would dream about his childhood often. Sometimes they would be about Sam. Dean loved hiow his younger brother used to smile, big and bright. The man frequently wondered if he still smiled like that. He hopes so.
Gabriel nodded, disappearing to the back of the cafe. Dean sat at a table about five feet from Castiel’s. He got out his phone and skimmed over his emails.
Dean felt himself smiling. It was subtle and small, but genuine. He was never able to think about his mom without crying, but this was the first time he had smiled. He and Cas sat there for a while, letting what each of them had said sink in.
He watched as Dean worked. It was crazy just how fast he had memorized the kitchen’s layout. He found all the needed materials within a five minute period.
Dean spent almost all his time with Cas now. He wasn’t nervous about telling him the truth anymore, or accidentally slipping up.
“Okay... this book is titled ‘To Read Braille’, which would help you. This one is a cookbook. There is a few of them by Jane Austen. There is also a section of Shakespeare.... woah, a LOT of Shakespeare. Uh, then there’s—”
Sam grumbled. “I’m trying to get Dean to take his... crush? I guess you could call him that... but Dean has been trying to avoid it...”
Hey, everyone! I am SO exited about sharing this update with you! Yes, this extra long chapter is all complete with ridiculous pining, tooth-rotting fluff, and our idiots being... well, idiots!
Castiel, after a fleeting moment, hugs him back. He clings onto the hunter, hands clenching at flannel.
Dean nodded sympathetically. For the second time in the past couple days, he wondered what his rival’s job was.
A tiny smile grew Dean’s face. Even when drunk, Castiel had somehow maintained a strange taste in conversation.
Dean reminisced of how Sam rushed into his apartment at three in the morning one time, terrified by the fact that he had fallen for a person he had despised so much. What was even funnier was that Gabriel had showed up a few minutes before Sam with the same problem, and overheard everything he had said. Well, they got together. Now the two were here, five years later, getting married.
He could feel Castiel’s muscles moving from beneath his shirt, and he wondered what would happen if he were to massage it.
He ignored how his heart raced. He leaned back against the wall, hand still intertwined with Castiel’s.
The model looked down at his friend. “She was talkative and always knew how to make a good argument in class. She was a mischievous person too, always pranking people”
The man gave him a lopsided smile. “Awe! You would learn Braille for me? That’s really nice of you, Cas”
Castiel huffed. “Yeah. I was really upset, and I had no idea how to... cope. So that’s why you found me in that bar last night”
Castiel walked behind the counter, stopping about three feet away from him. He spoke, his voice trembling.
Dean smiled. He liked hearing Castiel ramble about his niece. The professor obviously loved her a lot.
And eventually, it was obvious. Dean would simply not move on. He would just get worse, become more reckless.
Castiel frowned. Dean seemed like he had been really affected by this too... he said that he used to know an alcoholic. Maybe that’s what has him so worried.
The model was beyond confused. Why didn't Dean flinch away? Why was he just lying here, on TOP of him???
“Bobby was.... patient with me. He allowed me to be a dumbass and sulk about being blind for a couple months. I kept asking him ‘what’s the point of doing shit when my life is over?’. One day, he took me on a walk around town. He asked me to listen to what was around me. Bobby taught me that the world was still there... it didn’t disappear, even though I couldn’t see it.”
The bartender opened his mouth to say something, but the plane shook. He shut his eyes tightly, gripping the seat in front of him.
The model looked down at his phone, scrolling through the infinite list of posts. He was looking for a certain photo.
The bartender grabbed a ring of keys, brushing past him and opening the door. He held it open for his neighbor.
“Dean? What are you doing up?” If the model’s voice was deep at day, night was an entirely different story. The gravelly voice actually shook him.
Dean and Meg were on the other side, each holding a bag of groceries. The latter had a massive grin on her face, looking up at the bartender with an evil glint in her eyes.
The girl went a flush of red, and she smiled brightly at him. “Woah, you’re really good looking! Wait—was that weird to say? It probably was—”
He walked over, sitting down next to the hunter. “It’s okay... I’m not here to talk about that though.”
“I’ve been working at the restaurant since I turned nineteen, but my brother and I inherited it from the previous owner when I was twenty three. I’ve been co-owning the place for four years now.”
Meg told Dean about the ‘Love, Lucifer’ interview. She explained how the host had outed Castiel as being gay, and how he showed the viewers a picture of him and Dean walking together. She told Dean that Castiel tried to defend him, and said that they weren’t dating, but no one believed him.
“Because I’m trying to—ughhhh. Okay, so Dean has a potential crush on someone, even though he doesn't know it. Gabe and I have been trying to make him bring the guy, but he is being stubborn.”
Sam laughed, running a free hand through his hair. “I know that look! You’re thinking about Cassie, aren’t you???”
It is late in the night when they are walking back up the steps to Dean’s home. He turns around to face Castiel, a shy smile on his face. “I guess you won the Coffee War then, huh?”
The man held his hand, and Castiel shook it. The bartender’s hand was calloused and firm, very unlike his own.
The alarm clock was stuck in the sad excuse of a wall. It fell out, leaving a fist-sized hole in it’s place.
I’m sorry for this post being a bit later than most. I deleted half of the chapter and rewrote last minute!
The model thought back to those green eyes and crooked smile. He couldn't help but look back over at Dean. He was over by the sink, washing off some dirty shot glasses. He looked like he was concentrating on something...
Castiel laughed lightheartedly. “They are good people. It’s nice witness such a real relationship...”
The bartender rubbed a hand over his face, already tired from the day. “How could this get weirder?”
Castiel’s voice rumbled like a storm, sending electric shocks through Dean’s body. Just the model’s breathing made his stomach flip with nerves. It had become his life raft, and he feared he would get lost without it.
He drove to the bar, rushing inside to avoid getting wet. He found Gabriel inside, sitting down in a booth by the corner. Unlike most days, the man had a grim expression on his face.
Dean could barely process what was happening. Castiel took another couple steps forward, bringing a hand to Dean’s jaw. He rubbed his thumb over the stubble. The model rested his free hand on Dean’s hip, fingers sneaking up under the hem of his shirt. he could feel the warm hand on his skin, his face heating up.
At first the Empty would just stand there, wait for the angel to sleep. Shortly after, the being started complaining. It asked how one insignificant man mattered so much. Castiel didn’t give it the satisfaction of replying.
Castiel offered Dean a gummy smile. “Yes, although the ‘monster’ in the book is drastically different from how we depict them today.”
Before Castiel could respond, the man had wrapped his hand around his upper arm. He hitched a breath. The hand was worn and calloused, the warmth from it radiating into the model’s skin. The look on his face must have been priceless, because other pedestrians were grinning at him.
The model sighed, holding the red flannel in his hands. He hesitantly draped the jacket over his shoulders. He couldn’t just leave it on the couch, right? He went to the bathroom to wash his face. Castiel looked at himself in the mirror, his bloodshot eyes squinting back at him judgmentally. He tried to drink some tap water, but it felt like he was chugging nails and razor blades.
The bar was relatively busy. People, including Karen of course, were chatting away about the endless list of local gossip.
Over the summer, Dean had learned to let go. He, for the first time, was able to forget about his fucked up world.
“Very smart, but also stubborn. She always disagrees with me in class. If I told her the sky was blue, she would try and convince me that it was actually grey. And she’s kind... despite her rough exterior, she is extremely caring.”
Castiel, once the door was closed, took a deep breath. He felt as if he was suffocating in Dean’s apartment. There was nothing but him and Dean, sitting across from each other. The attention had almost destroyed the model. But whenever he began to panic, Dean would shoot him a reassuring smile, or say something funny.
This was Castiel’s life. Being told what to do and how to act. Being a model was harder than most people knew.
He remembered what John was like before their mother had passed. He loved his children with all his heart. He was a great father... until Mary.
Yeah, Dean hates water heaters with a burning passion at this point. Quite frankly, he would rather chug a gallon of razor blades then ever have to deal with one again.
Almost immediatley he gets a response. The voice, like the last time he heard it, was accompanied by an inhuman accent. “Well obviously you are, you idiot.”
And that’s when he knew that it didn't matter what happened next. As long as Cas was with him, he would be happy.
Castiel was trying to keep his breathing under control. Some days he hated his job. In all honesty, he went into modeling so he could inspire people to be kind and gentle towards one another. Obviously, that is not how things worked out...
He grabbed Dean’s hand, wishing he could erase the entire conversation from his brain. “Come on. We don’t want to be late.”
Dean scoffed. “I don’t know if you two remember, but I’m blind.... so are you going to tell me who this guy is or what???”
Sam made his way over to help, but then paused. He turned to look at Castiel, a devilish smile forming on his lips.
Castiel hummed, and he began to tap on the glass again. “How long have you been working in the restaurant?”
Dean opened the door. He was just as handsome as the first day Castiel had met his, his emerald eyes and dirty blonde hair reminding him of summer.
Castiel spotted a black trench coat. Under it was a dark blue dress shirt and black slacks. Perfect.
The doors swung open again, and a group of college students walked in. They sat down at a booth, grabbing their own menus.
That rest of that night was uneventful.... or as uneventful as it could be. Once in a while Castiel would make a mistake, needing them to repeat an order or two. Despite this, the model was quickly learning.
He waited outside for a few minutes before the door opened. Gabriel looked up at him with a sly smile. There was a strange tone in his voice, as if he was amused. “Hey, Dean. You’re early!”
Castiel’s whole body felt like it was on fire. He looked bashfully down at his shoes. “It had better lighting up there.”
The moose jerked a thumb in Gabriel’s direction, talking to the model. “This loser, here, decided that taunting the deer was a GOOD idea. Ugh, now we have a dent in our car door...”
Dean mixed the delicious concoction he had created, popping the coffee cup lid back on. He set the drink back down on the table, shaking his head as he handed the hot sauce bottle back to Gabriel. He crept back to his seat and grabbed his things.
Castiel didn't let go of Dean’s wrist. Rather, he moved his hand down to accompany his. Their fingers were laced together.
He ignored the shocked expressions that his family wore, running a hand down his face. “Hell, I’ve loved you for a damn long time now. I just didn’t realize until it was too late. But I love you. I always have.”
Maybe there wasn't any hot sauce in the coffee. Dean brought the rim of the cup to his lips, cautiously sipping. It was... really good. There definitely wasn't any hot sauce that he could detect, at least.
Castiel stoped. “My apartment has the same architecture as yours, but I have all my furniture in different places.”
On his chest was... well, Dean. The man was practically sprawled on top of him, his left leg tangled between Castiel’s. His arm rested on the model’s chest, fist clutching his shirt.
Castiel obeyed, taking off the suit and climbing into the next. One thing he learned today? He hated shopping. A lot.
He then saw it. A new picture of Dean and him walking around town. There was another caption underneath the photo.
They got into the rental and sped off. Dean rolled his window down. The cold morning air rushed into the car, causing him to shiver.
Castiel did something he never imagined doing. He began to massage Dean’s shoulder. His fingers worked out a knot that had formed. His hands moved to the back of his neck.
Meg ruffled his damp hair, getting drops of shower water on Rowena. “He said he needed a break, right? You can’t just sit in the dark waiting for him.... you need to get back in the game!”
Dean shrugged. “Well, she earned about eighty bucks before the police showed up. Sam told me that he was scarred for life... Gabriel screamed when seeing her, running out of the bar. It was too much for them. Gabriel even offered me his eyes, saying that he would rather be blind than ever see her naked body again. Obviously, I refused. No way I’m going to scar myself with the image of a naked Karen running around my bar!”
His eyes then drifted to the sofa. It was terrifyingly minuscule, and would be too cramped for someone to sleep on.
He looked back at Castiel a couple times as he left the cafe, a sense of longing lingering in his chest. He barely got to talk to him today!
Dean’s face drained, his mouth slightly parted. He nodded, his words slow and sure. “I like it when you’re here.”
Suddenly Dean’s lips are crashed into his own. His eyes widen in surprise before he shuts them completely, locking lips with the man he loves.
A low voice, like the rumbling of a thunderstorm. It was firm and insistent, but not directed towards him.
Dean snatched it, glaring spitefully at Cas. After firing a quick message to himself, he shoves the phone back into the professor’s hands. Cas reacts with a low chuckle, sending chills down Dean’s spine. “I guess I will you be seeing you later tonight, then?”
I LOVE you all so much! The feedback on the last chapter was incredible. I really enjoyed reading about what the weather was like for you. It was so much fun, and I think I might ask other questions like that in the future!
Despite not being able to see, Dean was able to express emotion in his eyes perfectly. Right now, they were screaming ‘we are so fucking late’, the green masterpieces wide with concern.
The model felt his face burning. He looked back at Anna and Balthazar for emotional support, but they were already walking away.
I promise that the next one is longer! It will be the chapter that Dean and Castiel fly to Sioux Falls!
There was a chuckle, low and deep. Something that the bartender had been waiting (very) impatiently to hear. “Yes, I am rather hungry...”
He ran over and hugged a couple of them, leaving Sam, Dean, and Castiel behind. They walked towards the group of people.
Okay, fun question of the day: Have you ever played an instrument? If so, what? Did/do you like it? If not, what is an instrument you have always wanted to play?
A million thoughts raced in his head. What was next? Did Cas actually like him back, or did he do all of this just to win? Would they ever see each other again?
In a daze, he jotted down the neighboring town’s name and the cemetery’s location on a dinner napkin.
So, what’s your favorite book? (No pressure if you don’t want to answer of course. Just something fun to think about!)
Sam finally shows up too. He moved into a cabin down the road, often went on morning runs with his dog, and hung out with Dean every afternoon. Although it wasn’t quite home, the hunter was becoming content with the fact that he was trapped here.
Next thing he knows, he’s being suffocated in a hug. Sam crushed the breath out of Castiel, voice loud in his ear. “I can’t believe you’re not dead—
He wondered what it would be like to wake every morning with Dean. To roll over and be able to see those green eyes and freckles.
Immediatley the atmosphere changes around them. Even Sam was taken a back by Dean’s words. His brother avoided all the sappy drama that he could. Hearing him say something so openly was shocking.
These thoughts tore away at Dean’s sanity, keeping him awake until the sun rose. He THEN passed out, for about two hours. He woke to the sound of knocking at his door. Could that be...?
Charlie nodded. “It’s all too much! I can’t handle the stress anymore. Talking about how hopeless you are is making me miss Gilda!”
Castiel subconsciously hummed in agreement. He brought the drink to his lips, the cold water soothing his throat.
Dean was silent for a long moment, and Castiel thought that he may have fallen asleep. “Okay... I guess it wouldn’t hurt to get some shut eye.”
‘Gabriel’s Cafe’ was the best local coffee shop in town. It was always stocked with delicious pastries and, of course, a wide array of drinks. Dean would usually spend many of his mornings there. Hell, he even had his own spot! It was by the window, overlooking a clearing across the road.
Gabriel put his fist in his mouth, biting it. Sam grinned. It might not have been romantic, to say the least, but it’s a step forward... a baby step, but still.
Gabriel laughed, looking at them from over his shoulder. “That’s not the only reason your brother likes it, huh Deano???”
Cas shook his hand, nodding. A relieved smile replaced his concerned expression. “It’s nice to meet you. You have an... interesting brother.”
