He bites his lip and doesn’t know why it’s so hard, but it is. Asking for help has never been easy for him. Accepting help has never been easy either, except from John. “Do you think you could, you know, help me, Ms. Hudson?”
There was a “type three” customer, much rarer than type one or two. The employees always joked about these men, and they were
“Do you remember Will Andrews?”
*********
He hadn’t seen John in fifteen years. John hadn’t written him back after camp. He had abandoned Sherlock at the worst possible time in his life. Back when he was still innocent and unhardened. Sherlock had wept. And he had raged. And yet, somehow, he had also forgiven John.
“I’d like to watch you.”
“The sun is setting in the west, and we
Sherlock side-eyed Lestrade. This was not the typical response from Scotland Yard detectives, especially not those who had spent any time with Sally Donovan or Philip Anderson. The praise sent a ripple of pleasure through him."
“Don’t touch. Your cock is mine. Get dressed and come out.” The intensity of the vibrations goes down a notch.
John takes the dangling strap and, reaching down, lifts his testicles and slips the strap underneath so that the crotch of the Y is just behind them, then pulls the strap between his buttocks and attaches it somewhere behind his back. He takes a moment to fondle Sherlock’s ass and give his shoulder a gentle bite before turning him around.
Their salads come, and then their entrees. Sherlock is thoroughly enjoying the food and the wine. Before long, he feels a warmth in his stomach and a fuzziness in his head. He is also keenly aware of the harness beneath his shirt, rubbing his nipples when he moves. The fact that it’s a secret that none of the other diners know makes it all the sexier.
far Sherlock. If you were thinking I was going to leave you the car...”
“Dr. Sawyer, I think you’d better shut up now,” Wilson warns.
“Open it!” John commanded as he ripped open the man’s shirt. After attaching the defibrillator pads to his chest and turning on the device, John waited for the ready light. When it lighted, he pressed the charge button. The man twitched. John waited a moment and then shocked him again. And again. It didn't work. When John checked the man's pulse again, there was nothing.
Sherlock slides down and stretches out, resting his head in John’s lap and looking up at him. “Do people hassle you about it?”
But he’s not embarrassing himself. And that feels like a victory.
Despite himself, Sherlock tenses up, waiting for the first blow. The noise registers before the sting. He has no time to recover, because, unlike the last time, John’s hand falls like a metronome, quickly and with a rhythm that leaves Sherlock breathless and struggling to process the impact. The heat spreads uniformly across his skin, but it’s not registering as pain yet. Though he knows it’s impossible, he’d swear he can feel the texture of John’s palm and fingers. That touch is worth whatever after-effects he’ll face later. He wonders if that will change when he’s confronted with the paddle, and in a flash of insight understands the necessity of a punishment implement. It will put distance between the two of them, and the loss of intimate contact will be part of the punishment itself.
“What’s the matter with my husband!”
“I don’t wanna go back,” Johnny said, passing the joint.
“There are never any
During the struggle, John had been laser-focused on staying alive. The rest of the room had faded into the background, but now it came back into focus. Anderson stood over Baldy, sock in hand, ready to administer another blow, but the man was still.
“Yeah,” said Lestrade, passing him a folder.
“Oh, never mind all that, let’s get on with the entertainment,” Annie says. “Now, how much does the young man know? Has he received any instruction? Any playing?”
“We were talking on the way up about the whole drug theft thing and Jim and Dr. Sawyer.”
John draws his gaze from Sherlock’s lip and signals to the waiter, and Sherlock realizes he dreads the end of the evening. What if John is just another sleazy old man who wants to get off and get away? And maybe he thinks the meal is worth a blowjob. He might not even get cash for a fix out of the deal. John again waves, asking for the check. Sherlock looks over, and sees Angelo holding up his hands and looking insulted. He strides over, expressing his indignation with sweeping gestures at the very idea that he would allow the great Doctor Watson to pay for a meal in his establishment. Mama is at home scolding her grandchildren thanks to the “mani miracolose”, the miracle hands that fixed her heart. As if he would accept payment!
“Yes, come for me.”
touch.
Tentatively, John reached out and laid a hand on his arm. “Hey. It's going to be all right. We’ll find a way out of this,” he said, although he was not at all as confident as he sounded. “By the way…thanks for what you did a few minutes ago. Things were getting out of control.”
“We’ve got to get moving,” John said to the room. “If we can make it out of this building and to the outside, maybe we can find a road or people or
“The pouch is called a sporran. The rest of the outfit is, well, not so traditional, but it
John reaches up to kiss him. “Yes, you did. It’s late. Let’s get you cleaned up and in bed. I want to know all about it. How it was for you, but right now…” He hands him another juice box and reaches for a pack of wipes. Sherlock obediently sips his juice while John cleans his penis and the insides of his thighs with tender care. He wipes his hands and opens a chocolate bar. Breaking off a piece, he opens his mouth and Sherlock mirrors him obediently. John pops in the candy. “Let me go clean the sofa.”
The last students leave the classroom, followed by Ms. Hudson. She frowns. “Did I hear you say you might not go to graduation?”
“Am I going to die?” Stamford whispered as John unbuttoned his plaid shirt and pulled up the blood-soaked vest underneath.
She picked up on the second ring. “Hello. John, Is that you!”
“No matter what happened, you’ve got to tell us the truth, Sherlock. I’m sure you’re aware of just how serious the situation is. John and I need to know
“My dad wore a uniform like that at the auto shop, but his name was embroidered on it. So probably our guy works someplace that requires an ID badge,” Sherlock says.
The other inmates look at him with curiosity. He does look out of place here. For one thing, he seems to be the only one without tattoos. And the youngest. He finds himself wishing he hadn’t shaved to spite John this morning. At least he’d look a little tougher. His eyes dart around the cell, evaluating each potential aggressor and he tucks the notebook under his shirt.
“Sherlock, it’s been a long day for you,” John says. “Why don’t you go take a shower while I talk to Myc.”
“Making this move, we’re making a commitment to one another, you by coming with me, and me, by promising to care for you in a completely new environment. A semester at Cambridge isn’t going to be easy. Being in a new country isn’t going to be easy.”
“Oh, Sir ...” Sherlock gasps out.
Are they…dead? Molly asked.
was set with three silver rings on the front and one in the back. A pouch hung from the front rings by three short straps, all of it decorated with shiny metal studs. The back ring had a single plain strap, wider at the top and tapered to run between the buttocks like a thong and hold the pouch in place. Velcro secured the waistband and the thong to the back ring.
Sherlock ends the call and leans against the countertop, staring at the phone.
“Don’t. We’re almost to the hospital. We can talk later.” John takes Sherlock’s hand in both of his and presses it to his lips. Sherlock can see that there are tears in his eyes.
There wasn't anything that needed to be done.
, I... I didn't..." He dropped the gun and took a step back, covering his mouth. He wanted to look away, but his eyes were fixed to his dead friend lying before him. "I didn't do this... I-I
"Help's coming..."
"That man is insane, Sherlock. How can we believe anything he says?"
This command made the two men throw Sherlock to the floor. Moriarty straddled the detective, grabbing his messy dark curls, and started beating the back of his head against the floor as hard as he could.
"I want you out of here now!"
John didn't answer since he was out cold.
"Is that supposed to scare me somehow?"
"It has to be this way..."
Sherlock stepped closer to Moriarty. "You... You're the killer..."
"Let's go already, Sherlock."
"You care about me?"
Sherlock furrowed his brow and felt the pocket of his coat -- sure enough, he had somehow managed to slip out the knife from the hotel room without realizing it. He pulled it out and looked at it, not realizing that revealing he was armed in front of an already-alarmed psychologist was probably not the best move.
That reply actually seemed to make him think, and in response to that he for some reason looked John over with his pale blue eyes.
John started to cry as he curled up a bit.
"By all means, try to save him. I
Despite the death of the Sherlock in his dream, thankfully the real Sherlock was alive and well... physically, at least.
"I thought the kiss would snap you out of your flashback..."
"Yes, Sherlock?"
Sherlock briefly gave John a somewhat scolding look before Mycroft continued.
"He's got someone with him now." There was a pause, and Donovan suddenly began sounding somewhat frantic. "Oh, Christ. I need backup NOW!"
"We've met."
"Yes, but now it'll get boring for you."
He began to dream.
John kept his distance.
The restaurant was simplistic but almost romantic in nature. Sherlock took a seat at a table by a window and took off his scarf and coat. Upon seeing the famous man, the owner of the modest little restaurant seemed eager to rush up and greet him, but was preoccupied with another customer for the moment.
Sherlock remained asleep on the bed in front of him.
"John! Has Sherlock been here at all recently?!" He shouted.
He dialed the number, and as he brought the phone to his ears, he shouted, "Everyone shut up!" Then, he waited.
The second John touched the Consulting Detective, he recoiled and screamed. "
"Is he..."
But this time, there was nothing there. It was completely empty.
"Self-defense, that's what!"
"Sloppy work letting someone else torturing him."
Sherlock shook his head.
"Sherlock... Oh bloody hell, Sherlock!"
"Maybe another time. Wrong day to die, Sherlock." Moriarty pivoted around and looked at them over his shoulder. "Please do watch out for the sands of time, Sherlock...
"Alright..." Sherlock was beginning to slowly drift back into sleep.
He began to have a nightmare.
Gently as to not wake him up, Sherlock sat down on the side of the bed and turned his head to continue gazing at him.
"Yes."
"Oh my."
She beamed at him. "I love you."
Sherlock smiled a bit, though he initially tried to fight it.
"You'd be surprised how easily he changes his mind when he's alone." Sherlock replied with a small smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.
“It’s all right, I’ve got you,” said John. He counted the remaining steps. Twelve. He could do this. Taking a deep breath, he hoisted Sherlock over his shoulder, eliciting a cry of pain from the injured man.
John massages his legs, squeezing, kneading, almost pinching sometimes, and the deep pressure feels wonderful. Sherlock settles more deeply into the sofa, letting it take more of his weight, and allowing his thighs and calves to relax. John digs his strong surgeon’s thumbs into the loosening muscles, creating a warm sensation halfway between pleasure and pain. He moves up to Sherlock’s quads and then around to his hamstrings and back to his ass.
John moves Sherlock’s fingers and inspects the site. “Yup. That’s going to leave a mark. Maybe even a bruise.”
********
It's John's birthday and Sherlock wants everything to be perfect. And it is—almost.
“He really beat himself up about hitting a student, even if Jim was trying to get himself hit.” Sherlock leaves out that John had gone back into therapy after the incident, thinking that would be sharing too much. “When the whole drug theft happened, the thought that it might have been Jim crossed his mind, but it’s a pretty big leap from cheating on exams to the theft of narcotics. It’s hardly something you could go to the police with. And by all accounts, Jim had behaved himself since the incident.”
“Let’s try again. Your eyes are…”
SH:  I’m fine. np
She pours the other half for herself and crashes it into his, laughing like it’s the most hilarious thing she’s ever seen. He envies her lightheartedness and is very tempted to chug it. Then he remembers Greg’s advice and pulls out his phone.
“Sir,” begins Sherlock, a bit of desperation in his voice.
“Yessss, good boy. I want you so much. I’m going to wait until you’re ready, but god, I so fucking want you.” John grinds his hips into Sherlock.
“Not with you.”
“I stay up late.”
John met his gaze. “Yeah, told you, I went to summer camp. Back when I was seventeen. In New York. Don’t know why I remembered the honeyberries, though. It’s strange what things you remember and what things you forget.”
“I observed. Moriarty’s plan was clever. He knew about Eurus, obviously. Louise was the same age, the same build, the same hair. He even knew that she and I used to play Clue together. Oh, he had all the details. From Mycroft, no doubt. Moriarty wanted us to bond, for me to care about her. He used Magnussen as a test. To see if I was willing to let one of you die before he resorted to using her. When I let her die, it saved the rest of you.”
Sherlock is still trying to grasp the implications. “So no clothes.”
SH:    Can’t talk. Will call later. Supermarket?
. It takes another half hour for his heart to stop hammering inside his chest, and another half hour to drift to sleep.
John looks at him, mildly surprised, and says, “Priorities.” He walks to the door and opens it, but turns around. “Sherlock?” He waits.
“I’m not going to give you what you want, not yet. I’m going to get myself cleaned up and you are going to finish your work. Is your essay done? The one for the Common App?”
“Hold out your arms.”
The two guards had been neutralized, with at least one of them dead. There was no sign of anyone else. If there
He is frozen in place. He doesn’t have any idea what is happening but knows that whatever it is is bad. His mind races, trying to think of what he might have done. Maybe it’s his dad. Has something happened to his dad?
Sherlock takes a deep breath to say goodbye, but John’s already clicked off. Deciding to try the exercise route, he packs up his guitar, throws the envelope John gave him in the case, and heads off on his bike.
“...beautiful...good boy…mine…”
“No.”
“Did you oversleep? You didn’t answer my texts.”
Sherlock remembers the little room at the hospital where John had taken him for an afternoon quickie, and pictures John leading some pretty nurse inside, closing the door and…
Sherlock’s derisive laugh is almost a snort.
and the magnifying glass is a nice one, wood and brass, but not new. Sherlock guesses it came from a flea market or second-hand store. A lot of the things they owned came “pre-loved,” as his Mom liked to say. These gifts would have thrilled his fourteen-year-old self. He can imagine the hours he would have spent collecting and cataloging insects, making loads of notes and observations. He would have shown off his collection to Victor. And Victor would have been impressed. He always was.
On cue, Martha Hudson groaned loudly. “Ohhh!”
“Yes, doctor.”
Sherlock hears himself giggle. Not that long ago he felt like he’d never laugh again.
If that were the case, Sherlock might be right about the tolerance, but addicts were liars; you could count on that.
After he'd left the room, Sherlock went to his laptop and pulled up the online scheduling program for John's surgery that he'd hacked into. He confirmed that the last appointment tomorrow was for a routine examination. He'd call the patient, Ms Margaret Heatherstone, tomorrow afternoon and tell her it would need to be rescheduled. Then he'd cancel the appointment.
“Now, is anyone hurt?”
“I did. And that must have sounded good to you because you called me the very next day.” As John speaks, he traces the crop down Sherlock’s chest, down his stomach to his cock, which is rapidly swelling, dragging it over the length of it before dropping it lower and stroking it over Sherlock’s balls.
John dipped his fingers into the jar and scooped out a generous dollop of jam. With his eyes locked on Sherlock’s, he spread the jam over himself until his erection looked like a grape ice lolly. He extended his now sticky fingers to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock opened his mouth and enveloped John’s fingers. John closed his eyes. The inside of Sherlock’s mouth was smooth and warm, and he felt a tongue circle his fingertips as Sherlock licked away the jam.
“Oh, Will,” he pleaded, his voice cracking. “Don’t die. Please don’t die.” If only he had put the bottle in his pocket instead of the duffel.
Feeling stupid, he says, “What?”
“Good morning Sherlock!” Molly greets him cheerily with a Starbucks cup in each hand as he arrives at the lab on Monday at ten minutes to eight.
. Sherlock realizes that he never expected romance, has never considered that it could be part of his life. It feels good. His thoughts are interrupted when John says, “Let’s take care of the formalities.” Still holding Sherlock’s hand, he pulls him into the living room, where they sit on the sofa. There’s a pen and a folder on the coffee table, and Sherlock is fairly sure he knows what’s in it. John confirms his suspicion. “You’ve read it. Are you prepared to sign? I already have.”
“Of course.”
He hands the wine to John, who has kicked off his shoes and is reclining comfortably against the pillows. His eyes are pools of indigo set in his tanned face, and he has run his hand through his hair, making it stand up in the most attractive, unkempt way.
“Do you love her?”
His hand on his cock feels good but what he really wants is John. He wants to repay him for this day, this wonderful day, and for everything he’s given him. For every kiss, for every stroke of the paddle, for every kind word and stern admonition. But mostly for the lightness that he feels in his heart.
Sherlock panics a bit as he sees their eyes lock.
Sherlock groans at these words that travel straight to his groin, making him thrust his hips forward, pushing him harder into his fist.
“I’ve got an idea. When was the last time you had a bubble-bath?”
“Thank you. It’s...not mine,” Sherlock says cautiously, every cell of his body on high alert. Bracing for the inevitable. Wishing John would stop petting the damned cat and come to his side.
John isn’t having it. He pushes down on Sherlock's back and grabs the coiled rope. It makes the perfect handle, and he holds Sherlock in place. He pushes forward slowly and Sherlock sighs as fleeting pain gives way to pleasure and the exquisite friction of John’s penetration. He strains, wanting more, but John’s grip is strong, and his voice is stern.
Sherlock takes a deep breath. “Ms. Hudson always said that you need facts before developing theories, and we don’t have many facts, but I’ll take a shot at it. While I was in the cell, I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities. The lockers are basically made of tin, and if I had the chance to look at them, I could tell whether mine had been tampered with, but if it had been, it would have complicated the investigation and I wouldn’t have been arrested so quickly. You know what they say about coincidence.” He looks at John expectantly but gets only a headshake.
The taxi driver began to drive as he got another text.
"Alright. I hope they'll make it to him in time."
"Sherlock..."
"No, maybe joke's the wrong word. Everything is a game."
Sherlock looks confused. “I thought we were only going to take care of Saturday today, Sir.”
He has the sudden urge to go to John’s side, his rightful place, give his best icy stare, and show this intruder, this
Sherlock backed up a step and began again. "John, listen to me. I told you,  I don't want him. I never did. I want you. It's always been you. Always. Forever. You. Please believe me."
And he sat in the grass and watched the other boys running and laughing. Sometimes he wished he could fit in and be like them, but they were mostly interested in dull and unimportant things: sports, Pokémon, girls.
“Well, now I’m intrigued.”
“Go on, sweet boy. You’re too tempting.”
A line from the story he’d read on the plane, “Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,” came to his mind, “
“I hope I’m more than just a friend.”
“How many have you earned?”
He huffs out a breath in frustration. What is it that Ms. H sees other than a smart-ass kid with an aptitude for science or an anti-social introvert? What about what she doesn’t see? The son who’s a disappointment to his father, the drug addict willing to sell his mouth for a fix, and now, the submissive who wears a collar and is fucking sitting here with a vibrator in his ass? The science stuff is what he’s most comfortable with, and what he’d written about. It’s never been easy for him to open up, to share, and he can count on one hand the people whom he trusts, not even needing all his fingers. Yet now he’s supposed to write intimate details for some stranger to read? He opens the document with another sigh and starts to type.
“Oh, Sherlock, I had no idea it was so bad for you. I’m sorry that you’ve had to live that way. I wish you had spoken to me. But it doesn’t excuse the drugs, young man. That was extraordinarily stupid. You know that already, don’t you?”
John reaches inside Sherlock’s robe, clutches two handfuls of his ass, and pulls him in even tighter. “Mm-hmm. Two, anyway. Maybe a third for whinging. Just because I can. And because I like your arse pink.” He squeezes and Sherlock relaxes into John’s grip and grinds up against him.
She handed the Sharpie to Stamford.
“Anyway, that’s how I know that these are edible,” John continued. “And you haven’t eaten in days, so, as your doctor, I prescribe tundra honeyberries, morel mushrooms, plenty of water, two paracetamol, and
Sherlock is in the dressing room of the men’s department at Macy’s pulling on a pair of Levi’s. Half a dozen pairs of cotton shorts and polo shirts in various colors litter the floor of the cubicle. The jeans are a skinny fit in a dark wash. He’s had to go up an inch in the waist size from what he currently owns, much to John’s approval.
“You could be my crew—just you and me, up in orbit—and Eurus. I had to promise her I’d take her to space with me. Man! Won’t it be a blast looking down on all the pathetic earthlings?”
As he was trying to make sense of this, there was a jab to his shoulder.
He pulls the thin blanket further up over his shoulders and opens his eyes just a little. A discolored ceiling with a jagged crack is a few feet above.
Sherlock looks for a robe but doesn’t see one. “Is there something I can put on?”
“Because I belong to you.”
“This is going to be all over the news,” Lestrade said. “It already is. We’d prefer you to keep a low profile and not speak to the press. At least not yet. There’s a car out front that will take you to your hotel. We’ve already arranged your stay there for another two days. Ask for Simone at the front desk and use the name Percy Phelps. There’s a phone in the car if you’d like to call anyone to let them know you’re OK.”
In a low, husky voice, John says, “I like where you’re going with this.”
John removes his hand and gives him a slap on his ass, still tender from the paddle. “What did I say?”
“But how—"
John explains that the hour
Although he still couldn’t see him, John started putting a face to the man with manicured hands and expensive leather jacket. Spiked hair dyed blonde, maybe eyeliner. Handsome. Tom Cruise handsome. Looked tall too, the git.
. He pulled away.
Sherlock nods into John’s chest. “Yes, Sir. You were right. I do feel lighter.”
“Well done, Sherlock. Yes. I’ll punish you. Please count and thank me for each stroke.” Sherlock watches as John reaches around and takes the paddle from the seat underneath him. He slides it in a circle, startling Sherlock with its cool, smooth surface, and covering the area that has turned a rosy pink.
though.”
John comes out of the kitchen and looks suspiciously at the two of them. “What lies is she telling you? Don’t believe a word she says.”
“Stop it. I’ll be number one, and you’ll be number two, as usual.”
“Maybe you don’t want to be divorced.”
SH:   Yes
She looks puzzled, and Wiggy’s eyes go wide, but Ms. Hudson and Molly laugh.
Sherlock closes his mouth but remains speechless.
Sherlock looks at him with wide eyes and opens his mouth to protest, but John stops him with a finger on his lips. “Not a word. Rule number five. You’re brilliant, you’re gorgeous, and you have nothing to worry about. If I didn’t believe you could handle it, I wouldn’t bring you. Do you think I’d be seen with you if I weren’t proud of you?” He gives him a brutal kiss that leaves his lips puffy. “I can’t wait to see you in that tux. Martin said you’re stunning. In the meantime, I thought about clearing your tally today, but I don’t want a sore arse to distract you from the opera, so we’ll take care of that another time. But, I have decided what to do about the missing meals.”
“I, um, I jerked off.”
“You OK?” John whispers, kissing his temple.
********
His mother, a devout Catholic like the rest of his family, had asked him why his friend from camp stopped writing. He had made some lame excuse. Harry had been sworn to secrecy about John and Will’s relationship at camp, and thankfully, she never told on him. She had been old enough to understand the consequences of such a revelation.
“Y’know. Changed my mind. I don’t care.” John says, holding up a hand. “All I care about is Sherlock. You set him up. You planted drugs in his locker. Why?”
“Yeah, he’s smart, but drugs make smart people do stupid things.”
“Oh, sweetheart, look at you,” John says. He slides his hands up the back of Sherlock’s thighs and to his ass. Sherlock feels the softness of John’s hair between his fingers as John places a kiss on his cock through the cotton, then mouths it from the bottom up to the tip.
John comes up behind him and gently shoves him out of the way. He sticks out his right hand for Wiggy to shake and hands him a bundle, a T-shirt, underwear, and a pair of Sherlock’s old jeans, with the other.
“Just so you know. I wouldn’t normally follow a guy into his bedroom, but in this case…because you’re gay and all, I suppose it’s OK.” Her eyes are twinkling as she teases him.
I want. But I’m fairly sure I know
“Are you deaf? Get the fuck out of here.” Sebastian takes a menacing step toward him.
He puts down the skull and glances at the card again. “It’s all fine,” his mom had written. How different things would have been for him if he could have talked about his feelings with her. Had she suspected? At thirteen,
Sherlock braced himself against the onslaught and his face hit the door with each thrust until he tasted blood. Then he felt John grasp his hair and pull his head back, using it for leverage.

a plank put him at a definite disadvantage. He has been doing an awful lot of biking though, and John is not a big cardio fan. Maybe he can tire him out?
“That’s hideous,” he stated.
********
“You are scared of those push-ups, aren’t you? I think we’ll have to add some more incentive to your workout. Bring the crop down to the gym, what do you think?”
John laughs softly. “I don’t blame you, I’m just that sexy.” He kisses Sherlock’s forehead. “You’ve had to wait all night. I had you at Angelo’s, remember? I’m surprised you lasted as long as you did. You were fantastic. I—”
Finally, he shuddered and felt the release from his overfull bladder. “All right, John. The show’s on.”
“I never doubted. See you at graduation.” She gives them a cheery wave.
“Well, that
“The one that died?”
Sherlock answers grudgingly, “I will accept without argument, his guidance and punishment. It doesn’t say anything about complaining.”
“Which do you like best?”
When Scruffy returns, he hands back the water and says, “Wig.”
“I know, Dad.”
“Honeyberries.”
warning him again not to let anger cloud his judgment. “Oh, this conversation most definitely

. He clenches and unclenches his fists.
“Because it’s
Finally, John breaks the kiss and rests his forehead against Sherlock’s, breathless, hands still in his hair. “Sherlock, when I thought I’d lost you...When I thought maybe you’d...OD’d again. I went a little mad. I was so afraid, so afraid that you were gone without knowing.”
“Yeah.”
John softens immediately. “Oh, god, Sherlock, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t saying...I should have explained. You couldn’t have known what that means. I’m not playing about how I feel about you. I’m not toying with you. You’ve been so brave and given me so much in such a short time. I would never be casual with that gift. When I say playing, I mean playing with the power dynamics between us. Experimenting to see what you enjoy, what brings us pleasure, makes both of us happy. That part should be fun. But you can’t ever think that I’m not serious about you.” He takes Sherlock’s face between his hands. “Look at me. You believe me, don’t you? Fuck, please believe me.”
"You should have talked to me more about this, Sherlock."
Sherlock's eyes widened and his body tensed from the abruptness of the kiss. It only took him a few seconds, however, to seem to relax again, and he closed his eyes, awkwardly trying to return the kiss.
It appeared to work.
John sighed as he walked in with him.
"He gave me advice, but I don't know how well it will work."
"Mycroft... isn't the teasing type..."
He gulped and rammed his shoulder into the door to get it opened.
"I'm... working on that."
He heard someone walk past his room.
Again, there was no response.
"I would need to do all treatment at a hospital, Sherlock. Please don't tell me those are Mrs. Hudson's injuries..."
John didn't know to react.
"Sherlock?"
"C-correct."
The message carved onto the wall was eerie and intimidating. Had Sherlock written it, or was it written by someone else? And, for the record, where on Earth had the Consulting Detective even gone?
act!"
"Inspector, I have much to tell you." Watson started before he told the good Inspector everything that had happened.
Lestrade looked at John.
John nodded and took it.
"Ha ha, you really fell for it? It is only a signature, Dr. Watson. SH" Mockingly, the texter put Sherlock's signature. It dawned on him... It was impossible, but there was no other explanation... JM had to be Jim Moriarty's initials.
"Even if I offer up my pocket-watch?" John said as he took out the watch.
"I'll lose him no matter what..."
"That's why I wanted to help you."
John smiled as he kissed her again.
"Your arrival has nullified that."
"How?"
He slowly walked to Sherlock's hospital room.
"I won't hurt him anymore than anyone else."
The wound didn't look fatal on its own, but combined with the blood that still gushed from it, it looked really bad. There was no exit wound, implying that the bullet was still inside Sherlock's body. That would hurt, but nonetheless prevent extreme blood loss.
"It'll take some time."
He didn't fight it this time. He let himself wake up to try to live his new life. Starting with getting better after being shot.
"You may have just saved out lives, though."
Reluctantly, Sherlock agreed. As they left the interrogation room, Moriarty started to laugh again.
Sherlock was still in danger.
Sherlock stumbled back, pulling John along, until he was leaning back against a wall, his fingers running through the good doctor's short hair.
The shorter man continued the kiss.
What if he'd somehow made Sherlock feel even more determined to die than he already presumably had been?
He nearly screamed when John snuggled into him again.
"Are you sure the man with him won't come back?" She seemed strangely preoccupied with avoiding Magnussen.
He attempted to prop himself up. "J-John..." Trying to dismiss the pain he was in, he shakily took off his scarf and attempted to put pressure on John's wound to stop the bleeding.
Moriarty burst into insane giggling.
"Are you sure?"
been through a lot lately.
"Well then don't let him leave, not like this."
"Nonononono." Sherlock grabbed the door of the interrogation room and closed it, standing in front of it to prevent John from opening it. "John, don't."
He wanted to text back but he didn't want to blow his cover.
"I hope you can figure it out."
He got no further response.
"Are you jealous, Doctor Watson?" Magnussen asked as he continued to hold Sherlock's hand.
"You still didn't tell me."
The room was pitch-black but for a chair across the room illuminated by a lamp. Tied to this chair, with his head down, was Sherlock, however when he heard the door squeak open, he raised his head, revealing the gag around his mouth. Seeing John, a look of horror slowly emerged in his pale blue eyes.
John's warm embrace was helping him relax enough to fall asleep.
"Stop laughing, you evil bastard!"
"I'm fine, Inspector."
"You're still being stupid."
"Because if he was, he wouldn't have been able to push the detonator, because it's right here beside me. Aren't I a kidder? Ha ha!! - JMx"
He had to hurry.
John just sat there.
"It's time to move on, John." Even so, Sherlock seemed sort of sad. "Just because my time's over doesn't mean that yours has to be."
"Leave, Moriarty." Sherlock warned.
"You're safe around me... so please don't leave..."
After several minutes, he found one.
"Who did this person kill again?"
"We have to solve this case
He smiled happily and kissed her.
"Why? So he could use me as a cover again?"
"Isn't it? I think I'm the one in control here. Only I can call them off."
"Mark my words, you will pay for your crimes!"
Sherlock didn't reply to this, as he apparently had nothing to say.
Sherlock nodded, again disappearing into the interrogation room. There had to be something that they were missing.
"Then you and I will be ready for him."
"Yes, I... I knew that." Sherlock mumbled. He couldn't believe how much of a nervous wreck he had become.
"At least I don't rely on others to do my work."
"I will never give up on Sherlock! He never gave up on me!" he yelled back.
"Trying to be good has resulted in nothing but me getting mocked all my life and ultimately hurting you."
"What...?" Lestrade stopped. "N-... No, no, I'm... I'm going out there." Regardless of the comment, the inspector left.
John is standing motionless, listening with astonishment.
“No. Wait,” John said. “Then he stood and removed his jeans and pants.
Sherlock blows out a breath. “I’m sorry, Sir. I wrote you a song. I think it’s pretty good, and I hope that you’ll like it.”
hadn’t even suspected. Not really. But this note confirms what he’d always thought. That she would have supported him.
“You think. I’m upset? Because you’ve cried a couple of times? Tell me you’re joking.”
“Sherlock gave John a scathing look before stepping around him to exit the row. The hijacker grabbed Sherlock’s arm and pushed him roughly toward the front of the plane.

“I can’t sing.”
“I was...I was hoping we could take care of
Mycroft Holmes watched him silently.
John starts the push-ups and Sherlock watches his triceps and shoulders with admiration while he makes it look easy, racking up a nice round one hundred.
Sherlock sighs with relief, and John takes his hand and leans forward to kiss it. “I’m glad to hear you say that. It’s what I’ve hoped for you. Let me tell you what it means to me. When I see it on you, around your neck, it reminds me of the trust you’ve placed in me. It reminds me of my responsibilities to you. It represents your commitment to me.”
. And I’ve spent my life searching for that. I’ve had a hundred lovers and dozen failed relationships—"
********
John puts his mug down and sighs. “Mike’s got a big heart, but he’s also got a big mouth. Nothing may come of it and I didn’t want to get your hopes up.”
Molly: Smart, but a bit emotional.
“You’re right as usual. You always are. I’m going to miss you.”
“Nope. Five eight.”
“No, not tonight, love. If you are a good boy maybe next time. Tonight was for you,” John breathes into his mouth. Sherlock’s brain stutters.
Sherlock says, “Yes, Sir,” and picks it up gingerly. When he reaches the chair, he pauses and runs his fingers up and down the black leather shaft. It’s one of the longer crops that Rod carries, to suit the mostly little girls taking lessons. It’s all black from the wrapped handle to the braided rod and the flat tip. It’s a beautiful object, and the smell of leather is intoxicating. He sighs as a mental image of John holding it comes to him. Intimidating and erotic in equal measure.
Molly brought their drinks, and John ordered the chicken.
? hangs in the air. Dominating the room are three green cylindrical tanks, taller than John and fitted with various gauges and controls.
He wondered if Will had become a pilot or an astronaut. It wouldn’t surprise him. Not in the least. He’d had no contact with Will after camp. Although Will had written to him. A lot. When the first letter arrived in the post, John had tossed it in the rubbish bin without opening it. And the next one, and the next one. Finally, after six months, they stopped.
“It’s my fault.”
“Yes?” Wildly, he thinks about turning and running and lets out a sound halfway between a laugh and a sob.
“Now, push.”
“Just taking a summer prep course right now. I’m mostly interested in Chemistry,” says Sherlock, slightly embarrassed.
“Whatcha doing?”
“Pay attention, John! Which do you like best, the sunflowers or the gardenias?” Mary tapped her finger on the photos that lay spread on the kitchen table next to his breakfast plate and the brochure for the medical conference he would attend this week
“Yes, really. You seem surprised.”
causes him to look down.
“Is anyone else blaming you?”
“I have a concern, Sherlock. Do you have any idea what it might be?”
“Nothing, I’m clean.”
“Come on, Sherlock. Let me take off your collar so you can shower and get ready.”
John threw back his shoulders and looked the man in the eye as a cold rage washed over him. He could take this man. He was sure of it. And he absolutely
But he feels compelled to comply. He has black slacks he can wear. But he guesses that means a button-down...the purple one is his favorite. And it has long sleeves so it will hide his forearms. He pictures John, in his Nike tee shirt and tight jeans. Pictures the riding crop, held easily in John’s hand. He lies back on his bed and closes his eyes. His whole body feels electrified, oversensitive. He unbuttons and unzips his jeans, reaches between his legs, and begins stroking his hardening cock, thinking of John Watson.
“I promise,” Johnny replied. And at the time, he had meant it.
John pauses and picks up the bottle of oil, this time dripping it over Sherlock’s ass cheeks and between them. Scooting back, John runs his hands over the flesh, gripping and separating, moving in rythmic circles.
Sherlock is positively vibrating, his relief, and the effects of the speed and caffeine rushing through his blood like a river in flood. And now he’s got nothing to do but wait for John to call. All of his anger has dissipated, and he can’t wait to tell him that he’s sure he passed and that chemistry is a done deal.
Sherlock is silent for a while, unsure of what to say. He doesn’t want to talk about Victor, but there is a part of him that longs to bring it all out into the open. He’s never talked about what happened with anyone, not about what
“Did you see a note or anything?”
“Yes, you can. I hear you pretending to be Elvis in the shower all the time.”
“Should I be?”
He inhales deeply and is just starting to exhale when he hears the “whoosh” followed by “crack” and then a searing pain on the back of one thigh, and his breath rushes out with a grunt.
Sherlock shoots him a wounded look, and John says “Myc—”
“It’s not like that. Well, it is like that, but it’s OK.”
“Yes, Sherlock, do it. Fuck me.”
The two men rose to leave.
Sorry it's been a while since we've updated. January was an incredibly busy month for both of us.
spent his eighteenth birthday.
“This young man is the smartest, most interesting person that I’ve ever met. One day, you’ll read about him. You’ll brag to your friends that you knew him. You will be ashamed of yourself for your small-minded bigotry. I pity you. I really do. I’m proud to call Sherlock Holmes my boyfriend and neither of us gives a toss what you and your little band of losers think.” John pulls Sherlock to him and plants a kiss on his lips, then turns and walks away with Sherlock in tow, leaving the girls speechless.
“Whoa! Slow down, sweetheart! First, I want to tell you how proud I was to be with you tonight. Did you mind me introducing you as my boyfriend?”
“Sherlock.” John’s voice is steady and reassuring. “Trust me?” Sherlock turns his head to meet John’s eyes and nods, holding his breath. He feels like he’s been punched in the gut, but John is so calm.
John looks angry and seems to take a moment to collect himself. “Tell me exactly what you want.”
“Oh, I um…pulled a muscle,” Sherlock mumbles as he texts John.
“All work and no play, I promise.”
John is talking about him with Myc. What is John not going to tell him? As he’s standing frozen outside the door, it suddenly opens, and John is staring at him in surprise.
“Mouth a little dry?” John smirks.
“Oh!” John says. “What a cutie. You go ahead and pay.” He bends down to oblige the creature.
“Excuse me; what?” The intrusion of reality confused John momentarily.
Molly looked distraught. “I’m so sorry, sir! She reached into her pocket. “I hope these will tide you over. She pulled out two packages of peanuts and a package of pretzels and handed them to John before retreating hastily with the spoiled food to the front of the plane.
Sherlock lets his limbs be arranged and tries his best to follow Annie’s instructions. It’s a slow, painstaking process with John asking questions and sometimes having to redo a particular knot several times to get it right. As Sherlock’s movement is more and more restricted, a strange calmness settles over him. The ropes are tight, but nothing hurts. The gradual surrender of his body and the accompanying surrender of his mind are welcome in a way that he doesn't fully understand. He wants to understand. He should analyze it. He should...
He’d hope it was just a dream, that the whole last year had been one long awful dream, but when he was fully awake, Victor would be dead, and the guilt of unsaid words a crushing weight. Other times he awoke, and the clatter of noise from the kitchen or the smell of cigarette smoke told him that his father was indeed still alive and that the terrible things he’d done in his dreams were just that, dreams.
“Look at the sun, John.”
“Let me call the flight attendant, get you a drink.”
Sherlock uses his free hand to grasp John’s right calf, and he presses his face against it. Extending his tongue, he licks, starting just above the sock and moving upward in short, firm strokes, up to the inside of John’s knee and then to the sensitive skin of his inner thigh, tasting the dried sweat, reveling in his scent, moving closer and closer to the prize. Biting, sucking, licking, he arrives at John’s testicles and pulls one into his mouth, rolling it on his tongue while stroking his perineum with a finger.
He doesn’t count the blowjobs he gives for cash to get high. They’re necessary business transactions. He grimaces at the thought and pushes it aside.
John gulped and tried to maintain a stern face. He was, in fact, still angry,
“Doctor Watson,” she replies, “I am impressed. You’ve been doing your homework.”
“Trays!”
They watched telly for a while, without conversation, then went to bed.
John pushes Sherlock’s dripping curls from his face and shakes his head, frowning. “Why? Didn’t you enjoy it?”
“I’m sorry. No, Sir.”
“Sherlock!”
SH:      Sucking you.
Her freckled face is thoughtful as she studies him with sapphire eyes, then her head drops back and there’s that full-throated laugh again. John shakes his head and gives him a look, like he’s proud of him but simultaneously adding to the tally board. He knows he’ll pay for his smart mouth later, but it’s almost worth it.
Instinctively, he launched himself at the man, and they tumbled to the floor, fighting for the gun. The struggle lasted only a few seconds, but to John, it seemed so much longer. The man was larger than him, but John was strong and agile and well trained. Unfortunately, his skill couldn’t overcome the sheer size of his adversary, and Beefy ended up on top of him.
“What about the OxyContin, Dr Watson?” She raised an eyebrow.
“The sun sets in the west. If we were on the east coast, the sun would set over the trees, not the ocean,” Sherlock said.
John kneels and grips Sherlock’s erection, then slides back the foreskin before taking the head into his mouth and sucking lightly. Sherlock sees stars when his head snaps back and smacks the glass.
“Wait, Dad’s here?” Sherlock says.
“I don’t know. I’ve been aware of his drug use for the last two years. He knows he can’t easily hide things from me. I expect it’s one of the reasons he wouldn’t stay in DC and always came back here. But, despite my misgivings, I can’t remember him doing this well, since... I just never thought him capable of something like this. It’s not him. It doesn’t feel right. He’s smart, and this was really stupid.”
“Hard, wasn’t it?”
The voice came from Sherlock’s brother, who had risen from his seat. His face was flushed, and sweat shone on his forehead.
John is behind him and then there is a hand on his hip, and it slides around to his belly as another one grasps the plug and gives it a tug.

”I’m on my way. Ten minutes. Will you be all right till I get there? Ten minutes.”
She opens the zipper, and with a flourish, pulls out a coil of red rope. She reaches in again and again, piling up more and more coils, some bright-colored and others in varying shades of natural tans and browns. “I brought hemp, nylon, and your favorite, coconut rope.” She hands some hanks to John, who fingers each one before passing it to Sherlock, who has already begun his analysis.
“I’m not, John. There isn’t time. Will you touch my hair?”

Or dripping cold water on him, which makes him jump. His mind is completely empty of anything but what his nerve endings are sending it and the more and more urgent throbbing between his legs.
Myc is silent, and Sherlock holds his breath.
Without thinking, John joined him, and they sang the last line of the Camp Kanawha anthem together.
Lestrade nodded in agreement. Perhaps, though, if he could talk to Moriarty... It was a long shot, but maybe he could get the truth from the criminal.
As Magnussen said that, John could feel Moriarty press the barrel of a pistol against the back of his head.
"You should get some rest, John." He changed the subject abruptly.
From what he knew, Lestrade had seen the scene inside. It was an absolutely insane theory to believe, and probably not even true, but really, what other hope did he have?
"I... Yeah..."
"But why?"
He sadly wheeled himself home and went inside where the silence was deafening.
He ignored him as he wheeled himself out.
"Why... did you hug me just then, anyway?"
"To stand here, think, and listen to your voice." Sherlock replied in a distant tone.
Sherlock sipped some of his own. "It's decent." He said.
"All of them..."
"Oh, he's... To say the least, you'll know him when you see him. What do you say, Sherlock?"
"I did, Sherlock."
, John-!" Sherlock suddenly grabbed John and started shaking him. "Don't you
"No, you did," Sherlock conceded. "It may have been for your own good, but I don't think I had a right to leave you out of my plan."
Sherlock's stomach grumbled, but he paid it no mind.
"Where is Sherlock? Do you have any idea where he is?"
Though he seemed to be trying to hide it, he did appear a bit annoyed. "It's not like Sherlock was working alone, either. It was only fair that I have a 'partner in crime' for a small amount of time."
"We need to what, Sherlock?"
John didn't try to get him to eat.
"Is that so? Well... That's good to hear."
He didn't want it to end. He fought to stay asleep.
"Sherlock?"
"Closure? On... Sherlock?" Lestrade frowned.
"I guess you mean a lot to me too, John."
"You look panicked..."
"We should... get some more rest..."
"Thank you, John."
"I know, Sherlock."
Sherlock silently looked down.
"What makes you think that?"
So was the good doctor.
"For Sherlock. I mean... What if he doesn't wake up?"
The good doctor sighed and finished his breakfast.
"I'm going in."
"And you got a proper goodbye out of it," she added.
." He put subtle emphasis on '
Thinking he was about to wake up, Sherlock gasped and stepped back, hiding the knife behind his back.
Sherlock raised a brow, blatant in his disbelief, but he let it slide. "Well, if that's done, then let's get this over with." He turned to enter the subway, not knowing that if he went through with his idea, he'd end up shot.
"Want me to get the nurse?"
"... Do you hear that?"
Sherlock examined him with a puzzled look on his face; he knew something was up with his partner, but he was no longer entirely sure of what.
"H-how bad is he...?" he asked as he voice broke a bit.
"He wouldn't think I'm nuts..."
" He called, not unlike one would call for their beloved pet dog. "There's a visitor here to see you!"
If only he could have a second chance.
"But how much?" He asked.
"No, wait! Please, hold on." Sherlock didn't often say 'please'. "He's our only hope to save the others. He might be my only hope to save you for all I know."
"When?"
"This means HE is still out there and Sherlock is still in danger."
." Lestrade grumbled.
Sherlock gave John a quick peck on the cheek before he turned to leave the room.
It was a long shot, but maybe he could use Lestrade in some way.
John didn't do anything.
John's hopes and heart sank like a stone as he shook his head. "No. He's the reason you can't remember."
Sherlock, not noticing, stood and limped towards a door across the room from John. The limp was not doing any good in helping hide much.
The presence of another armed man behind him prevented him from going very far. The culprit stepped closer, the barrel of his gun now inches from John's forehead.
Sherlock smiled a bit.
Moriarty extended his hand, reaching out toward Sherlock. He held a gun, but he wasn't aiming it as much as he was offering it. "Come on, Sherlock."
John stood up and walked out.
"You need sleep as well, Sherlock"
"Your name, for one. Other than that, he kept making... deductions, I guess... but none of them made sense."
John nearly fainted.
"Hold on. Sherlock is acting rather rude. He's got me at knife point." The fact that he was still texting John at this point was... somehow not surprising, considering Magnussen.
And then he drifted off to sleep.
"Because we're social creatures, Sherlock. We need one another."
"Sherlock, that's not what you told me earlier."
Lestrade raised a brow at the man. "Where are you going?"
He quickly stepped back. "What are you doing here?"
"I'm not sure, Sherlock."
"So what do we do now?"
"Yeah..."
He grumbled as he went in.
"And that would be?"
. Anyway, I think I've had enough fun for one day. I'll leave you two to whatever the heck it is you two do for a while, but try not to miss me too much, 'cause I will be back." The culprit walked past John, and with his men leading him down the hall, he turned back before the stairs. "Oh, and by the way, Dr. Watson... The name's James Moriarty, but you can call me Jim. Smell you later~!" Just like that, Moriarty left.
He hoped.
"Bring it on, doctor. Just keep in mind that if you try anything stupid, I will hurt Sherlock."
They heard a loud noise not far outside.
John was lost for words.
John's face paled as he wheeled back.
John wished this moment would last forever.
"And it
"Sherlock, please close the gown." he said, blushing.
As Sherlock continued, he almost seemed to have a little bit of emotion on his face, which was strange. "I... I just want you to know that if at any time you need to leave, you can. You don't even have to come with me this time if you don't want to."
The Inspector nodded.
"Sherlock, you can tell me anything."
"It isn't. Don't be stupid."
"I don't know! I came home to the flat and saw it was wrecked so I went to the landlady to check on her and her flat is in ruins as well!"
"Where are you going?"
"I'm..."
Sherlock said nothing this time.
"Greatly appreciated, Magnussen. Nice doing business with you. Talk soon." Sherlock dropped the call.
"Well."
"Yes, he did."
"How?"
"Have a good night, Dr. Watson."
"Wouldn't count on that!" Sherlock hollered from inside.
Sherlock stopped playing and looked at him. "Yes?" He sounded casual and unassuming.
"That's not like him."
Startled by John's yell, the nurse ran off to do as she was told. Magnussen calmly walked past John toward Sherlock.
"There has to be a way to beat him, Sherlock."
Sherlock jumped to his feet.
"John..."
"Well, I mean... No, it's... nothing. Let's go get something to eat."
"Cases to solve and someone to share them with." He muttered.
"The killer is going to find me himself." He said this boldly, apparently not realizing or just not caring that such a prospect was horrifyingly dangerous.
Then again, part of him was in denial. Perhaps it was just some sort of act! Sherlock could find a way to fake suicide... but Moriarty would've seen right through it, wouldn't he?
The Detective then frowned a bit, as his head still hurt.
"Very good, Sherlock... You won't regret this."
"I understand."
"What's going on?!"
"You and those idiots might need one another, but I only need two things." Sherlock mumbled as he turned his head away and looked out the window.
"You know I always speak the truth, Sherlock."
"Don't you dare say I'm one."
"I'm sorry for leaving. I love you. Magnussen is coming back, I have to go."
"To check up on you, for one. But that's not really my concern as much as it is someone else's."
"That cruel man..." he grumbled under his breath.
"You mean he could?"
Sherlock started yelling weakly.
Lestrade gave John a helpless look.
"Shortly after the incident with Magnussen..."
"I've hurt John..."
"Sherlock, you just need some rest."
"What?" Sherlock finally looked at John. He was clearly somewhat out of it, probably due to the morphine in his system, but he was alert enough due to this accusation to pay attention. "What do you mean?"
"... You still don't think I'm crazy, do you...?"
"Bastard!"
"I'll protect you."
He could hear what sounded like Moriarty clapping.
"You just had to make everything boring, didn't you, Sherlock." Moriarty said as he lift his gun and began beating Sherlock across either temple with the butt of it.
"What?!"
The woman smiled as she offered him a seat.
"There's no time to explain. We've got to go, now." He said.
John couldn't breathe. He couldn't believe his eyes as they welled up a bit. "Sh-Sherlock...?"
Sherlock feigned a small smile. "I'm fine, John." It was an outright lie, but had good intentions.
"Where's Sherlock?"
"Are... Are you... okay...?"
Sherlock sat by him awkwardly.
Sherlock jolted upright in bed with a short cry, now awake.
He nodded and went back to sleep.
"What did he do?"
He felt alone.
"Though, it seems you're happy because you're miserable." Despite the contradictory nature of his words, Sherlock continued, "Do I want to know what happened?"
He heard a text alert sound from his phone.
"Too much...! Too much, too much, TOO MUCH-...!"
Sherlock seemed to become nervous as they stepped inside.
"Our killer is likely faking being a rookie to get my attention. It's working. Now, if they are not a rookie, they likely have accomplices to keep an eye on targets, and whether or not they are leaving. I would be their current target, it would seem. If I were to attempt to leave London by subway, they would know.
Moriarty shrugged. "If you've made your decision, then it's all covered from here. We're done here."
"Wait, Sherlock. He's trying to break us completely."
John did the same.
"So you and Moriarty got what you both wanted; the death of Sherlock Holmes."
"John, make him shut up..."
"I remember everything b-by storing it in certain parts of my Mind Palace... that way I can find it again... but, I... Everything's different... I'm... lost in it..."
"Well, I mean, it's not like anyone's outside to stop us."
"Are you sure?"
"Sniper." Lestrade said. Sherlock didn't seem pleased about being rescued.
Sherlock seemed to be growing weak. His quivering slowly began to stop.
She smiled back at him.
"Who are you?" Sherlock called down the hall.
"He told me he didn't rape you because you let him do what he did and liked it!"
"No it's not, Sherlock!"
"You really don't think I'm stupid...?"
"John..."
"Oh, honestly, nowhere yet. He's in the back of this car. Well, in the trunk."
"Come." Sherlock entered.
"... You may have to lead the way. I have no idea where we are right now."
"Oh my God. John Watson...
John smiled back at him.
He quickly called Mycroft.
Sherlock reached to grab him, but instead found himself alone in the room with his hand against the floor. "A hallucination with intent to cause harm should never comment on its own nature." That said, he glanced back at John. He had been slightly rattled, nevertheless, by the realization that he had to be careful around John, lest the ex-army doctor deem him crazy.
"Please tell me!"
"Sherlock! What did you find?"
And Moriarty had the nerve to blame that on him!
"What do I have to do?"
The voice wasn't disturbing John as he slept.
"I think you better stop before someone phones the police."
"You called?! How many of them did you tip off?!"
"I said shut up!"
"Yes, Sherlock?"
to be
"Run! You can't take him! Just run!" John yelled into the radio.
John sighed as he shook his head.
However, it was no use. When he opened his eyes again, he was staring up at the bedroom ceiling... alone.
And he was too worried about Sherlock as well.
John rolled over and hugged Sherlock.
"It's... I think..." Sherlock cut himself off with laughter. "I think it's a red herring, John. Ha ha ha... You know, it could even be you. It could be Lestrade. It could be Molly bloody Hooper, even. At this point, who knows?" He laughed more.
Sherlock averted his eyes. It simply wasn't in his nature to admit when something so "trivial" in his sense was bothering him. "It was... unsavory."
Would that even be possible at this point? Sherlock was so far gone, after all...
John quickly jumped out of bed and ran for the bathroom. "Sherlock, are you alright?!"
"I don't have one." This was probably the most alarming thing Sherlock had said in a long time.
Sherlock shot him a surprised look.
It sounded unbelievable that Sherlock could completely flip if they didn't rescue him in time.
"Fine, then start telling them to fall back!"
John then sat down.
It was then that he began to awake from the dream.
John couldn't wait any longer and ran towards the car. "Let him go!" he yelled at him.
"I can't believe what I'm hearing come out of your mouth, Sherlock."
"He'll be safe."
"Hmm? Yes, Sherlock?"
"Sherlock, please just rest."
"Don't..."
Sherlock swallowed hard. "John would
He began to treat the wounds the best he could.
"Sherlock...?"
"I don't think Sherlock was supposed to have a choice!"
"Wait, Inspector. You should also have a guard for Mrs. Hudson when she gets to the hospital. Whoever did this might come back to finish the job."
"They must have broke him..."
He nodded and started to run.
The good doctor then started to cough harshly from the yelling.
, John." Sherlock said in a solemn tone. "I'm not sure for how much longer I'll be able to..."
"No..."
"Live long, John." The Consulting Detective replied, trying to keep his voice steady. "Find yourself a companion to spend the rest of your life with."
"Just checking."
"Inspector, I hate to say this but she's as good as dead by now."
Sherlock thought more a moment. "What are we talking here? Beaten into disability? Into mental handicap? Into mental disorder? Into death?"
"What do you mean?"
But John didn't kiss back.
"Sherlock wasn't there. - JMx"
And he hoped he would get there in time to save Sherlock.
It rung twice, then Magnussen answered. "Mr. Holmes," he greeted.
"Please don't let it be Sherlock..."
"He has to do this on his own."
John continued to sleep.
Lestrade let out a heavy sigh, then said, "Sherlock, I'm going to turn my back, and you're going to escape out from under my nose, alright?"
"Yes, John...?"
"I'm pulling up blanks as well."
Sherlock kept thinking. "He can't possibly have covered all of his bases, could he?"
"Okay, Sherlock."
"When I find Sherlock and we catch you, it'll be game over for you."
John then hugged him close.
The culprit smiled and began to press down on the trigger.
"Sherlock...?"
Sherlock nodded at Moriarty. "I've made my decision." He said. "Now tell me how I choose."
For a moment, an awkward silence lingered between them.
"No." After a brief pause, he mumbled, "... Maybe."
"How about
They were taken to the police station, where Moriarty was waiting in the interrogation room.
"Goodbye, Sherlock."
John gently rubbed his back.
"Our victim was beaten by someone, and she was cut with a stainless steel kitchen knife. She walked here, but God knows why."
"Are you sure?" Lestrade asked.
"Scotland
"John...?"
"Just what?"
He fell silent, not quite conscious.
"Moriarty is a tough nut to crack."
"I understand."
"Hear
"Alright, Inspector."
Sherlock continued the kiss.
"Relax, Sherlock."
She gave him some medication then left the room.
John felt happy as well.
Magnussen again walked past John, this time placing his fingers on Sherlock's cold hands. "Even still, his hands are as soft as that of a woman."
Sherlock stopped mumbling.
"We'll be waiting in a building on William Morris Way. Tick tock, Dr. Watson."
"I had no choice but to surrender... I couldn't take the risk..."
"Alright, Sherlock." he sighed as he laid on the bed.
"What we normally do, for as long as we can."
"Mind if I look at the mark on your neck?" he asked.
"I'm not sure..."
Meanwhile, the whispers continued to torment Sherlock, though he did his best to hide it.
John gently held him. "I'm right here. Don't be scared."
"No!" Sherlock said. "No, I... I do want to go through with it, it's just... I have a bad feeling about this."
"Well, I am." said Lestrade. "I need to find out if he remembers anything before he falls unconscious again."
Sherlock was still snuggled against him.
As he waited, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen, presumably still in the flat.
John sighed a bit.
"Why?"
"You're the cause of it."
There was the sound of gunfire on Donovan's end.
"Oh, good."
He smiled in his sleep.
"Yes, Sherlock...?"
Sherlock leaned against him heavily for support.
"I'm...
"You know, John," the Consulting Detective clasped his hands under his chin, "If you know so much about the future that would have occurred if you hadn't blown the case... What became of us?"
Sherlock smiled a little.
"It's a wonder she hasn't thrown you out yet, Sherlock." sighed John.
"He wants to see Dr. Watson..."
John smiled at him as he got off him.
It was a delusional thought, but Sherlock had to be alive. He worked on logic despite his heart; he wouldn't kill himself so easily. He just had to find a way to get the truth out of Moriarty.
Sherlock seemed to have an idea, but then he dismissed it.
The Consulting Detective screwed his eyes shut until he heard, as if his ears weren't covered and the source was whispering right into his ear, Magnussen's voice.
"You can tell me, Sherlock."
He tried to quicken his pace.
"Why should I believe a word you say now?"
"... So. How's the hunt for a '
"John..."
"Mycroft wouldn't be interested in our plight. There's no reason to bother with him." Sherlock countered. "There
John sighed again. "I'll go get more."
"Oh, you're back soon," teased the criminal.
He was trying to grab John.
"We've always stopped him in a lot of his crimes."
"Sorry, Sherlock."
Sherlock shivered a bit, and Magnussen leaned down somewhat, kissing the man's forehead.
The good doctor turned over again and snored.
"Now I know something is wrong with you."
John gently placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Are you upset because I didn't arrest Magnussen? Look, I'm not happy about it either, and if I can, I'm going to find a safe way to get him locked up."
Sherlock pantomimed playing a violin for him, but soon stopped, as he hadn't yet fully remembered his passion for playing the violin.
John hoped for the best.
Sherlock stepped out again, closing the door behind him. He walked over to John so that he didn't have to shout.
He sighed a bit.
"I love you, Sherlock."
John leaned forward as well.
"You mean... he's in your head...?" he asked in concern.
There was more gunfire from the radio. It sounded as though Donovan was somehow managing to hold her own. "The freak is being held hostage!" She shouted. "I repeat, the freak is being held hostage!" It would seem as though Sherlock was not the one firing at Donovan.
He couldn't help but think about what would happen if he didn't get there in time.
"Yes, Sherlock?" he answered as he turned.
"So?"
John carefully looked at the mark.
It was no use; he was too restless.
"You're a brave man, John Watson. Either that, or you're just an idiot." The taller man joked lightheartedly as he got into the taxi and mumbled an address to the driver.
John then aimed the gun at him.
"We're not sure. But we determined that the rest of his wounds were probably also self-inflicted... All of the blood on him and the knife was his own..."
"I knew the victim as well, better than you did. I think I feel something because of their death, but I don't know what it is. But I can't just leave the crime scene like you can if I start thinking too sentimentally."
Sherlock leaned his head against the window and covered his eyes with his hand as if he was tired. "You deserve better than her, John."
Silently, Sherlock showed John his phone. The text said, "Baker Street, now. Took your landlady out for a night on the town. Nice flat you and John have here. Damn shame."
Watson nodded and hailed for a taxi.
He dialed Sherlock's number and tried to call him.
Whether or not this was accounted for in Sherlock's 'plan' was unknown at that particular moment.
Beside him, Sherlock turned in his sleep, his back now to John.
"Call me back if he doesn't help."
He ignored him.
Still, nothing.
He just had to find out just to have peace of mind.
"Yeah, me too."
Sherlock adjusted his scarf gently. He had said on the phone that Magnussen had left a mark on his neck...
John continued to sleep.
In fact, the culprit appeared to be right; the more he spoke on this topic, the more nervous Sherlock seemed to become. The Consulting Detective was now even quivering slightly.
"Sherlock, calm down!"
"I would, if my brain would shut up."
"What did he say?"
Sherlock still hadn't touched his.
"Yes. Yes, I'm fine." Sherlock answered, however too quickly.
Magnussen might use their leaving Sherlock's side to his advantage and return to the unconscious Consulting Detective.
"Now, where would someone like him have gone..."
"Damn..."
"Tell me it. We'll run it through the system and see if we can figure out who it belongs to."
John looked up at it as well.
He quivered in uncertainty, physically ready to thrust the knife down, but still emotionally debating whether or not he wanted to.
The Consulting Detective began pacing. "I'm just relieved that he didn't shoot us."
John sighed in relief.
Donovan poked her head in. "Inspector?"
"What is it, Sherlock?"
Sherlock began coughing and gasping for air.
"A complicated plan involving some help. I couldn't tell you. I wanted you to move on, and thankfully you did."
"I suppose it would be in my best interest to do so," Sherlock answered. He seemed somewhat nervous, but ultimately more emotionally stable than he had been since the case began.
"So do I... I never would've thought that something like this would happen to Sherlock."
"E-eh... Y-you... I..." He seemed to be thinking of some clever rebuttal, but wasn't able to come up with anything on the spot.
"... Lay beside me...?"
He hurried to the station to talk to the detective-inspector.
"Yes, I did."
John quickly answered it.
"It's a waste of time." At this point, Sherlock realized his headache was only getting worse, and he still was hearing Moriarty mumbling in his head. It was hard to focus on what John was really saying.
"I see..."
Someone had hold of John and was threatening to kill him.
"You bastard!"
Sherlock managed to smile a little.
"But I have, haven't I?" He leaned closer and, getting into Sherlock's face, said, "Checkmate."
"He is?"
He had to face facts; he was truly alone.
There was a little bit of blood on the floor, as well.
." Moriarty replied darkly.
"Well, because honestly, the only other person to make you snappy like this was Sherlock, wasn't it?"
"Then why do you have your 'friend's' blood on your hands?"
He started to realize just how exhausted he was.
, John. He's
He could hear him screaming nearby.
"I know..."
"I messed everything up..."
"Go see what she wants."
"He's started crying out your name. How cute." It said.
"Moriarty tried to frame Sherlock; that's why Sherlock led you in the wrong direction."
John sighed a bit. "Want some time alone?"
"I have no control over Magnussen. I couldn't make him stop even if I wanted to. Are you upset yet, Dr. Watson? Why don't you limp your way over here?" Moriarty sent him an address. "Come try to save your damsel in distress. See what happens."
"THERE IS NO SHERLOCK HOLMES ANYMORE!" Sherlock screamed. "I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS ANYMORE!"
John blushed deeply.
"Whatever helps you sleep, Graham."
She was perfect for him; witty, sarcastic, and she gave him a good kick in the rear whenever he needed it. Plus, he thought she was beautiful. For him, she was truly a complete package.
"He's mine!"
"Do you really want to get shot by me?"
' murders and domestic abuse cases might still be alive.
"Well, let's hope it hasn't already come to that."
He blinked a few times quietly before noticing how close John was to him. "... Why are we so close together?"
John slowly hugged him back. "Sherlock...?"
"Are you still tired?"
"Who is calling for him?" he asked.
"Hello?" He said in a hoarse voice. "Yes, I'd like to report an incident. Two men are dead and another is injured. Gunshot wound. The address?" He told them the address. "Please hurry." With that, he hung up and slowly turned his gaze onto Magnussen, who didn't even look away.
John leans his forehead against Sherlock’s and whispers into his hair, “It’s just a watch, don’t worry about it. It isn’t important.”
John unties the bindings at Sherlock’s ankles and slides his hands up his legs to his hips. He helps him turn over and grabs a couple of pillows to slip underneath him. Sherlock feels so exposed, and it doesn’t help when John says, “Spread your legs open wider. I want to see that cute little hole of yours.”
“One. Thank you, Sir.”
Sherlock had insisted that he be allowed to pay for the day’s activities, which had limited the options considerably. They had finally settled on the Columbus Zoo, located an hour north of the city; a place John had never been, and that Sherlock hadn’t visited since he was a kid. To Sherlock’s delight, John lets him drive the Porsche.
John resisted the urge to cross the street and make a scene. Instead, he turned and stalked home, seething with anger and jealously.
A delicious aroma filled the cabin as a flight attendant announced the dinner service. They were in the last row of business class, and John’s stomach began to growl as the passengers in the forward seats were served. Finally, Molly, tray in hand, approached with his meal. Just as she reached it, the plane lurched, and the tray flew from her hand and landed upside down on the floor of the aisle beside John.
“Doc, I’m gonna pay you back, and you’ll be seein’ more of me because I got the job!
“Why didn't you wake me up?”
“I’m sorry, sir. You’ll still have to wait.”
Mycroft had dropped into the armchair, mouth open. His thin hair hung in strings over his forehead where he had clutched at it. He looked at Sherlock with despair, guilt, and horror, but no accusation. Sherlock knew that whatever his faults, his brother also understood his decision.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Are you ever going to tell me what you do? Are you like, with the CIA? Are you a spy? C’mon, I won’t tell. Is your umbrella some sort of high-tech James Bond weapon?” Sherlock reaches for the umbrella but Mycroft jerks it away protectively.
he can’t stop it, and like a freight train it overtakes him,
John notices his expression.
“Look at you, asking for what you want. Good boy,” John chuckles as he drags his nails with more force over Sherlock’s skin, then repeats it on the right foot. The praise adds an extra thrill to the sensation.
“Yes.”
“When you get back—
change it. Captain Sherlock Stillwell was a famous pirate from the early eighteenth century.  I went through a pirate phase as a kid, and he was one of my favourites. Sherlock Holmes just sounds better than William Holmes. Don’t you think? More memorable, more dramatic. And I like to be dramatic.”
“Do I get to vote?” Louise said, looking excited.
“Who doesn’t? Wow. Thanks, Molly,” he says, looking at her quizzically.
John picked up a piece of toast and spread jam across it as he considered this question. His cock was rock hard and tenting his pyjama bottoms. He took a bite and chewed slowly. Then he put the toast back on the plate, and a half-smile twitched on his lips.
“Exactly! So who could have been in the lab after we left?”
. “I’m keeping them,” John replied evenly, rising to his feet. It didn’t even matter who was keeping the goddamn marker. This was a dick-swinging contest, pure and simple, and John did not intend to lose.
“That’s enough!” John exclaims, slamming an open hand on the bar. “Can we please stop the bickering and have a constructive conversation? Myc, that was uncalled for, and I think you owe your brother an apology.”
“Sherlock.”
“You wanna cigarette?” Wiggy says.
He woke to the distinctive sound of a helicopter. He sat up, reaching for the gun reflexively. It sounded close. John looked to the sky, waiting. Soon searchlights appeared to John’s left. They were being hunted. This meant their absence had been discovered.
“Yes? Who’s this?”
After the door closes behind Myc, Sherlock says, “Oh, god, that was humiliating.” He gives John a glare. “Did you tell him?”
Of course. He knows how that initial intrusion feels. No matter how aroused, the body first protests against it, then accepts it, and finally, the pleasure comes. That deep, powerful, mind-blowing pleasure. He will be gentle. He will control himself. He wants John to be proud of him.
“You OK, Sherlock? You’re walking funny.”
“Please, just do it,” Mycroft said, still not meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock whispers, “Yes. I want to feel better.”
“Yes?”
“No, Sir.”
“John? John? Can you hear me? What’s going on?”
“Oh, god, Sherlock, what—” John lets out a noise that’s something between a groan and a shout. Sherlock smiles to himself and starts sliding up and down with energy now, swallowing on the downstroke and moaning himself. He feels John reaching for him under the covers, but when he can’t find him, throws the sheet back.
JW:     And?
“Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Thank you so much!” Sherlock hugs John enthusiastically before pulling away and falling back onto the pillow.
As Sherlock tells John about Pete, Mycroft pokes his head around the curtain. He has a sour look on his face, but when he sees John holding Sherlock, his expression eases, and he watches them for several seconds before saying quietly, “Sorry to interrupt, but we need to make a decision about what happens next.”
John nods. “And Turing is there.
John pulled himself up to one elbow, staring at Sherlock.
John comes back to face Sherlock and tosses the crop to the bed, before dropping his robe to the floor. He’s naked, and his thick cock is hard and standing straight out from his tanned, muscular body, less than a foot from Sherlock’s face. John takes it in his hand and begins stroking himself.
“Yeah.”
“We’re going to die, aren’t we?” She addressed the question to John. It was settled now that John was the leader. Even Anderson conceded it.
He breaks the kiss, and a sob escapes his throat.
Finally, Friday night arrives and Sherlock goes to sleep early, but wakes at six in a sticky puddle. He hasn’t had a wet dream since he was fourteen. It’s still just as embarrassing. But mostly he’s upset because the only thing he can remember about it is swallowing around John’s cock as he came down his throat. He feels cheated somehow. He texts John, partly just to be safe, and partly as an excuse to make contact.
“Loved?”
“Oh, Sherlock.”
Sherlock tries not to think about his mom. Or Myc. Or Victor.
Sherlock is surprised by this casual admission.
John dropped to his knees beside the dead man, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped from his forehead, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. “Fucking hell,” he muttered. He had never got used to having patients die. Not in the A&E where he’d worked after medical school and not in Iraq. Saving patients was the highest high there was, but losing them was the lowest low. He looked up at Molly again. But she wasn’t looking at him. She was scanning the business class cabin with a furrowed brow.
“...the final result. Color, texture, thickness, they all...” Annie takes the book from John and begins speaking to herself. She goes to the sofa and fingers each hank of rope, looking back at him. When she picks up the coconut, John holds up his finger.
“Well, there aren’t too many options around here. I’ve been trying to save money to get out of here after I graduate. Also, since my mom died, my Dad’s been struggling, and so I try to help out...and I have...expenses...”
After Sherlock locks himself in his bedroom, John tries to talk to him.
“Stop it!” John said, pushing Will against the plank walls of the cabin and putting his hand over his mouth to silence him.
But then he wouldn’t have run into John Watson. Seeing Johnny had shaken him to his core. He’d changed; he had a beard now, but Sherlock had recognised him instantly. That face had been burned into Sherlock’s eidetic memory fifteen years ago no matter how much he wished he could forget it. Johnny still had the same smile and endlessly expressive face. The sturdy, compact frame. The deep blue eyes. He was handsome, but not in a flashy way, not like Sherlock. But this may have been why they clicked all those years ago. The cliché might just be true; opposites attract.
Sherlock props his bike against a tree and takes his guitar and the envelope out of the case. He doesn’t want to open the envelope just yet, a bit afraid of what it will say. Afraid of what he hopes it will say? Picking a soft spot to spare his butt, he eases onto the grass and leans against the rock. The late morning sun is shining through the foliage and dapples the ground around him as the faint gurgle of the creek and chirping birds provide a soundtrack for his thoughts. It’s peaceful here.
“Someday soon, we’ll all have computers in our pockets, perhaps implanted in our bodies. Computers will be integrated into every aspect of our lives. We’ll be dependent. And If someone has the ability to destroy all of it in an instant…”
“I am too. I’m sorry for you. You’re a good doctor, Sarah, and you’ve thrown it all away.”
and many people who look like they could have come right from his own neighborhood. Music adds to the air of joy and celebration. It’s contagious, with echoes of “Happy Pride” coming from every direction.
Sherlock struggles to open his eyes but finally looks at John as he strokes and twists with agonizing slowness. Sherlock has never, ever, been this turned on. With his arms and legs immobilized he is at John’s mercy, and it feels...extraordinary.
Nothing pans out. John has driven by all the spots he knows but no one has seen Sherlock or the truck.  Sherlock isn’t answering his phone, and, after an hour, he calls Myc who asks him to come to the house to wait, worry, and talk. Molly's parents have taken her home, although she hadn't wanted to go. John  picks up takeout on his way, and when he arrives he is taken aback by the condition of the house. It is clean but dilapidated and has clearly seen better days. Myc, seeing his expression, says apologetically, “I didn’t know it had gotten so bad. He never said…”
He continues rubbing the oil into John’s skin, using his thumbs to make little circles on each side of his spine. He’s encouraged when John sighs. The act of giving John pleasure is relaxing and takes the edge off his anxiety. He concentrates on that. He works his way down to the small of John’s back, using his body weight to increase the pressure of his strokes. John sighs again. “Mmm, that feels amazing, Sherlock.” As always, John’s praise is intoxicating and makes him want to earn more of it. He pauses to get more oil and drizzles it over and between John’s buttocks and then looks down at them while he runs his hand over his own penis, pulling a few times. It’s hard.
“Play me something. I’d love to hear you play. Do you sing? I’ll bet you have a beautiful singing voice.”
“I…um…I…”
“Hellooo remaining passengers of Flight 221, this is
Even more quietly, “No.”
He blinks hard and John is still there. It’s not an illusion.
Before John can even say hello, Sherlock assaults him with a stream of words. “Wiggy was right, Pete was getting some of his stuff from the hospital and he doesn’t know the name of the guy but he agreed to help us find out who it is and guess what he agreed to tape him John I can’t believe it Wiggy is really awesome I think we should have him over again and there’s a redheaded courier with a uniform and—”
Sherlock turns a bright red.
“Is this yours?” he asks, looking around in amazement.
“I dunno, just shorts and a T-shirt.”
“Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir. I’ll, um, just go get ready, then.”
John smiles as he observes this and refills Sherlock’s glass.
“Wear the light blue shirt and those tight black jeans. Greg will pick you up at eight and take you there. You’ll spend one hour and talk to Molly and one other person. You’ll say you can’t stay long. A friend is in town for graduation. You can have one beer. I will pick you up at nine fifteen and we’ll have a late dinner. Clear?”
“OK,” Sherlock says quickly, but thinks,
Sherlock still hasn’t figured out how a man who paddles his ass can make him feel so safe.
“Sherlock’s been arrested!” John says, not bothering to return the greeting.
“You see? There’s the payoff for being in chastity for almost a week.” He lowers himself to his knees and reaches for the waistband of the shimmering trousers. “I bet I can get you off before Martin comes to check on us. You were such a good boy to call me after you broke the rule. That’s what Rule four is about. Open and honest. I will always reward you for being honest with me.”
“There’s the Big Dipper," John says, pointing. “When I was a kid I was fascinated by the stars. I could identify most of the major constellations. I wanted a telescope, but we were too poor to buy one.”
SH: Where are you? Rescue me!
. “I’m sorry. I’m going to come.” And he does. With his balls flush against John's ass, he comes. Hard. And the feeling of it is like nothing he’s ever experienced before; the heat of his semen and the heat of John’s body are indistinguishable. It’s warm, wet, orgasmic bliss. It goes on and on, and he throws back his head and looks at the ceiling as the last pulses fade. Then they fall together onto the mattress, and he covers John’s shoulders with sloppy kisses. After several seconds, Sherlock realizes that John hasn’t climaxed. At least he doesn’t think he has. He had been so focused on his own experience that he didn’t notice.
At a look from Moriarty, the bald guard forced Sherlock backwards and into the wooden chair. His arms were wrenched behind his back, and he felt the bite of handcuffs on his wrists.
“Then, I was angry. I was angry with you for a long time. I’m not anymore, by the way. But I never stopped thinking about you. It was like I was stuck. I couldn’t move past it—past you, the boy I fell in love with at summer camp. I know Mycroft told you about my hyper-focus and my shifting passions. But my feelings for you never waned.
“The penetrating.”
MH:   We’ll be there soon! Janine wants to watch the band that’s playing on the riverfront. The lead singer is HOT.
Nevertheless, the notes to Molly and her parents and to Ms. Hudson are fairly easy. Sincere, even. He re-reads hers before he puts it in the envelope.
“Oh.” Sherlock is at a loss for words from yet another surprise from John. He really does need to do some hard thinking about his preconceived notions of manliness. But the thought of John wearing the plug while they were fucking earlier is such a turn-on that he doesn’t dwell on it now. He caps the bottle of oil and begins rubbing John’s shoulders.
“We don’t see too many sawboneses down here in the basement,” the bald one adds. “Now two in one day,” he turns to the blonde.“We might need to spruce up the place.”
John presses his lips against Sherlock’s ear. “My sweet boy. There is so much I want to show you, so much for you to learn. The world is so much bigger than you know and you deserve to see it all. You are special, Sherlock and I’m going to help you believe it. Once you do, nothing will be able to stop you.” He wraps his arms around Sherlock and holds him tight as the applause fades.
When Sherlock has stalled as long as he thinks he can get away with, he emerges from the shower, barefoot and wet-headed, to find John sitting at the island and scribbling notes on a stack of pages. He points to the seat opposite him with his pen, then returns to the stack. He lets Sherlock stew, and when he starts fidgeting, John puts down his pen and freezes him with a look.
“John.”
“John… No… I...”
“Yes, what?”
“It’s not his fault,” Sherlock interrupts.
“So, how are you feeling?” John asks.
“Or grinding your teeth.”
“I don’t have the patience for you to count and thank me for each one so prepare yourself.”
“John?”
anyone else, the gunshot would have brought them running.
“I’ll let myself out. Goodbye, Sherlock.”
“I said I was sorry,” John repeats. When Sherlock still doesn’t reply, he continues. “Sherlock, please open the door. I need to explain, but I’m not going to do it this way.”
When the hood was finally removed, he found himself in this large windowless room with the other surviving passengers of Flight 221. He counted eight. In addition to himself, Sherlock, Martha, and Molly, there was the heavyset man he recognised from the shop at Heathrow, a thin silver-haired man in a suit, a nondescript man about his own age, and a little girl with long dark hair, who was clinging to Molly. Mycroft Holmes was not there.
Sherlock spent the next several hours sitting at his desk, going over his notes and the photographs of the Carey case. Finally, he had it. It was all so obvious.
“Right. Happy birthday!” The door closes behind her.
Sherlock wriggles free and gets to his feet, and Wiggy grabs him in a full-body hug. The scent of jail clings to him, and Sherlock stiffens for a second. He doesn’t want Wiggy to get the wrong idea, so he pulls him tighter to return the hug.
“Rub your hands together to warm them up. Then scoop up your bollocks with your left hand and just roll them around in your palm. Give them a little tug, just a gentle one. That’s right, now just hold them and take your other hand and get yourself all wet—keep those eyes on me—”
He’s so hard and so close, but the friction on his cock against the soaked linen underneath him isn’t quite enough, and he fights the need to rut wildly. He clutches the sheets in both fists and groans with frustration. “Please,” he gasps, already knowing the answer.
going to be satisfied with settling down.”
jealous. Jealous of the tall, young, handsome detective. When they went out together, Sherlock always got the attention; John was used to this. He was taller, louder, smarter, and dammit he was just…
This time, though, his dream had been pleasant. He had been in New Hampshire, at Gary and Billy’s bed-and-breakfast, which they had described to him in great detail at the party yesterday. There was something about a black dog, something mysterious. He’s waking now, and the details are fading, but in the dream, he is lying on a rug in front of a blazing fireplace at the B&B with John, who is stroking his hair. As he teeters on the edge of consciousness, he struggles to go back down to the dream where John’s hand has moved from his curls to his chest and…mmm...feels nice.
Irene says, “Chemistry teacher? Not Martha Hudson?”
Sherlock is practically writhing with arousal now. “Yes. Yes, Sir,” he gasps out.
.” John said. “I hope you’ll have the decency to tell me what the fuck happened out there. And what you had to do with it. I reckon you owe it to me. Have you
“You owe your caller a big thank you. If you hadn’t been discovered and been a part of the conversation, it wouldn't be admissible in court.” John looks at Sherlock again and he is grinning. A smug, insolent grin. He grins back. Regardless of how well things have turned out, punishment is in order, and John thinks of how satisfying it will be to wipe that bratty smile off his face with the sting of the paddle. But then, that may have been Sherlock’s plan all along.
Moriarty motioned to two of his men, and one of them stepped forward, quickly getting John in a headlock and putting their gun against his head.
"I see."
Again, the taller man's brow furrowed. "But John, I did--... Oh, wait, I had said I had only tried to hurt you..."
Sherlock put on his shirt and blazer before putting his coat back on and pulling out his scarf. "Nobody's entirely free of weaknesses. He must have one that I can prey upon."
"Yes, Sherlock?"
" Moriarty asked. This one question seemed to make Sherlock recoil in uncertainty. "For all you know, Sherlock, John could be the killer. Think about it. He lives with you. No one would suspect him; they'd all suspect you."
He hoped they would save him.
John told him all that happened.
"But when you listen to your heart over your brain, you're weak. Sherlock was weaker than I am; he had weaknesses. A lot of them. Most of them linking back to you." It seemed he could give as good as he could get.
Lestrade nodded and turned to his officers. "That's an order! Move out!"
"Make him stop!!"
Moriarty walked over and took Sherlock's gun. He headed to the phone and called for an ambulance. "Hello? Yes, there's been an accident at 221B Baker Street. One man's hurt bad, and another's
"More often than not, more rational ideas than the one I just had."
The limo started to move, and Sherlock quietly stared out the window.
"You sure?" Moriarty toyed with a malevolent grin.
"Thank you..."
"Where's the fun in me telling you?"
He wondered why he was impressed with him.
John awoke with a start.
"I'm trying to talk him down, but it's not working."
"Expect him back within the next hour or two, then."
"He threatened to destroy you..."
Sherlock slammed his hands down onto the table. "You're sick, Moriarty. Don't think you've beaten me."
choose John. The day I don't is the day Sherlock Holmes is dead."
"I wish things were the way they were."
; a complete
To his surprise, Sherlock was there. He looked healthy, like he had before any of this had started. He continued to play on the violin, not paying attention to John as he did, as usual.
"Hold onto that pocket-watch. Keep it safe." Sherlock said as they walked out of the building. "He'll want it for payment later."
"That's what I'm trying to figure out."
John looked down.
"What he feared happened anyway..."
"... Um, John... What he said... uh..."
?" Sherlock blinked dismissively. "What kind of case are we covering right now?"
Sherlock looked John in the eyes.
"Just keep him talking to you." Obviously, Sherlock was planning something reckless again.
"Sherlock..."
There would be no way to talk Moriarty down. Was there any way to save the others?
Sherlock stepped closer to Moriarty, and the madman raised his gun slowly, aiming it at Sherlock, who lowered his hand to hold the gun against his own forehead.
The music continued, seeming to be coming from behind actual curtains of darkness.
"I've never run to my ghastly older brother for help before. I won't start now."
Sherlock looked at John.
"S-sorry, Sherlock. Must have lost my senses for a bit."
"Nonsense, John. It's going to take more than paranoia to deter me from this case."
Sherlock shakily raised the knife above his head. He knew what he had to do to keep himself "safe", and yet he found himself hesitating.
"That's right... Closer now."
John smiled back as he gently held his hand.
"John, do NOT shoot him."
"B-because I... I
He sighed a bit. He had had enough of this.
"What is it?"
He shook his head as he yawned. He couldn't eat or sleep; he was afraid that if he took his eyes off of John for even a second, something bad would happen.
John suddenly kissed him.
She was about to answer when a violin solo began from the live music stage on the other side of the restaurant.
John was shocked to hear him snap at him.
"You know what this is about, John." Sherlock grimly answered.
Unable to hear John over the loud noises, at least not with his ears covered, Sherlock continued shaking his head.
The sound of gunshots filled the flat at 221B Baker Street, as Sherlock was emptying the ammunition of his colleague Dr. John H. Watson's gun into the wall, onto which he had earlier drawn a large yellow smiley face.
Realizing John couldn't hear it, Sherlock quickly replied, "Nothing."
John's eyes widened. "He stabbed himself...? But why?"
"Huh."
"But you'll bleed out and how can you protect me if you're dead?"
"Wait, that's all you found out?"
"I see..." John sadly replied as he looked down.
Sherlock seemed horrified by the very idea. "The first time, I may have let him do it, yes, to keep you safe from him. But I did not enjoy it. The second time... You saw those pictures, didn't you? The ones Moriarty took? Do you really think I was enjoying myself...?!" He started to cough, pushing himself to yell yet unable to yet.
John prayed that they weren't too late to save Mrs. Hudson.
"That him?" asked Lestrade.
"You don't mean...!"
John snuggled him some more.
"Outside."
The Consulting Detective continued the kiss.
"I'll text you the address."
John then went into the bathroom.
Sherlock got in after and told the cabbie to take them to Baker Street.
"Be careful with him. He's still hurt."
He slowly walked in as he looked around a bit.
It was Mycroft. "John? There's been a problem."
He would need a backup plan in that case, but until he knew for certain whether or not Sherlock was still capable of thinking clearly, this idea was probably his best bet.
Moriarty laughed louder in the interrogation room.
"Oh, don't try so hard to avoid the question, John. Your body language already answered it for me." Sherlock said matter-of-factly as he followed. "Dinner?" He then added, asking if John was hungry.
The message on the wall and the comment about the killer knowing the ins and outs of their flat didn't help to ease his mind.
"You... You say that we're nothing but friends and colleagues... But, uh... Hypothetically speaking, what if I were... to have a crush on you? I mean, what if I could and did? I... Just, never mind. I don't know what I'm saying. Must be the head injury talking."
John growled angerly.
The Consulting Detective simply kept the knife in his grasp and pulled out his cellphone. This time he sent a text, as per norm for him. When he was finished, he slumped to the floor beside John, leaning his head against the doctor's chest.
John couldn't believe his ears. It sounded like how Sherlock used to play but that couldn't be.
"Shut up, you bastard!"
"Do it." Sherlock said firmly. "Shoot me."
"I mean, you wouldn't be all that affected, would you? I mean, you've been to war. You've seen worse."
He got into bed and sighed.
The next text was a picture of Sherlock, half naked and freshly beaten, struggling to obscure his face from the camera.
"But what about you?"
Since he was so close to the door, he heard the faint sound of a somewhat muffled gunshot from within.
The good doctor started to smile more.
Adjusting his glasses, the suited man looked over in John's direction as if he knew he was there, and smirked slightly.
"John," Lestrade said.
"Is it... Is it coming for me yet...?"
"I'm pretty sure I'm okay. But not entirely sure. SH" That wasn't very reassuring.
"... John..."
"I'll look into it... The ambulance is rushing back to the hospital now. I'm going to follow it."
Sherlock hugged John back.
"Then we have to help her!"
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at the psychologist, worried he may have hurt her whilst throwing her away.
"Just hang tight."
"John?" Sherlock leaned toward him and gently shook him. "John, wake up."
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment as if to rest them.
Sherlock hesitated.
"That's none of your business!!"
"It's a long story. To make it brief: not dead."
"I love you too, Sherlock, but you're starting to scare me."
"I will kill you for this, Moriarty!"
Sherlock looked at him with his weary blue eyes.
Sherlock felt John's hand weakly clutch the end of his coat.
"I am."
After a couple of minutes, he got half of a text that appeared to have been written by Sherlock. But only half, as though he'd pressed send too soon. It was possible he had done it intentionally because whatever was going on hadn't quite concluded yet.
"He caused this problem on his own."
"Good luck."
"Please let her be okay."
"Don't leave me alone again..."
Sherlock smiled a little.
"Why, Sherlock?"
John called for a wheelchair so it would be easier for him to get around.
"I..."
"You lie!"
Sherlock continued to worry about things.
Carefully, Sherlock hugged him back.
"Brutally? So..." Sherlock trailed off, and the smirk on his face turned into a frown. He leaned closer and whispered, "So, you mean, he... He would have coerced me past third base? He'd have went the whole way?"
So did John.
"Find any clues yet?"
"I want to meet him."
"Sherlock?"
"What's going on?" The Detective Inspector asked.
It was a relief to John that Sherlock was still fine this time.
"Do not concern yourself with his affairs, John." Mycroft said. "It is solely the business of the British Embassy."
"What's going on?"
John chuckled a bit.
"I wish I knew, Sherlock."
When he got there, he saw Lestrade sitting on a chair inside. He seemed moderately distressed.
He started driving, but John felt they weren't going to get there fast enough.
Sherlock shuddered. He nearly rejected the action, but immediately forced himself to accept it, believing that something bad would happen if he didn't. He seemed to still be waiting for John to go further.
Sherlock watched him carefully.
"If it makes you happy, John, I'll try to rest..."
She had looked angry, but it seemed like something about Sherlock's reaction had changed her disposition. "John," she hushed to him, "it's not my place, and I'm not sure I would react any differently than you, but..."
"You're lying again."
Sherlock waited anxiously.
Mycroft looked back at John. "I would help if I could. I really can't do something like that if I enjoy having a good reputation."
"Please hang on, Sherlock..."
"Yes. I just have to use the bathroom."
"You have to take it easy. You've lost a lot of blood."
He then collapsed from blood loss.
He turned it on and looked for the phone number.
He felt Sherlock's hand graze his arm.
"What? How?"
"But you wouldn't say I'm
Sherlock looked up at him with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes.
"I'm guessing you haven't talked to John about this." the woman said as John gave him a concerned look.
"I know, I just..."
The good doctor coughed up blood as he weakly looked up at Sherlock.
"Alright. I will."
"That demented monster.."
"I would never hurt you, though, I swear!"
"... Why did you come here? Was it to save me?"
After a minute or two, Lestrade told him, "It's licensed to a Charles A. Magnussen."
Sherlock laid back down next to him.
Sherlock instinctively clung to him.
The Consulting Detective smiled somewhat.
But John stayed with him.
"You should get some rest. I'll be right here."
John now was really worried for Sherlock.
"Yes, it's me, Sherlock."
it." He insisted. "It was just him making fun of me."
"John..." Sherlock said quietly, "How is it, I wonder, that you can be kind to me...? I mean, everyone else hates me... Why on earth don't you...?"
John's brow cocked a bit. "You want to share the bed?"
"Thank you so much, Inspector."
"Don't take it too personally, John." Sherlock said, though he was glaring hard at Mycroft. "My brother can't be bought even with antiques."
"I'm going in anyway." She announced as she ran into 211 Baker Street.
"I don't get it. I know she doesn't like Sherlock, but why would she intentionally try to kill him?"
Suddenly, the detective froze up. "J-... John..." He was silent for a moment before he lowered his head. "I... I'll do it... Just... Just don't hurt John..." It appeared as though he was stuck in a flashback, reenacting his side as it progressed.
Sherlock's screaming stopped.
"Who is this?" he texted back.
Sherlock let him go. "Sorry..."
"He isn't."
" Sherlock laughed at something.
"Yes," exclaimed Mary to the proposal. Then she noticed the stunned look on his face and placed her hand on his forearm in slight concern. "John? Are you all right?" The violin continued.
Suddenly, into the room ran Sherlock.
No response.
Sherlock said nothing for a long moment, simply staring at John. Soon, however, he turned his head and looked at Moriarty. "What's the meaning of this?"
"No, that's... That's out of the question."
"What good would that do? It wouldn't bring Sherlock back. No, I want to make Moriarty suffer for even putting this in motion."
John then started to wake up.
The good doctor weakly looked up at them.
John slowly fell asleep.
John tried to call Holmes' brother.
"Well, he hurt me too deeply this time and had Sherlock die. It's time for me to get him to beg."
"Sherlock? Sherlock, what happened?"
John gently hugged him.
"Just leave me alone! You made me do this!"
John quickly got him some water.
"Nothing. He's just a smartass, and I'd like to prove that I'm smartest."
"And?"
"I thought you said you don't need anyone." John countered.
Still holding the gun, Sherlock checked that it was loaded.
It seemed like it could take a while, since Sherlock had stored a lot in his Mind Palace.
"Let's rest."
"I'm sorry if I'm acting like a child. I don't usually get scared, but..."
"What was that? 'Be rational'? Oh, and PLEASE DO let me know WHAT exactly is 'RATIONAL'."
"And he's still after Sherlock."
The detective was out cold, bleeding profusely from his temples and the back of his scalp.
"A game, Sherlock?"
"I'm fine, Sherlock."
have..."
"Are you alright, Sherlock?"
Moriarty laughed evilly before vanishing.
John groaned a bit then relaxed.
"You can speak your mind here, Sherlock."
"You seem to be handling Sherlock's suicide well. What's your secret? Is it because you were in the army?"
"More than you think."
"I'll be fine, Inspector." he wheezed.
"What...? John, what do you mean...?"
Sherlock took a step backwards, closer to John.
John slowly leaned forward.
Then he noticed John's wound was bleeding a bit as well.
He raised a brow as if intrigued. "Didn't I?"
It was quiet.
Sherlock left the room.
"I didn't say that, Sherlock."
"Just wanted to give you a hug."
The Consulting Detective gave the good doctor a faint smile.
Sherlock remained still.
"Sherlock, snap out of it!"
Sherlock let go.
"Don't tempt me."
Of course! His ego!
"Oh, I don't care..." Sherlock moaned dismissively. "I just... thank God he didn't... hurt you...
He rubbed his back more.
"Come to think of it. He could have easily did so."
"Yes, Sherlock?"
The Consulting Detective almost seemed moved. "John... You know something that I don't know for once, don't you?"
"You still need to eat though."
"John." Sherlock held him steady by the cheeks and looked him in the eyes. He seemed to know that something terribly tragic was about to occur.
Moriarty seemed intrigued.
"Yes, Sherlock..."
He happily kissed back.
"It doesn't matter right now, Sherlock."
"I will be doing no such thing."
John teared up happily and snuggled into him.
"Good luck."
"Yeah, must be..." John said as he walked.
John growled and punched him again.
On the answering machine, John was able to notice one strange difference; Sherlock referred to himself on it as "
Sherlock turned away from the drawers and returned to sitting on the edge of the bed.
John just backed up and quickly left.
The door to 221B was open.
Sherlock pulled his hands into his lap and started rubbing his reddened wrists quietly.
Sherlock looked at John, as if mildly surprised by that response.
"No, I'm-"
"For now, maybe... But what happens when I lose grip of myself? When Moriar-- I mean, the voices, take over?"
Sherlock let out a reluctant sigh before leaning back. "... Alright. I'll listen."
"But not all of them."
"Alright."
act!"
Still, soon enough, Sherlock opted to cover his ears again.
"I'm not going to help you, Sherlock. I can't do something like that; I'd get into a great deal of trouble."
Holmes returned, handing John a plastic bag with some ice cubes in it.
John then wheeled himself to another room and sighed.
"What?"
"And those are?" he asked; feeling a bit hurt.
"Are you sure about that~?"
"They're here for Lestrade!"
"... Who's there?" Sherlock asked quietly. He got no answer, but when he was about to shrug it off, he heard it once more, making him stand up.
"What if Moriarty starts up again, John?"
However, the door locked behind the guard, and it needed a key to be opened.
"Now, what kind of trouble have you stirred this time, Sherlock?" Mycroft said.
John was already eating his food.
She was knocked out when her head hit her desk.
"Get some rest. You need it."
Another text from the same unknown number made his cellphone rumble again.
Sherlock kept clawing at himself. "Get your hands off of me!" He shouted, becoming more frantic.
"I know who it is." Sherlock said, sounding somewhat shellshocked.
"I'm alienating the only person I love. I don't know right from wrong, or truth from fiction anymore. I don't know who I am, for God's sake!"
"He keeps on saying your name, Doctor Watson. That's all he'll say. We think maybe he wants to see you...?"
"You're not stupid or useless, Sherlock! You're one of the brightest men I know!"
Sherlock suddenly kissed him once again.
"What do you mean?"
"I'm so bored." He griped. "When will a good case pop up?"
John didn't hear that since he continued to listen the violin music.
John kissed him back.
"Yes. I'm just sort of, uh..." He appeared lost for words for a moment. "...
When Sherlock saw John, he clasped his hands together and stood. "Alright, Graham, let's go."
Moriarty appeared almost amused by the threat, but he shrugged anyway. "Well, I'll check in later. Toodles." Then, he clambered down the rest of the stairs, disappearing around a corner as he approached the exit.
"So be it," Lestrade replied. "I'll be waiting at the crime scene." That said, the Detective Inspector left, and Sherlock slowly trailed behind John.
The doctors put John into the back of the ambulance and began driving him to the hospital.
John got ready as well and went out the door with him.
Sherlock didn't reply to that request, and instead entered the building before them.
John looked down.
"Still, something about this doesn't feel right."
"He... He will..." Sherlock insisted.
"I wouldn't worry so much about Moriarty, Doctor Watson. His time of reckoning will come soon enough."
He just wished that he could hear Sherlock playing the violin in flat 221B one more time.
The owner left them be. Looking at the pre-set glasses, Sherlock grabbed the bottle of champagne.
"How did that happen?"
They quickly ran into the issue that there was only one bed, since Lestrade had not thought Sherlock would accompany John.
"That might be but in your condition there's no way we could get away far enough."
"No...!"
Sherlock continued the kiss, despite his lips trembling. He was clearly hesitant to do anything more, but seemed to be waiting for John to progress.
