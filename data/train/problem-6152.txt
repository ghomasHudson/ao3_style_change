Tony's heart missed a beat. Right... Maybe a little. He really hated that Pepper knew him so well. "They're gonna hate me." He admitted, sounding a little childish, even to his own ears. "I need at least one person on my side."
After a couple of hours and the assurance that Tony wasn't ready to talk yet, Steve decided he wouldn't let the food waste away. And incidentally, he was starving. He heated it up, took a few bites and felt guilty about ruining the evening for them. The pain in his heart wouldn't go away. Steve might be trying to ignore it and pretend that he was doing fine but that would be lying through his teeth. He felt the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes as hew chewed and cursed himself.
Steve looked down at him, gritting his teeth. "You know what, Buck? You may have a point..." He said pensively. "I kinda
She took her drink with her and walked away. "m gonna see what he's doing." She said as she headed for the bathroom. Steve looked outside the window and saw a glimpse of him, still on the phone. He was tempted to join him too but he wanted to hear Bucky and Clint's story. He had never heard Clint's side of it after all. Even after all those years.
Tony shrugged into Steve's arms. "I've had my first... And then, sometimes when I'm with an alpha and I'm aroused, I have some sort of phantom heat. Like right now."
"Stickers!" Steve ordered, not willing to dwell on it. Steve giving everything away meant that Tony would have to share his stuff with him. Not that it was an inherent issue for his boyfriend, quite the contrary. It just meant that when—
His body seemed to say otherwise though, Tony was rock hard and burning against Steve's skin.
Steve was having a hard time focusing on what was being said, with the loud and accelerating beating of his heart. He glanced at his boyfriend, who glanced back at him, the corner of his mouth curled up into a sly smile.
Steve just did not remember. He hardly had any success with guys, especially in his younger years.
to make it alright. He reached a hand out but Tony recoiled and stepped back, leaning against the workbench behind him, putting the mug away. Steve wasn't sure what kind of face he was making but Tony averted his eyes and made a painful grimace at the sight of him. Steve felt the tears come back.
Steve chuckled, without any spite. "Are you free, tonight?"
"What?" He defended himself. "If he really likes him..."
sooner. You asked me once if you were my first. You weren't my first. I've had other alphas. Not that much but enough to know the difference. I've been claimed before Tony, but you're the only one I've wanted back. I used to blame it on the bond but it's not the bond that made me fall in love with you. It's the other way around. I
Steve liked his boyfriend's bedroom. He liked it a lot actually. It was... It was so much Tony. It smelt Tony too. And as Tony kept on giving him a detailed tour of the room, opening the closets and explaining how the smart shower worked—with some optional particularities that were very interesting for people who were doing anal on a regular basis, which, Steve blushed again, was a nice touch—he realized that Tony's entire place was meant to welcome someone else. Everything was thought of, for two. Half of his closet was empty, except for a few outfits that were definitely not Tony's size. There were two sinks in the bathroom, two armchairs... Everything worked in two. Tony had designed his place to live with someone else. And the implications of this made Steve feel a little dizzy.
clearly is on the list of things I would have never done in hindsight." He mutters softly. "I'm so sorry." He adds.
"Are you having sex with someone who's positive?" It was
"Please, let me speak." Tony exclaimed, eyes darkening with a sort of frenzy.
"Mr Fury." The Principal said, "I'm sorry to interrupt your class but I'd like to introduce a new student. His name is Anthony E. Stark. He's been unexpectedly transferred here and we're very glad to have him with us. Please, give him a warm welcome and make sure he feels happy in our school." Steve laughed internally, wondering if those words were addressed to them, or Fury. Both options being absolutely laughable.
Tony went to the bathroom to wash his hands and came back with a bright smile. "You like it, though..." He said hoarsely while picking an apple from their lunch box while Steve was mixing the salad.
Tony was still smiling, expression gentle but determined. "Move in with me. Today." His tone was a little too assertive, a little too resolute. Steve's heart wavered. "Let's pack your bags now and move you into the penthouse."
of it all. Slowly but surely Bucky is lulled into an alternate state of consciousness, comforted by the innate knowledge that, if anything were to happen to his daughter he would wake up from it immediately, him and Steve both, comforted by the knowledge, too, that their alpha would be taking care of them the right way, that he could give up control completely and let it happen.
Just like every morning, Steve started smiling lovingly while tilting his head on the side when his boyfriend pouted in front of the food. Except that today, Tony didn't eat the food. He just mumbled an inaudible "I'm not hungry." without raising his eyes from his cup of coffee. He had no tablet or phone in hand this morning.
"I don't know... I don't know. Just the way you look. It's stupid. I can't see you with an alpha."
"Do you think he's serious about those regulations?" Steve asked, mildly concerned by the issue at the moment.
The next day there was another doodle. Another cartoon Captain America making funny faces and the word
The guy startled. "Okay. Should we go to a hotel then?" That guy was really asking too many questions. Tony was too drunk to care. Faced with too much hesitancy from Tony, the guy asked another disconcerting question. "You still wanna do this, Greg?"
Bucky shivers from head to toe as the warmth of the omega envelops him. Their scents mingle and spike with arousal. Steve kisses him before mouthing the alpha's cock. With a gentle hand running through his damp hair, he slips his tongue into his mouth and they kiss for a moment. It's soft and wet and mellow and the alpha's scent spikes with want. The kiss ends up on the alpha's cock and they keep licking each other's tongues while lapping the hard shaft of their alpha.
"Good." Steve said, feeling satisfied.
Tony flinched. He felt those last words piercing through his heart like an arrow and started shuddering all over as panic and anxiety came back at once, engulfing him into a dark and putrid place. A place he had thought he would never go back to. He didn't want to go back. He felt his hands tremble and huddled on himself, squeezing tight around his knees to force the shaking away. He tried to subdue his breathing but he was starting to hyperventilate again. Why did Steve bring him here? Why didn't he leave him with those guys? Why didn't he dump his ass in a ditch, where Tony belonged to, if he didn't want him? Obie had. Everyone else had.
"Yeah, I noticed." His boyfriend says and for once, he doesn't sound judgmental. "It's alright."
"Fucking fine!" Tony spat. "I just need a drink..."
It has become so
Once outside Tony took a deep, refreshing breath. He almost smiled at the semblance of freedom he felt at this instant. He took a cigarette and the first puff went straight to his head, relaxing him a little. The excitement started fluttering in his chest again. It wasn't even ten p.m. Maybe he could still make it to Steve's party. The sudden sliver of hope rushed to his head and he left lightheaded for a moment. He fumbled with his phone. Should he text? Should he call first? Should he try to surprise him? It wasn't even that far. Maybe Happy could drop him there discreetly.
"Stop it." He mumbled in the pillow, still half-asleep. His croaky morning voice was muffled in the fluff of the bed.
Something zeroed out in Steve's mind. Sex. Of course he wanted to have sex. Right here right now. It was everything he could think about at this exact moment and the inside of his pants agreed very much with that suggestion. He was so hard it hurt and his body was burning and his mind was going blank against and he didn't know where he was anymore.
The alpha responds to his growing distress with gentle fingers brushing his damp hair away from his face. "What did you want, James?" His voice is husky, low in his throat. Each word are pervaded with lust.
"No, silly." Steve answered nonchalantly. "I'm just selling my apartment."
Steve was still in the process of trying to find out why his boyfriend had suddenly blurted that Steve liked him to be submissive in the middle of preparing lunch when he heard Tony chuckle behind. He span on his heels, the salad servers still in his hand, and was faced with two shining marbles, staring at him wantonly, only inches from his face. He didn't really know how that had happened but apparently his boyfriend had managed to skirt around the counter like a swift cat and was leaning over him, pushing him against the counter with his whole body and trapping him between strong arms. Very
The nice nurse sat him on a hospital bed and bombarded him with questions.
He turned his head and saw Tony Stark who seemed to be half-heartedly listening to his science bro talking. His gaze wandered and met Steve's. Their eyes locked into each other for a few seconds, as if drawn to each other like magnets. Steve's cheeks flushed. Tony gave him a coy smile and averted his eyes embarrassedly, unable to hold Steve's stare.
Steve startled and unconsciously motioned his hand to the lump on his head, remembering not to touch it. He breathed in slowly, carefully avoiding hurting his lungs while doing so, and looked up at Sam.
Steve pushes the alpha down on the mattress. "Don't you want to?" He exclaims, desperately.
Steve knew very well who that smell belonged to, anyway. Just as he knew so very well whose fingers it was that brushed his hand surreptitiously. The touch electrifying. Stark was long gone but Steve still felt the tip of his fingers tracing the lines between his knuckles. The touch lingering on his skin, dizzying, spreading warmth throughout his entire body. He could still feel his heat and he could still smell him.
He wasn't sure if it was dark-haired guy who had made him leave or if he had gotten bored with Tony's lack of interest but he no longer had a mouth on his cock and felt cold. Dark-haired guy slid his hand down his chest, pressing his knuckles into the hollows of his abs, and slipped his fingers into his pants, grabbing his dick in relief. He gave it a few strokes, reducing the distance between them. Tony closed his eyes and let the guy take control. He bit his bottom lips and hummed softly, relishing in the pleasure of it. He forgot everything else. That was the exact reason Tony was doing this, he thought, to forget.
The rest of the walls displayed almost the entirety of Steve's career. Original sketches. First covers. Even a few articles... There were figurines too. Although, Steve exaggerated a little, Tony had always been a fanboy and his walls represented that exactly. It wasn't all about him.
They ate the cookies and went back to work. Then they hung out. Tony showed him all the cool things he had told him about. They were... really cool, to say the least. And then Tony asked him if he wanted to stay over. Steve freaked out. If he stayed over he was pretty sure he would do something stupid. He didn't trust himself around Tony and whatever they had been forming for the past couple of month, he didn't want to jeopardize it.
"Deep down you know he's right." Obie added with the same concerned and supportive expression on his face. "You know where your responsibilities lie." His hand crept up Tony's neck, an insignificant gesture yet so meaningful, a possessive and inescapable grasp. One that said Obie had all the rights to Tony's life and death. Tony stared up into his eyes, desperate and imploring, despite himself. "Don't ruin everything for a fling."
"Did you have anal sex?"
A surge of rage ran throughout his body and made him shudder. How he had managed to keep enough self-control not to punch the smug smile off the bastard's face was still a mystery to him. Maybe that was those invisible shackles that restrained him. His could feel his hands shake and ground his teeth to subdue the slight tremor in his jaw. He was glad his body had been drained of any tears for years for once, because surely Howard would have loved seeing them prickle at the corner of his eyes.
Tony felt his heart waver, all sorts of unwanted feelings roiling inside. Disappointment, anger, fear,
Steve was the one keeping some distance. He was observing everyone interacting. It felt necessary to keep away and stay in the background, necessary to understand what went wrong, what he had missed. He imagined that was what Bucky had done when he first arrived here and the thought made his heart clench.
The anger Steve had felt fluttered away, letting the sense of happiness Steve had been feeling ever since he had woken up this morning settle in his guts. He smiled back and they stared at each other silently, both smiling affectionately, both looking happy in the morning light and the fresh winter breeze.
It was
Your great grand father built this company from the ground. When he came to this country he had nothing. Your grand father helped us win the war. Imagine a world where Hitler hasn't been defeated." He suggested while adding a large movement to his arm to emphasize his point.
He chuckles embarrassedly, looking away again and stares right back into Tony's eyes. "You know in five years," he says softly, but eyes determined, "we've never been on a date. Not even once." Tony stares up at him surprisedly with a curious expression. Steve's biting his bottom lip nervously. "And it's my fault. It's probably my fault." The omega continues. "I want to fix that."
Tony's mind drifted away and he started flying, more and more out of it, just like when he was a kid. The pain too intense, the excitement too intense, the rage that each blow titillated wrenching. His throat was used like a Fleshlight and the burn spread down in his entire body. He didn't care much. He didn't pay attention to the insults either. Those guys were really into that apparently. Not that Tony had ever cared. He didn't care about anything. Nothing mattered anymore. At some point though, the whole thing stopped being fun. He thought. At some point Tony got bored, or realized he was, and wanted them to stop, let him die or let him go.
Clint laughed proudly. "Yeah but I was a hell of a singer, wasn't I? Just admit it! I nailed that song."
"I wasn't raped." Tony snapped.
"Yeah, I can see that..." Steve hummed, snuggling against him.
"I could help you with your maths?" Tony added with a chipper tone, an innocent smile spreading on his cheeks.
Tony almost had tears in his eyes as he was saying this and Steve... Steve was biting his lips till he bled to repress his own. His own heart ready to explode.
with Steve...so he doesn't really understand what Rhodey means.
Tony didn't say anything but the lecture had left a wavering feeling at the bottom of his stomach. He was given a prescription for the pain and a list of recommendations to help the healing, was forbidden to give oral sex for two weeks at least, was asked to double his prescription of preventive HIV treatment, was reminded that AIDS was not the only potential STD he could catch with his reckless behavior—as if Tony didn't already know that, was thoroughly reminded to wear protection if he were to engage in any kind of sexual activities with his boyfriend in the next two fortnights and finally, he was given a bunch of informative leaflets and cards for support groups, all kinds of paperwork addressed to rape victims, LGBTQ+ people, and a couple for drug addicts too, and he felt like vomiting again, although he had nothing left in his stomach. Why did everyone think he was raped? Tony
"Wrong choice of words, doll." Steve slurred. He pulled out the plug and went for a bigger toy. Tony gasped and grunted. At the cringing look on his face, Steve pulled out and spurted lube all over his hole and on the toy before shoving it in again, deep inside his boyfriend's ass, giving it little thrusts.
drank water.
"Ugh ugh" Bucky agreed while shaking his head.
"This is the last time we're gonna stroll around this neighborhood together." He said nostalgically. "Isn't it weird?"
What was supposed to happen then happened, as expected. Steve slapped him, hit his head against the wall, smashed his face into the bricks. It hurt, a little. But if Steve was expecting him to cry and to beg him to stop he could always wait. There was nothing Steve could do to him that hadn't already been done to him tenfold. Tony waited. Of course, probably, in theory, he could defend himself and push Steve away. Except he didn't. He never did. He just waited. If Steve wanted to hurt him, if his dad wanted to hurt him, if Obie or some random guy wanted to hurt him then so be it. Tony's whole existence was meant for that purpose anyway.
Jane laughed. "Seriously, you were being a drag. It was becoming pathetic."
He felt a burn on his cheeks, spreading so rapidly it was embarrassing. He was conflicted. On one hand, he felt extremely relieved and grateful for Tony to be here. On the other hand he hated that he had, once again, come to his rescue, although the idea diffused a comforting warmth throughout his body. He hated being helpless. He hated being needy. Steve had never felt so eager to climb into someone else's car and yet, he hesitated.
He dropped his head on his chest and snuggled against him. "I'm sorry..." He whispered, hidden in the fabric of his boyfriend's coat. "You're right, I'm so fucking blind when it comes to you but I wish you'd tell me that kind of things in private, instead of calling everyone as a witness."
"Here. Have some. Much more efficient. Much more discreet." Tony looked down at Obie's hand. He was handing him a little silver platter with four lines of coke. "You're old enough now," he said with a sly smile.
"I guess that was another one of those moments we can add on the pile of our missed chances." Steve muttered in a hoarse voice while Tony's mouth was still on him.
"And then you contacted me." Sam interrupted, looking at her with a smile filled with love and admiration.
Omegas are a miracle of life. Their soothing voices so enchanting and their lavish, comforting scents intoxicate and send you to heaven each time you get a whiff. His omegas are gorgeous. They are more. They are perfection. Each of them, in their own way. James's mysterious blue eyes charm him in dangerous ways. Steve's soft and protective ones ground him and open doors for him and pull down the sky and the entire galaxy, to offer it to him. Tony feels dizzy at the thought.
Tony lets him unbutton his pants and fumble with his fly. He spreads his legs a little but lets him handle the rest. Bucky takes a huge whiff of the alpha's scent before he frees his cock from its prison. He wants to take things slow, warming him slowly, letting him relax and maybe later the alpha will be in better dispositions for some more talking. Bucky still has a few tricks in his bag.
He was on his way to acceptance when he walked along Fifth Avenue, to Tony's house. Steve rarely came in Manhattan but Tony had insisted. It was the first time they were having their homework session in one of their houses. Steve was really not thrilled about going all the way from their shitty diner in Brooklyn over to Manhattan but Tony had batted his eyelashes and looked at him with his most unsettling puppy eyes, Steve had given in.
"I wanna see that painting so badly." Tony said. He sounded cheerful and ecstatic and his eyes glimmered with pride.
It was Jane's question who snapped him out of it. He startled and turned to her. "What?"
Steve startled and snapped out of it. "Sam's coming?" He asked surprisingly. Sam had met some of Steve's college friends several times but it wasn't like they saw each other on a regular basis, even less invite each other over for reunion dinners. He felt a sudden surge of joy however, about seeing Sam. He realized they hadn't seen each other for
"I hate it when you sound so mature," Steve sighed while huddling up on himself because of the cold. "When did that happen?"
So, it might haven't actually been by chance that new guy—Tony, apparently—was standing right by his locker. Steve finally managed a smile and nodded. "I am. Did you need anything?"
There came the explanation.
The tension was heavy, palpable between them but no-one said or did anything for a while.
"I don't." Clint muttered. "I never met one. So I wouldn't know."
Something forlorn unexpectedly ran across Tony's eyes and he gave him a sad, gentle smile.
Despite everything, they were able to finish quickly. Tony behaved, mostly, but did ask too many questions.
Something indescribable flashed across Bucky's eyes. He startled and then panicked and inched back confusedly. "Wow, Stevie. What's the matter with you? You gone mad?"
He heard the distant voice of his boyfriend coming closer and looked up to him. He raised his eyes and was met with a bright, slightly mischievous smile.
Tony shrugged. He looked a bit melancholic, maybe trying to be understanding. There was something nostalgic in his eyes, as if he, too, was remembering his own childhood.
Steve was everything to him and he betrayed him. He betrayed his trust. He betrayed his love. He ruined everything, ruined their future and their past, destroyed everything good they had.
Tony chuckled and Steve thought he saw the beginning of a flush on his handsome face but he might as well have imagined it. He licked his bottom lip and turned suddenly serious. "She's going with Wanda."
Tony raised his eyes, his heart thumped in his chest but not for the right reasons this time. He was met with Howard's disgusting smirk. He stared into his eyes defiantly and looked down his work, pretending to ignore the asshole. "What can I do for you,
"I don't know, Steve. Do you really want to live with me?"
Tony pouted and remembered it wasn't gonna work on her since he was on the phone. "That was uncalled for."
He shivers from head to toe and feels jolts of electricity run down his spine to the tip if his—rock hard—cock. All his senses are going haywire. And Steve's intense gaze is staring at him relentlessly.
"Guys!" He exclaimed angrily, hands on his hips. "I think I'm omega."
This was
Tony shrugs. "Don't know... Four...Five... not that much actually. I'm fine."
Once they were outside and the fresh air slapped Tony on the face, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, things seemed clearer suddenly.
Steve heard a noise. There seemed to be a commotion outside.  Everyone was gathering at the entrance.
"Nah. 'Cause you're gonna do everything I say," he finally answered. "Hands off and turn over," he commanded. "You're gonna wait patiently here, spread out for me, until I get hard again." Which, to be honest, took much longer than before lately.
the coffee.
"Steve..." Tony repeats, voice deep and hoarse with want. "What if I were to ask you to stop taking your suppressants and share your heats with me from now on?" Steve keens around the alpha's cock, voice muffled by the hard shaft. His entire body shudders with pleasure and desire alike. "Would you like that?"
it. But he can't.
Tony was right... How would they know? For once he had the opportunity to use the rumor in his favor, he wasn't going to miss it. He just needed an alpha to chaperon him and Sam was happy to play the part.
Tony let out a painful shuddering breath, still shaking, and fell on the side. He was still unable to move a limb. He didn't even have enough strength in himself to pull his pants up, so Obie's hands caught him and hauled him up. The brusque movement made Tony retch with the sudden, excruciating need to throw up. The man gently held him up above the bowl while he puked the five or so drinks he had had at dinner.
Tony was in the living room, up and about, all dressed up for work. He was standing in his dark blue dress pants and his fitted white shirt that outlined his frame perfectly and tying his cufflinks with a charm and confidence that still did it for Steve. Had they had more time... His heart skipped again and he almost dropped his towel when he unconsciously brought a hand to his neck. Tony was so handsome in his work clothes that Steve had forgotten why he was downstairs, rivulets dripping down his chest, with only a towel to hide his modesty.
She wants.
Tony looked down and Steve ducked his head to kiss his doubts away. "I love you, Tony." He whispered soothingly.
"I don't wanna work from here Tony!" Steve exclaimed, finally letting his feelings out. "I like it at SHIELD. I like the spirit, the rivalry, the ambiance..."
but when you have an alpha, it's a fucking blessing. It'll be amazing, Stevie. Can't you see it?"
Tony feels very close to his friend suddenly. They have probably always been close in hindsight. They understand each other. Tony would give up so much for Steve if he didn't stop himself.
Steve startled and tried to swallow the lump in his throat. "It's been almost a year, Tony."
They should fuck. Everything is fine when they fuck. And Tony looked so handsome this morning, so manly, ready to catch Steve every time he screwed up and fell.
Hope you enjoyed it!
"You really think Tony can take care of both of us at the same time? I mean, he's... he's not getting any younger and—" He's interrupted by the brunet who wraps his arms around him tenderly and snuggles into the nape of his neck, planting soft kisses there. He can feel his tickling breath when he chuckles and shivers all over.
Steve felt an unnecessary blush creeping on his face. He hurried up and left the classroom in a rush, feeling his fast heartbeat throbbing in his temple.
Tony shrugged. He wasn't sure exactly what she wanted him to say.
Tony felt an agonizing pain in his heart. Not a physical one, or maybe it was real, he wasn't sure because he couldn't breathe anymore. He felt his entire self shudder with fear but the reluctance in Steve's demeanor unsettled him and for the first time he found it in himself to fight back. He narrowed his eyes, focusing his glare on the man who was supposed to be his boyfriend and shower him with love and affection but kept hurting him again and again. "Do you really want me to?"
Tony looked at him with a mix of surprise, confusion and sympathy. "Is that really a thing?" Steve nodded. "Yeah but I mean, is that rule still carried out? Why wouldn't you be allowed to go? And who cares anyway? How could they even know?"
The alpha turned to him, dark eyes so intense on him and smile a little evil. "I see..." He said suggestively. "So, not Wilson then. Why don't you ask them out though?"
"Sure." Steve agreed with a content smile. "Is that all?"
Or is it the age thing? Loki is about eight years older than him and Steve seems so happy to meet with people that, unlike him, are mature and act like grown-ups. Rhodey reminds him that quite often, thank you. And by the way, he did grow up and he's acting all mature and everything with his boyfriend, he's trying to anyway. And he thinks he deserves people like Rhodey to admit that at least. Anyway, he wouldn't say Loki is the epitome of maturity either, behaviorally speaking he means. Besides, he's never felt that way with Sam, hating him for no reason, he means. Even though Sam has always been hostile to him. He doesn't take it personally. Sam is just being a good friend and overly protective and, honestly, Tony can't blame him. He would even go as far as saying he's glad someone has Steve's back the way Sam does. Doesn't mean that Tony hasn't wanted to punch him in the face once or twice... but Sam doesn't rub him the wrong way like Loki does.
It was only when Howard left his office that Tony noticed that Obie had been watching the entire scene. He was leaning on the doorframe, arms crossed on his broad chest, and looked at him with an amused though slightly supportive smile. The way he stared at him gave Tony shivers, not the same kind. If Howard had put shackles on his ankles and wrists, Obie had put one on his neck. One even more inescapable. Perverse and insidious.
At least, Tony is fully hard now. That's already a win.
Steve swallowed a chuckle and gave up on the idea to have his boyfriend help him on the homestretch. He let Tony play in the bed while he threw his clothes one by one in the boxes. He didn't have much in the first place but he still had left most of them here when he left and never made the effort to get them afterward. He just shamelessly let his boyfriend shower him with gifts.
Maybe he parted his lips a little when a surge of lust flushed through him. Obviously Tony and him didn't have the same kind of sparring in mind, at the moment. Which didn't really matter either way because Steve had this thing to do first. His gaze lingered on the bulge anyway to finish its course down his boyfriend's sturdy thighs and his strong calves outlined by his red and gold boxing shoes.
Tony welcomed him back warmly. It was a relief for him too, part of him still considers Steve as his omega. Even if the word has always felt strange on his tongue.
to accept and it's time for you too. Accept it, Tony. Accept me. Accept
"Should I take that as a
Tony turned to him abruptly and stared questioningly into his eyes. "Really?"
Tony straightened up though and he swiveled slowly on his feet to stand right in front of the painting. And finally,
He wants to make them his.
in a good way."
"We could see each other more, you know, if we lived together..." Tony stated matter-of-factly. They could. They should, probably. Tony had wanted them to, for a while now, and had made his intentions clear. Steve had been more reluctant, although he couldn't say exactly why. They were still trying to find the perfect place, still, maybe that was why.
A normal person, alpha or not, that's not even the point, would be dead asleep in their bed right now.  And yet one whiff of the sweet smell of omega arousal and he's back at it like a horny frustrated teenager. Every inch of his body demands him to jump on the omega and screw him brainless, knot him again and again and again until he passes out. What is wrong with him? At his age he should need help to get a hard on already. Why does his body react so intensely right now, a slave to the omega's needs?
Steve felt a shiver all over. How did they even
"Buck and I hated each other at first." Clint said, grin huge on his face. He looked so eager to look back on the beginning of his relationship with Bucky.
right.
Tony crosses his arms too and shrugs. "I don't think Steve would like to be Mrs Stark... And we're just—we've just moved in together. Marriage is... so far away from our current life."
"Why would you think I'd lie about something like this?" He replied curtly. Then he stared into his eyes, something indescribable on his face. All the tenderness from before gone, in an instant. He smiled and it looked a little cold. "You don't believe me, do you?" He whispered resignedly. "You
for both of them. He was so fucking beautiful.
The nasty tattooed brunette was there, a glimpse of concern in her eyes and he hated her for that. She gave them drinks anyway. Tony wasn't sure who paid. He looked at her with regret. He should have been nicer to her. If he had maybe she wouldn't look at him the way she was looking at him right now. He should have really tried it on with her, be nice and honest, instead of going on the hunt for cocks. Maybe he could have spent the rest of the night with her. Maybe she would have been kind to him. Maybe he could have fucked her gently. Or maybe she really was a dyke but she would have taken him to his place anyway and they would have talked and cuddled. She would forgive him for calling her a dyke, would she?
Sam's hand grabbed her hip so gently and fondled her lower belly very discreetly. "We...hum...I..." Natasha really was blushing now, a soft smile on her lips. "We're gonna be parents." She finally said, almost shamefully. They both looked very happy and fulfilled however.
Steve was fully hard now and started grinding against his boyfriend, settling himself right in the cleft of his firm ass. His hands were more assertive, his caresses more intense. His fingers slipped underneath Tony's shirt and started touching, hot fingertips against the tense muscles. Tony squirmed and Steve slowed down at first but didn't lose his determination when his boyfriend seemed so responsive. He kept fondling him and slipped a hand down Tony's pants. Tony was fully hard now, too, and Steve really wanted to taste him, first thing in the morning. His mouth already salivated at the thought. He could already picture himself crawling underneath the cover, up Tony's thighs, and getting a whiff of his musky scent before swallowing him down. He let his hand wrap itself around Tony's girth, with all the best intentions, but Tony writhed and disentangled himself, whining in protest.
It was dark when they got out of the apartment.
"To the hospital."
"Omegas are supposed to have heats." He explains, voice pervaded with growing lust. "I want to have heats again."
"Who's Jarvis?"
Good. Because Tony is already leaking. Where does his sudden energy come from? He feels ecstatic, horny and powerful, like the world is his.
Steve wished he could have taken the time to make it feel good, to make it last, but he was so fucking turned on right now he barely could think and he didn't even take the time to properly take his clothes off. He aligned himself between Tony's legs and grabbed his naked hips. Tony was rock hard and the head of his cock jolted up, already leaking at the top.
or taken advantage of by other alphas... Having heats again means the end of his freedom. "If we both get off our suppressants, you do realize that our cycle will synchronize? We'll have our heats at the same time!" Bucky doesn't seem to see things that way though... Maybe because he's got nothing to lose.
And he hates himself even more when he knows James doesn't look at him like that, because he has accepted. And that's maybe the worst of it.
Tony crawled into it and rolled into the covers, immersing himself into the comforting musky smell of Steve. He finally relaxed, feeling the uneasiness fade slowly. His head was spinning and hurt like a hammer was pounding his skull. He had never come down that low after crystal meth. Had he taken too much? Probably... When had he ever been reasonable anyway? He ate the yogurt without conviction, fidgety while waiting for Steve. The creepy crawly dirtiness still bothered him. He was on edge. He wanted Steve to come out so much, put his hands on him again, hold him tight, make him feel better. Maybe he would plant soft kisses on his forehead, shush him when he shivered, run slender fingers through his hair softly in a loving, comforting gesture. Maybe Tony wouldn't feel like he was rotten then. Maybe Steve would soothe the putrefying pain he felt inside.
Tony's eyes opened wide and a let escape a laugh of relieve, smiling spreading wide on his face. His dark eyes shining like stars in the darkening room. The alpha was so mysteriously handsome.
In a flash of lucidity, Tony wondered what he was doing here, with those guys, in this sordid place, but the feeling didn't last long enough. He was too fucking tired to dwell on it and the perverted glint in their eyes reminded him well why he was here. He had waited all fucking night for it. Finally someone was going to treat him the way he deserved to be treated, like the trash, piss-drinking whore, depraved cum-dump pain slut that he was. Finally someone was gonna make him forget about the nauseous uneasiness and putrefying anguish that churned his stomach and made him want to crawl out of his own body to escape it. They were gonna fuck it out him. Tony couldn't wait for it.
You don't even know shit about him, or us. There was nothing serious in our relationship. The only person Stephen ever cared about is himself." Steve could see on everyone's face how they disagreed though.
Something dark and dangerous glimmered in Tony's eyes. It was brutal and aggressive and Steve was hypnotized by the intensity in those eyes for a minute. It was unexpected and out of character. Steve would have expected Tony to laugh out loud, throwing his head back, or smile shyly, looking sidelong with a coy expression, or jump out of excitement, or even look down on him with contempt and anger, maybe. But not this fierceness. Not this dark and rude determination. Tony's hand was suddenly around his neck, pressing a little. Steve's heart raced and for a split second, he felt the terror paralyze him. His mind went back ten years ago, with Johann, and he gasped, eyes locked into Tony's. Stunned.
Tony jerked his head up and stared at him sidelong like an affront, a glimpse of mischievousness in his eyes and a provocative smile that he was sensually trying to bite back. He chuckled tauntingly, being purposely cheeky. Steve felt the urge to smack him on the face but refrained, clenching his fists instead.
"Were you on the receiving or the giving end?"
Steve almost choked on his own saliva. Bucky blushed but didn't deny it. Everyone else laughed, kindly.
"Food was amazing by the way." Steve blurted, trying—oh so bravely—to find a way out. "You should try it."
Tony led him to his bed and lay him down on it before lying next to him, snuggling against him. "Don't bite me, okay?" He asked, a little worriedly. It sounded more than a warning than a request though.
For a moment he forgets about everything else. He forgets about Felicia. About James. About the betrayal, about the hurt. It's only him, and Steve. Just like it used to be. No. Nothing like it used to be. It never was so honest, so open and genuine between them. For a moment he can feel Steve's heart beating in unison with his own. Connected forever. For a moment he can feel what Steve feels and he stares at the pulsating gland on his neck, wondering if it's only his imagination or if he can really feel the sweet burning pain throbbing on his own neck.
"I don't wanna break up with you, Steve." Tony admitted, voice sounding hurt. "You're the one—" His voice faltered, broken at the edges. "You're the only person I wanna spend the rest of my life with—" He stopped, expression suddenly worried. Steve's heart leapt as the "rest of my life" words slipped out of his boyfriend's mouth. He stared up at Tony with wide open eyes, short of words. His boyfriend's face was crestfallen, afraid he had said too much, too early.
Behind him Tony is soft enough to slip out of him and lies down as well, looking at them from afar, catching his breath. He's gonna need a moment before he can knot Bucky the way the omega needs it and therefore it is Steve's duty to take care of the omega and prepare him for the alpha. Luckily, he knows exactly what to do.
His father was right after all, Tony was meant for greater achievements.
Himself through Steve's eyes.
The voice was extremely warm and soft. It sounded like honey and smelled like wood fire and it felt so soft Steve immediately saw himself cuddled under his mum's plushy comforter with a hot chocolate and marshmallows in hand in front of his favorite TV show. God, he was such a baby it was pathetic.
The door opened invitingly. Tony gestured him to come inside. Steve scanned the spacious compartment inside and saw no sign of Natasha's presence. He frowned again, suspicious. "Are you alone?"
Tony looked down and chuckled, slightly bitterly. "Well maybe for
Tony's explanation landed flat though. Nothing he said seemed to calm his boyfriend's rage down.
Tony laughed, amused. "Is that a compliment, Rogers?"
The good thing was that he didn't need to make a choice anymore because someone else did it for him. He saw a black limo—not his dad's—pull up in front of him and stared at it blankly. The door opened on its own and the man gave him a gentle look, smirking a little. "Get in."
"And you're just entering the prime of your masculinity. You're just sexier than ever."
Tony shrugs. "I quit nicotine..."
How wrong could he be? No matter how pretty the jail is, this is still prison. No matter how long the rope is, it is still around his neck. They could pretend, oh yes they could. They did.
They kissed again. Hot and urgent and filthy this time. Hungry and touched-starved. It felt like something Steve had missed his whole life. Something he had wanted—
"Major disagreement, I guess. I don't know..."
"You liked it when they fucked your throat until you bled? You
Clint leans against him and pats his shoulder again, pressing it with a strong hand. His face is very close and he almost whispers in his ear. His voice is hoarse. "Yeah but... you'd like to be Mrs Rogers, right?"
had been a complete shock. And when Steve turned to them, he was faced with three pairs of wide-opened eyes and three square jaws hanging slack.
"You should..." Tony said ominously.
"You don't want that to happen again, don't you?"
"That's perfectly normal. You'll get used to them. And it's only at the beginning."
Steve shook his head. His chuckle sounded mirthless.
Steve climbed inside and took the drink, he needed it. He emptied it in one gulp and felt the alcohol rush to his head. A wave of warmth spread inside his entire body. Tony stared at him, smiling. He stared back, undressing him with his eyes. He felt a tremor in his jaw, a huge amount of self-control was needed not to crawl to him and strip him naked. Tony chuckled, staring at him sidelong, eyes glimmering wantonly in the dim light of the car. He was obviously having a great time messing with Steve.
Except Steve was mad. Furious and exasperated.
Unable to subdue Tony, the guy turned his rage toward Steve and things escalated. Tony panicked and felt like his heart was going to explode. He could hardly move or think straight at this point but if one of those guys tried to lay a finger on Steve, he would have to kill them. He quickly looked around to study his surroundings and find potential weapons. He spotted a few things that could do the trick—Tony knew one or two ways to kill someone barehanded anyway. He started to elaborate a strategy to get up and get to those weapons before one of them could reach Steve. Then, he prepared his plan of attack. Tony could probably take two down by surprise. The third one would be trickier, besides, trying to move a limb was kind of an ordeal at this precise moment, and he didn't feel like killing dark-haired guy yet, some misplaced affection surely...
"My parents are both alphas." Sam answered.
"Sharing your heat with your alpha should be a beautiful moment..." The Omega mumbled into his arms, huddled up on his knees. "Not something that needs to be done because there's no other choice."
Steve startled at the unexpected rejection but wrapped his arms around him and scooted closer. He searched Tony's nose, nuzzling against him. "Then I'll come back to yours." He said, although there was a tinge of insecurity in his tone.
Tony grimaced and smiled sheepishly. "Is it a bad thing if the answer to that question is
He grabbed his hands and swirled him around to hold both his wrists in one hand, pinning them behind his back. With his other hand he grabbed his nape possessively—not squeezing, not hurting, just holding him—and he walked them to their bedroom. He brutally pushed him onto the bed, on his knees, without ever hurting him, and pressed on his nape softly to anchor him to the bed. Still holding his hands behind his back in a strong grip, he adjusted Steve's position on the bed with a gentle hand on his waist and thrust into him.
Clint doesn't comment, Tony just hears him humming. "I'll make you something special." He mutters softly and a few moments later, after some chopping and whirring, Clint's handing him a huge glass of something that looks like a smoothie but smells a lot like rum. Tony takes it, a little perplexed, and takes a tentative sip. He almost lets out a moan while the liquid warms his throat.
Steve looked at the door, frozen, feeling helpless. It was the first time his boyfriend reacted so angrily. Usually he would close up and flee or shrug things off, brush them off with a strained smile. Steve was the one who usually lost it and shouted and burst out. It was so unlike Tony that Steve was disconcerted for a moment.
Tony stood tall and proud in a rather extravagant and improbably colored suit. He was absolutely gorgeous. On his arm, snuggling against him, was Natasha in a dazzling fuchsia sheath dress, smiling dangerously at the crowd.
He felt a shiver run down his spine and a flow of slick wet his pants. Bucky smelt it and his scent spiked.
"Yeah, Tony, do tell!" Bucky topped, smile mischievous. "I think I've heard something about love at first sight... I wanna know everything about it! How did you guys meet? 'cause I don't think any of us know actually."
"We said it was temporary..." Tony said hesitantly.
Tony held on his promises.
that? Even just once in your life? I
Tony's adventurous hand wandered down his pants. "I can help you if you need." but Steve stopped him with an abrupt grip on his hand.
Tony laughed but it sounded bitter. "I'm scaring you?" He asked incredulously.
"But that won't go with the flowers, will it?"
"I understand."
"Steve?" Steve jerked his head on the side, at the gentle and slightly concerned voice. "You alright?"
Tony listens, flabbergasted. He doesn't know what to say, he doesn't know what to think. He doesn't know what he feels anymore. He doesn't know
" Steve yelled, jaw shivering with rage and anger pervading in his voice.
"How old were you when you presented?" Steve asked, after a long lingering silence.
Tony laughed. "Why are you so angry?" He asked innocently. He knew, though, very well, how Steve would react to his impromptu visit. "Surely you didn't think I wouldn't jump on the first opportunity I had to visit your workplace... I've wanted to come here for
James wants him, or his knot. Or both, maybe, who know?
Tony smiled back at her, charmed, and hoisted himself on his feet, grabbing her waist possessively, smiling enticingly.
"Haven't we?" Tony asked.
Tony smiled and breathed out, blowing warm and seductive air onto Steve's lips. "Rogers..." He slurred. "It's cute that you still think you can say no to me." Tony's eyes were hungry, lust pooling in them. His mouth was dangerously close, lips lifting just enough to show his teeth. His hands caged Steve while his body pressed against his, grinding, trying to find a place between Steve's legs. Steve had no chance. His boyfriend started nuzzling into his neck, sniffing him like a dog. He nibbled and bit, following the trail of his tense muscles down to his collarbone.
It felt like electricity running through his body. Steve's breathing hitched and he withdrew his hand as quickly as if he had been burnt. They stared into each other's eyes, both startled, both confused. And Tony smiled again. A shy, insecure smile.
"You sure it's alright with you?"
Tony nodded silently and went back to work, the mood suddenly quiet and studious. Not a word was exchanged but the atmosphere around them felt blissfully warm and soothing. The erratic scratching of Tony's pencil on paper, the only thing Steve could hear. Tony was deeply immersed in his work and Steve spent a long moment contemplating him, unable to focus on anything else. An unsettling warmth pooled in his stomach and spread in his entire body. He let his eyes wander away and observed the garden outside. He could even hear the birds if he paid attention.
"Liar. I'm sure you've been secretly dreaming about it. Protecting me until I present so when I do, I'll turn to you. Smart, uh? Admit it!"
They both hurried inside, Sam because he was eager to meet their friends and have fun, Steve because he was afraid to get caught and felt a little guilty to break the rules.
Nothing had changed, Steve guessed, not really.
When his mouth is empty again, Tony decides to take action. He splays his hand on Loki's knee and leans into his personal space, staring right into his eyes.
Obie snorted. "Tony..." He whispered condescendingly, "my boy," and took Tony's hand in his. "You understand why I had to punish you, right?"
A bond that is a blessing as well as a curse.
"Hey, Omega bitch! How much for a blowjob?"
, when we fuck each other to oblivion that I feel free. The rest of the time I'm just running away from who I am. This is not freedom. It's my own self-made jail."
omega and get the alpha to give him what he needs and give the alpha what
"No." He exclaimed. "I don't wanna use you like that. I can manage."
You see, he wasn't good at this. He had never been good at handling the journalists or anything that required for him to speak in public. In fact, he was an absolute disaster when he needed to speak in public and tonight just proved his point once again.
"I'm pretty sure they can survive one hour without you. I would even bet they could survive for a whole afternoon."
"No." Tony rushes to answer, feeling a little caught off guard. Steve never wanted to go public before. Actually he made a point of hiding Tony from the rest of the world as his dirty little secret. "Not at all."
Tony twitched and grabbed the hand on his shoulder to return the soft gesture. He turned his face to Steve and smiled. "Thanks." He whispered, blowing warm breath on Steve's nose. "For the coffee." And then he went back to his intricate schematics. Steve knew better than to insist.
—but since they were dating, their dates had been rather modest and discreet. Nothing official. Nothing...like
His boyfriend pinched his lips and despite being all flustered and embarrassed, he threw a challenging glance at Steve that meant he was gonna go through with it and tell everyone about that first day they met that, despite what Tony thought, Steve remembered very well.
When they finally dozed off and Steve felt himself fall into a restorative slumber. Tony stirred next to him and placed a hand on his chest. "Steve...." He whispered, sounding a little worried. "Has it happened before?"
They're both completely high when Tony opens his eyes. He giggles softly and wiggles against Clint, seeking the warmth of his body. He stares at his stubble again, picking up things where he had left them off. His finger traces a line on his jaw and Tony stares at the way his mouth is slightly curled up at the corners and then he stares at his teeth that he can barely see. He's horny, he realizes, and knows he tends to be when he's feeling uneasy. It's a defense mechanism. Getting intoxicated didn't dull the discomfort in his heart. He wonders how it would feel like, comfort sex with Clint. Objectively speaking Clint is hot. In Tony's standards anyway. He wouldn't mind fucking Clint right now. Fuck and forget.
He needed a drink.
"—Just..." Tony interrupted, biting his nails nervously. "It really gets better, you know. Never forget that."
Thank you so much to the few of you who took the time to leave encouraging comments or kudos. I am forever grateful! :)
to get over you."
They kept fucking after that. Not like before. Not everyday. More like, whenever it became too hard to be constantly around Tony without being able to get it from him. Sometimes because it simply felt good and comforting, sometimes because Bucky was pretty and his smile gave Steve warm and fuzzy feelings.
Steve's cheeks flushed red and started burning. "He's doing really great, for the record. Talked to him recently. Has a boyfriend. Long-term. Four years or something. Job's amazing. I did apologize and we're
Obie came nearer and brushed his fingers along his jawline, making him shiver with mixed feelings. "I'm sorry I have been neglecting you lately. I'm gonna change that."
"JARVIS,
get his freedom taken away.
He was curious.
He stretched his back away from Tony and looked at him, full of intent. "Shower with me?"
Clint has finally found what he was looking for and is now rolling a joint while standing next to the bed. He just shrugs without looking up from it. "What? Told you, we're experimenting. It's fun. Put that away, will you? There's a box under the bed."
"Mr Rogers!"
Tony made a weird grimace. "Yeah." He said. "Like me. Or like... Pepper. I'm sorry Steve... I'm trying to understand the logic behind your train of thought but I really don't follow. Is it that important to you? I mean I really don't care what I am or what you are."
Clint is already taking a drag, the burning end of the joint lights up, hiding the proud grin on his face. He sucks the smoke in and blows it out in a soft chuckle. "Stop acting like a prude. I know how kinky you are!" He says while sitting on the bed and holding the joint to Tony's mouth.
Now that the school year is over. Now that they both graduated with flying colors, Tony especially, it has been a little arduous for them to see each other but they make do. They find time. They trick Tony's parents. It's not that they're interested in spending time with and get to know who their only son is anyway. The last days have been the hottest of the summer and Tony's parent's are away, to a place where the heat is much more bearable. Tony has stayed, pretending the need to take care of last minutes necessities before settling down in the dorms. Tony will leave for Boston on Monday, to attend special advanced summer programs before starting college.
That explained why he still felt it burn like someone had kept punching him in his lower back and broken his tail and hip bones.
"It's alright." he muttered in a husky voice.
Tony smiled and stepped closer, shattering his way in Steve's personal space again. "Yeah. Obviously". He muttered, voice sounding husky. He started kissing his way down Steve's neck, planting soft delicate kisses along his jaw.
Steve took another deep breath, praying for his lungs to hold up, and started running, as fast as he could. He took unexpected turns, in order to lose them but he could still hear their voices far away. They were shouting. Steve felt the sudden need to cry. Like, why? Why did he have to endure all of this?
"Loverboy over there..."
Tony chuckled incredulously and teased Steve with a mischievous smile. "You obviously more..." He said mockingly. "
soft, and well-groomed.
could it? No, Tony must be wrong. It must be James...
Steve snapped his mouth shut and listened, his hands still rubbing gently on both sides of his face.

One day.
"I really meant to congratulate you though, you were just really irritating. I needed you to shut up for once."
pup, maybe with Steve's. Maybe both of them will be pregnant after this. It's happening, he feels tears of joy running down his cheeks. Or maybe those are Steve's as he's begging, raw and needy, hungry for the alpha's knot. Bucky can feel the urgent, overpowering
He got back to work but then dialed Pepper's number one last time.
Steve burst out laughing.
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat. "Tony stop! Nothing like that happened. Believe me, you'd have known!"
They clink their glasses while staring at their respective lovers and drink a first swig. Tony is glad to have something in his hand again and he enjoys the bitter taste of his beer but something's missing.
He explained in a soft smile, "if that's not dumping, then what is it?" He didn't wait for Steve's answer and sighed. "But whatever, I guess I deserved that." He concluded.
"Get off your suppressants yourself then, I don't need to get involved." He finally says, sounding a little bitter. Part of him doesn't seem to like this idea either but he doesn't know why...
hug right now, apparently it's still the case.
"It was just friendly." Natasha explained, face flushed. "We asked about each other from time to time, nothing more—"
Everyone started smiling fondly and Tony blushed realizing what he had said and how much everyone was hanging to his every word. Judging. How much Steve couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Steve didn't answer but Tony must have seen how he felt about it on his face because something shone in his eyes. His jaw was clenching as he seemed to be biting back what he had meant to say but soon the anger left his features to leave place to a deeper sadness.
"You know what the real problem is?" Bucky says more seriously. "You're shitting your pants, that's all."
Tony laughed and this time it was happy and relaxed. "I thought
You don't know how much time I have to spend now not to look decrepit in the morning. I've got
Tony tilted his head on the side, smile teasing. "Ooh Steve..." He just said fondly, without going any further into the matter and Steve felt himself blush.  "And there's also that Loki guy..." He then added.
Steve swallowed down a growl and let him go, finally. They should go to class. They left the bathroom hand in hand. Steve had never been so happy in his entire life.
Tony went back to work silently and efficiently and stopped bothering him. Steve should have done that earlier, he thought, because they were finished in less than two hours and only Steve's bedroom remained now. They both headed there and Tony stretched his back and complained. Steve rolled his eyes and ignored him.
When he finally thrusts into him it's slow and gentle but deep and hard. He builds their orgasm slowly, thrust after thrust, clutching so hard on the omega's hips. This time his omega cries in pleasure. This time it's not urgent and necessary. It's desired and fully accepted. It's glorious. It's magical. It's wonderful.
He would take what he would find anyway. He had a load of cash, a nice history with sordid, he should be able to find what he needed quite easily.
"Wait..." He mumbled while reaching a trembling but determined hand to Tony's neck. He tugged on his collar and it was there, discreet, inconspicuous but unmistakable in his state. The soft reddish scent gland of an omega. "You're omega!?!" He choked out, unable to believe his own eyes.
Clint turns to him and stares at him questioningly, expression confused at first. "I thought you quit."
Steve wanted him gone anyway.
He tried to move at first but every time he attempted to push himself up he was barely able to lift a few inches of himself off the toilet bowl and inexorably fell back on it as if the shackles tied him to the bowl, so he gave up and lay there, agonizing. His stomach roiled and he felt sick. He wanted to cry, so much, maybe he whimpered softly, he wasn't sure. He was still shaking. He didn't want to get up anyway. To do what? He might as well spend the rest of his life there, chained to that bowl, covered in cum and piss and shit and ready to satisfy anyone who wanted. That was all he was good for anyway.
