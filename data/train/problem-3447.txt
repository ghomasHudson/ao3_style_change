So while Castiel’s peers are at the mall or the movies or getting drunk in each other’s basements, Castiel is standing in the aisle of the local convenience store that holds the truly terrible dramatic and romantic paperbacks.
When Dean stalks into the house, exhausted and un-showered from three days of consistent travel, Sam practically leaps on him, demanding answers.
He tears out of the house, Krissy shouting after him, Kevin saying, “Let him go. He needs some time.”
“Well, whatever it is, it’s clearly more important to you than us,” Gina says, and Dean would love to call her crazy, blame this whole thing on her, call her ‘possessive’ and ‘clingy’, but she’s none of those things. He’s the problem. Not her.
And then he’s gone-- Castiel can feel the shift in the air. Dean sags in relief and grabs Castiel’s arm to drag him back into the house.
They talk and talk for the rest of the night. Dean tells Castiel about everything he can think of: Sam’s school stories, the garage, Paul and Nick and Jude and some of their nights on the town. Castiel responds with his own stories about living in Sioux Falls, the people he’s met, some of the hunts he’s been on. Dean had been anticipating that after his revelation, the night would descend into horrible awkwardness, but that moment just doesn’t come. On the contrary, he didn’t think he and Castiel had ever talked this much, not so casually, about their lives. They had always had some greater purpose, some more pressing issue on their minds, no time to tell meaningless anecdotes for laughs.
“I’ve had worse, Cas,” Dean says, struggling to sit up in the bed, eyes searching the room for his shoes. “They whacked me a couple times with a hoe, big deal.”
“Hey,” Dean says softly. “I’m serious. I’m... you know me, Cas, I’m an idiot. I say the dumbest shit. I’m sorry.”
“Damn it, Cas!” Dean barks, and Castiel finally shuts up. “I don’t give a shit how powerful you are. I just want you to be happy and you’re the most miserable piece-of-shit human I’ve ever met.”
“You are not my friend,” Dean growls. “Fortunately for you, I don’t want to kill you. I promised Sammy that he could have that particular pleasure. I want your brother. Where’s Alastair?”
He doesn’t know how long he sits there and watches Dean, but the sky turns the color of a bruise and the forest is dark before Dean finally sits up, his arms trembling.
And sometimes it’s to protect and reassure, after close encounters with monsters. Sometimes it happens while they’re laughing, and they can feel each other smiling. Sometimes it’s angry, because time has been wasted. Sometimes it hurts and hurts and hurts, and there’s blood in their mouths and on their hands and nothing they say or do can make it better. But sometimes it’s like believing again, believing that one day they will be like this in a bed, or in Dean’s car, or on the couch next to Sam, who will make faces and groan but be
, this child is a part of you. I saw within Dean's soul, his deepest desires in life, and you were one of them."
Sam jumps in attention, having just now realized some of this jumbled up venting is directed at him, not just Castiel.
He forced his eyes open then, ready to correct whatever mess his brother had created. Both the doctor and his brother turned to look at him, the doctor looked pleased, and his brother relieved.
He scrubs his face with one hand while the other supports his weight on the table. He's already on his feet and pulling up his shirt just to show them because if he has to say it twice he'll scream.
It'll be like ripping off a band-aid or pouring alcohol on an open wound. He just needed to do it fast before he could talk himself out of it.
"Why?" Sam asks before he can stop himself. Hurriedly he adds, "I mean-I'm not saying no, it's just...why now?"
The gel wasn't as cold as Dean was expecting but he couldn't be sure, he wasn't really paying any attention to himself now. Sam was right at his side, hand hovering over his brother's. He knew that Dean would probably call him a bitch or start compairing them to an expectant couple, but Sam wanted his brother to know that he was there.
Dean made Castiel memorize every single one of his aliases so he wouldn't get caught in a bind if he were on a hunt by himself. But now, it seems to come in handy, knowing all of this information as he steps back to let the woman work and turns back to the clipboard.
Cas looks over at the man, incredulous. Like the idea of getting to name his child was ever on the docket. The angel (doesn't matter if he doesn't have his grace anymore or not, he's still an angel to Dean) leans in to Dean reaching for both of his hands.
Absently, he reached into his pocket, not even looking at the caller ID because it was probably Sam.
He waits outside of Sam's room, standing in the doorway as the younger Winchester opens a box on top of his dresser. It appears to be a jewelry box, and it holds more than just Dean's amulet, but Castiel doesn't pry for the other pieces that the box holds.
"Sam?" Dean calls and the paramedic thinks, for a moment, that he's injured his head far worse than they thought.
Stomping off toward the entrance, he grumbles under his breath. He never thought he could relate to women so much. But here he was, pregnant and hating all of the men in his life. Stupid non-pregnant bastards.
A sound from the hallway pulled them both out of their thoughts. The doctor knocked on the door and at Sam's voice, he rolled in a large screen with multiple accessories and a small keypad.
When they broke apart, slowly making their way back to the impala, a haggard looking Crowley and weary Castiel were waiting for them. This had been a shitshow.
The sheriff was quiet on the other end of the line. She was half tempted to pack the girls up and head straight to the bunker.
Dean was watching the board with the incoming flights listed, so far, the one from Washington hadn't yet arrived.
He and Claire share a look of relief over Dean's head and wisely ignore his muttering as he opens the package.
"Did I say that out loud?" Dean asked and the paramedic started reaching behind Dean to check the bandaging on his head.
Sam shares a look with Castiel and the two nod. It's heart wrenching, the sounds Dean makes when they pull away. It's almost as if they were hacking off pieces of him by pulling away, but he's still whole when they part.
pants. Mainly for later in his pregnancy, but still they would work and jody said she could cut out the lining of his jeans and replace them with elastic if all else failed.
She doesn't stay that way long, nodding her head as she slowly pulls her hands away. Dean wants to cry even more, but he knows he can't make her stay there anymore than he can make himself leave.
Dean was curled up around his pillow and subtly sniffling while Sam and Alex went to the store to get more pickles.
"Sick. Not much else to it doc, but my brother said I should come down here and double check...so...here I am."
Sam nodded. "I'm not upset about that," he starts, but at his brother's expression he rolls his eyes. "All right, maybe if I was younger or even a little less mature, I
His hand rests on his shoulder for a second before Dean is launching himself at Sam. The car rocks with the sudden movement, the bench seat between them however, doesn't budge. But Dean doesn't care. His arms are around Sam's neck, pulling him as close as the space permits and if Sam is surprised, he doesn't show it.
Which led them here, Dean, Sam, and Claire, waiting for the arrivals near the baggage claim. Dean had been seething earlier. After he had found out Castiel was without his grace on another fucking continent, Dean had chewed his ass out. Honestly, the feather-head should be glad that Jody hadn't been able to come.
Taking the clipboard, Dr. Mercury cleared his throat. His eyes scanned over the words on the paper he had attached to its clip. Pulling from his pocket a pen, he asked, "Are you in the process of transitioning or undergoing any current sex transformation?"
Dean doesn't expect Sam to answer, that's his only saving grace, but Dean's still venting, so Sam's still listening.
"He needs to be in the back." Sam says, already unbuckling his brother's seatbelt for him, trusting the angel can carry his weight, even if he no longer had his angelic strength.
Jody smiles, a secret smile to herself, and waits for Dean to catch up as they make for the checkout.
There's something in his tone that has Sam turning around. Dean is half-standing and half-sitting near the edge of his bed. Despite the giant pregnancy pillow not two feet away, Dean is, frankly, intimidating. That posture makes it look like he's rearing to lunge at him, and Sam doesn't want to risk wrestling with pregnant Dean.
He felt like a zombie by the time the sun rose. He was roused by the sound off his alarm going off. He rolled over and turned on his phone. There was a tiny icon that had appeared, reminding Castiel of his task for the day.
He felt guilty for looking so long, but he couldn't fucking help it! It’s not Castiel’s fault that Dean is perfect!!!
Castiel woke up at eight, a pained groan escaping from his chapped lips. The model’s head ached, and his stomach churned violently. He felt something on his shoulder, and he forced his eyes open. A red flannel rested on top of him. It was draped over his shoulder, and one of the sleeves lied against his cheek. He moved a hand to touch it, rubbing his fingers between the soft fabric. It had an overwhelming aroma of pine trees and mint.
Castiel broke into a grin, a rare sight on him, as he looked between Dean and the novel in his hands. “It is extremely good, but I think most would find it particularly boring. Not enough slow burn between the couple.”
Today would be the first time he goes out. The model was being forced to go to a coffee shop with Meg. She kept telling him that he couldn’t hide forever.
Castiel’s firm hand hand moved impossibly further down. Every touch made Dean fall deeper into something.... something he had never felt before.
“Hell yeah! His hair is always crazy messy, and I always wondered what it would be like to run my hand through—And God—his eyes!!! They are crazy blue.”
Dean felt as if he just gotten sucker punched. He flinched when hearing the angel’s name, heart aching.
When Dean left the cafe, shouting profanities as he went (and a possible wink, but it’s debatable), Gabriel sat across from his brother.
Castiel perked up when Gabriel said ‘date’. His hooded eyes darted up to Dean’s, a tense look on his face.
He went home late last night, slipping into his apartment and closing the door silently behind him. He was nervous.
Thank you all so much for the wonderful comments and kudos! This chapter is a fluffy mess. Hope you enjoy!
Dean sighed. “Cas.... I’m sorry to ask this of you—I know your busy a lot with modeling and all that other shit—and don't feel pressured to say yes... Can you be my plus one? I really need someone to go with me, and I have no idea who to take....”
But most of his dreams revolved around his father, John. All the nights Dean had to sober up his father, all the wasted days that Dean would spend trying to impress him. John had become unstable after their mother’s death, and Dean was forced to deal with the after math.
Dean smiled. Before he could say anything, Castiel’s phone rung. The man sighed glumly, turning on his device.
The man looked exhausted. His hair had not been styled today, ruffled the way Castiel loved so much. He only wore a thin T shirt and jeans. His eyes were bloodshot, more than they had been over the past couple couple of weeks. His mouth was twisted into a frown, and in his hands was a white cane
The contact surprised him, and Dean couldn't control the tiny sound that escaped his lips. He took Castiel’s arm, slinging it over his shoulder.
The model spared a quick glance At the man next to him. “My family wasn’t in the best financial situation at the time.”
And Dean did NOT help. At all. He kept begging him to stay longer, his charming—er—stupid grin egging him on.
Dean gaped in disbelief, waving Gabriel over to see his brother. He sighed, shaking his head. “Cassie has been working really hard as of late. He has a crap-ton of work to take care of.”
Dean extended his arm, holding out the coffee cup. Castiel took it, wrapping his hands around the cylindrical surface. He nodded in the blonde student’s direction. “So you’ve met Claire, I see.”
The middle aged man sighed. “You know, at first I was unconvinced.... but now I am positive. You definitely have the hots for him—
For the first time, he pitied the thing. It was confused, cold, knew nothing. It was trapped in itself.
Dean nestled closer, hand moving up to Castiel’s right shoulder. His calloused hand rested on bare skin. The model could feel hot breath against his neck, causing chills to run up his spine.
He was leading Dean to the kitchen when the man tripped over a floor board. He accidentally fell into Castiel, their bodies pressing together.
Dean’s voice broke, cracking with emotion. “Cas... when you left—You said that you loved me—And I couldn’t tell you....” His words died in the back of his throat.
Castiel nodded. “Not a big deal though. The relationship ended before it really could begin, honestly. I was not ready for the commitment at my age—”
Dean continued. “The world has not treated me badly. I have gotten to meet people I wouldn’t have if I didn't go blind. If I still had my sight, I would probably still be in Kansas.... I would not have met you.”
He tried to sound enthusiastic, but his voice was weak. “Then why are you hesitating? If this is your dream, you should do it.”
Castiel knew what that was supposed to mean. Sam was saying their were acting like a married couple...
“You are. You have a wonderful speech and you look more handsome than anyone there will. Everyone will think you look hot—er—handsome.”
Gabriel grabbed the bouquet of flowers. “Okay, people, Sam wants me for himself. Time for me to throw this thing!”
The model chocked on his spit, wiping the corner of his mouth his sleeve. Be tried to act indifferent, but his voice cracked. “What about him?”
Castiel’s hand moved down to the small of Dean’s back, sending a chill running up his spine. “Do you think you can fall back asleep, or do you want to stay up?”
Dean faced away from the model, bowing his head to the floor. Castiel couldn’t see that the man’s face was red. “You’re different than a lot of people I’ve met.”
They were able to get into the library with no problems. Castiel led Dean through the different isles, looking for an interesting book to read. An idea popped into his head.
Dean pulled at Castiel’s hand, bringing him into a hug. Castiel was surprised at first, but then melted into him. He choked back a sob, which left his lips in a strangled sigh.
Dean was less shocked. “Really? Are you two having this argument again??? I’m sure that you can get a wedding cake AND a healthy option.”
So he drove, only stopping to refill the car. At one point, one of the tires blew out when hitting a nail. He settled on hot-wiring the closest car he could lay his hands on.
He gave up on rest about an hour after Dean had left, picking up the horror novel and struggling over the words. He was getting better at reading Braille, but he still took a while to read. He had to translate every letter before moving forward.
The model felt his dry throat shake, and the words tumbled from his lips. “It is true that I find men... aesthetically pleasing.”
Dean was the ‘I’ll sleep when I’m dead’ type of person. He would use almost every waking moment working towards something productive. He hadn’t taken a break from work for as long as he could remember.
After calming Dean down, they walked to the car and drove to the airport. Castiel could see his neighbor growing more anxious by the second. He drummed his fingers against the car door, biting his lip.
Dean giggled—actually giggled—shutting the velvet box and shoving it back into his pocket. “You heard me. I’m proposing!”
Dean proceeds to bite Sam’s hand. He yelps in surprise, flinching away from the hunter as fast as he could.
He spoke again about a minute later, his voice as low as thunder during a storm. Dean could imagine the blue of his eyes, stirring around in his irises like the sea.
Which meant that they would be flying on a plane together (which he had a serious fear of). They would then be spending eight days straight together; eating, drinking, talking.
He grumbled in response, walking over to an empty table. He looked over his shoulder at Gabriel, ignoring the cocky smile on Castiel’s face. “Can I get my usual?”
Castiel found himself in Dean’s hotel room, hovering over the bed. The bartender was already in the shower, washing away the day.
Like this is what he should what been doing his whole life. Spending each morning with Cas, talking together, walking to work, binge watching ‘NotNatural’ together—
But the bartender denied himself the thought. No, he didn’t have time to think about some random guy.
So Dean went to work, putting in another eighteen hour shift. He trudged home, immediately dropping by Castiel’s apartment.
Claire continued, eyebrows raised. “He thinks you’re smart! Oh, and although he won’t admit it, he thinks you’re handsome—
His eyebrows furrowed for a moment. Cas then smiled, looking far away. “I have a couple of wonderful students, and teaching them makes it all worth while, especially my niece, Claire. She is very fun to teach.”
At the beginning, he would stumble and step on Jo’s feet. He was always looking down, his attention on his next move rather than her.
By the end of the (very VERY long day), the model had even learned how to swoop and turn his partner. Jo doubted he would use those moves, but it was still reassuring to have under his belt.
The wait wasn't long. Within twenty minutes, Sam was exiting the airport. Dean grinned, getting out of the car and walking up to him. He wrapped his brother in a bear hug before grabbing his suitcase.
He found himself sitting in the Cemetery’s parking lot, nervous. The sky was a dark grey, the clouds rolling quickly in his direction. He had about eight minutes before it started raining again.
He walked into the room and grabbed one of Dean’s bags. The bartender grabbed the other, and they went down to the lobby.
He put his bowl in the sink. “Cas, I was wondering... now that I know about your job, can we talk about it?”
Dean frowned. Who were they talking about? He knew about the host of ‘Love, Lucifer’, but he never really bothered to watch it the show.
He rolled his eyes, the corner of his mouth raising slightly. “Pretty well, despite the fact that everyone wanted to talk about the ‘Coffee War’ instead of the actual class. My students think I’m winning, by the way.”
“I... so we are staying in the same hotel with everyone else. Bobby is going to be staying in his home, which is about thirty minutes away. Uhh— so tomorrow we are doing a family brunch thingy. Are you chill with that?”
The man sighed, and Dean could sense the sorrow laced in his bitter words. “My coworkers screwed me over”
He could hear footsteps from behind him. “How do I look? I want to look good for Sammy on his last day of freedom!”
Yeah, probably not the best schedule. Putting in a eighteen-hour shift was insane, but it kept Dean’s thoughts from wandering. It was Saturday morning, and he was currently getting ready for work.
He was in his restaurant, wishing that he was back home. The place was surprisingly packed for lunch time, almost all of the booths being taken. It was as if the customers were waiting for something. Dean sighed, listening to Karen talking to her friend.
Loki’s speech was not as HALF as good as Dean’s. Sure, Castiel was probably (definitely) biased, but who could blame him?
Guilt still weighed heavily on Dean’s heart. The way Castiel’s voice shook when he yelled at him... he couldn’t get it out of his head.
Dean’s fists clenched. Sam immediatley cringed, knowing that escaping his brother’s rage was futile. Was it too late to run away?
He waited until the bartender got out of the bathroom, grabbing his own attire and taking a shower. After what felt like five minutes, Castiel was in his suit. He looked at himself in the mirror, contemplating what to do. He decided to keep his hair natural, remembering that people had often complimented his hair when it was ruffled.
He often wondered what it would be like to date someone. To hold by someone who actually cared, and wanted to return his affection. Someone to spend his life with, hand in his. And the more he thought about it, the more he wanted to experience this with Dean.
Dean held a finger up, reaching into his jacket pocket and fumbling with something inside. He clumsily pulls out a velvet box, almost dropping it on the floor in his haste.
Gabriel and Sam both said “yes” at once. Dean felt his cheeks burning. He walked over to Castiel, sitting down next to him. He sat there for a moment, contemplating what to say.
After an hour, the Melatonin kicked in. Dean sighed, shambling over to his bed. He flopped onto the mattress, not bothering to get underneath the covers. He would be awake from his nightmares soon, anyways. There was no point to getting comfortable.
He focused back on Dean. The man looked... damaged. His eyes were dull, now looking more gray than green. He was biting his lip.
Meg pulled out her phone, showing the trending photos of Dean and Castiel together. The picture of them at the bar was the most popular one. Dean was holding the door open for him, a lopsided grin plastered on his face.
Castiel’s fingers drummed against the glass in his hands. “I... I don't know. Do you think I should do it, Dean?”
The boy bit his bottom lip. His eyes darted over Castiel’s body, not believing he was actually there.
Castiel sighed, his entire body shaking. He got out of his car, closing the door behind him and walking across the abandoned lot. He found the gate to the massive cemetery creaked slightly open, and he slipped in.
Sam sighed, standing up and stretching. “I guess Gabe and I should turn in. We’ll see all off you tomorrow!”
Dean continued. “And he really loved mom. Hell, I have never seen a couple with a relationship like that. Maybe Sam and Gabriel, but they’re a different story.”
“You heard me! You want to make a good impression for Dean’s family, Dont you??? You’ll HAVE to make a good impression for his father and mother too!”
His face burned, and he felt a desperate need to change the subject. “How long have we been up here?”
“That is interesting. I heard that the interviewers are insensitive with their questions... I wonder how the two will react!”
What he found on the door surprised him. It was a note, words messily sliding down the page. It was all jumbled together.
On that day, the bartender, for the first time since his mom had died, put his complete trust in someone.
Silence filled the room, and it felt like time had froze. The model could feel the panic setting in, and he felt like running out of the room. A knot formed in the pit of his stomach, and he wanted to throw up. Castiel was not ready to come out... he had never shared his sexuality with, well... anyone except Meg. And she would never betray his trust.
Castiel froze. He never thought about how his actions could affect the people in his life. Rowena had called him four times last night and Meg eight.
Dean had his cocky grin on his face. “We are totally reading this! We can also get you the ‘To Read Braille’. These books are both ‘grade one’ levels of Braille, so it won’t take you as long to learn.”
This wasn’t good... this could go viral. Then Castiel would be forcing Dean, who was unaware, into the public eye.
The sound of the shower starting woke Dean. He flailed around for a moment, stretching and sitting up.
Castiel ran in the opposite direction, weaving through the crowds of people. He turned a lot, trying to lose the teens.
This chapter contains descriptions of violence. This update also has a lot of information that is relevant to the plot. It is really important that you read the last part of it!!!
Castiel sat down at a table, finding a spot between Ellen and Jo. Dean stuck by Sammy, as Jo had predicted, for dinner.
“We should make it together! Like, I can’t really see what I’m doing, but I know Gabe and Sam well. And you can do all the arranging...”
Castiel was silent for a moment. “Do you need any company on your walk? I don’t have any meetings until later this afternoon”
Castiel had no idea how to react. Sure, people told him about his looks constantly. It was his job, just something he had to get used to.
They walked down the street. Once in a while they would be approached by a bloodthirsty fan girl/boy.
The last thing he wanted to do was to tell his best friend that he loved him. To tell him that he was he the best thing that had ever happened to him.
Sam laughed, leaning over the table to whisper his next words. “For one, you have a LOT to offer him. Just because you can’t see and that you had a hard childhood, doesn't mean that you’re broken. For another, Castiel doesn't even notice those things about you. He likes being with you because of who you are, nothing less, nothing more.”
Castiel followed him inside, sitting on a stool by the bar. Dean could feel the man’s eyes on him, and his face burned.
The bartender shook his head, voice trembling. “No... I can’t. I— No way am I getting on. It would be a death sentence!”
The bartender felt the tension leave his body, and he grabbed his own beer, which was still resting on the counter.
Dean came back out from the kitchen, placing down two coffee mugs in front of Sam and Gabriel. He offered them a quick smile before disappearing again. About ten seconds later and he comes back with another mug. Castiel smiled, knowing what drink was inside.
He grumbled, walking over to his suitcase and getting out a new pair of clothes. “What are we doing today?”
After the short walk to the dance floor, Castiel dropped his right hand on his waist, taking Dean’s hand with the other.
The bartender eventually gave up on sleep, walking to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. It was now around three in the morning. Might as well get ready for the day...
I’m sorry that this chapter was filler. I tried to add my usual fluff and angst thing, but I’m mostly prompting for the next few chapters. Trust me when I say that the next one is... fun!
The plane hit the ground, speeding forwards. Dean yelped, his grip on Castiel’s hand tightening. The model had lost all feeling in it by now.
Castiel didn’t take much notice in him at first, pulling out his phone. The boy’s brown eyes widened, and he brought a hand to his mouth.
Dean smirked, a sense of accomplishment and pride overwhelming him. He opened his backpack, taking out his blueprints and laptop.
He got out of the Impala, wringing his hands as he walked into the cafe. Cas was standing in line for the register, a bored expression on his face. Dean jumped in line next to him. He felt bad about cutting in line, but knew that he would lose confidence if he waited.
Dean could feel something in his chest blossoming. It had been there since the first day he had met Cas and they shook hands. Ever since their first walk. Ever since Dean had let the man into his apartment.
Before, Castiel decided to blame the cause of Dean’s blindness to a disease or condition of some sort. He never was able to imagine that Dean had been....
Castiel, much to Dean’s surprise, smiled. “Yes, I guess it does... I have always meant to ask you, what is so important about this seat?”
Sam seemed to get the message, a slow smile forming on his face. The next half an hour composed of Gabriel and Sam arguing over chores while Dean made Castiel breakfast.
Not to his surprise, there had been a couple photos taken of him and Dean walking around the town. Many people were theorizing what they could be doing together in a different state.
The bartender stood, forgetting his military jacket on the couch. “See ya in the morning. I’ll make you tea.”
Dean kept his hand attached to Castiel’s hip, not finding the determination to let go. The man didn’t seem to mind, walking slower to the next room.
Sam rolled his eyes, grabbing his brother’s shoulder and pushing him towards the hall. They made it half way to Dean’s room before everything goes wrong.
The lady next to Karen hummed in agreement. “He had no right to out that boy. Apparently he’s gone off the grid since the interview.”
Dean ignored the throbbing in his head. “Pretty bad. I messed up with a friend, and I’m trying to find a way to apologize.”
I think I won today. If you decide that you want to surrender the seat to me, Sunshine, I would do it now.
Dean huffed, walking into the apartment and setting a grocery bag on the kitchen table. “Did you know that Meg is scary?”
Castiel’s whole body felt like it was on fire. “No. He just needed to take someone, and I was open.”
Before he can continue, the phone rings. Castiel frowns down at a text before looking back up. “I am sorry we have to cut this short, but I have a student in need of assistance.”
The man’s cheeks went a tint of red, and he rubbed the back of his neck. “Uh—you kinda said something about bees last night, so I thought you must really like honey”
One second he would be in the kitchen, helping his limited staff with the cooking. He then would bartend, making sure to ask whether his customers were satisfied.
Loud music erupted from the building, and Dean could smell the strong aroma of alcohol and nicotine.
Jo grinned, taking Castiel’s hands and sitting him down on the bed. She spoke, making sure her words tumbled out with confidence and authority. “Would you care to dance with me, Dean?”
Castiel chuckled. “Aren’t you supposed to buy me a drink before taking me home? That’s usually how these things work...”
The screen cut out, leaving Dean speechless. Gabriel screeched, jumping up from his stool and running around the bar. Sam ignored his hyper active fiancé, focusing on his distraught brother.
Five of his six remaining brain cells were officially gone. The last one kept screaming ‘just kiss him already!!!’
He spent the next twenty minutes listening to his brother screeching out the lyrics of cheesy love songs. He even filmed his brother singing Taylor Swift’s ‘Shake It Off’ (he was totally going to blackmail him with it later).
Lucifer smiled, his lips curling into a terrifying shape... that was the smile he would give his guests if he was about to embarrass them.
“Dean was a really good brother when we were kids. You know, he was the one who really raised me. He brought me to school, taught me how to read, and would beat up my school bullies.... he made my childhood an innocent one. Or tried to, at least. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't stop what was happening when we got home every night...”
Dean nodded. “Sammy is my little brother. He called last night to tell me he taking a break from work, and asked if he could visit me. That’s why I need someone to fix my water heater—”
Dean waved his brother off, signaling the bartender for another drink. She just shakes her head, looking back down at her phone. “I’m done waitin’! I wanna marry him now.”
When it turned twelve, Dean got ready to leave. He usually had the longest shifts, starting work at one in the afternoon and ending sometime between ten and twelve. Then Sam would step in after that, closing the bar around three.
Castiel knew that he would have a panic attack if he didn't do something, so he hesitantly slipped his hand into Dean’s. The man responded by intertwining their fingers.
Next thing Sam knows, he's hot wiring an ugly mini van and dropping Cas off at the bunker. The angel gives him the ‘find your stupid brother’ look before sighing loudly and disappearing from view.
The bartender could sense the tiny smile on Castiel’s face. “I was wondering if you would want to go on a walk with me? Unfortunately, I can not guarantee that we won’t be chased by fourteen year old girls...”
Dean’s tight black T-shirt and jeans contoured his structure perfectly, leaving almost nothing to the imagination. His light brown hair and tan skin shined in the sun. The way his perfect lips were slightly parted when he smiled, revealing rows of perfect teeth. Despite the photo being bleary, Castiel could see the firm structure of Dean’s hard jawline.  He was very good looking.
The ceremony was taking place outside of a historical home of sorts, the early autumn air giving a welcoming atmosphere.
Dean scoffed, shaking his head. “No way. I’ve been waitin’ too long for this. I’m gonna marry him. Tonight.”
“I wanted to stop by and apologize again... I know you don’t want to see me, but I couldn’t stay away. Not without apologizing again...”
Imagine being trapped, hurtling towards the earth’s surface. The harsh contact between the nose of the plane and the hard surface of the ground, killing everyone on impact.
Maybe they could sit down and talk it out. Dean could make Cas the tea that he really likes, and they could even go on a walk!
Dean smiles up at Castiel, and for a second Sam forgets that he’s wasted. He wondered in the back of his mind if Dean had thought about doing this before.
Why did they sleep in so late? Castiel had middle-of-the-night insomnia, and Dean didnt seem to sleep at all!
After about a day of nonstop driving, Castiel was standing in front of the bunker door. He didn’t bother knocking or hesitating, bursting through it.
Never again. As long as he had something to say about it, Dean would NEVER go to another wedding in his life.
Meg shook her head. “Your fans are furious with Lucifer for outing you, and most people are supportive of your sexuality. But everyone thinks you’re dating Dean now, so there’s that...”
“I feel.... betrayed? Like, I trusted him. Cas didn't tell me who he really was.... he took advantage of me. He knew I didn't know who he was, and that I wouldn’t care what he looked like because I was blind..... he took advantage of my sight. I feel...”
Dean was wearing an unreadable smile. Castiel felt his cheeks burning, but he kept his attention on Emma, who was probably having a panic attack of some kind.
The bartender groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Well, we can’t argue about this all night. Why dont we play a game? Whoever loses gets the bed!”
Dean gave him a warm and genuine smile. It was the first real smile he had seen all day. The man wasn’t smiling at Castiel because he was attractive or famous, but because he was genuinely happy that he was there. It made his stomach churn.
Castiel rushed in about three seconds later, a scowl on his face. He walked up to Dean, arms crossed and eyebrows furrowed.
Castiel leaned back on the counter, smiling shyly out the window. He saw Dean at the edge of the woods, talking to a little girl. He recognized the her as Lilith. She seemed nice, although a bit intense.
Rowena’s lips curved into a smile, her eyes shining brightly at him. “Then what are you waiting for?”
“Hell yeah. His eyes are crazy blue... I’m not even sure that they are real. Maybe he wears contacts or something...”
He couldn’t stop thinking about Dean. How long has it been since they’ve seen each other? Six months? Six years?
It broke Castiel’s heart when Dean told him about Mary. The more Cas thought about the bartender, the stronger his urge to hug and console him was.
“Okay, so leading a blind person is pretty simple. Just warn me about objects coming up, and make sure to explain the layout of the rooms you bring me in”
A goofy grin slides onto Dean’s face. “Since always. I always loved him, but didn’t know it ‘till we were stuck in purgatory together.”
The bartender walked back to his room. Castiel sat down on the couch, using the little alone time he had to calm himself down. Well, it was not working. The vivid image of Dean flooded Castiel’s vision.
Dean paused, recollecting the past couple weeks in his mind. It was awful... every moment without Castiel was felt like a dull and dark dream— no, a nightmare.
Crowley ignored him. “Okay. Since Anna is the smallest, I want her in the middle of Balthazar and Castiel.”
He would hate it. Sam never knew his mother, and he hated their father more than anything in the entire world.
Dean took a deep breath, attempting to control his temper. He walked down his driveway, getting into his black Impala and turning over her engine.
Castiel huffed, but a tiny smile tugged any the corners of his lips. Dean started making Castiel tea, and him coffee.
“You know, I thought I would be nervous or scared about getting hitched. I used to like the idea of running free, but then I met Sam. He taught me things I don't think I would have ever understood without him. I’m looking forward to spending the rest of my life arguing with him!”
Whatever happened at Castiel’s workplace today, it didn’t sound good. Apparently, someone was being an ‘asshole’ to him, and he was ‘embarrassed’. Dean wondered who would make such a kind man feel so self conscious...
Charlie put a hand over Dean’s mouth, using the other to flick his forehead. “You’re the stupidest sap I have ever had to console!”
Sam stumbled backward, ripping the towel from his face. “NO! I know it’s ‘tradition’ to have a wedding cake, but who needs all those calories? You certainly dont!”
A comfortable silence falls over them for a few minutes, and Dean listens to the music on the radio. They get to a bar shortly after. Cas holds the door open for Dean, a tiny smile on his face.
The bartender walked over to the couch cushions, grabbing Castiel’s upper arm. “Can we please watch one more??? The next episode is REALLY good!”
Dean rubbed a hand down his face and got ready for work. He was ready to go by five, leaving him with three hours to kill.
The man left Dean, closing the door softly behind him. The bartender let out a long sigh. He already felt as if he was missing something.
Gabriel stopped dancing, just now realizing that Castiel was there. “Hey, hot stuff! What are you doing here in the morning?”
There was a moment last night when he was going to pull Dean into an embrace. He refrained, not wanting to make him feel awkward or uncomfortable.
The bartender felt relieved, happy, excited, and anxious all at once. He tried to push it all down, but there was no denying the warmth creeping up his chest.
The angel’s voice sounded foreign in his own ears. “You wanted me to come back to you... you said that you needed me, so I’m here.”
Charlie rose an eyebrow at Dean, who was shaking his head. “That man” he jerked a thumb in the accused’s direction “is the enemy. I can’t leave, or he’d have won!”
Sam reacted by cocking his gun, eyes welling up. “Then tell me what I said. Prove to me that you’re Castiel.”
He left his car, entering the studio. Rowena had a gigantic grin on her face, as if a miracle had occurred. She ran over to him, waving her phone in the air.
“Uh—you kinda helped me come out as gay... I was really scared to tell others about it, but then you were brave enough to do it in front of the entire country. I figured that if you’re being brave, that I should be too.”
He fixed his adorable—er—messy bed head, running his fingers through his hair with a gel of some type. He got out his own toothbrush and toothpaste, brushing his teeth vigorously.
Bobby laughed, his eyes shining. “Hey, Castiel. We haven't really gotten the chance to talk alone, huh?”
He walked back to the hotel room shortly after. Dean was still in bed, reading the horror novel. His hair was a ruffled mess, sticking up in multiple areas. He bit his lip in concentration, his index finger gliding over the Braille.
“Thank you for being here for me, Dean. I do not know what I would have done without your assistance”
It seemed that more and more often, Dean would break down. Each panicked breath and muffled whimper haunted the angel. He never felt so helpless as when he listened to the hunter breaking. Dean needed him and Cas couldn’t do anything to help. He couldn’t make this better...
“Well, the kid was seventeen. He begged me for a whole year to teach him how to mix drinks. I kept refusing, since the legal age to start learning is twenty one. Eventually, I gave in. Dean was very clumsy at first, and being blind obviously didn't help. So I rearranged the entire bar. I made him memorize where everything was for an entire month before I let him start. That kid was a natural! Better than me, that’s for sure—”
Gabriel rested a hand on his shoulder. “He’ll tell you about it eventually. If he’s mentioned Mary... he must really like you.”
The woman’s eyes softened, and she strolled in. She looked around the kitchen, where a leftover pot of lukewarm tea was sitting.
Dean then brought his neighbor to the couch, where they both sat. Castiel murmured something about bees and pine trees.
Gabriel could see what was happening. All the childish bickering, the way they would stare when they thought the other wasn’t looking—
Castiel was sitting in his seat, dazed. He had almost gotten caught by the paparazzi, but the bartender saved him! A VERY attractive bartender. He had light brown hair, and his tan face had a few freckles on it. His tight black shirt left almost nothing to the imagination.
Castiel looked up at it with disinterest before looking back at Dean, who had been laughing about something.
The teen took a deep breath and continued. “When it comes to the mysterious bartender that Castiel proclaimed his love to, the public eye still has NO idea who he is. The model has decided to let his boyfriend decide when to reveal himself.”
Dean laughed again, ignoring the overwhelming amount of guilt building up inside of him. “War is war, buddy.”
throughout the night, the model’s mind drifted back to Dean. He lived on the floor right above Castiel... and he was most likely in there right now. The model tried to ignore the pounding in his rib cage. The fact that Dean was so close made him antsy.
Castiel took Dean’s hand, the touch sending chills running up his arm. His hand was colder than Dean had expected. Castiel moved the hand to his upper arm. Dean grasped lightly onto his bicep. He could feel Castiel’s muscles working from underneath his long sleeved shirt. Dean’s face burned, and he could barely get his voice to work.
In only a week, the model discovered Dean’s crippling fear of flying, that he cares more about family than anything, his mom was dead, and he is (surprisingly) an introvert.
Dean almost felt bad for Cas. He had passed out from exhaustion, if the dark circles underneath his eyes meant anything. And hell, did he look adorable when he was sleeping like that—
Dean sighed. Of course it had to do with work! Castiel hated it, and never even told Dean what his profession was...
But... was Dean good enough? Castiel was a fucking model, and a famous one at that! He was just a blind, cocky, and annoying bartender, who had panic attacks and nightmares every night.
“I wanted you to know me for who I was.... not for what people say I am. Not for how people think I act.... and how I look”
The shorter man grumbled, his face twisting into a pout. “I’m breaking up with you. Take your stupid ring back”
The man’s laptop had lost battery about an hour and a half ago. He had settled on reading a book, which was conveniently placed in his book bag.
Dean pulled out his phone and actually THREW it at Castiel. What was scarier? That it landed right in the model’s hand.
Dean didn’t stop, grabbing the angel’s hand and pulling inside. The hunter then breaks contact, wrapping his arms around Castiel. They stayed like that, clinging each other.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay... how about this; Sammy is at a table nearby. He can bring us home. I’ll bring you up to your apartment and you’ll go to sleep”
Castiel gave him a small smile, taking a sip of his coffee. He remained standing, his free hand resting on his book bag. “I told you yesterday that I was a professor, right?”
Benny sighed quietly. “Five in the morning. Sorry I woke you so early, but Sam is already freaking out. He wants to look perfect for Gabriel, and he wanted you to help.”
Why should he pull his brother out of his mess? Sam was always saving Dean from himself. It’s about time that he took care of himself!
The bartender flashed him one last grin before leaving the apartment, closing the door quietly behind him.
“I was wondering if you needed company on your walk to the bar? I have a photo shoot later tonight, so I’m free this morning.”
Dean barely noticed that Castiel removed the arm rest between them. The model scooted closer, their thighs were touching. Castiel draped an arm around him.
Dean smiled at that. Cas had always said that he believes in taking less than five minute showers, in order to conserve the environment.
The bartender gave him one last smile before going back to his job. Castiel felt a tiny pang of disappointment. About twenty minutes later and Meg walked in, scanning the room for her friend.
Would it really be that bad? Worst case scenario, Castiel politely declines marriage from a drunk man.
The man opened it, stifling a yawn. His hair, as it usually looked in the mornings, was ruffled. There were dark circles under his bloodshot eyes, making him appear older.
Kevin’s massive grin seemed to have widened. His eyebrows wiggled when he spoke, his tone suggestive. “This was the first photo taken. It appears that the model was having difficulty saying goodbye to his neighbor.”
Dean rested him arm on Castiel’s shoulders, causing chills to run up his spine. Any other day and the model would have been confused, if not a little suspicious, of Dean’s intentions.
“I didn't really get what happened at first. I uh—.... I dreamt of when my dad told me she wasn’t coming home.”
Rowena’s grin faltered, realization dawning on her face. “One year, minimum. If you end up winning, which is a high probability if you ask me, you would be signing a contract for the next two years.”
The hours slipped away, but neither seemed to notice. They were focused on the task at hand. Castiel would ask about the story behind every photo, and Dean would happily oblige in telling him.
He practically flung open the door. There was a short brunette standing there, her dark eyes sparking.
His brother looked great, despite the obvious hangover that he was nursing. He ran a hand through his hair, eyes darting around the kitchen.
Cas’ grin faltered, and he rolled his eyes before looking back down at his computer. Dean grinned, glancing back at his things.
He rubbed a thumb over the cool surface, trying to steady his breathing. “Thank you, Dean. I am exited to listen to it.”
Gabriel chirped, interrupting the intimate moment between the two. “How’d you learn to dance like that, Cassie, and where can I get lessons???”
Dean stammered, his face burning. “Of course! It wouldn’t be romantic, but you’re the only person I know who can take me without it being weird...”
The model was terrified. What if he messed up and got someone angry? What if he embarrassed himself in front of Dean? What if Castiel somehow got Dean into trouble???
He began to dream too. Almost every morning he would wake up tangled in his bed sheets, a pair of electric blue eyes haunting him.
Castiel continued. “A few of my students have been inadequate in their performance. They don’t turn in their essays and overshare in class, and that’s if they bother to show up at all.”
“I want you to put your hands on your hips, not so you completely block the boys, but just a little in their space. Good. Now raise your head a little.”
The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Castiel tripped himself up and squished impossibly closer into Dean, who somehow managed to keep them both stable.
Dean finished boiling the water, placing a tea bag into the pot. He also put a couple other things in. He then poured the tea into a mug. Dean felt his way over to Castiel, resting his hand on Castiel’s shoulder. The contact sent another shiver down his spine, and the model held his breath. The bartender didn’t seem to notice, offering him the mug. Castiel wrapped his hands around it, and Dean sat back on the couch.
The sound of Dean sighing caught Castiel’s attention. The bartender stifled a yawn, setting his bags down in the corner and flopping onto the bed. It was obvious that he was exhausted.
Dean sat on a step of his front porch, rim of a beer bottle to his lips. The alcohol was the only thing that grounded him at this point.
Gabriel, unsurprisingly, got the strongest drink he could order on the menu. Sam had water and a salad. Dean decided to get a Long Island iced tea. The beverage was enough to get him drunk, so he was not planning on getting anything else.
The man smiled, bringing his hand to Castiel’s shoulder. “Can you lead me? I don’t really want to get my support stick all muddy..”
Dean was first bewildered by the sound of the man’s voice. It was low and deep, rumbling like thunder. His voice was annoyingly flat, as if he was reading from a boring math textbook.
Cas was worried. Ever since the incident at the bar, Dean had been constantly praying to him. It seemed that even in his sleep, the hunter was trying to get a hold of the angel. He could hear everything Dean said. Whether it was a particularly loud sigh or a scream, Cas heard it.
Castiel finally—finally—answers. His voice his low when he speaks, barely above a whisper. “Why don’t you ask me again tomorrow morning? When you are sober.”
“Hey, ya’ll! A lot of you have been asking for me to do a video on this... so I shall deliver! I made a PowerPoint with videos and photos taken the day the model, Castiel Novak, ditched his plane to Paris.”
Until now, he didn't know how dark his world was. How depressing his ground hog’s day of a life had become.
Ellen smiled, a sense of pride in her voice. “I was just telling Cas about how Dean learned to bartend.”
In all honesty, Dean was afraid to leave town. He knew the place well... he has for fifteen years. If he left, Dean would be a helpless eleven year old again. He would be lost.
Jack’s head swiveled between a tired Sam and Dean. “What just happened? Did I miss something last hunt???”
Dean grumbled. “Cas, my neighbor, is a popular model. He didn't tell me, and I found out about his job in the wrong way. I yelled at him and now he’s gone.”
Dean looked as if he was far away, remembering a nightmare. “Uh... lonely, at first. I didn’t live with my family anymore... for reasons. Sammy and I actually moved in with my Braille teacher when I was twelve. Bobby is his name.”
The taxi was already there. Rowena was in the back, a grim expression on her face. The taxi driver got out and began to put Castiel’s things in the trunk.
But the man eventually had to leave for work. He stood up and thanked Dean for the coffee. He promised that he would drop by his apartment again sometime.
He waited until everyone but Dean had left the kitchen to ask. He slipped over to his flustered brother, crossing his arms. “How long?”
Challenge accepted! Dean slurped louder than before, ignoring that the hot coffee burned his tongue.
“I see a charming, kind, and selfless person, who won’t let others push him around. You are stronger than anyone I know, because of your determination to keep going. And it breaks my heart when you think that you are helpless and broken. Dean, you are brave enough to live in a world that has treated you badly, and that proves that you are extraordinary.”
Dean walked blindly into his closet, pulling a T-shirt over his head. He put on a pair of worn jeans. He brushed his teeth, not in the mood to eat. Dean went through the motions, his mind blank.
The man had flipped his chair around and sat back down. Now they were both glaring at each other, as if partaking in a really fucked up staring contest.
So today Dean would finally declare his love for his rival... or that was what he kept telling himself, at least.
Castiel sighed. “Awful. My coworker has been pressuring me to accept an offer I don't want to take.”
For example, Gabriel had once drew on Cas’ face while he was sleeping. The younger brother reacted by leaving a snake in his bed.
Lucifer complemented him, but Castiel couldn’t hear. He moved slowly past everyone. Rowena looked like she was going to kill Lucifer. She rushed over to the host, her face twisted in a hatred like none Castiel had ever seen. Despite being a pain sometimes, Rowena was like the mother that he never had. She actually seemed to care about him...
So the man creeped back to his apartment. He went into the kitchen, pulling a jar of pills out from his cabinet. Melatonin was the only thing that could help him sleep now.
He looked back down at the photo. Dean had worn a light gray T-shirt and worn jeans, along with a green jacket. He was facing Castiel, a smug grin on his face. Castiel was doubled over, laughing. This was taken when Dean had told him about his George Washington experience.
Castiel rested his head on the table with defeat, closing his eyes. “How did you learn how to do this?”
It only goes downhill from there. Cas gets stabbed, he crumples to the floor, Dean gets pissed when seeing his angel in pain and brutally murders the remaining witches. Sam didn’t even have to do anything. He let his brother kill everything while he checked on Cas.
Dean was sitting in darkness, as usual. In this specific dream, he was in his old room. He was sixteen, living with a teacher who worked at a school for the blind. Bobby was a good man. He made a crazy amount of effort to help Dean, no matter how often the boy rejected him.
“I love you, okay?!? I loved you and you fuckin’ left me! How can I just keep living like this? Am I just supposed to—what—move on??? Hell no!”
Gabriel whistled. “He looks... very drunk. Drunker than when Dean rode that mechanical bull. That was a scary night...”
Dean threw on a tight black T-shirt and (yet another pair of) worn jeans. He beelined for the bathroom, washing his face and fixing his hair. Hopefully he could crawl out of the hole of embarrassment he just dug for himself....
Castiel avoided looking at the camera, giving Lucifer a tiny smile. “A little nervous, but I’m exited to be here with you”
Meg smiled mischievously. “We met in our junior year of high school. He moved to my town after ‘making it big’.”
The moose could barely believe that he was married to this man. To this annoying, cocky, happy-go-lucky loser.
Dean was still in a daze. His only remaining brain cell was screaming for him to get down and one knee and ask the model to marry him. Just skip all the dating and shit. He wanted Cas.
They eventually made it to the car, and Sam drove. A semi-drunk Gabriel was singing ‘Let it go’ in the front seat, and Castiel sat in the back with Dean in a drowning silence. Something really bad must have happened to the poor man.
Castiel huffed and rolled his eyes, a tiny smile forming on his face. Dean was adorable when he was nervous.
Now, he asked her to dance with charm and intellect. Castiel had found a way to still be himself and also act calm and collected. He led her with confidence, his blue eyes glued to hers the entire time.
The model rushed up to the bartender’s apartment, his heart throbbing. He was set on spending the rest of his time with Dean; Every second he could spare.
Castiel broke eye contact. “I know that we are in the middle of a war, but... can I talk with you for a few minutes? I had a bad morning and I was hoping that I could rant to you about it.”
It took about ten seconds to get his voice to work. “Huh... he likes photos that help him remember the good times. Look for anything that looks like Sam or Gabe having fun.”
He coughed uncomfortably, taking a step back. His hand was still holding Castiel’s. “Can you stay for a bit? Just until I fall asleep?”
The bartender’s lips were pursed in a thin line. Of course he did not want Cas to leave! He wanted him to stay here, with him...
Little did Dean or Castiel know, Sam and Gabriel were watching from behind the kitchen door, grinning like idiots.
He crept to Castiel’s side as quietly as he could, picking up the note pad and pen. He wrote, taking extra care to perfect his handwriting.
That didn’t sound like something Dean would say. The brother he knew would probably throw a fit over having to go home and face Cas. Honestly, Sam would be willing to bet that Dean would rather go back to hell.
He cleared his throat, suddenly very aware that everyone he ever knew was watching him. “Yeah. Jack’s right, Cas.”
After about a minute, he knocks again. Dean was home, he had to be. Then he hears footfalls from the other side of the door. It swings open.
If Castiel noticed him flinch, he didn't say anything, wrapping his hand around the cup. Dean let go, walking back to the other counter to grab his own mug. His cheeks burned, and his heart was racing.
It was just another boring Thursday afternoon for Dean. He was in the back of his restaurant, listening to Sam and his fiancé, Gabriel, argue over the house special.
Castiel’s face went a dark shade of red. He head nodded over in Jo’s direction. “My teacher’s over there.”
“No... he told me that he doesn't like his job all that much.... and that his coworkers screw him over a lot...”
Dean laughed. “You really haven't heard of it? It’s about two brothers who hunt monsters and the paranormal.”
Sam kept eyeing the model like he was about to disappear. “Uh... Castiel. Do you mind if you helping me unload the delivery truck? I could really use the help.”
Not having to do with the story, what is the weather like right now for ya’ll? I know it’s a weird question! My place is always really sunny, and we’re getting clouds for the first time in what feels like an eternity! Hopefully it rains. :)
He was struggling through the fifth page of the ‘To Read Braille’. He almost threw it out the window.
Dean actually seemed happy about Castiel showing up so late. Apparently, the bartender also had difficulty sleeping, and enjoyed the company the model had to offer. He would make him a pot of the infamous honey mint tea, and they would listen to music while scrapbooking.
Dean filled the pot with water and placed it on the stove. “You have a lot of tea bags in your cabinet...”
Cas continued, a smirk on his face. “I suppose I would be willing to sacrifice an evening to win the Coffee War.”
Gabriel stared down at the water, eyes unfocused. “No. It’s just that... Dean never talks about Mary with anyone. Not even Sam...”
Dean fell out of bed, scrambling over to his duffle-bag. He pulled out a button down shirt and jeans. “I don’t understand! I haven't slept in till nine since I was like—seven!”
Dean immediately sat down across from him. Sam slid in next to his brother, propping his head up lazily with his hands. Gabriel stood next to the booth, leaning against the table behind him.
Dean was led to the right corner. Castiel took Dean’s hand with his own, placing it onto a wooden surface. The man’s cold hand covered his own, making chills run down his spine
Castiel got into a pair of worn jeans and a plain gray T-shirt. The photographer told him to dress how he usually does. Meg had gotten into a long sleeved shirt and a jean jacket.
Sam almost threw the kitchen knife at Dean. He made a stabbing motion, burning it into the wooden cutting board on the counter.
I want to thank Keeper_of_BEEES for beta reading my work. And a GIGANTIC thank you to everyone who has read, left kudos, and commented. My favorite part of writing this was to share it with all of you! <3
“Dean was in a coma for a month. When he woke up, he couldn't see. The doctor said that he had damaged his optical lobe, and that there was little chance of ever getting his sight back. John came back to town sometime around then. There was a trial, ending with John losing custody of Sam and Dean.”
Dean froze up in his seat, his jaw clenched. Castiel waited until everyone had gone on the plane to talk to him.
He sped to the coffee shop. He, apparently, arrived right on time. Castiel was getting out of his car, which happened to be a Mark V. Good to know that the man liked antique cars, even if it was an ugly one. Dean responded by jumping out from his own car.
He saw it. A photo taken of Castiel walking through the streets, talking to a very attractive Dean Winchester. Dean was wearing his crooked grin, and the photo caught Castiel mid laugh. He zoomed in on the photo, studying it. It must have been taken when they went on the walk this morning!
Castiel grinned. “She also said something about the couple throwing flowers at people. Why do they do that? It sounds violent!”
It had been a week since the model had gone outside. He was being forced to keep on the down low by Rowena, thanks to his rising popularity. Lucifer had sent out an official apology to him on social media, but Castiel didnt bother responding.
Castiel reached down, hand entwining with the hunter’s. “Jack said that you needed me. It took a long while, but he was able to convince The Empty to let me go.”
He leaned against the hotel door, shutting it. He wanted to fall asleep right there, curled in the doorway.
“I feel kind of embarrassed. I don’t know why I even went into modeling in the first place anymore...”
Why, Sam had no idea. Maybe it was because Dean was waiting for his brother to find someone first. Or possibly, he was scared.
Not that he liked Cas or anything like that. Not that Dean liked the way the man’s deep voice sent chills running through his body, or how his hand would sometimes brush against his, or how—
The man was silent for a few moments, as if contemplating what to say. “It is work. I do it and then I go home.”
“I—um— I’ve been doing a mix of things. I sent a quick test to my brother, worked on blueprints for a home I’m working on, and was just about to call someone to fix my water heater.”
All of Dean’s files had been ordered, stacked into three neat pileS. Castiel organized it all into different sections.
And he felt like throwing up by the time he woke. It was around six in the morning, and there was a frantic knock on the door.
Castiel sighed, a wave of relief washing over him. He walked into the hotel room, wringing his hands.
“I have been trying to think of a gift to get Sam and Gabriel, but I have no idea what. I know they are polar opposites, and that when one likes something the other doesn't. Like—I could maybe get them something for the restaurant, but what???”
“It’s just that.... there is so much more to you than what you look like, Cas. I should know! And the fact that people just see you as....”
The model wanted to crawl into a hole and die. This was definitely the worst decision he had made in his life.
He thought about it. Getting ordered around by a photographer, being dressed up by others, wearing a thick layer of stage makeup, being judged solely on what he looked like... and he wouldn’t be as good looking forever. Everyone gets old...
“Well, some fans saw you two walking and hanging around each other. And in all of them, you both look... extremely happy. Like, I even thought you two I were getting it on or something!”
Dean bit his lip, concealing his shaking hands in the jacket pocket. “That would be really nice of you, Cas.”
Dean stammered, his face burning. A very drunk Castiel had just flirted with him. Okay, this is fine. Dean definitely didnt care...
Gabriel, who previously had been making coffee, rushed over and climbed in the booth with Sam. He hugged him tightly. He spoke softly into his husband’s ear. “It’s not your fault, baby. You were just too young to understand.”
Dean felt as if his entire body was on fire. “Yeah, that would be great! Uh— can I drop by your place at five?”
Dean hummed. He wondered what Castiel was talking about. Why does he think that there are so many fake relationships?
Dean nodded. The man’s voice was deep and low, reminding Dean of a thunder storm. The way Castiel spoke sent chills up his spine. He coughed uncomfortably, fidgeting with his hands.
Only when Dean closed the door to his home did he notice how heavily it was raining. Still, somehow, the water was warmer than what he took a shower in.
John rested a trembling hand on his son’s shoulder. “Your mother was very sick... and if you get too sick, you have to go to the hospital, Remember?”
He called the airlines, making a last ditch effort to go home early. Rowena, begrudgingly, approved of him going back sooner.
The model tore his eyes away from his neighbor, taking his own shirt off and pulling on the dress shirt. His face burned, trying to ignore the pounding in his ribcage.
Dean replayed the day in his head. Castiel had (somehow) managed to convince Dean that he wasn’t going to die when flying. No one had been able to do that before! Not even Sam...
So they waited for around ten minutes, and Castiel trudged into the living room. His eyes were red, accompanied by dark circles. He hadn’t shaved, so his five a clock shadow grew. He wore an oversized shirt and sweatpants. Wrapped around his waist was a red flannel.
Sure, Sam and Gabe are going to fight... A lot. But they love each other more than anything in the entire world.
Sam is in the kitchen the next morning, making a pot of coffee. If last night wasn't shitty enough, he couldn’t get himself to fall asleep. He was too busy worrying about this morning. Would Dean remember what had happened? Would he have the balls to propose to Castiel again? What would Cas’ reaction be this time?
Before anyone could barge in, Dean continued. “Look—I know it’s crazy sudden and that we haven’t talked about.... well, anything regarding my feelings towards you—but I want... I want to marry you one day, Cas. I’m done with p—
Sam groaned, sparing a glance at his phone. After some tracking, he discovered that Dean had, unsurprisingly, fled to a bar a state over.
It was nice to see him back to normal, grinning mischievously and tapping along to the radio. The windows were down, the cool wind ruffling the passenger’s dirty blonde hair.
Castiel frowned at the cabin. It was secluded, surrounded in a dense forest of tall trees. It all seemed still, sad. The Impala was parked by the cabin’s entrance, coated in a layer of dirt and dust.
Before he could respond, Castiel heard cussing from the kitchen, along with a crashing noise. Sam rushed into the room, a furious expression on his face.
Castiel stared wide eyed at the photos for a moment. “Uh—he’s just an acquaintance of mine. No more...”
The bartender was now in the back, making Castiel his food. A tall man, who the bartender called ‘Sammy’, was looking over at him. He had long brown hair, hazel eyes, and a kind expression.
“Yeah! Grilled cheese sandwiches sounds easy to make, but it’s actually difficult. I always mess it up.”
Castiel went into the kitchen and took his banana muffins out of a tin, placing the treats onto a plate. He walked over and handed Dean a muffin.
Before he could relax, Castiel began to lead him. The steps were simple, but Dean could tell that the model knew what he was doing.
Sam stood up from the booth, putting his mug in the sink. Dean finished his coffee, and helped unload the dishwasher with Sam. Out of nowhere, Gabriel burst through the back door. He doubled over, panting.
Dean Glared back in his rival’s direction. Cas was reading something on his laptop, biting his bottom lip in concentration.
Dean grimaced. Should he tell his brother that the water heater is broken, or should he just let him figure it out himself?
He phased in and out of sleep, a sense of calm overwhelming his senses. He only felt warmth, pressing up against his stomach and chest.
The two arguing men went to the kitchen, yelling at each other the whole way. The bartender groaned, feeling his way around the counter. He sat down next to the model.
Dean gave his hand one last squeeze. Castiel then climbed into the taxi, arms wrapped around himself.
Or maybe Cas would never marry and just have his one night stands and be a bachelor for the rest of his life.
“No, he’s teaching. Poor Cassie didn't even have time to stop for coffee! He’s probably going to be really grumpy without caffeine in him.”
He stood up and left the hot tub. He found the railing to the pool and dove in. He was underwater for a moment or two, holding his breath
The couple had only been back for three hours, but were already at each other’s throats. Despite this, their hands were laced together, resting on the table for the model to see. He did not realize how much he had missed them until now.
Sam’s heart freezes when he sees a familiar angel. Castiel had merely crossed between rooms through the hall, disappearing within a second.
Dean walked back over with Castiel’s mug. He reached over, offering it to him. Dean felt the man’s hand brush against his, and Dean almost dropped the mug.
The model spoke, his voice soft in his ear. “Are you feeling better? You stopped hyperventilating, but your heart is still beating rapidly.”
Castiel rummaged through the suitcase, finding his swimming trunks. He went into the bathroom and grabbed a towel.
He hadn’t forgotten about his rival, ‘Castiel’. He remembered that annoyingly rude man, who had really pretty eyes and wicked sex hair—
Garth looked back down at his phone to play another round of candy crush. “Can’t say. I just know that on this date every year, Dean leaves for a bit.”
“I know I shouldn’t be asking something of you, especially since you’re gone. But I don’t know what to do anymore... there’s something very wrong with Dean.”
The model had rambled endlessly about her best friend. She talked about what he was like in high school, when he was just a shy bookworm. She complained how the teen would always be doing his homework, and getting the best grades offered.
The kiss was slow and passionate, unlike nothing Dean had ever experienced. Sure, he has had his fair share of kisses, but this?
Castiel began to fix the poorly tied bow. “I think you are even more nervous than Sam. He’s the one getting married, Dean, not you.”
He staggered into the hotel room. It was bigger than Castiel had previously expected, there was a small balcony and a makeshift living room. Sam and Gabriel must have booked suites for everyone!
So here he was, babysitting his brother as he got wasted with Charlie, who had dared him to a competitive game of beer pong. Oh right, and they were drinking Vodka, not beer...
Gabriel grimaced, his eyes darting between Dean and the chair. “Okay, but don’t blame me when Cassie decides to murder you...”
Any other day and Dean wouldn’t have cared. Perhaps he would have been happy to give up his spot for someone else!
Dean chuckled at Castiel cluelessness. “Well, there is usually food, accompanying the wedding cake, dancing of course, an—
He heard Gabriel’s tired gasp on the other end. “Don’t judge us, loser. Unlike you, we actually like having fun!”
Castiel shook his head, prompting Dean to continue. “Well, I had a particularly bad morning when I met you. I threw an alarm clock through my wall—” he ignored the confused look on Cas’ face—“the water heater broke again, and I locked myself outside of my home. I was just hoping to have a good rest of the day and drink coffee in my favorite spot. Then you showed up... I’m sorry I was so rude.”
Castiel flinched, sending his bowl of popcorn in the air. He, somehow, managed to catch it before making a complete mess.
This was his fault. If he had just been there for his father, none of this would have happened. He could have saved John!
He, begrudgingly, stood. Dean kept his back to the wall, glaring down at his rival as he trudged across the room. He only broke eye contact with Castiel when he closed the door to the bathroom.
He frowned, plopping down on the couch. “I can’t. What if the show really is his dream? I couldn’t possibly take his chance away from him. Hell, this isn’t even MY decision to make! Cas accepted, and now he’s... leaving.”
Dean frowned, turning to face the woman behind him. A thin layer of eyeliner accompanied a pair of electric blue eyes. Long blonde hair was tied into a tight ponytail.
Was... was Dean pulling him in closer? Their sides were now touching, Castiel’s nestled comfortably under him.
Dean struggles in his drunk haze to stand, reluctantly nodding. Although the excited smile on his face had slipped away, a hopeful look glinted in his eyes. “Okay... I can wait one more night. But then you’ll gimme an answer?”
Jack shook his head, head tilting slightly. Dean’s heart ached when he saw the puzzled expression on his face.
Dean sighed, pulling out a box of tea packets from the plastic bag and throwing it blindly in Meg’s direction. She yelped in reaction, barely dodging the box.
There was a grumble on the other end of the door, and it opened. Dean had a sour expression on his face, lower lip sticking out.
Castiel continued listening, staring up at Dean in admiration. The freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks had gotten darker over the long summer. Castiel wished that he had the time to count them all.
He had been thinking a lot about what Sam had said the other day. Was it possible that he had a crush on Cas?
After about two more minutes of quiet conversation and ruffling through stuff, Dean shut the door behind him.
There was a man in Dean’s seat. He was looking out of the window at the rain, one hand resting on his laptop and the other wrapped around a coffee cup. Dean was not able to see his face, but the man had messy raven hair and wore a trench coat over a suit.
Then Jo giggled, attracting the couple’s attention. Castiel gave her a nervous smile before walking over to Dean.
Dean sunk back in his chair, pulling his signature pouty face. “I can’t believe I’m doing this! I should be back in the bar right now...”
Dean huffed. He faced Castiel, his eyes a remarkable shade of green. He wrung his hands, and he went back to biting his lip.
She nodded. “And you’re the infamous Dean we have been hearing about! Castiel has told me and the rest of the class about your Coffee War. The hot sauce was a nice touch.”
Castiel was barely able to keep it together in the airport. He spotted a couple people taking pictures of him. He knew that his sorrowful face would be trending, but he didn't care.
Dean had to make the choice between going in Cas’ car, suffering via Sam and Gabriel’s yelling at each other, or being sandwiched between Jo (who was STILL talking about ‘Ghostfacers’) and Benny (who kept saying ‘brother’ every six seconds).
Gabriel was standing there, hands on his hips. “He was running away from fan girls! Dean let Cassie, here, hide under the bar’s counter until they left.”
Dean yawned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He was in the Impala, waiting for his brother’s plane to land. Sam decided to visit for a couple weeks, needing a break from work.
"So, from your call you sounded pretty worried, I'm going to start by asking your brother to step outside of the room for a moment while I examine the impacted area." Sam looked like he was going to protest, but the look on Dean's face stopped any words coming out of his mouth.
When the doctor gently pushed the transducer against his lower abdomen, he slid it across Dean's stomach. He was searching for something, that much was obvious, but what for, Dean had no idea.
"Do you think that..." He starts, but something is holding him back. Either fear or the trepidation to dream so big. Either way, Sammy is reading him like a book and catches onto what Dean is saying.
Dean shook his head, he and Sam hardly took anything stronger than an aspirin, and if any injuries needed something stronger, they had whiskey.
Dean nearly fell down the small set of steps between the bathroom and his room. He was dying. He probably only had a few months, no, days to live. If he wasn't worried a moment ago, he was seconds from a meltdown now.
Dean has packed his own bag already and he's got everything stacked at the foot of his bed, but Sam and Cas won't let him carry anything out to the Impala.
He stops. Rubbing a hand down his face like it'll fix all of his stress wrinkles. It doesn't, obviously, but to claire he's old and they'll only get worse.
Just when Sam realized he had been staring for FAR too long, Dean's phone was ringing out from underneath the cushion. And this time, his brother was waking up.
baby books Sam had picked up from the secondhand store. In the book he was currently reading, there was quite the bit of information about physical sensations. He was sucked into the book so deep he made a decent dent in the bag of carrots.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way. He was supposed to stop God and Amara by whatever means necessary and everything else was supposed to go back to normal.
Dean couldn't sit still for the life of him. He was shifting in his seat, his leg bouncing up and down at varying speeds. He contemplated taking his phone out but he didn't want to be mid-text with his mom until he absolutely knew what was wrong.
Dean didn't protest, frozen in that place he went to now and again since this discovery. So Castiel took that as a sign to move his hand further around his waist.
Sam told him, days after crisis had been averted, that Cas left on some important mission with the other angels. Admittedly, Dean hadn't questioned it at the time, probably because he was busy with his previously dead, but now very much alive, mother.
At the mention of his name, Dean nuzzled his head further in the heat of Castiel's chest. The sight nearly set him aflame, but Castiel returned Sam's stare.
"Hey, deep breath. We're okay. The baby is fine and Cas is our friend. It isn't like he wasn't going to find out eventually. Even if it was an accident, this is good."
has Dean rolling his eyes. Like everyone could just bring back a formerly dead person without struggle.
Missed calls from Sam (expected), messages from his mom (awkward), and a voicemail from Jody (...crap).
There is a heavy, clouded feeling in the back of his head and it keeps him slow and quiet. Before he can even think, or try to think, about protesting, the paramedics are lifting him onto a gurney and he's being pushed to a nearby ambulance.
Women's jeans were so tight on his calves, of all places he thought would be a tight squeeze, he didn't even think about his fucking CALVES.
He hadn't had the time to find his shoes, he's got the Impala's keys cutting into his hand, but Dean doesn't stop until he's at the door.
a light at the end of this tunnel. Jody has a cart, there is something like an exercise ball in it along with an obscene amount of creams in there. He doesn't even know what half of them are for, hell, he doesn't think he WANTS to know.
Surrounded by baby bottles and tiny toenail clippers, he's practically itching to talk to someone that has a uterus. (Which is a thing he's pretty sure Amara gave him. Not like he could cook up a kid without one.) His phone is burning a hole in his pocket and dammit, there were those weird crossed lines again.
If she hadn't made him cry earlier, she'd be annoyed. And if he wasn't pregnant, she probably would have punched him for crying.
He steered his cart closer, unknowingly squatting down before the thing like it was the holy grail. They looked so...cozy.
"Is it all right if I keep my hand just below the nape of his neck?" Castiel asks, and the paramedic nods, working to press against the sluggishly bleeding wound. It's slowing down and that's good. It'd stop by the time they reached the hospital, then they'd be able to assess the wound and see if it needed stitches or if he needed any scans done.
"I came here because you left an interesting message unanswered during our call and I was concerned. Which, seeing your physical state right now, I can see I was right to worry."
Sam is as close to his brother as he can be without touching him, but when those tears start falling, he cannot stop himself from clinging to his brother's back. Castiel closes in shortly after, embracing Dean from the front until he's covered on all sides.
Before Dean had even finished speaking the doctor was nodding. Standing, he made toward the door leaving Sam and Dean alone together.
Once he's finished, Dean has two stitches in his head and they are taking him to radiology for a scan to check the swelling at the back of his head. They don't seem incredibly worried, but with Dean's state, they aren't taking the risk of sending a pregnant person home with a head injury like this.
"I'm tired Claire. And not just because of little Fruitcake here. I've been doing this since I was like 5 friggen years old. Why the hell should I keep doing it when I don't want to? When I don't
Jody's bullshit, he could get one of those big ass cookies from the cookie place. And a pretzel. With hot sauce.
Though, after visiting Doctor Mercury, they had settled into a menial routine. It consisted of, mainly Sam, tiptoeing around the bunker. Dean was still trying to adjust to his decision, whether or not it would be permanent, and Sammy was trying to respect that. Dean needed time, and he shouldn't jump at an answer before he was COMPLETELY sure.
Cas moves before she can ask him anymore questions, clipboard in hand, he moves aside the curtain that's around Dean and the emergency room doctor. The doctor is moving around Dean in a fashion that reveals how practiced she is and Castiel makes sure to stay out of her way as she circles around Dean once more.
When she falls into him, she doesn't really think. But her brain tells her arms to move and hug him back.
He waved off Sam's concerns, if something really was wrong with him, there was a doctor a foot away from him.
Dean stopped talking, his hand (the traitorous bastard) somehow made it to his stomach, but he doesn't really care that they all see it.
Jody didn't even wait, simply passing the bags over to a slightly overwhelmed Sam. Gently grabbing Dean by his elbow, she started to lead him out of the store and into the main walkway for the mall.
Dean tried reading all of the supportive posters in the room and even the informational guides on the walls, but it was somehow making him more anxious. He shifted around again, trying to find comfort among the clinically sanitized and odorless room.
It isn't until that incessant ringing of his phone goes off for the hundredth time that he truly comes back to life. With a grumble and a roll, he's sliding on the Impala's bench seat, nearly tumbling into the footwell before he catches himself.
Unfolding the pillow was like unfolding a playboy. Good god did this thing look good. Oh yeah, he was going to pass the fuck right out on top of this.
Now, cuddled up behind the pregnant man, she can feel the barest of hints of the pillow, and damn that shit is cozy.
He took one look at Castiel's face, and he saw something behind the angel's gaze that he didn't know what to make of.
The thought makes him smile, and Sam is thankfully too busy rinsing out toothpaste to notice. Dean makes quick work of rinsing out his mouth, his knees practically going weak at the thought of being clean. He almost makes it out scott-free, but Sam's already finished getting ready for the day, and he's still there.
It isn't until Sam ventures out of the library, pulled by the oven's timer, that he realizes how crazy he must look.
Looking down at his brother, he couldn't deny just how right the angel was. They had been through hell and Dean deserved peace. They all did. Maybe a baby was just what they needed.
He hadn't really started the works until Claire told him he probably shouldn't eat that pickle, despite it being protected by the pocket.
Dean's eyes nearly popped out of his head. He was sputtering out an insult, or maybe a question, his tongue couldn't figure it out. But he was mad either way.
It's been a week and the boys only just came home last night. She briefly spoke to Sam last night. When they came in through the garage, Mary had been worried, seeing Dean in Castiel's arms like that.
Hands hovering over his brother's body, Sam knows all too well how waking up from a nightmare can leave you in a state of near hysteria. He doesn't touch his brother, not until Dean can stop rocking back and forth.
My b, sorry for playing with you're emotions. It's done this time, I promise. (The chapter, not the story.)
Sure, he could wash his hands or reach across the counter for the dish towel, but that meant moving and breaking this bubble. His happy baby bubble.
What he found however, was something Dean never would have dreamed of finding for the baby. Holding in his gigantor hands was a replica of the Impala, a few years behind his Baby's, but it was the same black and that's all Dean cared about.
The last time he had done that, he had a special tool to do so. One that he believed Sam was still in possession of.
He was already pulling it off the rack, holding it close to his chest. Oh yeah. There was no way he wasn't coming home with this.
"It doesn't matter why we did what we did, or even if we were right in doing it. The main point is that Dean didn't get to choose, and that's not right. We're no better than dad, just constantly ordering him around. Not listening to a single thing he says because we think we know better."
He divides his attention between the road and the mirror, finding his brother's guilty face all too funny. This is one of those moments in their lives that he wants to burn inside of his memory. It was so normal that it was nearly painful.
He's pretty sure he and Sammy will end up playing with these more than the baby. It's not like he doesn't remember having toys as a kid, he tried his best so Sam could have the similar experiences that he had but he knows he fell short a lot of the time. He wasn't going to go through that again. He wanted his kid to have everything.
Sliding a hand down his face, Dean tries to mentally erase the past five minutes in his mind as he opens the door. As slowly and nonchalantly as possible, he saunters over to the sinks. Sam is looking at him through the mirror, his eyes already conveying the questions he's dying to pester Dean with.
There's a distinct silence as they continue riding, not even the paramedic is speaking, he's just working silently around them when Dean cracks his first smile.
"Oh, also could you take these bags out to the car, I don't want to carry them around with us while we're at the other shops."
"Stress, yeah, that could be a, uh, a factor. But I haven't been doing much of what I was a couple weeks back. I guess my body is catching up with me or something. I'm like, constantly tired and my back hurts. I also- well, I wasn't going to say this, but I don't normally burst into tears. I was seconds away from losing it in the waiting room over something that shouldn't have made me...upset?"
But Sammy said not to complain, and there was something about his brother's words that Dean's brain translated into an order. Dad never wanted to hear Dean complain. Even if he had been gone one too many days and Dean had barely eaten anything that wasn't stolen. John didn't want to hear it.
Dean had been thinking about this recently, especially since he decided to keep the kid. He practically forced himself to say it.
After trying, and failing to fit into the first couple of pairs by himself, he was left with little option but to ask Jody for help.
And there were the waterworks right on time. Castiel looked instantly concerned, both hands coming up to pull Dean into an embrace. Dean couldn't help but lean into it, laughing as he went. The old Dean Winchester would be appalled right now. Who was he even right now?
He makes a noise like a wounded animal when she uncurls his fingers, revealing the keys to the Impala in his hand.
He brings up both hands to the sides of his head, grabbing two fistfuls of hair and tugs in despair. Again, he shakes his head.
When they've scanned everything and have it all bagged up, Jody leads them out of the store, finally speaking up.
Before he could even try to come up with a possible answer, a man in a white lab coat called out his name.
"Shut up," he trembles through a shaky exhale. "Just...just let me-let me fix it. I can do this. I've done it before."
. Cas is claiming the baby. Which means he isn't going anywhere. Tears spring to his eyes and the paramedic looks to the monitors to see if his levels have changed, but he doesn't appear to be in any pain.
When the doctor finally turned around to face them, he was looking over the notes Dean had written onto the check-in sheet.
Cas follows behind quickly, making sure never to lose sight of Dean even when he's handed a clipboard and asked a number of questions by one of the emergency room nurses.
Ten minutes later and Castiel's plane is still working on de-boarding. Sam's pissed off at himself for not grabbing an extra pickle. There were two by the cash register when he had stopped to get gas before they drove to the airport. He thought one would be enough, a failsafe, but Dean's finished with it, and the juice (which, that was disgusting to watch and Claire had to take a walk after that).
left an ambiguous meaning about the situation, so Sam was probably waiting until they got behind closed doors.
She had been waiting to go into the kitchen, it had been an afterthought, as she passed Dean by. Their shoulders bumped but the kitchen was crowded more than usual with Sam and Dean there.
Its loose, which is nice, it leaves room for his ever-expanding belly to grow. It is long on his arms too, so long in fact that it pours over his wrists and covers his hands.
He also had failed to mention anything to Cas. As soon as they had the chance, they had left L.A. without looking back.
Hunting was bigger than Dean's needs. They were saving people and Dean had grown accustomed to ignoring his needs. Maybe that's why it's so hard to have everyone waiting on him hand and foot. It doesn't feel right.
They were on hiatus from hunting, they hadn't said much about it, but Dean figured with his current state, everyone was just going to be there and...support him? He isn't really sure what he expected, let alone what he wanted, but was it too much to ask for?
"Sam, it isn't your fault. Dean has been undergoing a lot of changes. We didn't account his traumatic experiences when we spoke about these emotional outbursts. You both have experienced periods of mental tribulation and it seems that Dean is undergoing another one. We'll make it through this just like the rest."
"He said it was important, but what could be so important in Thailand? Why the hell had he even gone there? Is he still following Lucifer's trail because I thought Crowley and Rowena were handling that. Their fucking mess anyway. Had the chance to bag him in D.C. that's what you said, but they didn't take it. Why the hell not?"
Sitting upright, Dean doesn't hesitate to use all of the pent up air trapped in his lungs to let out one of the loudest and most uncensored screams he's ever made. He doesn't even know if he's really awake.
When the engine cuts off, Dean doesn't even twitch. It just goes to show how really gone he is, swept under the heavy waves of emotional exhaustion.
Sam was honestly impressing Dean with how well he's managed to keep his mouth shut. He was quiet leaving the clinic, getting into the impala, and even on the drive back to the bunker. Though, Dean
"I didn't mean it like-oh, you know what, I don't even care. You're impossible to talk to these days."
They had been following the trail of a man, supposedly a famous rockstar, but the trail was running cold. He was wary about contacting Sam and Dean, this was his problem, he had lucifer, right in his hands. And then after the fight with Amara...he lost him.
Dean whipped around in his seat so fast he worried he gave himself whiplash. There, standing in all his holy tax accountant glory, was Castiel.
He's too busy glaring out the window to notice Sam's eyes boring into the side of his head. Dean doesn't even want to look at his watch. He probably didn't even make it two hours.
Sam has the light on by now, halfway over the front seat when he sees the look of pure and unadulterated
"You forget something?" He asked, setting his carrots aside to rub his sticky fingers all over Sammy's wallet. Sam didn't answer as he began his descent down the stairs. He was halfway down when he spoke.
Dean nodded once again, if not begrudgingly, and allowed the doctor to lead him back to the waiting room. Dean jerked his head toward the door as soon as Sam looked up. The two were in the impala, Sam was staring at him expectantly, but Dean waved off his concern. When he got answers, Sam could get answers, until then the little shit could wait.
human beings. Brothers, well, normal brothers anyway, probably only saw each other for the holidays or the family reunions. Dean didn't want that and that was how Sam helped him.
Dean frowned into his pillow. He wanted to tune his brother out but if he did, it was likely that Jody would come and find him herself and he wasn't willing to tango with that.
"I'm sure it's not as severe as you might be thinking, but I will not exclude any possibility out of the picture here."
Except for Sam. Man he was brave for putting up a fight against pregnant Dean. The glare Sam had received after that had been so deadly that Claire was even scared.
"Dean didn't want a baby shower, but the girls talked him into it. He didn't want the nightgowns, but Jody convinced him. He didn't want to do yoga in the morning, but I told him it was good for him. He wasn't sleeping well until you came home, but then you left to go find Chuck. He didn't want that, but you did it anyway." Sam sighs.
Cas is already getting out of the Impala when Sam unbuckles his seatbelt to fully face his brother. The passenger door opens and Castiel is kneeling on the ground beside them.
"Dean, c'mon man, you gotta talk to us or we won't know how to help." Sam tries, but that only seems to make Dean more upset.
Sam looks at him with wide eyes, its then that he realizes he's still in the night shirt. But with the pretzel and the softness from the shirt, Dean could surprisingly care less.
Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he slumps to the ground. The bunker's bathroom is hardly discreet, the toilets were private but damn if everyone wasn't washing their hands at the same time. He wants to wash out the remnants of his brunch date with the toilet, but he knows Sam is just on the other side, probably combing his stupid hair or putting on mascara.
Dean managed not to snort out a laugh. He had a feeling that telling the doctor that God's sister knocked him up wasn't a better answer.
"And I'm not about to blow chunks. Only reason I'm letting you take me anywhere is because I got the kid in my gut, and if you don't tell my brother to get his ass in this car, I'm gonna start pressing buttons." He says, motioning to the nearby monitors.
"We can't eat blueberries, end of story. I don't care about strawberries, boysenberries, blackberries or raspberries. But I ain't eating the thing that the doctor compared my kid too."
Sam has one arm stretched across the back of the bench seat and is looking down at his brother in anger. But it's more at himself than anything. How could he let it get to this point? He's seen Dean struggling these past few weeks. He's seen Dean fight demons with more restraint than he's fought their orders.
"I rebuilt you, I know precisely what reproductive parts you did and did not have when you were reborn."
"Surprise transition present." He replied. It wasn't like he could tell the guy the truth. They had a cover, and this was it. But Dean was slowly getting used to it, oddly enough.
The doctor was breathing heavily like he had just ran from the lab to here. He was holding a clipboard in his hand, and Dean and Sam were waiting expectantly. The doctor pulled out his seat, rolling to the middle of the examination room.
He finds himself seated at the bench in the dressing room, wondering to himself when he started thinking of the baby as an angel. Surely it hadn't started when the doctor started comparing it to food.
Pushing the cart away from the food in anger, he's barely looking where he's going. He does know that he's probably going to have an aversion to fruit after this whole ordeal is over.
With a sigh, he forces himself to untangle the mess they've twisted themselves into during their sleep, and leaves the two for the bathroom.
Sam's eyes were wide, but he seemed to be retaining everything that Jody was saying. Dean however, was lost thirty seconds into Jody's spiel. Thank god those weren't his tasks to complete. He'd have already failed.
There's a light shining in his eyes and a foggy voice speaking to him when he slowly regains consciousness.
Bringing up Cas was a sore spot for him, the angel hadn't replied to any of his texts in the past week or answered any of the calls he knows Sam has made.
Sam was right, everything was fine and they were okay. Cas probably thought he was talking about his car.
Heavier foot steps come into the living room and Dean knows that its his brother without even having to open his eyes. Sam walks over to where he's laying and nudges him with a sock-covered foot.
Dean doesn't reply because he's too busy watching Sam argue with Claire about who is riding in the ambulance with him and who is taking Cas back to Jody's.
to talk to somebody, he really does. But this is so far out of their usual element, he isn't sure how Jody would take it.
As his leg swayed with the action, Dean looked up, a scowl written on his face and a threat on his tongue. Before he could say anything, Sam spoke.
regret getting to be the one to raise you. Was it good? Hardly, I had shit to work with and I was a kid too. That's why this is so different. I mean-Sammy, you were practically my first kid, this one...this one is just...different."
They were in the store, trying to stock up on anything they could possibly think of right now. Sam had written down a list of all the healthy food crap that Dean was going to need to start eating and he didn't like half of the shit on there.
Sam didn't stop until he had downed half of his drink, pulling in a deep breath when he finished. Still standing in the open fridge, Sam looked back over at him, disbelief and something like concern on his face.
Dean's still sitting down, thank god, but his arms are crossed over his chest and he looks anything but happy.
Caressing Dean's side until he came to a stop at his lower abdomen. Right where his "mini fruitcake" was as Dean so eloquently named.
Huffing out a sigh, he knows he's fit to burst. If the past few days have meant anything, it's that he isn't fine. He needs someone (other than his brother) to talk to about this. He's reaching for his phone before he can become anymore frustrated.
Maneuvering between other patrons, Dean isn't feeling the most apologetic when he squeezes by. He's in the baby isle before he can tell his feet to take him to the liquor isle.
Band-aid. This was just like a band-aid, he just needed to spit it out and then he could have what ever that glorious smell was wafting in from the kitchen.
It was so overwhelming that he nearly burst. Looking down at his hands, covered in cinnamon and sticky apple juice, he realized if he wanted to touch his stomach, he was going to get everything dirty.
Sam watched as his older brother continued washing his hands for him, and Sam, being the hapless puppy that he was, didn't stop him. He doesn't know if Dean is still talking about the burn...or the baby.
"Dean will be fine, I've helped his body in preparing for this gift. As for you," she starts, garnering Castiel's complete and utter attention. "You were willing to sacrifice the one thing you loved more than anything for my brother's creations. To answer your questions,
"Holy shit, that's so cool." Alex said, and Jody didn't even try to admonish her for it. She simply grabbed Dean's hand again.
He would make a wonderful parent. Castiel wouldn't even know where to begin taking care of a child. Sure, he's watched humans do it for centuries, he understands the basic mechanics, but to try a hand at it himself?
Dean had started fidgeting in his sleep a couple of minutes ago, but it wasn't anything Sam wasn't used to. Dean didn't sleep like a rock. He moved around his bed like he would in a fight.
His tie is already loosened, but he takes it a step further by untying it completely, and tucking it into his suit jacket.
As Mary reached the top of the stairs, her eyes were instantly drawn to the red on the floor by Dean's feet.
Sure, he still ralphed his guts out sometimes, but they had managed to keep him away from the big triggers.
"You don't have a concussion, you may have some tenderness from the fall, I can prescribe you some Tylenol if need be. Thankfully there was nothing behind you when you fainted-
Cas sets himself down into the only free seat left in the back and silently nods for the paramedic to continue.
Dean had specifically told Cas to watch out for Sammy, not ditch him as soon as he left the picture.
Yesterday it had been while he was making his bed, today it had been while he was watching t.v. He just couldn't help but stop and think.
Ambling after his brother, Sam made it to the clinic's waiting room to find Dean already at the front desk, checking in.
With armfulls of ice cream, potato chips, and jalapeno poppers (that need to be put in the oven...like stat) Dean was prepared to stuff his face full until he couldn't move.
The younger Winchester commends Castiel for trying to pry Dean's hands away, but he doesn't make much progress, only worsening Dean's state.
Shaking his head again, he's finally en route for the store absently rubbing his stomach. He was supposed to go in for a check up in a few days. The initial concern from the fall had gone away, and Doctor Mercury had a few standard pregnant-person things to look for. It was on the calendar in Sam's writing, so Sam must've made the appointment.
They make for the hallway, heading to their rooms to pack for their journey when Dean turns to look up at his brother once more.
Sam probably broke about thirty different laws getting to the clinic, but that wasn't important. What was important was pulling up, tires squealing, and lurching to a stop. Dean was out of the car before it came to a complete stop.
He's not big, by any means, his little fruitcake is a cup in his hand. But then again, he kind of has big hands.
Castiel looks down, he's so close to Dean like this, their arms are right against one another and his knee is pressed solidly against the gurney. Dean feels his eyes drop to the baby and he can't help but try and suck in his stomach. On his back, his shirt isn't hanging loose over his body. The faintest of bumps is resting just under his shirt and Cas is looking right at it.
Jody hadn't needed to push real hard to get her to apologize. She felt bad. She's not ashamed to admit it.
Sam was still sitting in the waiting area, pretending like he wasn't eavesdropping. Dean rolled his eyes, but he was happy nonetheless. It was nice to have someone in his corner. Even if he was a pain in the ass.
A small check up with his ears, eyes, and nose didn't show him much, but the doctor continued on with his examination. Dean sat, only moving when the doctor wanted to him to, and tried not to think about the possibilities of what might be causing his sickness.
She could also see the impending meltdown that the hunter was fighting to hold back. A proud man like Dean Winchester would
Getting out of the car, he takes care to shove the keys in his pocket along with the stash of cash from the glovebox.
He ran out of metaphors by then, but the meaning behind them each still stood. He sat there for a moment, ignoring the furrow in Sam's brow and the blatant interest in the doctor's. This was rural Kansas, this was probably the first time he'd ever met a transgendered person (even though Dean wasn't really, this is how they were explaining this phenomenon, and if he were to keep this baby, it would have to remain that way until the end of his pregnancy).
"We need to get some food in you, oh my god, there is so much that we'll have to do. I'll call into the station and we can spend today going over your list." She's already up and heading to the kitchen when she stops. Peeking her head around the corner, she asks, "you do have a list right? Things you need to still get for the baby and yourself for after?"
When he travels, flying place to place around the globe, the angel fears that the amulet isn't working. Just like the last time he used it.
It took almost two days to get home. His side had a large bruise on it, but from Sam's medical (not licensed, obviously) point of view,
She takes one look at him, at the man she's heard fought the devil and survived hell, and her heart weans for him. It's stupid and will probably be funnier later on, but Dean looks adorable.
With that in mind Dean went to look over Sam's picks, putting back what he absolutely hated, and grabbing more sweatpants than absolutely necessary.
Dean couldn't help but smirk. "Cas, we've talked about the birds and the bees. Do we really gotta go over how babies are made?" At Castiel's frown, Dean coughed.
"Oh, hey, good idea, blueberries have a high count of vitamin C." He said, taking the package right out of Dean's hands and setting it in the cart.
Half of his pillow is wrapped around his front, slithering up his side, and the rest is tucked under his head and against the window. Sam is probably having a hard time seeing out of the side mirror, but Dean just found a position that relieves the pain in his tailbone.
It's meant to be a light comment, but there's something that passes over Dean's face. Someone that didn't know him probably wouldn't have registered any change in his expression. But Sam has literally spent most of his life
"Sammy," He starts and his little brother looks over at him, deer-in-the-headlights. "You wouldn't happen to know why Cas ended up in Thailand. Would you?"
Sam calls out after him, "Doctor says you can't have coffee anymore!" And Dean's day just gets all the more difficult.
Like he said, physical sensations and shit. He was becoming tactile and damn if that didn't look clingy.
tired. Sam must notice because he's trying to calmly suggest he drive Baby while Dean gets into the back for another nap.
It's so sudden that Dean stops pulling at his hair. He opens his eyes and finds Cas' staring right into his.
Claire opens her mouth, but nothing comes out. It wouldn't matter either way, Dean keeps trucking on like he never stopped in the first place.
"So," she said, pushing the cart. Dean dreaded whatever was going to come out of her mouth next, but still followed after her as she walked.
Dean held the picture in his hands, half listening to the doctor and half memorizing the image before him.
He stands beside the fire, wondering, briefly, if there is any heat coming off of the flames. He certainly doesn't feel any warmer.
Turning, she holds out the preferred dress to Dean like it's just a pair of pants or something normal for him to wear.
Dean doesn't feel the tears welling up in his eyes until Cas reaches over the bench seat with a gentle hand. As soon as the angel touches him, Dean jumps, and the tears pour over without his permission.
A knock on the door sounds and Sam is standing in the doorway with a jar of pickles in hand. Dean doesn't even register Claire's cry of surprise when he shoves her out of the way to get it.
"What the hell does that have to do with the results of that test? Did you find out what was wrong with me or not Doc?"
Both Sam and the Doctor had said exercising was important. Running away from his problems sounded like a great idea then.
Dean doesn't honestly know how they talked him into it. One minute he was sitting in bed, propped up (thanks to his head injury and the FIVE chickens mother-henning him to death). And the next, Claire is bringing him a snack and Alex is fluffing his pillows.
Sam had gone to the library in search of some texts for their most recent hunt and Castiel had followed right after him. If he wanted to truly find an answer to this, he would have to go directly to the source.
Either way, it isn't a hassle getting out of the car. He does however, feel a ping of regret when he has to shove the pregnancy pillow into the trunk. Shuffling forward, his slippered feet do all of the walking as he makes his way back into the bunker.
But she'll never forget the way his lip trembled and his breath hitched. She nearly shivers remembering it now.
Dean straightened up at the question. Sobering instantly, like a light switch went off in his head. Jody was a Sheriff. She had
"Stop touching me." He pleads and both men back away from him, snatching their hands and arms back as if they were burned.
Dean's face was flushed. Sam had already seen the bruise and it extended from Dean's hip to the start of his ribs. The doctor was probably going to ask him to undress and Dean probably wanted some privacy to do so.
Sam blinks, he looks confused, but Castiel can't be certain. The expressions that the younger Winchester make are always so hard to interpret, much more so than Dean. But then again, he could spend a millennia staring at Dean Winchester, he's probably already memorized every freckle on that man's face by now he could paint a picture of him with his eyes closed.
"I thought she was talking about mom." Sam gives him a sad smile from across the table, but he doesn't say anything. Dean was doing really well just talking to begin with. He didn't need any more support than what the girls were offering already.
He's on his feet, wringing his hands together. Cas makes it through the crowd of travelers with only a backpack and the wicked start of a beard. It reminds Dean of the one he had in Purgatory.
Dean was conscious, that much he knew. He could feel his entire body aching, so he had to be awake. He didn't open his eyes though, intent to just lie here in denial for a few more minutes.
But everyone in the Mills house knows why he's suddenly rounder than usual. At twelve weeks, he's got a bump that finds its way into his hands whether he's conscious about it or not.
"You know what, I think I saw a few other pairs that might work, I'll go right back out and check with the floor manager."
It wasn't until three days later that Dean remembered his slip up. He was alone in the bunker, for once Sammy had finally gotten off of his back with his mother henning.
Moving too quickly he knocked over a pile of research studies that Sam had printed off, with his sonogram picture on top.
So Sam pretends not to see Dean sneak another pickle, turning the music up in favor of listening to his brother crunch away, and makes toward Jody's.
Finishing the preliminary examination, the doctor sat down in front of him, the clipboard holding his intake form in hand. "So, I see on your form you said you were experiencing strong bouts of nausea, I have to ask, are you taking anything that might be inspiring nausea or inducing vomiting?"
But one stupid phrase from the kid had him all jumbled up in the head and he let it show how fucked up he really was.
"Oh for the love of- you know what, fine. I'll go to the friggen doctor if it will shut you up." Dean seethes.
Just the mention of sleep made Dean tired. But, ralphing up his guts and doing an hour of research would do that. He barely registered Cas pulling him to rest against his side, but Dean was too out of it to care. Cas was warm and he smelled like woodsy goodness. The angel's arms came around him without provocation. A smile was tugging at the corner of his mouth as Dean cuddled into his chest.
The spiraling thoughts didn't help his stomach. He was on his knees, clutching the toilet for dear life. When he finally stopped, he was almost afraid to breathe in. Sitting up, panting through his mouth, he fought it as long as he could. Until he was on the brink of hyperventilating.
It was like Cas couldn't hold himself back anymore. He was moving, taking the space that separated them, and reaching out to touch Dean's stomach. Dean was frozen in shock when he felt Castiel's hands on him. Something deep and hedonistic was churning low in his gut and he had to clear his throat to get Castiel's attention.
There's a heartrate clip on one of his fingers but Castiel doesn't mind the press of it against his knuckles. If anything, it seems to ground him more in this moment.
Two shakes and a cup full of pee later, the doctor was asking the boys to wait while he processed Dean's sample.
With his eyes closed, he didn't see his brother reaching out for him, but he did feel his hand closing around his.
Claire is out of her seat before Dean can fully lose his shit. Dean, for a second, thinks that she's stormed off, but she comes back with a pen and paper before he can even ask. The two share a look and Dean can't help but feel immensely proud of her.
They totally tricked him. They weakened his defenses, waited until he was full and on the brink of sleep to pounce.
Gently pulling his hand away, the doctor felt around the surface of his head, stopping only to shine a light directly into each of his eyes.
He's in Sammy's nursery. The crib sits against the wall beneath him, the dresser is diagonal to the door, and he's stuck to the ceiling. The fire is warm now, slowly creeping up the walls of the bedroom and causing a sweat to break out all over his body.
"Now we have to use the transducer, even though your pregnancy is fairly early. A penetrative wand would provide a clearer image, but with this...situation...we'll make do."
"We'll talk about it at home. I know who did this, and it isn't exactly something we can talk to the doctor about."
"Cas, I'm fine, it's just these damn hormones. I didn't think they would be this bad, but," he said, pulling away. "I straight up almost cried over blueberries the other day. There is literally nothing to stop them, they just happen whenever the hell they want to."
Dean watches with sullen eyes as Jody waves goodbye to them from the porch. Logically, he knows he's going to see them again, it's just the thought of
"Okay, now that we've got all the things that we could find on your list, is there anything else you were interested in looking for today?" Jody asked.
Dean's smile died down and Sam hated it. He hated feeling so useless, stuck watching Dean do everything because he wasn't prepared or educated enough on the subject to help him.
"Thank you for coming in as quickly as you did. I noticed something in the samples of blood that we drew on your first visit. I recall you telling me you had "bad" luck and should test you for the more...creative or archaic diseases or outlandish disorders."
Yo, to figure out the date of this friggen ordeal, I had to go back and see when the episode actually aired of "Alpha and Omega". It came out May 25th, and twelve weeks after that is August 17th (of 2016). Had to get all mathematical in this bitch.
Castiel was leaning back against the counter, his hands holding him upright as he felt a tingling in his palm. Right where he had touched Dean.
He might have gone down the rabbit hole of Babies-R-Us, lost in the neverland of toys, but he couldn't help it. He was going to have a baby and babies used tiny little toys. Tiny little giraffes, happy little bunnies, bright red trucks, a set of keys that couldn't possibly start any kind of vehicle, and one of those annoying popper vacuums.
When Dean finally pulled himself away from the desk, he sat down heavily in the seat across from Sam. He was scribbling notes down onto the clipboard the nurse had handed him. Stretching out, Sam lightly kicked Dean's foot to grab his attention.
He's got a small roundness that can't be seen without lifting his shirt. If he were drinking still, he'd probably think he was showing signs of a beer belly, something he could work off or a ghost could beat out of him.
It's been years since he's had a break like this, but Sam has seen it before. Their father did a number on Dean without even having to lay a single finger on him. He causes Dean to retreat into the far recesses of his mind. To ignore even his basest needs.
The phone is already up against his head before he can ignore the message. He'd never blatantly ignore Jody like that, not after all that she's done for them.
Sam came around the corner then, having found them after his own little recon mission. Dean looked up as his little brother approached them, there was something akin to a smile on Sam's face and Dean wasn't entirely sure if that was a good thing or not. The little shit was downright devious when he wanted to be, so Dean wasn't surprised when Sam pulled something out from behind his back.
They had already got what they needed in the pants department, but they weren't done with his lower half just yet.
The first thing he does when he wakes up is think about coffee, but Sam and the dumb doctor said he needed to cut back on his caffeine intake.
They went over board. But he liked the shirts. He wasn't too proud to admit he almost cried when he had to put his jeans back on.
too thick some days when he was battling his new weird temperature changes. He was not going to call them hot flashes. He needed better shirts, something breathable. And more unfortunately, he needed a different kind of underwear.
Dean tries to shake his head, but Cas won't let him get far. So he says between short breaths, "can't."
But putting on pants that didn't look remotely stupid was harder than fighting the devil. Men's clothes didn't have a maternity section so he was stuck with what the women's section had.
The jalapeno peppers are beeping in the oven and Dean is stuck sitting there with his dumb thoughts. They are going to burn if he doesn't get up, but he's pretty sure he's having a mini mental breakdown and he doesn't want to risk splitting his already fucked up head by getting up.
Sam was already in the store ahead of him. Jody was probably already in the baby isle and Alex and Claire had gone off to school. Thank Chuck, he didn't need anymore eyes on him.
"Sammy, I swear, if you ever say spinach, mushroom and omelet again, I'm going to projectile vomit all over you."
"I'll figure it out, I don't need some creepy old dude in gloves telling me to bend over and cough for a little nausea."
It was still light out, which meant Sam was still awake and would notice Dean bringing this inside. His eyes welled up with tears of frustration. He just wanted to take a nap. He didn't need Sam psychoanalyzing him as soon as he walked through the front door.
"Lift your foot, okay, we're doing good, c'mon other leg." Jody said, easing the waistband up his legs.
"Dean? What is it, c'mon man you gotta talk to me." Sam pleaded. He was hovering over his brother, following after him as Dean paced.
Sam is packing his bag, there isn't much left to pack because they never take out more than they need each day. It's a force of habit, living from their duffle bags.
An hour later has them sitting in the waiting room of the nearest doctor. A private practice, small, but this was rural Kansas he wasn't expecting Vegas. Anything bigger than a shoe box worked for him.
Dean blinked, suddenly bewildered. He was quick to snatch the package out of the cart, holding it close to his chest.
His shirt isn't skin tight, but they both saw the bump. There's no mistaking the look on their faces.
"Okay, so when we're finished here, Dean and I will be heading to a few other stores. I'll need you to go to the electronics store and look for some baby monitors, I've sent you a few that work really well signal-wise for the bunker's depth. Also, there is a bookstore in here with a couple of books on feeding techniques and I want you to find one and grab whatever bottle brand they recommend."
Sam sighs, scratching the hair at the back of his head. If it's possible his hair smells like pickle juice, and Sam isn't particularly happy about that. Because that means Dean has somehow managed to turn him into a pickle, and now he's going to be eaten.
"You're brother is on the right track except, your baby is about the size of a blueberry, not a peanut. Most importantly, from what I can see, everything looks great. The fall had no effect on your little berry."
How was he to be sure no one would come looking for them? To come and try and take, or Chuck forbid,
His phone is in his pocket and he fishes it out, pulling up the picture of his sonogram. He sets it on the table for all three girls to look at and they jump at the opportunity.
Dean doesn't answer, the cloud at the back of his head turns rainy when he looks over at Cas for too long. Or maybe it's the blood loss. Shit, how hard did he hit his head, it feels like he just got struck by a bat.
It isn't what he expects, but then again this is a dream, and he's never really been in control of his dreams before. A fire sits in the distance. Acting like a beacon in the black of this never-ending night.
Dean lets out a quick huff through his nose, finally looking up at the sheriff with a bemused expression.
He hadn't even noticed the board had changed. But Dean did recognize that dark crazy head of hair coming down the terminal.
Sam is slowly trying to scoot further away on the bench, trying to avoid the inevitable. Dean will find out that Sam gave Cas the amulet and Dean will kill them both.
He wasn't going to chide Dean or tease him, but the picture he took with his phone was definitely something he was going to send to Cas.
He couldn't help but pick up a package, trying to inspect it further. They looked so...blue, obviously, but seriously these little guys were small.
"Sorry for bumping into you earlier, I didn't mean to make you drop your hot pocket." The apology sounds ludicrous but she honestly means it.
The voices are bickering once more, only louder, and he hears the distinct sound of a camera going off before two sets of feet go running out of the living room.
is one of the things I'd have to figure out in our battle with the supernatural. Are you shitting me? A kid? Oh god-
What has him sitting up in his seat and crumbs falling onto Jody's carpet is the sound of a familiar gravelly voice.
He was too surprised to react, Jody had already figured his size and was dropping two of the packages into the cart.
His panic had gotten to the point that Sam had scrambled for one of their brown convenience store bags and made Dean breathe into it.
He isn't willing to drive himself, or the baby, crazy with worry. Castiel was a big boy, he could take care of himself. Plus, he wasn't taken, he had willingly left the bunker, leaving Dean in the dead of night.
Dr. Mercury was more than happy to answer all of Sam's questions, especially after answering the biggest one that the doctor, himself, had. How had a man gotten pregnant? Easy, he had the right parts...ish.
Dean is sitting on the couch, mindlessly eating a bag of chips (the baked kind because sam won't let him have anything else).
Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he made to flush the toilet. He was already brushing his teeth when Sam came into the bathroom.
Chuck dammit, he wanted a hole to open beneath him. He wanted to cry and punch Sam and his dumb, baby-less stomach for getting to do literally anything other than this.
It's a few minutes later that a knock sounds on the door and Dean has to lift his head out of his miserable pile on the bed. He doesn't get the chance to answer before Claire is letting herself into the room.
, kind of, but he was still trying to figure out Amara's reasoning. Sure, she brought mom back, THAT was what he needed most, not...not a
Sam was right behind him when Dr. Mercury led them toward one of the empty rooms. He didn't say anything when he entered the room, his feet carried him over to the sink and he dutifully washed his hands.
"Dean-" The timer cuts Sam off, and the smell of something burning pulls both of their attention now. Sam rushes toward the oven, haphazardly grabbing for the cooking sheet with a dishtowel. It isn't thick enough to protect him from the heat, but it works long enough for him to throw the tray onto the stove.
Cas was squinting at him, his lips were warm against Dean's palm and Dean pulled away like he was burned.
"H-he said not to. So I won't, don't tell him I did, okay Sammy?" Dean says and Sam feels like he's been punched in the gut.
Jody had long since moved to sit down, and she was glad she did because she seriously thought she was dreaming for a second. Dean Winchester,
Sam paused, his eyes flit to the farthest corner of the room. They had never talked about this. When they were kids Sam practically hated Dean. But then again, kids rarely enjoy their parents. Always bossing them around, taking care of them by taking all the hard jobs like Dean had. He'd probably be some snooty pompous asshole if Dean hadn't raised him.
"All right, I'll see you shortly Mr. Bonham." The line dropped and Dean was suddenly left standing in the quiet hall, confused and worried, possibly even a little scared. Not that he was going to admit that out loud, much less to his brother. Still, he called out to him as he rushed down the hall once more.
"Stop," Sam says, grabbing onto his hand. The band of the belt is stretching over Dean's hips, rubbing right against his belly, but Sam isn't entirely sure that Dean knows what he's doing.
"She thanked me for, well I guess giving her 'what she needed most' and then said she wanted to do the same for me. You know as well as I do what that meant. She brought back mom and I thought that was it. I didn't think that-that I'd be ballooning up with a baby I didn't know about. This isn't "I didn't know I was pregnant," this is real life. And in a million years I didn't think
It doesn't take a genius to see that Dean is uncomfortable. Sure, he has all of the leg room in the world, thanks to Sam's gigantor legs beside him, but he can't lean back.
It was only once he was seated on the examination table and Sam was standing guard beside him that the doctor started.
"I know that we help people, Claire. I know we've done some good. But I have done enough. I'm retiring. And I'm not worried about leaving the world in the hands if other hunters, do you want to know why?"
But the hot pocket had been pretty ordinary in comparison to his disgusting sandwich. And he really had been looking forward to that pickle all day. They all knew it, he practically said it a hundred times around the house that day.
He was barely sitting in the waiting room for three minutes before Dr. Mercury was rushing out to greet him and Sam. Initially, Sam had been worried out of his freaking mind, chattering almost non-stop the entire ride over. It was like talking to a five year old. Dean would answer one question and Sam would have three more to ask after that.
Sam presses his lips together in a firm line. There's little traffic on this road and he's already looking for somewhere to stop. As he finds a safe spot along the shoulder of the road, Sam turns them toward it, steadily slowing them down.
The angel's eyes find them easily, while they don't exactly stand out in a crowd of South Dakotans, Sam is easily the tallest person around. He's like a rock in a river, the crowd just parts around him.
"Dean, his name is Dean and I have to get back to him. He's pregnant." Cas says and everyone in the nearby area stops. The nurse looks at him, not exactly thrown, but it wasn't something she had been expecting today. He won't be the first trans man to fall pregnant, but he was certainly the first to show up in the emergency room.
Looking down, Dean sees the many notifications that his phone is so kind to remind him of, and checks the time.
He didn't understand how his briefs weren't cutting it, but the bands were becoming a problem, leaving imprints under his stomach that itched when he changed.
He walks for what seems like years, growing colder and colder as time passes on. The darkness never seems to end. There are no walls to touch and no doors to open. Its like he's in the ocean, except there's no water to drown him in. Strangely enough, he doesn't think he needs the water. Darkness fills his lungs and continues to devour him to the point of madness.
Which, with their track records of nightmares and getting knocked out on a regular basis, being unconscious is one of the hardest things they have to do.
kids to look after. She had more important things to do then listen to Dean bitch about his first experience as a woman.
"Can't do what honey?" She asks but Dean shakes his head, clutching onto her all the more tighter as he buries his face in her scent.
And that was it. He was definitely crying now, snot threatening to trickle into his mouth and the hand not holding his phone was covering his eyes. Good god. He was such a fricken mess.
"Sammy, it's getting dark." Dean says, matter if factly, and Sam fleetingly looks out the window. They've been on the road most of the day and, honestly, Dean lasted a lot longer than Sam thought he would, but if this is why, then Sam wishes he hadn't said anything in the first place.
he said, trying to push past the oddity that was his real and actual life, "got her to stop and they kind of headed off for a family reunion. Before she left, she said she was going to give me something that I needed."
The receptionist had already taken the clipboard he had filled out with their latest (fakest) credentials. He went with his first name just to be ahead of the curve. He could answer to pretty much any name by now, but if something really was wrong, he wanted the doctor to tell him, the REAL him, or as close as he could get without turning up any old warrants.
on Dean's face. There's sweat matting his hair to his forehead, his eyes are clenched shut and he's rocking back and forth as subtly as possible.
The ambulance driver says something through the small window ahead and the paramedic starts moving around Dean, gently asking Castiel to sit back as he readies Dean to be moved to the hospital. The ambulance slows down, coming to a complete stop and Castiel watches as the driver comes around to help the paramedic set Dean on the ground, already rolling him toward the emergency rooms.
"Doc, I gotta be honest, I got pretty weird luck so if I'm sick it's probably something weird or something old. If it's bad, I'm telling you, I probably got it. And if I don't got it, I'll probably get flattened by a piano or something on my way out of the office."
"Cas-he knows. He called me when I was looking at the baby clothes, thought he was you, and I just blurt out stuff about the baby. I didn't even think about it."
Stopping at a nearby stop sign, Dean shook that thought from his head. It was unsettling enough being Sam's brother, Chuck knows he couldn't carry that man's baby. The guy was a fricken moose. And more importantly, his kale-hopped up
It sounds nice, but Sam knows what set Dean off. He told Dean not to complain about being stuck up in the front seat, but then again, they hadn't given him much of a choice in the first place. Sam made the pallet of blankets in the back seat, he hadn't even asked Dean where he wanted to sit.
He stalked out of the library and made his way down the hall, back toward his room. Castiel didn't know at first if he should follow or not, but when Sam looked over his shoulder, the angel moved to comply.
"Great, I'll remember that. While you were making friends with the throne, your phone was ringing. It's Dr. Mercury."
How odd was it that his brain had already normalized the thought. Of course he was pregnant. He was at a certain age where most people started their families. It was just time for him to start his.
But that doesn't mean he didn't get distracted on hunts. Which is why it was perfectly fine that he wasn't looking for the book.
So, they kept their mouths shut whenever he had food in his hand. If it's even right to call his monster creations food.
Dean furrows his brow. He doesn't look angry or freaked out anymore, if anything, he looks confused. And rightfully so, Sam was confused too.
The angel had been sitting at the table, absently reading, when he felt Dean's rising need. He moved without thought, careful to tread around Dean's dazed and dreaming figure. He was behind him then, a hand reaching out subconsciously for Dean's side.
Dean must be making a face or something because Jody has stopped talking. She turns to look at him fully, something pensive sweeps across her face, a fleeting thought that she doesn't push him further on.
He'd wake up, get dressed or put on his robe, he'd start making breakfast for everyone and then he'd go toward the coffee machine.
When Dean could finally swallow without dry heaving, Castiel was already handing him a wet napkin to wipe his face with.
Sam cleared his throat, sheepish, but he looked supportive, so Dean wasn't going to yell at him for coming with him. He probably would have handled this a lot worse had Sammy not been there.
If this were any other time, he'd probably be disgusted with himself, but right now, he couldn't care less. If he was going to eat stupid rabbit food, he was going to do it with some flavor.
His eyes meets Dean's in the rearview mirror, Dean is halfway through a pickle, eyes wide open like a deer caught in the headlights.
He can still feel the blood on his stomach. He knows its there. The air feels as constricted here as it did in his dream. The pregnancy pillow is in the way and Dean shoves it off of his body with little preamble.
Knowing he probably sent Dean scurrying off to his room, Sam rolled his eyes and tried to finish his session without the cranky commentary.
Cas finally pulled away from Dean, looking at Sam with such a look of confusion that Sam was briefly puzzled. "Of course I'm okay with this, and even if I wasn't, it's not like Dean ever listens to me."
Now that he's sitting back once more, his free hand is pooled on his lap, he's consciously fighting the urge to cup his belly now that he has all of the attention right on him.
It was hard just getting himself to respond to her check-in texts, let alone schedule an in-person meeting. If she even wanted to see him again.
Dean pulled away from the results, not fighting as Sam wrenched the clipboard out of his hands to read the results himself. Dean's mind was preoccupied. Remembering in vivid detail his interaction with God and Amara.
But Sam knows his brother, he knows getting him to sit down will be easier than getting him to calm down.
starting to mess with him. First it was the crying and the mood swings, and now it was like his sex drive just went through the roof. He probably shouldn't be getting excited around his best friend, of all people, especially because he was 1. a man. and 2. an angel of the lord.
"I think I'd like to take a couple of blood samples and run a few tests, try and see if there might be any contributing factors other than stress, but I can call you in a few days to process the results."
Dean was half out of his seat, ready to tackle Cas to the ground. But it was too late. Castiel bent down to grab the picture, staring at it intently like he did whenever he was trying to read someone's thoughts.
He turned on his heel then, making toward where he last saw his brother. He only got so far before he remembered the onesie and quickly turned back around. He snatched it up from the ground, leaving behind the useless, adorable little shoes, and was making his way back when he remembered why he went in this area of the store to begin with.
It's when he's coming his little brother's hair back, rubbing a heavy hand down his back like he used to do when he was just a baby, that Sam relaxes.
He was the reason she got into hunting. She'd learned most of what she knows from him. She wanted to become a hunter and how could she do that if her idol was settling down for an apple pie life?
As he takes in another lungful of air, just as jagged as the rest, he opens his eyes. The look on her face is so open and understanding that Dean almost wants to look away. It isn't fair. He should hate her, he shouldn't want to curl up in her arms.
He landed roughly, rolling to a stop, and Sam rushed to his side. They could only look up in fear as Lucifer dropped the handcuffs. Dean didn't move when Castiel dropped to his knees.
His head hurt. The mother of all migraines was creeping up his skull, settling amongst his worried thoughts. It was as unnerving as it was annoying. Rubbing at the back of his head, Dr. Mercury stood now beside him.
When the doctor returned, he was holding a number of pamphlets in hand. Chuck only knew what they all said, but Sammy, the little shit, would undoubtedly read them all later. So when the doctor handed them over, Dean was quick to pass them off to his brother.
When Sam emerges, holding out the amulet to him, Castiel can't help but fold it gently into his palm. Looking up, he nods his appreciation to the man, and in the next blink of Sam's eyes, the angel is gone.
Rubbing a tired hand down his face, he wanders for a moment. He's restless but not tired at the same time. It's seriously infuriating most days. One would think he was running marathons or climbing mountains with how tired his body is.
"I was sick for a couple of weeks and Sammy made me go to the doctor's. I uh, I told the doctor we got shit luck and to look for the weirdest crap out there, because y'know, I could've had anything by that point. But a few days later, he asked us to go back and he dropped the baby bomb on me."
That space looks like a canyon between them. There is an emptiness on his memory foam mattress that is calling out to Dean, begging him to return. It's an odd thought to think. He's a grown ass man, he shouldn't want to spend the day curled up like a little kid between his two favorite people.
kids. You've never had to raise another living being," a small smile creeps onto Dean's face and it has Sam cocking up an eyebrow in response.
Seeing as it was a maternity store, the only underwear they had was for pregnant women. Nonetheless, Jody was undeterred. She grabbed a couple of packages, reaching into the back and pulling out a single pair. Before Dean could ask what she was doing, Jody was pushing him, gently turning him around as she measured the underwear against the back of his jeans.
Any doubts he had on whether or not he wanted to keep the baby vanished. He wanted his baby. More importantly, he wanted his baby to be okay.
He's standing before a mountain, no trace of humanity for miles, and he's losing hope. The trench coat around him feels stifling. There's snow nearby, but Castiel doesn't allow that to stop him from taking off that burdensome layer.
"And I'm tired all the time. Like before you got here, I was reading those damn pregnancy books and if I hadn't been shoveling carrots down like candy, I probably would have fallen asleep. Sam found me yesterday passed out in the laundry room. I was just folding friggen laundry."
Yes, a baby. He knows what it's called, he just...can't call it that...yet. He's warmed up to the idea of keeping the little bastard, but with the random bouts of panic he gets when reminded that he's a pregnant man, he's becoming more wary.
And that was confusing, but he didn't care. If he acted softer it's because he wanted to. If he held on to hugs longer than he would have before, it's because he wanted to.
It took a second to realize it, but Sammy wasn't even looking at his face. He was looking at his stomach.
he did, and that was a BIG "if," that would mean he would have to quit hunting. There was no way in hell he would drag a kid around on hunts like his father had done.
It's with his hands rubbing up and down his arms that he treks through this abyss. Complete and utter darkness befalls him and he doesn't know how he came to this place, or even what this place is.
He was heading to the garage, fully intent on driving up and down the streets of Lebanon until he found his brother. Before he could get so far as climbing into one of the many other cars in the garage, he saw the impala.
He hovers, but not in the same way that Sam does. Sam treats Dean like he's made out of glass and literally anything has the ability to hurt him.
The thought was a pleasant one, giving him the smallest of smiles and the biggest waves of pride in his chest.
Sitting at the table, surrounded by half empty tubs of ice cream and three different bags of chips, looking at his phone like it killed his puppy.
It was odd, working alongside a demon. Though, it wasn't something the Winchester's hadn't done before, but for Castiel, Crowley was just another thorn in his side.
His hand stops rubbing one of his arms. His whole body stops trembling for a moment. Reaching out, unsure and ignorant as ever, he touches the flame.
He sighs. It's been three, almost four weeks that Mary has been back and he wants to talk to her all the time. Like when he was a kid and he'd wait outside of the bathroom for her to finish. Kind of like what Sam had done for him today.
"You don't know what it's like to be a parent, to lose a child." She says and Dean feels that shame rip through his body as icy cold realization dawns on him. She doesn't know. Not about Fruitcake, not about him raising Sammy.
Claire had taken to scouting out every room for possible dangers, going so far as to move all of the knives in the kitchen. She won't even let him microwave his own stuff. She was convinced (by both Alex
But, Dean's eyes glaze over in this shroud of darkness, and Castiel fears Dean wouldn't be able to answer even if he asked. Gently, he cups the side of Dean's face, ever-so-slowly turning him towards him.
He didn't know why, but anytime someone asked him that question, even before he got pregnant, he got upset.
It should probably be annoying, how often the angel is around, but it isn't. He stays close enough that if Dean needs him, he's right there. And with how emotional and tactile and downright clingy he's been, Dean isn't complaining.
The wheels are on this bad boy and he's just realized that the more people that he tells, the more real all of this becomes. Good God, he thought he and Sam were bad when it came to shopping for the baby, Jody was going to go nuts on baby shit.
"Don't worry about it kiddo. We're still going to be here, that's not going to change. So if Fruitcake has a monster under their bed, I fully expect you to come check it out. Okay?"
"I was fixing up the back seat. Even if it's been two weeks and your stitches have dissolved, you still got to take it easy Dean."
"The cooler is in the Impala. Jody has informed me that she has packed extra 'gas station pickles'?" He says, but it isn't so much a statement as it is a question.
He looks down even further, unsure of when he came into a room. It's familiar in a way he isn't willing to admit. But as the fire grows, he can't deny it any longer.
