(I know I don’t have enough time left to call you. Will you miss me? I can barely muster the strength to press a few feeble buttons on my phone to dial the police. An ambulance will come too late to save me, but soon enough to try. Pain shoots through my body, my transport, pumping in sync with my pulse. I can’t keep my eyes open. I can’t keep my mind rational. Fantasies and realities collide. I am everywhere with you, before I realize that I am nowhere but here. Alone.)
John, from where he stood, couldn’t help his sharp intake of breath. More dark cigarette burns littered Sherlock’s frame. A raised, red scar adorned his left shoulder blade: a massive, ragged cut that had been left to infection. Fine white lines were painted across his entire back, and it took John a moment to realize they were scars from a whip. They glinted in the window’s light.
Maybe they were both broken.
He would have killed you.
Don’t you understand why I had to do it? Why I had to lie to you and leave you? Please understand. I had no choice. I should probably tell you that I’m not dead, not really.
And Sherlock, of all people, was creating it. The arrogant enigma of a broken man. It humanized him. It took a second for John to realize what he had done. Needless to say, John Watson was disgusted with himself in the most overwhelming way. Sherlock had warned him that first night… had warned him of the monster he’d turn into. Instead of relaxing him, now, the music ensnared John and tangled him in its slurs.
John hesitated just long enough for Sherlock to turn his head and look at him, look down at his outstretched hand, and press his lips into a firm line.
You are asleep, lying on your back. Are you dead? I wonder. That is how still you are. I have to focus on the sound of your shallow breathing to remind myself of your aliveness. I reach out my hand. It is an involuntary movement of muscles and tendons, much like the beating of a heart and the pumping of blood. I rest a finger on your cheek and trace my name. Then I trace your name. Then I trace shapes and images from past cases and your favorite type of tea and all the things you have ever said to me. I trace my fingers in patterns along your skin and if ever there was a moment to be able to freeze time, this would be it, this would be it.
“I—nothing,” John muttered.
"Excuse me?" John's eyes rose from the contents of the kit he was examining.
“He made me tell my mom I tripped and fell, and you, Sherlock, are the only one who knows the real story.” John grimaced, a harsh smile in the dark.
"Why ever not?"
Thinking about it, I suppose this could be a goodbye.
The deep rumble of a voice filled the space between them. “I don’t mind.” A soft, deep, rumbling whisper of a voice. Like distant thunder. Oh, Sherlock.
“Fine.” I tilt my head to look at you. I need to figure out why you’re so suddenly here, out of the blue. I need to deduce it… but nothing on your face or your clothes or your posture gives me any sort of indication.
“You… you’re making the face,” Sherlock declared.
And then Sherlock had come into his room, his bed, and comforted him after all that happened. Would this change anything? Everything? John didn’t know. And if Sherlock acted so forgiving after something so painful, after being bloody whipped, would he act the same way if John were to try something… different? Would he still act so forgiving? John couldn't help but wonder.
John pursed his lips. “Well, yes.” That was the reason John chose him, wasn’t it? The man—the slave—was still human.
Again, the slave’s reply was stiff. “No, it’s fine.”
"I think you know bloody well why I did it," John snapped.
Sherlock turned the corner of lips up, rueful, and said lightly, “You’re a doctor, John. Playing stupid doesn’t suit you.” He rubbed one hand absently around the other.
Silver rain painted the windows of our flat. I was bored—nothing unusual. Sulking and snapping when all you were being was kind. Maybe if I hadn’t sulked, hadn’t snapped, you would love me? You offered me tea, but I was too far deep into my mind to acknowledge, hands steepled trademark under my chin. When I’m like this, you don’t think I can hear you, do you? An error. I listen to everything you tell me.
“Why not?”
“John Watson, you never cease to surprise me.”
His breathing picked up when he heard the first of three zippers open. Flashes of memories ricocheted through his mind. Nightmares. Too soon, the fingers were tangled at the back of his head once more.
I closed my eyes and spoke to you in one thousand different ways, yet all that came out was a broken, “Okay.”
John took no notice. “Get some more today, Sherlock, I’ve got work.”
Sherlock’s jaw twitched, and John shifted on his feet. “Would you like some tea, Harry?”
Or breathe.
I am so sorry.
There are two cups of tea on the table. There’s a skull on the mantel. There are bullet holes and spray paint faces on the wall, and there is some sort of an experiment in the kitchen.
Was this really who he was becoming? A heartless ex-soldier who agreed to the sexual assault of a helpless man? Christ. He was becoming despicable and well aware of it. Sherlocks words floated through his consciousness, “It does things to a person, slavery.”
Sherlock stared.
And didn’t move.
"Neither was I."
John stood from his laptop when a knock resounded from the door of the flat. A sandy-haired woman appeared in the doorway. She was short, with blue eyes identical to John’s. Sherlock’s eyes flickered towards her, then back towards his book.
“Ah, whatever you say, Sherlock, and I’ll believe it.” Angelo laughed and winked and said, “Let me grab the two of you a candle. Dinner is on the house for you and your date tonight, Sherlock!”
John walked over to him, posture solid and a bit intimidating. Sherlock kept stubborn eyes on his paper, so John reached down and turned Sherlock’s chin toward him. He leaned down and kissed Sherlock, long and slow. “Get the milk, please.” He phrased it like a question and said it like a command.
Sherlock followed, and replied with mock servitude. “Does that bother you, Dr. Watson?"
Let me give you a piece of advice, if you ever have need of it. I doubt you will; you’re good with a gun.
John stepped closer, leaned in, and kissed Sherlock. It was chaste, a tender press of lips, until John felt Sherlock’s hand wrap around the back of his neck and felt the man’s mouth part beneath his own.
“I’m going out. For a case,” I tell you, sliding on my coat. “A double murder. I know where the killer is staying the night…”
“Yeah, she is,” John responded, just as Sherlock said “Aha!” and lifted his phone from under a small pile of scribbled-on papers.
Sherlock realized, glaringly, that John Watson was not a kind man, nor was he a monster. John Watson didn’t fit into categories.
Mary loves you, and I love you. You see only Mary.
Sherlock rolled onto his back. “Alright, fine. Usually I don’t sleep. But what on earth do you expect me to do all night here? Are there experiments for me to work on? I’d end up more bored awake than I would sleeping,” He spoke to John as if the middle aged ex-military doctor were some daft, bumbling, toddler. Insulting.
So John, unable to refuse or argue any more, turned towards the options presented to him. He leaned on his cane and observed. There were some women: his age, perhaps a few years younger, and definitely pretty. Their heads hung, gazes trained on the ground. Maybe... John thought, but he was quick to correct himself.
Sherlock’s brow creased, and he tonelessly asked, “You’re sorry?”
Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock strolled into the room. "Small," he said, spinning around to fully assess their space. His coat twirled.
Sherlocks eyes were alight, and the afternoon sun filtered through the flat’s windows, warming the room in a comfortable glow.
"Sherlock, I'm sorry… I'm so sorry," John murmured desperately, tangled in a dream.
This time it was a flash of fear that rested on Sherlock's facial features. Fear and shame and vulnerability. They were there, no matter how hard the slave tried to cover them up with false arrogance, and John hated the way the emotions rested on the angular face. The shirt slid off, and Sherlock's eyes stared at the wall past John's head in quiet defiance.
“No.”
Another desire, for I have so many: to be your nightmares, John.
(I stumble, falling against the stone wall of the alleyway. I look down at my open coat. The rain-soaked white shirt beneath it is stained crimson, now. I can’t breath. I can’t breath. Where are you? You should be here; You always are here. You could save me. I trusted you to save me, you’ve done it before. I slide down the wall, slumping into the gutter.)
A post-Reichenbach letter
“No.” Sherlock’s eyes didn’t leave the words they were reading. Chambers of the heart.
That night I read the letters, I knew I loved you. I waited and waited and waited for you to come back, to burst through the door, curls dripping with raindrops. Your face would be lit up with one of those rare, genuine smiles because you caught the killer and you proved your genius.
What a ruthless world we live in.
“I never did believe in any sort of afterlife…” Sherlock continues. “I guess you could say ‘I told you so’ right about now, couldn’t you?” A soft, embarrassed laugh escapes his lips.
One bed.
I hope you like John's letter! Also, thank you so much for reading my fanfic. It would make my day if you spent a second or two leaving feedback (:
You’re waking up screaming. I become the shadows. I’ve always been the shadows. You don’t see me, and I can’t help but wonder if you ever see me. You’re beautiful when you cry. Why are you beautiful? Of course you’re beautiful; You’re everything.
The woman flew through her debriefing as if she'd done it a million times. She probably had. Then, unexpectedly, she hesitated. "I will caution you, though. The majority of slaves we offer have been broken in. The slave you have chosen, 03172, has had a... shall we say unfortunate history with some of his previous owners."
John pressed his lips together, cleared his throat once more for good measure, and continued, looking up to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “I brought you this.”
For your simple, mundane, beautiful mind I will elaborate. But only for you. I want to be everything in your head. All the time. I cannot deny my unfeigned jealousy for the deserts and gunshots of Afghanistan. They plague your dreams at night, but I should be the one consuming your consciousness. Only me. I can be your bullets and guns and bloodshed and blazing sun, John. Please, let me be your sun. Then you can wake up screaming and crying and sobbing because of me and finally you will let me hold you in my arms and assure you that I am here, and I am your everything. And you are mine.
Sincerely, Your Sociopath.
Of course I’m not fine. I’ve been deteriorating, fading without you. You are my everything. You’re gone and now I’m alone, like I always was and always will be. Why is it so hard for you to just understand that I love you, John!?
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
Sherlock responded, “It’s not your fault.”
A rush of unwelcome, but involuntary pleasure rolled over John. This man sitting across from him, with his marble skin and the strangest but most endearing face, his brilliant eyes, was completely John’s. Everything about him was John's.
“…Where are we?”
“No, John. I’d like some fucking tea, alright? The man’s a slave!” Her voice began raising.
"And so you think this is okay?" John asked in disbelief, propping himself on an elbow and looking over at Sherlock.
Molly once told me I looked sad when I thought no one was watching. I guess my body betrays my mind in its ceaseless battle for control over my emotions. It’s true: I am sad. I am lonely. I am defective, and of course you would never want me and why the fucking hell had I ever convinced myself otherwise?!
John was exasperated. ”You're my property, Sherlock. I can do whatever I want with you. I don't even need a reason. Why don't you get it? Why is it so hard for you to just accept this? You're mine. You belong to me. I can't believe I've let you off so easily from the start. You're a fucking slave and nothing more."
I love you rested on John’s lips, but he didn’t dare say it. But it was true. But he couldn’t. But he had to. But he couldn’t.
"Three years ago, I was so stupid. It was, I—There were drugs, and—” Regret rang through Sherlock's words. His deep voice rumbled.
“Nothing.” I love you.
Sherlock nodded. "I guess it'll have to do... What's the matter, John?" A pause. His eyes lifted towards John, then back to the bed. Towards John once more. An 'ah' of understanding escaped his parted lips.
“Stupid question,” Sherlock mumbled.
John didn’t reply, walking into the kitchen and starting a brew.
He looked at John Watson, his hooded eyelids and reddened, greedy lips, and John Watson’s face screamed “Lust.”
“I’m quite the housekeeper.”
“Harry!” John announced.
“Let me know if you ever need anything!” the restaurant owner finished, with a final, hearty pat on Sherlock’s back.
Thunder caused our flat to convulse. Our lips met with corresponding intensity. So soon it was your calloused fingers in my hair and your sturdy hand on my waist. I gripped your shoulders and your arms like I was afraid of falling. You can’t blame me. Your tongue was in my mouth and my tongue was in your mouth and no matter how clearly I remember it, it’s still just a blur.
John waited only a heartbeat before nodding. “Fair enough.” This isn’t so strange, he assured himself. Just two blokes having to share the same bed, because they’re on a last minute work-related trip and could only get one bloody room.
Sherlock’s emotions, that John wondered if he’d even possessed at times, are spilt onto the pages in front of John’s eyes. And they are beautiful.
I’ll start with this. I love you.
I am still afraid you will leave me.
John coughed, pulled his lips together, shifted on his feet. “Scars, then… and how’d you get them?” John asked, voice tight. He bit the inside of his cheek. “I mean, they’re relatively new, obviously.”
Maybe sometimes he might. He didn’t know.
This letter is a goodbye, but I still won’t give it to you. I won’t let you read it.
"Just what?" Sherlock tilted his head and his eyes met John's, calculating. Always deducing.
John swallowed. “My father broke my arm when I was eight years old.”
And I did as best as I could. But it wasn’t good enough, because here I am, without you. This is a memory of mine, and it is dripping with sentiment, but I am not a sentimental man. Am I, though? Memories are the architecture of our identity.
I don’t understand it, and it’s driving me mad. Sod it, I’m already fucking crazy. You know that, and you are sleeping in the same flat as me. You trust me. Why? You shouldn’t trust me, I’m a sociopath.
You always were amazing me. I love you so much, Sherlock Holmes.
"No," John insisted. “No, of course I haven't. It's not like that I just—I want to see your back."
He pushes open the door. Wafting and dancing down the stairs before him in its soft beauty is music brought forth from Sherlock’s violin. Its light tune wraps around him.
(With parted lips bluing with the cold, I dedicate my last breath to you. “John.”)
When the door shut behind her, John sighed, running his hands through his short hair. “Thanks, Sherlock,” he breathed, furious with cold, empty rage. Maybe “be nice” was, in fact, a threat.
Why are you a slave, Sherlock? Why have you been treated like this? Why won’t you trust me? “Why?” John asked. “Why shouldn't I be kind to you, that is." His mouth pressed into a firm line.
"Really? I wasn't aware of my lack of possessions. Thank you for reminding me. I apologize for the inconvenience." Sarcasm rang through his words.
Secondly, these letters are not to be read. Even if you are John Watson. Stop now, and I won’t kill you. Please don’t read this, John, I don’t want to kill you. I don’t want you to leave me.
That t-shirt looked soft, so very soft. John wanted to run his fingers along it. Because it looked soft, definitely not because a still, sleeping, beautiful Sherlock was wearing it. Beautiful? He meant… platonically handsome.
"Get down on your knees. Take off your shirt," John ordered, walking back into the main room, surprised by how threatening he sounded.
John walked over to the detective, who didn’t react to John’s footfalls. The martyr who stood, turned away, as still as a statue.
(An email the killer’s brother’s electrician forgot to delete solidified that the killer would be right here, right now. So where is he? A gunshot echoes, and my question is answered.)
Would it make sense to you, John, if I told you that my new reality feels like I am playing a game I have no chance of winning? It doesn’t make much sense to me either. But everything makes sense to me.
“Playing stupid doesn’t suit you, Sherlock.”
John’s smile trembles. “I’ve missed you,” His voice cracks.
“Sherlock,” he boomed, “and John, I hope the both of you enjoyed your night. You know,” he continued, facing John, “this man got me out of a sentence of servitude, he did! I would’ve been a slave without him! Proved me innocent of murder—he’s a good man, this Sherlock.”
Something is off…
Sherlock hesitated, offering a small, polite smile. “Around.” His eyes flickered towards John as he said it.
“Well, no. I don’t think I’d like to,” Sherlock said in a mocking manner.
I was scared again, on the rooftop of St. Bart’s, I want to tell you. That’s only twice I’ve been scared now in my entire lifetime. Remember, I never felt things before you.
It didn't matter that John Watson was a good man. Sherlock Holmes needed, somehow, to hate him. If he grew at all comfortable with living here, serving the man who owned him without a second thought, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. He was stronger than this.
Sherlock's eyes widened for a split second before he followed his instruction. John had never considered himself a masochist, never even thought about it before, but God did that flash of sudden terror in Sherlock's eyes do things to him, even if it lasted only a second.
"Couch." Sherlock's answer was immediate. "I'll take the couch."
Sherlock’s laugh was a harsh, humorless thing. “Trust me, he’s got enough power to do whatever he wants. Mycroft has more power than the queen and the Parliament together. No, John, he’s still lording over me with his pitying eyes and lust for my punishment. To him, I had this coming. Maybe I did. Haven’t seen him in four years.”
He rolled his sleeves back down his forearms as subtly as possible, but John noticed, and he watched Sherlock fidget his white shirt back into place around his wrists. The detective rambled on.
Sherlock and John would have to share a bed. Sleep... in the same bed as one another. John didn't know how to feel about that. No, scratch that. He knew exactly how he felt about that.
They sat in another tension-filled silence, broken only by Sherlock's muted hisses and muffled grunts as John wrapped dressing around Sherlock's torso. His fingers brushed bare skin, and he felt more alive than he had since returning to London after the war.
I'll try to keep updating every day or so! Thank you for reading (: Halfway to the end.
“I don’t get it,” John said.
“Is there something wrong?” John asked. Sherlock stared. “I’m sorry,” John continued, mumbling. “Everything’s wrong, isn’t it? I meant, is there something wrong with Angelo’s?”
And John, oh how I feel. I feel hatred, and loathing—for myself, who can never be normal for you—and anger, and jealousy, and betrayal—why do you love her?—and love, and such longing and yearning for something that never could have been. Why couldn’t it have been?
I can’t take your narrowed, calculating glare, so I stand up and move to the window, choosing rather to gaze at the narrow street instead of your winsome face. This way, it might hurt less, your visit.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and fell back against the chair he sat in, exasperated. “Of course you wouldn’t. Righteous John Watson,” he mocked. “No matter what’s going through you’re head right now, I can tell you that it’ll happen eventually. I’d bet anything on it. You’re all the same.”
Sherlock’s terse nod was a beat too late.
John Watson reads the letters
Sherlock stumbled a few steps backward, overwhelmed by the sheer force of John's impact. Relief and disgust swarmed through John's mind with two simple thoughts. The first: maybe he did have it in him to own a slave and teach him his place. The second: he would never allow himself to become that sort of man. “I am so sorry,” he choked out.
Empathy swallowed John whole. Where was that empathy yesterday? John’s subconscious barked at itself.
And I am undeniably, uncontrollably, infinitely in love with you.
Hi Everyone. Thank you for spending the time to read my fic.
John lay still under his bedsheets. He tried to sleep, but sleep deceived him. Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock’s pleading eyes. John’s body racked with silent sobs. His life was becoming a horrific cycle: fall into a rhythmic normal with Sherlock, become high on the power of control, do something devastating to the man whose trust he was gaining, and shatter everything, beg for forgiveness, possibly and fragilely fall into a new rhythmic normal with Sherlock. Rinse. Repeat.
You see, Sherlock, if I just followed you out into the rain… if I stayed along your side like I always should have… if I just kept you from chasing the bastard down and convinced you to stay with me, you’d be sitting across from me on your chair. You might be playing me your violin and I would be grinning like an idiot because I love you.
The two left, and the walk home was still cold, but something about it was warm.
Calloused hands moved smoothly over Sherlock's thighs and hips and stomach and brushed over his nipples. Flashes of memories swamped Sherlock’s mind. His breathing picked up with the panic that crowded his senses. Control yourself, Sherlock told himself. You're stronger than this. You've dealt with worse... But this was John doing this to him, and somehow that made it so much worse.
John writes a letter back
"Even if I could cook something decent—which, actually, I can—there’s no way in hell I'd cook for you. And what are you going to do about it? Nothing." Sherlock leaned back into his chair with a smug look plastered across his face.. "The way you just ordered me, someone might think I was your slave."
"Obviously not," the slave replied.
Still, Sherlock’s low groans quickened to short gasps of sticky air. John came on him, cursing, and a few pumps later Sherlock was quick to follow. They caught their breaths in the dim London flat.
Sherlock only nodded. John's hands and wrists were rubbed raw by ceaseless washing, Sherlock noticed. Had they been coloured with Sherlock’s blood? More than likely. His head hung, just slightly. The crop itself was haphazardly hidden under the couch, where it had most likely been kicked. Still in the middle of the room was a pattern of small drops of blood in the carpet.
In the middle of the night, when I can’t sleep (which is usually) I’ll whisper apologies to you. I’ll breath my regrets to you. I’ll murmur stories and memories under my breath to nothing but the thought of you. If Mary hears, she says nothing.
"Sherlock."
He flipped up his collar on his way back—along crisp London sidewalks—and he considered walking to 221B Baker Street and walking past it and not turning around. But he stopped and walked into the flat and he waited for John to get home.
“Then stop looking,” is all I say.
John got up, uncomfortable with the path his mind was taking. He walked into the sitting room feeling anxious. Would everything be different between them now, after the intimacy of last night?
Sherlock was silent but for the soft sounds of his inhale, his exhale.
He’s reaching for his cup of tea, and doesn’t care in the least that it’s cold. As he sips, John’s eyes are drawn to the window. Ivy. John thinks. Our flat would look beautiful with ivy. Our flat. And then he remembers Mary, and how this is Sherlock’s flat, now. Just Sherlock’s.
But I would have been better, I think.
“How was your, uh, your lunch with Mark?” Sherlock asked.
John gripped the base of the riding crop, brining it down onto Sherlock's back with a deafening snap. He shouldn't enjoy doing this. Thwack. This was so wrong. Thwack. Thwack. Jesus Christ, what was he turning into? Crack. A monster. Sherlock leaned forward onto the heels of his hands from the force of the whip. His back dripped thin streams of blood onto the flat’s tattered rug, and his eyes stung. It took every ounce of self-control to keep from shouting, from screaming, from turning on John Watson and slamming him into the wall.
"It's raining," he said plainly.
Your face slackens.
Sherlock loves him.
Anticipated.
One last thing before I begin: I am a sociopath. I love you. I am a walking contradiction, and I perplex even myself.
John catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror over the mantel, and he isn’t old and wrinkled and grey. No, John Watson can barely be forty. He’s the same age he was during the years he spent with Sherlock, wearing his favourite sandstone-coloured jumper he had lost years ago.
"Do you mind?" John stood.
“Mike?”
When the two were finished and satisfied with their plates of pasta, ready to leave, Angelo came over and slung a merry hand down on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Are they everything you imagined?” Sherlock spat.
I've already got the next couple chapters all typed up and edited, so I'll update soon!
Sherlock slept in John’s room most nights now, all nights now. He woke up in John’s bed in the mornings. John had offered to clean out the room of junk and storage upstairs, but Sherlock had said, “There’s not much of a point, is there?” John figured he was right.
When they got back into the flat, Sherlock was being crushed with the need of an answer. “Why?” his voice cracked, but only oh so slightly.
“Sherlock,” John groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Just show me your fucking back, alright?”
All I desire is a second chance at life with you, Sherlock Holmes. I miss your brilliance.
“I’d rather not, thank you,” Sherlock snapped. “It doesn’t matter.”
John’s mouth lowered to the black scrawls of ink that stood in stark contrast to the slave’s near-translucent skin. He began sucking and nipping at them, tracing the numbers with his tongue and breath, ghosting them with his teeth.
A few days passed without incident. Quiet exchanges of meaningless statements, a substantial lack of orders on John's part, and the frustrating, exasperating, defiant attitude Sherlock would not repress. The sky was quiet and overcast, and grey London rain drizzled against the window panes, creating rivulets, minute waterfalls, and liquid roads. The two worked around each other's presence in silence, emitting the polite exchange of 'good morning, Sherlock’ and the hissed 'good morning, Sir.'
John tried words on his tongue, “I… That was… I mean…” and he decided on, “You should probably get yourself cleaned up.”
“Often,” Sherlock continued. “When it was happening.”
John looked up in surprise. “What, are you to busy?” he snapped, eyes wide and challenging.
Angelo’s thick arms wrapped around Sherlock’s lanky frame in a quick embrace. “I haven’t seen you in a few years! Where you been?”
“It’s been alright,” She said. Her eyes flickered around the flat, taking everything in. Then they widened. “You’ve got a slave, John?”
“This concerns me in what way?” Sherlock snapped, looking up from the medical textbook he held open in his lap.
Seconds passed.
John pulled back his hand and allowed himself to readjust a bit. He curled over onto his side: uncomfortable. Tried the other: bothered his shoulder. He stretched out a bit: no, too risky he’d touch Sherlock in his sleep. Curled to one side again—
John got a job at the surgery; Sherlock lounged around at the flat, and on rare occasions he followed John shopping or to work or other mundane, tedious chores of the sort. He hated people—people staring at the numbers on his neck with such disgust one might think they were contagious. John pretended not to notice. Sherlock continuously baited John, waiting for the switch to flip in his mind. It would happen, he reminded himself whenever John shot him a smile, whenever Sherlock became too comfortable. It would happen, and Sherlock would mean nothing whatsoever to John Watson. Sooner was better than later. Don't get attached. You will mean nothing to John, and John will mean everything to you. Caring is not an advantage.
So John steps up to the door and wraps his fingers around the knocker. That’s when he notices that his hand is not mapped and layered with crevices of wrinkles and frail, papery skin. No, it’s calloused and tough and his fingers are those of a doctor’s. John bites his cheek, tilts his head, and furrows his eyebrows. This is… odd.
With some difficulty, Sherlock relaxed into John's touch.
But then I remember that I am a sociopath incapable of feeling afraid.
Sherlock froze before he realized that John was fast asleep.
A hesitation. “No, of course not, Sherlock. Of course not.”
John jumped in his chair and looked up from the book he was reading to see Sherlock standing next to him. It would take him a while to get used to having another person around. “I… I guess I haven't thought about it."
An overpowering urge to dominate—to control—the man in front of him flooded over John Watson. Christ, this was embarrassing. Sherlock was his property, goddammit. Why couldn't he just follow the blasted rules? Two could play this game. Without even realizing his actions, John's fist flew up to connect with the slave's jaw. The second it happened, John’s eyes widened. “I’m sorry, I-I didn’t…” he trailed off.
"Maybe."
John was startled by the deep, ringing baritone of the man's voice. God, it was nearly sinful just hearing it. He cleared his throat before trying again. “A real name."
"I put a blanket and a pillow on the couch,”  John growled. He turned towards the bedroom. He hadn’t sounded defeated; he’d sounded determined.
Dear John Watson—
Soft t-shirt…
"Why?" sherlock demanded when John returned. "Why are you doing this? Any of this?” His tone was openly accusing. “You’re not supposed to be helping me. Come on and just get it over with. Beat me or rape me or—” Sherlock’s strong voice faltered, minutely. “It’s boring, the way you all prolong the inevitable. The way you all pretend we might be friends at first. You’re an ex-military doctor, I know that by now. You’re clearly uncomfortable with slavery, but that won’t matter. It’s laughable the way you’re acting towards me, hoping the burden that will unavoidably weigh on your conscious will be lessened—tedious things, consciouses, I could imagine.”
“I thought about you when you were gone,” John murmured. He lifted his left hand and set it, warm, against the bare skin of Sherlock’s side. He could feel the man’s ribs under his palm.
"I know."
"You've got a violin," Sherlock uttered suddenly, disgusted with how weak his voice sounded. He just needed to say something—anything—to get John to do something other than what he was doing now.
“No. Yes.” John tensed. “I don’t know, Sherlock. I am sorry. I am so sorry. I know a… a bloody coat doesn’t change anything, okay? I know that. A coat’s not going to fix this.”
He walked past John, straight to the window, where he pulled back the sheer curtain and looked out over the street.
"You've got it the wrong way around, Dr. Watson, Sir. I am the slave. I take care of you, do whatever pleases you, and whatever you bid me to do. I know you were drawn to me immediately upon seeing me, but the question is why? The rest of them, they made you uneasy. Too used perhaps—too broken? But I, I was still my own person. What I've already endured couldn't break me down, and maybe you won't be able to either. You saw that, chose me, and here we are. I want to know if I am your challenge. I don’t know what your strategy is, but I am not one easily broken. You've been kind to me, regarding the moment when we first arrived. You shouldn't be.”
After a great amount of alcohol consumption and telly-watching and obnoxious cheering, eyes began shifting towards Sherlock more frequently. Sherlock tried his hardest to blend into the walls, but he could only do so much.
“I thought you might like wearing it… you know…” John cut in, eyes glancing towards Sherlock’s neck. “And the colour—“ John paused. “Suits you.” He rubbed the back of his neck.
Also--because of this chapter and the chapters I'm planning to have follow, I've raised this fic from Teen and Up to Mature audiences. Have fun ;)
The flat was warm when they got back; lights accidentally left on welcomed them home. John watched Sherlock slide his scarf off his neck, and his coat off his shoulders. John watched him hang them up and watched him pause.
I never acted upon my feelings, because maybe you were rubbing off on me. You and your walls of unbreakable cement and stone. You bury your every emotion. Now, though, I know that you felt more than maybe anyone ever has. But neither of us had what—the guts?—to do something about anything. That is my biggest regret.
Sherlock only blinked and nodded. “You’re all sorry at first,” he said, but there was no bite behind his words.
John rubbed his eyes, sitting up and wincing as he remembered what had happened the night before, as he remembered the adrenaline that seared through his veins along with that shocking feeling of control, as he remembered Sherlock kneeling on the floor, bloodied and beaten and still anything but broken. After it was over, John felt like the broken one, but the bewitching feeling of power he felt in that moment wouldn’t be driven from his mind.
I lie to myself. I lie to myself. I lie to everyone. Even you, John.
Sherlock hummed a flat note in response.
And somehow, Sherlock’s head rested against John’s neck, and John’s arm rested around Sherlock’s shoulder, and their feet and calves found themselves woven together.
“Moriarty’s men. I’d found myself in compromising positions over the past few years while dismantling his network.”
Sherlock scoffed and closed his eyes.
John looked down, shifted on his feet, and looked up again. “I’m sorry.” There. He’d said it.
"Well, yeah a bit. You shouldn't be talking to me like that." He rummaged through his dresser, having unpacked earlier.
He invaded Sherlock’s mouth with his own, unrelenting. Sherlock began kissing back, but stopped. He had an intimate relationship with dominance, and he knew that it wasn’t his to have.
John nodded, forgetting that the room was dark. Pitch black. His voice was hesitant, wary, “So you don’t mind if…” John rolled over to Sherlock. Slowly and cautiously. He slid a hand across Sherlock’s lean stomach, curling at his hip. He rested his head on Sherlock’s chest. Because his t-shirt was soft, of course. That was why.
But they were cuddling in the same bed. Surely that meant something.
John leaned back in his chair, nodding. "All right then." It didn't bother him that Sherlock wanted to sleep on the couch. Why should it? It didn't bother him one bit. Not at all. "You'll be needing me to get you something to sleep in."
John stepped up to Sherlock, leaning his forehead against the slave's back. He slid his hands from Sherlock’s waist to his hips. This isn't wrong. John tried to convince himself, but the awful nagging sensation in the back of his skull persisted.
Hello, readers!
By the end of the second letter, John’s blue eyes are dark and wet and glistening with unshed tears.
“Would you just lie still?” Sherlock whispered.
John rocked forward on his feet, walked around the table between them, and took one of Sherlock’s hands in his own. Sherlock watched him carefully, face expressionless, and John’s deft doctor’s fingers traced the marred skin of the detective’s pale wrist.
“Sherlock, what is going on?” John shouted. “Give me the gun!”
"Tell me exactly why you did it."
It was all clear to you then, that I had heard. Naturally. Your observation skills are much more developed than I give you credit for; you are always surprising me.
You confuse me.
You lick your lips, “Sherlock, I—“
I hum in response. Why are you here, John? Shouldn’t you be with Mary? Your expecting wife? This is odd. We haven’t seen each other in weeks now. I wonder what you’ve been doing—if you’ve been getting into enough trouble.
I don’t know how to start.
“You’ve been there, haven’t you?” John’s question seemed more of a statement. “Angelo’s?”
I am a creature of darkness and dust. Without you.
Sometimes you could be thinking one thing and feeling another.
Too late now. You hesitated. “Yes…” I whisper, eyes widening. “Yes, she did! I knew it.” My voice raises, and I can’t help but throw my hands up for emphasis.
“Something of the sort.” Sherlock slid his hands into his coat pockets, contemplating. “A consulting detective, actually. The world’s only.”
I know it wasn’t your choice. I know I shouldn’t have left you for Mary. I know I made you suffer, and I am more sorry for that than for anything I have done in my life, and I have killed men, I’ll let you know.
Sherlock’s arms were wrapped around John’s, gripping his shoulder blades. He felt a trace of something, a scar? He couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter. One of John’s hands worked between Sherlock’s legs and the other moved to hold Sherlock’s chin, to tilt his head up against the wall and expose his neck.
The man was tall and undeniably thin, clad in the simple gray trousers and shirt that all slaves wore. His pale limbs would have been gangly and awkward, if he were not to hold himself with such elegance. His head was up, chin tilted and eyes calculating. God, he had wonderful eyes. He couldn't have been a slave for long, John thought. Standing like that? No, he wouldn’t have lasted. John wouldn't have even been able to tell if the man was a slave if it weren't for the numbers tattooed along the his neck, forming a sequence of five from his ear to his shoulder—the numbers and, well, the fact that John was in a position to own him.
Sherlock was standing next to the kitchen table, lab set up around him, when John walked into 221B. Sherlock looked up and flashed him a brilliant smile, catching John off guard—John who had gotten used to a quiet and sullen Sherlock since his return after the fall.
By the time John re-entered the room, Sherlock was pajama-clad and under the hotel duvet. Sherlock never slept. Why start now? The question was burning a hole through the back of John’s head. “Sherlock?”
Okay, he breathed a little, but barely. He was strangely, incredibly nervous. Nervous anticipation? Of what? No. No, he was not anticipating anything while sharing a bed with Sherlock.
Sherlock had to arrange the words he wanted to say before he spoke them out loud. “My brother knew I was an addict. He was a few years older, annoyed at my ‘childish’ behavior. He helped me get better at first, promised he’d fix it, I was only… fifteen or so when I started. I got clean, got to uni, and got caught up in the same deals again.”
“Neither am I,” Sherlock agreed. I love you, too.
“Right, Mike, how was that?”
Tender.
John's lips were warm pressed against the nape of Sherlock's neck.
He could spend hours, maybe days, wandering its corridors and basements—but not weeks. He couldn’t spend this new lifetime cooped up with his thoughts. Sherlock needed to breath. He didn’t know what he needed. It was illogical.
“Yes, John. I was thinking.”
Dear John Watson—
A harsh laugh escaped Sherlocks lips. "You most certainly do not."
John's hand curled into a fist. Punch me, Sherlock silently willed. Punch me, so I can hate you.
John, again, was thrown for a loop. He didn’t remember telling Sherlock about the lunch, or maybe he just hadn’t expected Sherlock to retain any of their mundane conversation.
The steps he takes are not an old man’s wobbly and weak gait. They’re strong again, like they were when he was younger. Each stair brings him closer to the dusty light glimmering through the door to their flat, cracked open just so.
“And… Mary? She’s well?”
“Why do you trust me?” John asked, voice straining.
"Get a shower," was all John said. "I'm not dealing with those if they get infected."
Sherlock stood up, stepping over towards Harry and John. “You’re John’s older sister, Harriet Watson, obviously. Just out of rehab for being an alcoholic, the initial decision for going there begin almost entirely made by John and your boyfriend. You were not very happy about it, at all. The two of you haven’t seen each other for at least a year and a half, after you went to rehab. Your boyfriend just recently broke up with you, too. My condolences,” Sherlock listed, snarling.
“Sherlock!” Angelo’s Italian accent boomed as he neared them, smile spreading across his face.
One of the men left, leaving John, Jerry, the wolfish one, and the short one.
The sound of their breathing—heavy and hot and wanting—seemed to echo in the stillness of the flat. John ground his lips along Sherlock’s jaw. His fingers slid down the slave’s torso and over the front of his trousers. Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath was followed by a harsh groan as John grabbed his length through the fabric, kneading the growing bulge.
This time he went too far, John knew that for sure. Would there be an adapted normal waiting tomorrow? Probably not, because John Watson went too fucking far and he knew it.
I think, if you came back to me that night, I would have kissed you like I did once so long ago. I would have told Mary that I love you and Mary would have understood.
“You want to… talk about it,” Sherlock speculated, eyes calculating.
“It was… yeah, it was good to catch up,” he said.
"I wish you wouldn't trust me," John said.
The cab ride home was crackling with tension and silence. Sherlock’s lips were bruised and swollen and his throat raw. John’s lips were pursed and his fingers drummed on his thigh.
Sherlock took a deep breath, wincing at the strain it put on his wounded back, and slid into the pajamas. He stepped out into the hallway. John nodded at him. "Alright then. I'm heading to bed. Need anything?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“No!” He lifted his hands into the air, gesticulating for emphasis. “Just be nice.”
Not now. Now you, I, our surroundings, we’re burning with the fluorescence of three billion bulbs. It’s enthralling, but you don’t seem to notice.
When the host was out of earshot, Sherlock spoke quickly. “I’m sorry. I should’ve said something.”
John looked down and cleared his throat. Sherlock was trying guilt out for a go, reminding John of what he’d done, reminding John of Sherlock’s status and the wrongness of slavery. “Would you show me your back, Sherlock?” he asked, looking up.
“Well, yes,” John started. “It was the dead woman at the club. She—“
John stilled. “You were asleep…”
(You aren’t here alongside me in the London streets, you wouldn’t come with me, you didn’t choose me. I should obstruct you from invading my mind. I am on a case. I am on a case.)
I miss your eyes. When I was with Mary, you were always closing them, as if it hurt to look at things. I should have noticed then, but I was so blatantly oblivious. Nowadays, every detail of you clouds my brain cells. That face you made when you heard of an interesting case or the one you’d make when I was so frustratingly ordinary or when nobody understood the intelligent jumble spilling from your lips.
John ate breakfast, then Sherlock ate breakfast. John showered, then Sherlock showered. They were developing a routine. Maybe John could get used to it. Sherlock couldn't.
“I thought I’d stop by,” you smile, sitting down into your old chair with a good-natured huff.
Your lips tighten in annoyance. Please forgive me if I don’t talk much at times, John. It’s loud enough in my head.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. They met John’s, pleading.
I read once, I don’t know when—sometime in my childhood, “First we feel. Then we fall.” James Joyce, I think. I found it tucked away in the dusty corners of my mind. Astonishingly suiting to our situation. My side of it anyway, because I never felt anything at all my whole life. Nothing but the meaningless high of narcotics or the lonely superiority that comes as a package deal with a mind such as mine. Then I met you, you met me, and I could finally see in colour.
I’ll start here.
Soft.
And later that night, when some of John’s rugby buddies also seemed to think Sherlock was ‘quite the looker’ at a soccer watching, beer drinking men’s night, John didn’t feel a shred of guilt when he let them ‘mess around a bit.’
“What was that all about?” John asked, tilting his head towards Sherlock.
What a shattered life this is.
(The wind is cold and the pelting raindrops sting. They’re the reason my eyes are watering, obviously. Because I am a man of fading emotions. So soon, without you, I won’t be anything but machinery once again.)
My thoughts were foggy and clouded with you, and they destroyed my judgment. They stomped on and crushed my logic mercilessly. I was drunk from the scent of your skin and the rhythm of your heartbeat. I was too far gone to remember that I am one who can never be loved in return.
John could hear Sherlock’s voice through his chest. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
John had trouble maintaining eye contact. “Yes,” he breathed.
"You understand that this, John Watson, is an honour? This is a reward for your service to our country."
Sherlock exhaled through his nose, slowly. “God is a construct created by desperate sinners, so no.” His eyes opened, languid. “Do you, John Watson?”
I hope you enjoy it! Please comment, critique, or review.
He imagined Sherlock roughed up and on his knees, arms spread wide, chained in each direction. He imagined blood trailing from Sherlock’s wrists down his arms, down his body. He imagined Sherlock’s captors: brutish, burly men with sinister faces, faces that laughed as they pressed their burning cigarettes to Sherlock’s skin and laughed as Sherlock tried not to hiss through gritted teeth.
“Try it on,” John said.
Choose from the ten or so men and women standing in a line facing him? John couldn't make himself do it. He'd never been okay with slavery, as socially accepted as it was. He wasn’t some crazy abolitionist, but his family never owned slaves growing up. He could never own another person. The mere thought brought bile rising up his throat.
John reached for the phone, and his eyes caught on a raised, rough band of pink skin that stuck out against the detective’s pale wrist. He noticed a trail of harsh, round marks that made their way up the soft skin of his arm.
"No," John said slowly, drawing out the vowel. "I won't. I can't treat someone like this." He wiped the dried blood off of the slave's back, proceeding to clean the wounds. The infected cuts made his stomach churn.
Sherlock continued staring into John's eyes; he considered it a sort of experiment. How far could he push this new master of his? He might as well test it out the water. His new owner had obviously never owned a slave prior to Sherlock, himself. This would be effortless.
But Mary doesn’t matter, in this second. Not after revelation. Because Sherlock… oh, Sherlock. Sherlock means everything to John Watson.
Oh, but I am, John Watson, and you let me. But then a madman—not me, another—shattered and ravaged our life. At first I was beguiled by his mind. He thought like me and nobody thinks like me and naturally I had to know why. Curiosity is the devil. So I played his game. I dragged you into his game. We lost together.
Maybe not.
Another way to murder someone: kiss them once and never again.
Sherlock opened his mouth,
Sherlock maintained his now-neutral demeanor, looked at John, said, “Yes, I guess you could call it that.”
Reading the first letter, John was in awe. And then—and then he felt his heart torn from the cavity of his chest. The third letter is guilt and regret and remorse. Take the factors, and multiply them by one thousand. John presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and takes a deep, quivering breath.
I love you.
The reply was blunt. "03172."
“Is that so?” John’s voice lilted in a smile. “Tell me what that might mean.”
Only John had that sort of power over him.
“That bet,” Sherlock began quietly, voice a hollow, ringing triumph. “I win.”
“What about you, John Watson? What’s the sob story of poor army veteran?”
"Surely you can't be that bothered by such sleeping conditions for a single night. You were an army soldier, John."
John nodded, turning towards the woman standing next to him. "Alright, then." He cleared his throat awkwardly. "That one." He gestured towards the man that had so curiously caught his attention. He sniffed. ”Do I get any instruction? An explanation? Or is this…? I just… take him home.”
The day dragged on and on and on. Sherlock couldn’t decide if he was anxiously awaiting John, dreading John, excited for John to get home or something else entirely. His head hurt. Damned emotions.
John's eyes flitted across the expanse of exposed white chest. The little voice in the back of his head rang through his thoughts. Why not now? What's stopping you now? It's not that wrong, really. He is your property. It's not like this hasn't happened to him before. He's completely used to it.
“Obviously,” I say, voice wary.
John raised an amused eyebrow, noticing how Sherlock quite resembled a puppy at the moment. “So there were drugs involved?”
John ignored it. “I sure as bloody hell can. Now get up.”
WARNING: non-con and Slavelock are both triggers, so please don't read if you don't like
Mary is dependable, sweet, charming, domestic, and normal. Everything I never could be. Mary is adventurous, dangerous, thrilling, and intelligent. Everything I know you can’t live without. Mary is not life-threatening, a sociopath, obsessive, rude, obnoxious, a freak, incapable, or inexperienced. I am. It’s simple. I should’ve known all along that it never would have been me.
“Obviously,” Sherlock deadpanned.
“Got yourself a slave, eh?” One of them asked, something more than curiosity flickering through wolfish eyes. John explained the army deal.
“Alright,” you nod, egging on the conversation. You can’t deny the cumbersome tension that pulses and circulates through the flat around us. “So how’re you? How’ve you been?”
Sherlock rose, suppressing the urge to make any sort of noise as a deep, throbbing raked down his back. He met John's eyes defiantly. They used to be oddly warm, and now they were dark with something that arose goosebumps along Sherlock’s exposed flesh. The flip had finally switched. John Watson, caring army doctor, was gone. John Watson, slave owner, had made his inevitable entrance, his grand opening. Sherlock knew it would happen; he was still surprised.
“So this is why you’re so excited all of a sudden,” John said, corner of his mouth tilting upward. “It isn’t decent.”
The slave hesitated.
“My girlfriend,” Harry hissed. “I’m gonna go, John,” She remarked quickly, turning towards the doorway. “Nice seeing you.”
‘Dear John Watson,’ it begins…
Why? Your kind, naive mind asks. (I know it does.) Because I love you. Because you chose her.
You open your thin lips to defend yourself, but nothing comes out.
The problem with “It won’t happen again” is that it kept happening.
I know I am selfish, but I think you would have been good for me, too. You already were. Now that you’re gone again, do you suppose I’ll get worse?
John stepped over to the man at the window. If Sherlock had noticed by now, he'd decided to ignore the approach, keeping his back turned towards John and his eyes fixed out at the rain. Sherlock's Adam's apple bobbed. Of course he knew John was behind him. John was once in the army, but that didn't mean he'd ever been stealthy.
Sherlock lifted his hands from John’s and began unbuttoning his white shirt. John watched, not knowing what he was feeling. Shame, maybe. Guilt or sorrow.
Sincerely, Your Sociopath.
John scoffed. “I thought you’d been bloody shot, Sherlock, you idiot.” And his voice was the temperature of morning tea.
Dear Sherlock,
Still, he hated John Watson.
“Say it,” John repeated, and kissed him gentler, persuading.
The man released his grip on Sherlock, breaking the kiss with a sloppy smack. Sherlock shot fervent glances towards John, silently willing him to put an end to this. John seemed checked out. Not paying too close of attention, not participating, but still the reason any of this was happening. The slave could see not only wolf man’s pants beginning to tent, but the other two men’s as well.
I’m sitting in my own chair, naturally, and staring at the ceiling. “I see that.”
Sherlock reached into the bag again. It was a Belstaff coat. He swallowed. “Is this an apology?”
John’s left hand slid from Sherlock side and across his torso to rest at his chest. His right hand wrapped around Sherlock’s stomach. John pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s back.
He pulled out a midnight blue scarf and then set it on the side table.
And when he stopped, Sherlock asked, “Why?”
Sherlock's words were rigid. "So you've changed your mind then." His fingers began jerking once more at the buttons of his grey shirt.
“…you thought?”
John Watson
“So… you were some sort of detective? Private investigator?” John’s words were clean and curious.
Sherlock glanced up, holding her gaze.
His movements were powerful and graceful and elegant. Long sweeps of the bow caressed the strings, pouring out a beautiful melody into the room. Flooding the room. As the piece got louder, John decided this wasn't a sad song. It was a tragic song. A heartbreaking, terrible, beautiful song, and he hadn’t known music even held the capacity to sound like this. Now he did.
“That’s exactly how it is,” I manage. “I haven’t seen you in weeks, John. Months, even.”
Sherlock Holmes
Tangled opposites and tangled ivy. I want to tangle our bodies. I want to be wrapped in you. You, everywhere. I could wear your skin like a coat; I think I would like that. I would ask you, but you’d say no, and I’d kill you if I skinned you.
John’s forehead creased, and his eyes narrowed. ”No—No, that is not how it is.” He sat himself down on the cushion next to the slave. “I’m taking care of you. It’s my responsibility.”
What were the day's plans? John asked himself. There weren't any, he was quick to decide. Today, it was only Sherlock and him sitting in the dreary flat. Bored out of their minds, no doubt. What could be done about that... John's eyes remained glued on Sherlock as the man stared out the window.
Sherlock's gaze was challenging, and John couldn't take it anymore. He hurried to the hallway cupboard, grabbing the duffel he'd thrown in their first night back. He hadn't wanted to look inside at the time, and so it remained unmoved. Now things were different. He shuffled through the contents, teeth gritted. Handcuffs, a second gray uniform, dear lord was that a collar? There, the riding crop.
Sherlock’s new scarf twisted around his neck, successfully hiding the only thing distinguishing himself from the free public. 03172. The taller man’s new coat fit neatly, and John couldn’t help but feel like something—albeit small—something was finally going right as they strode down the sidewalk. Sherlock strode actually. John… trotted alongside.
There it was again, the kindness. It could end now or later, and later would ultimately turn out to be more painful. "Why should I think for one second that you'd give me anything I need?" His words were calm and biting. "You think you're so good, treating me like the human I would have been, had my life gone differently. You think I appreciate it. I would fucking appreciate being free, but you can't give me that, can you? You can get rid of me, sure, but it's not your place to set me free." Sherlock tilted his head just slightly, knowing the numbers tattooed on his neck would catch the dim hallway light. "No, I need nothing you could possibly give me. Self-satisfied, insufferable, bastard.”
The first time: It occurred to me that you might someday leave me.
“…what else?” asked John.
I can’t come to see Mary and you, John. I’m leaving you—giving you up—to your life of normalcy. I refuse to intrude and destroy this time. It isn’t your fault, either, John. It’s mine. Always mine. If you were your story, sometimes I might be the villain…
Ambulance and police sirens are soft and muted behind the windows of the flat. The faded blues and reds aren’t even noticed by John Watson, who sits in a haze of euphoria, waiting for the moment Sherlock Holmes comes crashing through the front door. The moment John can tell him the only honest truth in the world. Sherlock, I love you, he is planning to say.
Harriet’s mouth gaped, and red coloured her cheeks. “How—“ She turned to John.
“And they’re addressed to me…” you continue.
"You were having a nightmare."
You need me, too. You’re fascinated by me. I took away your limp and you’ve been intrigued ever since. I’m afraid I’ll scare you away.
Panting, they pulled down trousers and pants. John hissed through clenched teeth when their cocks rubbed against one another, throbbing and hot. He gripped them with one hand, pinned Sherlock’s wrists with the other, and jerked his hips in heady thrusts.
Could he hate John Watson?
“A threat?”
Sherlock attempted to pry himself away, but John's grip on his hips tightened. "There's a violin case against the wall," he managed.
It means so much to me!
“What are you thinking about?” Sherlock murmured.
John rolled onto his back, sighing. "I don't know anymore, Sherlock. I just don't know." He waited a moment. "Is your back.. does it-"
A sigh. “No, you really don’t.”
Sherlock scoffed. "Hardly."
The words say everything. John begins the first letter warily, but soon his eyes fly across the paper. The ink tells him everything he’s never known. The smudges answer the questions that have burned and smoldered in his mind since the very beginning, since ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’
He hung his head, deep in thought, hands gripping the sink basin to hold himself up. "Sherlock?" John called from the hallway, jolting him out of his thoughts.
There, just before him, is the door to 221B. He hasn’t been here in decades, and it’s exactly as he has remembered it. If only—if only Sherlock was still here with him. Sherlock Holmes who’s been dead for years. Sherlock Holmes who John has missed his entire life.
I don’t know why I love you and that is the most incomprehensible and infuriating obstacle I have ever encountered.
John opens the final barrier separating him from the man he knows will be standing on the other side of the door. And he is.
"You can stop. Nothing can help me, let alone a disabled army doctor with a psychosomatic limp, disturbed mental state, lack of leadership skills he was so sure he possessed, with nobody to call a friend or close family, currently unemployed and constantly worrying about his financial state.”
I want you to know another thing. A desire of yours has come true, remember when you wrote about it? You wanted to be my nightmares. Now you are. I wake screaming because your corpse is bleeding out before my eyes. I wake sobbing in harmony to the haunting tune of your empty violin melody that only I can hear at three in the morning.
“Gottfried?” John interrupted.
The letters come with an epiphany of sorts, clear as day. John Watson knows now that he loves Sherlock Holmes. He always has.
“Good, just fine.” He couldn’t keep the smile from his face. “I haven’t seen you in forever! How’s—” John took a deep breath. “How’s rehab been?”
“What do you mean?”
Minutes later, John heard the bathroom door click shut. He swiveled. He hadn’t even heard Sherlock walk away.
I had no choice.
John would be fucking him, and Sherlock would want, simultaneously, to tell him to stop, to push him away, and to pull him closer and tell him he never wanted it to end. Emotions, Sherlock decided, were not his area.
"No, stop," John said quickly.
John nodded once.
If Doctor John Watson knew anything at all, if he knew just one simple fact, it was that he had to set this right.
John leaned back, wary. “What do you mean?”
Now, half of him felt guilty and heavy with a strange foreign shame, and the other half told that half to shut up and get over it. This is how things are now, it said.
John cleared his throat a bit. “Well… good night then, Sherlock.” Don’t leave me.
"Yes."
He trails his fingertips along the wallpaper. As he leans onto the final stair, the wood beneath him creaks, and the violin halts on a ringing note.
Sometimes it helps, usually it doesn’t.
John moved a hand against Sherlock’s waist, and the slave stepped back, pressed against the wall. His lips moved against John’s lips, hungry, eager. His tongue felt John’s and a heavy breath escaped his lungs. So John, kissing Sherlock, tugged the slave’s shirt from his trousers and slid his hand against the warm skin of his back and his ribs.
Rain hit the taxi roof as John cabbed home from the hospital; he got out of the car and heard gunshots. Sherlock.
Sherlock came out of the bathroom, curls dripping water down his neck.
“I don’t know.” John’s voice was stern. “You’re a slave, aren’t you? Didn’t you tell me you needed to keep reminding yourself that? So you can fight your own little battle inside, knowing it won’t change anything?”
“Remember last night, John?” he fired, hands busy with the microscope in front of him.
Pretty bloody awkward.
“Fine,” John finished.
Sherlock didn't acknowledge the order, but began anyway. The music started softly, harmonizing with the pattering of raindrops. It was a sad song, no doubt. Something John had never heard before. Had Sherlock created it himself? Just now? He watched Sherlock close his eyes as he played.
She grinned. “John. How’ve you been?”
Footsteps thud thud thud up the stairs past the door of our flat. I know in the slightest fraction of a second that they are yours. I would recognize your steps anywhere.
John stared at Sherlock, shirtless, kneeling in front of him. He couldn't deny that Sherlock, well fed and healthier-looking, was bloody attractive. His eyes traced the scars of welts and words covering the white expanse of leanly muscled back. Never would he have thought that he'd be adding to the collection, but now it seemed like the only logical thing to do. The only desirable thing to do. A sick realization clouded his mind as the voice in his head screamed that this was what John wanted all along.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Of course not. They’ve forced me to have sex with them." The slave’s answer was as straightforward as he had presented himself the entire day, but John noticed his shoulders tighten and jaw muscles tense. His eyes looked, just for a fleeting second, so vulnerable. The moment passed. “Beaten me, maybe, too. When they felt like it. That was always such an enamoring pastime. ”
“He was furious; I was furious and young and stupid. I got it figured out for myself for a while, until I didn’t. He knew when I became indentured. He knew when I was given these tattoos, when I got my first master,” Sherlock spat the last word. “He could’ve fixed it, and he didn’t do a thing.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I was saying, we only need to get her purse and we can tell if the drug was ever in her possession before she was killed.”
(You attempt to stitch yourself into my life, but can’t you understand that all you’re doing is fraying ripped seams? The rain chills its way through me, would be freezing my heart had that vital part of my anatomy not already been destroyed.)
Sherlock stands staring. “John,” he whispers. “What took you so long?”
I sat in our flat that night. The night when… when you left. The night I read your letters and I realized how much of my life I’ve lived wrong, because Sherlock, I love you.
The next morning Sherlock woke up in John’s bed, one of the man’s arms resting on his chest. Bruises along his hips were blue-green with the memory of John’s fingertips. The melody Sherlock composed on his violin later that day was blue-green, as well, and John hummed along, and that tugged a small smile out of Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock’s lips became a humourless smile, and his voice was soft but detached. “It’s not your fault, John.”
"Sherlock, what the hell are you doing in my bed?" His voice was raw.
John just needed sleep. That was it. So, with stiff movements and a generous amount of throat-clearing, John slide into bed next to Sherlock.
So then I fell. First I felt, then I fell. Poetry. It wasn’t just the plummet of my body towards the pavement. It was the metaphoric destruction of my pulsing heart. It was the unimaginably rapid decent of my being. From a life with you to a life without.
“Is this a warning?”
And finally a reminder: I’d never kill you, John. Not on purpose. Not unless you asked. But maybe not even then, because I am so indisputably selfish.
We used to chase criminals and masterminds through deadly currents hidden beneath the peaceful calm of London, you and I. Thieves and killers, rapists and liars. You see, there are those who deserve to die, and there are those who want to.
“You were not ‘bestowed upon me’,” John said. “You were dumped on me. I didn’t have much of a choice, either, alright?”
Hours later, I stood up. “How long?” I asked. “A couple hours,” you replied casually, like nothing had happened. You didn’t think I heard. But then you turned around and saw me and I saw you.
John inhaled sharply before nodding. “Fine.” And after a pause: “He thinks I’m your date.”
This is the final chapter of 'Sincerely, Your Sociopath.'
Because I don’t want to hurt you. Only if you asked, and maybe not even then, because I am a selfish man and I don’t want to see your worn face twisted in pain. I don’t want to feel any more agony. I’ve recently learnt that sometimes feeling can become too much. Too intense. Too colourful.
"I can't. Really, I don't need..." his voice trailed off as the woman struck him with an incredulous look.
“Oh.”
“Because I don’t want you to,” is what comes out of my mouth.
“A friend of mine is stopping over,” John declared one afternoon.
“He couldn’t have fixed it, though. People can’t just do that, can they?” John murmured.
John laughed, a strange and enjoyable sound, and Sherlock felt himself smile.
“Why?”
The doctor grabbed an old t-shirt and sweats, holding them out for Sherlock. "Should be big enough," he said, like nothing had changed, but everything had.
The second time I experienced fear: I realized that I had no choice but to leave you.
Sherlock only half-turned, reaching his arm out behind him while staying focused on the paper before him. “Could you text Scotland Yard for me?” he asked. “Tell them we need the victim’s purse. It’s small, and I doubt it has a shoulder strap. They’ll have it.”
“Evening, Sherlock,” You say, opening the door.
John ran a hand across the back of his neck. “The army.. gave him to me.”
Also, sorry that it's a bit short. I didn't want to stretch it out unnecessarily!
“Like he said, I got him off a murder charge—proved he was shoplifting on the other side of London.”
Nothing strange.
Nothing dramatic, just a goodbye. A letter. A regret. An adieu to the era of Sherlock and John. Closure? But I am not a sentimental man—
John furrowed his eyebrows and tilted his head. “A threat, Sherlock? No. Just… be nice.”
If you flipped through a dictionary, Sherlock thought, and looked up the entry for kind, you'd see an image of John Watson. Well, maybe.
No. I am lying to myself. I am lying to you. My body is constructed wholly of painful sentiment and worthless genius. You have flipped my life upside down. Turned my being inside out and twisted me in whatever way you could. But it isn’t your fault. It’s mine.
Sherlock sighed, and John decided he liked listening to Sherlock’s heart. “The face you make when you’re thinking. Really thinking. It’s an obvious face.”
He raced up the stairs and threw open the door, heart pounding. Sherlock sat in his chair, John’s handgun shooting rounds into their living room wallpaper. “Bored,” he said. The gun went off. “So. Bored.” Louder, another bang.
Furrowed eyebrows and narrowed eyes followed John Watson's every move until the bathroom door shut behind him. Rarely was Sherlock perplexed.
"Yeah, I got that, Sherlock. Thanks.” John rubbed the back of his neck. "They said it was the only one available."
“Don’t get that strapping me leaves wounds?”
This didn’t mean anything, sleeping together—not sleeping together, just… sleeping in the same bed. This didn't declare that John had feelings for his gorgeous flatmate. No, of course not. Maybe.
Sherlock and John, Post Season 3
…I think I am already spiraling down that inescapable trajectory.
Fuck him. The voice was violating John's mind once more, but he couldn't help the heat rising to his cheeks and down to... other places. He stood up. Sherlock didn't seem to notice.
Sherlock snorted, disbelieving. “Okay.” His eyes drew back to the text.
Cue a long and tense and awkward silence. Sherlock wondered if John had fallen asleep. John wondered if Sherlock had fallen asleep.
“You don’t sleep.” John crossed his arms over his chest.
I harvest hope that you never loved me as I have always loved you, that our fortuitous touches meant nothing, that the something in our glances was only one-sided. Maybe, just maybe, our strange relationship—if I can call it that—meant nothing to you but kindness and pity towards an anomalous flatmate. Perhaps, if you never loved me as I have always loved you, you aren’t hurting.
Sherlock Holmes
paused,
The silver, muted light from the window poured over Sherlock, John’s Sherlock. The raindrops streaming along the glass panes cast subtle shadows along the slave's skin. Kissed the permanent ink along the flesh of his neck. And God, Sherlock’s liquid eyes were glowing. Dangerous.
John closes his eyes and takes a deep breath as the corners of his mouth tug into a smile.
Then something caught his attention. John wasn't just whimpering, or screaming, even, like he sometimes did. John was talking. Sherlock couldn't hear the exact words through the door, so he got up, treading softly to the bedroom, trying not to groan aloud with every step. His back was worse than he had thought.
“Yes I do.”
“Do you miss it?”
He could hear John's labored breathing from the end of the hallway. Having a nightmare, then, Sherlock discerned. The both of them often had nightmares—John’s about the war and Sherlock's about the horrors he'd endured over the past years.
John, with Sherlock’s wrists in his grip and their mouths locked together, pulled his slave to the sofa and pushed him down into the cushions, none too gently, and straddled his lean frame.
So Sherlock told him of Scotland Yard, of the cases and murders and kidnappings, and the thrill of it. John listened, fascinated. Once more, curiosity burned through him, and John wondered how Sherlock ended up where he was now, but Sherlock didn’t tell, and John didn’t ask.
Sherlock froze. Something hot and burning and prickling unfurled in his chest, and he couldn’t determine if it was desire or sex or disgust but it was quiet possibly shame. His mind fogged with heat and he didn’t like the confusion of it, the uncertainty and wrongness.
John bit his cheek. "So that leaves you the couch, or," he hesitated. "I don't want your back getting worse. You could take my bed—“
“There we go.” Sherlock tugged off the shirt, face twisted in pain, pain that he was quick to hide.
The man’s rich voice struck John speechless. He coughed uneasily. “I was—no, I… you were different. Real. You were… alive?”
“I’m not happy with this situation, either, might I remind you,” barked Sherlock. “I didn’t have a slave of my choice bestowed upon me in reward for my glorious war deeds, John. That was you.”
Comforting.
The hotel room had only one bed. It struck John as they stood in the doorway. Yeah, the pub owners said it was all that was left. John said fine. Now he realized what exactly one bed meant...
So Sherlock did. John went to bed. That was that.
Oh, John. I'll try to update as soon as I can! Thank you for reading.
"The previous owners must've left it... or the landlady, perhaps," John said, more to himself than Sherlock. An breathy laugh escaped his mouth. "Are you meaning to tell me that you can play the violin? Slaves don't play instruments."
"God. I would never…no.”
There they were, then, standing among the dusty furniture of the old flat—John with his meager single suitcase of belongings and the new duffel given to him at the institution, the slave with only the gray shirt and trousers on his back.
"Just... nothing." John shrugged it off and sighed. "No big deal. I'm gonna wash up, then. Don't go running off."
I’d first like to establish that I am not a sentimental human being.
He went to bed with him anyway. This time it didn’t feel like desire or rage, but something entirely different. John Watson was a complicated creature.
When Sherlock and John arrived in one of John’s friend’s flat, a man by the name of Jerry, they were met with a chorus of ‘Johnny boy!’ and ‘Ay, John! How was the army?’
“What?” You snap. Annoyed again. Am I really that trying? Does it bother you that I’m not taking your counterfeit emotions seriously?
“I’m sorry,” he said again.
I’ll always love you. But John, my world’s gone back to black and white.
Another laughed. He was shorter, with a belly. “Might have to join the army to get me one of those! They all as pretty as 'im?”
“You really don’t know anything.” Sherlock’s voice was strained, yet he acted casual about the whole ordeal, shrugging it off. "I assure you, I'm not. To many I’m aesthetically pleasing, fucking curse it is. You own me. You can do whatever you want with me." His silver-blue eyes closed, and his mouth sneered. "I'm your property."
