Dean consulted his brother about it to make sure he was free, and when Sam gave him the green light Dean texted Cas to let him know they’d be there tomorrow. Cas responded with a smiling emoji, which Dean thinks is incredibly adorable how much Cas loves his emojis, or, as Cas calls them, emoticons.
Dean quickly turns back to Cas with a worried expression. Had he really gone too far? Is Cas uncomfortable with this now? Has he already managed to fuck this all up? "No, no, really, Cas it's fine. It's more than fine. I really appreciate all that you did for this."
“I wanted more.” Castiel mumbles, grabbing the glass and looking into it like more will just show up.
“The roads are flooded.” Cas states looking up and meeting Dean’s eyes. Cas opens his mouth to say something, hesitates, then proceeds. “Would you like to stay here for the night so you don’t have to drive in this?”
Little bro, you got your boyfriend sick yesterday and now he's giving Sam grey hairs, go save the moose from greying early.
The thought crosses Dean’s mind making him question whether this is the right thing to be doing. There are much more important things he could do with that money than to be buying tickets for a convention and, what, maybe five minute celebrity interaction time?
“No,” Cas says with a confused frown and he regrets the tone in his voice the moment it leaves his lips because Dean has visible walls that shoot up when he hears the question in Cas' tone. Cas curses himself. It had been going well. Of course, he had to fuck it up and make Dean close off. He thins his lips not wanting Dean to close off to him, but part of him feels that he could help; he wants to help. "Dean," Cas starts a little tentatively and Dean refuses to meet his gaze, but Sam chooses that exact moment to shout at them.
In the lobby of Castiel's — and now his, but he isn't thinking about that right now — condo, a man, alpha most likely, is standing at the omega secretary's desk. The two of them are talking peacefully, which is a sight to behold when it’s between an alpha and omega. He's a burly alpha with a beard and a hat on. He's turned to the side so Dean can see a pair of sunglasses hooked on the collar of his shirt, pulling it down into a V and showing off his chest hair.
Dean looks up tapping his phone on his knee with a chuckle. "I think Gabriel is annoying the shit out of Cas right now. He offered to send Gabriel over here to make us stop thinking about the show, but then-" Dean's phone buzzes and he picks it up reading over the message slowly. "he said … that …" His voice trails off reading the last sentence.
Sam meets her sad eyes with his own. “Honestly? Yes.”
Chapter Title: Deathwish by Architects
He leans back in, but this time he bypasses Castiel’s lips and goes for his neck. The hand that’s still in his hair grips and pulls his head to the side. Castiel bites back a moan and goes willingly, trusting this man. Dean trails soft kisses up his neck and nips at the sensitive skin right below his ear. The moan he’s been suppressing breaks through and his arms tighten around Dean. His warm breath ghosts over his ear and it sends goosebumps over his skin.
"No." Cas calms his expression and looks to Sam and Dean. "I'm sorry. Something has come up, It appears my schedule has been booked without my knowledge and I won't be able to see you again today." A frown etches its way onto his face. "I really am sorry."
"I showered yesterday, Dean." Sam sighs running a hand through his hair as he makes his way to the shower. "Give me ten minutes and I'll be ready."
Of course they are.
Dean chuckles, not unkindly. “If that’s you trying to deter me, it’s really not working.” Castiel looks up, meeting Dean’s eyes. They’ve taken on a much softer tone than their previous gaze of a lioness that’s stalking her prey. “I don’t care if you’ve never done anything with anyone before.” Dean winks. “Just means I get to teach you everything.”
Dean rubs his face. He figured they would end up talking about this. “I get it, man. The pressure you’re under and the stress. Not knowing what happened to one of your guys. I get it. I shouldn’t have stuck my nose in where it doesn’t belong.” Especially since Dean is planning on leaving anyway. “So … y’know, I’m sorry too.”
“I don’t, I’d pay to see him rot in hell. I guess I just want to know if he’s someone else I have to worry about right now.”
"Whoa, whoa, you have a crush on Jessica?" Gabriel teases playfully.
"Dean! Knock it off!" Sam swats at Dean trying to get him to let go. Dean only laughs, but decides to let him go. When free, Sam desperately tries to fix his hair with an annoyed glare at his brother.
Meg hums. "The one that opened next to Togi's?" Castiel nods. Meg pops the gum she's chewing. "You know, I heard Inias is working there."
“Charlie,” Dean gives her a smile. “What brings you here?”
Castiel smiles and leaves the dining room. “I’ll watch over him.”
Why? Because if he answers all the questions correctly then he is going to look like an obsessive freak stalker. Will Cas think of him differently? Will Cas think Dean only cares about being with the lead actor of his favorite show? But he really wants to see Cas again, not to mention the 500 dollars would be great.
"Knowing she remembers you should give you more to say now. You can spend your time trying to woo her."
Castiel is sitting in the dining room, his dinner plate pushed to the side and his school work is spread across the table. Castiel looks up when he hears his brother’s car. A moment later, the front door opens.
Cas smiles seeing this and when he gets close enough he greets them. “Hello, Dean.”
Cas eyes him for a moment. “Yes. I also went to speak with Alpha Cain Mullen. We agreed to send someone to join Alistair’s gang in order for us to get inside information.”
Before he can speak, Dean is pulling him from the ground and into his lap, kissing him hotly. Cas grunts into the kiss but kisses back when he gets his bearings. Dean swipes his tongue over his lip and Castiel opens his mouth for him, his tongue delving in and exploring, tasting himself on him. Castiel moans, hips jerking.
Cas smiles and brings everything upstairs and to Dean’s room. Dean is sitting in bed with his back against the wall and his eyes closed, he doesn’t open them until he hears Cas putting the bowl down on the nightstand by his bed. He looks over and Cas hold out a hand that has pills in them.
Dean wraps his arm around Castiel’s waist and makes him stand. Castiel makes a noise of surprise and stumbles into Dean’s broad chest. “Come on, Angel, let’s get you to bed.”
He takes a moment to realize that he really is shaking. He thins his lips. “Just … a little nervous.”
Chapter Title: Communication Breakdown by Led Zeppelin
“Yes, it’s about my sister, Anna. She’s getting married soon, and she sent us an invitation. She’s been dying to meet you. She was going to fly in when we had dinner with the rest of my family, but she wasn’t able to.”
He turns quickly and makes his way into the back. They both follow and Garth leads Dean to stand in the middle of the room. Dean is uncomfortable with the whole experience, but the beta’s aura is surprisingly calming. The way he continuously chatters gives Dean something to focus on and isn’t nearly as annoying as Dean imagined it would be. Before Garth touches him anywhere, he tells Dean where he’s gonna touch which is really reassuring. When it comes to the pressure point on the back of his neck, he’s extra careful.
He’s never been with anyone. Nobody’s ever interested him enough.
"I think I need to apologize." Dean doesn't meet his eyes immediately, but after a second he looks up to see Cas is watching him with furrowed brows. "I've been comparing you to every alpha I know and that's not fair to you. You've done nothing to make me think you would act like that, so I'm sorry."
"Uh," Dean thinks it over, taking in what he really feels at the moment. Surprisingly, he feels good. It most likely has something to do with the fact that he is laying in his alpha's bed and surrounded by his scent. "I'm good."
"Are you sure you don't want to go out to eat?"
His therapist’s, Naomi, voice rings through his head and he flinches.
Did I mention this was a slow burn? I promise it will get to it eventually, just be patient.
“Doesn’t matter.”
“Just open it.” Dean cuts in before Sam can go on a lecture about how Dean should have saved his money and yadda, yadda, yadda.
Dean purses his lips. That's a trick question, isn't it? Sharlot was pregnant when she was killed, but that doesn't mean they had the child yet.
Cas swallows and nods. “It’s very good. Have you been here before?”
“Yeah, but don’t worry, I can vouch for you if you’re worried about them not liking you. Or, unless you have something planned.” Gabriel says taking a sip of Castiel’s drink. Dean’s eyes watch his every movement and his fingers twitch before he looks away, taking a deep breath.
The only thing that he likes about this Monday is talking to Charlie about the convention during lunch. Charlie immediately started interrogating him for answers the moment she stepped into the lounge. Although it wasn't really an interrogation since Dean took little to no coaxing to get the answers from him, which was a shock.
Dean whistles and smirks at him. “Seeing you get all demanding is making me tingly, Cas.” Dean’s smirk is wiped from his face when he goes into another coughing fit, successfully making Cas roll his eyes. “Really, Cas,” Dean starts, cringing at a pain in his chest. “I don’t need them.”
The elevator dings a little while later and Dean snaps his head in the direction, getting ready to fight. It’s more than likely Cas, but he can never be too careful. Thankfully, a familiar mop of dark hair and black wings comes into view from around the corner and he relaxes. Cas stops when his eyes land on Dean. His suit jacket is draped over his arm and the top buttons of his dress shirt are undone. He must be heading to bed. Instead of heading up to his room though, he walks over to the couch and sits beside him.
” Castiel casts a glance over his shoulder to see Balthazar grimacing. “
Why is Gabriel trying so hard to get Castiel to go out with Dean? Why Dean? Sure he seems nice and all, but why? Castiel loves his brother, but sometimes he wishes that he would leave his romantic life alone. No, scratch that. He always wishes he would leave his romantic life alone.
It was 2am, I was tired and sleep deprived after a long day of school work, but I decided to do some work on this story. Once I was done, I cut the entire file (all my notes for future chapters as well) to move it to another location, and as soon as I cut it, my laptop screen goes black. My laptop has randomly shut down for awhile now, but I didn't think of it that night (sleep deprivation does that). So naturally, I panic. I start it back up and get back on, and my file is missing. I nearly had a heart attack when I couldn't get it back, but thankfully I was was able to save this story from indefinitely being put on hiatus by reverting this chapter to an older save in order to get it back. That being said, there might be a few issues.
Cas raises his brows before another walking toward the door. "That would be nice, but it isn't necessary if it isn't something you're interested in."
“I’m not judging you, I simply didn’t know.”
“I only have one duffle,” Dean says and waits for Benny to get out. “I think I’ll be fine.”
Dean groans as he starts to wake up, but the smell of coffee and bacon wakes him up enough to opens his eyes and take in his surroundings. He squints and furrows his brows as he groggily sits up. Why is he in the living- oh. He feels his cheeks slightly heat up remembering everything he did last night. He goes to stand up but pauses when he sees his clothes neatly folded on the coffee table. Grabbing them he makes his way to the bathroom and gets ready for the day, trying to tell himself to not act weird around Cas because he was stupid and embarrassed about last night.
Castiel steels his nerves and clears his throat. “I, uh, I should tell you, before you get your hopes up any more, that I’ve never-” His ears are burning while he waves a hand between them, unable to look at Dean.
me of this decision?” Cas growls, his Pakhan voice coming out.
"I didn't tell you because I knew this is exactly the reaction I would get, and I'm gonna tell him. It isn't something you can just blurt out, Sammy. What do you want me to do, go up to him and say, 'Hi, I love you and I'm a serial killer. Wanna come with my brother and I and burn the world?"
Dean sees the split second of hesitation before Sam shakes his head. “No,”
. Great, this is great.
Castiel Novak, lead actor on the hit show Mishapocalypse, is no stranger to this list, he has been frequenting it ever since he made his debut as an established actor. His sudden rise in fame shocked many people, but what shocked people more is that he has been single for most of his life, and he mentions he has no intention of rushing into any kind of relationship. This not only makes him one of the most popular and respectable, but one of the most difficult bachelors to get with, so if anyone was planning on trying to get him, you better have a good plan to make him fall head over heels. Here is what was said:
"No, no, it isn't-" Cas quickly says then stops abruptly, hand making its way to his own shoulder to rub the tension out. "Sam is okay. I'm sorry for causing you to worry, I was just deep in thought." Cas flashes him a small smile to reassure him that everything really is okay.
“Yeah, but someone who's responsible wouldn't have lost the papers in the first place.” Dean sighs rubbing his neck. He doesn't know why he's talking about this and to Cas of all people. He should just let it go and act as if it's nothing. As if it doesn't bother him at all because it really shouldn't. Typically he doesn't care what people think of him, but when it comes to Cas or Sam, he can't stand the thought of them thinking badly of him.
“Dean, I’m here.” A man’s voice breaks the still air.
Balthazar’s whole demeanor changes in an instant. “Well shit.” He murmurs inelegantly, which is strange for his brother. He takes Dean’s hand laughing. “Cassie, you didn’t tell me you scored yourself a male model. You’ve been holding out on me.”
Her eyes widen. "Sam, are you trying to come out to your brother?" Sam's eyes widen. "You don't have anything to worry about, Dean will be completely fine with it!" She smiles warmly. "He had no problem with me."
"Dean's right, Cas," Sam adds with a smile. "Today was fun, thank you for inviting us."
“In here, Sammy.” Dean calls, not standing up.
“Let’s get you to school.” Dean says, leaning in and claiming his lips once more. After a moment, he leans back slightly and hums. “I like this scent on you. You smell like me.”
“Inias was taken.”
“We should stop,” Castiel says.
Since my titles are all song titles, I remembered this one and chuckled, so it obviously had to be the title xD
I seem to be able to write more when I'm getting my hair done. I wrote a majority of this chapter while I was at the salon. I didn't want to keep you guys waiting too long, so I'm glad I was able to get this written. That being said, it isn't edited and I wrote it pretty fast, so there might be issues, but hopefully it flows well!
Dean's eyes widen. "No way, really?" When Sam nods Dean beams a smile at him. "See, I told you she'd be thrilled to see you again." Dean scoffs looking back to the stage with a teasing roll of his eyes muttering, "Worried she wouldn't like you."
If Dean didn't feel like shit before, he really does now.
Dean turns his attention back at the nightstands and looks at the books laying there. He picks up the one on top. It's in Russian, so Dean can't read it. Dean should probably try learning Russian seeing he's mated to a Russian now. That'll be difficult for sure, but it would definitely come in handy. He hears Cas come out of his closet and he looks back. Cas' eyes drop to the book in his hand and smiles before shrugging on his suit jacket.
"You too, Cas." They linger for a few seconds longer, neither wanting to be the one to break the eye contact, but Dean eventually turns with a wave and leaves. Once he's further away, he spares a glance back to see Cas as a little figure in the distance under a light. After that, he heads straight back to the room.
I have a lot to say in this so bear with me for a moment please xD I promise I won’t write this much at the beginning of all the chapters.
Cas can't help but smile seeing his appetite hasn't been affected. “Yes, it is. And if you go to bed you can have some.”
*****
“If that’s what you want, yes.”
"Basically, yes."
“Yeah,” Dean says in a clipped tone, pulling his door closed. He sees Benny nod and walk around to the driver’s side, getting in.
He pulls his phone out when he gets the brilliant idea to text Dean. When he does this, he sees the time and sighs dramatically. He’s only been here a little over a half an hour.
A shiver runs up his spine. He closes the rest of the space between them, connecting their lips. Dean lets him take the lead. Breaking away from Dean’s plush lips, he begins trailing kisses over his jaw and down his neck. Reaching his collarbone, Castiel begins sliding off his lap and onto the carpeted floor. When his knees connect with the floor, he pushes Dean’s legs to the sides, Dean letting them fall away easily, and he slots himself between them.
If you like this chapter, tell me, and I may just do some more from Cas' POV. That being said, let's see what's going on in that pretty head of his ;)
Meg bursts into laughter, catching him off guard. “Book bonging,” she continues laughing. “I never thought about turning it into a verb. Thanks, gorgeous. It’s just something Clarence and I used to do as children. We’d smoke and talk shit. We’re obviously not going to smoke with you being pregnant, but I just wanted to spend some time and talk to you. See how you’re adjusting.”
Then all of a sudden Gabriel waltzes over, grabbing one of the empty chairs at their table and sits down with a wide smile, his head resting in his hands. “Do, what's the top-secret mission you're discussing? Whatever it is, I want in.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When he gets inside, he takes off his shoes and lines them up against the wall. He supposes he should get dinner started and try to think about what he's going to tell his brother when he gets home.
Cas pulls him in and places a gentle kiss on his lips. “I can look for your father if you’re worried.”
“I will take you to my tailor.”
School is getting really busy recently and I have to go to work so I just wanted to warn you all that updates might be a little slower again. I'll be back with an update as soon as I can!
Charlie beams over at Dean and pats him on the arm. “You’ve got nothing to worry about now. You and Cas have hung out multiple times before now, so it should be a slice of pie.”
Блядь — Fuck
“Doesn’t matter, my ass.” Dean turns to Benny. “It’s fine, Benny, you can go back out. I’ll handle him.” Benny narrows his eyes at the gun on the floor and Dean takes it, giving it to him. When Benny has the gun, he leaves, closing the door behind him with one last look over his shoulder.
"Yeah, man," Dean laughs shaking his head. "I don't know how you do it. I have a whole new respect for you and everyone else."
Nothing happens.
Ты позволил ему подвергнуть себя опасности после того, что случилось? - You let him put himself in danger after what happened?
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe it’s the fact that,” He shrugs nonchalantly. “You practically bolted from here as soon as you found out about the convention and you were so distracted that you left your papers here.” Gabriel smirks, slinging his bag on his shoulder. “But who knows, maybe it’s just me and you bolted for another entirely unrelated reason.”
"It was that bad?"
Pie is always a good distraction against the inevitable.
“Are we talking about your definition of fun or mine?”
Chapter Title: Don’t You Dare Forget The Sun by Get Scared
"Yeah, I was planning on staying here for a little while." Dean shifts and his ears twitch.
Castiel doesn’t wait, he kicks the door in. The wood splinters and Castiel runs in, gun raised. The room is trashed. Scratch that, the entire house is destroyed.
Castiel knows Michael catches onto his frantic tone because there’s a beat of silence before he says,
"Hold on, can I write something on that before you take it?"
Carlos drops his eyes from Dean’s piercing stare to his hands, unable to hold his stare any longer. “Sorry.”
“Why are you doing this over one stupid omega?” Bartholomew snarls.
“How'd you …” Sam pauses and nods, no longer needing to ask. “Gabriel told you?”
"Cas." Dean immediately drops his stressed demeanor seeing Castiel look at him a little worriedly. He smiles a bit sheepishly then he realizes he just called him Cas instead of Castiel and maybe that look Castiel is giving him is confusion rather than worry. "Oh, I- sorry I didn't mean to call you Cas. It just felt … It just slipped."
Sam sighs running his hand through his hair. “I know.”
“But you made an exception for me.”
“My dad, he was a police officer. He was good, really good, like you say you are, but even he had cases that drove him up a wall.”
Dean grins up at him reassuringly. He puts his hands on Castiel’s hips and rubs little circles with his thumbs over his hip bones. “Relax for me, Cas, okay?”
Charlie glances back to Sam. “You did the right thing calling me.” She looks back to Dean who is now looking over at the two with furrowed brows. “Alright, Dean, let’s get you something to wear.”
That must have been an intense thought, Dean thought to himself, then nods. "Alright." He claps his hands beaming a smile in the actor's direction. "Where to?"
Castiel’s eyes widen slightly not expecting him to say that, but soon he smiles.
"Why don't you leave that to Cas, since, oh! You're fucking him and haven't told him what we do! Not to mention you didn't tell me either."
Dean nods taking a drink. “Yeah, basically.”
Здесь ты в безопасности. Я буду защищать тебя. - You are safe here. I will protect you.
Dean turns his head and looks into his eyes that Dean just can't get enough of. "Cas,"
Cas’ phone starts ringing a second later and the alpha sighs, annoyance in his scent. “I need to take this,” Cas says, getting up and walking out onto the balcony. Dean can still see him through the glass doors. The wind must be blowing, his hair and feathers swaying gently. It looks cold out. Tearing his eyes from his alpha, he eyes what Cas got. Sesame tofu.
Gabriel lights up at that and nods triumphantly.
Charlie snaps her eyes to Gabriel in shock. “Gabriel…”
“Of course,” Cas smiles, “You two have the first two rooms on the left at the top of the stairs when you’re done.” Cas then leaves them alone to get ready for bed.
"Since my baby bro is otherwise currently occupied, you two are stuck with me as your guide." Gabriel smiles back at them. And Sam is about to tell Gabriel that someone is coming towards them with a large prop, but Gabriel ducks without prompting from Sam. Gabriel jabs a thumb in the direction of the prop. "And be on alert at all time."
“You can’t tell me you aren’t excited, Sammy. It’s tomorrow! You get to meet Jess Saturday.” Dean smacks his brother’s shoulder and goes over to the driver’s side door and hops in, hands tapping the steering wheel to the nonexistent music. Sam can’t help but crack a smile seeing Dean this happy. It’s been a long time since he has acted like this, and he isn’t going to ruin his mood.
What is he thinking? There is only one option or else Dean will never come out.
Dean jolts at Cas’ question, looking up to meet his eyes. He thought he was acting normal. “Yeah, I'm fine. Why?”
Dean scrunches his face, looking up at Meg. “Book bong?”
"Yes?" Cas says almost nervously.
, Sam. All of you are out here fighting the good fight, but I’m sitting on my ass at home like a pregnant bare-footed omega, and I …” Dean sucks in a breath, running a hand over his face. “I need to feel like me again. Let me.”
“You don’t say.” Gabriel mocks, earning a glare from his brother, but Dean pays it no attention.
He hears a long-suffering sigh on the other end and he bites his bottom lip, waiting for Michael to tell him he’s upset but it never comes.
У меня есть ты, львенок. Никто никогда больше не прикоснется к тебе. - I’ve got you, baby lion. Nobody will ever touch you again.
Cas’ face flushes a light shade of pink. “How did you hear about that?”
“Where are you going?” Cas asks, right behind him.
Dean sets his phone on his lap waiting for a response that comes a lot quicker than he or Sam, judging by his shocked expression by the vibrating phone, expected. Dean picks it up and reads what Cas said.
A few people turn to look at them after Gabriel said that a little louder than he probably should have. Sam gives an apologetic look to them and looks back to Gabriel. "Okay, not so loud, Gabriel. You're going to draw attention."
Tears begin pricking behind his eyes again, but he clenches his jaw in an attempt to not cry. Dean’s hand rubs soothingly over his back and rests his head on top of his. He then brings his arm down and wraps tightly around his waist, his other hand resting atop his hands, thumb stroking his skin.
I’m sorry for such a long delay, school was kicking my ass! But I’m back now until January and I appreciate you all being so patient with me! Also, I’m sad about the series finale, but it's the reason I have this up now, so I’m going to be immersing myself in writing to try and fill this void...
He backs up, Cas’ wings opening to allow him to leave, but otherwise, Cas doesn’t move, his eyes staying trained on him. Dean clears his throat, keeping his back out of view as he scans the room for his shirt. It’s probably on Cas’ side of the bed. That means he has to maneuver around awkwardly in order to get his shirt so he doesn't have to show his back. Sure, Cas is a mob boss, he more than likely has a lot of scars of his own, but Dean's scars bring up dark memories he doesn't want to relive or bring to the light right now. He doesn't know if Cas will mention them, but he doesn't want to risk it. It's bad enough he felt them last night when he moved Dean to lay on top of him.
· Order by
Dean knows that he would be fine driving home, but the thought of staying longer with Cas is far too tempting. Not to mention he’s wearing Cas’ clothes so he should wait until his clothes are dry to leave. Plus, if they don’t
“Gabriel, what…” Sam starts but cuts himself off to give Charlie a slightly nervous look. What did he hear? “I, uhm…”
An amused glint raises in Cas' eyes, and he stares at Dean's profile for a few seconds longer than intended before turning his attention to the menu again. "What about you, do you know what you want?"
“Yes, and you were also hospitalized and you also got a dose of Red in your system. In case you’ve forgotten, Dean, you’re pregnant.”
When Dean pulls into his driveway he sits there in the Impala for a few more seconds after he shuts her off to sigh contentedly, then he pulls himself together so he’s not swooning when he gets inside. Upon opening the door he hears Charlie’s voice coming from the living room talking to Sam. Dean takes off his boots and mud-soaked socks and makes his way to the arch of the living room.
His entire life is sitting in that duffle.
“I would have!” She nearly yells slamming a palm on her desk’s top. “I know everything about Castiel.” She smirks and settles back looking rather confident. “Quiz me right now if you don’t believe me.”
“I haven’t had a reason to try staying until now.”
“That’s not…” Castiel blushes deeper. “It’s not that.” He sighs and grabs his coffee again to have something to keep his hands busy. “My brothers just don’t know that I’m gay and I would like to avoid them even thinking something happened between them.”
“It’s alright, Cas.” Dean smiles and puts his hand on his knee and squeezes it reassuringly. “I’m 31 if that’s what you were phishing for. What is it you do?” Dean asks Michael.
“You tell me,” Dean chuckles. “The leader of the Russian mafia asks you to be his mate and you think it’ll all be flowers and rainbows? There’s been some bad things that happened, yeah, but it’s not as bad as I thought it would be.” Dean rubs the back of his neck. “I’m probably gonna eat my own words later, but right now it’s … it’s nice. I don’t have to constantly watch my back for Alistair or his goons, and I’m warm, I have food, and Cas is … not what I expected.”
Это Иниас, - It's Inias,
“Kiss me, Cas,” Dean softly says.
“Samerella, you …” Gabriel goes silent on the other end of the line for a few seconds before speaking up again. “You good over there?”
"Gabriel, this feels like we are trying to put our noses where they don't belong. Dean doesn't like his privacy being invaded."
He’ll figure something out if it comes to that, though. He has to.
“I could think of a few things.” The older man practically purrs.
Dean takes a deep breath, inhaling the Alpha’s calm scent. He doesn’t have to ask if he killed him to know the answer is yes. Dean drops his eyes to his breakfast and picks at it. From the corner of his eyes, he sees Cas watching him, his wings shifting. He wants to talk about something, Dean can tell.
Sam hums with a faint smile. Sam seems to be acting normal towards Dean, which Dean was expecting, but it is still a relief knowing Sam isn’t still angry at him. Their little spats don’t typically leave them angry at each other for very long afterward, as long as the other leaves them alone for some time. The longest their argument lasted have been a few days, but that was when they were kids and would like to poke the bear with a stick just for shits and giggles. Now both of them are adults and handle these kinds of situations much better. They both know they need space, and poking the bear now could lead to injury, or worst case scenario, the hospital.
Cas' wings are tucked neatly at his back, giving nothing away. It’s a stark contrast from when Dean was alone with him in the apartment. Sure, it isn't like they were giving all his thoughts and emotions to Dean, but they were definitely more twitchy when they were alone. He's just not sure what Cas having restless wings means yet.
Cas turns around and comes to a halt seeing Dean in his clothes because damn Cas could get used to seeing Dean wearing his clothes. Cas quickly clears his throat and nods before his mind can drift any further down that road. “Yes, he’s okay. The roads are flooding though so he’s going to be late. Although it appears this was another one of Gabriel’s pranks. A rather poor prank, but a prank nonetheless.”
Gabriel nods laughing, hand clapping onto Dean’s shoulder leading him to the door. “That’s what I thought.” Once they get outside and Gabriel locks the shop up, he turns to Dean and points two finger guns at him. “See you at the convention.”
"Oh, shut up."
Hint: More comments means more fuel to update!
“Goodnight, Cas.” Dean gently kisses the top of Cas’ head before closing his eyes to sleep.
Sam narrows his eyes at Dean. "I'm not going to have that much time with her, Dean."
“We have to be careful about it though. Dean can be a bit touchy when it comes to his feeling. Being emotionally constipated is a task, on all of us. With him, we can’t just ask him if he’s bi/pan/questioning or whatever it is he is. We have to kind of … nudge him and show him it’s okay, but not all at the same time or within the same time period.”
“I see you’re as stubborn as ever,” Castiel says, and the alpha, which he hadn’t even known his name until now, scoffs. Castiel hums, leaning back against the table of torturing tools and opens the manila folder. “Bartholomew.”
“Thank you for making dinner, Cas.”
Cas grimaces, meeting his eyes. “I’m trusting you not to be lying right now.”
“I would have known that.” A girl with brown hair says looking at a boy across her table.
” Castiel barks, making Balthazar jerk and scramble to catch up from where he was leaning against the wall.
Castiel smiles and looks at him. “Hello, Dean.”
Sam thins his lips, pulling his bottom lip in between his teeth. "I would love to, Dean, but I'm on a roll with this paper and I think I can finish it tonight."
“He wanted to try and fly.” Sam adds and Cas’ eyes widen.
Shutting off the water, he steps out of the shower. After a minute, he’s dried off and dressed in some of Dean’s clothes he let him borrow. Everything feels a lot better now that he’s had time to relax and think. Being at Dean’s apartment is calming. Sam is apparently working right now, so they have the place to themselves. Which is convenient considering what Castiel wants to do right now.
"Hell, Cas, steak is the best route." Dean beams a wide grin at him before making his way over to the small table, Cas right behind him. They sit down across from each other and Dean can feel the warmth radiating off the food indicating he was just made not long ago.
When the women are done, Cas stands up and looks in the mirror for a second before turning to Dean. Dean closes his legs and looks him up and down, mouth open slightly in what could be interpreted as desire, but Cas brushes it off as his mind projecting again.
Dean pulls back and spits into his hand before looking into his eyes. “Spit.”

“No,” He shakes his head. “I wanted to do this for you. I don’t need that right now.”
“Anytime, boss.” Garth takes it and efficiently rings them up. He doesn’t say the price out loud, which Dean is kind of relieved about, before handing it back to Cas.
Dean throws his head back and laughs. It takes a moment before he meets his eyes again, but when he does, the crinkles by his eyes and little sigh of contentment makes Castiel's heart do funny things. "It was purely innocent when I asked," His smile turns into something darker, more lustful, and his eyes turn hungry with desire. "But I wouldn't be opposed to changing the agenda."
“Do you have any preferences in the material of your collar?” Garth asks when he finishes up all his measurements. Is he asking him? Why isn’t he asking the alpha in the room, that's the common procedure, especially if the alpha is the omega’s mate. When Dean doesn’t answer immediately, Garth looks at him, with what Dean is starting to think is a non-extinguishable smile, and says, “I have samples if you aren’t sure.”
“I need you to make a collar and a couple of suits for my mate.” Cas comes up beside Dean and puts a hand on his lower back.
*****
Sam's eyes widen. "Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, let's take the picture."
“Emotional Laxative.”
“Did you do that on purpose?”
“Wait,” Dean looks to Gabriel narrowing his eyes. “You knew he didn’t like horror movies, didn’t you?”
“Hey, sleeping beauty.” His smile falters and is replaced with concern. “How’re you feeling?” Dean asks and walks into the room, setting a mug of coffee on the nightstand for him and sits himself on the edge of the bed. “I wasn’t sure how you took your coffee, or if you even liked coffee, so it’s just black. I can grab milk and sugar if you want it though.”
“Okay, so I won't tell you.” Gabriel laughs lightheartedly.
Когда дело касается моей пары, ты советуешься со мной. Вы меня поняли? - When it comes to my mate, you consult me. Am I understood?
“How am I getting home to get my things?”
"I was going to tell her who I was and how I knew her, but now everything I planned…"
Inias gives him a strained smile. “You two been together long? I didn’t think you were with anyone a week ago.”
“That sounds like Dean.” Charlie smiles.
"In the kitchen." Castiel calls out, going to meet him halfway, but when he gets to the archway, he finds himself being engulfed in a tight hug.
“Hey, Dean-o, what’s got your panties in a twist? You that upset the shot closed early?”
The moment Castiel has been dreading is finally here as he slowly walks up the front steps to his house. He knows Michael isn't going to be home for another hour, but it's the waiting that's going to make Castiel lose it. He doesn't know how his brother is going to react. He knows he worried his siblings. Honestly, he's surprised Michael didn't go to the police when he never showed up. Castiel supposes he can thank Luke for that. He probably had enough sense to hold him back.
Once their picture is over Sam goes to grab the picture he had Jess sign from the table, but she stops him by putting a hand on his arm.
Cas nods and hands it over to Dean. Dean takes it and cracks it open, the spine not making any noises when he does, indicating it’s been well loved over the years. When his eyes land on the first page he can’t help but smile and read them aloud. “‘Where’s Papa going with that ax?’ asked Fern to her mother as they were sitting at the table for breakfast.” Dean sees Cas smile out of the corner of his eye so he continues to read it.
Sam and Dean's eyes both widen and they take a moment to look at each other before looking back to Gabriel. "She talks about me?"
Castiel can’t hold back the tears from spilling this time.
Castiel already knows he's going to blush long before he feels it heat his cheeks. "What movie did you have in mind?"
“Yeah, I’m good, the road is just starting to floor and it’s hell’s highway over here, but don’t worry I should be there soon … ish. And before you tell me not to come if it’s that bad, I’m already halfway there.”
Sam’s eyes widen and he whispers a quiet, “Wow,” He clears his throat holding up his hands trying to defuse his brother. “Okay, Dean, calm down. Cas isn’t going to care what you wea-“
The other end of the line is silent for a moment. “Of course it would be Gabriel,” Michael sighs. “Castiel, I don’t think you have time for such things as a relationship right now. You’re very busy with the show. It’s close to the finale, can’t this little … thing wait until after?”
Which, is stupid. You were just shot, of course it’s gonna hurt.
I wanted to take this chapter to give us all a little something we've all been waiting for ;) The boys talk, and progress is made in regards to Alistair. But I think a little romance between our two favorite boys was in order, finally letting them get their heads out of their asses. And a little fluffiness at the end, I hope you like it!
Dean actually looks sheepish and rubs the back of his neck. “Sorry about that, I didn’t think sleeping in jeans would be very comfortable.” He turns around and grabs a pair of folded up jeans off the dresser, handing them back to Castiel. “Here.”
And damn if that smile isn’t dazzling.
"I'm going to dinner with Jess tonight."
Michael's stumbling over his words is so uncharacteristic of him that Castiel is stunned into silence for a moment to process. That's when it clicks with what he's asking. Castiel's face heats up and he knows he's gone crimson.
Meg immediately says, “No.” while Charlie says, “Did he wink or anything?”
to get soaked again, then he isn’t going to leave. Then it connects with him that he isn’t just making the decision for himself, Sam might have something he has to do. He glances over to his brother. “You have anything you really need back at the house?”
“You just looked like you had something bothering you.”
“I would like to talk about what happened yesterday,” Cas says.
Adult responsibilities suck.
When they reach their destination, it’s a parking garage under a fancy apartment building. They get out and Balthazar leads him through the underground parking garage. The bitter wind is funneling through the tunnels and Dean pulls his jacket closer around his body to fight the chill. When they get out in the open, they go to the front of the building. Leading into the lobby, the walls are entirely made of glass. Looking through the windows, there are only a couple of people in the lobby. A woman behind the desk, a burly man talking with her amicably, a doorman that is glaring at everything in general, and a man standing by the elevator.
So long story short, Gabriel doesn’t assume anyone’s sexuality anymore. He needs to hear it from their lips for it to be concrete. Also meaning Dean seems straight, but he could be bi, pan, or anything under the rainbow. Another possibility is that Dean doesn’t know what he likes and only goes after women because that’s the normal, and all he could need is a little nudge in the right direction, preferably with his brother so Castiel will stop making those puppy eyes at all the couples he passes and making Gabriel, the overprotective older brother he is, worried as fuck and just wants him to be happy.
“I wouldn’t joke about this.”
Chapter Title: Sink or Swim by Falling in Reverse
Кристально ясно, Пахан. - Crystal clear, Pakhan.
Dean thanks the guard and not a minute later the door swings open and Gabriel is standing there with a wide grin. "Dean-o, Samerella, glad you could make it. Cassie is in a shoot right now, come with me." He turns to the guard giving him a thumbs up. "Keep up the good work, Berry." Opening the door wider for the brothers, he motions for them to come in. "Follow me."
Sam lets out a disgruntled sigh running a hand through his hair. This is going to be harder than he thought, and as much as he doesn't want to exploit his brother's possible secret, he's going to need an expert. Scrolling through his contacts he clicks one and types out a message, re-reading it a few times and making sure this is the right thing to do before he decides that yes, this is the right thing and he hits send.
Dean chuckles and shakes his head. “No, it got me a broken leg.”
So, I've made an executive decision ... and will probably regret it, but I'm posting this new story I've been working on for a little while. I have other stories that I need to finish, but my muse isn't in those at the moment (though I will finish them eventually). And given our recent circumstances, I'm finding myself wanting a sense of community again. That being said, I haven't finished this story, so if you like it, please be sure to tell me and I'll update as fast as I can.
“What’s up bitches.” She winks at Dean twirling her bag of lunch on a finger as she sits next to him on the couch. “Wonderful morning, isn’t it?”
“Sam, shh.” Dean puts a finger to his own lips to silence his brother,  a smile tugging at the corners of his lips seeing Sam have a petulant look on his face. “It’s already done, so just enjoy it, ‘kay? Okay. Now I gotta go, knock ‘em dead today, Sammy!” Dean gets in his car and pulls out of the driveway.
Apparently like he does right now.
Gabriel holds his hands up in defense and hides behind Sam who tries to get out of the way, not wanting to get in the line of fire. Gabriel then peeks his head around Sam saying, “Whoa, hey, no need for the daggers there. If Cassie didn’t want to watch it all he had to do was say no.” Gabriel looks at the clock hanging on the wall. “I don’t know about you guys but I’m gonna hit the hay, busy day tomorrow.” Gabriel makes his way to the stairs shouting over his shoulder, “Don’t stay up too late kids.”
"Let’s just go already," Dean grumbles and starts to head towards the front doors.
Cas furrows his brows together. "Why were you worried?"
“Sure thing! I heard about you getting a mate, congratulations to you both. I know when I mated my Beth it was the best day of my life.” Garth beams at them before looking at Dean. He claps his hands together. “Why don’t you come with me.”
Dean sees the fear and panic starting to rise in his brother's eyes, so he squeezes his shoulder to bring his focus back to Dean and away from his thoughts. Overthinking situations is always the way people deter themselves. "Stop working yourself up. Remember, she is still Jessica, she's still human and not any different than you and me. She is going to be
"Bitch."
A.R.T.s
Sam shrugs lightly. “Because there's a weird air around you since I came back from talking to Jess, I'm just worried something happened.”
Cas narrows his eyes. “And you didn’t think it pertinent to
"Question four. Did, or does, Misha have any children?"
Dean's eyes light up and he can't help but smile. "You like bacon?"
“Are you okay?”
He doesn’t like using the scent neutralizers since they’re so expensive, but this is a necessity. He’s lucky he even has the tiny bottle that he does. He’ll have to use it sparingly until he finds a way to make money to buy more. Hopefully, he’ll find a solution fast because he’s going to start showing within a few months. If all goes well, he’ll be gone before then.
A small smile appears on Castiel's lips and his eyes crinkle at the sides. That smile is lethal to Dean's health and he has to look away, but he can't. Castiel and Dean's eyes are locked and he can't tear them away. He can't help it; the smile in Castiel's eyes is captivating.
mission that he failed, I want the title of the episode, and why did he fail?"
Sam frowns, his attention falling from Charlie back to the situation at hand and he leans back in his chair. "Our dad, he …" Sam pauses not knowing how to word it correctly. "He isn't one of the most … understanding people you'll meet. And when it comes to homosexuality, well, let's just say he doesn't like it."
“He was incompotent.”
Dean opens his mouth to shoot back a comment, but then realizes he has nothing convincing enough to counter that. The only thing he has would sound made up, which, to be fair, it is. So Dean is left to stand there, arms crossed over his chest, mouth slowly closing, looking like an idiot once again.
“Play it,” Cas says.
Since I've been away for so long, how about an extra-long chapter this time! Enjoy!
“That’s alright; we can head to bed now too. Follow me. I have some new toothbrushes you can have.” Cas leads them back the hall to the bathroom and gets them both a toothbrush.
Some of the questions are genuinely interesting, and others are funny. There were a couple questions about Misha's past and what Cas thought of it, which was rather interesting to hear what Cas thought about it. The one thing Dean was, sort of, expecting to happen, didn't. He thought at least one person would ask something about Cas' personal life, but nobody brought it up. It seems fans have more respect than he gave them credit for. Although, Cas does tell stories of his own accord when answering some questions, but that's different from a fan asking for something personal.
That last one sounds more accurate.
Cas rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. “I have a weak constitution when it comes to scary movies.” Cas gives a small chuckle. “I was hoping I’d be able to play it off longer than I did.”
“Do you … know where he is, or who took him?”
The thing about those feelings is that Cas has been desperately trying to subdue them because he doesn't want to make Dean uncomfortable or let his mind get carried away like it is now. His brain is projecting what he wishes to see in Dean's actions and expressions, his little quirks of his brow and the twists of his lips into a smile. The longing Cas sees in Dean's eyes isn't really there. It's all in his head, and Cas is painfully aware of that.
“I’m taking Balthazar to the new club that’s opened beside Togi’s.” Castiel says into the silence, not looking at Michael. He isn’t sure how he’s gonna react since the last time he went to a club it ended up with him going missing. “He said it’s called Angeles.”
“Don’t know what you wanna talk about,” Dean says, deciding to be honest.
Dean’s head is swimming with that last statement. What does he mean? He’s royally fucked now, isn’t he? Cas knows something is up. Shit, does he know? What does he know? Dean curses himself. He should have just told him the truth. Now Cas is gonna be pissed at him and he isn’t gonna trust him. It isn’t like Dean has given him a reason to trust him.
Thankfully, Dean doesn't seem deterred. He shrugs and leans back in his seat. “We surprised each other then. I wasn’t expecting to see you here either. I come here all the time. Imagine my surprise when I see a familiar, grumpy, bed-headed beauty in the corner.” Castiel feels like he could burst into flames at the moment, but he remains silent. “That’s when I remembered I never got your number yesterday and came over to say hi.” Dean leans in, elbows on the table and lasciviously on his face. “So, what d’you say, sweetheart? I really enjoyed yesterday and would love to see you again. Can I have your number?”
Castiel hesitates a moment, taking the time to look in his eyes to see if he’s telling the truth. When all he sees is unbridled truth in those green depths, he lets himself nod again, but makes no move to speak.
Cas doesn’t stop glaring at his brother. “You better have found something good.”
He frowns, looking at his phone and the string of messages he just sent off to Dean. He looks over at his almost empty mojito and wonders if Dean has ever had one. He starts to text again but is cut off when it buzzes in his hand and scares the shit out of him.
“Not until I know what you said is true.” Castiel leaves the room in a flurry, his wings twitching restlessly on his back, itching to spread and just take off. “
Dean chuckles some more, gently taking the glass and putting it further away. He then grabs Castiel’s chin and pulls himself in to kiss him. “I think you’ve had enough for tonight,” Dean says against his lips and sits on a stool behind him after one more kiss. “You’ll thank me in the morning.”
Cas frowns, coming closer. “I thought you hated your father. Why do you want to find him?”
"Cher," Benny says, making Dean stop in his tracks and look at him with furrowed brows. What did he call him? "We're going this way," Benny continues and points behind him to the elevator.
"Oh, he'll be more than upset if he finds out." Sam gives her a small, reassuring smile. "So we just have to make damn sure he doesn't find out."
“Then why did you ask to help?” Cas growls.
Balthazar nods, standing up, and making his way towards the door behind the secretary's desk and opening it for Cas. Cas walks towards him, his whole demeanor shifting to something more intimidating, more like a mafia boss Dean imagined him to be like. When he disappears through the door, Balthazar gives Den a cursory glance before following Cas out.
Sam laughs shaking his head. "I know you did."
Chapter Title: Livin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi
.” Sam emphasizes that last part for Dean, in which case Dean simply rolls his eyes at his brother. “Thanks for the offer though, Gabriel.”
“Gabriel,” Castiel says exasperatedly.
Dean laughs and turns back towards them. “Yeah, yeah, I have to give my dear friend a hug goodbye though.” Dean holds out his arm and walks towards Charlie.
Sam raises his hands. “I didn’t say anything.”
Cas hangs up on him, not trusting himself to keep calm if he were to answer Michael. He will deal with him later, but right now he’s with Sam and he doesn’t want to cause a scene. Cas takes a deep breath and goes to pocket his phone, but it starts to ring again, so Cas turns it on airplane mode before cramming it back in his pocket. He makes his way back to Sam and begins to clean again.
“Why would Alistair give a single fucking shit about a stupid omega?” The alpha spits, ripping at his restraints.
“Three months, give or take,” Dean finally says. He plays with the picture in his pocket before taking it out with trembling fingers and hands it to Cas.
Gabriel arches a brow at Sam and looks back to see the people staring, so he smiles and gives them a wave. When he looks back he taps his fingers on the tabletop. "So is it cool if I bring Castiel into this?"
Also, I finally fixed the hovertext. I was just being an idiot xD, so now I've gone back and fixed the previous chapters that had hovertext.
Not all Demis have animal traits though. Only if a human and a shifter have a kid will that kid have animal traits like wings or tails or ears. So Cas and Dean are known as half-breeds. Dean does have cat ears and tail and slitted pupils, just like Cas has wings. Half-breeds are looked down on in society because humans and pure-shifters think they’re abominations.
measly second reprieve from his brother’s bitching.
When he gets closer, the beta side-eyes him and smiles, blowing out smoke. “You goin’ somewhere, babe?”
“You've got a nice house.” Dean says as he starts to strip, the conversation keeping Cas in the room, so he turns his back on them.
“Dean,” Sam says, tone soft.
Walking into this club is very similar to the one on Gabriel’s birthday. Crowded, hot, and smoky. Balthazar immediately drags him over to the bar and they sit down. Castiel has to squeeze into his seat between a very large man and a touchy-feely woman. It’s unpleasant already.
Ignore the fact that he’s had plenty of time to do that before. He doesn’t want to think about that.
But once Castiel had seen how Dean handled April, it was rather clear that his first thought was correct. Dean was staking a claim.
Dean nods knowing this was going to happen, he was just waiting for it. He nods his head towards the fridge, “Mine is on the side of the fridge. It’s just a normal admissions ticket though.” And before Sam has time to chime in, Dean thinks now is as good a time as any to tell him about that thing. “Besides,” He starts, successfully stopping Sam’s thoughts. “I already got to meet Cas yesterday at Gabe’s Cafe.”
*****
“Hey, hey, Cas, you’re hurting yourself.” Dean’s voice rings over Naomi’s, bringing him out of the headspace he was it. He looks down and sees Dean keeping Castiel’s fingers away from his palms. There are little crescent moons of blood where his nails had dug into the skin. Immediately, he lets his fingers go lax. He hadn’t even realized he was … he hasn’t done this since his sessions with- he cuts his thoughts off abruptly.
Sure he's hung out with Cas at a restaurant before, but that was different. They didn't sit down and eat with each other, and Dean didn't have the pressure of the word date hanging over his head to not screw up. Before if he screwed up, he would still be Cas’ friend. Although, if he screws it up this time, Cas wouldn't want to still be his friend, would he? Typically if a date goes south then they part ways, never to speak to each other again. Dean doesn't want that.
“When did this happen?” Sam asks genuinely curious because he's never heard this before.
He doesn’t stick around to hear his other brothers’ replies and he closes himself in his room.
Cas turns away and walks a little down the driveway answering the call. “Yes, Michael?”
“So,” Cas starts, “Where are planning on taking me?”
Sam smirks turning his attention back to Cas and they drop their hands. “It's a pleasure to meet you too. I'm a huge fan of your work.”
"I've been ready." Sam opens the door without hesitation and gets out, Dean following suit. Sam walks over to Dean and they begin to walk towards the number of warehouses. "Did he mention what warehouse it is?"
Dean smirks taking a large bite of his burger, not bothering to swallow before he starts talking. "I tried to bring you along. You have nobody to blame but yourself."
A.R.T.s
He keeps his eyes closed and catches his breath for a few seconds before opening his eyes and whispering to himself, “What did I just do…” his rational thoughts flooding his head making him feel guilty. Not to mention he hates himself for loving it so much. He shouldn't like being finger fucked. He especially isn't supposed to get so turned on by the thought of his fingers being Cas’ dick in his ass.
“Anytime, good luck on your end of things.”
“Michael.”
in you is not one of them. Believe me."
A soft smile plays at the corner of Dean's lips. "It's fine, Cas. I was only teasing, I'd love to eat dinner in your trailer." Dean chuckles a little as Cas' shoulders slump in relief. "You really go out of your way to make sure I never feel too exposed ever since I told you about that privacy thing."
Sam lets out a soft chuckle changing the channel to the one Mishapocalypse is going to play on in five minutes. “You’re an English teacher, Dean. They’re bound to write at least one paper.”
Another chapter will be up sooner or later. Thank you all for the support you've given me so far!
his brain helpfully supplies.
Dean nods and waves his goodbye. When he leaves the stage he makes his way towards the back, and it doesn't take long for him to find his brother. Sometimes Dean likes Sam's height, it makes it hard to lose him in a crowd. Sam instantly stands up and makes his way over to his brother since there were no seats around him for Dean, and the both of them make their way towards the back.
Luke hums, watching him for a moment before taking a bite. Gabriel seems to jump at the opportunity to speak after Luke doesn’t respond immediately. “Luke, how’s Lilith? Still up your ass at work?”
Sam pushes his hand down leaning back in the little, very uncomfortable chair. “I’m not broken.”
Dean is hesitant about part one, but part two he knows he got right.
When the man, a beta by scent, sees Cas and Dean, his face lights up and he comes to them quickly. "Pakhan, it's great to see you!"
“You know, I was going to be nice and say you didn’t look 15 years older than me, but now?” Castiel squints at him, looks him over diligently. “I think you overestimate yourself. I would say 20 years.”
Dean stuffs a forkful of rice and chicken into his mouth glancing to his brother. “Yeah, remind me again how the hell that happened.”
Before anyone could reply, all of their phones start to vibrate and a warning sound goes off. Dean furrows his brows and checks what’s going on. There is a flood warning on his phone’s screen.
“Ah, it’s not a big deal.” Dean spreads his legs so his knee is brushing up against Castiel’s. It’s very distracting. “What’s your name? I’m Dean.”
There is a long pause, Cas not saying anything else as he lefts Dean process whatever it is he's thinking. When Dean speaks up again, it's quieter than usual. "So, you … are you bi, or-?"
“And I’ve had time to recover.” Just when it looks like Sam is about to object again, Dean interjects. “I know I’m not as smart as you, or maybe even as good a fighter, but I want to do
Dean beams and stands up, Cas following his eager boy- his date over to the group of men. They stop a few feet from the group and they all turn to the pair.
Dean says hurriedly, “Would you like to get dinner … sometime … with me … maybe?”
“You got everything in there?” Benny asks, nodding to the bag.
Castiel’s eyes snap to his brother with a glare for putting Dean on the spot like that. “Gabriel.”
Cas’ eyes widen quickly and he looks up to meet Dean’s concerned and slightly annoyed eyes. “No! Not … nothing like that. That just isn’t how I want to come out to them.” Castiel takes a sip of his coffee. “It’s just nerve-wracking to think about telling them because I don’t know how they’ll react. Gabriel is always trying to get me to get together with women. He says I need to ‘loosen up’ and ‘let loose.’ It’s incredibly awkward since he thinks I’m just shy.”
Ты прекрасна, - You’re beautiful,
"To make Dean not the only one so exposed right now,” Gabriel starts, looking into Sam's eyes. “I'm pretty sure, and when I say pretty sure I mean like 99.9% sure Castiel has a thing for Dean."
Charlie has a sly smirk spread across her lips as if she can see through him like glass. “Is that so?”
Castiel rolls his eyes and he feels his phone buzz in his pocket. Wondering who it could be, he opens digs it out and opens it.
“Dean, are you hurt?”
Dean hates that sound coming from him, especially accompanied by that scent. His instincts are going crazy, telling him to do something. Help his alpha, comfort him. Dean’s heart is beating rapidly in his chest, and he wonders if Cas is able to feel it. Steadying his breath, he says, “I will, Alpha, promise.”
Dean knows that the winner of the game gets 500 dollars and some special prize, but still. Sam much really want Dean to win that money. He’s not going to lie, it would definitely help them out quite a bit.
“I was about to do no such thing.” He glares at Charlie. “It isn’t important. It was a one-time thing.” Even though he’s pretty sure it wasn’t since Dean called him babe. Does that word mean they’re dating now? Does that word hold that much power? He tries to imagine someone calling their one night stands babe in the way Dean had but just doesn't feel right. Also not to mention he really wants to see him again. Maybe Dean doesn't want it to be a fling either and that was him hinting at something.
He tried to forget about it so he can be professional, but he met his favorite actor. That isn’t easily forgotten, and really he doesn’t want to forget it.
A frown creases between Dean’s brows. “You think they’d be homophobic?”
But as for updates, I'm probably gonna be slow for a little while again. I'm in the process of moving on top of still having school and work, so I apologize for any long wait!
"Benny," Cas says before stopping in front of him. "I need you to take Dean to his apartment so he can retrieve his things. You are to bring him back here afterwards and help him get settled. I won't be able to be here, something has come up that needs my attention."
. I wanted to see if the umbrellas could work as a parachute.”
There are rooms all that Dean assumes are bedrooms. There is one more flight of stairs that looks to lead to a single room. It must be the master bedroom. Dean glances around and picks one of the rooms. It’s the furthest from the stairs.
“Whatever just happened, wherever you went?” Dean’s thumb brushes over his cheekbone softly. “You don’t have to tell me, but I need you to know that I’m not gonna run away if you decide to tell me.”
Gabriel sees Dean eyeing up the food as if it's his prey and decides to put him out of his misery. "You going to stare at it all day or are you going to go get some before you start drooling all over my shoes?"
Meg watches him. They're both silent for a few minutes before she breaks the silence. "You know, you can tell him you're in a relationship."
What if, by trying to protect himself and his kit, he put them both in harm’s way? What if Cas kicks him out and breaks their agreement? Dean will be all on his own again and he won’t have any protection for his kit.
" When he sees them all finish writing he says, "Do any of you need that repeated?" One of the women nod and Gabriel repeats the first part slowly.
“I wasn’t outside for that long, Dean, I’m alright.” Cas leans further into him, despite his words. They remain like that for a while in blissful silence. Castiel relishes in the man’s touch grounding him. Dean is the one to break the silence a little while later, once Castiel has stopped shivering.
“Okay, okay, just casually bring up the conversation. Subtly bring up a past relationship you had with a guy. Easy enough, right?"
He doesn’t know where or when it happened, but it did. The jealousy wasn’t from the mating, it was from himself.
“You were a prostitute?”
“Hell if I know, I just fucking do what he says,” Bartholomew scoffs and sighs.
"Bite me, Sam."
Dean stares into his eyes for a moment before the whole situation begins to become too raw and emotional for him, and he has to look away from his piercing blue eyes. "Well to society, adults aren't supposed to be," he motions to all of him. "like this. They're supposed to be responsible and have socially acceptable interests or hobbies."
“Well in that case,” Dean leans back in, unlike he did with his brother. “Did you want to come over and watch a movie?”
Finally got this chapter complete! It took a turn that I didn't think it was going to take, but that's writing for you xD the characters take you places you didn't see coming. I hope you like it, and thank you all for reading and leaving feedback!
“I’m so jealous.” She grumbles. “I want to go to a Mishapocalypse convention.” She sighs resting her cheek on the heel of her hand. “So, what hotel are you going to be staying at? Unless you’re staying at home since it isn’t far away.”
Great plan, Winchester.
The night goes by quickly with Balthazar and Gabriel taking the lead in the conversation. When dinner is over, Castiel walks Dean to the door and the older man turns to him when they reach it.
The look on Dean’s face can be described as nothing other than poorly concealed irritation. But he smiles anyway, holding out his hand. “Name’s Dean. I’m Cas’ boyfriend.”
The whole ride home, Sam noticed something … off about Dean, but he keeps his mouth shut until they get home. Dean is in the living room, flopped out on the couch when Sam speaks up, sitting in the chair beside him.
his omega wanted to eat there aside from telling April to stay back. Which further confused Castiel because Dean has made it clear he doesn’t care too much about being Castiel’s mate. Castiel has been trying to get the omega to see he isn’t
Dean smiles, “I’ll keep that in mind if I ever want to see the man who tortured me for years.”
“I would feel better if you would consider dating someone else,” Michael says.
” Balthazar sighs.
"Oh, I'm not staying here. My brother is."
"Hey, no worries." Dean waves it off. "Things come up, it's no big deal."
“Yeah, that’s how he got sick.”
Matt simply stares into his blue eyes leaning back in his chair folding his hands over his stomach. “We found them.” Misha thins his lips and nods not saying anything, a far off look in his eyes. “If you can’t detach yourself from it, I can have someone else do it.”
Castiel frowns, watching him. He seems tense about something, maybe even a bit angry. Maybe he’s angry about Gabriel inviting himself into the conversation. Wanting to do something to help, Castiel stretches his leg out and hooks their ankles together like Dean had a moment before. When their ankles link, Dean smiles at Gabriel, but Castiel knows that smile is for him and it sends warmth unfurling through his body.
Dean doesn't need to be prompted any further before he's at the table with a paper plate in hand. Sam huffs a laugh at how eager Dean is about his food. That man is like an endless pit. While Dean is occupied with the thought of food, Sam uses this time to talk to Gabriel about Team E.L.
Also, the dialogue in italics is when they’re speaking in Russian. And just as a warning, this chapter is gonna have some torture, just as a warning.
Before Gabriel has time to say anything, Sam walks up to them with a surprised look on his face. "Gabriel, you're staying at this hotel?"
The curtains are torn.
His voice is deeper than before and it has Castiel scrambling to obey. When he does, Dean brings his clean hand up and pulls him back in to keep kissing and Castiel goes along happily. He enjoys kissing Dean. The feeling of his plush lips pressed against his own. Dean’s hand wraps around them both, successfully snapping Castiel out of his thoughts. It has him breaking away to gasp and he arches into the touch, bucking his hips to get more friction.
Castiel rolls his eyes fondly and turns his attention back to Dean. The man is watching him, and he smiles when they make eye contact.
Castiel takes in a shuddering breath. Next time couldn’t come any sooner.
Doing everything in his power to quell his nerves, he leads Dean through the warehouse until they come to a set that is rather far away from where everyone is currently. Dean's eyes shine with delight when they stop in front of it, the lights are turned off so it was dark, but Dean knows this set like the back of his hand. It's Misha's living room.
Not long after his little argument — if you can call it an argument — with Sam, Dean decided he needed to get out of the house to finish grading those damn papers. He tried doing them on the couch but he just couldn’t concentrate, so what better place to clear his mind than his favorite little late night cafe, Gabe’s Coffee. The cafe that Dean in currently sitting out front of in Baby. The cafe has some of the best coffee Dean has had in a long time, and it is the only coffee that can actually keep Dean awake through grading papers. He has to admit, at first he only came to check out this cafe because he heard Castiel’s brother was its owner, but after coming here he actually found he liked the shop.
Dean’s heart sinks to his stomach and he straightens up in the bed, hearing those words come out of Alistair's mouth.
"There's no doubt this is going to exceed all expectations." Dean grabs his utensils as well and cuts into the piece of meat, and when he takes a bite, the taste is beyond what he expected. By far the best steak he's ever had. He can't stop the quiet moan from escaping him as he savors the taste. He looks up and sees Cas a little shocked by Dean's moan and Dean laughs. "Sorry, It's just really fucking good."
Dean grins and looks at Castiel. “Well, you did a great job, Cas.”
There’s a mole.
"No, he didn't."
The two of them continue to talk to one another, the conversation taking a few interesting twists and turns. Dean learns that this is, in fact, Cas' trailer he uses for everything. Dean also learns that Cas never watches movies and has only seen a few from when Gabriel forced him to watch them with him, Dean vowed to change that. But when the conversation turns to family, something Dean loves and hates to talk about at the same time, Cas becomes a little more serious.
"Can I come to your place?" Castiel asks so quietly that he can barely hear himself over the rumble of the Impala. Dean doesn’t say anything immediately like Castiel was hoping and his stomach twists nervously. He pulls away a little to look at him. He’s looking at Castiel with a contemplative expression on his features. Castiel puts his hand on Dean’s chest and licks his lips in a nervous gesture. “Please.”
Dean groans as well. “No. Remind me to never have them write a paper again. I regret even thinking about it.”
Dean also assumes that he can expect this to happen a lot. Cas disappearing at all times because duty calls. That's a good thing though, he can use that to his advantage, so long as he's careful since he doesn't know what Castiel will return.
"Did you fall asleep with your eyes open or are you dead?" Dean throws the towel over the back of the chair at the desk and when there is only a small grunt from his brother, Dean turns back around and waves a hand over his eyes. "Earth to Sammy, should I start digging a grave?"
Gabriel rolls his eyes and crosses his arms, clearly not buying that Dean had no clue what he is talking about. “Oh, come on, I know you’re a fan of Mishapocalypse from the reaction to seeing Cassie here. There is a convention for it next week, don’t tell me you didn’t know.”
Castiel narrows his eyes and glares at both men. "You're both cheap."
,” Balthazar says before stepping aside.
Castiel turns his smile at him. “Ten years can do a lot to the body. You really think you can still keep up with somebody so much younger?” Castiel teases, trying not to let on how much thinking about this is affecting him. Honestly, he’s impressed that he’s been able to keep this up as long as he has been.
Fuck.
Dean’s hands run up Castiel’s thighs and grip his hips tightly. He nips at Castiel’s lips and his words come out in a purr, “Anything for you, baby.”
Dean looks at him, letting the scent from the plants soothe his nerves. “I don’t have a good experience with collars.”
*****
“Did, uh, did you find who did it?” Dean says, as he picks up a piece of bacon and starts nibbling on it as a distraction.
Gabriel arches a brow. "What ticket do you have?"
"No," Dean says at the same time as Cas. They look to each other for a second and Dean is the first to look at Gabriel. "It's fine, Gabriel. I get to see him later anyway." Dean says with a smile. "I'm sure Sam is wondering if you kidnapped me, so I should probably get back to him now anyway."
And before they know it, it's the last day of the Mishapocalypse convention, running to try and make it in time for the trivia game. Sam is practically dragging his brother. Last night when he was texting Jess, she accidentally let it slip that the special prize that comes along with the trivia game is a dinner with Castiel, and Sam is going to get Dean into that game if it's the last thing he does.
Dean chuckles. “I mean, I’ll never turn down good food.”
A.R.T.s
Gabriel looks over at the counter like he truly forgot he was working and jolts out of the booth with a hurried, "See you Sunday, Cassie. Later, Dean-o."
Once they finish their food, Dean sees a group of adult men playing a game of soccer in the giant field in front of them. Dean lights up and starts to feel excited as he turns to Cas, trying not to look too excited so he doesn’t pressure Cas into saying yes.
“Cas, what're you doing here?”
Sam huffs a little laugh at how accurate Dean's little act was, but he doesn't need to tell Dean about it and boost his already inflated ego. Sam smiles up at her and Jess waves a little goodbye as he leaves.
Нет, Пахан. Это больше не повторится. - No, Pakhan. It won't happen again.
“What is it?” His voice even lowered into something more serious making his voice almost have a sexual tone to it. It’s gravelly and deep, and it should be illegal.
When Dean gets close, Inias stops talking and Dean cups the back of Castiel’s neck, kissing him hard. Castiel gasps and pushes into the greeting with a quiet whine in the back of his throat. Dean’s hand tightens on the back of his neck. Nipping his bottom lip, Dean pulls back with a wicked grin.
“Would you like more of it?” Cas says when he comes back inside.
Sam laughs bitterly. "No, it's fine. You aren't wrong, not really. And I think if we want to help Dean accept himself, then I'm going to have to work with him about our father. He barely even listens to me when it comes to him, so this is going to be tough."
“Yeah, go ahead.”
The thought of seeing his brother again after so long sends a new wave of nerves rushing through him. He doesn’t know if Sam wants to see him again. If he does, he never showed it. Sam hasn’t tried to contact Dean since Sam left, so it’s very likely that he doesn’t, but Sam has to be safer than living with the Russian Mafia.
A light chuckle escapes past her lips as she signs her name. "I used to have a good friend named Sam." She looks up into his eyes.
Sam goes to say something about it but is cut off by his phone starting to sing to them. He digs it out of his pocket and sees Gabriel calling so he answers it, leaving the kitchen so he can hear Gabriel over Dean’s coughing. “Hello?”
“You wanna talk about what happened?” He says quietly.
Cas turns and starts to leave, but he stops before he gets too far and looks back at Dean. “And don’t let anyone coax you into training.”
Dean brings his hand up and cups his jaw, his thumb working his lip out from between his teeth. “None of that, now.” He locks his eyes with Castiel and Castiel has to fight the urge to drop them. It’s damn hard, but he manages. When Dean sees he has all of his attention he gives a small smile. “I need you to listen to me, Cas, okay?”
"Accidents happen to anyone, Dean." Cas' eyes remain squinted as he tries to figure out what's eating away at Dean, but it appears Dean wants Cas to back off, so he will begrudgingly let it go. Even though he was to get through to Dean, but something tells Cas that now isn't the time. They barely even know each other.
A.R.T.s (Awful Russian Translations) in the end notes!
"I hope it's to your liking," Cas says picking up a fork and knife.
He leans his head back, resting it on the glass as well. He just needs to find a way to make money around here. Cas will more than likely buy him what he needs, but if he wants to leave before his kit is born, he needs to start saving now. A problem with that is his new shadow, Benny. Benny certainly won’t let him whore himself out for cash since he thinks Dean is mated to his boss.
Dean's head turns to Cas, a shocked expression on his face, questioning whether he heard him correctly or not. "You're…"
“I will.” Dean smirks, “Have fun grading those essays.”
"And yet you still won."
"How are you feeling?" Cas asks.
Cas offers out a hand for the bowl. “I can take that to him.”
Sam looks over and his eyes nearly pop out of his head seeing the mud monster Dean became. “Dean, what…”
“No, I’m fine.” Dean glances at Cas, who is standing behind the couch with his wings tucked neatly behind him.
Doing his best, Dean tries to stop thinking about his life and that he most likely made the wrong choice like he always manages to. Because knowing him he is going to ruin the kids’ lives rather than help them like he wants to do, and he is too old now to go back to school and go down a different path.
“No.” Misha meets his eyes, all hints of anything that was there before is gone only leaving determination. “I will do this.” He gives Matt a smile. “I’m going to take pleasure in taking those fools down.”
Dean walks into the trailer and he has to marvel at it for a second before he can continue. It's so much bigger on the inside than Dean ever would have imagined. Not to mention how well decorated it is. The door to the trailer closes and Cas comes up to stand beside Dean. Dean's eyes finally land on the food sitting on the table and he smiles. Damn, that looks good.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I would like to, yes,” Cas says, matter of factly.
She rolls her eyes at him. “Dean, we all know you swear like a sailor.”
Gabriel likes to call it organized chaos. Castiel calls it madness.
Cas smiles widely at how Dean looks like a kid in a candy store. He’d give anything to see Dean look like this. “Of course, I’ve always wanted to try and play a sport.”
Sam shoots a look at Gabriel. "Don't tell anyone." He whispers harshly.
The smirk on Dean’s face turns predatory. “You’re so cute when you blush like that.”
Dean wakes up to the overwhelming need to throw up. He scrambles out of bed and rushes to the bathroom and throws up in the toilet. He groans and spits out the taste in his mouth. He hates throwing up, he always feels even more queasy afterward. He puts a hand on his stomach and leans away from the toilet.
“What did you do?” Cas asks curiously.
Ah… there’s the dreaded question.
Chapter Title: Mr. Mom by Lonestar
Castiel firmly grabs his dirty blonde hair and yanks him up. “Nobody speaks of my mate that way.”
I finished this chapter up just a few minutes ago, so I haven't looked it over for errors yet. That means there will more than likely be some. Other than that, here it is! Enjoy!
Dean shrugs in a relaxed manner. "Really."
His eyes are locked on the tv trying to watch it, but his mind is swimming with regret, like it always is. One the tv there is a woman walking fast paced down a hallway in a business suit and briefcase in hand, but the camera is panned down so the viewers cannot see her face. Dean doesn’t know her, but the way she holds herself high and confident is enough to catch his attention a little more. The screen flicks to a scene in a courtroom and shows a judge in the podium.
"It doesn't matter if they like you or not, it is my decision. It is simply a courtesy to introduce my mate to those closest to me."
There’s the sound of a lighter flicking beside him and Dean looks over. Cas has a cigarette between his fingers and smoke blowing out of his mouth. Dean eyes it, his fingers twitching to take a puff, but he holds back. Just because he quit doesn’t make it easy to be around them.
Cas is quiet for a moment, watching him like he does when Dean starts acting like a skittish alleycat. “Yes,” He says carefully. “It will protect you. All of the omegas in the care of my family have one with our emblem. It isn’t something I am willing to let go, especially if you are out alone.”
"Gabriel," Sam lets out a frustrated groan. "I told you
“E.L?” Castiel scrunches his brows.
Cas sees his smile and part of him is relieved. "I wasn't sure what you would like to eat, but I remembered you told me you liked meat, so I thought steak would be a safe route."
Cas lets Dean order first, and once they've both ordered and paid they sit at a table together and wait for the food to be done.
When Cas and Dean step out of the elevator, Inias, elevator guy, nods to them. The new alpha looks at them, his eyes scanning over Dean for a second before looking back at Cas.
“If you say so, but Castiel, you know Gabriel’s friends aren’t always the best. What if this man is simply using y-”
“I don’t let it get the better of me,” Michael says, bringing them back to the topic before, clearly not wanting to let Dean get the best of him. “There are cases that appear to be a lost cause, but they’re never
Castiel narrows his eyes at his brother walking back over to the counter. When Gabriel meets his eyes he smirks. “If you keep your face like that it’s going to stick eventually.”
"Since I was young. I was in middle school."
He wasn’t surprised, however, when Dean said he wanted to eat there. Castiel can guess that Dean and Samandriel had bonded, and April had been brought up. Everyone knew about her, so it’s not a surprise. What Castiel didn’t understand was
He just met Castiel Novak. He just choked on his coffee and Castiel asked him if he was okay. Castiel’s eyes were on
Sam scoffs and slowly smiles. "It went good, Dean."
Dean grins wide holding up his empty plate in the form of a toast, happily chewing the last bit of food. "On a side note, the food's great."
Dean freezes, his heart lurching and sinking to the pit of his stomach. “I need a collar?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay,” Castiel says with a trembling voice.
“Yes,” Cas nods pulling out his phone and showing Sam the text.
“Thanks, Cassie. Give the boys kisses for me.”
Sweetheart? Who calls him sweetheart? Surely not his brothers- oh! Dean. But Dean isn’t here, is he?
"Oh, you better believe I'm staying." Dean laughs.
Dean looks over at him with a wide grin. "Right back atcha, sweetheart."
Easy.
She shrugs and glances to Gabriel, then back to Sam. “He is his brother.”
“Are you okay, Dean?” Cas asks, his hand on his shoulder.
“I was planning on studying,” Castiel leaves his sentence trailing, hoping Dean catches his unsaid ‘but.’
“Have you found Inias?” Dean asks instead, genuinely hoping for good news.
“No, I should stay here. Dean’s a pain in the ass when he’s sick because he thinks he’s fine
"You don’t know that, Dean. Besides, are you that scared Cas is gonna leave you that you have to scare off all the competition?"
They settle into a comfortable silence after that. Castiel twists his lips and bites his pen. He glances at his watch again. 8:05. He sighs to himself and begins packing his stuff away.
Dean scoffs lightly. "I wasn't mentally prepared for any of that."
Sam’s got his work cut out for him, that's for certain.
Sam shrugs. "Dad liked it."
Cas looks at him and stares for a moment. He looks kind of annoyed. That doesn’t bode well for Dean.
“Adrianne, have you even thought this through? He could be a psychopath or something, really, maybe you should just forget about him. Plus, he probably doesn’t even know you exist.”
.....I really need someone to just kick me in the butt until I finish my WIPs... I'll get there, I swear
As if Dean can read his thoughts, he murmurs, “It’s alright, sweetheart, I’ll teach you. Just go slow.”
Like he was waiting for the command, Castiel comes, arching his back and moaning without a care who could possibly hear him. Dean moans beneath him and clamps his teeth on the meat of Castiel's shoulder roughly as he follows behind him. Castiel's body wracks with shivers and he feels his cock give a valiant twitch in an attempt to get back in the game. Dean releases his shoulder quickly when he seems to realize what he did and kisses the abused spot in apology. Castiel rests his head in the crook of Dean’s neck and basks in the afterglow. Dean holds him close, arms wrapping around Castiel's waist and pulling him to they’re chest to chest.
Sam stops twirling his bottle and looks at Dean, eyes wide. “What?”
Sam furrows his brows. “No, why? What’s in it?”
I honestly have no idea how this fic turned into what it did. It started off as an idea of gentle, plant-loving Cas and sad, lonely Dean. Then Cas turned Russian, then he turned into an alpha, then he became the leader of the mafia without consulting me, then he sprouted wings when I wasn’t paying attention. Then Dean thought it looked fun and grew ears and a tail. Now I’m here.
“If you know, why make me say it?”
Castiel didn't really have a say in hearing what Gabriel had to tell him. He just came into his home and asked if Castiel wanted to help Dean. Castiel, of course, said he would help, but he thought it was a hypothetical question. Gabriel then proceeded to spill everything they had talked about. But Castiel knows Dean doesn't like his privacy being invaded without consent, and everything Gabriel just told him was very private. Castiel knows just how private and terrifying it can be to finally come to terms with sexual preferences, and if Dean isn't ready then he doesn't think they should try pushing him. Things like this take time. Although if he is truly miserable the way he is now like Sam says he is, then maybe giving a little nudge will be okay. Castiel feels a knot growing in his stomach.
Castiel blushes and looks around and hisses at her. “Keep your voice down, Charlie.”
The episode of Mishapocalypse starts off with Misha as his new undercover persona. He's talking with some people, looking cool and collected. He reminds Dean of an Italian gang leader in that suit and slicked back hair. It's a good look on Cas. Not the Italian gang leader thing, the actual look he's wearing is kind of … enticing.
"I like the view," he replies softly.
“What’s so funny?” Cas asks, sounding extremely confused. Dean doesn't have to look at him to know he’s making a face at him.
Now he’s sitting in class, chin resting in his palm as he stares off into space, not bothering to listen as Professor Singer drones on about Zeus being a fuckboy. Typically, this topic would fascinate Castiel endlessly; he's always adored Greek mythology. But right now, all he can focus on is the memory of Dean's, very thorough, goodbye kiss in his Impala when he dropped him off at home.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell, Sam?!” Dean grabs Sam’s arm, trying to stop him, but he doesn’t budge.
Dean nods approvingly crossing his arms over his chest. "It's official, we're now best friends. There is no getting rid of me now, you've dug yourself a hole that there is no escaping from."
Benny starts the car up before pulling away. He glances at Dean in the rearview mirror, once, twice, before, “Tryin’ to quit?” He parrots the beta and Dean wants to laugh, but Benny is looking in the mirror again.
Dean’s brows furrow. “In what?”
Cas’ smile dips a little and a slew of emotions fly past his eyes. “She will be okay, (baby lion). She is strong.”
Sam shakes his head. “Not exactly. We’re still talking about Dean.” Sam gives Charlie a little look telling her not to give Dean's feelings away and she gives him an apologetic stare. Sam sighs rubbing the back of his neck. He feels as though he's exposing his brother's deepest darkest secrets that he most likely doesn't even know he has by doing this, but maybe Charlie is right. Gabriel might be able to help. Sam grumbles to himself for what he's about to do and he meets Gabriel's stare. “Anything you're about to hear from us is strictly meant to stay between us. If you agree to this then I'll let you help.”
“I’m going to find Dimitri,” Adrianne straightens up looking Alex in the eyes. “I’m going to find my brother.” And at that, the scene fades and the credits start to roll.
Dean feels the blush returning, albeit not as fierce as before. “It’s no big deal, just some chicken.”
“Would you like some coffee?” Cas asks, and when Dean looks back at him, he sees Cas watching him.
After that, the women get to work on Cas' hair and makeup. The blonde occasionally flirting with Dean saying he can come by anytime to get his hair and makeup done, and, of course, Dean flirts right back.
Castiel shakes his head. “Not much, I had a …” He has to think about what his first drink was for a moment. “Oh, a Bloody Mary, a White Russian- did you know I’m part Russian?”
“I have to say I’m surprised,” Cas says while Sam goes and gets a bowl for Dean. “He got awfully sick in one night.”
I finished the second chapter in a week! I'll try to keep this up but who knows how it's gonna be when school starts next week. Tell me what you think :) I promise I don't bite!
Dean didn’t know what to expect, but it sure as hell wasn’t this. “Cas, that’s not…” He trails off, unsure of what to say. His instincts are screaming at him to comfort his mate, pull him close and soothe the frustration that is pouring off the alpha in waves.
Sam takes it eagerly and shoves it into Dean's hands. "Thank you! Thank you so much." He then grabs Dean and speed walks to the stage because running is prohibited as he found out yesterday when he and Dean got too excited over something and security yelled at them. When they get to the stage the security man that yelled at them yesterday is standing there, he looks at them and Sam points to Dean. "He's a contestant."
“Just, tell him you're into guys too. Give him a sales pitch, something like why only go after women when you can have both? The more the merrier, right?”
So the immediate reaction his heart had to Castiel was a shock to Dean, and from that moment till the end of the episode he acted as if the show wasn’t anything special. It was simply ‘okay’, but in honesty, whether it was because of Castiel or the fact the show was actually amazing, he rather enjoyed the first episode and knew he’d enjoy binging the seasons beforehand.
Although because he does this, his brother calls him emotionally constipated, which got a chuckle out of Dean the first time he heard it.
Dean scoffs. "Are you kidding? I fucking loved it, Sammy."
“So that means you don’t stay in an area long?” Luke asks.
Cas gives a quick smirk. “I was going easy on you.” and leaves as soon as he says that.
He resolutely ignores his thoughts and looks out the expansive windows. The view out the floor to ceiling windows is breathtaking. He feels like he’s gaping, but he doesn’t bother trying to correct himself. The living room is overlooking a large river and off to the side is some park that would undoubtedly be vibrant in Spring. It must look gorgeous.
Dean has to admit, the blonde is attractive, and her flirting is appreciated, but for reasons other than most would think. If it weren't for her flirting, Dean wouldn't have anything else to focus on besides Cas leaning back in a black leather chair getting pampered and cleaned up, and Dean would most likely be drooling. They would have to ask him to leave, and that would make him sad.
"And what if you tell him later when he's fallen in love with you but instead of joining you, he's scared shitless? You're gonna break both of your hearts in the process."
“It’s very rewarding when we catch the bad guy.” Michael stabs a piece of chicken. “And I’m very good at my job, so I get rewarded a lot.”
Dean narrows his eyes. “Don’t you judge me. The kid wants what he wants.” He emphasizes his point by taking another bar and drizzling more ketchup on it, taking a bite. Cas walks toward him, eyeing the bar some more. Dean smiles, holding it to Cas’ face. “Open.”
"You could say that," Sam chuckles opening the fridge. "Want anything to drink?"
Taking a steadying breath, he pulls Dean’s boxers down under his balls, his cock bouncing once it’s released from its confines. He hesitates when he comes face to face with Dean’s erect cock standing proudly.
Dean snaps around looking into Gabriel’s brown eyes. “Gabriel,” Dean sighs in relief. “You wouldn’t have happened to find any graded essays laying around, would you?”
Charlie worries at her nails as she listens to Gabriel talk, something not sitting right with her. “Is it okay for you to be telling us this? It seems Castiel doesn’t want people to know.”
Dean pulls his monstrous, yet beautiful, car up to the curb just outside the building Castiel’s class is in. When Castiel told Dean how much he liked his car, Dean had taken it upon himself to show him his appreciation. After that, Dean’s been smiling the whole ride over to the campus, sneaking glances at him every so often and giving him the everyone’s-gonna-know-you-got-some face. Castiel ends up playfully slapping his arm at least three times because of it, which only serves to make the older man belt out a hearty laugh.
“You don’t look happy about it.”
Cas meets his eyes and stares for a while like he's trying to divulge if Dean is being serious. He nods, continuing down the stairs. "Okay."
Gabriel cracks a wide smile at his brother's irritation. “That's what brothers are for. Welcome to team E.L.”
“So she’s making a demand that we attend her wedding?” Dean asks, popping another kit kat in his mouth.
The water pressure and hot water is nice. It’s a really nice change from his shitty apartment. He doesn't rush his shower, soaking up the comfort it's bringing him. He actually starts to feel better after a little while. When he finally gets out, he dries off and looks at his profile in the mirror. The baby bump is almost invisible. If anything, it just makes him look like he's had one too many burgers. He's not naive enough to think he'll remain this flat forever, but he could start wearing baggy clothing.
Castiel glares at her- “I will … later.” Meg laughs and thankfully Professor Singer walks in before she can say anything, saving him from further interrogation.
Finally got chapter 2 written xD, I'm already off to a bad start on the whole updating once a week thing, but I hope you enjoy this chapter! Leave a comment if you enjoyed it, or if you didn't, that's cool too xD
“Alright, see ya, Cas.”
Castiel pulls his bottom lip between his teeth for a second thinking about Dean. It felt like they had a moment when they were looking into each other’s eyes, but Castiel has to assume Dean only likes him as Misha considering Dean doesn’t really know him. But who is Castiel to say Dean even likes men in that way? Dean probably was just excited to meet Castiel because he is a fan, and Castiel was just projecting his own desires into Dean’s eyes.
*****
“It would be no big deal, but yes you can get them online.”
Dean forces his ears to stand upright again and he chews his lip. "So, uh, if your family doesn't like me, what happens?"
Inias nods, looking Dean over while opening the elevator. Put up with being stared at, Dean stares back while he steps in the elevator. Inias meets his eyes and when he sees Dean staring back, his eyes widen and he quickly looks away like he’s afraid of something. He can’t be scared of Dean. Perhaps everyone does already know about him being Castiel’s potential mate. Castiel did say something about his men being anxious that he didn’t have a mate. So maybe the fact that Dean is an omega and he’s going to meet their boss, in the privacy of his home, makes them curious.
Cas' expression becomes nervous again. "Is that bad?"
Aaaand Cas feels sick again.
A body slides into the booth across from Castiel, successfully pulling him from his thoughts. With a sigh, Castiel keeps his face in his hands while he groans, “Gabriel,” He then looks up to ask him to give him some space, to not be himself for one day. That all dies on his tongue when he sees the freckled man sitting across from him. “Dean,” He says breathily.
Sam is hot on his heels, getting in the passenger side before Dean can even shut his door. “I’m being a hell of a lot more mature than you in this moment.”
Dean snaps himself out of his thoughts, trying to wipe the smile from himself, but he only half succeeds. He turns his eyes to his brother, who is staring at him curiously. "Why do you think something's up?"
Honestly, this convention couldn’t have fallen on a better date, and the fact it’s only a thirty minute drive from where they live is awesome.
Dean rushes to the office and opens the door, not caring what was going on on the other side. He probably should be more careful because for all he knows, Cas was the one getting shot and the shooter could be coming for him next. Luckily, this time, it was Cas doing the shooting.
And one second he gets.
Dean's smile falls and he huffs petulantly and starts making his way upstairs mumbling something about him coming into his house and ordering him around, but he goes anyway. Cas smiles and watches him disappear up the steps before looking over to Sam. Sam looks impressed that Cas got Dean to go to his room on the first try, but then again, it was for food; food that Cas made specifically for him.
Out where Dean is waiting for Sam, he finally sees his brother emerge from the crowd and Dean excitedly stands from his seat and claps his hands together approaching Sam. "How'd it go? You kill it in there? Of course you did, you didn't come out crying. Way to go, Sammy!" Dean wraps an arm around Sam's neck and pulls him down to mess up his hair.
Castiel clenches his legs as his cock twitches in its confines, he’s already hard. He’s never been more embarrassed … okay, maybe there was one other time, but that doesn’t matter. He swallows and opens his mouth to speak, but it looks like the cat’s got his tongue because nothing comes out. He closes his mouth and drops his eyes to Dean’s broad shoulders and toned chest. He wants to, God does he want to, but he feels so completely inadequate to this man. The experience he must have would put Castiel to shame.
Sam shakes his head. “We can't all just start bombarding him with ‘being gay is okay’ things because he will catch on and know we're up to something.”
Yes, he is a man.
If the state of the house is anything to go by, he didn’t go easy. Of course he didn’t, he was raised in the Bratva. Castiel knows Inias well, he was one of his closest friends growing up. That has to be the reason Alistair targeted Inias specifically. He had to of found out somehow.
“Though Dean here,” Sam starts with a smile to his brother and Dean quickly cuts him off.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That makes absolutely no sense!"
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice wobbles even to his own ears.
“Promise me you’ll tell me if I do something wrong,” Cas says, voice sounding desperate.
Dean looks to his right, where he has to go to get back to the hotel, then back to Cas' eyes. They appear dark because it's night outside, but Dean is still able to see some blue because of the nearby streetlamp. "Well," Dean sighs rubbing the back of his neck. "Looks like this is where we part ways."
“Dean, you weren’t giving me much choice. Now be quiet and let Charlie work her magic, you’re not calling this date off after everything we’ve been through.”
"Great," Gabriel claps his hands against the table, standing up with a smile. "You two talk out a plan, I, unfortunately, have to get back to work. Fill me in with the deets later." Sam nods to him while he turns away and leaves the two alone again.
That must have been what he was waiting for because he closes the distance between them after that. Their lips brush lightly, just a barely-there touch. Castiel takes a shaky breath in and surges in, his arms wrapping around Dean’s neck. He can feel Dean break out into a smile in their kiss and it makes Castiel’s stomach butterflies return.
Dean chuckles, brushing his knuckles over Castiel’s cheek. “I’ve faced worse. Besides, it was worth it for you.”
Cas obliges. He cups the back of Dean’s neck, hand covering the pressure point, and his lips press softly against Dean’s. Dean leans into him more, his hands coming up to grab at the alpha, pulling him closer, trying to entice him. Cas nips at Dean’s bottom lip and Dean opens up for him. Cas explores Dean’s mouth, hands getting a grip in Dean’s hair.
Cas smiles at him. “Good, I’m glad to see Red hasn’t affected your appetite.”
Dean lets out a sigh running a hand through his hair as he leans back on the couch. "I know, I'm sorry."
As the two are sitting in their seats, and people are slowly trickling in, Dean spots movement from up on the stage, so his eyes dart to it. On the stage is Gabriel walking quickly across it trying to get to the other side. He glances out to the chairs for a quick second then turns back forward, but then he stops and does a double take. He squints his eyes and stops walking, and when he knows for sure it's Dean and Sam he waves enthusiastically at them before strolling behind stage again.
Castiel rolls his eyes, not saying anything. He’s not in the mood to deal with his brother right now. In fact, he would much rather curl up in Dean’s arms in bed and fall asleep. He seems to have lost the last of his energy for today. Perhaps Balthazar would be okay with getting a cab home. Or he can call Gabriel. Or Luke if he’s willing to get his ear chewed off. Or Michael if he wants the other ear chewed off.
Tonight was a good night.
Я очень доверяю тебе. Скажите, разве я ошибаюсь? - I put a lot of trust in you. Tell me, am I wrong to do so?
Inias is laughing while he goes to make his order. Balthazar is still staring at him like he’s some mythical beast and it’s starting to make Castiel’s skin prickle. He’s feeling irritable, but he doesn’t want to snap at his brother.
Dean grumbles to himself.
“Why do you always think I’m plotting something? Can’t I just do something for my best friend without you criticizing me?”
Dean smirks internally, gleefully taking another pull as he basks in his brother’s annoyance. “You’re always in the car.”
They should talk, too, but the thought makes him feel uncomfortable. He doesn’t want to talk about what he said last night, because he can’t answer what Cas probably wants to know. He doesn’t know what possessed him to ask if Cas hated him. He can only assume it was between the stress, jealousy, and being drugged, that his brain thought it was a good idea to say that.
Dean smirks, only pushing the bar closer. Cas opens, taking the last bit of the kit kat, chewing slowly. His brows raise, and a small smile rises on his face. “That is not horrible.”
“Night, Cas.”
Dean's heart plummets. He should have figured Cas would want to talk about that. Dean takes a couple of steadying breaths before meeting his eyes. Cas appears calm and his scent isn't giving anything away. This is like a business transaction to him, of course he isn't gonna show anything.
Dean still wants to choke the man. "People never just ‘let it go’. By the looks of it, he's been going after Cas for a while now. It needs to stop."
Gabriel has to admit though, he does want to tell Castiel about Dean liking him. Cas wants Dean to fell for him so desperately, Gabriel can see it in his eyes, but Cas would never believe him even though it's the truth. Although getting into a relationship wouldn't be the best for Dean right now, and the relationship would be very fragile since Dean still doesn't know his he likes men. So the plan? Get Dean to accept his non-straight thoughts, then get Cas to admit he likes Dean, then get them together.
“Don’t worry, I’ll protect you from the monsters, Cas.” Dean cracks a wider smile at him when Cas blushes. The both of them sit in a comfortable silence for a few seconds before Cas speaks again.
Cas snaps his mouth shut. "I'm sorry."
Dean marginally flinches when Cas starts to talk again. “Is this why you wear scent neutralizers?”
Dean thins his lips, nodding, relieved that Meg is going to be okay, but also feeling guilty. Guilty that he thought so poorly of her last night, and guilty because this is happening because of him. “Is that what you did last night?”
As the minutes tick by and the time comes closer to tell Castiel about his kit, the more Dean wants to back out. It would be hard not to tell the alpha considering he will eventually start showing. The thing is, if he isn't going to tell Casriel, he's going to need to come up with something else to tell him since he told Castiel he had news he needed to fill him in on. Most of the time, Dean is good at bullshitting excuses. Hopefully, his skill doesn't fail him now.
“Why’re you awake?” He asks, his voice is loud in the quiet room.
“There are a couple different types of tickets. There are the normal admission where you won’t get to get autographs and you won’t get any photo ops. If you want to meet the actors then you would have to buy the silver ticket at least, but even then you won’t get to meet all the actors.”
Her eyes crinkle as she keeps smiling, listening to Dean explain everything that went down last night. From grading papers to purchasing the convention tickets.
Date time! This is more of a fluffy chapter, so those of you who like that kind of stuff will hopefully enjoy it. Thank you all for reading and leaving feedback!!
Dean turns around to see Cas smiling at him, meeting his stare. “Hey, Cas.” Dean looks around before meeting his unwavering stare again. “So, where are we going on this little adventure?"
Posting early again because I hate waiting to post chapters, so here it is!
They ended up actually watching a movie. It’s one Castiel has never even heard of, but it’s about a serial killer that lives on a farm. He ended up getting caught in the end and Castiel thins his lips, but he doesn’t bother keeping his thoughts in.
Dean wonders if it’s a pain to get shirts on over his wings or if he dresses just as elegantly as he does everything else.
. You are doing well." Cas' voice is soft as he says this.
I'm back again! I don't mean to go on long breaks like this, but I want to reassure you all once more that I will do everything in my power to keep this story going! I'm not too fond of this chapter, but maybe it's just me since I've been staring at it for weeks on end. Tell me what you think, and thank you for reading!
