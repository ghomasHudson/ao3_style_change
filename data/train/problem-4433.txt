don’t need him to have a mission,” he said, steadying Dean. “I mean, does he know you’d like him around, just because?”
was such a human word, for an emotion Cas wasn’t even supposed to be able to feel. Angels dealt in
It had been Sam who rushed forward first, Sam who sunk to his knees and put a hand to Cas’ forehead, Sam who said “
"You didn't even remember me."
“Oh yeah?” Dean asked, dropping the arm he had pulled across his chest. His other hand tightened around the tire iron that he couldn’t seem to let go of. “When exactly were you planning to tell me?”
“I...didn’t expect you until morning,” Sam said as the three of them made their way inside.
When he’d come to, Cas was heavy in their hands, heavy in the way of stone rather than flesh, despite the warmth emanating from under his red-streaked shirt. They heaved him to his feet with considerable effort. It was only when he swayed into Dean’s space that he saw the bloody pulp where the whites of Cas’ eyes should have been, and the febrile sheen that clouded the blue. It was Sam who noticed the chains.
“Where’d you get those?”
“And they looked for days,” Sam finished. “Nothing.”

“Yeah, you know, the

level work there,” Dean said, appreciatively. “What do you use? X-Ray vision or something?”
“Dean,” Cas’ voice grated through the speaker, “the ghost was here. Get up here now.”
A twin beam of headlights pierced the dark. Dean startled from his distracted rummaging in the trunk. He automatically ran through the weapons he had on hand. Satisfied with their number and effectiveness, he pulled the trunk closed.
(In the past, a match like that would be unthinkable, but then again, Sam is the second son, and the War, which took so many, many lives, made people somehow more pragmatic and more romantic.)

“No, Dean,” Sam said gravely, “She wasn’t wearing a

, the kind of air that they used to warn you about in the old days for containing evil humors. It did terrible things to his skin, at any rate.
“Shut up, it's a classic.”
"Are you seriously trying to play matchmaker with me and your sister right now?"
The trestle had landed on a series of crates and an old wooden steamer trunk. The lids had smashed into tiny pieces of splintered shrapnel. Most appeared to be empty. The steamer trunk, however, held a small skeleton, swathed in yellowed, decaying silk and tangled in yards of netting. About the head there still clung one or two blackened flowers.
Dean groans inwardly. "Don't say true love's kiss."
"Boy, don't you ever leave a note?" Bobby never was one to stand on ceremony.
“If you say so.”
“I mean,” Sam continued, ignoring Dean’s pointed ‘shut-up-Sam’ look. “He’s kind of new to the whole hunting thing, but he, uh, he’s the kind of guy you definitely want at your back. Nobody gets the drop on him, you know? A pro in combat situations.”
“So why’d she end up pulling a
“What
Neither of them spoke for the rest of the drive.
“Well.” He paused to think. “She was wearing some kind of...netting, for lack of a better word.”
But today is still and cloudless. "Cas," he says after a while. "You once said I had no faith, but man, I'm praying now. I need you to hear me."
“Uh,” Dean said, clearing throat. “He’s not much of a...breakfast person. Just coffee. Strong. Lots of sugar.”
“Then I need you to drop me off at the library,” Sam said, taking a bite of toast. “We need to look up old marriage licences issued in the area. We—wow, this is good, Zack, did you

Cas blinked, slightly dazed. Dean instantly knew he wanted to see that look every day for the rest of his life.  His mind helpfully began compiling a list of how this might be accomplished.
and eerily familiar sing-song voice intoned in the back of his mind.
“What, why?” Dean asked.
“Dean, he…” Sam took another breath before continuing. “He asked me something.”
Cas shrugged. “Metatron abandoned it. A woman near Biloxi bought it. Fortunately, there are casinos there.”
Cas clears his throat. "It didn't work."
that he was hallucinating this time and, for one terrible, brief, eternal moment, was sure that he’d done it. He’d plunged that angel blade in until it hit concrete, and now he was doomed to watch Cas plead for help that he would never be able to give.
“Alright,” Zack said, uncertainly. Then more firmly: “But please, that can wait until morning. I want you guys to go over it with a fine tooth comb, and you’ll lose the light in a couple of hours.”
Dean fought for his balance. Around them, the barn began to shudder and groan as though it had just gained sentience and was angry about it.
"She's. She seems to be in some kind of...unbreakable sleep."
“Uh-huh. Like I said.”
, Dean guessed.
Dean laid salt lines around the doors and windows. Sam patrolled the grounds with the EMF meter, which promptly went nuts. Alec watched, leaning against the wall with crossed arms and a raised brow, but said nothing. Dean wondered if the man owned a hairbrush. Or a razor.
policy. He always told himself that it was simply because the place was so
“If,” Dean said, inwardly sighing with relief as a sign appeared, indicating a gas station up ahead.
"I won't marry her," Dean says, louder than he means to.
The key lime pie was pretty good, though.
"I do want to," Cas says quickly. "But I'm not good luck, Dean."
“No, I...much of it is...classified.”
“She was,” Cas said, frowning, looking behind Dean, into the now-empty yard. “She came to the window several times.” He tugged on Dean’s arm. “Come inside.”
“What’s going on?” Cas asked, clutching Dean tighter.
“I know,” Sam said quietly. He seemed shaken, but refused to look away. Dean looked back at the road. “I know that, Dean. But
It was Cas. His eyes darted to Dean’s raised arm, then back to Dean’s face. He didn’t move.
"True love's kiss."
“Did he take a car, at least?” Sam asked, pinching the bridge of his nose.
"No."
“Anything else you noticed? Any detail could help.”
"That's impossible. No one's seen a nymph in 500 years."
“So, how?”
He hadn’t missed the subtle start of surprise when he referred to Cas as ‘a good hunter’, but Cas said nothing and obediently followed behind, with Alec forming the tail of their slightly shambolic parade.
He writes to Anna's father personally, inviting him and his daughter to the Coronation. It's Anna who replies, of course. She sends her father's regrets and her own acceptance. "I have," her letter runs, "something of my brother's that may serve as a gift."
“I thought you knew!” Sam said, holding up his hands. “I swear! That’s why what you said in the car totally threw me.”
“No, it was silent. I don't even know why I woke up, except that it suddenly turned freezing cold.”
“What?”
Anna. Anna is...
he thought, uneasily.) He and Alec turned at the same moment to see Zack watching them from the doorway of his room, wearing an uncharacteristically closed-off expression. “I’m sorry to intrude on your
Zack was an extremely nice man, and Dean he knew shouldn’t wish him out into the cornfield. He really shouldn’t.
In the space before Cas resumes, Dean dimly hears the Nocturn bells. How many is that? He's stuck until the ringing of the Lauds, but is that 6 hours from now, or only 2? The lack of windows is maddening.
Sam was carefully staring out of the window at the monotonous landscape. Southern Georgia slowly melted into Florida, by way of black signs with garish neon lettering. Some advertised the kind of strip clubs that Dean had no desire to investigate. Most, though, seemed to hawk fruit and, bizarrely, fireworks. Dean didn’t want to imagine the mess if
He was only gone a moment, though, before he walked back into the room with a strange look on his face.
“No, it’s cool. It’s fine. I’m just...I’m gonna go for a walk. Check the salt lines again.” He was already to the door. “You two just, uh, you know, go upstairs and
"I know. Sam told me."
,” Sam said. He looked as though Dean had slapped him.
He remembered an increasingly-frantic, increasingly-badly-spelled string of voice messages and texts to Cas that seemed to land in a void. Over 72 hours of radio silence. It had been hard to say which had caused him the rawest panic: that Cas might be dead, or that Cas had finally come to his senses and cut Dean out.
“You’re going to just...stand in our closets and watch us while we try to sleep? Do you have any idea how creepy that sounds?” Alec asked.
“Not any more. But back then it was almost two hundred acres, with a dozen outbuildings. Stables, coach house, even a clock tower.”
“Yes,” Cas said. “But I didn’t mention that.”
was better,” Sam said, narrowing his eyes.
Someone has laid a bouquet of rosemary tied with black ribbon on the gravestone. It could only be Anna; Castiel's father has withdrawn so far into his own mind he might as well not exist.
This time, it
“Ugh, thank
“Alec, he's the architect?” Sam asked, since Zack seemed to have lost his train of thought.
“Baryshnikov, Dean?” Sam asked, with a strange look on his face. “Do you mean Kalashnikov?”
“Yeah,” Dean called, pushing himself away from the hood and walking back towards the house. He didn’t have to check if Cas was behind him. “Yeah, Sam. ‘Oh’ is right.”
“I'm so glad you could make it,” Zack said, suddenly turning serious and exhausted again. “I don't know what I'm going to do. I've sunk so much money into this place already, and the last few days have been...well. Alec is hellbent on heading back up to Sioux Falls as soon as he can, but we've had to take the car to the garage.”
“The husband?” Cas asked, rifling through the rest of the papers.
“Yeah, it's a bitch, but that's life.” Dean said, as amiably as he could. “Anyway, because it's so common, we know how to deal with them. But, you know, women in white, like most ghosts, are revenge-driven.”
twelve times.
“It was impossible not to hear them, Dean.” He turned his head. “They’ve finished.”
in the hunting community. Need some muscle on a tricky case? Call Sam Winchester. He’ll sic his brother on it and get him back on-leash when the job’s done.
Sam nodded, then looked back at the frost-free window. Suddenly his shoulders stiffened. “Crap.”
He’d refused Cas’ offer to heal his face, and Cas had left the next night. How he felt about that didn’t matter either.
The last Nocturn rings.
“Yeah, it’s been a--” The word
Cas' laugh slips silvery through the wall. "Yes."
But Dean is alone, for now, and so he takes a breath and says: "Hi, Cas."
“Good,” Dean said. “Good.”
couldn’t. I’m gonna guess you got your GED on your own initiative, too. Am I right?” Dean gave a bewildered nod. “I thought so. It’s impressive. Be proud.” Alec shrugged at Dean’s dumbstruck face. “Or not. But you know, it’s kind of stupid not to enjoy the benefit of something you’ve earned. Pride’s one of the benefits.”
“Your library has nothing useful on this subject. Plenty about werewolf mating habits though. Which, by the way, what the
“He said he...he said his vessel was fine but his grace was, uh...what was it? Like he’d been put in a blender.”
Cas had opened his mouth to say something else, but Dean shook his head irritably, and whatever thought Cas had died on the tip of his tongue.
He waits. He knows how to read the signs: the flight paths of birds, the sound of thunder; a fox may bring tidings.
uses the same timescale as us? Maybe he doesn't think he's gone that long.” The open door spilled brilliant sunlight across the floor, but the overall gloom hardly lessened. “I’m just saying, Dean. Maybe he’s doing what he believes he’s supposed to be doing. Acting like one of us. Maybe he doesn’t realize that…” Sam sneezed, six times in quick succession. “Damn it! Watch out for brown recluses, by the way. Make sure your cuffs are buttoned.” He wiped his eyes.
about?” Dean asked, bewildered.
A text arrived a week later, as they drove towards Missouri at the behest of Dean’s ‘early warning system’.
“We get a lead, we go. We don’t ask permission. We just leave.”
“How’d your car end up there?”
"No. Either that only works on actual nymphs or..."
“Sorry,” he said. “I’ll, uh...just wash the dishes.”
“What would he possibly need to buy?” Sam wondered. “He doesn’t eat, doesn’t have a car to fill up.”
And then time seemed to eat its own tail, because there was Castiel, flat on his back and bloody as a battle flag. Dean was
“Woah, hey, easy,” Sam said, like he was gentling a spooked animal, as they set Cas down in a chair. “Enochian binding magic?” He paused. “Oh, wow, this is...heavy. Hm, we can probably pick the lock with an angel blade dipped in holy water. I think I know the incantation for this.”  Dean sometimes forgot that Sam spoke Enochian. He’d never bothered to ask where he’d learned it.
“Oh, um.” Zack drank the remainder of his orange juice in one long gulp. “No, actually. Thank the Lord. Not a sign of her all night. I
"Dean?"
“We...uh, we…”
And so, when Castiel went missing, all those years ago, after some of the most intense fighting in living memory, everyone knew he was dead. He was a ferocious fighter and a brilliant tactician but there were none left alive after Azazel and Crowley joined forces.
"A celebrated beauty."
“I asked for access to the Archives directly. I tried to convince them it would be in everyone’s best interest if we worked together on this. But Hannah feels that I’ve...” he paused, and he seemed to have difficulty swallowing for a moment. “Hannah dealt with the angels who attacked me, but she’s unwilling to act as my intercessor anymore.” Again there was that look of despair, though Cas masked it so quickly this time that Dean wouldn’t have noticed if he hadn’t been staring. “Our talks stalled. I created a distraction and I...opened a window, let’s say. A small one. Getting in and out has been a challenge, but I managed.”
, there was that blank expression, the one that spoke volumes in its silence.
“No, Dean, I know that. I do, okay? Trust me. I'm not expecting a ticker-tape parade, but I think people are more forgiving than you give them credit for.” He pointedly ignored Dean's scornful noise. “Especially if we help them rebuild. We have a lot of knowledge between us, you, me and Cas. There has to be
They crept slowly upstairs. “Why aren’t you armed?” Dean hissed. “What if Sam needed backup?” Part of his mind screeched the same question at him, adding
"Oh."
Sam laughs at that, clearly imaging the ordeal a would-be kidnapper would have trying to overpower Dean, and the even greater ordeal of putting up with his personality in close quarters. Bobby glares at him, and he disguises the laugh as a cough.
"Oh," Dean says, "that's good." They'll be in the infirmary. In the morning he'll send a message for them to held for questioning. "I wish I could've seen it."
“The place isn’t that big,” Dean said.
Cas shook his head. “No, I have no idea where he is. They put him with Karen somewhere; I suppose to dissuade him from trying any more heroics.”
“The floor,” Cas said, between gritted teeth. “Bolt it to the floor.”
“And it was a shitty thing for me to do,” Dean snapped, unable to keep his voice from rising. “You know it was. How could you…”
Cas sounds fretful. "I'm sorry I didn't have time to write more. We ran out of time."
“What?”
“A ‘channel’ for...” Dean repeated, flatly. “I hope you don’t mean what I think you mean.”
? Wait, is that what you were listening to in the hall?”
Dean had become, if not fluent, then at least conversant in whatever emotional metric Cas used.
“Go Jacks,” Alec said behind him. Dean could almost see the wry turn of his mouth as he spoke.
“That’s family for you.”  He paused, and his smile turned rueful. “You know, Raphael never put my eye back. It’s a good thing I have others.”
But Zack stopped short. Dean peered over his shoulder anxiously, already on high alert, but the source of Zack's sudden silence was a thoroughly human one: another man, in a state of half-awake, half-dressed disarray. At a guess, Dean would say he was a runner, or a swimmer. He stood, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand for a moment before he noticed them. “Oh!”
He sits, not minding the dust on the hem of his robe.
“You were
The first time they kissed, almost without meaning to; the second time, almost daring each other; the third, with complete purpose. How things changed after that; how Dean became more himself, like part of him had been in hiding until then.
His mind is still racing in ten directions at once. "Cas. What...happened?"
“They didn’t
“Ghost logic, man,” Dean said, wiping stray grains of salt from his hands.
the house. Just not in our rooms.” He frowned.
In the end it was neither, and somehow it didn’t make Dean feel any better.  The fact that Cas was ‘not great’ when he’d finally called was worrying enough. But then came: “It may be some time before we see one another again.” Dean and Sam huddled in a hospital supply room, dealing with the first wave of Darkness-related sickness, and Dean knew, from Cas’ voice, that ‘some time’ meant ‘not in this lifetime’. A part of him shut down, a cell door slamming closed.
“Til they caught you,” Dean said, feeling the bottom drop out of his stomach. “What did they do to you?”
“Um,” Sam said, clearing his throat. “So, do you think we could have a look at that barn sometime this evening?”
“There are
something. With words.”
“Ouch.”
might well be having the same translation issues with
Dean nods, even though Cas can't see it.
Dean hears more noises through the wall, and then stillness. His mind and stomach churn like the sea in a storm, but he holds his tongue; he keeps holding it.
"But she's not a full-blooded nymph," Dean finishes, chewing on his thumbnail as he thinks.
Just as quickly as it appeared, though, the vision of Cas vanishes. Dean can't breathe, can't think, can only run into the storm and call out. Nothing but the thunder answers him, and eventually he goes back inside and stares into the fire until morning.
“Well, uh...see,” Dean hesitated. His modus operandi when dealing with witnesses had always leaned more towards the
“Money?”
“Well,” Zack said, rubbing the back of his neck. “That’s a problem.”
“You know what, forget it, I get what’s going on here.”
“You said she was up there!”
“Yeah, of course,” Sam said, but his placating tone was aimed more at Dean somehow. “No need to rush into things without thinking it through.”
Cas’ answering eye roll was thunderous.  He half-turned on the step, and took his hand out of his pocket.
Per custom, the week after John's burial is Dean's coronation. They build the King's Pyre in the square and burn John's robes in lieu of his body. He was a harsh man and king, born and died in war, but his sacrifice ended it, an so the people revere him, if not love him. (It's a sentiment his sons share.)
“What are you talking about?” Sam asked. “We literally just did that. We’ve been doing it for weeks.”
“Cas. Are you going to…”
Sam rolls his eyes, but produces a pastry wrapped in a cloth from his bag.
“What?” Dean asked, lowering his arm.
“What?
"I need you to understand. You know I've been with a lot of people but you...You were different. I was happy, like I've never been. And I know what my dad would say: 'Your happiness for the good of all the people in the kingdom, no question.' But why? Why'd it have to be you?"
“Sam, he’s barely recovered from that curse bullshit,” Dean said. He felt a strange sensation of panic, beginning to squeeze his heart so hard he was half-afraid it would implode. “You saw how bad he was. You remember what he was like before he left.”
Cas narrowed his eyes as though Dean had uttered a curse. “I don’t
“Do you happen to have any old records on this place?” Sam asked. “It might help us narrow down the most likely suspect for our ghost. You say it was a woman? And she was definitely wearing white?”
“Right,” Cas said. Dean saw his throat work around unvoiced words for a moment. “Dean?” His eyes were very wide in the half light. He looked…uncertain? Frightened? Dean wasn’t sure, but he was suddenly gripped by the need to correct whatever translation Cas was writing out in his head. He nodded, grabbing Cas’ hand and pulling him out into the sunlight.
“According to the newspaper report, they played a game of hide-and-seek after the wedding breakfast. I guess it was a family tradition? You know, if he finds her, he’s destined to be in charge of the marriage. If she stays hidden the whole two hours, she’s wearing the pants.”
Dean saw Zack’s eyes widen at that, but he was already climbing the stairs and didn’t hear the rest of the exchange. Cas had agreed to stay in the bedroom until they had alerted Zack to his presence. He didn’t bother knocking. Cas sat on the edge of the bed, idly looking through Dean’s duffle bag of clothes and supplies.
Dean asked himself, incredulous. He looked at Cas, whose face was a careful, complete blank, the way it hadn’t been in years.
Dean almost retorted that it wasn’t actually all that creepy, thanks, but then he remembered the way he’d given Cas a hard time about doing something similar, and so he said nothing.
When they eventually made it home, Dean stared down at the ruinous pile of books and mementos that still lay undisturbed: a pyre of all his hopes, all his memories, all his softest, secret wishes, reeking of gasoline and blood. He made some joke, or thought he did, anyway.
“What?” Dean asked again. He seemed to be asking that a lot lately.
“Dude,
“How much?”
“Anyway, Dean. Most of the time, I think he’s doing what he thinks we would do. He gets called and he goes. And I mean, he’s an angel. He
"I thought I went crazy when you d—" He falters. "Didn't come back. Now, I'm sure I have." He sits, resting his aching back against the headstone. It's easier if he can't see it. He picks up the rosemary, toying with it.
Dean wakes some time later from the creaking of the rafters. He makes his way to the window and peers into the shapeless dark. Then, a fork of lightning splits the sky, and the dark takes the shape of...Cas. Cas, there, at his window, looking at him with reproachful eyes.
"Me too."
window.”
“Ida Mae Crawford,” Sam said, sliding into the back seat. He’d instinctively gone for shotgun, but hadn’t even blinked when he saw Cas sitting there. He handed Cas the stack of printouts, and accepted some sort of beansprout and spicy kale wrap in return. Apparently even no-horse towns had organic cafes. Rednecks these days. Still, that burger had been pretty decent. “Married Sumner Pierce in the spring of 1926 at the age of 19.” Cas studied the topmost piece of paper, a grainy sepia image of a familiar young woman with a delicately-boned face and wide eyes. She looked very childlike, Dean thought. She wore a veil topped by a froth of small white flowers, and stood next to a tall man with a serious face.
Lisa is kind and strong, and she inherited her late husband's land. He's almost certain Ben is his, and he loves her, sort of, but...
Dean had an unspoken
“When I’d made progress,” Cas said. “When I had good news to bring you, rather than yet another failure.” His eyes flicked to Sam for a moment, the back to Dean, and Dean could almost see him click into Angelic Strategist mode. Assessing. Calculating the best angle to attack a problem. Dean frowned in confusion at, what, exactly Cas needed a strategy for, then realized: it was him. He’d seen that look in Castiel’s face a number of times in the last year and a half.
“The gho--”
“No,” Cas said. “This is safer.” Each breath he drew seemed wet and labored. “Bolt it to the floor.”
"Still righteous as ever."
“Yeah, coming!” Dean shouted, louder than necessary. He dragged his hand across his face and stood, feeling troubled. Cas stood a moment later. Dean stalked out of the room and took two steps into the hallway before a surprised little “Oh! Uh…” made him turn around.
“Ghosts can shiv people?” Zack asked in alarm.
“I was on the swim team,” Alec said, and wow, if they weren’t having a conversation like normal damn human beings. Something in Dean relaxed slightly. “And I graduated with honors from the Architecture program.”
, what the hell’s the
"A baker, huh," Dean says, and there's the bitterness, spilling out. "No ties to the outside world, just a unnoticed little life with your devoted, uh, witch-wife."
“What? I mean it. You come highly recommended, and Jody is an excellent judge of character. So you’re clearly an expert in your field. Which is, ah, let’s say, highly specialized. And you’ve done that without a formal education, off your own back. Most people couldn’t. Hell,
. Have a little faith. We’ll think of something.”
. He wiped his hands on his jeans and wondered if he still had any Purell in the glove box. “And he knows I would, too.”
“God damn it,” he growled. He pulled it out of his pocket with one hand and answered it, unseeing. “
“Thanks, Dean,” Zack said warmly.
“They’re having sex,” Cas said, as he removed the iron knuckles from his hand.
with you? Get over here and help! Shit, he’s out. Dean, he’s burning up.” It was Sam who’d loosened his tie and sent Dean for something to pillow Cas’ head, even though they both knew, logically, that the floor would crack against Cas’ skull rather than the other way around.
“Stupid, yeah, I know. Cas already said.”
“Look, Cas. Nobody wants you around more than I do, okay?”
“There are only two usable bedrooms in the house, and I want you guys in one of them. The third is floor-to-ceiling moving boxes, still.” Zack shrugged. “I figure, she comes to the window, you’ll be there with your, uh, ghost traps or whatever it is you use.”
“Talk about your fixer-upper,” Dean said, under his breath.
“Woah, hey, yeah, don’t worry, we believe you,” Sam said. “We saw her.”
“Unfaithful?” Alec said, drawing back in surprise. “But that’s impossible. I'm not seeing anybody. And I’ve never cheated on anyone in the past, either. Or killed anyone, for that matter.”
Dean didn’t need a light to read the look his brother was giving him. It seemed to turn the air subtly cooler.
?” Alec asked, setting his cup down. “Enough to warrant descriptors such as 'common'?”
“Nothing.” Dean said, looking away. “But I wasn’t punishing him, alright? He knows that.”
Alec accepted it with a blank look. “Thank...you.”
? No, he...” Alec paused to take a sip of coffee. Above the rim of the mug, his eyebrows were drawn tightly together. “He was with someone for a long time. Someone not very nice. But he was faithful to a fault. They broke it off, finally, about nine months ago. That's why he bought this place, you know. So no, we're both single, non-adulterous, non-murderers. Sorry.”
“What?”
to defend himself or flee. The fact that someone had denied him that made Dean’s throat and eyes burn. “Let’s get those off of you right now,” he’d said. But Cas grabbed him with an urgency Dean hadn’t expected. He felt every point of contact like a brand.
“What I don’t understand,” Cas said, as he looked again at the photograph, “is why she appeared to us last night, but not to Zack and Alec.” He looked up. “Or perhaps they just didn’t notice her because they were having sex. It
“Shit.” He didn’t really want to go smashing up the car, and all the windows he’d replaced, but he also didn’t want to get ganked by a ghost. Such were the choices in life.
Wait. "You're quoting lyrics.
“What?” Cas asked, looking bewildered.
The week preceding the Coronation passes in a blur. Dean is weighed and measured by an army of tailors, glovers, hosiers, cordwainers, and other people who make items of clothing he's never even heard of before.
“Biloxi, Mississippi?” Dean asked, still trying to sort out the tumult of noise in his head. “I thought you were upstairs playing badass librarian.”
“Are you Zack, by any chance?” Sam asked smoothly, sparing Dean the indignity of trying to find a comeback sometime this month.
how fucked up that is, man?”
Sam explained their routine with a patience that Dean couldn’t seem to muster, but all Zack said, at the end was: “Well, she’s never actually come
“Yeah.”
"We didn't part on good terms," Cas says, as though he can hear Dean's thoughts. "But I intended to make it up to you when I returned."
The kingdom mourns. Hunter-kings from other countries pay their respects, queens and empresses send gifts, and every flag flies at half-mast. The palace is draped in black, and remains that way until the last of the smoke from the Pyre clears.
“Cast iron.”
Dean rolls his eyes and it feels like rejoicing.
"Tell me what she needs, and I'll get it done."
"Right. It was a self defense mechanism and she...uh. As the men came in, she kissed me, and then fell over. Like she was saying goodbye. Her hair turned white."
,” Dean said. “Nice.”
“Ex-military. He’s just come off a pretty long tour of duty.”
Sam sighed. “Damn it. I knew I should have referred Jody, but she insisted. You're going to be in a pissy mood the whole time, even
All they got was a note on the table, under a red-rimmed coffee cup.
He needed to get out of here and not sit like some dumbfuck teenager in a slasher flick. He drew in a deep breath and prepared himself to run. He grabbed the door handle, and the cold metal bit into his skin. No. Everything was far too quiet, and he couldn’t get a read on where the ghost was. He let go, and cleared a patch from the frost with his sleeve.
“Alec
Dean stumbled over a stray bit of wood, and Sam caught him by the shoulder. It didn’t seem to stop his train of thought, however.
Sam’s gaze dropped to the porch steps and he slouched in on himself for a moment, before taking a breath and straightening back up. “Hey, Cas, good to see you,” Sam said, accomplishing what Dean couldn’t and sounding like an actual functioning adult.
“She pulled a T-Rex move on me in the car,” Dean said, feeling the need to sit down all of a sudden. The bed sagged under his weight.
“You said the ghost was out here.”
“Sam, I appreciate your optimism. Really. I’m glad one of us has some. But you don’t Chernobyl the world and then get high fives just because you contained the leak.” He frowned. “And we haven’t really even contained the leak yet, anyway.”
“As far as we...”
“You were probably screaming in abject terror,” Cas pointed out. “Human beings are fairly unobservant when they do that, in my experience.” He had somehow procured another cup of coffee. This time, he took a sip.
“I’m just thinking,” Sam continued, unperturbed, “that maybe we could use a hand on this one.”
ever went wrong.
Sam shook his head from his spot near the window. The rime of ice was beginning to melt away and the heavy warmth was returning. “Nothing.” He turned to look at them. “She just vanished.”
“Don’t worry,” Dean said, with vehement cheerfulness, “Doing unsafe things in unsafe surroundings is second nature to us.”
“Whoa, whoa, okay,” Dean said, holding his hands out and cringing from inexplicable secondhand embarrassment. “Calm down! It’s not a big deal. Someone needs to be in each of the bedrooms. Sam and I will take one, someone else take the other. Sleep on the floor, share the bed, hang from the rafters. It doesn’t matter. You’re both adults. I put salt lines around the windows, anyway, so she’s not getting in. If she shows up, holler and we’ll come in.”
"They said she's a witch."
with this case,” Cas cut in. He emphasized the words awkwardly, as though he’d only ever read them before.
There was something familiar about the signature of the engine as the car approached, something that made him narrow his eyes as he attempted to place it, then widen them once he did. The dusty gold bulk of a Continental pulled into view and then rumbled to a halt. Dean dropped the tire iron into the grass. The engine switched off, clicking as it began its laborious cool-down process. Dean felt rooted to the spot as a familiar figure emerged and shut the door behind him with a decisive thud.
"Yes," Dean says.
"Yes," Cas says. "Apparently I...remembered my training. Though I didn't realize it until that moment."
“And how,” Sam agreed, with a small uptick of his mouth.
?” Something like anger pricked at Dean’s chest again, but he held it at bay. Sort of. “Seriously? Is that, is that really an appropriate use of your time?”
“Speak of the devil,” Zack said, grinning at him, and then at Sam and Dean. “This is Alec. Alec, these are the guys Jody mentioned. Sam and Dean Winchester. They're here to help with the, uh...phenomena.”
Damn it, Cas knows. There were times, sleeping in the mud before a siege or battle, that he imagined the same thing. He doesn't know which of them would be the witch-wife in this scenario but...
“Sam told me what you asked him. Before you left.”
Sam cracked his neck. “It’s what we do.”
“It’s not his home,” Dean said crossly. They both shoved hard with their shoulders and the doors moaned open. Dean held up a lantern.
"Those poor bastards," Dean says.
Sam shook his head, still looking down. “There have been three suspicious deaths on this parcel of land in the last one hundred and fifty years, but two were men and one was an elderly woman—none of whom match our description.”
“Dean,” he said, as though Dean didn’t have a blunt instrument poised above his head. “Are you okay?”
“No, that honor still goes to Metatron, though I’m right behind on the list. Ironic, really.”
In a sense, he was, he admitted miserably. For nearly two years Dean had been treading water, trying to keep the Mark from dragging him down and drowning him, and he hadn’t exactly succeeded. It had thrown a bloody pall over everything and everyone, even when he managed to keep it under control. It had distorted every interaction he’d had. A lot of times he hadn’t seen people so much as nails to be hammered: a witness who wouldn’t give info, a scumbag who needed a beatdown or a bullet, a friend who wouldn’t get out of his way.
This, this is easier. This is almost—it's almost enough.
Cas shook his head, looking thoughtful. “Ghosts may be driven by emotion, but they’re extremely regimented in their logic. It’s highly unlikely it was a fluke. There’s a pattern here. We’re just not seeing it yet.”
"Hello, Dean."
“What’s the word?” Dean asked.
. He kind of believed the entire state was haunted. Or maybe there was a lingering curse the natives had put in the water, just to spite the Conquistadors for being total dicks. Considering the place was, like, ninety per cent swamp, there was a lot of potentially-cursed water sloshing around. Plus, it was so
“This house predates the town,” Sam said, tipping his head back and staring at the ceiling. “But yeah, we'll go into the local library tomorrow and have a look.”
Zack nodded. “I’ll have Alec make him some pancakes.”
"Hi," he says. "I...got your note."
“Netting, like...a shroud?”
“We can’t burn her in here,” Dean said, hating how ragged his voice sounded. “Whole place’d go up.”
dress. She was wearing a
“Well, damn,” Dean said, pushing away from the table with a show of good cheer. “Compliments to the chef.”
“Wait,” Dean said, noticing Sam’s lack of any input to their conversation. “Did you know about this?”
“Huh?”
“Women in white are actually a pretty common type of ghost.”
, Dean. Poker is a game of strategy as much as chance. I’m just very good at it.”
“De-”
One sunken eye. Impossible to say the color. White wax skin.
"How'd you get your memory back?"
Cassie is married, of course she is, she's a once-in-a-lifetime woman. He should give her husband a title.
Cas pulled away completely, but kept his hand on the small of Dean’s back. The cast iron knuckles he wore dug in slightly. “She must have suffocated within an hour,” he said sombrely.
“Dean, I was going to tell you,” Cas said. Dean tried to ignore the way his imploring look seemed to carry the whole weight of the world in it, pressing against the terminal velocity of Dean’s anger. “It wasn’t Sam’s responsibility, it was mine. I told him I would handle it. I just...didn’t specify when. ”
Dean crushed the paper in his hand, then smoothed it out again. “What the hell’s he thinking? The guy’s held together by Scotch tape and gum at this point, Sam!”
“Well, Dean and I could each take a bedroom and stake it out while you guys are in bed. We’ll stay out of sight.”
"Considering everything that's happened in the last six years, you'll have to be more specific."
“Why would she want revenge on me? I’ve never seen her before in my life!” Alec looked like panic was beginning to claw at him.
“You’re right,” Cas agreed. He removed the knuckles and slipped them into his pocket. “We should take her to where her husband is buried. I think they’ve waited long enough for each other.”
If Zack was surprised to hear that another person had showed up at his home in the middle of the night, he gave no indication. Of course, he had a dazed and dreamy expression that Dean immediately recognized as the
“Really?” Sam asked.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “Young woman in a white dress, wearing some kind of shroud. Just like Alec said.”
“It’d be good to have you along, is all,” Dean said, looking down, after realizing that they’d both been sitting silently for the last few minutes.
The window frosted over again. The ice was thicker now. He shivered in spite of his layers.
Dean scrambled backwards.
Alec looked at him for a long moment, then turned to Sam: “It’s more like she wanted to keep us
"Dean," Cas says. Then again, like he's priming himself to say something: "Dean. No matter else happens, with, um. With your coronation and with...Anna..."
“Oh, don't mind him,” Zack said under his breath, coloring slightly. “He's just...out of sorts. He hasn’t had a cup of coffee in four hours. And dealing with, um, things like this are kind of beyond his remit. I mean, smart like you wouldn't believe. A genius. But, uh, analytical rather than...intuitive.”
“Alright,” Cas said, in a way that meant what he was agreeing to wasn’t actually possible. He looked around the room. “The heat signature in the house, and for the area within the salt lines, seems normal now. I think the ghost may be gone for the moment.”
"Or she was saying goodbye." Dean's nerves fizz with something, joy and fear mingled, something wonderful to the point of pain. Still. "Where is she now?"
He waited.
He blinked back to consciousness in Cas’ arms, staring up at his shocked face.
“Good,” Zack said. “They both looked like they were starving for it.”
“Mmm,” said Zack, thoughtfully. “I think he's asleep. Poor guy hasn't been sleeping well, as you might imagine. Well, neither have I, really. But it doesn't seem to happen during the day, so we've been napping in shifts. He really is...”
“Dean, behind you!” Cas shouted, rushing forward. But it was too late. Dean felt something impossibly cold at his back, and he knew he was done for. His vision whited out for a moment.
“He thinks it will!” Sam amended hastily. “But he said he couldn’t be one hundred percent certain. He was, like, ninety-nine percent sure.”
They’d reached the back of the barn. It looked like it hadn’t been touched in at least 50 years. The darkness seemed to move, though Dean knew that was just his eyes playing tricks. There was no sign of the ghost.
There was frost on the windows. He exhaled slowly, and watched it steam upward.
“Dean, where the hell are you?” Dean saw Sam’s silhouette outlined in the golden square of light from the front door. “Did you...oh.”
“Yeah, I got that.”
The sound of a quiet cough pulled Dean out of his eye-color induced existential crisis. (
“Dean?” Cas tried again, still uncertain.
“Do it or I’ll kill you myself, Dean!”
“Very wise.” The approval in Zack’s voice was clear, and if he noticed the look Dean aimed at Sam, he didn’t comment on it.
"She'd make a fine queen," Cas says.
. We’ll find Metatron. We’ll get you back in Hannah’s good books. We’ll burn away the Darkness. We’ll do all of it. But come home to me,
Dean suddenly realized that this was the first conversation they’d had—really had—since before the Mark was removed. Cas’ return to the Bunker didn’t count. There had been too much blood, and too much to do. Dean made himself pay attention, bit down the automatic desire to cut this conversation off at the knees, like he usually would.
but he ignored it.
“I’ve never modelled underwear in my life. I prefer seven-card stud.” He paused, then said: “Sam and Dean make their money primarily through fraud.”
"I didn't think..."
“How European of us,” Alec said from behind him, coming in from the outside and bringing the smell of the open air in with him. He wiped his feet. “Speaking of dinner. We don’t really have much in the house, but we do have stuff for pancakes. I'll make us some this evening. If there are no objections to having breakfast food at night, that is.”
“Yeah,” Zack said, nodding quickly. He caught Alec’s eye and blushed slightly. “There’s toast, leftover chicken salad. Sorry, it’s not much.” He seemed embarrassed. “I made fresh orange juice, though.” He held up the pitcher like a peace offering.
"But she's from a good family," Cas says, sharply. "Our father not withstanding."
“That’s impossible, it’s out here.”
They both nodded, mutely, and did not look at each other.
the best in the country at this kind of thing. Whatever...this kind of thing actually is.”
“Thanks, that’s, um, that’s very thoughtful,” Zack said, looking a little seasick. “Just...be careful.”
“Dean reads,” Sam said quickly. “Oh. I mean, heh, yeah, turns out your woman in white is actually a woman in a wedding dress.”
There's a muffled crashing sound on the other side of the wall, and Dean presses his ear against it. "Cas, what's going on over there?"
Still, Dean had been there for the majority of Cas’ crash course—he winced internally at the poor phrasing—in humanity. He’d tried to cajole and coax and push him through the highs and lows, with admittedly varying degrees of compassion. But he’d been there, more or less. (
“She said you guys
“Anyway, don’t mind me! I found our little friend,” Sam called with overly-forceful airiness. Dean had perhaps one functioning brain cell left, and it shuddered to life as he took in what Sam meant. Dean turned hazily towards his voice.
“I was,” Cas said, immediately looking elsewhere. “I...my access got revoked. Um. It’s been difficult to convince anyone to speak to me.” He looked at Sam, then, for some reason, and Dean saw real pain in his eyes, genuine distress that Dean automatically sought to remove but couldn’t, because he didn’t know the source. The realization bothered him. Cas looked down for a moment, then back up again: “To tell the truth, I broke in.”
“Oh, no. Alec wants me to go back with him, but...”
Sam looked at him for a long moment. “No idea,” he said slowly. “You know, Dean, I’m thinking.”
“It means,” Dean said, resting his head against Cas’ shoulder, thinking of the word an angel would respond to best, “yes.” He kissed Cas’ neck. “Yes. Come home. I
Cas hadn’t asked again to heal him. Before he’d left the Bunker, he still had that thousand-yard stare you saw sometimes in people who ran towards gunfire for a living. He’d managed to whittle it down to a hundred yards by the night he walked out the door, but Dean suspected that was primarily for his benefit. Cas moved as though every particle of him hurt and it was only through sheer force of will that he held his back straight.
“So,” he said, just as casually, and now the bells were ringing louder, “Are you gonna call Cas?”
“Yeah, as far as we know. Nothing.”
, but it’s getting pretty late and I’d kind of like to get this over with.”
“Well, damn.” Dean said, sliding into a seat. “What about the nearby town?”
“Yeah, sounds good,” Sam agreed.
Dean shook his head, seized by a strange despair. He almost felt as if someone had died. “Sam, look, I can’t…”
"I'm sorry."
“Hey,” Dean said, drawing back slightly, the irritated feeling resurfacing. “No need for that, man.”
“Yeah, I know, Dean. But Jody…Wait, I wasn’t even talking about Jody.” Sam looked frustrated.
"No."
For a moment, Zack's normal chattiness seemed to fail him. Then he cleared his throat and said: “Anyway, Alec, they'd like to ask you a few questions about what you saw.”
“We weren’t having a…” Dean began, but was interrupted (mercifully, for once) by Sam.
. But: “For weeks and months at a time?”
“Yeah, the other night, Alec said he was leaving for Sioux Falls first thing in the morning. Then
On the third night, the Pyre has burned to nothing. The smoke is gone. The King is dead, long live the King. In the morning they'll sweep up the ashes, change the shrouds on the statues from black to white, and hoist the flags. And then the preparations will begin.
“Only because people take advantage of you, Zachary.” Alec had emerged at some point during their hushed exchange, holding a cup of coffee. He closed his eyes and inhaled the steam it emitted. “I hate to see that tender heart of yours get broken.”
"Yes. Wouldn't most people want that?"
"Hard to tell," Cas says, rueful.
Suddenly, Dean wanted very much to not be in this room.
Five years. John can be officially buried—though, of course, his body was never found—as Castiel was, the year previously, in the quiet corner of the Milton family's churchyard, close to the river, where he and Dean spent so many happy hours. He visits Castiel’s grave before he goes on one of his campaigns (each one more dangerous than the last, each time, more reckless), and after, beaten and bloodied but still alive.
Dean tore his gaze away from Cas’ face and down to where Sam was pointing, a silver chain that ended at both wrists and ankles. The sight of it was enough to snap Dean out of whatever mute trance he’d fallen into. Cas needed freedom of movement. He needed to at least have a
“And I’d rather be around,” Cas said. He looked as though he were forming his next words carefully, like a complicated incantation he couldn’t afford to mispronounce. He pressed closer to Dean and opened his mouth to speak again. “I’d rather be with you. I want...”
"I owe her a lot."
we saw her before though. I’d never lie about something like this.”
“So you’re Heaven’s Most Wanted again?” Dean asked.
“An antiques dealer in Mississippi.” He paused, cocking his head like a listening bird, then continued on into the hallway. “I’d say it was fate if I didn’t know your opinion on the subject.” He didn’t look at Dean as he said: “That was unwise, Dean. Next time, just tell me to go.” Cas pushed the door open and walked into the room. The roar in Dean’s head practically drowned out Cas’ query. “Anything?”
“Why me?”
this?—we think the wedding veil our ghost is wearing looks to be circa 1920 or 1930.”
up to Dean. “I didn’t get a chance to do it right.” That was all the warning Cas got before Dean kissed him, pouring out all the longing and hope and frustration he felt in the push and slide of his mouth, his tongue.  It lasted until Dean suddenly remembered to come up for air.
quoting lyrics to
“Cas is a friend of ours,” Dean said quickly, before another staring contest could begin. “Just back from a tour in the military. He came to lend a hand, since, y’know, it’s not your typical woman in white scenario. You can always use another good hunter on a difficult case, right?” Man, now he
“What? Why?” Dean asked, his abortive apology forgotten.
Zack’s hard look fell away in surprise. “Tire...iron?”
"Well, I married one. Or," he pauses, "the granddaughter of one."
"What? No."
“I asked him to stay. I did. But he was worried about distracting me.” Sam’s face twisted at the memory. “I think he didn’t want me to see how bad he was getting. I should have insisted but, well, I didn’t. That’s on me.” He sighed. “And then later, he went on some rogue angel hunt with Hannah, apparently.”
Dean paces fretfully, unthinking, like a caged wolf. The note is crushed in his fist, and he flattens it out to read and re-read. Two lines. It's more than he hoped for, yet it's a new kind of agony. Cas remembers, but does he still...?
, dumbass."
“Of course I remember,” Cas said mildly. He turned his face towards the stars. Dean allowed himself a moment to admire his profile before he averted his gaze.  “He ripped my tongue out. Comparatively gentle to his other available options.”
A trestle beam fell somewhere in the back, a world-ending crash.
“I’d say that’s our next order of business,” Dean said, looking over at him. He was still studying Sam’s paperwork intently.
He's restless. Soaked to the skin and cold, he builds a fire with what little kindling is left in the hearth; strips to his underwear and lays his clothes out to dry. Falls asleep, somehow, under an old blanket, and dreams of Castiel's face....
look, having worn it more than once himself. Well, that explained some yesterday’s weird tension, he guessed.
Suddenly Zack appeared at the table, holding a large tray of sandwiches. “Snack break?” he asked, brightly. “Given how weird our sleep schedule has been, we probably won’t eat dinner until about ten o’clock.”
Dean climbed into the passenger’s seat. He considered for a long moment before writing:
“So you were in separate bedrooms and the ghost appeared to you both at the same time?”
“Yes,” Zack said, coughing a little. There must have been a cold going around, after all. “He's...he's been instrumental in helping me tackle this project. Which isn't easy to do long-distance, as I'm sure you can imagine. When I found that barn, he said he couldn't accurately tell from the pictures if it was worth saving. He wanted to come down and look at it himself. Forbade me from stepping foot in the place til he could see if it was safe. Can you believe it?” He smiled again, as though his face naturally wanted to fall into the expression, and only circumstance was stopping it. “We haven't had a chance to complete the survey. Don't imagine we'll get to, now.”
“Thanks,” Zack said. The sincerity was disturbing.
In the end, it wasn’t even up to Dean. He felt a hand grab and twist at his shirt front, and another pull him forward by the hip. Suddenly Cas’ mouth was on his, firm and sure, a point of shocking heat against the unnatural chill of the barn. Dean felt it down to the soles of his feet.
“Yeah, no, sure, I didn’t mean…”
“I know the feeling,” Dean said. He tried to keep the bitterness out of it, but he wasn’t sure he succeeded.
meets
“I’ll handle it,” Sam said. “I know where the plot is.”
“Sam called,” Cas said. Dean didn’t have to look at him to know he was frowning. “He said you...might need support for this particular case.”
Usually, they arrived in time to quarantine the unlucky one or two whose skin bloomed black, to burn the sickness out of them with holy oil and hope that they had enough of their minds left to eventually return to a semblance of their old life.
a mission. It’s the way he’s wired.”
“Uh, yeah,” Sam said, shaking his head, as if to clear it from a stray thought. “That’s good. And we got a pretty good look at her, too.”
“Iron temporarily dissipates ghosts,” Sam explained. “Same with salt. We’ve got salt shells in the gun, but I’d rather not start shooting up your newly-renovated bedroom.”
?” Dean and Cas asked, in baffled unison. A large piece of equipment fell with a clang.
“Angel blades don’t work on ghosts, Cas.”
“What?”
through the window—though there was no sound.” He shivered. “And yeah, the Realtor gave me everything she had on the place when I bought it. Come inside and I'll let you have a look.” Seeing Dean's dubious expression, he added. “Don't worry. She may not look like much on the outside, but I promise, she's structurally sound. She's had a hard life, but she's got me to look after her now. Ah, but there I go, being a hopeless romantic again.”
“Did I die? Did you bring me back?”
, Dean thought, holding his breath.
“Oh, and you’re not?” Sam asked, gesturing towards the wine colored bruises mottling Dean’s face.
“Sam, what…”
“He needs to have something to do,” Alec said, with a thin-lipped smile. “He doesn’t do well with just...sitting and waiting for things to happen. Man of action, you know.”
, exactly, but in this general geographic area. Correct?”
.” He took in a ragged breath and made himself meet Cas’ eyes. “Okay? Do you understand?”
“Look, just...tell him. Okay?” Sam began hammering at a cupboard with the butt of the shotgun. It splintered on the second hit. Inside there were a row of rusted knives and hooks hanging from the wall. Some had fallen to the ground as the wood rotted away.
Another startled look, this one subsumed by cool detachment, and Dean couldn’t guess the source of either reaction. His ability to read Cas had always been slightly slanted. Cas didn’t map cleanly onto the internal Emotions/Responses Grid that Dean had been using most of his life.
As this strange conversation continues, Dean ends up behind behind the altar. He knocks twice, but this time there's no answer. He does it again. Again, nothing.  Again. The silence grows fangs and threatens to rip him apart.
“What is it, Sam?”
) He’d carved--he’d
“That sounds wonderful, Zack,” Alec said, and he was genuinely beaming, bright blue eyes and a slightly lopsided smile that caused something in Dean’s chest to flutter like a trapped bird in recognition.
The Bunker’s library had offered no hint of how to stop the spread of infection except for the one, oblique reference to holy oil. Thank anyone who wasn’t God that Sam had been able to figure out what it meant. But it didn’t solve the root of the problem.
“No, you didn’t die. She...shoved you into me.”
. But every time Dean had tried to speak that language, the message never stuck. He reminded himself that just because someone wasn’t supposed to feel something, didn’t mean that they didn’t.
“Wait, what?” Sam blinked. That was clearly not the response he’d expected.
He doesn't want to. He wants Castiel. Yet it's the only possible match he can bear to consider, as he watches the smoke die day by day. He'll put it to her at his coronation. But first he'll ask permission. Not from her father, who can't even pretend to care, but from Cas.
“Seems like,” Sam agreed.
“It bothered him to know he did that to you, Dean. You know it did. He kept asking me why you wouldn’t let him heal you.” Sam paused, and a cold realization filled his eyes. He looked at Dean closely. “Were you punishing him?”
“What, Jody? She’s all the way up in the Black Hills with a possible ghoul case! And besides, you know it’s not exactly safe to be crisscrossing the country right now.”
"Shhh. Someone's...Don't say anything."
relatable to you, is it?”
“Uh,” Dean said, catching Sam’s eyes in the rearview mirror. “Yeah, that it can. I...I don’t know, Cas. Maybe it’s a fluke.”
His phone rang again.
"But you did the impossible. Because you're you. And because...you're a dumb son of a bitch who doesn't know when to quit." He laughs, or thinks he does "Anyway, sorry for trying to stab you. I was a little on edge."
"With Sam?" He recalls the bruise blooming on Sam's face.
“God, Gabriel was such a
“You had a run-in with Gabriel here in a few years ago. Well, not
Now he felt like he was starting over again, trying to speak a foreign language after years of disuse.
There was nothing decisive, however, about the way Cas said Dean’s name. They stood by their cars in the dark, like two castaways clinging to rocks, watching each other across a gulf.
“Sure,” Zack said, smiling vaguely into his orange juice.
So Dean wept in private over Castiel and in public over John, and put Sam's education above all things, doing what his father had failed to do when Queen Mary died. Sam was the second son and so had a chance for freedom Dean knew was never his.
“Alec,” Zack said, quietly, but didn’t follow it up with anything. He apparently didn’t need to, for Alec wilted under the one-word rebuke, sinking back into this chair.
That was the last they heard of him for the better part of a week. At least, Dean assumed it was a week. He had very little memory of the intervening days. They’d left the hospital with their nostrils full of the bitter perfume of purified flesh, and then...consciousness seemed to slither in and out of Dean’s grasp. He thought he remembered sprawling face-down in a field of wildflowers. He thought he remembered a woman in a black dress. But he must have been hallucinating.
“Hello,” Alec said slowly.
“Sorry I can’t get any more for you.” He rolled his shoulders. “Being grounded sucks.”
Dean opened his mouth and found, to his surprise, that no protest emerged.
He blinks. "Castiel?"
And Cas was dying. The stolen grace had slowly poisoned him, like transplanted tissue attacking its host. Dean had kind of forgotten that, actually. Until just now.
armed hunters?"
Cas whispers, even lower,"I'm sorry, Dean. Just...wait for me."
“We have an early warning system, remember?” That’s what they were calling it. An early warning system. It was easier to put it in those terms than to admit the residual claim the Mark still had on him, beneath his unblemished skin. It pulled him towards the scene of impending carnage, calling to him:
"Don't be. No one else survived. I shouldn't have either."
Those things all had to do with
“Uh,” Sam said.
“Maybe,” Dean said doubtfully. “But what about last year? You know, when, uh…” He couldn’t finish the thought.
Dean glanced at him from the corner of his eye and saw a strange look pass over Sam's face: there and gone. He could have imagined it.
“Or...y’know, maybe to talk? To see how he's doing?”
“He...” Dean cleared his throat again. Damn it. He needed cough drops or something. “He'd call if he was in real trouble.”
“Flustered?” Dean sputtered. “What...I’m not....”
“Yeah, swell guy,” Dean said. “A real peach compared to the others.”
They’d known enough, though.
“Don’t worry,” Dean said, straightening the cuffs of his over shirt. “I won’t go all Baryshnikov.”
The Darkness, whatever it was, manifested itself in intermittent pockets of wasting and madness. It was like an infection bubbling under the skin of the earth. Occasionally it erupted. Five days ago, they drove towards Carson City while listening to a newscaster describe the scene: an entire street of people, screaming as they ripped the skin from their faces and bodies, before falling over dead. The corpses had all leaked black sludge from their lidless eyes and lipless mouths. People were calling it some kind of Doomsday cult ritual, but Dean knew better. The Nevada hunters had known better, too, even if they didn’t have all the details.
A moment later, though, the wall...responds. Two dull but deliberate bangs vibrate in Dean's ears. He waits for his heart to restart, then repeats the noise he just heard.
"Oh." Cas goes quiet for a worryingly long time. "But Dean..."
bleeding to death or in mortal fucking peril for once,” he said at last. He crushed the paper cup and walked off to throw it away.
“What does that mean?” Cas asked, breathlessly.
“Oh, so you’ll tell Sam but not me?” Dean rounded on Cas, feeling hot stabs of anger and jealousy run through him in turn. It was petulant, it was out of proportion, but he just couldn’t seem to stop the ride. There was too much momentum behind it, and a cliff up ahead. Cliffs called you to jump from them, even when you knew what lay at the bottom.
Dean cleared his throat again. Definitely a cold brewing. “Call Cas? What for?”
“Oh, right! Our uncle Bobby used to take us to see basketball games there sometimes,” Dean said, smiling in earnest.
“He said he didn’t know if the damage would heal.”
“And she was yelling and banging on your window.”
the house. It’s like she just...doesn’t want us in bed. Like she’s trying to get us out of our rooms.”
“I can,” Cas said, “occasionally do things that don’t involve smiting.” The air seemed to grow steadily colder with each word, until Dean expected to see his breath on the next exhale.
“You guys okay?” Dean asked.
“I understand.”
“Trust me, I'm a professional.” But Alec did not seem overly reassured by Dean's smile.
Another tear falls. "I looked for you."
“But you couldn't hear what she was yelling.”
“Oh, that’s...that’s good,” Zack said, blinking as though he had something in his eye. “Excuse me, I’ve just remembered I promised to call Jody with an update.” With that, he got up and made his way into the house.
It was doubtful if much was going to get through to him for the next few hours, but Sam apparently felt the need to explain anyway. “Jody’s never met Cas, but he’s a good guy. He was in the neighborhood and I thought, ‘hey, all hands on deck', right?"
“Yeah, peachy,” Alec said, and his voice seemed to grate through the unfurnished room. He cleared his throat. “I mean, aside from the fact that there’s going to be a
Dean’s eyes had adjusted to the dark enough to see Cas recoil slightly at that and
“Ah,” Zack said. “Like Alec, then.”
“Dean, I left the tire iron in the car.”
“I left Biloxi as soon as you called. Almost.”
Cas drew back slightly, as though he were trying to get a better look at Dean’s face, and Dean fought down the urge to lower his eyes like a Bronze Age shepherd. He realized with a jolt that
“Yeah,” Sam said slowly. “Listen, you, uh, didn’t call for us last night. Does that mean that you didn’t see the ghost?”
Sam regained his feet. He lurched a little, holding his arm. “Kiss him, for fuck’s sake!”
“I’m...It’s nothing a little sleep and Ibuprofen won’t fix,” Dean said defensively.
Cas looked startled, then guilty. “I needed money. She would only take cash.” He frowned a little, into the coffee he wasn’t drinking. “And I need my car if I’m to find Metatron and return him to Heaven. It’s the only way to regain Hannah’s trust.”
“Well, we're experts in this department,” Sam assured him.
“Sure,” Alec said, with a wan smile. “There's coffee in the pot. Help yourselves. Let me get dressed and I'll tell you all about my tale of woe.”
But Pamela is dead, just like Cas, and John, and so many others. Dean will have to figure this out alone. He exhales sharply, nods once, and then leaves the graveyard without looking back.
body,” Cas said. He looked over at Dean quickly, as though to reassure him. “In my true form. I mean, obviously it rendered me speechless here, too. The duct tape was just for, uh, dramatic flair. An object lesson.”
He'll have a year, at most, where he can wave off the question with excuses about settling into the role. But he's been acting in John's place for so long now that people will see it for the lie it is.
He shrugged and looked at Dean again. “But he
"Mm," Cas agrees. "I think they'll recover. Sam was able to, um, prevent me from using the full extent of my expertise."
on the day she got hitched,” Dean asked, “if they were so head-over-heels for each other?”
Cas and Sam. Sam's never been quite as skilled at hand-to-hand as Dean—that explains the black eye—but he's still a deadly force. And Cas.
"I know."
cruel and vindictive, to you and Sam especially. I thought you...that you might need a channel for, um, whatever it is you might be feeling. I can do that for you. I thought that’s why Sam called.”
Dean wants to scream.
“Hey,” Alec kissed him quiet. “You think I’m going to just give up after ten years of waiting? After you finally got out of Linda’s claws? Come
Dean shook his head. “No, I checked. I doubt he’d want us tracing the plates.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, pouring a mug of coffee. “We got well-acquainted with your little Miss Havisham.” He stirred in three spoonfuls of sugar.
"But you did." Their last night together rushes back. It's not a good memory. They fought; over tactics, over Sam's self-sacrificing plan, over the future.
He came back to himself. His hands were white-knuckled on the wheel, and his jaw clicked loudly in his ears as he ground his teeth. Sam was probably looking at him out of the corner of his eye as they passed through seemingly endless miles of pine forest. He took a breath. He loosened his grip and moved one hand down to rest on his thigh, forcing the fingers to unclench.
"I have to go," Cas whispers, urgent.
“Yeah,” Dean said, for lack of anything more eloquent. “Don’t worry about it. I, uh, I’m glad you got your car back.”
“Still, you guys used to talk pretty regularly, but for the last few months...”
“Women in white tend to haunt the unfaithful—you know, murderous lovers, adulterers, people like that,” he said at last.
He looked back up at Cas and was unsurprised to find himself being watched. Cas’ expression shifted again, to something open and intent.
Dean shakes his head. "No, you're not. But give me a room full of all the eligible women and men in this place and...I'd rather have you, cursed or not. Anyway, we're all cursed. Do I seem like good luck to you?"
“Miss Havisham?”
?” Sam asked, all his studied nonchalance giving way to disbelief. “Uh, I dunno, Dean. Maybe to see how his search is going?”
As soon as they were out of sight, Dean pushed him against the side of the house.
“Other...eyes?”
“Very
The gas station came into view: a ramshackle thing with a cracked concrete forecourt and two grimy pumps. A handwritten sign advertised hot coffee; another, a vacancy for a part time cashier. An image of a giant flamingo in the window offered the only splash of color.
“Maybe he’d like a break from, ah, ransacking the Archives, Dean. Maybe he’d like a hunt. Maybe he’d like to feel...Look, I don’t know, just call it a hunch.”
“I considered that,” Cas said, allaying several fears Dean didn’t realize he’d had. “It would have taken too long to clear. When Sam called, I wanted to get here as soon as I could.” He let out a sharp breath and finally looked at Dean. “So I went to the casinos and got the cash together. It wasn’t...I wasn’t shirking my duties, Dean. As soon as I had the five thousand dollars she wanted, I purchased the car and came here.”
