"I knew I shouldn't have said yes when your pops said no about the stupid, sorry Pete." Tony said, putting a hand on his shoulder.
A little more swearing than usual in this chapter, I'll try to update soon!
"Dad!"
"TONY!"
"I told you that you couldn't try on the suit yet!"
“Peter, it’s been a while.”
"He got hit by a taxi while going to get Pizzas," Steve replied sitting down with his now slightly annoyed son still in his arms.
"Alright, I know when I'm needed but not wanted." Wade said, winking at Peter (which thankfully no one noticed) and then he was gone out the window.
"I'm sorry Peter but if you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it."
"That's it, sitting here waiting isn't working. Why don't Tony and I fly around to look for him while you guys wait here and see if he shows up" Rhodey suggested, knowing that if they didn't find Peter soon his best friend was going to have a panic attack."
“Dad? Dad I’m sorry...” Tony watched as his sons web broke and he fell into the water. Tony tried to move to reach his son but he couldn’t, he was frozen. Tony watched as he sunk, then watched as the whole team arrived. Everyone was screaming at him and swearing, but the only one who he looked at was Steve. “You just killed my boy Tony, how can I love you now? He’s gone, Peter is gone, wake up Tony! Peter is gone...”
"Steve when he was just a kid that none of us knew you were fine with him fighting, you saw him as an equal. Don't you think your son deserves that same respect?"
His room was red and blue and in the middle of the room was Peter, showing his aunt Natasha the new book his Papa had brought him the last time he went out of town. Eliana squealed with joy when she saw her aunt and her little brother and managed to wiggle out of Tony's grasp she went over to give her aunt a kiss on the cheek and to go talk to her brother, who upon seeing her immediately stopped talking to Natasha and started talking to her. Tony grinned at the sight and then went to pick up Peter.
"Alright Iron Man, I'm on it." Peter quickly hangs up and turns to Wade.
Peter nods and Wade gets up to jump off the building, turning around one last time to lift his mask up and give Peter a quick kiss on the cheek over his Spidey mask. He then does a soldier salute and jumps off the building, leaving Peter to blush like crazy under his mask.
“When did you take this one? Why have I never seen it before?”
Harry nodded slightly
Bruce walked downstairs with a few sandwiches, "so you're letting Peter try on a suit? Didn't Steve say no?"
Now it was Tony and Steves turn to freeze, once again being reminded of the small girl who constantly had to remind them that although she was tiny, she was mighty. They both quickly shook off the feeling of loss and smiled at their son, each giving him a kiss goodbye and leaving before they actually did take him out of school.
"Sorry, Pete didn't see you there!" Tony walks over and gives Peter a kiss on his forehead, laughing when he sees the slight look of disgust on Peters' face and the blush on Steve's.
"We won't tell, but you have to promise that if things get too crazy in a battle, you'll back off. You'll steer clear of the real threat."
"FUCK YOU NATASHA, NO WE WILL NOT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU LYING TO US ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR KID! HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW?"
“So what brings you here for the first time in what 3 years?” Harry said while looking in the fridge for something that Peter couldn’t quite see.
Peter swung off before his Dad could respond, hoping he would make it home before his Pops and the rest of his family, or before his dad came out of the lab to check on him and Ned.
"Do you think that they will..."
___________________________________
"Sounds perfect babe."
"Honey it's only for a week. Besides, your therapist thought it might be a good idea if we finally started working on the..."
"You know what's crazy?"
"Fine, I promise."
“No. He came here, he was scared and sad. We talked. He left. If I knew any more I would tell you.”
Peter looked down and ran out of the room in tears. He grabbed his suitcase and started putting some of his clothes and the Spider-Man suit he took out of his dad's lab while he was talking with the rest of his family into it. He grabbed a drawing his dad drew of the three of them, a picture of his whole family and a picture of him, Pops, Tony and Ellie and shoved those things in his suitcase as well. The last thing he grabbed was his phone and his phone charger and he shoved his suitcase under his bed, planning to leave that night.
(Peter) "14 months..."
"That's nice of you Tony. The kid seems like he'll be a real help to the team."
"I was thinking in July, right before Peter is a Junior."
Eliana started giggling up a storm, "Daddy! Papa didn't make the icing, we bought it yesterday!"
Harry’s eyes managed to get bigger hearing that it was his dads lab. Peter couldn’t help but stare, Harry’s eyes were such a pretty shade of green.
Ned waved goodbye to Tony as he left and closed the door and then quickly texted Peter.
, any news about Peter?"
Harry smiled and nodded. He handed Peter something he hadn’t seen in a long time, the blue and red stress ball that Harry bought for him when they were 10, and then began to play with his hair. Peter thinks back to the first time they did this, the day Harry bought him the stress ball.
"STEVE! SHUT THE HELL UP! NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. PETER IS HURT, SO ARE YOU, I AM ABOUT TO HAVE A FUCKING PANIC ATTACK. CAN WE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DEAL WITH THIS AT HOME?"
"You're grounded Peter."
"I know that, but you never thought about how fucking hot Thor is?"
He froze. Slowly, he turned around, Natasha and Clint were standing by the door.
"Always. Go take your break Brucey, I'm going to start working on the new suit that I want Peter to help me with.
Peter sighed, relieved that his dads finally left but now realizing that although it was his sophomore year, he was just as nervous as last year. With a deep breath, he walked into the building, hoping the day would go by quickly.
"But Peter, you know how I feel..."
"Can you hack all of the street cameras in New York please?"
"Steve this is one of the top science schools in the country and Peter went here last year. He will be attending it again."
Steve hangs up and looks at Tony, "Peter wants us to come back home, he sounds like he's really upset. I knew this was too long for him."
Steve looked at his son who was trying his best to look fine and failing miserably. Steve began to feel a bit of rage, thinking about the fact that this bully was just going to continue to hurt his son and that his son was going to continue to let it happen to him.
"I know Tony, I know."
Rhodey not listening to Peter when he said that he should paint his suit dark green, black and gray because “Ellie picked my colors and she was better with all the artsy stuff”
Bruce sighs and takes off his glasses to rub his eyes, then puts them back on and stands up. "I think I'm going to go upstairs and take a little break, are you ok Tony?"
"For the spider kid?"
Peter just wanted his parents to walk through the front door. Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor had all been trying to get him to relax and be patient but he was slowly losing it. Bruce eventually called Rhodey who was able to calm him down for a little, but for the past 4+ hours Peter has really only cared about seeing Steve and Tony walk through the front door. Ned's constant texting about the new scary sci-fi film that was coming out next week was helping, but not enough. So when the door finally opened Peter couldn't get up any faster. He ran over and hugged his pops and dad tightly, both of them dropping their bags to hug him back. "Were they too boring Pete? Is that why you wanted us to come home? I told my honey bear to keep you entertained but I guess he didn't." Rhodey rolled his eyes and Peter and Steve laughed before Peter started telling them most of what he had been up to while they were away, making Steve and Tony both smile.
“How dare you”
Peter called the Pizza place, changed out of costume, picked up the pizzas and made it home just as his pops and the rest of his family were walking through the door.
"Ned. Where the hell is my kid?"
Steve's heart breaks as Tony runs into the room and asks him what happened.
“I’ve been Spiderman for a while now Wade, I know how to take care of myself. I know how to be a hero. What difference does a few years make?”
_________________________
"Well that explains why you're all here"
"Steve, are you going to say something to your psycho fucking husband?" Natasha said, rolling her eyes. Steve simply shook his head which made Natasha sigh. Steve had his head in his hands the moment Peter was out a half hour past his curfew. His curfew was at
"When am I not?"
"Don't you two think it's time for breakfast?" Eliana and Peter nodded and Natasha got off the floor. The four of them headed towards the living room where Steve, Clint, Bruce, Rhodey, and Thor were all making breakfast and drinking coffee.
“OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH! YOU KNEW OUR DAUGHTER COULDN’T SWIM YET YOU LET HER TAKE THE SWIM TEST! YOU KNEW I ENTRUSTED ONE GUARD TO LOOK OUT FOR HER YET YOU DID NOT HAVE HER WATCH HER SWIM IN THE 10 FOOT DEEP POOL. YOU HIRED TEENAGERS WHO BESIDES THE ONE I ENTRUSTED COULD NOT HAVE CARED LESS FOR MY BABY AND NOW SHE IS GONE.” Tony stood up and screamed at the women, who was now visibly shaking in front of the billionaire. He then fell back to his knees, clutching his baby, his princess, his genius, his everything to his chest. Steve followed, hugging his husband and his daughter close to him.
“Maybe if you guys would have just heard him out then he wouldn’t have felt the need to run away”
"Hey everyone, why are you guys all up so early?" He said as he walked towards the fridge to get some juice.
"But Tony he has bags under his eyes and he looks so relieved every time we call, I don't know if I can take hurting him like this anymore. It's hurting me too."
"POPS!"
“She has a point”
"And why you tried hiding your injury from us?" Steve adds in
And Steve, any time Peter did anything slightly wrong would tell him that Eliana would not have done something like what Peter just did.
Steve hung up and Peter sighed, staring at the screen briefly before handing the phone back to his dad.
Lilly smiles at her and says "I'm in charge of the little pool but I will do my best." Eliana smiles and gives her a thumbs up as she turns and walks towards the big pool, and Lilly turning to face the little pool. Proud of her little pal, and the determination she has regardless of how scared she may be.
I am SO SORRY! I was so busy with my boyfriend (now ex), graduation, college stuff and family things that I just didn’t have the time to update. It’s summer now though and I have a new computer and more time! This chapter is kinda short but it’s just to keep the story moving. Fun fact, I know how I want this story to end, I just need to get there and that takes time. Thanks for all the comments and again, sorry it took so long.
“Peter was here but he’s gone now.”
"Yea yea shut up Tones. I'll make us some lunch and be back down in a little bit. Don't over think it and don't over work yourself."
"Because we wanted to hear why you were around him before we considered calling your dads." Clint replied, shrugging his shoulders.
Tony, Steve, Rhodey, Bruce, and Thor all gathered their things and left, hoping that meeting with Nat would bring them closer to finding the boy.
Tony looked at Rhodey for a moment and then he stood up
I hope you like this, school is kicking my ass so I'm sorry for not updating.
“Tony I would never blame you. Peter didn’t drown honey... we are going to find him and everything will be ok.”
"Peter, keeping all these secrets from your parents is wrong, you really need to start being honest with them."
"Steve please..."
"Peter..."
"I'll be there in 5"
(Tony) "Spider-Man has been around for over a year..."
"Do I text him? Do I ask him if he wants to hang out sometime? Do I ask him if he likes me? No, that's too much. Maybe I can ask him to see a movie or to hang out... god, I don't know what to do!" Peter quickly texts MJ, asking her what she thinks he should do. She tells him to get a fucking grip and ask him to hang out. Peter rolls his eyes but decided to do what she said.
Clint froze, he looked over at Natasha who currently had a poker face on but he could see the fear that was now in her eyes.
Lilly sighs, "If you think you can do it, you should try! If you are too scared, don't do it. You never have to do anything you don't want to. If you're too scared, it won't even be fun!"
Peter had never had a sleepover at Harry’s house before and was crying about missing his parents. Harry brought out the gift he had been waiting all day to give Peter, the stress ball he was holding now. Harry said “let’s try something! Let’s watch Harry Potter, and I’ll play with your hair and you play with your gift! Then maybe you won’t feel so nervous anymore!” Peter was unsure if this would work but Harry looked so eager that he nodded. Slowly he found himself calming down and eventually he was able to forget about his anxiety, at least for a little while”
Tony not allowing Peter to work on the robot Ellie built when she was 6 (that had stopped working two years after she died) because “Ellie explained exactly what she wanted this robot to do and how she would have fixed his problems, you wouldn’t understand her plan Pete”
Clint frowns slightly, "Peter, what do you mean you'll have nothing?"
Steve looked at him for a moment before pulling him around the waist into a kiss, "Thank you" he whispered.
“But Aunt Tasha, it’s not that late!”
Natasha looked at her nephew and sighed. She started to look at his features, how his eyes were big and brown like his dads, his smile belonged to his pops, his hair and nose were a nice combination of both of parents. She thought about the moment when tony pulled him out of the water and took off his mask. How you couldn’t see his eyes, Tony’s eyes, anymore. How his smile, Steve’s smile, was not there. The kid didn’t seem to realize that his dads weren’t the only ones scared when he fell into the water.
"Yea Pete?"
Peter woke up. He almost started crying. It felt so real, god he wanted it to be real. He looked at his aunt who was in bed fast asleep. He knew she would be calling his parents in the morning, so if he was going to get away. He knew exactly where he was going next. He quickly wrote out a note and silently left, careful as to not disturb his aunt.
"Did you two know our son was spider-man?"
Peter didn't want to yell at his Pops, he didn't yell at his Pops really ever. But after hearing what he heard yesterday and now today finding his dad gone, he doesn't really care.
Everyone nodded, but Thor’s words had made everyone sad and somehow more scared.
"I don't know, it's just that a part of me feels like we have done this for so long but we don't need to. The recruits can handle everything from now on and I would rather spend time with you and Peter and training the recruits then actually doing battles, and I would prefer if you did too."
"He said after he comes home."
"So that's it. You really want to be done? You want to hang up being Captain America and Iron Man?"
"Pops, I can't do this anymore. Can you and Dad please come home? I really, really need you to come home..."
"Ok, well then, Spider-man, go do whatever you were about to do. But please, be careful."
All of a sudden Peters head was pushed down hard, smashing his muffin on his face and banging his head in the process.
Natasha chose to step out, quickly informing the team, Pepper, and Rhodey about what happened to Eliana. Tears were in her eyes as she sent the text, but she shook them off knowing she needed to be strong for her two grieving friends.
"I don't care if they aren't MY suits because you are OUR son, and we both didn't agree that you could try on the suit. I'll call you later Peter but you are grounded. No going out for a week."
"I could never hate him..."
"I completely understand. I promise that I won't bring Bucky here and that I'll never lie to you again. Sweetheart all I want to do is make this right and I'll do my best to gain your complete trust once again."
Peter is full on crying now. He knows he is being hysterical but he can't seem to stop, he feels like he is having a panic attack.
Peter ran as fast as he could off the building and then shot his web, swinging left and right shouting with joy.
"I know, just please don't break anything."
Peter just looked down at his feet and grabbed a napkin, wiping his face. "Flash is the fucking worst" he muttered while he'd just apologized and agreed quietly.
"Peter we already decided..."
“Actually we were touring your dads labs and... radioactive spider. And yeah, Pops lost his mind.”
"But that's just it pops, you and dad might not make it out of those battles. Or Clint, or Tasha. Thor and Bruce probably will but you are all at risk. Have you ever thought what it would be like if I was watching a battle on the news with dad and then we saw you die and that was it? Or if I was watching dad fight with you and we saw him fall out of the sky and never wake up? I lost Eliana too, I don't want to lose any more family members. If that means that I stand by one of you while you fight will the other stays home then so be it, I'm not risking losing either of you and I'll die before..."
Steve and Tony ran over to him, Steve reaching him first, and hugged him tightly. Steve kept one hand in his hair, still darker than Steve and lighter than Tony's, and one on his back pulling him closer. Tony hugged him next, just as tightly.
"But Pops, I've never been to Costa Rica! Dad owns a mansion there so I can just stay in the mansion while you guys enjoy yourselves. Please, please don't leave me alone here." Peter knows it's going to hurt his Pops a little but he does his puppy dog eyes, hoping they will work.
"Dad... Pops...I..."
Just as he starts doing them his dad walks in with Natasha. "Alright Stevie, we bought everything Pete will need to survive for a week without us and I found this really sexy American flag swim suit that will make your ass look..."
"NO, NO "TONY..." YES OR NO, DID YOU KNOW OR DID YOU NOT FUCKING KNOW?"
“Peter you can come in but I don’t think staying here is a very good idea. I think that if you just go home, maybe your parents will reconsider what they said.”
Peter sighed, relieved. Relieved that both his dads wouldn't be in danger and that Ned was now in his room covering for him.
"Peter, please sit," Pops said.
"Peter!?"
"No, don't even try to say anything. It's done. You're done. Spider man is done. God and to think we were recruiting you when today's mission ended..."
At first these types of outbursts startled Peter but he had gotten used to the boxes a long time ago.
“Does your Dad know that it was my dads lab?”
"Peter, it's ok that you don't want us to leave. But besides Natasha and Bruce and Clint occasionally checking in you will have the house to yourself. Maybe you can invite Ned over and hang out with him while we are gone. We will be back before you go back to school and we will call you every day."
“Everyone calm the fuck down, none of this is going to help Peter”
Sorry! I got my appendix taken out and was so busy catching up on work and healing that I haven't been able to update!
"What did your pops say?"
"Steve, honey, we aren't going home. Unless Peter calls or the team calls we are staying the last three days."
"Peter there is no way I am letting you try on the iron man suit without me being here. Your father and I will discuss it when I get home but until then the answer is still no."
Peter chuckled slightly,
"Sorry Brucey, I didn't mean to make Pete drop your beaker."
"... I think I do Tony." Steve looked away, he didn't want to see the anger on Tony's face.
"Peter are you serious? You know I have to."
-------------- Later that day----------------
Steve regretted it as soon as it came out of his mouth.
Tony got up and grabbed his phone out of his pocket, quickly calling the dean of Peters school and walking away once she picked up. Steve decided to simply pick his son up bridal style and carry him down to the living room.
He couldn't stay with a family who didn't believe in him anymore.
Eliana seemed to think about this for a moment, "Alright, I think I can do it. I just want to try, hopefully, I do ok. And if I need help you'll save me right?"
Peter nodded, trying to focus on Goblin and not on the date that he now had later
"Who do I need to kill"
“Daddy and Papa sad Aunty Tasha!”
Everyone seemed ok with that and set off on their individual tasks of showering because they smelled (Natasha and Steve), ordering the film (Tony), ordering the pizza (Clint), and making the popcorn (Thor).
“Guys? What is going on?” Clint looks at the two Avengers, clearly concerned by the picture they walked in on.
"So Petey, if you could date one of the Avengers...."
3) go to pops friend Bucky’s house.
"Glad to hear it," Peter said, smiling and rolling his eyes. That is until he saw the look on his Pops face.
Tony turned to look at them, "I'm sorry, what?"
As Steve walked towards Peters room he started thinking about how Peter said they compared him to Eliana a lot. At the time, Steve didn’t know what Peter was talking about but looking back at the past 12 years, he realized that not only had he been comparing Peter to Ellie, but so had the rest of the family.
Tony laughed for the first time
"Are you fucking serious Steve?"
"I know you're proud of me, I know you think I can do this. I know you're scared that I'm going to get hurt. But Dad, please try to push that part away. Please try to just focus on how proud you are of me and please give me another chance. I'm nothing without the suit."
"I promise!"
"Honestly though Petey-Pie, I think you are the lucky one. You got the best genes around with all the blond godly features of the Captain and all the doe eyed sexiness of Mr. Stark, blended together to create the most gorgeous guy around."
"As long as he doesn't pick some sappy rom com then Peter can choose the movie," his dad said as he opened his lab door, Bruce following close behind.
5) Go to Ned’s and pray my parents don’t think to check there
"14 months!? You've been lying to us for 14 months!?! During those 14 months did you not once think that during those 14 months you could have died? That when spider man was out on a solo mission he may never have returned and your father and I would never have known?"
____________At Natashas____________
Finally a loud thud gets everyone to stop telling at each other. Everyone turns to look at Thor, who looks beyond frustrated.
"Your dad has been getting a few readings on his machine, the one he made to monitor future Alien attacks? It appears one may be happening soon." His uncle Rhodey said while pulling the kid into a quick hug.
Peter blushed, nodding slightly.
I personally imagine Harry in this story looking like Timothee Chalamet
"Peter, your pops is going on a trip for a week so you better go say goodbye."
"Tony it's one week..."
Peter looked up at him and frowned.
"Hush, TONY, GET IN HERE!"
"What!? You can't tell them! I would have to explain how I met him which would mean telling them I'm Spider-Man! Look, I met Wade during patrol like 8 months ago and we became friends."
"I'm sure young Peter just hasn't looked at a clock yet, he must return at some point," Thor said with semi confidence. He said the same thing when it hit 11, and then again at 12.
“I need everyone to listen here and listen good. This argument is pointless. Young stark is missing. We have all already lost one child. Do we want to lose another? I grieve for my niece everyday. I will not grieve for my nephew. Until he is found there should be no more arguing. No questioning of parenting, no blaming, none of it. We must find Peter and we must work together to do so. Understood?”
Lots of mixing and pouring and baking later, Tony and Eliana had managed to make at least 50 cookies that were absolutely perfect.
"Steve! Honey! Cap! Are you still mad at me?? Do you... do you hate me? Are you gonna take Petey away? Please don't take him away, please don't go away. I tried to protect her, I tried to save our princess but I couldn't do it and I'm soooo sorry! I loved her so much..." A very drunk Tony was crying hystarically now, he was sitting at his desk with his head in his hands, bottles of beer, vodka and gin all around him.
"Tony you know you're not old and you also know what I meant. Don't you sometimes wish we were done with this? That all you had to do was run Stark Industries and all I had to do was help out around Shield and that we could just, you know, stop being heroes?"
Peter frowned slightly, "then why didn't you say something two days ago?"
"Tony that isn't..."
"HOW. FUCKING. LONG. NATASHA?"
With his family walking around the house pretending like they were happy and Peter still not having done his Christmas shopping, he decided to take a break from the tower and go for a walk. The walk helped him think about one of his current favorite things to think about, Wade.
"Please tell me you at least got a few hits in"
Peter sighed as he sat at the park, rethinking where he was headed next. He was starting to feel anxious and sad, he didn’t like being away from his parents no matter how frustrated he was.
Steve, however, despite how concerned he was, accepted that she may wish to swim sooner than her height (in Tony's eyes) allowed. So when she came home with the permission slip for the camp most of the girls in her grade would be attending, Steve knew he had to sign her up. Much to Tony's dismay. But Tony knew that they were not doing their job as parents by refusing to let her learn to swim and go to camp, so he agreed. Now, seeing the smile on Ellie's face as she quickly ate her breakfast and then ran to her room to get her new red white and blue swim suit, he knew they made the right decision.
"Babe, I know I'm really old but seriously? Retirement?"
Steve took the pizzas out of Peters' hands and handed them over to Bruce, then carefully picked his son up bridal style and walked into the door being held open by Thor.
"Yes, I'll be ok Daddy. No, Papa, you don't need to stay. I promise I will follow all the rules and be safe. Now, can I PLEASE go?" Eliana said, smiling at her to dads concerned faces.
“System override. Cameras in Master Peters room have been shut down”.
"Steve, maybe it's time you go talk to your husband," Natasha said, trying to get her friend to do anything besides work out.
"I can't have people on the team that I don't trust. Widow and Hawkeye will still be members of the Avengers, but I will not have them living under this tower. If they are willing to lie to me and Tony about our son's safety then who knows what else they would be willing to lie about."
"Pops that seems a little unreasonable..."
"But this was only my 3rd try!"
The next frame in the box has Eliana and Peters Kindergarten picture day pictures. Tony remembers learning how to braid hair the night before just so he could braid her hair the next day. Steve tried to get Peter to wear a tie for his picture but he refused.
"Same as last year, just some jerks from school," Peter said quietly
"I know, it's just that I don't like going home and not seeing my dad in his workshop or my pops in the gym. I don't like how quiet the house seems without my dad or how unsafe I feel without my pops there. It's driving me crazy." Peter hugged himself tighter, leaning closer to deadpool.
“Peter! What an unexpected surprise. How are you doing? Why are you at my apartment at 4 am?”
“Aunt Tasha no. I know they won’t. Everyone thinks I can’t do this. Even Wade.” Peter whispered the last part. Natasha had to stop herself from rolling her eyes, Wade wasn’t exactly someone she felt was good enough for her nephew.
Ellie smiled at her dad and nodded in agreement, giggling when her Papa began to pout.
"Tony..." Clint started to say.
“No, Peter isn’t stupid. He knows we would look there.” Steve mutters, his face in his hands.
"Um, 20."
"Can I try on an iron man suit?"
"Our daughters dead."
Steve froze for a moment, then looked up. "You're really willing to be done?"
"I have gotten a lot better! I just get really excited when you and my dad let me help out with big projects."
Tony rolled his eyes at something Peter's pops said, "Do you want to talk to Peter?" Peter took the phone, hoping to stop the argument before it got any worse. "Hey Pops! How's the flight?"
Tony looked at his husband, shocked. Steve had never been this angry before, and he had never said such harsh things. Tony’s mind started racing.
His face fell when he realized that Peter was sniffling and his eyes were red, like he’d been crying.
“Hi Harry”
"DADDY, IT'S TIME TO GET READY!!!" Tony heard his daughter scream as she ran down the hall towards his lab. He sat up abruptly, clearly having fallen asleep in the lab once again. He slowly got up, making sure everything that would harm his tiny but mighty Ellie was put away. She opened the door just as he was putting the last of his tools away and ran towards her dad's leg, Tony picking her up easily. "Eliana my beautiful girl, why do I have to get ready? It's 10:00 am and it's Saturday." She smiled wide and rolled her eyes, so similar to his, at him.
Peter looked up from the Phone and smiled, "it was worth it, can I try on another one?"
"Papa you can't make the cookies anymore." Steve looked at his daughter and then looked back down at his tray of burnt holiday cookies.
Peter froze for a moment, "Um, he was great! We watched Space balls and built this extremely old Harry Potter Lego set that we found in his closet."
Steve takes two steps forward and kisses his husband softly. When they stop looks down at his husband, who much to Steve's joy and Tony's annoyance is 3 inches shorter than him, and puts his arms around Tony's waist.
Steve and Tony smile to mask their concern and give their daughter a kiss goodbye before getting back in their car.
“Hey....”
Peter stopped looking at his pops and looked at his dad instead.
1) Go Home.
"Peter!"
"I can't be Spider-Man until I'm 22? Pops that's not fair..."
Tony hung his head down as Steve continued to list the ways Peter was grounded until he just couldn’t hear it anymore.
Peter looked up, slightly startled. “I can’t be home, my parents found out I was lying to them for months and decided to punish me. But they are being hypocrites and I want them to understand that I know it was wrong to lie but what I lied about isn’t a bad thing and they should be proud of me but they aren’t. I think they might even hate me and I...”
Natasha and Clint looked at each other, clearly having some sort of silent conversation when eventually Natasha spoke first.
"OF COURSE I HEARD POPS! YOU KISSED SOMEONE ELSE! YOU HAVE BEEN SECRETLY SEEING SOME PERSON NAMED BUCKY AND BUCKY KILLED DADS PARENS! WHY WOULD YOU SEE SOMEONE LIKE THAT? WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO DAD? HOW COULD YOU LIE TO US?" Peter said, now crying though he's unsure why. Then, out of nowhere something snaps in him.
just please, please give me a chance."
"Honestly Steve, I don't forgive you yet and I don't fully trust you at the moment... But I'm not going to leave and I'm going to try not to be angry. But no more lies. If you lie to me again Steve... I don't know what I'll do. I don't want Bucky anywhere near this tower. You're over him? Fine, I believe you. But I don't want him near our home or near our kid, got it? I just can't face him and I can't imagine him being here, at least not for a while."
Clint flares slightly but chose to do as he said, the look on Steve’s face was enough to make him not want to get into an argument with the mans husband.
"Come on Pops, it'll be fun."
"Sorry Screw up Stark, didn't mean to ruin your lunch" Flash said, grinning and fist bumping his friend.
Peter was the one to run out of the room to get one of his uncles or his aunt, even at three he knew that his two daddies crying on the floor meant things were not ok. He ran into the training room, even though he knew he wasn’t allowed to go in there and grabbed his aunties leg.
I am so sorry but I could not figure out how to get to chapter 12, I know this chapter is short but chapter 12 is a bit longer and hey I finally updated so that's a plus. Again, I am so sorry and I will try to update again soon!
"Well then I guess I just like icing no matter where it comes from and regardless of where it comes from myself, Peter and Eliana will be unable to stop eating it." Tony grinned at his husband as he took another spoonful of icing, causing his daughter and son to start laughing once again.
"Dad I'm a hero, I save people, I..."
Suddenly Steve was no longer near his husband as Rhodey (who had just arrived with the others) pushed him out of the way and took control of the situation. Slowly Tony’s breathing came back to normal and Steve sighed in relief, walking to go get himself and Tony some water when the phone rang.
"Peter... EVERY MAN WHO WAS ABLE WAS GOING TO THE WAR. MY BEST FRIEND WAS GOING TO THE WAR. OUR COUNTRY NEEDED TROOPS AND I NEEDED TO HELP OUR COUNTRY. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED SPIDER-MAN. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED A 15 YEAR OLD BOY TO RISK HIS LIFE FOR NO REASON. Your sister never would have done something like this..." Steve sat down and put his head in his hands and Tony went to sit next to him.
No one was excited to see Spider-Man but they allowed him to help, the job was too difficult to deny extra hands.
"...um well, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea.."
Peter can't look up, he won't, he won't look at his pop. He can't bring himself to.
"Until you decide not to come back. Until you decide to start a whole new life with your old pal Bucky and you leave me and Peter alone."
"I thought Ned hated Harry Potter?" Natasha said while walking into the kitchen to get an apple.
"Alright Peter, are you ready to fly a little?"
Peter spent the rest of that Saturday with his dad's in their room, his dad clearly still upset with his Pops but both silently agreeing to let it go until Peter was calm and asleep.
Steve continued to punch his 13... no 14th punching Bag in the last 5 days.
Steve hadn’t realized that for 12 years his family had been comparing his son to his sister, and that for 12 years Peter just let them continue to hurt him by doing so. Steve had never felt like such a horrible parent. Deciding that instead of a run he was going to spend the day trying to show his son that he appreciated and cared for him, Steve walked into his sons room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter sat in a chair next to his parents with a hopeful look in his eyes.
“I really am sorry about just showing up like this, especially after not talking since..”
The first picture was of Tony holding a baby Eliana, the second was of an almost two-year-old Ellie looking up at Steve making a silly face, the third was of Ellie hugging Steve right before her first day of camp.
“Captain Rogers, I assure you that the lifeguards did the very best they could…” Ms. Rida tried to explain, hoping the fear she was currently feeling was not too apparent.
"Don't you dare say that. You will not die on behalf of me or your father, do you understand? Never. Spider-man is finished. Please, Pete, just go to your room."
"Tony, do you ever think about retiring?"
"Peter, you know we hate when you try to keep secrets from us," Pops says in his caring yet firm way.
".... it's...ok..." Peter said quietly. His breathing finally slowed and his tears stopped, Peter hugs his dad tightly. His dad returns the hug and closes his eyes, happy to see his son calm.
"But I wish we could just go home."
"Dad pleaseeee"
Steve's face falls the moment the person on the other end starts speaking.
Peter stops talking and Steve picks up the phone.
“Are you fucking serious right now?” Tony glares at her, his eyes widening in anger.
"Dad, I'm fine. Just a few bruises and a slightly sprained wrist most likely, no big deal."
"So Spider-guy, do you want to come back to the tower with us?" Clint said, wincing at the pain in his ankle.
Peter simply chose to shut his mouth, although his silence didn't last long once he and his pop finally made it to the living room and his aunt and uncles started asking him what had happened.
He had met Deadpool 3 months ago while on patrol and the two immediately took a liking to each other. Well, Wade liked Peter. It took Peter a little while before he got used to and began to like Wade as only a friend. Now, however, Peter couldn't stop thinking about the loud, strange yet funny mercenary. Peter knew that the idea of them being together was ridiculous and couldn't happen, his parents told him he was too young to date and despite Wade's flirty attitude he was sure the more mature... maybe not more mature but older man didn't want to date some 15-year-old.
Peter groaned, not because he didn't want to go to school, more so because he needed to know the plan so that Spider-Man would be ready. But his pops was giving him that "I mean it, now." Look so he decided not to push it. He knew that he could handle whatever happened and that everything was going to be fine.
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he crossed his arms
______________________________________________
By the time Peter got there the battle was in full swing, and by the time it ended Natasha had a broken arm, Clint a twisted ankle, Thor and Hulk were fine and his Pop's seemed to have slightly hurt his shoulder. Peter had managed to get out with only a couple of bruises on his face and a slightly sprained wrist, mainly because the team refused to let him get too close to the villain (much to Peters annoyance). Despite all that, the Avengers managed to come out on top.
"...so every time Spider-Man got hit, kicked, punched, thrown, that was you? Tony and Steve are going to fucking lose it."
"I'm fine, now can someone please get me a slice of Pizza? I'm starving and I want to hear about the mission and maybe watch a movie."
"...what?" Clint looked up at Steve who was now standing at his full height looking calm yet furious.
______________________________
“Great then let’s go!”
"I promise that your daughter is in good hands Captain Rogers, Mr. Stark." The head camp counselor, Ms. Rida said. "But we are going to miss our bus if you two men don't go so if you don't mind, we will see you when it is time to pick Elianna up at 4:00." She smiles at them with a kind but firm smile, which reminded Tony of Pepper.
"Not anymore."
"What???"
*Around 4:45 am that same day*
Peter looked at his Pops and his dad, his eyes full of sadness.
Peter blushed while Deadpool had a conversation with his boxes about what to say and what not to say around Peter. Just while Wade told the yellow box to stop being such a fucking looney and to get his shit together, Peters "Spidey phone" (special thanks to his dad, even if he didn't know he gave it to him) rang.
"Ned? I decided two teenagers don't need to sit locked in one room, inside a billion dollar tower. Why don't you and Peter... where the hell is Peter?"
Steve got up and out of bed, pulling on his running shorts, tank top and shoes. After everything that’s been going on, he needed a good run. He turned around and kissed his husband, who looked like he was not having the best dream.
"Steve you know I will raise hell on this school if anything happens to Peter so stop worrying!"
Natasha raised her eyebrows,"you really thought Clint and myself weren't going to follow you after we found out who you were? We saw you go into his apartment."
"Young Stark, what villain has taken their anger out on you? We must destroy them at once."
“Aunt Tasha...”
With a final look around his room, Peter put on his web shooters, climbed out his window and slowly climbed down his dads extremley high tower.
Sorry if everyone seems OOC and if my writing sucks, I wrote the entire chapter at 1 am last night. Please leave a comment if you have any suggestions or if you like the story! This chapter talks a little bit about how Peter was affected by Ellie's death, Spider-man, and more. Fun fact, I came up with this story because I met a little 9-year-old girl named Eliana while I was lifeguarding for a camp and she reminded me of what you would imagine "the daughter of Tony Stark " to be like. She didn't drown though. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter! I'll post another one by around Friday or Saturday.
Tony sighed, "honestly Stevie, awe have spent years doing this job, risking our lives, fighting the good fight, I don't see the need to do it anymore. You're right, the recruits can handle it. Hell, Spider-man could probably lead the damn team. And Peter is growing up so fast, we spent his entire job fighting bad guys and risking our lives and I don't think it's worth spending the rest of his teens doing the same thing. So yea, I'm willing to be done."
Peter's first day did not go by quickly. He managed to get lost twice, miss marching band
“I went in there to check on him and his bed was empty and some of his clothes are missing and... our son is gone Tony!”
Then the door opened.
Tony woke up to his husband shaking him and with a scared look on his face.
"Peter, how can we trust you when you lied to us for so long? Gaining that trust back is going to take time... I'm sorry."
"But?"
"Peter you're gonna break it."
"I make no promises Petey-Pie."
"And Pops, do you promise not to appear dressed as Captain America and give a speech about bullies? I'm just glad I was near the door when you tried to come in last year..."
"I know that, but you need to go see him and you and Steve need to calmly talk to him, soon."
Steve sighed and looked at his husband, and the fear he saw in Tony’s eyes was shocking.
Harry’s eyes widened “no fucking way. How? When? Who freaked out more, Tony or Steve? My money is on Steve.”
“And alcohol makes you happy Tony but should you drink it?”
“Did you call Rhodey? Bruce? Thor?”
"Or that you would be on a mission with one of us, die and then your dad or myself or one of your uncles or your aunt would have to take the mask off and realize that it was you?"
Peter stood up, not wanting to look at his family anymore and began to walk away. But he stopped himself and turned to look at his dad one more time.
“More than you’ll ever know мой маленький племянник. Now let’s get you some food and get you to bed.”
"No Peter." Steve pulled him in close for a hug and kissed him on the forehead.
Peter looked at his pops, heartbroken, then ran to his room with tears in his eyes once again.
“Peter no. Your dads are probably looking for you right now. If you don’t go back home they are going to have the entire city looking for you.”
Peter quickly shakes it off, realizing he needs to think about it later. He has a job to do. With a deep breath, he jumps off the roof, swinging towards the battle.
"Don't worry Peter, we will be there as soon as we can. Love you son."
He understood why his dad and pops worried, why all the Avengers worried. He knew that not a day went by where his parents and his aunts and uncles didn't think about her. She would have been 21 as of 3 months ago. His dad got smashed that day for the first time since, well, since she died. He said he was celebrating the way she was supposed to have gotten to chance to celebrate. His Pops had been so angry and sad, angry because his dad was drunk and sad because he couldn't get drunk. May 4th and July 21st were the worst days in the entire year. He feels bad for his parents, he remembers his joyous sister but not very well. He wishes he didn't remember her at all, and a small part of him wishes the rest of his family didn't either.
He grabbed one of his katanas and walked towards the door, looking through the peep hole. He was surprised to see that it wasn’t someone who was trying to kill him, but Peter! He opened the door and grinned.
"Don't worry, we will let you try it on at some point but now isn't the time. I'll call when the jet takes off and when I land"
“I’m not just some kid, I have been doing my job and having a life of my own up until this point. I will never be a normal kid, I’m a hero just like my dads and nothing you or them say can make be believe any different. I thought if anyone would be on my side, you would.”
"PETER WE CAN'T LOSE YOU, YOU AREN'T READY TO BE A HERO AND WE AREN'T READY FOR YOU TO BECOME ONE!"
“My parents found out that I’m Spiderman, they don’t trust me anymore and they said I can’t be a hero. At least, not until I’m older.”
"You do realize that this? Spider man? It's over. It's done. The suit, your freedom, your powers, once I figure out a way to get rid of them, all gone." Tony says calmly after they arrive home and get Peter and Steve patched up, Peter dried off and into a change of clothes.
Clint stared at his team mates with both fear and tears in his eyes before quickly going to grab his stuff, not wanting to upset Cap any more. Natasha simply looked at first Tony, then Steve, and lastly Peter before calmly walking to her room to retrieve her things and out of the tower, not a word was spoken.
"Don't you dare say that. You are nothing like Howard and no one thinks you are like Howard. He was not a good father and you are a great one, I never want to hear you say that about yourself."
Peter tried to look as pathetic and apologetic as he could, which wasn't super hard considering the looks on his families faces, they all looked so concerned and upset. His Dad and Pops looked like they already had or were about to cry.
“You’re both superheroes! Why wouldn’t your son want to be one? Peter is trustworthy and he’s fucking good. Instead of getting mad at him for lying you should wonder why he felt the need when he’s never lied to you before. Your son doesn’t trust you.”
"Hey! Clueless wasn't that bad" Steve said, attempting to defend his son while pulling him into a quick hug hello. "How was your day Pete, how's Ned?"
Before Eliana can say anything Peter speaks up,
Clint not allowing Peter to climb in the air ducts with him and not teaching him how to shoot arrows because “That was Ellie’s now and I think you would just break it Pete”
“Tony, Darling please breathe. Tony take deep breaths. Tony, I didn’t mean to make you have a panic attack, I need you to look at me and breathe.”
Peter finished swinging around at 6:00, knowing that if he stayed out any later all the Avengers would be looking for him. Although he wanted to spend more time outside with his webs before school started in a few days, he knew his dads would not be pleased if he went anywhere without calling and asking first.
As Peter neared the store he heard a scream, all thoughts about Wade disappearing. Green Goblin was busy setting up explosives that would blow up one of the biggest banks in New York and all of the people in and around it. Without a second thought, Peter changed into his costume, only to see Deadpool in his costume running towards him.
“Well who the fuck could that be?”
“He can be an Avenger? Seriously Tony? Our son is not a hero, he might have the name Stark but he’s not a weapon.”
, get assigned homework in every class and get "accidentally" shoved to the ground and punched by Flash quite a few times throughout the day which resulted in a black eye and a few other bruises. Also, despite his dad being rich he had somehow managed to forget money for lunch. Great.
"Well I guess there's your answer."
“Peters gone...”
Peter didn’t even realize he had been crying until his aunt wiped a tear away from his eye. “I really helped save my dads?”
"Steve..."
March 12th at about 4 am
Silence, their is nothing but silence until they get to the car. Once they get in, his Dad in the drivers seat and his Pop sitting in the back with him, Peter looks down at his lap.
“Steve that was one of the most heartfelt apologies I have heard in quite some time, which is a good thing considering how much of a douche you just were. We will discuss this later but right now we need to go learn about our kids' whereabouts.”
“He’s grounded again. We are changing the password for the system override code, we are putting bars on the window, we are taking away the door to his room, done. Any shot Peter had of having some freedom he just lost, he...”
Peter, now with a tracker free phone, scrolled through his contacts and found the name and address he was looking for. He followed the map on his phone down the street, onto the train, off the train, and a few blocks until he reached his destination. Peter slowly walked up the steps and knocked on the door.
He smiled his small smile, his green eyes always looking like he was half awake. His black hair was longer than Peter remembered it being, it was nice and wavy just like he remembered though.
Tony finished pouring his coffee and finally spoke, "you know what Petey, I think it's about time we bring that tradition back. I'll call the rest of the team and we can start baking at
"Papa!" She said as she ran towards her father.
Sorry I have been gone for so long! I hope you don’t hate this chapter! I used google translate for the Russian so if it is wrong I’m sorry. I promise this story is not abandoned, I just didn’t have time and I didn’t know how I wanted to approach from here. I know how I want it to end but I have to get there first. We are not near the end at all so if you are enjoying this story then just know it’s not over yet! Again, sorry for the wait and I wrote this at 1:00 am so I might have to edit it later.
"I failed him, Natasha. We promised each other we would protect our children no matter what and I signed our little girl up for the one thing we both agreed she was not ready to do. How can I face him? How can I look him in the eyes, the same ones our daughter has...had." Steve said, punching his punching bag even harder.
"Steve, baby, you just aren't meant to bake cookies. I love you but these are the worst fucking...." "LANGUAGE" "...fudging cookies I've ever seen. Let me and Ellie deal with the cookies, you and Peter can decorate them."
“We did listen to him, we just don’t want our fifteen year old child to risk his life every day.” Steve says, trying to keep a level head.
Peter stared at his aunt, he’d never seen her look so sad. She still tried to keep her face fairly emotionless, but he could see the pain in her eyes. He set his sisters picture down and picked up the one of him.
"Tony, sweetheart? Can I please come in?" Steve knocked and then slowly opened the door.
“You don’t think I know that Steve? Of course, I know that he needs to learn his lesson, but I also know that our son is incredibly smart and capable! He has some amazing abilities and talents that we can utilize. I think that maybe with the right training he can...”
"Pops..."
"How did Wade even get in here?" Tony said, rolling his eyes as he turned back to his machine.
“I took those two pictures, the ones of you and your sister.”
"You're right, let's go pack so we can see or boy.
Peter blushed even more than he already had been. “Sorry...”
"THEN CHANGE YOUR MIND! DAD PLEASE, YOU KNOW I CAN DO THIS!"
"Worried?"
“Be careful, she made me that frame when she was 4. We were doing crafts together and she decorated this frame. She said so I could have “a pretty frame for a pretty picture”. I pulled out my camera and took one of her. You can’t see it in the picture but her hands were covered in glue and glitter.” Natasha smiled to herself, thinking about that day. “I developed the picture that day and when the frame was dry I put the picture in, I told Ellie that the pretty frame deserved a picture of the prettiest little girl.”
“Well, it just lets you be a normal kid for a little while longer, you know? Enjoy life before being a hero sucks the fun out of everything.”
"We knew. Tony, Steve, please try to understand..."
"You know you're grounded, right? No going out, no computer, no gaming system, no Lego's, no Ned or MJ, nothing. You can keep your phone for safety reasons but that's it. And if you EVER, break curfew again you will have a shield agent with you at all times. Am I clear?"
"Got a call from his mom that he needed to come home for some reason. Are you sure you're ok Peter?"
Peter quickly makes his way home and walks in the door.
Peter sits up and his heart flutters, he quickly responds,
Peter texted Ned and explained the whole situation to him as he left Wades house. He knew he couldn’t stay at Ned’s house because that’s where his parents would look first. He texted MJ as well but again, his parents would look there.
Peter's eyes widen, not expecting his dad to actually agree.
The aliens had arrived and it was worse then anyone thought it was going to be. While Tony, Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Clint, Thor, Rhodey and Sam were all fighting Peter quickly slipped into his suit and followed.
"So are you going to tell us what happened," Pops says, trying to look calm to mask the concern and anger he was really feeling.
Natasha giving up on teaching Peter Russian because he wasn’t picking it up very easily “Ellie could speak full sentences in Russian in two weeks!”
So no, Steve had not planned on marrying Howard Starks son, raising two kids in a tower that cost billions of dollars, becoming and leading the Avengers and most importantly being around in 2023. But that's how life turned out for Steve, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
Finally updated again! Sorry that my updates are so random.
"Are you sure you want to go Pete? I'm sure your dad could find you a tutor and then you could just learn from home..."
"You guys are seriously going away for an entire week without me? Why can't I come?"
"Trust me, I haven't really been able to sleep while we've been here either. All I can think about is Peter. But I also know we needed to do this, for both our sake and his..."
Not much surprised Natasha but opening the door and finding her nephew, backpack in hand and looking miserable did. Being kicked out of the Stark-Rogers household for not telling the truth about the kid was bad enough, now he had managed to run away to her house.
Steve sighs, "Tony, I know I lied and I understand why you are pissed and just but please... please... forgive me? If you want me to stop meeting up with Bucky... I will. Just tell me how to fix it."
Peter realized that option six was probably his best chance. Noticing a few rain drops on his phone, he put his hood up and started walking again. Only to stop when he remembered something important,
"Ok. Hey um, I'm going to ask Dad when I get downstairs but... well... I'm 15, I'm almost 16, you and dad said when I was 15 I could maybe try on the..."
"Pete, if tacos, and movies and holding hands and sleeping here doesn't make you feel better than I don't think anything will. Maybe it's time you just call Captain nice ass and Mr. Doe eyes and have them come home early."
“What?!”
After getting ready for bed Peter laid on his bed and touched his lips, falling asleep with a small smile on his face.
“I’m driving, let's go.”
"Every morning and every night, just like we talked about."
Bruce not allowing Peter to use the little lab station he had set up for Ellie, and getting frustrated when Peter was clumsy because “Ellie was the most careful little scientist”
"Peter you promised you would be careful, how could you be so reckless!?" Clint said quietly, unfortunately, not quiet enough for the super soldier and Tony to miss it.
“Peter... Pete drowned. He drowned because I couldn’t move to reach him. The last thing he said was I’m sorry and I was just... I was too scared to move. Everyone was screaming and crying and you told me it was all my fault. I killed your son...” Tony pulled his hand away from Steve and started running his temples. Steve could see Tony’s eyes watering
"I would love to meet him Mr. Stark, but I still have to patrol tonight. I'll be sure to stop by next time!"
"So I screwed up." Tony signed,
"Can you please explain why you won't let us do anything to make sure this doesn't happen anymore?" Dad says, clearly the calmer of the two yet clearly angered by the fact that someone is hurting his kid and that his kid won't let him fix.
"shut the fuck up, both of you!" Wade said out loud.
"Hey, babe?" Steve begins to say once Peter starts making his puppy eyes again, "Maybe Peter should come with us?"
"We're ok by the way! Twisted ankle for me and a broken arm for Nat but we're good." Clint rolled his eyes and gave him a thumbs up.
Swimming has been something that Tony and Steve knew they should have taught their daughter but were almost too scared to do. Tony felt that she was so small, so fragile, that maybe it would be best to learn when she was tall enough to stand with her head above the water in the pool he had put in especially for her. The pool is 5 ft two inches deep all the way across, and she is 3'5" which meant she wasn't even close to being ready to learn in Tony's eyes.
Three movie dates, 6 taco dates, one ice skating date and one fancy dinner that ended abruptly when Wade got into a fight with the waiter and Peter was on cloud nine. He knew that they were more like "hang outs" then dates because, well, going on dates with a guy 11 years older than you wasn't exactly considered ok in the eyes of most people, including the guy Peter was going on dates with. At least, that's what Peter thought.
"Peter this is unacceptable behavior! You are hurt and this boy Flash has bothered you for over a year now. I will not stand by and watch my son be bullied. Not like I was."
"Dad..." but Tony simply grabbed the spider-man suit, looked at his husband and kid, and left.
“Fair. So what are you gonna do? Do you have a plan?”
"Peter!?"
"Steve he NEEDS you, Peter needs you, the team needs you. None of us have even seen Tony in a month but Rhodey says he has started drinking again. Your son lost his big sister, he shouldn't lose his parents too." She knew it was a little harsh, but she also knew he needed to hear it. Just like how at this very moment, Tony was getting the "you don't want your son growing up around an alcoholic" speech. Steve sighed, knowing she was right. Without another word, he walked out the door and towards Tony's lab.
Steve and Tony then walked hand in hand to the beach, talking about the past and the future, both feeling as though a weight was lifted off their shoulders, knowing their time as heroes would soon come to a satisfying end.
"Since when have I listened to captain buzz kill when I thought I was doing the right thing?"
The next frame has two pictures. A picture of Eliana dressed for their Christmas party they were having that night, she wanted a picture In The new scarf that Rhodey has gotten her. And a picture of Peter playing dress up as a “pirate”.
Peter rolled his eyes at the comments about his dads but nodded slightly in agreement. "But I don't want to ruin their good time."
I will probably try to update this story twice a week, maybe more. Leave comments if you like the story, they would make me really happy! This is kinda short but I want to really get the story going so I needed to get through the death and the funeral.
"I wouldn't worry about it too much doll, so, while Tony and Bruce keep an eye on the machine the rest of us should come up with a plan of attack. Pete, you need to go get ready for school."
"Pops this really isn't necessary, I'm not that injured."
2) Go to Wades, pretend you’ll stop being Spiderman so he lets you stay and doesn’t tell your parents
"You think I have dreamy eyes? Maybe I married the wrong man..."
"No. I haven't forgiven you yet Captain so don't call me baby and don't touch me." Tony says, taking two steps back.
"Dad no..."
Peter ignored the shouts and continued to fight, swinging onto one of the ships. The aliens, unfortunately, saw this coming and while Peter fought two of them, another drove the ship towards the lake they were fighting near. The aliens pushed Peter off the ship, and while he tried to   Use his webs, he realized he had run out.
"Maybe we do, but it's not like I'm going to get the chance to date him any time soon. Even when I do tell my parents I'm Spider-Man and friends with him, I doubt they will let me date him. They kinda hate him. And they will think he's too old which is ridiculous since my Dad is like 15 years older than my Pops but my Pops is really like 52 years older than my dad. Can you please just, not tell them?"
4) buy a plane ticket and go stay at one of the other mansions his dad owns.
“Since our dads decided they want nothing to do with each other? It’s ok. It’s not like you had anything to do with it.” Harry tried to give Peter an encouraging smile but despite the years of not speaking, Peter knows him well and knew it was fake. “So what did you lie about anyway? You never lied to your dads. Even when I tried to get you to lie, you always said lying was wrong and told them the truth.”
"Dad I already am a hero..."
"How did you..."
Tony got up and went to the closet in their bedroom. He reached inside and grabbed a big box. The first frame he pulled out had three pictures in it.
________6 AM, Stark Tower________
"Hello darling, are you excited for today?" Steve said, grinning despite the nervousness about letting his only daughter go to an all day camp that includes swimming, alone. He knows it is a bit hypocritical of him to not want his daughter to go due to her small nature but he can't help but worry, similarly to how everyone worried about him all those years ago.
"No Mr. Stark, Peter has not been located."
"Peter Stark-Rogers you are NOT a hero. You will NOT be putting your life on the line anymore and you will NEVER be Spider-Man again!" His Pops all but shouted in his Captain America voice.
"Sorry uncle Bruce!"
“Tony, what were you dreaming about?” Steve said softly, sitting down and gently pulling his husbands' hands away from his face.
This was a kind of nervous that Peter had not felt in a long time. Not like when he lied to his parents about his whereabouts, not even like when Wade and he would talk. Sitting on Harry Osborne couch for the first time in months made him the kind of nervous you would see in a movie. Lots of sweating, leg bouncing, cheeks flushed. God what was wrong with him! What made Harry so fucking special? Peter stares at the floor, trying to get his shit together.
So Peter remained in his Pops arms, with his Dad sitting next to him, eating pizza and laughing with the rest of his family. Relieved that for now, he had still managed to keep his secret safe.
Everyone is silent, when finally Nat decides she’s not going to sit around and get bullied into silence.
Peter was right, it was fun. Everyone made Gingerbread people who looked like them and his Dad, Uncle Clint and Uncle Thor got into an icing fight when Thor ate his Dad and Clint's men. Peter couldn't have been happier. More than anything else, Peter was just happy that maybe not every tradition was gone, and that maybe his family would eventually be completely ok.
"Tony look, I know you are angry and hurt and rightfully so but Peter is having a panic attack and needs to see you now."
Ned sat in the spinning chair in Peters room, messing around with a pair of Peters old web shooters.
"Great, so ill let the team know we are headed back and..."
Harry took Peters hand and brought him upstairs to his room. He went to go lay on the bed and pulled peter with him. Harry scooted back so his back was firmly against his head rest and Peter sat in front of him.
and continued to hug his best friend, trying to ignore the feelings of failure he still felt.
With nothing to do Peter decided to relax because, for this moment, he had his life completely sorted out.
"I'm sure he's ok Tony. Oh and, don't worry about Bucky and Steve going on this mission together. Your eyes are way more dreamier than his and Steve loves you with all his heart."
"Get out."
“We have all already lost one child. Do we want to lose another?”
Steve chuckles and kisses Tony on the cheek, when his phone rings. The name Peter appearing.
Peter had been in school for two months and things were fine. Yet ever since the other day, it was his home life that seemed weird.
"Aren't I always?"
Tony falls to the ground when Steve says the three words that could break any dads heart,
“And then what Steve? I can make this building so airtight that Peter won’t be able to go to the bathroom without one of us knowing, but then what? Does he stop speaking to us? Does he start hating us? And when he becomes old enough... he will leave. I don’t want that. I don’t want to lose him. I want to be able to look out for him all the time and if we push him away we won’t be able too. And if something happens to him... Steve, I won’t make it through that.”
"Papa, which cookie should I decorate for Aunt Tasha? And Uncle Rhodey? And Uncle Thor? And what about Peter!? I have to make Peter a cookie, and..."
"Yup. I know we've all talked about letting him join the team but I thought making him a new suit would be a nice thing to add onto becoming a member of the avengers."
All three members of the Stark-Rogers family just stared at her, not sure how to react.
“God I feel like such an asshole, I can’t believe the writer made me say all that bullshit...” Wade muttered as he went back inside his apartment, feeling pretty horrible about himself.
"Um... I got hit by a taxi on my way to get the pizzas. I swear I'm ok though Pops, really it was only a couple of bruises, there is no need to over..."
The tension in the room was difficult to handle. Steve and Tony could barely look at Natasha and Clint (who Nat had called after calling the super husbands).
"So am I! What brought this on?"
"Baby no!" Steve rushed over and held Tony's face in his hands, tears now running down his face "I thought you hated me! I don't blame you for what happened to Ellie, I could never blame you for what happened to Ellie. I know you loved her and I know you always tried to protect her. We just couldn't protect her this time. I promise sweetheart I will never leave you, I will never take Peter away." He kissed Tony and then pulled back to look him in the eyes again. "You can't drink anymore though, or hide in the lab. And I can't hide in the gym. We need to stay strong, we need to be there for our son. We are going to love him and protect him and keep moving forward because sitting here, wallowing in self-pity is not going to make this any easier. We can get through this, we have to."
"Are you really trying to tell me that Americas hero symbol wants to stop being a hero?"
"We've seen Spider-Man get thrown and kicked and shot at and bleed... that was our son! I want to go find every single thing that hurt him and shoot them down"
“What am I going to do?” Peter thought to himself as he continued to walk around New York with no plan, nowhere to go, and his feelings hurt by both his parents and Wade.
Peter's eyes began to tear up but he nodded.
"Don't worry Pete, I've got stuff to do anyway. Stay safe and text me with all the gory, badass details from the fight, ok?"
(Steve) "The whole time!? How can you..."
"About bullies. Yes, I know Pops but I can handle it! I'm brave and I'm strong and, and I know that I'm kinda tiny but that doesn't mean I'm not mighty" Peter joked while making a muscle (which although his muscles weren't as prominent as his dad or uncle Thor's, weren't too bad anymore).
Peter looked at him with tears in his eyes, muttered “fuck you wade”, and walked off with his bag in hand.
Sorry that this is so short and that it took forever but my cousins have been over all week and I have had like zero time to myself. I'll post a longer and better chapter soon.
"No!"
The rest of the day went well, he got an A on his math test and he went to Ned's after school for a little while to work on Lego Ned. When he finally got home, he ate Chinese takeout with his family and fell asleep on the couch. His pops carried him to bed and Peter slept, thankful that tomorrow was going to be a calm day full of sleep and homework.
"Tony, calm down."
Tony looks at Peter, then Steve, then Peter again. "Pete, we talked about this. The therapist thinks..."
Peter’s eyes widened, for some reason he had felt like the guy standing in front of him wouldn’t even remember his name.
“Hey...”
As Tony said this, however, his son who despite being 15 still looked like he was 12, walked in.
"SAM I SAID NO." He grabs punching bag number 15.
When he was out of the room Steve fell back on the couch and put his face in his hands, "My boy is spider-man..." he whispered.
Yesterday he had heard his dad and pops arguing. He didn't know what it was about but when he began to listen in he started putting the pieces together
So sorry for the wait! College has been quite a time and I am almost done with my first year! I wasn't sure about this chapter but I hope you like it, I promise I know how this story is going to end it just takes time to get there. Please leave comments, I like them and they motivate me to keep going :). Thank you to the person who commented on Feb 6th, that was my birthday and I enjoyed getting a comment on that day. Also, I hope these pictures that I added in work! If they don't then i'm sorry!
Peter noticed a park and when to go sit on a bench so he could think about what his plan was. He started to think of a few options, so he made a list.
“Peter what the hell?”
"No. Absolutely not. We agreed, you see him on Sunday's and you don't stay long, that's it. You seriously think I'm going to let you go on a mission with your first love after everything!"
“I’m pretty sure your dad would be dead right now if my dad knew that.”
"I'm calling the school, now."
Thor even said that if he were to bring the avengers to Asgard he bets that the one who his people would have loved the most would have been Ellie because she was the “kindest and one of the smartest young humans he had ever met”.
"I know we did that Pops, I've seen pictures. Maybe we can start a new tradition where we do them on the 13th, and instead of making all kinds of cookies we can just make gingerbread men and a gingerbread house."
"Um, he only really hit me in the eye, he shoved me to the ground and down a few steps so I know I probably bruised a rib or two and my elbows. Besides that I'm fine. Really Dad's, I swear."
If they didn't remember her, he wouldn't see the twinge of sadness any time he or his dad made "puppy dog eyes" towards his pops, his sister was the master of them. He wouldn't see the happy yet slightly pained look on his dad's face any time he got an academic achievement at school because his sister had been incredibly bright and probably would have graduated high school by 12 is she had lived that long. The way uncle Bruce frowns ever so slightly when he offers to help in his lab, the tears that would form in his aunts eyes when he wanted to play spies with Natasha growing up, when he asked Uncle Thor to make his favorite lunch, Ellies favorite lunch and eventually Thor just stopped cooking, the firm no he would receive when he used to ask his fun uncle Clint if he could read with Peter in the vents, like Ellie used to, when he made gifts for uncle Rhodey who would smile at them sadly because he put the one his sister gave him in her grave, when he used to follow Aunt Pepper around and copy her bossy attitude, like Ellie used to and she finally burst into tears and told him to stop. If they didn't remember her, none of these things would happen. But he can't change that. They all remember her. And somehow he had managed to grow up to be so much like her in so many ways. He hated it. What he loved, however, was being Spider-Man.
*crash*
I am soooo sorry. I lost inspiration for a long time but I think I found it again. I promise I will finish this story. I know how I want it to end and it is no where near being over, I just have to get there.
"We didn't know he would react that way. It's been years!" Steve calmly tried to reason with Tony.
Steve started chopping carrots while Peter sat by him and colored, telling Steve all about all the kids in his school who are nice and funny and silly. Steve smiles, loving these moments where his kids go on and on about nothing too important in the big picture but extremely important to them at that moment. Just as Peter starts to talk about the birthday party Jake will be having soon, the phone rings.
"I think so too, I just wish we knew who he was. He seems so young and I just want to make sure he's taken care of."
“That was a low blow, Rodgers. You know damn well we stopped manufacturing weapons years ago. I know the difference between a weapon and my goddamn son, I just have a little more faith in him than you do.”
Peter shook his head slightly. “I have no idea. I miss them so much Harry but you didn’t see them. They were so disappointed. It feels like they hate me. And they want to take Spider-Man away from me! Like they tried to forbid me from being what they are! But I have already been away from them for so long and you know I have the separation anxiety and I just am so sad and scared and I can’t give up being spider-man but I also can’t hide from them forever..”
Natasha and Clint looked at each other once again before looking back at him.
He walked over to his husband, Rhodey, Bruce and Thor. Rhodey was glaring at him slightly while Tony for the first time in years looked almost nervous while near him. Steve sighed and knelt down, grabbing Tony’s hands.
"Seriously? I knew that was a bad move. Peter, what did you hurt? Does your head feel ok? How about your wrist, don't think I didn't see you wince when you moved it."
Tony rolls his eyes and smiles slightly, wrapping his arms loosely around Steves' neck. "Dammit Steve, keep doing that and you might get forgiven a lot sooner"
As Tony got back to the tower as fast as he could, he thought about Peters last Panic attack 5 years ago (Think, Tom Holland in the impossible if you want a visual). Peter knew how Ellie had died and yet the idea of swimming didn't bother him. He was a great swimmer. However, when Peter was 10, his dad's realized not all scars heal completely.
Peter smiles at Clint before heading towards the lab, his dads and deadpool on his mind.
"You do realize your Pops and I have surveillance cameras around the entire school, right?"
"Pops, I promise this has nothing to do with my separation anxiety and has more to do with you and Dad going to Costa Rica for an entire weekend without me," Peter replied quietly, his pops not believing a word of it.
Steve looked at who was calling and almost didn’t answer when at the last second he decided to pick up the phone.
When Natasha woke she found a note on the air mattress. It made her feel worse than having Steve and Tony kick her out. Her nephew still didn’t know how proud she was of him. He still thought she believed his sister was better.
"Steve, honey, how about I make the call. You are a little too angry to handle this, why don't you help Peter back downstairs and I'll go make sure the school deals with the asshole who keeps hurting our kid."
"Oh no, I couldn't..."
Peter came into the apartment, noticing how clean it was. It looked like you could pack a suitcase and leave at any moment and no one would know anyone had ever lived there. The bed was one of those kind that went into the wall, the kitchen was spotless, and only a few pictures were up. Three of them he wasn’t surprised to see, One of his aunt and his uncle Bruce, one of his aunt and his uncle Clint, and one of his whole family. But two of them did surprise him. One was of him when he was really small, it was in black and white and he was pulling his bottom lip down while wearing overalls. He’d never seen the picture before. The other was in a goofy looking frame, and it was of his sister. She looked surprised and she was wearing a straw hat and a blue dress. He was shocked by how much she looked like his dad. Her hair was slightly lighter but besides that she had his eyes, his nose, his mouth. She looked like she was around 4 in the picture.
Peter nodded, now suddenly not as angry about the cameras.
"You're being ridiculous."
Eliana, who everyone referred to as Ellie, was her daddy's daughter in almost every way. She was a genius, ready for 6th grade at the age of only 9. She was determined and stubborn, though Tony swears those traits came from Steve, and she never stopped talking. Although, she did get a thing or two from her Papa. She hated bullies, she believed she could do anything and nothing would stop her, and she was incredibly small. She was just under four feet, but with her determination and her positive attitude, you would think she was a fully grown woman. Steve worried about her height, he knew that he and Tony were very stubborn as was Ellie and that she would get herself into trouble like he used to but both Tony and Ellie told him not to worry, that although she was small she was mighty. Ellie was a beauty, she had long flowing brown hair and big brown eyes, traits she clearly inherited from Tony.
Tony looked up at him and smiled, "so when should we make our grand exit?"
“You’re right. It’s time. But Tony... Peter being Spider-Man is just something that I cannot agree with. And he needs to know that lying and running away does not get him what he wants.”
"How could you trust them, but not me and your pops?" Peter looked at his Dad who didn't even look angry anymore, just hurt.
"Fuck..." Bruce muttered, running off to go call Rhodey, knowing that besides Steve and Peter, he was the only one who could really get Tony out of there. Thor followed close behind.
When Peter was finally calm and asleep and the rest of the team was busy, Tony and Steve stepped into the kitchen and talked.
"Dad, I'm fine. Pops, you don't need to hold me like I'm made of glass. I'm ok. Where's Ned?"
Fuck, he was even more fucked.
“Tony please...”
"What???"
Peter put his phone on his bed and then quickly changed into his suit. He started looking for some cologne when he heard "What the fuck?"
"Trust me baby doll, they are missing you twice as much as you miss them."
"Son of Stark! You must help us decide what movie we must watch on this day!" Thor booms, walking over and hugging Peter just a little too tightly.
Peter tried to return the smile and followed his uncle.
“What movie should we watch today, romance, horror, sci fi or comedy?”
"Wow, that's been whole years worth of lego building, I'm impressed." Peter said while unwrapping his muffin.
His pops froze
"I know Tony, I'm just..."
Sitting here now, years later, Peter found himself just as calm as he was all the other times they had done this. He was glad to know that despite everything, he could still count on Harry.
“I wanna go home I wanna go home. I miss my dad, I miss my papa, I miss my bed and my home. I want my dads”
Peter hasn’t talked to him in a few years, not since Tony got into a fight with his dad. They used to be really close, (and Peter did use to have a small crush on him) so he hoped that now he would help him out. Peter walked up to his door, all of a sudden incredibly nervous and knocked.
"DAD!"
"DAD WATCH OUT!" Peter quickly webbed the aliens while another one shot him in the leg. The bullet grazed him but besides that he was fine.
"Pops? Guys? What's wrong? Where is Dad?"
Peters' eyes swelled up, tears started falling on the glass
________________________________
“By the time the lifeguard got to her!?!? What the hell was the lifeguard doing???” Steve shouted at the paramedic.
Tony walked into the building and didn't even look at his husband. He marched right over to his son and took his face in his hands.
"Peter, family meeting in the living room," Bruce said, trying to offer up a smile.
Tony smiles at how happy he and Steve look whole holding their baby. He decides that he is going to put it next to the three pictures frame that holds pictures of Peter.
I'm so sorry, my last season of swimming just started so 3-hour practices, plus more babysitting, plus getting ready for senior year means less time to do what I want. I hope you guys like this chapter, sorry that I don't post as much as I should.
"No! You don't understand, I need Spider-Man! I need to feel special! I need to save people! I need to help my dads! I can't lose them, I can't lose my dads and I can't lose the one thing that makes me special, makes me different from Ellie. If I lose that then I have nothing. Please, please don't tell them."
“They took my suit! They don’t trust me anymore, you should have seen the look on my dads face. He has never looked so disappointed. And my pops is so angry... I’ve never seen him so angry. I can’t live with them while they are like this, it’s too much.” Tears started falling from Peters eyes.
“I know that totally fucking sucks Pete and I think that you make a great hero, but maybe your parents are right that you should wait a few years.”
"Fuck off Clint, I really don't care if it's legal. What are they gonna do, sue me? They wouldn't dare."
“Petey, sweetheart, why are your daddies crying?” Peter shrugs his shoulders as Natasha picks Peter up and she and Clint begin to head towards the kitchen, where they find Steve on the floor crying and Tony looking for his car keys with tears in his eyes.
"No movie, you've got school tomorrow. But we will eat and tell you about the mission." His Pops responded.
“I have faith in him, Tony! But I don’t want to have faith in him! I don’t want to think about him being on the field or fighting Aliens or anything of the sort! I want him to go to college, fall in love, get a job, be happy!”
"Yes..."
_________________November 20th___________
"But Pop..."
"Pops... papa... it's my fault, not Tasha's, not Clint's, how could you just kick them out like that?" Peter looked up at his pops with tears in his eyes.
“But Steve... this makes him happy.”
"I'm being serious."
_______At School_________
Steve screams and falls to his knees when he here's what the person has to say.
Peter sat back down on the bench and began to deactivate the tracker. He knew that his dads had put one in when they gave it to him, and about a month ago he figured out how to deactivate it. He never thought he would need to.
(Dear Aunt Natasha, I am very sorry that I have caused you so much pain. I can’t lose Spider-Man and I can’t go home yet. I am going somewhere where I will be allowed to be myself. I hope you can understand, and I hope my Russian is fine, I know that I was not as good as Eliana but I tried. Love, Peter
"What?"
With nowhere to go and feeling pretty bad about himself, Peter walked down the street away from wades house, unsure of where he was going.
"You also happen to be extremely clumsy no matter how careful you try to be."
Peter shivers, from both the fear and the cold water and looks his father in the eyes.
"Steve, its fine. Peter was in the suit for 10 minutes and he's perfectly safe. Bruce and I had it under control and Peter had a blast!"
It was a sight Tony would never forget. Worse than his parents dying, worse than almost dying in space, the sight of his little girl in her pink and green swimsuit, wet and motionless, broke him. He kneeled down on the ground, trying to get as close to her body as possible.
"Please, this is the only thing I have that she didn't have, you compared everything I did, do and want to do with what she did and I can't. I can't handle this anymore."
"True," Tony chuckles slightly, "but just because I occasionally choose to ignore mine doesn't mean we are going to ignore yours."
Wade tried to put his hand on Peters shoulder in a comforting way but Peter shrugged it off, a hurt look on his face.
"HOW THE FUCK WOULD EITHER OF YOU KNOW WHAT ELIANA WOULD HAVE DONE AT MY AGE? SHE FUCKING DIED! SHE WAS ONLY 9! FOR ALL YOU KNOW SHE COULD HAVE ENDED UP BEING A HOOKER OR AN ALCOHOLIC LIKE DAD OR SHE COULD HAVE JOINED THE ARMY OR HELL, MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SUPERHERO JUST LIKE HER FUCKING PARENTS. BUT WE WILL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE SHE IS FUCKING GONE AND YOU NEED TO LET IT GO. HOW CAN YOU COMPARE ME TO SOMEONE WHO WAS ONLY ON THIS FUCKING EARTH FOR 9 YEARS? SHE WAS SUPER SMART, MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A SUIT LIKE DADS AND BECAME ANOTHER IRON-MAN. YOU. DONT. KNOW. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW. LET IT FUCKING GO. I CAN'T TAKE BEING COMPARED TO HER ANYMORE AND I CANT TAKE YOU GUYS WATCHING ME ALL THE DAMN TIME JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. I UNDERSTAND THAT I LIED AND I PUT MYSELF IN DANGER AND THAT YOU DONT THINK I SHOULD BE SPIDER-MAN ANYMORE, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IF YOU DON'T STOP COMPARING ME TO THE CHILD YOU BARELY HAD I WILL WALK THE FUCK OUT OF HERE AND NEVER COME THE FUCK BACK."
"Peter, do you need to see a doctor that isn't me?"
When Peter woke up a few hours later he went to go find his Dads.
"So Peter, how long have you been close to Wade?"
Suddenly, this Thanksgiving just got a lot happier.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Well... you’re looking at him”
As Steve went for his 5 am jog he thought about his life. Steve never imagined his life would be like this. He never dreamed that he would be living with his husband, Howard Starks genius son Tony, in the year 2023, with a nine-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. He thought his life would be more tragic, more lonely. Instead, he managed to marry the most beautiful and amazing man and create two of the best children in the world, modern technology making it so that Tony and Steve were able to use both of their DNA to create children.
"Love you too Pops."
Tony raised his eyebrows for a moment before laughing and pulling Peter towards him, both of them walking over to Tony's array of suits, eager to pick the next one Peter would be trying on.
"no dumbass, we like Peter, plus who wants to clean all that up"
"...you think we compare you to Eliana a lot? You think that because you happen to be a lot like your sister that means we love you any less? Peter you are our everything, you are everything she was and so much more because your personalities were very different growing up and because we got to see more of who you were meant to be. But you do and say so many things that she used to do and say and you are a constant reminder that she never got to where you are now. She never got to turn 10! She will never have a sweet 16, she will never have a 21st birthday, she will never have a partner or kids or go to high school or college, you didn't grow up with a sibling. You grew up with a faint memory of a wonderful girl and that breaks our hearts. You are a constant memory of happiness and joy and yet you are also a reminder of something that we all lost. We have tried to move on but the loss of a child is something you never quite get over and you knew that, you knew the pain that this entire family still has in their hearts when we think about Ellie and yet you risked your life over and over, you lied to me and your dad over and over, you had your aunt and Uncle lie to us for two months. I understand where you might be coming from, hell I know your dad does because he was compared to his dads pride and joy, me, when he was young but to stand by our side during battles that we may not survive.."
“Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers, it appears that your daughter was attempting to take the swim test and she was unable to complete it. By the time the lifeguard got to her… she was already gone.” the paramedic at the scene explained as calmly as she could.
“Jarvis, override system. Code word: Spangled. Shut cameras in Peters room down”.
"because we are robbing the cradle and he is just a kid"
"You don't trust me anymore?"
"But Dad, if you just let me try it on for 5 minutes I'll stop asking you. You've showed me each individual piece, I have tried them all on individually, I hovered above the ground effortlessly like 3 times, I've got this. Pops just thinks he has to monitor me but I know you and uncle Bruce would be able to monitor me just fine!"
"Aunt Tasha I can't be completely honest when I know all my freedom will be lost if I am. Look can we please talk about this later? I'm trying not to think about my parents."
Peter reassured Natasha and Thor that no one needed to die, he told Bruce that a doctor is unnecessary and reluctantly told Clint that no, he did not get any hits in.
"maybe we should kill him/"
"Tony, maybe we should just go home early"
The last one in the box is another frame with two pictures. The picture of Ellie is of her running towards the water with an America swimsuit on. That was probably the only time she ever got in trouble, Steve and Tony told her that if she ran towards the water again without them then they would go home immediately. The picture of Peter is him learning to swim a bit after Ellie died.
"But you guys do like each other, he was holding your hand and you guys were sitting really close to each other." Clint pointed out.
"Honey bear, I'm sorry but I can't. If I leave I'm going to have to face my husband, who I feel like I have failed and my son who has almost died multiple times in the past few months because he is a superhero, and he was too scared to tell us. He didn't trust me. I can't... I can't face them yet. I know Peter is going to try to take his suit back so I'm just going to continue working on it, making it the safest fucking super suit anyone has ever seen. That's all I want to do."
"Look, Fury made the last call and he wants to see how Bucky and I do when it comes to fighting side by side. The mission is simple and once it's done I promise I will spend as much time as possible with you and Peter. I won't even visit him the next few weeks. Just please, Tony, try to be reasonable."
Peter turned to look at his aunt, not realizing that he was holding the picture of Eliana.
"Sam he almost DROWNED. And when we pulled him out of the water and we pulled his mask off I got flashbacks to that moment at the pool... seeing Ellie and seeing Tony crumble when he saw her laying there..."

Дорогая тетя Наташа, мне очень жаль, что причинил тебе столько боли. Я не могу потерять себя человеком-пауком и пока не могу пойти домой. Я иду куда-нибудь, где мне будет позволено быть собой. Я надеюсь, что вы можете понять, и я надеюсь, что мой русский в порядке, я знаю, что я был не так хорош, как Элиана, но я пытался. любовь, питер
Wade looked into the kids eyes and saw just how sad he was making Peter, and even though a big part of him wanted to push all logic aside and be like “fuck your family, go be the kick ass hero I know you are”, he knew that the right thing to do was to make Peter understand that running away and continuing to be a hero without his parents permission was a mistake.
"Uncle Bruce I..."
Tony wiped away a tear that fell as he brought out the photos.
"You promise you'll be careful? When you're in battle, when you're swinging around New York, always?"
