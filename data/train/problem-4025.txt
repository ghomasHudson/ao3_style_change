“Dean,” Sam says again, which causes Dean to look up. The expression on Sam’s face, painted with pity, tells him that his search is pointless.
The whole time he’s there he keeps his eyes averted from the dungeon, focusing on the boxes and their labels.
“I think I’ve got something.”
Castiel peeled his eyes from Dean to his fingers for a second before they were drawn back again. “It was meant to be a surprise.”
On the day he moves in though, Dean doesn’t even know where to start. It seems like there’s too much wrong with the place. The kitchen is the worst room in the house – stained walls from leaky pipes, mould in the corners. Nothing but the flickering light overhead to help him see at night. It’s definitely going to take the longest time to fix.
“Did he?”
With the palm of his hands he caressed the dough, Dean’s soft skin, and with a gentle press of the rolling pin he reassured the cracks from the surface like creases from his brow. He draped the pastry over the tin like a blanket over his sleeping body, his fingers tucking him in as he moulded the dough to the grooves of the metal. Like scissors through gauze, he trimmed the edges and used the scraps to patch the rips, bandages on Dean’s wounds. He tilted the pot and poured the filling into the centre, easing it over the pastry with small, careful circles, like the back of the spoon was his thumb on the blushed apple of Dean’s cheek. Finally, as he weaved the lattice on top, he thought of their fingers lacing.
“I suppose that was his destiny,” Cas sighs, and there’s a sadness in his eyes.
“They are,” Jack agrees, before moving back a little. “We’ve got to be careful of the bees. They’re friendly but if they get scared they can sting.”
Now he needs space. The only place he can think of is the dungeon and he heads there as fast as his weary legs will take him.
“You want me to get down on one knee? Is that it?” Dean grabs the box from Castiel’s loose grip and drops to the floor. “Cas, marry me goddammit.” His voice is shaky, his brows pulled to a point, and he looks around for a moment before he says, “I- I can’t think of the right words to say. For years I’ve been trying, but there aren’t enough to explain. I just need to spend the rest of my life with you, okay? So, marry me.”
Dean’s stomach drops, his breath catches, and it’s all he can do to stay standing.
Voice small and raspy, Dean replies “Uh, sorry. Lost track of time.”
some people didn't mind how the finale ended, but chances are, if you’re reading this fic, you were somewhat hurt like i was. i know i see a lot of myself in these characters, and to see them treated the way they were was genuinely upsetting. cas, removed from our screens the moment of his coming out, and dean, only finding happiness in death. this has nothing to do with the ship. the finale’s message was hopeless and dangerous. it told us that we are trapped by our circumstances, doomed to be the product of whatever life throws at us. it told us that people who have suffered do not get relief or peace until they die.
Then there’s the soft tapping of the rain on the windscreen, muffled from the inside of the Impala, and a vibrating on the dash. He opens his eyes again. Neck stiff, Dean sits back, head throbbing. It’s still dark out, and he can’t tell how long he’s been out for.
Brand new and already peeling, Dean decides the first thing to do is rip up the ugly green wallpaper. Of course when he does he finds cracks in the wall lurking underneath. The newness of the wallpaper makes sense now, a hasty coverup by the previous owner.
“Oh that’s right,” Meg lets out a laugh, “you think you save people now.”
It’s been five years since Dean rescued Cas from the Empty, and in their beach chairs, sand beneath their feet, hand in hand, they watch Sam spin Isla around, Eileen close by, beaming.
“Some freak jumped Cas. Obviously, you kicked its ass, right?”
“And why’s that?”
Then he realises, and there’s the burn of hope in his chest, and his heart, still recovering from his nightmare, stops. Too caught up in his loss, he failed to realise sooner.
“Dean I-,” Castiel starts, unable to put how grateful he is into words. It’s an impossible task. He doesn’t even know where to start. “It’s perfect. Thank you.”
his sacrifice to mean something.”
His confusion must’ve been written on his face, because Dean laughs and adds, “Usually the person whose birthday it is gets the slice with the most icing or a specific part of the design.”
“A surprise?” Dean raised an eyebrow, before turning to the beer at his side, releasing one from its package and twisting off the top. He leaned against the counter; one leg crossed over the other and took a swig.
“No I mean it, Dean. I know this isn’t what you had planned for when we moved in.”
Dean clears his throat again. “I’m not so sure.” He needs to change the subject. “What I am sure about though is that none of this would’ve been possible without him. We owe him everything.”
He checks his phone for the time. The display says it’s three in the morning. Dean knows he should go back to bed, but his heart still feels like it’s trying to escape his ribcage, and he decides he should probably do something to work on the house while he waits to get sleepy again.
“Cas? You okay, right?” He can’t hide the concern in his words.
In between licks, Dean tucked his tongue into the corner of his lips and reached into the back pocket of his jeans. He pulled out a black and white photograph.
? Did Cas say something to you before he…?” He doesn’t finish his sentence and Dean has never been more grateful.
With misty, grieving, gazes, the two share a heartbroken smile. Too many years stolen by self-imposed silence. So many moments lost. Finally, though, the words that had rung in his ears since the moment he’d heard them make sense. His happiness, this whole time, was in just saying it.
Fighting it won’t bring him back. Nothing will.
“Cas?”
“Hey, we’ll figure it out. Cas, buddy, I need you.”
“You sure you’re okay?.”
Once on the road, Chuck’s words follow Dean like they’re in the back seat, and he puts all his focus on driving. He didn’t expect that on the way home they’d still be there, taking up even more space with the newest seat made empty by Jack’s departure.
Cas breathes heavily, all his weight on Dean. “Yes, it’s just…my grace. I just need to recover.”
Soon enough, they’ll both be where they should be. Monsters belonged in Purgatory. Dean was no monster.
There is that smug look again, and Castiel couldn’t help but let the ever-building frustration seep into his words when he bites out, “If he knows I’m alive, he won’t leave. So, I think it’s in your best interest that he doesn’t know we had this conversation. Don’t you?”
Cas turns his attention from Miracle to Dean, a crease in his brow. “Dean, you don’t like dogs.”
Cas’s eyes are wide, tears pooling at the bottom, and like raindrops would trickle from flower petals under clear skies, they spill over his white rose lids and wet his cheeks. Dean cups his face, and with his rough, calloused thumb, he brushes them away. He hopes it says everything he wants it to. He hopes Cas knows what he means.
Dean’s smile returns, even wider now, and Castiel falls in love with him for the millionth time.
“Never again, okay? Don’t do that ever again.” His voice wavers much more than he expects it to. Pulling away, he locks eyes with Cas, and his words spill from him, hushed and low. “I’m sorry it took so long, Cas. I’m so sorry.”
The words twist in his chest like knives, and Dean does his best not to react. He can feel Jack and Sam step closer behind him. He’s putting them all at risk by still being here. He shouldn’t be listening to this. He should go.
He works away at the daisy chain, listening intently as Freya tells him about how her Barbie dolls got married, and how Jack and her had cooked them dinner for their anniversary in the playhouse earlier, and when he looks up from his busy hands, he notices that her tongue sits in the corner of her mouth when she’s trying her best to copy him and squash a daisy through the stem of another. He wonders if he’ll ever tire of discovering which endearing Winchester traits she inherited. He doesn’t think he will.
“They’re purple,” Freya says in her little voice, her hands grabbing for the flower closest to her.
“Mmmm, oh wow” his lips smacked around the mouthful of pie, “Cas, I’m not-mmm, not just saying this – this might be the best pie I’ve ever had.”
Castiel takes him in, his eyes wide and joyful, crinkled in the corners, the streak of paint on his cheek, his lips red and coated in pie. He feels his heart swell and realises that love really was the secret ingredient after all. It wasn’t baking that Castiel was good at – it was loving Dean Winchester.
“You know I don’t understand that reference.”
Dean can’t stand to look at it anymore. He takes the penknife from his pocket and starts to carve Cas’s name there. He scratches the
Cas smiles wider. “Just Cas.”
When Cas doesn’t move, Dean pokes at him again. “He’s being such a grinch, isn’t he?” he says to Miracle, who has joined in too, finding a gap and making his way under the covers, licking Castiel’s face all over.
More days pass, and Dean barely sleeps, coffee and adrenaline keeping him fixated on the task at hand, only taking breaks to walk and feed Miracle. Sam tries his best to keep up with him, but Dean tells him to “get some proper shuteye” after he’s fallen asleep at the table for the third day in a row.
On every one of Dean’s broken bones, every cut lip, bruised rib, and pulled muscle, mended with a gentle touch, Cas has etched his name there, so, though he can’t bring himself to finish the carving, he decides that that doesn’t matter. His very atoms are engraved with Cas, and that’s what counts.
Dean swims in the familiar comfortable silence being with Cas brings, and after a little while longer, Cas asks, “How’s Sam?”
It dawns on Castiel how much Jack has grown up, and he wonders when it had happened. It seemed like only yesterday they’d all been terrified that he’d bring the world to its knees, but here he was, holding Freya’s hand and admiring the flowers with her. He was so mature now – nurturing too. He’d taken to being an older brother so naturally. Castiel thought back to a night, when Freya had just been born, when he’d overheard him and Dean having a conversation as he passed Jack’s room on the landing. Jack hadn’t been sleeping well for a few days, and Dean had finally managed to get Jack to confess that it was because he was worried about Freya. He was worried that he wouldn’t be good enough brother – that he couldn’t be as good as Dean was to Sam. Dean’s voice was serious and low when he told Jack that he wasn’t responsible for her – that she had enough people that loved her that he just needed to look out for her, but it wasn’t his job to take care of her. It had surprised Castiel to hear Dean say that, but he’d appreciated it. Castiel hadn’t wanted Jack to feel that same burden that had plagued Dean his entire life, and it was clear that Dean didn’t either.
Heart racing, forehead sweaty, Dean jolts up from his bed. In the early morning silence, his shallow breaths seem deafening.
“Sam’s good. Settled down with Eileen.”
He stands up, helping Castiel to his feet as he does. Castiel is tired, and the thought of walking upstairs, to a cold, empty bedroom, with only unpacked boxes for company, is enough to make his achy bones want to shiver again. “Dean, the sofa’s fine.”
“Hey, you sure you’re okay? If it’s getting worse I can call a doctor or-“
Then Dean laughs, and Castiel knows this is real. Nothing Castiel could imagine would ever fill him with so much joy.
With butterflies in his chest, Dean feels like a freckle-faced school boy, and it’s hard to believe he kept himself from this feeling, this happiness, for so long.
“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” the vampire interrupts, sudden realisation spreading on that already insufferably smug face, “You must be that angel I’ve been hearing about.” He lets out another laugh. “Well shit. You do exist.”
“Dude,” Dean is quick to jump to Castiel’s defence. Castiel wishes he weren’t.
After a moment, he finally managed, “But I- I don’t have a birthday.”
“Okay, okay,” Sam chuckles as he puts her down. As soon as her feet touch to cobblestone, she takes off up the path and into Dean’s arms.
“Dean? It’s midnight. What’s up? Are you good?”
Castiel tried his best to hold back a smile – sometimes, he liked to play innocent just to see the look on Dean’s face. “Yes, the fence looks much better painted.”
[END OF CHAPTER TWO]
Castiel still can’t meet Dean’s eyes.
“Enjoying the view?” Dean smirked, straightening up.
It’s quiet again, and for the first time since getting Cas back, Dean looks away from him, eyes on his own feet that shuffle below him.
“Do you know what the empty’s like, Dean? Do you want to know what he’s doing in there?”
Cas doesn’t say anything.
this isn't true, so with this fic i wanted to fix it. i hope i succeeded, but just in case it didn't come across, i want to tell anyone reading this directly to keep fighting, no matter how bad the odds are, to love others no matter how many times your heart has been broken, to build your own path even when it seems like everything has been chosen for you. most of all, i want you to know that you are worthy of a happy ending, you are deserving of love and you will find happiness, even if now it doesn't seem like it. you don’t need to earn love or family or belonging - just by being here on this earth, you deserve it.
on the table again, and from the depths of himself he feels the guilt inch is way up his insides. He swallows it down, and tries to remember why Cas was taken in the first place.
“What?” Sam looks concerned.
“Sometimes. Never got the Nurse Winchester treatment though – just had to push through it until it passed.”
They’re still far enough away that Castiel could lead them elsewhere. He could get them away from Dean. They’re sensing his grace, and after years of being sealed away by God and forced to prey upon each other whilst the angels stayed in Heaven, any leviathan would relish ripping Castiel to shreds. But without hunger, humans are worthless to them in here, and so if Castiel left, they would follow him, and Dean would only have to handle the regular monsters. If Castiel left, Dean would be safe.
Baby’s headlights highlight just how endless the empty road is, the tarmac and the night sky merging into one, never-ending void.
The first note plays. It’s
He could feel tears pooling in his eyes, his vision blurry. Crying in public was not something he’d ever needed to worry about until now, but he’d learned from watching Dean over the years that it should be avoided at all costs. Dean couldn’t have taught him the most important part of that lesson, however – that it’s practically impossible to stop the tears from spilling over when the people you’ve spent years loving show you that they love you right back, and you actually believe it.
Of course, Miracle is by his side every turn of a wrench, every stroke of a brush.
“Boys can’t be pretty,” Freya says.
Damn rain, he can’t see a thing. It’s only when the wipers don’t make his view any clearer that he realises he’s crying. The headlights on the road blur, and though he tries to blink away the tears they’re already falling down his face.
He’d left Heaven. He’d left his brothers and sisters. He’d left Sam and he’d left Dean. Castiel isn’t leaving this time. He just has to make sure that Dean doesn’t find him. With Benny relying on him, Dean will come to his senses eventually.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckles.
He can’t move. He wants to hold Cas close. He wants to keep him safe and to never let him go, but he can’t step forward, and he can’t move his arms. Stuck in place, a weeping statue, he’s forced to watch and powerless to stop it.
Then Dean remembers the phrase he taught himself a few days before. It was midnight, and despite being tired, he couldn’t drift off. Next to him though, Cas was fast asleep, and Dean was enamoured by his slow, deep breaths, and his tiny snores, and the mess of his hair at the front where he fell asleep with his hands in it. With everything in him, Dean felt so in love with him, and he wanted to wake him up just to tell him. He didn’t though.
[PRAYER 27]
It’s unusual for Dean to be this animated at this time of morning. Usually Castiel has to coax him from under the covers with the promise of coffee and bacon for breakfast. This must be how he feels every time.
Hollowed and tight, Dean’s chest aches. He just wants to see him one last time.
At mention of Cas’s name Miracle’s tail wags faster than Dean’s ever seen it, and he watches him run over to him. Cas stands stiff, eyes fixed on the mess of fur that is jumping up to greet him.
Castiel returns to that stream often. There’s always a wave of guilt that rises from deep within his gut, whenever he does. When his eyes are closed though, he can push down that overfamiliar sensation just long enough to feel like his old self. As long as he’s still in Purgatory, he’s allowed to remember the things he fell for on Earth. That was the closest to home he’d ever feel again.
After Dean had finished eating, he went back to work. Castiel had washed the dishes and was now back at the table outside. He was too engrossed in his cookbook to notice that Dean had sneaked back to the kitchen more than once to steal a few more mouthfuls of pie. It was only when Castiel asked him if he liked doughnuts and got no response that he looked up from the page. The fence was now completely painted, the brush resting on top of the paint can in the grass. Castiel looked around. Dean was nowhere to be seen. Castiel stood up, leaving the book on the table, and headed inside.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I want him back, too.”
“You’d have loved to have seen Jack playing with Freya. He’s a good brother to her. I wish you could have seen them together because you’d have been so proud.” He smiles and thinks about how Kelly would have looked if she’d been there that afternoon – skin bronzed, smile wide, her infinitely kind expression and her hand squeezing Castiel’s as they watched them play.
Bringing a hand to his face, Dean rubs his eyes, willing them to stay dry, and turns back to face his brother. He lowers his voice, trying his best to hide the how it wavers. “I’ll be fine, okay?”
“Come on, scooch. Doctor’s orders.”
He always finds time to talk to Cas too. He knows his prayers probably don’t get through, but just in case they do, he wants to make sure Cas knows he’s not forgotten, and that even though he’s far away, he’ll always have a place with Dean.
He could live with Dean believing he was a coward. It would hurt, but if it kept Dean safe – if it kept him alive – he could live with it. He’d be okay.
“So what is?”
“You wish you told him, though, don’t you?” Chuck steps closer, his face inches apart from Dean’s now. “In the moment you were just poor little helpless Dean Winchester, a teary-eyed, scared little boy, losing the only true thing you ever had. The only thing that you knew was real. The only thing that could’ve made you happy.”
“Could be better, could be worse,” he replies, trying to smile, but the truth is Dean doesn’t really know how he’s holding up, and he doesn’t know where to start to explain. “You?”
“Hey, Boy,” he says, his voice low and rough, trying to catch his breath.
Freya is still on his shoulders when they return, Dean swinging her legs as they walk. “Okay, who’s gonna take this little rugrat while I cook the burgers?” he says, reaching up to tickle her sides. Her giggle chimes through the garden.
Castiel turns his head back and sees Dean, a cake in his hands, heading down the steps.
“I’m still not letting you out of my sight though.”
Cas came back that time too though.
Something sad in Sam’s eyes, it’s obvious he’s worried, but he lets Dean go regardless. He probably needs a break from him anyway, Dean thinks. Sam didn’t want to be around John Winchester Jr. all those years ago. Why would he want to now?
“Uncle Dean!” Freya chimes, squirming in Sam’s arms as soon as she sees him. From across the garden, Dean turns his head, his eyes glinting, his face beaming.
“You too, Dean.”
Ever since he’d met Dean, he’d felt something – a pull. There was something about him that was so intoxicating. He wanted to know everything about him, to follow him anywhere, and he’d take whatever he could get – he was thankful for whatever Dean gave him, and that meant he never let himself hope for more. Even after Dean had kissed him, and moved in with him, and talked like they’d be together forever, he’d never let himself believe that one day Dean would want him around enough to make it official. Maybe in moments of weakness, like when Dean and Jack were asleep and he was left to his thoughts for the night, his mind had drifted, but Castiel knew it would kill him if he hoped and Dean took it all away – if he told him to go again – so he never let himself hope.
Miracle barks again, and Dean is brought back to reality. If he does this, he needs to make sure he comes back. No more bloodshed. No more loss. He’s built a life now, and he can’t lose it. Not so soon.
Stumbling forward, panic clear in his voice, he chases Baby. “There are consequences. There are always consequences. You should kill me now. You know you want to.” He falls to the floor, shaky voice getting quieter as they drive away. “Kill me. Kill me you cowards.”
Sam turns a little to face Dean, his almost permanently fixed anxious frown that has developed recently replaced by sad, sympathetic eyes. “He knew, Dean. Of course he did.”
He strolled up the cobbled path, his eyes wandering over the box planters that lined either side. Dean had built them for Castiel after he’d mentioned in passing that some of his plants had outgrown their pots. His strawberry plants lived in the one closest to the house, but before he’d made a home for them there, they’d refused to grow. He’d watered and fertilised, moved the pots to the sunniest spots so many times he’d lost track. Much to Castiel’s frustration nothing was helping, and he’d almost given up hope of them ever bearing fruit, until a week after moving them to the planter he noticed that they’d started to flower, the berries little green buds with white petal crowns. Today they were ripe, blushed red and shiny amongst the green of the leaves. Dean seemed to have that effect on things.
Not for the first time.
“Okay, okay. I’m awake.” Castiel says, pushing himself up from the comfort of their mattress and away from Miracle’s ambush. He sits up, rubbing the sleep from his half-open eyes.
“But I always gave him a hard time. I was always too hard on him.”
“You really scared me, you idiot,” Dean chuckles as he drops his head and shakes it, “for a minute there I thought you were gonna’ say no.” The relief in his voice is tangible, and Castiel wonders how Dean could ever think that he wouldn’t blindly follow him to the ends of the Earth like he hadn’t already been doing it for fifteen years.
Sam is silent for a moment, and only when Dean is halfway towards the door does he say, “Dean.”
A few feet from the door, something takes shape in the nothingness in front of them. Soon enough, they’re facing an entity in Meg’s shape.
Pulling him from his slumber, Castiel feels someone shove on his shoulder. “Cas, wake up!”
“You good?” Dean manages, voice wrecked. Cas nods, but he’s swaying a little, and Dean knows he needs to get them both out of there. With his last remaining shred of energy, he pushes himself up, hauling Cas to his feet again with him, and supporting each other, arm in arm, they stumble their way to the portal door and step back through. Not two moments after does it close again.
In his search he knocks something to the floor and his heart stops, his body jolting upright.
They start off slow. Dean’s thankful for that.
“Be right there, little lady,” Dean calls back, and then in a hushed tone says, “Duty calls.” Squeezing Cas’s hand and planting a kiss on his forehead before he goes, he says, “I love you, Mr. Winchester.”
“I know it’s nothing big,” Dean blurts out, obviously nervous about Castiel’s silence, “but I wanted to get you something with the spare money I got from working at the garage, and we don’t have any pictures together.”
“I like your plants.” Freya says, picking the tiny white flowers that dotted the ground in front of them.
“You couldn’t even save
He smashes his hands against the steering wheel, then again, and again and again. Completely, defeated, wracked with exhaustion, he slumps forward and rests his head there. All he can do is cry. He cries until his head pounds and the sleeve of his jacket is wet through, and he feels like he can’t breathe.
He did it. He’s safe. They’re both safe.
“Nothing. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s nothing. And little Castiel is surrounded by all the angels he ever betrayed, all the demons he fought on your behalf, thinking about all the times he let you down.”
Then he remembers, and the memory tunnels its way through his chest again, just as it did the first time he lost him.
“How does it feel, Dean? Knowing that he will feel like a disappointment for eternity, and it’s all your fault?”
Castiel decided he liked baking.
Castiel assumes Dean is looking for him because he doesn’t know how to leave, and he knows that Castiel does. He couldn’t tell him himself. The threat of the leviathans was too risky, but if it were the last good thing Castiel could do for the man that had given him everything, he’d find some way to get him out of here. He just needs to find the right person to do it.
Castiel clears his throat, trying to make sure his voice comes out low and intimidating, and not just hoarse from months upon months of disuse.
When he opens his eyes again, he’s jarred back to reality. The stream doesn’t sparkle here, and there is no yellow acacia tree, or hyacinth bush or tulips in amongst the dazzlingly green grass. There is only the grey sky and the muddy ground and that oppressive, stagnant air. Earth, humanity, and Dean – they don’t belong here. This is where monsters live.
Castiel feels his mouth pull into a smile again. He’s sure Dean is joking, but then, only Sam and his Impala are more important to Dean than his tape collection. There is always a chance he’s serious. Castiel doesn’t bother worrying about it though; he’d never get to know whether he likes Dean’s favourite songs anyway.
Dean, behind the wheel of Baby, the background a bright blue sky, free of clouds, and an infinite stretch of searing tarmac. Dean’s favourite song comes on the stereo, and he turns the volume dial the whole way around. Castiel watches him sing along to every word,  a huge grin on his face, the kind of smile goofy enough to make the corner of his eyes crinkle. With one arm out the open window, Dean is drumming to the beat on the warm metal roof, the hand he’s using to keep the wheel steady tapping along too. Those brilliant green eyes sparkle in the sun, and the flecks of gold in them match the freckles across the bridge of his nose and the bronzed skin of his cheeks.
Only a little relieved, Dean stays close to him, holding him close as they make their way up the spiral stairs, and leave through the bunker front door.
It becomes a routine, Dean taking Miracle to work, working his shift, sometimes overtime too, coming back and working on the house through the evening and into the early hours until he finally lets himself rest on the sofa, bones weary and body aching, and, with Miracle across his lap, he drifts off in front of the TV.
With that, Cas’s eyes grow wide beneath his knotted brows, and wild, worried pupils dart from side to side. He pushes himself up from the floor so that he’s sitting, head still resting against Dean’s hand.
Dean shoots up from his pillow, his clothes stuck to his skin, his shallow, shaking breaths echo through the silence of the Bunker. Under the bright light of the lamp beside him, he has to shield his eyes, disoriented and breathing hard. He rubs his eyes, willing away the memory of that nightmare, and all those that came before it, and when he opens them again he’s met with a fuzzy crowd of empty beer bottles, which have definitely gathered around like that to mock him.
“Hey, buddy.” Dean crouches down, holding him in his arms. “Sorry I took so long boy. I told you I’d be back.”
Castiel goes to stand up. “Dean, I can go.”
His handprint, the only thing that proves he was real. It’s as close as he’ll ever get to the real him again.
Even though he feels guilty for not feeling happy all the time, there’s guilt in the happiness too. Though he knows it’s what Cas wanted, it doesn’t feel right to be happy when he can’t be, to live a life that Cas never got to. But he tried to get him back. He tried. That’s all that matters. That’s all he could do.
The pyre might as well have been built from his bones because he burned with Cas that day. He burned until his body was ashes, and like the scorch of his broken wings on the cold, hard ground, Dean’s memories of him were charred black, singed at the corners, the faces in the pictures warped and distorted, everything marred with the knowledge that he was gone, and he was never coming back. Even when the flames died down, that fire never stopped burning. It lived in his throat with each shot of liquor, and behind his eyes after countless sleepless nights, and in the split skin of his knuckles, bloodied from yet another fight he’d picked. It lived where his heart once was, spit flames at the ones he loved, and left his body like the burnt timber frames of the only home he’d ever known before him.
Cas said from the very start that Dean lacked faith, but Dean doesn’t think that’s true anymore. It wasn’t faith he lacked, it was something, or someone, to place it in, and although he may have lost hope, he’d always have faith in Cas. Always.
They spend the night buried in books. Miracle keeps Dean company when Sam accidentally falls asleep, nodding off just after the fourth book of the night. It’s been a long few weeks. Dean can’t blame him for it. The only thing keeping him from sleep himself is the idea that he might have to live through Cas getting taken again.
Before he can process it, the entity switches shapes, and now Jo is standing in front of him.
Sam reads on, “We just need salt and-.”
“You think you save people? You sent me back like a lamb to the slaughter, brother. You didn’t save me. You couldn’t save the angel in Purgatory neither. What makes you think you can save him now?”
Standing at the water’s edge with Isla, he watches it slowly drift away, and just when it seems like it won’t ever return, those gentle waves are rushing right back. Life seems to be that way. When he thought Cas would never return, there he was at the bottom of those steps, and by that stream in Purgatory, and in the cool glow of a payphone under the night sky, seemingly endless in duration.
After a month, the leaky roof is fixed, the boarded-up windows are replaced with glass, and by the second month he’s sanding, painting, glossing, and the inside is finally starting to match the outside.
“Thank you, Dean, for everything.”
“Hey, Cas. Look at me for a second would you?” Dean slows down, and pulls Castiel back. Benny looks over his shoulder and slows his pace a little, but stays a few feet ahead. “I know you thought you were doing the right thing. I’m not mad, Cas. Okay? Hell, I’m grateful. If these past couple of days are anything to go by, you’ve made my time here much easier than it should have been, and it hasn’t been easy.”
“Let me bottom line it for you. I’m not leaving here without you. Understand?”
He listens to the trickling of the water as it sweeps over the rocks, its flow slow and calm, and closes his eyes. Taking in a deep breath, he lets himself imagine that he’s back on Earth.
Dean watches Sam pull back. “I can’t believe it man. You’re really back?”
The world’s at peace. Finally, he and everyone he loves is happy, and to risk that for one person, no matter how integral he was in bringing that happiness, is selfish. If this works, there will be consequences. There are always consequences.
Cas is really here. Dean got him back.
blood.
Castiel steps forward. “Is it true?” He keeps his voice slow and stern, and makes a point to emphasise every word. Castiel may have fallen from Heaven, but he still remembers how to be a soldier when he needs to.
He’s not a coward though, and the truth is, he doesn’t just reciprocate. What he feels for Cas transcends any plane of existence. It survives any and every absence. With everything in him, with everything he has, in the depths of his very soul, he is branded with his unending love for Cas.
Dean laughs, dragging his eyes from the book and back to Sam, who he’s surprised to find is frowning at him. “Why wouldn’t I be? It’s Cas.”
He pulls open the glove compartment and blindly reaches for one of his tapes. Finding one, he pushes it into the stereo and twists the volume up as far as it’ll go.
“Anyway, I remember my mom carrying me upstairs, tucking me in, reading me a story.” It’s easy to hear the smile in Dean’s voice. “My mom was the best at that – making me feel better. Well, when I was a kid, at least. I think it’s a special power moms have or something…” Dean stays quiet for a moment. “Y’know, I think she told me the angels watching over me would make me feel better soon,” Dean laughs at that. “Guess it’s my turn to watch over the angel now. Well, ex-angel anyway.”
[END OF CHAPTER ONE]
[PRAYER 1]
He looked down to Freya, who was mesmerized by the candles’ flames as they flickered in a gust of warm wind, and gave her a quick hug to ground himself. Fearing that he wouldn’t have enough air in his lungs to blow them out, he moves a strand of her hair behind her ear, leans down and says, “Are you gonna help me?”, and then he edges them both forward and closes his eyes. He can only think of one thing to wish for, and it was selfish, but it went round and round in his head.
Of course, Dean would ruin a romantic moment with one of his ridiculous jokes. “That would be funny if it wasn’t true, Dean.”
This is not happening. They’re so close. They’re so close to getting him back. There must be some somewhere. How many times did he bleed for them? They don’t even have one stupid vial. Not even a drop.
in health. Just get some rest, okay?”
Freya starts to whine, wrestling from Castiel’s arms and fighting to run a finger through the icing. There’s a chorus of laughter, and then Eileen comes to take her from Castiel.
“See, that’s just not going to work, because he’s the only one left here.” Meg steps forward. “Turns out, the Nephilim had this planned all along. I guess he knew you’d come searching again. It’s quite pathetic how predictable that is.”
“She has not stopped talking about coming here today,” Sam says as he and Eileen head down the steps and towards the table.
“These are not just monsters, Dean, they’re leviathan. I have a price on my head. And I’ve been trying to stay one step ahead of them to-“ Castiel stops himself. He can’t finish his sentence. If he does, he knows Dean will understand, and he won’t leave him, and Dean needs to leave him. Castiel sees how his expression is all disappointment and anger and he can’t help himself. The words leak from his mouth. “To keep them away from you.” And just like that, everything is ruined. All those months of work gone, all because he's too weak to let Dean be disappointed in him. “That’s why I ran.”
“Yeah – she’s gonna’ be a bruiser,” Dean says, a far-away look on his face, a small smile on his lips. Castiel watches as he takes one last look at the photo before he returns it to his pocket. He could have sworn that Dean was shining in that moment – he already loved his niece so much, already so unconditionally proud of her and they hadn’t even met. Castiel thought she might be the luckiest girl in the world.
“Thank you for saving him.”
i just want to say something directly to readers of this fic now. first of all, thank you so much for making it this far into the fic and actually finishing it. wtf that means so much. i hope it was worth it.
Castiel grew flowers too. When he and Dean had moved in, the patch of dirt at the end of the garden looked more like a freshly-dug grave than a flowerbed. Castiel, knowing that Dean had seen far too many of those in his lifetime, was determined to change that. In just a few days, he’d made it home to sunflowers, which Jack was particularly fond of, and gerberas, their pink and orange and yellow faces bright against the dark earth, and his personal favourite, French lavender, which had tripled in size since he’d planted it. Its scent, fresh and soapy, filled the garden, and it’s purple, cylindrical blooms were always busy with honeybees from the hive that lived just beside it.
“You couldn’t save me, Dean,” the entity in Jo’s shape says. She holds her hand out and makes a fist, and all the air leaves Dean’s lungs.
Castiel does what he’s told. Inside, there’s a silver ring.
It’s not long before the dread hits, and for the first time in his life Castiel feels sick to his stomach.
Castiel felt his expression soften, and there was a warm ache in his chest again. Dean had remembered after all.
“What?”
Sam sighs, “yeah, same here.”
“Can you walk?” Dean asks, and after a moment Cas nods. Dean loops an arm under his, heaving him up onto his heavy, swaying legs, looking behind him as he does. To his surprise there is no incoming threat. No invading darkness. Nothing chasing them. Regardless, something tells him to move, and holding Cas tighter, he rushes back towards the Bunker’s fluorescent lights.
Castiel realises that he wouldn’t have to stop himself hoping anymore.
Dean leans down so that their faces are inches apart. “This isn’t my first rodeo, Cas. I think I can handle a little cold.” He places a kiss on Castiel’s forehead and brushes his cheek with his thumb. “Besides, I never get sick.”
“Nothing. We’re free.”
“Come on, man, you’ve gotta’ say yes you’re killing me h-”
He stood up, and as he walked up the path, through the door and into the kitchen, Castiel could hear the faint tones of a soft and soothing saxophone and the twinkling of piano keys, something he vaguely recognised from days spent researching in the bunker all those years before. When he entered the living room, he found the source of the sound – a vinyl spun on Dean’s turntable, the smooth crooning of Ella Fitzgerald, slow and steady, trickling through the house. Dean was standing at the window, watching as Sam strapped Freya in her car seat and sat behind the steering wheel. Castiel met Dean there, placing a hand on the small of his back, and they both waved as the car pulled away. Dean leans his head onto Castiel’s shoulder and sighs. No matter how long they’d spent together, or how soon they’d be reunited, Dean always lost some of his glow when they left. Dean lived for his family, and it was almost as if a part of him went with them whenever they were gone.
“Let’s go see what Dean wants,” he says, brushing his legs as he stands and lifting Freya into his arms. Halfway up the path, Dean meets them and grabs Castiel’s shoulder, pushing him towards a seat at the table. Castiel places Freya on his knee as he sits, fixing her crown when it falls to one side.
“But it’s over. You’re free.”
The phone keeps vibrating. He better answer it. It could be Cas.
“You sure you’re okay? You’ve been…quiet…since we found you.”
“And Jack?”
Castiel feels the leviathans closing in and tries to think of his next move. Over and over, two words repeat in his head:
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, well you’re not my first patient.”
“If you think it’s cherry pie, then yes.”
Castiel feels his cheeks rise, tugging the corners of his lips into a small smile.
Opening the front door, something stops him from stepping through.
“However you have yours is fine.”
Unfortunately, Castiel needs him, and he’d already spent too much time in one place, so instead he says, “There’s a way if you’re human. God made it so. So-“
Reaching for his phone, the luminous display is painfully bright against his eyes, still wet, and he has to squint to read who it is.
“Me!” Jack declares, standing up so fast he almost trips. Dean lifts her down, and passes her to him. He does a little wave, and heads over to Sam at the barbeque, patting Jack’s shoulder as he passes.
Then the entity switches again. Now he’s facing Charlie.
What he’d give to be with Dean on that sunny afternoon. If he belonged there, that’s where he’d be.
It had been half an hour, and he’d gotten so lost in pruning and watering and saying “hello” to the bees that he’d almost forgotten it was still baking. He headed inside, hit with the sweet scent of butter and sugar, and peered through the glass of the oven door. The cherry filling bubbled up between the gaps in the pale gold pastry. It looked delicious, even to him, and he wondered if he’d become human enough to taste it as Dean would.
Castiel can’t look him in the eye. “I know.”
Without a pause, there’s Benny’s bitter voice, “Sounds like a plan. Let’s roll.”
For the first time since talking to the vampire, Castiel looks away.
After a few rings, Sam picks up.
Heaven, almost all of humanity, and a good man, wiped out because of the stupidity of one arrogant, fallen angel.
Cas doesn’t stir.
The vampire fully laughs now and Castiel feels like his skin is searing. When he sees the expression on Castiel’s face, the vampire realises he is being serious and says, “Well I’m sorry to break it to you. We’re stuck here forever, pal. Ain’t no way to leave.”
He hears Cas take a sharp breath.
Alone on the road, barely five minutes from the Bunker, Dean stops in centre. He doesn’t make it to the bar.
“Oh, look! His heart’s grown three times bigger!” Dean jokes, overexaggerating the shock on his face.
“Cas?”
Throwing the bag over his shoulder, Dean rushes to the nearest cupboard, his hard boots crashing to the floor as he does. “We must have some here somewhere,” he says, almost as if speaking it out loud would make it true. He pulls open draw after draw, leaves cupboard doors open, swinging at their hinges.
Castiel looks away again.
“No, no, that’s not just cherry pie, Cas – that’s
Using both hands, his fingers stained a dark pink, he scooped the now pitted and halved cherries, into a worn ceramic pot, and placed it on the stove. He poured in the sugar and watched it pile into a small white peak, crunching against the wooden spoon as he stirred. Whilst the fruit simmered, he worked on the pastry. He’d just scraped it from the bowl and dropped it onto the counter, throwing flour all over himself as he did, when the sweet smell of the cherries caught his attention again, and he turned back to the pot. Now bubbling and jammy, Castiel removed them from the heat and returned to the dough.
“Hi, Kelly,” he started, “it’s Castiel. It was a nice day today. Sam, Dean, Eileen, and Jack organised me a surprise birthday. I cried,” he shook his head and laughed under his breath, “it was very embarrassing. I wish you could’ve been here to see it though. It’s been so long, but Jack and I- we still miss you.”
Spring in Kansas. A little house in the middle of nowhere. Nothing fancy; a fixer-upper, just like him. Cas would’ve liked it here.
Placing the picture on the side, Dean goes back to the box and is met with a jacket. Dean frowns, and it’s only when he unfolds it that he realises what it is now. It’s the jacket he wore the day he lost Cas.
Engrossed in his book, all Dean says is, “Researching.”
Castiel sighs and rolls his eyes again. He knew Dean would call him that if he wore this sweater. It’s a nickname that’d stuck since he first bought it last winter, and at first it took him a while to understand why Dean was always asking him if it was a beautiful day in the neighbourhood anytime he wore it. He doesn’t care about how he looks right now though; this sweater is the only thing that’s keeping in any semblance of heat.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, “I’ll head back now.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
“Dean, you don’t have to-“
Dean turns his attention to the fireplace, and noticing that the fire has died, he bends down and stokes it until the flames crackle back to life. Castiel sighs in relief as he inches closer, and Dean sits on the floor next to him. They stay like that for a while, Castiel huddling close to Dean, watching the embers as they hiss and sputter, and finally, when Castiel begins to warm up, he breaks the easy silence.
His tomatoes sat just beside them, little orange globes dotting the vines, not quite ripe enough to pick. Castiel hadn’t known what to do with the first bunch that’d grown a few weeks before – Dean was still as adverse to fruits and vegetables as he’d always been, and despite Castiel’s best efforts, it was starting to rub off on Jack. Castiel worried that they’d rot before he had a chance to use them until, one evening, Sam saw them hanging bright red and shiny, and practically begged Castiel to take some home with him. Pleased that they wouldn’t go to waste, he agreed, and after there was unspoken arrangement that every week, when he and Eileen came for dinner, Sam could pick as many of them, and anything else Castiel grew, as he wanted.
“Dean I…I don’t follow.”
He needs music. He just needs noise. Anything to keep his mind quiet until he can drown it in whiskey.
“Yes, Sam.”
He wishes things were different. He wishes Dean Winchester had never been cursed with the likes of him.
Dean drops his bag where he stands. Sam flinches at the sound.
Castiel wants to say that the whole point of it was to disguise himself – to make sure this never happened, and that Dean never saw him again – but there’s that lingering feeling of Dean’s touch, so gentle and soft that Castiel has to look away for a moment, and all he can manage is “Thank you.”
Jade against the clear blue sky, the leaves of his cherry tree swaying in the gentle breeze caught his eye. Dean had bought it for him the previous Christmas, and Castiel thought back to the moment he’d announced the name of the variety, a Compact Stella, casual and confident, like he hadn’t spent the majority of his life trapped in pokey motel rooms, starved of any and all greenery. Castiel only had to look at a plant to know what kind it was, but humans weren’t quite as privy, and he was certain that Dean Winchester had never taken an interest in the various varieties of fruit before that day. Castiel remembered how he couldn’t stop his expression from exposing his disbelief, as much as he tried.
- kate <3
He stands there and watches as Dean passes through the edge of the trees. His eyes dropped up and down, almost to check if Castiel is real. Castiel doesn’t feel real. If it wasn’t for the fact that Dean is barely recognisable, Castiel might have thought his eyes were still closed, and he is still daydreaming.
Heaven. Earth. Bobby. All the reasons he doesn’t deserve a home. “Dean, I can’t.”
“Damn it’s good to see you,” Dean says, and then he moves his hand from Castiel’s shoulder to his face, and strokes a finger on his cheek. “Nice peach fuzz.”
“I’m so glad he chose me. It’s been such a privilege to raise him, Kelly – a gift. I may not be Jack’s biological father, but he is my son. Sam, Eileen, Dean, and I – we all love him like he’s our own. I- I hope all of us are able to fill the void that was left when you passed. I hope we’re raising him to be the man you knew he could be.” He stays there like that for a minute before he adds, “I think he’ll be better than we could have ever dreamed,” and brushes his hand over the memorial stone. “I hope you’re okay up there, Kelly.”
He tries to give Sam an apologetic, reassuring smile, but guilt is taking hold of him, climbing up his throat now, and he has to turn away soon after.
The last of the evening light filters through the window, and with Dean’s fingers gently combing through his hair, Castiel drifts off to sleep. The crackles of the turning vinyl blend with the sizzles of the fire, a hushed percussion that marries the music, now nothing but a distant echo. Castiel’s bones still ache, but unlike the night before, he’s not disturbed by a scratch in his throat, or a blocked nose that makes it hard to breathe. Tonight, safe and wrapped up in Dean’s arms on this tiny old sofa, he finds slumber easy.
Sam’s expression is washed of all concern, disbelief taking over. “You mean retire?” he asks.
[PRAYER 205]
“Here we go,” Dean says, holding a steaming bowl out to Castiel, who, even under a thick blanket, is still shivering. “Dean’s famous chicken noodle soup.”
“Benny, keep an eye on him while I’m gone.” Dean keeps his gaze fixed on Castiel until he’s finished speaking, and then for a moment longer, before he moves it to the vampire. The vampire nods, and Dean turns away,  heading for the trees. Before he gets too far he lets out an, “Oh,” and turns back, giving them both a warning look, “and don’t kill each other. You got it?”
Finally. Dean is going home. Castiel lets the relief wash over him.
Jack starts to chase Freya around the garden, and her giggles and squeaks instantly put a smile on Castiel’s face. He feels Dean loop an arm over his shoulder and looks up. Dean is watching the two of them as they run, his lips pulling into a private smile.
“This is so stupid,” he mutters to himself, “it’s just a room.”
“Who the Hel-“
“Sam and Eileen might have trouble getting her back,” Castiel comments, and sees Dean smile wider.
“No. No, Chuck’s not a problem anymore.”
“It’s okay, I’m here,” Dean says, moving in closer to inspect how bad a state Cas is in.
Sam pauses, and there’s shuffling sounds in the background. “We’ll be right there.”
He splashes his face with the water, and as he looks out over the stream he realises that he’d never felt as tired as he does in that moment. His bones ache, his eyes stung, and he wasn’t sure if he could even muster the energy to stand up again. It's an uncomfortable feeling – one he isn’t used to.
Dean laughs, genuine and warm, and more musical than the song still playing behind them. “I-, I guess you did.” Meeting Castiel’s eyes, he says, his voice hushed, “I think you’re the only person who ever could,” and then he takes the ring out from its groove in the velvet and snaps the box shut, throwing it to one side. He takes Castiel’s hand, slides the silver band onto his finger and once it’s in its new home, he brings Castiel’s hand to his lips and places a chaste kiss there.
Dean feels a smile bloom on his face, and he can’t tell if his cheeks feel warm because of the heat or because he’s blushing. When he replies, he tries to keep his voice as cool as he can. “I guess we’re gonna’ have to get married then.”
He tries to speak. His vocal cords don’t work, scratched raw, and he can’t find his voice, no matter how much he tries. The deafening, suffocating sound of the empty creeps in, invading his home and coming to take Cas again.
Trying to think of a way to distract him, Castiel decided to ask him something that had been on his mind all day.
The paper is creased where Dean had obviously struggled to wrap it, and where the two edges met of it in the centre there is a mountain of tape so thick that Castiel thinks he’ll never get be able to infiltrate it. After a while though, with Dean’s impatient eyes trained on him the whole time, he manages to make a tear and rip off the wrapping.
Eileen beams, also giving Cas a hug. “We’re so glad you’re back.”
It seems as though Dean still hasn’t made the connection between Bobby’s death and Castiel’s failings. As much as Castiel thinks he should, he’s glad of it. He knows he’s weak, but he can’t help but cling to that last shred of faith Dean has in him. He’d hold on to it for as long as he could because soon it would be gone, and then Castiel would be nothing more than Dean Winchester’s biggest regret. Because then he would be nothing.
“Dean Winchester. Should’ve known you’d come snooping around here eventually.”
But Cas could get the chance he deserves. They both could, and surely any consequences must be worth that?
When he sees what’s underneath it, Castiel is speechless.
needs to leave here, and you need to help him do it.”
He said he liked this one.
Silence. Dean and the person he’s been aching for, united once more. Cas leans against the chair in the centre of the room and Dean stands in front of him, checking over every inch. Sullen, sallow skin, sunken eyes, matted, messy hair, the past few months have clearly not been kind to him, and that fact makes Dean’s insides twist up. Forget the Empty, that feeling alone could choke the air out of the lungs and bring him to his knees if he let it. Everything in him wants to kiss colour back into those cheeks, to sweep away the marks of his restless sleep with the gentle brush of his thumb, to comb his fingers through each tuft of hair and ease them back home, and the feeling leaves him paralysed.
[END OF CHAPTER THREE]
“I think the Queen wants her cake now,” she jokes.
Is it really that obvious?
“So, for my birthday I finally got you to commit,” Castiel joked, knowing full well that it was the best gift Dean could have given him, but trying to calm Dean down.
If he does this this again, it’s going to destroy him.
“To Cas,” Sam repeats, a small smile, equal parts melancholy and proud, forming. There’s the clink of the brothers’ bottles where they meet that rings through the bunker, and, tipping his bottle up and draining its contents, Dean tries not to notice how that sound echoes without Cas there.
They drink in contemplative silence for a moment, Chuck’s words still ringing in Dean’s ears, and though he feels pathetic, doubt gets the better of him. “Do you think he knew? How much I-,” he stops himself and rephrases, “how much we cared about him?”
There was a smell of smoke as Sam tended to the barbeque, the sizzle and hiss of the coal blending with the distant hum of a lawnmower. The sun beams down on Castiel, his skin warm and tingly under its glow, and he feels a bead of condensation run down his fingers from the neck of the beer bottle where he holds it. His mouth is dry. He brings the bottle to his lips and lets the sweet, fizzy liquid bathe his tongue, cool and refreshing in the heat.
“Just open it.”
Castiel can’t help but defend himself. He needs Dean to understand, even though he knows he shouldn’t. “I am an angel in the land of abominations. There have been things hunting me from the moment we arrived.”
As unfunny as the joke was, it grounded Castiel and he was grateful for it. Not wanting to encourage him however, he sighed and tried to sound as unimpressed as he could. “No, Dean.”
Now he’s truly free.
There’s a warmth to Dean’s words, honied by the nostalgia of a life before hunting, and as Castiel listens, his eyelids become heavy. All at once those lost hours of sleep catch up with him, and wrapped up and toasty as he is, head practically resting on Dean’s shoulder, it’s all he can do to not fall asleep huddled in front of the fireplace.
“What about Cas?”
Castiel nods. He’s so much better than okay.
Castiel was just checking the size of the chain against the top of Freya’s head when he heard Dean call to him from the table. Tying the loose end around the first daisy’s stem, he made the chain into a loop and crowned her with it, the flowers dazzlingly white against her long dark curls.
Hearing the tone of Castiel’s voice, Dean chuckled. “Okay, Martha Stewart, what did you bake me then?” Castiel didn’t know who Martha Stewart was, but before he could ask, he heard Dean approach, and then there was a hand on the small of his back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dean’s smug expression change into something he could only describe as childlike wonder, his eyes wide and gleaming.
had pie like this. You’re a natural.”
If he weren’t in love with Dean, Castiel would definitely find how he always seems to be right very annoying.
Now Castiel wants to hit Dean too. Of course he isn’t feeling okay. He’d spent the last few months a walking target in the land of ancient monsters, away from the only person he had left, the only place ever worth calling home, and he’d done it all to keep that person safe. Now that same person, the most stubborn idiot Castiel has ever known, is right there in front of him, risking his life again and making Castiel’s work practically worthless. To be honest, Castiel had never felt less okay.
He should’ve asked Jack to bring him back when he had the chance. He wanted to. He was halfway there, but he knows Jack would have brought him back if he could. He brought Eileen back, Sam didn’t even have to ask. Besides, bringing him back from the empty would definitely have consequences. Dean’s had enough of consequences.
Knocking down walls, plastering others, treating wood, patching up the holes, filling in the cracks, Dean rips the rotten parts of the house out and starts building it up from those foundations.
“You bailed out, and what? Went camping? I prayed to you, Cas. Every night.”
Before he gets back to work, Dean looks at Cas, taking in how the fading sun behind him frames his jaw, how the blue of his eyes, echoes of the sky that day, gleam in the light. Placing the beer on the table as he stands, he leans across the table to where Cas sits, placing his lips on his forehead and kissing him softly, and like the birds above, everything in him sings.
“The empty?” Sam stands opposite Dean; his voice is wary.
Castiel hasn’t heard a prayer in fifty-nine days.
“I’m looking up too, Dean,” Castiel whispers.
The answer could be out there, but it could take him months. It could take him years. It could consume him, steal whatever’s left of his life away. It could take the little he has left to offer the world and leave him with nothing. He watched it happen to his Dad. That’s a path so clear cut, he knows exactly where it leads, and he refuses to follow in his footsteps. He refuses to make the same mistakes. Besides, Cas said he was more than that.
“So, what, do you have a nineteen-fifties housewife kink or something?”
doesn’t cut it, and Dean knows it’s not enough. He knows what he really needs to say, and more than any ghost, any demon, any seemingly hopeless, unconquerable apocalypse he’s faced, it terrifies him to his very bones, because if he says the words out loud it makes them real. It makes Cas loving him, despite every turn of his knife in the pits of Hell, every kill in cold-blood under ancient curses, every sharpened, poisoned word thrown his way, real. It means that they could both have something they’ve wanted for so long, and, to Dean, nothing feels more world-ending than that.
He has to live his life now. For Miracle. For Sam. For Cas. For himself.
“It’s too dangerous.”
Dean is pushed to the floor; all air knocked from his lungs. He tries and tries to say something. He needs Cas know.
“Dean? Where the hell are you? It’s been hours.”
[END OF CHAPTER FOUR]
The vampire’s lips curve up, exposing his teeth. He chuckles. “Oh, I do, do I?”
Dean raises his bottle too. His voice low, he adds “and to Cas, whose sacrifice saved the world and made this – our freedom – possible.”
“Cas. We got him back, Sammy.”
Written as the faithless man and the broken angel, they were fated to follow their own set paths, destined to go their separate ways. In choosing one another, over and over, they escaped the pages of Chuck’s storybook, and with every gentle touch, every kiss, every hushed “I love you”, they write their own ending.
“Uncle Dean,” Isla calls from where she stands across the beach, “teach me how to do that cool stone trick!”
Dean tries not to let Chuck’s words stick. He tries so hard to forget them as soon as they’re spoken, but every one of them hits exactly where Chuck wants them to. They’re reinforcing everything Dean has been thinking since that night.
“I know you do, Sammy. I know you do.”
Castiel tilts his head up and his eyes meet the darkness. Dean’s right, and Castiel doesn’t know how he hasn’t noticed before. The sky is vacant of stars, and there’s no moon to drape the top of the trees in a pale silver light, but somehow it doesn’t feel empty like Dean had said. Just knowing that they’re both looking at that same stretch of nothing means that Castiel can’t feel alone – like the sky itself is the deep, endless pupils of Dean’s eyes; the ones that Castiel had always found himself lost in whenever he held his gaze just a little too long. Like Dean is right there, looking back at him. Lost in Dean’s eyes had always been where he felt most at home.
He hears “Dean,“ spills out of his mouth. Dean’s found him. Dean is here.
Is this how Dean feels? If so, Castiel would have to add it to the list of things about Dean Winchester than left him in awe.
Dean looks at him, something soft in his expression. “Okay, move over a little. I better keep an eye on your temperature. We don’t want your comebacks to get any worse.”
Turning back to Dean, Cas straightens up in his chair and gives him his full attention. Dean starts off signing the new words they’d been going over for the past couple of days. The days of the week, hello, goodbye, Miracle, beer, happy, garden, smile. He feels a little clumsy still, and sometimes he stumbles a bit, but Dean can’t help but smile when Cas only has to correct him a couple of times. His practice is paying off.
He turns his head from the pillow slightly, opening one eye a little. Vision still hazy, he comes to find Dean standing over him, an unfocused smile as wide as Castiel has ever seen it.
“Dean you just said you did-“
This is the first time he and the vampire have been alone together, and the Purgatory air felt particularly thick in that moment.
How his heart burns for it. How his stolen bones ache to be in the home of the man he loves, warmed by the glow of a million Christmas lights. Then he remembers why he’s here in the first place, and why he never gets to leave. With a twist of guilt, the tide of shame comes flooding in, and he tries not to think about how he’ll never see Dean’s eyes outshine the green of a Christmas tree, or how he’ll never be lit by his beaming smile from across the dinner table. He tries not to think of Dean, here of all places, alone on another Christmas morning, his only friend the reason he’s trapped here in the first place. He tries to forget how Dean’s voice faltered whenever he said Castiel’s name, and how he could hear the wistful smile as he talked of a future he might never have. He tries to push down the thought that he could’ve had it all if he’d listened to Dean in the first place, and if his arrogance hadn’t blinded him. If he’d just kept that door to this place shut. If he’d just done as Dean said.
While Sam sleeps, Dean gets through all the books at the table, and he has to go to the storage room to get more. Usually Sam would offer. He practically jumps up from his seat whenever they’ve needed something from down there since Cas was taken, and although he hasn’t said, Dean’s grateful, because he doesn’t want to be back down in that room if he can help it.
“Exactly, Cas. The world is saved, the fight is over, and I still need you.” Desperate and broken, Dean’s voice exposes exactly how he’s feeling, and for once he doesn’t care. He hopes Cas can hear every crack, every break, every shaky, shallow breath. He hopes Cas can hear that he’s the reason his barely-mended heart keeps beating. “Don’t you get it? I never wanted you to leave.”
“I ran away.”
Kneeling by his side, the first thing Dean does is place a hand under Cas’s heavy head.
The twelve year secret escapes his lips, the very last of his burdens lifted. He’s finally said it, and now it feels like he’ll never stop.
“I like those too,” is all he says. Freya can learn about Kelly another day.
Not too long after, they’re pulling into the driveway, and Sam and Eileen are already there, jumping out of their car and rushing over to greet them.
Dean called to him again, “Cas? Cas come on; I want to show you something.”
Dean’s already grabbing his bag. “Whatever it is Sam, I’m sure we’ve got it.”
“No, Cas. No way.” Dean’s eyes are serious, his brow furrowed and his jaw tight. Castiel knows that look well. It’s the same one he gives to Sam when he’s being particularly self-sacrificial.
“He never got to be a kid. I always said I’d never raise one into the life, but I did.”
The cool air hits his face, and letting it slam shut behind him, Dean leans back against the door, breathless. He feels like he’s swallowed cement, his lungs filled with it, and he has to focus on each breath to keep them working.
“Have a nice life, Chuck,” Dean says, setting his jaw and forcing a smile, trying to feign apathy. When he turns back he closes his eyes for a second, and is met with Sam and Jack’s own sympathetic ones when he opens them again. Remembering where he is and the job he has to do, he fixes his expression, frown on, eyes cold and distant, and makes his way to the Impala’s driver seat. Jack and Sam follow.
“Cas?”
Salt. He needs salt.
“Dean what are you saying?”
“No need to thank me. I did it for Dean. He’s my ticket out of here after all.”
Then there’s Benny, a person so familiar yet, eyes cold, nothing behind them, he’s a stranger.
Dean closes his tired eyes and by the fourth verse, the song is distant and fuzzy.
Before Dean even registers that he’s there, he’s pulling up outside of the bunker and stumbling down the stairs. He tries to get the key in the door, but he can’t steady his hand enough. Muttering curses under his breath and telling himself to hurry, he cups his shaking hand with the other, gets the key into the lock and turns it, pushing open the reinforced door.
“It would seem so,” Cas says, looking back at Dean, that small smile growing twofold.
He lets go of Dean’s hand, and watches him disappear in the blue light.
Mr and Mr Winchester. Castiel liked how that sounded.
It’s not fair. Why, even now, is life not fair? Why is it working against him still?
Forever with someone he thought he’d lost for good. It almost seems too good to be true, and sometimes Dean gets so worried that it’s all being written again. Late at night, he can get so fixated on the idea that there’s a piece of Chuck that transferred to Jack, and it’s corrupting him. Maybe it’s taking over. Maybe nothing is real. Maybe they’ve never really been free. When he falls into that hole, though, he tries to remember that Cas is real, that he’s always been real, and while it doesn’t fix everything, it helps.
Dean lifts his head. “Hmmm?”
“What is it?”
“N-no, I’ll be f-fine,” Castiel manages, feeling like he’s already bothered Dean enough with this. It’s just a cold, he tells himself. Humans get those all the time. “I just need to warm up a little.”
“There’s a new scan of the bump. I got Sam to make me a copy,” he says. He gives it a quick glance, before holding it out for Castiel to see, leaving the spoon, licked clean to within an inch of its life, on the side and picking up his beer again.
Of course, it’s not perfect. Even with Cas back, Dean still has sleepless nights, still haunted by those dreams and the faces of the people he couldn’t save. That anger and frustration still burn within him, but a gentle hand across the dinner table, and a reassuring look, is all he needs to know Cas understands.
The words ring in his ears. Castiel moves his hands through the water again and again, but it’s useless. He knows this blood could never be washed clean. He is a monster, and if he’d learned anything from Dean, it was that monsters need to be hunted. Here, he’d be hunted by leviathans until the end of time. Castiel knows there is no better place for him.
“Good. Merry Christmas.”
Castiel is silent. He’s sure he can sense something in the far corner, behind that tree.
Castiel looks at him and squints his eyes. He didn’t understand why the slice mattered – it all came from the same cake, so why would one slice taste different to another?
“Dean I-“
Castiel’s stomach lurches, and he finds it hard not to look away. He doesn’t understand the blind faith Dean has in him. He doesn’t understand why Dean had prayed every night, and he doesn’t understand why Dean cares, and he doesn’t understand why Dean always tries to see the good in him, when Castiel knows there is no good in him left to find. “No.” He says it so quietly that he almost doesn’t hear himself.
Dean remembers when he first gave it to him, Cas with his little head tilt, squinted eyes, the most secret of smiles. On their next drive together, Dean said he could play it, and he told him all about the band and where he first heard each song, and why each one is in his top thirteen, and Cas never told him he was boring, or that it was stupid to get this passionate about music. He sat in the passenger seat, a little crease in his brow, seeming to focus on the lyrics and trying to make sense of them.
Castiel smiles, and manages to make an opening with his fingernail. “Thank you.” From the pile Freya had made on his knee, he plucks a daisy and pushes it through the gap.
This is it. This is his shot. Castiel knew it isn’t polite to do what he is about to, but he doesn’t have time to care. The leviathans would find him again soon. They couldn’t have been far behind him. This is his only shot, and he needs to take it now.
There’s a pause, and upon hearing Dean’s voice Sam’s tone changes. “Dean? Are you okay, man?”
Freya was staring up at Dean, “What’s a hand so-lo?”
Castiel knows that he should be leaving. Dean might have seen him, but it isn’t too late. All he has to do is think of somewhere else, and Dean would be back to the beginning. Maybe he’d give up if he saw Castiel leave him again.
Just like that, Castiel knew what he had to do.
There was a pull in Castiel’s chest, and his breath hitched. He had a birthday. A day dedicated to him, given to him by those he loved most. His lungs refused to work. He thought he knew that they loved him before, but it was only at that moment that he truly believed it, and it hit him like a tonne of bricks. Sam and Dean Winchester loved him back.
“Sleep well, Dean,” Castiel’s voice was hushed and low, and he combed his fingers through Dean’s hair, moving it from out of his face. Brushing a thumb over the spot where his lips had been moments before, Castiel prayed that Dean would only have good dreams. He didn’t pray much anymore, but it was the least he could do. Castiel didn’t need to sleep to have good dreams; Dean had made his life the sweetest dream of all.
Dean wraps his arms around him, and pulls him in tight. This is definitely real. Dean slaps just above his shoulder blade. Castiel doesn’t let himself hug back.
“Join the club!”
Guilt lays heavy on Dean’s shoulders, and he leans forward, trying to be as honest as he’ll let himself. “Look, I know it’s selfish. I know I gave you crap about doing the same thing before. I know. Man, every time I think about it, it feels like I’m giving up – like I’m taking the easy way out. But you know better than anyone what obsessing over something, or someone, can do. You saw what it did to Dad. I can’t go down that same road, Sammy. I won’t.”
Castiel always forgets how stubborn Dean can be. Usually he’d put up more of a fight, but today he’s too weak, and far too tired, so, reluctantly, he moves his hands out from the shelter of the blanket and reaches for the bowl. He doesn’t have much of an appetite, but Dean did make this especially for him, and he probably should eat something anyway.
“It’s a long story. We’re heading back to mine if you want to see him.”
“Yeah, Sam. I’m good.” He can hardly keep the smile from his voice. “We got Cas back.”
Dean does know. He tries not to think about it.
The truth is, Castiel doesn’t know any different. He remembers seeing how Dean felt when he was asleep. He’d passed out at Bobby’s after a hunt, and it was one of the few times Castiel had seen him at peace, unburdened by that crushing guilt and pain he always carried with him. Even though he knows it’s still there, Castiel is glad he doesn’t have to see it anymore.
