“But, even after all that, I think I learned that that feeling, that terrifying feeling, is actually the most beautiful feeling.” He turns his head to look at Dean, who’s already looking at him. He smiles fondly.
“Dean, there was no way for you or Sam to get Cas out. No spell, no magic that I know of that would have let you guys get there and back without getting hurt.”
“And I know I don’t have to ask, because I know you’ll take care of him, Dean. But I think I’m starting to understand why people like Chuck interfered so much. I think they cared too much, too.”
“Yeah, it’s called, um, self-something. Self-insert?” Jack replies cheerfully, explaining as if it’s a completely normal thing. Though, to be fair, it very well could be. Dean’s no expert. “Basically, people write themselves into different worlds and like, imagine themselves in it.”
They had spent the week slowly packing up the bunker, Sam having moved out with Eileen a few months prior. It was an inevitability that they would leave this place, but Dean and Castiel still had things to, well,
“He said he was okay with it, but I think he sacrificed it. I thought that after I took over, there wouldn’t be any more resistance, but it appears there are still some, um, ‘loopholes’ to work around,” Jack says, punctuating with finger quotes.
Jack gives Dean his best scowl before softening his expression. “No, he’s not boring,” he says defiantly. He ponders for a moment, and Dean takes another sip of coffee as he waits for Jack to continue his thought.
“I’m leaving Cas here, Dean. That was a really hard choice for me to make, because I can’t do anything to take care of him now.” Dean nods, and he feels his breathing steady with Jack by his side.
It’s a very slow start after Jack pulls him out of the Empty. He sleeps for what feels like weeks, exhausted by the extraction of his grace and the journey back to Earth. He doesn’t want his son to leave, but he knows he’s done too much already, and so he lets him go. He knew it was going to be this way, after all, but he didn’t anticipate goodbye being so tumultuous. In a way, Castiel was happy that he would be gone before Jack had to go, and it’s a selfish, terrible thing to find solace in, but one makes do in the Empty.
He talks about beauty, and how much more intense the aesthetics of the universe are as a human. He talks about how everything is so different, all the things he loves are so different. The word hits Dean and Castiel sees him recoil slightly. A word used in a different context, but still the same word, the same sounds, the same configuration of letters.
He pauses to take a deep breath.
before they could make a big life change. Jack is back with them, and that actually became the big deciding factor to finally close up the bunker chapter of their lives.
“Dude, I watch Dr. Sexy and we all watch Riverdale. Sam eats like an iguana. Everyone in this place is silly,” Dean laughs, trying to lighten the mood, and judging by the way Jack’s shoulders relax, it works. Jack brushes his hair off his forehead – they would have to trim it again soon, Jack having an aversion to longer hair bothering his ears and the back of his neck – and turns his attention back to his screen.
He is Castiel.
he thinks, which would be an eventual next step), but it’s about more than that. Dean nods, but he mutters something under his breath that Castiel doesn’t quite catch. As sensitive as his, well, senses are, they fail him in many ways too.
way too frequently when it comes to new arrivals and visitors; there are so many hunters, and some of them Dean worked with on some case back when he was nineteen and nearly got his stupid ass killed by a fire-breathing bird on a rampage or what have you, only way more depressing.
“Bullshit,” Dean croaks out, finding that now he can thankfully move, even if all he’s got the energy left to do is roll over to one side to face his strange savior. Dude’s too far away to see, though, and as his Staraptor flies toward him her form gets hazy too.
Part of him likes Cas’ newfound sense of humor, the grins like everything is some private joke, the light in his eyes when he babbles on about the lessons he’s learned from observing the flight patterns of moths. Part of him is terrified. It’d be easier to deal with if it wasn’t just them.
“I have no need for it as an angel,” Cas grouches out. Whether he actually slept or not, his voice sure sounds like it, all gravel. “But it’s still enjoyable.”
“He is kind of a jackass,” Benny finally says, the next day. Dean’s been complaining to him for the better part of a week, now; Benny’s accent always makes his voice sound tired, but right now he just sounds
They pull up in front of a 24-hour convenience store. “Just, uh, sit tight, okay?” Dean tells him, and Emmanuel means to. He’s bizarrely good at following orders; people have told him
got saved, I still care.”
Meg snorts right back at him. “Dean, I know you were having a good time making the next great homoerotic buddy comedy over in some other dimension —”
Victor reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a blank envelope. It’s scuffed and doesn’t look new, the middle of it bulging out. “We’ve had this sitting around the station for a while. Supposed to be for the next-of-kin. That’s you and your brother. Sam, I believe?”
“Sammy, Espeon’s doing great!” Dean yells, hoping he can hear him. There’s no sign of Sam, but there’s no real sign of any human other than silhouettes against the swirling dust. Dean tries not to be nervous over that.

“Someone who stays in ignorance is an asshole. That’s not you.”
, asked him when he showed up to research where to move. They didn’t exactly have travel guides lying around at home.
Scintillating goddamn conversation.
to make up for what they did
“You guys turned out alright,” Dean says, smiling.
Mary didn’t have to. Castiel saw her battle. He saw her kill.
Dean wills himself to calm down, and after he makes the bed with Cas – it feels so
“Definitely not.” Cas’ poker face has taken full effect, but the mirth makes his eyes fuckin’ sparkle.
“Likely no,” Cas admits, “but I think we’ve always done best when we ignore the rules.” There’s an all too satisfied look on his face, even if he totally deserves it.
But she’s got those eyes that cut through the dark. Some would say they’re creepy; Dean’s heard it enough times, and when he was younger and woke up to her staring at him he sure as hell thought they were. Now, though, they just mean relief.
“Cas, please,” he asks the ink of the almost constant night here. He can’t even raise his voice to yell it; he’s
“I know,” Cas sighs. “It didn’t feel right, anyway. It’s the wrong energy for Latios.” His breath puffs out into the air, white like Reshiram itself. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
Castiel scrutinizes Dean’s face, eyes sweeping across him too obviously. Dean feels like he’s run one of Sammy’s goddamn marathons. “Cas saved Sam, too, when he went to Hell a couple of years later. Fat lot of good my deal did.”
A bunch of them crowd into a big SUV, of all things, and Sam dares to blast his stupid girly music like it’s as awesome as anything Dean would listen to. Tamara sits shotgun, and Dean is absolutely not sulking about crowding into the backseat with a skinny redhead in a black polo shirt and Castiel and Inais, who look absolutely miserable about stuffing themselves in a car, Inais with a big exaggerated frown and Cas totally bitchfacing.
to Dean. It hasn’t sunk into the hide of some bad guy, gotten itself soaked in blood.
He picks at the sides of the cage. He’s no genius, but he didn’t work as a civil engineer for nothing. Figuring shit like this out was kind of in the job description.
“We’re still your
“Well, at least you have practice,” Hannah says, extremely diplomatically. Dean gets the feeling they’ve served that role for most of their family. He can relate; most of the time, Sam and Dad got into awful screaming matches and he’d end up playing referee.
Cas is wearing panties. Not fancy ones, not at all, there’s a line of cheap lace at the hips but other than that they’re plain gray cotton. They’d be totally unremarkable if it wasn’t for the hot rise of Castiel’s erection inside them, barely held back in the cotton, and — fuck — the smear of wetness where the head of his dick is outlined, thick ridge and all.
so repulsively casually, but they’re so out of place in this placid world that he can’t help but feel like he dragged those wings here himself.
, he actually barks out a laugh.
There’s one thing Cas wants to make very clear before they return to sleep. Something he should have said already, the first thing he should have said once he received Castiel’s memories. He strokes his fingers through Dean’s hair; the contact settles him and puts jumpy anticipation in his stomach alike. “Before I died. You were the last thing I thought of –”
to interfere with any of this, but he will if it starts getting out of hand and all this verbal headbutting turns a bit more literal.
may have been an understatement. Cas looks like he might melt, and his eyes are hazy and laser-focused – on Dean, it’s a lot to take – all at once. Dean can remember the terrifying creature in the barn that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up; now he’s flat on his back, looking up at Dean and touching him. The effect is much the same, still.
Bobby was practically family in Village Bridge. But he was also an irascible asshole who had a strange soft spot for Dean and Sam. Growlithe spent most of her time napping and occasionally snapping at someone’s ankles, usually Bobby’s. Even when they all got older, not much changed about any of that.
fucking surreal.
Even her fashion sense was wildly different from her sister’s. She wore old-fashioned, stuffy dresses, in colors that matched her Seaking. The drawings from the courtroom are shocking, two identical faces with completely different vibes even in a mere illustration. If Abaddon wasn’t already going to land in jail for life, Josie’s testimony absolutely sealed her fate.
something, man.”
“One tricky bastard, Crowley,” Meg sighs. Dean wonders if she ever had these little pow-wows with her brother and dad. He kinda wants to throw up at the thought of it. “Dean, stop being a brat, you’re not helping.”
Cas shoots him a look that isn’t quite a glare, but is enough to make Dean stop talking. “But I’m back, and you’re here. I was shocked at how good it felt to hug you. Touch you.” A strawberry flush colors his cheekbones, even through the potent expression that remains on his face. “I’ve spent months in Heaven, or looking for God alone – apart from you, is my point. Imagine how I felt when I realized I just couldn’t do it any more.”
Dean’s only response to that is tipping Cas’ chin up and moving even closer until they’re full-on kissing, and Dean is awfully happy the Macy’s is almost empty because it’s wet and loud because Cas probably doesn’t know any better and Dean – well, Dean’s always been pretty loud.
The otherwise pristine white walls of the mall are marred by graffiti, most of it pretty disturbing. Lots of images of Pokemon with blood wiped red across their jaws, awful shit like that. Dean wouldn’t want Sam to see any of it.
Even considering those nights, Dean’s still never been as glad to see her as he is in this moment, when she flies into the room, screeching
“They kept asking for volunteers for some experiment. It was sketchy as hell, man. We think they were trying to take just about anyone from Carver who has a Psychic type. Something about superior brainpower they made up.” Dean barely knows Jake, but the idea of anyone trying to wrestle him into doing anything is absurd. Dude’s stink-eye could beat Cas’, and that’s saying something.
“How’d you – how did you get out of Roman’s control?” Dean starts.
(“Come and be one with the bees,” he’d told Dean, who was understandably distracted by all that fucking
A reasonable creature would tell Cas he had his fill of Dean last night. But Cas is long past the point where he was ever reasonable about Dean Winchester, and maybe he never was. He dips his fingers down, teasing his own stomach for a few seconds before he starts lazily pumping himself.
. “Together,” is all Dean says. “If you meant it, I do too.”
There are a couple of moments where Cas’ eyes move to look toward Dean. He holds Dean’s gaze for more than just a beat, then moves away, back to the Pokemon and Charlie. Dean doesn’t hate it, much as he feels like all his clothing is way too stuffy and itchy when he catches Cas glancing at him.
line, but he had to have this much. Cas’ mouth was rough and lush and inhumanly warm under his own, making Dean’s skin buzz where they touched. It’s like Cas hadn’t stuffed his screaming death ray angel self into Jimmy Novak’s body, but a subwoofer instead.
“When I think
“Hacking?”
Cobalion stares down Lilith. The Pokemon doesn’t look angry, only surprised. Azazel’s rushed to her side, but his Hypno’s gone too. Dean hopes she headed off in the same way Drifblim did.
“This bus is slow,” Cas sighs after a few minutes. On the best of days, the bus trudges through the streets, weighed down by Pokemon and trying not to go too fast in order not to tear up the wheels, and this ain’t one of the best days. The mascot of the Opelucid bus company is Aerodactyl, painted in fierce relief on the side of every bus. Dean knows the company chose Aerodactyl because they’re one of the fastest Pokemon out there in this or any era, but they inadvertently, and fittingly, chose a
She takes in the shack, with the forest and enormous blue-capped mountains across the lake. In the other world, the land was buzzed flat – at least, where it wasn’t a dangerous rocky cliff that would slash you into gory ribbons before you died from the fall. Trees were pathetic, twisted and bare things more like sticks stuck in the ground than trees. The only color she saw was in the sickly yellow spotlights the angels used.
Mary knows it’s the last night she can spend here, so she’s going to spend it around the campfire with the rest of the group. Campfires aren’t a great idea, not here, and every time they set one up she swears she sees the dark hulking figures in the distance move closer. But she needs the company.
He rushes off to help Lily. Her Starmie and a Cloyster are engaged in a vicious battle. Starmie whirls and whirls, going fast enough to slice into the Cloyster’s shell, but the Cloyster snaps back, trying to swallow the Starmie whole. Dean’s moving fast as he can, which explains why he practically trips over the girl in dark clothes crouched by where the wall of the cave meets the floor.
Then mom was gone, and the light clicked out.
“Oh, Dean. I’ve heard
, too, a reminder that Vaporeon are damn powerful as a species even if Dean mostly sees them as enormous goofballs who leave water stains everywhere and are frequently hopelessly wobbly on land.
That’s Cas, Dean thinks. Half the man who could hold him like this, and half a fierce warrior, a Pokemon-human hybrid with enough power to level the whole damn battlefield before them.
That’s when he recognizes the mouth on that thing. “Leviathan!”
The rest of their conversation flows normally, for hunters. Dean points out some of the more demonic omens from the book she’s reading, because even if Cas said Hell was sealed up, better safe than sorry; Mary catches him up on Linda Tran, who’s been taking out rakshasas across the East Coast. Seems kinda right that the two of them and Jody have a badass hunter mom club.
An enormous noise booms in the distance. Mary laughs again, a real one this time, and Bobby looks at her like he’s never heard the sound before. Probably hasn’t. It proves her point, anyway.

“What makes sense?” Dean fights the urge to grab him by the shoulders and

Cas growls from above.

Tessa just sighs. “Well, I’m fine. More thankful for that than the job. It’s
Victor’s eyebrows haven’t gone down any. “You guys got one messed-up situation going on,” he comes up with, eventually.
“I’m outie.” As much as Dean came to appreciate Meg popping into and out of camp — God, she was probably the person Dean had known the longest, outside of Sam, and isn’t that fucked-up — he knew this day was gonna come. Demons don’t exactly plan on taking joyride road trips with humans and angels and the few Leviathan Anna has on her side.

her hand.
“That Steelix?” he asks, weakly. It’s gonna be a long time before he gets the image of Steelix’s long blink, right before he blew himself the fuck up because his trainer commanded it, out of his head. The Steelix might’ve been Marv’s, but he didn’t ask for any of that.

Vaporeon comes bounding out of the water soon after. Like always, she doesn’t bother to shake the droplets off her, so she leaves a long dripping trail behind her. It’s just grass, Dean thinks. And it’s night. The trail isn’t going to be obvious; he’s good at never leaving an obvious trail behind him. Dad taught him that much.
“Yeah, um,” Dean gets out, after a bit. “Kinda figured that much.” He can’t meet Chuck’s eyes, and he still doesn’t wanna own up to it — all the shit Cas went through because of him — but it’s pointless to play totally dumb at this point.
with Dean for asking, is the thing that’s getting to him. It’s seeking him, finding him, telling him – “You are worth it,” Cas continues, tugging Dean’s hips closer to his own. They’re practically dick on dick now, and it’s sexy, because Dean’s only human, but more than that, it’s so good to be this fucking
Carefully, Dean lifts Vaporeon up, until she’s close enough to whisper to. He breathes in the scent of seawater, the salty air and spray on the beach. He’s come home again.
“Uh, sorry.” Sure, he says it, he doesn’t mean it, and he’s pretty sure Cas can tell. Tension sizzles behind his words. Dean’s really gone on Cas, but he still feels himself getting defensive over Vaporeon before just about anyone, and he knows she’s sometimes single-mindedly protective of him. That’s what happens when you go through unthinkable heaps of shit together for nearly twenty years.
“Thanks,” Dean says, his voice low and shaky. “Just – thank you.”
She leads Dean up the stairs at the front of the nursery, which has an enormous barn-like structure with many enclosures, to another office. This one, in contrast to Jody’s, is almost utterly sparse, the walls painted sky blue. A pretty woman with dark hair doesn’t look up from the computer when they walk in. Her desk has five phones placed across it, the only bit of mess in the office, their cords twisted together.
After the drive, the argument, and the frankly embarrassing if very needed emotional upheaval, Dean figures he’d be exhausted. And he feels it at first. His boots are heavy like someone stuffed ‘em full of cement, and he just tosses them across the room as opposed to neatly placing them against the side of his bed. He shucks his jeans and lies back in bed in his boxers, t-shirt, and flannel, not even caring about the way the buttons on the last one dig into his skin when he turns the wrong way.
Dean’s stomach still does a funny lurch when he sees Cassie, and he’s never going to forget the way he felt with her, but that was a lifetime ago and she’s happy now. He’s — he’s not sure if
“There is sand all over me,” Cas grumbles. He’s stomping around in a circle in some futile attempt to get rid of it, which would be absurd if it wasn’t kind of adorable, a mid-thirties man in a sweatshirt and horrid sandals on the beach pacing like that.
Vaporeon doesn’t go in her Poke Ball very often. Like most Pokemon owners, he has the ball only in case of emergency. John used to complain that she got the seats in the car wet, so she got called back to her ball for long rides, but she’d come out looking both haggard and bummed out and Dean hated that. Now she lounges luxuriously across Dean’s lap on the bus.
anyone who puts a toe out of line. Cas, he could have found redemption with those douchebags, but he gave up an entire army of angels for me. And I failed. All he got for what he did was me bolting away from anyone who cared about me and fucking and fighting my way across the country. I was a goddamn demon. We were both stupid to have hope.”
It’s bullshit, but unfortunately, she’s probably right. It’s a myth that Absol brings bad juju, when really, they’re the ones who come to

When they get to the gym, the guard – not Flagstaff, though his Pokemon is also a Garchomp, but a a big guy with shellacked hair and a serious resting bitchface – waves them in no questions asked. They should probably talk strategy, but once they get inside the training center, Gabriel takes some big strides forward, as big as she can get with her tiny frame, and offers up an eruption of a grin. “Heya,
“Drifblim!” Lilith cries out. Her gaze tracks over the sky, until she sees him, drifting over the trees in the distance. He’s high above the battle, serenely looking out at it. “Come back –”
“Last big
like those rich assholes keeping the place afloat could tell I didn’t like them much and I’m paying for it now.”
Latios skims through the air. There’s no serious, determined bent to his brow, like there was when he was Cas. He glides by on autopilot. It’s easy and smooth and beautiful to see and it makes Dean want to fucking hurl. At that moment, Dick Roman chooses to call Cas back to his Poke Ball – just thinking it rattles Dean even more – and vanish with the rest of Lucas’ followers. He doesn’t know where they’re going, but it can’t be anywhere good.
Their footsteps are deafeningly loud in the forest as they walk together. There’s no map after all. It’s just the two of them, the faith they lost a long time ago that things would turn out okay in the end, and Purgatory pressing in thick and endless.
“I get it,” Sam says, nodding, “Trust me, I do.” The funny thing about his relationship with Sam was that Dean felt like his brother
Dean looks back to the group gathered on the hill, just to nod at Flagstaff in recognition of her guarding the rest of the younger people and the non-fighters. What he finds, instead, is Naomi, pulling off her heels and unbuttoning her stiff suit jacket to reveal a plain navy blue shirt, even if it’s one made of fancy material.
“She insisted we call her that. Not Gabby, either. Gabe was okay.” Dean had meant his question as confirmation of Gabriel’s identity, but Anna apparently took it as questioning her name. She smiles wistfully down at the picture. “I wish I didn’t look so – cranky. Wouldn’t have been, if I’d known. We all take so much shit for granted.”
(Claire’s first gift to Jack was, apparently, matching pajamas.)
“Were you practicing?” the boy asked, a strand of dark hair falling recklessly into his eyes. “What?” Dean asked, thrown. Noticing the boy’s eyes had been a mistake. They were eternally blue—not like the ocean, but like the deep sky just above a sunset. Celestial. Mesmerizing.
Dean remembered how his whole body had seemed to melt in that moment as the sincerity of Cas’s words-- mostly simple reasoning, though with an undercurrent of self-imperative gravity-- washed over him.
," Garth chuckled through his popcorn. "Any least favorites?"
"Really though," she chuckled, "it was an easy one. In and out and 'bye-bye monster.' Any hang ups on your end?"
perfect.
The smile spread across his face slowly but grandly, his eyes as bright as they’d ever been.
Cas moved his hand just enough to brush fingers through the side of Dean's hair. "Would you like to kneel?" he asked softly. Dean nodded.
, and he understood that sometimes feeling was unpleasant. He understood that meaningful, beautiful things could still hurt. So, he continued to walk the halls barefoot, even as Dean’s eyes twitched over his blanched feet, because it continued to make him feel…
Claire showed up late that night, hauling a huge bag over her shoulder and positively beaming.
“Happy birthday, Jack,” he whispered, just loud enough.
Cas loved seeing him like this- sleeves rolled up in concentration, the idea of a smile just starting to play across his face. A spark of adrenaline in his eyes that had nothing to do with imminent danger.
Dean glanced at the kitchen counter, where, sure enough, he had left his dance bag. He bit his lip, muttered a “Right, sorry,” and took it away to his and Sammy’s room.
Cas bit his lip as he worked to stifle the last of it; Dean huffed out a sigh and looked back to Jo, defeated.
“Of course you did,” Cas soothed, ruffling his hair. “You took all of your turns, and that’s very brave. You had some hard words, too. I know Uncle Garth was very impressed.”
hello! in light of recent, magnificent events, I've decided to give this story another go. I'm not sure yet what the update schedule will be, but I'll be aiming for at least once a week. obviously over the course of seven years (yikes, sorry) I've forgotten a lot of my original plans for this, but I have some really fun new ideas that I'm excited to share with you! I've already made some (minor, but necessary) edits to the first two chapters to reflect this. this is a short chapter, but it gets the ball rolling again. please enjoy! much love x
Of course, the obvious and unfortunate downside to all this was that he could now feel
Castiel glanced up to the clock on the back wall. Ten minutes until the end of the period. “Well,” Castiel said, looking down himself, “um, see you around.”
The school day passed without much incident until fifth period, which, for Dean, was advanced computer science. He took his seat next to his best friend Charlie—a bubbly, energetic girl with bright red hair to match; a moment later, their friend Ash—who had frankly concerning energy levels and a mullet to match— slumped down into the seat on his other side.
“All well?” Cas asked gently, and he meant it, no teasing. He was always so earnest in his wanting to know every detail about Dean, and the softness in his voice was relaxing enough that Dean could breathe out a “Yeah,” and mean it back. He tried to maintain his hold on his words.
“I believe the term is ‘gentlemen,’ Bobby,” Dean said in mock-offense. Bobby chuckled once to himself before answering, “A gentleman wouldn’t leave his sweat in my kitchen. How many times I got to tell you not to put that duffle of yours on my counter?”
“Whatever you are, I guess,” Ash shrugged, still typing away at his codes.
person you ought to be taking advice from, Sammy,” Dean laughed. Sammy crossed his arms. “So? I still value your opinion.”
— but of course Dean had been right. When Cas took his first step onto the grainy sundrenched beach, he had actually gasped aloud from the feeling of the warmth between his toes. At this revelation, Dean had positively beamed—and then promptly buried Cas up to his knees, only freeing him to go let the water lap at his ankles.
and then a hand on his own back.
"Well," Cas grinned, "that is important. Do you want to try any of the other ones you've looked at?"
time,” Garth stage whispered. “‘Will-o-the-wisp’? No
"That's one word?"
he screamed at himself, but Cas was laughing again. The former angel stepped lightly toward him until their chests were just barely not touching and his eyes were locked up on Dean’s. How anyone could look at him with such wonder-- such open
“Hello, Claire,” he said softly, and her smile widened in return.
Dean didn’t have to ask what he meant.
“Cas!” Dean exclaimed, catching sight of him as he turned toward a platter sitting on the island.
They carefully brought out the multi-layered confection and set it in a place of honor on the table. It really was beautiful, in that rustic homemade sort of way. Dean had baked it himself (chocolate, from scratch) and painstakingly applied the icing (vanilla, also from scratch). Cas had been allowed to apply the green “Happy Birthday, Jack!” on the grounds that he had the best penmanship, but then it was back to Dean for the rest of the piping. Sam had been firmly denied any decorating access, which he reluctantly agreed was probably for the best.
“Oh, uh, no,” Dean cleared his throat. “I have merely been luxuriating.” He gestured grandly at the sunlight streaming in over them. “Just waiting to give my little brother a ride.” Which, speaking of, it was probably time to go and collect Sammy.
Jack rang out an earnest, “Oh, thank you, Sam!” at the same time Claire drawled out an overly decadent “Thank you,
, Jo!"
Cas caught Eileen’s smile again as Sam announced, “Right, well, there’s no point in trying to do this unsupervised,” so after some careful plastic wrapping, the three of them filed back out to the front room.
I did, you silly billy! I could hardly join the football team! Somebody with my skills on there, winning all the games for ‘em? They'da forgot how to stay humble."
Beautiful.
Jack giggled again as Dean and Cas cheered behind him, waving his participation certificate and ribbon in the air.

Cas decided to go ahead and let Dean have a head start; it would give him some time to think of a little something extra for later.
“But you told me about your rings once, do you remember?” Cas went on eagerly. “We were driving back from Sun Valley, and, er, ‘Gimme Shelter’? ….came on the radio, and you told me about how you used to sneak away from your father to go look for them at second-hand stores. You said that in the end you had more than enough for one per finger, because you wanted ‘options.’”
Dean Winchester took a shower and brushed his teeth.
Excitement sparked in Dean's eyes. If something held him up, the "punishment" would probably just be the original "plans" going by a different name, and they both knew it. But Dean was even less patient than Cas, and they both knew that, too.
He refused because he was adamant that there was a lesson to be learned here, and though he couldn’t quite figure out what it was, he thought he was getting closer. Cas wanted to
“It was awesome!” he started in. He did not stop to breathe as he continued, "We got to do this exercise where we built bridge models, and I got to work with Charlie and this other girl, Stevie, and since our first official meeting is tomorrow, we're all supposed to think of potential theme ideas tonight." This time, Dean ruffled Sam’s hair as Ellen remarked how excited she was for him.
, and said, “Dean, I need to tell you something.”
He tried to breathe steadily, listening for the soft ringing emanating from the vial around his neck.
“Okay, lil sis,” he chuckled, glancing over. He might only have three months on her, but he still prided himself on being the big brother.
"So gentlemen," Garth asked now, turning towards them again, "what's your favorite word on the list? I know y'all two must know the whole thing backwards and forwards by now."
“Yeah, okay,” Dean smiled, almost sated. He looked down at the counter, hands hovering, clearly wanting to keep fussing, but seeing nothing to fix. “Okay.”
“Well,” Cas answered, all tilted smiles once more, “I didn’t. I inferred.” The ring, Dean’s heart swelled to see, was now placed snugly on the middle finger of Cas’s left hand. He kind of liked that it wasn’t quite the “traditional” placement. It added another layer of balance to the symbols; this was for them, and no one else.
Cas left his hand on Dean as Dean rose, then moved his thumb to give Dean a kiss- quick but sweet.
do you hear me?”
it said.
Could a person die of love? Cas still felt like he might, even though the internet had assured him that, no, that didn’t happen.
"Nada." Dean moved back towards the duffle bag. "HQ ain't really my thing, but if you two keep up like this, we'll have to send Sam and Eileen on vacation more often."
“Yeah, well…” he started, unsure what to say. He found his mouth opening again before he even knew what would come out. “Hey, listen, it was nice running into you again, Cas.” But as he stood up to leave, he noticed the boy giving him that strange, tilted look again.
When the final bell rang and the rest of the school herded towards the parking lot, Dean veered away to the courtyard. It was small, and it always smelled like sawdust from the woodshop, but it had a tree and a bench and warm sunlight—a good place to relax. He’d thought about going to the choir room again, but ultimately figured he could really use the full rest day. Still, he listened to his routine music twice through before switching to Bob Seger.
“Well, speak of the devil…” Dean said, nodding towards the window. A moment later, the door opened and shut again to reveal Bobby, who was sporting his favorite green ball cap and a fine perfume of motor oil.
“Actually, I’m thinking about practicing for a little bit. Just go through it once or twice, you know? Since it’s getting to be that time.”
Still, it was haunting how natural he looked there next to the keys, and it was several seconds later that Dean realized he was literally creeping on this kid. Come on, though. Castiel was letting all this beautiful music pour out into a very open, very public room. It wasn’t Dean’s fault they had both chosen this place to come practice.
The stars were still clear and bright overhead as he leaned back against the windshield, finishing the last of his granola bar. Sweet air, scented with a tranquil mixture of hay and motor oil and crisp summer dawn, filled his nose. If driving home from rehearsal was his favorite ritual, these quiet, stolen mornings were a close second. Today would be a good day, Dean thought, as the heavens reflected in his eyes. He had always had a good feeling about Thursdays.
Cas' breath is warm in his ear.
Cas nods, looking Dean over, taking all of him in, and with anyone else it would make Dean want to hit them, it would make him feel like he was being weighed and judged. But it's Cas, and he can see in Cas' face that he is memorizing this moment, Dean splayed out beneath him for the first time. Dean watches Cas' face this time, watches his eyes move from Dean's mouth to his throat, to his left shoulder, to his chest, down across his stomach, the backs of his thighs with his legs still stretched up and thrown over Cas' shoulders. He watches Cas' eyes reach the place where his cock disappears inside him and he can feel him twitch. Dean can imagine what it looks like and it makes his own dick harder, which Dean wasn't sure was possible at this point.
And yet, despite all of it, Dean and Cas were a story fighting to be told. This, whatever this is, was never supposed to happen. It was a choice flying in the face of God, in spite of all odds.
Cas is just tracing these things across his skin. It's not a spell, they aren't fixed to him. But Dean feels it like something physical all the same.
It's the knowledge that this is Cas pressed into him. Cas, who is going to come inside him. Cas, who is feeling Dean's deepest vulnerabilities beneath his hands as he just holds him like this. It's being open to him, being vulnerable, trusting Cas to see him like this, have him like this.
Cas' eyes are wide. He looks nearly as shattered as Dean feels. Honestly, Dean had no idea Cas could even look like that, and it's…
Dean's first instinct is to hunch up against the onslaught, to push Cas away, to be cold and alone rather than listen to Cas' gravel voice just fucking pouring love out over him. It's too much. He doesn't get to have this, he shouldn't get to have this.
They spend minutes like this, a slow steady creak of the mattress - and Dean realizes suddenly that he's never had sex on this mattress before, he hasn't brought anyone home since they got an actual home - and their erratic breathing. Cas lets go of Dean's hair and slides his hand down to Dean's hip, slipping around to cup his ass. He traces patterns over Dean's skin, into his ass, his lower back, back to his stomach, around his nipples. It takes a few moments for Dean to recognize that the patterns have repeating shapes, and then to realize that its Enochian symbols. It's hard to tell without seeing them, and besides, Dean is not that great at Enochian, but he knows enough to partially translate. There are words of protection, of… not possession, exactly, but something like belonging, of bonds unbroken, of endless time, of something like the word beloved.
Madame McLeod had once said.
"I love you," he said again.
The bee then passed as all bees do for the adults in attendance: slowly, at first, and then with nerve-wracking, humbling intensity. In the end, Jack came in fourth on “convalescence.” (“Darned a’s,” Dean echoed under his breath.)
He doesn’t get to sleep that night until the sun’s washing the sky pink. In his fitful dreams, he chases stars that wink blue and red and stay frustratingly out of reach. “Bein’ too literal,” Dean grumbles when he wakes up, tapping a finger to his temple. Poor Vaporeon’s been reduced to little more than incredibly concerned looks and cuddles up against his side. She’s doing a damn good job, the best she can.
Dean’s thrown to the ground again, all the air punching out of him in the sudden movement. He tries to raise his hand in an attempt to get up, but it’s no good. No good at all.
“What about you, Cas?”
and the roaming, twitchy little bees all over it, when he’d shown up perching on the front of Dean’s crappy stolen car. “Also the butterflies. They are so beautiful.” Well, that’d explain the long yellow smears of pollen across his arms and abdomen, at least. His voice had been so deadpan, Dean couldn’t tell if what he said was supposed to be a joke. And truthfully, he wasn’t sure if Cas making jokes or being serious about that particular idea was a scarier thought.
He’s back the next day, though, and the next and the next.
Dean realizes she’s talking about him, and he doesn’t even have time to get offended because he realizes that under the overalls, Krissy’s wearing the exact same shirt as him. She starts guffawing, and he picks it right up.
Dean remembers something like this conversation from outside Shopping Mall Nine. He didn’t know it was quite so personal at the time, though. “Heart’s a good thing, Cas. Not the same situation, but God knows I heard the same from –”
Maybe Mary should let him go. There’s probably no good to be had of bringing a vicious warrior angel from one dimension to another just because he happens to bear a resemblance to the angel she’d considered like a son. All logic says this can’t end well.
Running away is a damn smart move. When legendary Pokemon, and legendary
It’s a good thing Cas lands on his lap, because his thick presence is the sweetest way to bring him out of his own thoughts. “Did I distract you?” he asks, practically doing the coquette blinking-eye shit.
, and Dean could be grateful for it. “Thing is, I
In the dark, it’s hard to make out anyone’s features, which is probably what they were going for. Some distant part of Dean’s brain that isn’t rattling out
“You guys and your speeches are too goddamn much,” Dean butts in. Abaddon’s eyes flash in irritation. “Crowing about power. That’s how you get it? Having your Tentacruel pick on a damn Vulpix that never trained for battle? Sweetheart, you’re not some great source of power. You’re a
Their kisses before were slow, almost liquid, but this kiss boils over. Dean’s not sure if he’s the one who flattened himself against the wall, or if Cas boxed him in there, but what matters is that they’ve both got a grip on each other’s arms. There’s a pulse he can feel chattering away against his wrist, and he’s not sure if it’s his own or the one in response from Cas’ own hands. Dean bucks his hips up, hungry for friction, parched for contact.
“I mean it,” she continues. Dean has never gotten a straight answer on whether angels can openly read minds, or whether his thoughts are just particularly loud, but shit like that always freaks him out. “Why do you think he keeps coming back? It’s his connection to you. Soul to grace. God’s still MIA, he’s not doing it. What do you think a
“Guessing you’re Castiel,” she greets, as she offers up a hand. He glances at it the same as he looked at the food. “You’re not much like Inais, are you?”
“It’s up to you,” Cas says, after a few moments of this stand-still. “But I prefer things this way.”
“Cas, I appreciate the pep talk, but this is my brother we’re talking about.”
Cas wasn’t much like Jimmy Novak, sure, but Castiel’s his polar opposite. Whereas Jimmy was all easy smiles and smooth human moves, Castiel never smiles. When he does move, it’s unnatural, jerky, like a kid’s toy with the batteries running low.
“Tell me about it,” Ava says. She’s short, with a no-nonsense haircut with bangs and plain clothes. Her Malamar takes up all the flash, glowing in the dark and whirling his tentacles around. “I think anyone that didn’t get the hell outta there is too brainwashed to say anything.”
“Doin’ what,” Dean asks, because he can’t help it.
Lucas passed out. Lucas lost. They
His balls are tight against his body now, after only a few firm strokes. Proximity to Dean is very, very arousing. Dean stretches his arms, still sleeping, and Cas picks up his pace, panting hard –
“Suspected you might say that.” The corner of Cas’ lips poke up a bit. “Do you also
“Oh yeah. It’s
That’s even worse blasphemy, not living in fear of the rulers of Heaven.
It’s nothing but a slight whirr, but it’s from something man-made. It’s not a Pokemon, no Hoppip trying to keep itself aloft or Klink keeping itself rolling through the night. Dean’s heart picks up to match its pace. The path behind him might sputter out, but in front of him, all it leads to is a tall, slim man. Dean can’t make out his features at all, but shit,
alone? Suit yourself.” He smiles. It’s not very reassuring.
“More than you can imagine,” Cas replies, in a friendly tone. “Let’s start with the people who were using experiments at Edlund University to
Dean isn’t
The ball doesn’t have the opportunity to strike Cas’ body; he grabs it one-handed, and crushes it in its fist. It’s already mangled when he hurls it on the ground. If it wasn’t already unfixable, it certainly is once he stomps on it and crushes it underfoot.
He’s got no idea where they could’ve even found this thing. It’s not like he could go to a Pokemon supply store and buy one along with kibble. Only the very worst Pokemon trainers, the
“Room felt kind of empty?” Dean asks, realization hitting him hard.
A four-legged creature, about Dean’s height, stands in front of him. She’s the picture of grace. Easy swoops and spiky edges meld seamlessly on her body, all in gentle shades of green, pink, and cream. Dean would’ve recognized this Pokemon anywhere, but he thinks of the door of his father’s storage locker, and how the Swords of Justice were so meticulously portrayed. As it turns out, whoever carved that door didn’t do a half-bad job.
to him burns in Dean’s gut, almost forcing its way up through his throat. Still, the guy seems happy enough, and Dean’s not gonna fuck that up.
Dean’s still nervous as hell, even if he knows Anna fairly well by now and Uriel has actually started smiling and nodding back to him in the elevator. Dean’s met Hannah briefly, too; he got a very firm handshake from them, even more intimidating with their blue gaze that had Cas’ intensity taken up yet another notch. But knowing them isn’t the same as getting shoved into a room with them in Hannah’s apartment for a couple of hours, and praying they all like him.
That’s when Castiel speaks up. “I’m never sure what you’re talking about,” he says, “but I wish I had that kind of faith. In anything.”
It’s a new experience. Everything’s new. When the Winchesters would sleep before, he’d merely flit off somewhere, landing in Egypt or China. He’d go to the rainforests and expand his Grace to the very edges of his vessel; he knew he could tilt the world off its axis with a mere thought if he ever returned to Heaven, but he ached to understand how humans could go through their lives as they did, with the trees looming above their heads and the dark richness of the dirt beneath their feet. They are helpless against the coming and going of the weather, a constant reminder of how powerless they truly are.
much, either. Acting like he didn’t even remember.”
when she’d tried and failed to go to college. At the time, he’d had thought that was weird, because she was definitely the most normal of any of them – but he can kinda understand what she’d been yelling about when he talks to her on the phone. “Dean, did my mom say you asked her to help you out with Cas’
“I am not – kidding you, no. She had her own healing area set up in the training center. We were supposed to use it. She had all the right technology, but figuring it out was difficult with no help allowed.”
After a couple of hours, Ellie and Jo complete the long circle around the grounds. “Please,” Ellie tells them, “feel free to spend more time exploring the sanctuary. On Tamara and Ellen’s orders, take as much time as you want.”
“That’s awesome.”
“Are you going to miss him?” Cas asks Dean, after a few moments of silence.
for their mascot.
“I know, and I appreciate it.” Cas pauses, clearly measuring out what he’s going to say next. “Naomi isn’t your father. I’m not saying that. She’s simply very built into her ways. To her, some jobs are worthy and therefore good. These jobs mostly involve Pokemon battling, or working in the police force. Every other job is pointless, and… less good.”
“Also, you have strong powers. You should use them. They’re not bad. You’d tell me that. Max and Alicia are your friends, and good people who can understand what you’ve gone through more than most can. And Eileen wants there to be something between you two as well –”
things
Gabriel’s standing on her tiptoes now, peering out at the distance. She breaks out of Kali’s embrace – it’s funny to see the two of them standing there, Kali statuesque and Gabriel short as hell – to motion her forward. “Help me fight my douchey sister,” she urges. Wildly waving, she moves down the hill. “Long time no see, dickwad!”
“It’s not,” Dean says. His words sound more like a dreamy sigh. More embarrassing shit.
Jody rushes up to him, already juggling a big fat Bidoof in her arms. She grimaces in apology as she shuffles the enormous chunky baby to one arm in order to shake Dean’s hand.
Every moment he'd ever wanted to and thought he couldn't.
Because of course, their family being amassed as it was, there were a lot of presents to get through.
He heard a door close in the distance and knew Cas must be getting home from his new routine of sunrise walks. Dean’s heart accelerated wildly at the sound, and he took a steadying breath, laughing at himself. It’s not like Cas would turn the ring down, he reassured himself. Sure, he was still maybe a little embarrassed at the inequality of his offering, but he knew that Cas would recognize the meaning behind it. And anyway, if the grace was from Cas’s past life, the ring was from Dean’s just the same. They could give each other these pieces of their old selves for safe keeping while they made their new selves together. And in that way, at least, it would be a fair trade.
"Thanks again for coming, buddy," Dean clapped Garth on the back. "I know you're real busy with your practice these days, but you shoulda seen the way Jack's face lit up when we told him you were comin'."
"What?" Dean stammered, immediately blushing red. "But th-"
And Cas was contemplating all of this now, sitting stoically in the library, when Dean once again appeared before him.
“Boys, you here?” a voice shouted into the house.
They smiled at each other as they pulled apart, and Dean warmed as Cas carded his fingers back through his hair again. His stomach swooped when Cas bent to pick the pillow back up for him.
“It’s just, uh,” he stammered on, “I have something for you, and I’m not real good at this part of things, so I just, um…” His mind was going blank again, despite having rehearsed this roughly a dozen times while Cas had been out walking.
“You know me so well, Dean-o,” Ash groaned. “Too well.”  He looked up, blinking. “Neither one of you has any caffeine, though, huh?”
Sam wheeled around, clearly embarrassed, as Dean blazed on. “How’re the decorations coming?”
I believe Sam and Eileen are helping.”
, which Jack now realized he had forgotten to ask about the night before, and then a set of toy lightsabers, complete with sound effects.
Dinner passed in the loud and playful rush that only the best of families know. Eventually, Claire and Jack excused themselves- undoubtedly with several hours of Mario Kart in their immediate future- with Sam and Eileen turning in soon after. As they walked out of the room, Cas surveyed the explosion before him; food scraps and loose feathers adorned the table. A pile of gifts- wrapped with varying degrees of success- was spilling out of Claire’s duffle, still sitting at the far end. He toyed with a pair of abandoned sunglasses and looked over at Dean.
Cas would have chuckled then, if he weren’t so moved. He placed his free hand on Dean’s other cheek and kissed him lightly; Dean’s hands froze. “Thank you,” Cas whispered, trying to meet Dean’s lowered eyes.
Cas suggested his-- a terrarium, a succulent, and a new little castle for Jack’s fish tank-- be first, since he was worried about light exposure.
Well, usually.
“It’s okay,” Cas laughed. “I think I can handle it. You go get everyone.”
"Ah, ah," Cas breathed out, more a laugh than a reprimand. "That's for later, after we're done." Dean smiled, soft and shy in a way that made him absolutely radiant.
"Good morning, Dean," Cas murmured, still thick with sleep. A lump started to form in Dean's throat; waking up together was still novel, especially today.
Jack laughing too hard to take a good picture as Claire and Eileen dueled out a dramatic lightsaber battle on top of the war room table.
As he stepped down through the doorway, he could hear Dean telling Sam, “I know you have Sasquatch hands, but could you at least
” Dean practically growled, level determination in his eyes. “I
Several minutes later, Dean was fully lost in his routine. He had marked through it a couple of times, taken a small break, and was back on his feet. He had just come out of a turn when he heard the costume shop door open. No time for distractions, though. Dean finished the eight count set before stopping and turning his to attention to the doorway.
“Barely,” Ash mumbled from where his lay in his arms.
“What time?” he responded dutifully. “Nah, s’good,” she muttered back. “Hannah drive me.”
think about that day- or the week of hell that followed, leading up to the nightmare of a rescue. He got lost in it sometimes, in a way that cast a faraway look over his eyes. The first instance of this had prompted a worried Cas to say
Dean thought to himself.
"Stand," he said. "Leave the cushion."
Cas had decided to view this as a lesson in temperament.
So, as Cas shifted his focus back to the present to see Dean giving him that small, wistful smile, the fondness in his eyes was almost dizzying-- overwhelming and wonderful.
“Hey, Ellen!” Sam and Dean called back together. Ellen and Bobby were married in just about every way but the legal one; she and her daughter, Jo, had lived with them for five years now. The little house was cramped (Bobby had spent months painstakingly, lovingly adding on a bedroom for Jo) but they didn't mind. Ellen still spent most of her time at The Roadhouse, a pub and diner she owned just outside of town. Jo helped out there on weekends, and while she claimed to "love the time away from the boys," Dean knew she'd rather be here hanging out. They were the same year in school, and had become natural confidants. She was, Dean thought, born to be a sister (she once forcibly painted Dean's toes by pinning him to ground after he politely refused her initial "offer"). Tiny and blonde, but not to be screwed with, she was her mother's daughter in every way.
Lovable.
"Your boy here makes a great fake husband," Jo cut in, giving Cas a playful elbow to the ribs. "Yeah?" Dean smirked. "Makes an even better real one."
And it would have been no matter what, because they were home, because they were family-- but it was so much better for all these little things.
to have some finesse? We’re not making macaroni art here, Sam, this is supposed to be
, he did have a box of old, thrifted rings from when he had wanted to be Mick Jagger back in his early twenties.
“How about,” Cas offered warmly, “we can wake them up once Sam and Eileen are up?” Sam was an early riser anyhow; waking up two early-twenty-somethings before him would be borderline criminal.
, always giving those moments his full attention.
might not have heard you!"
A road, he thought now, that would always lead home.
"Dean." Cas cut him off by placing a palm gently on his cheek, thumb resting over his lips- both a promise and a warning. "We're in the back of the store. We haven't seen anyone in five minutes. I can see around the corner, and if I see anyone coming, I will alert you. All you will do is kneel. However, if you're not amenable to this, I will understand, and there will be no punishment."
“Hell,” Cas heard Dean murmur under his breath, “I coulda been an event planner.” He let Dean take the moment to basque in his pride; it didn’t happen enough, he thought, so it ought to be properly savored.
Thank you SO much for all the positive response this has already gotten! I'm glad you're enjoying it!
“Well,” she grinned, setting her duffle down and sliding out of her jacket, “you
Cas chuckled and gave a small tilt of his head. “In the kitchen, making ‘
“I won’t lose you again.”
“I look better though, obviously,” Claire played haughtily, giving her boa a flip.
“Speaking of Dean,” she circled back, narrowing her eyes and looking around like she had missed something obvious, “where is the old man?”
Dean didn’t even notice Cas walk in, absorbed as he was in the setup of his pancake buffet bar. A dish towel was draped in its usual post over his left shoulder, and he was jovially bopping along to
Garth leveled a wink back at him, expertly tossing a piece up and catching it in his mouth. " 'Do as I say,' huh, Cas?"
of the chocolates were nougat-filled, and it was once again Claire’s insistence that moved things along into present-opening territory.
So he allowed himself to gaze at the freckled face bent in front of him and felt his heart ache in a way that was becoming beautifully familiar. Maybe, it struck him, he had been looking for a lesson in the wrong place.
As everyone filed in a few moments later, he was delighted to see Dean’s smile at his work-- 19 candles spiraling inward, with “2” and “1” candles placed carefully in the very center.
Castiel stood thoughtfully, his head just barely cocked to one side.
"Now," Cas said, "take that up front and pay. I'll get the car and pull up to meet you; I expect you to be ready when I get there." He gestured to the cushion as Dean began kneading it again. "I have plans for the two of you the second we get home, and you know I don't like to be kept waiting."
He would savor this moment. Let it anchor him, overwhelm him, do anything it wanted to him.
“Castiel, look!” Jack called across the room, pushing the glasses up onto his forehead so he could see. (Dean’s phone made another shutter noise.) They slung an arm around Claire’s shoulders and beamed, “We match!”
Cas’s eyebrows drew up in shock, but the smile stayed in place.
He huffed again, but Cas caught the smile that quirked at his lips, and—heaven above—felt the
everything felt through humanity. And when Dean had realized what Cas was doing, he had dropped everything and driven all night to take him to Salt Lake, muttering wildly about how “angels don’t feel temperature.” Cas had insisted that it could wait— that he had
Hands raised in mock defense, Dean asserted, “Course I did.” (It was anyone’s guess.)
” Dean smiled with over the top, gooey affection.
"Do you like this one?" Cas asked. Dean paused a moment, still feeling, then gave a non-committal hum. He wasn't really sure how to tell like this.
“They’re just about done,” he answered softly. “Claire is here.”
"Is it soft enough?"
Dean returned quickly, ruffling his hair drowsily. “Speaking of crazy kids,” Ellen turned to ask Sammy, “how was the Rube Goldberg callout? Think it's gonna be everything you hoped and dreamed?” Sam had spent nearly all of summer break geeking out at the realization that he would finally be able to join the high school's team. ("All of high school before you," Dean had asked, "and that's what you're hyped about? Mousetrap?") At his cue, Sam grinned broadly.
“Nope!” Garth beamed. “Came in seventh. ‘Pandemonium.’”
Cas leaned in toward his son, catching his eye away from the pile of developing photographs.
*chapter edited on 9 November 2020
Sam chattered non-stop in the car about his meeting after school, reminding Dean no less than three times to not leave without him. Dean was always amazed at Sam’s ability to be so sulky and groggy and teenagery when he first woke up, and then somehow flip a switch in his brain to turn into an amphetamined hamster in a wheel in approximately zero seconds flat. “Yes, Sammy,” he cut in. “I know. Don’t abandon you. It’s fine, Jo’ll stop us if I try to leave.”
Plus, he always liked it better when Dean won, anyway.
“Kids,” Bobby muttered to Sam, who pretended to nod sympathetically while Jo and Ellen laughed.
"It's not, uh... too overstuffed? So I won't lose my balance."
“Surviving the day, Ash?” Charlie asked, leaning around Dean.
He shifted his focus down to his hand, where he could feel Cas’s fingers wrapped in his, the edge of the ring pressing into his skin.
The cake made its way around once-- or twice-- more, Claire started reading the lego instructions, and Jack began learning the patient exhilaration of polaroid candids.
That would work.
He continued fussing over bowls of fruit and powdered sugar as Cas grabbed a mug and settled in at the table. Eventually, Dean stopped to survey his work. Seeming sufficiently pleased, he turned to ask, “You wanna go wake the kids up?”
"Oh, Deano, we're home!" a song-song voice echoed from the top of the stairs.
Family.
Not long after, once everyone had been assembled in the kitchen, breakfast passed with only minor incident. (Sam had wanted to put a candle in Jack’s pancakes, but Dean insisted that they wait for cake, citing “tradition” and “anticipation” and “letting some things be sacred.”)
"They all break eventually," Garth nodded knowingly.
Dean felt himself smile, but mostly he felt something swell and flutter inside his chest. He looked at Cas, thinking of how lucky he was. Of every moment he'd ever wanted to say it and thought he couldn't. Of how he would never not say it again.
This chapter was originally published on 22 Dec. 2013.
Soon enough, the bell rang, and Dean went upstairs to his locker. He took his time with the trip and took his time trading putting away textbooks. It wasn’t like he really had anywhere to be. Soon enough, though, he made his way back downstairs and across the building to the music hallway. Dean liked to practice in the choir room, because it had an entire wall of mirrors and was only otherwise used until fourth period.
