“And Cassie’s not gonna back down, because his mom hardwired him to be the best at whatever he does.” Gabriel sighed. “I wonder if there were a way for them to both be First Chair, if they’d be able to get past this bullshit.”
"He's gorgeous," Sam said, smiling and rocking the baby in his arms. "I still can't believe you named him after me." He dropped a kiss to the top of the baby's head. He looked over at Gabriel, who was watching him with a dopey grin on his face.
Sam gave that some thought. Had Chuck known about the Winchesters and their angels' bonding and having kids? Did he already know what their kids would go through and decided to give them a chance to make things better, a choice that hadn't been given to Sam and Dean? Maybe Chuck was just setting up the biggest prophecy to date and he wanted Sam and Dean in on this one as well, but being Unwritten meant he could get them involved sooner than expected, giving them an advantage.
"That wasn't us, dude," he tried to explain. He turned to the other angel and said, "Cas, you know
Sam liked kissing as much as he liked having his hair played with, and Gabriel was really, really good at it. Sam wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close, tilting his head and slotting his mouth against Gabriel's like they were made for each other. Their tongues dueled for dominance as Gabriel ground his ass into Sam's now-fully-erect cock.
So he let go.
First Chairs in a section, regardless of the instrument. He looked at Dean, who appeared as shocked as he was.
Bobby acted on what everyone was thinking; he strode straight up to Chuck and nailed him in the chin with a hard right hook. Chuck’s head barely moved, but it let back just slightly. Rubbing his jaw, Chuck just smiled at Bobby.
“That’s okay, Cas,” Dean said, throwing an arm over Castiel’s shoulder and setting the butterflies in his stomach into flight again. “We’re meeting at our place Friday night, so you can keep your practice schedule. You wouldn’t want to miss out on the fun, would you?” he asked with a wink.
As the band had just ended their set, Castiel’s loud gulp at Dean’s statement was audible, and Dean smirked at him. The man oozed sex appeal, even when he wasn’t trying. The question was, was he trying now?
As Sam, Gabriel, and Cas stumbled back to catch their breath, Dean sat on his haunches jacking his cock as fast as he could, but there was no relief in sight. Castiel dragged Dean to his feet and dropped to his own knees, taking Dean's angry red erection into his mouth. Dean vibrated with pleasure as he threaded his fingers into Cas' hair and fucked his face until he too was screaming his release.
"Gabriel, PLEASE! Do whatever you want to me, fuck me, blow me, whatever the fuck you were doing before, just let me come!" Dean was pleading now, no shame, tears running down his face. He wanted release more than anything by this point. And that was all Gabriel wanted from him, to take him down a peg and make him beg for what he wanted. With a flick of his wrist, grace flooded Dean's system, causing his entire body to ignite and tip him over the precipice. Dean came harder and longer than he ever had before. As Gabriel released his hold on him, Dean slumped to the ground and rolled to his side.
* * * * *
After a few more deep breaths, Dean removed his own underwear, then Cas'. He stood there studying Cas' body, trailing fingertips over the firm muscles in his shoulders and chest, down his sides to his trim waist, admiring the man's build. Hands on his hips, he pulled Cas' body against his own.
, for now just close your eyes and forget I’m me.”
MJ got out the Twister mat and they all explained the rules and how the game was played to Cas before playing a few rounds, laughing as they slid around and tried to knock each other over. Dean swore Gabriel was using his grace to cheat, because Gabriel always seemed to be the last one standing. They decided to call the game and move on to food when Sam ended up on his back with Gabriel straddling him, and making out was imminent.
“Pops is older than dirt,” Bobby laughed. “There’s a lot about him you don’t know yet.”
Castiel looked at him, Dean’s smile lighting up his eyes and he couldn’t help smiling back. “One of these days, we may actually make it out of our clothes.”
“Like Twister?” Cas asked.
For the most part, Gabriel seemed to be coping with what had happened. Although he still seemed like himself, he was more subdued. On occasion, Sam would catch him with a look on his face he couldn’t quite recognize, just staring off into space. When he’d ask Gabriel what he was thinking about, Gabriel would give him a brilliant smile and say “just you, gorgeous”. Sam would just smile back at him fondly, but he knew something had fundamentally changed in his angel.
"You and I are able to keep the children safe," Castiel countered. "Countless lives could be saved by sharing the information housed here."
Sweaty, shaky, and on edge, Dean's entire body was lit up and on the precipice of orgasm. He didn't want to give Gabriel the satisfaction, but he needed to come so fucking bad. He might have been able to hold out if he didn't
He turned to go to the kitchen, but almost ran right into a short blonde woman in her thirties with a scar going from her left temple down to her neck. She lowered the shotgun in her hand and said, "God dammit, Dean, you're supposed to be on perimeter patrol with Sam. Gabe's taking good care of Cas."
. Everyone knew Dean was a flirt, even thought he was a player because of it. Fact of the matter is, Dean wasn’t a man-whore; he liked the chase, but the follow-through left a lot to be desired. The people he pursued tended to be lacking in one way or another, and he couldn’t force himself past it.
“Of course,” Cas said, chagrined that he did not think that Mary would need to console herself over Dean’s condition the same way Castiel needed to. He stood and held the chair out for Mary to sit next to her son. She smiled at him as she took Dean’s hand in hers. Sam walked to the other side of the bed and squeezed Dean’s other hand before walking over to Gabriel, who placed a hand on his shoulder before flying them out to retrieve the Impala.
"Yes Dean?"
Bobby shrugged. “Pops started putting instruments in my hands when I was a baby. This is the only thing that stuck,” he said, holding up the guitar. “I think he really started teaching me when I was five or six.”
* * * * *
* * * * *
“Good thinking, Cas,” Dean laughed, taking the bag and heading off to the kitchen.
"Hey Cas," Dean said, licking his lips, "I think you might wanna take off. I think that compulsion thing is hitting me again."
“Sure, why not?” Sam said with a shrug. “Kevin going to play the second part?”
it. "Please," Dean whispered.
so many words, but all meaning
on Dean.
When Sam walked back in, Dean lifted his head and reached out for the bottle. Sam shook his head and took his place again at Castiel's back. He slicked up his fingers and reached underneath the angel. He deftly worked the angel open while massaging the main joint at the top of his left wing with his other hand. At the firm pressure to the joint Castiel's back bowed, grinding further down onto Dean's lap.
hurts.” He slid his sword into a scabbard hanging at his left side and took another couple of steps back. “Love you Sam,” he said with a sad smile.
Rehearsals the following week weren’t nearly as awkward as Castiel thought they might be. He and Kevin had been reviewing their parts for
“If I may make a suggestion?” Castiel asked, looking up from Dean’s laptop. “We know he’s highly intelligent and enjoys his studies, and also that he enjoys movies and music. As long as you don’t give him a powerful artifact, those are a good place to start."
"I think working the Crowley front will be the easiest," Sam said, looking at his brother. "You guys had that bromance going on when you had the Mark of Cain, and he did help us when Amara tried to end the universe. Besides, if we tell him we can cage Lucifer for him and he won't need the kids' power, maybe he'll back off."
“Seriously, Dean,” Sam said with a bitchface.
“Sam was right, you’re both damned good,” he said loudly. “The KCO is lucky to have both of you, despite your little pissing matches every other month.” Dean grinned sheepishly at that, while Cas just frowned. “If you boys wanna keep that up, do it on your own time. As far as the board is concerned, you’re

Tagging for non-con, the fallout of said non-con, minor character death, and angst.
“We’re not dealing, Crowley,” Dean said, shrugging the demon’s hand off his shoulder. “You let them out, or we kill you.”
MJ took the phone from her dad and dialed Crowley’s number. As she walked some ways away to hear the call, Dean turned to his brother and their angels. “I love her to death, but I wouldn’t put it past her to try another stunt like last time. One of us has to keep her in sight at all times until we get Lucifer back in the cage.”
"Now do you understand why I wish for this to continue, Dean?" Cas asked when Dean's eyes fluttered open.
"When was Gabriel here?" Dean asked, frowning at the thought of the asshole archangel seeing him in the midst of another cuddle puddle.
ended and Warrant’s
talking about my sex life with my daughter!” Dean yelled at his brother.
In which a little sibling rivalry makes everyone happy (and loud).
They couldn’t find the kid anywhere, and no one in Heaven was talking. On top of that, there were rumors floating around Hell that the Winchesters were going to kill the Scribe of God. Gabriel was sure similar rumors were floating around upstairs.
As when anytime things start getting better, something new pops up. Or in this case, pops out. Baby Sammy shouldn’t have had enough control of his wings to travel like Gabriel and Castiel do, but he started popping in and out of rooms days ago. Sam and Dean laughed when Gabriel painted an angel trap on the floor and put Sammy in the middle of it.
Dean and Cas held eye contact as they started the piece, titled
Cas just smiled, wrapping an arm around Dean and running his fingers through Sammy’s wings. “I told you they were,” he said happily.
The next few hours passed in a similar manner, with Dean and Cas trading flirty remarks and innuendo as they practiced. Somehow along the way, their chairs got closer and closer together until their legs were rubbing against each other. Dean didn’t know about Cas, but he’d been playing with a raging hard-on for at least half an hour.
He found Sam sitting at the piano still, despite his student leaving hours ago. He was furiously scribbling at staved sheets, putting notes to paper.
“He goes by Chuck,” Sam told her, making his mom’s eyebrows shoot up.
"Danel, Anane, Turel, it's been a long time," Gabriel said, "but not long enough. You don't have any business being here."
Gabriel said, “but I’m not a hundred percent certain.”
“Nah,” Dean said with a shrug. “He tried teaching classes after he got outta school, but he likes working one on one with the kids. Says he can give them better attention and help them more like that. Our aunt keeps telling him he should get some of his work published, he’s that damned good, but Sammy’s happier with the kids.”
Once she was cleaned up, healed up, and in a loose tee shirt that hung halfway down her thighs, Sam picked her up and carried her to the room he prepared for her, Dean and MJ hot on his heels. Gabriel slumped into a chair, shaking. He pulled the top of her shredded uniform towards it, flipping it around in his hand. The patch over one pocket says ‘Williams’, the one on the opposite pocket reads U.S. Army. There’s a rank on the collar, a chevron connected to a rocker-Specialist.
Sam, Gabriel, and Castiel were waiting in the war room, weapons already strapped on but items strewn over the map table as they do a last-minute check of what they might and might not need.
Crowley stood up and straightened himself out, smug grin on his face. “Well, whatever she is, she’s important to you. What are you willing to give me for her?"
He was rewarded with one of those fantastic smiles, all gums and teeth that Cas was so stingy with. Dean was starting to hope that those smiles were just for him.
Sam realized that wasn't the first time Gabriel had called him gorgeous. He also realized that out of all the nicknames Gabriel had given him, that one was his favorite. He smiled down at his angel and placed a chaste kiss on his lips.
They didn’t let go of each other, panting hard until breathing, living, became a bit easier. Gabriel felt the sob catch in Sam’s chest before feeling the tears slide across his own face. Gabriel didn’t move when he said, “I don’t blame you, but I forgive you. I love you and we’ll live.”
Castiel was confused. Had Dean and Sam lost someone to a drunk driver? Did the subject make Dean uncomfortable, or even sad over such a loss? If so, maybe he could provide some solidarity for Dean, as an olive branch for their newfound friendship. Before he could think better of it, he stood beside Dean and telling him, “If you would like to contribute, I would be glad to assist where I can.”
Gabe beamed and leaned down to capture Sammy’s lips in his, prompting Dean to drag Cas out of the room to leave the two lovebirds alone. He never let go of Cas’ hand though, thanking his lucky stars for all their good fortune, and praying he didn’t just jinx himself.
Sam started struggling again, fighting against Dean who was trying to calm him down. “Hold on, hold on a sec, okay? Listen to me!” Sam stopped struggling, but he was panting for breath as he tried to calm down and listen to Dean. “Gabriel let you have too much of his grace for too long. You got addicted to it, like the demon blood. You’re going through withdrawal right now. You gotta come down and get used to having just the right amount in you before you go near Gabriel again or you could hurt him.”
“That was the plan, but I thought you’d already have something made,” Gabriel replied, taking Castiel’s seat and scrolling through his browser history. “Did you actually spend the day on the internet instead of following your meticulous schedule?” Castiel turned to face Gabriel and nodded slightly, a faint blush rising in his cheeks. Gabriel just grinned and said, “you rebel,” before turning back to Castiel’s laptop.
“Some new protective sigils for the bunker,” Sam told him, handing him his notes. “Should keep us from having to remodel every time we piss someone off.”
* * * * *
Sam was losing hope. Worse yet, he was losing faith. He prayed to God constantly over the last four days, hoping Chuck would hear and find it in him to cut his little family reunion short to save Gabriel and their unborn child, but he had no indication that he had even been heard. He moved restlessly through the bunker from one pile of research to the next. He barely slept or ate, digging through book after book and file after file between attacks. Castiel had opened his bond with Dean somewhat in order to keep him healthy as he worked non-stop to try finding Gabriel, but Sam had no such help and was due to crash hard if he didn’t slow down and take a break soon.
Dean looked at the title, and felt like shit and excited all at once.
“Was there ever any doubt?” Gabriel asked cockily. “Come on down from there, gorgeous, I think I need to do a little research of my own.”
He threw his pillow across the room, picked up his cell phone to call his cousin to see if he was playing that evening. Gabriel played trumpet for a jazz band at a local prohibition-era-themed club, The Speakeasy. Even if he wasn’t, Gabriel was one of those individuals who was always happy, smiling at everyone and enjoying life. His moods were always infectious and Castiel needed a little of that tonight. It would help him keep his mind off a certain cellist who drove him insane.
, the only one he knew the words to. As they sang together at the tops of their lungs, Dean watched his angel smiling bigger and brighter and laughing more than he ever had. How had he missed the light in those ocean-blue eyes before? Maybe because before it was all business and trying to save the world and crap. When Cas let loose, Dean could see how handsome, how
That must have been the right answer, because Dean clapped him on the back and said, “you’re a good kid, Kev.”
Gabriel grabbed his attention again. "The second demon faction just wants Bobby. Since Amara expelled Lucifer from Cas, he's been hopping from vessel to vessel. There are demons who want Lucifer to rule Hell instead of Crowley, and they think Bobby is the ultimate vessel. Get Luci back in the cage and you might be able to stop them."
"I guess? I've never really thought about it." Sam was getting uncomfortable with the conversation, but he couldn't seem to stop himself. "Everyone seems to have a preference, either length or girth, but the general consensus is that bigger is better."
“No he didn’t!” Sam yelled back. “He has his own reasons for wanting to be the best, did you ever think about that?”
"Not yet, angel," he said, "not until I'm inside you." Dean held him like that with three fingers deep in his ass, not moving until Cas' breathing slowed down. "You good?" Cas nodded. "Are we ready to try this?" he asked.
"Ha ha," Dean said dryly. "Let's just figure this thing out before we have another couch incident."
Sam couldn't stop humping Dean and was about to manhandle him into position to fuck him when Gabriel grabbed his hand and yanked him over. "C'mon, Sammy," Gabriel ordered, "ride my ass. Better than Dean's-half the guilt and twice the fu-
“Thank you?” Castiel said, wondering where this was going.
* * * * *
“Hey Deano!” Gabriel called out, getting their attention. “You’re handy with power tools. Care to help me with a little arts and crafts project?”
angel?), "you can pick the movie. I don't think Dean or the kids will mind." He kept his hand on Gabriel's back as he led him out of the library.
Gabriel surged forward and kissed Sam good and hard. It startled Sam, but he rolled with it; this was Gabriel’s show. Gabriel kissed and licked and nipped at Sam’s mouth, teasing him playfully. Sam gave as good as he got, stroking Gabriel from hip to ass and back again, scritching with his fingernails, dragging his fingertip along his crack. Gabriel responded with small, feather light strokes across his ribs.
Gabriel scrunched his nose at that. “I wasn’t sure what to get him, but I think I did okay. I really wish I could have given him a way to get back to his own time.”
"Hey!" Gabriel said indignantly. "I'm quite the catch, Deano. Besides, it's an improvement over that demon bitch he was banging, if you ask me." This time Gabriel got the bitchface from Sam, which just made him laugh. "Oh yeah, they've cataloged and numbered Sam's bitchfaces, too. It's hilarious."
with you, Cas, and I just don’t wanna think about what my life would be like if you weren’t in it.”
"A compulsion to blow us?" Dean asked skeptically.
Thinking of holding on to someone, a pair of icy blue eyes that heated him up from the inside flashed into his mind. He shook it off though, knowing Cas Novak was one person he had nothing in common with and had no desire to get to know better.
With Mary watching baby Sammy and MJ and Bobby gone for the evening, the Winchester boys decided to call it quits for the night to spend some quality time with their angels.
"Do you have to ask?" Deanna groaned, reaching up and pulling Gabriel into another searing kiss. "You're my guardian angel," she breathed into his mouth as they parted. Gabriel smiled sweetly against her lips and snapped his fingers again. Another wave of pleasure washed over her, and when her hips bucked he easily slid his dick inside her and making her cry out, "

“Where’s the Christmas dinner I was promised?” Sam asked with a fake pout, coming up behind Gabriel and resting his chin on top of his angel’s head.
“I’ve only had a couple overlapping memories so far,” MJ told her dads, “but none of them include another cousin.” She chewed her lip, worried. “I mean, that doesn’t mean much, right? It doesn’t mean that I won’t have another cousin waiting for me back in 2037, right?”
“Holy shit!” she said, not caring if her brother heard the curse word because it seemed like curse words made him laugh hysterically. She put her finger in her mouth, tasting a little coppery. She held her finger in front of Sammy and showed him the papercut and frowned at him. “You gave Sissy an owie,” she said with a pouty voice. Sammy stopped laughing; now he looked like he was going to cry. He reached out and grabbed onto the finger with the papercut.
Sam sitting in one of the wingback chairs with MJ and Bobby in his lap, reading them a book.
But he said he trusted Cas, and he wasn’t gonna back down now.
Dean swallowed and nodded. "Yeah, good idea." Dean slid across the Impala's seat until he was in Cas' personal space. He reached out for Cas' hair, running his fingers through it. No matter what he did-combing it with his fingers, patting it down, pushing it back-it still looked like Cas' head had been thrashing around on a pillow. And that was a thought
“Because she’s here and I want her to love me. Your mother loved you but isn’t here anymore, so why do you keep trying to please her?”
"So, what? You want to compare our sizes by...?" Sam trailed off, hoping this wasn't going where he thought is was going, because he didn't think he'd be able to stop himself if it was.
A couple hours later, Dean came back into the library, heading straight for the bookshelves and checking the titles on the spines. “Hey Sammy,” he called out over his shoulder, “where are the books on Japanese culture and history?”
When Castiel had to break for air, gasping, Dean furiously unbuckled Castiel’s belt. He then yanked Castiel’s pants and boxers down in one swift movement before grabbing him by the hips and hoisting him up onto the piano.
Sam laughed as Castiel caught Dean before he hit the floor. “Let him sleep it off Cas,” he said with amusement, “we can deal with the typical Dean Winchester freak-out when he wakes up.” Cas just nodded, picked Dean up as if he were a rag doll, and flew them to their room to let him do just that.
Dean thought splitting up was a good idea. If they were together then whatever this thing was could possibly make them do more bullshit. He didn't want to even think about what he did with Sam. It was just so
A familiar riff came over the speakers.
Gabriel and Sam sat shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, at the top of the Golden Gate Bridge watching the sun set. The wind at that height whipped at them, blowing their hair out of their faces and stinging their cheeks. Gabriel could have protected them from the wind, but he and Sam agreed it felt refreshing, almost cleansing after everything they had gone through.
The strange tableau continued as hands scrabbled for purchase and orgasms were chased. Dean and Gabriel's hands twined on Castiel's hips while Sam reached over Gabriel's arms to pull at Cas' wings. When the first feather came out, Cas locked up and howled, shooting come down Dean's throats and his ass clamping down on Gabriel's cock. That started the chain reaction, the pressure pulling Gabriel's orgasm from him and his ass setting off Sam's. Dean fairly gagged with the
First Chair. You two can fight over the solos, or however you wanna figure it out. Tran, you’re finally second chair, congratulations.” With that, Rufus turned and left the hall.
Crowley walked back to the booth, cocking his head to one side as he sensed what she was. "A Nephilim with Dean Winchester's phone. Does he know?"
“Dean, stop,” he said, looking a little breathless. “It’s Sam.”
* * * * *
"In the flesh!" He swung his arms wide with a flourish.
“It’s an amazing movie,” Sam insisted. “It’s a World War II movie set in Germany, about two boys as close as brothers who are rebelling against Hitler’s Germany and the Nazis using American music and dancing.”
thought was just nonsense baby talk, but then Sammy started babbling right back like they were having a conversation. Gabriel held Sammy up against his shoulder and ran a couple fingers down his back and Sammy let out a surprised “ah!” Castiel and Gabriel just stared.
"Brilliant," he said, standing, "then we have a deal?"
, Sammy,” Gabriel whined. “This will get you out of your funk, I promise.”
"Deanna," she replied, almost leaning into Gabriel. "I'm the one who's been tweeting you guys about coming to my birthday party tonight. How'd you guys get my home address? I only mentioned where the party was gonna be."
* * * * *
Their order number was called and Cas retrieved their food. When Dean took the first bite of his burger, his eyes rolled back in his head and he made the most pornographic noises Cas had ever heard. As he watched Dean's Adam's apple bob as he swallowed and his tongue swipe across his cupid bow lips to catch any stray juices, Cas could feel his blood rush to his groin.
Cas took his hand to comfort him. “We’ll speak to our brothers when we return to the bunker. They may have acquired information in our absence that will assist us in making a decision.”
Dean wasn’t surprised that Cas was jumpy, the way he ran from the room. He’d only wanted to see how the guy reacted to being flirted with, not scare him half to death. He just hadn’t expected him to spill his popcorn everywhere. He chuckled as he bent down to help Cas pick it up, dumping the spilled popcorn into the trash rather than back into the bowl.
“Mary Jo,” Lucifer said, standing up, “how nice to see you again. And you come bearing gifts!”
"Sonofabitch!" Dean yelled, kicking a chair across the room.
“Depends, what are you in the mood for? I was just thinking of ordering pizza or something.” Dean really should have put some thought into this before saying anything, because now he felt a little underwhelming.
"I, uh, yeah, I kinda do," Sam admitted quietly. He tipped his head back and let Gabriel continue playing with his hair. The archangel kept running his fingers through his hair, intermittently pulling at it and scraping his short nails along his scalp. It was a sensuous feeling, one that Sam had always loved but hadn't had the opportunity to indulge in for years. One particularly vicious tug had him whining and his dick starting to harden again, despite his earlier activities. The best things about whatever this is were the short refraction period and the libido of a teenager, Sam thought.
Lucifer let out a full belly laugh, startling MJ. When he was able to catch his breath, he wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. “Oh, Gabriel didn’t know old Samy like I did. Bastard was always full of pride and self-righteousness.” He leaned out through the bars of the cage, crooking his finger at MJ as if he had the best secret in the world he was dying to share. She stepped forward cautiously, and he whispered “Nineveh.”
“Whoa, you okay Cassie?” Gabriel asked, hugging Castiel back just as tightly.
Dean was shocked. Did he and Cas have so little restraint in the future that they would have sex anywhere in the bunker, even with the kids around? He flushed ten shades of red and MJ could tell what he was thinking.
,” Gabriel whined.
Chuck say ‘everything happened for a reason’ when they had lost a child. There was no reason behind the Thule’s violence and how they butchered Gabriel.
"Is there anything we could do to help?" Sam offered. "We could straighten out some of the feathers, or... groom you?.. I guess?"
off."
As the song ended, the men stood close to each other, the angels holding their humans’ hands. They stood before their Father unashamed of the bonds they had forged with each other and the new family they created for themselves away from Heaven. Chuck could feel the love rolling off of them and couldn’t be prouder of his creations. He took Gabriel and Sam’s left hands in his and held them in his hands until their rings glowed briefly. He did the same for Castiel and Dean, telling them all, “you did good, boys.”
“Dean,” he sighed, “perhaps we can discuss this turn of events.”
"But why come to me?" he asked suspiciously.
Without preamble, Sam grabbed Cas and pushed him face-first against the shower wall under one of the shower heads. One hand started working the goop out of Cas' wings, while his other hand slipped between his cheeks to start working his ass open. "Gabe," Sam said, warning tone in his voice, "we're gonna need lube." Another snap and there was a convenient dispenser on the wall. Sam gave a feral grin and said, "that's staying when this is all over." He pumped a few dollops into his hand, smeared it across his fingers, and pushed two fingers deeply into Cas, making the angel moan.
“It’s entirely possible,” Cas responded, equally as quiet.
“Not in the slightest,” he said with a grin on his face.
Half-angel kids coming back from the future definitely qualified as trouble.
Sam loved waking up next to Gabriel. He had never thought he would enjoy being with another man, but Gabriel practically worshiped him in bed. Every kiss, every touch was both passionate and reverent. Mornings were no exception, more often than not waking up to Gabriel's hands mapping out every square inch of his oversized body like he was trying to memorize it.
sex. And sometimes your kids walk in on you. It’s disturbing,” she said, rolling her eyes at them both.
Dean smiled at that as he looked around the bunker. Sam and Gabriel had repaired all the damage that the angels had done to the door and it looked better than before. He nodded in approval at all the work they put into it. “Great job you guys,” he said to his brother and Gabriel, seeing them slink in from the garage. “Did you accomplish anything else while we were gone?” he joked.
“I’ve missed you,” she whispered in his ear, knowing it wasn’t her Kevin but not really caring. Her Kevin knew her, knew her stories, knew her body and how she liked to be kissed and touched. This wasn’t him yet; this Kevin wasn’t confident and cocksure and knew almost nothing about her. She rested her head on his shoulder and sighed.
Jody grinned at that. "Awwww, I love those knuckleheads, too. We'll definitely have to catch up."
Sam wanted to punch something, mainly his brother. He knew his brother could be an idiot and go off half-cocked when he got something into his head, but he just couldn't believe Dean would do something like this without running it by him first. Next time he saw his brother,
Dean watched with his hand wrapped around his dick. He felt as though he were touch-starved and crawling out of his skin. If he didn't fit himself in there somewhere he was gonna die, figuratively and literally. With a little maneuvering, he pressed himself up against the wall by Cas and slid down, getting on his knees between the angel and the wall. It took him a minute to get Cas' dick in his mouth, considering the force of both Gabriel's and Sam's thrusts, and when he finally managed it he was seeing stars from his head hitting the wall. Castiel reached down with one hand to cup Dean's head to prevent further injury.
Sam came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist. “Whatcha got there?” he asked.
Gabriel made a face. “Loved that woman to death, Sammich, but I’m not too keen on the name. Besides, we can’t keep naming our kids after people you guys knew. I know you wanna honor them, but let’s give our kids their own legacy to follow, ‘kay?”
This time when Sam looked, Gabriel's dick was much bigger, fattened up so that it barely fit in Gabriel's palm.
"Very nicely done," Gabriel said, sliding into the seat Crowley just vacated, "have you ever thought about a career in law?" He crossed his arms over her chest and quirked an eyebrow at her, the look MJ knew meant she was in really deep shit.
Mary had taken Bobby out for his birthday that afternoon before the party. They stopped for coffee (for her) and hot chocolate (for him) before heading to a local gun range. She spent a couple hours helping him with his stance, his aim, quick reloading, and shooting while moving. It was a lot of fun for both of them, and by the time they were done they were both laughing and swapping hunting stories.
“Yeah, same, Cas.” Dean wanted to hug Cas or something, but it felt awkward with his brother standing right there. The two men just kinda stood there looking at their shoes before Cas shuffled out the door.
Without warning, a certain archangel appeared right in front of Sam.
“Cas isn’t gonna kill you, either. No one’s gonna kill you. I swear. Just get your ass down here, okay?” Still no response. “Goddammit Kevin! This is important! MJ is hurting and crying and I can’t deal with that shit.”
,” she said, giving them her best ‘don’t mess with me, I’m the adult’ look.
Sam replied with “impromptu skydiving.”
Dean poured himself another cup of coffee and sat next to his brother in silence.
him! But he was doing…
“Ah!” Gabriel interrupted. “Just Cas.”
’ and followed them.
Once the veggies and fries were done, Cas went to work carefully cooking the bacon, making sure the grease didn’t splatter Dean’s hands, which were flipping the burgers ever few minutes. “Dean,” he admonished, “you need to let them cook all the way through, they won’t if you keep removing them from the heat like that.”
"Oh Lord," she replied, rolling her eyes, "what are you boys up to now?"
“I think they’re our kids, Dean,” Sam told him, getting a nod from Bobby in confirmation.
Dean was getting antsy. He didn’t like everything so quiet, feeling like it meant something was gearing up to explode in their faces. Everyone gave him a wide berth, not wanting to trigger his temper. He paced around the bunker holding baby Sammy and
“Come on, boys,” Mary said, “we could all use some rest.” She grabbed her own duffel from the trunk and headed inside. Sam and Dean followed suit, their angels under their arms.
Cas smiled. He knew how much Dean loved their baby, and if their little angel wanted to spend time with Sam instead of Dean, then of course the man would be irritated. He held his hand out to Dean, and once on his feet Cas flew them out of the bunker.
“Oh yeah! Love me some classic rock!” Dean pulled his wallet out and sifted through it for the cash to pay for their meals. He waited until Cas had a mouthful of food before he put the money down, anticipating an argument. When Cas went to pull his own wallet out, Dean just glared at hi.
Gabriel screamed. He ran towards Sam, blade in outstretched hand, taking Turel's head off. As Dean and Cas continued to fight off the other angels, Gabriel pulled the sword from Sam's bleeding chest and ripped his shirt open, chanting "no, no, no, no" as he placed his hand over Sam's heart, trying to heal the wound.
Just then, Kevin appeared there in the library in front of them, startling Dean and Sam. He wasn’t wearing his usual jeans, tee shirt, and zip-up sweater, but a pair of slacks and a button-up dress shirt. Kevin also seemed surprised that the men where there and shifted from one foot to the other.
The woman turned on Sam and started in on him. "And leaving Gen at home with two rambunctious toddlers when she's six months pregnant? Not cool, dude." This time Sam started stammering, but couldn't get anything out. Dean smirked and said, "still with fake Ruby?" The woman laughed at that comment. "So we're going
“Oh my god, Cas, his wings are gorgeous,” he said, love for his son evident in his voice.
This time, Dean’s eyes went wide with fear. He turned to MJ and grabbed her shoulders. “Go shower and change right now, before it touches your skin,” he demanded. As he started pushing her towards the hallway, Castiel stopped him.
“Atta girl!” he said with a big smile and a pat to her arm.
"Can you take one more, angel?"
“Fuck you, Gabriel,” he snarled. “Cas is a stuck-up rich boy with entitlement issues. He wasn’t good enough to get First Chair on his own, so he decided to fuck with me instead.”
"That’s fine, Dean," he replied. "Would you like my company this evening?"
Dean shuddered at the thought, wondering how in the hell the conversation with his little brother ended up here. “Look man, I don’t wanna know what you two get up to behind closed doors,” Dean told him, “just be careful with the grace thing, okay? Not to throw shit in your face, but in our family, we tend to have addictive personalities. You’ve been down that road before, and I hate seeing it. So take care of yourself, okay?”
"I honestly don't know. He's human, it might not affect him the same way," he told her, taking Cas in his arms.
Dean blinked. Actually, he didn’t. They’d spent a lot of time talking about books and music and his mom and Sammy, but he honestly couldn’t remember Cas talking much about himself or his family. “Shit,” he cursed under his breath.
“How about we just agree to disagree on this, okay?” Dean said, pinching the bridge of his nose. He was quickly losing patience with Cas and was wondering if any of this would be worth it in the end.
They each picked up a couple of the heavy boxes, and Bobby precariously balanced the ones he was holding while he linked arms with MJ. They’d found she was immune to angel powers, as well as demonic powers and spells, but thankfully flying by ‘Angel Air’ was something she could still do, probably due to the fact it wasn’t a power and more a natural thing for angels, considering they used their wings. With a thought, they were gone.
“Hey, Sammich, how goes the war?” he asked playfully. He snapped a plate of fresh fruit out of the air, placed it on the table, and slid it over to Sam.
“Well, color me lucky. I’d get to keep my new favorite Winchester.” Lucifer looked smug with that little tidbit. “Cassie and Gabe are two of the few angels I know of that can handle the time-travel thing, but if you’re immune to angel powers too, I don’t know if even they could get you back. Might require divine intervention.”
Dean took the chair next to Crowley, turning it around before sitting on it backwards with his arms leaning on the backrest. “We need to get to the cage. MJ trapped Lucifer in there, but got stuck right along with him,” Dean explained.
Dean's head shot up, his eyes meeting Cas'. "Yeah?" He asked with a cocky grin.
“What’s coming?” Sam asked, studying the sigils the girl was making.
“I feel the same way,” Castiel responded. “But I am looking forward to doing things in the correct order. I was
"If you're gonna kill me, then at least be original," Dean snapped, hunting through the cabinets for the hard liquor.
“Humans, definitely,” she replied. “The pagan gods are psychological constructs to anthropomorphize human emotions, needs, and wants. For example, when a tree provides shelter and food, it’s easier for a human to say thanks to a god for providing the tree rather than thanking the tree itself. They created each of the pagan gods in their minds to thank someone for what they had and to ask for things they needed or wanted.”
Gabriel yanked his sword from Samyaza’s body. He waited for him to fall, to explode, to die. But he didn’t. Samyza turned around, black ichor oozing from what should have been a fatal wound, a wound that would have killed any mortal or angel. Once again, Samyaza charged at Gabriel, this time much slower. And once again, Gabriel spun to one side to allow the other to rush past him. This time he brought his sword up to shoulder level, letting the blade follow its path through Samyaza’s neck, his head dropping to the ground.
?" the Dean in the doorway yelled, pointing at the Dean holding Cas' hand.
When Dean and Castiel emerged from Dean’s room, they saw Sam heading into his own room with a fire extinguisher. They heard it discharge, and then Sam came out again, dragging Gabriel behind him. “Hey Deano, Cassie,” Gabriel waved at them as he was being pulled towards the war room. Cas and Dean just looked at each other like ‘
As Cas fell forward into Dean's arms, Dean slipped out of his body. Sam watched as a thin trickle of come leaked from Cas' ass. Removing one hand from Cas' wings, he reached forward and traced his rim before pushing the come back inside, causing a chain reaction of first Cas to shudder against Dean, and then Dean to shudder. Fascinated with the reaction, he continued tracing the puffy ring of muscle with his finger, occasionally dipping in, until Cas was squirming against Dean and whimpering.
Trigger Warning: Again, non-con if that's your perception (because of the compulsion); however, the boys really don't have a problem with it at this point.
“CNN reports Sargent Rose Williams, stationed at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, was killed in a firefight just east of Sadda, Pakistan. Her platoon leader said they were ambushed and she was shot from the back of their truck. Since they were under heavy fire they couldn’t stop to get her, or he and the other thirteen members of the platoon would be at risk.” Sam shook his head. “She must have still been alive, and the insurgents did…
Sam groaned, all of a sudden feeling so tired he couldn’t move, and passed out where he lay.
“Oh, for-” Dean shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. “I wasn’t gonna
Getting Cas to happily agree to playing with him for the benefit seemed like a big step forward to Dean. He was getting more and more of those small smiles from Cas, but he’d yet to get another one of those heart-stopping, wide gummy smiles of his. Dean had a plan for that, though.
"So what does this mean for Bobby?" Mary asked. "Does this make him more or less likely to be an ideal vessel for Lucifer?"
"Yeah, she is," he beamed. "It's like an Asian parent's wet dream," he joked, and everyone laughed.
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Handing the photos back to Gabriel, he said, “take your spank bank material back to the room. You’re gonna need it while we’re gone.”
Sam laughed and told Gabriel, “you’re a ham, you know that?”
“Eighteen,” she sniffed.
“There’s always a chance Deano. We could change one thing now and it will change how our future selves will act. For all we know, the kids coming back could have already changed everything, for better or worse. It’s a chance they were willing to take to take care of the people they love. Sound familiar?” Gabriel arched an eyebrow at him.
"What's done is done," Gabriel said, snapping his fingers. Dean's phone appeared in his hand from MJ's pocket. "Now we figure out how to cage Lucifer if or when Crowley provides us with any leads."
* * * * *
* * * * *
Sam could see the changes in his angel, going from a carefree Trickster to solemn and serious. He hated feeling Gabriel’s guilt and self-blame through their bond, no matter how hard he tried to hide it. Gabriel would sit quietly and sift through his thoughts almost constantly, though what he was thinking Sam could only speculate. After all, he had gone through his share of bullshit, guilt, and self-blame, too.
As Dean's breathing returned to normal, Cas tapped his forehead again, and Dean was grateful to feel the sticky messes between them disappear. And in true Dean Winchester fashion, this is where the guilt settled in.
Cas gave him a gentle squeeze and said, “I’m sure you will tomorrow.”
"Hey Cas?" Sam started, but Cas was already examining Sam's flaccid dick, head tilted to one side. When he looked back up, Cas was staring at Sam's dick with a look of confused concern on his face. "I fail to see how
“Anyways, shall we get down to business, or are we waiting on the Nephilim?” she asked politely.
Dean stopped pacing long enough to glare at Cas, to decide if he should slam the door in his face, then continued pacing when he realized the angel would just mojo himself into the room anyways. He was not a talker. He did not want to talk about this, the fact that supposedly he and Cas became angel-married sometime in the future and had a daughter together. Sometime in the near future, if the kids were from twenty years in the future and his daughter-their daughter-was 18.
“We will do everything in our power to assist you,” Cas whispered into her hair. “And even some things beyond our power. We will not allow you to suffer this injustice any longer.”
Sam searched the table and the floor underneath, but didn't find it. He looked at Gabriel, fear painting his face. "You don't think MJ-"
"Cas, talk to me," Dean said, adjusting his grip so he was now holding Cas' hand. "Are you jealous of Sam and Gabriel?" Cas averted his eyes and the gears started turning in Dean's head.
Chuck put his hands on Bobby’s shoulders and looked him in the eyes, a little sadness bleeding through. “This isn’t the only rock in the universe, kid,” he said with a sigh. “I only found out about you guys being here a few weeks ago, and as soon as I did I came back. I stopped that spell from working to send you guys back to your time to give myself time to learn what happened and see what kind of people you guys would grow up to be. I’m sorry about how much you and your family suffered, but you gotta remember that everything happens for a reason.”
"Heya, Cas," Dean said with a smile. "How're you holding up?"
“Hey, Samsquatch,” Gabriel says cautiously, “whatcha need?”
In which Dean is a dick, Gabriel is an asshole, and everyone is satisfied in the end.
practically glued his eyes shut. He reached up and put one finger to his lips for the men to be quiet before he proceeded to rub his eyes.
was his favorite Roger Moore/James Bond movie. Of course Sean Connery was the best of the Bonds, but the others weren’t too bad. He handed the sheet back to Sam and asked, “can we try it out?”
“Just got shit on my mind, okay?” he replied defensively.
Castiel reached up and removed Dean's hand from his dick. "Just relax, Dean," he said sweetly, "this is for you. Pay attention." Dean just nodded and let Cas continue. Putting a dollop of lube on his fingers, Cas' other hand reached back even further, parting Dean's cheeks and lightly touching his hole. The action made Dean shiver in both apprehension and anticipation. Cas slowly massaged the furled muscle, relaxing Dean. It wasn't an unpleasant feeling, and soon he was pushing into the touch.
“Kevin, go check on the others,” she said, turning to him. “We’ve got Dad, make sure no one else gets hurt, okay?” Kevin leaned down, kissed her on top of her head, and vanished. When MJ looked back at her dad, the wound was healed and his eyes were
That provoked another thought in Castiel’s mind. In all of the research he had done, he had found many stories, many sexual deviances, which reminded him much of what Dean had done under Alistair’s tutelage in Hell. Could it be possible that such torture could be turned around, twisted, so that the opposite effect is achieved? That such precision and patience could bring a more delicious torture? He knew he could trust Dean in this, but could Dean trust himself? It was a notion worth exploring.
” Dean asked indignantly. “You feel sorrow? What the fuck Cas? What the actual
"I think it stopped making us do shit a while ago," Sam muttered.
he felt good and didn't they deserve that? Grabbing the lube from his nightstand, he went back to Cas' room.
“God,” Dean said breathlessly, “been wanting to know how you taste for weeks.”
"What have you boys been getting yourselves into?"
When yet another door wouldn’t open, she turned to see Dean fighting off one of the Grigori. Torn between helping her dad and getting Sammy to safety, Dean made the choice for her by turning his head to one side and yelling “run!” So she did, wrapping both arms around Sammy and taking off at top speed. Sammy shrieked when he saw they were moving away from Dean and instantly flew them back, behind the Grigori.
“And if there isn’t?” MJ countered, as stubborn as her dad. Dean grumbled something about his “little girl” and MJ wrapped her arms around him. “We’ll figure this out. I promise.” Dean hugged her back tightly.
“His wings are beautiful Dean,” Cas said softly, smiling at his son. He looked up at Dean and gave him that radiant smile Dean rarely saw.
“Hey Dad,” Bobby yelled, running into the room with a tablet in his hand. “Why did Uncle Dean think this was witches?”
Gabriel gasped in mock horror. “I would never ask you to pick a favorite, especially since I know it’s no contest.” Bobby laughed at that. Typical Pops.
“Because my angel isn’t a dumbass?” Dean retorted with a smirk.
“So you had no one outside the family? No one your age, or anyone our age we might have brought home?” Dean pushed.
“Hey, Papa,” MJ said, “can I see your angel blade a sec?” She really hoped this went the way she thought it would. Cas just tilted his head at her for a moment before flipping it in his hand and handing it to her. Once in her hand, she walked over to her dad and drug the blade over the arm not holding Sammy, causing a thin line of blood to surface.
Kitchen cleaned, Dean grabbed himself and Cas another beer and they headed to the TV room. He decided to play it safe tonight with
“OK Sammich, let’s try a little experiment, shall we?” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows at him.
Gabriel hugged MJ tightly. “You know what I think?” he asked her, releasing her so that he could look her in the eye. “I think you’re a lot like Dad wanted us to be; kind, loving, and forgiving, even in the face of hate and evil. You keep trying, and that matters. But what do I know?” he laughed. “I’m just the crazy uncle.”
Dean snapped his hips up in rhythm with Cas’, meeting him thrust for thrust, each one harder than the next. He could feel his orgasm coiling up inside him, ready to break free. “I’m close, Cas,” he panted in his lover’s ear. “C’mon angel, harder!” Cas picked up the force and tempo of his thrusts, making Dean cry out a litany of “YESYESYESYES-
"Dude,
* * * * *
“Okay, what do you want me to do?” Sam asked, resigned.
*  *  *  *  *
"Nah, I'm good," Bobby grinned. "I've seen all the movies a million times. Episode IX is my favorite."
* * * * *
“That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it Sammich?” Gabriel asked, poking Sam in the chest. He went back to Castiel and placed a hand on Sammy’s back, rubbing in small circles. Sammy liked that and laid his head on Cas’ shoulder, so Gabriel kept doing it as he continued talking. “It feels like it’s all grace, but it’s got a different texture. It’s also warmer. Like I said, we’re breaking all the rules in the book with our kids, I think we’re gonna just have to wait and see.”
“Hello to you too, sunshine,” he heard. When he looked up, Gabe and Sammy were sitting at the kitchen table, papers covering most of the surface, staring at him with matching bitchfaces. “What’s got your panties in a twist?” Gabe asked. “Someone not getting enough lovin’ from my cousin?”
"'Kay, Cas," Dean said breathlessly, "time to make a break for it."
It was gonna be a fun day.
"Sam? Dean?" She asked, looking at them, their responses were all wide smiles and nods.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Eileen, for one," Bobby offered immediately. "She's awesome, and she was nuts over the library."
"Nope," Dean replied a little too casually, a slight flush creeping up his neck, "smooth sailing. Any of that worth anything?" he asked, pointing to the pictures.
“Nothing,” the Scribe replied, twisting his hands together and looking at the ceiling.
Dean’s heart dropped into his stomach.
"Sam?"
* * * * *
Dean picked up his cello case and left without a word, leaving the twenty on Cas’ music stand.
Now Dean was curious-what the hell could anyone associate with
Dean pulled his head back to look at Cas, then gave him a wicked grin. “Well, in that case,” he said with a wink. He gripped Cas’ pants and boxers at the waist and pulled them down to his knees, then turned him around and pushed his shoulders onto the bed. Dean pushed the back of his shirt up, leaning over to line his spine with kisses as one hand trailed down to tease his puckered hole. Castiel keened, pushing back to get more friction.
Throwing in a minor non-con warning, because sex pollen/fuck-or-die, and the reader's perception of compulsion. Otherwise, enjoy the shenanigans!
“Dunno,” Gabriel said with a shrug. “Neither do the kids. We’ve already done so much that will affect their timeline that even they don’t know what to expect anymore.” Gabriel yawned, burying his head in Sam’s chest. “And we still have so much to do if we’re gonna make things right for them.”
Dean laughed at that. “I’ve been hunting with my dad and Sammy since forever, and even with Dad gone I can’t imagine not hunting with my brother.” He thought for a minute before asking, “how does that work, anyways? Me and Cas hunting together? I mean, do we work well together?”
Crowley met with the men in the warehouse again, this time a longer table was present to give them all room to sit and go over the contract together. Gabriel was going over the contract with a yellow highlighter and a red pen, making small changes here and there and calling Crowley out on them.
“Family, kinda,” he said, resting his elbows on the guitar and facing the man. “They were disappointed when, ah… one of my projects… didn’t turn out the way it was supposed to. I know I didn’t screw it up, but I still feel like I let them down.”
"So," Dean said, clearing his throat, "you been wanting that for a while?"
Cas had a point, it’s why Dean couldn’t stand the
Before Gabriel could answer, the whole house started shaking. Gabriel looked out the window then yelled for Dean to get to the others. Dean grabbed his duffel and ran back to the room, Gabriel on his heels.
“Did we do this?” Dean whispered to Cas, not wanting to wake MJ up.
*  *  *  *  *
“She’s legally an adult, she has that right!”
“Hey, Uncle Luci,” she replied with a smile. “Sorry I didn’t come sooner, lots going on.”
“Dean Winchester,” Lady Toni said, disappointment lacing her voice. “Here I thought you and your family agreed to stay under the radar. Now I’m hearing all this rubbish about you and your brother bonding with angels, Nephilim roaming around with the Winchester name, and that you’ve signed a contract with the King of Hell himself. Whatever am I going to do with you?”
Still red-faced, Sam slid the ring onto Gabriel’s hand, then kissed him one more time. As they looked into each other’s eyes, Gabriel smirked and snapped his fingers again, music starting. He put one hand on Sam’s waist and took his other hand. Dancing was sort of becoming their thing, and Sam couldn’t find it in himself to complain. They started a slow boxstep as the singer’s voice started.
Dean spluttered at that, but Castiel just laid a hand on his arm and said, “it’s alright Dean.” Dean looked at him with shock, then went back to drinking his beer sullenly.
. Entertain me.” Gabriel had a serious case of cabin fever. He was used to being able to go wherever, do whatever, whenever he wanted. Not being able to actively use his grace on top of not being allowed to leave the bunker was making him a serious pain in the ass.
"Sheriff Mills speaking," Jody answered her cell phone from behind her desk at the Sioux Falls Sheriff Department.
“So, what? He overdosed on grace?” Dean was just starting to wrap his head around this whole thing. Angry now, he turned on Gabriel. “You didn’t think he’d become addicted to the high of your grace? That as long as Sam liked it, everything would be ‘happily ever after’?” He turned to Cas. “How much worse is a grace high than a demon blood high?”
When Sam saw what he was holding in his hand, he stopped laughing. “That Samyaza?”
And then there was Cas. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get the image of the angel on his knees out of his head; his chapped lips stretched obscenely around his dick, sky blue eyes glassy and framed by full, dark lashes. And then there was the hair. Dean hadn't grabbed Cas' hair, didn't touch a single strand, but when he stood up his hair looked liked he had just been thoroughly fucked. Did it always look like that?
“Erk!” Sammy said with a laugh, Sam and Gabriel laughing right along with him. Dean just scowled and left the room, muttering something under his breath about how he should be Sammy’s favorite.
“Dean, wait,” Charlie said again, grabbing his shoulder, but he just shrugged it off.
Lucifer took another step towards MJ, putting a hand on her shoulder. “You’re not so bad, kid. Come visit me sometime, will ya?”
“Nothing personal, bro,” Gabriel said, “just looking out for our kids. You understand, don’t you?” He batted his eyelashes at Lucifer before rolling his eyes at him. “See, here’s the thing, you’re just too pissed off at Dad to really do anything with yourself. All you’re gonna do is cause trouble, and we just can’t have that. Sammich?” Gabriel said, looking at his hunter.
MJ sighed and pulled her dad’s phone out of her purse. Checking the text messages, there was one from her Uncle Gabe saying “Date’s over, time to head home”. She showed it to Kevin with a sad smile and he just chuckled. He knew Gabriel had tagged along invisibly to make sure MJ would be safe. He was a cool uncle, but apparently not
they sent the kids back to their own time. Nodding his head and grabbing both MJ and Bobby, they beat a hasty retreat out of the bunker, saying something about seeing a movie. Dean reminded Cas that Kevin and MJ had Bobby to disrupt anything they might get up to, calming his angel down slightly.
Mary paid no heed to this, a small smile on her own lips, but Sam, MJ, and Bobby looked up when they heard Gabriel curse. “What’s up, Pops?” Bobby asked. They looked between Gabriel and Cas, but couldn’t discern what was going on.
“Nope, I mean you. Deano may have his charms, but you were always my favorite Winchester,” Gabriel smiled.
what that was,” Gabriel said, smacking Sam in the shoulder, “Dean-o was throwing a temper tantrum! Now why would he do that?” he asked Castiel.
Castiel shook his head. “Unlikely. I’m still considered persona non grata and knowledge of Gabriel’s return isn’t widespread as of yet. I’m hesitant to ask Kevin for assistance for many reasons, but if Joshua can convince him to work with us in the planning
"An angel imprisoning sigil, Dad?" MJ rolled her eyes. "Really? Those don't work on Nephilim."
Dean didn’t want to get up, but figured he’d better before Sammy decided to just bring the sheet music to his room and camp out on his bed. When his kid brother got excited about something, it consumed him. Usually it was infectious, but all Dean wanted to do was lay there and think about Cas.
MJ smiled, knowing she snagged his attention. "I'll introduce myself at the Biggerson's in Lebanon, Kansas in, say, a half an hour?"
Castiel bristled at that. He was not fond of this woman at all, and sharing any information with her seemed a betrayal of trust. Dean must have sensed this because the hand resting on Cas’ hip came up to stroke him up and down his spine, trying to relax him.
Cas leaned his forehead against Dean’s. “That will not be an issue,” Cas panted. “Gabriel took the liberty of soundproofing our room as he did for his and Sam’s. While we can hear everything outside the room, no one can hear what is going on inside.”
“Thanks Cas,” Dean smiled at him. “Wasn’t as bad as we thought it would be, just a wendigo. Some Trekkie thought it might have actually been a Klingon.” Dean laughed. “Wrong Broken Bow. We caught it sleeping and were able to take it down and burn the
“Yeah,” Claire said, “you think he was bad in 2017, you should have seen him when he first came to Earth. He didn’t know anything about human culture, didn’t get metaphors or pop culture, and was confused by most things humans did. It was both annoying and adorable.”
They were finally able to hunt down Aaron Bass and his newly resurrected Judah Initiative. While they didn’t have the resources their predecessors did, they offered everything they had to assist the Winchester family in their search.
"I had to do something, man, you know that. When I found out Cas was pregnant, I couldn't just leave him."
“And,” Dean said, stealing a fry off Cas’ plate and pointing at him with it, “you don’t have to look up the song on YouTube when you get home. I’ve got it on tape out in my car.” He popped the fry in his mouth and grinned as he chewed.
“For defending my honor against my mother,” Castiel replied, and Dean laughed. Castiel kissed him again, asking, “Now will you take me home and show me how much you love me?”
Cas tilted his head and thought for a moment. “It may be possible,” he said, “but the chances of it working are not good. Gabriel would have to be conscious to hear you, and without access to his grace he may not be able to respond. But if anyone were able to do it, I believe you and Gabriel would be able to.”
as much knowledge as they have. They still won’t tell us jack shit.”
“He gets his brains from me, you know,” Gabriel said, nudging Sam in the side with his elbow and winking at him. Sam laughed, “he got his brains from me, he got his deviousness from you.”
“Hello Dean, Sam,” Cas said, addressing Dean more than Sam. “I’m glad you have both made it back safely.”
Anane laughed. "It's only fitting, brother," he told Danel, "that we destroy his child as he destroyed ours."
Dean, Sam, and Castiel were standing in Stull Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas, the site of the aborted Apocalypse. They were all agitated, waiting for Gabriel and the kids to arrive with Lucifer, if they could. They’d barely been there for half an hour when the four of them arrived right in the middle of the large angel trap they’d spray painted on the ground.
Cas just grinned. “Deal.”
“There were no demonic omens, no reports of sulfur smells or black eyes to go with the behavior, so we ruled out demons. No other monsters we’ve dealt with could do something like this to people. Leviathans are still in purgatory, no reason to think they’ve escaped and started mind-controlling people with food again. And angels may be dicks most of the time, but they couldn’t do something like this without possessing someone, and they’d need consent to do that. Besides, this just seems like a witchy thing. Why?”
The tip of one of Cas' fingers gently pushed into Dean's ass, startling the man. The angel just shushed him and kissed him to distraction. Dean focused on Cas' mouth rather than his finger and felt himself drifting into the touch. The foreign intrusion became less of an annoyance and more of a pleasure as Cas worked his way in to the first knuckle, then the second. By the time he slid the digit all the way in, Dean was panting.
“Crowley,” Dean answered flatly.
“Sorry about that, man,” Dean said, a slight blush tinging his face. “I usually have a little more staying power than that.” He threw the rag onto one of the chairs before extending a hand to Castiel to help him down from the piano.
going to do something foolish, but they prayed to God that it would work.
“I believe it was Doctor Evil who said ‘there really is nothing like a shorn scrotum’,” he said playfully, before bending down and running his tongue over the hairless area. Sam sucked in a breath at the sensation, completely different without the hair there. Gabriel chuckled and continued, using a gentle touch to indicate where the rope would go. “Next I’m going to tie a simple Swiss seat. It’ll go around your hips, around one leg and under, around the other leg and under, and tie off in the front. Rope’s not gonna touch the family jewels, and it’s not gonna split your backside. Is that okay with you?”
“Not much,” Sam said with amusement in his voice. “What’s up with you?”
Alone now and not knowing what to do with himself, he looked around the room he was standing in. There was a fairly new drum kit, and Castiel wondered who got the most use out of it. He saw the cello that Dean regularly used at practice, sitting next to an electric cello. He had never tried one before, never having the desire nor the opportunity, and wondered how it sounded. Then there was the piano. He admired the old Steinway baby grand set up to one side of the room, chuckling at the thought of Sam’s large frame sitting there. Sitting on top was a couple stacks of handwritten sheet music, and Castiel indulged his curiosity by flipping through the pages. He was a fan of Sean Connery as James Bond and had never seen a Bond movie that he wasn’t in, but he knew the theme to
"These boys know there are no more chances," Billie told Gabriel, "and they know they're not going anywhere but the void. Let him go."
Gabriel shook his head. “It’d hit him like it did last time. We both know he’d do it in a heartbeat, but I don’t wanna put that on him.”
“Look Dad, I see what you’re doing, but I can’t tell you much more without messing with your free will. You are free to choose who you want to be with physically even after you and Papa bond, and that’s all I’m gonna say about it. Now can we please drop it?”
“Is your aunt musically inclined as well?” Castiel asked.
Sam and Gabriel just stood there, looking between Dean and each other, trying to figure out what the hell happened.
“Yeah,” Sam said, bouncing the baby on his knee again. “Whatever, jerk.”
"Good to know you've always been nosy," she said dryly. "You shouldn't be looking at that, you know."
When they were done, they tossed their trash and refilled their sodas before heading back out onto the street. Dean stretched and rubbed his belly, then gave Cas a lopsided grin. "Usually after a meal like that I'd feel overstuffed and ready for a nap, but I don't."
“Fair enough. Get some shut-eye boys,” Gabriel winked at them, “tomorrow we start working on giving our kids a better future.”
“Yup, a few days prior to the first incident, there was a craft fair at a local middle school.”
, Dean though again,
“I don’t watch television or movies often,” Castiel replied with a shrug. “I don’t even own a television set.”
“You guys
“Dean,” Cas said, leaning over, “I believe you wanted me to remind you to thank Gabriel.”
“How do you know?” Dean asked her.
She immediately hung up the phone and headed outside. She didn't see the Impala there, but she saw Dean and Sam standing with a small group of people. When she caught Dean's eye, he headed over for a hug, Sam right behind him.
“Daddy,” she said, trying to get his attention, but he wouldn’t look at her. She sighed before continuing. “I know you don’t agree with me,” and at that, Dean snorted, “but I think differently than you do. Can’t we just agree to disagree on this and move on?”
The room fell silent, everyone feeling Gabriel's sorrow that he had been the one ordered to execute the offspring of the Watchers and human women. Sam knew better than most the weight such tremendous guilt could carry. He rose from his seat and approached Gabriel, rubbing circles on his back and offering what comfort he could. Gabriel accepted it, leaning his head on Sam's shoulder.
Cas ran his hands up Dean’s sides, running them up his arms until he had his lover’s hands pinned above his head. As he leaned down to nuzzle behind Dean’s ear, Cas pushed his erection against Dean’s, the fabric between them creating a delicious friction. As his hips sped up a fraction, Cas grasped both of Dean’s wrists in one hand and slid his hand lazily up and down his side. He sucked at the sensitive skin behind Dean’s ear before nipping it playfully, making Dean yelp.
“Shhhhh,” a voice next to him said softly. He turned his head to see his mom. She raised her hand to brush his hair from his face.
… since the children left.”
Gabriel turned around to face the others and they just stared comically at each other before Dean completely lost his shit.
Dean nodded. "What was that? Was that him?"
Chagrined, Dean picked up the photo book and brought it back to MJ, sitting next to her on her bed. "Why not? They're good memories, and they're just vague enough not to tell us too much about our futures. Except the one of you and Kevin kissing," he said sternly. "Kevin's a good kid but I don't think I'll ever be ready for my little girl to be involved with someone."
Gabriel shrugged and returned his smile. “It was normal.” He pulled Sam closer to him, their bare chests touching as they stopped moving their feet but continued swaying to the beat. “I’m an archangel, you hunt monsters. We’re never gonna be ‘normal’, but I’ll do everything I can to give you ‘normal for us’.”
filling the small space.
"The sooner, the better," Dean agreed.
Dean looked at it, and then looked at Cas. “It’s a voice-recording device, like from those stores at the mall where you can build a teddy bear. You record your voice on it and put it inside the bear for whoever you give it to.”
Cas just looked at Dean with his normal stoic expression. “I do not know Dean, but I do find the rhythm pleasing.”
came up for air, he told them all, "Not only are we gonna wanna fuck each other's brains out, if we don't neutralize this shit with each other's love juice, we're all gonna die. YOU. MORON."
“You mean
Dean was warm and comfortable. For a change, he awoke slowly, savoring the heavy feel of his limbs and the fuzziness of his mind. He pulled the blanket up closer to his chin as he tried to slip back into his delicious dreams, but it was a much thicker blanket than he'd had on his bed before. Cracking an eye open, he saw he was holding the top of Castiel's wing, which had been draped over his naked body. He rolled his head to one side to see Cas watching him, and the angel's mouth quirked up at one corner.
As an hour passed, Dean and Sam made good work of Castiel's wings, fixing the ones they could and gently removing the ones Cas said had to go, Cas becoming more and more affectionate throughout the process. When Dean finished with the feathers on his side, the wing looked significantly better and Cas seemed to feel less self-conscious about the appendages. Dean started in on Cas' back where the wing joint was attached, using firm pressure to relieve tension in the muscles there. He wasn't prepared for the pornographic moan that escaped Cas' lips, or the angel suddenly climbing into his lap and wrapping his wings around them.
"Hey, that's okay," Gabriel said with a smile. "Can you show us?"
“Missing everyone,” she replied. “I know we have our dads here, but they’re not
"Totally fucking adorable," Dean told her with a wink.
Gabriel made his way over to Castiel, dragging a very, very tall young man behind him. It didn’t escape him that Dean noticed them as well and looked like he was trying to hold in laughter. When his cousin stopped in front of him he wrapped an arm around the man’s waist and leaned into him.
At the turning point of the song, Cas and Dean squared off against each other, Beethoven versus Zeppelin, old versus new, until they hit the break, both panting heavily. After a four count rest, they came back in together, eyes bouncing between their sheet music and each other. They both grinned wildly, kicking back their chairs to stand as they played through to the end, their entire bodies moving in time with the music and each other.
“Drama much?” Crowley asked, rolling his eyes. “What’s the girl to you anyways, hmm? Is she one of your little tarts? A little piece to tide you over until you come out of the closet? She’s much too young for you, Dean, I thought you were better than that.”
“That I can help you with,” Gabriel said, slapping Sam on the back. He stood up, pacing and moving his hands as he spoke. “Let’s look at it in terms of yours and Dean’s relationship.”
Sam took the chair next to Bobby’s. “Do you want to talk about it?” he asked.
having the reminder there." He winked Castiel and groaned louder as Sam continued his assault.
Tagging for sexual content and family fun (but not at the same time).
"Welp," Gabriel said, sauntering over to a bookshelf, "looks like it's just you and me, Sam-a-lam."
Sam let this roll over a few times in his head. He couldn’t fathom a love that deep or that strong. Gabriel believed that Sam shared a love like that with Dean; that being his only point of reference, he didn’t believe he was capable of loving anyone else like that, not even Gabriel. But obviously he would at some point, because not only would they bond, but have a child together.
“You an’ MJ are cute together. Are you guys gonna get married?” Sam slurred with a shit-eating grin.
Looking at Sam, he said, “well, that was anti-climactic,” causing both Sam and Mary to laugh.
“Where the hell were you?” Sam demanded, arms around his son’s neck. “You scared the hell out of us.”
"I gotcha Sammy," Dean said against Sam's neck, trailing kisses across the soft skin. He let go of Sam's cock long enough to free his own and lined them up, taking both in one hand. Dean knew it was what Sammy needed when he cried out and arched into Dean's touch. Dean's hand moved faster and faster, stripping their dicks as theirs hearts pounded against each other's chests and their lungs burned for more oxygen. Their hips stuttered into Dean's fist as first Sam, then Dean, came in a hot, sticky mess.
"More, Dean," Cas whined, "please."
"Nope," he replied, "and neither can anyone else. Apparently, there's some sort of influx of multidimensional power. Everyone's in a tizzy."
“But he
Dean thought about it for a second, then just nodded. They grabbed their gear and headed inside, glad to be home.
When he saw Dean at rehearsals, he seemed to alternate between cocky arrogance and willful determination. Now that he knew the man outside of that environment, it seemed like all the bravado was for show, that who he was around those he cared about was the real him. He laughed more easily, his smile more sincere and lighting up his eyes like nothing Castiel had seen before. Dean was definitely more open and relaxed, and he thought the look suited the man.
“Okay, first of all,” Dean said, pointing a finger at Sam belligerently, “haven’t we had enough of Nazis? Second, I don’t do musicals, I’m not a chick.” He heard a defiant ‘hey!’ come from MJ, but he didn’t pay any attention to it.
"What do you mean, what am
“Adult activities,” Dean said with a lecherous grin.
"What do those other cultures say about the Watchers themselves?" Sam asked.
“Come on!” Sam growled in frustration. “You always pick the movie. Let me have a chance, will you? Besides, it has Christian Bale in it. You loved him as
“This was a pretty cool idea, Gabe,” Dean said, setting his spatula down and picking up his beer. “Didn’t know you were so current on human traditions.” He picked up another beer and sat down next to Gabriel, handing the archangel the bottle. They clinked bottles and each took a sip.
"But some people have a preference for partners who are proportional?" Cas asked, genuinely curious.
“Dude, you don’t go to the theater for science, you go for the story. Who cares if the science is right or not?”
"Don't act so surprised Dean," Sam said, "you would have pulled the same shit. Best we can hope for now is that she knows what the hell she's doing."
He knocked on Dean’s front door several times, but there was no answer. He checked his watch again to make sure he was there on time, and when he looked up Dean had opened the door, standing there barefoot in jeans, chest and hair wet from a recent shower and his face freshly shaven. Castiel gulped.
“Hey Cas,” Dean said, stumbling back draped over MJ’s shoulder. Castiel ran to his side, cleaning blood from him looking for wounds. “You’re too late, angel,” he laughed tiredly, “Sammy beat ya to it.” He tapped his shoulder where Anane had run him through.
When the last dish was washed, rinsed, and put in the drying rack, Castiel spun Dean around, pulling him close. “Are you done with your chores, Dean?” Cas asked, his voice husky with desire. Dean shivered and nodded. His eyes never leaving his lover’s, Castiel kissed his way down Dean’s body, his fingers deftly undoing the button and zipper of his jeans.
Oh, Sam was so going to regret this… “What do you want me to do Gabriel?”
Sam shoved Dean. “What the hell is wrong with you? Kevin is our friend!”
am I playing
Gabriel just smirked with one hand raised. “I promised her you two would stay in the bunker. I never said I wouldn’t keep an eye on them.” He winked at Sam, snapped his fingers, and he was gone.
Dean let out a choked sob and pulled Cas into his arms. Cas held him like he was the most precious thing in the world as he cried, because yes, Dean was the most precious thing to Cas.
, because at least he & Cas could agree that Sean Connery was the only real James Bond. Movie in, they both just kinda plopped onto the couch, sipping their beers in tandem.
Dean whipped his head around to face Cas. The icy blue eyes that used to weigh and measure him and find him disdainful (to say the least) were now looking at him with sincerity. He honestly didn’t know what to do with that, but he found he liked the look on the man’s face. With a weak smile, he said, “thanks, Cas.” He needed to find another beer, STAT.
Instead of reaching for that third beer, Jody plucked baby Sammy from MJ's arms. God, these boys had literally been to Hell and back, they really deserved some happiness. She never pegged either of the Winchesters as batting for the home team, but seeing them happy with their angels reminded her that love knew no bounds. And their kids? Absolutely amazing. She never thought she'd see the day, but now that she had she would give anything to protect their growing family.
Gabriel, at your service Sheriff," he said with a grin and a goofy bow. He hooked his thumb towards Cas. "That's Castiel, but I'm sure you've heard all about him. I'm much more interesting though." Gabriel waggled his eyebrows at her.
“Oh yeah,” she replied with a wicked grin, “just let me check with her first.”
He still couldn't believe this girl-this
"I believe it's affecting me as well," Cas replied. "I'm unable to move at the moment. Maybe if we act as though we're giving into it, we can break free of it before it takes hold."
Sam laughed at that. He settled his hands on Gabriel’s hips and gave him a quick peck on the mouth. “No.”
* * * * *
Dean stood up and practically slammed the ratchet onto the engine block. “No, we can’t agree to disagree on this,” he said angrily. “I told you before, I don’t want you getting hurt, and hanging out with Lucifer is going to do just that. I want your word that you won’t go see him again, even if you’re stuck…” he trailed off, cluing MJ in to what was
“Oh thank God, you’re back,” Mary said, walking quickly towards Castiel with baby Sammy in her arms. “This little man has been fussy without his Papa’s grace. Gabriel tried, bless his heart, but I don’t think Sammy liked it very much.” Mary handed Sammy off to Cas, who could immediately feel the baby pulling on his grace.
“Gabriel?” Castiel asked the archangel.
Dean looked at Sam expectantly, resolutely ignoring the look of shock on his brother’s face. So what if he let Cas use his mom’s cello? It’s not like he’d never let anyone else play it before. Or touch it. Or even look at it funny. Okay, so maybe this is a first for him. But this was Cas. So maybe the dude didn’t know he was playing his mom’s cello, but he’s played next to the guy for two years and he’s treated his own instrument with nothing but care and respect. It wasn’t like he was gonna trash his mom’s cello for no reason or anything. Besides, how could he
Bobby was still wiped from his time in the cage, feeling both physically and mentally drained, so he spent the past few days lounging on the couch watching Netflix and enjoying ‘classic’ television. Neither Sam nor Gabriel, or anyone else for that matter, wanted to go on a hunt with him here like this, so they decided to take a few rest days. Mary had spread out a blanket on the floor in front of the couch for baby Sammy to lay on, and she, Castiel, and MJ watched him as he rocked from side to side, trying to roll over. They thought it was great fun to say his name and watch him try to turn his head towards the voices he heard.
“I never thought about abilities like that being hereditary, although I guess it makes sense, considering you got my mechanical abilities.”
“You are most definitely a bad influence, Dean Winchester,” the angel replied with a grin, draping his arms over Dean’s shoulders. They smiled against each other’s lips, forehead to forehead.
“OK guys, game time. What’s our play?” Dean asked, looking at his family.
“Pa!” Sammy said gleefully.
“No, assholes blew their way into the bunker a few months back, damned near killed Uncle Sam. As long as Samyaza and his goon squad are still out there, we’re on lockdown.” MJ was in a full sulk now.
“Should I have plans?” he asked, cocking an eyebrow at her.
Dean led Cas to the dark corner of the shopping center parking lot where he parked Baby. He texted the pictures he took to Cas' phone, then emailed them to his brother. He assumed Cas would fly off to wherever he went when he wasn't with the Winchesters, so he was surprised when Cas climbed into the passenger seat, shutting the door behind him and turning to face Dean. Dean sat there, dumbfounded, staring at Cas' hair.
Sam scrambled to his feet, breathless and laughing. “You’re insane!” he yelled at Gabriel.
Cas was just too cute. And damn, homemade burgers. Dean stretched over the counter to reach the radio on the other side of Cas and flipped it on, not missing the way Cas’ nostrils flared and he got another shade pinker. Led Zeppelin played loudly over the small radio, startling Cas and making Dean laugh.
Castiel pulled his hand out of his pocket, hand fisted. “I would like to get your opinion on something.” He opened his hand to show a plain silver band. “I wanted to reciprocate Dean’s gesture. I know he already wears one ring, on his right hand, so I was unsure if he would be willing to wear another.”
is awesome! You’re gonna love it! It’s one of my favorite trilogies, up there with
“I think,” Cas started, then cleared his throat, “I think I should go. Thank you again for this evening, it was very… enjoyable.” He took a few steps back slowly before turning and bolting from the room. Before his brain could come back online, Dean heard the front door close.
Dean sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck. He couldn’t get Cas out of his head. If it were just Cas, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but now he’s gotta think about the fact that Cas is Sam’s boyfriend’s cousin. If shit hits the fan, things were gonna get real awkward, real quick.
“This for the show?” Dean asked.
Dean stood up, figuring if he was part of the ‘remodeling’ he could keep an eye on whatever Gabriel was up to. “What kinda power tools are we talking about?”
After swallowing his mouthful of pie, Dean shook his head and replied, “I don’t think he was an asshole so much as we just didn’t know or understand each other. He’s fun to hang with.”
," Gabriel said, pointing at himself. "
Sam opened his eyes. Gabriel’s face was about an inch away. He wasn’t smirking like Sam thought he would be, gloating over his small victory. Instead, Gabriel’s smile was soft, his eyes kind instead of teasing and
“How else were we to survive?” he asked, anger creeping into his voice. “We were cut off from Father and the rest of the Host. We were slowly becoming mortal. Without our grace, we would not have been able to protect our families. We brought them into this
“What deal?” Dean growled.
She composed herself, smoothing her skirt down. “
“Sammich?”
Cas gave Dean that big, gummy grin that he loved so much, and told him, “I think I love you, too.”
more modern, like anything from the pop charts? People would definitely come to hear music they already know they like.”
," he said, hands waving at Cas' hand on his dick, "if you don't know how big Dean's dick is? You have nothing to compare it to."
“Whatever shall we do with the time?” Cas asked with a lecherous grin. He crawled back up on the bed and onto Dean’s lap, draping his arms over his shoulders.
Dean beamed proudly. “Thanks, Cas.” He gave Castiel a light slap on the shoulder and a smile and headed back to the percussion section to chat with Charlie.
Dean flopped back on the bed with his arm over his eyes and just laughed.
Sam humored him and closed his eyes. For at least a minute, maybe two, nothing happened. Gabriel wasn’t doing anything. He was starting to get antsy, but before he could say anything he felt the soft press of lips against his. Nothing forceful or demanding, just a light touch, their lips the only point of contact. Then his lips moved slightly. Again, not trying to take but testing just a bit; feeling the soft slide, the texture, alternating pressure just a bit. Sam responded in kind, rubbing his lips against Gabriel’s. Before he knew it, Gabriel moved away.
He was happy that Gabriel had found Sam. Sam was a good man-smart, funny, kind-hearted. Gabriel was all of those things as well, but he was flighty. Sam grounded him, and Castiel was pleased with the effect Dean’s brother had on his cousin.
Bobby flew them back to the bunker before MJ could say good-bye.
After a few more minutes of catching their breath, Dean finally rolled off Cas, who touched two fingers to his forehead and cleaned them up.
And if he rearranged his pillows so that he felt like he was being spooned, cuddling into the arms of a green-eyed, freckled man? Well, no one else needed to know, did they?
“And does the love of your life have a name?” Castiel asked, knowing his cousin “fell in love” every other week. The fact that this man held Gabriel’s attention for more than a month surprised him.
"What are you doing here, man?" Kevin asked, and Sam just laughed, smiling like a kid at Christmas.
“Thank you,” Cas said earnestly, to which Dean just nodded. He didn’t know how long they stood there like that, breathing in each other’s breath, but he was lost when Cas licked his lips. Before Dean could stop himself, he was crashing his mouth into Cas’.
“Try me.”
. He was only sixteen and despite having been home-schooled had already graduated the high school curriculum with an A average. He wanted to go to an Ivy League school to study archaeology and history. He played the guitar like it was second nature.
Deanna chuckled at that and replied, "I know someone who might disagree with you."
Sammy blushed like a teenage girl at Cas’ compliment, but Dean was too proud of his brother to crack a joke about it. “Think you guys have time to do a quick practice run?” Sammy asked. Dean was all set, but Cas looked at his watch and frowned.
Cas cocked his head to the side, scrutinizing Dean and his comment. “I was simply too busy to indulge myself. Besides,” Castiel stated, “my ‘people skills’ are ‘rusty’. I spend most of my time at home or work, and I had no desire to ‘hook up’. And I refused to try to find a partner over the internet,” he finished emphatically.
“Okay then,” Sam said, sitting in Gabriel’s favorite wingback chair. “Show me what to do.”
. “I know the bible plays up his skills on the horn, but Pops always preferred string instruments. He’s also a decent percussionist.”
Dean let out a low whistle before looking up at Gabriel. “Dude, I totally owe you one for that,” he said. Gabriel just waved his hand with a ‘psh’ and said, “call it even Deano”, giving the hunter a wink. Dean understood and nodded.
Dean stripped down and stood under the hot spray, letting the water soothe his sore muscles. The hunt wasn't particularly rough, but he slept like shit last night. He wanted to blame it on the crappy sub-standard motel mattress, but he knew it was because Cas wasn't there next to him. He knew he was becoming dependent on his angel for his wellbeing, but the only thing that worried him was that he wasn't worried about it. There was a lot more to this bond thing than he originally assumed. He'd just have to ask Cas about it later. For now, he was going to enjoy a good night's sleep.
Castiel wasn’t surprised when Dean pulled the move he was planning, and he fell into the man’s arms easily. Dean released Castiel’s hand to wrap his arm around his waist, holding him tightly as his other hand snaked into Castiel’s hair. Castiel grabbed two handfuls of Dean’s ass and ground their hips together, making both men groan into each other’s mouths. With more teeth and tongue than lips, they ravaged each other.
Dean dropped, feeling the searing pain of his angel being ripped from this plane of existence, only eclipsed by seeing the archangel crying over his brother's body.
, are we? You're not Jensen, Jared, Misha, and Rich, you're Dean, Sam, Cas, and Gabriel?" They couldn't tell if she was more amused or pissed at this point.
“Dude, not your fault,” Dean told him. “I’m gonna go see if they have any info yet,” he said, hooking a thumb towards the receptionist desk before heading over.
with each other.” Dean sipped at the beer in his hand.  "Honestly, I thought the feeling was just relief that I was okay and everything was gonna be alright.”
“Alright,” she agreed.
think it was stupid to do that in the bunker, in earshot of everyone.” Mary wrapped her arms around her granddaughter and gave her a kiss on the top of her head. She looked over at Kevin and said, “I think it might be best if you took off for a while. I know Dean is your friend, but he’s likely to kill you for this if you don’t give him a chance to calm down.” Kevin nodded, kissed MJ’s cheek, and disappeared.
Well, they would have, if an old mechanic named Jordan hadn’t already blasted them with buckshot and burned the bodies. Jordan wasn’t a hunter and he certainly didn’t believe in werewolves, but he knew there was something not quite right about the wolves spotted around town. Most wolves and coyotes were skittish around humans, but these were bold as brass trotting down the streets like they owned the place. His wife, Pam, had read all of Chuck’s books and tried to convince him there was something supernatural about them. She melted down their good silverware and made shotgun shells for him to keep on him in case those wolves ever came by his shop. Sure enough, the next night they were circling his place, yipping and snarling and throwing their oversized bodies against the doors and windows. He loaded up the silver shells into his twenty-gauge and started picking them off, 6 of them he told Sam and Dean. Then he burned the bodies, like his wife said they did in the books.
, it was
“When you do leave,” he said without a trace of his normal sick and twisted humor, “tell Gabriel to come and visit me. So I’m not so lonely when you’re gone, you know?” His smile was small and sad, and MJ squeezed his hand with a nod.
Downing his beer in a few gulps, he tossed the empty and grabbed a fresh one before heading back into the living room. Charlie and Kevin had joined in on the fundraiser talk now, so there was no way Dean could avoid it. They were all so animated, throwing out ideas and making plans with barely any idea of what it was costing Dean.
Cas nodded with a smile. “Thank you, Sam. I think we would enjoy that.”
Kevin stepped back cautiously, eyeing Bobby. "You're a Nephilim," he said, a little confused. "There aren't supposed to be any on Earth right now."
“Suck it up, Cassie,” Gabriel said, “you said you’d play the benefit, and there’s no backing out. I suggest you get over yourself and give Deano a call, smooth things over.” He pulled out his phone and poked at it a few times, turning it to show Castiel his calendar. “Christmas is coming up in a couple weeks, then we’ll have about five months until the show. Plenty of time for you guys to work out your differences. It’s just the two pieces that Sammy wrote, how hard could it be?” With a huff, Gabriel left.
Dean's confused gaze went from Cas' hands tearing at his jeans to his brother, whose head was thrown back as Gabriel went to town on Sam's cock. Sam was white-knuckling the counter as he tried to keep himself upright.
That made Sam laugh, really laugh. As much as he loved his expanded family, sometimes he missed the times when it was just him and his brother. There were times on the road, between hunts, when they would talk, laugh, cut-up, and just be brothers. He’d have to convince Dean to do this more often.
into the tape deck. When the first tape ended and Dean popped it out, Sam stopped him before he could put the second cassette in.
When the band ended their set, they both clapped until their hands were sore, still grinning like idiots. Cas got the waitress' attention and ordered a couple more beers for them. Before Dean could tell Cas what a great time he was having, the main act came on stage and Dean's jaw dropped when they announced ZZ Top.
"Hey Sheriff," Dean teased. "Can you spare some time to talk to some troublemakers?"
"So what were you saying earlier about a birthday party?" Gabriel asked her softly as her breathing evened out and she started dozing.
"And what would you know about skill, Cassie?
Sam smiled at her. “Thanks, but that still doesn’t help me figure out what to get him for his birthday.” Sam thought a moment, then asked “should I even get him anything for his birthday? Could he take it back with him, or will it mess up the timeline? God, this shit hurts my head sometimes.”
Holding hands out on the street again, Dean smiled at Cas and said "This is a great first date Cas, thanks."
MJ smiled at that. "I'll take Sammy while you take care of Papa. You need anything, just yell." She looked at Gabriel and Kevin, making head motions towards the door. They got the hint and they all left the room, closing the door behind them.
Sam came in waves of pleasure and embarrassment. He
“Dude, marathon sex did nothing for your personality,” Dean laughed.
“No direct attacks on either line, but if they’re injured as a result of their own actions then they’re fair game,” Crowley countered, “and I won’t even ask for a kiss, we can sign a contract.”
Cas ran his palms up the firm planes of Dean's chest before settling his arms around his shoulders, smiling. "You are definitely no girl, Dean Winchester."
"A prophet?" Sam asked, a little surprised. "Who is he? What's his name?"
Deanna screamed as everything happened at once-Gabriel was coming, she could feel the thick muscle spasming inside her; wave after wave of ecstasy rolled over her body; lightning shot up and down her spine to every nerve ending. Galaxies exploded behind her eyelids, and it felt like her soul had caught fire and left her body only to return as a charred ember.
"That's the plan," he said, smiling. He sped up his thrusts, fucking her hard and deep. He could feel his own loss of control as Deanna's muscles started squeezing his dick; he wasn't gonna last much longer. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly as he thrust into her a few more times. As he snapped his fingers, he cried out, "now!"
Cas slowly extricated himself from Dean, Dean groaning as Cas slid out of his well-fucked hole. Cas reached over the side of the bed, grabbed a shoe, and threw it at the door before climbing back into bed and curling up to Dean.
* * * * *
badasses. But Dad’s no slouch either. He’s like your Q now.”
Dean and Gabriel had pulled the wingback chairs together on the other side of the room, beers in hand, watching deleted scenes from the last season of Dr. Sexy on Dean’s laptop. Dr. Piccolo had just tried to slap Dr. Sexy and he had caught her hand when Dean paused the clip.
MJ’s eyes went wide. “Okay, but you asked for it.” She took a couple deep breaths to control her laughter, hoping to make it through the whole story before she lost it again. “You know the kind of music that Papa likes to listen to?” Dean frowned at that, remembering the hip hop music, and nodded. “Well, you caught him dancing to it a few times. Actually, Papa’s a really good dancer. Turned out you liked his dancing so much that you got the bright idea to set up a stripper pole for him.” Dean’s eyes went wide with horror as he remembered MJ’s quip this past Valentine’s Day when he had asked about his sex life in the future. The ten shades of red he turned earlier had nothing on the twenty shades of red he must be now. “Anyways,” MJ continued, “the way Bobby tells it, when he came out of his room that night you were sitting back on the couch with a stack of one dollar bills in your hand, and Papa was doing some pretty indecent things on that stripper pole.” Dean gulped. “Upside down.” Dean’s eyes bugged out of his head. “In nothing but a little red Speedo. And his song of choice was
“Right here,” Bobby said, walking into the room. “All set?” Sam went and hugged his son before standing next to Dean and Cas. Each group nodded at the other before going their separate ways.
“Come on,” Dean said, taking Cas by the hand, “I have an idea.”
"I really am your favorite, aren't I?" Gabriel asked playfully, quickly nipping at her other nipple, making her squirm.

They tumbled into their room, mouths all over each other’s faces and necks and hands in each other’s hair. They clumsily toed off their shoes and socks as they tugged at each other’s tee shirts. Cas unbuttoned Dean’s jeans and yanked them and his boxer briefs to the floor before practically throwing him onto their bed, shimmying out of his own jeans before climbing onto Dean’s hips in nothing but a pair of fitted black briefs trimmed in white.
Castiel chuckled darkly, and with a grin he said, "
Dean grasped his angel's shoulders to try to get him to ease up, but Cas must have thought he wanted something else because his lips moved lower as he unbuttoned Dean's pants and pushed them and his underwear down in one swift move. Cas actually
Dean grabbed a shotgun from the library and tossed it to his brother, brandishing an angel blade himself.
“Have you already contacted Aaron?” MJ asked her.
Dean had Cas follow him about 20 minutes outside of town to Rock Point, a bluff overlooking Kansas City. He pulled up first, having Cas park next to him. The sun was just starting its descent, giving them a gorgeous view of the city below. He left the engine running, windows down, and got out to meet Cas.
MJ and Dean in grungy jeans and tees, covered in grease, standing in front of a beat up old Chevelle with their arms crossed over their chests. This must be the car they fixed up together.
At the end of rehearsal, Dean approached Castiel, a swagger in his bowed legs. Bowed legs that Castiel was certain would feel exquisite wrapped around his body…
Castiel sat at his computer, unsure of where to start. He had woken up at his usual six in the morning to run, shower, and eat. On the weekends he would spend the mornings practicing, but after his date with Dean the previous night he didn’t feel the urge to pull out the classical pieces. Instead, he was determined to find some modern music that appealed to him.

“Back the truck up,” Gabriel said, his head whipping in Castiel’s direction. “I was joking. Who the hell are you trying to impress?”
Dean was making space in his dresser for all the stuff Gabriel snapped up for the baby. He laughed at some of the novelty onesies-'My Uncle is an Angel', 'I'm why we can't have nice things', 'My dad can kick your dad's ass'. After clearing out the bassinet, he sat down next to Cas on the bed, holding his arms out for little Sammy. Cas smiled at him, letting him get settled with the baby before handing over the almost empty bottle.
“That was her idea, not mine,” Crowley replied.
“Dean Winchester, love is not a strong enough word for how I feel about you.”
“Hey MJ,” Dean replied, distracted by his thoughts.
MJ giggled as they took their seats. "I sure hope not, but I wouldn't put it past him if he figured it out. His brother's not the only smart one in the family," she told him. "I'm MJ," she introduced herself, holding out her hand.
Cas ran his hands around Dean to stroke his back. “These make me feel more desirable,” Cas stated simply.

“Cas?” Dean called out.
Mary stood next to Bobby, smiling down at the baby in his arms. She was in her mid-sixties now, but still beautiful. “We’ve missed you guys this past year,” she told him. “We have so much to catch up on.”
“No, you’re not,” MJ said, taking his hand in hers and squeezing it. “We’ve intentionally kept our distance from you guys so that you could get to know us as we grow, and so you guys don’t raise us with preconceived notions of who we are and what we should be. Trust me, you’ll get to know him pretty well as he grows. You’ll get to see all the cute baby stuff he does, be there for his first words, his first steps, his first book. And by the time he’s older, you two are gonna know everything important about each other. Don’t stress it too much.”
Gabriel sighed, then waggled his eyebrows at Sam. "To be continued," he promised, then snapped his fingers, disappearing from the room.
" Sam was floored. He'd never heard of a Nephilim with wings before. But like Gabriel said, there'd never been a part-archangel Nephilim before. "Is he going to be okay? Is anything else going to happen to him?" Sam was thoroughly freaked out now.
Gabriel took the presents from Castiel and put them with the gifts that he and Sam had gotten for Bobby. “Ever been to a birthday party before Cassie?” Gabriel asked him with a smile.
