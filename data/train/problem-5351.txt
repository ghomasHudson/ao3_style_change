Hmph. Tony pouts, crossing his arms. Natasha smirks at him, and he glares at her. How dare she make fun of him? All he wants is Steve’s attention.
Clint must know that he knows because he ignores the question. “Feels like they should be here with us, doesn’t it? Well, anyway, good night.”
, like he belongs there, even though they’re oversized and practically hanging off of his smaller frame.
But when he comes back from the bathroom, it’s just him and Tony and the present he’d gotten for him looped around Tony’s right wrist. Natasha’s car is gone from the parking lot, a minivan filled with screaming children parked in its place.
“They always make me feel better when I’m sick, and that’s what you are. You’re sick right now, DUM-E. But I’m going to make you feel better. I just thought you might like to hear a story while I’m working, that’s all.” He eyes his bot and then adds, “Maybe even a Captain America story if you’re good. Those are the
She tilts her head, thinking about it. “I thought we needed to have one hand on the wheel to give us a small bit of control so that worse things weren’t done to us. I know that there were things in the original drafts that had even Tony worried, but he never told me what they were.”
. Now, I want everything to look perfect, and if you’re only going to complain about my hard work, then I think it would be best if you waited for your husband backstage.”
But then he’d proposed the night after their graduation, completely convinced that Tony would say yes. Tony gave him a horrible deer in the headlights look that Steve knew he would never be able to forget, closed the ring box, and gave it back to Steve. And it was then that Tony had told him—he’d gotten an offer somewhere else and said yes months before they’d heard back from the place they had agreed on. Steve remembered that station; he’d put an application in there too. They’d both been convinced he’d get the job, he’d been a shoo-in, but he’d gotten rejected instead, the position offered to a more established and well-known talk show host. He’d thought that had been the end of it, but Tony had apparently been so convinced the position was Steve’s that he’d accepted their offer to him when it came in.
“I know I will,” Tony says, because it’s true. He can do anything he puts his mind to. He could be a
“Have you?” Tony interrupts. He doesn’t sound judgmental or disbelieving, only curious, but Steve bristles anyway. He gets questioned on his capability all the time and it gets frustrating.
to get there early. His face isn’t betraying anything other than disdain as he wrinkles his nose at the shabby safehouse.
we have so little time?” Steve asks. “It’s bothered me. It doesn’t make any sense, we should have been involved in this process from the ground up.”
But then, as they walk toward the fairgrounds, Tony shifts the gift bag to his other hand and slips the one closest to him into Steve’s hand. Steve almost stops walking, he’s so surprised, but manages to keep moving just barely. Tony’s hand is small and warm in his, fingers slotting perfectly between his own. It feels so right Steve wonders how he went his entire life without this.
store. It’s basically an apothecary? Like the last one but this one will definitely not sell rat poison next to the lust potions and—” He gets cut off by the voicemail telling him he’s out of time.
To Steve’s confusion, Vision didn’t look relieved. “Thank you, but I believe I’ll bring it up to the watch anyway. Maybe one of them heard something.”
Tony straightens, making grabby hands for the tablet Steve places on the table. Steve slides it to him, watching intently as Tony flips through the document he had prepared.
“Not firing. Just… letting go. I’ll let you two finish out the year to October, give you some time to find new jobs, and then we’ll part ways. It’s been a good run, but surely you boys didn’t think it would be forever.”
Steve blinks. Tony had really thought that he’d be able to bring them in peacefully? Did he know anything about Steve “I’m picking every battle ever” Rogers? Or was it that he’d hoped? After all, Spiderman (geez, just a kid, Steve had nearly dropped a truck on a
She gets up and heads inside before the full impact of her statement hits him. But as soon as it does, he shouts after her, “Wait! You guys had
, whether that’s comms, mechanical, or even medical. Tony does it all. According to Natasha, Tony, who’s one of the few nonhumans on the ship, was once a member of high society on his home planet, Aur’a, but left it all behind to join the
“It’s okay,” Tony says hastily. “I’m going to turn him off until I get the chance to run out to Switzerland to fabricate a new personality chip for him. It’s not—you didn’t hurt him. U’s not upset, are you, buddy?”
“Yeah,” Natasha agrees ruthlessly, “but then we met you as a human for the first time and it turned out you’re about as threatening as a kitten.”
Steve had been ignoring him up to that point, just as he’d been ignoring all of Bucky’s lectures about his relationship with Tony for the last two days, but at the idea that he didn’t know what he was doing, he turned and hissed, “I
“—colors,” Tony is saying. “We’ll put a card or something down next to the horses, or maybe we’ll include it with a purchase. Red for romance, blue for pirates, green for coziness.”
Rhodey grimaces. “It’s kind of a poor bedtime story, but I thought you might like to hear it anyway.”
Pierce laughed a small, fake laugh. “Not exactly. I can keep the show as long as I bring on new hosts, people that these focus groups recommend, you know how it works. You have a very popular show. I’d hate to lose it.”
Her smile is a little more genuine this time. After a moment, she continues, “As for you and Sam, I thought Rhodey would be able to talk Sam around… and that Tony would do the same for you.”
“It should. If they’re going to insult me, they should do it properly.” Abruptly, Tony’s anger disappeared, and he slithered off the desk to drop into the chair across from Steve. “Fuck, Steve, I knew that Pierce’s conservative backers hated us, but I thought the liberal ones would more than make up for it.”
“Okay,” Tony says simply, and Steve loves him for how much Tony trusts him. His eyes turn mischievous, and he smirks. “But I want you to know that I’m buying the DVD. We’re going to watch it every year on your birthday because, really, this horror can’t be lived only once.”
“You’re not living with your father right now,” she says firmly, dropping a kiss on his forehead so he knows she’s not upset with him. She wishes she could take this sweet boy away from his father—not her friend, not anymore and not for a long time—but the life of a SHIELD agent is no life for a little boy, even one as precocious as Tony is. “You’re living with me, and if you want a Cap Bear, then we’ll go get you a Cap Bear.”
“But remember that no matter what you decide, it can’t be a unilateral decision. You can’t make this decision for your partner, just like they can’t make it for you. Fairytale love is just that: a fairytale. True love takes dedication and communication and a lot of work.”
“Steve, this isn’t high school. You can’t make them like your asshole nerd friend because you’re the captain of the lacrosse team and can get away with anything, even lame hobbies, like, I don’t know, Charleston!”
Tony takes the first shower. He’s quick, and comes out of the bathroom already dressed in fresh clothes, his dirty ones wrapped up in a bundle he puts in a plastic bag.
It’s nothing that I recognize. From what I’ve seen it’s a mix between the Roman Empire and some kind of medieval kingdom. But the tech is different. The tech is familiar. And the King owns it all.
While Bucky is in cryo, and Sam is... where is Sam, exactly? And he hasn’t heard from Natasha in weeks, or from Sharon, or Clint, or Wanda, or even Scott.
“I know you like to... I know you’re a tactile person. That’s okay. But I still don’t feel... I can’t do it all the time.”
It’s nice out. It’s not too hot yet, but it will be soon. Steve sets the basket with the clothes on the grass, while Tony carries the clothespins from the laundry room. Tony passes the clothes and the pins to Steve, and he hangs them. It’s quiet and monotonous and normal and Steve could do it for the rest of his life if he got to keep Tony.
You, you who are different, at least you in the universe / You are a point that never revolves around me / A sun that shines only for me / Like a diamond in the middle of the heart.
Tony, that’s them, together, as a unit, as a family, as mates. The scent of their beautiful daughter, now that, too, free of that touch of
“Could you keep your arms up? Like this,” Steve asks, and he sounds like he’s in a dream. Tony throws his arms past his head and Steve stretches his neck to let kisses cascade on one of Tony’s triceps, to scatter little bites on the softer skin there, and Tony wishes he could have those teeth someplace else, that he could feel them sink into his shoulder and bear that brief pain in exchange for—
There’s something in him, an awful sensation in his lower abdomen, like ten invisible knives have been planted and twisted into him. His legs weigh so much he can’t even move them.
“I love you, too,” Tony interrupts him, smiling, because Steve always knows what to say to him, how to deal with him and his anxiety. Tony cuddles up closer to Steve’s body, closes his eyes.
“And he’ll be monitored by doctors, psychologists… his experience could be incredibly useful in getting this technology out, in every hospital eventually, and help veterans, abuse victims, people with PTSD, children... children—”
friends, Tony. Of course we were. It wasn’t always perfect but... I cared about you. I still do. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.”
“And I still miss Peggy, you know, and Bucky, the way he used to be, and my friends and my time and my world but I… I also think that if I went back now I’d miss
The day is sunny and clear, and when he feels better Tony points at things in the distance to tell Steve what they are. He stands in the crenel between two merlons, and Steve positions himself just behind him. He can smell Tony’s expensive shampoo.
The first time they had sex was right after their first kiss. Steve dropped to his knees and then Tony reciprocated after making Steve lie down on the bed. The second time it was Steve that initiated it, slow handjobs under the hot spray of the shower, and Tony looked surprised by it. Like it was weird that Steve wanted it. Wanted
Steve nods, tries to take big gulps of air, and he almost manages to succeed thanks to Tony’s soothing presence, his kind voice, before remembering that Tony hates him now.
“You’re not. You’re amazing. You feel so good; you feel incredible. You’re so wet. My perfect Omega. I’m never gonna leave you. Now that I got you back… I’m never… never…”
and an air of finality, his shoulders tense up under Steve’s scrutiny. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, opens his eyes again and turns to look at Steve. “Thank you. For helping me,” he says, and Steve’s breath catches in his throat.
Steve feels incredibly stupid for thinking Tony forgot about him, and then absurdly relieved that he actually didn’t.
He hangs the strop on one of the robe hooks. He takes his time making sure the blade is sharp, because the razor hasn’t been used in a long time, and he wants to do a good job.
He wants to be with Tony, to feel his love in his mind. He wants Tony’s hands on his skin. He wants to be a father again. And again and again and again and again. He wants to be okay, but he can only hope to retain enough presence of mind to be able to say goodbye to Tony and Sarah, before wasting away in this room.
Tony stretches out onto the bed, turning towards the middle of the mattress so he can look at Sarah while she sleeps. He leaves Steve to make his decision. He can’t do more than ask.
It’s been a good life. He has a lot of regrets, but it’s been good, too. He saved the world. He helped people. He’s Sarah’s father, and that’s worth everything.
of Tony’s, the low hum of the reactor. Tony twitches in his sleep—it’s not peaceful at all, and Steve wonders how much rest he’s really getting. The wind howls outside, the leaves rustle. Stella sings while she cooks, the cats meowing at her.
The first word he says after months of silence is Steve’s name. It’s Steve who breaks him out of his imprisonment, so it seems well-mannered to greet him in some way.
Tony smiles too, and Steve takes a moment to congratulate himself, because he did it. He made Tony laugh.
He went quiet after coming back from getting the water, he’s retreated into some place in his head Tony doesn’t have access to.
But he’d be lying if he said his knees don’t almost give up on him while he turns and walks to the bed. He takes off his shoes and sits on his heels on the mattress, next to Tony, who’s lying on his side, an arm bent at the elbow to prop his head up with his hand. His t-shirt has ridden up to show a strip of bruised skin.
Steve cleans the razor carefully and rinses the shaving brush. He starts the whole process on Tony, from the top, making him wash his face with hot water first.
“I love you. I am in love with you. In love. I want to be with you. In a relationship. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“Come here for a moment?” Tony asks, and Steve drops Tony’s t-shirt and gives up folding it altogether. Five tries are enough even for his tenacity.
Warning: there's some graphic violence/blood and major character death towards the end of this chapter BUT all in the context of a dream. None of it actually happens, but it's still pretty vivid so be careful <3
“Lie down,” Nat says, with her Alpha voice, and Steve wants to rise up to the challenge, but he can’t. He’s too tired. “Tony’s safe,” she says, and that gives Steve a small amount of peace.
“Have I really gained no ground at all, all this time?” he asks, and he’s not entirely sure he meant for Tony to hear.
The first time the man brought him here, Tony thought he’d get beaten up, tortured, killed. That would have been okay. But the man, instead, forced Tony to walk to the bed and then ordered him to strip and lie down on his stomach.
Steve speeds up, and with his thrusts Tony’s breath quickens too, every push of Steve’s hips matched by a moan. He’s so loud. Steve is so happy.
So it’s just— disheartening, in a way, the fact that now, finally, he has Steve, they are together in the way he has dreamed and desired since that first day in Germany all those years ago, and yet Tony can’t live this thing in the way he really wants to, all because he is
They look at each other in silence for a few seconds, and then they can’t hold their laughter in anymore, they let it flutter over them, fill the room, die against the ceiling.
Steve rearranges their bodies on the bed, lifts Tony like he weighs nothing to him (he doesn’t) and makes him lie down on his back. Steve hovers over him, balancing himself up with one arm on the mattress. He takes the base of his dick with his other hand, lines himself up, looks down at Tony’s lap and–
“I fear there’ll be second-thoughts. That we did it only thinking about her, and not us. Because it’s about us, too. It’s our bond, and if it doesn’t work—”
Worry must slip from him and into the bond, because Tony asks, “Are you alright? You don’t look so good.”
But anyway, googling “having sex with an older man” was probably a mistake, Steve realizes. After filtering away all the porn (and just how much porn is there on the internet exactly,
Tony looks at him, lips still pursed with sadness, but he nods, resigned in the way he accepts Steve’s words.
He’s been telling himself that he hates Steve for so long that maybe he doesn’t even know who he is if he doesn’t. But he’s loved Steve for so long that the idea of ever stopping seems foolish, even by Tony’s standards.
“My blood is your blood. My flesh is your flesh. My mind is your mind.  May our bond be never-ending, may our lives be tied forever. There is no beginning and no conclusion. We are together as one in the garden of life.”
Tony looks at the city below him, the penthouse completely dark around him. He’s still wearing the robe Steve gave him in the gym, muttering some excuses about not being able to find Tony’s t-shirt. His pants were a complete loss.
Tony nods, and he lies down on the bed, wiping his hand on the clean sheets. He tucks his face against Steve’s chest while Steve’s arms go around his back.
He was almost sure he could avoid it, he just needed to find an excuse to run to the bathroom without making Tony suspicious or letting him see…
“Sure, it’s not the most ideal timing. I agree. But you need this, and I’m here for you. Maybe it’s actually better this way. God knows how much time we would’ve wasted dancing around this thing if left to our own devices.”
Tony discards his tablet to the side, listens to the birds tweeting, the crickets chirping, the wind rustling through the leaves above them, through the rose bushes a few feet from them.
Tony works for a while. Steve reads. The room is silent. There’s only them breathing, Steve turning the page. The clicking of Tony’s keyboard, him leafing through his notes.
Steve drags Tony onto his lap, but facing the other way from him. He guides Tony to sit on his cock and frames his hips with his hands while Tony rides him.
There’s only one thing that can happen next, and Tony watches as Steve pushes his own waistband down, frees his own cock—which is… ah, fuck, it’s huge—and pushes inside him.
“You hadn’t realized yet, had you? Here, taste yourself,” Steve continues, and pushes two fingers inside Tony to coat them in slick and press them against Tony’s lips.
It’s a kid. No more than eight, Steve would guess, but he’s no expert. He has huge red glasses that cover most of his face, and a Wonder Woman t-shirt. He’s patting Tony’s thigh to get his attention. Tony crouches down to talk to him.
“T’Challa got a couple of his doctors on the issue, and they were able to formulate a sedative strong enough for Steve. Each time he went into a rut we would inject him, but we were also putting his life at risk. His biology is so unique that predicting how he’d respond was almost impossible. But he accepted it.”
“And then, after everything went down, I felt so stupid. I felt dirty, because I still wanted you, I still, you know, underneath it all, I knew I still loved you, and I wanted to stop loving you, I wanted it so much, more than anything. I wanted to be free of your spell. Of you.
If there’s a side he has to choose, it’s his mother’s. If there’s a thread he has to pick up to continue what others before him have done, he wants it to lead back to his mother. If there’s someone he wants to be compared to, he wants to measure up with, he wants to make proud, it’s his mother.
Steve lets his arm drop to his side. His chest heaves with a sigh. He turns away, heading for the door again.
It’s fun, the banter, playing like this with each other, with what happened, make it less terrible together. Knowing when to stop before it becomes too much.
The next thing Steve knows is that he’s kissing Tony, and it feels like a relief, like he can breathe again. He’s trapped between Tony’s desk and his chair. He caresses Tony’s face while kissing him, shoulders hunched low.
After, Tony spreads the blue blanket under the oak tree, and Steve draws while Tony works on his tablet. Hours fly like this, until Tony shifts on his flank, and his t-shirt rides up on his side, exposing his hip. The skin there is red and swollen.
“Yes. Every year, after the party with the Foundation. We always spent the summer in Los Angeles, Jarvis would drive us to the hills to see the stars. I used to make fun of her because she’d never change except for her shoes. So she was always wearing some beautiful gown and flip-flops.”
The spaceship’s engines provide a background noise that I’m no longer familiar with, but I’m grateful for it nevertheless. It drowns out my thoughts.
He sighs and he turns away from Tony and he lifts a fist up to his face. Frustration radiates off of him while he seems to look for a way to discharge this awful energy but can’t find any. The only thing Tony can think about is that he wants Steve to fuck him into the mattress right now.
Soon, he’s back in the cave. By now it should feel almost familiar, but there’s something about it this time that makes it seem like a completely different place. It’s always been dark and damp, but it never felt this unwelcoming. The place is rejecting Tony’s presence.
She enters the room and sees her dads on the couch and doesn’t say a word. She just goes to them, sits between them, welcomed by open arms that only want to keep her safe and happy.
He thinks about their fingers brushing, Steve’s fear of having messed this up even more. His apologetic, terrified face. Tony’s whispered reassurance.
Tony closes his eyes for a moment, defeated. He licks his lips then, shakes his head. “Steve—” he starts.
Steve breaks the kiss, stands up, undresses in under a minute like the perfect soldier he is, always quick and efficient when necessary. Tony just stares at him. Now he can.
One corner of Tony’s mouth tugs upwards without his permission, but he quickly wrestles his face into a neutral expression, and nods at Steve in acknowledgment.
There’s a light in Tony’s eyes. Something that Steve has seen only a few times. After they defeated the Chitauri and saved New York. When Steve told him,
Steve sits on the bed as though he’s scared of it. He stares at the opposite corner of the room for a very long time, breathing a little too fast. He lies down, then, slow and careful, eyes fixed on the ceiling.
Steve touches his face and thrusts up into him. Tony realizes only then that he has stopped moving. God. He can’t even do the one thing he’s supposedly biologically programmed to do.
He tries to shake her off once or twice, but the cat keeps resting her paw on the back of his hand. In the end, he just lets her.
Finally, Tony cries, and to add to the humiliation there’s saliva running down his chin and he can’t control it. He can’t do anything, even wiping his own mouth feels like too much work and everything is just—
The burns are the worst part. I hate it when they burn me. I hate that I’ve gotten used to it and I don’t pass out anymore.
After lunch, they go back to the Piazza and inside the Palazzo Pubblico, where Steve spends more time than Tony probably has the patience for staring at the frescos and taking notes, but Tony doesn’t complain. He simply waits for Steve to be done.
He enters one of the cafés on the edge of the Piazza and waits for his turn. He orders a glass of sparkling water, drinks it quickly. While he pays, he asks if he can use the toilet, and the girl at the register holds out the key for him. He asks her to please put it on the counter, and she does without comment—she’s seen weirder. He takes the key and enters the small bathroom at the end of the corridor, closes the door behind himself with a sigh of relief.
“We do,” Steve protests, and the front of Tony’s jeans falls apart between his fingers. “Sorry,” he says, and Tony looks almost offended by that. That Steve isn’t just ripping everything away, making this quick and efficient and not allowing Tony too much time to think about it. About the consequences, about what this
“You can ask for more food, if you need it.” Tony’s words are very slow, as if he’s explaining this to a small child who can’t yet grasp complex concepts.
He pushes another finger in, makes Tony groan, and rubs his prostate when he finds it, which only makes Tony groan louder.
“Come on,” Steve says then, with only a hint of his serious Alpha voice, the one Sarah doesn’t disobey. “You’re gonna be late for school.”
“It is, but... I’m scared, Steve. I just feel... the guilt, it’s too much. And I don’t know how I can make it up to him. Like, how can I even begin—”
They eat slowly, and the sun is completely gone when they start the dishwasher. It’s late, and Tony has yawned a couple of times.
“No, just... I was... I don’t remember it very well, I was…” Tony frowns with the effort of thinking about it. “It was all dark... I don’t know.”
Tony squeezes Steve’s thigh. As agreed, Steve speeds up his thrusts, and Tony closes his eyes and lets himself go, lets saliva dribble down the corners of his mouth and on his chin, lets himself be a thing—a mouth to be fucked instead of a person.
It’s easy to do. Tony’s beard isn’t as long as Steve’s was, and the edges of his goatee are still visible.
“That’s what I said. Listen, we’re mostly okay. Steve… less than me. He’s… They…” Tony sighs. “Shit,” he says to the side, before coughing once and regaining control. “I would appreciate it if a couple of doctors were around the compound when we get back. We have a jet and will be home soon. How’s Sarah?”
Tony regains control of the car. He’s breathing hard. He swallows, keeping his eyes fixed in front of him.
Tony knows it’s Steve by the way he knocks on his door. It’s fast, but very soft. Steve has always been kind with him; he’s never been threatening or violent. Never. Except in Leipzig and that day in the HYDRA base in Siberia.
“Uh… kinda. A bit.” Tony looks at his watch—the only thing he’s wearing. “Damn. I still have to shower,” he says, his arm moving in a wide gesture towards the bathroom door.
Tony lifts his arm, brushes his fingers, playful, over Steve’s face, makes him close his eyes for a second. “Wasn’t your fault.”
The words are whispered, quick and apologetic as if it’s too late to say them. Tony hears them with his ears but they echo in his mind. Steve squeezes his hand through the strip of fabric, and a feeling of suspense takes root into Tony’s heart, of fear and defeat. Tony realizes then that those feelings aren’t his, but Steve’s, and he knows what he has to do. He squeezes Steve’s hand back, and—
And it was fine, Steve was fine with it. It was never going to be a problem anyway because he was going to marry Peggy after the war and they would be happy, they would be so, so happy. They would stay together forever, love each other forever, and it would be the most beautiful life Steve could have ever dreamed.
He shakes his head. He was hoping mentioning Tony hadn’t rattled Riri, but for sure it rattled Steve. He forces himself to focus on something else.
They walk up to the Eremo. The climb is worse than Tony remembered, or maybe it’s just the past few years catching up with him.
He doesn’t need to breathe, and that really is good. It means that the back of his throat stays open no matter how deep Tony fucks into his mouth. He doesn’t choke on Tony’s dick, at all. It’s like not having a gag reflex.
“Of course,” Tony says, quickly tapping at his phone. “So, we’re going to visit Stella tomorrow. Is it still okay if we leave in the afternoon?” Tony asks, sipping his coffee.
Tony imagines his hand touching the bond inside his mind. He finds Steve. He’s scared, more than anything else. There’s something shouting at him in his mind, alarms going off, and he’s fighting them with all his might. The compulsion is impossibly strong, but he’s so afraid of hurting Tony.
“I want you. More than I’ve ever wanted anything else in my life. But not like this. Not while we are like this.”
“You think you’ll be able to sleep?” Steve asks later, when they’re settling into bed for the night. It’s still early, but maybe Steve wants this day to be over as soon as possible, so the next can start. He’s not a patient person, after all.
“Tony, hey, listen to me. That thing, it happened, but it’s not happening right now. Listen, you’re safe. I’m not gonna hurt you.”
Tony looks at Steve, at the wound he caused, and for a moment he thinks that the bright red of Steve’s blood contrasts beautifully against his pale skin, his blue eyes. But Steve groans, and Tony’s senses shift, making space for the horror of this new cruelty he inflicted, to the contrast between his intentions and all his mistakes.
They decide to climb the clock tower, see the view from the top. There are more than three hundred steps, though, and this time it takes Tony a while to recuperate, for his chest to stop heaving. He sits in a corner and breathes, and keeps telling Steve that he’s fine, that nothing’s wrong. He looks so small.
Naked, his clothes neatly folded and placed on a rock, Steve walks to the shore, and Tony takes his hand again, guiding him into the river.
Steve’s eyes go wide, and something escapes his mouth, something between a whimper and a laugh. His shoulders shake, his entire face brightens up.
He rests his forehead against the tiles and imagines himself taking a walk along the abandoned bond in his mind. He sees it, as most people say they do, like a beam of light, one side of which is lost in the darkness of his mind’s horizon.
The water, as Tony promised, is warm. Not exactly hot, but it’s enough not to make Steve’s situation worse. And Tony, all skin and smiles and eyes and so, so close to him, makes him feel almost warmer, just like that morning in the bathtub.
He enters the building while an old lady is exiting the front door, and he’s quick up the stairs. He rings the bell and Nat opens the door a minute later. Clearly, she was still asleep.
Tony helps him wear a t-shirt. Then, he tries to put sweatpants on Steve, and that’s when Steve realizes that there’s something wrong with his penis.
I’m sitting on the edge of the bed, and he’s crouched down in front of me, between my open thighs. He has blue eyes. Blue eyes. Younger.
Sometimes he’d stop in his tracks for a second, lost in thought, and Steve would turn around, touch his hand, and ask, “What are you thinking about?” and Tony would meet his gaze and say, “Nothing,” and it would be the truth, because while the question was asked and the answer was given, the moment for thinking about it—about what the man did to him once a day every day for four months and twelve days—is already gone.
There’s a perverse satisfaction in spitting on it, right at the center. It’s supposed to feel like ruining something perfect, but it actually looks all the better like this—stained, marred, blemished. Marked. Tony’s.
She is professional, polite. Her cat has left scratches over the back of her right hand. Her red lipstick is perfect even in this sweltering heat, even in this concrete desert. She is at least five inches taller than Tony and she’s wearing flats.
“But we might not always have the time to discuss things in full. In that case I want you to trust me and my judgement.”
“No,” he says, trying to muster his most confident voice, “no, we… I want to finish now. Please. Please.” Tony wipes his face with the palm of his hand, sniffs, rubs his eyes. “Okay. I’m okay,” he lies.
“Nope,” Steve says, lamely, and drops the cigarette in the glass, watches as it stops burning the moment it touches the water. He drags a hand on his face, scratches his beard. “Didn’t mean to wake you up.”
Steve shoots him a final skeptical look and follows Tony in the bathroom, closes the lid of the toilet to sit on it. Tony begins cleaning the burn on Steve’s collarbone, but the serum has already kicked in, the bleeding has stopped. Steve is trembling; there are goosebumps on his skin. Tony can’t fathom how he can be cold right now.
They stay like that, in silence, for many precious minutes, and Steve has the time to assess how much his body is hurting, which is a lot. But it’s still the phantom pain in his mind that truly kills him.
“One day I’ll get it—why you have such a hard time believing that I love you,” Steve says, almost playful, but Tony’s voice is very serious when he replies, and Steve feels his warm breath against his own neck.
There’s a small sound, and Tony instructs FRIDAY to let Steve in the penthouse. He waits for him to walk across the living room, to the windows.
Steve turns off the light, and pads to Tony, his movements muffled by his socked feet. He stands next to him, looks out of the window for a while. The rain is violent and merciless, like Steve’s blows that day in the HYDRA base, like the ice around them, like all their mistakes.
There’s a crack in his soul. Trying to hold off Steve’s rage is taking its toll on him; it threatens to split him open right in the middle. But there’s no one else that can do this, no one else is up to this task. Only Tony, and the thought comforts him for a brief moment.
But how can Steve not want Tony? It’s not just that he’s in love with him, it’s that Tony’s body is— amazing. Steve has seen him naked many times, usually in the gym showers or S.H.I.E.L.D.’s decontamination units. He always tried to be subtle and respectful, but he did
As Tony expected, nothing about it is even remotely similar to what the man used to do. Steve’s gestures, the things he says, his sighs and grunts and groans of pleasure, they’re all different. He’s a completely different person, a completely different man.
There’s a long pause, filled only by the rustling of the wind, by the rushing of the water, by the distant voices of children playing in the sunlight.
Tony looks around the bed for the lube, and squeezes some on Steve’s cock. Then he sinks down on it, just like that night; he rolls his hips and Steve feels like he’s being pinned down, crucified, Tony is so tight around him that it almost hurts, and it’s so, so good.
Tony opens his eyes and can’t tell from the light how much time has passed, but he doesn’t feel as rested as he’d like, so he assumes not too much. The water is warm. Steve, behind him, is hot and solid and soft all at once. His skin is incredibly smooth, Tony muses while caressing Steve’s arm.
She falls asleep between them. Steve moves them all to Tony’s bed without a word. They sleep huddled close, the way they’re really supposed to for the first time ever.
“She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” he whispers in the end. “Person, I mean. She’s a person.”
“He didn’t touch Mom, right? I was… he could… with me, it was, it was different, right? But he never hurt Mom, he never… I never—”
And then Tony thinks that he might as well use all the weapons in his I’m-a-terrible-human-being arsenal for this, so he balances himself against the floor, sticks his ass out, and presents himself for Steve’s taking. He makes himself as irresistible as any Omega can be for their Alpha, even though Tony is old and not as appealing as he once was—which never was much to begin with, considering Omega beauty standards.
It gets better, which prompts Tony to move his thumb, slowly, in and out of Steve. He tries switching his thumb with his forefinger, which isn’t as thick, and Steve muscles close around it like a vise.
“Right. Well. It, uh, it was good. Yeah. I mean, technique could be improved, but that’s true of basically anything when you ask me. Anything can be improved. So it was… yeah. It was really, really… really good. Yeah... I don’t last an hour anyway.”
He dries off when he’s calmed down. He dresses quickly once he’s back in the bedroom. He sits on his side of the bed and shivers and cries.
Tony nods, once, sharply, and Steve places a hand on his neck, under his ear, holds him in place, brings their foreheads together. He doesn’t try to kiss Tony, doesn’t want to ask for more trust than he’s already been given. Slowly, he lowers his head until he’s almost lying stomach down on the floor, propping himself up with his elbows. Tony’s dick is inches away from Steve’s face, Tony’s hand is still moving fast and unforgiving. Then suddenly Tony stills, his whole body goes tense, and Steve knows it’s now or never. He leans down, opens his mouth, takes the head of Tony’s dick between his lips and sucks, once. Tony’s come is hot and thick on his tongue, the taste isn’t as bitter as he thought it would be. He lets his mouth be flooded, swallows as much as he can, lets the rest run down his chin freely, shamelessly, makes a mess of himself, lets it drop back down Tony’s length, on his hand, on his neck. And again, like some strange force beat it out of him, like he’s violating some sort of cosmic law just by thinking about allowing himself this, Tony moans, and Steve still isn’t sure if it’s out of pleasure, of pain, of both.
He sits up on the bed, and Tony rearranges his limbs to straddle Steve’s thighs. He hasn’t pushed him away yet, but he feels like he’s going to any minute now.
Tony opens the drawer of his bedside table. The movement makes Steve’s sketches slide one over the other. He can see just a corner of the envelope, yellowed out by time despite the blue of the paper.
Most days Tony doesn’t need to pee at all, and when he finally does, it’s orange and murky and it hurts.
That changes things. Because she didn’t choose this and doesn’t deserve it. They’re fathers, and they’ve let their kid reek of hurt and loss her whole life. It’s not right.
He seem angry. Frustrated. Not specifically with Tony, which is the silver lining of this whole thing, but it’s still weird.
Steve looks up at the sky that peeks from beyond the thick foliage of the oak, and sucks in a shuddering breath.
He doesn’t really remember his nightmares, which is good, he supposes. He knows they’re about the man and what he did to him, because they leave him feeling furious and terrified, but sometimes… sometimes he bolts awake and he feels happy. He doesn’t know why—and goddammit why can’t he just remember the dream—but each time it happens he can fall back asleep in no time, and that must be some kind of blessing.
They get older and happier while time passes. They settle into each other, become comfortable with who they are, alone and together.
Tony has to stand on his tiptoes, while Steve is keeping his knees slightly bent, and still their body parts don’t align. As if that wasn’t enough, Tony’s dick so close to Steve’s looks positively
This is his guilty pleasure, his greatest shame, Steve doesn’t know how to define it. It’s where he draws Tony. Everything about Tony: his clever hands, his bright eyes, his nose, his hair, his face, his muscled shoulders, the arc reactor in his chest, the curve of his back, his wiry thighs, his lean legs, his bony feet. Tony hunched down at a table in his workshop with three thick books and four screens in front of him, Tony with his tongue poking out from his lips while he’s concentrating unscrewing something deep in the Iron Man armor, Tony covered in grease, Tony in the gym, Tony aiming repulsors at the Sinister Six, Tony in a designer suit at an Avengers press conference, Tony naked in the shower, Tony jerking off, Tony smiling, Tony crying, Tony with his head in his hands.
Steve spanks Tony’s ass over and over, until Tony is crying again, until Steve comes for the last time and his dick finally softens a bit.
He watches Tony’s throat start working in order to swallow but Steve tugs at his hair and says, “Don’t… Keep it there,” and Tony waits for him to pull out, then shuts his mouth and his eyes and keeps Steve’s come on his tongue like he’s been told.
, and Tony hadn’t, and what the hell was he thinking, anyway? Attacking Osborn like that, in broad daylight, with no protection, no plan, no backup.
“Listen to me, listen… You’re not gonna die, alright? I’m not gonna let you die, I promise. The minute the next wave hits I’ll be here, I’m gonna help you. But I need you to agree. I need you to say it with words.”
His bones ache. He feels hot all over except there, at the deepest of himself. There, it’s like he’s in the ice again, frozen. It’s like someone is hitting him with a hammer and shattering his bones into pieces.
Even as they’re alone, washing their hands in the downstairs bathroom, Steve doesn’t ask him anything. He wants that smile to play on Tony’s face for as long as possible.
“Steve,” Tony’s tone is earnest and eager, he strokes Steve’s arm, reassuring, “It’ll be good. You’ll make good use of me.”
“Remember when you... when you came to the workshop, and sat there drawing while I worked. I liked that. It’s happened, what, four or five times, maybe, but I liked it. Made me feel less alone.”
Tony sighs. He gets up, walks around the bed to settle down on his side. Steve hesitates for a moment, then lies next to him.
“Okay, listen to me now,” Steve pulls Tony’s chin up with his hand, makes Tony look at him. Tony feels ashamed, but he meets Steve’s eyes. “First of all, with our jobs,
He’d been scared by Steve’s deep-rooted self-loathing, by the way he kept tripping over his words, his speech patterns reduced to the simplest sentences by a guilt so intense it became pain. The anguish on his face, the degrading violence he inflicted upon himself, how the only things he sounded sure of were that Tony would never forgive him, would never want him.
Tony appreciates art, but his regard is more theoretical, not passionate like Steve’s. Tony gets that with science, with technology, with the future he so clearly envisions in his mind and fights so strenuously to build.
“Hey. Hey, look at me,” Steve’s voice is nothing but a murmur, but it latches onto something deep inside Tony, snatches the cap off everything Tony is trying to keep bottled up, releases all the tension at once: Tony’s eyes fly open and he stares at Steve, his mouth twists in a gasp, his breathing becomes ragged and shallow with pleasure, his body goes limp, melts in Steve’s arms.
They talk for about twenty minutes, and when they hang up there’s a hopeful smirk on T'Challa lips that makes Tony feel almost optimistic.
With clever hands, Tony unbuckles Steve’s belt, opens his pants, and drags them down to his thighs together with his stained underwear. He starts licking at him, cleaning up the results of his pleasure from his groin. Steve is harder than before. Tony swallows him too, drinks his second orgasm when it hits him a few minutes later. Steve can’t keep his eyes open, his head is spinning, there’s Tony there, in front of him, there’s only Tony in the whole world.
They clean up quickly, limiting everything to the necessary body parts. They can’t really do anything more with both their brains going
He thinks about the weird look Riri just gave him in the corridor, troubled and worried. He hopes this hasn’t rattled her too much. It’s always bad when someone mentions Tony to them, or when they have to mention him to anyone else. Many people loved Iron Man, many people were close to Tony, but no one like Steve and Riri.
There’s a doctor. Medicine seems to be pretty advanced compared to what this world looks like. There are antibiotics and vaccines. Painkillers, too, but I don’t get a lot of those. They also have some kind of body scanners.
Tony takes off his mother’s necklace and places it inside the drawer of his bedside table, on top of Steve’s sketches. Steve opens the bathroom door in that moment, and steps into the bedroom like a rom-com cliché, with a too-small towel wrapped way too low around his hips, skin still flushed from the hot shower, muscles glistening with drops of water.
“Goddammit,” Tony says under his breath, then swallows. He releases his wrist, but it’s still shaking a bit. He rubs his chest.
It took another couple of days, but they are at the end of the rut. Steve’s knots last barely an hour now. They’re going to be back to normal soon, and a part of Steve can’t wait for that to happen, so that his new life with Tony can start, so that he can see his daughter again, and his friends, too.
“I felt them so sharply this time. I always knew you… But this was...” He shakes his head, full of disbelief and dumbfounded surprise.
“It was about time I got some real pain in this arm. Now I’ll feel miserable with a reason,” he says. It makes Steve grimace, and he covers his mouth with his hand while his eyes fill with tears.
The trial alone was going to be a nightmare for everyone involved, so it’s better like this. One less problem to solve. The man is dead, and barely anyone gets to even know about it, so he never becomes a martyr for the leftover Hydra loyalists. No one complains about the unclear circumstances of his death.
“Gotta go upstairs…” Tony leaves the room without finishing the sentence. When he comes back, the atmosphere in the room changes. In his hand there’s Maria’s letter.
Steve wishes he could say something else, explain, find an excuse or a reason, but the only thing that sounds true is that he doesn’t know anything anymore, that he’ll always hurt Tony no matter what, that he’s stupid and in love and desperate because his affection is so hopelessly unrequited that he needs a new word for it.
They never actually broke up. Tony figured the punches (and the half-destroyed Leipzig airport) cleared things up enough on their own.
He whines at the thought, the memory of going through a rut with Tony there with him and willing still fresh in his mind as though he did it just yesterday.
“I don’t mean to sound disrespectful, Tony, but after I met you, and got to know you a bit, what really struck me wasn’t how much you were like your father, but how much you weren’t.”
It happens in less than a second. If anyone will ask Tony to tell them how this went, he won’t be able to say. One moment he was standing there, close to the side of the bed. A moment later he thinks that he’s grateful for the high quality of the carpet in his room, since he’s being shoved face-first into it by the heavy, naked, sweaty body of his Alpha.
“It was. But I don’t know if we would’ve worked well as a couple, if we could’ve… Sometimes, we were too much in sync. Only when I met Laura did I realize how much I liked to have my vision challenged by someone who had a completely different point of view on most things. Kept me quick-witted, kept me from making huge mistakes. I did the same for her. And Laura and I, we worked hard not to let our differences become incompatibilities.”
The helmet retreats from Tony’s face, and that somehow makes Steve more aware that Tony can see him, that he can see the state he’s in. He’s ashamed. He’s angry. He’s in pain. He thrashes about with his arms.
The pictures Tony’s doctor took of him, naked, pregnant, and with bruised skin from his collarbone to his navel.
Tony takes off his glasses, throws them on the blanket, and presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
He wipes the tear that escaped his self-control and is falling, traitorous, down his cheek. He closes his eyes for a few seconds and breathes.
The floor of Steve’s room—suddenly, something solid under Tony’s feet. He can feel the softness of the carpet even through the suit. He nods his head to the side and the helmet disappears.
“Yes. I trust you. Besides, no one is more qualified. Anyone else is either too inexperienced, too young, not of this planet, not human, a king, retired, recovering, not mentally adjusted, and so on. You know the threat better than anyone. You’ve got this.”
Steve fucks into him as if he needs to punish himself for something invisible to Tony. He falls on top of Tony, covering his naked back with his chest, his breath damp against Tony’s skin. It makes him shiver again, cutting his breath short while his muscles spasm.
Steve feels a warm liquid on his lap, it’s his come trickling out of Tony’s ass. God, Tony’s so full all the time. It’s in him, on him; he needs to take two showers a day. Steve wants to keep him like this as much as possible. Just— dripping with it, and then fill him up again.
Here, they can find the courage to ask the hard questions and be ready to bear the weight of the answer; they can stay calm, keep the anger and the hurt at bay; they can say,
“Hi. Sorry to disturb you,” Tony says politely. “I’ll be just a moment. I just need…” Tony reaches for the top shelf and takes
Except Tony isn’t taking it very well, actually. It’s not that he thought he wouldn’t turn sixty, that he would stay young forever. It’s more that if someone had told thirty-year-old-him that he would actually live to see the day of his sixtieth birthday, he would have laughed in their face. And that’s the thing, really: it’s just hitting Tony now, and hitting him
Steve lifts his head. His face is wet from his nose to his chin, and he feels smug about it, but he blushes too, just a little, because Tony looks at him like he wants to kiss him and lick his mouth clean and that’s—
It’s quiet in the car; Tony’s sitting next to him comfortably, which is all Steve can hope for. Tony looks out of the window a lot, at the trees along the edge of the road, the wheat fields, the vineyards. He checks his phone from time to time, tells Steve where to go.
He grabs Tony’s hips, hard, and Tony moans again. Steve lifts him up just a bit, lines himself up and then guides Tony down on his cock, steady, smooth, all in one go. When he bottoms out, Tony draws a circle with his hips to make sure there’s nowhere further to go.
“The day I kissed her for the first time,” Stella says, ripping Tony away from his memory, “it was her birthday. That night, we had permission from Zio Leonardo to go watch the stars in the woods. The following year, we did it again. It became something… important for us.”
“Shh, there’s no need,” he tries, with a soft voice, “there’s no need. It wasn’t your fault, and I’m okay. I was an ass, I’m sorry.”
“Today we’re going on a little field trip. I’ll be driving.” Natasha gets up from her seat and walks towards the door. Steve also stands, feeling a little out of sorts with leaving the room.
He should have known that nothing about this could remain isolated, idyllic even, as the world bled to pieces. The lab is quiet, the cage that both Steve and Clint have occupied in turns is clean now, waiting for whoever was bitten next. Steve thought it was inevitable that it would happen to someone.
“You mean that? If I wanted to leave you, right now, you would let me go.” Tony is assessing, his emotional state inscrutable to Steve. The anticipation now is almost worse than when he walked in. Tony holds Steve’s future in his hands.
“I think Captain America just came on to me.” Tony returns that smile with a playful smirk of his own, marred only by the smallest amount of apprehension. Steve wants to kiss it away.
how this is supposed to go, and he’ll meet every challenge Steve presents to him. It’s not exactly like that, but he feels the need to prove himself in some way. That he can be
The rest of the Avengers are left arranging transportation and cars, Natasha passing Bruce his bag as he gets into Tony’s car while Clint and Natasha get into hers. He’s done everything to avoid Steve, who is still lingering in the background, seemingly waiting for something. Skirting around Nat, Tony hops into his car.
Finally, he pulls out, and in a fit of possessiveness, he kneels on either side of Tony, his groin to Tony’s face, and offers his wet cock for the other man to clean.
“We’ve got one introduction to do before we start. Captain, this is Tony Stark. He likes solving problems and he’s going to help us track the cube. The only problem he can’t solve is how not to be a complete ass.”
The tower is silent when he arrives, and as he looks over all the modernity in it, he longs for when things were simpler. His mother would have helped him with Tony. Hell, Bucky could have probably charmed Tony into doing what he should. Now he’s just left with pieces of his shattered past and his uncertain future.
A giant flying man whose muscles give the Captain a run for his money bursts into the Quinjet and snatches their prize. Tony, in a fit of pique after being smacked with a comically large hammer, goes after him. No one gets to just bully anyone they want. That’s not okay. He’s the only bully around here.
“Tony, is this hurting you? I can stop—” Oh god, Tony’s channel is so very tight, like silken velvet over his cock, soft and taut.
With one finger in Tony’s ass, he uses the others to rub on Tony’s perineum, causing Tony to whine and lean forward. Steve snatches at his hips and hauls him back onto his finger, before slipping him another.
“I’ll be seeing you, Tony.” Steve is shuffling, the tell-tale sound of pants going up legs, a zipper, and then the stretch of arms as a shirt goes over his head. Tony can’t watch. He can’t watch his Alpha walk away or it will break him. He’ll beg. He knows he would.
That’s the only warning that Tony got before he felt a hand dig itself in on either side of his marginal coverts and Steve’s cock at his entrance. Somehow, Steve caught his cock on the rim of Tony’s hole and got his head in without any assistance. Tony bowed his back, letting the quivering of his wings take him away into a river of pleasure. He floated on it, every inch of Steve inside and surrounding him. It’s like a massage, like getting fucked all over his body, like being turned inside out.
“What?” What could possibly be more important than the continued safety of Steve and as such the happiness of Tony?
They arrive at the gala, and Tony exits the car fairly quickly as a doorman pulls open Steve’s side. Steve steps out, and Tony comes around the side, swooping his arm to hook Steve’s. There’s a photographer who is crouching off to the side, taking picture after flashing picture.
There’s dead silence between Nat and Steve, and she mimics his posture, her arms wrapping around her torso in judgement.
“I soaked the bed with Ty. Every cut he ever gave you, I returned it tenfold.” Tony is drowning in it, he is sinking and never rising. He is evermore happy inside the glutted womb of their love, until Steve asks him to be reborn into the light.
“You gonna stop me?” And that’s when Cap snatches his neck, squeezing down on the sensitive glands. He leaks out a soft and embarrassing
“Steve, can I call you Steve?” Aldrich grasps Steve’s hand, and Tony watches as Killian draws a finger over the gland on Steve’s wrist. It’s the kind of rude that is hard to define. It’s a microaggression, and not something easy to call out. Tony would be incensed, but for the fact that Steve can handle himself.
Tony’s legs come up, exposing himself further to Steve’s ministrations, and Steve smiles into Tony’s warm wetness, delighted that Tony can’t keep up his act.
“Steve, please take me. I’m yours.” Tony’s body is shuddering against him, battering at the windows like a storm.
Steve has considered offering the choice to Tony, but he can’t trust that the man will be reasonable. In the end, even Bucky will support him. This is a kindness to Tony.
“Do not touch me again.” The man’s voice is dangerous, threatening. With hammer in hand, he staggers up, ready to go another round. This is going to be unpleasant.
Tony would look so beautiful if he were pregnant. But that’s a measure of control he’ll give Tony over the situation. Steve trusts that eventually he will want the same things Steve does.
Tony is none of those things. Pepper is and was right to reject him. He’s never had a chance with Steve, and he has to remember, to keep it in mind always, that he never wanted an Alpha either. He’s never wanted the weight of an immutable bond. There was never going to be a time when he didn’t carry the burden of not belonging. Tony lives on the outside of the world, building things for inside of it, his very own dollhouse that he can’t shrink his ego enough to play in.
“Not if you can’t go about this in the usual way. It sounds like you’re coming to me because you need us, not the other way around.”
God. Tony tastes so good, he wants to go down between his cheeks and lap at him. Clean him from top to bottom with his tongue. But he respects the distance between them and pulls up to lay beside Tony, opening his arms for the omega to fall into.
Steve doesn’t wait; he can smell the beginnings of slick and the musky scent of Tony. He devours it all, taking Tony down to the root in one long suck. Tony cries out and humps at his face. Steve lets him but presses Tony’s hips down with his hands. He curves his fingers over them, feeling the delicate bones press against his fingertips down to the hollow where Tony’s legs meet his groin. There’s a heat to Tony, rising off his body like an invisible mist.
“Pepper, let me out.” There’s a dull crash against the door, and it wiggles on its hinges, edges smacking the reinforced metal frame. Pepper is huddling against the wall, her hand clutched to her head, her shirt in disarray. He wants to help, but he isn’t sure if it’s his place and doesn’t know what to do. Steve also feels a pang of jealousy at the idea of Tony attempting to disrobe Pepper.
When he looks up, however, he sees more fighters on the way towards Legolas, and he figures he should give the guy a hand. He takes off, smashing and roaring into Chitauri soldiers, knocking them off the building.
“There’s six pills. Spaced out a week each. He should take them with food. When the last pill hits, he’ll go into a dry heat. Are you ready for that?” They’re at the diner again, JARVIS on blackout. Bucky is obviously agitated. It’s been a week since Tony’s rut, and he’s made the apology rounds per usual, his worn-out face gracing each of their doorways as he mumbles through his sorries and his won’t-happen-again’s that everyone knows will mean nothing come three months from now. This time it feels worn out, the exhaustion seeping into everyone, including Tony.
The next day, he gets a call from SHIELD that there’s an unknown body of slime oozing its way around Central Park. Given the type of crisis, Iron Man is also going to be called in. Steve thinks it’s great that he’s going to have the entire team there for the first time.
The alcohol delivery system he’d rigged together so he didn’t have to remove his mask seemed childish now. Tony wondered why he didn’t just out himself sometimes, but his thoughts always circled back to designation. Omegas were fickle, emotional, flighty creatures with furnished souls.
“Enough with this ma’am nonsense. I’m Edith. Edith Walsh. I took my name back when I ran off from my good for nothin’ alpha, but I used to be an O’Leary, god rest that mean bastard’s soul. Oh pardon! I’ll be saying Hail Mary’s tonight for that.” Steve chokes off a laugh. O’Leary had been her husband!
“Alpha.” Tony says it like a breath, wispy with unrepressed longing. “I want to sit up. I need—” Steve presses his arms under Tony’s torso, fingers catching on the fabric of Tony’s shirt as he rolls his hands underneath. Tony’s body is light, and it’s effortless to lift him, hold him. Tony splays his arms out on either side, helping Steve push Tony the rest of the way up.
“While I can’t see inside your body sir, your outside is clear. The soap is caustic to biological material. You may experience a rash on parts of your body. Estimates on absorption of Omega uteruses give you about an hour before complete absorption of any leftover materials. Though less strict studies have shown up to three hours.”
Sometime after Bucky came to the tower, he and Steve had ceased communicating. No, that’s not quite true. They did talk, with their angry glares, narrowed eyes, alpha fangs distended, and folded arms bulging with unadulterated rage. Which, they’re supposed to be the epitome of friends, the pedestal upon which everyone in the modern world sets their close relationships. Steve
“Hey, I know I am terrible and I accept that. Just one drink, and in front of Loki. It’ll make me feel better,” he wheedles. He doesn’t want the drink specifically, but now that he’s outed as Iron Man to his teammates, putting up a front on his personality doesn’t seem important anymore. What does seem important is liquid courage.
Tony himself is a crying mess, tears scrunched in the corners of his eyes, mouth hanging open as he whines and pants his pleasure out. Steve watches as Tony shoves his shoulders back into the couch to get traction for the pounding that Steve is giving him. It’s as captivating as it is unnecessary, and he hauls Tony down by his thighs so his ass is resting a bit off the cushion. It gives him a slick angle from which he can smash against Tony’s prostate.
“Yeah, and while I’ve been invited, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, Omega. Don’t play well with others.”
He could still hear the guttural, metallic shrieks of the Chitauri soldiers, hear the whir of their speeders coming towards him as he rose up to meet their attack. He remembered the moment he thought that maybe this wouldn’t be as bad. They could shoot fish in a barrel, even if the barrel was New York.
“Captain!” Fury shouts, and Rogers looks over, perplexed, but lets Tony go. Tony takes advantage of the window and bolts. His thoughts are now consumed with anger at Rogers, at himself for being so easy to subdue, for feeling like he has to hide who he is to the rest of the world, including Rogers. Would Rogers have said he was as worthless if he could put on the suit?
“Steve.” Tony pulls away. All of what he wants to say is in that single name, but it doesn’t seem like enough.
“I don’t know what you’re referencing.” Tony gives him a sloppy smirk, as if he knows something Steve doesn’t.
He’s grabbing Tony another drink when he returns to find Tony in the company of a single alpha. The man is tall, like Steve, and blond, but after that, the similarities end. From across the room, Steve can see this man leer at Tony, noting the way he tilts his face just so to catch the scent from Tony’s gland. Steve sees red, and blackness creeps into the corner of his vision as he stalks over to them.
“You hurt him. That happened a little more than a week ago, now. I have yet to see what changes you’ve wrought in the meantime.”
Soon enough, Ma got back home with Thor and Clint felt obliged to tell her what happened. To all of out surprises though, she didn't flip out and try to kill someone but instead smirked. Now, I've known her for long enough to know all her smirks. This was her 'It's okay, I took care of it myself' smirk.
That's better. And sure honey." I may come off bipolar at times but I just have ranging moods. It's just misinterpreted.
Today is so peaceful. I like today. Which reminds me, where's Steve? I don't think he went on the mission with the others
He bolted towards the tub at superhuman speed and dunking his hands in the water, grabs Peter, takes him to his room and lays him on their bed. Still panting and not having recovered the initial shock.
"Borrow if you must, or rent but don't worry it will never leave your person and you can watch me throughout my usage." He tried sounding innocent for Peter but I caught the hints he was dropping.
The baby looked at Daddy with his big blue eyes, then looked at me and back at him. He had eyes exactly like Pops and that's why I liked him, he reminded me of Poppy.
At least I got away from painting for a bit. I mean I love him and all but I liked it when painting was just my thing. Hopefully when the power comes back, he'll grow out of it. Eh, might as well go check on him. Ugh why are there so many stairs!? Ah finally. What the F*¢*!!!!!
"Pops, when will Daddy stop?" Aww, Peter actually looked scared, well Tony is quite scary when he doesn't get his donuts.
Now I'm the kind of person who can't sleep after I've woken up so I decide to try to watch TV hoping that would make me tired. So I went into the living room only to the find the couch occupied by a semi naked Clint and Pietro wearing nothing but boxers and sleeping on each other. I just decide to start my day at 3am...*eye roll*
Okay, I'm gonna do it. I found this cute little place only like ten minutes from the tower and the people seemed really nice. And the place was cool, everyone was wearing very colorful clothes like bright jewelry and even the place itself was popping. My name was called so sat in the chair which weirdly enough had like no mirrors next to it. Maybe they don't believe in mirrors? Is that a thing? Anyway, let's get to it.
A tall handsome man walked into our bedroom wearing a black cloak and a great striped scarf and holding a long stick with something bright shining at the tip. He came with uncle Thor.
"Don't even think about it." I stared her dead in the eyes and watched as the last ounce of dignity she had left were shed. With that I let go, picked up Peter in one hand, grabbed Tony with the other and walked away. I also had to help Clint to hold back Natasha from committing another murder. Bruce had his green vein popping in his forehead and was a balloon pop away from turning. Needless to say, we had successfully lost Thor.
But for Peter its something a little more terrifying, Bath Day! Steve has already run the bath and put the bubbles in but Peter is more reluctant to go than ever. All because he's going through a phase.
"I knew he wouldn't last." I hate her. It was no point asking her. She trotted back to her room so I went back to our bedroom where Steve was while Pete spent time with his Wanda.
"Yeah yeah, whatever. What's up with Cap's shirts?" I went straight to the point. Wait, why is he smirking?
"Hey dad, oh hey everyone" Peter said as he looked over my shoulder to see the rest of the team sitting in the living room.
Tony hasn’t changed entirely, but every morning when he walks into the kitchen, he looks more well-rested than he has in some time. Steve serves him a cup of coffee, handing over the warm glass to Tony’s waiting hands, which aren’t trembling with low blood sugar or otherwise jittery with the need for caffeine. Tony himself is all-too-perfect, hair giving way to feathery waves that have no purposeful direction framing his sleep crusted face. He really is beautiful.
“Maybe I don’t really see the difference. Maybe there isn’t a world where you don’t make me want to see you suffer.” That’s all it takes before Steve empties himself inside Tony with a protracted groan. Steve presses in achingly slow as he spasms. Tony can barely feel it through all the haze of pain, but what he does feel goes deep into him. It stretches him and soothes the frigid air outside his ass with the cum that leaks out.
“Tony, we’ve been calling you repeatedly. He escaped SHIELD custody and caused immense amounts of damage.” Maybe she has a point on the ‘being angry’ thing. It wasn’t the greatest when the kid destroyed a part of his home either, but SHIELD’s problems weren’t his, and now that the kid has served one purpose, he’s thought of a few more.
“I think he wants to be my little fuck toy. Permanently. Don’t you Tony?” Bucky doesn’t bother to look at Tony, instead stepping forward and in front of him in order to block Steve from reaching him.
And how he’s imagined. Tony with his head thrown back, arc reactor fire bright and exposed, gasping convulsively as he rides out his orgasm. It makes the drive home excruciating, but for the syrupy way Tony slouches in the front seat. Compliant. Flawless. Steve takes a moment to swipe a bit of drool that leaches out the side of Tony’s mouth, bringing it to his own for a taste.
They fall asleep like that, Steve slipping out sometime during their snooze, his cum leaking over the both of them.
“Please Steve! Oh god, I can’t!” He takes the time to slide up Tony’s body again, legs between Tony’s, his own already hard cock centered to take Tony’s yielding hole. There’ll be little to no prep otherwise for Tony; Steve needs to watch his Omega jerk and spasm around his cock, to see his eyes roll back into his head with mingled pleasure and pain. Tony will adjust to it, as he’s meant to, and the event will show him that his body responds to Steve. Wants him.
It was here that Tony learned more about his own body than he'd ever imagined he’d know. Here, with Steve beside him, over him, in him, Tony devoted his body to Steve’s care.
“Nothing’s ever set in stone, dearest. Just show him you’re the man you are in here,” she taps his chest, “and he’ll be with you, and everything will be right as rain.”
“Hmm. I’m here, I suppose. I could lend an ear.” Iron Man uncrosses his arms and leaves them loose at his side.
Now, Tony is strapped into a machine that he might never come unstuck from. It’s absurd for Steve to even try, but if it were Clint, Natasha would be doing the same.
“Oh, there are herbs you can take to make your bleeding happen. My Ma happened to know. She taught me, and I taught the other omegas. Though, you could only pretend at that for so long before your alpha would think something was wrong with you. Some of us chose to give in and have children. That made it harder to leave. For me, I didn’t last more than a year with Conall.”
Since then, a lot of the agitation had drained from his friend’s body, like having a knot had solidified that Bucky would recover and become something of the man he once was. Steve was just happy to have his friend back.
“Let’s play a little game. Tell me one time where you’ve done amazing things in regards to Tony. Then tell me something he has done that you didn’t like or made you angry. Next, tell me about some of the bad things you’ve done to Tony.”
“Which is why it’s so weird they didn’t pull me into work on the Tesseract in the first place. You gotta ask yourself what’s the reason if they knew they needed lots of energy, which I have.” Tony’s had enough of being dismissed.
“We’ve secured the perimeter, but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.” Hips were not supposed to lie like that, Tony thought.
Unlike Steve, Bucky runs his hands up and down Tony’s back, lingering at the sides of his torso and at his hips. Less a rub and more of a caress. The second Tony realizes it, he feels his body lock up. Bucky doesn’t seem to notice as he continues stroking Tony on areas that can be best described as intimate.
“Adopt? Mate? Tony, there are terrorist cells more nurturing than I am,” her face softened, and she continued, “that’s lovely of you to say, but I’m happy with how I am. And not because I was forced to accept it.”
“Just my two cents, Cap.” Iron Man turns on his repulsors and soars off without answering any more of his questions.
“I want to ride you.” Tony’s body jerks forward, his cock bumping into Steve’s, and just like that, all his focus drops into his cock, and reveals his own desperation to be used. With it comes a certain pride; Tony trusts him for this. Trusts him to be the alpha he needs to see him through this heat. He’s denied the other man affection, care, all in the name of correcting behavior, when that was never how it was supposed to be. Steve is a protector, an instrument of Tony’s pleasure, the truth of which now comes down on him like a lash, driving him to
It’s not about switching sides. Steve doesn’t even think there are sides anymore. It’s about what’s familiar.
He’s not sure why he’s drawn to do it. In perspective, Nat said that she was on Tony’s side, and that Tony wanted Steve. Which, he could see it now. Scent it even.
He’s shushed with a kiss, Steve working his lips over Tony’s, kissing corner to corner before licking into the press of his mouth. Tony opens easily under him, his tongue coupling with Steve’s. They press into each other, teasing and testing, before Tony has to turn his head to the side to gasp.
“Just going to work on some things on the tablet here. I need you to prep food for the next few days. Easy things to make, because I’m going to be hungry and not very capable of feeding myself. Lots of orange juice, fruits, cheeses, cold meats. Finger foods mostly. Can you do that?”
Steve makes short work of Tony’s pants, which are already loose enough to slide off his hips with minimal resistance. His briefs fall with them, and Tony tries to cover himself with his hands, but Steve is quick to pull his wrists away, pinning them to Tony’s sides.
“You were once an omega yourself. How did you ever justify doing to Tony the things you did when you knew what it was like?”
“In 1935 the institution rate for omegas in their lifetime was around 17%. There were 127.1 million people in the United States at the time. Of those, 41% were omegas. That’s 52.1 million omegas. The amount of omega suicides in 1935 were 270,000. Suicide attempts that resulted in institutionalization were at 1.1 million. That is more than an epidemic; it was a disease upon our society. When you have to have whole facilities devoted to the care of suicidal omegas, something is wrong. Do you understand that 8.1 million omegas died throughout the early 20th century?”
, burying himself into Tony’s body. Tony blinks, like he’s waking up from deep sleep, and he reaches out, wrapping his arms around Steve’s shaking frame.
The next day he gets up at his usual 0600 and goes for a run. When he gets back, he notes that Tony’s door is opened and the bed is not ruffled in the slightest. Which means that he’s still down in the workshop. Steve decides that he’s going to make this easier on himself and bring down a plate of breakfast for Tony. He’s not looking for a fight today.
“Qualified? And what about you being a former weapons manufacturer who uses money to buy redemption makes you
“Get that thing out of me or I’m going to stick this repulsor so far up your ass, you’ll look like a Vorothian whale when I’m done with you.”
Now maybe Loki is in their heads right now, maybe not. But Tony can’t see why anyone should be listening to SHIELD or their operatives at all at this point. Fury is like the one eyed wizard in a fantasy novel, preaching about woe and all the variety of things that lead to a monocular life as a paranoid person. This time he’s blaming Thor. Thor, who apparently tore up a New Mexican town for funsies with Loki.
before he starts to pull out from under the Captain’s grip, but the man has him solidly in his hands, and Tony
Tony gasps as Bucky presses his hips against Tony’s, and he feels the outline of Bucky’s erection grinding against his crack. It’s thick, and Bucky slides it just so. As Tony looks forward onto the blank countertop, stunned, he can see his hands tremble. If there was nothing between them, what’s to stop Bucky from just burying it into him?
“Caring for someone is not a deficiency, Nat. If you were in the same position as Tony, I would care what’s happening to you.” His voice is as level as he can get it, his pitch low. Steve keeps whisking the pancake batter, using action to hide how he feels inside as best as he can.
“Maybe just sit down and relax with me for a moment?” Tony cocks his head as if the thought has never occurred to him that he can sit down. But after a moment, Tony haltingly finds his way to the couch next to Steve. There’s a brief moment where Steve thinks Tony is scenting him in the air, and he feels triumph roll through him, hot and pressing.
“You’re right. It’s definitely not.” This is something he can dump, get rid of. He’s just trying to think of reasons why he shouldn’t, and the one he’s come up with makes him queasy to think about.
They sleep then, for an hour or two, Steve doesn’t know, until Tony wakes up again and starts crawling over to Steve.
“See? There. Oh–” Steve gasped as he pulled the helmet off, dropping it in shock, his cheeks pinking as his eyes went dark. Tony’s cloying omega scent filled the room as if it had never not been there. Averting his eyes away from Steve, Tony cowered on the ground.
Tony with a violent slant that Steve didn’t know was inside him. Tony keens, stuffed as full as Steve can manage, fuller even than the first time Steve took him. His cock pumps and pumps away at Tony, sluicing his hot channel with so much come, Steve is all but swimming in it. He falls forward onto Tony, his sweat-slick chest pressing onto Tony’s equally sweat-streaked back, and it’s like gliding down a long slide, slipping into deep water.
Her husband also raped her. He waited until she was in the throes of heat and he took advantage. In the same way that Steve would be taking advantage of Tony. He feels so sick to his stomach.
He doesn’t linger, though he very much wants to. Omegas are too tempting by half. The scent is positively overwhelming now, and he wants to keep licking and sucking at the gland. Technically it’s within his rights. He could mouth at Tony’s throat for a good while before laying on a bite, or he could bite Tony, then take him home and scent him to his heart’s content.
“No. I’m not going to take it. Anthony needs a keeper. I would be failing my friend if I allowed him to go on like this.” It’s decided. Anthony is not going to like this, he can already tell. The man is vibrating with pent up energy, tapping his fingers on his leg while his eyes twitch and his brows furrow.
“Good. Great. No biting my gland a second time. I know it’s traditional in the first heat, but I don’t want it. No matter how much I beg, you can’t do it. Can you do that for me?” Tony is down to his undershirt and boxers, and he pulls a leg up to take a sock off before doing the same with the other leg.
“Clean me.” Steve takes the fingers into his mouth and sucks the spend off of them, then he takes Tony’s sticky and flaccid cock into his mouth, licking away the remnants of lube and come. He mouths at the fluid that’s made its way down Tony’s balls, feeling the sting of humiliation at the cool and bitter flavor.
“He’s got nothing I haven’t seen, Rogers.” Rhodes barrels past him into Steve’s nondescript room. Tony is nude under the covers, eyes flickering as he goes through REM. When Rhodes lays a kind hand on Tony’s bare shoulder, Steve feels a glint of jealousy. He drives it down, knowing that no matter what, his claim is secure over Tony. He’s the only Alpha that will ever fuck Tony.
“I’d love to tell you that this contract isn’t airtight, but Howard’s legal team has always been thorough. It’s not a bad idea on his end, all things considered. No one ever expected… well.” Right. No one had thought that Captain America was alive, and thus either of them having to endure the rigid terms of this contract. Anthony could stay married, his assets secure, without ever having them interfered with.
It unhooks from him, drags itself across his spine, down into the curl of his hips and the weight of his groin and explodes into frantic pulses of his cock, every spurt a revelation of feeling. He cries Steve’s name, and the Alpha presses tightly into him and comes along with him, the pulses of Tony’s inner muscles almost in synchronization with Steve’s own. Steve groans, counterpoint to Tony’s breathy mewls, and pulls Tony close to him, rubbing their bodies in the mess Tony has made between them.
“About time. I thought I was going to have to wait all morning for princess kitty to get out of bed.”
He’s not a very good shot, and the branch lands somewhere off to the left of the wolf, which just looks at him instead of even considering that the branch could harm it. That is not good at all. He just knows that the wolf is thinking about eating him.
Pepper has a hair extension in from where he got a hold of a large tuft of her hair. She also has an entirely new set of heels for every day of the month. Steve thinks it’s vulgar to buy someone’s forgiveness, but he understands that Tony doesn’t know how to be emotionally available and he can’t promise he won’t do it again. Now that Bucky is on board, Tony won’t have to deal with these erratic mood swings in rut. His heat will make him tractable. Steve imagines that Tony will be sweet, the kind of Omega who wants to cuddle and be touched. Tony hasn’t had enough of that in his life.
“I’ve always been Hydra. And you could out me, but it’s your word against mine. Besides, don’t you think the world would be a more interesting place with Hydra in it, and you at its helm? With me?”
Clint in particular looks like he wants to pull Steve’s guts through his open mouth, the way he’s staring at Steve being something close to maniacal in nature.
Steve hears the soft hum of the repulsor tech as it swoops up behind him. With a soft click, Tony’s metal boots hit the cragged and broken ground, and he walks up to stand next to Steve. As Steve turns to look, Tony’s eyes are backlit in a swirling orange from the reflected flames of the Triskelion. His features are cast in sharp shadows that flicker across his perfect face.
“He has enough fluids, but he needs bed rest, and proper food. I’m not sure what is causing the stress. You would know that better than I, but don’t let him get worked up. Get him what he says he needs and we shouldn’t have any more problems.”
“I honestly just wanted him to be able to take care of himself, but instead he ended up not eating. And now I just—well, you don’t have to listen to my problems,” Steve finishes lamely.
“That’s what I said. God, why are you so boring? I go into screensaver mode like every time you talk.”
Tony tosses aside the letter, but grabs it again and folds it up, shoving it into his nightstand. Maybe he’s being sentimental, but he can do that now, can’t he? Steve would understand.
“I’m never that desperate to fuck anything with tentacles, and I think you very well know why you don’t do this to humanoids. Yuck, I’m going to have to get checked out for this. Do you even have the engine?”
