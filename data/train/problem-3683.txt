Dean parks the car and turns the ignition off, killing the headlights and sending them further into darkness. Cas grabs a blanket from the backseat and lays it on down the ground, smoothing it out before climbing on top of it, stretching out on his back. Dean joins him immediately, pressing up close against his side, and Cas wraps an arm around him, giving Dean’s shoulder a gentle squeeze. He drinks in Cas’ warmth, enjoying the grounding presence that Cas provides while taking in the endless sea of stars above, and feels his racing mind settle for a moment.
There is a burst of white light as Dean uses the last of his strength to push the both of them over the threshold of the Empty and back into the bunker. He thinks he blacks out for a second; when he comes to, he’s sprawled on the floor, his ears ringing loudly. Dean scrambles to sit up, releasing a breath when he sees Cas a couple feet away, pushing himself up onto his forearms.
When he speaks again, it comes out as a low whisper, something like reverence coloring his voice. “Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.”
“We both love flowers,” Florence elaborates, and Arthur nods. “I was a plant biologist before I retired. I love all plants, of course, but my specialty was flowering plants.”
that he was looking in the mug section for any reason in particular.) He picks it up, taking in the two angel wings that bracket the word “angel” and the cheesy love hearts scattered around the rest of the mug. He debates for all of ten seconds before putting it resolutely into his cart.
Dean has just finished applying a thick layer of cream cheese frosting over the tops of the rolls when Cas returns, a small bag from the gardening shop in town as well as a couple larger ones from the grocery store in his arms. Dean hopes he remembered to get those pretzels that he likes this time.
Dean can only muster a small shake of his head. Even that feels like too much of an acknowledgement and Dean can feel his throat start to close and twist around itself again, whatever tears he has left threatening to leak from his eyes, spill from his heart. He hears Sam take a quick, labored intake of breath, as he always does when he takes an emotional blow. That’s the only sound he makes; he doesn’t start crying, though Dean knows Cas’ death hits him hard. Dean’s grateful for it, grateful that one of them is able to keep their shit together right now, because Dean sure as hell can’t.
Truthfully, Dean knows that he will be. Sam is more than capable of handling himself, especially with Eileen by his side, but there’s still a part of Dean that will always see him as his baby brother. As someone he needs to be there for, to protect.
The abrupt shift in Cas’ tone, from playful and flirtatious to innocent and questioning, gives Dean mild whiplash.
A pleasant warmth radiates in Dean’s chest, deepening his smile. He had forgotten how awesome it feels to make food for people.
Cas fills the kitchen cabinets with a frankly obscene number of mugs. Whenever Dean comments on it, Cas just makes a vague statement about how they’re “for their future guests”, which doesn’t even make any sense because they only have two bedrooms with room for two people each. Dean is pretty sure that four guests aren’t going to require twenty-something mugs for their morning coffee, but he wisely doesn’t mention that.
Dean isn’t entirely sure how to articulate the fact he was able to find him because his love for Cas was apparently just that strong, that
It had become a weekly routine for Dean to get up early with Mary on Sunday mornings to help her make the pancakes. Every week, he would reach his small little hands into the bowl of fresh blueberries and drop them down, one by one. Every week, he would stain his fingers and hands and face
It’s beautiful in its wildness. Dean’s certainly no expert in flowers, but he recognizes a few; a burst of red roses below a front window, an explosion of multicolored pansies near one edge of the fence. Tall pink and purple flowers that Dean doesn’t know the name of stand proudly among lower growing bushes full of flowers of seemingly every shape and color imaginable. It’s as if someone had scattered hundreds of seeds of every variety they could find and just let them all grow, untamed and spectacular.
Dean is quiet for a moment, remembering that he had planned to talk to Cas about moving back to the bunker when he got home. Surprisingly, he finds that he can’t recall much of the speech that he wrote in his head earlier.
“Cas, I need to know that we’ll see each other again,” Dean says through choked-out sobs. “I need you to tell me that we will. Because I’m so afraid of dying, Cas. I’m so scared that I won’t see you again.”
The three of them regroup in the center of the room, back to back to back, surrounded by the remaining vampires.
The house looks about the same as when they first saw it, though all of the furniture that was there before has been removed. Dean steps inside, his shoes echoing loudly against the wood of the floor.
“Me too, Cas,” Dean says. Cas is home to him too, he realizes; wherever Cas goes, he will follow. Dean smiles at Cas, feeling as light as air, buoyed on the balloon of happiness that has expanded in his chest, so full he feels like he could burst open. The sensation chokes him up. “Me too.”
Dean doesn’t think he’s had homemade pancakes since then. Since his childhood. He’s had pancakes, of course 𑁋 pancakes from shitty diners on the side of no-name roads in the middle of Nowhere, Midwest, USA. He’s probably even eaten those shitty diner pancakes 𑁋 which are always too floppy, soaked within an inch of their life in fake, horribly sweet maple syrup 𑁋 on Sunday mornings before, but it just isn’t the same. Dean could probably have made pancakes once they moved into the bunker, but it had never felt . . . right, somehow, to take the time to make and eat pancakes when they always had something else on their plates.
Cas takes the bottom of his shirt in his teeth and rips a strip of cloth away. Dean tries very hard not to find it hot as fuck – he could literally die at any moment – but he fails spectacularly.
Sam and Eileen arrive a couple of days later, and Dean immediately pulls both of them in for a hug as soon as they walk through the front door. They’ve visited relatively frequently during the two years that Dean and Cas have lived in Vermont – every couple of months or so, as well as holidays – but Dean’s always glad to see them.
red and purple with the juice. His mother never said anything about the mess, though, or at least Dean doesn’t ever remember her getting upset. He only recalls her fond, loving smile, the curtain of her soft blonde hair, her bright laugher as Dean made wonky smiley-faces and wobbly hearts with the blueberries.
He sets the bowl full of batter aside and grabs a frying pan from a large, deep drawer to the right of the stove. While Dean waits for the pan to heat up, he grabs another bowl and steps out of the door in the kitchen, entering the back garden. Although it’s slightly smaller than the garden out front, it is no less beautiful or lacking in life. Dean loves this garden because this is where Cas grows fruits and vegetables and, more recently due to Dean’s complaining about the lack of rosemary at the local grocery store, an herb garden, and he uses Cas’ bounty in his recipes nearly every day. Dean finds the blueberry bush and picks a whole bunch of the fat berries, placing them carefully into the bowl. He can’t help sneaking a taste of one, and he gives a pleased hum in enjoyment of the taste 𑁋 it’s perfectly ripe, firm, and bursting with flavor.
Oh, Dean is going to do a lot of things about it, most of them involving activities he’s certain Sam doesn’t want to be present for.
Suddenly, Dean becomes anxious that Cas hates it, that it was a completely stupid purchase, God, he shouldn’t have bought it –
“Dean,” Sam says. The light is flipped on, a flare of warm yellow cutting through the cool darkness, and Dean has to blink multiple times to adjust his eyes. Sam is standing in his doorway, still wearing the clothes he was wearing earlier, a large, heavy-looking book in his arms. There’s a glint in his eyes despite the pronounced bags beneath them, and he’s wearing an expression that looks hopeful, earnest.
Cas plants all sorts of things, from magnolias to hollyhocks to poppies. He tells Dean about each new flower variety that he grows, and Dean listens happily to the passion in Cas’ voice, not entirely remembering everything Cas says. Cas informs him all about the average heights, water needs, and colors of each flower, as well as their preferences for direct, indirect, or no sunlight. Dean has no idea how he manages to keep track of all that information, so one day he randomly buys Cas a notebook with a bee on the cover so that he can record everything he learns about flowers in it. Cas looks so ridiculously happy when Dean gives it to him later that day that Dean wonders why he didn’t think to do it sooner.
– onto the stretch of mattress between them and opens it up, gently turning the pages until he reaches whatever it is he wants to show Dean. There’s a sort of vibrating energy coming off of Sam; it’s like how he gets when he’s figured out a bit of important information that ultimately helps them to finish off a hunt. Despite the feeling of utter hopelessness that has been winding its tendrils around Dean since Cas was taken, rooting him to his bed since he crawled in it hours ago, he finds himself sitting up, curious.
And so their days go, as they carve themselves out a new life together, a new beginning, in the Vermont countryside.
“Because I would never be able to find Cas in the first place, right,” Dean interrupts. He can’t help it; he’s gone over this in his head hundreds of times at this point, the futility of trying to rescue Cas from the Empty, worrying it like a loose tooth, unable to stop himself from poking and prodding at the soreness. If Sam is irritated by Dean’s interruption, though, he doesn’t let on.
They are both silent as they mount the stairs up to the main floor of the bunker, every step Dean takes feeling heavier and heavier, as if there are weights tied to his ankles. Dean’s mind feels simultaneously empty and also full of disjointed thoughts, but all of it coalesces into an overwhelming sense of loss. He feels hollow, like Cas had taken a part of Dean with him to the Empty when he died, which maybe he had. Cas had held his heart in his hands for years, Dean realizes as they reach the landing. Dean had given it to him without knowing he had. He holds a hand over his chest and Dean is almost surprised to feel that his heart is still there, still beating.
“Love is one of the most powerful forms of magic, Dean,” Sam continues. “Maybe . . . maybe just feeling like a part of you is still with Cas is enough.”
Later, Cas calls to Dean from the bathroom. Pulling Cas from the Empty had seemingly stripped away the last of Cas’ grace, though Cas doesn’t seem too torn up about it. He’d just given Dean a small, quiet smile as he shrugged his shoulders, asked if he could use the bathroom, and that was that.
Dean picks up the primrose from his bedside table and holds it delicately in his hands, thinking about how Cas could also very well have died if they’d continued hunting. He knows that he wouldn’t be able to live without Cas either, knows that it would have absolutely gutted him if Cas were to have died prematurely in a hunting accident.
“Don’t worry, Sammy. It’ll be fine,” Dean says, handing Sam the empty flask and taking a step closer to the whirling portal to the Empty. It’s false bravado, obviously, just an old reflex in order to try and comfort Sam. By the tightness in Sam’s eyes, Dean knows Sam can see straight through his bullshit, as always. Sam gives him a small smile anyways.
They get to watch Bobby grow up, and Dean can hardly believe it when it comes time for him to go off to college. Dean’s a complete and utter mess when they say their goodbyes. He makes Bobby swear to visit them soon, trying valiantly to blink away his tears before they fall, and Bobby laughs fondly and promises that he will, pulling them both in for a hug. Cas teases him relentlessly about it the rest of the day, but Dean finds him hunched over the sink in their bathroom that night, crying quietly into his hands.
“When you said Cas had taken a piece of you with him when he went to the Empty, it got me thinking. What if there was some actual truth to that?”
“What’s his name?” Cas asks, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to his temple. Sam and Eileen had refused to tell them what name they had chosen all throughout Eileen’s pregnancy, much to Dean’s annoyance.
Dean hears Sam give a small sigh through the phone. When he speaks again, his tone is gentler, more sincere.
“So . . . you like them, then?” Dean asks. It’s kind of obvious that Cas does, though, and Dean can feel the wide smile that blooms on his face at that knowledge. It hurts his cheeks a little bit.
Getting to watch Bobby grow up is one of the greatest joys of Dean’s life. Dean and Cas dote on him endlessly, and Dean takes immense pride in knowing that he’s helping to give Bobby the kind of childhood he wished he had, one filled to the brim with love and family.
Cas settles into the chair across the table from him, stirring sugar into his own cup of coffee. He takes a drink and sighs contentedly, leaning back in his seat before focusing his gaze on Dean. “Very interesting. Go on.”
been their home for so long – Dean’s home isn’t here, not anymore. It’s with Cas, and Sam and Eileen. Home is wherever they are.
Cas slowly blinks awake a while later. His hair is sticking up all over the place and he has a slightly confused, half-asleep furrow to his brow that Dean finds ridiculously endearing. Cas’ eyes find his, and a small, sleepy smile spreads over his mouth.
Cas smiles back at him, radiant and perfect, even with the flecks of blood on his face and in his hair.
“Yes, well –” Cas says, cutting himself off as he steps forward to slash at a vamp, decapitating it after a few moments of dodging and weaving around it. “Twelve!”
His blueberries collected, Dean makes his way back into the house. He sets the blueberries next to the bowl of batter before slicing a generous square of butter into the frying pan. He picks up the pan and swirls the butter around until the bottom is completely coated, just like his mother had done.
It’s a perfect name, as far as Dean’s concerned. He reaches up to adjust the beanie on Robert’s – Bobby’s, Dean decides – head, knitted by Cas in a soft, bright yellow wool. Bobby reaches a tiny hand up towards him, and Dean, a little unsure of what to do, offers his index finger to him. Bobby grabs it and holds on, and Dean’s heart feels so full that he fears it might burst right out of his chest.
of the bloodsucking bastards, and Sam, Dean, and Cas are currently standing in the warehouse they’d been hiding out in, completely surrounded.
I am. But I’m just – I’m really happy for you. You’re finally doing something for yourself, you know?” Sam pauses for a moment. Dean has no idea what to say to that, so he doesn’t say anything.
Cas is standing at the window that looks out over the front of the house. Dean sidles over, stopping just behind him to rest his chin on Cas’ shoulder, wanting to touch him, wanting to feel his warmth. Cas gives a pleased hum.
Dean turns outward, backing up slowly until his shoulders are touching both Sam’s and Cas’. They form a small, tight triangle, each of them protecting the backs of the other two. Dean fidgets with the ring on his left finger as he raises the blade in his right hand into a defensive position. Cas unsheathes the long knife hidden under his trench coat, his free hand finding Dean’s own and giving it a gentle squeeze.
is emblazoned across the cover in a large, red font, and multiple brightly colored sticky notes adorn the edges of the pages. It’s the cookbook Cas got him several months ago when Dean was just about at his breaking point, unable to cope with the feeling of uselessness that plagued him in their semi-retirement from hunting. It’s through this book that Dean found a new way to make the world a better place – cooking for others, nourishing them. Whether it’s for their guests, Sam and Eileen, or just Cas, he loves it. He loves creating things with his hands, his hands that, before, he had only seen as weapons fit for nothing but destruction.
Dean pulls Cas into a tight hug when he enters the bedroom a few minutes later and doesn’t let go for a long while. Cas melts into it, wrapping his hands around Dean’s neck and burying his face into his chest. They just stand there for a moment, wrapped in each other, and Dean feels so, so thankful that he’s alive to experience this.
Dean and Cas watch as Florence and Arthur get into their car, waving at them as they drive away until they’re nothing but a speck in the distance, leaving behind only a large cloud of dust in their wake. And just like that, they’re gone, leaving Dean and Cas standing alone on the front porch of a brand new life.
of Cas’ death, out loud. It scares him a frankly ridiculous amount to think of saying it, because he knows he won’t be able to hide from his feelings anymore if he does. Another part of him, the part that lives tucked in the corner of his mind along with all of those fantasies about Cas, urges him to speak. For the first time in years, he lets that part of him – the emotional, raw, vulnerable part of him – win. Besides, Dean already feels like Sam knows anyways. The fresh handprint on his jacket, the one that has long since faded on his shoulder, they feel like a brand, showcasing to anyone who bothered to truly look at Dean that Cas had loved him, that Dean was Cas’, and Cas’ alone.
“Cas, I- I’ve never been with a, I mean, I’ve thought about it, but I never had, never knew how to-” Dean sighed. “Fuck it.”
Cas reached out, cradling Dean’s face in a far more intimate way than his traditional two-finger healing tap. Dean leaned into the touch, holding back a whine in his throat.
“I thought you said I wasn’t any fun?” Cas was smirking, honestly smirking, and it was almost too endearing to stand.
Cas stared at him from across the small table, lit candle flickering between them and casting shadows on their faces in the dimly lit restaurant. At every turn, this cruise was reminding them that it was designed for couples in love.
“Hey folks, this is your Captain speaking. My apologies for the roughness just now, but we seem to be headed into some weather, and it might get worse. It’s a little late in the year for hurricanes, but smaller storms and tropical depressions can still crop up from time to time.”
He slid into bed slowly, trying not to move the mattress too much. His body was rigid with nerves as he laid still, flat on his back. Dean scooted closer, putting an arm around Cas’ midsection as if he were a replacement for the pillow he’d been snuggled into before. They were practically sharing a pillow as Cas felt Dean’s breath on his neck, evening out into slow, soft snores as he fell back asleep. With Dean here, wrapped around him, it was difficult to even remember the paralyzing fear from only minutes before. Castiel shut his eyes and relaxed his body. He could finally rest.
“First question,” Lorne announced, shaking Dean from his reverie. “What is your partner’s favorite movie?”
A woman and a man had stopped in front of them, the woman with her hand outstretched. Her deep red hair caught the last rays of the sun. “It’ll be easier to see the background from farther away.”
The night before, Dean had eventually fallen asleep, only to wake this morning to a note from Cas on the bedside table.
He jerked up, coughing a little as he inhaled some of the liquor rather than swallowed. Kira Leigh and Andrew were a few steps behind him on the sand, carrying towels and a large beach umbrella. She wore a long green tank top over her bikini, printed with a pickle in a top hat and monocle and the caption,
It took most of his willpower to drag himself out of bed and into the shower. As the water soaked his hair, he got small flashes from the night before, like a damn “previously on” montage from the soap opera of his life. The drinking, the affectionate touches, the kiss...Cas pushing him away.
Cas leaned back to the edge of the hot tub with a sigh, his toned arms supporting his body as sweat rolled down his neck and onto his chest. Dean found himself grateful for the bubble jets surrounding them as his body responded in kind. There was only so much a man could take.
Dean’s heart was racing now, sweat forming on his neck as he looked down the barrel of the camera lens. It would look utterly bizarre to make a real run for it from the photographer rather than kiss his supposed partner, but the option was still front and center in his mind.
“Yeah,” the man who must be Jeff answered. “It’s kinda like that old game show, The Newlywed Game? But sudden death style. A bunch of couples start out, answering questions about each other. When you get a question wrong, you’re dropped from the game. Last couple standing wins.”
Castiel had appeared at the side of the pool, reaching in and helping pull the woman out. Mascara ran down her face, but otherwise she seemed no worse for wear, if rather wet.
He looked between Sam and Cas, helplessly outvoted. “I thought...Sam and I would just board the ship, pretending to be a couple, but I’d
Cas’ fingers grew tighter, squeezing Dean’s thigh as he shifted closer. The inches between them now were the longest he’d ever faced. Dean thought he may just stay there forever, caught in suspended animation as he took in Cas’ face, so close again.
When they’d dressed (it was so strange how Dean no longer had to limit his moments staring at Castiel; he apparently now had an open invitation to ogle), they made their way to the upper decks for an early swim. They were surprised to see a dock, land, and buildings off the side of the ship, though not the port they’d departed from nearly a week ago.
Dean moved in quickly before he could blow their cover. Cas looked down at Dean’s hand, which found itself affectionately placed on his chest. Dean cleared his throat. “Yes, he’s, uh. He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?”
As the two of them finally broke off from the crowd and made it to their cabin’s hallway, the ship pitched again and knocked them sideways. Dean’s back hit the wall and Cas’ body landed on his, knocking the breath out of his chest. Cas began to right himself before the ship shifted further still and held his weight, pinning them both to the wall. And
Dean blinked hard, trying to bring the room into focus. His head was pounding, and his mouth was dry, and it took a blissful thirty seconds for him to remember what happened.
He was almost bitter that after all this time, spending the night (however innocently) with Cas for the first time was something he barely remembered. Now that he’d been so close, so intimate with him, he felt robbed now that Cas was no longer in his arms.
He rubbed his eyes and massaged his temples, as if he could erase Cas from his thoughts, make this easy again. When he looked up again, the angel had reappeared at Dean’s side, his heroism quota apparently filled for the night.
The really shit thing of it all was that he knew Cas wouldn’t judge him, might not even turn him away if Dean would just spit it out, just make a move. But that wouldn’t stop Dean from finding a way to ruin the only good relationship he had besides Sam, who, for better or worse, seemed stuck with him at this point. So here they would stay. Castiel wasn’t his, but at least he was
“Uh, thanks,” he told Cas with a shaky grin as he pulled the coat tighter around him. Cas’ scent enveloped him, and it was actually more comforting than terrifying. “I’d better get back to the room and change.”
He barely had time to get out words of complaint before he felt the trenchcoat being gently placed around his shoulders.
Dean thought Cas climbing into bed to comfort him had been just another dream. Clearly, he was wrong.
Dean rolled his eyes, taking Cas’ other hand and putting the metal cracker into it. He guided it around the crab leg, closing his own hand around Cas’ and squeezing until he heard the exterior armor
Dean shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t like being put on display so easily when he worked hard to keep his guard up.
Cas took a long pause before responding, and Dean wished more than anything that he could decipher what conflict lived within it.
He gave a little smile and turned to leave. Before he realized what he was doing, Dean had reached out and caught Cas’ wrist. Cas looked down at their hands, then back at Dean. His eyebrows grew ever so slightly closer together as he tried to understand.
“You were drunk,” Cas replied, as if that explained everything. “I didn’t know if that was just some inebriated experiment to you—and then when you said it meant nothing—”
When they reached the embarkation point, Dean shut the Impala’s back door as he hoisted his duffel bag out. He’d dressed for the occasion in sunglasses and a button-down red Hawaiian shirt, even leaving his worn boots in the backseat and trading them for sandals. In contrast, Cas stood in his regular attire, trenchcoat and all.
He began to swim to the edge of the pool nearest them when something else caught his eye. Laid out on a reclining pool chair with a paperback book was Cas, nearly unrecognizable in short blue swim trunks Dean had packed. The size was unintentional (they were the only pair Dean could dig up in the bunker that didn’t seem to belong to him or Sam), but they were doing Cas plenty of favors as the fabric gripped his thighs. Under the layers, Dean had always imagined Castiel as rather slender, pale, the Holy Tax Accountant. He found it hard not to stare once he realized that wasn’t the case. Cas was...fit. How was he tan when his legs never saw the sun?
Of course he’d looked at Cas before, wondering what those deep stares toward him meant, even if his self-preservation prevented him from thinking too much about it. Realizing how much the angel had changed and done for them (well,
Dean was trembling. He forced his eyes closed for a moment, trying to break the influence Cas’ stare had on him. When he opened them, Cas hadn’t budged, and he found himself drowning.
He sighed, shaking his head as if he could erase the images in his mind like an Etch-a-Sketch. Only when he raised his head above water did he realize the waves had carried him quite far from the beach without him noticing. The people on the sand were too small for comfort, sending a twinge of anxiety through him as he began to paddle back.
Dean dug in his duffel bag and came out with a loose white linen shirt and khaki shorts, tossing them at Cas. “See how those fit.”
Dean arched his back a little more, inching his way under the limbo bar with millimeters between it and the skin of his nose. Cheers erupted around him as he cleared it and straightened himself on the other side.  A gorgeous blonde he’d never seen before put a lei around his neck after he rose. He flashed her a smile, the kind he knew from experience could be described as ‘knee-weakening’.
An older man and woman were looking at him with something close to terror. The man took a tiny step forward before speaking in a shaking voice. “You were out pretty far. We were riding our jet ski and… we tried to swerve, but we didn’t have enough time. We hit you.”
Dean thought carefully about how to answer this one. Given the circumstances, neither of them really had, at least not in the way the question intended. But Dean remembered Cas, bleeding out on the ground in that barn, looking at him when he said “I love you,” before looking at Sam and Mom and continuing with “I love all of you.” Dean had wondered, then, at being singled out, but had shoved it down like he did everything that wasn’t easy to address. But now, it was their only chance. He wrote down his answer and turned the card over. Castiel had already done the same.
When he resurfaced, Dean turned onto his back, floating while small waves lapped at his face. The light breeze danced over the moisture and tickled his skin. The sounds of the crowd on the beach were muted by the water covering his ears, leaving him alone with his thoughts. Again.
While the last few days weren't exactly the rest and relaxation Dean hoped for, being on vacation at all still felt strange. Foreign.
The bunker had private toilets, but the Men of Letters who constructed it apparently never saw fit to include showers with them. The showers were in their own room, a row of three stalls on a tile floor with drains under each. Cas pushed open the shower room door and was met with a room full of steam, through which he could see the shape of Dean standing under the water. The stall’s curtain sat open; Dean had clearly not expected anyone to interrupt him.
Dean could only kiss him back in response, deeply, tenderly, trying to pour the last five years of escalating feelings into it. When they finally broke apart, Cas leaned in and rested their foreheads together. Dean didn’t know what came next between them, didn’t know if they could overcome his fear of fucking this up. This was just a first step, and he hoped that all the talking, categorizing, overanalyzing of whatever their relationship had just become could be delayed as long as possible. God knew words were hard enough for the two of them, but this, holding Cas and kissing him and never wanting to let go...
“Maybe it took the end of the world...again,” Dean said, “for me to finally take my head out of my ass. I want this. Have wanted this, for...too long. So please, just…”
He placed kisses along Cas’ jawline and moved back to his throat, feeling the blood rushing under his lips at the pulse point. Cas responded by tilting his head and grazing his teeth along the curve of Dean’s ear.
Cas’ brow furrowed, but as that was something of a default expression for him, it didn’t serve as a warning that he was about to turn and ask Dean a question.
Cas was blinking, his hair tousled, looking at Dean with something that could be mistaken for affection.
A man had ambushed them, tugging Cas toward a starry backdrop set up against a nearby wall. A camera stood in front of it, ready to capture manufactured memories.
Cas ignored him, gripping him by the arm and rotating him away. Dean tensed up as Cas’ lotioned hands gently rubbed into his shoulders, taking his time on what should have been a perfunctory task.
Finally stepping out, he slung a towel around his waist. He went to grab an outfit from the chest of drawers, but he was met with Castiel when he opened the bathroom door. He was entirely too close for comfort with Dean so wet and wearing so little.
Dean had spent years exercising some level of restraint with Cas. He hardly had to think about it anymore— holding himself back was automatic. Here and now, though, it was torture. Until lately, every impulse he’d had toward anything more than friendship had been easily brushed away, ignored in favor of their current hunt or the latest apocalypse. Now, with literally nothing between them, tension had given way to urgent want, a deep yearning for Cas to kiss him, hold him, undress him.
Far from the debauchery he was expecting (and somewhat hoping for), the onboard casino seemed tame. Just a bunch of polite pairs giggling behind hands of cards and shuffling between tables in their sandals. The four of them, led by Kira Leigh, settled at a blackjack table after exchanging their betting money for chips. Dean leaned over to Cas as they were dealt in, placing one chip in front of each of them as their bets.
“Cas,” Dean breathed, still fretful and twitching. He felt arms encircle him, hold him close until his heart began to calm.
, not quite. Their lips came together again and again as Cas pushed Dean’s overshirt off, breaking apart to make room to pull his t-shirt over his head. Dean had a moment of thankfulness Cas hadn’t showed up in his full suit, tie and trenchcoat. His fingers shook as he fumbled to unbutton the shirt, only making it to the second button before huffing in frustration. They’d waited long enough.
Dean took it, peering inside to find a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. He would have preferred a greasy fry-up to nurse his hangover, but this would do for now. The only course of action, he decided, was to act like everything was normal, and that he wasn’t standing half-naked in front of the man that rejected him ten hours ago.
When their bodies joined together it was unlike anything Dean had felt before. Sex was probably something the average angel did not do, so it was hard to know if they were always like this, their grace filling every inch of their bodies and entering yours as well. Though Dean had never been with a man before, he hadn’t imagined it would feel so pure. Castiel’s fingers dug into Dean’s hips as he held eye contact. His unblinking stare would have been unsettling coming from anyone else, but Cas had always been special, hadn’t he?
Dean supposed that had to be true. Cas was one of the only presences in his life— certainly the only one left, besides maybe Sam— who didn’t seem to expect anything from him, who stuck around just
He heard the sink shut off in the bathroom, followed by Cas emerging in a t-shirt and sweatpants. Dean must have gotten through to him on the unnaturalness of wearing the same outfit all the time; if he hadn’t, he was sure Cas would have put his trenchcoat back on the moment he was off the ship’s deck.
He stood next to Cas in front of the camera, giving the tiniest hint of a smile he thought he could get away with.
Dean looked back, where the people were pouring tequila into the dip in a different girl’s clavicle. He smiled, but waved them off. He was getting too old for those kinds of games.
The chair in question looked like the squeaky vinyl of hospital waiting rooms, and was in the corner, pointed toward the bed.
Deep down, Dean was fairly confident that he wouldn’t be judged for thoughts like these, because he’d already gotten away with an astonishing number of bad decisions where Cas was involved. Still, he should be thankful for the relationship they already had, not be greedy for more. His remaining friendships were increasingly limited, and he couldn’t risk screwing one up just because he couldn’t keep his feelings in check.
“I bought a few things at the market where you left me,” Cas continued, ignoring him, “but when Andrew came running up, I dropped them.” He smiled. “Some stray probably got a nice dinner tonight.”
He had to do something. Dean gingerly took Cas’ hand in his own and began to lift it up and over his waist. The fingers flexed, gripping his own. He froze.
The trouble with cruise ships was, with so much to do on board at all hours of the night, the television offerings were very sparse. After watching an unspeakably long infomercial for a stain remover, Dean gave up and clicked the power button on the remote.
“Uh,” Dean said, her address shaking him from watching the rowdy group. “Nothing right now, thanks.”
When they were face to face again, Cas helped Dean wrap his legs around his waist. Dean raised his hand to touch him, only to have it linked with Cas’ own, then pressed into the pillow above his head as Cas leaned down, staring with a new level of intensity before kissing down Dean’s neck and onto his chest. His other hand reached down to stroke Dean, who immediately let out an undignified whimper as he clutched their intertwined fingers tighter.
“Real funny, Sam. Give me a little warning next time so I won’t be standing stark ass naked singing showtunes when he shows up.”
. Was he expecting this to become a regular occurence? Where did they go from here? Did Cas, still not up to speed on all social cues, just not know what to do when Dean invited him to lay down, and joined him out of some remnant sense of obligation? Should Dean just get up now and go to breakfast and pray that Cas never brought this up?
Sam looked up from stirring the large pot, laughing at the towel Dean had wrapped around his head. “It’s almost ready. Did you have a good shower?”
Dean scoffed, but he knew Cas was right. Shame was the core around which Dean had been built, ever since he was a kid.
“Great!” Lorne announced. “Now, read the questions on each card and write your answers. Please print large and legibly. Time’s a-tickin’!”
The more questions that passed, the more Dean started to wonder how closely he’d been watched all these years. From inane details like shoe size to things they almost lost out on because Dean barely knew how to answer (what Disney character
Andrew stood behind Kira Leigh, comforting hands holding her arms. She was gaping at Dean down on the sand, her face wet with tears. “You— I saw you. How are you okay?”
“It meant something.” His breath hitched as he chanced a look downward, where Cas had his top teeth hooked around his lips in a bite. Dean exhaled, letting go of his last scrap of dignity. “It means...everything.”
The addition of free alcohol to their cruise package still seemed like a great idea, three or four drinks ago. The table was littered with empty bowl-shaped glasses, their little paper umbrellas cast aside. As someone who usually drank beer and whiskey and little else, Dean wasn’t prepared for the amount of liquor that could be hidden in the fruity, sweet concoctions they’d been ordering all evening. Cas had humored him by drinking along, but of course booze didn’t affect him at nearly the rate it affected humans. Dean was starting to feel out of control, which was terrifying, but also liberating in a way. They were in a place without monsters or research or anything he needed to manage. Why shouldn’t he let go?
The woman looked up at him, stone-faced, then gestured vaguely to Dean’s right before continuing her route.
Sam looked up from his laptop, staring at Dean with mild annoyance from his position on the bed. He gestured to his foot, wrapped with an ice pack and propped up on pillows.  “That was before my ankle fell through the floor of a building. Sorry if I don’t enjoy the idea of navigating a cruise ship hobbling around and in pain.”
“Beer and bad TV movies?” Sam laughed. “We can do that any time, Dean. Go on the cruise. Take pictures so I can live vicariously.”
Castiel’s face fell, his eyes leaving Dean for the first time since they’d opened. “Oh,” he said softly. “Well, for what it’s worth, I’m not.”
Dean let himself go, crying out. Cas moved a few times more with determination, leaning in for a final kiss as he lit Dean up from the inside.
If there was one thing he’d never known Cas to be, it was nervous. He’d come off the factory line without the need or capacity to show worry or embarrassment. But the anxious movements of the angel’s hands, the way his eyes darted around the room between sidelong glances at Dean, seemed to suggest exactly that.
was on, which felt a little on the nose after the day he had, but Dean didn’t have it in him to channel surf for something better. Before long, he found himself entranced by the seduction, the drama, the fighting between absurdly attractive couples. Cas held out for longer, but eventually even he started to predict what the contestants would do next, getting frustrated when they went against his wishes.
“Right,” Dean said, embarrassed by how much her presence had caught him off guard. He handed her his phone.
He rose and dressed in silence. When he emerged from the cabin and made his way to the upper decks, he was astonished to find he was up in time to catch the last rays of a golden sunrise on the horizon, Nassau far behind them. The ship wasn’t bustling yet. Only a few other early risers on deck, some holding coffee mugs, some arm-in-arm with their beloveds as they walked along.
“I’ll do the matching,” Cas said, before Dean could consider it. Cas lowered his voice and muttered in Dean’s ear, “I can only imagine most of the questions wouldn’t apply to a—to someone like me.”
Cas’ face broke into a wide grin, bigger than Dean had ever seen on him. It filled Dean with such bright happiness that it was hard to believe Cas didn’t have his grace anymore. Cas scooted closer to him, their noses now only inches apart.
Cas leaned in, and Dean felt his skin prickle despite the water’s warmth. “I’ve got the angel blade in my coat, just in case.”
Dean reached for his bag, the gravity of the moment holding him in place as his fingers closed around a small bottle of lubricant. He was never one for chastity, didn’t exactly need to know much about any of the girls he’d fallen into bed with to have a good time, but this felt different. More loaded. For one thing, though it was feasibly safe with a human vessel, like it was with Anna, who knew what it was like to bang a fully-loaded angel, grace and all? But what’s more, this was
“There.” Cas waited for him to turn back to face him, then gestured to the other man. “Jeff was just telling me about an event the ship is putting on this afternoon.”
Cas moved gently with him, murmuring admirations both innocent and filthy in Dean’s ear, pulling his back into an arch as he pushed into him, first with slick fingers and then himself. This was all new to Dean, but all his anxiety about the act fell away as they moved together, rolling with the motions of the ship beneath them. How could he ever have thought that this would be scary, this feeling of finally coming home after the longest day? Cas was holding him like he was precious even as he made stars dance on the edge of Dean’s vision with each thrust, knotting his fingers in his hair as Dean cried out.
Moments like this, that fell just short of romantic, always made Dean’s heart pick up speed. Usually it was rooted in anxiety, uncertainty if Cas was experiencing the same tension, if he was even capable of pathetic human feelings like Dean’s. Now, though...the looseness courtesy of his last piña colada steered his heartbeat toward excitement and anticipation rather than panic.
As he watched Cas tend to her, fetching a towel and making sure she was okay, Dean was faced again with a troublesome notion. Cas had often made him question things about himself, about their friendship, but the only conclusion he came to time and time again was the uncomfortable truth that he couldn’t voice, even to himself. The thing that resurfaced every time he saw Cas smile, or saw his eyes widen with concern, or every time he touched him...
Dean looked at him straight-on that time, but couldn’t hold it. Cas had so much heart, and all Dean did was make jokes. It was a miracle Cas even stuck around; even at his best, Dean didn’t deserve him.
“Next time, you can borrow mine,” he told Cas as he wrapped a towel around his waist. “Don’t want you to think that smelling like a girl with long flowing hair is the only option.”
“No, I don’t think so.” Dean gulped, wishing he hadn’t finished his drink. “I guess I just thought it would be easier. All this coupley stuff, pretending…”
He sighed. Of course the two of them had had countless fights, usually having to do with their respective roles in any given supernatural crisis, but a misfire in romance of all things weighed on Dean so much heavier than any of it. His life had never been peaceful, but Cas got under his skin in a whole new way.
. Cas paid careful attention to every inch of him, using his hands and mouth to slowly tease out Dean’s pleasure until he was writhing on the bed, vulnerable like he’d never been before. His pupils were blown out and needy, leaking tears as his angel touched him, drawing him to the edge before letting him back down, over and over again.
The next hour was sure to become one of Dean’s happier holiday memories. The meal was perfect, so delicious that he nearly proved Cas wrong. His own plate was nearly empty, and he’d taken several bites from Cas’ as well. He’d had a few glasses of a delicious spiced mead and was beginning to feel the pleasant looseness that came with drinking for fun rather than to numb. Earlier awkwardness forgotten, they spoke and laughed together in earnest for what felt like the first time since he’d kissed Cas. Any casual touches warmed his insides but didn’t cause him distress at needing more. Everything was going so well. Too well, as it turns out. The whole room gave a mighty lurch, and even Dean was caught off guard— he normally couldn't afford the ease that enveloped him that afternoon, but he should have known better than to think it would last.  Drinks went tumbling and chairs were knocked over, causing a great deal of chatter and even a few squeals from the other passengers.
“That’s...correct,” Cas conceded. “But that was many years ago, Dean. And I don’t think you’ve forgotten all that’s happened between us since.”
Dean sat back up but could barely speak, only managing a “Yeah,” as he nodded fervently, enraptured by the lines of Cas’ hips leading into his pants. He couldn’t resist diving forward into him, his nose trailing down the sharp lines before he let his tongue dart out and trace them, earning a gravelly moan in response. Dean reached up and undid Cas’ belt, removing it slowly as he stared up into his return gaze. Pants and boxers followed, and there he was, vibrant and beautiful and wholly Cas. Dean’s eyes roamed over his body, firmer and more tan than his own, the curves of Cas’ ass and thighs making his mouth go slack. Certain things about Cas always made Dean’s heart pick up speed. Tonight, he felt it falter, a tiny boat on an uneven sea, with little warning as to what would cause it to pitch and toss next.
Dean followed him into a simple off-white room, with three pews on either side and a pair of prayer rugs on the floor behind them. There was an altar of sorts at the front with a variety of religions represented; some he recognized, some he didn’t. Cas sat in a pew on the right and slid down, making room for Dean to join him.
Dean gave her an uneasy smile, his stomach squirming at the reminder of the cruise’s parameters. He tugged Cas behind him as they walked up the ramp onto the ship, where ropes of tinsel lined the handrail. They were greeted with a large wreath made of tropical flowers hanging from an archway placed over the entrance.
Things felt close to what they’d once been, but the comfort of being with each other came with more ease, more unabashed smiling now. Was this what it was going to be like? Having Cas not as a friend or a brother, but something else yet to be named that took up space in his heart and in his bed. He didn’t feel regret, never that, but fear was creeping back, no longer staved off by waves of ecstasy at finally having him like this by his side. Dean had wanted this for so long, never expecting it to happen, hiding his desire even from himself. Now that they were here, he was a little lost. He’d never planned this far.
He would still have to contend with thinking of himself as damaged goods, but Dean was starting to understand that damaged didn’t necessarily mean unsalvageable. Dean was cracked, from all of life’s traumas chipping away at him, but nothing glue and a little tenderness couldn’t fix. Cas seemed to think he was worth the effort, and he trusted Cas. They were both complete, and deserving of love. So, so much.
He hadn’t been thinking at all. No, this wreck in progress had been steered by feelings alone, those damned, senseless things.
“Huh?” asked Dean blearily. He’d been preoccupied with studying Cas’ stubbled jawline from behind. “Oh, jeez.”
Dean stayed silent for a long moment, almost certainly too long to make his answer plausible. “No. Just...got a little seasick.”
could commit to people, commit to Cas, but with few exceptions Dean had never been the type people commit
The couples that had seemed so innocent when they’d arrived appeared to be a bit less so upon closer inspection. At the craps table next to them, Dean could see a woman in a short dress nearly in the lap of her partner, whose hand was sneaking slowly into the gap between her slightly spread legs. Dean saw her eyes go wide, her mouth dropping open slightly.  Dean wouldn’t have been surprised to see the hand get swatted away, but instead, she gave the man a sultry look that made even Dean go hot behind the ears.
Dean interrupted him with an overexaggerated laugh. “Ha-ha, good one, honey! You’ve got twelve, so you probably want to hit.” Dean tapped the table for him.  The dealer placed a nine in front of Cas. Twenty-one.
“Remember that cruise we told you about, Cas?” Sam said, a smug grin on his face as Dean's protest died on arrival. “Well, after what happened last night, I can’t really go. So Dean has an extra ticket. You interested?”
Dean shrugged. Eric flashed a larger-than-average smile at them and continued. “Alrighty then! Just get settled in one of the seats and wait for the show to begin.”
Dean was now very awake as he pulled away quickly, his mind launching into panic as he tried to surreptitiously wipe the drool he’d left near Cas’ collarbone away. A foggy memory of the night before surfaced. Cas turning up, a drowsy invitation…He had spoken up, and Cas had joined him.
He found himself opening his mouth and speaking softly. “It’s Cas. Sorry, I was just checking on you. Go back to sleep.”
He rolled onto his side, facing the door. The minutes without him dragged by, and eventually Dean gave up on pretending that he didn’t want Cas to walk through.
Silence stretched between them for what felt like an eternity. The alcohol finally weighed on Dean’s eyelids, and he started to fade in and out of consciousness. Eventually Cas sighed and swung his legs out of bed. Dean could hear him rummaging in his luggage in the dark, then crossing to the door.
He immediately craved more contact, but Dean knew better than to reach out. If their skin met again, lingered for even a moment too long, there was no telling what he would do. It was hard enough to resist Cas’ pull before, a beautiful ethereal being in their corner, all bright eyes and fierce determination. As time went on, he’d learned to see Cas as more man than angel, which had the curious effect of making him more important to Dean than ever.
The world was swimming in and out of focus, blurry shapes crowding around him as he heard snatches of loud voices.
Dean didn’t bother protesting, Cas was almost certainly right. It was hard to like your odds when you were up against God himself.
Dean moved to pull the covers down on that side, a bit too quickly to pass off as nonchalant, but he tried to salvage it with a shrug and “Be my guest.”
He knew she was right, that he wasn’t dealing well. It’s not as though he and Cas were actually together, though— that much had been made perfectly clear. He wasn’t going to hold himself to some moral code for a guy who wasn’t even interested. Staring out to the horizon, he felt his temper cool as endless clear water filled his field of vision.
Kira Leigh’s eyes widened. “Y’all want to join us? Could always use some company while I lose at blackjack.”
Dean looked up, a wry smile on his face. “It’s just weird, you know, not expecting a monster around every corner.”
“Well, liven up a little,” he said, grabbing two shotglasses off of a passing tray and sliding one over. “We’re on vacation, baby!”
to act like they were in love all the time. He doubted the cruise employees would throw them overboard if they found out Dean and Cas weren’t actually a couple. But a part of Dean was enjoying having an excuse to touch him, look at him like this with a layer of protection removed. He could feel his nerve endings alight, prickling with possibility.
He clinked glasses with her, and downed the remainder of his drink. He was too sober to examine that toast too closely.
The dealer turned to Dean, and he realized he hadn’t even looked at his cards. He gave a quick scan of them— a ten of clubs and a two of diamonds. He made sure Cas was watching, trying to gesture toward the numbers and hoped Cas understood, because Dean was suddenly terrified at leaning in to whisper to him again.
“Come on!” the girl covered in tequila whined. She used her other arm to brush the sea-swept dark hair out of her eyes, being careful not to spill the liquid, then winked at Dean. Who knew what possessed him, maybe just the thought of flirting with someone who actually seemed receptive, but his feet dragged him back to the bar.
He made his way to Dean’s door and tried to quietly open it, hoping Dean’s multiple drinks over dinner and Yahtzee were helping him sleep deeply. Cas peered in, smiling when he saw Dean sprawled on his stomach, one leg out of the covers, holding a pillow.
Dean folded his clothes neatly, leaving them on a bench on the opposite wall before dragging himself into the shower stall and starting the water. It had been a long day on the road, and he needed to feel clean before he could think of enjoying the dinner Sam was preparing. He’d considered checking on Cas as soon as they got home, but the thought of bringing him a surprise meal in his room afterward and taking him up on that Nick-at-Nite marathon had won out.
, for one. Now we’re stuck in here, and they’ll probably have to hand out barf bags soon if the storm doesn’t stop rocking the boat.” Dean scoffed a little. “
A group of young people–probably students on their winter break– were crowded around the corner of the bar, cheering as one of their own was hoisted onto it and laid across. She pulled her crop top up as one of her cohorts poured a shot of tequila into her navel before bending down and slurping it up. The girl squirmed and giggled, reminding Dean of the odd college party he’d crashed while on the road with his dad, and the girls that would lead him into dark corners or their sorority house bedrooms.
He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. The significance of the placement wasn’t lost on either of them; sometimes Dean could still feel the handprint burned into his skin. There was a light grip, a touch they’d shared a hundred times before, but this time, Cas didn’t let go. Dean stood still, unsure of what to do but unwilling to be the one to break contact. Cas was staring intently at him, as if he was trying to memorize Dean’s face, every line, every freckle, while he still could.
Dean bent down, sweeping the items out from under their chairs. He stood up, carrying the blindfold, and stood behind Cas.
The angel pulled away to discard the remainder of his clothing. Dean sat up, staring at Cas’ body, which, laid bare like this, made the rest of the room seem dim in comparison.
When you try not to think of something, it had an annoying tendency of being the only thing occupying space in your mind. So it was that Dean again saw Cas’ face next to him in bed, saw him get closer as Dean kissed him, saw his expression shift as Cas pulled away. He thought he’d learned that hoping for good things was useless. Clearly he was wrong. If the night leading up to their kiss felt like torture, it was nothing to the agony he was in now.
“Hit me,” Dean told the dealer. The dealer flipped another card his way, an eight of spades. With a total of twenty, Dean gestured to stay.
Dean turned the water off, running his fingers through his hair and flinging off the excess water. From the next stall, he could smell Sam’s flowery shampoo wafting through the steam.
The rest of the day was full of mixed signals—Cas touching him, but not enough, looking at him, but with expressions he couldn’t read. It was driving Dean mad. Sometimes he missed the old days when Cas hadn’t yet learned how to hide what he was thinking. By the time the evening came, Dean was next to Cas in a hot tub, a calculated distance apart, with little idea, through his extended daze, of how they’d gotten there. Others walked by from time to time, but they were mostly, blessedly alone, their only other companionship a low-level constant hum that came from a nearby poolside bar. Dean held a glass of whiskey to his lips, then sat it down next to Cas’ trench coat, which lay piled in a heap on the deck.
The unspeakable fact snuck through his defenses, his mental blocks loosened by alcohol, and he could almost feel it make contact and send him spinning. He was in love with his best friend.
Cas wasn’t next to him. He wasn’t in the cabin at all. Dean supposed that was for the best. He wanted to delay that encounter for as long as possible.
“Yeah,” Dean said, a small smile forming in spite of himself as he wondered what Cas had said about him. “I am.”
Cas’ face lit up, giving Dean a not-unfamiliar swooping feeling in his stomach.  People flirted with Cas even more often than they did with Dean, but he never reacted with more than an eyeroll. At least, until now.
The two of them made their way to the off-ramp and walked down onto the dock. Immediately they were met with a display that had clearly been constructed for tourists: an archway bearing a WELCOME TO NASSAU banner before brightly-colored buildings, people offering to paint faces and braid hair, and souvenir shops as far as the eye could see. On the corner of the nearest street was a Santa Claus dressed in red swim trunks and sunglasses, posing for photos with children on a stationary surfboard, which was attached to a lone reindeer that looked like a repurposed hunting decoy.
Cas leaned in close, with a low voice that hadn’t been used between them in years. “You may forget, Dean, but I’ve seen you at your best and at your worst. I remade you from atoms. Those scars on your heart, in your head—those aren’t you.”
Whooping and laughter came from the others as the girl nodded. Dean bent down and put his lips on her collarbone, where he could taste the ocean’s salt. She craned her neck to watch him, and a glimpse of her deep blue eyes tugged at something in his chest. He made quick work of the tequila and used his tongue to get the last drops.
“Cas,” he moaned. The name had been on Dean’s lips before, in anger, in affection, even in prayer, but not like this.
The spread on the central table was truly something to behold. Every meat Dean could dream of eating, plentiful sides, and a selection of desserts that included multiple kinds of mouthwatering pie. He moved down the table, sampling a bit of everything and using Cas behind him to pick up what he couldn’t fit on his own plate. As they found seats, their plates clattered onto the table as gravity took its toll.
“Listen, Cas. You know I’d fight a thousand angry monsters alone if it meant keeping you safe, right? I love you.” The words had come tumbling out without warning, and even Dean’s mouth fell open slightly as he realized what he’d said. “Uh...I mean, if that’s okay.”
They sat in silence as he ate, Cas staring out at the water. It didn’t have quite the awkward heaviness of the night before, and maybe even resembled something bordering on their usual comfortable companionship. Dean’s insides still curled tight when he thought about how much he wanted to touch the man across from him, and how he couldn’t, but at least there wasn’t that sharp, raw pain anymore when he looked at Cas. Things were tender now, like skin newly formed over a healing wound. Since having an angel on speed dial, many of Dean’s injuries were healed so quickly that he’d almost forgotten what this felt like.
The first thing Dean noticed as he started to wake was the strange sensation of parts of his face and lips being pressed against something warm and smooth. He blinked a few times and let the form he was resting on come into focus. The blur shifted into skin, a bare torso marred by stitched wounds, above it a face covered in stubble on a head topped with messy dark hair.
Jingly Christmas music played across the crowded decks as the ship departed the shore, poking at something in Dean’s memory.
“I love Sam more than anything,” he settled on, “but that’s different. We’re going on middle age and I think I’ll always have the instinct to protect my dumb little brother.”
he most like?), Castiel knew everything. Couples around them dropped off until they were one of only two pairs, their opponents being Frat Boy Jeff and Speedo Brian. Dean narrowed his eyes at them, determined to beat them more than he was determined to win the prize.
They climbed the few stairs to get onto the stage, then picked a pair of seats close to the end of the line. He saw Jeff and Brian wave at them from several seats away, and gave a half-assed head nod in return. A few other couples settled around them as Dean tapped his foot nervously. The audience wasn’t full, but they were still there, and this weird public test of a relationship that didn’t technically exist suddenly seemed like a bad idea. He wondered what would happen if they just left now.
Dean tried to focus on the sounds around them instead. There was a tiny intermittent chirping, carrying over the sounds of people on the deck.
Dean woke up in the same embrace that had brought him panic just yesterday. Today, it made him smile. Last night hadn’t been a dream. He turned over, coming face to face with open blue eyes, happy little crinkles at their corners threatening to melt him right then and there.
“I care about what makes you happy,” Cas sighed. “If sleeping with a bunch of married women is what you want—”
Cas shook his head. “I said I could stand a little more waiting. I never wanted you to think I didn’t…”
They looked up at the gigantic vessel, tall enough to cast its shadow over the parking lot. The rolling sloshes of the waves made the base of a soundscape, layered with the voices of excited passengers and the calls of seagulls hoping to pilfer snacks from the crowd. After they made their way to the dock, Dean handed their boarding passes to a cheerful woman in a white visor to scan.
“I can work with that,” Dean said, clapping Cas on the shoulder, then letting his arm rest there. “But this could be a disaster.”
Dean always did everything to help others, save others. He couldn’t change things for himself without making the world worse off. His worth started and ended with his usefulness.
“I’m going to go explore the ship.” Cas told him, turning to leave. “I’ll meet you there if I don’t see you before.”
He’d long since left Cas at the slot machines with a pile of quarters, telling him he was welcome to come back to their cabin if he ran out of entertainment. So far, no dice. Dean wondered now if Cas had even heard him; he’d been focused so intently on the spinning symbols, the hokey flashing lights.  Dean wasn’t sure why he was even awake. He should be using this alone time to get some rest. No use waiting up for Cas. Even if he showed, they would only be facing the awkward bed situation again.
“Shh,” came a whisper, lips softly grazing his ear as new weight caused the mattress to dip behind him.
The door shut behind Cas, and Dean felt himself rouse a bit at the noise. He spent his last moments before sleep took him wondering how much of the last few minutes he’d hallucinated. How much he could force himself to forget.
. Cas who’d been on this journey with them for a decade and alive for millennia before, who had seen things on an unbelievable cosmic scale but still seemed to think Dean was worth more than a passing glance. Dean knew he was attractive and charming on the surface, but the idea that anyone who knew him so well and had seen him at his lowest would still want him was still a difficult concept to grasp.
The rest of their day ashore was spent together, Kira Leigh wasting no time in recruiting Dean and Cas to help bury Andrew in the sand. When the time came to return to the boat, Dean exchanged numbers with her and gave her a long hug, hoping it could communicate his thankfulness for her unwitting role in his fake-turned-real relationship with Cas.
“Oh god.” The balloon inside Dean didn’t deflate so much as pop, causing a visible flinch. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I did that.”
Dean could almost hear his inner monologue skip as his mind rewound to words that had passed without him even immediately noticing.
Cas still looked dubious but circled the bed, pausing to kick off his shoes and carefully place them under it. He sat on top of the covers, stealing a quick glance at Dean before fixating on the television. It felt like there was a chasm between them; they sat infinitely wider apart than they’d been the night before. Dean supposed he should be grateful Cas stuck around at all.
Cas also grows things in the vegetable garden out back, and Dean uses their homegrown bell peppers many times in the more savory breakfast recipes that he experiments with.
Later that night as they lay in bed, Dean tucked into Cas’ side, Dean remembers his and Bobby’s conversation from earlier.
Dean takes over the gardening. When the weather starts getting warmer, he helps Cas out to the front porch swing, tucks a blanket around his legs, and gets to work, Cas calling out directions to him. If it’s a particularly good day, Cas will wolf whistle or make an outrageously filthy comment at Dean when he bends over to do something. It makes Dean laugh every time, reminding him of the much younger men they used to be, of a time when he could wipe the smirk off of Cas’ mouth with more than just a tender kiss.
“I know,” Cas says. He grabs the front of Dean’s shirt in his fist and yanks him forward, sealing his lips against Dean’s own.
Part of Dean doesn’t want to leave Cas’ embrace; he is warm, cozy, and content to simply spend his morning being surrounded by, engulfed by Cas. He hates the thought of leaving Cas all alone in bed when he looks so damn adorable and sleep-warm, but one glance at the clock on his bedside table and Dean knows that Cas won’t be up for at least an hour yet.
“I just . . .” Dean tries, voice muffled against Cas’ chest, but he realizes that he doesn’t know what to say. Doesn’t know how to articulate just how grateful he is to wake up next to Cas, warm and peaceful and safe, every day. He doesn’t know how to voice just how much getting to spend their lives – lives that will be long and joyful, not short and tragic – together means to him.
Dean nods slowly, an unexpected sense of understanding resonating deep within his bones, like he knows exactly what Arthur means.
“Cas,” Dean says, setting the food down at the end of the bed, nudging his feet out of the way. “Up. Food.”
“I do.” Dean musters all of the strength he has, his injured arm screaming in pain, and brings his knife swishing down on the vamp’s neck. “Two!”
“This is for you,” is all Cas says before turning abruptly and walking out of the front door, taking the keys with him.
Dean decides that he wants to start making pancakes for him and Cas every Sunday morning, just like he had done with his mother when he was a little kid.
“Fine,” Dean acquiesces, and the excited smile Cas gives him is totally, absolutely worth it. “But we’re having sex when we get back.”
“You have a beautiful home,” Cas says sincerely, and Dean nods in agreement. Florence and Arthur smile at each other.
“Yeah,” Dean says, trying to piece together the parts of the dream that he’s actually able to remember as he takes a sip of coffee. “I was on a hunt with Sam. We were tracking this pack of vampires, I think . . . but they were all wearing these weird masks. Kind of like the Joker, but with pointy teeth.”
Cas just continues right on laughing, the bastard. Why did Dean decide to marry him again? He suddenly can’t remember.
“What!” Sam’s voice comes from somewhere behind him, but Dean doesn’t turn to look – he’s already got another vamp coming towards him.
Sam clears his throat and then he begins, his voice raised over the ruckus caused by all of the fighting.
Something tugs at Dean’s mind, however, a memory long since buried now allowed to resurface in the safety of this home that he has built with Cas. It pulls at Dean like a child might pull on the sleeves of their parent’s shirt when seeking attention, simultaneously persistent yet innocent, searching only for recognition in the eyes of someone they love.
“You look perfect, Cas,” Dean says instead. Cas smiles at him, wide and genuine, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and Dean’s heart melts inside of his chest.
Cas at least has the grace to look slightly abashed. “That’s what I came in here to ask you before I got . . . distracted.”
Up ahead, standing proudly against a blue, cloudless sky, is a cheerful yellow house with a large front garden.
The daffodils Arthur gave them still sit on the dashboard of the car where Cas left them earlier. As Dean pulls out of the field and back onto the dirt road, he steals a sideways glance at Cas before looking back towards the open road ahead of him. He thinks about new beginnings.
When Dean walks through the door, he gets an eyeful of miles of tan skin, slightly pink from the hot steam of the shower he was presumably about to take that’s fogging the small room. Cas is shirtless, facing away from him, his broad, muscled shoulders on full display. Dean’s mouth goes dry.
“Cas, can you hear me?” His voice is already breaking. “I want to tell you that I love you. And that I miss you. I don’t know what to do without you here. I think Sam’s worried I’ll die of a broken heart if old age doesn’t get me first.”
The strange, intense longing he felt earlier, the deep sense of understanding at Arthur’s explanation for why he and Florence chose to leave – it all makes a little more sense, now.
that he’s making air quotes with his hands when he says “lady friend." “Her name’s Eileen. And she’s really smart and cool and funny . . .”
They spend the next several weeks in a perpetual state of either unpacking, furnishing, or decorating. Dean discovers an unexpected love for antique shopping during their hunt for a kitchen table, while Cas seems to prefer the more modern décor they find in places like Target. It shouldn’t work, but it does; slowly but surely, their home starts to take shape, a mixture of old and new, a mixture of the two of them.
“Robert Padraic Winchester,” Sam says, and Dean can hear the fondness in his voice. “Robert after Bobby, and Padraic after Eileen’s dad.”
As Dean goes to grab a tray that he can use to carry the food up to their bedroom, he looks down and, for the first time since he started making the pancakes, notices,
Cas nods his head eagerly and sets the bags down on top of the island. Dean plates a roll for Cas before doing the same for himself, accidentally getting some of the gooey icing on the counter as he does so. Cas grabs two forks and they head over to the kitchen table, sitting down across from each other.
The three of them look at each other, communicating silently in a way that years of companionship has allowed them to. Dean gives a small nod of understanding as they reach a mutual, wordless decision.
“I’m going to marry the shit out of you, is what I’m gonna do,” Dean says instead, reaching over to entwine Cas’ hand with his own.
“Seriously,” Dean says, trying his best to sound threatening even though he can feel a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “I mean it.”
“Sam,” Cas greets, a small, guilty smile playing around his mouth. From the way his eyes are glinting when he glances back at Dean, though, Dean can tell Cas is not all that sorry. “It’s good to see you.”
And after a particularly bad night – where Dean had nearly drowned in the sea of all his past mistakes, Cas barely able to bring him up for air – he finds a white zinnia placed carefully on the kitchen table the next morning:
“How are my boys doing in here?” Cas asks, leaning in to kiss Dean’s cheek. He ruffles Bobby’s hair affectionately and then, quick as a flash, he reaches his hand into the bowl and swipes a piece of dough.
Cas continues, year after year after year, to try and grow a damned sweet pea flower. He still has yet to be successful, but he gave up being frustrated about it a long time ago. Every year, he just gives a small sigh as he stares at the patch of earth where the sweet pea has, once again, refused to sprout, and says, “I’ll try again next year. Maybe it’s just not its time, yet.”
It’s one of the happiest days of Dean’s life. He feels nearly drunk on his love for Cas – though that may also be in part due to the couple of beers he’s had – and he can hardly take his eyes or keep his hands off of him. Off of his
Dean smirks at him before turning his attention back to the road. “Maybe if you hadn’t stayed up all night chatting with your lady friend, you’d be more awake this morning.”
Cas squeezes Dean’s hands, increasing the pressure. The two of them lay there, holding on for what feels like dear life, teetering on the edge of the metaphorical cliff.
They leave a while later. Dean gets into the driver’s seat and inserts the keys into the ignition, the engine rumbling to life. Cas hops into the passenger’s side and immediately pulls Dean in for a swift, passionate kiss that leaves them both breathless. When Cas pulls back, he’s wearing a blinding smile that crinkles his eyes at the corners, happiness and relief and excitement all displayed openly on his face. Dean can’t help but lean in and kiss him again, feeling nothing in that moment but eager anticipation for whatever their future together holds.
Sam shakes his head. “I know you didn’t, but –” He flips to the next page, his finger tracing down the page until it lands on another piece of text that Dean can’t read. “The problem with just sending you into the Empty to get Cas is that it’s basically pointless. Not because it would necessarily kill you, but because –”
“Sam, marry us,” he says seriously, not breaking eye contact. He gives Dean a slow, quiet smile which Dean returns, his heart in his throat.
, does that shit hurt. Blood gushes from the wound, flowing down his arm and hand, coating his skin in a glossy red. Thankfully, Cas rushes over and lops off the vamp’s head before it can do any more damage to him.
They head out to a large, open field that Dean had noticed on their drive earlier. It’s a warm night, and Dean rolls down the windows, enjoying the light breeze on his face. A comfortable silence settles between them as they drive further and further out into the country, the night air filled instead by the chirping of cicadas and the quiet hum of the engine.
“Yes,” says Dean, and the confirmation comes out easier than expected, though his voice is rough. He breathes out, feeling as though a great, ancient burden has been lifted from his shoulders. “I –” His voice catches, but he still finds himself wanting desperately to say it. Shifting in his seat, he clears his throat. He shifts his gaze to somewhere over Sam’s right shoulder. “I love Cas.” The words roll from his mouth naturally, his tongue shaping them as if he has said them over and over, hundreds of times before now, like a nightly prayer.
And then Cas says, “I would gladly give up eternity all over again for the privilege to die next to you.” He says it like it ain’t a damn thing.
Before Dean can even get them out of the bathroom and onto a horizontal surface, however, Cas says, “Can we go stargazing?”
Dean’s stomach rumbles again, loudly enough that Cas stirs slightly in his sleep. Dean’s decision seems to have been made for him.
They also carve small warding sigils into the floor beneath the welcome mat in the entryway, as well as into all of the windowsills. Just to be safe.
They all move out into the backyard around eleven o’clock, a radiant sun and a cool breeze greeting them when they step outside. The flowers are in full bloom this time of year, filling the air with the sweet scent of spring and painting the yard in vibrant colors. Dean and Cas stand facing one another, Sam on one side of them as the officiant, while everyone else takes their places on the other side. And half an hour later, surrounded by love and flowers, Dean and Cas are married.
more than twenty feet, but Dean gets up, acquiescing only because he thinks his stomach might start eating itself if he doesn’t put food in it soon.
That’s a really sweet gesture, Dean thinks, smiling at the two of them. So he might be a bit of a romantic. Sue him.
“I guess I could stand to get a few more hours at night,” Dean says with a half-hearted laugh, the joke falling flat between them. He knows what Cas is really asking, of course, but his question skirts a little too close to what’s been on Dean’s mind all day for comfort.
It continues from there. They leave flowers for each other when words are either too much or not enough. After a particularly wonderful day – spent on a grassy hill where Dean had surprised Cas with a picnic – Dean leaves a pink rose on Cas’ pillow:
All at once, the swooping sensation in Dean’s stomach stops and he just . . . lands. He’s surrounded by dark nothingness on all sides; he can’t even see what he’s standing on, though it feels solid enough. There is nothing in front of him or behind him that he can make out, and it feels both too expansive and claustrophobic all at once.
, stated so assuredly by Cas like it’s an obvious fact of his existence, rather than what it actually was, which was a devastating, Earth-shattering revelation that has turned Dean’s world upside-down in a matter of minutes. Dean’s shoulder flares, warmth diffusing through his body as it does, and he swears he feels Cas’ presence, he swears he feels the weight of Cas’ hand on his shoulder, steadying him, grounding him. He reaches up and places his right palm over his left shoulder and feels only fabric. Dean clenches the cloth of his jacket in his fist and finally lets go, too exhausted to try and fight his sorrow any longer.
Dean leans over the sink, letting his tears fall silently but freely. He’s crying so hard that he doesn’t hear Cas come downstairs, but he does feel Cas’ arms wrap around him from behind, as comforting and warm and welcome as a bath on a rainy, cold day. Cas shushes him quietly, rocking Dean’s body gently against his own until Dean is able to calm down, is able to catch his breath. Cas turns the tap back on and squeezes some soap onto a washcloth. He takes Dean’s hands in his own before proceeding to carefully scrub at Dean’s fingers and palms until his hands are perfectly clean. Cas grabs a dry, fluffy towel once he’s done and pats Dean’s hands dry.
Suddenly, Dean can’t stand the thought of dying without getting married to Cas first. He’s waited so long for this, damn it, and he’s not about to let some stupid vampires take the opportunity to marry the love of his life away from him.
“I really like the garden,” Cas says softly. Dean makes a quiet noise of agreement. It looks even more spectacular from up here, if that’s even possible; pinks, yellows, purples, and reds, all splattered against a canvas of green.
It’s mid-summer now, and after several days of packing and driving and doubling back to the bunker because Cas forgot something – “I
Except maybe he does understand, Dean thinks, as he turns the sink faucet on and sticks his hands under the water. He watches, almost in a trance, as some of the red swirls away down the drain.
“That’s how we met, actually,” says Arthur. “I was working as a florist and she came into the shop one day, looking for a rare variety of flower to study. A Lady’s Slipper orchid, if I recall correctly.”
“Aw, c’mon Cas,” Dean wheedles, picking up his blade from where he’d dropped it on the ground and trying not to focus on how light headed he is. “You wouldn’t do that. We’ve got a wedding to plan.”
Dean feels a strange mix of emotions as they place the last moving box into the trunk of the car. He gets into the driver’s seat, Sam folds himself into the passenger’s seat, and they both just sit there for a while, not saying anything.
Dean dons his apron 𑁋 a ridiculous thing that says “Kiss the Cook” on it (a gift from Cas) 𑁋 and gets to work. He sifts the flour, pours the milk, and cracks the eggs into a large bowl before whisking it all together. The batter is just the right consistency: a little lumpy and on the thicker side, the way he remembers it looking when his mother made it.
That changes the very next morning when Eileen has to excuse herself from breakfast to throw up in the bathroom. One, two, three positive pregnancy tests later, Sam is on the phone with the real estate agent they met with yesterday, discussing how soon they’d be able to move in.
All at once, Dean feels completely overwhelmed, as if everything that has happened in his life over the past couple of months is just now catching up with him. Dean has half a mind to hightail it to the car and drive the twenty-five hours back to the bunker.
notices, his hands. His fingers, specifically 𑁋 his fingers are stained a garish purply-red from the juice of the blueberries.
“Are you sure?” Sam asks, and there’s a hint of trepidation in his voice. It’s the first indication Sam’s given throughout this whole ordeal that he’s just as terrified as Dean is that he won’t make it back. Dean gives Sam a quick nod and, before he can second guess himself, downs the contents of the flask, the spell diffusing warmth through his body, flaring brightly in his shoulder, in his chest.
“Let’s stop here,” Cas says, pulling Dean from his thoughts. They’re somewhere in the middle of the field, wildflowers and tall grasses sprouting here and there in every direction all the way out to the hills, as far as Dean can see. The sky looks more expansive than ever from here, the inky velvet of the night draping itself completely over the landscape, broken only by the twinkling of stars and the silvery glow of the moon.
Dean blinks down at his hands again, and he tries desperately to rub the stain of the blueberries off on his apron. It isn’t coming off. Dean blinks again and feels a tear fall down his cheek. Dean shakes his head quickly, unsure of what’s going on, unsure of why he’s crying over his fingers being stained with berry juice.
“Dean, what –” Sam says, and then there’s the sound of metal slicing through skin and bone from his direction. “Nine! Yeah, I did, but why are you –”
“Sam,” Cas continues, that same serious tone to his voice, “there is nothing more important than this."
– about how he hadn’t managed to say anything of substance back to Cas before the Empty had taken him, about how Cas had believed until the very end that Dean loving him back, that them being together, was something he could never have. Dean feels like his chest is cracking open as he tries (and fails) to get a handle on the fact that he could have had Cas, that Cas had loved him too, all of this time. It’s too much information for him to process and all of it has come too late. As he cries, he mourns the life he could have had, the life he dreams about in his weaker moments when he allows himself to imagine him and Cas together, safe and warm in a cabin, or maybe in a little cottage by the beach. They’re foolish fantasies, but he had let himself have them, these small mercies, and kept them in a special corner in his mind that he could retreat to when he needed strength. Now, with Cas gone, with Cas
Dean stops mixing, the chocolate chips he just added only partially folded into the batter. He has to take a moment before answering to remind himself that he
Cas is still in the downstairs bathroom when Dean gets back, finishing up the paint job they started earlier that day. Dean calls him out to the kitchen and hands him the bag from the thrift store. Cas smiles, raising a curious eyebrow at him before pulling out the mug and inspecting it closely, an unreadable expression on his face.
a perfect Sunday morning. The stormy grey weather that has smothered their small town in Vermont for the past week and a half appears to have finally bid them goodbye, leaving behind fluffy white clouds, a bright blue sky, and an eager yellow sun in its stead. Outside, even through the closed windows, Dean can hear birds twittering merrily whilst they flit from tree to tree, as if saying to each other:
, with so much emphasis, so much weight, Dean has no doubts about what – or rather, who – Cas is referring to when he says that.
Dean hasn’t been able to shake that image of Cas laying in bed from his mind all day, the peculiar sense of longing he had felt earlier still lingering along with it. He doesn’t understand it; he wakes up next to Cas
Dean wakes up first the next morning. The pink and orange remnants of the morning’s sunrise that he can see out of the window tell him that it’s still early, but he doesn’t go back to bed. Instead, he feels content to just watch Cas sleep, laughing quietly to himself when he thinks about how he used to reprimand Cas for doing the exact same thing to him. Cas is so beautiful like this, though; he looks perfectly content, completely at peace. Dean idly wonders if Cas thought those same things about Dean when he would watch him sleep, all those years ago.
Dean is brushing his teeth in the bathroom of their hotel room that night when Cas wanders in, lightly smacking his ass as he passes by. Dean makes a squawk of indignation, muffled around his toothbrush, though he can’t help the amusement he sees dancing in his eyes when he looks back in the mirror. Cas smirks at him and perches himself next to Dean, resting his hip on the side of the counter. When they finally got together three years ago, Dean had been endlessly surprised by Cas’ playfulness, a side of him Dean had only ever gotten glimpses of before. He’s still surprised by it now, honestly, but it’s something he can’t imagine living without.
“God, Cas,” Dean says, and he’s surprised by the strain in his voice. He reaches over and takes Cas’ hands in his own, holding them probably a little tighter than necessary. “I want that too. So –” He clears his throat, trying to keep his voice steady. “So much.”
Dean’s name is the fitting final word spoken from his lips. Cas takes his last breath later that night, sitting in their garden and surrounded by flowers.
The woman rises to greet them, a wide, pleasant smile on her face. Dean and Cas extend their hands in greeting, introducing themselves.
“Yeah, it does,” agrees Dean, nodding his head slowly. This had been their home for years, a place they had always been able to return to, and now they’re about to drive away for what could very well be the last time.
Dean makes it all of six months and four days before he has a breakdown, the guilt he thought he had already dealt with returning with a vengeance, feeling like it’s going to eat him alive.
kind of a funny way to die – but later that night, he finds a small, white flower with a yellow center on his nightstand. Dean recognizes it as a primrose because Cas had pointed out the new blossoms to him a couple weeks ago. He takes his box full of cards out of his dresser and flips through them, unable to remember its meaning. He finds what he’s looking for near the back of the stack.
They’d picked up a couple of reports over their radar of victims with bite marks and blood drainage consistent with vampires earlier that week. The deaths had occurred in neighboring towns near the southern border of Missouri, all within the span of one month. It definitely looked suspicious, but it also looked like it was likely the work of a small nest of vampires, maybe even a lone vamp.
“Vodka cranberry, please,” Kira Leigh told the bartender as she started to pull money from her purse. “But you don’t have to pay for me.”
As their bodies moved together, Cas holding him tight, Dean found himself wondering what it would be like to experience an angel’s climax. Anna had been graceless, and the circumstances different...a last night on earth fling rather than the culmination of ten years of longing. The intensity of feeling now almost made him worry for what was to come.
“People still need their faith when they’re on vacation. Or maybe just a quiet place away from everything else.”
When the episode ended and a news program began, they each reached for the remote between them. Their knuckles brushed, and both of them pulled back, Dean looking up at Cas only to find him resolutely looking at the remote. Dean reached for it again, turning the TV off before Cas’ gaze shifted to meet his.
“What I want feels kinda irrelevant,” Dean huffed. “I mean, our whole lives have been part of these giant heavenly prophecies, and our jobs mean that we matter in the grand scheme of things, but this personal stuff… I’m just not good at it. Hell, we wouldn’t have even met if you hadn’t been ordained by the heavens to come save me or whatever.”
“Nah. It’s easy to be us.” Dean bit his lip around a smile despite the fib. “We’re just a couple of idiots.”
Cas woke with a start, crying out in pain when his sudden movement pulled at his wound. Sweat soaked his sheets and skin. He breathed deeply, trying to get his racing heart back under control. The terror of the dream was fading, but a lingering feeling persisted, his ever-present urge to confirm that Dean was safe raised to a level he couldn’t ignore. He slowly slipped out of bed, not bothering to put a shirt on. He’d just look in for a minute.
Dean turned his card over, trying to quickly read Cas’ and the other team’s at the same time. Castiel’s said “Me” while Dean’s said “Cas”. Jeff and Brian...had each other’s names on the cards. A celebratory music cue started ringing out from the speakers above them. They’d won.
. A fun night, then gone from his bed (or his car, or her couch) by morning. But this? This mattered, and he didn’t want to screw it up.
, if Dean was being honest), it was easy to imagine feelings beneath the surface that were more than brotherly. In the moments when one of them was in danger, these feelings came closer to the fore, but inevitably, they’d overcome whatever the life threatening situation of the week was, and settle back into their groove. Spending plenty of time apart made it easier to ignore the tugs in Dean’s navel like what he’d just felt when Cas came out of the bathroom. A trip like this, not knowing anyone else onboard, practically shoved together at every turn...he was a little worried.
Dean almost whined, looking at Cas questioningly. A split second’s pause made his stomach lurch, certain that he would wake up at any moment and Cas would be gone.
“Lured you?” He’d never told Dean why he was away from his lookout spot when the Wendigo had gotten to him. Dean had been too focused on getting Cas fixed up to ask.
Dean gnawed at his lip in silence. He got along fine with people, sure, but tried to keep it all surface level, at a distance. They couldn’t afford attachments on a hunter’s salary. Sometimes he slipped up, like with Kevin, or Charlie, or Cas. At best, he always ended up loving more than he could be loved in return. He knew he wasn’t worth the risk that even knowing him brought. But he wasn’t about to open that can of worms.
He licked his lips, considering whether drinking so early was a good idea. “Tell you what. Send a couple of shots to them, on me.” He put a bill on the bar, gesturing to the others. She took it, and pulled a tequila bottle and shot glasses to walk their way. Dean scooted back from the bar, and was a few steps away when a voice called out.
When his brain caught up, Dean kissed him back, tender and hesitant again. They broke apart and Castiel was beaming at him like a fool, filling his chest to bursting. He moved back in and tested the waters, teasing his tongue over Cas’ lips, and when they opened to let him in his world began to spin. He held Cas as their kisses deepened, somewhat to keep himself upright but mostly because he could, he finally fucking
Just three words, plus his name, made his knees feel like giving out. Dean’s entire focus was spent on remaining upright and processing what had just been said. He stood there in silence, blinking slowly.
He couldn’t make sense of the shouting voices as he felt arms wrap around his chest and drag him painfully slowly toward light. Dean finally felt air on his face again, but still couldn’t seem to inhale properly as he was pulled along. The edges of his vision began to darken as he finally felt sand dragging under his feet.
“I’m sure there will be plenty to do on the boat overnight, then,” Cas suggested, unusually perceptive of Dean’s discomfort. “I’ll stay out of your way.”
The next thing he felt were hands on his face, an overwhelming fire on his skin as his body was filled with a wave of light.
Blue eyes full of concern were inches from his own. Dean could see relief flood them as Cas’ fraught expression cracked into a smile. Before he could register much else, Dean was being pulled up, held close to Cas’ face with unexpected tenderness.
“Want me to take that for you?” a voice cut in, and Dean nearly dropped his phone. He put some distance back between himself and Cas, out of reflex.
Layers continued to peel off as they explored each other’s skin. When Cas’ jacket and shirt were gone and Dean was down to his boxers, Cas pulled him closer with a hand at the small of his back, then kissed him again, gripping Dean’s thighs as they rocked together for a moment. Cas backed off him and stood at the foot of the bed, the corner of his mouth quirking upward as Dean felt himself being surveyed. He was hard, anticipating what might follow. There was evidence straining against Cas’ zipper that the feeling was mutual, but Dean was stuck on his expression, the same intense look he’d been given a thousand times before, now seen for what it truly meant.
The mistake gnawed at him all morning. Dean hated how exhausting it must be to be around him. Too needy, too greedy once he was shown an ounce of affection and allowed his guard down an inch. The soap got his body clean, but it couldn’t wash away the grime he felt underneath, though he stayed under the spray until his skin began to prune.
“It’s alright,” Cas answered, steadying Dean with a hand on his bicep. Dean was electrified by the touch, staring at Cas’ fingers on his bare arm as his mouth fell open slightly. A haze seemed to have taken residence in his brain, making it difficult to form words. When he looked back up, Cas’ eyes were trained on his own.
Ice flooded his stomach as Dean realized that he’d turned what should have been an easy moment into something difficult. He was a self-fulfilling bad time.
“Don’t hit if you’re close to 21,” he muttered. “If you go over, you get nothing, but you only need to be high enough to beat the dealer.”
If Cas thought his reply suspect, he was kind enough not to press the matter. A substantial wind began to pick up, howling through the ship’s balconies and corridors and biting at Dean’s still-wet skin and suit. A chill went through him, and he gripped his own arms as he shivered.
“Welcome to our little contest, designed to put relationships to the test! My name is Lorne, and I will be your emcee!” the host continued, beaming. “Under each set of chairs, you will find a set of answer cards, markers, and a blindfold. One member of each team will write the answers to the questions found on each card. While you’re doing this, the other partner will be blindfolded so as to not see your answers. We will then ask the questions one by one and partners will answer them about their beloved, then we’ll turn your cards over and see if you’ve got a match! A wrong answer will eliminate you. We’ll keep asking until one couple is left standing! Does everyone understand?”
“I had a nightmare,” Castiel sighed. “About...about the wendigo. I couldn’t find you, and I just...I needed to make sure you were safe. But then you woke up, and told me to stay, so I did.”
Kira Leigh giggled, nodding at Cas. “Careful! You better lock this one down before someone else comes along.”
“Hey,” Dean called out to someone who looked local, who was pulling a cooler with cold drinks for sale. “Which way to the nearest beach?”
“I’ll see you later,” Dean said shortly, then took off down the boardwalk before Cas could respond. He knew he was acting childish, but he didn’t have the energy to pretend to be a mature adult at the moment. After putting some distance between them and catching sight of the beach, he risked a glance back to where he’d left Cas. He wasn’t there.
Part of him wished he could talk about what happened, clear the air with Cas, without reliving how much it hurt, or opening himself up to get hurt again. But there was no way; his mortification at only the thought of bringing it up proved that those wounds would be easily reopened if he actually did. He couldn’t think of a way to perfect his phrasing without betraying his heart. Only he would find a way to make a vacation so fraught with inner conflict. Sometimes he really couldn’t win.
Dean chose instead to embrace Cas, hold him tighter than he ever had, force himself to stop trembling. But when his face turned into Cas’ neck, he didn’t hesitate before placing a gentle, open-mouthed kiss just below his jaw, Cas’ stubble tickling his lips. Cas let out a small gasp and gripped Dean’s arms, pulling away, and Dean was immediately flooded again with the terror that he was being stopped, rejected again. Before his mind could get going on a proper spiral, Cas pulled them back together, their mouths crashing into each other with an intensity that made Dean lightheaded as the physical desire and emotional peak braided together tight inside him.
“He’s practically allergic to the sun, poor thing,” Kira Leigh said. “A few minutes out of the shade and he fries.”
Sam chuckled. “We have stalls for a reason, Dean. Didn’t think you’d mind. Besides, he looked like he needed it.”
Cas leaned in. As their knees brushed, Dean gave in to the urge to put his hand on Cas’ thigh. To Castiel’s credit, he didn’t flinch. It wasn’t as if they
Dean threw his arms around Cas, squeezing him tightly and lifting him slightly off the ground as he shouted in victory. As their chests pressed together, it was hard to tell whether his heart or Cas’ was the one hammering between them. Maybe they were echoes, reverberating off one another before Dean loosened his arms and let Cas slip to the ground, now flush with even more of his body. They couldn’t have stayed like that for more than a second or two, but several conflicting instincts managed to root Dean to the spot during that time. Part of him stared at Cas’ lips, fighting an instinct to close the gap between their faces. The other part panicked with the instinct of how their embrace looked to everyone else. When he remembered they were supposed to be acting like this, it was too much for his brain to process and Dean awkwardly stumbled back from Cas, tearing his eyes away and smiling at the romper-clad activities director who was coming to get their information.
Dean felt a lump in his throat and fought to swallow it down. “Yeah, Cas. We’ve had our ups and downs, but you’re here at the end with us, and that’s what matters.”
Dean chuckled. “You’re still wearing more than most of the people on this ship. It’s still bikini season on the Gulf!”
Dean shook his head, holding up his new chip. “I’m ten bucks richer than when I walked in here, I might as well spend it buying a drink for a pretty lady.”
“Forget it. It doesn't matter.” Dean turned to the lamp and switched it off. He flopped back down without turning back to face Cas. He couldn’t bear to look at him right now; he didn’t need Cas’ sympathy to make him feel even more pathetic. He wouldn’t get up and leave, as much as he wanted to put as much distance between them as possible, short of jumping overboard. It would only serve to show how upset he really was.
“We’ve been working hard,” Dean said, melted butter dribbling out of the corner of his mouth as he stuffed himself with more crab meat. “We deserve this!”
Before he could act either way, Cas interrupted his deer-in-headlights terror by leaning in and planting a gentle, chaste kiss on Dean’s cheek. He smiled despite himself and felt color flood his face. The camera clicked.
Castiel’s eyebrows grew ever so slightly closer together as he studied Dean, but his smile didn’t fall. Sometimes it made him feel like a zoo animal, but right now it felt like something close to affection.
Breath caught in Dean’s chest. He’d rehearsed a version of this countless times in his own head, but he’d never expected the conversation from Cas’ side.
Cas’ mouth dropped open slightly, then let out a disbelieving chuckle. “Dean. You didn’t hear what I said before I left? That night you kissed me.”
Dean’s lips, already close from whispering instructions in his ear, brushed Cas’ cheek as he turned. Dean barely resisted jerking away in a panic, which wouldn’t look very couple-y of them. He slowly eased his face away, and thought he saw a new, warmer tint to Castiel’s cheeks.
Dean didn’t really have a good answer to that. “I’d.... I’d hate to miss our trademark Winchester Christmas.”
“If your heavenly healing powers have begun to fail, we’ve got a bigger problem on our hands.” Dean picked up the remote and clicked the TV on. “Come on, Cas, I’m fine.”
After shifting positions for what felt like the hundredth time, Dean looked at the clock, which gave his eyes a break from the ceiling.
When he opened his eyes, Cas held Dean’s gaze head-on. “This is very likely the last time we’ll see each other.”
Cas looked at him with curiosity, then slowly moved his hand toward the bird, cupping it in his hand while it chirped in alarm. He cooed softly at it, pulling it close to his chest.
Cas continued to torment him with teeth and tongue along his ears, his throat, the dip in his clavicle, barely pausing to work at the buttons on Dean’s linen shirt. His hands were forced to release their fistfuls of trenchcoat as Cas pushed Dean’s shirt over his shoulders and to the floor, letting cool air dance over his warm skin, heightening every sensation. He shrugged off the trenchcoat and let it fall onto the bed behind them.
“Sweet!” Kira Leigh said, bubbly to an extent Dean could not fathom matching. “Are you guys married?”
Cas brought them into the tiny bathroom, struggling to turn around and shut the door behind him. When he emerged, Dean was momentarily speechless. Cas had worn variations of the same outfit for all the years they’d known each other. Stripped of the trenchcoat and suit, he looked...great. Not relaxed, exactly, but like he’d taken off a layer of armor.
Most of Christmas Day was spent on the beach, their wet skin sticking to each other with every touch after surreptitious fondling among the waves. Cas was helping rub sunscreen onto Dean’s shoulders again, both able to properly enjoy it this time. Dean still couldn’t believe his luck. It was so nice, being affectionate even when eyes weren’t on them. No more pretending. His body held a satisfying soreness from the night before, but tiny worries still dug at the back of Dean’s mind.
He addressed the couple nearest to him, then moved down the line, cheers and groans moving in a wave toward Dean and Cas. By their turn, two other couples were already eliminated. Dean was fairly confident in this one; they’d watched it countless times together in the bunker. But there was still an inkling of worry when the host peered at Cas, prompting him for an answer.
Dean shifted uncomfortably, his eyes tracing the lines of Cas’ face and chest, both golden in the midday sun. He wanted to kiss his mouth closed, stop talking about all this, pretend he was someone else, someone functional.
Dean approached the table, then clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Dude, you’re missing out! Check it out, I got lei’d!”
“I...had a bad dream,” Cas said, mortified. Here he was, a millenia-old being, acting like a frightened child.
“You love,” Cas continued, his leg brushing Dean’s. “Wholly and completely. More than anyone I know.”
Cas shut the trunk and slid into the passenger seat, looking at Dean as he shut the door. Dean turned the keys in the ignition then let his hand fall into Cas’ lap, fingers covering his own as they pulled out of the parking lot and into the night.
“Uh, thanks, Cas,” he said once he’d swallowed. He gestured at the remaining crab legs between them. “Why don’t you eat up?”
Once dinner ended, they found themselves walking along the ship’s promenade deck, letting the cool night air dance around them. Dean stopped, looking out at the setting sun on the water’s horizon, reds and yellows reflecting and melting into the deep blue.
Dean’s neck prickled as he wondered how often Castiel had been smelling his hair. “Oh, uh...thanks. Enjoy the rest of your shower.” He grabbed his robe from the hooks by the door and pulled it on, scurrying out of the room before he could say anything he’d regret.
Dean stared at him, stone-faced, but the man’s teeth remained on display as he urged the two of them in front of the backdrop.
“We’re going to try to navigate around the worst of it,” the Captain continued, “but you may still experience some unpleasantness. It’s not fun, but there’s not much we can do except ride it out. We advise everyone to return to their cabins for a few hours. Maybe the rest of the night.”
Castiel lifted his own bag and nodded toward Dean’s luggage. “We should probably find the room first and unload these.”
Time seemed to slow down even with his heart beating at double speed. Even with Cas’ blessing, closing the distance between their lips was an astonishingly difficult thing to do. One kiss, drunk and spontaneous, could be brushed aside. They could still move on from that, pretend it never happened. But two...a second kiss, sober and in earnest, that was something else entirely.
Cas seemed to understand enough to leave him alone with his thoughts for a while before putting a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Hi!” chirped a staff member who was wearing an outfit that wouldn’t be out of place in a Village People performance. “I’m Eric, and I’m in charge of this game! I just need your names written here, and you need to decide which of you will write answers about themselves, and which of you will try to verbally match afterward.”
Cas ran a hand over Dean’s hair, lightly parting it with his fingers. Dean felt himself leaning into the touch, cherishing it. “I’m serious. I don’t want you to feel like you owe me anything, or worse, that this is some show of pity. You’ve given me everything I could ask for and more already.”
Hey everyone, I posted this fic on my social media today so have gained a few new readers and decided to go ahead and post this final chapter (plus an epilogue) a few days early. Thanks so much for reading this fic, especially those of you who have taken the time to comment or message me. I had a great time writing it and am loving experiencing it all again through your eyes.
“Shh.” Cas held a finger to Dean’s lips, too intimate, but barely grazed the soft skin before pulling away.
The walk back to their cabin wasn’t terribly pleasant, the ship unsteady under the feet of dozens of passengers being herded along the docks. One unfortunate soul was already leaning over the balcony, the motion causing seasickness to get the better of him as his partner patted his back.
The question lost a few more teams, some losing out from only one part of the answer being wrong. Dean was mentally preparing himself to rise and exit the stage, but Castiel turned over his card to reveal an eerily detailed and perfectly correct answer: A burger, medium rare, with a beer to drink and pie for dessert.
Cas took Dean’s hand, rubbing his thumb over it, trailing grains of sand over his skin. “What do you want to happen?”
He settled at a table in the corner, looking through the large windows over the water. The water was choppy, with sunlight glinting off of every cresting wave. He’d barely begun his first mouthful of breakfast when a shadow fell over his table.
He crossed to the door and pulled it open. Castiel was standing in the hallway in his white button-down and slacks, coat and jacket left behind. His face was unreadable; a mix of concern, apprehension, and something else Dean couldn’t place.
He crossed to the dresser, grabbing swim trunks and the first shirt he could find, and retreated back to the bathroom. Cas stepped out of his way without a word until after Dean had emerged fully clothed and finished his bagel.
Dean opened one eye as a gentle knock came from his bedroom door. A glance at the clock told him he’d laid down over an hour ago, but he knew he hadn’t really fallen asleep. It wasn’t easy to relax when tonight might be your last night alive. He’d been here before, of course, but this time felt different. This time might stick.
“So what’s next?” Cas asked from over his shoulder, jerking him from his thoughts with an increased heart rate.
He swayed a bit in his seat, surprised when he nearly bumped skulls with Cas; they’d inched steadily closer for the last hour, but his depth perception was a little off at the moment.
He kissed Cas, a quick peck that nonetheless left them both smiling ear to ear, then let his fingers trail down Cas’ bare arm before backing away. Dean didn’t think it would be easy to fit two people in the tiny shower stall in their cabin’s bathroom, but it might be worth a try.
Dean scanned the words on each card, smiling at some, wrinkling his brow at others. He wasted a few seconds looking up at Castiel, who sat silently under his blindfold, which was an image not great for Dean’s concentration. He’d barely finished writing on the last card when the host’s voice interrupted him.
She laid a towel out a few feet away from her partner and peeled off her shirt, then eased herself onto her stomach. Dean, who hadn’t had the forethought to bring a towel, kicked off his sandals and sat beside her, knowing he’d probably regret it later when sand had found its way into holes he didn’t know he had.
He leaned in, taking Cas’ bottom lip tenderly between his own. Cas pushed into him, moving them back until Dean felt his bed hit the back of his knees. He could tell Cas tried to gracefully bend them onto the bed together, but Dean just fell back and pulled Cas down with him. Their kissing intensified, stubble scraping each other’s cheeks as Dean pulled down his sweatpants. Cas ground into him, uncertainly at first, but more forceful once Dean let out a needful whimper. The smooth material of Cas’ pants glid over the growing presence in Dean’s boxers. He reached up to undo Cas’ belt, pulling it out in one motion and tossing it aside a moment before Cas moved his mouth to Dean’s throat, grazing his teeth and tongue along his jawline. A guttural groan came out of Dean before he could stop himself.
Cas didn’t look at him when he responded, instead focusing on the people milling on the deck below them. “You know, around.”
Dean always entered every giveaway he saw. Even for stuff he didn’t want. A fake name and his phone number in a jar by the cash register, an online entry form, it didn’t matter. He liked the gamble, the possibility, even if the best thing he’d ever gotten was a set of kitchen knives, some of which had been repurposed into hunting weapons. Which is how he found himself here, begging his brother to be his plus-one on a holiday cruise that seemed too good to be true.
“Enjoying your cruise so far, Dean?” Cas’ head was on the pillow, turned toward him with such genuine contentment. If Dean had been standing, his knees might have collapsed.
Cas looked up at him, squinting against the sun before reaching under his pool chair and bringing out a bottle of water. A few drops of condensation flung off, making a trail from Cas’ chest as he brought it to his mouth, one finding its way into the dip in his clavicle. The corner of Dean’s mouth turned upward.
Walking past the kitchen on his way back to his bedroom, Dean doubled back as he caught a whiff of Sam’s spicy chili. “Hey, smells good!”
Dean reached up to untie the blindfold at the same moment Cas himself did; the resulting brush of their fingers should not have sent a jolt up his arm, and yet. Dean dropped his hand and let Castiel finish. The little ruffle of his hair that the blindfold left behind made him look even more adorable, like when you slept in too late and the pillow had had its way with you. Dean took a deep breath; he’d really brought the image on himself of Cas on a pillow, tangled in sheets next to him.
“That’s something,” Dean said, holding up a hand to feel the air. “I keep forgetting it’s nearly Christmas. You think there’s a nativity scene onboard somewhere, little baby Jesus in an innertube?”
He knew a lecture was probably brewing, but followed her onto the beach. They found Andrew, huddled under the large umbrella he’d been carrying.
“Mexico,” she replied. “Just outside of Tampico. The captain had to make an unscheduled stop overnight due to the storm, but we’re not too far from the border, so we should be back tonight on schedule.”
Dean pulled his leg back under the cover and shifted his body to one side of the bed, patting the space next to him. His eyes were closed again, probably already drifting back toward unconsciousness. Castiel could have turned and left there, but the aching pull he felt toward Dean was too great.
Once they made their way to their cabin door and inside, Cas claimed the chair in the corner while Dean settled on the edge of the bed.
“I was finished anyway,” Dean said as the announcement ended and tossed his napkin bib onto the table. “You might need to roll me back to the cabin, though.”
As if on cue, the boat seemed to shift under their feet as it came to a stop. A loud horn sounded off several decks above them, announcing their arrival.
He rose out of the water, his swimsuit clinging to him in ways Dean wasn’t prepared to have inches from his face. Dean had to carefully arrange his own suit as he made to follow, while Cas was already grabbing his coat and seeking out the source of the sound.
Ducking around poles and the occassional person, they ended up in an internal stairwell, its white-painted cement beginning to chip on the edges. The chirping was loud and echoing here, and Cas made short work of finding a tiny bird, nestled on a ridge in the corner. It recoiled when their faces appeared, but didn’t fly away. One of its wings stuck out at an odd angle, unable to return flush to its side.
There was a moment of silence as they both took sips from their drinks. The whiskey offered a soothing warmth to Dean’s throat and made him feel a tiny bit better about, well, everything.
“I...wanted to take a shower?” Cas told him, without a hint of sarcasm. Dean stared at the ceiling, exasperated, but with a hidden touch of fondness for the former angel who still didn’t quite fit in with humans. He was the same guy Dean had come to-
“Yeah,” Dean replied, in barely more than a whisper. He cleared his throat. “Yeah. We kicked ass today, didn’t we?”
Dean’s face broke the surface of the water as he propelled himself from the bottom of the pool. Other swimmers laughed and splashed around him as he ran his hands over his hair and flung the excess water off. He took a look around at the sunbathers, noting several bikini-clad women with no husbands in sight.
“I’ve lived...so many years,” Cas said, almost wistfully. “Seen countless lives come and go, seen life as we know it evolve before my eyes while I stayed the same. Decades can pass in what feels like mere moments. But I've come to realize that my years with you and Sam have given me the only truly important parts of my life.”
, hard to coexist without overanalyzing their every move. Truthfully, this had probably happened years ago, forced into dormancy by Dean’s refusal to let himself entertain the notion, to let himself feel. Every touch shared between them now brought turmoil, because he couldn’t tell Cas to
It hit Dean again that he never should have kissed him, because now it was all he could think about. He’d finally breached the tension, gotten the tiniest taste of what he’d wanted for so long. The sting of Cas’ rejection was beginning to wane, and the urge to do it again was on the rise.
Cas squinted at him. “I’m not sure I enjoy the ethical implications of you inserting yourself into broken marriages, but there’s no reason the two of
Dean began to tie the blindfold, trying not to focus on the texture of Cas’ hair under his fingertips. Once he’d finished, he circled back to his seat.
Once she and Andrew had played their hands (Kira busted with a twenty-three), the dealer flipped his remaining card, adding a ten to the eight already on the table. Dean and Cas received chips to match their bet, and Andrew, who had a hand of eighteen to match the dealer’s, was exactly where he’d begun.
Dean, who had been newly eighteen when the film released, felt himself aging into dust. “I bought a ticket to it, because I
“Okay,” she laughed as she held it up. “Are you going to stand three feet apart, or act like you’re in love?”
He tried to ground himself as Cas resumed talking. “But there’s one thing I learned that I never got to thank you for. And if this is my last chance…”
Dean groaned. “Cas. You know it’s a term of endea—” He stopped short when Cas’ eyes crinkled at the corners. “Hang on, was that a joke?”
Cas cocked his head, which had the adorable side effect of looking like he was nuzzling into the pillow. Dean could have sworn Cas’ body inched closer to him as he did. “I mean everything I say, Dean.”
Her partner, who’d stood by silently up to this point, gave a little smile and wave. His shoulder length wavy hair seemed made for life on a boat.
They stepped aboard, observing the crowds of people milling around. A few were already taking their shirts off and diving into a massive pool in the center of the deck.
“I’m terrified of losing you again,” he whispered, then let out a breathy laugh. This wasn’t the kind of conversation one tended to have in swim trunks. Apparently sleeping with Cas didn’t make Dean any less of a mess.  “Isn’t that great? I get everything I’ve ever wanted and I’m already bracing myself to lose it.”
Cas sat lightly on the bed for a moment, only inches of his backside touching it as he bent over and replaced things in his luggage. He seemed to be giving Dean a wide berth, which was interesting since the two of them had practically walked back to the cabin arm in arm, even if by necessity.
“Last night when Brian and I watched the first game, it was an excursion when we stop in Nassau,” Jeff said. “Swimming with dolphins or something. But it might be different today. We figure we have a shot at getting pretty far, but the more the merrier, right?”
In the years they’d known each other, it had become easy with Cas, a casual camaraderie unburdened by other feelings. But now Dean had made it so
Cas stared at him in silence, eyes narrowing as Dean continued to try and fail to form a coherent sentence.
The people eating around them began to grumble around mouthfuls of food. Dean looked up at Cas with a shrug.
“Good.” Dean dropped his hand. “Now, I’m going to find something to watch on TV. I can’t force you to stay, but if you’re dead set on being useful, I wouldn’t mind some company.”
Cas scooted himself up gingerly, as if he was afraid to disturb a sleeping partner. When he was finally settled, Dean could feel the warmth from his body join his own under the covers. A quick glance at Cas, so close, next to him in bed, left him lightheaded. He’d had
His first encounters with angels had disabused him of any notion that they were charming entities full of love and miracles, but here Cas was, proving he was all that and more. Dean felt fingers dig into his heart. He had just convinced himself he might be able to live again with the scraps of affection he was allowed with Cas, only to now be proven that he really fucking couldn’t. He felt hot at the neck and nauseous. This had officially crossed into the territory of
He could see Castiel take a deep breath and pause, undoubtedly another human idiosyncrasy he’d picked up, holding his eyes closed for a beat longer than a blink.
All their little truths slipping through had widened the cracks wide enough for his dam of self-preservation to burst.
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said gruffly, turning away and pulling the curtain closed behind him. “Just don’t use up the hot water before I’m finished. And don’t you dare take the big blue towel, that’s my favorite.”
“I don’t have to explain myself to you.” Dean stood up, shaking sand off himself. “We barely know each other, and you don’t know Cas and I’s relationship.”
Dean looked down at his toes. They had sunk inches without him noticing, the wet sand pulled away with the rolling tide. Funny how easily your footing can get away from you when you let your mind get in the way, not even aware of the ground under your feet until it’s gone. People could be like that, too.
“You asked where I went last night. I went here.” He gestured at the door. “I’ve been coming here most of the time you haven’t seen me, actually.”
A sad sort of smile crossed the angel’s face. “The normal things, mostly. Money, happiness. It’s remarkable how many of them, on a couples cruise, are in here alone, praying for love.”
. Dean had tried to shake off the feeling he got thinking of Cas moving around him as he slept, maybe even undressing next to the bed. He hadn’t been particularly successful.
“No, I mean it,” Dean said, his face turning serious. “My whole life is like that. The moment things seem to be going okay is the moment I need to worry. The next thing you know, everything is broken again.” He picked up his drink and downed the rest of it.
Dean scoffed. It wasn’t like he wanted Cas to follow him or watch as he walked away, but the apparent complete lack of concern still stung a bit. As much as the thought of more booze nauseated him, when he saw an open-air bar on the edge of the beach, he parked himself on a stool.
A high-pitched squeal caught Cas’ attention; he looked behind himself just in time to see a drunken woman falling into the pool, causing a large splash and much laughter from the lookers-on.
“Dinner’s at 7:00 on the promenade deck,” Dean read from the pamphlet left on the bed. “They do the time slots by room, so we’ll have to dine together, but hey, all-you-can-eat crab legs!”
Cas fell silent as they passed an open door, glimmering lights and holiday music floating out from inside. They both peered in, seeing dozens of couples slow-dancing around tinsel-covered trees and glowing candles. A large table hugged the wall, covered with finger foods, desserts, and a large punch bowl.
“Close your eyes, buddy,” he said softly. Cas obeyed, and Dean pulled the black cloth around his face. “Is that too tight?”
“Thank you,” Cas told her and Andrew, as he pulled Dean away and began to walk them back to the boardwalk. “For coming to find me.”
They could hear noises of sloppy contentment coming from a kissing couple several feet away; as they lay back on the towel and their limbs intertwined it was hard to tell where one body ended and the other began. Dean caught Cas smiling at them and voiced his reaction before he could think better of it.
“Broken things can be fixed,” he said, opening his hands to show Dean the bird again, its wing repaired. A moment of clarity rushed Dean as it hit him all over again that he’d fallen so hard there should have been an audible
It took everything in Dean’s power not to let out a whine. It was downright embarrassing to want someone so badly, to have so little control over how he felt.
“Fine,” he said, a little too quickly. Kira Leigh raised her eyebrows at him. “I’m glad to be on land for a few hours, though. I was starting to get cabin fever and imagine us going down like the
“It’s...okay.” Cas gave him a pitying look, and he hated it more than he could bear. A hot surge of shame filled his stomach. Vomiting was not out of the realm of possibility. The brief ecstasy he’d felt was quickly giving way to pain, all twisted together in his chest. Of course he’d misread things. Of course Cas didn’t want him like that. He was stupid, so
Cas led them out of the dining hall and down a large staircase to the deck below. He walked with purpose, zigzagging around obstacles and seeming to follow a familiar path into the interior of the ship, casting occasional glances back to check that Dean was still with him. They’d walked nearly the whole length of the boat when Cas turned under an awning, which led into an interior hallway.
She turned to Andrew and pointed to a spot on the beach, then marched up to Dean while her partner carried the umbrella away.
Castiel looked up from his book as two guys sat on the chair next to him, one striking up conversation. They were young and attractive, and one wore a speedo with a cutoff white shirt that showed off his midriff. He leaned closer to Cas and casually touched his arm, then said something that made him laugh, a rare sight that made irritation itch under Dean’s skin. He only realized he’d frozen in place this whole time when someone slammed into him while trying to catch a beach ball bouncing around the pool. Had they been on a hunt, getting so distracted ogling Cas could mean them ending up werewolf chow. Shaking off the embarrassing image, Dean pulled himself out of the pool and started walking toward them.
“I gotta...I’ll be right back,” Dean mumbled before scrambling away. He heard Cas’ questioning call after him, but didn’t stop on his trek back to the outer edge of the ship, holding himself up on the railings as he looked into the water below. The churning waves didn’t help his nausea, so he closed his eyes and pulled himself back upright, trying to focus on his center of gravity. By the time he was starting to feel semi-functional again, he could hear frantic footsteps approaching.
I haven’t slept with any of the gorgeous women on the boat. I was hoping to be approaching double digits by now.”
They stared at each other, Dean seeing his own uncertainty reflected in Cas’ face. It was hard to deny now that something had fundamentally changed in the makeup of their relationship. The question was whether that something was a new layer of growth, like the rings on a tree, or some kind of decay—peeling, chipped, once-lovely wallpaper, revealing the ugliness beneath.
“Uh, hey,” Dean said, leaning against the bar in a failed attempt at acting casual. “How’s it going?”
Back in their cabin, Cas eased Dean onto the bed. “I can go find some food for you. Just stay in and relax.”
The tiny cabin on a floating tourist trap, wholly unremarkable, seemed unfit for such an occasion. But as he was having trouble taking his eyes off the heavenly body in front of him, he supposed the surroundings hardly mattered anyway.
