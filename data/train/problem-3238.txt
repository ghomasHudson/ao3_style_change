He grins, a ray of sunshine flickering back to life through his gloom. "You mean, you don't go down on all
But apparently, Cas is into that. Every time I moan, the sound is accompanied by an equally feral groan or grunt, until his mouth finds purchase on my throat, then my shoulder, and then on nothing but air, a strangled cry, as he--
Cas makes a guttural, animalistic sound, clutching at the back of the couch with one hand, and gripping the back of Dean's head with the other. His legs curl, feet dragging on the sofa fabric. His cock rests against Dean's temple, heavy and wanton, but beyond an affectionate nuzzle, Dean focuses on massaging Cas' balls with his mouth and tongue, letting things get hot and messy and covered in spit and sexual frustation, because it's only going to escalate from here. His fingers slip deeper into Cas' body, which is gripping him tight--
Then, he starts in earnest; soft undulations of the hips at first, but building steadily in force until I'm reaching for the bedhead with both hands in a whiteknuckled grip, the frame shaking under our combined weight and the rhythm of Cas' thrusts. There are no lyrics to this song. The creak and shudder of iron and timber and bedsprings are the instrumental; the wet slip and slide of skin on skin is the percussion; our grunts and moans the melody. The only actual words that make it through to the surface are "Cas" (me), "Dean" (him), and "please", "yes" and "
been quieter while the other two are at home, which is mildly disappointing. But it is for the best, I suppose.
"Cas, I've...You're my only friend. But it's not just that. Look, I still don't know the answer to that thing you asked about. I don't
"I heard you talking to him, Cas. I heard him asking, and I heard you go into his room, and look, I'm not...I'm not judging, okay? I know I might not seem like the kind of guy who gets it, but...I do. I get it."
But when it was the three of us around the table, I couldn't do it. Not after what Sam said. I had to leave the room before I punched him in the face. He'd deserve it, too. He started this crapfest.
When he says he wants me, I'm impressed by the fact that I manage to say, you know, actual words. Even if they are just: "How many times you gonna make me tell you to shut up, Cas?"
But once I've closed us into the dim, firelit warmth of the room, I've run out of excuses to keep my distance.
It's Cas who moves. In a couple of purposeful strides, he closes the distance between us. My instincts call this movement a threat, and they're still working well enough that I scramble to my feet and start backing away, but I'm not fast enough. One of his hands grips my shoulder, right where the scar still twinges sometimes, and his other hand is on the back of my neck, and--
The hurricane in my gut hasn't settled enough for me to sit down yet, so I make my way around the little room closing curtains. It's too early in the season to snow this close to the lake, but there was rain forecast on the radio, maybe a storm overnight, and heavy frost by morning, so might as well try to keep the place warm.
I stalk back over to my bedside table and toss Sam the keys. I can't think of anything to say, so I just...don't say anything.
"Dean...Sam and I have had several...important conversations...in your absence. And you and I...well, uh...I...we need to talk."
Humans have the concept of 'the five stages of grief'. It is usually used when they talk about death, especially the loss of their own life, or that of a loved one. But it works as a general description of how they respond to something they fear, as well. Supposedly, in order of occurrence, the stages are: anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. From Dean, I had expected anger or denial. Instead, his reaction seems much closer to depression.
"Yes, sir," Dean says again, but not at all sarcastic this time. This time, he lets his voice drop into a tone of obedience and go all husky, because he knows Cas likes it. He reaches a second time for the lube and spreads it thickly over his cock, then reaches for Cas' hips with one hand, using the other to hold himself steady as he pushes through the twitching rim of Cas' asshole.
"I'm sorry to make you uncomfortable, Dean," Cas ventures gently. "I know it was selfish of me to come here like this. But you wouldn't answer my texts or my calls, and I was concerned."
Tonight, the others are out. It is just Dean and I, and whatever this preposterous movie is called--I'm not sure. I haven't been paying attention. I am preoccupied by the way that Dean's hair feels against my cheek, and conscious of the fact that I must hold my position carefully so that his head does not fall forward.
His dick is thicker than his fingers. Thicker, and fuller, but also rounder and more forgiving: there's a pliant layer of velvety-softness over its unforgiving core. It's not
Cas nods in reply, so Dean extricates himself gently. The couch has suffered already, and matters do not improve when Dean pulls free of Cas' body, but that will have to be a tomorrow problem.
By the time he pulls away, I'm shaking for an entirely different reason than before. So is he. His slacks are more, uh, revealing than my jeans, and I don't--I'm not--I can't think right. I'm in pretty much the same condition as him. Maybe worse. He takes one of my hands, and guides the back of my fingers over his scruffy cheek before pressing his lips to my knuckles, his blue eyes shifting back up to lock with mine as my thumb rests against his lower lip.
"I am flattered, Dean. I do not know if I am worthy of such devotion. But I am selfish, so I accept it, with gratitude."
If Sam is to be believed, I have actually done an exceptionally poor job of concealing my feelings. Sam thinks that the problem lies with Dean: that he suffers from 'perception bias', which means that he only notices things that confirm what he already believes. Which, in turn, led Sam to suggest that, for my own sake, the best course of action would be to just tell the truth, in as simple and direct a way as possible.
Every instinct I have wants me to apologise; to say that it was nothing. But I'm not sorry, and it isn't nothing. And now that I understand why he left the bunker so suddenly, I am not going to allow him to misunderstand again. He needs to know.
I take the book back to my room and spend ten minutes staring at the front cover. Eventually, I open it and start to flick through, stopping when a word or phrase catches my attention. But before I even get past the contents pages, I've hit a phrase so dumb that it makes me snap the book shut and throw it across the room.
Often, during these movie nights, he would fall asleep partway through a beer or a bowl of popcorn, and my challenge would be to extricate whatever he was holding from his grip before he fell so fast asleep that he spilled it and jolted awake, ready to fight the closest living thing--which was, invariably, me.
I lie still for a little while, trying to adjust--to the dark; to the feelings; to the sense of secondary satisfaction I get from his orgasm. A good few minutes go by, and then reclaim my hand again, wiping a little of the stickiness off onto the bedclothes. I wriggle forward so that I can rest my forehead on his cheek; feeling him smile as I do.
Cas, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth, eases a finger inside me. His eyes are bright--glassy, even--which is how I know he's just as close to breaking point as I am.
This time, the sound I make has an unintentional note of appreciation to it, and he smiles. A warm hand grips the back of my thigh, and he pulls me forward so that my knee hooks over his leg. He shifts closer, and I obediently raise my head so he can slip his outstretched bed-side arm under my neck.
"Dean." I am mesmerised by the way our hands fit together so neatly. "The last time I sought comfort in a human, it did not end well. And I think that a part of that might...might have been because I was...insincere."
As though in the distance, I hear him grind out my name once more, with a particular note of bewilderment and ecstacy. He's coming with me; the shockwaves of pleasure rippling through me creating the epicentre of his own shuddering orgasm. Through half-shut eyes, I see the tendons in his neck straining; eyelids fluttering; lips parted, lost in awe...I feel the wet heat as he unloads inside me, and I close my eyes, too, savouring the sensations as he goes slack, collapsing against me, burying his face in the crook of my neck as his heart pounds against my ribcage.
His body bucks against me. An unfamiliar hot wetness fills my insides, and I just keep thinking about blue oceans of holy fire.
Dean closes his eyes and tips his head back against the wall, savouring the motions of Cas’ fingers. "Need...you," he gasps out.
Dean whimpers. It's a pained, strangled sound. He kisses Cas again in a desperate attempt to muffle the sound, clutching the angel's body crushingly close.
I cease massaging the knots of muscle to give him a stern look, then use my grip on his torso to force him to sit on the bed.
I stand up, moving away from Cas, turning away from them both to try and hide the fact that I'm roughly the colour of a beetroot, and to conceal from Sam the awkward fact that I've got a semi.
I don't really buy into all that touchy-feely self-help crap. That's Sam's schtick. But he gave the book to Cas, and
Dean's kind of disgusted, but his cock doesn't give a damn what he thinks of himself. He leans in; lets his weight shift; kind-of-not-at-all-accidentally lets Castiel take over. And his submission is all the sweeter because they both
He puts the gun down, and goes over to where Cas is lying along the couch, with his feet up on the armrest. Cas had finally allowed his wardrobe to expand beyond suits and trenchcoats. He even owns his own clothes. Still, in the same way he has his own room but only uses Dean's, most of the time at least one thing he's wearing technically belongs to Dean. And Dean, it turns out, kind of gets off on seeing Cas lounge around in
"I love you freely," I say, quietly. "I love you, and there are no conditions on that love. And I do not expect anything from you, either. If you--"
Dean kisses me back before he realises that he's doing it. When the reality does sink in, adrenaline emanates from him like a shockwave. He pushes me away and staggers backwards, hands outstretched, palms raised and held out towards me. It's part warning and part supplication, but it's all just...fear. Fear, when I'd expected anger. Not just 'what the hell' anger, either--more like broken-nose anger. And although I do not like the way that his eyes are suddenly filled with some heartrending combination of suffering and self-loathing, I am somewhat relieved that he is not resorting to his customary violence.
Dean returns the favour, but is more thorough--he briefly and gently pushes Cas' hand away so that he can strip him of pants and underwear in one fell swoop.
He arches his back while Cas pulls out and gently lets him down. The angel ducks lightly out of Dean’s embrace to free his wrists from the belts, and, while Dean gingerly stretches out his shoulders, studies their spattered torsos with interest.
Cas grab him by the collar and shove him back against the wall. He's the one who spreads his own legs, deliberately shifting to push his crotch against Cas' thigh. He's the one who presses a hand to Cas' junk, his palm and fingers curling when he makes the gratifying discovery that he's already got a semi. He's the one whose skin gets covered in gooseflesh when his gentle pressure makes Cas growl in a way that is both protest and approval.
It takes him a moment. He glances up at me searchingly, so I allow the corner of my lips to curve upwards, to confirm it was a joke.
I clear my throat. I've got things to say, before my head interferes and rounds up all the emotions that are leaking out of the dark corners where I've been keeping them.
Kissing Cas is kind of like kissing the ocean. There's a tide; an ebb and flow; a give and take. But ultimately, Dean is surrounded. Enveloped. Sucked into something far greater than himself, and far, far beyond his comprehension.
with him. It's not like the other kiss, outside. This time, I am ready, and I am willing. His...his...grace, I suppose, envelops me; it settles the storm inside me. There is calm, and there is peace, and there is his soft mouth, and his rough stubble, and his warm skin.
Dean will never in a million years admit to another living soul how that look of pure, unadulterated affection makes him feel. Never. Chick-flick moments are not his thing. But there’s that little niggle in the back of his throat and the corners of his eyes, because an angel’s love is…well, it’s overwhelming. All that time he spent, thinking that angels didn’t know how to love like humans do. He was half-right, as it turned out: angels
." His fingers bite roughly into my shoulders, and he pushes down into my touch. I have never felt anything like the shudder that courses through him then, and he makes no attempt to control the his volume as he cries out, gasping with a pleasure that makes me ache in unspeakable ways.
Cas’ immeasurable strength is more than up to the task of supporting him. Dean’s physical exertion is starting to cause little droplets of sweat to form on his skin, but those beads of sweat starting to glisten on Cas' forehead like a crown have nothing to do with physical effort--he’s just trying to contain himself; trying to let Dean call the shots.
hunger and thirst. Pure need. Impure need. Whatever. It's a need that Dean wants to be the only one to fulfil. He knows that there were one or two before him, but he doesn't
Dean latches on to the instructions like a lifeline. It's always like this: when he gets frayed at the edges, and starts to unravel, in bad ways, or sad ways, Cas--his voice, his touch--is the thread that stitches him back together. He was just a rag when Cas found him, but his angel has turned him into a tapestry. Cas once told him that he was beautiful, and all he could think, then and now, was
It's kind of amazing that he's being so patient with me. I don't think I could be like him, if our roles were reversed. But he's just calm and quiet: no rush, no push, no demands. He's just
What he wouldn’t give to get back a little of the control he once had over his lust. He used to be deliberately hedonistic, but that wasn't to say he didn't
him inside me; his soft lips on my neck, mouth, or temple; stubble prickling my skin; bunched muscle colliding with different parts of me.
It sounds more like an accusation than a question. And he's made a mistake. He's exposed his throat.
"Well, I'm sorry, anyway," he'd said, sincerely. "I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable. I'm glad, Cas. You both seem so much
Slowly, gently, his brow furrowed, Cas holds me firm against the chair and draws his head back, his lips red and his mouth slick and messy with spit.
I've still got my arms spread over the back of the sofa, but I shift them now, to take his face in my hands again and press a chaste kiss to his mouth.
"I, uh, just came down to ask if I could borrow the Impala. I thought I'd take Jack out for a drive...there's this...thing...a couple towns over, so I thought maybe I'd take him, but, you know, he likes the Impala best, so..."
I briefly consider just having another beer, but beer isn't enough to settle my nerves right now. Not in this crazy lucid dream I'm having. That thing he said...well, he said it less than five minutes ago, but I already forgot how it sounded. I reach for it on my mind and find nothing. And my brain says
I can feel my cheeks burning. Even in the dark, I'm embarrassed to look at him. But I do it anyway--I force myself to look.
Normally there's not a bunch of difference between what I think and how I feel. But what's happening now is not 'normal', not by any stretch of the imagination. And what I think and what I feel have never been so far apart. The things that I'm thinking...I've thought them for decades, and I believed them. Things about myself, and they won't change--
Still, it's insane that this was Sam's go-to to help Cas with his 'people skills'. Surely there are better options than a book on marriage counselling. I mean, Cas isn't married. Sure, maybe
I'm glad I got away. I needed to be by myself. To think. To breathe. And it's peaceful out here. No Sam. No Cas. Just me and baby and classic rock mixes. We're okay. We’re good. Everything’s okay.
I have learned to watch his eyes for the emotions that he thinks he masks so cleverly, as well as the ones he lets show.
While they were gone, Jack and I had a conversation about aspects of Dean's personality, and why some topics (i.e. Dean and my relationship) and particular words (i.e. love) would be best avoided for the time being. Jack responded with great maturity, given that he is so young. We both recognised the probability that mistakes would be made, but agreed that we would deal with any situations if and when they arose.
"Take your coat off and sit down, will you?" I meant to say it nicely, you know, but it comes out a little harsh. Still, Cas doesn't seem to take it personally: he simply does as I ask, hanging up his coat on one of the hooks by the door, then perching awkwardly on the edge of one of the armchairs by the fireplace.
He blinks lazily as he processes the question, his face flushed and his hand still stroking my thigh.
He puts a hand on my chest, his fingertips trailing over my skin, and reaches under my leg to stabilise his cock with the other.
Cas is getting much better at reading Dean's facial expressions. It only takes about three seconds of the Look before he realises there's about to be Trouble, and he quickly concedes.
I move my hand over Cas' cock, trying to copy the way he was touching me, earlier--the way he rounded his palm and rubbed against me to create that toe-curling tension.
It is the first time since we have been...intimate...that he has invited me to watch a movie. And we have been intimate quite a few times now. Thirty-seven, to be exact. Each time as rewarding as the first.
Cas closes his eyes a moment scanning the building, then reopens them. "Not yet," he says. "But they're on their way. In the meantime, you'll just need to stay quiet."
the thought. He'd never have picked himself as the jealous type, but he doesn't want anyone else to see this side of Castiel. The naked side. The rippling physique, muscles taut and bulging with the strain of holding back the fire and flood of his superhuman lust. The power in him, and the way he controls it. Luckily, by Cas' own admission, Dean is the only one who can satiate him.
But Dean is too aroused to be genuinely irritated, and his exhalations become audibly shaky as Cas pulls the belt free of his trousers and begins to loop it neatly through itself--a figure of eight, with a long tail.
before the Empty because of the unspoken thing between the two of them, and he certainly hasn’t been with anyone else since he got him back.
I'm cumming down his throat, and he just takes it, holding me steady as my hips buck and my cock twitches and I wonder if I'm actually having a really obscene wet dream, because no way can he
"Jealous, Dean?" Cas responds smoothly, as he tests his handiwork, tugging lightly on the long end of the belt. He reaches up overhead, his untucked shirt brushing over Dean's naked skin and eager cock. This is followed by a frown and a muted rumble of irritation. No buckle, Dean realises, to slip over the hook. But Cas is nothing if not resourceful: after a moment's contemplation, he pulls Dean's belt from his jeans, and does something with
I feel him sigh as I gently tighten my grip, and I duck under his chin to press my lips against his throat. He gets harder in my hand. A low rumble of pleasure starts somewhere deep in his chest, and escapes him in a hungry moan. I feel his teeth scrape lightly over the shell of my ear; the huff of an embarrassed laugh as he pulses in my grip.
Still keeping my hands to myself, I add, "And, with your permission, I would like very much to kiss you again."
it happened, how quickly things went balls-up, it didn't fully register in his brain that Cas was dead--not until he saw his trenchcoat floating on the surface of the water. And he kept that coat, always, from month to month and car to car, because in spite of Cas being a frigging idiot, and in spite of Dean's shock and bewilderment, on some level he could understand. He understood the reasons Cas had buddied up with Crowley. He'd done almost exactly the same thing when he'd lost Sam. He knew better than anyone how you could end up doing the wrong thing, the most amazingly stupid thing, for the right reasons. So he
It's worth it. It makes him go a bit crazy. His grip tightens on my hips, and he starts to push in and out of me, real slow. The feeling is unbelievable: the fullness when he's in deep, and then the hollowness when he draws back...He never pulls out completely, though. I don't let him. I don't want to be empty. No thank you. I want that magic-fingers feeling back. I want him to make me quake from head to toe.
I slick my fingers again, and then press two fingers against him. It is smooth and easy, this time; like he's hungry for it. My stomach flutters with desire, like a flock of birds has just taken flight inside me.
More often than not, we share Dean's room now. And more often than not, although I do not sleep, I lie with him while he does. He says he sleeps better that way.
I nod slowly, and he rises from his armchair to kneel before me, gently taking my whisky glass from my hand.
He snaps the seal, uncaps it, and lets the lube ooze, thick and glistening, into his palm. Sets the tube aside and reaches for me, his skin warm under the cool liquid. He tightens his grip into a loose fist, and lets his hand rise and fall around me, the heavy silence filled by the inelegant but erotic sound of the viscous gel as it is trapped between our skin.
The first and second days I'm gone, between Cas and Sam I end up with seventeen missed calls and about forty-six unread texts. I don’t bother checking what they said. I just flick back two words to each of them--
suddenly feels so empty.  It's silent, but for the soft, hiccupping sound of his sobs as he starts to cry, the tears now coming in a torrent, falling thick and fast through his hands and onto his sleeves, his shirtfront, the floor--pitter-pattering, soft like rain.
He gives me a sharp glance, although the cutting effect is dulled by the fact that he is still clinging to me, and the rapid drumming of his heartbeat, too close to my chest to hide.
"You make me feel so...human, Dean," he murmurs. I can feel the heat of a blush where my forehead touches his cheek.
Suddenly he's nudging at that place again, and those waves are back, lapping at my senses; a quivering all through my body; fingers, toes, scalp, stomach...The arousal magnifies everything. I can feel each individual drop of sweat on my skin now, along with the frighteningly intimate feeling of every detail of every inch of him.
Cas is genuinely puzzled, but he relents quickly when Dean gives him an exasperated look and says, "Because you're about to start dripping
That underlying aroma flicks a switch and clouds Dean’s senses. It makes his heart race and his breath quicken, like he’s been drowning without it, and desperately needs to fill his lungs with it again.
It goes in easy. Dean is so mellow that he just melts around him, clenching and pulling and drawing him up. And Cas reads him: knows when to push, and when to stop. The ebb and flow between them is perfect. Synergetic.
I feel him disappear. His absence is sudden and absolute; like a part of my soul has just up and gone.
--deep. God, so deep. It's like his throat is beckoning to me. His hands are heavy as he pushes them roughly up my thighs to slide his fingers through my belt-loops, pulling my hips forward.
For the first time, he actively wants his anger. He wants it to envelop him with its protective heat. He wants to break everything around him, and then himself. But there is no anger in him to be weaponised. He has moved beyond the realms of anger into despair.
When I say that, the corner of his mouth twitches. I know he's laughing at me, but I'm also too horny to give a crap.
Why am I like this? Why do I say that, when what I mean is 'I'm glad you came', but also 'having you here scares the ever-loving crap out of me', and 'tell me you love me again', but also 'I don't deserve you'?
He raises a shaking hand to his lips. His green eyes are wide with panic; his pupils dilate; cheeks flushed. When I kissed him, he'd dropped the beer he'd been holding. It has fallen onto the weathered planks, a wide arc of foamy liquid spilling across the timber. Consequently, the fresh lakeside air is flavoured by the pungent smell of fermented grain, and beer froth fizzes into nothingness at our feet. But Dean's eyes are locked firmly on mine as he struggles to comprehend what has transpired between us.
A small moan passes through his lips, but it is just a sound, lacking independent meaning. I shush him gently, and shift my weight so that his head can rest more securely on my shoulder.
Touch his parted lips with my thumb, momentarily forgetting about the cum on my hand. Not that it matters.
It's not exactly a big room, but Cas stands in the middle of it, away from me. Trying to give me space? I don't know. I feel nauseous.
I place my hands either side of his neck, for balance, and as I drop down into his lap, he’s forced to move his stabilising hand to accommodate me. He moves his hands down and splays them wide over my hips. Not doing anything but holding me; hard fingers and warm palms pressing into my skin.
The angel who almost lost his faith, only to place it into Dean’s dubious safekeeping. Imagine that--you’re thousands of years old, and everything you thought you knew falls apart in front of you, and instead of just giving up your ruined faith, you go right ahead and place it, damaged and fragile as it is, in the clumsy hands of this one guy from Kansas who goes around killing things, and not even for money. A guy who didn’t finish school; a guy who had, as heterosexually as possible, slutted his way around America for decades; a guy who drinks too much, and eats too much, and talks too much, and has trouble using the internet. In spite of all that, in spite of the never-ending list of Dean’s faults and failings and dumb decisions, Cas
This balance between us is a fragile thing. It has taken many years of learning. Learning to read the lines on his face. The way a line at the corner of his lips is a warning sign of anger or disapproval, while one particular crease in his forehead is, rather than anger, a sign that he feels vulnerable, but is prepared to be comforted.
He spreads his arms and bears down, using his shoulders to press Cas' raised knees to his chest. Pliant and greedy, Cas sinks into the cushions, his hands overhead, gripping roughly at the sofa's arm as he drags Dean all the way inside him.
. I don't think I've made it to a full erection this quick since I was...what...fourteen? And why the
"Did God drop you on your head when you were a baby or something? Cas, you can't be...I...you can't be serious."
"My turn to be flattered," I say against his throat. I squeeze his cock as I suck at the tender skin where his jaw meets his neck, and he writhes against me, a note of urgency creeping into his moan.
that Cas doesn't need it: that he could overpower Dean in a heartbeat. But he doesn't, and he doesn't need to. Dean is ready and willing. The fight in him is all bravado. He
His breath hitches; fingers tightening on my shoulders as he opens his eyes to look at me. They are heavy-lidded, but I already knew he was aroused; he is half-hard, and brushing against my stomach.
"Cas, if...if this is a joke, it's not funny," he says, his eyebrows knotting together as he glowers.
Confusion flits through Cas' eyes, replaced moments later by understanding. He hums agreement and, holding his gaze, unbuttons and unzips Dean's jeans, sliding one hand under the denim to squeeze him gently through the soft cotton of his underwear.
I hear it splash in the distance, but I can't drag my eyes away from his. I feel like I'm pinned to the spot by two big stupid soulful blue javelins.
Fireworks. Whiteness. Darkness. Everything and nothing. A mess on his stomach, some high and some low; some of it dripping down between us, where our skin meets; adding a new wetness to the gross squelching of him moving inside me as my body convulses. I'm vaguely aware of the sound of my voice, distorted by pleasure--that I've made a lot of noise, and that even now, my ecstatic panting is loud.
Dean silences him with a rough kiss and a series of deep, slow thrusts that have Cas moaning into his mouth. He feels like his heart might burst with everything he feels for Cas, let alone his cock, which has been waiting patiently, swollen and ready, compressed by Cas' insides.
His answer is another kiss--this one much less chaste than the one I gave him. This kiss is messy and wet and demanding. He can't say that little word, 'Yes', with his voice, but he says it clear enough with his tongue.
This made Dean profoundly uncomfortable. He proceeded to go into hiding for several hours, refusing to talk to any of us, until eventually Sam was able to coax him back out and assuage his embarrassment by taking him on an interstate hunting trip.
Dean moans as his dick pulses. His jeans are too restrictive. He reaches down, fumbling; his free hand on autopilot. Belt buckle. Button. Zipper.
I may not have known what to expect, but even so, this question takes me off-guard. And, embarrassingly, I do not know the answer. My love for Dean has been gradual. It has unfurled softly since I met him, and learned that he is both brave and fearful; as clever as he is foolish; that he is as kind and gentle as he is rough and ready. That he cares deeply for the world and the people in it. That he is loyal to a fault. And that he has the conviction to do what he believes is right, even when facing impossible odds.
"I'm here, Dean. I'm here," he murmurs. His voice is syrupy and soothing. "It's okay. We're okay. We're here. Together."
He taught me--Well, I mean, he taught me a lot of things. But I'm thinking of how he taught me about a different way of being, and about a different kind of strength--a kind I'd never seen till I met him. And I don't mean his turbo-powered angel schtick. That's not what makes him who he is.
talk. It has to be a conversation," I reply, casting a glance at him. "I am...I am new to this, Dean. As you well know, I have little experience in relationships. In fact, I have never
"Cas..." He closes his eyes and swallows hard. He needs to compose himself. "Cas, I want to...I want to be in you."
I used to find it perplexing, the way he'd insist on watching something with me, and then unfailingly fall asleep while it was on. But I came to understand that the background noise of hokey voices and galloping horses and that ridiculous, unrealistic whistling sound which heralds a high-noon shoot-out is something that he finds genuinely soothing. I cannot say that I understand it. But if it helps him to rest, I will not complain.
All I know is that at first, having his finger up there was a little uncomfortable. Not too much--just a little awkward. Then, after a while, it felt pretty good. When he tried two fingers, it felt like...like...I don't know what like. Not normal Fun Times--I didn't blow my load or anything. I just...kind of...melted. It was just…the kind of awesome that makes your scalp tingle. A Magic Fingers motel bed on steroids.
He silences me with a bleary kiss to the side of my mouth as he hoists himself clumsily onto my lap. "Shut up, Cas," he says, and then, when I begin to object, "No--
Dean can't help the impulse to be a smartass, despite the number of times people have tried to beat it out of him.
Still smirking, Cas steps away; goes over to the bedside table and gets the lube out of the drawer. Dean unbuttons his shirt and pulls off his t-shirt, and by the time he's done that, Cas has returned, setting the lube on the tallboy at Dean's side and reaching for the front of his own trousers.
body. I plant my free hand on his chest, holding him down, and he changes the angle he's pushing at slightly, using me as his lever point. We’re using each other: our bodies saying the things we don’t have the language for.
He doesn't say anything, so I pretend not to notice him. He waits a little while, but eventually breaks the silence.
"You don't have to explain. Actually, maybe it's better if you don't. Just...go back to him. Leave me here. Please. I need some peace."
but there was still more than one time when I hooked up with a girl who was into putting something up Column A while doing other stuff to Column D.
"Can't we just do it again?" he says, a plaintive note creeping into his tone. It would be almost childish, except that the topic is most definitely Adult.
why Cas had been a whole new dimension of idiot, and honestly, part of his anger was at himself for missing the signs that Cas was going Dark Side in the first place.
Dean, on the other hand, kisses Cas with hunger. He tends to kiss him on the mouth; to play a game of catch and release with lips and tongue. Like now--as he's drawing back from the kiss, he's tugging Cas' lower lip ever-so-gently with his teeth.
Dean has closed his eyes. He leans back slightly, rocks gently against me, and that involuntary rumble emerges from my throat again.
He swallows hard, and lets the lust, the hunger, rise again. Holds Cas' gaze, and raises one hand to gently grip his throat. The fluttering pulse under his fingers is another sensation that pulls him back into his body, back into
The prospect of sex with Cas has him pathetically eager, like he's back to being a teenager. Every single time.
I make fun of him for looking like a holy tax accountant, but he's not that weedy--not really. Not when you see what's under the suit. The lines of his body are smooth and well-rounded. His chest is strong and broad, and his arms and shoulders are thick with muscle; muscle that is highlighted, because the dimness of the lamplight just deepens every shadow, and heightens the contrast created by, for instance, the swell of his biceps.
He bites his lip to suppress a wave of expletives as he slides through the tight ring of smooth muscle. Cas' nails bite into his skin: the angel sighs and folds around him; thighs clasping at his waist; back arching as he draws him in deeper. Time and reality seem to fold as well--or rather, Dean loses all sense of both. He loses all sense of anything that's not the way Cas' body clenches around his cock.
I'm shocked by the intensity of it, but I'm on autopilot, following my instincts and rocking gently, moving my body around him while he pulses inside me.
He was afraid of how Sam and Jack would react, as the physicality and the new intensity of our bond became more obvious. But Sam already knew about what was going on between us. And Jack...well, Jack is very observant. The morning after the fifth or sixth time Dean and I had had relations, entirely his own accord, Jack sat us down in the library to state unequivocally that he thought we were sleeping together, that he approved of our union, and that he was glad that Dean was comfortable enough not to be embarrassed about him overhearing things.
"Alright, alright, big fella. No rush. I'm not going anywhere," I say condescendingly, mostly so I can pretend I'm not even hornier than him. It doesn't work: he shoots me a knowing look as he settles his weight back between my thighs, and takes my balls between the slicked-up fingers of one hand. The way he touches me makes me whimper, and that's the end of any pretense of superiority on my part.
Dean's chest aches. His throat is tight. His eyes sting, and he can't breathe. He wants to scream, to throw something, to smash the chair into the wall, to smash
The first time, the time Cas exploded at the snap of Lucifer's fingers, he came back so fast that it all might as well never have happened. Sure, he came back different--all juiced up, as a seraph (so suck on that, Lucy)--but he wasn't gone for long enough for Dean to really feel the loss.
Sounds like a loud of bull to me. I mean, ‘acts of service’ just sounds kinda dirty. And anyway, Cas doesn't really touch me.
The skin of his dick is soft, but beneath the surface he's rock-hard. Its swollen head glistens in the faint glow of the lamplight. I curl my fingers around him and slide them down, right down to the base, alternating between a tighter and a looser grip  as I move steadily up and down...
it. Quite the opposite: back then, he chose it. But now? Now Dean knows what it feels like to have Cas inside him, and how it feels to be inside Cas, and there’s no going back from that. No recovery. He can't control that level of desire. He can't control much of anything when he's with Cas.
His breath catches in his throat as I caress him, and I take a slightly firmer grip, letting the soft folds of cloth create additional friction, catching lightly on itself when it becomes trapped between our skin.
He has closed his eyes, leaning back into the pressure of my fingers as I let them travel up the small of his back.
Dean does as he's told. The leather is smooth around his wrists: with artisanal precision, Cas pulls it tight, but not too tight.
is something that he craves. Every minute they’re together, he longs for it. Possessive, but not controlling; a look that says
"Maybe I should just keep you here like this," Cas says, but his voice is hoarse, and Dean can see that the angel's human urges are close to victory.
Dean's heartrate is already elevated. He is breathing heavily, his forehead pressing against mine, his lips parted and his eyes closed.
I light a match. The flame catches quickly on the kindling, crackling to life, and the door groans on its ancient metal hinges as I push it shut, the flames multiplying and licking at the glass.
It's supposed to be a threat, but it sounds like begging. God, I'm pathetic. I'm literally shaking with how bad I want it; hungry; desperate.
Then, his eyes still fixed on me, he slowly and deliberately unfurls his arm to frisbee it out into the lake.
I do not pursue him as he retreats from me. I mirror his gesture, instead: holding up my own hands in an effort to appear calm and reassuring. It works on large, frightened animals, so with any luck, it may also work on this large, frightened human.
The eye contact is unwavering. Oceans of blue fire setting my nerves alight. He moves the hand on my chest and puts his arm around my shoulders instead, steadying me. As he does that, there's a flicker of concern in the unyielding blue.
Then there was the third time. The time with the reaper, Annie or Abigail or whatever. No...April. That's right; April. And this time, Dean is stricken with guilt, because this time, it's very, very real. There's no Lucifer or Leviathan to distract from the fact that Cas is dead. Cas, who literally couldn't pick up a chick at a strip joint, gets seduced by a reaper who was hired to kill him. And she does kill him. And it's Dean's fault, all of it. It's Dean's fault Cas lost his grace; Dean's fault Cas is human; Dean's fault that Cas trusts the fake 'human' April too easily, and gets sucked in by the bitch. But as if nearly losing him wasn't bad enough, after Zeke brings him back, it gets worse. No sooner does he have Cas somewhere safe, back
I let gravity and my leg muscles do the work as I lower myself onto him. It's a lot easier than I expected. Pretty much exactly like sliding a blade into its sheath...or, well, the sheath onto the blade, anyway. I go slow, and it's working for us both--Cas holding my gaze as firmly and carefully as he holds my shoulders, wonder and ecstasy in his eyes. A little sigh or groan escapes his thick pink lips every now and then, but otherwise, he's quiet, like a man at worship.
It works. Making a visible effort to control his movements, Cas strips Dean of the rest of his clothes, then his own, kicking them into an inelegant heap on the floor. He slicks his fingers, the fire in his eyes now entirely unholy. Takes a hold of Dean's cock with the cool, wet fingers of one hand; slides a dripping fingertip of the other between his ass-cheeks and into his asshole. Dean's muscles only offer token resistance. With his wrists tied, his cock in Cas' hand, and his soul getting sucked deep into those blue, blue eyes, same as how his body is sucking Cas' fingers in--first one, now two...he feels like he doesn't know how to resist; like he never did. He trusts Cas. He wants him. He really does need him.
Dean cherishes this moment. There is something about it: about the way they're pressed close together, lips parted, staring into each others' eyes as they breathe unevenly through the terrifying intimacy and vulnerability of being together.
; but he is patient; he will not be rushed; he has me pinned down and at his mercy and he sucks me off, his throat tight, right up until I try to warn him with my hands and words that I'm gonna cum, and cum
a meaningful physical or sexual relationship. Not while in full possession of my consciousness and memories. I...need your help, and I ask for your patience."
So he does what he knows Cas can't stand--he braces against his bonds, looks at him through lowered eyelashes, and lets a note of pleading creep into his voice. "Cas,
I also feel that Dean is moderately aroused. The sensation of him against my leg makes me respond in kind, almost straight away. Physicality can be...inconvenient.
He swirls the whisky in his glass, his brow furrowing a little. "Yes. I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable. I should not have said it. I felt that you should know, but I did not mean any harm. And I do not want to lose you. If it's not a feeling you return, I--"
It's a hunter's funeral, but Cas was not a hunter. Even when he hunted with them, he was still an angel. Not the same at all. An angel who pulled Dean out of hell; an angel who broke ranks to side with a couple of grubby humans; an angel who defied God; an angel who did anything and everything he could, for Dean's sake.
Cas--soft; glowing--back to Castiel, Angel of the Lord, Commander of the Garrison--icy; commanding--and Dean gets up, meekly, to take his jeans the rest of the way off and to do as he's told.
Jack also suggested wiping Dean's memory, but I managed to dissuade him. What's done is done. I am a little disappointed about the prospect of Dean holding back on his enthusiasm, but I feel that more importantly it is a lesson for Jack on improving his social graces. Not only in the sense that he needs to learn what to say and when to say it, but also in the sense that family do not wipe each other's minds. Of course, I do not mention my disappointment
He looks abashed, but he obeys, resting his now-sticky hand on my shoulder to balance himself as he straddles my thighs. He settles over me, and my throbbing erection sits neatly between his muscular glutes. The way they squeeze me lightly as he adjusts his weight is indecently pleasurable. I hear a voice rumble appreciatively, but it takes a few moments before I realise that the sound is me.
The lube ends up all kinds of weird places, but he finds it wrapped in the duvet at the foot of the bed and forces himself to go back to the couch
It doesn't matter, though. Cas tries to help them seal Lucifer in that alternate reality, and it...doesn't work. Lucifer kills him. A second time. The ultimate irony being that Lucifer's kid probably would have been dead already without Cas' protection.
His underwear does approximately nothing to hide his boner. If anything, it kind of draws attention to it, because for some reason Cas upheld Jimmy Novak's preference for white shorts, and...well, white stands out in the dark, and other things are, uh, standing. So.
what it feels like to have that tight elastic wrapped around your balls--it'll be borderline, for sure; close to painful without crossing the line; it'll bring him right to the edge, and keep him there.
By that logic, if the theory and the sequence of the five stages is correct, then...perhaps he is closer to acceptance than I could have ever dared to hope.
I find mine in the weight of his head on my shoulder, and the sound of his gentle snoring. Sometimes, when the film is over and I turn off the screen, I spend a while looking at his reflection, watching the lines of anger and care fall away from his face. He is frequently confused when he wakes, but I learned that for him there is a five-minute buffering period in that process, so I have almost always managed to take my leave in time for him to not even remember I was there.
He knows--he reaches for my thigh, his fingers drawing slow, deliberate circles on my hip, and trailing lazily over my ass cheek.
I’m forced to loosen my hold on him as he pulls back a little, looking at me with those pale blue eyes. Always so blue, even when there’s barely any light.
He pulls his head back and exhales sharply, his brow furrowing a little. He groans; a low, desperate sound. I am momentarily concerned, but as he repeats the sound I feel the tight pressure on my finger easing, and I slip another knuckle's depth into him--because of
He breathes in the warm smell of Cas' throat. Tastes the faint flavour of coffee on his tongue, which he now drinks whenever Dean does; mostly, Dean suspects, just to be companionable.
He begins to shift his weight; I feel the ripple of restrained strength as his hand moves to my chest, then my shoulder, with a pressure that is more of a gentle inquiry than a statement; a nudge rather than a push, as he tests for my reaction. I understand the question, though, and the answer is
The heavy silence is punctuated by the clinking of metal on metal as he twists and pulls, testing his restraints.
I nod again, licking my dry lips and shifting back into the armchair. I'm too ashamed to speak, but Cas just smiles at me, the corners of his eyes crinkling softly as he unbuttons and unzips my pants. He only pulls my underwear down enough to let little Dean make his leap to freedom.
"Well...that wasn't quite true. And just now, saying you're my best friend...I...that ain't quite right either.
In the sudden darkness, he's breathless; pulsating in my hand; shuddering, shaking, and still holding onto me like I'm the only thing keeping him together.
He just smirks at me, pushing his palm down on my boner through my jeans and immediately making me a liar, because there's something about the slow friction of the way he rubs me that is
Dean buries his face in the crook of Cas' neck as he tries to recover his senses. It's a hell of a mess they've just made between them, but try as he might, he can't bring himself to be disgusted.
I mean, obviously there’s Mom, and Dad, and Bobby, and all the other friends we’ve found along the way--there are other people I
Dean Winchester: a man who does not know how to be wanted just because of who he is. He needs to hear it. He needs to know.
As always, up close, Cas smells sharp and hot. Dean gets a whiff of peppermint, the soft aroma of soap, and, beneath those, that inhumanly intense scent, the one that’s like a biblical spice, a gift of the Three Wise Men: something ancient and beautiful and exotic.
Cas hesitates, biting his lip, before he rumbles in a low voice, "Dean, about Sam...He already knows. He already
It's not even a real answer, but he smiles anyway, and I feel that familiar mix of hollowness and Something Else stirring deep in my gut. The ache. The yearning. The thing I always thought I was too tough for. The thing that swells up in the core of my being, and makes other parts of me contemplate following suit.
But Cas smiles and shakes his head, squeezing his ass cheek before releasing it, and releasing the front of Dean's shirt to lay both hands firmly on his chest. "I had other ideas."
I close my eyes and let myself collapse into a ball on the bed, burying my face into the pillow. "Well that was humiliating," I mutter, muffled by the pillowcase.
As the “…” hangs heavy in the air between them, a specific kind of heat unfurls soft tendrils in his stomach, reaching out to different parts of his body. He feels his heartbeat accelerating as one tendril wraps around his heart, squeezing a little; a couple more uncurling in his loins, reaching out to his cock and balls and stroking.
I sense that he needs reassurance, so I start with that. "I would like that, Dean. Very much." I let my fingers trail down his sides to rest on the subtle curve of his waist, then slide them backwards, applying gentle pressure to the hard knots of muscle either side of his spine with my fingertips. "However, we still need to talk about what happened."
Dean shudders involuntarily. Cas' stubble is rough against his cheek, and he turns his head away to avoid the sensation, because it's
for help, when Dean would have dropped his apple-pie life, the one he signed up for for Sammy's sake, in a hot minute if Cas had asked him to
Whatever love language I'm speaking, he understands it; his teeth graze my thumb pad, and his eyes close as his tongue folds around my finger; a slight hollowing of the cheeks as he sucks me in for one long, warm, wet moment. Then it's over, but his blue eyes are fixed on mine again.
This time, he stands right at the edge of the pier, side-on from me, looking into the water. His profile is gilded by the late afternoon sun, and I don't know if I want to cry or kill myself at the thought of losing him. Of him loving someone else.
The air is filled with the sound of their laboured breathing. It's so erotically charged in their little bubble of existence that the very air between them seems to shiver with the tension. Cas reaches down to stroke himself, his eyelashes fluttering, deliberately provocative, and Dean practically salivates at the sight. Big, well-formed hands around that big, well-formed--
"I didn't say that." I don't expect to hear myself interrupt him. But it's true. I didn't say that. I wouldn't. I might be a coward, but Cas is...well, it's Cas.
Cas hums. It's like a song in a single note. I’m annoyed by the fact that I can’t stop myself from finding it soothing.
His hand moves up to my face, cupping my cheek; rising up to stroke my hair. There is so much gentleness in everything he does--every touch; every word he says to me.
There's a definite dampness to his eyes as he says that. He looks at the ceiling to stop anything escaping, huffing a rueful laugh to keep his emotions at bay.
He wants to feel safe, and I have learned that for Dean, safety often simply means clear directions. My stomach and abdomen are tight with excitement, excitement which pools as a heavy weight in my balls, but I rein in my enthusiasm enough to speak sternly and firmly.
He's propped on his elbow, and I turn my head to look at him, met with eyes that are just...so blue they practically glow.
I roll all the way onto my back to stare at him, trying to ignore the way that Cas' hand ends up very close to my crotch as a result. "What do you mean, he
because we 'matter too much' to you, and then just...Jesus, Cas. You matter to me, too, okay? A lot. I--"
Of course, as soon as he does, he feels Cas’ eyes slide back to him, and a renewed prickling sensation rises from his tailbone to the base of his skull.
Cas leans forward. "I noticed," he murmurs conspiratorially into Dean's ear, "that there are hooks on the wall."
Gone, and gone for good, into a void where Dean can't follow. Purgatory is one thing. Dean has been to hell, and he's been to Purgatory. There are doors into those, and he can find them. By god, he'd find them. But the Empty? That's angel-exclusive. Dean has no ticket to that ride.
I reach for his face with both hands, and draw him into a shallow kiss. His stubble is rough against my fingers. He is warm; he is real. He is here. The hollow in my stomach is filling, slowly but steadily, with heat, and longing. I can feel him, too--the way he's got me pulled close and the way he's pushed himself forward has our cocks resting together, nudging each other in a lazy, familiar, early-morning conversation.
I hear myself groaning again at the way his skin pulls against mine, and I have to admit that he might be right, because that was
He wipes his palms along the legs of his jeans. I am told that humans sweat through their palms when nervous. Is that what is happening here?
"Enough, I think," I murmur. I am pulsing in his hand, and I do not want this to be over before it even starts. "Come here, Dean."
The result is two equally stunned Winchesters, and Dean, master of subtlety, yanking his hand back so violently he almost falls off the bed.
Yep, it'll be good to be alone in the woods. I can eat and drink and sit on the pier pretending to fish. I can have my own Walden.
It goes in easy. My body just...opens up to him. I'm a wet, well-lubed, needy mess, and I want that eternal wave of unrelenting pleasure back. Pronto.
The old pot-bellied stove is something I found in a junkyard in the nearest town. It's old: the kind of thing rich people would probably spend a bucketload on if someone took the time to put in a little bit of elbow grease and slapped on a several-hundred dollar price tag. Not that hard to fix up, either, but I guess most people don't bother.
His palms cup my cheeks, and he presses gentle lips against mine, and it feels like every atom in me starts to...to
He mumbles something incomprehensible again, and turns towards me, nuzzling close against my neck. At the same time, I feel his hand slide over my leg and onto my inner thigh, his fingers tightening restlessly.
I feel the subtle changes in his body. His muscles are tightening; the tendons in his neck and shoulders straining against his skin. His balls are swollen, and his fingers grip me so tight I think I might bruise. Not that I care--my cock is leaping through my tight grip now; my breath coming in shorter, heavier pants; I'm starting to feel dizzy. I'm not holding Cas against the couch anymore--I'm just clinging to him, dropping my forehead onto his shoulder and moaning and saying his name, over and over until--
Sometimes, it is more one-sided than others. Sometimes, he will not allow me to pleasure him, and wants only to give; other times, he
I feel my lip curl with annoyance as I turn to look up at him. "Who's we?" I ask, even though it's completely unnecessary.
him do this. He kisses his way along Cas' jawline; back down his neck; along his collarbone. Cas has his hands on the back of Dean's head, and guides him gently to his chest, which Dean bites; his nipples, which Dean sucks on and scrapes his teeth over, all the while pushing in and pulling out. The couch legs scuff loudly with each slow, forceful movement, and Cas' voice is beginning to develop that strained edge to it, cracking on the single repeated syllable of Dean's name. He can hear himself grunting and panting, too; louder than he'd like to be, but he can't seem to turn down the volume. His muscles are constricting; his glutes and core aching with his efforts, and with his grim determination to hold back his climax as long as he can. He wants desperately to speed up and to spill over and fill Cas' insides, but he holds back until he can feel the gooseflesh on Cas' skin and the waves of internal pleasure rippling through his body.
"Don't you dare," he interrupts, his voice tight and angry as his eyes snap back to mine. "Don't you dare keep just...just
clothes. It's not quite the same level of 'this belongs to...' as Cas etching his name into Dean's soul, but it'll do.
Since I'm in the area, I decide to reward myself with a few nights in a safehouse down by a lake I know. I stock up on beer and bacon and eggs and all the other stuff Sam would judge me for eating if he was here.
He watches me contemplatively for a minute or two, massaging as I throb against his hand, experimenting with pace and pressure. Then, he closes his eyes--scanning again, I realise; my comprehension is just a little delayed because of the languorous way his fingers twist.
Cas picks up the pace. He doesn't sweat (not, in his own words, ‘under any circumstances’), but his brow is furrowed with effort. Occasionally, he glances up at me, his eyes like bullets of blue under thick dark eyelashes; but they are mostly closed as the tension builds between us, his lips parted like he's lost in prayer.
They stay like that until Dean softens a little more, at which point he draws back enough to say sleepily, "Bath?"
Nope, still can't say it. Can't say any of it. I hope you're listening, Cas. I hope you can hear me. I hope you know. I hope I get my shit together enough to be able to say it to you out loud, one day, but today is not that day.
He presses his lips to my forehead first, and then my temple, and only after that my lips. The minute he does, he's gently tightening his fingers, and the pressure's got me bucking up into his grip, groaning into his mouth. I can feel him smiling against me; feel the warmth of his low chuckle as he draws back, but not for long, because I lift my head, chasing more of the buzz I get from his lips on mine; the rough sensation of his scruffy chin against my skin. He tastes like mint, or honey, or both. I'm a mess. I'm straight-up gonna cum in my pants in less than half a minute if he keeps doing whatever he's doing, so I grab him by the wrist, muttering, "No--no no no. No."
Cas' lips curve into a smile at the words. "Well, then," he murmurs, passing his thumb over the red tip of his own cock and sighing, "get the lubricant, Dean."
I sigh. I would like to be able to be ready for how he will respond, but he is too unpredictable. I can't even imagine what he will do. I just know that anything is better than this uncertainty. It is too much, and has gone on for too long. It is too tiring to just go on trying to veil how I feel for him, and the longer I leave it, the less likely it becomes that I will ever tell him.
But his pathetic human body is too small to contain the depth and breadth of his grief. It spills over slowly at first, the hot tears burning his cheeks as he raises his hands to his face. After that, his lungs, desperate to breathe, force him to let out the breath he's clinging to. It's the breath that holds the last vestiges of Cas left on the planet. It's squeezed out of his lungs like the last bit of toothpaste from a squashed-up, used-up toothpaste tube. Comes out like a physical object, choking him until it breaks from his lips in a twisted, animal whine.
He's compliant: he stops, looking down on me nervously, a frown furrowing his brow. "What is it, Dean? Did I do something wrong?"
, you know. Touch me. But he's all eyes, no hands; at least, that's how he is with me. He's always looking at me, looking out for me, watching over me, and I don't understand
The second time, the time after Cas betrayed them to try and become a 'new and improved' God, using the souls from Purgatory...Well, that time was messed up. When it happened, Dean was angry and confused. But because of the
He looks embarrassed, all the same. The poor man struggles with friendship and intimacy almost as much as we angels do.
privilege," I tell him, which is true, and he goes silent, and very, very red, his mouth hanging open.
I feel like I might throw up. That twister in my stomach is sending shrapnel and debris all over the goddamn place. "Matter? Sure, maybe. But...but that
"I was looking for this," he says, "after you left. I thought it might help me understand why you just...You took it from Sam's room, right? And took it to the job with you."
Dean lets his arms fall around Cas' neck, and lets their foreheads rest together again. For a few minutes there is nothing else in the world except for the two of them: nothing except warmth and satiation and the wet, hot messes between them. And, in Dean's case, inside him. Which is nice and all, but...
He swallows, and I realise for the first time that he might be just as nervous as I am. "Yes. I said wanted to kiss you."
what I want. He's giving me Dean-speak versions of 'I care for you' and 'I want the best for you', and I feel...I feel overjoyed. I have always tried to show him that I care, but I never had the sense to
"Oh. Apologies." He loosens his grip and, after a moment’s contemplation, gently withdraws his hand.
I'm casting a line into the lake when I accidentally summon him. I don't know how. Okay, fine, that's a lie. I was looking at the lake and the sky and it made me think of his dumbass big blue eyes and I must have thought his name too hard or felt too many feelings in his direction or some shit. Whatever I did, it was enough for him to get a line on me, because all of a sudden I can feel him there at my side. I know he's there because suddenly I feel...I don't know. Safe.
He feels that steady, seemingly-human heartbeat under Cas' ribcage--feels how solid he is; how real. And suddenly, with a sudden rising wave of panic, he thinks he sees black nothingness creeping in on the edges of this perfection.
' may have always been a euphemism. The soundtrack of yeehaws or gunfire in the background was protection against his inherited fear that it is wrong to spend time alone with another man. With a movie on, being alone together was forgivable, and he could pretend to both of us that his gradual slump from the back of the couch onto my shoulder was insignificant. Harmless. He was just resting. Just the pure, innocent, coincidental result of exhaustion. I was just his pillow substitute.
After a quick glance at the door to be sure it's locked, Dean accepts the invitation. He clambers awkwardly and carefully into the space left on the seat between Cas' legs. The couch isn't really built for two large men, and protests under their weight, but neither of them really properly notice.
He has no right to be standing there looking at Dean with such innocence and affection at the same time as
I pull out of the kiss to catch my breath, but I do not move my face. I breath in his every exhale; we are still so close our lips almost touch. I reach unseeingly for the lube, and crack it open one-handedly, slipping my other arm between our bodies to squirt copious amounts of the stuff onto my fingers. Dean obediently rises up onto his knees as I reach back around his body. My fingers slide wetly over the inner edge of one ass cheek, and I begin with a few long, slippery strokes, downwards and inwards, until I gently locate that tight ring of muscle, and begin to draw soft, coaxing circles around it with my fingertips.
Dean presses his own sweating forehead against Cas', which is smooth and dry. Lets the tips of their noses touch. Pushes his hand down between their stomachs and takes hold of Cas' throbbing erection, and
If it was anyone else turning him on, he would have been able to crack a joke and kill the mood, but it’s been a long time since anyone else has been able to turn him on--like,
read it. And if this is all Sam's stupid book's fault, then to understand what the hell is going on, I'll have to read it. I need to know what kinds of screwy ideas he's put in Cas' head.
I lean down, pressing my lips to his throat and letting him use my weight on his body as a lever point, so that he can get the angle just right. His fingers dig roughly into my back, and I feel him bracing his feet against the mattress, knees up as he slides in and out of my fist.
But after sitting here with my arms crossed for five minutes, I retrieve the book and try to uncrumple the pages. I've gone to the effort to steal it, so I might as well look at it. And according to the cover, it's a
The tip of my dick is crimson, and the lust is starting to make me feel lightheaded, but Cas is just blue eyes and elegant fingers--
"Shh, Dean. Go back to sleep," I say, as I place his hand gently back on his own lap, but he is stirring now. He makes another incoherent grumbly sound, but it definitely is not a sound of agreement. With a muffled yawn, he's looking up at me, questioningly, his gaze slightly unfocused. His vulnerability in this moment makes my heart ache.
"It was in your car, Dean," Cas adds, and his tone is weird. I can't tell what he's getting at--what does he mean? He sounds kind of judgy, but also...amused? Accusing?
isn't. In fact, none of us is in any kind of relationship at the moment, so I don't see how a book about fixing failing marriages is relevant to any of us at all.
I rest my palm on his thigh, just above the knee. The coarse hair under my hand is unfamiliar. I'm used to women's shaved legs; may a bit of prickle from regrowth or something. But Cas is just straight-up fuzzy. It's weird. Not unpleasant, but weird.
starts to give in; to move faster; to let his breathing become little more than choked, desperate gasps as he rolls his hips against Cas' ass, balls slapping against his skin; to pull and rub and twist his cock in a way that has Cas wide-eyed and shaking, but never looking away, until they do come together, collapsing into each other in a quaking, messy heap of limbs, their torsos sandwiching a slick of Dean's sweat and Cas' cum.
He pulls his hand away from his mouth and draws himself up to full height. Perhaps the fight response is kicking in.
Being near him...lets me hate myself less. Makes me hate myself less. The first time we ever met, I stabbed him in the chest. I put a literal knife in his heart, and he just...forgave me. Laughed at me. Smiled at me. Spoke my name.
I expect him to pull it away, but, surprisingly, he doesn't. He actually looks down at where my hand rests on his, and then turns his own palm up, interlacing his fingers with mine.
I have practised reading his body language, enough to know that there is a difference, albeit minute, between the way he hunches because he is annoyed, and the way he hunches because he feels nervous and uncomfortable.
After a moment's hesitation, Dean complies. His shirt hits the floor, and moments later his jeans and shorts follow.
My throat has gone dry. I swallow to try and wet it, but it's just noisy, not helpful. My voice is still raspy when I ask, "Are they gone yet?"
I rest my face in the crook of his neck, heaving in the smell of his skin, as well as the less-familiar smells of guy sex. The fact that they're unfamiliar smells doesn't seem to bother my cock, which is jabbing urgently against Cas' hip: I reach down to adjust it, with a muffled apology, but Cas just reaches for my hand, and replaces it back on his own, coaxing my fingers under the elastic of his waistband to cup his balls. Which I actually...I don't mind. They're soft, and still a little heavy, and my stomach does this weird flippy thing as I sort of remember exactly what I've got in my hand.
I feel like a tree accosted by a giant koala. He wraps his arms around my neck, leaning in to plant slow, lazy kisses on my lips. He is like this more often, lately, whilst waking up: relaxed, and at ease. It is a playful, gentle side to him that I do not think he has had many opportunities to express, but I feel that perhaps it is closer to his true nature than the macho projection he puts out into the world, and I am grateful that he trusts me enough to let me see it.
So the loss comes out as anger. And when he can no longer contain it, it comes out as splitting his knuckles open against any available surface. When he finally gets him back, the pang in his chest tells him that maybe, just maybe, there was something beneath his anger; something infinitely more terrifying; something he doesn't have the words for. Something that doesn't just hurt, but burns, like coals glowing in the ash. And having Cas back...well, that's a cool breath; a poker stoking the coals back into a small but tenacious blaze that won't go out; it won't give up. Dean has never known a feeling quite like it before.
, and then there he is, cuffed and bound and indecently exposed, attached to a wall hook with his own belt buckle, the brickwork rough on his back and Cas close to him, but not close enough.
After a moment, the bedsprings creak as Cas joins me on the bed. He lies behind me; chest against my upper back, arm along the side of my torso, and hand on my hip. It's like the way I fell asleep against him the other night. I don't know why, but I feel like there's something kind of
I'm already reaching for his cock. I don't have enough blood going to my brain to even work my own hands--I'm too slow; too clumsy, but Cas takes over, pressing the pulsing head of his cock against me, both of us groaning as he slides in. I grab for him, one hand around the back of his neck, and the other arm wrapped around his shoulders. Braced against him like this,  I can draw him deeper inside me, sliding down his hot shaft, feeling every bulging vein pushing at the surface of his dick; every coarse curl of downstairs fuzz. He's reaching under me, trying to pull me closer, and I lift my weight to let his strong arms slip under my body.
He steps forward and runs a finger along Dean's collarbone. Lets the finger be joined by its friends, and trace its lazy way down to his left nipple, and then lower...dropping, dropping, to pause on his hip.
"I don't know if I'm ready, Cas. I'm not...I'm not a very good option. You probably ought to shop around a bit more before you hitch yourself to this wagon."
I lift my legs to hook my feet behind him. I can't get close enough--never close enough to him. But I can use my legs to drag him deeper still, and it frees my hands so I can reach down between us and take hold of my cock, tipping my head back and letting him make his way down my throat to bite at my nipples as I tug myself into white-out bliss.
But Cas is close: Dean can feel it. He's pulsating inside him, his cock thrusting in jerky movements while he’s still trying to hold back. Dean's dick is doing the same; throbbing; shiny and red as it bounces against their stomachs. Every time it hits skin edges him closer to orgasm. But then, Cas shifts the pace, and Dean's soft grunts become more urgent, because Cas is getting him
I keep easing my way down until my hamstrings rest against his tensed thighs. I can feel his balls, hot and cushiony under my ass cheeks. I close my eyes, a little laugh escaping my lips at the thought that I've got a warrior of heaven
