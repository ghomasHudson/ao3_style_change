Tony blinked, and Steve clapped a hand over his mouth like he couldn't believe he'd just said that, his eyes suddenly wide.
like I fucking want to talk about it?” Tony snapped, rounding on Steve as the pit of anger in his gut reached its boiling point. “Just leave me the fuck alone!”
“I know it's weird, okay? But I just –“ Tony wriggled his fingers before rubbing his hands on his thighs. “I'm all – squirrelly. I don't know, can I – is it okay if we sleep here? Together?”
Now the second version of the ending of this fic is finally here and holy fucking shit do I just want to get it over and done with. I never imagined how draining it would be to write something that you’ve already written before but I don’t wish it on anyone because boy fucking howdy I wanted to rip all of my hair out. I keep thinking that the old version was so much better even though I can't remember why that is, so if by some miracle I ever recover that one, this and the last chapter may be under construction in the future.
Steve used to talk to Tony without needing a reason. “Just to see what you make of all this.” He nodded towards the rest of the room. “I don't think I'm getting a lot of productive thinking out of anyone else today. Do you think there's a way for us to reverse the spell?”
“But you love me anyway, right?” Tony's – thankfully clean – hand found his, pulling it up so Tony could press a kiss to his knuckles, and Steve smiled despite himself, interlacing their fingers as he pulled Tony over to the sink to wash up.
“Yes,” Steve said hoarsely, his fingers clenching when Tony started cranking, slowly but surely adding more pressure. It took a moment before Steve really felt it, but when he did he sucked in a breath, wishing that Tony could've cranked both of them at once, really made it tight. But all in due time.
In the spirit of open communication I want to let you know that some of the Avengers do not feel comfortable signing the Accords as they are now. As you can imagine in the light of how the former agents among our team were exploited by HYDRA through SHIELD, government oversight is a very delicate matter. Nonetheless I am sure that we can find a solution that is satisfactory for all parties involved.
Steve laughed wetly, dissolving into hitching breaths that weren't quite sobs, and Tony held him through it with his face pressed into Steve's hair. He couldn't even imagine what Steve was going through right now. Peggy was Tony's aunt but to Steve she was so much more.  His first love. The last connection to his old life, at least until Bucky made it back. And now she was – she was...
Steve nodded, grateful not to have to explain further, and Mr. Stark looked off to the side with a thoughtful frown.
in the chat, so Tony obligingly turned just enough to let the camera see it, pulling at one of the lace strings to let it smack back against his skin.
But he had fun with Tony. He could talk to him for hours about everything and nothing and sometimes, when it was dark and Tony'd had a few glasses of wine, they would talk about MIT or Brooklyn in the forties, and it felt like Steve had finally found something that connected him to this new age, a reason to keep going. He couldn't imagine losing this.
Very well. I will review the accords one more time at my own leisure. If they are approved you will be sent a signed copy by the end of the week. Thank you for your efforts.
Steve choked on the rest of his sentence when Tony bit down, sinking his teeth into the spot just below Steve's ear. He could feel Steve's veins pulsing against his mouth, and he thrust his hips in time with that rhythm, feeling his eyes roll into the back of his head at the friction combined with Steve's
good.” Steve was almost slurring his words now, and Tony grinned smugly, turning over just enough to see Steve's face. The alpha's eyes were glazed over with satisfaction, and Tony could've sworn he had his chest puffed out, shoulders back. Tony chuckled.
His breathing was a little uneven when he pulled his finger out and positioned the fleshlight over his cock. “Ready?”
“Sounds like you have a type,” Tony said teasingly and Steve's smile widened as he lifted Tony's hand and pressed a kiss to it.
watch my friends be turned into criminals, Steve,” Tony snapped and for a second it looked like Steve wanted to keep arguing but then he sighed, his shoulders sinking.
“Good.” Tony shivered when a single finger slid along his jawline, tracing his beard until it reached the hollow of Tony's throat. “Strip.”
Tony hummed non-committally, offering her his arm as they walked out of the room. He didn't need to think about. No matter how he spun it, him and Steve being together was a horrible idea. And not just because of their dynamics.
“I can do that anywhere, anytime,” Tony called out as Steve grabbed hold of his arm and started dragging him out of the room. “Try and stop me, motherfucker!”
“Is that better?” Tony asked through gritted teeth, and Steve tried to sell it, tried to thrust up into Tony's grip – but that just made Tony loose focus, his grip going slack, and Steve bit his lip to keep from making a forlorn noise. Tony was breathing hard from exertion already, and even if Steve could've gotten off with the pressure Tony could give him, he knew that Tony didn't have the arm strength to keep it up long enough to get him off. It was hopeless.
Hello everyone! I’m back after a long ass time to give you the next chapter of this fic. I’ll explain a bit more about my absence in the end notes but first I hope you enjoy this chapter and I’ll see you tomorrow for the grand finale! :)
“I never asked. And it's not like –“ Tony heard the implications a second later, whipping around to glare right at Steve's innocent face. “No.”
Tony shook his head, his eyes wide as his hands clenched into fists. “No, this is the spell talking. You can't possibly think that –“
He hadn’t been hard when Steve started but he was getting there, the tingles of oversensitivity slowly turning into pleasure. It would probably take a while before he could come again, but luckily he knew Steve didn’t mind it one bit.
Mr. Stark stared at him with something like disbelief that quickly turned into suspicion. “Like… a date?”
Tony was quietly grateful that he wasn't required to sit up on the sphere. He wasn't one of those omegas who were incredibly receptive to sexual stimulus – much to his disappointment – but the right kind of pressure on his prostate
“I find that hard to believe,” Tony said with a slightly teasing smirk. “I'm sure you have some good stories. I have a sixth sense for that sort of thing.”
Tony braced himself on Steve's thighs as he shoved his hips down, his back arching when Steve's knot popped inside him, stretching him wide until he thought he would
“Do you pinch them? Twist them? What do you do?” There was still none of the disgust Steve had expected in Tony's voice, so he gathered his courage and met his eyes.
Steve looked at him and Tony’s heart thumped at the raw emotion there. “It doesn’t feel real, does it?”
agitated,” Tony said quickly, closing his eyes as he concentrated on the vibrations against his cock, his jaw going slack with the pleasure-pain. “Oh god.”
As for Dr. Banner's resignation, the UN sends their sincere regrets and trusts that the Avengers and SHIELD will ensure Dr. Banner's safety. In the event that the Hulk is sighted off Avengers grounds or becomes involved in Avengers business without prior notice and UN approval Dr. Banner will be prosecuted.
Steve froze when he heard the distant screeching of an oncoming car, long before the announcer's voice rang out. His heart was pounding hard enough that he could feel it pulsing in his wrists.
“Mr Stark!” Someone immediately shouted and Tony nodded at the lady to continue. “What are your feelings on the first day of the trial?”
Toni had no idea what her face looked like right now. She felt like she was on fire. “This is insane. Do you even know what the press will say about you? And me? Or how it might affect your –“
“No, it's – Tony!” Her mouth clacked shut when he grabbed her arm, keeping her from backing away even further. Which – when did that happen? “It's not just about sex. I – I really like you.” Toni's eyes widened when Steve's cheeks flushed – honest to god
“You sure?” he asked, his voice coming out a little strangled, and Steve pulled him into a firm kiss instead of an answer, holding the tray steady as he urged Tony into a rhythm with the hand still grabbing his ass. Alright then.
Tony shrugged. “I've done it a couple of times. But it's not like I need it or anything, it's just – yeah.”
Tony moaned, something deep inside him lighting up with pleasure when Steve pressed two fingers inside him, the same way he did the night before except –
“Well, if I tinker with it a bit I'm sure I can figure something out.” He smirked. “Lots of strength in that suit. I bet I can make you come like that.”
.” He trailed off into a strangled moan when Steve rubbed a circle into his sore ass, a stinging pain that made his skin prickle with oversensitivity.
Steve arrived at breakfast a little early the next morning and was surprised to see most of his fellow Avengers already sitting at the table. There was a free spot next to Bruce, and Steve debated whether or not he should run the risk of another awkward interaction before he changed course and sat in between Sam and Bucky, ignoring the holes Sam's eyes were burning into the side of his face.
“Great.” Steve's voice sounded a little strangled, but before Tony could ask what that was about Steve cleared his throat. “So how's that project coming along? The energy whatchamacallit?”
But Steve stayed perfectly calm the whole evening, prodding her to tell him story after story and sharing his own in return, and before long Toni forgot all about the circumstances of them being here and simply enjoyed herself. She nudged his leg with hers, sliding the toe of her stiletto up the inseam of his pants, and grinned when his hand tightened around his fork hard enough that he bent the metal. He stammered an apology to the waitress later while Toni waited by the door and discreetly slipped the valet an extra fifty.
Tony smiled, grabbing Steve’s hand to run his thumb over his knuckles. “Don’t worry. I know just how to fix that.”
Steve sat down heavily, finally letting the exhaustion of the fight catch up to him as he sorted through everyone's reports, trying to get them into some semblance of order. He was stalling and he knew it, his heart pounding at just the thought of Tony confronting him. Tony hadn't been at the debrief, instead helping SHIELD with clean up, and Steve hated taking the coward's way out, but if he was luckily he could probably get back to his room before Tony –
Steve reached for the ones on the counter behind him, but by the time he grabbed them the carton gave and Tony pulled out its contents with a huge grin.
“It would exempt him from the ritual, yes.” Ignacio didn't sound very happy about it. “But since he is not, I'm afraid we can't let you just –“
Steve closed his eyes, hoping that sleep would take him quickly and give him a break from his thoughts. But after a couple more minutes of tossing and turning he sighed in defeat, rolling over onto his back. It was no use, he was way too jittery to fall asleep.
“I have no problem with yielding to someone else's leadership,” Steve said carefully, looking down at his hands. “But only when I'm sure that they'll work in the world's best interest. The last time I put my trust into an organization like this they turned out to be HYDRA.”
“Nobody knows you came here, right?” Tony asked and Lang nodded. “Just go home then. I'll pay for the flight. Nat?”
Steve's eyes squeezed shut as his whole body twitched, and Tony looked down at where Steve's massive cock was tenting his boxers, straining so hard against the fabric that it looked like it was going to rip right through it.
Steve looked at him for a long moment, searching his face, and whatever he found must've been satisfactory, because the tension melted out of him as his lips twisted up into an uncertain smile.
“Yeah, yeah, okay.” Steve gasped when Tony grabbed him tight, tight enough to feel it, and started thrusting. Hard. So hard that it was pushing Steve into the tube before pulling him back, and for a panicked second Steve thought he was going to come right away – “Steve? Are you –”
“Like this,” Tony said, tugging Steve back down on top of him. “You don't have to move. I just want to feel you.”
It feels almost nostalgic to come back to THIS texting format now xD Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it!
He hummed as he worked, cupping water with his hands to clean off his soapy arms and legs before he moved back towards the waterfall to rinse out his hair –
“You feel so good,” Tony mumbled right in his ear, smirking at the shudder that went through Steve as he started fucking their hands in earnest. “Can’t wait to feel you come.”
“You feel incredible,” Steve breathed against him, and Tony wanted to arch into him, but quickly found that he couldn't, completely pinned down by Steve's weight. The realization that he couldn't move, didn't
,” he said, so quietly that Steve wasn't sure if he was even supposed to hear it, and Steve smiled, snuggling closer. He'd do anything in his power to make Tony as happy as he made him.
“No, you can.” Clint pulled out his phone, tapping around for a couple of seconds before he handed it to Tony. “There's all kinds of aids. You're not the first gay male omega, you know?”
She took him to her private lodge upstate, which was out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just the way she liked it. Honestly the 'lodge' was just a glorified hollywood swing on some private property, but nothing could beat the view, watching the big city lights twinkling like they were competing with the stars.
It felt dull. Steve had known that he needed more pressure there than anywhere else, but he'd never thought that – even with all of Tony's strength... oh God, this was a nightmare.
“He's the temperamental sort, isn't he?” Dr. Yinsen asked, and Tony snorted before he could keep himself in check. Luckily the doctor didn't comment on his outburst beyond a polite smile as he sat down in the chair opposite Tony's, picking up a small notebook and a pen. “So, Tony. Why don't you tell me about your day?”
He gasped, fucking into Steve's fist once, twice, thrice more before he tumbled over the edge, dragging his dick back and forth as Steve's hand milked his orgasm from him with hard strokes and an uneven rhythm. Tiny shocks of pleasure tingled up and down his spine as his cock throbbed with every pulse, pumping his come right into the pie – or what was left of it anyway. It looked more like a kindergarten art project than anything actually edible now.
, even under these less than ideal circumstances, made Steve's chest thrum with warmth. God, he wanted there to be a
It was weird. Usually Tony had a much better handle on this part of the whole thing, where he was supposed to thank his client for a good time and send them on their way. But with Steve... it just didn't feel right to end it without even –
Steve rubbed his fingers together, bringing them to his mouth to lick them a few times and get them more thoroughly wet. Toni's thighs twitched with anticipation. She had so many plans for that tongue.
He looked up at Steve who was staring at him with wide eyes, his hand still wrapped around Tony's cock. Tony flushed.
In light of recent events the UN has decided to deploy the Avengers to retrieve the accused James Buchanan Barnes along with the missing persons Steven Grant Rogers, Samuel Thomas Wilson, Wanda Maximoff and Clinton Francis Barton within the next 72 hours.
“You think five years is a long time?” Tony gave him a wry smile. “Try seven and a half. How pathetic are we, huh?”
“Gonna be,” he sighed and Tony frowned at the phrasing, the question dying on his tongue when Steve started licking at his bonding gland before he sucked the skin into his mouth. Tony jerked, suddenly reminded of his still hard cock as Steve worried at the swollen gland with his teeth.
“No, it –“ Tony's mouth dropped open, his eyes wide as he stared unseeingly at the table underneath him, his hips jerking against the sphere on reflex. It was moving quickly, in a repetitive motion, and Tony had never felt anything like it. He'd never been this aware of his penis before, which was a weird thought because of course he hadn't, an omega's penis didn't exist for any purpose other than making water.
“Pretty good, huh?” Tony asked smugly and Steve watched as he stuck a finger in the fleshlight, jumping when he felt the tube distend in his grip. Holy shit. “Bye bye, boring business trips. We can switch it up if you want, I’ll take the tube this time and next time I’ll –“
The live button in the corner flicked from red to gray, and Tony lowered his arms, blowing a raspberry. “Holy shit. I can't believe we hit our goal.”
Steve felt like he was melting. Like he was going to float away on the almost painful pleasure swirling in his stomach. His cock was throbbing so hard he could feel it in his ears, his balls tingling where they were drawn up tight against his body. He couldn't stop sobbing, his mouth open and chest hitching as he pushed back on Tony's cock because oh, god, despite the need coursing through him it still felt so
Steve could feel sweat beading on the back of his neck by the time they reached the next station. The doors closed as quickly as they'd opened, nobody going in or out, and Steve breathed a sigh of relief because the next stop would be –
Steve blinked his eyes open and saw dark curls twisting around an ear above the edges of a bearded jawline. He recoiled, realizing all at once that he’d somehow cuddled up to the doll in his sleep, one leg flung over its hip and both arms wrapped firmly around its chest. Steve flushed with abject horror, about to pull away and try to ignore what happened –
Steve's breathing caught, and Tony realized with a start that he could feel Steve's chest hitching against his back, almost as if – oh fuck.
Steve shook his head even as he looked over at the open doorway to his bedroom. He couldn’t see the doll from here but just knowing it was there made entering the room feel almost daunting. “Where do you even dispose of a sex doll?”
The first few seconds were agony, but the burning need inside him overshadowed any discomfort as he kept squirming against the sphere, trying to find the best angle to –
“I do.” Tony smiled, framing Steve’s face with his hands. “You’ve rutted in the field before, remember? You didn’t hurt me then.”
a good idea,” Tony shouted, his fingers already itching as he kneaded the blanket, nervous energy buzzing under his skin. “Holy fuck, why didn't I think of that?”
“Yes.” Tony spread his legs even wider now that they were free and Steve swore something fierce as he ripped his own pants to shreds, finally –
“Okay,” Tony mumbled into the table, too tired to even lift his head. It took longer than he'd expected for him to find the strength to sit up, and when he did he did it slowly, shuffling up onto his knees with a groan. He was still shaking, swaying a little on the table, and Steve came over to steady him with a hand on his arm, giving him a warm smile.
“Okay, so,” Tony said after Steve's breathing had finally evened out to normal. “You can totally say no, but do you want to talk about this a little more? So I can get a feeling for what you need?”
I didn't know I missed writing Pepper but now that I have, I kind of missed her. Just in time for Homecoming ;) Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this one!
That was a relief. Steve read through the form before he signed it, sliding it back over to Ms. Potts who tucked it into a folder.
“Hot damn.” Tony licked his lips. “Just saying, cause I'd've been cool with you not wanting this, but I am
Steve's hand was playing with his hair now, and Natasha took one look at them before she rolled her eyes with a sigh.
“Yeah,” Tony said, turning over to his head down on Steve's chest so he could listen to his heartbeat as it slowly sunk in that this was really happening. “Yeah. I guess I will.”
Tony gave him a long look before he shook his head and walked out of the room, his nose once again buried in his phone. Steve watched him go, trying to push down the faint disappointment that tried to rise up in his chest, coupled with a fierce longing. He was very familiar with the sensation.
"I am." Steve sounded like he couldn't quite believe it either and Tony's eyes travelled down, hands coming up to touch his chin.
“Do you want me to help?” Steve asked, and Tony took a shaky breath, head jerking up and down in a nod. “I need to hear you say it, sweetheart.”
Tony hummed. “Not really.” Ah, fuck it. “Post the blowie if you think it'll help. I trust your judgment.”
“Alone?” Obie looked him up and down, eyes narrowing in challenge, but Dr. Yinsen didn't even flinch, his soothing beta scent never fluctuating.
“Is he?” T'Challa raised an eyebrow. “Even if he was framed in Vienna, like you insinuated, Mr Barnes is far from an innocent man. Tell me, how many people has he killed?”
“Left,” Tony gasped against Steve's mouth, and Steve pushed through the door that Tony pointed him to, kicking it shut behind him as he walked over to the bed and dropped his precious cargo on the sheets. Tony laughed when he bounced on the mattress before Steve was on him, fitting their mouths back together as he fiddled with the buttons of Tony's shirt.
Please understand that we are acting in the best interest of our organization and the protection of its employees. Feel free to take up your request with the United Nations for further debate. They should be happy to address your concerns.
They did, watching as the concierge pulled out a card and swiped it through the lock, holding his thumb up to the side of it. The light went green, and he opened the door, waving them through with a proper bow this time.
Since Afghanistan has signed the Sokovia Accords the unauthorized deployment of said aircraft will be dealt with in accordance with section 4, article 12, §8 and result in a warning. The UN wants to once again remind you that any and all mission-related transport must be registered at least four hours before take off, no exceptions.
“Alright, I have a plan,” Tony said as soon as they entered the workshop, still dragging Steve along by the hand until they reached Tony's desk, where Tony immediately started typing out equations on a holo screen. Steve watched him, a smile quirking the corners of his mouth as it always did when he saw Tony in his element.
Tony followed him all the way back to the front desk where Obie was already waiting, tapping his foot.
, hot flashes running up and down his spine as he trembled on the table, trying to keep a grip on reality.
Tony remembered their signal – one tap for no, two taps for yes, and he barely hesitated before he slapped the wooden part of the couch twice, sitting up a little straighter.
Steve jerked, his thighs trembling when Tony kept rubbing over that spot, his mouth dropping open on a groan. “Oh,
“Still handsome though,” Tony said, sounding entirely too cheerful for Steve's tastes. “You can't see it, but it's true.”
Mostly because after Tony got turned into a vampire in Afghanistan he'd avoided anything even remotely related to the topic like a plague. By the time curiosity took over it had taken a backseat to being Iron Man. And after flying a nuke into space it just didn't seem like such a big deal anymore.
Steve was vaguely aware that he was thrusting up into Tony's touch, his cock throbbing for more friction, more pressure,
“That's what I said.” Tony's voice was right on the edge of a hysterical laugh, and Steve grinned at him, so carefree and
"Hey," Tony said gently and Steve sucked in a breath, putting a hand over his eyes when he felt them prickle tellingly. “Are you alright?”
Steve seemed to ponder that for a moment before he shook his head, his face smoothing out with relief. “Wow. That went a lot better than I expected.”
Just a short chapter today. After this we're really getting back into the Civil War plot, so strap in, it's gonna be a wild ride ;)
He was distantly aware of the way Steve's grip tightened as he pumped his cock back and forth in the scant inch of space that the knot allowed, but his mind was swimming too much to really track what was going on until Steve was already done, slumping down on the sheets with a groan as he pulled Tony into his arms.
The label said 'One pump', but Tony did two just to be sure, slathering the clear liquid over his bonding gland and behind his ears where Steve usually liked to sniff him. He couldn't smell anything just yet, but according to the website the product took some time to take effect since it wasn't a perfume so much as a chemical that would alter Tony's natural scent enough to hopefully fool Steve's alpha senses.
“Ye of little faith,” Tony drawled, but Steve nodded, firmly grabbing at where he assumed Tony was. He blinked when his hand only met air.
Making Steve come was second nature at this point. Tony pulled out all the stops, kissing Steve until they were both short of breath, his hand working Steve's cock with just the right pressure to make it jerk in his grip. Fuck, he loved doing this for Steve.
Steve shook his head, sitting back on the couch as he grabbed the remote. “Let’s just watch the movie, okay? It doesn’t matter.”
Tony put on a wide grin, standing up from the table and patting Steve's shoulder to prompt him to do the same. “Already have dinner plans, sorry. Maybe next time.”
“No,” Tony said firmly, grabbing Steve's hand as he gave him a stern look. “We're not doing anything you don't want to do. And if –“ Tony's eyes flashed a little with something like realization before they softened into something almost unbearably gentle. “And if you
“Betrayed by my own brother,” Tony sighed dramatically, slumping into Steve's side as soon as they got in and the door closed behind them. “You still love me though, right?”
Steve blinked, looking down to see Tony still jerking off furiously, reaching back with his other hand to prod at his hole, and Steve’s throat went abruptly dry.
Steve found Bucky in a restaurant on the outskirts of the main city, eating porridge the same way he did every morning. It was nice to know that he'd actually settled into a new routine here. And that Steve could still predict his actions like he used to.
, sitting right in front of him, so close that Steve would only need to lean forward and he'd be able to touch him.
Steve wanted to make it last a little longer, but he could already feel his balls drawing up, his thighs shaking with every thrust, so he grabbed Tony's ass tighter, spreading him even further so he could watch his hole contract and expand around the tube.
He pushed Steve back into the mattress, a shock of lust trailing down his spine at the noise Steve made when he ground their cocks together, leaning down to touch his lips to Steve's neck. The warmth of Steve's skin paled in comparison to the heat of the blood pumping right underneath, making Tony's head spin with the knowledge that in a few seconds he would be able to
Steve made a muffled choking noise as Ignacio tilted his head. “And yet you have not claimed him as yours? Why is that?”
Tony's smile faltered a little at the fake name although he didn't know why it felt so jarring at that moment.
Tony threw his head back with a keen, thrusting up into that feeling without conscious thought, and Steve just
“We can still do that,” Tony said, frowning when Steve shook his head. “No one is trying to tear the team apart, Steve.”
Tony took a deep breath, laying his hands flat on his thighs. “For your information, no, I do not enjoy those outings, yes, I will continue to go to them for Obie's sake, and no, I don't plan on bonding with any of the alphas there. Does that answer your questions?”
“I'm okay,” he said a little breathlessly, and Steve looked at him for a moment longer before he nodded and took a step back.
“I can't believe I'm here,” he mumbled and Tony just had to pull him into a kiss, tangling their legs until they were pressed chest to chest, each breath bringing them closer together.
, so comforting… It was probably ridiculous, but even though Steve had been the one away Tony felt like he was finally coming home.
Steve couldn’t have held back if he tried, hips kicking forward into the fleshlight as he watched Tony’s ass contract and release in time with his thrusts, his gasps hitching on moans that didn’t quite make it past his lips. Tony didn’t have the same restraint, letting out a full-chested groan when Steve picked up the speed and pounded into the toy as hard as he dared without hurting Tony. It felt almost criminally good and Steve could already feel that familiar tension in his gut, winding tighter and tighter with every push of his cock through the slick silicone –
Tony had no idea how he got this lucky, but he was way too selfish not to hold on with white knuckles and try his best to earn it.
“I love you.” Tony’s heart did a little flip at the kiss Steve pressed to his nape. “Alright. Who else did you build a suit for?”
Steve looked at him wordlessly for a long moment before he took a step back, leaning against the bar with crossed arms. Tony nodded to himself, picking up the bottle again –
He grumbled under his breath, turning onto his side as he pulled at the blanket, trying to drag it back up from where it had obviously slipped throughout the night –
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “Isn't that obvious?” Steve looked at him silently until Bucky rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair. “Alright, let me ask you this. If you had been made into a weapon that can be fired at will, without your input and sometimes even without your knowledge, and someone offered you a spot on a team of people you actually care about. Wouldn't you want someone to keep you in check? To protect them from what you know you can become?”
Steve nodded, looking down at her pussy like he was preparing for a mission before he leaned forward and placed his tongue right where Toni had pointed him, fitting his mouth around her. Toni took a shaky breath, closing her eyes for a moment just to feel the warmth of Steve's tongue, the puffs of hot air as he breathed against her. His finger was still moving inside her, and combined with the warm pressure of his mouth she could feel that restless tension building in her stomach, making her itch for more.
"Yeah, you're staying." Tony hid a smile against Steve's neck. "We're gonna be okay. And if you're real good they might even let you back on the team."
“Thank fuck,” Clint groaned, popping his neck as he stretched, folding himself out of the chair. “I need a shower or three.”
Still, Steve looked nothing short of awed when he touched them, gently, like he was afraid of hurting her. Toni grabbed his hands and made him squeeze down a little harder, showing him how she liked it, and he gasped, biting his bottom lip and looking almost a little embarrassed.
“You did say that.” He grabbed Tony's hand and intwined their fingers, right over his heart. “Fair warning, I might fall asleep.”
“Hey, new blood.” Tony turned to see one of the vampires walk up to them with a giant grin that revealed his fangs. Real subtle. “First time, huh? Let me –“
"Do I have to?" Steve asked, but at a stern look from Tony he sat up with a sigh and stretched his arms over his head in a way that clearly showed off his biceps, highlighting the contours of his abs. Tony's mouth went a little dry.
Steve was pretty sure his mouth was hanging open as he stared at Tony in astonishment, but Tony just grinned, waving a hand at their surroundings. If JARVIS was playing any sound then it was too quiet for even Steve to pick up on it.
“No, this –“ Steve grunted on the next thrust, reaching down to grab Tony’s fist and make it tighter. “That’s perfect.”
Tony loosened his grip as Steve turned in his arms, pulling Tony into a hug before he stepped back into the spray. The water was just right, so Tony tilted his head back and let it rain down onto his face, washing away the sweat that had built up on his forehead. He startled, but quickly relaxed when he felt Steve's hands in his hair, lathering it with shampoo as Tony sagged against his chest.
His cock was still aching with oversensitivity, but the feeling was slowly shifting from a sharp sting to that same delicious throb that he'd felt before, his stomach twisting itself into knots. He was shaking all over, his thighs sliding against the table as he desperately tried to reach for that peak again, to make the tension burst –
“Stop that,” Sam snapped at Bucky, pointedly stepping back up into his space. “Alright, what do you got, Barnes? Let's go right now.”
“What can I say? I'm full of good ideas.” He chuckled, and she smirked. “So what can I do you for, Captain?”
The sound went straight to Steve's cock, which was – well. Steve probably wouldn't be able to hide how much he
, a quiet, broken sound that stuttered on its way out. Tony squeezed down around him, milking his cock until he could feel the throbbing in his
When he looked up Tony was looking right at him, his face flushed and chest heaving as he grinned like he'd just won the lottery, his eyes bright and twinkling, and – fuck.
Well. “I'm putting my trust in Barnes because I know where he was on the day of the explosion,” he said. “And it sure as hell wasn't in Vienna.” He felt Pepper nudge him in the side but Tony wasn't deterred. “I have security footage to back me up. Whoever blew up that building is still out there. You're hunting the wrong man.”
“Up on the couch,” Steve instructed, and Tony put one knee on the cushion before he let Steve guide him into position, pushing at Tony's back until Tony was lying flat across Steve's thighs, his ass up in the air with his other leg braced on the floor. His skin was already tingling with anticipation, and he couldn't help the small noise he made when Steve traced his fingers feather-light over the curve of his ass.
Tony woke up slowly, feeling like he was blinking through molasses. For a second he wasn't sure what had woken him up, but then he felt Steve's breath on his neck, his cold nose trailing over Tony's scent gland where he was spooning him from behind. Tony hummed happily, about to turn in Steve's arms to give him a proper good morning when Steve suddenly grabbed his hips and held him still.
“Right.” Steve patted down his trousers before he picked up his basket, grimacing a little at the twinge in his lower back as he bent down to grab it. Okay, so maybe he
“I could,” Steve mumbled, blinking his eyes open to look at Tony. They had a hazy sheen to them, something soft and relaxed that brought a smile to Tony’s lips. “Don’ wanna.”
But even if it wasn't, Steve was so firmly off limits that it wasn't even funny. For fuck's sake, he was
“Hm.” Mr. Stark leaned back in his chair, tapping his fingers on the desk. “So what did you do with the doll if you weren’t fucking it?” A pause. “Did you fuck yourself on it?”
Steve looked like he was barely breathing, his eyes firmly fixed on Tony, and Tony basked in the attention as he slowly undid Steve's buttons and pulled down the zipper, giving him ample opportunity to stop him. He didn't.
“That sounds rough, Tony, I'm sorry,” Steve said, his voice a little tinny over Tony's comm piece. “I wish I could help.”
“You're beautiful,” he said in the hushed tone that people usually reserved for church, his hands trailing over the insides of her thighs almost reverently, and Toni swallowed hard before she leaned back on her elbows, baring herself even more.
Steve woke up before his morning alarm, his body still soft and lax with sleep. He grumbled under his breath as he pushed his head back into the cushions, rubbing his forehead against – wait a second.
He stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes snapping over to Steve. Tony had to suppress a growl when he saw the vamp's nostrils flare as he took a deep breath, his eyebrows flying up towards his hairline.
A sudden rush of fear made Steve jump out of his seat, adrenaline chasing away the afterglow as he dropped to his knees at Tony's side, wiping the drool off his slack face. “Sweetheart? Hey, Tony, can you hear me?”
Cameras flashed and Tony had to take a moment to just stare at Bucky incredulously. He could see Pepper gesturing frantically from the sidelines and Tony followed her cue on autopilot, pulling Bucky up from his seat as he smiled at the cameras, throwing an arm around him.
He unconsciously counted five heart beats before Steve took a deep breath and started walking away. “Alright. I'll pick you up at eight next Tuesday.”
“He was thirty-six!” she groaned, rubbing her face with both hands. “Fuck's sake, I never wanted to be a fucking cougar!” She considered that for a moment. “Okay, that's a lie, but they're calling me his sugar mommy and that's almost like what they used to say about dad and –“
,” Tony moaned when Steve started fucking him right away, thick and hard and filling him up just right. It wasn't the first rut they'd spent together, but it was the first one that wasn't interrupted by Tony being needed elsewhere, and Tony hadn't expected just how wonderful it would be to fall asleep with Steve's knot still buried deep inside him.
you, you fucking asshole!” Tony laughed, turning to all of them with a huge grin, waving his hands at himself. “You seeing this? This is the key! Holy fuck, I can't believe we figured it out before Thor came back!”
“Um.” Steve looked down at his soaking wet crotch, and Tony rolled his eyes, tugging at him until Steve stumbled to his feet.
“Fine,” Tony gasped out before he looked up at Steve with what he hoped was a convincing smile. “It's okay. Didn't hurt at all.”
“That's very kind of you, thank you,” Tony said and found that the words came a lot more easily than usual, his body relaxed and soft in a way that didn't feel invasive or like he'd changed into someone he wasn't.
He'd thought he'd lost this, the feeling of his body doing what it was made for, and knowing that he could still feel that way was a gift he never thought he'd be given. He looked up at Steve, his heart pounding at the soft look in Steve's eyes, like he knew exactly how much this meant to Tony. Maybe he did.
He counted his way through the ten spanks to the sound of tinkling coins as Pepper finished writing down the next batch of tickets and slid them over, just out of frame of the camera.
Tony groaned when Steve came, just like that, letting Tony suck his orgasm right out of him as if it was nothing. He stuffed a hand down his own pants, jerking himself off furiously, and with the taste of Steve still on his tongue he followed him right over the edge, his whole body slumping with relief.
He tugged at Steve’s shirt until Steve took the hint and pulled it off in one go, his eyes burning into Tony’s. The familiarity of Steve’s skin against his was enough to bring a lump to his throat, his heart beating so hard it almost hurt, like it was trying to meet Steve’s in the middle.
Tony huffed out a breath, relief and a renewed tension battling in his gut at hearing Steve put a name to the mess in his brain. “Yes.”
Instead Steve lifted his hips to help Tony slide his pants down to his knees, sitting down heavily when Tony nuzzled his crotch, pressing his mouth against the bulge already in Steve's pants. He couldn't resist a little lick right over the wet spot at the head, and Steve's whole body twitched, his breathing getting even heavier.
“I know,” Steve said, not putting him down until they were in the shower. He didn't turn it on, mindful of what water pressure might do to Tony's backside right now, but he did wet a washcloth and wipe them both down.
“I'll be back here in two days,” he said loudly, and Tony came to a sudden halt, turning back to look at Steve with a cautious expression that barely hid the hope underneath. Steve nodded decisively. “I have to run some errands, but I should be here around noon. Just so you know.”
“My real name. It's Tony.” Tony probably should be panicking at least a little that he'd just let that slip, but in this moment it felt like exactly the right thing to so. Like this was what had bothered him all night. “You should probably know that if – you know. We do see each other. Again. Without –“ He waved a hand at their surroundings. “All this.”
Tony waved his free hand. “Oh, you know. Secret underground clubhouse. Vampires only though, so I don't think you'd be welcome there.”
Tony recognized it the moment he saw him in his stupid spangly outfit, that superior alpha posturing that got his hackles up like nothing else. It didn't help that both of them were under the influence of the scepter, but Tony was fairly sure that he would've been itching for a fight even if that hadn't been the case.
“Did you get good pictures?” Tony asked, and Steve jolted as if Tony had startled him, giving him a sheepish smile.
Steve thought about Bucky's words later when he was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. He knew he wasn't fine. He was lonely and yet pushing his friends away, which only made him more lonely. He'd turned to a goddamn sex doll for comfort and a cuddle buddy, for fuck's sake. If that wasn't a cry for help he didn't know what was.
“No, I –“ Toni swallowed. “Fifty just – it feels different, okay? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't do this anymore.”
Tony nodded, watching the doctor as he walked out of the room, his eyes lingering on the dip in his spine. He shook his head, pulling the gown up over his head and grimacing at the sticky wetness he still felt around his cock. He wiped himself down as best he could before pulling on his own clothes and sitting back on the table to wait for Steve.
Steve's breath was hot on Tony's cheek, his nose bumping into Tony's. “I thought about your mouth. On me.”
Tony's chest was heaving by now, his head thrown back so far that Steve could only make out the bottom of his chin, though he could still hear his heavy breathing that was interspersed with full-throated moans whenever the vines hit a particularly good spot. Steve would've loved to see Tony's face, but watching the plant fuck Tony like this, expertly wringing him in ways that made Tony squirm within his bonds – that was almost as good.
It felt good, the way it always did, but better than that was that he got to watch Steve's eyes widen as he sunk his cock into the warm dough, his hand clenching on Tony's shoulder.
Steve looked off to the side, his face tense as he worried his lip between his teeth. “I can't sign the Accords as they are now. If we could get them amended...”
“I want you to count them,” Steve said, and Tony took a deep breath before he nodded, bracing himself for the first hit. He still flinched when the flat of Steve's palm cracked against his ass, a sharp pain that only stung for a second before warmth bloomed across his skin, leaving behind an aching tenderness.
Tony snorted. “It’s barely as big as your finger, you –“ He gasped when Steve pushed it in, his hands clenching on Steve’s shoulders. “Fuck. That’s cold.”
Steve hadn't moved at all for the past few minutes, and Tony slowly blinked his eyes open to check on him, his heart clenching when he saw the serene smile on Steve's face. God, he looked so
Steve’s touch was feather-light as he trailed his fingers down the side of Tony’s face and Tony caught his hand to hold it between their chests as he moved closer.
He felt surrounded on all sides, every breath tinged with Steve's scent, his chest dipping in tandem with Steve's as if they were one person. His cock was squished so tightly between them that even this gentle rocking motion felt incredible, Steve's skin catching just right on that spot right under the glans.
And Tony moaned again, loud and unashamed in a way that made Steve's skin prickle with heat at the same time as it made icy tendrils of fear swirl in his stomach.
The entrance hall was just as impressive as the outside of the building, lined with expensive looking furniture and framed by long rows of elevators that lead to however many floors it had. Steve didn't even want to hazard a guess.
He didn't know how to explain it properly, but Mr. Stark nodded again, a weirdly knowing look in his eyes. Steve had expected pity, the thing he usually got, but instead there was... sympathy. Maybe a little bit of intrigue.
Tony looked down at their empty pizza boxes and nodded. No reason in stalling any longer. “Ready when you are, Steve.”
“And clean up on aisle four,” Tony said with a nod at the mess they'd made of the pie – and the floor surrounding it. “Hot damn. You really went for it.”
“Hey, guys!” They looked up to see Rhodey pulling Sam to his feet, Clint already bouncing on his toes behind them. “We're going to shoot some pool. Anyone wanna come?”
Tony was silent for a moment before he spoke, his voice a little shaky. "Wow. If I didn't know any better I'd say that's a nice proposal speech, Cap."
Steve shuffled forward, reaching up to run a single finger down her folds with a lot less hesitation that she'd almost expected. Toni made an encouraging noise, shifting her hips forward to give him better access, and Steve did it again, his touch so feather-light that it was more of a tease than anything else.
Steve laughed, squeezing his thighs as he hoisted him a little higher. "I guess I'll carry you then."
Tony yelped, whipping around with his blowtorch raised – only to find Steve sitting on the workshop couch, not even looking at him. “Fucking hell! When the fuck did you get here?”
“Ah, nothing that serious,” Bruce said evasively, rubbing the back of his neck. “As for where, he's probably –“
“Oh.” Tony sat up a little, looking off to the side before he met Steve's eyes again. Steve hated to see the sudden tension in his smile, knowing that he'd put it there. “Sorry. If you don't like it I can try to –“
more time, wouldn't it?” Tony asked a little bitterly before he shook his head and sat back in his chair. “I don't think Obie understands that you can't force human connection. Or that having a bunch of alphas chewing your ear off for hours on end isn't exactly fun.”
, and Tony was going to kiss him and feed him and probably fuck him silly. Not necessarily in that order.
“As long as it’s not a whole dog floor,” Steve said teasingly and Tony averted his eyes. “Oh, Tony. You didn’t.”
Tony shrugged, pulling out from under Obie's arm as soon as they got to their car. “I guess the treatment worked.”
to someone during sex, like Tony's body was an extension of himself, his cock sliding inside him like it was meant to be there.
“Okay,” Steve said quietly, his cock giving an interested twitch when Tony scratched him again, his own hands digging into Tony's sides. “Uh. We should probably –“ He choked on his words when Tony touched his cock again – but only tucked it back into his pants.
Steve's eyes were squeezed tightly shut as he let instinct take over and fucked the doll as hard as his body demanded, his fingers digging into its artificial flesh. It felt criminally good, and Steve wasn't surprised when he felt his orgasm creep up on him after only a couple of minutes, pressure building low in his gut.
“You smell so good,” he said, his voice muffled, and Tony couldn't suppress a relieved laugh, a probably disgustingly fond smile on his face.
“Totally.” Tony ran a hand through his hair as the elevator stopped on Steve's floor. “Not gonna lie, I was a little worried that it would be too spicy, but Pepper said you liked the Ganguo she brought you that one time and –“
was probably the right word. He looked like the doll, but at the same time they were nothing alike because Mr. Stark was
Steve kneaded the cheeks for a second before he pulled them apart and saw the tiniest opening in the silicone. It looked barely big enough to fit his cock.
“So Tony loves Clint loves Sam loves Bucky loves Wanda loves –“ He raised an eyebrow at her, and Wanda went bright red, twirling her hair around a finger as she glanced at Natasha.
For a second it almost looked like Steve was going to say no – which, hello, what guy said no to a free blowjob, what the hell – but then he nodded stiffly, looking anywhere but at Tony.
If Tony had a dollar for every backhanded compliment... “All I'm asking is for you to keep an open mind during the trial.”
“I can't –“ Steve couldn't bring himself to say it, but Tony was already nodding, sliding off his lap to put some careful distance between them, and Steve
“Promises, promises,” he said breathlessly, though he had no doubt that Tony meant it, and Tony laughed throatily, pulling his hand away before it came back after a few moments, suddenly slick. Steve wasn't sure he wanted to know where that came from.
“No need to be shy. If you want I'll scream with you.” Tony grimaced a little. “Might have to step back though. I don't want to blow out your eardrums. Or vice versa.”
“That’s –“ A very prepared speech, damn it. Steve had many things to say to that, but none of them made it past the ball of anger tying his throat shut. “I
Steve startled a little when Tony's arms wrapped around him from behind, his chin coming down on Steve's shoulder. Tony probably had to stand on his tiptoes to reach, and that mental image was enough to untangle the knot of not-quite-anxiety in Steve's gut.
“Well, I was home before you, so.” Tony pinched Steve's side and Steve chuckled before he pulled back enough to press a soft kiss to Tony's lips. His smile didn't quite reach his eyes when he nodded back at the table. “I thought we might as well have dinner. While we – you know.”
"You always do," Steve said, letting Tony herd him in front of one of the panels on the wall. Tony grinned when Steve went very still, apparently seeing where this was going. "Tony –"
It took a long time before Tony felt like he could move again, heaving himself upright until he could shuffle up the bed and flop down on his back next to Steve, staring up at the ceiling. Steve didn't say anything, and so Tony didn't either, just tried to catch his breath as his limbs melted into the mattress and awareness slowly crept back in.
“How are you feeling?” he asked, looking down at Steve with such a gentle expression that Steve had to avert his eyes as he pushed himself to his feet, his heart suddenly pounding.
“Okay.” Tony rubbed his hands over his thighs as he stood up, and Steve scrambled to his feet after him, his chin held high even though he looked – well, terrified was probably a good word for it.
Steve laughed tiredly, nuzzling Tony's collarbone as Tony ran a hand through his hair. His hand stilled all of a sudden, but before Steve could ask what was wrong, Tony grabbed a handful of Steve's hair and
When Steve opened his eyes Tony's face was a lot closer than before, his eyes heavy with promise as he put a hand on Steve's cheek.
"Thanks, Sam," Tony shouted after him, waving with a huge grin as Sam left the room. As soon as he was gone Steve groaned, putting Tony down so he could rub at his face. Tony laughed when he saw how red his cheeks were. "It's alright, honey. He's seen much worse."
“Let's move to the couch,” he said, and Steve nodded but made no move to get up. Tony sighed, gently guiding him back to his feet – or rather heaving him up until Steve could stand on his own, before he led them both over to the couch where Steve flopped down on top of Tony, burying his face in his chest.
“Okay.” Steve twitched, eyes going wide when Tony squeezed his arm so hard that he could see his hand shake, so hard it would probably hurt anyone else. “How about now?”
“I believe that Mr. Stark has been afflicted with hysteria,” Dr. Yinsen said, not beating around the bush. Tony frowned when Dr. Yinsen only glanced at him for a second before he kept talking directly to Obie. “It is a fairly common disorder that sits at the root of many types of behavioral disobedience in omegas. In fact I have a physician on staff who specializes in treatment of those exact symptoms.”
“We're not married.” Steve leaned forward to kiss Tony so softly that Tony's lips tingled with it before he laid on his side, pulling Tony down with him. They rolled over until Tony could spoon Steve comfortably, tucking his legs up and burying his face in Steve's neck. For a long moment they just breathed together and Tony could've nodded off to sleep like this if it weren't for the lingering tension in Steve's shoulders, the frustrations of today still hanging over them.
"Wait," Steve blurted, feeling immensely stupid when Mr. Stark froze, raising an immaculately sculpted eyebrow.
“No dice,” Steve said, looking down between them with thinly veiled disappointment. “I knew it was too small. Can't even feel it really.”
“Whu?” Tony blinked his eyes open, a little disoriented as he tried to find the source of whatever woke him up –
Tony took the chance to open his mouth in return, licking at the seam of Steve's lips. He groaned when Steve's tongue met his, following it into the heat of his own mouth where Steve set to exploring every inch that he could. Tony let him take the lead, grabbing Steve's jaw in one hand so he could feel the muscles work as Steve kept kissing him.
“It almost sounds like you're opposed to his methods,” Dr. Yinsen said, and Tony blinked, biting the inside of his cheek. He hadn't meant to let that slip.
I couldn't resist bringing them back. Man, it's been way too long since we had this group chat. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it!
“Are you okay?” Tony asked, concern cutting through the haze in his mind, and Steve groaned, sagging even further into his arms. Tony was very glad that being a vampire had granted him super strength, or they'd both be lying on the floor by now. “Steve, talk to me.”
Steve was getting hard. He could tell that Tony knew it too because Tony shifted in his lap so they were pressed closer together, his ass planted firmly on Steve's cock. Even muffled as the sensation was he could feel Tony's erection pushing up against his stomach where they were rubbing against each other now, and Steve wanted to cry because he
“I’m done with all of that.” Tony hugged Rhodey's leg to his chest, wrinkling his nose. “All that compatibility bullshit. I don’t need some asshole’s hormones to tide me over.”
Steve sighed, turning onto his side to sling his arms around the doll, wincing a little as its cold skin touched his. He knew that this couldn't be healthy, exchanging human contact for something like this, but for now he'd take what he could get. It would warm up soon enough, and then you almost couldn't tell the difference.
“Hey.” Toni touched her hand to his cheek, and he turned into the touch immediately, making Toni's heart thunder with the implications, the potential – but that wasn't for tonight. “It's okay. We don't have to do anything you don't want to, okay? Let's just enjoy the view.”
Tony closed his eyes, sinking into Steve’s embrace as his thoughts kept running in circles, reprimanding him for losing his shit, for letting any of this get to him in the first place when he knew better than to listen to some asshole’s opinion of him. But he couldn’t deny that it had struck a nerve, sent him back to a time he didn’t want to remember, a version of
Steve made a punched out noise when Clint dropped halfway on top of him as Bucky forced his way onto the couch. Clint squawked, kicking out at Bucky. “Dude!”
“What? No, I – I just meant because you work across the street.” It was hard to see under the orange light, but Tony thought Steve's cheeks were getting a little red. Tony laughed.
“What if we get caught?” Steve asked faintly, already knowing that any protest was a lost cause. Once Tony had his mind set on something... And who was he kidding, the thought of Tony fondling him on the subway was getting him hard enough to pound nails.
are. I'm so proud of you for telling me all of this. That must've been hard.” He paused. “No pun intended.”
Steve let out an uneven breath, his hands clasped so tightly that Tony could see his knuckles stand out white. “I didn't know you two were close.”
“Just be glad that you don't have to deal with that asshole,” Tony sighed as he walked into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of milk. He needed something to calm him down after that ordeal. “Anyway, how's DC? Did Nat eat your heart yet?”
“Fuck,” Steve panted, fingers still digging into Tony’s hips. “I’m sorry, I’ll get hard again, just give me a –“
“Who knows, maybe we'll surprise ourselves.” Steve's eyes were intense and Tony couldn't look away, his heart beating almost painfully in his chest. “I'll just say what I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, okay?”
“I wish I couldn't attest to that,” Natasha sighed, and Tony narrowed his eyes at her. “Relax. I meant that you two aren't exactly subtle. Or discreet.”
He looked almost nervous to ask so Tony smiled, clapping him on the shoulder. "Sure thing. But if you're gonna shave I'll go fetch my other one. This one's not technically meant to be used on beards."
“That's good,” Tony murmured, and the sound of his voice sent shivers down Steve's spine. “Touch me wherever you like. I'm all yours.”
Steve let out a shaky breath and nodded, raising Tony's hips a little to find the perfect angle before he pulled out and thrust in again, swallowing the sound he wanted to make. Tony didn't have the same restraint, moaning loudly as he clutched at Steve's shoulders. Steve had the brief thought that Tony might be playing it up for him a little, but then Tony clenched around him, twisting his hips to fuck himself on Steve's cock, and Steve lost himself in the rush of sensation.
“Can we get a move on, please?” Steve asked long-sufferingly and Tony punched Bucky in the shoulder before he went inside the jet.
He didn't bother knocking, knowing full well that Steve always kept his door unlocked. Lo and behold Steve was sitting on the couch reading a book, looking up at him with a smile and doing a double-take when Tony marched straight past him to the bedroom.
Toni stared at him, honestly speechless. This couldn't be happening. Her brain was throwing up 404 warnings as she tried to make sense of what Steve was saying.
“Bastard,” Tony panted and Steve laughed, crawling up over him to give him a lingering kiss. The taste sent a shiver down his spine, knowing what Steve had just done for him, and Tony forced his noodley limbs to cooperate as he flipped them over, landing ungracefully on Steve’s chest. “Fuck. I’m too old for this.”
“Please,” Steve whined, and Tony quickly moved forward to tug Steve's boxers down his legs, cursing as they tangled around his thighs – before he said fuck it and grabbed the multitool out of his discarded pants from yesterday to cut them clean off. With Steve's legs spread across the bed like this he wouldn't have gotten them off anyway.
fine if it puts you in danger,” Steve said sternly, his face hard. “How long have they been trying to get in touch with you?”
Toni sighed, taking a sip of her vodka sour as she leaned back against the couch, crossing her legs to let the slit of her dress travel up her thigh. “You know, back in my day we did handstands and cartwheels balancing beer bottles. I'm not impressed.”
Steve nodded frantically, his hands clenching on her waist as he pulled her closer until they were pressed together, chest to chest. “Yeah. Yeah, I want that.”
As they came closer he recognized the man sitting in the middle of the desk as Charles Winston, the vampire who ran the New York Council. Charles was actually a pretty well-known business man, CEO of Winston Enterprises, and Tony had known him long before he knew he was a vampire. He was pretty sure he'd complimented him on the fact that he never seemed to age at some point. The cheating bastard.
“Oh,” he breathed, and Toni's pulse jumped when he carelessly tossed his pants aside to drop onto his knees right in front of her, his hands coming up to grip her thighs as he stared at her core. “Wow...”
“Sorry about this,” Tony whispered, unsheathing his fangs in the desperate hope that this was what he was supposed to be doing, and Steve stared at him for a long moment before he nodded and tilted his head. For a split second Tony thought of just making a run for it instead because this was a
“It's nothing. I...” He laughed self-deprecatingly, bringing one hand up to wipe at his face. “It's stupid.”
“Yeah,” he said again, and she could feel his fingers trembling as he slid the zipper down until it rested against her lower back. She waited for him to make the next move, which he did after a moment of hesitation, sliding the dress off her shoulders and revealing the red lace bra she'd chosen for tonight. Steve looked at it intently, his eyes filled with hunger as he drank her in, reaching up until his hands were just barely grazing the underside of her breasts. Toni let him explore for a bit before she reached back and unclasped her bra, letting it fall to the floor with only a hint of trepidation.
He didn't know long it went on, but when they finally stopped he was panting, his heart pounding like he'd just run a full marathon as he opened his eyes. Tony looked like a vision, his smile so radiant that it almost hurt to look at, and before Steve could start to feel awkward Tony raised his arms and shouted.
“I should hope so.” Tony shifted on the couch. “So. Meet-and-greet. We've done the greeting and meeting, so I guess you could... I don't know. Tell me about yourself? Or something?”
Tony snorted. “Thanks, pantless wonder, but you still need to wear those on the way home.” He stretched his arms up over his head before he sluggishly pushed himself to his feet, gripping Steve's shoulder for support. “Come on. We can wash up in the bathroom.”
Steve came so hard his vision whited out, riding the pressure of his own fist as he pumped his cock until he had nothing left, slumping heavily onto his chair. By the time he could open his eyes again the plant had already lowered Tony back onto the floor, its vines retreating one by one until Tony's limbs dropped to the ground like they were made of rubber, completely motionless.
“Just – lie down, will you? We'll watch a movie or something and if you feel like it's about to go down sooner than expected we'll take our next steps. No need to jump the gun.”
“I'm fine. But thanks.” Steve had his hands clenched in his lap, his eyes anywhere but on Tony. It seemed like his earlier confidence had abandoned him now that they were sitting right next to each other. Damn it, Tony should've invited him to a restaurant or something instead, keep a bit more of a barrier between them.
. Tony cleared his throat, looking off to the side. “Well, I don't know about art, but I like to make stuff. Work with my hands, you know.” He tried to play into the innuendo by waggling his eyebrows, but Steve just kept looking at him.
“Oh my god,” Steve groaned, and Tony gave a strangled laugh, reaching down to grip his cock and hopefully take the edge off. He must've underestimated just how keyed up he was because that simple touch alone made him thrust up into his own hand with a desperate whine that he couldn't even try to hold back.
“I can't believe we're getting blackmailed by a plant.” He put his hands on his hips. “So what do we do now?”
Steve was pulling at his hair, an almost frantic groan tearing from his throat, and Tony moved back just in time to let Steve come all over his face, his cock tapping against Tony's cheek and chin with every pulse. Tony stroked him through it, his own cock throbbing in sympathy as he milked Steve completely dry until he was pushing Tony's hand away, shivering all over.
I just sent this to the UN but I thought I should forward you a copy. They told me that if I come back to the states I'll be put on trial for my crimes but I don't care. I'm coming home.
“Fuck, okay. Wait.” Tony pushed at his shoulder, and Steve froze for a second before he sat back on his haunches, a little confused. He almost swallowed his tongue when Tony turned over onto his stomach, pushing up to his knees until his ass was right in front of Steve, his hole still so damn open, completely on display –
“Oh.” Tony's eyes widened as he finally got it before he scrambled up onto his knees, pushing his own boxers down until he could slide them off his legs. Steve's gaze on him was downright
“Yes, well.” Tony was already counting the seconds until he could make a polite exit. “We both made it out, didn’t we?”
Steve was frowning at him now, and it only served to make Tony feel worse. “Don’t talk to me like that. I’m not –“
“Well?” he called out as soon as they were in reach, narrowing his eyes at Steve until he saw the papers in Steve's hand and accepted them with a nod. “Did it work?”
“Thank you,” Steve said, but the concierge didn't even look at him as they passed, just closed the door softly behind them. Tony felt a strong sense of foreboding as he looked down the narrow staircase.
“Oh my god,” he gasped, and Steve made a punched out noise as he let go of Tony's nipple to swipe a finger through the thin line of liquid that kept trickling down Tony's chest, pooling on his stomach.
“Happy birthday!” they both cheered, and Steve accepted their hugs and shoulder pats with a bemused smile, feeling a strong sense of foreboding as he looked back at the package.
“Let's just hope Thor finds Amora soon,” Tony said. “No offense but if I have one more thought about how pretty Clint's eyes are I'm going to gouge out my own.”
“No! Nothing's settled!” Steve shouted as his hands curled into fists even though his feet stayed rooted to the floor. He had no idea what the plant would do if it felt threatened by him again. “You don't have to do this! We'll find another way –”
They'd barely made it through the door before Steve took her in her arms and kissed her as if he was starving for it, his hands shaking when he pushed them up underneath the slit of her dress, landing on the bare skin of her hipbone.
“Ah, fuck it, I said active duty. Where else was he gonna go?” He handed her his notes and she glanced at them for a second before she sighed, shaking her head.
He felt Steve freeze in his grip before they both turned around to see Helen staring at them with wide eyes, her cheeks getting steadily more red.
Tony made a choked noise before he twisted his torso on the next thrust, pushing his hips up as far as he could with what little leverage he had. His cock still didn't reach Steve's cock head.
Tony narrowed his eyes for a split second before he forced a bland smile. “And what kind of man am I, my prince?”
The change was gradual, starting with a tingle at the base of his spine that quickly spread to the rest of Tony's body as Steve's scent changed, turned into something utterly
"Of course," Steve said without hesitation, waiting for a moment of panic at the realization – but it never came. Wow. "When the timing's right... yeah. Yeah, I would."
Steve swallowed hard, moving a little closer until his forehead was touching its temple, his hand brushing against the fabric of the doll’s pants with every stroke.
In the end though what was done was done and Tony couldn't do anything about it other than try to help Steve in the aftermath. Which proved to be a lot more difficult than Tony had anticipated.
Tony hummed, his fingers tapping an irregular rhythm on the back of the couch. “Maybe you can just tell me how you usually jerk off. Give us a place to start.”
“Yeah, you know.” Tony shrugged. “I guess they don't like vamps running around without a council leash. To which I say thanks but no thanks.”
“Not today though. I have other plans.” Tony waved him along as he walked towards the back of the workshop. “Come on. It'll take a bit to set up, but you might as well watch.”
“Everything you dreamed of, big guy?” Toni asked, trying to lighten the suddenly heavy mood, and he looked up at her with something like awe and a lot more like love written all over his face.
Tony looked right back at him, fighting not to clench his hands into fists. “He killed my parents. I know damn well who I'm protecting. And what that means.”
. Tony groaned when Steve leaned down and licked the nipple he wasn't rolling between his fingers, fitting his mouth around it and
"Don't shave." Tony ran his thumb over Steve's bottom lip, feeling his heart beat in his chest when his thumb brushed the bristles on Steve's chin. "Holy shit."
“Oh, come off it, Stark. We both know that you build weapons when they’re necessary.” The general grinned conspiringly, leaning uncomfortably close. “The Iron suit? That’s the most high-tech weapon on the planet right now. If you were to extend your research to our R&D department, even just the basics of it, we could -“
Steve's undercover ops were the bane of Tony's existence. Weeks, sometimes months, of no contact and nothing to keep him company but a cold, empty bed. And with little else to focus on, Tony's mind cycled through worst case scenarios faster than a rolodex. It was torture.
“I'm sorry,” Steve said, unable to keep the devastation out of his voice, and Tony's mouth twisted into an unhappy line.
“Tony,” Steve panted against his mouth, hips already hitching up into his, and Tony hummed, sliding his hands down Steve's chest.
Tony let him, mostly just leaning against the wall to keep himself upright as he watched Steve work, his ass really starting to ache now that his blood was flowing freely again. “Fuck, that really stings. You said salve?”
“That was nice,” he sighed, and Steve groaned, his hips jerking as he came again with a shuddering moan. Tony chuckled. “Guess it's
Steve had no idea how Tony knew this, but Steve sniffed haughtily, leaning back to raise an eyebrow at him. “So? I like it. Is that a crime?”
“I'm sleeping here tonight,” Tony declared, dropping his buttload of pillows along with the blanket on the tragically barren bed and propping his hands up on his waist. “We need more pillows.”
“You don't know what I'll do!” Steve protested, still holding out the vibranium cuffs Tony had made for the occasion. “It's safer this way. Fury said it could take anywhere between fourteen and twenty hours before it hits –“
“No, I want to,” Tony said decisively, putting the bottle up on the highest shelf of their bathroom cupboard before he closed it firmly. “Let’s do this.”
If the plant understood him it didn't listen as it slid several vines up to the straps of Tony's shirt, pushing them off his shoulders while another two traveled down his stomach. Once the buckle on his belt was unclasped, Tony's pants slid down easily, bunching up around his ankles and leaving him in only his boxers which – judging by the rustling of leaves – seemed to excite the plant. Its intentions became crystal clear when it began exploring Tony's bare chest eagerly, much to his apparent dismay and Steve's... well.
So Tony pulled a Spiderman Homecoming and remote controlled the suit. I hope you guys aren't too disappointed that they didn't meet yet, I promise I'll make up for it when they DO meet in the end.
“Hm?” Steve didn't even pause in his endeavor to apparently push his nose along every single inch of Tony's neck, and honestly Tony was too tired to care.
Tony swallowed hard. “Love you too.” He put their foreheads together, closing his eyes as he soaked up the feeling of Steve's body against his. “I missed you so much.”
“I know,” Tony said with a smug grin as Steve turned the package to get a better look. “It's exactly what it looks like.”
“You can use your mouth,” she said, tapping a finger against the hand on her clit. “Right here. Lick it, suck it – I can tell you how as we go along.”
“Stay near the opposite door, with your back to it,” Tony mumbled in his ear. “I'll be right behind you. Literally.”
“My ass hurts,” he grumbled, and Steve laughed softly, pulling back to kiss him square on the mouth.
His voice held enough of a challenge that Steve felt his hackles rise to it, and before he could second-guess himself he reached out and placed his palm right in the middle of Tony's chest.
"I really do love the beard," he said after a long moment and Steve smiled, tracing Tony's goatee with two fingers.
Pepper's laugh made her chest feel a little lighter after that talk. It was hard to feel like you were getting too old for something. Or that she had to be the responsible one when a young man tried to hit on her.
, his entire body locking up as his cock started throbbing, and Steve swallowed it all, his tongue still pressed along the length of Tony's cock. For a long second Tony forgot how to breathe, but when he finally remembered to suck in a gust of much needed air it emerged in a loud groan that seemed to reverberate through his entire body, making him shiver.
“Dr. Rogers will be with you in a moment,” Dr. Yinsen said before he closed the door, leaving Tony to his own devices. For a wild second Tony considered climbing through the window and making a run for it, but in the end it would be pointless. Without his legal guardian Tony couldn't get a passport, let alone pay for whatever accommodations he needed. He'd be stuck on the streets, and ill-advised medical treatment or not, Tony wasn't desperate enough for that.
“Don't scare it!” Tony shouted, flapping his arms around frantically. “It hates fast movements!” Case in point the plant slapped Tony's flailing arm with a flat leaf before a vine wrapped around it to restrain him. Steve sighed in defeat.
“I see.” Dr. Yinsen gave Tony a long look before he stood up and gestured towards the door with a bland smile at Obie. “If you would, Mr. Stane. I need to speak to the patient alone.”
“It's a fine asset though,” Tony said, grinning when Steve slapped his hip lightly. “I definitely couldn't stop thinking about
The last slap felt like absolution, coming down hard enough to make Tony scream as his chest cracked open. It felt as if that hit opened a festering wound deep inside him and let all of the poison spill out. Tony was sobbing now, his ass on
“Thank you,” he said, his breath catching audibly when Toni set the glass to her lips and downed it in one go. She watched as he swallowed hard, his eyes glued to her throat for a long moment before he visibly caught himself, giving her a small smile and a stammered excuse before he turned and left her standing by the entrance, her empty glass still in her hand.
“The honor is mine, Mr Stark.” It didn't sound like it was. “I understand you are the Winter Soldier's chaperone.”
“M'kay,” Tony mumbled, already drifting off to the feeling of Steve's hand combing through his hair. “Love you.”
“No, it’s okay.” Steve really hoped it was. “Just promise me you’ll read the fine print before you sign up for anything next time?”
“This is so ridiculous,” Steve mumbled under his breath, and Tony burst out laughing, giving him a fond look.
“Obviously.” Pepper's lips curled up in a smile as she stood, straightening her blouse. “Come on, we have a board meeting in half an hour.”
“Because you know me.” Tony smiled when Steve pulled him in for a kiss that went from chaste to filthy very fast. They could’ve probably taken it further, but Tony was content to let Steve keep the pace slow until they were just breathing the same air, his head pillowed on Steve’s shoulder.
“Steve?” Tony asked sleepily, and Steve's breathing hitched as he nuzzled Tony's shoulder again. “Hey, what –“
“Well, they invited me to the goddamn factory,” Steve snapped. “And it’s mandatory because you didn’t pay for anything, and –
Steve looked a little discomfited, but before Tony could try to fix that they reached the pizza place, and Tony wisely let Steve enter first this time. He wasn't prepared for Steve to open the door, step aside and bow with a cheeky glint in his eye as he waved him through. “After you.”
"Good," Tony said, his voice a little rough, and watched as Steve's pupils dilated at the sound, his grip on him tightening. "I hope you didn't want to see everyone right away. It's just us tonight.”
“Bite me,” Steve said, grunting when Tony twitched at his words, desire burning up in him like a stick flame. “Bite me again, Tony, please –“
“I'll call a cab,” Steve said under his breath, not too keen on anyone thinking he was talking to himself. “Then you can do whatever you –“
"Oh my god." Steve still sounded a little overwhelmed, but his death grip slowly gentled into something a little closer to a hug. Tony closed his eyes as he laid his head down, the feeling of Steve's heart pounding against his cheek making something soft and raw stir in his chest.
So, I know a lot of you guys are... let's say displeased with Steve's actions in the last chapter. I promise he has a reason for not contacting Tony, just hold on a little longer. The next few chapters will explain things a little more. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoy this one!
Steve hummed. “Of course not. I heard that when Captain America breaks a promise somewhere a puppy dies.”
He couldn't really describe the feeling of it. It was uncomfortable, yes, but underneath that there was a flicker of pride at being able to take it, along with a muted pleasure that seemed just out of reach for now. But Steve knew that he would get there with time.
“The ritual feeding is sacred,” one of the older vampire sneered. “Mr. Stark has brought an unclaimed human into our midst. He is not leaving without providing for the Council.”
“You knew that already,” he said with a cheeky wink, and Steve couldn't not kiss him, his hands sliding down Tony's back to grab his bare ass, and Tony moaned, the sound sending shivers down Steve's spine. Tony jumped up to wrap his legs around him, and Steve didn't waste a second to get them horizontal on the bed, never breaking the kiss until he was pressing Tony back against the mattress.
you,” Steve said, his grip tightening with what felt like desperation. “This is all wrong, I love you so much and it's never been like this before –“
“Very nice,” Pepper said, stepping closer to straighten his collar before she patted his shoulders. “Remember, one tap for a regular meet-and-greet, two taps for the blowjob. I'll arrange everything once you've decided.”
Tony's back arched as Steve's thumb rolled over his nipple, circling the little nub before he set his fingers and
One of the council members stood up, his cloak billowing behind him. “You would dare insult the council like this?”
“Alright. I know when I'm not wanted,” she said, pushing herself to her feet. “Please don't ruin the couch. I still want to sit here.”
Steve's chest hitched and Tony was about to keep talking when Steve suddenly thrust up into him so hard that Tony's voice broke on a moan.
Steve dropped the letter on his desk, hurrying to his closet to pull out the giant carton that he hadn’t found the motivation to get rid of yet, turning it this way and that until he found the address –
Steve nipped at Tony’s lower lip before he slid his tongue back in, shivering when Tony met him in the middle. Usually he could’ve done this for hours, really lost himself in it, but when he shifted on the bed his knee bumped the clear tube and he
seemed to go on forever, every muscle in him poised to snap as he waited for that one perfect moment that would tip him over the edge –
Steve's shoulders tensed involuntarily, but after a moment he nodded, pulling out of Tony's embrace so he could look at him. It'd be better to get this over with sooner than later. “Alright. What do you want to know?”
They didn’t speak on the way to their bedroom, just kept stealing glances at each other that said more than words could anyway. Steve’s hands were slow and steady as he tugged Tony’s shirt over his head, pulling him into an embrace as soon as his chest was bare. Tony tilted his head back, shivering at the feeling of Steve’s beard scratching against his neck as Steve trailed kisses down his throat.
Clint hummed, munching as he looked off to the side. “Makes sense. It usually hits the morning after.”
“More?” Steve asked incredulously, watching from the doorway as Tony arranged his small pile of bedding before marching over to Steve's closet and feeling around for spare blankets, wrinkling his nose in disgust at the coarse fabric. “What are you doing?”
He was babbling something, a litany of “please, oh god, please”, and Tony's breath was hot on his neck, on his chest, everywhere Tony could reach to press searing kisses into his flesh that seemed to leave burning hot marks all over his skin. Steve couldn't remember the last time he'd wanted to come so desperately, but something was holding him back, keeping him right on the edge until every thrust felt like it was forcing a tiny orgasm out of him, yet without providing any of the relief that came with it.
“He wasn't bonded though. And it's only been three years for me,” Steve said evasively, and Tony gritted his teeth.
“That was before I discovered the wonders of nipple-sucking,” Tony sighed, raising his glass to toast past lovers. “Good times, man.”
“Your fantasy is me in transit?” Steve asked, and Tony practically could hear the cheeky smirk on his face. He rolled his eyes.
“Yep,” Tony said, popping the 'p' with a sunny smile. “I've been thinking about you all day. If you're up for it we could even do it together, what do you say?”
Tony didn’t even mean to say it, but his throat was tight with emotion when Steve’s eyes softened as he grabbed his hand.
Tony nodded, but Steve could see the surprise there before his jaw clenched and he squeezed harder, so hard his hand was shaking. He brought his other hand up to help along, and even though that was better, it still –
Steve looked at the unassuming package, his eyes trailing down the side and catching on the label. “Holy shit.”
They both groaned when Steve bottomed out in one push, his forehead pressed against Tony's shoulder as they just breathed together for a couple of seconds, trying to regain their equilibrium. Tony wound his fingers into Steve's hair, gently pulling him up into another kiss, his spine tingling when he tasted the sweet tang of his own milk in Steve's mouth, his hips hitching up into Steve's.
“My apologies, Captain. It appears as though its biological composition is unlike any of the plants in my database.”
Tony's eyes went wide before they narrowed in suspicion. “Okay, I know this is hard for you to grasp right now, but those feelings aren't –“
The past couple of weeks have been a LOT (I moved and started at a new job, which I would suggest never doing during a lockdown because it SUCKS), so I'm still doing a lot of adjusting in real life. But I'm determined to get back to semi-regular updates on this. It might still take a while, but once I've settled back into a rhythm I'll finally finish this thing.
His heart was still racing when two officers finally brought Bucky out into the stand. Their eyes met across the room and Tony gave him a subtle nod that Bucky returned.
“That –“ His breathing hitched, hands clenching on Steve’s shoulders when he found that spot right under his jawbone. “Fuck. Holy fuck.
Tony felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes as he nodded frantically, humping against Steve so hard his thighs were starting to burn. “Wanna be good for you.”
"That's an absolute lie." Tony stretched his arms above his head before flopping over until he landed more or less on Steve's chest, pushing his face into his neck. "You knew exactly what would happen. With that fucking beard."
“Oh no.” Tony made a choked noise when Steve suddenly grabbed his ass and pulled him forward, shoving his cock back into the pie. “You started this, we're going to finish it.”
Steve's breathing caught in his throat when Tony made a strangled noise, hips kicking up as one of the vines traced circles over the head, digging right into the slit. The other one was winding round and round the base, dragging its entire length over it, and judging by how wide Tony's eyes suddenly were the sensation had to be something else.
“Just like that,” Tony sighed, but Steve couldn’t tear his eyes away from his ass, the way it was gaping open around an invisible intrusion, around Steve’s
Tony looked over at Bucky who was looking marginally more relaxed than before and grinned. “I think we can handle that, can't we?”
“Well, I love you too much to let you do it alone. Idiot,” Tony said fondly, and Steve put his head in his hands with a sigh. “We'll figure it out, yeah? And if you're so concerned about hurting me there are tons of ways to make it more safe.”
Toni pulled away after a moment, trying to gauge Steve's reaction, but Steve didn't let her get too far before he chased her mouth with his, his hand coming up to brace himself on the window behind her as he pressed her back into her seat. Toni let him keep that illusion of control as she took over the kiss, leading by example to show Steve where to put his tongue, how to move his lips to send shivers down her spine. To his credit, Steve was a very quick learner, and soon enough they pulled apart, panting lightly as they shared the same air.
Tony grinned as he kept working, mentally patting himself on the back for a job well done with every muscle he could feel gradually loosening in Steve's body. Steve was beautiful like this, all that strength and raw power going soft and lax under Tony's hands... fuck, Tony could get addicted to this.
Steve grinned, dropping one more kiss on Tony's chest before he moved further down, nuzzling Tony's happy trail until Tony was squirming, his cock a hot line against his thigh.
“What do you think?” Tony asked and Steve wrapped his arms around him, warm hands against the small of Tony's back.
“She hasn't changed then,” Steve said and Tony was relieved to see a shaky but genuine smile on his face. “You should've seen her in the army. She was a spitfire. Didn't care what anyone said about her. Always charged head-first into battle.”
It had probably only been minutes but to Steve it felt like a lifetime, lying on his back with his eyes closed as he listened to Tony spin tale after tale, never once running out of air. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so light in the chest, like nothing else mattered but this moment suspended in time.
.” Tony grabbed Steve's face, pulling gently until Steve looked back up at him, his eyes shining with moisture at the corners. Damn it. “There was no one else. I know we were – you know, but I didn't. I swear. The thought never even crossed my mind.”
And he came, messily, all over her chest and stomach as he sobbed out ruined noises and buried his face in her hair, his arms wrapping around her to hold her close while he shook through his orgasm. Toni stroked him through it, milking him for every drop until Steve started squirming on her lap, whimpering with oversensitivity. She wiped her hand on the sheets before she hugged him back, guiding him backwards until they were lying side by side, still wrapped up in each others' arms.
“Suck it,” she ground out, her mouth dropping open on a groan when he obeyed, fitting his mouth around her and encasing her in warmth. The suction was perfect, keeping rhythm with the fingers pushing against her G-spot, and Toni felt her thighs start to shake as her stomach tightened in anticipation –
Tony sincerely doubted that but since Bucky had been adamant about making his own choices during this trial he couldn't really say anything. His testimony had been as much of a mess as Tony had expected, but in the grand scheme of things he could see how it might make Bucky seem more sympathetic, the way he'd stoically confessed to each and every accusation, with the exception of Vienna. They'd just have to hope that the jury saw it that way too.
, stuffing Tony's mouth, and he only had a second to see the wide-eyed surprise in Tony's eyes before they rolled shut and he let out a deep-chested groan that was abruptly cut off by what Steve could only assume was the plant pushing into his throat. He was fucking his fist by now, pressure building just behind his balls, flooding his entire body with heat as he tried to hold off, make this last a little longer –
Tony cried out when he crested for a third time, his entire body shaking as the heat spread from his groin all the way to the tips of his fingers and toes, lighting him up like a live wire –
giving head. He'd be the first to admit that he had a bit of an oral fixation, what with him getting off on having his mouth stuffed full of cock, but it had served him well in this line of work. At least he didn't have to fake how much he enjoyed it.
Another hit. Tony clenched his teeth when the pain lingered a little longer this time, his ass probably bright red by now. “Fourteen.”
to be a mask, because there was no way that Steve could witness him falling apart like this and not feel anything –
There was no way Steve could know that for sure, but before Tony could voice his objections Steve started down the stairs, and Tony had to hurry to catch up to him. The staircase opened up into a big, open space that was already crawling with people. There had to be more than a hundred, and Tony was honestly a bit stumped by the number of vampires he counted. He didn't expect there to be so many.
“You're still sure about this, right?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded, touching the filling with one pointed finger and swallowing hard.
“So this is the place?” Steve asked dubiously, looking up at the gigantic skyscraper that couldn't look more bland if it tried. “I expected more... velvet.”
Tony never said anything, and luckily the team followed his example. He’d hate to make Steve self-conscious about this when he knew that Steve always tried so hard to uphold his strong alpha male image, despite knowing that Tony didn’t give a shit about that.
Tony tapped at one of the drawings, and Steve looked down to see his favorite version of Tony's fond smiles staring back at him, the one that always made his blood pump faster and his breathing hitch. Steve swallowed hard, his face heating up with a blush. He remembered drawing this. That picture had been pure wish fulfillment because after what he did Tony would never look at him like that again –
"Good." Tony reached out and tugged at a strand of Bucky's long hair, clicking his tongue. "You're not overly attached to this, are you? Cause I won't touch it if this is like, your spiritual connection to the new world or whatever –"
He wasn't entirely surprised when he felt Steve's cock firming up where it was pressed against his thigh, although Steve made no move to do anything about it, his face still slack where he was leaning on Tony's shoulder. Tony was hard too, but not achingly so, and he could feel the familiar wet warmth of slick between his thighs, slowly building to the point where Tony knew Steve would be able to just slip right in, nice and easy, without any pressure. If Steve could smell it already he didn't show it, his breathing still deep and even as he let Tony work his magic.
He couldn't hold back a groan at the familiar weight of a dick on his tongue, sliding all the way to the back of his mouth and filling him up just right. If Tony had his way he'd be doing this 24/7, just keep his mouth stuffed with a dildo until his jaw was aching, but alas, real life demanded him to speak from time to time.
“Nothing to be ashamed of, of course. Hell, if I had that kind of money I'd have a woman on each limb. Plus two for prosperity.”
A tension Tony hadn't even realized was there leaked out of his shoulders as he let Steve tilt his head up to give him a kiss, a gentle sweep of his tongue that sent chills down Tony's spine.
“Mhm.” Steve heard Mr. Stark shuffle his feet as he probably sat back in his chair, but couldn't bring himself to look at him. “I can imagine. It feels pretty real, doesn't it?”
The look Steve gave him turned contemplating for a split second before he seemed to shake it off, turning until he was seated sideways on the couch, mirroring Tony's position. “What about you? What do you do? I mean.” Steve waved a hand at their surroundings. “When you're not doing this.”
Steve snapped his mouth shut, but the words had already escaped. For a moment Tony looked utterly gobsmacked, but then he nodded again, his eyes shuttering.
