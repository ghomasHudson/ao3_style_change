Tony doesn’t answer. His mind is doing its best to figure this out. His eyes glance in Strange’s direction for a bit, but not for longer than a second. Maybe not even that.
“I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that,” he mumbles out before he can think of it. But his words don’t seem to move that smile away from her face. Especially when Wanda lands down right behind her, looking pissed off and yet relieved to see him at the same time.
“Alright, we all have our assignment. Three Stones uptown, one Stone down. Stay low, and keep an eye on the clock.”
“The purple man’s name, tell me?” Tony asks after a few seconds of silence. He can remember seeing Bruce this morning; he hadn’t been so… tense. They had joked over breakfast, agreed that they would go and tinker a bit later in the afternoon.
There’s the usual banter always needed to lighten the mood a bit, but Steve’s not entirely joining in on it. His mind is still stuck in space, where two of the most important people in his life are currently stuck with maybe no way home. After they finish here, if they finish here, they need to start a rescue search.
“If I might interject,” Loki suddenly says, no longer paying attention towards Hilde nor Yaël. Thor, meanwhile, is still breathing heavily, his shoulders shaking, as he’s lying on the ground. “If you’re going
Steve, too, is grinning the moment he sees him. He holds a hand against his chest, as if he’s trying to keep his heart from pounding so fast. At least, that’s what Tony thinks, since his own heart is pounding like it is.
"Aye, Lady Barton", Thor said. "My brother was wrongfully executed and was somehow reborn into the boy you saw. Stark and Rogers have adopted him as their own."
Frigga caressed the leather cover, grief visible in her eyes. "The spell is basically making a demand of Fate. Saying that your life has been so miserable undeserved that you could go anywhere and be happier than the life you leave behind. That's the second condition of the spell. It doesn't work on someone who has been happy and satisfied most of their life.
"What are you guys talking about?" The engineer asked, curiosity peaked. In answer he was handed the notebook. Only, it turned out to be a sketchbook. Full of drawings. Flipping through them he was impressed with the level of detail. Especially the portraits.
The god of thunder had spotted the small boy, recognising him. First there was shocked astonishment but it quickly faded into fury. "How dare you!" He roared and stomped towards the tiny Trickster. "You tricked me! Mother! Even the Avengers! You snake, you..."
And okay, he most definitely did want to have sex with a certain soldier again. Because that had been great. As if summoned by his thoughts Steve stepped out of the elevator.
Their son sulked at getting his request denied but he didn't throw a tantrum. Once the lasagna was done he also ate without complaint. So, they figured it was fine if he got pizza later.
When Natasha hears him talk, she smiles despite her tears. She’s always happy to see him, that much he knows. It’s never going to stop the tears, but it will curl up her lips at least a tiny little bit. Her hair has grown again; she never really bothered to have it cut after half the world disappeared.
Peter has no idea what’s going on. It’s almost like this is such a huge prank they’re playing on him, and he doesn’t find it hilarious at all if it is one. He doesn’t even want to go further in the house, to see what’s making Morgan so happy; Morgan is a five-year-old kid, she probably has no idea that one of her dads just died.
T’Challa starts giving out orders. Steve decides to come along with him. He’s followed by Natasha and Bruce, while the others remain inside to help start with the extraction of the Mind stone.
Once it’s ready, Clint offers himself up to go for a test round. Tony has no idea what conversation happened back there, but at this point, Rhodey and Scott are discussing the probability of old time-travel movies and in what way they are bullshit. It’s not his deal. He watches Clint step up on the platform. Bruce takes control of the project, so Tony stays to the side. Next to Thor, who keeps on showing him pictures of his children with a happy smile.
Carol, Rocket and Nebula went back to space. After all, it’s not only Earth that has been hit by the massacre. Nakia, being T’Challa’s former fiancé, has taken over the Wakandan throne for the time being. Except, there’s no after. There is no more heir to the throne, after all. Nobody could say that, magically, Nakia had been pregnant with the King's child or anything like that.
And Steve can understand more than anything why Tony had been hesitant about it. He had been thinking it over for months, wishing Pepper happiness, but at the same time feeling like he was going to betray Peter by creating another child. Eventually, Steve managed to talk him through it, and a couple of months later there was Morgan.
“How far away are we?” Yaël asks with clear annoyance, though allowing Helen to draw some blood. She flinches a bit when the needle goes through her skin, but other than that she doesn’t react from it.
Steve finds some new strength inside of him and he jumps up to resume the fight. He tightens his grip on his shield, looks around to see where to start, and slowly but surely starts nearing Thor until, eventually, they’re next to one another. With another bit of teamwork between the two of them – they’ve realized early on that they work well in battle – the two manage to get a bit of a breather as they look at each other.
He takes down three more guys, standing close to Shuri who gives him a friendly smile. In any other situation, he would have greeted her, maybe try and start a conversation after having heard so much about her. Now, all he can do is watch how Tony is using the last of his strength to pull on Thanos’ arm in another attempt to get the glove off. Thanos seems less than impressed and swats him away easily. He immediately raises his hand, says something that Peter can’t hear, and snaps his finger.
“You know, I never thought I’d see these guys ever again,” Peter admits when Steve pulls away. He points towards the large Space Whales, but he’s immediately distracted by the weapon now sitting on the ground next to him. “Is that Mjölnir? How did you get it? Can you hold it? Does that mean that Thor is here as well?”
There have been many funerals Peter has been to in his life. To be fair, he had really hoped that Gwen’s would have been the last, but it seems like the world does not exactly agree with that thought.
“Thank God.” There’s another audible eyeroll from Yaël, who pushes down her sleeve. Dr. Cho moves to her equipment and puts the tube filled with blood into some sort of machine to get the results. Hilde has no idea what she’s supposed to learn from it, but at this point she doesn’t even care, anymore.
“I know you got a lot on the line, with your daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lost of people did. And now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you’re telling me that won’t even-“
It’s obvious that the world knows who she is, or at least that she’s there, but in contrary to the rest of her teammates, she’s always had the luck that her face never really appeared on any pictures or videos.
“In case you hadn’t read it, I’m in a committed relationship,” Tony starts, holding up his hands in a ‘what will you do about it’-gesture. “I mean, not that I would even take you up on your offer because I just don’t
“We can’t,” Steve clarifies, meaning Tony with that. They love Morgan, with all their heart. They would do anything to her, and surely if anything were to happen to the kid they would probably both lose their crap even more than they already have.
“Alright, that’s enough of that,” Tony interrupts him. With his arms still crossed, he keeps his eyes on the technology around him. “The ship is self-correcting its course. Thing’s on autopilot.”
He’s interrupted again as Tony pulls him into another hug. Ignoring all the action around him, he kisses his son on the top of his head and wishes to never let go again. But they’re quickly interrupted by another flying figure passing them by.
“No!” she shouts before Thanos could reach Loki. She grabs her knife and swings it in the direction of Thanos’ neck. She’s fast, but Thanos is faster. His hand moves up until the weapon seals itself inside his hand. He grimaces when he looks at his hurt hand and pulls out the knife. Without warning, that very same knife ends up slicing through her gut. The weapon sticks out of her belly, while the green colored blood starts dripping out of the wound. She never even saw it coming. How could she not see it coming? She’s been trained for this; she’s the fiercest warrior in the universe. He’s made her that way.
Tony looks over the people around here. Most of them, he recognizes, but others he even has no idea of their names. At his point, he doesn’t even care. When he notices Thor sitting further away on a bench, he notices the God is sulking.
And seeing Yaël at this celebration she sees that it’s good for her to be among friends. It seems like she’s a bit more at peace with Loki’s end.
Well, as he said, a lot has happened over the past few years. Steve is in the car, wondering if he should go home yet, or if he should, maybe check up on Natasha. He’s been doing that for the past few months after she’s been hiding out in the compound, so it won’t hurt to do so again.
She doesn’t like the current tension going around there. Stark and his son going missing really set the mood for the remaining time, and it won’t get better until there’s word of them being safe. But Hilde can’t call out for them. It’s too dangerous to attempt at communicating.
“Neither could I.” Then he looks back at the ship, as if he’s waiting for one more person to come down.
“I lost him, Steve,” Tony says. If he had any hydration left in his body, he would have been crying. But there’s nothing there, anymore. His tears are dry, his voice cracking.
Once the charge is enough, Wanda directs the power to the stone. Recognizing its source, her magic finds its target easily. She hesitates slightly when Vision’s eyes grow wide in surprise, but she can’t stop. She’s not allowed to.
It’s not a question. It’s not an order, either, but he also knows that Wanda will listen. She nods, finally looking over at him with a pale face.
“Yes, you can.” Vision pulls her hand away and keeps it in front of his forehead. In front of the stone. “If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.
Instead, he directs his next words to Bruce. “Hey, do you want a piece?” he asks, as if he’s offering Bruce his last piece of pie. That in itself is really rare since Tony doesn’t share his pie.
“For what? Nearly dropping me into space?” Strange counters, not at all sounding impressed. A fury sparks up inside of Tony, and he marches forward to face Strange with a heaviness in his breath, his hands balled into fists.
“Let me tell you. That kid’s not even here yet and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him.” Howard steps aside, past Tony. That gives Tony a clear view to Steve, who shoots him a questioning glance. Tony holds up his hands and pokes at his watch, with that also showing off the brief case and the bouquet of flowers he’s still holding.
Wanda fights against her tears. If this is the last time she is to see Vision, she doesn’t want her sight of him to be blurred. Because this is the one she loves. The only one she has left. And after this, there won’t be anybody else.
The banter falls quiet. Steve hands Thor an extra earpiece so he can stay in touch with the rest of the Avengers. After the initial greeting, he hears the rest happily greeting him. It’s a good enough distraction, until T’Challa’s voice comes through the comms with the message to fall back.
“Yes, you can. You have no obligations here right now,” Strange interrupts him. Tony glares at him, pointing up a finger in his direction.
“In that case, Asgard will have had four different rulers in the span of only two months. I would call that a story to tell the future generations, no?” Thor smiles his teeth bare at his brother, who seems about close to just storm back out and smash his head against the wall.
“You’re right,” Steve agrees. Then he lets out a deep breath; better get on with it. “I’m thinking of joining Tony. In that whole ‘retirement-‘business. Looks like a lot of fun.”
, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?” And why won’t he let go of Peter when Tony has clearly lowered his own weapon?
Sam laughs. “Alright, can’t argue with that,” he agrees. After a quick goodbye Sam steps away from the bench. Steve watches him disappear back in the direction of his car. Once Sam’s completely out of view he turns his head to Tony’s.
Uncle Ben’s had been rough. It had mostly been his fault, too. Had he just stopped that robber, then things would have been fine. But he didn’t, and because of that his Uncle died. He barely made it through the funeral without wanting to march out of it, the guilt eating up at him.
He’s updated on everything that happened the day after returning to Earth. All of the Avengers that remain have gathered together, but next to that, there are also a couple of Mutants that must have been present for the battle, as well as Susan Storm and Reed Richards. Nebula and the Raccoon, Rocket have also joined, but those two are especially quiet.
With her face wet from tears and dirty from being thrown around, she looks up to him. She’s not even bothering to let out any power. It’s no use.
Tony glances back at Steve, who gives him a knowing look. Tony lets out a shaky breath, and then he leans to the side until he’s completely resting up against Steve, who wraps an arm around his shoulder and holds him close.
“It worked, Tony,” Steve repeats Clint’s words. Tony nods, knowing that his eyes are red from upcoming, happy tears.
“I’m scared to hope, again,” Tony admits. He feels Steve kiss him on the top of his head before he leans to the side to pick up his book again. Once they’re completely settled, Tony’s hand grabs Steve's and he starts playing with his fingers absentmindedly.
Of course she lives. Canon is not going to keep on taking Winterwidow away from me! They didn't even have the balls to give Sebastian Stan what he wanted, the cowards!
“Well, I’d substitute the word ‘encounter’ for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones,” Tony counters, thinking back of Loki’s staff being pressed against his Arc Reactor, which ultimately had been the thing that saved his life. There have also been a couple of close calls with the Tesseract, but he figures he’s made his point well enough.
When he turns, he sees Bucky’s form scattering. He’s disappearing, literally, turning into dust. Steve gasp in surprise, unable to place what’s happening. For a moment, he even thinks it’s a prank. Bucky drops his weapon and falls on the ground, only this time disappearing completely.
They take care of them surprisingly quickly, the two of them clearly taken by surprise at the strength coming from these three.
It’s obvious that Nebula never had a normal childhood. She never played games in her life before. She never even understood what a game stood for. With trouble, she admitted to having fun after that first session, and she’s been wanting to play more games after that.
He closes the door behind him and heads back downstairs, where Steve is busy reading a book on the couch. The lights are dimmed, though it’s illuminated well enough for him to read. Tony passes him with a playful grin.
“I wish I could say the same, but it’s been about ten minutes or so,” Peter returns, uncertainly. Tony laughs and squeezes even harder, but then eventually he pulls away to have another look at his kid.
Thor looks lost, confused. As if he, too, expected a sudden blow that would destroy them all. Except, nothing seems to have happened.
“You saved nothing,” Skinny returns, suddenly sounding annoyed. “Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.” Another large metal-looking thing – what is it, a container of some sort? – comes flying up behind Skinny.
“You’re right, it looks selfish, indeed,” Hilde mutters out, crossing her arms. She looks back at the bleached-haired girl who looks like she hates the idea of running just as much as Hilde. “What’s the deal here?”
It’s a good thing that Steve knows another incredibly talented genius somewhere. He breathes in relief before shaking his head. “I know someone. I’ll make the call,” he says. He takes out his phone and dials Bucky’s number. After all, he doesn’t really have T’Challa or Shuri on his speed dial.
Tony rolls his eyes. He’s dealt with Peter enough to know when to just stop. He puts a hand on Bruce’s shoulder and gently pushes him back.
“And… how are you?” Tony knows he must be bothered about it, but he finds Steve shrugging, eventually.
And Peter cries again. Morgan cuddles up to him, also sobbing before Happy suggests taking her from him. Peter hands her over, walking towards Steve where the Super Soldier is still holding on to the helmet.
Now, one would think that going on a holiday with Vision, the only person in their group that stands out the most, would practically make it impossible to have a normal holiday without having thousands of people following them around, but Wanda’s not stupid, and neither is Vision.
“You’ll never get this chance again,” the female returns in an equally murderous voice. After that, they disappear into a blue light. They don’t wait for too long, though. Instantly, the three of them walk up to Wanda and Vision, Natasha putting away her batons while Steve hanging shaking his hands nervously. Why wasn’t he using his shield? And what is that uniform? It looks only slightly like his original one, but… it looks old, withered. It must probably be an old one he had lying around in the jet. The suit Natasha’s wearing is also not the one she’s usually sporting, and Sam’s wings looked different as well.
He realizes that he’s been avoiding it; anything related to his son, he’s been trying not to think too much about it. Because Peter would always bring in him back hope, and upon the realization that there’s nothing to be done, he would always end up an even bigger wreck than before.
The entire room turns their head when Okoye’s beads let out an alarm. The warrior looks over some sort of holograph and her eyes widen.
But Thanos is ahead of her. Accessing her sister’s memory files, an old conversation she’s had with Nebula not too long ago plays out like a faded flashback. She and Nebula were about to part again after the whole Ego-business. For some reason, Gamora felt the need to share this piece of information. It had been a new thing she wanted to try; sharing secrets with her sister.
She had only been a child when she was taken by Thanos. By far not the first that was brought up there. The memory of her last day on her home planet is too vivid; she’s never returned ever since that day. She’s too ashamed to show herself there, again.
Jarvis looks so young here. His hair is still brown, his face still a bit on the pale side. His hair is longer, and he has those sideburns that Tony has never seen on him before. He gets out a muttered goodbye to his Father, and then Howard walks off to his own car.
Hilde wanders through the hallways for a little while. It seems like the general meeting is over and everybody is preparing to leave. The only voices she hears are those of Yaël and Steve, somewhere in the common room. She stops in her tracks and make sure she can’t be seen.
Tony is about to make a teasing comment at that, but he’s quickly interrupted by the 2012 version of the Hulk running by, smashing and breaking everything around him while he roars loudly. When they glance back at Bruce, the green man is hiding his face away behind his massive hand.
“Yes,” Loki says. “But the thing about this stone is that Thanos cannot sense this one, while he can sense the others. He has no idea it’s here, and we need to keep it that way.”
Steve nods. While he hasn’t had much contact with the Fantastic Four lately, it surely does feel like a blessing that they’re out there, right now. Still, their help here might have been a big help, as well.
Happy, Rhodey, Steve, May and Peter follow her back inside. Peter shakes some people’s hands when he passes them. He’s grateful that they came. His friends come to hug him tightly.
Pepper pulls him into a hug and Peter holds on to her, pressing his eyes against her shoulders as he starts sobbing. Pepper gently pats his back, kissing him on the side of the head.
And the room suddenly goes cold. Hilde knows that’s not just in her mind; the temperature has seriously dropped down a few degrees, all due to the girl Loki’s desperately holding on to. Her face is looking just as pale as Loki’s, her eyes full of horror, memories. That name means something to her that should probably scare them. The fact is, Hilde needs more than a name to be scared off. Even hearing Hela’s name didn’t bring fear into her. Sure, it pissed her off and it brought back a whole lot of memories she’d rather drink away, but nobody’s perfect, right?
“Gotcha,” he mutters out. He grabs a suitcase from underneath a stack of paper, and then forms his Iron Man gauntlet to burn through the enclosure. Once it opens up, he lets out a sigh of relief. “Back in the game.”
They all step back with a smile. Rocket looks up at Scott with a surprised look. “He’s pretty good at that,” he says. Scott nods in agreement.
But Peter loses his footing. He stumbles forward, right into Tony’s arms. “I don’t know what’s- I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t-“ he ends up with a sob, unable to finish his sentence. Peter is scared, and Tony doesn’t know what to do.
“People of Asgard,” a voice starts saying. “Rejoice, for you have been saved by Thanos and his children.”
“She needs to leave. We have to get her out of here,” Loki then says, suddenly sprinting back the way Hilde came from. He leaves her and Thor staring at him as his green cape moves with the air. By the time Hilde and Thor decide to follow him, he’s already out of the hallway.
“Excuse me?” he asks, horrified by the sudden intrusion, until he sees who exactly it is that stormed inside. “Oh, your majesty? Is there something the matter?”
In the past few years, there have been a few times he started tinkering on the armor again, but mostly he’s been putting his attention on Rescue, instead. He wasn’t really planning on being Iron Man, anymore, and the Rescue suit was mostly a joke. At least, that’s what he tells himself now. Back when he started working on it, all he wanted was for Pepper to have a way to protect herself.
It would be great to see Lady Sif again. It’s been a long time, though, and while it might just have been a couple of seconds for Sif, were she to come back, it’s still been five years for Hilde. Hilde, who’s been moving on from that failed relationship.
“Are there any other options with the Tesseract?” Nat eventually asks as she comes to stand next to Steve. A few locks of her hair have escaped her braid. She looks like she’s been in quite a fight as well. Except they stood victorious.
Thanos closes his eyes and reaches down until his hand is on the back of her head. She’s stroking her hair, as if he’s offering her comfort for her pain. “Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now… is no time at all.”
There’s excitement there. Natasha is the first one to stand up, immediately going to Tony to wrap her arms around him. Right after that, she directs her happiness towards Steve, who simply lifts her off the ground. Bruce slaps him on the back a couple of times, and the others congratulate them with an excited smile.
“Fine,” she eventually says. She knows there’s no way she’ll convince the woman otherwise. She heard from rumors that Hellvegeners are extremely stubborn, but since Yaël is half-Asgardian as well, it’s even worse. “We head to the wreckage, but we only stay for a couple of minutes. We can’t risk being found.”
“Flash Gordon? By the way, that’s a compliment,” he assures them. “Don’t forget, I’m half human. So that 50% of me that’s stupid?”
“Alright everybody, stay where you are. Chill the fuck out,” the man says, moving his blaster so that he can remove his helmet – and huh, this guy is human? “I’m gonna ask you this one time; Where’s Gamora?” Now the gun is no longer pointed at Peter, but at Tony, instead.
Tony hadn’t even noticed Peter stepping aside. His son is now behind him, which makes Tony turn around in horror, as he notices the panicked look on the kid’s face. He looks pale, beaten and tired.
“At least, let’s hope he’s not expecting it. So, I say we take the fight to him, Doctor. Do you concur?”
So Tony suits up as well. Once the biggest chunk of the battle is over, they make their way to the tower.
It’s going back and forth, neither really hitting the other. Steve thinks he’s made progress when the one he’s up against loses his staff, only to get a strong hand on his throat. Steve struggles to get out of his hold, feeling his breath getting strained for a bit.
That must mean that Wanda has left Vision’s side and decided it was time to help out on the field. It’s good for them, but it can only mean bad news for Shuri who is still working on a way to help Vision out.
“Tell me what you feel?” he suggests, lowering his arm while leaning into her touch. Wanda hesitates only for a short second before understanding that this is Vision telling her she allows him to do this. She takes a shaky breath before pulling her hand back.
“We… have blood to spare.” The woman holds up her sword, and the enemy’s army starts filling up while Steve, Nat and T’Challa return to the rest of their soldier. The first one to speak up is Bucky, who frowns at the growing army in front of him.
The past version of Steve does exactly what he did all those years ago and mentions that he’s heading downstairs to help out some more rather than sitting back for a moment like Natasha and Clint seem to be doing.
The lab looks mostly deserted on first glance, which is good for him when he finally spots the thing he’s looking for.
“We need to get the Hulk,” she whispers, clearly not intending to follow Loki’s orders, either. Hilde quickly nods, casting the crowd around them one last look before hurrying after Yaël. Standing in front of the door is Korg, who gives them one short nod before shielding the door away completely. Silently, Hilde opens it, and the two women get through.
“What are you doing?” she suddenly hears behind her. It’s a familiar, hoarse voice. One that seems to be permanently dry on this specific planet. She didn’t sound like this in space. It must be this specific atmosphere that alters her voice like this.
“Hello, Tony Stark,” the woman in space greets him. He can hear her through the ship. How is that possible? And how does she know his name? Is she an Angel? Is she here to collect his soul or something?
Despite the urgency of the situation, Peter seems to enjoy himself as he swings around the ship, entering hallway after hallway and coming up with many little gadgets that he found in some of the chambers. The way it usually goes is that he tries to show it, attempts to demonstrate how it works but then accidentally breaks it. Tony finds it too endearing to be annoyed; after all, Peter can use this distraction.
Not that she’s settled down. She’s not capable of settling down, that much she’s aware of. But she’s had her few adventures on her days off. Life would be boring without it.
“Pete, help! Get over here.” Peter lets go of his webs and jumps to Tony. Without needing instruction, he grabs onto the gauntlet. “She can’t hold him much longer, so let’s go.”
Tony gives him a playful glance as he moves to close down the trunk. “Thank God I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it this night. A fully functioning Time-Space GPS.” Tony holds up the device he’s been tinkering on the entire night. Steve knew he’d been busy, so he’s not that surprised.
“Ah, yes, we can’t leave the King behind,” Korg agrees. There’s something heavy in his voice Hilde notices immediately.
“If you want to offer yourself up that badly, you do it after that kid is born!” Hilde points at the swollen belly right in front of her face. “I might call you my friend at this moment, but I know my mission. The mission comes first.”
Gamora’s vision blurs for a little while. The woman hovering over her keeps on talking, screaming for help, but there’s nobody coming. The woman in the silver suit is still knocked out. Loki and Yaël are stuck with their newborn.
It goes back and forth for a bit. The male one chasing after Vision, the female one attacking Wanda. She likes to think she’s holding her ground pretty well, but she’s very much aware of the fact that Vision can’t go on like this for much longer.
Having all the stones on his hand clearly seems to affect Tony. His entire arm is glowing multiple colors, all coming from the stones. His armor is struggling to stay intact. With difficulty, Tony manages to open his mouth. This time, Peter can hear what he’s saying.
As Tony tries to walk away from the group just to get a bit of peace of mind, the others hurry back after him. Especially Quill who doesn’t seem to want to keep his mouth shut.
In the background, he can see Wanda standing up against that familiar, purple giant. Peter was aware of her great power, but seeing the guy struggling against her makes him realize once more just how much power she possesses. It’s kind of great. She’s kind of great!
And so, you see, Tony had come to the obvious conclusion that every time he had something good within his reach, it would be ripped away from him, like a child whose parents decided he was in fact
“Steve.” Tony’s voice, gentle but firm. Something warm presses against his ear, then again at his neck, his forehead, over his shut lids. Tony.
and through Sharon, they won’t be able to trace back to Tony, and hence will not trace back to him. No one will ever know Steve’s behind everything. God, he suddenly feels exhausted.
Hologram Tony huffs. “But if I’m right, and I’m 99.997% sure I am, then listen up, Cap, because this is the only time you’re going to hear this message.”
carrying a backpack with 3 days’ worth of clothes, having expected to meet some form of obstacle. When you’re used to obstacles, things feel too good to be true when they run smooth, like now.
“Cap?” Tony’s touch startles him out of his panic, and Steve realises his breathing is uneven. Why is Steve panicking when Tony is the one that needs his help? He feels himself being gently pushed onto the same stool Tony had been sitting on just seconds before. “Hey, pal. You need to breathe.”
Tony turns to look at him with those honey chocolate eyes, “Yeah. You’re here with me now, aren’t you?” And he is just so beautiful no invasion could’ve stopped Steve from leaning in for a kiss right then.
Steve’s going home, and isn’t it strange, how he has so many places and people he associates with that single word now? His turning point in life more than a century ago might have been due to Howard Stark, but his second life begun with one genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. One who will also be known as a loving friend, father, husband.
"God, Tony!" Her hands, when she leaned away and closed them around his arm in an icy grip, were trembling. Tony decided then that fear was an absolute mismatch for Pepper. She should always be frowning and looking at him disapprovingly, with the occasional exasperated yet fond smile.
At this point in time, Steve doesn’t ponder over it. He just needs to take action, because he’s lived long enough to learn that sometimes that moment of hesitation costs
"Widow overheard Fury and a HYDRA agent converse within SHIELD compounds, and saw first-hand the transformation from Fury to Skrull," Steve was saying. Tony’s head was already coming up with countless impossibilities, like how many Skrulls did he meet without realising? Tony
“Project Extremis. Right. That sounds familiar. J, keep a note on that, will you? Send that along with the rest.”
“One hell of a date night,” Tony’s lips curl into a wry smile, and leans into Pepper for a not quite hug. The imperfect image just makes Steve see how they fit each other so well together. Pepper is everything Tony needs to keep him grounded; how can he take that from him? Then the sleep deprived gaze is turned to him, “Cap, you in a rush? Might wanna stay over tonight.”
Then hologram Tony disappears. An automated voice that of FRIDAY rings out, “Message self-destructing in five seconds... Four... Three... Two... One...”
Things that remind him of their Avengers days sit in one corner, on top of a dresser. The arc reactor he had on his chest when he… died, his helmet. His sunglasses - Steve can almost picture his smirk. The last outfit he wore before battle. Steve’s legs feel weak, but he manages to place his hand against the cold helmet.
There are rooms for everyone in case they ever need a place to stay, even him. Even Bucky. He tries not to think about Natasha’s room. Or Tony’s, for that matter.
"A force field is protecting him. We need to get past it, and destroy the scepter. Only then will the portal close and the army be shut down."
“That was a distress call from SHIELD. I have no idea what’s going on, but they need every available agent in New York City immediately.”
Back then, Steve might’ve frowned. Might’ve thought they shouldn’t be advertised like this. Now, he just sees them as happier times. He wonders how the team felt when they saw this. How they feel
The news of Obadiah Stane’s death had barely been on the news for three days before aliens started appearing from the sky, because apparently that was the new norm now. Tony had just returned from the unavoidable press conference, trying to pour himself a drink because that’s what you did when you found out your father figure was an even bigger asshole than your biological father.
“What?” That’s just ridiculous, and Steve pulls Tony into a super hug. He’s gotten better at those, hugs that make them both feel warm and content that don’t actually hurt anyone. “No! I mean, yes! I mean-- I
Changing into the outfit and packing his basic necessities into a backpack, Steve shoots a long text to Sharon, so long it’s split into two parts, because that’s what old phones do. The first half, he asks for a favor, and to quote exactly:
Morgan arrives then, alone, looking so much like the little girl from when she first joined the family, Steve can’t believe he thought he’d be able to leave without seeing her one last time. They embrace, Morgan sobbing, Steve holding her.
Then, immediately after, he shoots out the second half… Asking for access to her motorcycle which she’s left in the garage. Steve’s been saving up for one, but he’d underestimated the consequences of inflation (also, his job may have been underpaying him. A lot. But he might keep the relaxing coffee job.) and am still some thousands away from the bike he’s been eyeing. Things were so much easier when they came from SHIELD.
When Steve just stares dumbly, “Or not. I forgot you’re a big boy. It’s just dark, and y’know, someone may be out there watching.”
triggers his muscles, making him twitch involuntarily, demanding his full attention. And he sees what he never wanted to look at back then- the him all those years ago. The way people praised them, thanking them, others denying their existence. He sees little kids dressed as them, posing as Avengers like they are their heroes. And Steve sees, they
Steve ducks when Tony flies past him, but he wouldn’t have noticed either way - he’s flying faster than he usually does, even in battle. Steve rips the earpiece from his 2012 self before tossing him in a car, and plugs it into his ear just in time to hear Natasha:
He’d promised Pepper, Rhodey and Happy he wouldn’t let his emotions cloud his judgement, and now was a very good time to follow up on that.
sound like the old snake. So, care to share what SHIELD is going to do with the information I am able to provide? Assemble the Avengers?”
, to hear the delight from the praise. A reminder that this was Steve’s life, one he’d hidden from Tony…
You see, the thing was, Tony was sure the universe was against him. Now that he knew there existed those of higher beings (come on, the Avengers consisted of a literal
“Actually, it’s Fury who asked me to come. Can you let me in? There’s some classified information he asked me to share with you. Privately.”
“Go in that direction,” he points where he knows Sharon will be. “Authorities will lead you to safety, okay? Get them safe,” Steve adds to the man who nods and basically carry both kids in his arms and runs in the pointed direction. If only everybody listened as well as him in dire situations like this.
His eyes fall to Tony’s cufflinks, and he breaks into an almost laugh through his blurring vision. Tony smirks when he sees what Steve’s noticed - the dick shaped cufflinks Tony’d
sat alone in his workshop, drank his smoothie, swapped out his arc reactor, and sat his ass down on his favorite stool, asking JARVIS to pull out all the data he’d collected the past few hours. They were categorised in order of their timestamp, Tony skimming through subjects of interests. And he’d paused just short of tapping into the files which contained classified information of the Avengers. Things he (anyone) would want to know, even when he’d gone head first into the mess.
As Steve has an internal debate with himself, he finds himself parking the jet on a high roof, and standing at the entrance of Peggy Carter’s doorstep in Washington, DC with the briefcase in hand. Yeah, he definitely memorised her phone number
Two shots, two agents down. Steve doesn’t kill them - they’re just under mind control, and really, he’s not back to kill even more people. He’s aimed for their tendons and hit his mark. Those five years after the snap and before the time heist? Steve hasn’t exactly been moping around and telling people to move on every day. He’s a soldier, with or without his shield, and he’s trained with the best they have (had, really, but let’s not go there right now) in firearm.
There is an outstretched arm and an open palm, silently asking for the flash drive. “Sir?” JARVIS sounds as though he is in awe. Over what, Steve will likely never be able to guess. Instead, he drops the flash drive on Tony’s waiting palm, watches as he wrinkles his nose, praying nothing will give away the fact that this is all just
!) and a hammer in his hands. Tony stared as he sat up from a dent he’d made in the alien ship with a groan, looking to be without so much as a scratch. When their eyes met, the literal glow of the man’s - alien’s - eyes had Tony readying his repulsors. He wasn’t even sure they’d work on him, but God forbid him from trying.
“Really, Carter? A lesser man might say you need to get a life.” They share a good-natured laugh, but Steve’s blood runs cold.
Said man was surrounded before he knew what was happening, gentle but worrying hands guiding him back indoors, murmurs of
please keep kudos and comments coming, they're fuel to my fingers to keep me writing and writing and writing!
he’d wear. Steve’s own cufflinks are relatively PG; it’s a palette, because art has been the one consistency in his life. And even now, his heart warms that Tony understands.
and yes, the scene after phil's death? steve used "tony". it's, i believe, the only time steve uses his first name in the film. totally jumped on that
"Yeah, boss, JARVIS contacting both Rhodey and Pepper and me is definitely no big deal," Happy deadpanned, and he had a point. Happy’s emergency contact was programmed to be used only under
Tony’s eyes wander and land on something. Coulson’s blood stains, Steve realises. “He made it personal.”
living way off the grid, but it’s not like nobody knows where they are. Steve decides to never step into a city again after year 2023, after the day he had fought Thanos in his own timeline. It’s one thing to return to the past, and another completely to see a future he has no rights to. What it’s like in the future isn’t knowledge he wants to bring back to his time. After all, the only reason he’s returned (and now decided to
"Oh..." There were some rustling, clatter from a plate, a beep from the microwave, and then the man joined him in the living room. Again, refusing to look at him.
"Upstairs... you mean they are with Lo... OW!" The archer rubbed his head. Due to his wife hitting him again as his tone grew hostile.
Lila and Cooper was watching the kid with curiosity. He was younger than them. With glossy black hair and beautiful green eyes. Since he had been at the playground she decided to take him there first. Offering her hand he took it hesitant. With all three kids in tow she walked the short distance.
Tony whistled. That was quite some drug alright. "How are you affected? Do you have to breathe it in? Ingest it?"
"Besides, I did give you permission to bury Barton in snow if he was being mean to you. But why didn't you tell us where you were going?"
Eventually both of them crested the line and orgasmed together. In a tangle of limbs they held each other. The engineer breathed in the scent of the other man. Because he it could and it was right in front of him, he licked a muscle. Tasting the salt. Then he did again. And again. Feeling almost addicted. He stopped when there was a chuckle.
For some reason Uncle Bruce seemed oddly flustered seeing the boy sitting by the table, stuffing his face with pancakes, cream, and berries. Loki was too focused on his food to care. Not aware of the mess he made of himself and his surroundings.
Life with a toddler was very different from what he was used to. There were crying, tantrums, and messes to clean up. Both of them fairly quickly figured out that "Nej" meant "No" because it was Loki's favourite word. In addition, the small boy had magic that would occasionally flair up. Even so, Steve found him quite charmed by the tiny Trickster. Amidst all the chaos he brought, there was also a lot of smiles and giggles. And an endless curiosity.
"Well... it was far less coherent, I give you that. But it is the gist of it. He has no idea who I am, either", Thor looked at the two. "However, he did refer to the two of you as his fathers. Both of you."
Tony looked at him for a moment and then dove into his arms. "Gods, I love you", he said, voice muffled against the soldier's sweater. "I don't know how I ever functioned without you."
Leaving his grieving mother Thor walked back to his brother's chambers. Intending to finish tidying it while sorting through his thoughts. Frigga didn't believe there were any chance that Loki could have been given rebirth. And to her knowledge, that was certainly true. Yet...
"I know. And you were right. I'm going to research some Norse Mythology, there might be some information of Loki's race in there."
"Loki..." he wanted to cry. Especially when his son began to cry as the reality of things finally seemed to have seeped in. Steve was fine. He would spend some time in Washington, do some missions, and then he would come home to them. Heck, maybe he would even find a new friend. Pepper could use an alternative for babysitting too.
"Why not? He was hungry and asked for food. Easy peasy. If you were so unsure, you could have gotten him a banana or something."
Thor made his way down to the common floor. There were no food on his and he needed breakfast. What he didn't expect was seeing Barton being pelted with pellets of ice. By Loki.
"Whatever. He and Cap have lost their marbles! This is Loki we are talking about. The invader of New York! The Prince of Lies. He is obviously lying, pretending, to garner their... I don't know, anything."
After tidying up Loki's chambers Thor had just sat down. There had been a sense of despair in how things were flung about. Pain. His brother's days as king of Asgard. Struggling to keep everything together. Though he had lied to the Thunderer, had it really been malicious? Or had it been fear?
Stretching Tony walked down the stairs from the landing pad above, Steve behind him. The area for the planned compound was promising and construction was already underway. Sitting down for a long time hadn't been great though.
"He often comes to us for that reason. We let him. It helps him sleep better and we get to sleep as well."
After having been given some juice and some animal crackers the boy calmed down significantly. Sniffing occasionally.
Really, the past didn't matter. He loved that boy in a way he had never loved before. Losing Steve would be devastating, but losing Loki would break him completely.
Watching Loki could be a handful on its own. Adding two more kids made it into a complete circus. Bucky watched as the older two kids went crazy, seeing the penthouse. Running around while shrieking excitedly. His super soldier hearing didn't quite agree with their loud voices.
Well... they were going to be found out sooner or later. At least this guy seemed like he would be willing to listen.
Tapping away on his tablet Tony waited for his husband to finish putting their son to bed. He no longer woke up as often in the night and even if he did, he was comfortable enough to go back to sleep on his own. A few times a week they took him to something called open preschool. Parents and their kids gathered. Allowing the children to play with each other while the adults talked. Sometimes there were activities as well.
"I can take it", Steve offered as he was cleaning the table. "He doesn't usually makes this kind of mess, but it can happen."
"Very funny. I don't regret either of them. Wouldn't surprise me if Pepper is already on it. She is good at this kind of stuff."
"They love him", Bruce said calmly. "Steve and Tony, they love him. Think of him as their son. If you had a child you loved a lot, how would you react if someone destroyed their things to punish them. Or threaten to throw them off the Tower?"
Barnes smiled widely and stood, picking the boy up. "Uncle Bucky to the rescue!" He said and went in the direction shown.
"My son was crying! Not once since we found him has he cried like that! Not once! Not even when he was missing Steve! You did that. To a child!"
"I'm not sure", the gatekeeper said. "For a long time now, the dwelling of your mortal comrades has been hidden from my eyes. I can tell they are there, but not what they are doing."
The breakfast had been a success. Pepper had watched fondly as Loki munched on his food. Eating way more than she had known he could. Barnes on the other hand were unfazed. Drinking his coffee calmly.
"Thanks, Lo. Ahh! Nom nom." Their son giggled as Tony ate the offered blueberry in an exaggerated manner. "Now in your mouth."
There was a chuckle against his throat. His husband placed kissed along his jaw before their lips met. Their tongues intermingled a bit. Slow and heavy. Then his neck was getting attention again. Tony didn't mind, it felt good after all.
By the table, the small Trickster was screaming and crying. Calling for his parents. The situation was not helped by the fact that Thor was yelling at him while still trying to force the rejected food on the child. Just as the two intended to intervene, the elevator doors opened.
"Huh...uh...yes?" Warm hands touched his body, slowly roaming his torso. But only on top of his clothes. More kisses were placed on his lips and the engineer was definitely starting to throw all caution out the window. Whatever this was, he wanted more of it. Answering the kisses and holding on to the super soldier he was heating up.
"Sure, we can talk about it another time. You know, I was wondering why you was allowed inside. This explains it."
Yawning Steve went to make himself some breakfast. He didn't use his kitchen all that often, preferring to eat with others around him. But last evening he had spent quite some time in the penthouse. Making him a bit sleepy this morning. His boyfriend had also decided to give him a hickey. Granted, it was well hidden but he still felt conscious about it.
Thor looked at them with some confusion, not seeming to grasp what they were saying. As such, he decided it didn't matter.
"You two are adorable", Tony laughed. "Better make him something more substantial for lunch. This will not last him long."
"Yeah, I heard Thor. Telling us his own brother had been beheaded while being judged by his own father! Acting like Loki not knowing his true race was acceptable and that he should have lived his whole life in a lie!" Tony grabbed the front of Clint's shirt and pulled the man to his feet. His team, sans Steve, tended to assume that his suit did everything in a fight. Not realising that years of building and working out had given him a decent amount of muscle.
"I'm sorry for not contacting you before bringing him here", his boyfriend said. So, a boy then. "And I know this sounds crazy but... I think this is Loki."
"It does, doesn't it. That is why this spell is so difficult to cast, and why its chance of success is so small."
"Thor mentioned something about Loki being adopted, didn't he? Maybe this is what he meant? That Loki is from a different race?"
"They got lucky, I tell you that. They managed to get a picture of our smooch last night. There is no way this will not blow up."
It wasn't much of a fight. Most of it consisted of trying to gather up the large gas canisters before they caused any damage. The soldier was trying to keep one if the robbers away from him while avoiding hurting him too much. Which wasn't easy because the guy was swinging a canister wildly in front of him. Just as the blond was making his move the man opened the valve on the tube. It started spewing out gas while spun from the pressure. As soon as he realised Steve held his breath for as long as possible while getting away from the white looking mist.
A group of three men were sitting in the penthouse, watching a single child. If it wasn't for the fact that the child was Loki, Thor would have thought it overkill. Stark and Rogers had recruited them for babysitting as they would spend the night away. The small Trickster was playing with his toys. Something he had an abundance off.
So, perhaps it wasn't surprising that he had found himself drawn to a new person. A different person. It was just a slightly unexpected person, considering how their initial meeting went. But there was no denying that Tony Stark was intelligent, confident, and just the right amount of mischievous to stir something in Steve. He was also quite handsome, in a rugged sort of way. Not that the blond would even dream of making a move on the man. Some research had taught him same-sex relationships were no longer illegal, but that didn't mean Mr. Playboy billionaire had any kind of interest in men.
Drawing his palm across his face the god of thunder felt powerless. Far more than he had as a mortal. On Midgard was a god of mischief that was both the same as his brother and completely different. With all likelihood, the Trickster had succeeded in casting the spell. And when he was beheaded, it had activated.
Tony suddenly looked as he had an epiphany. "That's it!" He shouted, making Loki look at him curiously. "Don't worry, Lo. Daddy and Papa are just talking." Nodding the boy returned to his cartoon. "He understands us through All-Speak, but he doesn't connect yet that we don't understand him the same way. That's why he doesn't seem to learn, he doesn't hear a difference."
A light kick to his stomach made the engineer wake up. His son had some pretty funny sleeping postures sometimes. Even if it meant he accidentally kicked or punched his parents in his sleep. Yawning Tony looked at the alarm clock. 6 a.m. Way too early. Not even Steve was up yet, and he liked to exercise early in the morning.
He felt like he had gravel in his eyes. Dragging himself up from the bed Bucky headed out of his room. Loki had fetched him and Sam several times during the night, wanting them to stay with him. Once the boy had fallen asleep they returned to their own beds. Only to be woken a few hours later by a teary-eyed mini god.
The drug could be absorbed through the skin. Steve had effectively been drugged. How did that affect what had happened the night before? How consensual could it be? That was why Tony had to talk with Bruce. To get to know the truth.
I, of course, am happy about being appreciated. But it can be a bit of a mental load to write so much. That's actually why I sometimes skip days when I update. I write these stories and upload as I go. When I'm too drained, I can't think enough to write more.
Steve and Tony exchanged a quick look. Barton let out a happy whoop, only to be smacked by Romanoff. Banner had a complicated expression on his face.
The boy was azure blue, looking unhappy and angry while throwing small pebbles of frozen water at the archer. More surprising was the fact that no one was trying to help the man.
The engineer snorted wetly. "Yeah, that's a doozy, for sure. But I don't have any issue with that. It means I get that much more time with you and Loki."
"I could teach him", Thor said. Thinking it was a chance to form a relationship with his brother again.
"Because I don't. The circumstances are a bit special but our son is Loki, the god of mischief. Formerly Thor's brother. He has returned to being a kid. No memory of his old life."
Walking the halls of the Palace he found himself in front of his brother's chambers. No one had been inside since the Trickster's supposed suicide. Opening the double doors the Thunderer went inside. There were no dust, likely due to a spell. But it wasn't as tidy as he was accustomed to. Books thrown everywhere. Clothes flung across the room. Items that had been broken.
"Come on, you too!" He gave her a surprised and confused look. She huffed and waved her hand. "Come on now, time to go." Still not understanding what was happening the boy found himself herded alongside several other children. Away from the playground. Looking around he tried to see his parents but the adults just ushered him forward when he did that.
"Didn't he mention something called All-Speak? A spell or something that all Asgardians are blessed with. It allows them to understand any spoken language and be understood in any spoken language."
His mother rarely left her chambers these days. When  she did she would break down in tears. Cursing everyone and everything. Still, Thor knew she would be the one with answers. Knocking on her door he waited for permission before entering.
"No way!" The engineer gave him a wet kiss. "Though I admit I don't think I can take another round."
No... calm... no need to go nuclear. Leaning against the wall the engineer tried to still his thoughts. His son had never been in danger, JARVIS was always...
"...I never dated a man. Or a woman, to be honest. Peggy was the closest I got. But there were times when I... was drawn... to other men. Bucky was the only one who knew and he didn't care beyond teasing me. It was illegal to be with other men and I didn't have it in me to try anyway."
It was peaceful and getting out of the Tower had been the right idea. Just spending time as a family and letting their kid make some friends. Albeit temporary ones. Tony opened an attachment to one email. Frowning as he watched the linked video. What kind of person could stop a car going full speed? Unless it was a stunt but it didn't look like it... He looked up for a second, then paused, looked again and...
Biting his lips the scientist knew it wasn't any of his business but at the same time, they were his friends. "If you don't mind me asking... how is your marriage? Is everything okay?"
"They are books on magic, Loki was always a natural born sorcerer but last time he had our mother to teach him. I thought they could help him learn how to use his powers."
No wonder the god of mischief had spiralled. With all this staring in his face after he had discovered his true race. Idly the Thunderer wondered if Stark and Rogers were aware that their ward could turn blue. And how they would react when they found out.
"Good", the engineer said and slowly placed their son back on the floor. Though the boy hid behind him.
"Did you wake up and thought you were all alone?" The tiny god nodded. Sitting down on the bed the soldier petted the black locks. It was always strange, remembering that even the worst person had once been a small child. Helpless and dependent on those around. "Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?" Another nod. "Alright. Let me tell you a story..."
"Jag tvätta händerna, Papa", he said. Most of it was incomprehensible to the former soldier but he recognised one word. And stared as the boy ran up to Steve, showing his hands.
He could care less that apparently he and Steve would live for many centuries to come. Welcomed it, even. But hearing how utterly miserable adult Loki had been, how horribly he had been treated. That made his blood boil. Their son could have been happy and carefree in his first chance at life, if just someone had cared enough to give him that. Instead, he had been treated so poorly, feeling so shitty, that a supposed impossible spell had worked.
Big, green eyes stared at him in wonder. "Papa och Daddy är superhjältar!" Loki threw his arms around Steve in an enthusiastic hug, giggling. Returning the hug he was relieved to see that his son was in a better mood.
Twenty minutes later he returned to his own shared bedroom. Tony was naked and was still awake. Giving him a seductive grin. "Come on, soldier, I'm not sleeping until I had some."
"Easy..." Steve placed a hand on the engineer's shoulder. "I feel the same way but raging about it won't help. I'm sure Loki will be able to find good and reliable friends in time. Until then we just have to make certain he never feels lonely."
Sam chuckled, shaking his head. Obviously amused. "You are quite the trio", he said while grinning. "It is cute. Two Papa bears protecting their cub. He is very lucky to have you."
"Yeah, no. You will teach JARVIS who can then translate it for him. Just getting it into our letters should be enough."
And now, that very same toy was broken. Its head separated from its body. For all his mischief, the tiny Trickster was actually rather careful with his toys and took care to not damage them. So it was very unlikely he was responsible for the state of the action figure.
"Oh, buddy..." Steve said and consoled the crying toddler. Leaving their son to his husband Tony looked over the toy.
"It's complicated", Tony deflected and placed the tiny Trickster on his lap. "And this is not the place to talk about it."
"Papa", the tiny Trickster mumbled and snuggled closer. "Daddy." Both men smiled at him. The engineer placed his head on the soldier's shoulder.
"What does it matter?" the blond snatched the sketchbook and closed it. This was his secret. His dirty little secret. Of course, his friend already knew.
Nodding the engineer thought about their dilemma. If Rock of Ages did this to himself, that raised a bunch of questions. If someone else did it to him, it also raised questions. Either way, until they knew for sure what was going on, the kid was innocent.
"That's the thing, we don't know anything about this guy. He could potentially cause trouble or put himself in danger or something."
"He isn't lying", the scientist said. Making the spies look at him. "I did an examination. Everything was a clear indication that Loki is indeed a child now. Hormone levels, growth pattern, reflexes. All of it is consistent with children around the age three and four."
"Hey! This is just temporary", Tony said. Even though he also wanted to cry. "If it takes too long I will just hack SHIELD and make certain you come home."
Chuckling Steve took off his clothes and joined his boyfriend in bed. Reaching down with his fingers. Only to be stopped by the engineer. "I need to prepare you."
"What do you think I've been doing the last twenty minutes? Rolled my thumbs? Don't keep me waiting, Rogers. Just go for it."
Bowing Thor headed out to the Bifrost. Choosing to walk rather than using Mjolnir or a horse. There he approached Heimdall.
As they climaxed he could swear he heard Steve murmur something in his ear. It sounded very much like he said "I love you", but that couldn't be it. Right? Not that he had much time to think, considering his orgasm completely knocked him out.
Sighing Tony gave up on any coffee in the penthouse and decided to head to the common floor. His husband and son was still asleep so he didn't wake them.
"Alright, Mischief. I think he has learned his lesson", Stark said and lifted the boy into his arms. "Right, Bird Brain?"
Thor looked confused while thinking hard. Then he seemed to realise what the engineer was referring to, making an aghast face.
Thor couldn't help but watch the trio. Both Stark and Rogers sat with Loki, one on each side. Whenever the Trickster said anything they would smile and reply. Often guessing correctly what the boy wanted.
"Oh, Loki." Both men hugged the boy. Letting him just soak in their love for a little bit. "We don't mind if you want to talk to us. If we are in the middle of saying something, it is good to wait..."
The door closed behind Wilson and Loki. JARVIS activated the blockers and Tony pulled the vacated chair closer to the bed. Sitting down.
But every comment I get spurs me to keep writing. So thank you all who likes and comments on my stories.
"Babe, you've become even bigger in the last few months. You bet I'm going to take advantage of that. Strong, handsome, gentle. What's there not to love? And it is not like someone else should be touching you. Not like this."
Steve looked unhappy and pulled Tony in for a hug. "That would make you sound like a horrible person..." he said. "They would think badly of you..."
The painting naturally was given space on the refrigerator. Tony had given their son so many complements it had been a bit silly. Though Steve admitted the smile had been worth it. Children should be praised, after all.
"Well, we would be. I'm Tony Stark and this is my husband, Steve Rogers. We haven't exactly kept it a secret."
"Papa! Daddy!" The tears this time was obviously more out of relief and a release of tension. One thing was clear though. They needed to set very strong boundaries with the others. Especially the spies and Thor.
"Meaning we are both doing a great job of raising our son." The soldier kissed his neck again. This time he kept going, arms sneaking underneath the engineer's shirt. One hand went down his pyjama bottoms and briefs.
"What kind of questions was he asked?" The soldier asked. To someone who didn't know him, he seemed calm. Unaffected. But Tony knew his husband. Steve was tense, upset. Likely thinking about the small boy sleeping upstairs.
Tony saw red and punched the man. Sending him flying. He followed, grabbed the shirt and punched him again.
The boy thought about it for a few moments. Pizza was only allowed for dinner and it wasn't dinner yet. He had been shown the numbers for that. Jarvis knew that as well. But Jarvis wasn't as strict about food as his dads. Because Jarvis couldn't eat.
The engineer felt a block of ice in his stomach. So, no accident. Murder. Taking a deep breath he looked at his husband. At the injuries. There wasn't many who could cause that much damage to a super soldier.
Asgard was quiet without his brother. It had been the same during the awful year he had been believed dead. Except, now he was dead. Beheaded. Gone. Forever.
"I feel the same way", his husband kissed him. Soothingly and full of love. Kisses could really convey so many things if you wanted them to. "I'm really grateful to have you both in my life."
No, he doubted Stark and Rogers thought kindly of Asgard. If his mother was right, and she usually was, they had gained
Whistling the engineer was in the middle of some simple programming when suddenly Pepper walked out of the elevator. On his feet in seconds Tony fumbled with his device and wasn't sure what to say.
The next time he woke up, it was morning. They were no longer cuddling. Sprawled across the bed with his head in the pillow the soldier was still asleep. Snorting the billionaire got up, took a shower, and poured himself some coffee while getting a glass of water for the other.
He had moved into a corner, away from the talking. Everything had happened so quickly that he couldn't keep up. Bucky was alive. That in and off itself was making him reel. Sighing Steve really wished he could talk to Tony. Unfortunately, that was no longer possible. He had kept the device in its two parts but one half had been destroyed.
Loki's bedroom had been furnished with toddler sized furniture and a colourful decor. He had also been given a good amount of different toys. The bed was a normal singles bed with a cushioned frame and a thin canopy. Tiny lights was attached to the fabric.
"Causing trouble? Thor, Barnes is having fun. After everything he has been through, this is more or less like therapy for him. Loki is actually quite considerate of others. Something has definitely picked up from Steve."
"Loki?" He said in disbelief. The child was grabbing his pants leg but hadn't been looking at him. At the name, those green eyes turned to him. Could it really be..?
Furrowing his brow the god of thunder spoke, but in a different language. One that sounded a lot like Loki's usual babbling. The tiny god perked up and said something as well. For a few minutes the two deities talked. All while the Thunderer looked more and more troubled.
"I will survive", the engineer said dryly. "My reputation isn't all that good already so it isn't a stretch. It is our best bet right now."
Smiling a bit too sharp, Stark waved Steve onto the stage. The soldier wasn't wearing his uniform. "First off, yes I and
Feeling a headache coming he decided to just accept it at face value. There was too much otherwise. "You said you could explain?"
"Our dad is also a hero", Lila said. "Mommy says so. That he is away a lot because he is keeping the world safe. But I wish he was home more..."
"Why not?" Rogers said. "He is a very bright child. Even when he didn't speak English, we managed to figure out what he wanted most of the time. You have two languages available for talking to him."
While the world was abuzz with the news of Iron Man and Captain America being married, the two men themselves didn't pay it any attention. At all. Unless someone said something about their kid.
"I certainly thought about it, from time to time", she admitted. "But the only one I can imagine having a child with is Tony. And we are way passed that."
"Don't think too hard about it. I know you are still adjusting but once the renovation of Steve's former floor is finished, you are welcome to use it."
"You realise we can't tell the others, right?" He said, making his boyfriend frown. "Think about it. Who in the Avengers would completely refuse to believe this isn't a trick? Maybe doing something bad?"
"The very same. He were also Thor's brother through adoption. We found him several months ago and is keeping his identity under wraps."
By mutual agreement, they didn't tell anyone else yet. For one thing, it was still so new and they had no idea how things would pan out. Another reason was because some of them could get nosy. Especially Natasha who had tried to get Steve a date.
"Take one of both then, if he doesn't like the one with pineapple, I can eat it. Sounds pretty tasty."
He managed to find five books in total penned by his brother, and he also managed to find a book for novice sorcerers. It wasn't much and he didn't really understand any of it but there wasn't much else. Putting the books in a satchel he headed towards the Bifrost. Another group was heading to Vanaheim so he waited.
"You know this is a spell surrounding rebirth, yes? In order for the spell to activate, your death have to be injust and unwarranted. You can't kill yourself or do an act that results in your death. Meaning it has to be completely out of your hands and unjustifiable. Even then, there is no guarantee the spell will actually do anything."
Just as a note, I'm basically using Swedish baby talk for Loki. So when talks, he is actually saying something. I'm not translating to make it the same for you guys as it is for Steve and Tony.
Hawkeye? These were Barton's kids? No wonder Tony had looked like a cat that had caught the rat. Well, at least Loki would have it a bit easier from now on.
Letting go of the tablet, Tony leaned back. Surrendering himself to his husband's gentle yet intent touch. Moaning and gasping.
Yet on Midgard, Loki was once more a child. Found by some of the best people the Realm had to offer. Two people who not only lived each other, but also him. Unconditionally. They had also surrounded themselves with people who also cared. Who was willing to protect the boy. And he was raised into a happier person because of it.
Soon enough the news ended, turning off the TV Tony closed his eyes. Leaning against the soldier, soaking in his warmth. He jumped when small hands suddenly touched him.
He was becoming spoiled. With jobs for the Avengers drying up, Tony had been able to glue himself to Steve. Who let him. Yup. Definitely spoiled. Which was why he wasn't whining when his boyfriend choose to go out jogging for a few hours.
It was definitely one of the easiest patients he had ever had. Loki sat happily on the medbay bed while Bruce looked him over. Staring at everything around him while babbling.
"That's okay. I'm just so happy to be with you again. Going on a date like this was a great idea." Holding the other close the soldier settled. They had gone to a pretty high end hotel that boasted about its discretion regarding its guests. The room was large and comfortable. There they had eaten a three course dinner and even danced a bit before undressing.
"He has missed you a lot", Tony said, joining them. Getting back on his feet the blond felt his chest lighten. Touching his husband's cheek he kissed him gently. "So have I, by the way."
The raised voices. Thor coming closer, looming. Angry looks and impatience. It was just too much for the small boy.
Moaning the engineer had closed his eyes, just feeling. It was slow and intense. His husband kissed and licked his neck while thrusting slowly. Leisurely. Neither wanting to rush this. Once upon a time, Tony would never have been able to do this. Give himself over so completely to another man. But with Steve, he felt safe. Trusted him more than he had ever trusted anyone.
The first problem he encountered was that he was just way too short. That was solved by moving a chair and climbing it. Next problem came when he opened the cabinets. There were boxes and containers but he had no idea what they contained. Aunt Pepper had been teaching him but he still couldn't read on his own.
"Daddy..." he cried and made a beeline for Tony. Who picked him up, trying to sooth him. This was the first time the other three saw him. Despite the fact that he had arrived months ago.
"Daddy and Papa are superheroes", Loki said proudly. "Daddy is Iron Man and Papa is Captain America."
Still sniffing while having a grip on Rogers' shirt, the boy reached out and grabbed a grain ring. Putting it in his mouth. Stark was still fussing about, placing berries on a plate. Blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. Giving it to Loki. He also poured a glass of some white drink.
He hadn't told his mother about the grave, she still grieved her youngest severely. Blaming Odin, blaming Thor. Screaming at them for letting Loki's remains be thrown away like garbage. It would probably do her no good to see the empty memorial. Returning to the palace the Thunderer sought out his father.
Suddenly the Tower shook. Moments later, Thor made his entrance. Exuberant and loud, as usual. "Friends!" He said loudly, holding out his arms as if he was hugging all of them. "It is good to... Loki?"
"I ran into him in Central Park", Steve filled in. "He was alone, naked, and filthy. So, I took him here."
"Ugh... can't Stark keep the brat under control?" It was the mean man, giving Loki a very unfriendly look. That man had broken one of the boy's toys, a crime that would not be forgotten anytime soon. Daddy had said he could get revenge if the man was being mean towards him again.
"Neither did you at four", Tony remarked. "Alright, Lo. Be nice to your aunt and uncles. See you guys tomorrow. Goodnight, Loki."
"Good boy", Stark kissed the child's temple and hugged him. "Papa is making breakfast for us, do you want to help him?"
When Peter raised a brow, Tony sighed. "Ty expects me to be big and extravagant." He pointed out the window towards the direction of Manhattan. "He expects me to stay in big hotels and spend money like I used to." He paused, looking back at Peter, "And that's how we're going to outsmart him. We're going to use cash and keep a low profile."
He wasn't sure how much time passed; it felt like fifteen minutes, it felt like an hour. All Steve was aware of was that he'd spent the last two months wondering what it'd be like to kiss Tony, to know what he tasted like and what his hands felt like while they were caressing his skin, but he finally had his answer. And he was loving every single second of it.
"He seemed...unsure. Like he isn't sure what to expect. There's something about Tony that I just can't put my finger on." He cleared his throat before continuing, "He's a friend of a friend."
"Rhodey?" Steve asked, his face lighting up. Tony wasn't sure if his surprise showed on his face, but if Steve knew Rhodes went by Rhodey to his friends, he couldn't be that bad, right?
"Because it's Christmas," Sarah said softly. Sarah had a way to be soft and soothing when the situation called for it; honestly, she made the
So even though Steve was a bad boy and people knew not to mess with him, they also knew that he would stand up for people who needed it. For people who couldn't handle things themselves.
Honestly, Steve couldn't give a fuck about the parade, even though Bucky had told him repeatedly that he couldn't be a New Yorker and
"It's different," Tony said, finding his voice, even though it was soft, hesitant. "Malibu is always sunny and warm. It's fucking
"Christmas is next week," Joe mentioned, taking a drink of his iced tea. "Do you and your parents have plans?"
"Steve," Tony whispered, and that's when Steve noticed -- they were close. So close. Their faces millimeters apart, and it wouldn't take much to lean up and kiss him, to let their lips meet and do the one thing that Steve had been itching to do for weeks.
The man held out his hand, seeming oblivious to Tony's internal panic. "I'm Steve Rogers. I own this bed and breakfast."
"Steve," Tony said softly, carefully, "when I was in Malibu, nobody wanted to give me anything just because. Nobody wanted to kiss me hello, or just because. They wanted a piece of me, yes, and they wanted to fuck me, but not because of me. Never because of me. They wanted a piece of
Even though Tony didn't really care for sports, and he didn't pay attention to them, there was honestly nowhere else he'd rather be.
Steve left the room and went into the kitchen, where Bucky was sitting at the kitchen table, reading the newspaper. He sighed when he heard Steve come into the room.
Before they escaped the abuse, the physical and emotional pain Tiberius put them through had taken hold. Tiberius had done everything to make sure Tony was emotionally codependent on him. He gaslit and beat down Tony's self-esteem until Tony was only a shadow of his formal confident self.
"Welcome to the Rogers Bed and Breakfast," the woman behind the counter said with a smile. She actually reminded Tony of Peter's mom. Pepper's hair hadn't been as dark as this woman's, but she was small, petite, and incredibly well put together. He noticed her hair was tied back but still looked like it'd taken a long time to style, and her nails had an immaculate manicure. Her green eyes studied him as she spoke, "Do you have a reservation?"
He kept telling himself he was being stupid -- he'd known Tony for a while now. Tony had been going to Brooklyn High for about three months, and they'd become really close since then. They even had plans for their first date, although, since it'd been so close to Christmas when they declared their attraction to one another, they had decided to wait until afterwards.
Tony looked a little apprehensive at first, but then nodded. The way that Steve knew Tony, he knew that Tony probably hadn't eaten yet today.
"He seems like he's got something on his mind, but he's nice enough. I told him if there's anything we can do, to let us know."
Well, Howard would've, if he ever gave Tony the time of day. Maria found herself often wishing that she could do something to make her son and husband get along better than they did.
Okay, so Tony didn't really know if he needed to be on guard around Steve, or anybody else at this bed and breakfast, but he wanted to let him know, as subtle as possible, that he did have someone in his corner, and that guy had military training.
Everybody had heard about the new kid coming to school. They didn't get new kids very often, but this wasn't just
Tony shook his head. "No, sir," he answered. "Dad's going to Malibu to do a merger with a company, and his business partner's gonna be there with him. Jarvis and Ana make a really nice dinner, but Mom and I told them not to bother since it'll be just us."
"You wanna talk to me about what's going on, Tony?" Steve asked him, watching his friend carefully. Steve plopped down onto his bed, and Tony took a seat next to him.
"Steve...ah!" Tony gasped as he was thrust into. Again, slow and gentle. Kisses were placed along his neck and face. Fingers mapping his body. It was a feeling he could get addicted to.
Humming to himself Tony cut the bell peppers into smaller pieces before moving onto the onions. Though not before he put on his protective glasses, which was just a pair of swimming googles. All while keeping an ear on Loki playing in the living room. He had definitely learned his lessons about silent toddlers.
"We didn't break up", the blond said calmly. "We got married this past spring and was dating before that."
"I'm going to be honest", Tony said while dozing off. "Some time soon, I'm going to lick every single muscle. Because I..." a snore told the blond his husband was out for the count. It had been a surprise, in the beginning, that the brunet was the type who could fall asleep immediately. He always gave the impression of being the type who takes hours to fall asleep.
Maybe it was just the lighting, but for a moment, the two men seemed to be glowing. Natasha shook her head, when she looked again, there was nothing going on. Had to be the lighting.
overreact, wouldn't he. But there is no way we can hide that a kid lives here now. How do we explain this?"
English, but he couldn't speak it. Because they walked with shoes on in the penthouse a lot of the time, or in slippers, he had gotten some comfortable slip-on shoes. They were soft enough that there shouldn't be an issue.
Loki whined and started crying again. Making even more snow fall. Steve hugged him, exchanging a look with his husband. They would have to address all this later. For now they had to give attention to their son. With some effort they managed to return to the penthouse.
Tracing the outline with his pencil, Steve tried to pull forth the memory best he could. The confident smile, the mischievous look, and that furrowed brow of concentration. After all, there was just no way he could stare long enough to do this in front of them. Without warning, his sketchbook was pulled from his hands. Glaring at Bucky, he waited.
Huffing a chuckle the brunet sat up and looked into those intense blue eyes. The guy was definitely handsome. Broad shoulders, strong chest, and a nice ass. In the right clothes. It was remarkable that he had started out as a sickly and scrawny kid. And now he was having that worried little frown on his face and a complicated expression.
"In Central Park", Steve said. "He came up to me on his own. Completely naked and very filthy. Using a blood sample we confirmed it was Loki."
"Oh, I did. It is being recorded as we speak. It is this", he showed his husband the video. "Some kid in a costume is swinging around New York, doing things that should be impossible. But it doesn't look like a trick either."
The Gatekeeper focused for a moment. "The archer is with a pregnant woman and two children. I presume they are a family."
"Do you want to stay for a while?" Thor asked. "I could tell you some stories if you want. Maybe about your namesake?"
"Papa..." the small voice broke his heart and made him want to cry as well. He really hoped Steve would finish things up soon.
Thor thought about a young boy getting a second chance on Midgard. "Is there more to the spell than just rebirth?"
"I will call you as often as I can", Steve promised. "Take care of yourself and of Loki. I love you, Tony."
"Hi! Are one of you his dad?" A visibly pregnant woman with long, brown hair said. Behind her stood two more children. Looking like they were in elementary school.
It turned out that Loki had gotten hungry while playing in a nearby room. The guy who had been asked to keep an eye on the boy had not been prepared. When asked about food, he just said later. Which for their son, meant food was on its way if he just waited a bit.
"Didn't take you for a pineapple on pizza kind of guy", he quipped to his husband. The soldier laughed and kissed him as he sat down.
"Loki woke us up several times", his best friend explained. "Wanting us to come with him and stay with him as he fell asleep."
"Papa isn't coming home for a while, Lo", the engineer said and picked up the god. "He will be out keeping the world safe and making it a better place."
The two spies slash assassins walked off while bickering. Steve looked at his drawing. He'd rather just have any answer, good or bad, than none at all.
Steve chuckled again and gave him a looong kiss on the mouth. And then a few more shorter ones. Opening his eyes Tony looked into those blue eyes. So earnest and open.
"And why would the Prince of Asgard need to spend time with mere mortals?" The king asked. "Their lives are short, meaningless."
The blond chuckled, holding him close. "It isn't so bad to just relax like this once in a while either."
The son of Howard Stark. Howard, who he had been ordered to kill. His friend. The father of Steve's husband. Which was a doozy on its own but... what did you do in this situation? Did they know? If they did, why did they help him? If they didn't, how would they react to finding out?
"Oh, you have no idea", the blond said and pulled his boyfriend in for a kiss. While water damage was no small thing, it was also a blessing in disguise.
"Why bother drawing me when I'm right here?" The brunet teased. "You can just look at the real deal."
The words hurt. More than he would have liked to admit. It didn't help that it was obvious Pepper had intended them to hurt. Things would get awkward in the company but it wasn't the first time they were at odds. Stark Industries would be fine.
"Let's hurry, then." And hurry they did. The moment they made it through the door to the room, they were all over each other. Kissing, touching, trying to take off their clothes while moving closer to the bed. They stumbled a few times, making them laugh and giggle.
His brother probably never expected to need the spell, but maybe he had already known that it would work.
Loki had accidentally knocked the tin to the floor when he was reaching for an apple. Making the boy think his parents would get angry. To his credit, he had tried to clean it up. But a four year old child couldn't do much. They had been alerted by his crying. Reassuring him that they were not angry, it had been an accident and accidents happen.
There was a sincere expression on the man's face. What ultimately made him decide was the fact that this person knew who he was. Remembered him.
"I'm not completely sure but it seems like it can be absorbed through the skin as well by inhaling." Bruce bit his lip. "Where were the gas tubes taken?"
Things calmed down considerably after a while. Once the initial shock wore off, Steve and Tony received a lot of support from around the world. Meaning they could go on with their lives undisturbed. That year's Christmas was a far cry from the year before. Loki was naturally the center of attention.
"Here is a tip for you, Thunder Pants. Look up the concept of racism. You and the rest of your barbarian culture could do with learning a thing or two."
"With JARVIS around there is no real reason to worry. And despite his mischief, he is a very well-behaved child." The soldier had a soft smile, taking it in strides.
"Bedroom", he panted. Which prompted the blond to take of his jacket and then pick the shorter man up. Carrying his like a bride.
"Pepper came by and asked if she could take him out for some breakfast and play time. I figured it wasn't a problem. She took Bucky with her as well."
The hangover feeling was starting to fade, thankfully. Steve slowly drank his orange juice, thinking about the night before. For some reason, all his doubts and worries had just flew out the window. All his longing had come crashing down and he acted without thinking. He honestly had never thought it could go any further than kissing and some touching. Even in his dazed state he had been sure of it. Yet, as always, Tony went above and beyond his expectations.
The two made their way down, using the stairs the last stretch. Snow was piling up inside, all while Loki was crying loudly. Because he was taller, the soldier could make his way quicker through the layer of snow. Moving against the wind. Ignoring the chill he picked up his son. Rubbing his back and speak soothingly to him. Soon enough Tony managed to make it as well.
His husband nodded and picked up their distressed son. Loki still flailed but it didn't work as well on his Papa.
Since there was nothing for it, the tiny god got back into the elevator. The common floor wasn't very exciting since there were no toys but sometimes there was someone to play with.
Laughing the engineer got in close and kissed his husband. Someone had to be having fun, because a slow song started playing. Strong arms wrapped around him. Holding him close as they moved slowly. Tony found himself just relaxing against the other, allowing himself to be swayed.
"Someone is far more likely to barge in on me than you..." Steve said absentmindedly. Tony started swearing. "What is the problem?"
A delicious smell drifted through the doors as Tony neared the right floor. When he walked out, he was welcomed by a small pizza party. It had to be JARVIS who ordered, because there was a lot. Enough that they would be eating pizza for the next three days. Even with Steve's and Loki's appetites.
"We are trying to avoid using profanity in front of Loki", his friend explained. "He pick stuff up like that too easily already."
Coming back from his meeting, Steve looked utterly crushed. Tony, who had joined Loki in some kind of game, frowned when he saw it.
"He is in pretty much perfect health", the doctor said. "The only thing you might want to consider is vaccines but... well, it's Loki..."
"They are the same thing, just different names. I was honestly surprised to learn my brother was one of them."
"You would, wouldn't you..." his husband sighed and leaned against him. "That would be no good though. To live without you... I don't want that."
Unfortunately, things had taken a nosedive. Especially after he returned to New York. With all the would-be villains popping up everywhere, he could hardly sit back and do nothing. She did
"This is what he gets for sleeping all night", Bucky said, leaning against the wall. "Besides, he could always just ask for help."
Gathering himself he joined the others. There were more important things to worry about. If those helicarriers took off, Tony and Loki would be in danger. And there would be no where for them to go that would be safe.
A stressed employee seemed torn between running out to fetch the kid and stay were he was. Rather than being bothered though, the soldier just picked the child up into his arms. Holding him with practised ease. The sudden  appearance had pushed the journalists into a shocked silence. Until someone raised their hands.
Plenty of friends around, tons of food and sweets, and way too many toys. Their son was over the moon and had a blast. Making it the best Christmas ever. The winter then melted away to spring. Marking one year since the boy arrived in their lives. Since they didn't know exactly when he had returned to childhood, they celebrated the day he came as his birthday.
"I see", he said. "I had intended to stay longer but it seems wiser to return to Asgard. If nothing else, the answer to Loki's current situation might be there as well."
"Nay, Captain. I know not what nefarious things my brother has planned but he has fooled you all with his trickery."
The soldier stared at him. Then he smiled and hugged the engineer while giving him a kiss. "Thank you. But what about Loki?"
The feed cut off. Counting today that would leave him with only five days with Tony and Loki while having no idea when he could come home.
While his husband went berserk on Barton Steve was left dealing with the upset god of mischief. Loki just kept crying and wouldn't calm down. Not even enough to eat lunch. So, he decided to try something different. Showing his son his shield. The tiny Trickster immediately recognised it.
I inquired about this, wondering if they had issues with other writers in my language, while I didn't get an answer on that. I was told that they are very pleased with my work and that I'm reliable. Which is why I get the bulk of those commissions.
"If anyone can, it's you. You are pretty good at that kind of stuff, Steve", Tony gave a small smirk. "You are also a pretty good kisser. Care to demonstrate?"
"I guess..." Sam's eyes were drawn to the toddler babbling at Steve. The words didn't make any sense to him and he was very confused about the relationship.
"I asked him about meeting you, Captain. He said he doesn't remember how he got there. Just that he was in a place with grass and trees. Walking around. For a few days from what I gathered. When he saw you, something told him you were safe and decided to approach you."
Combing through the short hair he marvelled at his sudden luck. Maybe he had a future after all. One with his brilliant, mischievous, and big-hearted engineer.
Reaching the bedroom Tony was half prepared to be thrown down on the mattress. Instead he was lowered gently with a kiss and was then undressed like he was something precious. A quick rummaging through the nightstand produced a bottle of lube and some condoms. Apparently the blond had been reading up. Prompting the engineer to place a pillow under his hips.
"Hey!" Barton protested. Both Natasha and Bruce was looking at him. One unreadable and one in shock.
Tony stands still in front of Peter, studying the familiar face that is looking back at him. His hands go onto Peter’s shoulders and just for a second he feels the strong urge to fuck this whole plan and go home anyway. Or just close enough so that Peter can
“This here is Hilde.” She points at the dark-skinned woman who looks defeated more than anything. “And those two are-“
Morgan smiles again. “I love you 3000,” she returns. Tony snorts, because that doesn’t make any sense.
“I know.” Tony lets out another deep breath and then scootches to the side on his bed. He pats the empty space between him, gesturing for Steve to join him.
Sam follows, not that much later. He flies up in the sky, circling once around Steve as more portals start appearing around them. Near the ground, but also in the air. Thanos says nothing during that time, but he does seem a bit confused about it.
They stay like that for a couple of seconds, but eventually their time runs out. Pepper leans away, drying her eyes as she gets on her feet. Then she reaches out her hand.
The people have been divided into the two sides, but it’s obvious that one the one closest to Hilde is still standing. She clutches at her chest, feeling a strong pain all of the sudden.
“Come with me,” she whispers at them. Immediately, the first few people start following her. The others quickly gesture for their friends and families to follow. With great sadness, Hilde comes to the realization that Agnar is lying on the ground on the other side.
Hilde can’t move in time. Both she and her flying horse are too close to the impact of the beam from Thanos’ ship. Peter falls off the horse, ending up on the ground as he still holds on to the gauntlet.
Tony sighs. “Look, it’s not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. I’m telling you, you’re in no condition.”
Hilde sighs. So much for the calm they’ve been having for now. Better take this matter into her own had.
“Is there anything you can do?” asks Loki while holding his child in his arms. He looks like he can’t hold out much longer.
“Tony, I can’t believe it.” Rather than hugging him, Steve offers Tony the support he needs. He helps him get down the rest of the stairs, and only when they’re on the ground do they stop moving.
Oh, so typically her. Tony cringes upon hearing what he might have been called. “Huh, might wanna let that stew a while. You got time.”
“You should not be here,” he breathes out, nervous all the sudden. His entire body starts to shake, his chest aching, making him want to start rub the scar. He shakes his head while his eyes never leave Peter’s guilty face.
They shelter away at the church they had been visiting earlier today. She helps him step forward, until he gestures that he can’t go on. Carefully, she puts him back down against the wall, her fingers passing over the wound.
"So... is this bad timing or great timing?" Wilson had returned without them noticing. Loki rushed towards them, throwing himself in the engineer's arms. The black man had an amused expression on his face. "He refused to eat anything, repeating 'Papa' and 'Daddy' instead."
"Uh... sure." Tony was fully expecting some kind of back-pedalling. Instead two warm lips pressed against his own. The kiss was gentle, but it definitely wasn't innocent. There were intent behind it. They parted just slightly and the engineer felt the warm breath on his face. Slowly the soldier moved closer until their lips met again. And again. Starting to feel weak in the knees Tony's mind was swirling.
"They are both out", maybe-aunt Natasha said. "Barnes is seeing a therapist and Banner is meeting a friend."
In spite of his temporary orange hair, Barnes settled in fairly easy. Which was mostly thanks to Loki, who pestered the guy constantly. Tony thought it was quite funny, though he was well aware that he was being avoided. Even during meals the former sergeant refused to meet his eyes and barely spoke one word to him. Unfortunately, that meant he didn't really speak to Steve either.
"Sure, uncle Bucky to the rescue", the man said and stood. Lifting the child into the air, making noises while walking swiftly. Loki held over his head. Causing the small god to shriek with laughter.
Barton's wife winced and petted her stomach. "Little Natasha is... little Nathaniel." The assassin pouted and muttered something about traitors.
"I will try, if nothing else, I have you to rein me in." They shared a kiss. Completely ignoring the chaos in front of them. Steve pulled him into a hug. Making him feel so warm and content.
Life went on despite his heartbreak. He had decided to count his blessings rather than focus on the negative. As a result he at least managed to avoid turning to drinking himself to death. Unfortunately, his nightmares was making a return.
"Apparently he gets most of the toys from miss Potts or the Colonel", the Captain's friend said. "They are kind of competing for being the favourite uncle slash aunt."
The first few days after Steve left wasn't so bad. Tony managed to feed Loki and get him into bed on time. Whenever he needed to distract the kid he put him in front of the TV. Horrible parenting, bla bla bla. It didn't hurt the boy and it wasn't all the time. Mostly the tiny god was playing loudly while he was working.
Deflating the Thunderer took off the satchel, offering it. The engineer took it and looked inside, one eyebrow rose. "What am I supposed to do with these?"
"It is more than okay", the blond said. His demeanour... changed. Something very... soft... came over him. "I have never been so happy consistently. I'm married to the man I love and we are raising our son. It is more than I ever expected out of life. Is there a reason for your question?"
"I only wished to tell him a story", Thor said. Looking slightly offended. "I was going to tell him about how my hammer was forged."
"Titta! Titta ågel! Den fygej! Oj!" The boy chattered, laughing at the pigeons outside the window. After a while Loki started kneading his eyes. Maybe he was tired? The soldier was pretty sure small children needed naps. Since Tony wasn't done yet, he took the boy to their bedroom for now. There he took off the small shoes and tucked the kid into the bed. As he turned to leave, Loki let out a loud whine. Reaching out to him. Petting the black hair Steve moved to leave again. This time the whine got louder and he was barely out the door when the tiny god started crying. Arms held out towards him as the toddler tried to climb across the bed.
The group reached some kind of odd vehicle and one after another the other kids were placed inside it. All while another woman made notes. While his now former playmates had ran forward to get inside the odd thing, Loki did not.
"Thor...." the Captain sighed. "You have to let that go. Your brother is dead, and I'm truly sorry for that. I understand that you are grieving him. But you can't project those feeling on this Loki. You will hurt both of you."
The Thunderer pondered this revelation. Heimdall wasn't aware that Loki was living as a child among the humans. Couldn't see it. From what he had heard, the relationship between Stark and Rogers wasn't apparent either. What kind of powers were at play here?
"Okay, okay", Tony said, backing away a bit. "Before anyone starts shooting arrows or bullets, or turning green, here us out first."
He was very pleased to see that it made things easier for all of them. Less diapers for one thing. The only time the pull-ups were used were during the night. Just in case.
Eyeing the boy again the black man shrugged. "Sure, I can take him to the hospital cafeteria but I have no idea what he is saying."
"It is nice", the engineer agreed. "We won't have much of this until the kid is older. Though I kind of dread the teenage years."
It was oddly quiet without the tiny god. Steve shook himself and ran his fingers through Tony's hair, kissing his lips. They both blushed a bit, laughed, and fell into each other's arms.
Steve touched Tony's cheek, relieved to feel that he was less cold. Still not good enough, but better. Joining his husband under the blanket he held him close. Sharing his warmth while cuddling, watching their son play with his toys.
"Ah", his husband said. "He didn't want you to watch over him, he wanted one or both of you to stay with him all night."
Tony used some kind of liquid to quell the gas. They then managed to finish the job without further incident.
"Papa makes better pancakes, huh? Well, he can't beat my omelette. Why don't you help me make one? Wouldn't that be fun?"
The Thunderer frowned again but then slumped. "I see... for whatever reason, Loki has been given a second chance at life. If he is happy here, I won't interfere."
"Loki was a Jotun, a Frost Giant, that my father found at the end of the war with the giants. Despite being the son of his enemy, he took pity on the child. Abandoned for its small size. He raised him as his own son and a prince of Asgard."
"I... I just did what I wanted to do. And I do hope you haven't felt discomfort since..." the soldier looked concerned. That worried little frown of his. The engineer reached up and gently massaged it.
"Nah, my dad never made time for me when I was growing up. I'm not going to make the same mistake towards Lo. He deserves better. Alright, JARVIS. While I sort through my things, I want you to look for Barnes. See if you can find anything that might give us a hint."
Even so, he wasn't quite prepared to be guided to a plane and seeing Iron Man waiting for them. Waving and everything.
There was a tense silence in his wake. So tense that everyone jumped when the elevator pinged. Out came Loki, clutching his blankie while crying.
They had a rare chance to take their time in their own  bed. Bucky, Sam, and Rhodey had decided to take their honorary nephew out for some fun. Namely an amusement park. Neither Tony or Steve had seen any issue with that. It was more impressive that it took them twenty minutes to realise that they had the whole day to themselves. Which meant that they jumped at the chance. And each other.
"Do you want to shoot a few more hail bullets?" The engineer asked the Trickster who glowered, holding out one hand.
The young god spent the rest of the meal quiet, attentively listening to the conversations around him. Readjusting, shifting. With All-Speak it shouldn't be an issue.
?", with the last being "Actually, why am I surprised. This is you we are talking about." By the time he was told about the kid, he no longer cared enough to be bothered.
"I..." the strawberry blonde woman took a deep breath. "I wanted to apologise. I realise it took me way too long to do this, but... Tony, I'm sorry for what I said to you when we broke up. I shouldn't have said any of it."
"And I rather risk mine than risk either of yours." The calm demeanour was enough to make the engineer less angry. "I love both of you, Tony. Of course I don't want either of you in danger. I would rather die before I let either of you get hurt."
Snickering Tony took a few more photos of the sleeping duo. It was honestly a rather cute sight. Little Loki fast asleep on Steve's chest, who had also fallen asleep. No wonder it had suddenly gotten quiet.
"You are indulging his behaviour?" Thor asked, incredulous. "He was throwing a tantrum just now, refusing to eat."
"Morning", the brunet greeted. Still confused the former asset shook his head. Trying to understand what was going on.
Worming his way out from under the covers he used the bathroom and then returned to bed. Falling asleep once more.
Steve, wonderful, reliable, gentle, Steve, pulled him into a hug. Holding him while he sobbed. Not saying anything or trying to intervene. Because he understood. There was no way his husband didn't feel the same. Adult Loki had been a bit of a bastard, but raising him from a child showed all the potential he had always had. In many ways, they had started to think of the man who was as their kid just as much as the child he had become.
"You haven't broken anything", the blond said stubbornly. "Come on. We can discuss this later, for now you need to get warm. No excuses." Pulling his husband to his feet Steve was rather alarmed at how cold he felt. Taking them both to the penthouse he bundled up Tony in a thick blanket and made some hot chocolate for the two of them. Which the tiny Trickster completely ignored and was instead playing like there was nothing unusual. At least the engineer was drinking.
"That has to be the lamest proposal ever", the engineer said, snuggling closer. A tiny sneeze came from Loki but didn't wake him. "But I'm definitely willing to think about it."
Steve shrugged. "Everyone is different. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. Once Tony is done with Loki's bath we will probably just relax until dinner."
He was happier than he had been in his whole life. Holding a sleeping Tony Steve was feeling like crying because he was so happy. The brunet might not be quite there yet in terms of feelings, but he seemed like he wanted to get there. Without judgement, without questions, he had accepted the soldier.
"Okay..." Bucky sat down, eyeing them. "Can someone explain why this kid is calling you Papa and Daddy? For that matter, where did he come from?"
"Banner... Bruce... I fell in love with him first, I was the one who asked if he wanted to marry me. Granted it wasn't a big proposal or anything, but it was still me. I've always been interested in both men and women. Just ask Bucky, he used to tease me about it."
Because there were no clothes for the boy he dressed him in one of his own shirts. Carrying him back to the living room. Tony was pacing.
Hanging his head the guy left. There really were not a lot of people who could handle Loki properly. They seemed to caught off guard by how well-spoken he was. Not knowing how they should respond when his behaviour didn't align with his speech. Unlike the usual suspects who wasn't confused at all. Too bad they had all been too busy today.
It had been obvious that the boy in no way associated the toy with himself. According to Pepper, the Loki action figure was surprisingly popular on the market.
"That was why we offered you Thor's floor. It was a good excuse to start living together", Tony gave a careful grin. "Loki is our son, by the way. Thought I'd let you know. On paper I'm bio dad and Steve is adoptive dad, though obviously we both adopted him."
anything, they had practically anything they could ever want, it was Christmas, and everybody should get gifts on Christmas. Also, when Steve had mentioned some of Tony's favorite foods, Sarah had gone out of her way to make them.
It didn't take very long for the kiss to evolve, however, and when Tony's tongue slowly slid across Steve's bottom lip, silently asking for access, Steve acquiesced and opened his mouth, letting Tony's tongue tangle with his.
Steve cocked a brow at his friend, but finally said, "Dad's preaching tomorrow. I'll be home after twelve-thirty."
Peter shifted away from Tony and avoided eye contact. This told Tony that Peter wanted to drop the subject for now.
tell what it was, but it wasn't exactly prominent anymore. Steve knew that his parents could see the bruise and were trying really hard
And Steve had been right. Tony had been getting emotional in the bathroom, because his eyes were red and glossy, the skin around them puffy. He had definitely been crying.
There is a mention of past controlling behavior, child abuse, and child neglect in this chapter. Even though it's incredibly brief, it is there.
Steve let Bucky's words sink in for the next couple of days. On Wednesday, Tony arrived at school with a black eye, and he seemed like he kind of withdrew into himself. The Tony they'd come to know, he wasn't afraid to say what was on his mind, he wasn't afraid for people to know what he was thinking. But this Tony -- he was completely different.
Considering Joe had had a lot of practice with the less fortunate, because of his job, they had bought a few gifts for Tony's family. Even though Tony and his family didn't
When they broke the kiss mere moments later, Tony looked at Steve and said, "Now that my dad knows I'm not straight, nothing is going to stop me from dating whomever I want to. So, Steve, would you want to go out with me? Get dinner?"
No way, that stinking bastard! Is he really going to switch sides like that to save his own skin? He didn’t want them out of there to save them; he wanted them gone so they wouldn’t know he was such a sneaky weasel.
