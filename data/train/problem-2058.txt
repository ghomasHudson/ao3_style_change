"Yup! Now you’re getting the hang of this Alpha thing!" John grinned down at him and then looked over the disaster of a room.
"Sherlock? What are you doing?" He asked and Sherlock snorted and grabbed the bag that John had resting on his right shoulder, throwing it in the back of the car where he’d just tossed his own as John was making his way over.
John ran around for another couple of minutes before Sherlock played a particularly vicious growl over the speakers causing John’s whole body stop and go pale before the man made a run for one of the cages along the side of the room, when Sherlock saw no more movement for a time he finally reached the end of his patience, heart hammering in his chest and picked up the phone to call John. When the man answered he was panting heavily and squeaking through his words.
So in honour of me finally writing the next part of this series I’ve actually gone through this and tweaked it a bit. Sometimes sorting out my own mistakes and sometimes adding bits here and there, either way it’s still the same story just a little… remastered shall we say ^^
"Oh! Who folds up a shirt after ironing it anyway?!" Sherlock sniffed defensively and went to snatch the shirt from John's hands but somehow his body rebelled and he ended up gently removing it from John's hands and bending forward to nuzzle at the side of the Omega's face, taking in his scent and thanking his good little Omega for caring for his big, strong, Alpha as nature intended.
?" John who had remained silent throughout the exchange, and who was rather amused by it if he was honest, chose that moment to intervene, frowning, he pointed at Greg.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
"Oh! Looks like Mrs. Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster." John said to Sherlock who had been watching the fight with amusement, when he was sure John’s eyes were still locked on the shouting match inside, he glanced over out the corner of his eye at John, the man didn't seem upset anymore so Sherlock decided to not mention the situation from upstairs and just get on with things.
, he had no time for them. Once parked they jumped out of the car and started walking past the group of people.
." Sherlock soothed and pulled John against him, running his hands up and down the smaller man’s back, John sighed and nuzzled Sherlock’s scarf.
"Yes. You should have and if you must know it was the way you kept tugging on your left pocket." John shook his head in amazement and giggled at him. Hah! There it was, Sherlock always prefers happy John to grumpy John, since it usually meant more fun for Sherlock in the long run.
"Oh... I... I was just about to say." Henry murmured pointing to the television and drawing Sherlock from his thoughts once again.
"Okay, Sherlock, okay... Remember yesterday when you pinned me down and clamped your teeth to the back of my neck? How I just gave in and submitted myself to you?" John asked seductively and watched pleased as the anger left Sherlock’s eyes and was replace by burning lust and satisfaction.
." John replied and then gave Sherlock a gentle kiss, Sherlock kissed back but was clearly a little uncomfortable at his secret being found out by the one person he was trying to keep it from and of the endearment so he pulled back with the excuse of phoning Angelo’s to order their dinner.
"Nope sorry, I don’t believe you. No normal Alpha would be able to smell that this early." John gritted out and Sherlock scoffed and nipped at the skin in front of him in admonishment.
"Sherlock, let me go, please. My shoulders hurt and I need to treat them." John said lowly and shifted his head back against Sherlock’s shoulder so he could nuzzle at the big Alpha’s neck hesitantly, after all he didn’t want another repeat of what happened earlier. Sherlock purred appreciatively though and in turn, shifted so he could nuzzle at John’s hair. John let the mutual nuzzling continue, he knew Sherlock needed to do this even if the idiot didn’t know
“Mr. Watson, My name is Willis and I’ve been instructed to take you to an area outside of London where you will be escorted by car into the city.” Sherlock just nodded, he didn’t care about that and he already knew where he was going.
"Bugger." He groaned then grabbed John by the front of his jacket and tugged him over the seat to sit in Sherlock’s lap.
Sherlock proved he was in fact a very apt driver like he'd said and had them on their way in no time. It was the most awkward drive in history.
"I wish we could stay here and rest right now but I think Greg will get suspicious if we don’t make an appearance soon." Sherlock whined but nodded in agreement, he nudged John to get off him and stood to right himself. It took Sherlock five minutes but he managed to disguise the fact he’d just had a blowjob, wouldn’t do for Lestrade to start asking questions and pestering John. Speaking of which, the Omega was adjusting himself uncomfortably by the door as he waited for Sherlock.
John was behind that door with their baby, their new-born baby daughter and it was that realisation that made Sherlock forget everything else in the world. No more Moriarty, no more Fall, no more network, it all came crashing away and he moved forward to head into the room that held his husband and his daughter only to be stopped by a hand on his arm.
"I didn't know, I noticed." Then he started rattling off his deductions to the startled man who was now sitting back down, John tried to stop Sherlock from showing off but was unsuccessful and despite the fact that he tried to stop Sherlock, John still look amazed when Sherlock had finished, Henry did
"Really? You can't think of one recurring scenario that happens to me on a monthly basis?" He asked sceptically.
“ETA two minutes, Mr. Watson.” Willis confirmed and sure enough two minutes later Sherlock was climbing out of the helicopter and being bundled into a black car where Anthea was sitting, typing away on her phone.
"I see, and Mr. Holmes is an Alpha. I knew that the moment I walked into this place, how can you both cohabit so easily without, uh, well
"Sherlock." John said calmly in an attempt to not further anger the snarling Alpha and he saw the exact moment when Sherlock came back to himself and realised what he’d done. The dark haired man swallowed and turned away from John, dropping forward momentarily to grab the keys off the ground.
"You know exactly what I’m talking about, Sherlock. Who the hell is going to be driving this car?" Sherlock tossed the keys in the air with one hand and caught them in the other with a grin whilst he made his way around to the driver’s side of the vehicle.
John on the other hand was overjoyed with the momentary peace that had befell him, now don’t misunderstand the situation, the Omega could never deny how much he loved his and Sherlock’s adrenaline fuelled life but sometimes he could really go for a lie in and a Full English in the morning so that’s what he did for the better part of three weeks, it was such a shame that today was the day his lovely peace would finally end, beginning with a text.
"You mean you don’t know?!" She cried, horrified. Of course she knew about the baby, Sherlock and John had told her when they got back but swore her and Lestrade to secrecy.
"Straight through, sir." The soldier called in parting and John nearly crumpled in half with relief.
"That’s fine." John replied quickly, scolding himself for his lack of control, then something dawned on him about the way Gary had said '
It only took John fifteen minutes to do his packing, it was rather soothing actually, the repetitive motions of folding clothes helping to calm him down and make him realize he’d been acting like a 50 year old woman. It wasn’t Sherlock’s fault that John was so sensitive, the poor Alpha had never dealt with an Omega on the verge of heat before and he had no desire to either, John couldn’t stay upset over that.
NO! Sherlock’s eyes went wild and feral at the thought, there was no way John would let himself be bonded to another Alpha, he had told Sherlock that not five hours ago but then... John might not have a choice if the Alpha was dominant enough. The growl vibrating through the room at the thought was utterly terrifying, and the Beta couple in the room next door fled from the sound of it, Sherlock heard them but he didn’t care, all he cared about was John and John was missing because Sherlock had made one
"So they didn’t have it put down then; the dog?" Sherlock asked John taking a drink of his coffee; John did an internal eye roll, back to the case then, still the reprieve was nice while it lasted.
scent, good God! It was amazing, John had never smelled anything like it before, it was so musky and fertile and he couldn’t get enough. Was that the reason John submitted so easily? Because of that lovely scent? It was the best answer John had come up with, so maybe John just...
"Fine." Sherlock gritted out and John licked a strip up his throat, pleased. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut at the sensation and John pushed him gently over toward the chairs they’d sat at last night to nudge Sherlock down into one before plonking his arse in the other.
"No need, I hired a car before we left the flat. The gentleman should be waiting for us with the keys." John stopped dead in the middle of the pavement and stared at Sherlock’s back wide eyed. Now, John could drive but he hadn’t renewed his license since he’d returned from Afghanistan so he wasn’t legal to drive and if the amount of money spent on cabs was any indication Sherlock couldn’t drive at all so who the hell would be driving?
Luckily Sherlock also noticed the lack of daylight and pulled back surprisingly gently but that could mean anything right now, John kept his eyes locked on the silhouette of the detective in the mirror, waiting for whatever explosion Sherlock would have this time but to John’s shocked delight the detective only dropped his head down to place a kiss on John’s left shoulder and slipped a tube of ointment into his hand before disappearing back out the door.
"Excellent." Sherlock replied, proud at John’s observance of this evidence, John could sense that he’d pleased his Alpha and gave Sherlock a little grin before nodding back over to Greg.
"I am here because somehow this morning I saw you and your charming husband get into a cab that managed to disappear through a number of streets that have eluded my observation. I was quite concerned for you so I popped ‘round to make sure you were both safe. Where is my lovely brother-in-law anyway Sherlock? Oh do stop snarling brother." Sherlock managed to contain himself and cleared his throat.
, lying beneath the quiet and it was starting to piss Sherlock off. Since they’d left Baskerville and John’s little confession behind, the Omega had been acting completely normal and how he could do that after dropping a bombshell like that? Sherlock had no idea,
"Why? We’re nearly there." He asked confused but Sherlock was already pulling up next to a large rock formation.
?!" John cried furious and Sherlock shushed him whilst looking around at the other people who had glanced over at John’s exclamation.
"I need to change and so do you; we need to take our bags up to the room anyway. You have the key, yes? Good. I’ll meet you inside." Sherlock rambled after what seemed like years and then grabbed the bags from the car boot and speed walked into ‘
Still, if it wasn’t for that moment his eyes met John’s back in that hospital room he probably wouldn’t have realized something very important. Sherlock was going to survive this and then when he was finished, when Moriarty and everything to do with him was erased from the face of the earth, Sherlock was coming back home to John and Charlotte and nothing was going to stop him.
"Funny doesn’t suit you. I’d stick to ice." John replied and Sherlock panicked inside, John wasn’t responding to him at all.
agreed on two. Sherlock growled at himself, no, this was not a priority, finding John was and Sherlock had no idea where to look but he figured going back downstairs might be a good start, it was just a shame that his feet couldn’t move.
"Yeah you do!" Sherlock’s brows furrowed when he sat down and he and John looked at each other for a moment before bursting into peals of laughter, something neither man thought they’d ever do again after what had happened that day. When the laughter ended Sherlock looked over to John who had his head tilted back, breathing heavily, face flushed and face relaxed. He looked beautiful. The soft smile that had rested on Sherlock’s face as he’d watched the Doctor slowly fell and he reached over to rest his hand on John’s leg.
Sherlock could have slapped himself, he was one step away from letting out a girly sigh, clasping his hands to the side of his face and batting his eyelashes, just because he had finally admitted to himself that he wanted John and was prepared to do something about it did not mean he was going to turn into a sentimental fool or worse;
started yet, if it had started then you wouldn't have been able to take a flying leap across the bed and insult me! Secondly you've been feeling strange because my body is preparing itself for heat and that puts a change in my scent that you have unconsciously, as an Alpha, picked up on; that means that your body is preparing itself for my heat and your instincts are telling you to look after me and lastly I didn't tell you because I didn't know we would be taking a merry jaunt to bloody Devon!" John screamed, anger taking over from hurt with every word, bloody hormones, bloody Sherlock!
“Take good care of your papa for me. Daddy will come back when he’s sure you’re safe. I promise.” Wiping the tears from his eyes Sherlock straightened and took one last look at his daughter before turning to make his way out of the room. He was stopped by a hand griping his coat sleeve and all the blood drained from his face.
"Might not have to." Then the person on the other end of the phone answered and Sherlock’s whole demeanour changed to one of forced sincerity.
"Yes it's so simple, submissive, desperate to please any Alpha's like Mrs Hudson and I, hardly used for anything really challenging; mine is dominant and sharp, like a rocket tearing itself to pieces, stuck on a launch pad. I NEED A CASE!!" He screamed at last and John had reached the end of his patience.
. Even more so with Sherlock’s scent still mixing with his own uniqueness, of course the Beta woman wouldn’t be able to smell it on John because of her useless Beta senses but still, it made him happy to know that John hadn’t washed it off yet.
Mrs. Hudson was waiting for John by the gates of the cemetery with a cab and Sherlock sent a small wave of thanks towards the woman for taking care of John in his absence, Sherlock supposed that was a small comfort to him, knowing that no matter what, John always had people around him who loved him and looked after him. Even Mycroft, though Sherlock was sure John would never believe that and could care less but regardless of John’s thoughts on his brother, Mycroft would always look out for John, always have some form of protection nearby his mate and that soothed Sherlock’s aching Alpha instincts, though the chemical suppressants Mycroft had given him were also a huge help.
"Arg! That was this morning, when's the next one?" Sherlock flipped his legs down and started stomping his feet off the floor making John cringe.
Sherlock had been alarmed in the first week after their bonding at his desperate need to cling to John and he ended up consulting one of the many Alpha/Omega books John had forced upon him when they got home. He discovered that his need was a combination of the newness of the bond telling him to keep John close for a period of time until the bond settled which could be anything from three weeks to three months and the Alpha in him telling him to protect his mate and child from any and all dangers, the first was sure to dissipate soon but the later, well, that could be a while yet.
The Alpha nosed around for another couple of minutes before placing a kiss on the hot skin beneath his lips and rose to his feet, John raised an eyebrow in question.
Sherlock hadn’t stopped when John did and he was too busy shaking hands with a man in front of a black 4x4 to notice John wasn't at his side. It wasn't until the man handed the detective the keys to the car that Sherlock noticed John had fallen behind so he turned to look over at him, exasperated.
"You go on ahead Henry, we'll follow later." He instructed to the man behind him who was even more confused than before and looking up at the door the detective just left through and scrambling to his feet.
"Sherlock! That wasn’t very friendly; that kid’s world has just been blown apart... no pun intended." John cringed at his own poor choice of words and smacked Sherlock on the back of the head when the man snorted.
"So where are we off to anyway? It’s still a ways to Dartmoor, shall we call a cab." John asked when they walked out onto the street, Sherlock just huffed and started walking towards the car park.
"Very well, how long will it take for you to make the call?" Sherlock asked, breath hitching when John leaned in to return the favour to Sherlock’s neck.
"Sherlock! Wha-" John never finished before Sherlock lips crashed down on his and he trailed off into a moan instead, Sherlock hummed in approval and deepened the kiss, pushing John back against the steering wheel and accidentally honking the car horn. They giggled at the sound and kissed passionately, grabbing at hair and biting along each other’s necks but always going back to the sweet press of lips, Sherlock was about to try his luck at getting John naked right this second in the car when the little Omega pulled back from the kiss to hiss in pain, startling the detective.
. The thought of it turned Sherlock’s stomach but one must do what one must do... later though, much, much,
." Sherlock said viciously, sounding absolutely disgusted by the idea and that cut deeper than any other cruel act Sherlock had inflicted upon him that day. No matter if Sherlock didn’t want to share John’s heat and bond with him, no matter that Sherlock’s instincts ran hot and cold, leading John on and pushing him away again and no matter that it was Sherlock’s Alpha pride that had pushed the man to harm John physically,
"Can you hold onto me so I can get us out of the bath?" He asked the man and John hummed an affirmative and gripped onto Sherlock as tightly as he could, which admittedly wasn’t very tight at all but it would suffice. Sherlock made sure his hold on John was firm and then slowly stood up to step over the rim of the bath and carry John back into the bedroom to lay him on the bed. Once he was certain that John was comfortable he pulled away to head back to the bathroom but was stopped when John’s hand snapped out to grab his wrist.
Speaking of those things, Sherlock was startled when he noticed John sitting in the local cemetery all by himself, it was only 8:15am and John should still be asleep right now or at least having breakfast. Sherlock stared at John for a bit and suddenly all the words he had planned to say to the man left him in a rush, all the words he’s thought about suddenly became unworthy and Sherlock had no idea what to say but he knew he couldn’t just leave, he had to do something and he had to do it now or he may lose any chance of ever making John his. Sherlock swallowed down the dryness in his throat, opening the squeaky gate and proceeding up the path to where John was sat flipping through his notebook.
A girl. Sherlock had a daughter, the detective gave a sharp relived laugh at the news, startling Anthea in the process but he couldn’t care less, Sherlock was a father to a baby girl, nothing else mattered in that moment, except of course…
"What is it John? What’s wrong with you?" Sherlock growled frustrated that he couldn’t help his partner.
"Bluebell, John! I've got Bluebell, The case of the vanishing, glow-in-the-dark rabbit! NATO's in uproar." He directed the last part at Henry who just looked between them both confused.
. Do you have some sort of an arrangement?" Henry asked blushing and John just cleared his throat and pulled open the front door giving a short answer.
?" Mycroft sniffed and John could hear the Beta’s trademark smugness over the phone, it almost made him roll his eyes but instead the Doctor let out a squeak all when he felt Sherlock’s hand grab his arse and slapped the man on the chest.
"Time for breakfast don’t you think? You haven’t eaten properly for days and you’re pregnant now so you’ll have to eat as soon as possible to ensure the child gets their nutrients to start growing." He ordered and John, too happy from the news that he was pregnant with Sherlock’s child and that Sherlock wanted the baby nodded in agreement and stood to get dressed. He winced though when he finally noticed how sticky he was and at the feeling of dried up come between his cheeks and then he remembered his reason for going in the bathroom in the first place was to get supplies to treat his and Sherlock’s wounds, he knew Sherlock’s inner Alpha wasn’t going to like him postponing breakfast but some things were necessary in life.
was he angry? Because he was confused, he was being pulled back and forth by his own mind and because he couldn’t decide what he wanted, John had paid the price, paid the price for only being who he was. Although, when he had wrapped his arms around John’s body and pulled him against his own, he hadn’t been confused, it was the first and only time in his life he had willingly given into his instinct to protect any Omega in distress and why? Because John was
"Okay...okay..." John stood to face the smug Alpha smiling at him, then proceeded to retrieve the hidden cigarettes from under the skull and toss them to the prat, who just tossed them over his Shoulder.
, unfortunately for John’s sanity, always began with a pregnancy test, regardless of the fact they knew he was pregnant or not. Sherlock had told John to just see to his own care since he was, in fact, a Doctor himself and John remembered spending hours trying to explain to his lover that treating and prescribing for himself would be
Fortunately for the consulting detective Baskerville had just come into view and he had to drag himself out of his confusing thoughts, he’d need to be firing on all cylinders for this one or risk getting them shot, something told him that, that would make John just a
Sherlock was obviously very displeased with the situation and because of his rising boredom and dwindling patience, his inner Alpha was becoming very agitated which of course lead to more bullet holes in the wall and a few extra nasty surprises hidden around the kitchen for poor, unsuspecting, jam loving flat mates to come across much to their horror and displeasure.
Sherlock’s eyes refocused and he realized he was pulling up in front of Henry’s house, he must have set himself on auto pilot whilst he analysed his situation; he did tend to drift when he was preoccupied. The car had barely stopped before John was jumping out and marching off towards the conservatory entrance, bad move, Sherlock’s Alpha instincts had been running wild all day and any kind of assertive move John made would be considered a challenge by this point. For example Sherlock didn’t like being lead, it was the Alpha who was always in front so he put his long legs to good use and stomped up in front of John, glancing down at John over his Shoulder reproachfully.
"What was all that about the rabbit?" Sherlock just smirked and pulled up his coat collar and John scoffed, drawing his attention.
Whilst he concentrated on the task of removing John’s shirt the blonde seemed content to just nuzzle and snuffle at Sherlock’s hair, however as soon as Sherlock had worked John’s shirt off from his Shoulders to rest on the bed sheets he was startled by a loud moan of relief from John and pulled back to check on him. John’s head was tossed back and the man was panting in quick short breaths, Sherlock just stared until John’s hand started pawing at Sherlock’s, trying to get the detective to continue his task of undressing him.
"Well for two reasons. 1) Mycroft was here, he had some people going through that Frankland blokes work and he wanted to *ahem* discuss some of what happened with me because you two were
"No, not now, okay." John murmured and left quickly. Sherlock groaned and sat down on the bed, he hadn't meant to hurt John, he really didn't but he wasn't used to '
Just as they were approaching the door a military 4x4 pulled up and a soldier jumped out and addressed Sherlock.
What if he’d just decided to abandon his possessions and return to London anyway? Or worst of all; what if John had gone into heat and was being mounted by an Alpha? An Alpha who
"Sherlock, I tire of these games, would you just tell me what is going on?" Mycroft gritted out and a crash came from the kitchen where Mrs. Hudson had retreated to, to make some tea.
"Sherlock?! Wha- Mmmmm!" John’s protest drifted off into a moan when Sherlock bent over him and bit him firmly on the back of his neck, his whole body that was tensed for resistance suddenly felt boneless and a purr fell from his lips when the big Alpha’s hands slammed down on either side of his head. Sherlock seemed to be unsatisfied with this position though so he ended up reaching one arm down John’s body and pulled him up on his knees so his arse was pressed against Sherlock’s crotch, this made the Alpha moan and his teeth pressed a little harder against John’s flesh, just one more push away from breaking the skin.
. God knows he loved John and all of his instincts screamed at him to stay close and protect his pregnant mate but he couldn’t do
"Sorry, bit of a problem with one of the kegs. How can I help?" Greg gave an internal sigh of relief and flashed his badge, asking to speak with the owner in private. Billy’s face went an interesting shade of green and he called out for Gary who came over and after looking at the DI invited him back into a sitting room. Sherlock went to follow the DI, violent intentions swirling around in his head but was stopped when John reached out and grabbed his arm.
. It happened, there’s no changing that and it helped me realize some things that I hadn’t considered before so please, just don’t say anything." Sherlock nodded and he licked his lips when John’s hand fell, he could taste him, it was nice.
do, I’ve seen you looking." Sherlock finished and pressed back in but John just turned his head to the side.
"Well, I’ve not been idle, Sherlock. I think I might have found something, here. Didn’t know if it was relevant; starting to look like it might be. That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant."
just made me admit to something I’ve been denying since I met you. Now I don’t expect your reciprocation so don’t worry. You don’t want any kind of bond anyway." The last part came out unintentionally sounding like a question and John took Sherlock’s shocked silence as an answer and smiled sadly.
it was in the sugar." John insisted and Sherlock couldn’t take the weight of his mate’s inquisitive stare and looked away before making a show of checking his watch.
"My plan needs darkness, reckon we’ve got another couple hours of light-" Fletcher growled at him and addressed John again.
"Is that it? It’s not exactly proof, is it?" Fletcher frowned and then showed the picture to John, who bent forward slightly to see it, the Alpha holding the phone looked pleased until Sherlock opened his mouth again.
to Sherlock, John was his whole world, why had that thought never crossed his mind before? Oh! It has though, hasn't it? When he had stripped a horrible green parker decorated with C4 from John’s body calling ‘
"We need to get you back to the pub, back to our room so you can be somewhere warm and comfortable." Sherlock explained when John whined at the loss of his Alpha’s body, John whimpered again when Sherlock pulled back to sit properly in his seat and followed Sherlock over so he could rub his cheek on the man’s shoulder whilst the detective started the car and began the trip back to ‘
Sherlock had the feeling he was going to absolutely love being a father... after all with entertainment like this; it was hard to think otherwise.
The file also included information about the village he was going to, Sherlock just nodded and passed the time reading through the file until they reached their destination, where upon Sherlock got out to switch into the Audi Mycroft had acquired him for his journey.
"Aren’t you going to invite us in?" Sherlock asked warningly when he sensed a question brewing and Henry swallowed and nodded.
"John?" Sherlock called, panicking when he noticed his mate’s absence at his side, he breathed a sigh of relief when John’s head popped around a corner of rails filled with baby clothes.
"Okay so I don’t officially have a licence but I can drive John, I’m not stupid." The Alpha huffed and John scoffed, shaking his head.
"We need food Sherlock, I’m pregnant now, I can’t just live off of dim-sum and pasta at Angelo’s every couple of days like you do, I need a diet of healthy, regular meals. Trust me on this Sherlock, I’m a Doctor." John had smiled at him in the back of the cab as he told him this and Sherlock had reluctantly agreed, after all they had to go to the chemists anyway to collect John’s prescription, even so, that still didn’t stop him voicing his displeasure about the whole idea all the way to the shops.
Sherlock never knew he had a hair pulling kink before but when John tugged his head back to lay kisses and licks on the long expanse of pale flesh he called a neck, he almost came.
"Is it?" Sherlock for his part was shocked; he couldn’t believe Lestrade had a first name. How odd. Speaking of the DI, he was shaking his head in
"Too late! I already know and am in the process of deleting it vigorously, you and my brother doing half of what John and I were doing is enough to put me off eating for life." Sherlock drawled as he sat back down beside John, closer than he had before so Lestrade knew to keep his distance and he tossed an arm over John’s shoulder just for good measure. John rolled his eyes but leaned his head on Sherlock’s shoulder making the Alpha rumble out a pleased noise. Lestrade let out a groan both at Sherlock’s words and his possessive gestures.
"I wouldn't pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr. Chatterjee. He's got a wife in Doncaster that nobody knows about, well nobody except me." He finished smugly.
"Oh, I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn’t prove you’d seen the Hound." Sherlock taunted but Fletchers eyes never moved from John’s, he winked at the Doctor then jabbed a finger at Sherlock.
’ as they walked up and down the aisles at ASDA. He was about to just sneak off and leave his husband to it having reached his limit but when he looked at John, he looked so happy, so content and so reassured that with Sherlock there to battle with the chip and pin machine he would be able to get the shopping done in peace for a change so the detective once again resisted the urge to phone Molly and tell her to prepare a body for a good whipping.
"It's nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren't listening. Baskerville: Ever heard of it?" Sherlock asked and John pouted a little at the change of subject, Sherlock had to hold back the smile that was threatening to break free at the cuteness of the whole affair. My, my, wasn't he just full of John related responses today, how
people’s children, I can guarantee you that I would never act so coldly to my own child." Despite his assurance, John was still looking at him warily.
That was when Sherlock spotted ‘The Cross Keys’ and turned to go down towards it, as they drove down to the car park around the back of the cottagey looking B&B, they noticed a large group of people crowded around a young man, John looked curiously at them but Sherlock only flicked his eyes to them for a second.
If you asked Sherlock how he had gotten up those stairs so fast, he honestly wouldn’t be able to answer you, all that he knew was, he was sitting downstairs contemplating this nightmare and the next his ear was pressed to his own room door, listening for sounds of anything untoward going on. When he didn’t hear anything, Sherlock gently eased the door open, stuck his head around it and breathed a great sigh of relief. John was alone, sound asleep on the left side of the bed facing the right, Sherlock slid his whole body into the room and closed the door just as gently as he’d opened it. He then toed of his shoes and tossed his coat and suit jacket over a chair by the bathroom door. It wouldn’t do to climb into bed like he would do a runner if John twitched.
have!" He looked up at Sherlock and asked frantically but Sherlock pressed him back against his chest and held him tight, placing a soothing kiss on top of John’s head.
It was fortunate for Willis that just as Sherlock had been about to scream at him and deduce his life to shreds, the detective caught sight of the familiar sight of the London outskirts and he sighed and slumped down in his seat.
you inside me, now!" He strained and John’s eyes went wide but he nodded all the same, Sherlock reached beneath his pillows for the bottle of half-empty lube he kept there and John raised an eyebrow when Sherlock tossed it down to him .
Thank you to every single person who has supported this fic with comments and kudos and of course if you’re new to this then welcome  I hope you all enjoy this either way.
?" Sherlock spat the DI’s name like it was the most disgusting thing he’d ever tasted and squeezed John hard against his chest. John was
"But what if it’s not a word? What if it is individual letters?" He answered and showed the edited page to his partner and just like that, John caught on to what Sherlock was getting at.
"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you...! You... wonderful... sexy... gorgeous... genius of a man.... I’m having your baby!" Sherlock was just about to suggest another way that John could thank him when an embarrassing rumble sounded from the pregnant man’s belly making Sherlock’s protective instincts kicked in.
"Clearly." John snorted and started kissing up Sherlock’s body from his hip up to his lips, they shared a lazy kiss until John couldn’t hold himself up anymore.
"Right." John finally said, sadness and hurt creeping into his tone and followed Henry and Sherlock into the kitchen.
This was intolerable, Sherlock was just one more coy smile away from stomping over there and punching that woman in the face and he didn’t give a rats arse
"Hmm. Yes we need to have a little chat about that." John drawled, a little amused at the Alpha's display of affection and Sherlock stopped moving to look over his shoulder.
Sherlock closed his eyes and licked his lips, tasting a mixture of himself and John there. He moaned low and John whimpered in return making Sherlock swallow and nudge his nose against John’s, at some point during their kiss, their hips had pressed together and Sherlock could feel John’s hardness pressing against his own. Contrary to popular belief Sherlock did get erections and he did masterbate, quite enthusiastically actually, he just was never interested in sharing a sexual experience with another human being, until now that is. He pressed his hips forward against John’s and his head slipped down to rest on John’s shoulder, John yelped and pressed back, sliding one hand up to pull Sherlock’s hair and the other down to grab his arse.
John smirked as he thought about all the naughty things he and Sherlock had been up to since their wedding night and his fingers toyed with the platinum band that adorned his finger, it was decidedly more feminine than the slightly larger ring on Sherlock’s finger but John didn’t really care because the sight of that ring on Sherlock’s finger was both unbelievably reassuring and a
." Henry snarled and got up to leave, Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him, the ignorant bastard, how dare he ignore John, it was a valid question.
"Virgin? You mean that was your first time? Oh God, Sherlock If I’d known I woul-" Sherlock silenced his panicked rant with a kiss.
"John? What’s wrong? Are you injured? Did I hurt you?" The Alpha questioned, frantically running his hands along John’s body searching for any injuries his little love might have sustained, when his hands brushed over John’s lower abdomen the doctor gasped and grabbed at Sherlock’s hands, holding them there and moving them to stroke gently at the area.
"Are you laughing at me Mr Holmes?" He asked and swallowed, Sherlock looked back at him and smirked, raising his eyebrows.
! Will you just spit it out already?" Sherlock growled and Greg twitched, looking between the consulting detective and John.
"Look, we were just trying to give things a bit of a boost, you know? A great big dog run wild up on the moor – it was heaven-sent. It was like us having our own Loch Ness Monster." Gary said trying to appeal to Lestrade, trying to explain but the DI just looked appalled.
"Yes but they were-." Sherlock was having none of it though and just dismissed him before standing up to head into his room to retrieve his dressing gown that he had needlessly abandoned for this pointless exercise.
"Over here. Hey Sherlock you have got to come and see this, it’s so cute." John grinned and then disappeared back around the corner before Sherlock could protest. Sherlock rolled his eyes and marched around to where John was to dump the bags of shopping on the floor before his mate, he opened his mouth to tell John he was leaving to go to Bart’s for a while but stopped when he saw what John held in his hands. It was a miniature version of the cream jumper John had, Sherlock
Sherlock swallowed at the end of his speech, never having voiced so much emotion in his life, he was well aware that it was entirely out of character for him but he didn’t care, his relationship with John and their child was on the line here and he wouldn’t lose them because of something so trivial as a misunderstanding. He couldn’t bear to look at John throughout his speech though lest he lost his bottle so when John slid a hand across his cheek to guide his eyes back to his own Sherlock was shocked to see tear tracks painted across John’s face and the man sniffling.
them as a matter of fact so John was sure that him being pregnant would put Sherlock off, maybe even make the man leave him despite the newness of their bond but now... John wasn’t sure he was right. Sherlock was acting like John would leave
Sherlock pouted at the text and glanced back up to Dr. Mortimer, She was a Beta, average looking but definitely John’s type, Sherlock didn’t like it but he sent a picture of her to John nonetheless, after all, when John turned up to schmooze her, Sherlock would be hiding in a corner out of sight, making sure she kept her dirty Beta hands to herself.
"Fine. Now how about I prove to you I can drive. If I can manoeuvre us out of the car park will you let me drive us to Dartmoor please?" John frowned at the suggestion but still threw his hands up and agreed.
"SHERLOCK!" John roared, finally getting his mate’s attention and then blushed when he saw the other people in the waiting room give them an odd look. Sherlock huffed and pouted at John’s irritated shout of his name causing John to roll his eyes, he really hated it when Sherlock got all sulky, still at least the man was quiet now.
"You head back to the pub and I’ll make sure Henry gets home alright." John told him and then turned to head in the direction of Grimpen with Henry in tow but Sherlock stopped him with a hand on the shoulder.
"Uh. Sorry but is he always like that?" Henry asked as he finished up the cigarette he'd been smoking since he’d sat back down after Sherlock's deduction of his morning, John's head flew around startled, he'd forgotten Henry was there.
"I saw it too." Sherlock said trembling, okay now he was frightening John, Sherlock Holmes never trembled.
"Give me, the keys, John." He repeated slowly, Sherlock didn’t know what was wrong with him, he never acted so aggressively with such mundane arguments like this, all that he did know was that John was telling him ‘
"You don’t punish yourself and let me take care of this." Sherlock nodded fiercely making John smile and then he helped the doctor open his trousers to pull his cock out and my
Omega who was trying so very hard not to look at the tiny fluffy jumpers to their left and it made Sherlock smile, John clearly wanted to go on a little shopping spree in here despite his words to the contrary but Sherlock knew he couldn’t handle any more so he came up with a compromise, even if it would probably come back to bite him in the arse later.
"Three hours? Maybe four?" He confessed looking guilty, Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the expression shifted John gently in his lap so he could get a good look at the Omega.
"Well I was just... I didn’t know you two were well... I had an idea but you two obviously weren’t together three months ago and well..." Greg made an awkward hand gesture and blushed, looking away again. John knew why he was blushing and it wasn’t because he was with Sherlock now, speaking of the devil, Sherlock’s eyes had narrowed, clearly he had picked up on the one part of that statement that could doom him and Greg.
"Thought so." he sighed and Sherlock swallowed, moisture finally returning to his mouth from the shock, of course he didn't want a bond... or maybe. No. He
Plus Sherlock had said he hadn’t seen anything either and he was with Henry so John could only assume that the poor man was just so traumatised from the ordeal he had suffered as a child, that he was seeing things.
"Hey, you should find yourself a better Alpha. Lovely little Omega like you." Fletcher growled seductively and John's eyelids drooped, he was just about to reply when Sherlock practically screeched his name from beside their car, John shook his head and blushed apologetically at Fletcher before walking quickly and uncomfortably over to Sherlock who was oddly enough standing with the back door of the 4x4 open.
be another Alpha for me; you’re the only Alpha I’ve ever wanted to belong to. I love you." John could hear the gulp Sherlock took to swallow the lump in his throat from the affectionate proclamation and leaned in to cover the small space between their lips to give Sherlock a sweet peck. Sherlock deepened the little kiss into something more substantial but kept up the slow affectionate aura of it and they sat there like that with John straddling Sherlock’s thighs in the front seat of a 4x4, under the cover of trees and darkness. Eventually, John pulled back with a wince as another bout of cramps, much more powerful than the last, hit him and Sherlock gently shifted John back over to the passenger’s seat.
. The adorable Omega looked so peaceful in his sleep, his body rising and falling slowly, his hair sticking up all over the shop and the little, barely there snore was just hilarious. Sherlock couldn’t hold in the snort that escaped him and unintentionally disturbed John who stopped snoring and started shuffling and wriggling closer to Sherlock. The cunning detective saw an opportunity here and rolled over to lay on his back, arm raised in the air, John took the bait and ended up with his head pillowed on Sherlock’s lean chest and his arm tossed across the man’s abdomen, it was amazing. Sherlock wrapped his own arms around John, one over his waist and the other cradling his head, fingers shifting through John’s hair in a soothing motion to coax him back into a deeper sleep, it worked like a charm.
"Hang on – you were saying "Sorry" a minute ago. Don’t spoil it. Go on: what have I done that’s so bloody stimulating?" Sherlock who had been writing on his notepad, looked up under his curls and gave John a filthy smirk, John blushed, okay, perhaps he should have worded that better considering what they were just doing not five minutes ago. The Alpha huffed in amusement at John’s red face and took pity on him, showing him what was written on the pad.
"Sherlock, I’m fine, promise." Sherlock pulled back gently to look at John and determine if he was being truthful but what he saw there must’ve satisfied him because he nodded at John however he still dropped to his knees and lifted John’s clothes out of the way so he could nose around his stomach. John’s eyes softened along with his smile as he carded a hand through Sherlock’s hair and let his mate nuzzle and sniff at his belly for as long as he needed, Sherlock did this multiple times a day now and it always made John feel warm inside.
"We forgot a condom y’know." Sherlock huffed amused at John and wrapped himself around the man who was now laying on his chest.
"What things?" Sherlock asked huskily and John looked like he was just going to ignore Sherlock and go back to the quiet awkwardness they seemed to have been trying to master all day.
A dark head of curls flew back against the cushioning beneath it and the owner moaned loud and proud at the burn in his thigh muscle, he loved the feel of  the burning stretch, combined with the feel of John’s cock it was just heaven. It didn’t take long for them to work themselves back up to the edge and John’s hand flew down to start tugging at Sherlock’s cock. Only another ten seconds past before Sherlock let out a shriek and blew his load up the side of John’s jumper, the rhythmic twitching and clenching around his cock set John off a moment after Sherlock and the man beneath him sighed at the feel of John’s hot come filling him up. Sherlock’s leg that was suspended over John’s shoulder fell to the floor when John pulled back to sprawl in the space behind him, somewhat mimicking Sherlock’s position.
“I was not lurking, I just wanted to make sure he was ok… to see him once more before I…” Sherlock choked and trailed off causing Mycroft’s sneering expression to soften. The elder Holmes placed an awkward hand over his younger brother’s shoulder and squeezed gently.
"You’ve got ID for Baskerville? How." John whispered breaking the silence at last, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief; it seemed that John was doing that thing where he pretended to forget when Sherlock had done something wrong.
"Actually, why don’t you two just head back and get some rest, I need some time to clear my head anyway so I don’t mind the walk." John looked at him surprised and was about to insist they give him a lift but Sherlock was already tugging him in the direction of the 4x4 before he could open his mouth.
"You said so on that case we had with the Alpha who murdered his wife." Sherlock’s eyes widened, strange that they should both take reference form that case.
“And you were doing so well there Mycroft, very well, where am I heading first?” Sherlock sighed leaning back and crossing his legs as the car started to move.
spot behind John’s ear, the doctor's hips bucked up harshly and he choked on the protest that was trying to break past his lips.
"About earlier, I-" John’s had moved quickly through the air and he pressed two fingers against Sherlock’s plump lips.
Omega and Sherlock was better than his base instincts so he pushed that feeling away and tried a different route.
"Besides I know the real reason you hate train travel so much, it’s because you sister lost you on one when you were eight. They make you nervous, the longer the journey, the more nervous you get." Sherlock deduced correctly, if John’s sputtering was anything to go by.
in the taxi?" He asked, Sherlock just smiled again and stepped forward to pull John against him, he felt so nice fitted against Sherlock’s body, all warm and solid.
By the time Sherlock had pulled into the car park at the pub, John was shifting restlessly against his seat and tugging at his clothes, the Omega had already managed to shuck off his coat, jumper and had half unbuttoned his shirt before Sherlock could reach over to stop him from undressing further.
"Humph! So you can get something for my discomfort but I get threatened with homicide for offering to get you pain killers?"
"Sherlock! Please! Fuck me, breed me and give me your knot!" John cried and any control over the Alpha instinct that Sherlock had was tossed out the window violently.
"You being all mysterious with your cheekbones and turning your coat collar up so you look cool." John grumbled as he jumped into the car, Sherlock’s mouth moved with no sound for a moment completely speechless.
be doing it again." Yes she will but Sherlock won’t tell her, he just hummed an affirmative and walked back through to the living room with her where Mycroft was still nursing a cup of tea.
"Then we can go home and have sex on the couch?" Sherlock asked hopefully and John blushed, thanking every God in creation that the hallway was empty, this was one of the downsides to Sherlock’s newly discovered libido combined with his lack of social cues but still that addictive personality his mate had could also be very satisfying when the need arose... especially since the need arose quite often. John cleared his throat to chase away the filthy thoughts that were clouding his mind and braced himself from the massive blow back of bursting Sherlock’s bubble.
it?" Sherlock asked as he approached the cage John was hiding in and paused when he saw John move forward to peek out the crack, he heard John start to deny it but then he trailed off.
"Don’t be silly John, your arse is as perky as it normally is." Sherlock teased and chuckled when John growled at him and flipped him the V.
"Sherlock, what are the chances of the bathroom being just as destroyed as this room?" John asked, dreading the answer.
"Eh, sorry we couldn’t do a double room for you boys." Gary said loudly and handed over the keys, John was never happier for a distraction in his entire life, he hated this part of his heat. All unbonded Omega's went through it, this sort of '
’ of yours may just give you what you’re asking for." John stuttered out nervously, Sherlock huffed in affection at John’s transparency and then lowered his head down so his lips were a breath away from John’s.
To be honest it wasn’t even necessary for his Alpha to be here but Sherlock had insisted he go with John, proclaiming ‘
"Clearly." Sherlock drawled and stared for a few moments before making his way back down the rocks, by the time he reached the bottom, John was already back in the car, he looked upset. Sherlock sighed in resignation at what he was about to do and strode over to the car, got in and sat for a moment.
make you happy?" Throughout his speech John had slid his hands up and over Sherlock’s thighs, stroking up and down and massaging the tense muscles ‘til Sherlock was a mass of relaxed, deeply satisfied Alpha.
"Right! Off we go then." John sniffed and turned to look out the window, Sherlock watched him for a moment and then started the car. Could this situation get any more complicated?
Sherlock dropped the little bag on the bed followed by his coat and scarf whilst he looked around the room for a temporary hiding place but he clearly underestimated Mrs. Hudson’s unpacking skills though because she was finished in a quarter of the time he had suspected she would take and he panicked when he heard the old Alpha’s high heels approaching. Acting fast he tossed the little bag under the bed and marched out the door before she could barge in.
"... Then the next morning Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of forced entry...Ah! What am I saying? This is brilliant, phone Lestrade, tell him there's an escaped rabbit." John looked at Sherlock like he'd finally gone mad and to be honest there was a good chance that was true.
but he just couldn’t help turning his head and kissing Sherlock softly, The dark haired man hummed in appreciation and deepened the kiss, sliding his tongue past John’s lips and stroking along the doctors. John’s hands unconsciously started stroking the soft, pale flesh beneath them and shifted around to grab at Sherlock’s plump arse, Sherlock gave a filthy moan, proving that there was no way he could keep quiet. John was just about to pull back but Sherlock whined and ducked his head to bite at
"Yes, well, I just thought that I should at least get one thing for the baby, it was only polite." Sherlock sniffed, John’s grin softened. If this was Sherlock’s way of contributing then he wasn’t going to make fun of him for that, this tiny scarf was the beginning of Sherlock proving just what a fantastic father he would be.
"Yes, I know but I will be fine John, now here take my card; something tells me this will be expensive." John couldn’t hold back his excitement when Sherlock pulled out his wallet and he took the card gratefully before launching himself onto Sherlock for a filthy snog making Sherlock moan and his eyes roll back in his head. They kissed for a good five minutes before John pulled back to reveal a small string of saliva connecting their lips, Sherlock just about popped one when John licked it up and whispered against his lips.
"I’m cold." He defended and John smirked a little bit, it was only late August. When they entered the charming little Pub they were greeted by a large, smiling Scotsman behind the bar.
"Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one." John looked up at him again, a low Omega growl rumbling in his chest and his knife hand twitched, Sherlock swallowed and backtracked... with dignity.
"Jesus Christ... It was the hound, Sherlock. It was here. I swear it, Sherlock. It must..." Sherlock stood up and reached for the terrified Omega.
"Brilliant!" John scoffed and Sherlock looked over at him, okay so maybe he was wrong, John, was in fact, still upset and now looking a little distressed.
"What do you mean ‘I am’? You can’t even drive!" John yelled, pulling the keys out and shoving them in his pocket as he leaped back out of the car.
"Oi! We’re here!" The cabbie called and John startled awake in Sherlock’s arms, he glared at the loud man, if only he had his riding crop. John pulled away from Sherlock and looked at him confused, Sherlock just smiled and gestured for him to get out of the cab.
him. That was the moment he gave in and let his mind pull him in one direction, Sherlock shoved away all his fears, all his anxieties, all his doubts about heats and bonding and decided that yes, just like John said Sherlock was the only one for him, John was the only one for Sherlock and he wanted, actually
! Before the man did something he would regret. Sherlock, sensing the Omega beneath him was distressed instinctively tried to soothe him by running his tongue along the underside of John’s jaw, unfortunately it had the opposite effect and John nearly jumped a foot in the air.
Mind made up, John stood up slowly and started making his way over to the flashing light in the distance, this time without Sherlock striding by his side.
"Perhaps..." He mumbled looking away and thought about the way John had gone down on him earlier to let a blush stain his cheeks. John smiled at him and took the offered coffee, taking a sip, Sherlock looked on pleased but then John winced and pulled back.
John’s eyes popped open and he flipped over to his hands and knees again, face pressed against the seat fabric.
"Oh, sorry, so you're not coming then?" He asked trying to understand the situation, Sherlock took this opportunity to pointedly direct an over exaggerated, put upon pout towards John, the bastard. It took John a second before it dawned on him what Sherlock was doing and he sighed.
Sherlock frowned, that wasn’t right, his Omega should be leaning into him and bearing his neck in pleasure, not jumping away as if afraid of him. Sherlock tried again, this time nuzzling John’s neck and rubbing his shoulders but that was when he heard the jingle of keys falling on the ground. John had sneakily pulled the car keys from his pocket and dropped them. Sherlock’s grip slackened when he looked down to see what the noise was and John made use of the distraction by shoving the Alpha hard and jumping away, Sherlock snarled at the Omega’s disobedience, teeth bared and pupils blown wide and reading himself to pursue John again but stopped dead when John called his name.
entrance all eyes in the room shot over to the Omega purring and shifting in his arms, several Alphas including
, a crack ran along the side of the bath, a chunk of the sink was missing and the toilet seat had been ripped off and was in three separate pieces on the floor, not to mention the granite counter surrounding the sink had some...
"Why would I tell you if I did? ‘Scuse me." He said and started to get up but stopped when the scent of a pre-heat Omega hit his nose and he looked up just in time to see John striding over with a drink.
.’ that’s if we don’t get shot." John mocked and grumbled, Sherlock was about to reply when the guard came back over to return the ID card.
incompetent, we’ve been waiting here for these pointless test results longer than it takes Anderson to come up with a witty retort, in fact I’m still waiting for
"Shop!" Although, maybe the detective was just subconsciously acting like that because of the change in John’s scent seeing as he hadn't taken the birth control that morning, he hadn't seen the point at the time since he’d assumed he was heading back to London, Sherlockless.
"Ok, I've looked there twice now and I can't see it! So ... Where is it John?" Sherlock growled and John smirked, happy to notice something that Sherlock didn’t for a change and strode lazily over to the open wardrobe in Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock wasn't far behind and appeared just in time to see John pull out the folded, purple Shirt from the shelf at the bottom.
"Cigarettes? What've you done with them? Where are they?" He asked impatiently as he continued to rummage around the fire place.
"Minefield? Technically Baskerville’s an army base, so I guess they’ve always been keen to keep people out." John hypothesized.
"Well... it’s an awfully rare condition but when Omegas are in the last twenty-four hours of pre-heat we’re supposed to start preparations, y’know like eating plenty, stocking up on pain killers, finding a suitable place to bunk down for the day but most importantly; we have to remain relaxed. ‘Cause of our hormones going all over the place we need to avoid anything stressful or upsetting, else it can cause a rapid heat like he’s going through right now. Never experienced one myself but I’ve heard that it can be very uncomfortable, it looks like he can’t even talk right now ‘cause of it." Sherlock’s eyes snapped back to John who was still purring and cooing and twitching away on the bed and he realized that since he’d set John back in the passenger’s seat of the car, the man hadn’t said one word. Billy noticed Sherlock looking at John concerned and rushed to reassure the Alpha.
“John, Molly, take me to John.” Sherlock snapped, he didn’t mean to be rude, after all he owed Molly a lot but the only thing on his mind right now was getting to John and his daughter, Molly seemed to understand this because she didn’t take any offence and just nodded frantically at him before leading him in the direction of the lifts.
never do anything to put our child in any danger, I will love and protect that child when they’re inside of you and I will do the same when they enter this world because that child will be
“He will be fine Sherlock, I’ll personally make sure of it and you will be back. If there’s one thing I’ve learned in the time you’ve know John Watson it’s that nothing on this earth can keep you two apart for long. Now enough of this sentimental drivel, we have work to do.” Sherlock snorted and rolled his eyes at Mycroft’s attempt of consolation.
, I’m sorry, are you alright?" God damn these Alpha urges, he never wanted to hurt John, never. Sherlock moved to take a step forward but John flinched so he stayed where he was listening to John pant and whimper against the pain he must be feeling. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to reach over and pull John close, stroke his hair, make everything alright again and this time it had nothing to do with Alpha instincts, it was just Sherlock but he didn't dare move lest he frighten John off completely.
"That’s not the bloody same, you idiot! You can’t drive a car by just reading a bloody book! It requires practical know how as well as theoretical!" John snarled and jumped back out of Sherlock’s reach.
"Ah! Here comes loves young dream. Glad to see you boys have surfaced alive and well." John blushed at the Scotsman but was smiling none the less.
smeared across it. Thankfully the little leather bag sitting on the counter behind the taps appeared to be clean and untouched but John was still wary as he manoeuvred through the mess to grab it, he was just about to turn and bolt back to the safety of the mattress when something silver that had been hiding beneath the bag caught his eye.
. You’ve nearly driven a man out of his mind." He snarled and then marched out of the place followed by John, Sherlock hung back to see the couple exchanging guilty looks and then proceeded to follow his companions out. When he got to the front door of the pub and looked out he saw John and Lestrade standing way to close and sharing a joke, his eyes narrowed at the image and he stomped over quickly to slide his body in front of John’s slightly, John sensing Sherlock’s discomfort at his closeness with the other Alpha took a step back, nodding for Greg to do the same.
"Look, as long as we solve this case quickly and get back home, I'll still be able to call ‘round Harry's, well actually... I may head to Sarah's this month since my last three heats I’ve been on my own and I'm gagging for it to be honest." John's eyes got a little glassy there at the thought of spending his heat with a real Alpha, even if it was only Sarah. Sherlock noticed the change in John’s scent and pupil dilation and growled under his breath, the possessive sound brought John out of his little hormone induced fantasy and he shrugged apologetically at Sherlock.
“I miss you too but you have to close your eyes. You need to rest so you can look after Charlotte.” Sherlock tried to coerce and started stroking over John’s arm, John just gave him a sweet smile and turned his head towards his daughter.
"No! I don’t want Lestrade, Sherlock, I want you. You’re my Alpha, just you, no one else." John soothed as he nuzzled his lovers neck, if there was one thing that surprised John, it was how aggressive Sherlock could be in regards to his ownership of John. He hadn’t expected a man who suppressed his Alpha instincts to be so, well,
"Naah. Wonder why?" Slipped out softly as John stood up and rushed away, shoving past someone in his haste to get out of this place, so much for the hope that little kiss on John’s shoulder had given him, it was obviously just one of Sherlock’s Alpha mood swings. John fell to his knees in agony once he’d made it outside, the cramping in his belly that had started earlier only getting worse due to the emotional distress he was under, he was wrong, there was a good chance his heat was due in the next twenty-four hours and if he didn’t find some way of dealing with it then who knows what could happen. John doubled over when his stomach gave a particularly violent twist, he rocked back and forth on his knees for a time until the pains past and took deep breaths and straightened up.
something but still the idea of some kind of crazy, monster, dog roaming the moors of some arsey little town in the middle of nowhere seemed highly unlikely.
“No, it’s just a dream John, close your eyes.” Sherlock whispered and sat down on the edge of the bed beside John, wishing he’d been more careful.
. John had always wanted children, he had always seen himself in the future with three or four kids wrapped around him and to have Sherlock’s children would be a dream come true but to his knowledge and by Sherlock’s own admission he
"Same as living with him except now there’s orgasms and good God! What orgasms they are." John whistled and laughed when Lestrade went green, he decided that since he’s had a mostly lovely morning he’d spare the man any further teasing, providing Lestrade did the same of course.
The only reason that Henry was still sitting here was John insisting that Sherlock hear him out and if Sherlock refused then John would be upset, Sherlock hated it when John was upset though he didn't quite understand why. He supposed it must be a friend thing, Sherlock frowned and realized he had drifted off into his mind as an escape from this tedium and grabbed the TV remote, John and Henry were fixated on the television so they didn't notice until Sherlock clicked it off.
, to share John’s heat and make them one. Sherlock had risen from his seat, tea forgotten and ignoring the strange look Henry had given him as he retrieved an ointment from the first aid kit below Henry’s sink and then proceed to the bathroom when his Omega was.
"I’m the only Alpha you’ll ever have again! Do you hear me John?! NO MORE ALPHAS!!!" Sherlock roared, thrusting in and of John rapidly, his knot pressing against John with every thrust but not quite penetrating him yet.
"No Sherlock, the question is: What the fuck are we still doing in this bloody pool?" John asked then started giggling hysterically, Sherlock looked down at John concerned and padded over to help his friend up but when he reached his hand out John jerked back and fell out of the crouch he was sitting in.
." Then there was a click and Sherlock shoved his phone in his pocket and turned so John’s back was pressed against their car before reattaching his lips to the wanton little Omega. They kissed, sucked, licked and moaned for the ten minutes that Mycroft had said it would take for arrangements to be made before the detective pulled back from John’s lips, not far though, just a breath away from touching him.
"So that must be... Yeah. Dewer’s Hollow." He said looking over at the forestry to the left of Baskerville.
"If John is shopping then what are those? Please tell me he hasn’t got you running back here whilst he has a leisurely walk through the high street?" Sherlock’s teeth were grinding so hard together you could hear it through in the living room or in the hallway as the case was when Mrs. Hudson came wandering in.
"There’s one just down the hall." John thanked him and dismounted the stool he was sitting on to shuffle off, unaware of the eyes following his every move. Once he was secured in the bathroom, John slipped of his jacket and jumper, then unbuttoned the red shirt beneath to slip that off too so he could get a look at the marks on his shoulders in the mirror behind the sink. They had already turned a painful looking purple and the bullet wound scar on his left shoulder was lit up a bright red.
"Okay, fine. Just a quick one though." John sighed, Sherlock pulled back triumphantly and slid a hand beneath John’s jacket to reach the inside pocket, John raised an eyebrow when the detective pulled a mini bottle of lube out.
"How’d that get there?" John asked whilst Sherlock shuffled back to sit on the edge of John’s knees.
." Sherlock gritted out, finally locking eyes with John. The Omega couldn’t believe what he was hearing, Sherlock had to be joking right? He tried to calm Sherlock down, tried to rationalize the situation but he obviously didn't word it properly as Sherlock took it as a criticism and lashed out at John furiously insisting there was nothing wrong with him, drawing the attention of all the diners around them and going on to prove himself by mocking John as he deduced a pair of diners sitting behind them, to the right.
"We, We’re not..." He tried, gesturing over his shoulder at Sherlock but when Gary looked at him oddly he just gave up and handed over the money, what was the point denying something that no one would listen to after all.
The urge to say “Fuck it!” and run towards John, grab him and hold him close, tell him he was sorry and that he wasn’t going anywhere was overwhelming but then a face flashed in his mind, clear as day, a face with a manic grin and insane, twinkling brown eyes. The face of the man who had threatened him and his family, his mate, his child and Sherlock’s resolve hardened once more. It didn’t matter that Moriarty had shot himself right before Sherlock’s very eyes and it didn’t matter that Mycroft’s men had taken care of the shooters trained on John, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, what mattered was that if there was even the slightest doubt in the minds of Moriarty’s followers that Sherlock was alive, they would come after him the only way their leader had taught them; through Sherlock’s heart, Sherlock’s John.
"MRS. HUDSON!!" He called and then started tearing through the files on his desk and raking through drawers all whilst pleading with John who remained unmoving in his chair.
“As you requested we are keeping you close by for the time being so we are starting you off in Scotland, Moriarty was running a drug cartel out of a small village in the highlands, we have reason to believe that all the residents of the village are involved though we can’t be sure, fortunately it is a very popular tourist destination so you’ll have no problem integrating yourself. Your task is simple, acquire data on how many are involved, remove the leader from the equation and notify me of your findings, my people will take care of the rest.” Mycroft handed Sherlock a file with new credit cards and ID’s all with the name Mr. Shane Watson printed on them just as Sherlock had requested, he had wanted to keep a piece of John with him during his little adventure and even if it was only his name, it brought Sherlock some comfort.
"And there isn’t, though, is there? ‘Cause if people knew how to make a mutant, super dog, we’d know..." Sherlock started to breathe heavily, rocking back and forth slightly and clasping and unclasping his hands.
John, hearing footsteps, looked up and his face fell when he saw who it was, he didn’t have time to deal with another one of Sherlock’s mood swings right now, he had to catch a train due in an hour and he still had to get his things and call a taxi, he stood up from the monument he was sitting on just as Sherlock cleared his throat to address him.
, John." Sherlock finished, blushing and on the edge of running away, the look on John’s face is what kept him grounded, the look of awe and, dare he think it,
"I thought you said that if you took birth control this would stop happening?" Sherlock rumbled coldly, playing with the keys, his back still turned.
Sherlock immediately moved towards the bed to lay John down, he thought he’d have another fight on his hands with detaching the needy Omega but John’s heat heightened senses drew him to his and Sherlock’s mixed scent still clinging to the bed sheets from that morning and he rolled over away from Sherlock to rub his face into the sheets. Sherlock didn’t know whether to be relived or disappointed about it.
"Think I might have taken care of that already." Sherlock snorted at John who went back to his food yet again and caught sight of Gary out the corner of his eye filling up another couples drinks. The man gave him a nervous glance when he caught Sherlock looking, the detective could see from the scuff marks on the inside of his left shoe that he’d been in to see the damage they’d done to their room. He bet the man was sorry he didn’t take up John’s offer of paying for the damages.
! That was a nightmare Sherlock! This is why I hate traveling by train, it took bloody ages and now I’ve got an arse like a pancake!" John snapped at his chuckling flatmate as they walked out of the station together.
and as far as Sherlock was concerned it was never too early to be prepared and he knew that John shared that feeling.
"Yes. I remember." Sherlock replied hoarsely. John smiled at the Alpha and dropped to the floor, crawling forward on his hands and knees like a prowling lion to situate himself between Sherlock’s spread legs. Sherlock watched the Omega’s every movement and relaxed back into the big chair with a sigh.
"No, we’ll all take the car, drop Henry off and then head back together, we have some business of our own to take care of, remember?" Sherlock drawled and his eyes locked pointedly onto John’s, Henry saw the heated look exchanged between the two men and chimed in with his own input.
"I don't need those anymore. I'm going to Dartmoor." He said victoriously and then started to head out of the living room to pack some overnight things, this shouldn't take more than two, three day's tops.
"I’ll protect you, John. I won’t let anyone else have you." John awkwardly wrapped his own arms around Sherlock’s waist and patted him on the back.
"Or a genetic experiment?" He teased and looked away hiding his amusement, clearly not well enough though as Henry still saw it and took on a hurt look.
A few minutes later Sherlock was bent over the bench laughing himself sick whilst John was trying to wake up the poor unconscious DI who had fainted into the bush behind him.
!?" Sherlock let out a deep, amused chuckle at the horrified look on his Omega’s face, John looked like he was going to have a seizure. There was water
"Now, now little brother is that any way to treat you guests?" Mycroft drawled from the comfort of Sherlock’s chair, cup of tea in one hand, umbrella balanced like a cane in the other. Sherlock’s growl didn’t let up; it only got louder, a step away from him frothing at the mouth.
"Absolutely no idea but-" Sherlock trailed off and his face contorted in confused anger when he caught sight of Lestrade, shuffling on his feet casually in the pub. Sherlock stomped off into the pub just as John had caught sight of the DI too, he made sure quickly follow in Sherlock to prevent the man from ruining his only other real friendship outside of John.
?!" Sherlock hissed and John sighed, things were going so well, he nodded at Sherlock and braced his body.
, just like that." John gritted out then buried his head against Sherlock’s neck to sniff along the white column of flesh. Sherlock frowned but did as he was told, moving his hands in soothing circular motions along John’s belly, this was fine for a few moments, in fact it looked as if John was recovering but then he felt the doctor tense in his arms and let loose a whimper. Sherlock, who was getting very worried for his companion, gently lifted up John’s jumper and Shirt to see if there was any damage but all he saw was toned, tanned flesh twitching and tensing in pain. When he rested his hands on the bare flesh to continue rubbing, John arched up and gasped loudly, the man’s skin was on fire.
"What’s that?" Sherlock asked pointing to a fenced up area between the Hollow and Baskerville, John looked through the binoculars and blinked a few times, was that a...
John snapped out of his daze when he sensed Sherlock’s unhappiness, he gazed at the man kneeling next to him, he looked like a deflated balloon and the look in his eyes was just...
Still, what was it about that puny Alpha that was setting John off?! He had to know. He could still hear John chatting away to Gary and his bonded Omega as he strutted out of the building, snatching up a half empty glass of beer on his way and sliding up behind this,
am pregnant. I’m having a baby; a real live little person is growing inside me as I speak!" Sherlock crawled back up John’s body and smiled at his mate, John looked up at him and a grin spread across his face and a giddy laugh broke free from his body. He tackled Sherlock, knocking the Alpha onto his back and started pressing kisses all over his face and praising him in between.
.’ and no more fear that John might finally get fed up and leave him. Sherlock’s eyes widened a fraction, he wasn’t actually considering-
Sherlock didn’t even dignify that with a response, mostly because he didn’t want to make a promise he couldn’t keep. The car had barely stopped before the staff entrance near the back of Bart’s hospital before Sherlock was out like a shot and running towards Molly who was grinning at him with tears in her eyes.
"Is there anything I can do for him to make it easier?" Billy smiled at that, clearly this man was a good Alpha.
"Sorry, you shouldn't've had see that." He croaked and Sherlock frowned and sat up on his knees beside John.
"Ever heard of a spot check?" The Doctor asked pulling out his wallet and flashing his army ID, shocking both the corporal and Sherlock when he suddenly went from, seemingly harmless Omega to dominating soldier Omega.
about the smell of his home but that didn’t matter because someone was here and he was now very glad he had left John back at the baby store. Sherlock carefully placed the shopping bags down when he reached the top of the stairs before the closed living room door and then counted three beats before he slammed the door open and growled.
Sherlock, am I going to have to find another Alpha to do that or will you man up and give me your knot?!" John snarled into Sherlock’s growling face, the curly haired Alpha was practically frothing at the mouth by the end of John’s little speech and gave a terrifying roar, flipping John over to mount and thrust into him until his knot pressed against John’s spread pucker causing the Omega to scream in pleasure.
"Me? Naw. Fletcher has." Both Sherlock and John followed the man's gaze when he gestured to the young Alpha still talking on his phone outside, the smell of aroused Omega hit Sherlock again and he sniffed discreetly at the air, secretly salivating over the delicious, sweet scent coming from John. Even if it did bother him to no end that John was reacting to another Alpha he couldn’t deny how delicious the scent was.
He had just pulled a jumper over his red button up and was reaching for his jacket when he remembered to take the birth control pill. He took a pack from his bedside table and popped one out to swallow, slipping the rest of the pack into his jacket pocket, he'd need those if he was going to Sarah's when he got back anyway. As a doctor John found that Omega birth control was severely lacking, it would only be effective against pregnancy if you took it right as you were going into heat, that's why John always kept a pack of condoms next to the pills, you could never be too careful.
Sherlock was so focused on the sensations that he didn’t notice the devious glint in the doctors eyes so when John pulled off the finger and flipped them over it shocked the hell out of the detective and only turned him on even more, Sherlock’s eyes were black with desire and he knew he couldn’t take much more so when John bent down to start training nips down his chest Sherlock nearly screamed.
"MOVE!" Sherlock snarled and John, whose face was a mask of concentration, pulled back and slammed forward; hard. Sherlock’s world jolted and and another animalistic moan dragged it’s way out of his body. This was how it continued for the next ten minutes, John pulling out slowly and then slamming back in with all the force he could muster, kisses and bites being exchanged as well as moans and pants of pure pleasure. Then Sherlock got impatient.
seen a hound, there was no mistaking it, he saw it with his own two eyes and his eyes had never and would never deceive him. John was the one with something wrong with him, John was the one making accusations and making out that there was something wrong with Sherlock and John... was only trying to help.
want him! He wanted Sherlock. Sherlock who was loyal, strong, innovative, resourceful and a freaking genius! And if John was honest, the best looking Alpha he’d ever come across. Any babies born from them bonding would be perfect!
"You from the papers?" He asked, his accent grating on Sherlock’s nerves, he swallowed the urge to growl at the annoying brat and continued on.
As it turned out, it proved to be easier than he expected since Henry had somewhat of a sleeping ailment the night before, which was odd because Sherlock was sure that John had told him he’d given Henry something to help him sleep. Sherlock did notice that Henry seemed a little antsier today though, still, it was no concern of his how the moron was feeling, he’d got what he wanted and made his way out and back towards the pub. He had bigger things to worry about than Henry Knight’s mood swings.
"Hi, I’m looking to book a two bed room for my friend and me." The big Alpha’s nose twitched and he looked at John knowingly, then his eyes followed Sherlock who was wandering about the place being nosey.
"John! You are amazing! You are fantastic!" Sherlock called when he pulled back and started walking a bit faster, shoving a hand into his coat to pull out his notebook. John swiped a hand over his lips to remove the slobbers Sherlock had left and followed after the Alpha.
When John entered the pub he looked around curiously for Sherlock but saw no sign of the man in the main area, Gary spotted him looking around and pointed over to the little dining room with the fire place in it, John nodded to the man and made his way through, Sherlock was sitting at one of the big chairs in front of the fire with a brandy at his side, John frowned, that was odd, Sherlock never drank, still, John made his way over to join the man.
He was about to greet Sherlock when he heard shouting coming from inside the sandwich shop and glanced over just in time to see Mrs. Hudson launch a loaf of fresh, baked bread over Mr. Chatterjee's head to crash against the glass door, making it shake with the force.
"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints, of a, gigantic hound." Henry repeated slowly and Sherlock brought his hands to his face in prayer stance.
However on the other hand, his heat was close and he could feel his body preparing for the days he would be lost to his instincts, not to mention his hormone levels were changing and fluctuating at this stage so he was emitting a scent to draw in Alphas. That could only mean that his heat could come at any time in the next five days and if he and Sherlock didn't get this case solved quickly and without incident well...
Sherlock had hissed as the nails tore over his skin and all but snarled when John grabbed him, he shoved John down hard to the bed in an effort to make him let go but John gave a growl of his own and held firm.
sorry, John." Sherlock whispered into his hair, John swallowed and tried to pull away but Sherlock’s arms just tightened across his waist, it seemed Sherlock was back into Alpha mode again, he wasn’t going to win this one with strength, he’d need to use his brain.
"Very well, I need to get back into Baskerville, today and have unlimited access to the labs." Sherlock heard his brother choking on the other side and smirked at John as he reached his hand out to pull the man against his side so he could press his ear to the back of Sherlock’s phone and listen in.
genius. To show his pleasure for John’s quick thinking he leaned over and planted a sweet kiss on the man's lips, taking no notice of the choking noises that Greg was making. When he pulled back, John was smiling at him with a blush staining his cheeks, the shorter man turned around to hit the bell on the countertop, making sure to hide his joy at the fact Sherlock had just kissed him in front of another living, breathing human being, something he was convinced Sherlock would never do.
"You have no idea." Sherlock drawled, smirking and let out a keen when John sank a finger into his body up to the second knuckle.
Sherlock strutted down the corridor towards the room where Lestrade was like the cat that’d caught the canary, he was positively radiating satisfied smugness and why shouldn’t he be after that lovely little interlude John had provided him with. The dark haired Alpha was man enough to admit he went in there with every intention of pouncing on John and marking him in a way that meant no other Alpha would come near him again,
John being the good little Omega he was, sensed his Alpha wanted more and pressed back against Sherlock, rolling his hips rhythmically. He wouldn’t be able to take penetration until his heat officially began and he started lubricating but he could still get Sherlock off like this, besides Sherlock’s knot wouldn’t be ready at this stage either. John whimpered at the thought of Sherlock fucking him and knotting him and the Alpha in question, who was now bearing down on John with hard fast thrusts of his hips, reached a hand around to John’s crotch to stroke him at the same time he started to suck and lick against the back of John’s neck, not once releasing the hold his teeth had.
"Okay fine, you can buy all the mini jumpers you like, in fact why don’t you just have a look around here for a bit and I’ll take the shopping home and ask Mrs. Hudson to put it away, we’ll just order something in tonight from Angelo’s so you can spend as much time as you want shopping in this...
Sherlock was tempted to analyse the situation further but quickly rejected the thought when John rubbed his cheek against his pectoral. Who was he to look a gift horse in the mouth?
Thanks to those urges Sherlock could do this sort of thing with John whenever he wanted, he could kiss and stroke and...
"Yes in a TV Interview, I prefer to do my own editing." He replied still in a bored tone and Henry smiled shyly and shifted again.
! Always been yours.... Always... Gouuhhh... please don’ sto’!" John panted shoving his arse rhythmically into Sherlock’s face as the Alpha ate him out. Sherlock’s hands shot out to grab John’s cheeks and spread them so his tongue could travel deeper into his little love but soon it wasn’t enough and he needed more so he brought his hand over into the mix and pressed two fingers into the loose opening up to the second knuckle so he could spread John wider and get
"I can explain." Sherlock squeaked and John burst out laughing and jumped up to wrap himself around Sherlock.
"Er. We did say fifty?" John had to hold in the smile that threatened to break free as Sherlock twitched and handed him a fifty pound note before jumping up to stalk off in a mood. John sighed happily and finished off his drink before he stood to follow, he would need to stop off at a bathroom after he’d caught up to Sherlock though, pre-heat erections were such a bitch.
"It was all for nothing." Henry croaked out, John tilted his head to the side in question and Henry sniffed loudly.
"U.M.Q.R.A. wasn’t it?" Well Sherlock had started with it so he may as well go with it, Sherlock started to think of what it might be and started trying out different sounds to it but John shut him down telling him it was nothing, unable to think of any handy tricks, Sherlock went for an attempt at humour.
As far back as John could remember, he could never recall submitting so quickly and easily to anyone, he had always fought against the Alpha trying to dominate and claim him, this was why he had managed to stay unbonded for so long. He’d never trusted an Alpha to
"Why do you want that shirt specifically? It's in your wardrobe, Mrs Hudson ironed it yesterday." Sherlock just snapped his fingers and shot off towards his bedroom again, John counted to three before Sherlock came sliding back in.
"John, it’s only me." Sherlock said gently but John wasn’t listening and his panting was getting heavier, now Sherlock was starting to panic, he had to calm the man down and fast or he might just fall into a panic attack. The detective fell to his knees softly and moved slowly towards John so as not to spook the already panicking doctor. As he got closer Sherlock could see that John’s eyes were unfocused and a keen sweat was building up on his still tan skin, clearly the man wasn’t all here right now, how could it have slipped his mind that John suffers from PTSD.
"So where’re we off to next?" He chirped and Sherlock didn’t know if he was happy or aggravated at John’s interruption, then again who knew what might have come out of his mouth.
Sherlock let the memory fade reluctantly and trailed his eyes over the broken room. In addition to the damage near the window area, there was also the chest of drawers which had been tipped over and was cracked along the back and the mirror that had sat on the vanity table was smashed to pieces
"I'm not." She replied and Sherlock snarled and jumped up to grab his harpoon again, Mrs. Hudson looked back to John for help and he gestured she suggest a cup of tea.
"That was you unconsciously sensing that I’m a bit weaker than normal and asserting your dominance by holding me down and scent marking me, it’s what Alpha's do when they choose a mate." He saw Sherlock twitch at that.
John looked up when he heard the front door open, Sherlock must’ve finished his packing which meant John had better hurry since Sherlock never had any trouble hailing a cab with his magic arm and most London cab drivers hated waiting. After one last check to make sure John had grabbed everything he would need for the week, he quickly snatched up his bag and started jogging down the stairs, noticing that Sherlock had left his bag at the bottom of the stairs just as he had asked so John could grab it on his way out, which he did as he strode out the door of 221B.
“That’s why you need to close your eyes John. She needs you to look after her because she’s so tiny and fragile and beautiful. C’mon, that’s it John, just close your eyes for me.” Sherlock whispered gently when John’s eyes started to droop.
John." And then he dropped his head to snog the shit out of poor sleepy John. Sherlock got a feeling he was going to like this heat thing after all.
! It seemed analysing his own mind wasn’t going to help much either, John sighed, closing his eyes and breathed deep.
"I hope it’s the latter. I’d like for you to heal a bit before round two." John laughed at Sherlock’s concerned tone causing the Alpha to look up at him confused.
"Wha-" He didn’t dare let John finish, Sherlock spun quickly around and pinned John to the doorframe they had just passed, the Alpha hormones pouring off of Sherlock were intoxicating and not in a good way. John’s instinct to calm his Alpha rose and John lifted his head up to nuzzle under Sherlock’s chin.
got you well trained hasn’t he?” Mycroft rolled his eyes and cocked an eyebrow when Sherlock glared at him over his shoulder.
This was proving to be very difficult to watch, Sherlock had assumed he was braced for watching John’s reaction to the drug but there was no way any Alpha could be prepared to watch their Omega run around in the dark terrified of the sounds Sherlock was playing over the speaker system. Right at this very moment, Sherlock hated himself, hated himself with more passion than he could possibly imagine. John was trembling so hard he could see it on these fuzzy monitors, he watched the poor man stop and reach into his pocket for his phone and then he heard his own phone start to ring but he fought to ignore it and kept watch on the screen before him.
They thrust frantically against each other for what seemed like and age until Sherlock growled into John’s neck and released himself in his trousers, the fluids seeping through the fabric and dampening the back of John’s. The feel of the warm liquid against his backside set John off and he keened loudly and came in his own trousers. Sherlock stroked John through his orgasm until he was sure his Omega was finished then gently released the back of John’s neck revealing a huge purple bruise, satisfied with the state of John’s nape, Sherlock bent down to lick long strips up across the mark and then instinctively reached below his belt to gather a small glob of come to rub into the bruised flesh. Now no other Alpha would try to claim John, Sherlock had marked him and his scent was mixed with the Omega’s, that's how it would remain 'til John showered.
', John was sure that Sherlock was the only Alpha in history who was disgusted by an Omega in heat and balked at the idea of a week-long sex marathon with one.
"Well? Aren’t you going to tell me that was amazing?" Sherlock asked smirking, eyebrow raised, he was wholly unprepared for the punch to the face.
think they’ve managed to hide every bit of evidence of their crimes but they can’t, let alone when you’ve got Sherlock Holmes on your side, there
"Yeah. Okay. Okay." John mumbled to calm his distress at Sherlock’s venom, sitting back in his chair and trying to relax. He had to relax, less the cramping he could feel in his lower abdomen get worse.
This was strangely enough the first time a case would interfere with his cycle and he honestly didn't know what to do. On the one hand if he joins Sherlock in Dartmoor, they could get it done and be back home by tomorrow without incident. It was very unlikely that he would go into heat in the next 24 hours, well unless he was under an unnecessary amount of stress or really upset.
"Someone changed his mind; question is who?" Sherlock answered, his mind already trying to puzzle it out, John snorting pulled him from his thoughts.
, we’ll do it my way. You’re skin has flushed a disconcerting colour of white telling me you have had a shock, Your eyes are darting and avoiding mine unconsciously which suggests that the shock is something that pertains to us both and you have reluctance to tell me, also there is a thin sheen of sweat dampening your skin indicating nervousness which is confirmed by the trembling in your left hand which I
the British government, I reckon we’ve got about twenty minutes before they realize something’s wrong." John just flipped him the ‘V’ and tilted his head back.
"John, you have nothing to be ashamed of, it’s perfectly natural for you to-" Sherlock tried but John interrupted him.
"NO! Cold turkey, we agreed no matter what. Anyway you paid everyone off remember? No one in a two mile radius will sell you any." Sherlock growled again but finally huffed in partial defeat, he hated it when John was right, true it wasn't often but he still hated it.
"God, I sound like an idiot." Sherlock growled at himself and then stood up to finish his packing so he could get outside to hail a cab.
“Yes.” Sherlock jumped at the sound of his own voice and snapped his eyes to John to make sure he hadn’t alerted his grieving mate to his presence behind the cover of trees; he hadn’t. John was too absorbed in his grief to hear anything around him, Sherlock winced at the guilt that flooded his heart, he knew what he had done was wrong, making John watch as he jumped to his supposed death but it had to be done, all this hurt had to happen, he was doing it
Perhaps watching John so closely was not such a good idea, although he did want to keep an eye on the situation he was also aware of the fact he had some serious thinking to do, once he had calmed down somewhat, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that John was right, there was no such thing a monster mutant Hounds, however he did see it so there must be
sitting down to read the papers and drink his tea. He was actually a little impressed with himself, it only took him twenty minutes to find them this time; maybe today was the day his luck was changing.
"I called Henry-" John started but Sherlock interrupted him, trying really hard not to tackle the Alpha scenting the air above them for John.
"Do you want sauce with that?" He tried to distract John but the man was too busy analysing the situation, he really wished he hadn’t showed him how to do that sometimes, still at least their child wouldn’t be able to pull a fast one on them when they grew up into natures nut kickers;
"Nice scary inspector from Scotland Yard who can put in a few calls might come in very handy." John concluded and Sherlock looked at him, as ideas go, that was bloody brilliant. Hand it to John to come up with something so simple yet so
"Just ... just a minute. You saw what?" John questioned sitting forward and finally taking in Sherlock’s appearance. The man was pale, shaking and covered in sweat, a thick cover of it pooling in the dip between his collarbones and there was an odd bitterness in his scent that John had never smelled before.
As if sensing Sherlock’s inner turmoil, John chose that moment to shift in his sleep and let his head fall onto Sherlock’s shoulder, he rubbed his face against the boney appendage before settling back down, oblivious to to the cabs movements. Sherlock smiled at John and gently shifted, careful  not to jostle John too much, so he could wrap his arms around John and hold him tight, John just snuffled and buried himself against his new position on Sherlock’s chest, it was bliss. Sherlock could feel John’s hot breaths huffing against the ‘V’ of his shirt and brush against his collar bones, he could smell the woodsy shampoo coming from John’s hair and a scent that was just pure
"What? Have I missed something?" Lestrade asked confused and Sherlock gave him a fake scandalized look.
"OH GOD!" Sherlock screamed and threw his head from side to side, curls tumbling over the pillows as John swallowed, sucked and fucked him with his fingers. This was just too much, way too much!
Sherlock quickly jumped out of the car and jogged around to open the door on John’s side but the smaller man didn’t even notice Sherlock had left the car, he just continued to writhe against the upholstery and tug at his clothes. Sherlock frowned, concerned and reached in to slip his arms around John’s waist and beneath his knees before lifting the man up and out of the car bridal style, John’s whines immediately shifted to coos of pleasure once he was surrounded by warmth and secure in the Alpha’s arms even though tiny shivers still wracked his form from the painful spasms in his abdomen. Sherlock almost dropped him when John started kissing and nipping along his throat where his head was buried and the detective had to resist the urge bundle the Omega back into the car and breed him right here in the car park but he knew deep down that despite John’s advanced symptoms, his body still wasn’t ready for an Alpha so Sherlock resisted and used his hip to close the car door and walk quickly into the pub.
"John, where did you get such a ridiculous idea?" Sherlock asked, tipping up John’s chin to look him in the eye, John frowned.
"You’re right, you are being punished." Sherlock said smugly before leaning down and giving John a filthy kiss that rubbed John in all the wrong ways right now, when Sherlock drew back he was chuckling.
." Sherlock got a nip to his collarbone for that making him yelp, his skin was still sensitive there from John gnawing at it throughout the heat. The Omega startled at the sound and his head shot up concerned, he blushed when he saw the state of Sherlock’s neck and the surrounding area.
, probably to Bart’s for some experimentation but Sherlock had resisted, persevered and forced himself to accompany John, after all it was only to an appointment to document the progress of their child’s growth and make future appointments for further documentation of said child’s progress... or so John had said before he dropped the bomb about their shopping trip.
Sherlock had let himself doze lightly, fingers never stopping there stroking motion through John’s hair all night and only reopened his eyes when the sun had begun to rise. He thought about it long and hard for about a half hour before he decided to slip out of bed, get changed and leave, he didn’t want to but he knew John too well. If John woke up cradled in his arms after last night’s fight he would punch Sherlock’s lights out and on the verge of heat or not, would
“You should be fine to just go in, I checked in on them when Mycroft text me to tell me you were on your way, the nurses and midwifes pretty much stay at the main desk area and in the nursery at this time of night and John was sound asleep with the baby, but I still think you should let me have another quick look before you head in, ok?” Molly asked and Sherlock growled at the thought of any more time passing before he got to see his mate and child.
It was a very rare occurrence for there not to be any cases on these days at 221B thanks to the rising popularity of John’s blog, meaning that usually poor John didn’t get a lot of sleep or food in between the running around London chasing leads and criminals. However over the past few weeks there seemed to be a sudden drought of cases, almost as if the London criminal classes had decided to take a little holiday from being foiled by the dynamic duo of Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes.
' so John had promised never mentioned it. Whenever it was time for his heat, he would call up Harry to make arrangements to stay at hers for a few days or spend it with whatever Girlfriend/Boyfriend he had at the time, then he'd tell Sherlock he'd be gone for a week and Sherlock would rarely notice he was gone. It was the perfect routine.
your house keeper." Sherlock just gave her a look and she threw her hands up and marched forward to dig through the first bag. All that could be heard as Sherlock walked through to what was now his and John’s bedroom was cupboards slamming and the fridge freezer opening and closing, with the occasional cry when something disgusting was discovered but Sherlock didn’t care. He had managed to sneak the little green bag with his guilty purchase from the baby store out from under both Mycroft’s and Mrs. Hudson’s noses, if he didn’t want John to know about it, then those two were a definite no-no.
Sherlock smiled as more tears welled up in his eyes, it was so much harder to not pick her up again when he knew her name but he refrained anyway and leaned in to press one last kiss to his daughter’s forehead.
"Henry, whatever did happen to your father it was twenty years ago, why come to us now?" John voiced trying to ease the situation but it was no use, Henry wasn't listening.
"There’s one other thing we have to do before we go home first, love." Sherlock leaned in close to John, eyes narrowed and a low growl vibrating in his chest.
" John still didn’t look pleased but he lowered the knife and took five deep breaths before returning his full attention back to his breakfast, if Sherlock were smart he’d know this was the point to quit but as John pointed out not long after they met; he was an idiot... so he kept going.
pregnant. Why? I’ve already told you that you are in fact carrying my child." Sherlock asked confused, John wasn’t usually this unobservant, the doctor scoffed at him at swatted him on the back of the head gently.
"What the bloody hell was all that about?" He asked but Sherlock just started rocking back and forth restlessly.
"Hello boys! What can I do for you?" He called out cheerfully and Sherlock just gave John a look that said ‘
"I'm not sure, it should in theory prevent you from reacting further but since your body’s already been exposed to the scent, I don't know. I'm going upstairs to pack, I'll meet you outside, just leave your bag at the door and I'll grab it with my own on the way out." John said quickly and turned to go upstairs.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
. It wasn’t John’s fault about what happened, not really, the poor man couldn’t control what was happening to him but still who else could Sherlock be angry with?
"That’ll be £150 please." John had to hold back a flinch when he heard the price, this was the real reason that Sherlock didn’t want to do the booking, the detective just wasn’t a man to put his hand in his pocket unless it benefited a case, all the same John sighed and nodded as turned to get the money out of his wallet, that was when he saw the Alpha from earlier standing outside the door, talking on his phone. He wouldn’t exactly say the man was attractive and he looked a little wet behind the ears but... he smelled
