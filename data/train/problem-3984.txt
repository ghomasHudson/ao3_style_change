He reached the end of the corridor, with only one detour into what turned out to be an empty storage closet. "Jack shit," he muttered to himself and lowered his gun just enough to close the closet door.
He looked across the river, out at the hazy horizon, where he might be able to discern a mountain range. He knew he had to get across the river and into those mountains, but Dean also knew he didn’t want to get out alone.
Word got around in a place like this, so Dean left the Impala with the mechanic, who recommended a diner down the street. Dean thanked him, and because it was going to be some hours until the registry opened and because it was probably the only diner in town, they went in.
"Whoa, Dean, what are you doing?" the thing wearing his brother's face said, in a convincing approximation of Sam's mannerisms. Dean didn't waver.
"What did you do to her?" he demanded and set her down, gently. She was still breathing, but that didn't have to mean anything.
had seen, when he pulled Dean out of Hell. How much of what made up Dean did Cas know? Not much, Dean had presumed, since Cas hadn't batted an eye before standing up for him, standing
Dean scoffed. "Some angel you are. I nearly died getting the Colt, and then you would've had to take a trip Downstairs to get me all over again."
He shrugged his jacket collar up over his ears and tried to make himself comfortable, which was fucking impossible when sat on the wooded hill just outside "The Farm", which was what the SAL called their compound close to the Arkansas border. Dean could see a guard walk the perimeter at regular intervals, but they were all about as observant as bricks, so Dean's little hideout in the forest had gone unnoticed. Sam had waltzed into their organization smooth as anything — just a carefully orchestrated argument with a sheriff (who Sam and Dean had happened to help kill a werewolf some months back) in a carefully chosen location, and Sam had been approached by a couple of burly guys in camo cargo pants.
Neither God nor his mother provides a reply. All Dean gets is the wind, and the goddamned dust it has kicked up. Dean can’t remember a night where he hasn’t fallen asleep to Sam’s coughing. This place is killing him too, Dean knows. And Dean will not be the one to bury all his family members.
It turned out Paul owned the bar in town —no Prohibition in the Fields of Elysium, no sir— and he was generous with his whiskey. Dean accepted it gratefully and clinked the glass together with Rob and then Jane.
Her father and Rob both dashed forward to catch her as she fainted, much like Castiel had when he and Dean had entered the town.
"We really fucked up, huh?" Dean said. He could feel the heat of the light now, skirting the edge of unbearable.
It turned out to be a series of raised welts on the meatiest part of his shoulder, in the unmistakable shape of a handprint. Like someone burning with a fever hotter than smithy forge had clapped him on the arm.
"Jo, this ain't the work of no ghost," Dean said and went to the trunk to get some duct tape to fix it.
He brought the Impala to a screeching halt by a cross section of the dirt road marked with a lone road sign. Leaving the driver door open, he marched to the trunk, threw it open and started to dig through the assortment of weaponry and occult tools they kept in there until he got his hands on the little metal box with graveyard dirt, the bone of a black cat, and a cutout of his picture from a fake US Wildlife service ID.
and Dean wouldn't have gone to see the sequel if it hadn't been for the title  "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock". And they did find Spock, who was brought back to life, and now they all had to find their way back home.
Dean has stopped the car. Sam has fallen asleep in the passenger side seat, while Dean gets out and leans on the car hood while he looks up at the stars.
Dean found out Benny had been right, when Henriksen wrenched him off, throwing him aside like he was a ragdoll and nothing more. Dean landed in the dirt and had the breath knocked out of him too.
Oh, and all this because, according to whoever was in charge of Heaven now, Sam had to get possessed by Lucifer, so that Dean, possessed by the archangel Michael, could kill him.
But before he could pull the slacks down, he felt Cas place his hand on his head. It wasn't the usual hand on the head in these circumstances — Cas didn't thread his fingers in his hair; instead he cupped the side of his face and made him tilt his head up.
"Damned if I know," Dean said and rounded the car to open the passenger side door and hoist Castiel out. "I wonder though if it has something to do with why you seem to be expecting demons to roll into town."
"Dean," Sam said, and without talking, they both turned away from the light and grabbed each other like drowning men grabbing onto driftwood.
Time didn’t move here like it ought to. While they sat there, hunched, sand shifting around them, the huge, red sun touched the horizon and Benny turned to sand in front of their eyes. Dean closed his fist until his nails dug into his palm.
“As the grave,” Dean promised. “Cas, I’d get on my knees if I thought it’d help. I’ll take your grace and keep it with me until we get to the other side. I can give it back to you then if you want—”
It made Dean shiver. The demon had had long, black fingers, and he could imagine them wrapping around his ankle and never letting go.
He had no idea how much time passed before he came upon a gas station by the side of the road. There was a car beside it, but the station itself was empty.
"Believe it or not," Castiel said, staring out of the passenger side window like it was prime time TV. "Your parents found each other through angelic intervention."
But Sam's eyes were vacant, and his chest had stopped rising and falling. Dean closed his own eyes but couldn't stop the tears from spilling out and stinging the still bleeding cut on his cheek.
Then Cas set his mouth to the tender spot just where Dean's jaw met his throat, and all coherent thought deserted him for a while. Cas really hadn't been kidding when he said he wanted to know Dean's body; he seemed intent to explore every inch by either mouth or hand, tracing the line of a collarbone with his teeth, or raking his fingers down a bunched thigh muscle, tracing the outline of the Led Zeppelin angel tattoo, and Dean was struggling to keep afloat.
"We know he isn't invincible," Sam said, closing his eyes for a moment, taking in the night sounds. He hadn't realized the cicadas had gone silent when the demon had appeared; they were back now in full force, and the sound was soothing. "If he was, he wouldn't have run."
Bobby seemed to read his thoughts. "Let me put you in touch with a psychic," he said and pulled out a couple of mugs. "She's good, she can find out just about anything. Oh, and I have your car out back. Sam wouldn't touch it, but I thought it'd be a shame to let her go to waste."
“Dean,” Castiel said again, and the name grated on him, the way it sounded on Castiel’s tongue. Like it was something precious.
"I don't know who you are," Ellison said, eyeing Sam hatefully as he approached. "But you're too late, I–"
"Alright," he said. "Let's go inside." He wasn't about to strip here, no matter how many warding sigils Cas had put in place. It was cold, for one.
out the hard way when she told them to look to their friends, and then promptly smacked Dean on the head.
"Oh, hello," Pestilence said and eyed Dean dismissively. He had big ears, and his nose and eyes were red-rimmed, but he looked very neat in his button up shirt and white coat.
"I won't," Alastair said and wheezed. "Did you know, I think someone was sloppy with this devil's trap."
"Yeah? And can the human opt out when it gets to be too much?" Dean said and flicked his eyes up and down Castiel's
He heard Dean yell his name, but Sam was powerless to stop the same, intangible force from yanking him up and pinning him to the spot.
"I've learned from past mistakes, unlike some," Ruby sneered, from her safety behind Sam's broad back. "Look, I'm not the one summoning her this time. She's coming here to break a seal, and we're ready for her."
He heard a soft hiss of indrawn breath from above, but Dean had to focus on something more immediate. The warm bulge in the slacks in front of him, the somehow complicated undoing of the belt buckle. He slid the belt out like he had the tie, and let it clatter to the floor beside them. He undid the button and the zipper quickly, like he was afraid of changing his mind. He wasn't going to change his mind, but everything felt urgent; desperate.
Sam just watched him for a beat, before he smiled, vacantly, and then he shut the book he was reading with a pointed thump. "Guess so," he said and got to his feet. "I need to get out of here and go for a drive."
"What, are we just supposed to sit here and do nothing?" Sam exclaimed. Dean shook his head and gave him a friendly shove.
Instead of answering, Castiel reached out a hand, and Dean didn’t even think to flinch away from it. Castiel’s palm settled against Dean’s cheek, warm and dry, and Dean felt that curious, cooling rush through his veins that eased every aching part of him. For one, mesmerizing moment, Castiel’s eyes glowed white, and Dean stared.
Bobby said, with emphasis. He shifted in his chair and groaned. Dean, who was staring at the two fingers of whiskey Bobby had poured him as soon as he'd come down and seen his face, could guess what the groan meant.
Dean dives into the trunk of the car, to tap into the canisters of water they've been saving to cross the desert. But when Dean gets back with water in a flask, Sam lies still in the dirt, eyes open and vacant. Dead.
"Yeah, Sam?" Dean said and pulled on a pair of what he hoped was clean underwear before he pulled off his towel to scrub his hair dry.
Uriel laughed, and Dean had to tilt his head like Castiel used to do. Castiel wanted to introduce him to his friends? He hadn't even known angels had friends.
I cared about the mission. ‘Get him out Castiel,’ they told me. ‘Make sure he does not fall into temptation.’ No one told me about—” Castiel broke off and looked at Dean, desperately.
"And we need to find Lilith to stop the Apocalypse, I get it." Dean said and rubbed at his mouth. His stubble grated against his palm. At least this would give his experience a measure of worth. Some
He got pretty good at it. The knife struck Leah, or the demon wearing Leah's face, right in the chest. The demon dropped the shotgun and gaped, and Dean thought he saw something, a red-hot fire, flicker somewhere deep in its maw, before it crumpled down and shivered into ash.
He heard a scream from in between the trees and set off running. Some change in the air made him slow, when the neat rows of apple trees gave way for a clearing around a larger tree; practically ancient, with thick, knotted and cracked bark, and barely any living branches left.
In these grey lands, made greyer by the approaching night, they came upon a town, and Dean would've driven past if Castiel hadn't jerked in the passenger seat as soon as they crossed the town border and slumped down in a dead faint.
Gideon shook his head. "I can't tell what's wrong with him," he said apologetically. "I've been praying for him."
Sam did as he was bid, and pushed a few chairs up against it for good measure while Dean methodically started to paint a devil's trap on the floor just inside the door.
"Must be, but I can't figure out what," Jo said and shook her head so her blonde ponytail bounced. "Guess we'll have to keep looking."
Not for the first time, Dean wondered what Heaven was like. If it was at all anything like Hell, if just by dint of being a metaphysical place housing metaphysical beings, then what sort of beings would it create?
They were. Dean pocketed the flask and picked up the gun he'd dropped. "We need to find them, before anyone gets hurt."
It was a lab, he realized at long last, when they entered a room where a whole wall was covered by a shelf filled with vials and some expensive-looking equipment off to one side that reminded Dean of a distillery. A man in a white lab coat was standing by it, and looked at them with a gobsmacked expression of someone who had not expected to see two guys with murderous intent break into his lab.
"I guess this is where hunters end up when they die," he said. White lies weren't so bad, he figured. "I've been dead awhile though. I'm just traveling through."
He wanted to get back, and still he waited every day, as if the sun could kill him. As if he was waiting for someone.
Pestilence, absolutely impervious to the wind now whipping his silver-white hair, regarded him calmly as Dean finally gave in and sagged to his knees. He was seconds away from throwing up, and he had a horrible suspicion that if he started to throw up, he wouldn't stop until the lining of his stomach came up too. He carefully let go of the Colt, so that some sickly spasm wouldn't make him fire off the last bullet into the floor.
"Guess you keep more than nacho orders in that notebook," he said. Jo threw him a look, and if looks could kill that one would've carried Dean out of there.
Uriel turned and walked into the room, leaving Dean and Castiel in what Dean supposed was the antechamber to the room of torture they set up. He looked at Castiel, or rather his profile, as he stood half turned away from him.
Cas was a morning person. He hadn't known people were divided into categories based on what time of day they liked to be active, but Cas liked getting up when everything was still and quiet in their little apartment above the bar. Dean
"Well, I'll be seeing you around downstairs,"  Lilith said. "But now that I'm here, I might stick around. I guess I should say thanks!"
"I ain't going with you," Dean said, doing his best to hammer that anger into the steel of conviction. Ruby wasn't moved; she shrugged and turned to walk out.
"I think this is a stupid idea," Dean said and pulled out the knife. "And I'm not putting Sam in danger. But it's the only plan we've got, so let's do it."
“Sent?” Castiel said, one hand still braced on the dashboard. “No, Dean. This place will put these trials in front of you, no matter what you do.”
"Don't be sorry," Dean said. "You did it Sam, you fought a demonic possession! That's one for the history books. We'll get you patched up, don't you worry, don't–"
"Just what is going on here?" Dean asked. He was getting pretty tired of not getting a straight answer from anyone.
Something threatened to well up in Dean’s tender throat. He had to blink and rub a hand over his eyes before he could look back at Castiel again, speechless.
“I, uh. I get the feeling your angel siblings don’t agree with you,” was what Dean finally managed to say.
Dean made a soft noise in his throat, and Cas lifted himself up on one arm. The movement pushed Dean up as well, and Cas opened his eyes to the searching look in Dean's.
It had happened a couple of times before. Castiel being a step too close for comfort, Dean looking over to find Castiel looking back, intently. Or, not intently as such, but
You could get used to all sorts of things, Dean mused. But he sure as hell wasn't used to angels showing up unannounced whenever they were the least welcome.
Dean thought of the cornfield, and the moment they had looked at each other like time had stopped. He quickly turned his eyes back to the road.
"Dean could die tomorrow, slip in the shower and hit his head," Tessa said. "You know how frail humans are. And you have no idea what will happen to you after you die."
They had stopped in a roadside bar for Dean to take a break from driving, but Dean had promptly gone up to the bar, while Sam had immersed himself in their father's journal. The thick, leatherbound thing filled to the brim with newspaper clippings detailing supernatural occurrences all over the lower 48 states, and the leafs of paper cramped with John Winchester's neat hand laying out the lore and ways to deal with various supernatural creatures, was splayed open, half on top of  a newspaper he'd managed to scrounge up and half on top of the sticky table at the corner of the bar.
Maybe, Dean thought as the title card flashed to swelling orchestral music in the darkened movie theater, punctuated by the rustling of clothes and crunching of popcorn,
"I used to have faith too," Dean said and pulled out a cigarette from the pack in his back pocket with one hand. "Not in God– I never used to believe in Him. Why would I?"
War, the First Horseman of the fucking Apocalypse, might not die, but Robert sure did; he fell to the forest floor like any dead body. The only thing setting him apart from any other dead body was the fact that his death made the forest darkness feel a little lighter, and made the black of Jo's eyes melt away.
"I'm not sure how to proceed," Castiel said. "I suspect if I use my angelic powers, the demons will find me again."
He looked up again. The sky was bright, but there was no sun, and the color was still an unnatural red that made Dean look back down. This wasn't Hell, but it sure as damnation wasn't Earth either.
"Is it so hard to believe, Dean?" Sam had said, pointing at the book about angel lore on Bobby's kitchen table. "I mean, there has to be a reason holy water and consecrated ground repel demons! What if angels are real?"
"Thank God, I need my smoke break," he chuckled and started for the door. "Almost got fired for doing it in here once."
"They're not!" Dean had insisted. "We don't know why holy water works, we just know that it does, and I'd rather stick to what we know that put our trust in, what,
"Dean," Sam said at last, when Dean was staring at a page on Hellhounds in Bobby's library and had been for a good while
"Yahtzee," Dean said. "Alright, you go through the passageway, and I'll break my way into the root cellar from outside."
In April, a nuclear power plant had gone up in a Soviet state and rained radioactive waste over large swathes of northern Europe. A couple had held a bunch of kids hostage in an elementary school in Idaho and then murdered 64 of them, and then themselves. A planted bomb in Melbourne, Australia. Castiel had told them that the angels were fighting Lilith's hordes with all their might, but the goddamn demons  still managed to stir the pot all over the fucking place.
The demon rolled her eyes. "No, duh. I'm a crossroads demon, deals are what we do." Here she paused and took a step closer to Dean. He didn't miss the seductive way she swung her hips; like Dean was ever going to for something that smelled of rotten eggs. "I would've loved to broker a deal with you last time, but Azazel had precedence."
Dean ran, in the same direction Castiel had run past them, alongside the stream, which was already slowing to a trickle. With every step, Dean’s feet sunk into the loosely-packed sand just enough that the sweat was pouring off his face after just five yards, making the fabric of his chambray shirt stick to his back under his jacket. He didn’t stop to look if Henriksen was pursuing, but his sixth sense didn’t tell him to run
"Well, it wasn't worth it to me, Sam!" Dean snapped. He was leaning his head on his arm braced on the windowsill, sullenly. His mother's silver ring, which he wore on his right ring finger, was digging into his cheek. "And I made a choice too. I'm not going to be the one to bury all my family members!"
The man spluttered to life under the cascade, starting upright and sending droplets flying anywhere.
"Sammy, no," Dean said, voice husky. Sam thought he might be about to cry. "You got out, man. He wanted you to have a good life."
Dean swallowed. The implications of what Cas was saying made him feel unmoored, yanking up something he'd thought was immovable and immutable. He still found himself asking, "What does it mean?"
“Fat lot of good those evening prayers did,” Dean says and kicks at the earth. A red cloud of dust explodes. “What was the use, huh, ma? Did God ever answer you?”
Dean was laughing as his back hit the bed, and when he smiled up at Cas, his beautiful, moss green eyes became lined with crows' feet. Cas touched the wrinkles lightly, marveling that emotions could leave physical imprints. He never tired of touching Dean, even after all this time with easy access to all that was his body.
doing that," Jo said with a bright laugh and an eyeroll. Dean grinned too, and looked over his shoulder to find the man in question. He was over in the corner, deep in discussion with Ash. Problem solving, Ash had called it. Dean felt the grin slip off his face. Problem solving his inevitable death. His little talk to Sam apparently hadn't stuck.
Dean's neck prickled, and he realized that a woman was standing right behind him, where no one had been just a moment earlier.
"What, not in your own patch of the Fields? That's weird," Ash said. "Usually you start out at home, or what the afterlife figures your home is. You can branch out, of course, start exploring. But if you're alone, risk is your home won't be there when you get back."
"I thought I taught you better than this," Alastair said, with what would have sounded like a conversational tone if he wasn't choking on his own blood. "It barely tickles!"
But what spattered over Dean's face was not saliva but blood, hot and viscous. He blinked it away, furiously, to see a blood-covered spike grow out from between the teeth of the sphinx, like a morbid imitation of blowing raspberries.
How things worked in this realm was beyond Dean. What angels were made of was beyond him too, but Dean felt his heart stutter painfully when the river surged, and threw up a drenched figure on the bank, a few feet down from Dean.
Dean knew from experience that even when you read the signs right, even when you were careful, much more careful than this, the guy could get cold feet. On a good day, you'd just end up beating off on your own, but on a bad day you'd end up getting punched in the face because some guys had never heard of
"Dean, Dean, Dean," he said, blood dribbling down his chin with the name. "You think it was all worth it, don't you? Oh, sure, you spent a few months that felt like years in the Pit, but at least Sammy was safe, right?"
“I do believe this is one of your trials, Dean,” Castiel said, but he sounded a little curious. Like he didn’t quite understand the point of it either.
it called, with a rasping voice, and Dean startled into position, shotgun swinging forward even though he couldn't see a target. Belatedly, he looked up, and saw a pair of large, yellow eyes looking back.
Dean really wished he had a rifle instead of only his trusted ivory-gripped Colt when he entered The Roadhouse, one step ahead of Sam. The dark, boarded windows had alerted them to something being off, and Dean was on high alert. There was only one car outside besides the Harvelle's flatbed truck; a sleek, red Mustang that had made Dean whistle appreciatively.
Dean looked at Ash, who shrugged. "Can't tell you where you go when you die in the afterlife. That's beyond the interdimensions I know."
"Don't equate me selling my soul for you to this valley girl yanking your ass out of the fire on– what, a reconnaissance mission? Fuck that," Dean said and crossed his arms.
"Unless–" Here Alastair paused for the usual, dramatic effect. He leaned back in close, and his sulphuric breath washed over Dean's face. Dean did his best not to retch. "Unless, Dean, you want to pay it forward. If you pick up this knife–"
"Just Mom and Ash," Jo said with a shaky sigh. "Don't know what I would've done without Robert here."
"Yes," Gideon said. "Demons aren't the same here as they are on Earth. They can walk more freely, and can't be exorcised."
"I'm so sorry Dean," Castiel said. "I didn't know Uriel harboured an intent to let you die. I don't even know if Alastair knew where Lilith is. I put you through this for nothing."
Something somber flicked over Jo's features. "Dean," she said and got out of the car too. "I think this is the stretch of road."
"It's to treat GRID," the man said and wiped his palms on his white lab coat. "We call it HIV and AIDS, now."
"Thank you," Sam said and took off without so much as a second glance at her. Dean caught her eye and shrugged apologetically. What could he say, Sam was a hard catch.
Cas didn't respond immediately. Instead he kissed Dean's breastbone again, and his clavicle and his jaw. His three-day stubble was beginning to soften into a full beard, and the texture was pleasant against Cas' lips. He knew that for Dean, this wasn't easy for him to ask even if it was the easiest thing in the world for Cas to acquiesce.
is something you don't see everyday," Ash commented easily, without stopping his work. "You had that long?"
"Oh, like you're gonna waste your precious bullets on me," Ruby said, but she eyed the weapon nervously anyway. Dean didn't waver. He kept the gun trained on her, calm as anything.
This time the sphinx came at Dean with its teeth first, and Dean barely had time to jam the barrel of the shotgun in between the jaws so he wouldn't lose an arm. The force of the impact sent him back down into the dirt, arms screaming in pain as the sphinx yanked the gun from his hands and spat it out, with a disdainful flick of its head.
Staring down Henriksen, Dean thought this was one he ought to run away from. He dug his heels into the hard-packed sand, tightened his grip on the walking staff which Castiel had given him, and stood his ground. The sun had begun its descent, and it painted long shadows behind him and Castiel, and made Henriksen seem taller.
Dean grinned, without much mirth. "Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go bareheaded. Doesn't seem to have hurt you." Henriksen didn't answer. The smile dropped off Dean's face. "Let us pass."
"Oh, well, great," Dean said and looked at the people who had escorted him. "What are you going to do when you find this demon, then?"
"Yeah," Dean said and looked at him for a beat, The serious lines on his brow made Sam look older than he was, but the brown hair that draped across his face when he leaned down made him look like the kid Dean still felt he was. "Let's go."
Hell was metaphysical, Dean was pretty sure. He could see it in the faces of the demons that taunted him– the remnant of whatever face they had had when they were humans before their long road to ruin, grotesquely mixed with their demonic form. Their shapes were metaphysical, just like Dean's body had to be metaphysical.
He had to grind his feet into the earth, and the rope bit into his shoulder while he strained, and inch by painful inch, the body of the beast moved.
Uriel shook his head. "Castiel, it is time to give up this foolish notion of thwarting the Apocalypse. We must fight the war to
Without hesitation, Dean pulled out the Colt and took aim. Cas held out his hand and said, "No, he's human."
Castiel had said. And Dean remembered choking on brimstone and fear, half-mad with pain and anger, and he remembered a hand, a bright white hand, gripping him tight.
"Yes," Castiel said and turned his face to glance at Dean. Dean caught it from the corner of his eye. He had a somber look about him, like he wasn't used to smiling, with tousled black hair that made him seem windswept and a crooked collar that made him seem perpetually rumpled.
And in an ironic answer, he heard the fluttering of feathers, the flap of invisible wings, and Castiel was standing before them, still dressed in a suit and trenchcoat. Sam reeled back, clearly shocked, and Bobby cursed out loud, but Castiel didn't seem to even notice them. He looked right at Dean and said, "The Witnesses have been raised."
They'd spent months carefully laying out plans on how to deal with Yellow Eyes when he finally popped back up. Dean was an optimist at heart, but he really should have known all of that was going to go to hell in a handbasket.
When Dean finally found the courage to look Cas in the eye again, he found Cas looking back. His eyes were dark, and his mouth was pink, and Dean was fairly sure his blood must've turned to molten gold in his veins; that was what it felt like, to have Cas looking at him like that.
"You're unusually quiet," Dean said, when enough time had passed that he was reasonably certain Sam wasn't talking on purpose. Sam gave a grunt, which all but confirmed Dean's suspicions. "Hey come on, Sam. You're still not sore about me taking you to get tattooed?"
"What do you know about my soul?" Dean demanded. The subject was a little sore, thank you very much.
It’s a spring day like only Kansas can. Dean’s teaching Sam to shoot: cans lined up on the same fence in the same field pa had taught Dean to shoot.
Dean thought of Johnny Cash taking the side of people down on their luck. Cas could use someone like the Man in Black, but for lack of someone like him, Dean grabbed Cas by the sleeve and dragged him out of there.
Being on the move felt good; it felt like a weight lifted off Dean's shoulders. The view didn't change much; rolling fields and a blue blur in the distance that might be mountains. The sun had disappeared from the sky again, leaving it a rust red color that made the heat seem oppressive even though the car didn't have any windows. The man by his side — the angel – looked out at the pastures rolling by.
Cas stepped back and Dean straightened up. He supposed it was showtime. Cas made a gesture and uttered a word, a single, guttural syllable that made the hair stand up on the back of Dean's arms, and the holy oil ignited in flame. Unbidden, Johnny Cash's
The problem turned out to be Bobby's wife Karen, dead fifteen years back. Except Karen Singer was presently dressed in a yellow dress and an apron and in Bobby's kitchen baking pies. The smell had permeated the air all the way out in the foyer.
Dean has pulled the car to a stop, and Sam staggers out. He coughs, and coughs, and coughs, until he falls to his knees. Dean just barely manages to round the hood of the car in time to catch him.
Pastor Gideon directed them to lay Castiel out on one of the benches. Dean breathed out and regarded him for a moment – he seemed to be sleeping peacefully, but Dean had seen the way his entire body had gone taut before he collapsed. Now his body was relaxed, chest expanding evenly with every breath. Dean felt helpless, now that he'd laid him down; there was nothing more he could do.
"Oh man," he said after his first bite. When Ruth had disappeared from earshot, he added, "I don't even care about the ghosts, coming here was worth it just for this pie!"
He had a girlfriend, a long time ago when Sam was at Stanford, and Dean and John had stayed in a Louisiana town for the summer to solve a case. She had liked to stargaze, Dean's girlfriend had, and Dean went happily, for the opportunity of a roll in the hay-to-be. But afterwards, grass scratching his bare back, she had pointed out the constellations to him. "That's Sirius, the dog star," she had said, when dawn was hinting at gold on the horizon. "It's part of the Canis Major constellation, and it's the brightest star in our system."
"It's their fault!" Jane screamed back, and turned toward Castiel, knife first. Castiel reached out a hand, calmly, and touched her forehead. She dropped to the ground beside Dean, the knife clattering to the side, and Rob started forward.
"Thank you," Dean said, before he turned and grabbed another demon by the throat and drove the knife into its heart.
Dean woke up. It was a real waking up; the breath he drew in was real. The smell of rotting wood and dirt was real. He blinked. The darkness pressing down on him did not change.
She made a face after swallowing a mouthful. "Tell you the truth, I never used to drink much," she said. "But it's a full-time job, keep the demons out. Might as well enjoy myself while this lasts. I've already died once, you know?"
Jo, quick as a whip, sensed his mood change immediately. "Hey," she said, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "I've got a case."
He found Ellen by the bar. She pointed to the far end of the room, and Dean's eyes landed on the prone form of a man slumped over a table.
"Then come with me," Cas said then, which made the cigarette between Dean's lips wobble precariously. "Let's find God together."
The front door opened with a creak of unoiled hinges. Dean turned to see Bobby stick his head out, wearing his characteristic ball cap and graying beard.
"Damn straight," Dean said and turned away decisively, so that Sam wouldn't notice how his voice broke around the lump that formed in his throat.
As if on cue, there was a crash in the hallway, and Castiel straightened up. Dean let go of him and reached for his holy water or Palo Santo, but with a curse, he realized he'd left all of that stuff in the trunk of the Impala. An FBI agent didn't carry around wooden stakes.
"What's going on?" Jo said, and Dean put a hand on her leg, in what he hoped was a comforting gesture but was really only for show.
Things didn't work like he was used to here in the Fields of Elysium. But Dean had to admit that hunting in a pack had its upsides; when they finally found the demon, skulking around just by the town border, a stone's throw from where Dean had parked the car, the four of them were able to circle it, a snarling, spitting thing that barely even looked human to Dean.
Dean, who was staring at the smouldering wreck which was all that remained of Robert's — War's — red Mustang, nodded absently.
"You done?" Ellen called, where she was coming down the stairs with a bundle in her arms. "Here Dean, brought you some clothes. Can't send you out into the world like that."
And like that, in a strange push and pull, like the moon pulling the tide, they came together. Cas kissed Dean's neck and collarbone, but never strayed far from Dean's mouth, and Dean kissed Cas' chest and caught his soft earlobe between teeth, and Dean was the one to push their underwear down and touch Cas for the first time. His cock was silken and burning to the touch, and though it was dry and made Dean twist his wrist uncomfortably, he didn't let up for a second, because the noises Cas spilled into his skin were so sweet and made Dean's skin feel like something precious.
Dean knows something about feeding a family, even if it’s just one brother. But Sam is away at college, which Dean knows is good for him, so now Dean only has to fend for himself. It’s easier, in many ways, but in some ways harder.
Great! You know, we're coming up on the California border soon. And I ain't stopping until we hit Stanford, so you can go get that college degree.
"Yeah, we're heading up to see family for the fourth of July," Jo said with a bright smile and squeezed Dean's arm. "I'm going to meet his parents for the first time, it's all a bit nerve-wracking!"
At least she had her mother looking out for her. Ellen came back out with a wooden box in her hands, and she cleared her throat loudly when her gaze fell on the two of them. Dean lifted his hands to show he wasn't up to anything, and Jo gave an irritated huff as she pulled away.
Dean let Jo pull him upright. "That's not reassuring," he told her. "He said he was the one to pull me out of the Pit."
"Hush," Pamela said, but there was a hint of laughter in her admonition. "You who raised Dean Winchester from Hell, reveal yourself."
"Okay, so there are over a thousand possible seals, and Lilith only needs to break sixty-six of them for Lucifer to walk free," Sam said and scratched the back of his head. He refused to get his hair cut, even though Dean offered to do it for him. He'd been cutting his own since he was old enough to hold his dad's clippers.
Gideon glanced sideways at Dean and smiled. "I suppose old habits die hard," he said. His gaze slid off Dean, to the window of stained glass. "And when the demons manage to drag one of us to Hell– it's as if the earth swallows them up."
"Right," Dean said and watched as Rob and pastor Gideon carefully laid out Leah on one of the benches, much like Castiel was lying on the other side of the aisle, and Jane hurried to the back after some water.
Rob was the one to get in the killing shot, and everyone cheered when the body of the demon crumpled down and smoked into nothing.
The thing with sex that Cas hadn't understood before was that it was different every time. Oh, the acts could be the same, but the whole of it was never the same. Never before had Cas felt this particular, lazy pleasure, of Dean being warm and pliant from sleep and pushing up to meet him, with the sun slanting in through the window at this particular angle on this particular summer's morning. And he never would again.
"Sure, sure," the demon said good-naturedly. "Just like your daddy. Only that didn't turn out so well for him."
At this, Castiel turned his gaze to the road for a moment. When he looked back at Dean, there was something steely in his blue eyes. The hair on the back of Dean’s arms rose and the air between them seemed to crackle when Castiel’s forehead smoothed out in contempt. “Your place is not to question the orders of the Heavenly Host,” he said slowly, with that same steel in his voice.
"Jesus," Dean muttered and pushed away enough to get his feet under him and stand up again. "Jesus, Cas, you can't say shit like that."
"Warding sigils, mostly," Dean said and carefully pulled his arm away, resisting the urge to roll down his sleeve. "Some spells. I was never good at memorizing symbols, so I figured I'd bring my cheat sheet with me everywhere I go."
"It's okay honey," Dean said, with a meaningful emphasis. "Do you mind telling us why you pulled us over, sheriff?"
Cas took a moment to look out the window again. The people were waking up; he could see movement on the streets, and the noise level was rising. This town in the middle of Kansas wasn't far from where Missouri Moseley lived; the first time Cas had met her, she had taken one look at him and burst into tears. It was tears of happiness, she explained to a horrified Dean and a shocked Cas, because as a faithful Christian, it was nice to see proof of goodness sometimes.
Dean blinked the grit from his eyes and pulled the cover down, just to be assaulted by bright daylight. Sam was standing in the doorway to the motel room, fully dressed and with his hands on his hips.
Sam smiled at him, but Dean could tell his mind was already on the corpses. The autopsy was already performed, the grotesque Y-shape of the incision stitched back together and the organs scooped out and placed in jars. The door shut quietly behind the coroner.
Gideon seemed to think on what to reply for a while, but before he could give voice to his thoughts, footsteps sounded, and a girl turned up in the doorway opposite Dean.
With hands that trembled, Dean gripped the knife. Castiel himself unbuttoned his shirt to expose his pale throat (where the tie was, Dean did not know), and Dean drew in a deep breath and set the tip of the knife at the dip of his throat.
Sam followed suit a little more reservedly, and Jo drank her portion while pulling a face. Dean couldn't help but grin at her when she set her glass down. Jo looked pointedly at him, an open challenge.
"You think you can fight me?" Henriksen said and twisted his body so that he could grip the staff. "My righteousness gives me might."
"No, I–" Dean said, and then stopped himself. Something bitter was climbing up his throat. "We need to wake my friend up," he said then, touching Paul's shoulder.
"Individual human lives matter," Castiel protested. Dean looked at him in surprise. He'd always pegged Cas for the big picture kind of guy.
Dean bent his head to catch Cas' lower lip in between his, even though he really wanted to pry them apart and swallow Cas whole in some unreal, primal urge. He wanted to know what Cas tasted like, what it felt like for their breaths to grow ragged and their mouths slick with spit against each other, wanted to find out all the ways they could fit together.
Cas rolled over on his back, head comfortably leaned on Dean's arm. He thought about going west, into the setting sun. He thought he'd like to watch the sea, maybe feel the waves touch his toes. Dean sometimes made fun of how often he was barefoot, but Cas liked being barefoot, and Dean didn't mind that he sometimes tracked in dirt when he'd been tending their little backyard garden.
Dean wasn't a morning person, but Cas knew he didn't like to sleep in for too long either, so he took a mug from the cupboard and filled it with coffee from the pot and carried it to their bedroom.
"No, I'm not quite sure what this is," Tessa said. She frowned and looked a little closer at Dean. "Your soul. It's earmarked for Hell."
The sphinx let out a death rattle, a tearing wet noise before it keeled down in a mess of too-many limbs, and Dean watched, speechless, as a figure backlit by the harsh sun of this realm put a foot to the carcass and tore the blade from the head with another spatter of hot blood.
Alastair getting in close, nose to nose, with his hand around Dean's throat in turn, now that might merit a placement. Dean gripped his forearm with both hands, to get some leverage but his grip was weak, his head swimming, and his mouth tasted of his own blood as Alastair pushed him up against the wall with his superhuman strength.
Dean sighed, a sound from deep in his chest that was both lustful and content. Cas kissed his breastbone, as if chasing the sound itself, and used the weight of his body to press as close as he could. His hand traveled down Dean's ribs and soft stomach, over the sharp jut of his hipbone to the smooth, corded muscle of his thigh and to the coarse hair on his calves.
"Stay down!" Henriksen hissed and slammed Dean to the ground again. "It is my God-given right to stop sinners trying to escape their rightful punishment!"
So it came to be that Dean snuck into Led Zeppelin's last live performance in the United States. He didn't know it was going to be their last; nobody knew at the time. It felt like fate in so many ways — before, during, and after. Nothing that happened to Dean, either before or after, would ever take away what it felt like, to be in the middle of a fucking stadium packed with people just screaming with joy at four long-haired Brits playing rock.
That point, Dean had to concede. He closed his eyes and cleared his throat. "Castiel, if you can hear me, we would appreciate your input. Thanks, amen."
He picked up the knife where Sam had dropped it, put it in his  jacket pocket and strode into the barn.
"Our dear sheriff," Jo said. Dean couldn't see her, but her voice was close, and putting together what he'd seen of her and his own current predicament, he surmised that she, too, was bound to the tree. "And a couple of other guys, couldn't see them clearly."
In the middle of the scuffle, no one noticed that Castiel had blinked his eyes open. He sat up with a rustle of clothes, and that put a stop to the struggling - at least on Dean's part. He gawked up at him, dumbly, which gave Jane a fine opportunity to stab him in the leg. Which she did.
There was a shrill scream, and Dean turned around to see not one but two demons, dragging Dylan by his wrists, toward the hill. Both Jane and Rob were fighting demons of their own, and Paul was besieged by another, valiantly fending it off with his knife. Dean threw himself at the demons who had Dylan in their grip, but he was still unarmed, and one of the demons bared its teeth at him and lashed out. While Dean wrestled with the demon, viciously trying to get past it, the other demon gave an eerie howl and pulled Dylan with him into the hill.
Despite himself, Dean lifted his hand and set it on Castiel's arm in turn. Castiel looked up at him again and they just stood there, holding each other, breaths coming out in visible, white clouds as the wind rustled the trees around them and the world changed irrevocably.
was soon thick on Cas' tongue when he delved deeper. Dean's lips were soft and full, a shape that Renaissance sculptors would envy, and Cas knew that rasping his own stubbled top lip over them would leave them red and swollen. But he still slid his body down a fraction, to kiss the vulnerable skin of Dean's throat.
"Fuck," Dean breathed. He didn't know how to look away from Cas now. "Fuck, Cas, if you're not– I mean, without your powers, how can we even hope to put a lid on this whole mess?"
Dean swallowed, but went on when Cas did look up at him again. "You think that everything you do, you do to make them proud. But nothing you do is ever enough, right? And then one day– one day it's too late. They're gone, they'll never be able to give you– whatever it was you wanted from them. And you gotta start doing things for yourself. Because of who
He reached out his hand again and cupped Dean's face. A soothing coolness flowed through Dean at the touch; he gasped, and realized his palm wasn't throbbing anymore. He lifted his hands and no blood oozed out from his leg, the skin under the tear of fabric smooth and unblemished.
Sam shook his head ruefully. "Well," he said. "Don't you have a feeling these Horsemen sort of want to be found?"
Henriksen smiled then, that sharp, mean smile. "No can do, sir," he said, amiably enough. "Neither of you are worthy."
Before Henriksen could regain his footing, Dean aimed a kick to his gut. From the corner of his eye, he saw the flash of Castiel's coat as he ran past the both of them. All according to plan so far.
“What?” Dean said and stopped too. His ankle was throbbing painfully, even though he and Castiel had made their way slowly.
"Your daughter never came to the Fields," Castiel said to pastor Gideon, and got to his feet. "You will not be besieged by demons anymore, now that this one is gone."
according to plan. Dean pushed off the ground to tackle him, a desperate crush of bodies, rather than let him pull Dean down. Both of them crashed to the ground in a tangle of limbs, and Dean did his damndest to be the one who ended up on top.
Cas smiled ruefully as the light faded from his eyes. "My grace," he said, and his voice was gritty with exhaustion. "I'm losing it, bit by bit. My connection to the Host is weakening every passing day, and with it, my powers."
Dean is driving west, Sam beside him. SAM coughs into his hand. When Dean looks, he sees BLOOD in Sam's palm.
"Do we think it's Lucifer?" Dean interrupted. He had his eyes trained on the TV but he didn't watch what was happening on the screen.
Pamela Barnes opened the door to Dean's knock and smiled at him. Dean gaped for a second. Bobby had said she was good, not that she was show-stoppingly gorgeous.
There were enough of them that Dean didn't have a clean shot on Famine himself, the gaunt man in a black wheelchair, surrounded by lackeys bringing him — well, that was the catch. Sam and Dean had followed the demon carrying a briefcase here, without knowing what it contained. But that didn't matter, not when it had led them to their target.
Night had fallen, but he could still make out Jo's blonde hair by the root of the tree, where she was on the ground, leaning against the tree trunk.
"Dean," Castiel said, voice rough but still calm, cutting through the fog of Dean's mind. "Open your eyes."
Castiel's expression sobered, turning heavy. "They were upset, and rightly so. An angel dead by his brother's hand–"
The grin that spread over Dean's face wasn't purposeful, it just happened. "Good to have you back, Cas."
"Alright, alright!" He sounded a little choked, what with Sam's forearm pressed to his throat, blinking rapidly and tapping his fingers against Sam's shoulder. "What's it you say out here? Hang ten?"
"Cas," he began uncertainly. "I don't know if you can hear me, but buddy, I– I could use your help right now." He paused. His heart was beating hard, which was weird, but, hell, in for a penny in for a pound, right? "Or, you know, I'd settle for just seeing you. Knowing you're alright, that'd be nice. I hope you're okay. Uh, amen, I guess."
"Not to my knowledge," Dean said, hedging his bets. They didn't know that he was an angel. One of the men, the one who had dumped the holy water over Dean's head, helped Dean pull Castiel up to drag his dead weight with them.
"Thank you, but no," Castiel said and roused himself from the hood of the car. He turned and looked Dean in the eyes, deep enough that Dean felt uncomfortable. He was going to have to teach Cas some human courtesies if he was going to keep coming around like this.
"Jesus," Sam said. Before he knew it, his knees had given out, but not before Dean had herded him to the ratty living room couch where he could sit down. "How?"
This isn't our home, Sam, not without mom and dad. There's no living to be made here anymore. Even the
Sam closed his mouth into a flat line and blew out a breath through his nose. "Dean," he said, this time imploringly. "Ruby– this isn't what you think. She's been helping me stop seals from breaking, and she was helping me kill demons
"What my partner means to say is, the stress of the job," Dean said, as sympathetically as he could. "Working with dead bodies– it's not good for just anybody. But, look, that's what we think happened. But on the off-chance that it had something to do with the bodies he was examining — Mr. and Mrs. Deakin — is there
Dean pulled out the water flask from his jacket pocket. It hadn’t gotten lost during all his adventures, and Dean shook it before he took a small sip and then held it out to Castiel, who grasped it gratefully and emptied it into his mouth.
"Fuck," Dean gasped. It wasn't the most eloquent of responses. He scrabbled, trying to get a chokehold of the demon, but the demon didn't care. It only cackled madly and grabbed Dean by the leg and started to pull him toward the hill.
"Guess we shouldn't have put the Sword and Arm of the Lord guys behind bars," Sam said, lightly. Dean leveled him with a look. He usually appreciated it when Sam showed a sense of humor, but maybe he didn't realize what the odds had to be to beat an
While the sun was up, it was a beating, flailing heat, but now the heat came from below, from the earth itself, and the heat was thick and muffling.
"The reaper who— Tessa was her name. You freed her, Sam. She said she might owe you a favor. I say we try to get her to pay it back. Tell us where to find Death and stop him."
"What? Just 'cause I don't like bourbon doesn't mean I can't hold my liquor," she said and crossed her arms and leaned her hip against the bar. Dean shook his head and shifted a little where he sat on the barstool with his elbows on the bartop.
"Speak of the devil," Paul said as the door to the bar swung open and a lanky kid entered. He had to be younger than even Jo, but he was old enough, Dean recognized, that he'd want to sit in on what the grown-ups were doing. Rob called out to him and threw his arms open to pull him into a hug.
Dean realized that tears were spilling down his cheeks. He wiped them away quickly, but no one noticed — or if someone did, they didn't care. Everyone's emotional state was heightened; and for Dean, he experienced a rare sense of complete timelessness. Nothing existed, except himself, right there in that moment.
Castiel did that head tilt that seemed to be his go-to move. "You have a Heaven-sanctioned purpose, Dean," he said. "Surely, stopping the end of the world is a worthy cause even for you?"
Despite himself, Dean screamed. He dug his fingers into the earth, clawing up chunks of grass until his hand came into contact with something hard. He gripped the stone tight, and twisted his body to smash the rock right into the temple of the cackling demon. The demon's grip slackened, and Dean hit it again, and again, and again, until it slumped down, dead.
"I heard there was a stranger come to town," Dylan said and peered at Dean, who raised his glass in greeting.
"No," Dean said as he pulled the sleeve down and shrugged his shirt back on. Whatever it was that had sprung him out was bound to want something in return. Whatever it was that had left this mark. "Just since I woke up here out in the fields outside the Roadhouse."
Thanks to this catalogue and Dean and Sam's encounters, they were able to ring in just what sort of omens accompanied the yellow-eyed demon in particular, a pattern of cattle deaths, temperature fluctuations, and electrical storms that heralded his appearance.
Because Dean's eyes threatened to fall shut after more or less three days of incessant driving, from South Dakota to Maryland to Illinois, heading back to South Dakota, they had to take in at a roadside motel. Though exactly what Cas had meant became abundantly clear when they got out of the car.
"Do you think maybe Pestilence is here to, I don't know, destroy the stock?" Dean asked Cas, in a lowered voice.
Tessa only blinked at him. "No, Dean, you're already dead," she said. "This is, for lack of a better word, a dream."
"Is this what's going to happen to me if I say yes to Michael?" Dean asked quietly, eyes trained on the man in the wheelchair. The look in his eyes could be described as 'We're calling, but no-one's home.'
So Sam and Dean packed themselves into the Impala early next morning, so early that it was still pitch black. It took a couple tries, with Dean's gentle coaxing, before the engine hummed to life in the cold, but then they were on the road heading south.
Dean walked back to the church, leaving his newfound friends at Paul's. He slunk inside as quietly as he was able, but it turned out not to matter. Gideon was still up, kneeling in front of the altar with his head turned upward. He didn't move when the church doors swung shut behind Dean.
Dean shrugs and goes for the passenger side door. Getting away from prying eyes isn’t a bad idea. The man drives them in silence, and Dean knows he isn’t the best passenger, fidgety and sullen when he can’t hold the steering wheel, but there’s something reassuring in the heat radiating from the man driving. Makes him feel real.
But she never finished her sentence. She collapsed against Dean with a sigh, and horrified, Dean caught her unconscious body.
tried," Sam said, and he sounded a little sad about it. "Doesn't work for me, but it seems to work for you. I mean, what do we have to lose?"
"Because you said you believed in me," Cas said, the rage leaching out of his voice to give place to a more fraught emotion. "And that gave me a reason to believe in you too."
"To John Winchester," Ellen said grimly and held up her glass. It glowed amber where the light hit it. "He was a bastard, but a good man."
bait, Dean," Jo said and tapped her foot to the floor impatiently, looking intently at the map in front of her in the fading light. "Doesn't work without the both of us."
Dean shook his head to clear his mind. He was standing and breathing, it didn't matter what he was wearing. He had to get to safety, even if he didn't know what the dangers were.
Defenseless and prone, Dean figured he ought to say his prayers and say them quick. Not that they had helped last time.
"Alright, boys!" Ruby said from the far end of the barn. "Or boy. We're all set for the summoning. Where's Sam?"
"The hell he does," Dean said. It was punctuated by a hoarse scream from inside the bunker, and Dean flinched, taking his hands off Cas.
"It is my last time on Earth," Dean said, matter-of-fact. "Look, you're not going to find a way to break that deal. If we do, you're–" he made a slicing motion with his hand with an accompanying noise. "–done for, over. Dead again."
“What’s a fella like you doing in these parts?” the man asks as he sidles up to him, and Dean smiles into his glass of whiskey. They don’t need to be subtle, but the line is so familiar, so well worn already that it’s almost a joke.
When Dean was four, his mother died in a fire. At least, that's what the newspaper said. Dean was just old enough to understand that it wasn't the whole truth, and Dean was the only one his dad could tell the truth to, when he found it out. Sammy was just a baby then, a little baby that Dean had carried out of a house going up in flames. But when Sammy grew up, he learned the same thing Dean did; a monster had broken into their home and killed their mother.
Tessa's eyes flashed. "Dean died instead of Sam, which kept the balance. But you messed with that balance when you brought Dean back from the dead. That's a death undone, and the universe does not like that."
The man took his chance and bolted. Cas made a move to stop him, but he seemed to realize Dean's state and aborted the gesture to turn back to him.
What they got was a set of coordinates for Harvelle's Roadhouse. Bill Harvelle had worked with John Winchester on tracking down the Yellow-Eyed Demon, and his widow still ran the place. Bobby had never been down to the Roadhouse himself, but many hunters that he knew tended to frequent the place.
Rob grinned at him. "Here demons die just like anyone else, if you know to root them out," he said and hefted his shotgun demonstrably.
Dean slammed his foot on the brake. Castiel lurched forward, bracing himself with his hands as the car skidded to a halt. He blinked at Dean questioningly, but didn't seem rattled at all.
The United States of America was nothing if not large. Endless, some might say, though Dean had driven coast to coast and back again during his life. But finding someone who didn't want to be found was damn near impossible. Dean pressed his lips flat and pressed down on the gas as the highway opened up before him.
Desperately, Dean grabbed his hand and squeezed. Benny closed his eyes, pain written into every line of his face. “No, hey, none of that,” Dean said. “I’m sure we can—”
"I won't let them take me," Cas said, sounding for all the world like an outlaw in a John Wayne cowboy picture. "Besides, the important thing is to keep you safe. Don't say yes to Michael."
“Please, Dean.” Castiel’s Adam’s apple moved with the words and Dean bit his own lip and pushed the tip of the knife through skin.
"An FBI agent can't walk around with a crooked tie," Dean said and tightened the knot, pulling it up to lie snug against the V of the white collar. "What, exactly, don't you understand?"
John had said good night, even though the night sky was graying in the east already. Dean had insisted Sam take the first shower, in case the hot water ran out, but there was just enough warm water left that Dean could rinse himself off before wrapping himself in a towel. He'd come out of the bathroom to find Sam sitting on his bed, dressed in dry clothes, but not the pajamas Dean had expected.
Ellen brought out the good stuff. All four of them took up station around the bar, and she poured them all a shot of bourbon — even Jo, who couldn't be a day over eighteen. But then again, Dean had had his first drink at the tender age of twelve, and had been blackout drunk once or twice at sixteen.
Dean could still remember the chill that had gone through his own bones when the spirit appeared and grabbed hold of Sam. Sam had given a shout, but he'd been pulled into the pool before the sound had even bounced off the tile, and Dean had jumped in the water with his sawed-off shotgun to save him. Stupid, of course — you couldn't shoot a salt round underwater. But while he struggled with the ghost of a man dead seventy-four years for Sam's life, their dad finally put the torch to the skeleton he'd dug up, and Dean had seen the ghost flake into nothingness right there, in the water, and had been able to pull Sam up and out of the pool.
Dean stared at him. "What? You? You, with your 'would've been an actual Federal agent in another life' vibe are going to be a mole?"
Dean glanced at Jo, who nodded minutely. "I will," Dean said, plastering on a fake grin when he turned back. "Thank you."
"Alright," Dean said and hefted the shotgun so it was easier to carry, and headed in among the trees. It didn't take him long to find the track – broken twigs and disturbed mulch – winding its way through the forest. He could see partial footprints too, and if he didn't know any better he'd say he was following a mountain lion even though there never had been a mountain lion this size.
Jane and Rob were flanking their son now, and all three of them were fighting like mad. From the corner of his eye, Dean saw a demon that tried to slither its way between them, to grab Dylan's feet. Something acrid bloomed in the back of Dean's mouth, and he twisted to throw his knife. It wasn't the best throw, the trajectory crooked from Dean's haste, but it still hit its mark; the demon gave a screech, pinned to the ground by the knife through its back, and shook into ashes. Dylan was safe, but Dean was unarmed now, and another demon immediately took advantage. It pounced on Dean like a rabid dog.
She disappeared back to where she had come from. Dean exchanged a quiet look with Sam — things usually didn't go this easy.
In the falling dusk, Dean made his way down the slope. It was laughably easy to circumvent the guard, and even though activity seemed to have been stirred up – no doubt thanks to Sam being discovered – Dean still managed to circle around the compound without being detected.
The high-pitched whine was loud enough to hurt now. Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand, and Castiel swayed on his feet.
Castiel's blade clattered to the side, and Dean's heart skittered along with it. Uriel lifted Castiel up by the lapel, high enough that the toes of his scuffed Derby shoes barely even touched the floor.
For the most part, Dean kept his eyes squeezed shut, but when he opened them, the image of Cas arched above him, the tendons of his arms standing out as he braced himself, dark head hanging heavily between his shoulders and haloed by the ambient, warm light that seeped in through a crack in the blinds, etched itself into Dean's mind like acid in brilliant copperplate.
"Oh, I see," Pestilence said. "The body — it's yours now. And so it affects you, like bodies do. Ah, disease gets the bad rep, but really, it's the bodies that break down under the methodical,
Four years, and waking up from a nightmare to strange noises in your apartment sent the same surge of adrenaline flooding through him, made him get up quietly and advance on the dark figure he could make out against the living room window, like it was the most normal thing in the world.
"There's always work to do, Sam," he said. "Speaking of, Ellen, can you please direct us to some far less respectable establishment than this? I need to find some sucker to hustle at pool."
Two YOUNG MEN stand in front of their childhood home. The windows are dark, and the sun overhead is unforgiving.
Dean was touching him in turn, slowly and exploratory, his hand warm and broad on Cas' flank under the t-shirt. "Good morning to you too," he mumbled and shifted a little, just to bring Cas' attention to the heavy press of Dean's cock against his hip. His own pulsed with a slow kind of heat, responding to the proximity and the warm intent in Dean's eyes.
"Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess," he muttered. He heard the rustle of clothing as Castiel took a step closer to him. Dean lowered his hand from his eyes.
“Benny,” Dean said. He threw the empty shotgun at Henriksen and, without stopping to see if it hit him, he turned on his heel and booked it.
"Yeah," Dean said and downed the last of the whiskey. He thought of Castiel, how he'd better check up on him. "Yeah, I think I'll be around. Good to meet you, kid."
Ellen scoffed and put out her arm to lean on the doorframe. "Your daddy's reputation precedes you. How is John these days?"
Castiel looked down at his hands. Or– "No," he said. "Angels have grace. This body is not my true form."
He was now close enough that Dean could smell the sulphur on his breath. Knowing Sam was trapped inside, screaming, made Dean clench his fists and strain to break free of the demon's supernatural hold. But he could only watch helplessly as the demon shifted his grip on the knife and used it to cut a neat little slash across Dean's cheek. He felt the blood well out, hot and sticky, before the pain registered.
It made Dean feel defensive at the time — he'd squared his shoulders, glared at anyone who dared to snigger. It hadn't taken long for his reputation to go around; the kids knew he was trouble and could hold his own in a fight. They left him alone. Sam, on the other hand, Sam had made friends.
Their dad found them outside, both shivering despite the mild California weather. It was always coldest before dawn, they said.
"I don't want a fight," Dean said and slowly slipped the shotgun off his shoulder to land in the sandy earth. There was only one shot left in it.
Dean had to duck around the corner and press himself against the wall and hold his breath while two men with AK-47s marched past.
"Well, well, well," said the demon, with a frighteningly normal voice. "Sam Winchester as I live and breathe. Well, I say live–" He flicked out a hand, and from the corner of his eye, Sam could see Dean being pushed to the roadside with the same force that kept Sam pinned to the spot.
"Cas," Dean said, eyes fixed on Alastair's grinning mouth. Castiel didn't say anything, but he put a hand on Dean's shoulder, a warm, comforting weight. Dean closed his eyes for a second and then strode forward purposefully, so that Castiel's hands slipped off his shoulder.
If he had it half as bad as Sam, he had to be dying. Sam felt the death of their father as a burning coal in the pit of his stomach, a dull throbbing behind his eyes.
"They left me handcuffed to a table," Sam said, with all the scorn such an act deserved. He looked a little ruffled, but none the worse for wear. "They heard me talking to you, they're out there looking for you now!"
"Dean," she said, and without looking at it, she stretched out a hand and yanked the knife from Dean's hand, from several feet away. "I hope you've said your goodbyes, I have my hounds out for you as we speak."
They advanced, Dean with the Colt and Sam with the demon knife. The knife wouldn't help bringing down Famine, but it did come in handy when one of the demons struck out, and Sam intercepted it to bring it down. They couldn't waste the bullets.
"That's one hell of a trick," he said. Castiel turned away, to look at Uriel. Dean noticed that giant soot marks had spread out from his body, along the floor and up against the walls, in the shape of wings.
Dean felt a muscle jump in his jaw when he clenched his teeth. "Not even you can be in two places at once," Dean said and looked to the side where Benny wasn't trying to go around. When Henriksen turned his head to follow Dean's gaze, Dean swung the staff.
"Yeah, I know what a death echo is," Dean said. "Why don't you give me the town name, and me and Sam will go check it out?
Their breathing, though ragged, was in tandem, and everywhere they touched they were joined by sweat. Cas was so entranced by the heat of Dean's body, the intensity of his gaze, that his orgasm, when it came, welled over him as a surprise. Cas' breath stuttered, just like his hips, and he exhaled with the release.
Castiel blinked and then shook his head. "You're hurt," he said, voice fraught with emotion that Dean had trouble parsing. Was he angry?
"That is what we're trying to avoid," Castiel said archly. You could have lit a fire, his voice was so dry.
"Alright, track down the archangel Raphael's former vessel which he used to cast demons back down to Hell, summon Raphael to ask him where the hell God is, and then asking him nicely not to smite us before we then find God himself. I'd call that a game plan," Dean said and knocked his knuckles against the handle of the mug.
"Am I going to die? I mean, right now? Is that what this is?" Dean said and gestured between his ghost-form and his collapsed body on the floor.
Sam blinks awake, stretches like a cat. He’s been taller than Dean for almost five years now, but he still looks like a little kid to Dean, and never more so when he wakes up, bleary eyed and disoriented.
“I haven’t been entirely truthful with you, Dean,” Castiel said, still cradling Dean’s face tenderly. “My mission, to get you out at any cost—we have a purpose for you.”
After Dean's pie was but a memory, and Jo was about halfway through hers, Ruth swanned by again. "Can I refill your coffees?".
When Dean was eighteen and Sam had just turned fourteen, John had taken his boys to Palo Alto, California on a hunt. A ghost, Dean remembered, haunting a swimming pool and drowning young boys. Sam and Dean were left walking laps around the empty pool to make sure no innocent bystanders would end up hurt while their dad angered the spirit by digging up its bones and burning them, in a graveyard several miles away.
“Dean,” Castiel said again, after how long Dean had no idea. The sun had set, that was all he knew, and his tongue felt swollen, sticking to the roof of his mouth. “Dean,” Castiel said once more, with urgency, and Dean felt him touch his shoulders.
