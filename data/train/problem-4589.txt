“You changed me, Dean, for the better. I promise from this day forward to love and treasure you for the rest of my life, to be your rock when things get difficult, and to build a safe and loving home with you. I love you, Dean.”
Cas rebuilt his body, he thinks. Dean’s blood and entire body have already been claimed – and his heart too. He is no child of Cas’s – thank fuck – but Cas left his imprint on him. It should be enough.
“I don’t think he can like me, Gabriel,” Castiel insisted, looking around to make sure that no one could hear them.
Cas said he was not the angry, destructive man he knows he is, that he was a loving man, and yet, right when he is supposed to do the lovin’, he is being aggressive again.
And Dean will never tell Sam and Jack what really happened, because first, it’ll be too funny just watching them be
“Whoa, is it who I think it is?” she said to Dean. “You’re Castiel!” And she punched him in the arm too. “I’ve heard
Dean’s fingers stroke Cas’s face, explore him, love him. Cas cannot see, but he closes his eyes all the same. This is overwhelming. This is the best he will ever have, and he doesn’t want to miss any millisecond of it, even though he knows this memory will haunt and taunt him forever. He has reached a new level of happiness, though tainted with melancholy because this will not last: it is simply Dean battling with his own faith and making sure he has found the good angel.
“It is,” Castiel nodded. “We’re not... related, you know? We found each other. Castaway kids, runaway kids, orphans, foster kids, lost adults – We don’t work like families usually do, I think, but I don’t mind. I like it, actually.”
He turned his back to Castiel again; he was standing a bit hunched, as if he was ashamed. As he removed his leather sleeveless jacket and his shirt to reveal his muscled, toned back, Castiel wanted to reach out, touch the skin, massage the strong shoulders, and tell him it was alright, that he had difficulty with words too, and that he knew what a challenge opening up was for people like them, with parents like theirs; and perhaps, just perhaps, if he was daring enough, he could kiss Dean.
It was then that Castiel noticed that they had been inching closer to one another; that their knees were touching; that Dean’s trembling hand had gripped his; and that Dean still hadn’t made any effort towards fleeing or pushing Cas away, and hope bloomed in his chest, beautiful, tentative, and disbelieving .
He has to believe. He has to have faith in Cas. The person he’s holding hands with – no one else could touch him like that.
They were wide still, but with surprise and flickering hope this time. As wide as the door that was open before them now.
“Sleep,” Dean said again, as he fluffed up the pillows and tucked Castiel in the blankets. Everything was warm and comfy, and Cas felt himself drift away.
He just couldn’t stop kissing Cas. Biting, sucking, licking, cherishing, there were so many things to do. It was a whole new world for Dean, a new kind of Heaven, and he knew he would never be able to leave it, ever.
He promised himself the last time – that it’d be the last time indeed. Cas wouldn’t die on him again. Dean would be better.
Dean’s voice was softer than ever. It wasn’t simply that he was whispering; there was a gentle tone to his words, something Cas couldn’t quite put his finger on (as humans said).
“You can-- you can just tell me, Cas,” he said softly. “It’s okay. I promise it’s okay. I--” Dean didn’t know what to say.
“At least it’s not my most expensive shirt,” Dean mumbled. “I’ll have to change, though. I, uh – I have a spare shirt in my car.” He was looking at Cas expectantly. “Are you – do you still have work to do, or—”
Nothing was more stunning that Dean’s face leaning over him, though, his features both creased with worry and relaxed with relief.
about you! I knew you seemed dreamy. I thought you’d be shorter.” She smiled. “I think we’re going to be best friends!”
“Dean,” Cas whispered, almost frantically. His hands grabbed Dean’s hips, and Dean was now riding Cas, and he couldn’t tell whether it was Cas who was rocking Dean against him or if Cas was just holding him or if maybe they were moving in sync. It was frantic, it was messy, it was too much and too little, it was perfect; it was Cas moaning his name over and over again and Dean groaning and being unable to stop and the friction between their cocks and Cas’s body between his thighs -- Cas was going nowhere, Cas was securely held there -- and everything was hot and--
And Castiel would see Dean in person again, after six months. It was... a lot. It was too much, because now Castiel no longer harboured a silly crush, he was in love with the man. Dean would be able to see it on his face, probably. What if Dean didn’t reciprocate?
She gestured nonchalantly towards the black rift opened behind her. “Get in here, Winchester. He’s waiting for you on the other side. Get him back... if you can.”
could abandon you. Not happening, Cas.” He hesitated, looking down at his hands. “Hey, Cas, you – you know that I’m here for you, right? No matter what. The good and the bad, I’m here for... everything.”
“We’re family,” Dean protested. “I never said it was normal -- it’s not, he shouldn’t have done all that -- but Sam and I… we’re his family,” he concluded lamely. “That’s what family does.”
“He was flirting with you,” Rowena insisted. “I saw it with my own two eyes! Smiling at you with this devastatingly handsome charm of his... asking you to come to the dancefloor... Romance in the making! So why did you let him go?”
the photographer, after all – people smiled for the camera and the posterity, not for the human behind it. Castiel felt his cheeks burn harder with shame.
The voice was growing clearer, and he was confused. This Dean was not begging for him to stop doing something or to come back or to help him, but simply to wake up.
have had another wedding booked that day, but I think your talents would be best used for this wedding. Unless, of course, you would rather attend the other wedding—” she said airily.
Gabriel’s smile was just a shade shy of bitter. Castiel couldn’t help but feel sad for him – every time Gabriel thought he had found love, it escaped him. That time with Kali had hurt especially hard. Castiel thought sometimes that there might be something between Gabriel and Rowena... but if there was, they never talked about it.
His heart is beating faster with panic. He can’t find Cas. Where is Cas? He’s blind, he’s deaf, there’s no way he can bring Cas back. He doesn’t even see the rift he’s just crossed. It should be behind him; it’s not. There is nothing, no way out.
.” His eyes are greener than ever, and shining with tears. Cas has seen Dean cry more today than he has before. He remembers what Sam said to him once, that his loss was always too much for Dean, that Dean always fell into a self-destructive spiral when Cas died. He has never truly grasped what Sam really meant, until now.
“It was in a text conversation, people mention a lot of unprompted and unrelated things in text conversations.”
“Look at the two of you!” she said. “A doctor and a cowboy – you look almost as cute as Dorothy and me!” She winked at Dean. “You and cowboys, huh?”
He propped Cas up, cradling him. His hand stroked the black unruly hair and his other hand intertwined with Cas’ as he spoke. “Wake up, Cas,” he whispered, close to his ear so that no one but his angel could hear. “It’s me. I’m bringing you home. Wake up.”
Balthazar’s grin was eerily similar to that of the Cheshire cat. Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows at Castiel excitedly, looking like he was enjoying the show. Meg and Claire were both looking at Dean through narrowed eyes, as if they were both looking for an opportunity to gauge his eyes out if he stepped out of line. Rowena was holding a glass of wine, enjoying herself; her smile was one of deep satisfaction. Kaia gave Castiel an approving smile.
and that simple fact made the kiss better than any he’d ever had. There was more happiness in a single, clumsy kiss shared with Cas than Dean had ever felt. It was
“Well, of course,” Dean says. “It’d be pretty horrible if it did – I mean, I want you to be happy for other reasons, right? Because – well, you said it, good things do happen, and I want you to be happy – y’know, in general?” He’s babbling, oh fuck, he’s babbling. He just wants to say that Cas’s happiness should not rely on one man, or on this man loving him back; that Cas deserves all the happiness in the world; that he hates that Cas is so depressed, so self-hating that he cannot find happiness in the little things of life –
“Well. Maybe I also told her that she’d never sleep again if she kept you, because I’d – well, I’d do anything to yet you back. I mean, we. Me and Sam and Jack.”
“Forbidding you from being happy... What kind of son of a bitch comes up with that?” Dean wondered, his face frowned in disgust.
"Well, of course I don't want him to-- you'd embarrass him!" Dean splurted, trying to  ignore how much his cheeks were burning.
He can smell Cas’s smell, now, though – ozone and honey, a strange combination that Dean has always found incredibly attractive. It smells like home, like a promise. In his dreams, where he is braver than he really is, Dean often burrows his head in the crook of Cas’s neck and breathes Cas in. Little did he know it was something that he could have – that it was his for the taking.
“Hello, you! Dean Winchester, professional heartbreaker, I gather?” Bal asked. “I’m Balthazar, Castiel’s best family member.”
. Dean’s hands leave Cas’s face to embrace his waist under the trench coat and caress his ribs. Cas leaves a trail of open-mouthed kisses on Dean’s neck, and tastes Dean’s sighs. The kisses they trade become passionate, until they can’t breathe anymore. But they don’t stop. Their lips separate for the smallest time before they kiss again. They whisper each other’s name on each other’s lips. They smile into their kisses. They press their bodies together, closer, closer, closer. They devour each other.
this is Cas? If he brings someone else back, his chance is over, and Cas will stay trapped here; they’ll never be together, Cas will never be happy. He can’t bear that thought.
Dean didn’t know, though, that the tenderness in his touch was breaking Cas, just a little, at the same time that it healed him. Cas hadn’t known either, until now, that a mere touch could repair and rupture at the same time. Cas felt resurrected and torn at the seams, and he relished every second of it, even through the pain in his body and the sting of the needle.
All this time wasted thinking Cas couldn’t possibly love him back – that he was so out of Dean’s league that it wasn’t even an option – that Dean didn’t deserve it anyway – that it would only end in tragedy – that it wasn’t normal and good to feel that way for his best friend, his angel – that Cas surely didn’t have feelings like that – and Cas had liked April and Meg anyways – and there was nothing Dean could offer...
“You don’t know-- you don’t know how hard it is without you,” Dean explained sleepily. “I just love you too much.”
She blinks, looks away. Silence stretches out between them, and once again, Dean has to stifle hope, nip it in the bud to avoid being disappointed.
is much better. He is sad, though, to see that Dean cannot bring himself to say the words, and he wonders why it is so. Is it that Dean cannot accept that he is loved, and that he is worthy of this love? Or is it that Dean wants to ignore the truth that hangs between them, the truth that Cas blurted out once he was sure there would be no consequences?
The Empty smiles like a cat that has just played the mice and eaten them. “Well, my dear little Dean Winchester, I love sleeping, and making fair deals, but I
“Let’s stop fighting, Dean,” Cas said exhaustedly. “I hate fighting with you. I don’t want that anymore.”
The third one is more tentative. They explore each other, unhurriedly. They test the waters, move their lips against one another’s. They discover each other’s taste, and they know they’re ruined for any other taste in the world.
“I could have told you, too.” Cas pulled back, leaving Dean to miss the feeling of Cas’s forehead against his. But then Cas hugged him tight, resting his cheek against Dean’s. “It took me time to realise that it was love. And then -- I didn’t think you could love me back.”
Cas gets one step closer, almost embracing him, but not quite – because Cas doesn’t think Dean loves him.
Castiel looked at the meadow where the party was taking place. The newlyweds had left, two of the witnesses were drunk-dancing together, and Rowena was nowhere in sight. Perhaps Dean was right. He gratefully accepted the slice of cake.
“What?” Cas looked up so quickly that his neck cracked. “Dean. Of course not. I would never regret meeting you and choosing you. Never. I thought – I thought I had made that clear. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, Dean.”
Castiel took a mouthful of cake in order to avoid any further questions. His story always seemed... bland and uninteresting when he told the short version of it. It didn’t convey the poetry of shapes, the immortalising of the ephemeral, the beauty of capturing the littlest things that had drawn him to photography in the first place. But the long (and uneventful) version of the story would take too much time, and no one liked listening to Castiel for very long – apart from his family.
For one moment, Dean can’t even breathe. It takes its time to sink in, as he replays Cas’s words over and over and over.
Perhaps that was because Cas had uttered the word “love” again. It probably made Dean nervous. Perhaps he didn’t know how to tell Cas what he already knew – that his feelings weren’t returned and would never be, and that he, Dean, had difficulties dealing with Castiel’s revelation.
He raises another hand. He feels a chest – yeah, a masculine one – and he can feel a heart beating. It beats fast. He has never been so close to Cas; he can’t know if it’s
, and Dean knows they’d be good for each other – they’d repair each other, they’d be happy, he just knows it.
Cas was looking at him as if Dean was the best thing he’d ever seen. He had propped himself up but he hadn’t disentangled himself from Dean’s embrace. Not that Dean wanted him too.
“The little angel! I knew it. It was obvious, of course. Did he finally tell you he loved you? Oh, of course he did. That’s why he was happy enough for me to take him, huh? You and him got all loved up –”
Maybe Jack hadn’t only wanted to speak about faith and love when he spoke about Dean’s heart. Maybe he also meant that
What happened if an angel died in the Empty? Was there someplace else dead angels went to if their remnants were killed? Would it be purely empty there, Cas wondered – no noise, no darkness, no torture, nothing, not even awareness?
This time, he couldn’t say who leant in first. Their lips crashed half-way, making Dean moan. Cas was devouring his lips, quite literally. Dean felt like he was a tasty treat that Cas couldn’t get enough of, and fuck it if he didn’t love this feeling. He bit Cas’s lower lip, playfully, and Cas licked his in retaliation, making Dean moan once again.
“C’mon guys, you know that Clarence sucks at relationships. Leave him alone,” Meg drawled. Then she winked at him, in a not-so-subtle reminder of the time she had a thing for him. Castiel rolled his eyes in answer.
She remains silent for a while, mulling over what Dean’s just said. His fists are clenched so hard his nails hurt the sensitive skin of his hands.
His family had assuaged these questions, a little. His family and he had fashioned each other, and were perfect for each other. They loved him, unconditionally, and he loved them too. And that was enough for him.
“I – I know that, Cas,” Dean says. His voice is low, almost a whisper. It is broken, too. “I’d have done the same thing. Hell, I’
When Dean woke up in the morning, he immediately thought that Cas should be there, next to him. When Miracle jumped on his bed and Dean hugged him, all he heard was Cas’s voice -- ‘Good things do happen, Dean’ -- and the scream in his head -- ‘then if miracles happen why aren’t you back, Cas?’ When he got down to the kitchen every morning and made food and walked to the war room and went on with his day, there was nothing but Cas’s deafening silence. Sometimes it was easy to imagine that he was simply away on a mission, as usual, but it was not as if Dean had ever liked it when Cas was away. (And the time was gone when Dean actively pretended that he was fine when Cas wasn’t there and that he didn’t care that much about him anyway.)
But Dean seized its sleeves and helped Cas out of them. “I want to undress you,” he said, and then he felt stupid saying that.
He just can’t let that one go. He can’t let Cas die without telling him “I love you too.” He can’t let Cas think for all eternity that his feelings were unrequited. He can’t. He can’t do that to Cas. Cas deserves so much fucking better.
Shit, Dean was crying now. But Cas’ eyes were shining with tears too, and – oh, well, it was his wedding day, he was allowed to cry a little.
“Because I love you,” Dean answered. Why bother lying? He was Cas’s already. He had nothing to hide from Cas.
It was what Castiel loved best about their house. He loved coming home and touching the mezuzah on their doorway. He loved the smell of the candles from Gabriel’s shrine and Rowena’s altar (and the many talismans and crystals lying around the house), and to contribute to them with whatever he found in nature during his lone photography sessions. He loved that Kaia’s handmade dreamcatcher hung above his bed watching over him when he was most vulnerable, and that in his pillow was a charm Rowena made him to sleep better – it smelled like lavender and chamomile and peppermint, it smelled like home.
He couldn’t help but wonder at how loud Cas was. That was a turn-on: his cock was growing harder with every of Cas’s moans, and Dean knew he was spoiled for any other sound now that he had heard the music of Cas’s pleasure. Would Cas scream when Dean would put his hand on his cock? When Dean would lick and suck on his dick? When Dean would enter him-- when
Or maybe is it the Empty that is tricking him? After all, Castiel is awake, and the Empty still has not appeared to him. It should have, by now – it can’t sleep if a resident is awake. Perhaps the Empty cannot sleep and is keeping him awake for sometime (or forever) to torture him. Castiel is not informed of what this entity can or cannot do. If it can see in Castiel’s heart who he loves, then surely it can imitate Dean’s voice.
Should he hug the kid or…? Jack was God after all, he might not like it. And Dean had been nothing but horrible to him all this time. Looking back on it, Dean didn’t even know why. It was just Jack, shy, nice, innocent little Jack, who made terrible mistakes but who wasn’t a bad kid. Dean hated himself for what he’d done to him, and because of that, he went and hugged Jack.
“Dean,” Cas answered in kind as he unzipped Dean’s pants. Dean had to lift himself up to help Cas remove the pants. The loss of Cas’s cock left a bitter absence, and that was all Dean could focus on until Cas said, “Dean, I believe you’d rather remove your shoes.”
This Sunday, however... well, he had Dean to talk about. Garth and Bess’ wedding had taken place on Friday, and he hadn’t had the time to tell his family about it on Saturday.
“That’s all you told him about me?” Gabe complained after high-fiving Dean (instead of the polite handshake Dean had gone for). “Gabe likes candy? That’s all? I thought I had done more legendary things!”
He was good, it was so good, but if they kept going he’d come in his pants like a teenager and that wasn’t exactly how he planned his first time with Cas to go.
Castiel would have loved to say that it was perfect. It wasn’t; they accidentally missed their target and Dean kissed the corner of his lips rather than the lips themselves. They tried again, and their noses bumped, the cold skin making them jump. They couldn’t stop laughing; it was perfect, in its own imperfect way.
Removing the stitches was not quite as making them. This time, the silence that stretched between them was anything but comfortable. Dean’s fingers barely touched Cas’s skin, as if Dean was afraid of contact now that there was no urgency and now that the elation over their victory had faded. Cas willed himself not to care, but it was a lost cause.
Castiel nodded, and he thought, dimly, that if dying and being injured was what it took for Dean to be so gentle, he should do it more often.
Rowena wrote. Of course she took the time to work on it after Cas’s last death. She loves Cas, too. Not like Dean does, but she does.
, Cas’s taste. Nothing compared to that; no words came to mind. And the touch of him under his hand -- the skin of his neck and the tingly hair he was petting…
“The brides had met in an ice-skating competition,” Castiel said. “They were rivals, they fought for years – until they fell in love and went from rivals to wives.”
When he walked out of the room he found Dean waiting for him, sitting on the bed and holding a tray full of food. His eyes trailed on Cas’s body, taking in the fact that Cas was wearing his clothes, and he quickly looked down on the tray. “I cooked you some food,” he said, “you need it, I guess.”
Dean hesitated a fraction of a second, but then he smiled. “Well. I haven’t eaten anything at Jo and Anna’s wedding, so. Sounds like a good idea.”
There were bodies scattered all around him. His siblings, murdered by his blade. His siblings again, fallen victim to his wars. Angels and humans he killed. Angels and humans he hadn’t been able to save. The bodies were innumerable.
This time Castiel drowned. He drowned in the smell of Dean, all musk and leather and something else he’d have time to identify later; he drowned in Dean’s warmth, in the taste of his lips against his own and in the safety of Dean’s arms wrapped around him.
Or perhaps it was just the soulmark speaking, he thought as he rubbed his chest, on the spot over his heart where his soulmark was inked into his skin, deeper and more eternal than any tattoo, for better or for worse. It was burning like the pits of hell – it did that often, and of course it had to choose a wedding to manifest itself.
Dean nodded. “Yeah.” He sucked in a breath.  “I mean, how could you – it’s me, and I’m not – I’m too... ”
If it was subtext, it was lost on him. He was better at understanding Spanish (a language he didn’t even speak) than he was at understanding subtext.
“Oh?” says Meg. “Well, glad I took her, then. She thought she’d be the boss of me – ha! Used me – told me to let the Nephilim go – well, she got what she deserved.”
would he have mentioned that he’s single if he wasn’t interested?” Gabe rolled his eyes. “Read the signals, Cassie.”
. He had to take the pictures he was hired to take; he couldn’t let the newlyweds start their new life without pictures of the moment it officially began. Dean had probably seen him anyway. Castiel was not going to check, but it was likely he had.
Of course he’d suspect it had something to do with sexy times (well, he wasn’t entirely wrong about that). But what Dean loved most about it was just how
“Never say goodbye ever again, Cas, you hear me?” he growls. He hates himself for it as soon as the words leave his mouth. He
“And then – we spent the rest of the evening talking,” Castiel confessed, failing to completely bite back a smile.
Dean knew he couldn’t have what he wanted, either – except that he could, and he was too stupid to realise it. It’s so blaringly obvious now, in everything Cas has ever said and done. Every touch of his fingers on Dean’s skin – if Dean hadn’t been so busy wishing the butterflies away he would have known. Every time Cas adverted his eyes, kept himself from looking – Dean should have seen it, because he always did the same thing, but hey, he was probably too busy looking away too.
“I’m ready to photograph them once they’re out.” Castiel looked around. “Usually, the guests are out and waiting for the newlyweds to come out too, but I suppose it’s a little bit too cold.” He frowned. “Did you come out in the cold to talk to me?”
He stroked Cas’s cock, slowly, rejoicing in Cas’s sighs of pleasure. There was already precome on the tip, and Dean decided to use it as a natural lubricant. When he brushed his thumb against the tip, Cas gasped and moaned, and Dean just
in Castiel’s eyes during the entirety of Benny and Andrea’s wedding, and he remembered what had happened as soon as they got home even more vividly. Too bad he only wore tuxedos for weddings.
He looked up at Cas, only to see the same uncertainty and lack of confidence that polluted his own thoughts. How weird was that, that Cas was able to look him in the eye and pour his heart out and reveal his love in all its beauty but was still so unsure that Dean loved him for himself?
Of course, now that he is awake, he feels some regret. He did not expect to be awake in the Empty, and to be conscious in a world without Dean. But it is worth it; his happiness shall not be tainted by the futile hope of what he cannot have.
But, he found with wonder and stupefaction, Dean was looking at him just like he had the night before: with awe, and incredulity, and – and
He put the book aside and smiled at Dean -- one of those soft little secret smiles that Dean sometimes liked to think was just for him; one of those discreet smiles that lit up the whole room and made Dean feel lighter and made him want to kiss Cas, or perhaps to caress Cas’s lips, or just to let the dangerous Words out.
It had been two months and a half since Charlie and Dorothy’s wedding. Castiel and Dean had not talked ever since. Dean had sent a text that read,
. Of course, the mark would probably fade pretty quickly, with all the angel healing and what not, but somehow, Dean doubted it, because Cas could have magicked it away already and yet the hickey was still facing Dean, the red proof that Cas was his and he was Cas’s.
The thing with photography was that Castiel always saw things from a distance. Or at least, he did until he was adjusting and printing the pictures in his shop, and then he had all the leeway he wanted to look closely at the details. But now that the best man was sitting in front of him, still grinning, he could see it all, and he was not safely hidden away behind his camera or in his studio.
He wouldn’t be throwing the Words into the open, no; he would be giving them to Cas, Cas who loved him back, and the Words would soon be safely tucked away -- but in Cas’s heart this time.
Castiel had to think about it. “I don’t think he did, no,” he said softly. “He was... very focused on our conversation.”
Sam frowned, and Dean saw the precise moment when he took in Dean’s and Cas’s hands, locked together; and then the way they were standing close to each other; then Cas’s clothes; then the gloriously red lovebite on Cas’s neck; and the moment when he pieced it together with the noises he had probably heard during the night. Dean waited, embarrassed and a little bit stressed out; but Sam, after flushing very red, broke into a large smile and said, “Of course. I’m so happy for you guys.”
“I think I’ve heard worse,” Jack mused, which didn’t reassure Castiel about their parenting abilities in the slightest.
“It’s amazing work,” the best man said, handing him his camera back. “Really good pics. You have talent, man.”
Cas was right. It is freeing, after all. To admit it all. To confess it all. And the Empty doesn’t even blink – doesn’t even seem to consider it abnormal. She says it as if it were a universal truth. Something simple, unquestionable.
unreal. After all these years with this mark on his chest, he had finally found – after all this time spent thinking about Dean and falling in love—
A part of him screams that this is Cas, that the Empty is cruel but honest, that his heart can’t be wrong. The other part is terrified because he has no proof, because he’s probably been played, because he needs Cas and he can’t be sure, and he hates himself for not being sure.
“I still am,” Castiel confessed. It was easier to do it now that he knew for sure that Dean had feelings for him... and now that this wasn’t the biggest admission he had to make. “I thought it was obvious.”
Dean’s eyes went round and wide for a moment, as though he were horrified and afraid at the same time. He stood up in a hurry and turned his back to Cas; the tension was back in his shoulders and neck all of a sudden. He rummaged through his cupboard. “Here – a tee and pants – they should fit – take them – I lend them to you – I
“It was the strippers. We had to call Bal and to ask him to find Chippendales as quickly as he could.”
would be gone. Of course, it wasn’t as if Dean had ever harbored any hope… he knew it was impossible... but there was comfort and hope in silence. Silence left the door ajar just enough to think you could maybe one day cross the threshold and have every forbidden fantasy that was hidden behind.
Dean was ashamed to say that he tuned out most of what Donatello said. He was lost in the blue of Cas’ eyes – the man he would soon be able to call his husband. The good, the bad, the unexpected, the joys and dreams and sorrows; they had already committed to that, and he couldn’t wait to have more of it, more of Cas, more of them together.
It was all for Dean to take, and – oh – he took – but never the right thing. He’s kept Cas at arm’s length, pushed him away, he’s hidden away the one thing that could have make them both happy, he treated Cas like pure shit...
And to think that this is the fate Chuck designed for all his angels – and for all the demons, too... His own children... It makes Dean sick.
“Cas, come on. I’m not leaving you here. You won’t rot in Hell. Come with me,” Dean insisted. “Don’t listen to them, Cas, please.”
Over one year had passed, and Castiel hadn’t thought much about Dean Winchester. There wasn’t much to mull over, since he didn’t know him at all and their meeting had been but a few lost minutes in Castiel’s life. Yet, Dean was all he could think about during the whole ceremony.
“Name’s Miracle,” Dean said, and he wanted to ask more questions, but Jack was busy petting Miracle and playing with him. (“You’re so pretty!”)
“You know what? I’m so tired of him that if you manage to get him back you can keep him. He’ll go to Heaven or Hell or God’s ass when he dies, I don’t even care.”
Dean was the one destiny had planned for him, the one that was Castiel’s perfect match – no wonder he had fallen so quick, no wonder he had felt something special from the first time—
“Family,” Castiel answered curtly. “Do you want to hear the story or would you rather keep on interrupting me?”
Chapter 4 was a little longer than planned, so there'll be 5 chapters instead of 4 :) more Destiel for you!
The blush on Castiel’s cheeks still burned after all this time, but this time it also made his skin tingle with possibility, because Gabe was right and Dean liked that about him. “Still – I want to be clear... Your jokes, today... Were those pick-up lines?”
Dean was as handsome as always, but this time there was a particular joy on his face. Castiel could tell that Dean
The gooey tentacles were more and more numerous by the minute. They were not attacking Dean – perhaps, Cas supposed in his fevered, half-conscious state, because Dean was human and humans weren’t the Empty’s prerogative – but they seemingly took great pleasure in attacking Cas. Their touch burnt; their grip scarred. They attacked his legs, his face, his arms, his torso, his grace itself.
“Thanks for telling off that dude, by the way,” Dean said, cutting him off in his musings. “You know. The Pro-Destiny one.”
Castiel can feel, though. He feels Dean’s hand, soft and hesitant, on his shoulder. Then on his arm. Then Dean catches his hand, and squeezes it, soft and hard at the same time, like he has finally found what he has been looking for and cannot let go, but is unsure of his luck at the same time.
When Castiel went to bed that night, though, he couldn’t help but remember it all as he stood bare-chested in front of his mirror, his soulmark staring right at him like a taunting from Destiny.
in his eyes... Dean’s lips had never looked more attractive, pink and plump and slightly open, and it would be easy to—
They were moving without sync or grace, but Castiel felt good. They were flirting, his feelings were welcome, and he was having fun. This would be a night to remember, and he wanted to remember it all – the stroboscopic lights, the song, the feeling of Dean’s hand in his own and Dean’s other hand on his waist and Dean’s shoulder under his own hand, and the promise of what was to come—
It was December, and it was the day of the Big Decoration Time, as they called it in true poetic fashion. A Christmas tree stooped over like a vodka aunt past her prime, straining under the weight of numerous, gaudy garlands and one lone bulb. It stood at one end of the living room, faced with a Yule Altar with all the candles untouched for now, as were the candles of the Menorah. It was too early to drunkenly set fire to their mismatched furniture with the fiery aspects of celebrations, after all. The log they would burn on Yuletide was standing next to the chimney, tripping everyone like a gleeful little Grinch; the garlands and the Hanukkah string lights were tangled together
Dean didn’t know what to do. He wanted to ask again, to insist, to run away, to laugh and say it was a joke, to kiss Cas, to admit the truth and be done with it. In the end, he just waited here. He couldn’t move, and he couldn’t speak as the silence stretched out and the question was left hanging between them.
the man. He was one of those people who were naturally photogenic: he didn’t need any instruction to strike the perfect pose, and the camera only enhanced his regular features and made him look like a model. If Castiel had been in the fashion business, he knew he would have spent hours-long sessions snapping away, trying to frame the broad shoulders, the chiselled jaw, the light dancing across his skin, the confident smile.
“You could come in and eat with us. Dinner’s ready, and we’d love to know more about you,” Gabriel suggested. He winked at the both of them in a very unsubtle fashion.
It was an out for him, he realised suddenly. He could go with Dean’s version of what happened, tell Dean that he indeed meant brotherly love, and forget the mortifying embarrassment and the fear of rejection.
It was hard to fake a cocky smile and a dismissive tone of voice, but Dean was used to fake not wanting things. The words still left a bitter taste in his mouth, and he prayed that Cas wouldn’t look too close, wouldn’t look him in the eye, because he was sure the truth was there for him to see. If Cas saw the sadness in his eyes, he would have questions. He would wonder. And maybe he would know that Dean felt things for him and that’d make everyone very uncomfortable. The only thing worse than Cas saying ‘no’ was Cas knowing.
“I want you too,” Cas said. He grabbed Dean’s legs and brought him closer, and suddenly instead of lying on Cas Dean was straddling him, and their erections were touching-- oh
. I – It doesn’t matter. It was just a joke.” Dean chuckled. “What I mean is – Ain’t no rodeo clown that can keep me off you. If you see what I mean.”
me, you see? I want someone who’ll choose me after seeing the good and the bad, not someone who will want me only because destiny said it was to be. I don’t want someone expecting this perfect boyfriend and being disappointed when they see what a mess I am. I want someone who is
like Jack indeed – sweet, innocent, loving – and Jack seemed happy, and Dean sounded happy too, and that was all that mattered.
Dean gave a final lick and dropped a final kiss, and replaced his mouth with his hand. He wasn’t totally ready for Cas to cum in his mouth, not yet, not until a few lovemaking sessions down the road; but watching Cas come by his hand was already the best thing Dean had ever seen. The way Cas threw back his head in pleasure, eyes closed and mouth open, screaming “Dean!”... This was a picture that would forever be engraved in his memory, and cherished.
falling in love, naturally.” He blinked, then he looked away. “Hum. I’m sorry. Shouldn’t have unloaded on you. It’s just – people’ve been pestering me about soulmates recently, and...”
Charlie’s eyes on him grew full of pity, so he scolded his features into something smooth and unconcerned, because he couldn’t let her
“Well, not everybody does. I guess we’re lucky we found you. And, um, and Rowena too, of course,” he hurried to add. “She’s great. Scary, but great. And she does all kindsa stuff, no problem.”
“That’s what the Empty does,” Cas explained. “It makes us relive our failures and our regrets on a loop.”
. Unless Castiel sprinted – but that would be pathetic. Still, he thought about it for a solid five seconds before he sighed and turned on his heels.
And then, because he felt like it wasn’t enough and because he was a bundle of nerves, he unbuttoned his own shirt. His fingers were trembling, but he managed to open it nonetheless. The cold stung; but his mark felt oddly warm as he exposed it to the night breeze and to Dean’s stunned gaze.
There was no end to that silence, and Dean hated that just like Dean hated Cas’s lack of boundaries. Too much hope and too much wanting only for the door to close in the end.
“Oh.” Dean gulped. Castiel couldn’t help but look as he licked his lips nervously. “Cas, it’s not – I don’t like soulmarks because they force things on us, you see? People see they’re soulmates and they jump into a relationship together without even knowing each other or – or
He deserves better than Dean, too, but maybe that shouldn’t matter. Maybe they should just take what they want and be happy, and fuck all the rest.
But Castiel had not noticed only the best man’s pleasant face. He had noticed the little things too: how he had lowered himself on one knee to comfort one of the flower girls when she had tripped and spilled all the petals in her basket, how he had hugged the bride and signed to her ‘welcome to the family, sister’ once she had kissed the groom, how he had tried to hide his tears during the ceremony. Perhaps the best man wasn’t enjoying his torment. Perhaps he was simply pitying him. Castiel himself felt plenty pitiable at that moment, so it was plausible.
Sam will kill him when he gets home and sees the mess Dean is leaving – books discarded and scattered on the floor, open boxes of dangerous artefacts –
“You’ve come back before,” Dean said more softly. His eyes were brimming with tears, Castiel realised with horror. He was making Dean suffer, once again. “Cas, please, don’t –“ This was Dean begging, he realised belatedly. “Cas. Please wake up. I need you.”
Dean  gets closer, ever so slowly. He is terrified, terrified beyond words, but he has to do it, he wants to do it. If he can’t say it – he can show it. He can
“Castiel, Dean, your marriage will be a lifelong promise of love, respect, and trust. This union represents your commitment to support one another through the good, the bad, and the unexpected – to share your joys, your dreams as well as your sorrows. A strong bond works in unison –”
“Careful, buddy,” Dean laughed. And then he was helping Castiel, his fingers brushing on the sensitive skin of Cas’ neck... and he couldn’t have missed the way Castiel shuddered under his touch...
“They do. Rowena only cares about love – and business, too. She made it her objective when she started her business: to provide a beautiful wedding to everyone, even the ones who don’t fit with the rest of society.”
“Everything,” Cas said seriously. “I love every part of you. And I want everything with you.” He looked down for a second. “If you want to, that is.”
“Thank you,” Cas said. He hoped Dean couldn’t see how flustered the compliment and their proximity made him.
Nonetheless, Cas is weak when it comes to Dean, so he lets himself enjoy every little detail of it: Dean’s arms around his shoulders, one of his hands between Cas’s shoulder blades and the other on the base of Cas’s skull, in his hair (
Was it what it felt like to love and to be loved like this? So absolutely, so completely? So powerfully that Cas had defied destiny for him and Dean had found his way in nothingness to find him?
“Are you sure you want to spend time with me? Your friends—” He waved towards the meadow, where a couple of very intoxicated women were doing cartwheels in what was supposed to be sync, but failed just a little to be endearing.
Cas smiled back. His eyes were searching Dean’s face, looking at his eyes, then at his mouth, then at his eyes again. “Hello, Dean,” he answered, his voice soft and barely more than a whisper. His smile was beautiful.
“I don’t believe it would change anything. Angels... aren’t supposed to feel. There is a reason why I started to fall once I was more acquainted with humanity, and why Anna had to rip her own grace away. When Chuck brought me back and gave me my powers, he only postponed the inevitable. Once an angel feels like a human... I guess he stops being an angel.”
Dean thinks. Tears and despair burn his eyes again. Does it end because Cas never had a Nephilim child? It can’t be possible.
“Good. Don’t you go and seduce anyone until you’re old enough,” Meg warned. “And you, Clarence, don’t worry either. We have your back.”
Dean is trembling with all his body. Fear? Adrenaline? Emotion? Castiel wants to comfort him, embrace him, until his body goes soft with trust and calm. He knows he cannot. He would never expect Dean to accept that; it would be too much to ask. Castiel can’t be as selfish as to take without Dean’s enthusiastic consent.
Dean knows that if he manages to wreak this dam, everything will pour out like a raging river, in a thunderous roar that will break and rebuild everything. But he’s been containing things for so long...
Dean loved Charlie. He really did. What was not to love about Charlie? She was witty and clever, fun to be around, nice and supportive. Every time their paths met Dean was sure to have a delightful day -- either because they were LARPing or binging series together, or because Charlie brought an extravagant hunt with her. Charlie was the little sister he never had.
“Fine, fine. Start with the number, Cassie, and we’ll see how far that takes you.” Balthazar winked.
“Hello, I guess,” Claire muttered, after Kaia gave her a blinding smile – Kaia was the only person in the world who had that effect on her, except for Jack.
Jack shook his head. “I don’t think so.  You already have what you need. That’s why you’re the only one who can do it.”
him to roll over in his grave, you know? It’s kinda funny that none of his three sons ended up obeying his sacred rules about love.”
A scowl screws up Meg’s face. “No. I can’t. She lied to me, and paid for it. That was the deal too. And what deal can you give me, Dean Winchester? There’s nothing you can give me.”
“Uh, he’s one of those? Not a huge loss then,” Kaia frowned as if Gabe’s dog had left a particularly putrid mess in the middle of the living-room again.
Dean looked up to Cas’s face above him, as Cas propped himself up a little. Now that he was certain that they had both come back in one piece, everything hit him with the strength of a truck going full speed. How Cas had fallen on him, how their legs were tangled, how close Cas was.
“We barely had time to talk, though,” Cas said mournfully. “We had a beautiful conversation after the ceremony, but after that, I only saw him in passing during the party. I couldn’t do what you said – I didn’t have the time to seduce him.”
Was it foolish to hope that the answer would be ‘yes’? Surely there was no joy in the prospect of Dean catching a cold only to talk to him...
Dean nodded. “I think I get it. For a long time, my family was just Dad and Sam and I, y’know? But then – I met people, I guess.” He looked wistful. Then he said, very slowly, almost tentatively, “And you do both soulmates and non-soulmates weddings, too. People usually have... strong opinions about that.”
They could have been so much more, if only Dean had been true to all the promises he made every time Cas died. That he would stop lashing out and pushing him away, that he would tell him, that he’d been honest with himself. He swore to himself the last time that if one day, by a miracle... but a miracle happened and Dean... remained himself.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh. “This... very odd couple decided to marry on a whim, and they had Rowena do everything very quickly. They sent in a note saying that they wanted a lot of Chippendales at their wedding.”
.” He did his best to sneer as if all this conversation was ridiculous (and it was. Yes. Of course it was! Why were they even speaking about it, that was stupid, so stupid…). “The truth is that Cas isn’t in love with me.”
is sure that this is Dean, because he has heard Dean’s prayer and Dean’s ritual. But for Dean, Castiel must be but an unknown person that might or might not be Cas.
“You’re Castiel’s family,” Dean said. Castiel could see it then, the way he focused on Gabriel and stood a little straighter as if to make a good impression – good Lord. “You like candy – you must be Gabriel.”
It shouldn’t have been that easy. And yet, it was. Perhaps the Empty was busy doing fuck knows what. It was all too easy. It would probably blow up in their faces spectacularly later on, but Dean couldn’t get himself to care. The only real thing, right now, was Cas’s hand in his own as they walked towards the rift. Cas’s fingers, warm and pressing his own fervently. Cas’s hand in his own, something he’d never thought he could get. But Cas loved him, as Dean loved him. It was real, it was
Finally, Cas relents. Dean takes a step backward, and Cas follows. They are still holding hands, and it is anchoring Dean more than anything else has ever done.
He pulled, slightly embarrassed. Cas might love him, but Cas was probably not interested in sex. He was an angel after all. He had had sex with that Reaper back when he was human, but Cas as an angel had never shown
“That typo was really funny, I don’t understand why she didn’t like it,” Charlie went on. “‘Aygust’ instead of ‘August’... It spells “gay UST” if you scramble the letters, that’s funny! I know you liked it,” she said, giving Dean’s shoulder a swat. “When he saw it in his mailbox and opened it, he laughed so much he fell off his chair.”
Jack grew serious all of a sudden. “Of course. Cas.” His tone was one of sadness and resentment, not unlike Dean’s, and Dean wondered why it had taken him so much time to call Jack, when Jack was possibly the only one who felt this loss as acutely as him.
There was Cas’s ‘yes’ -- soft and hesitant, an admission and a question -- and Dean’s inner ‘yes’ -- euphoric and hopeful, a victory and a possibility.
"You literally asked a random stranger if they would mind you going to your knees for them," Claire sneered.
His phone is buzzing. The ground is stone cold. His heart is beating like mad. Tears run down his face, warm, salty. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters; everything’s a dream. Nothing is real except that Cas is dead. Dead, gone, dead again, dead forever.
And before he can stop himself, he is hugging Cas, hard enough to bruise him, probably, but Dean doesn’t care. Cas’s arms close around him and keep him grounded. His voice – “Dean” – is a low, gravelly rumble near Dean’s ear; it’s never sounded more beautiful. (And Dean hears the words again, “I love you,” and now that Cas is alive and breathing and warm in his arms, he can think they are beautiful, too.)
And if Balthazar had been there... well, it was a good thing Balthazar was not there, because Castiel was positive he would have asked the best man to pose for an art piece. Quite possibly naked. Oh, who was he kidding, Balthazar would have insisted on the nudity. Castiel couldn’t blame Bal, of course – this man
There was nothing but naked skin under Dean’s own, and that was Heaven -- Heaven. The only thing that could make it better--
“It is... good to hear,” Cas admitted. He couldn’t help but smile, and Dean’s face went soft and smiling when he saw that.
being bossed around. I hate being summoned, and I hate the little angel you love so much. I think I hate Winchesters, too. Billie told me she wanted me to have you once you die, but I think I’ll pass on that. So, did you really think I’d let you get your angel back so easily?”
“Right. Right. Good,” Dean said, looking flushed for a reason Cas couldn’t quite fathom. “Jack’s magic potion or blessed water or whatever worked – good, good. Sam will be very relieved. Jack, too. Everyone, in fact. Everyone is very happy that you’re back, Cas.”
“Of course I should have,” Dean insists, fighting with himself to keep his voice level. “Cas, you’re – you’re important. You – I’d never – I couldn’t  let you there. You know that, right?”
Castiel didn’t remember much after that. He fell in and out of consciousness, welcoming the absence of pain just as much as he welcomed the feeling of life.
Castiel smiled, hoping that Dean wouldn’t see how uneasy he felt at the idea of going to a fancy restaurant – he was too awkward, he didn’t know the codes.
He had liked it nevertheless. There was something about the simplicity and the easiness of it all that moved him more than big gestures ever could – something that made his heart beat faster than a grand gesture or a splendid confession. It was in the little moments – the way Dean spoke fondly of his father figure Bobby and of his job as a mechanic at Bobby’s, in the way Dean laughed and his eyes twinkled when he told Castiel of Garth’s adventures and of Sam’s mishaps when he decided to propose to Eileen. It was in the way Dean listened to him, too, in the way he didn’t seem to mind the oddness that drove others away. As if Castiel was a fascinating riddle, but without making Castiel uncomfortable or self-conscious.
And he had almost blown it because he didn’t understand metaphors – that was frustrating. He would have to give Gabriel an enormous basket of cookies to thank him properly. (Gabriel was
The Empty looks like she has swallowed acid. “Right,” she says after some time. “Fine. If I get the opportunity, I’ll take him. Perhaps the Nephilim bomb gave me that power. We’ll see. I agree to help you, fine. But why should I let the angel go?”
Jack smiled. “I told you, the answer is here.” He laid his hand on his heart, and Dean’s own heart leapt in answer as he thought about the words Cas had said.
The best man had the greenest eyes Castiel had ever seen, and his smile was even more beautiful up close. He had freckles, splattered on his skin like the stars an inspired god had painted across the night sky. He felt his cheeks reddening, and he couldn’t
that win. He’s already lost too much. Chuck has won, the Empty has won, Billie has won, and Dean is tired of losing everything he holds dear.
Castiel’s heart swelled with happiness as they smiled at each other, full of their love and their promise of forever; but his heart was also a tiny bit heavy as well. There was something about this love, this devotion, this absolute acceptance that never failed to move him. To make him feel... not jealous, it wasn’t that... but it made him ache with
But Castiel didn’t have the words to express what he felt, so he settled for, “It was lovely.” It was a lame word that didn’t quite encompass the whole evening, but if the way his family looked at him was to be trusted, they had caught his meaning.
Dean looked about to say something, but before he could let the words out he was interrupted by a loud scream. “Dean! C’mere!”
Jack smiled right back. “I have. I was just waiting for you to ask me.” His smile disappeared. “It would be extremely dangerous, though, Dean. You’re human, so I don’t believe the Empty could harm you, but after I exploded in it… I don’t know what they can do. And they won’t let Cas go without a fight. I can’t guarantee Cas will make it back.”
“No,” the Empty admits. “I don’t think you would.” She’s mocking him, he knows that, but he doesn’t even care.
,” Claire rectified, throwing a garland at her. It got stuck in Meg’s hair and Claire badly concealed a laugh.
Cas was never able to say no to Dean. Not when Dean needed him; not when Dean wanted him; and especially not now that he knew that Dean had come to the Empty for him, had fought for him.
“But it doesn’t mean the rest isn’t true,” Dean points out. “Chuck will destroy Cas forever. Do you think I’d want that?”
“He did,” Castiel mused. “He fell off his chair when he received the—Wait.” A thought was niggling at the back of his brain. “The wedding invitation disaster. If I remember correctly, the compromise was that the straight and tight-laced guests would receive the invite with the proper spelling, and the brides’ LGBTQ+ friends would receive the one with the typo... right?” Hope dripped off the last whispered word.
“How did you know?” Cas’s voice finally came, low and nervous and small. Dean had never heard Cas talk in so low a voice.
“He said I was his Huckleberry. And that you should ride a cowboy to save a horse, and that no rodeo could keep him off m—oh.” Gabriel was raising his eyebrows at him. “Oh. I – I think I see it.”
Yet Dean was blown away when he walked into the barn this time around. Their family had promised they would make the place beautiful (Rowena especially had been thrilled by the challenge), but he hadn’t expected
No, Cas didn’t know, but he didn’t have the time to say so because Dean suddenly got closer to him, adding hurriedly: “We’ve got to remove your stitches!”
His heart was pounding in his chest. He was holding Cas so close that he could feel the tremors in Cas’s heartbeat too. Cas was everywhere. Dean’s ears were full of his gasps and moans and soft whispered ‘Deans’. He was overwhelmed with the smell of Cas: ozone like the impossibly powerful being he was, honey like the sweet, adorable angel he was, and something intoxicating that was just simply Cas. And Cas’s taste,
“Oh. Uh.” Dean felt very embarrassed and self-conscious this time. It was all so stupid. “I mean-- I didn’t know. I thought you weren’t in love with me, actually. That’s why I was asking, actually. To prove to Charlie-- well, uh. Yeah.”
There had been a relief in knowing that he’d never see the repulsion and the rejection on Dean’s face. Now that he was confronted with it, though, Castiel found that he couldn’t bear it, even if he knew it to be inescapable. Perhaps – with any luck – they wouldn’t have to acknowledge that thing hanging between them now that made the atmosphere uncomfortable. So, Castiel decided that he would love to postpone the rejection for as long as he could, and he changed subjects once again.
“Tell our family about this wedding, of course,” Gabriel lied smoothly. “Rowena couldn’t be here – I think she opted out for spite-related reasons, actually – but I know she’s dying to see the results, and the others too.”
Castiel looked up at the church in front of them. The stained glass window stared back at him – a beautiful rosary that featured the archangel Michael fighting Satan. How fitting, then, that today they had witnessed a different  Michael commit to love rather than to fight. He should get a photo of the happy couple under that window again. All he could think of was his mother’s voice –
soul that was captured the first time he saw Dean through the lens of his camera. Dean wanted someone who saw his soul and loved every bit of it, instead of someone for whom his soul had been fashioned. But Dean had captured Castiel’s soul instead, and had ensnared it every time they talked.
thing he could say, of course, except that he was too busy trying to pray himself away from this situation that he didn’t think of it until the best man said, “And your name is...?”
Of course it was enough, he thinks. Their bond has always been stronger than anything else. It’s the only real and beautiful thing in Dean’s life, after – and perhaps in Cas’s life too.
Castiel felt Dean’s tongue caress his bottom lip, ever so gently – an invitation, a question – and he parted his lips with something close to breathless glee.
Billie said he never followed a rule in his life, but Dean follows Rowena’s notes more carefully than he’s ever done something.
“I’ve been getting better,” Cas said. Then he went serious again. “Jack will not be Chuck. He will be much better.”
The song that was playing was a catchy one; perhaps that was a good thing they didn’t go for a slow dance immediately.
He can hear Cas’s words – one of the first things Cas had uttered in front of him, back when Dean didn’t yet know how important, how essential Cas would be for him.
“Great.” Dean tapped his feet on the floor. “Waiting for Adam and Michael to stop talking to the priest, huh?”
“Not planning to,” Dean answered, stealing another open-mouthed, messy kiss before going back to worshipping Cas’s neck and drinking in Cas’s moans.
Castiel thought about it. “No. Actually, I think I like the real version better.” Because in the real version, Dean had looked for him, Dean had
But Cas looked at him very seriously then, and he was panting, and his eyes were dark, and he said “Yes, Dean. Yes,” in such a turned-on voice that Dean no longer felt stupid. He felt seen, and heard, and wanted for what he was, stupid and sugary and everything.
She said that innocently, as if that was a light-hearted and completely normal thing to say. (Which, of course, it was
“Ah, the beginnings of a true friendship. Enemies to friends, twenty thousand words, lots of angst but also fluff! That’s the real thing.”
It cannot be Dean. Dean would not – Dean has God to kill and humanity to free, why would he be here of all places?
And Cas smiles. It lights up the room, and just like that, and even though he just learnt how to breathe again, all the air in Dean’s lungs are stolen away.
that Dean had liked him and every single one of Dean’s attempts had been as useful as a lighthouse in the desert. (How much more obvious could he have been,
He took a deep breath. No. Jack had said he had everything he needed. Jack didn’t have a doubt that Dean would find Cas -- he wasn’t sure Cas would be able to come back, but he was sure Dean would find Cas. That meant Dean could.
Would he even know it if he was looking at Dean? Dean had told him he’d be there, but he hadn’t told him what he would dress up as. What if he was the Chewbacca Cas had just met? Or perhaps that Star Trek fellow he didn’t know the name of – the one with the pointy ears? He had only seen the fellow’s back, who could know for sure that it wasn’t Dean?
“No,” Dean says, thinking hard and fast. “And I can’t promise you you’ll get him, either. But he’s your only chance to go back to sleep.”
“There’s something else you need to know,” Dean added. He talked quickly, like someone who wasn’t used to long discussions of uncomfortable things. “My mark – it only appeared after that second time. After we met at Bess and Garth’s wedding.”
That meant Castiel was now not-busy for a few minutes. He could look to his right again, but he had already decided that was not-okay. He could pretend he was busy, looking through the photos he had taken. Just in case someone was still looking at him. Or if they had just noticed him. It was good to seem busy. He hid behind a nearby tree, hoping that no one would see him, especially random green-eyed men on his right. He feverishly fished out his phone with trembling hands. His family had created a group chat or something, and taught him to use it; on that day, he was thankful they had insisted.
Dean shook his head with disbelief, clasped his hand around his, and helped him up. “As if I’d abandon you. C’mere. We have to hurry. I think the gooey bitch won’t let you go without a fight. You ready to run?”
When he was a child, his mother had told him that God pulled the strings of everyone’s lives. If by some sort of twisted irony of fate she happened to be right, then God had decided that Castiel’s life was meant for comedy.
“If he breaks your heart I’ll destroy his life,” Meg declared. (Threats were Meg’s way of showing people she loved them.)
Garth and Bess were Pagan and had planned their ceremony accordingly, which Castiel knew had delighted Rowena. He usually loved Pagan weddings, but this time his mind wasn’t in it, no matter how beautiful the ceremony was. He snapped photographs mechanically as the procession of friends and family came in, cursing his eyes for being drawn to Dean like magnets – he looked stunning in his tux, and the happy smile gracing his features somehow made his beauty as blinding as the sun.
Cas’ lips were chapped but soft and pliant under his. For one moment, Cas seemed too stunned to react, but then Dean felt his hands grasp his neck and pull him closer and Cas was kissing him back, sucking on his lower lip like there was no tomorrow. It sent little electric shocks through Dean’s spine.
confused, but also because, tragic and beautiful as this moment was, it was Dean’s and Cas’s alone, and Dean will want to keep it hidden, not because he’ll be ashamed, but because he’ll treasure it.)
The clothes Dean gave him smelled exactly like Dean. Cas could smell that, even if his senses were dulled. Even if his grace had been low as of late, he had still been able to catch all the complexities in Dean’s smell – the musk, the leather of the Impala, the slight scents of  gunpowder, whiskey and burgers. The smell was still undeniably Dean’s, though. (Cas couldn’t help but wonder if he would be able to smell the exact aroma of Dean one day. Probably not, unless Dean, by some miracle, agreed to let Cas smell the crook of his neck and other areas Dean probably wouldn’t let him go near in a million years.) Cas was surprised that they didn’t smell like laundry and detergent. Had Dean given him the clothes he slept in?
The person moves, suddenly. Dean feels oh-so-soft fingers on his face, brushing on his jaw, on his cheek, on his nose, on his brow.
Cas needed to wake up, and quickly. The Empty was probably busy elsewhere but it wouldn’t last. Good things rarely do.
He slowed down his pace as soon as he was out of Charlie’s earshot, though. Surely he couldn’t ask Cas
Dean unhurriedly pushed him down the bed, smiling to him. His gaze was strange, as if Dean were seeing him for the first time, or as if he were seeing him for who he really was. It was unsettling.
No way. There was no way Dean would let Cas believe he wasn’t loved just as much as he loved Dean. No way he was letting Cas hate himself.
, one moment of happiness and boom, he’s gone –” Dean feels his cheeks burn and he stops, cursing himself. Does Cas know that Angel’s happiness was, basically, making love with the woman he loved? How much does Cas know about pop culture, again?
When this is over, when Cas is back, Dean will do something nice for Rowena. He doesn’t know what yet, but he will.
And, well. Just thinking of it all made Dean blush. But if Cas could abandon all restreint in Dean’s arms, so could Dean.
This wedding was special. More so than any other wedding Castiel had ever intended – and that included the very first wedding he had been hired for.
Silence still stretched out for what seemed like centuries, and Dean wondered if Cas even heard him.
“Hello, Dean. I didn’t hear you there,” Castiel saluted back. Dean’s footsteps had been silent in the snow.
Dean can’t seem able to stop touching Cas. Another hand comes up, caresses Cas’s face, soft as a lover’s, so soft and loving that Cas could cry, because how many times has he dreamt of something similar? His lips, his jaw, his cheek, his nose, his eyes, his hair, everything Dean touches comes back to life. Cas feels alive, electrified, and loved. This is terrifying, and sublime, and too good to be true. He cannot let himself dream; but he lets himself savour it, because how could he not?
Castiel’s toes curled in his shoes at the same time as he curled his fingers in Dean’s hair and brought Dean even closer. Castiel’s heart was pounding, and Dean could probably hear it – they were so close. The feeling of Dean’s body against his own sent electricity sparkling in his spine. He felt warm. He felt fucking
Cas opened his eyes, briefly. Above him, the starry sky was stunning, reminding Castiel of the beauty of the universe, of its cosmic and magnificent infinity.
going to let him forget. He would probably stake a claim on Castiel’s first born or something like that.)
Castiel closed his eyes, mortified, and wished the ground could swallow him whole. How could he forget to introduce himself?
The burning felt like a longing, sometimes. Often, Castiel couldn’t even say if it was his or his soulmate’s. It left a bitter taste on his tongue – the fact that they felt the same, the fact that his soulmate felt that way, the fact that he couldn’t tell where it ended for him and where it began for this intimate, unknown other.
in him... “We couldn’t have done any of it without you. I couldn’t have – we couldn’t have defeated Chuck if you hadn’t –” He stopped once again.
“Nah, I saw the way he looked at you. And the way he texted you. Telling you all that stuff about him and his family? Trusting you with feelings when he’s bad at them because he’s a repressed Daddy’s boy? Texting you about random stuff because he thought that’d make you smile? Cassie, he’s
, though,” Dean added. His voice was barely more than a whisper, and it was a little hoarse, but he was gazing at Cas in spite of the blush spreading across his cheeks, as if he had decided to be more forward but didn’t quite know how to do it and was a little afraid...
Castiel still had a very vivid memory of when his soulmark had appeared. They appeared randomly – Meg still didn’t have hers, while Kaia’s had appeared when she was two, for instance. It came like thunder, without a reason and without a warning save for a burning sensation where the mark showed up.
The Book of the Damned sends ripples of darkness and disgust throughout him when he touches it. Thankfully, Sam kept Rowena’s notes near it, and Dean just has to read them.
He had always known Dean’s hands were meant for love, no matter what Dean said about the blood that covered them and the knives they were used to hold. And this touch was only a best friend’s touch, a brother-in-arms’s touch. The fortunate woman who would one day ensnare his heart and mind – as he had ensnared Castiel’s everything – would have the privilege to taste a different kind of love, and Castiel’s head spinned a little at that thought. How better than
“Your family is weird,” Dean mused. “I think I like them, though.” He didn’t seem bothered in the slightest by Gabriel’s antics or by his innuendos.
Then, because Dean was too tired to think or do anything, he slumped down next to Cas, burying his head in the crook of Cas’s neck. Cas wrapped his arms against him automatically. Damn, he was a cuddler. He was perfect in every way, wasn’t he?
He was desperate to convince Cas, but even if Cas didn’t believe him, the most important thing was that Dean could follow the voice.
Every guest had been told to come in disguise. So far, Castiel had met Dumbledore and Voldemort (who were apparently a couple now), Darth Vader, Princess Leia, Arwen, Indiana Jones, one monster of Frankenstein, two Draculas, an angel, the Terminator, Jon Snow, John McClane, Sherlock Holmes and six people who had come in a regular suit and had gratefully taken the fake FBI badges handed at the entrance to pretend that they
“Cas—Cas, I...” Dean’s voice was breathless. His eyes were darting everywhere, but they always refocused on Cas. “Cas...” This sigh... this sigh sounded like hope, and longing, and amazement...
He lost all focus when he felt Cas’s warm fingers around his own cock, stroking him and fondling him, and,
“Why not?” she answered nonchalantly, looking straight at the TV as if she couldn’t care less what Dean did. “Ask him. What do you have to lose? You’re convinced he isn’t in love with you, right? Then you’ll know for sure and you’ll get rid of any doubt the Big Bad Charlie put into your mind.” She looked up at him. “Unless you’re afraid he’ll say no and you’ll lose all hope.”
"Love you," Dean said sleepily. Cas felt glee at the idea that Dean felt safe enough with him to fall asleep in his arms, in complete abandon.
So he said, “You want someone who will hold your soul in their hands and fall hopelessly in love with all of it, with all of you, and decide to tether their soul to you and to leave their own mark on you, over all the scars life already left on you. I understand that.”
(Dean couldn’t help but wonder if Cas often had dreams like those, since he had been pretty sure it was all a dream. But that was a question for later.)
Dean put water on every one of his injuries. After some time, he looked up to Cas – as if he had finally gathered the courage to meet his gaze – and smiled. “This water –” he shook the bottle he was pouring the water from, “it was blessed by Jack. That should heal any injury, even from a cosmic asshole like the Empty. You’ll be good as new soon, Cas.”
And yet, when Dean touched him like that – when his fingers were caressing his eyebrows oh-so-softly, when they accidentally brushed against his skin for longer than they should have, when Dean stroked his cheek to assess the damage the Empty had caused... When Dean’s fingers did all that and sent electricity and warmth in all of Castiel’s being, it felt as though Cas were being worshipped. Castiel felt like a stolen idol – revered, adored, and undeserving of it all, stolen from the barbarous world in which he belonged to be cleaned anew in the hands of a rapt adulator.
“Yes, actually,” Castiel agreed, surprised that a complete stranger could understand that. “And taking care of people when there’s nothing you can do to help them – seeing them die and suffer— it’s depressing. I didn’t have the money for it, either. I was working several jobs, hoping to find my path, but thinking I would never become
Perhaps everyone he knew was right and destiny wasn’t as huge a bitch as he had thought. Or perhaps he and Cas were right, and they had found each other in the chaos of life and torn the script into pieces. It didn’t matter. What mattered – what was real – was Cas and him.
Good thing, that Sam, Eileen, Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and Charlie, and pretty much everyone he loved had taken one look at his sorry face when Cas had disappeared, insisted that he talk to Cas and ask him what was wrong... Who knew where they’d be if they hadn’t?
Dean didn’t seem able to tear his eyes away from Cas’s face, as if he were rediscovering him entirely.
“What? No! Not at all!” Dean raised his hands in front of him and shook his head with vehemence. “No, you don’t get it. It’s just that my dad was – well, he had very strong ideas, you see?” He chuckled – but there was no humour in it, and Castiel’s heart sank a little. “Sometimes I
Cas turned on his heels until he was facing Dean, and all of a sudden they were face to face, their chests almost touching but not quite, closer than they’d ever been unless one of them was dying.
He would have liked to say that he didn’t duck and try to hide behind a table, but that wouldn’t be true.
He was looking as gorgeous as always – his cheeks were slightly rosy with the cold and snowflakes were lying on his eyelashes and his thick dark blue coat, as if they had finally found a warm place to rest – Cas really understood that sentiment.
The angel was sitting at one of the tables of the library, engrossed in an old-looking book. Probably something about the latest cases that had been popping up in the country. Dean said witches, Sam thought demigods, Cas said angels, and Charlie thought fairies. Of course Cas would spend the day trying to find out more, because that was who Cas was for you. Always trying to help humans as much as he could.
Was it how it ended? Like it had started? In a barn, after one of them had pulled the other from perdition and rebuild him whole? Because that was what Dean’s touch on his face was doing to him: rebuilding him, reviving him, resurrecting him. He was hurt and dead, but alive under Dean’s careful touch – oh, so alive.
deal? How do you know he didn’t do all that in purpose? So that you’d make a deal with Cas and he’d be eternally unhappy? Doesn’t that sound like something Chuck would want?”
Castiel blushed. It wasn’t exactly what his family had advised him to do in order to flirt with Dean. But this horrible man had been there – one of Michael’s colleagues, probably –, ranting aloud about how people were only supposed to marry their soulmates and that Adam and Michael’s wedding was unnatural, and – well, Castiel had snapped. And when he had turned on his heels, all he had seen was Dean, his mouth open wide in either horror or awe. Castiel still didn’t know what to make of it.
Cas. No one else would do such a thing, and with such tenderness, too. The hand is masculine; soft, but strong. Dean has always loved Cas’s hands; the hands that have healed him, and restored him to life, and given him hope; big, strong, soft-looking hands he has dreamed of feeling everywhere on his skin.
Maybe he could focus on that, focus on Cas and on his love for Cas only, and let it guide him. Saying it could help too, perhaps. “Cas. Me too.”
He had spent years struggling between thinking that destiny was something you couldn’t change and wanting to fight it; between thinking destiny had good plans for him, and thinking that it revelled in making people miserable. Years spent thinking that the mark on his skin was a cosmic mistake, or a cosmic joke, or that it was hope that something big and beautiful awaited him.
flirting with me,” he added, turning to Rowena. “He spent the whole evening flirting with every woman at the reception, including the married ones.”
He was looking at Cas in such a peculiar way... Cas couldn’t decipher the emotions in Dean’s eyes. It wasn’t something he had seen before – as if Dean was looking at him anew, as if he saw something different there.
“And, anyway... ” Dean went on. “Sam and I, we were thinking... maybe we could retire. We’ve done enough, and we’d like to settle down, and... since our luck was all Chuck’s, we don’t want to risk it. There shouldn’t be any other Apocalypse, so we thought about that.” He laughed. “Bringing you back was our last mission, you could say.”
Rowena’s notes, the Book of the Damned. That should do it, Dean thinks. How hasn’t he thought of it sooner? Maybe he should call Rowena. He doesn’t know where his phone is, though. He dropped it at some point – it kept buzzing, and Dean can’t care about the rest of the world when Cas is no longer there. The world be damned, he thinks, and he knows he’ll regret thinking that, but right now, he can’t bring himself to care. Why would he care when Cas is dead?
Cas sighed. “Dean – I no longer have my ‘mojo,’ as you say. The Empty has ripped my grace from me right before we went through that portal. I am human, now.”
And Dean – Dean is broken, and he didn’t know there could be a good kind of broken. He feels like he’s been torn open and wrecked, and rebuilt. It feels so
Dean knows, right here and then, that he has to say it. For himself, and for Cas. Because they can have that, if only he stopped being so – himself.
Dean’s breath hitched. He looked at Cas, briefly, eyes wide and afraid and... hoping? “You mean as family, of course,” Dean whispered, his voice strangely hoarse.
“You will, Cas, you will.” Dean raised a hand and caressed Castiel’s cheek. His touch was soft, it yearned and it soothed in equal measure. “And yeah. I still want it.”
It was fitting, in a way. Back when photography had been invented, some people had thought that having their picture taken would capture their soul. There was some truth to it: as a photographer, Castiel always sought to capture the soul of an event, the atmosphere of the instant, the palpable but intangible love, and to make it live forever.
.” Each of Dean’s kisses was suddenly reciprocated with passion, and each of Dean’s sentences was punctuated with a sigh.
Castiel would have loved nothing more than to solve his gay UST with Dean, but he wasn’t even sure Dean felt the tension. He didn’t say a thing, opting to look at Dean closely instead. But Dean didn’t say anything either.
But it was too late, because Castiel’s world had crashed and burned. Because he had seen Dean’s reflection on the window.
“Well. That’s what we do.” Dean looked away. “Are you – are you okay? Can I leave you alone for one sec?”
Dean couldn’t seem to be able to look him the face. His eyes were darting in every direction, as they had in the Empty, except that this time he wasn’t looking for the enemy. His cheeks were a little red.
He felt giddy, and nervous, and excited. He met Dean’s gaze several times as he took photos of the various speeches and of the cutting of the cake and of the brides’ first dance together. Dean always seemed to be looking at him. Castiel also nearly dropped his camera into a bowl of punch, but thankfully Gabriel didn’t notice.
“Of course, I do,” Cas answered. His low voice always sent shivers down Dean’s spine, but these words... These words were special.
He was taken back to Jack’s birth, when he had found Cas’ dead body. He could remember every moment of it. It haunted his nightmares, after all. The limp body, the light gone, Cas gone…
is new), the feel of his stubble on Cas’s cheek, of his chest against his (Dean is breathing a lot too fast, until all of a sudden all tension leaves him, and it is as if Dean is
But they were in Super Hell for angels and demons, and Cas was there. He looked dead but he was only asleep.
This is Cas. Only Cas would know. No one else knows. Dean knows the feeling of Cas’s hand there. It can only be Cas.
Claire and Jack ran out of the kitchen, Jack still clenching his box of Crunch Cookie Crunch cereal and Claire with a pen still in her hand – she must have been doing her homework. Meg and Kaia came tumbling down the stairs.
Hope is a perfidious poison in Cas’s heart; but it must be a sweet kind of poison, because Cas feels
feelings, but about Cas’s as well. And if he thinks about it – he doesn’t want to, but his mind goes there without his permission – everybody knew, actually. Sam. Mom. Charlie. Bobby. Every angel and every demon they met.
If her eyes could kill, Dean would have died a thousand times already. But he does feel dead already; so he doesn’t feel the difference.
course it’s a trap. Why would the Empty agree to give Cas back? She hates Cas. She is a cosmic being; never trust any of them. It’s all a game to them. He thought he had convinced her but he hasn’t, or she wants to play solo, he doesn’t know. Perhaps she obeys Chuck. What does he know?
“So, you don’t think he likes you,” Gabriel said, sitting on a nearby table. “Let’s see. He’s a flirt, if I remember correctly?”
He put the head of Cas’s cock in his mouth. It was too soon to swallow it whole, he knew he’d gag, but for now, simply sucking away at the head seemed to be enough for Cas. There was plenty of pre-come already and Cas was making filthy noises and his cock was throbbing… Cas’s hands in his hair, trying to be soft and to caress but unable to contain his tremors and his
“I’m glad Charlie and Dorothy are married,” Dean said. “I told you Charlie was like a little sister to me, right?”
He licked at Cas’s head, playing with Cas’s balls all the while. Then he dropped a kiss, and thought maybe he could…
“I think so,” Castiel said, remembering how Dean had flirted with every woman he had crossed paths at the first wedding they had met.
Dean doesn’t know what to expect. He doesn’t care. He’s prepared for everything – fighting, negotiating, begging.
“Cas?” he calls, but he hears nothing. Not even his own voice. “Cas? CAS!” he screams, shouts, yells, but there is no sound.
– might even happen that very night if he was lucky. Castiel’s hands were clammy and he could barely focus.
At the time, he had cringed when Cas had said that, because – well, it sounded like a chick-flick thing, and Dean was still denying some things. But now, things are different.
It might also be another resident of the Empty. He knows Lucifer is awake, and Ruby too. They are the type to play a trick on him.
“Cas –” he starts. He hates how broken his voice sounds. He would like to say the three little words, but there is a dam in his chest that blocks everything that shouldn’t get out.
Castiel waited until he had chewed and swallowed his mouthful of cake to answer. “By necessity, mostly.” Dean looked at him in silence, obviously expecting more. “I opened up a photography business to earn a living. I was initially attracted to the artistic dimension of photography, but that doesn’t put food on the table. As a result, I opened up to a more materialistic practice of my art. Weddings, engagements, baby photos, family photos, photos for local businesses— everything that people want. Although I do find myself doing more weddings than most – Rowena likes to hire me.”
The hand lingers there for a moment. Then it is gone, and Dean feels cold – but there it is again, touching his left shoulder.
“I guess so, yes,” he said, whispering as well, although he didn’t know why. It felt sacrilegious to speak louder than that.
“He did.” Castiel couldn’t help a smile from blossoming on his lips. “He received the gay invitation.”
Cas came back to consciousness after what felt like a second and centuries, simultaneously. His body felt heavy and sluggish, and it took him an eternity (at the very least) to open his eyes. They immediately landed on Dean, who – as he discovered – was sitting on a chair just next to the bed.
“I know,” Cas said slowly – it still hurt, even after all that time being aware of this fact – “that my angelic powers were my only asset to our team—”
“I see them all the damn time,” Dean answered quickly, interrupting him. “Unless I’m bothering you. Do you... want me to go?”
This is more than he should be allowed to do, but Dean lets him nevertheless, and finally, Cas can know the feeling of Dean’s face under his hand, the hard and soft lines of it, the grain of his skin. He feels tears, and lines of worry, and a clenched jaw. Oh, to know that he has inflicted that on Dean! Guilt tastes like acid on Castiel’s tongue.
Cas’s eyes were no longer hazy or stunned; they were focused and determined. Cas briefly looked down at their joined hands, and then he looked up and smiled. “Yes, Dean.”
“Makes sense, I guess.” Dean licked his lips nervously. “I, uh, I get it. It’s kind of a big thing. Did it – turn you off or frighten you? Because I promise you, I care about
Castiel looks around, cautiously. He blinks once, twice, and as his eyes get used to seeing light he can see where they are: in the Bunker. He sees the books scattered on the floor, the remnants of what he assumes is the ritual that brought him back, and open boxes of artefacts. The room looks like it was ravaged by a hurricane. Castiel feels humbled again, and something appears to be stuck in his throat, and his eyes prickle. By simply looking at this room, he can feel Dean’s state of urgency and distress.
“They are,” Dean answered. “Dad would probably roll over in his grave if he saw one of his kids marrying a man, and not his soulmate at that, but hey—”
Castiel toyed with his fork. There was no way he could avoid answering a direct question. “By chance, actually. It was... an accident.”
He’ll never get Cas back. Despair sinks its claws in him. If he had waited a little, perhaps he’d have found another solution, a real one. But now, as it is, Cas will remain in the Empty, and Dean is just as prisoner as Cas is. The Empty, 1, Dean and Cas, 0.
