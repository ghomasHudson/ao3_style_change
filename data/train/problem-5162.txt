Before Steve can figure out what he's doing Mr Jarvis magics up breakfast and whisks it upstairs to tony, so Steve goes and hitches up the buggy and then ducks upstairs as well to wash and dress. He goes back downstairs to check Star one last time, and as he comes back inside Tony walks down the stairs into the kitchen. Steve's breath stops in his throat. He's in a rich black suit, and his hair is slicked back, and he's obviously put so much effort into his appearance, and it's because he's on his way to marry
It seems to take years, but at last Tony and Steve are both standing in Steve's room, on opposite sides of the bed, Tony clutching his pillow in front of him like a shield.
Steve blinks awake, warm and content and confused. He had a nightmare last night, the worst one he's had in ages - he shouldn't be waking up because he shouldn't have fallen asleep for at least another day or two. And when he does wake up, he certainly shouldn't feel so good.
"Everyone kept talking about which of them I would chose," Tony says softly, "but no one recognized that if all I could chose was one of them or the other, that was no choice at all. No one asked me what I actually wanted."
Tony doesn't say anything, just comes to stand beside him and brushes his shoulder with his fingertips.
"Tony," Steve says. While Tony spoke Steve moved around the table, and now he puts his hand on Tony's shoulder. It's the first time he's ever touched Tony without reaching out to him and then letting Tony complete the motion. Tony's shirt is soft and the fabric is fine; Steve can feel his warmth right through his clothes, and he can feel how he's trembling. Tony looks up at him with wide, wide eyes.
"I can get the straw tick for you," Steve begins when Tony reappears, carrying a few more blankets and a pillow, but Tony shakes his head.
Thought it physically pains him to move away Steve falls over onto his back and pulls his drawers off. Tony's moving behind him, presumably also taking off his clothes, and Steve gets tangled and has to wrestle his goddamn drawers and the covers at the same time. Tony laughs behind him - giggles, even - and Steve looks at him upside-down and unable to stop smiling.
Thank you. I'm not sure how to say that to you aloud, but I need you to hear me: thank you. Thank you for everything, and thank you for this morning. I have no doubt that you'll tell me it was nothing, that it was only what you wanted, that it wasn't a big deal, so I'm going to head all that off at the pass: it absolutely was a big deal, and it means the world to me.
So they get back, and eat dinner, and retire to the pair of armchairs by the fire ostensibly to read, and as the day drags on and the shadows lengthen Tony gets – well he can't get more quiet, since it's not like he can speak less than not at all, but – it's like everything
"You wouldn't have heard anything, you're a hermit," Clint says, and Bruce rolls his eyes. "We should go to Sif's and see if he's still here. I haven't seen him at all today and the train hasn't come yet, but the train's not the only way to leave town."
all right. He quashes the thought that even if he writes them now it'll still take weeks if not months for them to actually receive the information. There's no use thinking about things he can't change.
"It's fine, Steve," Tony says, rubbing a hand over his face, and he sounds so weary. "It really is nothing. I'm just being ridiculous."
make a bit of a show of his biceps. Then he says to Mr Jarvis, "It's not so bad. And we're not going very far. If you'll both follow me, please."
Later that day Steve finds what he will come to think of as The Letter. He and Tony have dragged themselves from their bed at last, intent upon completing their chores and sating their ravenous hunger as quickly as possible. Tony's barely out of Steve's sight for a moment until all at once he's just not there anymore. Confused, Steve comes all the way into the kitchen and closes the door behind himself, looking around as though Tony will suddenly pop out from the writing desk or something.
Tony looked flabbergasted even though the glasses and Rhodey covered up a laugh. "Hey, Bruce, I thought you weren't that kind of doctor," Clint said and handed him a plate of eggs. "Go forth and feed the needy while you're at it, would you?"
Taking a drink of his tea, Bruce set the mug aside and did his best to ignore the unhappy growl at the back of his mind, "At least I know you can keep yourself alive—even if some of those jumps are farther than a human should fall."
"I think we're more likely to find what we need at a lumber yard than at an actual store," Bruce answered, setting the books down on the counter and paying for them, accepting the bag from the cashier.
“I told you. I came for drinks.  If I desired something more than that I would be out seeking it.  As it stands now, I seek color and sound.  This is enough.  What brings you here, while we’re on the subject?”  Loki asked, arching an eyebrow.
Fury snorted. "Look, Captain, you're supposed to be doing paperwork, because I don't think Banner is walking back in with me and I don't think I could get Stark to write down a damn thing."
Tony gave him a narrow eyed look from behind the glasses. "I don't sleep in and waste the day away if that's what you're usually implying."
"Seems kind of unreasonable to name it without knowing what it's like," Bruce said, watching the kitten where he was bumping against Tasha's chin.
Natasha arched an eyebrow sharply, her expression remaining otherwise unchanged, "That would be what he said."
After a second he glanced down at his chest and tapped the top of the arc reactor. “Glad you got us through another year,” he said and then looked around quickly to make sure no one had noticed.
"Tony," Steve murmured, pushing himself up a bit further. "Thor, can you give us a chance to get dressed?" He had pulled the sheet up with him, but Tony hadn’t even seemed to notice.
“You’re joking,” Tony remarked, glancing up. “What in the name of—of you I guess—are you doing here? And where is the logic in actually seeking me out to sit next to? Tasteful drinks though, you have some taste."
"It sparkles," Tony offered. "And it has sapphires. I couldn't tell you which matches it better though. They both look like they could."
"Be nicer if I could remember it. You blew him up," Bruce reminded.  "Let's make them both stick, next time."
"What did he miss in the last decades?" Thor asked, looking from Tony to Steve and seeing the unhappy set in both of their expressions. "It is unfair if they are hurting each other only by their own accidents."
Pepper looked at the plane before bursting out laughing, "Oh, but Rhodey it's a perfect model.  And look, it flies too."
"Yeah," Clint said. "I need some time to think, but I swear I won't go off on any vengeance kicks right now. Just thinking. And working through it. Probably by shooting a lot of targets. Knew I should have painted some of them gold and green.”
"Alright," he said, letting out a long breath. "Alright." He turned away from the window, offered her a tiny and hurt smile and moved back toward the kitchen. Natasha paused for a moment longer, watching the rain fall, before she turned and followed him back to the kitchen.
"Coming from me this is a laugh, but you could try making things easier on yourself in that area," Charles suggested.
"I believe it was that one should be careful not to fry the small minds of humans who live for such a short time," Thor said. "Loki agreed with the author. I recall not doing so."
Steve nipped lightly at Tony's lower lip before taking a solid step back, "You're right, best if no one walks in on us."
Charles rolled his eyes, "I think that level of consumer manipulation would be a step beyond what Steve would like."  He strolled over to the bar, leaning his cane against the side of it and offering Clint a nod before stepping behind it and considering the selection Tony had, "You're hiding the bourbon again."
"I'm not asking you to," Steve said.  "I'm asking for your side of this.  I haven't seen Clint that angry since we set up here."
"It seemed to hit everyone else, but no, not really any reason to think you particularly needed to."
Bruce’s brows arched again, “How many films have you actually seen in recent years, Tony?  I mean, you go to the premiers don’t you?”
"What just happened?" Tony asked, entering and looking over his shoulder. "I have never seen Barton that spooked and he came from here. Oh, and you're not big and green. So what did you do?"
"You mean the time you got completely crazy, killed one of my friends and tossed me out a window?" Tony asked, eyes going a shade colder. "Sure, why not."
"I don't know," Bruce answered honestly.  "I don't even know if I've loved her for a long while or if it was the idea of her, the idea of a possible normal life with someone who knew about me."
"If it's not the future, it's Stone Age," Tony said. "You're the one who likes the moldy old mansions."
Rhodey sighed, but he managed not to bury his face in his hands. "Tony isn't a generous person easily, so he tends to throw it around instead of being kind about it. Take the offer but that's one I might not read into. Not on its own. He's thinking he's being helpful."
"That is a tree because you got lots of garlands," Steve answered, setting the boxes he was carrying down.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Tony managed, strangled when Steve moved, watching the ways his muscles moved under his skin. Without realizing it he had drifted several steps closer.
"Aren't you at all curious though?" Clint asked, cocking his head to one side. "Eventually people are gonna be telling stories about them—one way or another you know it's gonna be true—and you really want to say you just ignored them and hoped they'd go away?"
"Recently, or does he just always surprise you?" Fury asked and his brows shot up as he turned around the tiny gun she had gifted him, the newest in concealed secret weapons and he carefully did not ask her how she got ahold of it before he did. Damn Stark and whatever connections he still had. "You're here on his orders anyway, aren't you?"
"Betty Ross, my girlfriend, she was in town and thought we should go out since we haven't, we haven't seen each other since Harlem," he answered, closing his eyes.
"Look, I—" Clint paused, realizing he had no idea what Bruce was talking about before continuing. "I realize that Stark needs to come with an instruction manual, and that you're worse off than the rest of us that have been seeing him in the media for the past thirty and some years but still, could you hit less of his triggers in a given conversation? You might as well be punching him." He said it casually, as if that would help at all.
"What has she gotten herself recently?"  Natasha removed a pair of sunglasses from the display, dark enough to conceal the eyes of the person wearing them, and with frames designed to block the sunlight from the peripherals as well—minimizing distraction.
Thor slammed the door open to Tony's room, having gone through the entire floor. "Anthony," he said, Tony startling awake from where he'd fallen back asleep curled around Steve. Steve came abruptly awake, half sitting up at Thor's voice.
"That....that would seem to undermine the purpose of a fondue set," Bruce mused, shaking his head.  "Has Tony had a solution for this yet?"
Jane glanced up at Thor, offering him a broad grin, pleased to be there, "Personally I prefer plain drip coffee or white chocolate mochas."  She paused before resting her hand on Thor's arm, Eric bringing up the rear.
She crossed to his desk and set a small package down on it, stepping back again, "Happy Holidays, Director."
“I’ve been reading the news,” Loki said when Thor had only gotten a few steps away. “New York has been unseasonably rain plagued. More than that, the meteorologists can’t figure it out. There’s no weather patterns to explain the thunderstorms.”
"Sure," Clint said, shrugging. "The pickings should be slim enough to make it either really exciting or hella depressing and I'm in the mood for either."
He groaned, letting his head thud back. "Look, I understand it's a classic and the first and has great stuff and really moving stuff... but if I have to watch that staircase scene again, I will cry."
"It's your kitten," Clint said after only a moment's hesitation. "You should bond and do all those things."
Jane looked him over before turning back to Darcy who was bent over rifling through a cupboard. "You know, Darcy, you haven't checked the kitchen for that alcohol yet."
Entering the room, kitten in his hands, Clint paused as he looked between the two men there. "Should I not interrupt?" he asked, not sure how to read their body language but certain something was off in the other man. He held himself wrong and it put Clint on edge.
Clint knocked his knee against Natasha's shoulder, still a careful truce between them. "Who needs health when you got this sort  of companionship, anyway?" he offered, his own cup of coffee in his hands.
"Screw photographs, I have videos," Tony said, taking another sip of the drink he held. "Which I'm assuming whoever Fandral is, doesn't."
"About a year later," Rhodey said. "That's a simpler story in that the arc reactor, the only thing keeping him alive, ending up poisoning his blood stream. Instead of being the height of maturity and telling anyone," Rhodey paused, mouth twisting. "He started doing his damndest to make us hate him while giving away all his possessions. I got a suit, the Mark II I think, and Pepper became CEO of the company. He didn't want us to mourn, so he did it in the most annoying way possible of course. Story short, he found a new element after from prodding from Nick Fury and is still alive to cause us all ulcers."
Tony’s groan was high pitched and he shuffled forward on the counter until he could drag their hips together. “This towel is a tragedy.”
Tony shifted like he was deciding what to do before he lifted his legs up to wrap around Steve's waist. "Yes and no. My parents didn't. Obadiah didn't. Yinsen didn't and he had a plan."
"Alright," Steve murmured, trailing his fingers down Tony's spine as he turned his attention to the side of the other man's neck.
"I would say that, yes, Steve likes food," Natasha said, having watched Tony consider and discard many things already and knowing they'd been through pretty much every other department.
"He's not a guest, he's a pest and a menace," Tony said, though he grinned over at Steve from the workbench, Clint looking even more confused from the couch where he was eating with the cat in his lap.
"Alcohol and I don't mix," Bruce answered, considering his host and the other man in the room as well.  "I was really just coming up to check with you about some results and a potential lab issue."
"Still it," Clint said, touching Bruce's hand before he thought about it, a motion he just did automatically before snatching it back. "That's good right?"
"Of course," Tony said. "I mean, even you remember he was an artist right? Remember when I found that out and demanded art lessons when I was a kid? And failed at them miserably which is why no evidence of that exists anymore."
"Exactly," Thor said, petting the kitten under the chin before carefully setting him down next to the food dish.
“Ah, honeybear,” Tony said. “Didn’t the suit replace the plane? Like, logistically one has been a much bigger help than the other.”
"Hence the hope of finding something," Bruce said as he wove his way through the store, trying to find anything for Tony.  He paused in front of a display of alarm clocks, picking up one of the unboxed ones to examine the casing for a moment.
That earned a huff of laughter before Steve's expression turned serious again, "Is there anything else you think I should know?"
“Are you sure that’s a thing that’s actually happening?” Tony asked. “Because I feel like there could be a lot of reasons for that to be a thing that doesn’t actually happen.”
Steve mumbled something and they stayed like that for a while, Tony with his hand in his hair and Steve with his arms around Tony’s waist as the rain and thunder thudded outside the window.
"You have an entire team full of people who'll catch you," Bruce said, watching Clint and not sure what to do with how quiet the rumblings in the back of his mind had gotten.
"...You let him use your shower. After Christmas?" Charles shook his head, "One of these days you're actually going to figure out how people think. You'll find it dull, but it will do you good."
"That's fascinating, because the card that accompanied the gift wished me a Merry Christmas and has your signature on it." Charles drawled, before covering the phone to call into the kitchen, "That's not an appropriate response to the coffee-pot, separate them, now."
Bruce nodded slightly, "Both fair assessments.  I know Clint likes films, but I know hardly enough about them to scratch the surface and not enough to buy him any."  He paused at a window display and smiled, "You know, I think I might have found Clint's gift."
Thor frowned, seeing a biography of Howard Stark on the shelf opposite the histories. "Then where else would you like to go?" he asked.
Natasha spent more of her time watching her teammates than the screen. Every once and a while she would catch Bruce shaking his head at certain scenes even as his lips tilted upward at C-3PO and his conflicts with Artoo.  Glancing away from him, her eyes landed on Steve who was entranced by the effects used on screen as much as by the story. Last, but certainly not least, she focused on Clint, glancing at him more frequently than any of the others to keep a quiet eye on him.
The shower was running and the steam had clouded up much of room. But Tony could still see Steve startle and his eyes snap open as he reached quickly for the shower control and his towel, missing one and barely grabbing the other.
“Yes, well, I didn’t expect much more in the long run,” Loki said, looking away and Thor had still never bothered to turn the lights on. His brother’s face was sharp in the dim lights that seeped in the windows from the outside. The lights of a living, breathing city, full of people celebrating their holiday and Thor took a deep breath.
Pepper leaned down to kiss Tony, having been watching him during the exchange. "Well, I'll leave you all to it. I have a meeting and then a statement to give. I'll be there at Central Park in time for what's going on there, alright?"
"By omission," Tony said. "That's still a damned lie."  But before Steve could say anything else, Tony shrugged as the elevator doors opened. He stepped through, spreading his arms and half turning back to Steve. "And this is yours."
“None of these idiots have seen Star Wars!” he complained, the most he’d said to her in several weeks. Once Clint had met Natasha, he soon enough sat her down and made her partake in a Star Wars night with him and Phil, though in revenge she’d forced him to watch several Soviet silent films.
"No, it's for the best," Bruce replied, shaking his head.  "I wouldn't be able to handle it if something happened to her because of the Other Guy.  She doesn't get that I don't have any control when he's loose."
Natasha ignored the question, finding four different sorts of socks, wool for Steve, black light-weight dress for Tony, comfortable socks with a tension ribbing around the arch to lend support for Bruce, and dark red socks with a small star pattern for Thor.  She approached the jewelry counter, leaning against it and watching Tony.
"Not that I ever say no to benefits," he said, grinning at her. "I just don't want you feeling tied down to someplace that's not... all it could be. I mean, not that you can leave me. Because I'd seriously last only a week without you and you're the most important person in my life and probably my favorite too, sorry Happy," he added and the driver snorted.
Steve gestured to the pile of decorations, "We've still got a lot of these to put up and around the room.  Bruce, Clint, you got the lights handled?"
Steve paused at that, reaching out to touch Tony's arm lightly, "If I let you retreat are you going to lock me out of the lab?"
Leaning forward he slid a hand around the back of her neck and kissed her temple. "Say hi to Fury for me next time you see him," he said and almost scampered off after where Bruce had gone.
Lowering himself back down, Steve considered Tony for a long moment, "You're never going to stop surprising me, are you?"
Tony blinked away his first reaction. "I'd say it's closer to seventy-three percent of the time you open your mouth."
Tony shrugged. "Not used to telling people about my safety. Besides, it just seemed easier as it was."
"I think it started to duel with Steve when he turned it on last night," Clint said with a tiny shrug. "With a fork."
"I didn't realize you would be so easy to find," Thor said, still dragging him. "I would have not looked as hard and probably found you sooner for it."
She arched an eyebrow at that, "It's probably good that there's an almost there." Laughing, he kissed her because there was an almost in front of most of their statements.
“You don’t recognize your own brother?” a voice asked from the darkness and Thor dropped Mjölnir, stalking toward where the voice was coming from. He caught the slender form standing in the shadows and slammed it against the nearest wall, ignoring for a second the small gasp that caused.
"Exactly," Clint said. "I—I was sleeping with my superior knowing we could die any day and I still wanted it all—the house, the white picket fence, the animal and the flower gardens. I wanted the happy, normal life while sleeping with—while loving someone who could have killed me the first time we met, who should have killed me and considering everything I expected to be shot first."
"How much did you know about Phil anyway?" Clint asked, collapsing on the couch, spreading his arms along the top of it and throwing his head back.
She offered him a last kiss on the cheek and handed him a slip of paper with her number and email on it as a reminder, "Let's try to keep in touch at least."
"I just miss him," Clint said again and pushed himself to his feet. "You know, you should talk to Nick. I think he misses... whatever weird thing you people ever did."
Steve knelt down, going through the suggested cupboard, "Aha, here we go.  I'll see about setting up a bed in my room, or something."
"How am I going to win this argument?" Steve asked, frowning down at Tony, hands braced next to his head.
"Which is, frankly, not my concern in the least.  I've no desire to return to a cell and that's where I would go should I be there."
"You just pissed off half the team," Steve almost yelped.  "Loki tried to take over the world the last time he was planet-side."
"Actually, no, I have a new idea," Clint said, clapping his hands. "There's a tree in the lobby, right? Well, no one's going to be at work tomorrow and they've already gone home tonight. We should kidnap it."
"Yeah," he said, clearing his throat. "So what sort of frame are you getting Tony? It's gotta be sleek, you know?"
"Yeah, you don't happen to have any blinding ideas about that, do you?" Clint asked, blowing on his hands.
"I got better," Tony said. "Discovered a new element, destroyed my entire lab and presto, new arc reactor." Rhodey just made a groaning sound. "And then I saved both your sorry asses, I might add, in the same day. And then blew up an entire expo."
"Yes?" he asked, still distracted before shaking his head and looking back at her. "Sorry, Jane, did you ask something?"
Charles waved a hand at that, affecting a falsely wounded tone. "Yes, yes, be on your way then. You've never listened to me in the past, why start now?"
Clint looked over the edge of the couch, frowning slightly. "You have a lot of grey areas," Tony said. "In fact, some less grey."
"I can't imagine her coming to NYC without the taser.  Especially after she tested it on the god of thunder himself."
Tony blinked, adjusting his sunglasses, glad suddenly he hadn't taken them off, even though it was fast heading for dark. "Why is there a kitten here?" he asked.
“Probably the, whatsit, rec room or whatever Tony calls that massive TV screen that’s allowed to have a room around it. Actually, he’s been stuck in his lab all afternoon and evening and I think Steve is going to start begging around it, so let’s fetch him for some enforced relaxation too,” Clint rattled off, heading toward the elevator to where Tony’s main lab was in the basement, below the bottom of the tower. Their private elevator reached the first floor, all their floors, and the basement, with no access to the floors in between and a special key card and code needed to get into it.
“Well now it’s cemented in my head so that’s what we have to work with,” Tony said, picking his way across the room, keeping the lights down low as the storm raged outside the tower. “Goddamnit Thor,” he muttered, finally pushing the bedroom door open. “Babe?”
“Tony, you know we’ve been dating for a year now,” Steve said and Tony couldn’t help the thrill in his stomach every time he thought about that. “You got into just as many fights as a kid as I did.”
"I'm saying that it is a rare thing indeed," Loki responded.  "There are gods who have taken mortal lovers, but you are such a frail race in comparison to those of other realms."
"And yet you're one of the only people I've ever met to describe him as such," Tony said. "But no, it's good that someone apparently liked him."
She pivoted to face him fully, a hand rising to the left side of his face, her thumb barely brushing his cheekbone under his eye patch, "I needed to be uncompromised when Clint needed me.  There's nothing else to work out."
Steve hesitated for another moment, but nodded, thanking him again and turning to head down the hall and see the rest of the floor.  He would get to sleep when he got there.
"So soon?  A pity, you're the most interesting company I've encountered here," Loki said, green eyes following Tony's movement.
Steve turned to face him, leaning against the counter, "I'll tell 'em to go to hell.  It won't work, but it'll make me feel better about them nosing in on our private lives.  But you're asking if I'll run, aren't you?  I'm not one to back down, no matter what gets thrown at me.  You're stuck with me, Tony."
That startled a laugh out of Bruce, "Like the fact that Iron Man programmed his fondue set to duel with all comers when given the opportunity to upgrade it from the basic one he'd originally gifted?"
"What brought you to New York?"  Bruce finally asked over dessert.  "I figured after the last time, well..."
Bruce smiled at that before pulling out the necessary ingredients for pancakes, "Well, I was going to make myself something, if you'd like some."
"Knowing what I do about him, which I'll admit isn't much?  It probably endeared you to him. I think that's how he interacts with just about everyone."
He didn't sigh but his shoulders sagged. "They are all—We are all adjusting," he tried finally. "It is perhaps not so unusual for me, if we had a holiday that directly corresponded to this one. But they fought last night and are fighting now while the others... don't fight as obviously."
“Star Wars,” Clint said, looking him over once. “To relax. Which you look like you need, unless this is one of those things that just can’t wait.”
“Don’t have to be quiet,” Stark murmurs in his ear.  “Nobody can hear you, and even if they can, hell, it’s my house - they can think whatever they want.  In fact, I’d
One of the funny things about not being able to get drunk, Steve reflects as the night goes on, is that it's almost like being camouflaged.  He can blend right into a crowd, down drink after drink, let people think he's just as zozzled as everybody else, while his eyes and ears stay sharp as ever.  It's not a cheap disguise, but he's pretty sure Odinson's not charging him full price, anyway.
Steve grabs his hat and hurries to follow them.  He glances at Miss Hill on his way out, and she stares back at him, wide-eyed.
“Say what?  Stuff you know already?  If I’m your subconscious, then nothing I’m saying can possibly surprise you,” Tony said.
He goes down the stairs and intends to just grab a hunk of bread to eat on the way when he spots an envelope on the table. His heart leaps in his chest, his mind immediately screaming LETTER FROM TONY! TODAY IS THE BEST DAY OF THIS WHOLE WEEK!!
Unable to keep his eyes away, Steve darts a glance at Tony. He catches Steve's eye and exaggeratedly rolls his own, then smiles brightly at him. Steve ducks his head and hopes his face isn't so red as it feels.
He sneaks a glance at Tony and sees him duck his head shyly, but there's still a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
looking at is not only beautiful, but is also very well-dressed. More than that, even if he were in rags and tatters it's easy to see just from the way he carries himself and the expression on his face as he looks around the station that he's incredibly wealthy.
Steve just sits there and blinks at it. He can't do anything else. It's just – kind of overwhelming.
Tony breaks away and Steve looks down at him, worried that he's frightened him, but Tony's smiling up at him like the sun rising and only goes far enough to see Steve without going cross-eyed.
). It occurs to Steve that it might have been a good idea to practice bringing up difficult topics when they weren't already in a tense situation.
"Tony? Can I - Can I -" Steve isn't even sure what the words are, but he makes a helpless gesture towards Tony, and Tony tugs his wrists until he's standing and then winds Steve's arms around himself, curling up against Steve's chest and tucking his face into Steve's neck.
They make their way towards the post office, where they left Star and the dogcart. Tony wasn't cowering before, but he is now. He his eyes dart around and don't settle on anything, and he won't stop touching Steve. Not with his hands, but he walks so close it's a miracle their feet don't get tangled.
"I'll make up the second guest room," Steve says. "You can go look at the rooms, Tony, and pick which one you'd like while I get your trunk. You can each have your own or share as you like."
downpour – Tony might be about. There'll be a fire lit for sure, and he keeps envisioning Tony curled up in one of the armchairs in front of it, warm and toasty-dry, with a book or maybe the one letter from Jarvis he likes to read and re-read. Maybe he'll even be extra sweet and have the kettle near the flames to keep it warm for Steve. There won't be any supper, of course, since neither of them know what time Steve will finally get home; Steve had made sure to warn Tony he'd likely be out quite late.
Darkness falls rapidly, the sun sinking beyond the mountains in a burst of glory outshone only by the stars that light the sky. Clint lights a dozen lanterns in the barn (all of them hung high to prevent anyone from bumping in to them) and a handful of people pull out instruments and settle against the back wall. A handful of people including - Tasha? Steve stands and stares for a moment, but it really is her. He had no idea she played fiddle.
Natasha withdrew from his space, watching as each of the Asgardians took hold of the Tesseract's container. With a turn on the end Thor held, the two of them vanished in a rush of blue light, leaving the remaining Avengers to go their own ways and sort out their footing in light of all that had happened. Natasha opened the back door of the sedan she'd arrived in, pulling out the single bag of belongings Bruce had left behind on the Helicarrier and handing it to him. The doctor took them with a softly murmured thanks before getting into Tony's convertible. Tony waved at all the others, having quickly mentioned to Natasha the offer to move in with them before shaking Steve's hand and hopping into his own car.
The doctor looked down at Tony, "You're almost under the table. I don't believe you." He picked up the bottle of alcohol and offered it to Clint, "You were...close with Agent Coulson then?"
The door pushed open again, Thor slumping in from where he'd been out in the city, still looking for his brother.
He started pacing again. "Bruce—once I could brush off but twice he said 'we' when talking to me. We will protect you, we noticed you get yourself into trouble and we'll get you out of it. I'm pretty sure the Hulk is his only other personality."
Pepper looked over at Tony, focusing on the fact that he was wearing sunglasses in his own home, and frowned but nodded once.  She turned her attention back toward Steve, "You seem to have missed a few crucial things over the last several decades. It doesn't take much to fix that."
Steve was carefully gong over the slim pickings that remained, considering the gaps in the branches and the size of each tree, "It's not the end of the world, that's what the garlands are for after all."
Tony waved a lazy hand. "Okay, so I went after them with missiles and a suit of armor. But hey. Don't follow my example."
"Something that doesn't cost money, probably," Clint said. "Or something so cheap it wouldn't even cross his mind. I don't know, you don't happen to have any paintings lying around or something?"
“I saw pictures,” Tony said. “You know, when I was older than three. Of you before.” He draped his arms over Steve’s shoulder, urging him down. “You were still gorgeous and determined then. Which is not to say this isn’t extremely hot,” he added, urging Steve to cover him. “But it’s not the only reason you’re gorgeous.”
"I'll work on that," Clint said and tilted his mouth up to kiss Bruce, slow but not gentle or timid.
“He seems a bit cheerier than he has been,” Tony said. They both continued to look at where he had disappeared into the kitchen for several moments.
“Trust is relative at this point, brother,” Thor said. “You have lost much of it. But there is always a chance to earn it back.”
"That's one I haven't heard before,” Steve said, arching a brow at Tony who shrugged. After another second Steve smiled, ducking his head slightly. “Thanks for the offer, though. It means a lot to be offered a place to stay.”
“Certainly sir,” Jarvis replied. “As I enjoy every other product of popular culture you ask me to read or watch so that you do not have to.”
Thor trailed after him, looking around the store with interest, still amazed at what humans decided to invent.
“It’s not,” she started but let him push them over to several couches and she plopped down with no grace. “I’m just feeling overwhelmed.”
Looking up when he entered, for a moment Clint didn't speak either. "You hungry?" he asked finally, holding a tie in his hands.
Bruce entered the restaurant, looking around and smiling when he saw Betty Ross.  He crossed over to the table where she was sitting and she rose to greet him, "Betty, it's good to see you."
That seemed to snap Tony somewhat out of his daze. “That’s not funny,” Tony snapped, taking a step back like he was about to leave but he stopped instead, jaw working until he finally said, “None of my AIs have ever fallen in love before.” He almost ran when he realized what he said and had to keep himself still instead of slamming his head into the tiled wall.
Bruce frowned in confusion before realization dawned, "You mean the Other Guy.  You know we're not the same, right?"
Charles looked toward him, smiling cordially, "I think the other part of that agreement entailed your AIs never coming anywhere near my mansion."
They entered the coffee shop and Jane’s eyes roved around. The space was small in light browns and other warm colors and it made Thor feel more at home than the harsh metallic lines of Stark Tower. "How did you find out you liked vanilla lattes of all things?"
“I’m sure you have volunteers,” Clint managed, heading toward the TV screen before saying anything else, Thor trailing after him, happy with the very idea of sitting and not moving for a long amount of time.
"There's a chaos god on the loose, a really ticked off archer and his supportive gamma Hulk, and you're sleeping with me," Tony said, arching a brow. "Now would be the time to be worried."
Sitting on the back of a chair, feet on the seat, and elbows on his knees, Clint smirked after him. "He didn't appreciate being woken up and told he had to open presents in his pajamas," he teased.
"You're not getting out of it later," Steve warned, but obligingly slid their mouths together so neither could say anything further. Tony hummed, tilting his entire body up to get closer.
Afterward, when he was coming down from stars behind his eyes and feeling worn out, Tony watched Steve clumsily return to the bathroom for a towel to clean them both up before collapsing on his stomach on the bed. “So no super villains interrupted.” He felt content and weary down to his fingers and toes.
"No, sir," Steve responded, his gaze going to where Clint had left, "I'm doing paperwork because I'm the only one, technically, you're still providing housing for and I need to earn my keep somehow.  You could get a decent report from either one of you agents, but you don't expect those reports to ever show up, do you?"
That earned a snort and a shake of Bruce's head, “It's possible that something could be reverse engineered to take into account the exact physical qualities and weaknesses of his biology."
"How do you mean?" he asked, and then shrugged, heading over to the jewelry counter, sure he could figure something out himself.
Anything Tony could think to say was too honest. “You—you weren’t supposed to be,” he said finally and shook his head because that was wrong but his hand finally moved out, hovering over Steve’s skin without quite touching.
"I didn't know he was dying!" Pepper protested at the same instant.  "No more than you did when he gave you the suit without giving it to you!"
“Well, there’s the Lord of the Rings if you really want to show him a newer level of tech,” Bruce suggested quietly.
That earned a long pause before Bruce's smile took on an amused slant, "That, actually that does help more than I expected."
Tony took it automatically now, happily munching on it. "Considering that a meeting between you didn't end with a fight and still messed him up that much? I don't know. Redemption sadly doesn't seem your style."
She shook her head, leaving a message for Clint, "We're going to be late, hopefully not more than an hour, but give us an extra two.  Have Thor call Jane so I know if I'm flying to New Mexico tonight, and if any of you know what you want for Christmas call me back."  She hung up and followed Tony, pausing by a display of fountains, "These are nice."
Steve shook his head again, "Okay, so for a genius you don't always think things through and having drinks with Loki is pretty high on the list of 'things no one in their right minds should do,’ but you did it. He also hasn't been tearing up the streets of New York in all the time he's been around, so there may be something there."
They sat like that for a while, quiet and together, testing out the waters of existing in the same space.
"If you made that decision by yourself I'm going to pitch you off this roof and figure out how to calm down the Other Guy later," Clint said, a dark edge in his expression.
Charles laughed, "We'll try to corral them into my study. I'm sure Erik will be glad to help." He hung up before Tony could respond to that.
Several days later, Clint lay sprawled out on the couch, flicking through channels on Tony's TV, still feeling numb and annoyed from the other day. He paused, blinking at the news bar scrolling at the bottom of the screen and sat up suddenly. "Holy shit!"
"Yeah, because I'll just make things possible," Tony replied and looked around. "So, are any of you going to actually move in or should I just give the remodel money to like, a fund for pandas or something?"
She gaped at them, over exaggerated and not admitting it had taken meeting Clint for her to do the same. “None of you have seen Star Wars? Steve has an excuse, but have the rest of you been living under rocks?” Her gaze moved to Clint almost warily, “So you’re showing the trilogy then?”
Rhodey paused when he entered the kitchen, Tony perched on the counter with the sunglasses from the night before already on his nose. "Holy shit, Tony, do you keep a pair in the kitchen now?" Rhodey asked and Tony laughed. "Alright, so I didn't expect this entire thing, but what was that?"
"When Clint would kill Loki before looking at him, Bruce shouldn't be around issues, Pepper's left and I'm hung over," Tony replied. "Please Steve? For the poor starving Asgardians?"
He offered a faint smile, “Yes, something I wanted to do alone. I, for now I think I’ve visited the graves that I needed to. Besides Howard's anyway, I couldn't get it in this trip.”
“For telling me of my brother,” he said. “I,” he stopped again, letting out a breath. “I do not mean to belittle any of his crimes. But I have missed him. It is a relief to know he has both been quiet as well as fine.”
"Well, then Sif is added to the mix, and she can outdrink them all," Thor shrugged, looking around. "What are you looking for here?"
"Not much to do about whether I should or shouldn't.  It's up now," Bruce said, his voice tense as he watched Clint.
“You think he would have been over that by now,” Bruce said. “Or at least a bit less,” and he gestured at the window.
Steve finally managed to get the water shut off and the towel tied around his waist, "It's your bathroom. I just, I thought you'd be out longer."
"Just don't fuck it up, okay?" Rhodey said. "I may want to strangle Tony but he's like my really annoying little brother—only I get to do that. I get really cranky when other people try."
"Well, not when I rip your pants off, no," Tony said, eyes trained on Steve's, having dropped the sunglasses to one side in the middle of the last kiss.
"But now I'm all curious," Tony said with another smirk. "About what the sexual preference of the gods might be."
Twirling the martini glass between his fingers, Loki leaned back in his chair.  He had changed his appearance in minor ways again: grey eyes rather than green, slight softening of his features, and changing his hair to a dark brown.  Looking his drinking companion over he took another sip from his glass, "So how long before your compatriots decide to tail you, do you think?"
For a beat there was silence. "It may be possible, sir," Jarvis said. "You should have brought food," and the door clicked open, startling Tony from where he was bent over schematics and a broken apart engine.
"Eh," Tony offered, shifting around so he could straddle Steve's waist, running his tongue over his spine.
"No," Clint replied, finally giving in and twisting gracefully out from under the touch and rising, stacking the boxes carefully on top of each other.
"No, you didn't. And it wasn't really my business," Bruce answered, hesitating before leaning against the arm of the couch.
Bruce turned to stare at Clint in confusion, “I’m with Tony. What? There’s context for those, right?”
"So what have you been entertaining yourself with?" Clint asked, not looking up but pulling the plate of food closer to him.
Loki offered a thin smile at that, “And you assume that I couldn’t take you out and vanish before Thor could so much as get your message?”
He laughed, shaking his head slightly. "God, Nat, you have never mastered the art of meaningless comfort, have you?"
Scowling, Tony crossed his arms and hunched down in the chair, muttering darkly about not having the time. Clint just grinned, watching as Hoth filled the large screen.
"I saw you on the news during the alien attack but I couldn't get away sooner," she answered, using the side of her fork to cut a bite of cake.
“Alright, so the battle to dates is a bit confusing but I think they’re related because you’re usually way better about spatial awareness and heights except for what today is,” and he pushed the strawberries closer to Steve. “Which is the day you lost Bucky Barnes and I think that’s why you froze up on that rooftop and that’s why strawberries were always part of my plan for today. But they became even more necessary so,” and he shoved the whole package of them a bit closer to Steve.
Except only a little while later Bruce turned the corner toward the kitchen, his latest test results in hand that he was skimming until he saw Clint. He glanced over the other man and the boxes beside him, and although he didn't conceal his presence he also didn't speak.
As the conversation had taken a darker turn than he had expected after opening presents, Thor boomed happily over the food, making sure everyone had a plate and food. Steve rose after a moment, setting his untouched breakfast aside, and missed the way Pepper tracked his movement as he slipped across the room to where Tony was. Tony shifted so that he could get out of Steve's way, assuming he was heading toward the kitchen.
"There are always going to be people making weapons, Tony," Steve replied, not justifying what Howard did, but also not fully giving ground.  "Just because Stark Industries stopped doing so doesn't mean the void stayed empty.  You should know that."
After a second the corners of Clint’s mouth quirked up and he reached one of his hands out, taking Bruce’s and twining their fingers together. “I do like you.”
"Something tells me everyone's counting the days ‘til that happens."  She considered for a moment, "I feel like, I feel like they're all aware of their weaknesses, but not so much their strengths.  If that makes any sense.  It's like, they're so aware of where they're weak that they're still wearing armor to protect that part without remembering where they're strong too."
Charles' lips quirked upward in a smile that didn't touch his blue eyes, "No one understands how you think, Tony. It comes with being a genius. They can't keep up with the logical leaps you make sometimes."
"Totally clear," Clint said, holding up his hands. "I apparently have you and Bruce and the Hulk on that."
Bruce sidled closer, ostensibly to grab another string of lights, but really to get a closer look the the boxes. "It would seem Thor's the only one of us who thought ahead."
Thor nodded, still smiling at her. "But the fact you are willing to watch such strange people," he said, twining their hands together and starting to walk again.
Tony grunted, finishing what was in his glass and then frowning at it. "Okay, if you're going after my health then I'm not inviting either of you to live with me."
“Now would be such a creepy time to say how long I thought about that,” Tony said, staring at the ceiling.
"No, no disasters."  He took a couple of steps further into the room, "Actually, I was kind of hoping to talk about Christmas?"
"And he hasn't done a repeat performance," Tony pointed out, flopping down to lie flat on his back while he held his hands up in front of him, making lazy circles and flicks as he talked.
Tony paused, pursing his lips as he considered. "The ball gag was pretty fucking hilarious actually."
"Unless of course, Stark wanted to try and protest," Clint said and Tony's hands went up instantly in defeat.
“Because I generally love interrupting super-secret spy things,” Tony said, putting the box on the table next to too many scrambled eggs. “Who on Earth has been cooking?”
Hackles going back down, Tony leaned against the wall, crossing his arms and watching as Thor bent his head to say something to Bruce, nodding seriously at whatever it was, Clint having joined Rhodey and Steve on the other side of the room, coffee in Rhodey’s hand as he used the other one to gesture as he spoke.
So they go and sit outside and Steve wouldn't be able to draw right now if his life depended on it - he'd either sit staring at the blank page and panicking, or he'd get feverish and frantic trying to capture every line and curve and angle of the one and only thing he'd want to draw. The only thing he's wanted to draw for months, now, and never had the chance.
Tony's standing there, looking like he's on the verge of shaking out of his own skin, hair wild and hands constantly moving, and he only glances at Steve's face for a moment. "Steve, yes, hi, hello."
nervous, Tony, gods. I was looking for you everywhere and I saw – I saw someone else. Tony. He was absolutely the most beautiful person I had ever, ever seen in all my life. But he was richly dressed, and so obviously wealthy, and I just, oh gods. I felt so
She lays her hand on his shoulder. "You know I love you. You're one of the best people I've ever met, and I want you to be happy. But you're not thinking about this from his point of view and you need to."
His lips are soft and warm, and Steve holds Tony's hand tighter and pulls him closer at the feel of it. For a moment neither of them move, and then tentatively, like they can't help it, they start exploring, lips sliding over lips and breathing each other's air. Tony's fingers slide from Steve's jaw to tangle in the short hair at the back of his head and Steve groans, startled.
him, for godsake - gave him nothing but pain. Tony's had so little happiness before, and it must've been so rare for him to feel
Somewhere in all the confusing if also desperately arousing imagining - along with the heightened awareness of Steve from how closely Tony's scrutinizing him, on the lookout for the least sign of a nightmare - Tony realizes he can't finish the fantasy. He can't imagine what it would look like to watch Steve come, since Tony's never seen it.
from it. From them, from everyone, from the city and the prying and the constraint and my – Well. I wanted out. So I started responding to advertisements."
"Steve," Tony whispers when the sobs have stopped and the dampness is nearly dry, taking Steve's hot face in his cool hands, "will you look at me, please?"
"All right," Steve says, trying to draw Tony out of his sad silence as they exit the post office, "we can go to the store, or the saloon, and we ought to call on Frigga while we're here. But we don't
Utterly delighted, Steve settles back and shifts a bit until they're a bit more comfortable. He's on his back and Tony's on his side beside him, one of his legs over one of Steve's, his head on Steve's shoulder and his hand on Steve's sternum, Steve's arm around him. He pulls Tony closer and puts his own hand over Tony's on his chest, and closes his eyes and just memorizes the feel of it.
Right. That's right. Tony's afraid of something. Afraid of Steve? Gods he hopes not, but it's beginning to look that way.
"Well, all right, so you made an excellent point," Tony says so quickly it's like he thinks he's got to say a hundred words in half as many seconds, "a truly excellent point that I don't know what
Steve says, "I am always going to do everything within my power to keep you safe and to help you feel safe."
They dance, and Steve loses track of time - loses track of everything that's not the reality of Tony in his arms, warm and solid pressed against him, lightning-quick and beautiful smiling up at him, the way Steve feels strangely shivery and shaky.
"Yes," Steve says. "Though, there is another train that passes each night, but that one doesn't stop in town."
Tony's moving quietly around the room, slowly undressing and getting ready for bed. Steve does the same, and either by habit or from nerves they both leave their shirts and under-drawers on, like always.
At last Tony interrupts Steve's stammering and says, "Will you show me the ash tree? The one with the face?"
A few months before Tony came west, Steve asked how Tony had found his advertisement, since he hadn't placed it in any paper east of the Mississippi. Tony said a friend had been traveling and brought the personal pages from a few papers back for him.
It's the work of but a moment to secure the Star, but even so by the time he does Tony's already out of the buggy. He's standing right beside it, ignoring Steve and Mr Jarvis both, with his hands clenched together in front of him and bouncing on the front of his feet. He looks like he's trying to take off running but some invisible force is holding the back of his pants. But... he's looking at the house? And... not quite smiling, perhaps, but
some tiny helpless thing to be spoiled and coddled. But you certainly wouldn't let a kitten make its own decisions about what to do with its life, would you, Steve? You wouldn't let a puppy play with fire or go out by itself at night, right? That'd be irresponsible. But it would be irresponsible of
Steve doesn't know what to say to that either, so he just smiles and shakes his head, pushing his fingers into Tony's hair and cupping the side of his head.
After a moment Steve says, "All right," and leads him over to the general store, since he's pretty sure that'll be the most distracting place.
Mr Rogers, I have received and read your missive and find it entirely satisfactory. I have absolutely no questions; any and all concerns that may heretofore have plagued me have been summarily dismissed. I find myself entirely cognizant of your character, your motives and ambitions, and I am content. Nothing about you remains an insoluble puzzle; nor, indeed, has anything about you ever been. Felicitations; now that we understand each other we need never interact with one another again. I'm staying in here and I'll see you in a few years. Maybe.
They're both drooping by the time they make it back to the house. Tony walks upstairs in front of Steve and goes into Steve's room, and Steve feels a fission of excitement run down his spine - they've been using going into Tony's room as a euphemism for something, so maybe going into Steve's room means that Tony wants to - but when the sparks make it to the base of Steve's spine they settle in his belly and turn to something warmer.
"Yeah?" Steve still has one arm wrapped secure around Tony, and without thinking about it uses the other hand to brush a wayward curl off Tony's forehead.
wrong with you. Nothing at all. You hear me? I love you. And I -" he bites off the rest of the sentence.
He goes outside and tends the stock without lighting a lamp or unbanking the fire or eating, then he comes back inside, washes up, and knocks on Tony's door again. "Tony? If, um, if you want to come into town with me, I'm, I'm leaving."
"Safe travels, Mister Jarvis," Steve says with a surprising amount of emotion, gripping his hand tight. Mr Jarvis grips his hand back and Steve's surprised all over again when he realizes how little Mr Jarvis wants to leave. "You know you can stay, right? Or come back any time, for however long you want. You don't have to write ahead or anything."
Tony comes around in front of him and sees Steve pawing ineffectually at the buttons to his shirt. His eyebrow and the corner of his mouth quirk charmingly, and he holds his hands up and catches Steve's eye. Steve lets his hands fall to his sides and Tony makes quick work of his shirt. Honestly Steve wishes it took him longer to unbutton it, untuck it from his pants and slide it from his shoulders. Steve feels cold but doesn't realize how frozen and prickly his skin is until he can barely feel the brush of Tony's fingers, needle-sharp points of heat that are gone before he can really feel them.
To Whom it May Concern: Here lies Anthony Edwin Rogers, lately of New York and currently of Big Eden, who on this day thought himself to death.
Tony is in person until he gets to watch him wind everyone around his little finger with just a few bashful smiles and clever words. Steve hasn't even spoken in the last half hour, too busy smiling besottedly at Tony and gleefully watching everyone else get pulled into Tony's orbit. He's been here barely two hours and already half the town's half in love with him.
I hope this letter finds you well. If there's anything in particular you'd like me to make or leave out for you to eat, please let me know. You can just leave me a note. I keep the stationary in the desk beneath the window, and I just bought some more today so there's plenty, so please help yourself. Use it for whatever you like.
Steve goes to bed that night still with not sight nor sound of Tony, but he expected nothing less. Tony's afraid of something, and it's finally occurring to Steve that Tony's been afraid of something this whole time. Steve doesn't know what it is, but he hopes that when enough time's gone past for Tony to see that he doesn't have to be afraid he'll tell Steve what's the matter.
The next day Steve's just finished replacing two boards on the barn that've begun to rot when he hears a soft noise behind him. It shouldn't startle him like a gunshot but it does, and suddenly taut as a bowstring he whirls around.
"These too?" Tony asks, looking at Steve but with his hands closer to Steve's pants. The first truly lucid thought Steve's had in probably hours enters his head, and it's something about the fact that he and Tony are living together, and are working towards a good marriage, and Steve trusts him, and his hands are shaking anyway, and there's something in there he can't quite catch about comfort and things that have nothing to do with sex. He sees some of this – at the very least, the thought that Tony's probably going to see all this at some point anyway – flit across Tony's face, so once again Steve lets his hands fall to his sides and nods.
at him, looking so surprised it's like he thinks Steve just told him he's secretly a centaur or something, and Steve wants to gather him up in his arms and also maybe shake him and ask him what the hell's going on.
"Could you give me a hand putting this away?" Steve says before they even come to a stop in front of the house. "The dogcart's light but it's awkward trying to get it into the barn by myself."
"I drowned," Steve tries to tell him. He feels like he's still drowning, hideous pressure in his chest and water on his face, and isn't sure if Tony can even understand what he's saying but also isn't coherent enough to care, "Bucky fell, he died right in front of me, and I loved him but he died and I lived and then I drowned and I died too and now I'm dreaming you and you're going to get taken away too and I'll still be dead -"
There's something resting atop Steve's arm that feels like a pillow. Tony's hand is resting on his head, and every now and again he'l. absently stroke his fingers through Steve's hair.
After a long time frantically trying to do anything Steve realizes that he's asleep. Or waking up. He's in his bed, Tony's beside him, but Steve can't open his eyes and can't move and can't make a sound. He's trapped. Trapped. Voiceless.
How to write them with Steve so close, though? On the one hand he'd prefer to never sit on anything that isn't Steve's lap ever again, but on the other hand he doesn't want Steve to read what he writes. Not that he'd write anything he wouldn't also tell Steve, but it's - not secret, but - private. It's private.
After a little while, though, despite their best efforts they're both nodding off. Steve laughs into Tony's mouth, shuffling them around so they can lie down next to each other comfortably, and laughs harder when Tony makes an affronted noise and glares at him sleepily. But as soon as Steve leans in to him again Tony rests a hand on the side of his face, drawing him forward for more kisses, both of them tangled together warm and content and kiss each other to sleep.
"It took me a long time to see it - well, a long time and a lot of time spent with Jarvis and Ana - but Obie didn't care about me, not really. Not about
Tony heaves himself up from his chair, and Steve's thankful for the darkness when Tony stretches with his arms above his head and Steve feels his face go hot.
"That's ridiculous –" Steve begins hotly, and Tony laughs. It's bright and warm and genuine, and Steve relaxes for the first time since they got to town that morning.
