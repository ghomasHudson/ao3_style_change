and return to the attacking zone. The two defensemen change out with the second D-pair and Dean drops onto the bench on Castiel’s right, panting and sweating and squirting a water bottle all over his face and neck.
Gabriel, for once, gets serious. “Worst comes to worst, he can stay with me for a few weeks in the interim.”
“Um. Yes, I am all those things,” he agrees. “Let me speak with Dean first. I’d like his input before deciding anything.”
“Yeah, I know…” Dean slides his palm down Cas’ wrist and makes the trenchcoat sleeve bunch up a little. He gets a weird idea. “Hey, sit up. Take off your coat.”
“Y’know what - no. Screw this. Come up with something better. Until then, this conversation’s over.”
“Dude, you’re depressing me over here.” Dean flops backwards onto his mattress. “And I mean it, Cas. I really am sorry.”
wings the puck up off the ice and Castiel is forced to glove it down; it lands awkwardly, necessitating him kicking it with the blade of his skate so that it can meet his stick where it’s supposed to be. He runs for the blue line of the attacking zone and barely makes it over with an Oilers D-man practically glued to his back, self-passing off the boards to avoid getting trapped and robbed before finally snapping it backwards diagonally to a waiting Crowley.
And you have no idea you made this attachment until it's way too late, and when they go you'd be less crippled if a bunch of your fingers got chopped off. It's not reserved for "romantic" attachments, either. It can be entirely platonic or familial, too, with the exact same impact. So I'm leaving it in, because I have these moments. And they never get any less hard or humiliating.
“Oh.” Cas isn’t sure what to make of this, but it fills him with the warm fuzzy feelings that he used to get from Dean’s hugs, which was probably intended. Looking in the bag again, he finds two more in different colors. “Thank you.”
Castiel almost groans. He should’ve expected that question, considering how common of a misconception it is among humans thanks to inaccurate renditions in visual artistic mediums.
“It feels plausible,” Dean argues. He starts ticking off on his fingers: “Angels can time travel, Cas is usually the worst fucking liar I’ve ever seen when he gets put on the spot like that, and he’s never looked sorry like that. Ever. Not
“Gabriel, please save your pettiness for someone other than a defenseless child,” Castiel snaps, not in the mood for these antics.
“Yes, I’m aware. My contract is only one year, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens. I don’t want to move Jack, it might be unfairly hard on him.”
Castiel absently smooths away an incipient nightmare from Dean’s subconscious, still not looking up from his book. “What do you want Gabriel.”
“Our penalty kill units seemed to be in good form on Tuesday,” Castiel points out. “I don’t believe we’re in serious danger.”
The fingertips come to his temple and he’s flash-flooded with Cas’ memories of the incident, complete with his own utter failure to rake leaves off the lawn with any kind of skill. He remembers that morning, actually, and he hates that
“Of course.” He’d like for Dean to trust him and extends an open hand. “I can heal you-” And Dean charges. Human children are very small and quick, though Castiel could stop this and simply chooses not to. A knife is produced from some hidden area and speared through the upper torso of his vessel. He can’t help being amused by this development. “I shouldn’t be surprised by this. You did the same thing when we met the first time.”
Tomorrow night they’re playing the Stars. Sunday they’re playing the Coyotes. Tuesday they’re playing the Avs, then they fly back home on Wednesday to have a game against the Sens the same fucking night. Dean hates back to back games normally but having one be in a completely different time zone than the other just makes things worse by about a thousand.
“I’m sure one of your older brothers would be able to explain it in a way that you’d understand. Not that it’ll matter in the end. I trust you at least understand what would happen if you were able to unravel time and reshape it to meet your own ends.”
“I find these consequences acceptable. Raphael will be destroyed and the Winchesters will survive. My goals will be met. The rest is a justifiable level of collateral damage. I fail to see the problem here.”
Incidentally, depression while recovering from injuries or medical procedures is a real thing and it's super annoying. Like even when it's something positive you just get
“Awesome.” Dean twitches the right one; he’s gotten a little better at controlling how they move. “How big are they when they’re healthy?”
thing, you know how awkward and panic-prone I am, it’s not like I can simply go out and find sex whenever I want as it stands.”
is apparently the barrier that kept Cas from asking for his help. Dean manages to pay attention to the whole thing but that one part sticks in his mind all the way through.
Dean climbs over the bench wall with Benny, Cole, and Crowley, and as they head for the faceoff dot right of the Habs goalie he wonders if this is a deliberate choice in favor of violence on his dad’s part. Between him, Cole and Crowley, they averaged forty five penalty minutes last season, and in Dean’s case specifically more than half of his 52 PIM (higher than any of his teammates) was just from throwing hands. Benny is the only exception: last season he had just twenty two penalty minutes, which is perfectly average.
“Sammy, do we really want some chick tryna give birth here in this place? There’s no doctors or medical shit, it’s just us three and none of us would know what we’re dealing with.”
“Are you seriously saying that making my day-to-day life as difficult as you can on purpose was actually you hitting on me?”
It doesn’t matter that much. Everything’s going gray anyway. He loses feeling in parts of his body, his lungs aren’t working anymore. He can go now.
“Yes, I would’ve called but I can never remember your cell phone number,” Cas explains. They go to sit in the section of the day room which has the television. “And it stands to reason Raphael would refuse to tell you where I am.”
“Well, Gabriel kept screwing with me all day so I didn’t get anything done,” Sam gripes. “We have no way to know when Lucifer will pop up again and we’re nowhere near ready for him when he does.”
This was actually not a great choice, apparently. Because Dean kinda assumed that angels thrown by a sigil just teleported someplace else normally like they would with their wings. Turns out - no. No, they don’t. It’s like Dean and Cas get fucking catapulted clear of the panic room and then rocket away at three hundred miles an hour. And even though Dean’s absolutely sure he keeps his grip on Cas the whole time, when he smashes into the ground and very literally breaks every bone in his body Cas somehow makes impact almost fifty feet from him.
He squirts orange Gatorade into his mouth, enough for about two and a half swallows. Watching the faceoff in the attacking zone, Castiel thinks that Victor should’ve passed to
“With difficulty. In a human it appears to be a normal pregnancy aside from the shortened duration, up until the point that labor begins. In an angel it’s much harder. Most Nephilim aren’t found until after the birth.”
The group is let out and Cas watches his friend throw away the drawing of the boot lace. He wonders if that’s what Dean writes about in the journal sometimes, broken laces and dead friends. But Cas knows better than to ask that question. So he just takes his own picture back to their room and then waits for lunch.
“I have orders. Those orders don’t come with explanations in the majority of cases. You’re physically well again. That should be sufficient.” Okay, that’s a lot more normal for Cas. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t piss him off.
“So shirts aside, I did actually come here on business,” Sam interrupts. “Now that Anna has agency, we’re gonna start looking at housing for you once you’re discharged.”
The doors to the unit open and three people arrive: two in the forest green polo shirts which means they’re “transport” employees, and the third in between them wearing a plastic wristband and hospital pajamas. Cas risks it to look at his face… and can breathe again. This is not a demon. Sometimes the patients are demons, but this one is a person.
The whiskey burns in his stomach and tears leak out of his eyes. Dean wants Cas back, he wants the dumb trench coat and the literal interpretation of
Castiel only remembers at the very last second that they’re teammates now and no, he should not be punching his liney in the face. He just barely manages to restrain himself from doing it anyway, because Crowley is simply that obnoxious to warrant being decked in the mouth.
Gabriel is first going to offer that Raphael concede, even though the reality is it’s most likely a pointless formality. But destroying an archangel will be a monumentally difficult task, so they should exhaust all other avenues of resolution first. Gabriel’s wings are fluffed near their bases, betraying his agitation. He’s only going along with this because he sees it’s absolutely necessary, unlike his brothers he does see the wisdom of their Father’s instructions - love and care for all of creation, including and especially humanity.
So Dean… wants to be better. He wants to do better at mourning this time, because Cas’ death was somehow not ugly, there were no pieces lying around or pools of blood. Because Cas apparently loved him that much to not leave behind even the tiniest possible mess. That means Dean stops himself from throwing things or breaking shit or screaming at the top of his lungs at Sammy. He tries to do better, just for Cas.
It comes into his head for a moment, how before lying on his back was simply discomforting for reasons he never put words to but now it’s nearly unbearable to the point of dosing himself with benadryl in order to fall asleep. Because it reminds him too much of being on the receiving end of Lucifer’s wrath, planted on the floor and facing upwards while being strangled or in debilitating pain - in either case, waiting to die.
“You may ‘suck’ at expressing it in a satisfactory and unambiguous way, but that doesn’t mean you’re incapable of feeling it. I know you’re not. Usually you seem to feel it very intensely. It’s painful for you.”
I was writing for a rarepair so I would average like five subscriptions per multi-chapter fic, this is a massive improvement :)
Cas still looks like he’s about to drop dead any second, but his face instantly brightens. Watching him pull the undershirt on and then button his own shirt back up over it does something to Dean. He fights with his tie and obviously has no fucking idea how to actually tie it now that it’s undone so Dean takes pity and helps him do it, even putting it crooked and backwards like it always is because if it was done right Cas just wouldn’t look like himself.
Okay, yeah, Cas kinda has a point. Dean rolls his eyes and doesn’t argue, largely because he’s still pretty tired and his side hurts and his wings ache and the sooner he gets this over with the sooner Cas will quit nagging him and he can go take a shower.
Gabriel retracts his senses back to his immediate surroundings and sucks on a Tootsie pop while walking to the kitchen. There’s communal food for the refugees and then a stash of other stuff for the Winchesters - Gabriel inspects it and then empties the insides of all Sam’s vegetables in order to fill them with ketchup and pork gravy. Of course, upon discovery he has every intention of fixing the vegetables, because it’s not like he actually wants the guy to starve or whatever.
He panics, and as he panics he flails. His shin catches the back of Lucifer’s knee and they tangle up. But the hand is off his throat. Cas sucks the biggest breath he can and thrashes, trying to escape. Somehow his foot finds his brother’s face and they sprawl away from each other. It’s not enough.
Castiel tunes out his head coach and brings his attention back to his skates, tucking the laces under his shin guards and tugging down the ends of his leg socks before taping them in place. He’s much more interested in his equipment than the needlessly irritating and overly critical speeches from John Winchester. At least for this game he has the correct gloves and helmet, unlike their season opener.
None of them are really talking to him after the stunt he tried to pull. Bobby nods and takes the box as Sam works on cracking the second Tablet out of its stone covering. Dean stands rigid in the corner, drinking a beer and glaring.
Gabriel and Raphael have a long conversation about how to best achieve cooperation between the warring factions of angels. Castiel pays attention to very little of it, it’s not pertinent information and his job here is done. Even with the Tablet now removed from him, he can feel his grace slowly weakening, indicating that he’ll begin to disintegrate soon as time removes him from the picture. He still can’t speak so he slaps his palm on the table several times until Raphael finally opens the throat of his vessel again.
An aggressive stroll through the darkened halls of the bunker may be just what he needs at the moment, either to distract himself from Gabriel’s antics or to provide a type of mobile fodder that stimulates his brain activity (or both, ideally). Two minutes and twenty seven seconds into his walk, he’s distracted by the television in The Dean Cave, which shouldn’t be on at this hour. Jack has clearly fallen asleep in front of it again.
For the first time since the apocalypse when he’d embarked on his search for God, Castiel finds himself praying. Not in Enochian or Latin, especially not in English, but in impressions. Angels are technically a telepathic species and it’s not unreasonable to think that perhaps this will be clearer to God than any words can be about his feelings and intentions. It’s why there aren’t descriptors for emotions in Enochian. Angels can simply pass along how they feel to each other if they choose, assuming said feelings are within the range of approved non-logical responses to stimuli.
It’s almost exactly halfway through the game with 10:18 left on the clock in the 2nd. The puck is dropped, Crowley wins the faceoff, and as Castiel is attempting to catch the incoming pass from his liney a moose-sized Ottawa defenseman rams into him. The back of his helmet cracks against the glass and he crumples into a pile, dropping his stick to curl his arms protectively around his head. He doesn’t hear the whistle go but he’s sure it does because then there’s a hand on him.
“I don’t understand how we’re comparable, Dean. You’re a very beautiful man and deserve to get so much attention.”
Cas expertly begins preening the other wing, working a lot faster and easier than Dean did on the first one. Singed down and char-broiled feathers drift lazily away to the bedroom floor like a black snowfall.
Cas frowns. “Incidentally, I told both of them several times not to. But it was essentially Gabriel who was responsible. Dean only sat back and laughed while watching him do it.”
“Hey, me and Sammy are tryna help you, right? There’s no reason for you to rot in this hellhole forever.”
At the time, it seemed like a great decision, because he hooked up with another twenty-year-old who was really cute and at a kinda-nearby apartment. Then the next day when the All-Star Weekend started he discovered that, actually, this really cute twenty-year-old was a second round draft pick for the Oilers who was hanging out there to support his teammates. Oops.
Then a smite-blast flashes from somewhere. A hand wraps around his arm. Gabriel gets them out of Hell, and then they’re both useless, lying sprawled next to each other on a grassy mound.
kinda explanation about this for me? Come on, man! They’re your damn wings, shouldn’t you know this shit?”
“No. Uh, no, Cas, I wouldn’a stabbed you in the chest after,” Dean agrees. “And that really sucks, man. Obviously I mean I already
sulk until now. Well, good. Jackass can sit there and feel bad about things for awhile since all this is his fault in the first place.
Sam looks away and doesn’t say anything. Dean realizes he doesn’t actually buy what just came outta his own mouth, because something about all of this is screwy, and he feels like he’s being watched even though there’s nobody here but them. He gets his mind back on track. Focus. Logic. Show Sammy that this ain’t some angel.
Castiel resigns himself to the fact that this is inevitable. It doesn’t mean he needs to be happy about it.
For the concerned readers in the comments on the previous chapter - believe it or not, but almost getting murdered in my own apartment is far from the most traumatizing thing that's ever happened to me, and I don't even think about it most of the time. Recalling it mostly exists as a means to remind me to be more careful basically, but also comes in handy for writing fics on occasion. Long story short, in that regard, I promise I'm totally fine :)
Castiel can’t do it anymore. He shakes his head and watches his feet. “I don’t own you, Dean. It’s only a manner of protection. You aren’t going to Hell again.” He starts to feel it - Naomi may be closing in and Heaven is about to notice that he isn’t supposed to be here. But with those things is a third presence, something else powerful that seems to be taking an interest in what he’s doing. He can’t tell what it is but it frightens him. “I must go, now. I believe a time will come very soon where you’ll need my assistance, and when that happens, pray. I’ll come for you.”
“I’m getting better about it,” Gabriel protests, trying (and failing) not to be too defensive. “Eat your salad, Gigantor.”
“I have no reason to destroy you, Castiel. Despite being a problem, you’re still useful. And besides, you’re as entertaining as you are insufferable. Your inability to adhere to the script is a great annoyance to God. It’s why I raised you at Stull.”
Cas reaches around behind his own back and plucks a feather from… somewhere. “We aren’t in Heaven, so it’ll disappear in a few hours,” he warns, grabbing Dean’s hand in both of his to tenderly close Dean’s fingers around it. “But the sentiment remains unchanged.”
Interestingly, John has exactly nothing to say about this to any of them. Castiel would’ve thought it might stand to reason that here he berates them for disrupting the game, but he’s strangely silent on the issue. That seems odd but also indicative of an extremely disturbing truth.
“Because that’s what happened,” Dean mumbles. “The lace on my fucking boot snapped and I had to stop and fix it. So a buddy’a mine found an IED the hard way, when it should’a been me. The only thing we found was his helmet, the rest’a him was just… gone. There wasn’t even any guts.”
“Colors on our shirts - it isn’t important,” Castiel growls. “I will punch you, if you keep being so unpleasant, they all here will laugh at you for it too.”
“Give it back,” Cas demands, because that paper was drawn on by him and is therefore his property… and he absolutely can’t stand anyone touching his things. Thankfully, Dean relinquishes it without arguing.
“Okay, I’ll ask Sammy to go get him,” Dean shrugs. “Here.” He feeds Cas another spoonful of pudding. “Y’know you’re gonna get sick’a this flavor eating it over and over for a week straight.”
“Will he still be my roommate? Not all the beds here are full anymore and the nurses often call him snuggling me ‘inappropriate,’” Cas confesses.
“It’s just a spirit, Sam, okay, and it’s not the first one to be able to read people’s minds. Okay lemme guess. You were
Castiel steps forward and smacks Sam across the face, as hard as possible without inciting a concussion or a spinal injury.
Dean’s eggs scramble for a second. Because on the rack, the demons who come by to cut on him are disguised as Dad, as Sam, as Mom. His hands shake because he can see all the blood they’re covered in. Nothing’s coming to save him, he wants to scream for help but his throat got pulled out hours ago, oh god, oh god, they’re gonna let the hellhounds come over to chew on him for awhile-
“How the hell did you find us?” Dean demands, standing up and glaring at Gabriel, who’s munching on a large bag of M&M candies.
“You’re so sad, Dean,” Cas says, very quietly. He’s concerned his friend will start yelling or throwing things - it wouldn’t be the first time. Dean gets upset very easily and when he gets upset he gets violent. “I believe, personally, that you are in fact worth the time and effort to be made well again. It hurts me that you’re sad. I want you to feel better. That’s all, that’s all I meant. I’m sorry.”
The sleep doesn’t come. However, he does indulge in a peaceful sensation caressing him, folding him into the nothingness. Perhaps it lasts for several years, he has no means to be sure, but time is meaningless in any case, especially here. Castiel refuses to dwell on it.
“Jack, you know how when we were in apocalypse-world and every single person-slash-celestial-being was wigging out about you talking to Lucifer?”
John sends the second line and the third D-pair out to take the faceoff at center ice, and when play starts again the announcement comes over the stadium speakers:
Dean circles aimlessly around town and Cas relaxes some, watching the streets go by through his window. Every so often he’ll see a person that his brain disguises as a demon, and he also notes exactly one who looks like another angel.
Castiel doesn’t open his eyes, because he’s aware of how pointless it would be to do so. The same black emptiness will exist outside his eyelids just as it does behind them. He allows himself to be folded into it, and awaits a long sleep.
Dean doesn’t wanna think about any of this mess anymore. He swigs down whiskey like it’s beer until he’s hit almost a bottle and a half’s worth of alcohol, by which point it’s been way too long and he figures he should find out what the hell those two are doing. That actually turns out to not be a fantastic idea, because he’s drunk enough to be off-balance and suddenly a stack of books jumps out on the floor right in front of where his foot’s trying to go.
It takes three days for Dean to be back on his feet, and even then he’s all woozy and shit if he stays standing too long or walks around too much. Meanwhile Cas still hasn’t done a damn thing but lie there, totally unconscious. At this point they don’t really have any other choice besides take him to a hospital, which means fake names, fake documents, and a whole rash of fucking excuses for Cas’ condition. He’s clearly not gonna get better on his own and none of them have the skills needed to take care of him.
After spending all night making and then orienting a fresh batch of angels (to say nothing of hearing Naomi bitching and moaning about his methods the whole fucking time), Gabriel’s entire goal this morning before the humans start moving and making noise is to eat five pounds of chocolate-dipped strawberries. He deserves it after having to stop Naomi and Castiel from tearing each other’s throats out eight times.
Cas sets down his bag of stuff on the floor beside the nurses station and paces anxiously by the whiteboard, where his name hasn’t been erased yet. He reminds himself that demons aren’t real, that he’s a human being. (And Dean’s reason to keep clinging on - most people, Cas thinks, would find that troublesome or a burden. He considers it a privilege because he knows what a good man Dean really is when everything’s boiled down.)
And that’s what tips over the scale. Castiel sees it flare up in Dean’s eyes and face, a reactive outrage in response to a friend who’s only trying to help. Dean’s soul is screaming and the Mark mistranslates that scream into bloodlust.
The intermission report is just barely starting when Dean’s phone rings - the name on his screen is shocking.
ADDENDUM. The above thing happened! I will kill something with my bare hands now to make myself feel better. Fuck them and their fucking cheating over-salary-cap roster, they can drop dead.
“I’m not gonna rip your feathers out, Cas,” Dean says eventually, still stroking his fingers through them. He forces himself to stop and gently takes hold of the wing, walking over and manually folding it up against Cas’ back. “But you gotta do better in the future.”
Dean grins and hugs him on arrival before signing for him. “Alright, ready to get the hell outta here finally?”
They’re both already in their spandex base layers underneath track pants and sweatshirts so shedding their outer clothes is all they have to do before putting on all the pads (mostly because Dean figured it would be way less inappropriate). It takes him all of seven minutes to be almost fully dressed for a practice, by which point he has to help tie Jack’s skates and also realize that his right glove is
Cas doesn’t run for the nurses’ station because they’ve told him multiple times to not do that. He really wants to, though, especially because his brother is following him at a brisk pace.
“It’s okay, I got it,” Sam insists, finally breaking the Demon Tablet free. All around the house is a vicious thunderstorm as they open the squiggly rocks.
Corbett, the rookie, snags a pass and breaks formation from the others, almost making it to the blue line and then flinging the puck up the ice to clear it and force the Habs out of the attacking zone. The Habs goalie moves out a few feet to whack it back towards the red line and it sails through the air to slam Spangler in the chest, who kicks it with his skate blade so he can grab it with his stick and carries it into the attacking zone. Dean’s almost holding his breath for a shorthanded attempt, but it doesn’t happen because before Spangler can do anything a Hab rams into him and the refs blow the play dead.
Speaking of. Jack comes running out of his room at top speed and Castiel drops everything in order to catch him and scoop him up.
After Castiel wraps up his final set he sends Jack to go sit in the stands surrounding the ice along with Benny’s daughter, who also apparently attends the same kindergarten and was brought over because her mother needed to go back to work. Dean can’t do on-ice drills so he goes out as well to keep an eye on the rambunctious children that showed up much earlier than they were supposed to.
“He’s not trying to hide,” Gabe says. “And when we brought him here to open the rift he was unconscious, so he probably doesn’t know where we are. Right now he’s in Ohio.”
“Yes, I’m aware. Yet you’re here with me anyway like you said you would and despite my complete indifference on the subject of neckties.”
Distantly, he senses something. But what he finds is frightening. A greater demon, one that by all accounts shouldn’t even still exist, holding a number of captives seemingly for the purposes of amusement. Castiel rummages his knowledge of the demonic and is forced to reach back much further to things he learned when he was a little younger, perhaps two hundred thousand years ago. Lucifer creating greater demons. There was Lilith, Cain, Alastair, Princes and Knights. What he detects is not a Knight - much too powerful - so likely a Prince, because he would’ve easily recognized Cain.
“Right.” Dean snags a second beer and heads to the library. Sitting down again and staring at the fucking book, trying to remember where he stopped, something occurs to him. “So Gabe’s the main source for this, right?”
“Oh.” Cas has no idea what to say. He doesn’t know his oldest brother, Michael was already ten years old when Cas was born. “Um. Hello.”
“Okay, we can get that straightened out for you, though. There are plenty of options available for community support, and because you’re legally disabled your medical insurance will cover a surprising amount of stuff. Besides that there are lots of programs for assistance that you almost definitely qualify for.”
“Anyway, I think you’re not a hundred percent right on that one, Cas. I think maybe having’s got a lot to do with happiness. And I also think even with the being and saying parts, you probably still want to
“With the mark being visible and accessible, it offers some amount of protection from demons attempting to steal you. The mark can only be removed by the entity that placed it there to begin with. Hence Alastair’s expectations of taking you back with him being unrealistic. It’s possible that he could’ve done it, but there’d be resistance and if he did manage to get you down there his power to harm you would’ve been severely hampered. Of course, you’d also be rescued again.”
“Don’t get all sarcastic with me, boy. Now, forget Heaven and your damn archangels and the apocalypse for a minute, wouldja? Do you even understand why Dean’s so mad?”
The words leap unbidden to his mind as if he’s hearing them all over again. Castiel strongly suspects that he could come to any point in time where Dean is cognizant, and in every one of those points Dean will always be Dean in the ways that matter. It’s a comforting idea.
“I will now get up and change my clothes. You will also change your clothes. And then I’ll force-feed you your breakfast.”
would name their kid Lucifer, so since that would be too stupid in a fic where I'm shooting for realism 99% of the time, I went with the name of his vessel instead. (For the record, finding out his last name is Vaught was SO HARD. It's never said in the show and only briefly appears on Nick's hospital bracelet in s14 according to the wiki.)
He doesn’t stay there, though. He does the sandwich and puts it in the fridge, then sneaks back into his own damn bedroom to sit in the chair at the desk and wait for Cas to get up. His angel. Technically not an angel at all anymore, because Jack’s solution to the thing with the Empty was to purge his grace and reimburse him with a soul, but still. He’ll always be an angel to Dean. Also he has no right to look that pretty when he’s sleeping, most people drool and snore and whatever else but Cas is still unreasonably, devastatingly gorgeous.
Dean thinks extra hard at Cas to make it so that he won’t start crying because he’s not a fucking baby, but even with that particular function shut off it doesn’t stop him from feeling like he really, really needs to. He also doesn’t know if he can talk right now, either. His wings reflexively wrap around him, which would probably work a lot better if they had all their feathers. Dean fixes on that, on the wings. He just needs to think about something else. Focus on the wings.
are generally getting in the way of their opponents while Castiel positions himself to screen the Stars’ goalie.
“Dean wouldn’t allow it. I’ve been attempting to make due with my grace, but I frequently lose track of which areas need the most urgent tending.”
“Thank you, Sammy, for making this easier on me and not being a complete dick about it when I already feel bad enough about this as it is,” he yells.
Dean processes this. He wonders if Cas is telling the truth, if he was actually in less danger than he thought. Ultimately he figures that there’s no reason why Cas would be lying about that. Plus Cas doesn’t really seem to lie most of the time anyway, at least not directly. He’d be way more likely to just fly away if Dean asks something he doesn’t want to answer.
“It feels a little weird now, knowing I am. I never expected… why didn’t you make me wear condoms if this was possible?”
Approximately an hour before Dean will wake up for coffee, Sam approaches him with a very bizarre question: “Hey Cas, if I was an angel, what kind would I be?”
“Um… the time-displaced one,” Cas says. “And I apologize. This is where I am right now and it’s taking up my focus. Here.” Now they’re sitting on the dock by the lake together with a tackle box, which is a massive improvement. “What’s wrong, Dean?”
On the ninety third morning, Cas eats one of his lemon puddings while meeting with his psychiatrist because his breakfast wasn’t particularly satisfying and also he enjoys citrus in most forms. (Except grapefruit - too bitter and unpleasant.) It’s a type of stimming, technically, and the main reason he’s constantly drinking orange juice.
“I was just thinking about how we carve devil’s traps into bullets to pin demons, do you think we could do a similar thing with the Enochian? It might help take some of the wind out of Lucifer’s sails if we hit him with them.”
“Nope. Not enough angels, and even if there were they’d only be able to hold him back for awhile.” Dean snorts, suddenly. “And this is a rite of passage for you, actually.”
“Hey!” barks a voice, and then there’s a hand on Cas’s shoulder, grounding him instantly. “The hell’s going on?”
Is Dean upset with him? Did he do something wrong? Cas tries to backpedal. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said-”
at her, but does eventually release Cas from his grip. Cas changes into a fresh pair of hospital pajamas; Dean doesn’t bother. They head out for breakfast and Cas watches him drink three cups of coffee but fail to eat anything besides two strips of bacon.
As they’re all sitting and shucking their pads, Dean glances around to make sure his dad really left and the door’s closed. He sits up straight and takes a deep breath before making a tiny, rare act of rebellion.
love language. His life is extremely difficult, I make an effort to relieve the strain on him wherever I can.” And he leaves Gabriel alone to think.
“It’s only been two days,” Castiel points out. “And the angels in apocalypse-world won’t be eager to help him gather the items he’d need to perform his own rift spell. If nothing else, they’ll slow him down at least. There’s time. Besides, chronic insomnia is incredibly unhealthy for humans.”
“Yes, you’ve mentioned those. Or you will. Dean, I’m from 2013. I was fleeing from other angels who are angry with me for resisting their brainwashing techniques and to avoid them I flew into time. During the course of my travels it occurred to me to undo the worst mistake I’ve ever made, the details of which I’ll get into once I’m sure you believe what I’m telling you.”
Castiel prepares himself to reassure this young version of his favorite human, but before he can speak he’s met with discharge from a firearm. Dean’s green eyes are enormous and bright with shock, likely at the fact that Castiel remains essentially unharmed.
whips it into the sideboards to pass indirectly to Kevin and Kevin bolts away from them all towards the other end.
But it’s a great prank. Unexpected? Check. Obnoxious and/or humiliating? Check. Not able to affect innocent bystanders? Check. Technically harmless? Check. Personalized to the victim? Check. Enormous pain in the ass to undo? Major check. Samsquatch struck all the right notes and Gabriel can’t even be mad.
He watches his brother produce a third Snickers bar and begin eating it. Despite the annoyance factor, Cas is still glad Gabriel came to see him.
“Gently, first of all,” Gabriel warns. “Don’t yank on the feathers, if there are any loose ones they’ll fall out pretty easily when your fingers pass through them. Mostly you’re just straightening them out, some of them are clumped up and crooked. Like I said, it’s really easy.”
Because he doesn’t think he could forgive anybody but Cas for this magnitude of dumbassery and such enormous mistakes. But this is Cas. Cas has always been a special case, the exception to his rules.
A great big thanks to everyone who comments, left kudos, and/or subscribed! You're wonderful and I love you all even if I don't particularly love this fic that much :D
“Is he actually talking to you, or are you just trying to derail the conversation?” she asks, somehow not being pissy with him about it.
“Well, that’s the most important thing,” he cedes. “And you shouldn’t necessarily put too much stake in Gabriel’s opinions on what media you consume when he’s made questionable choices regarding films in the past.”
“It’s not dissimilar in principle,” Castiel says slowly. “But humans are much more creative and varied about it from what I’ve observed. Much of our courting process involves our wings and feathers, and ultimately assesses compatibility to build a nest together. A mated pair of angels will groom each other and molt together once per century, or at least that’s how it was before the Fall. It’s reasonable to assume this behavior will be adopted by the new generation of angels that Gabriel is constructing in Heaven, since they have fresh and undamaged wings. But the few original brothers and sisters I have left are all in possession of destroyed wings and they no longer bother with grooming.”
“Sam and Dean and Mary are all behaving weirdly about Cas possessing Dean. But I thought it’s a good thing, because now he’ll get better.”
Sam makes some kind of noise that’s a hybrid between a quiet laugh and a sigh. “Yeah, this is definitely preferable.” He sets down his fork so that he can pick up the feather and turn it delicately between the tips of his finger and thumb. “So if I was an angel, you’d just give up a feather and that’d be it?”
“I think it’s only fair that you know,” Cas decides. “I’m technically putting you in danger just by my presence here.”
Castiel skates a few quick laps when they come onto the ice for warm-ups, eyes on his compatriots in their white away sweaters and leg socks. He has a routine drawn up by now, to stop other players and offer small tips and insights to them, because he wears an A and that’s one of his jobs. He thinks forward to when Dean is back and the two of them will be doing it together before the games start, they’ll need to discuss it beforehand so that they aren’t giving conflicting information to their lower-ranking players. It will be a time for synergy and communication; Castiel has no wish to clash against his friend.
Castiel is leaning against the wall, holding his phone and opening FaceTime. After a few seconds Dean can just barely see the face of a little kid appear.
“All the weird shit I seen as a hunter and you think I’m gonna have a problem with you for that? And for a second can you pretend you don’t think I’m a dumbass and didn’t already know? Me and Sam had a bet going how long you’d stay in denial before you finally gave up and slept with Cas. Too bad I kicked it or I prob’ly would’a won, too.”
“Raphael broke my nose twice and my arm once… all three were separate incidents. Lucifer kicked me in the head once and the concussion was so severe I was taken to the emergency room. Of course, Lucifer also stabbed Gabriel with a kitchen knife. Fortunately it only required stitches and a tetanus shot. I believe these warning signs should’ve warranted more attention than they got that he would become a serial killer. I haven’t seen him in years, but I remember him behaving like a spoiled child most of the time even though he should’ve outgrown that behavior a very long time ago.”
“In Heaven, when angels have grievances against each other there are a number of approved methods for conflict resolution. Most minor disagreements are resolved by complaining to someone higher on the chain of command so that an angel of superior rank can mediate the discussion, but there are other ways to do it as well. Occasionally the offending party is demoted or imprisoned. There’s also a practice that… is officially discouraged, but still takes place and is often purposely overlooked by commanders and supervisors. If the problem is serious enough, then the angel who’s been wronged will pull some of the primary feathers out of the wing of the angel who did the wronging. It’s not serious enough to fully inhibit flight but it does make it uncomfortable and difficult to do so.”
Pacing around in this fucking hallway, Dean doesn’t get how there aren’t more hallways, this is like an extra-long shipping container but with doors. The ends are closed off. Great. Fucking
They don’t speak much for several minutes, in large part because Castiel wants to afford Dean the opportunity to finish his absurdly overstuffed sandwich. That aside, he’s also thinking carefully about the events of today. Dean is not going to heal from a lifetime of internalized homophobia in such a short time, but progress has certainly been made. The blame for this situation rests almost entirely on John Winchester, but that’s par for the course when it comes to the man who single-handedly twisted the psyche of a gentle and loving soul into an instrument of death.
When Castiel receives and indulges Dean’s prayer, he’s busily using his angel blade to carve every concealment sigil he knows into the flesh of his vessel. He keeps his wings tucked close to his back and smothers the activity of his grace as much as he can while remaining functional - he needs it to maintain his motility, because without it the trauma of containing the Angel Tablet inside of his chest cavity will be too debilitating for him to complete his current objective.
“People have told me in the past that eye contact facilitates better communication. Personally I don’t like looking at people most of the time, it’s distracting and at times frightening.”
Dean can’t handle this, actually, he’s pretty sure he’s about to break under the weight of everything Cas has said to him. “But now you’re gonna die soon.”
Oh, right. Jack is a toddler. Even after fighting a war in apocalypse-world, he’s only like a year old. Gabe’s teaching him to fight other archangels but he also likes to watch cartoons and snuggle a teddy bear. It’s such a bizarre combo of behaviors and sometimes Dean feels like he gets whiplash while watching them compete with each other.
“You look even more constipated than usual, Feathers,” Crowley remarks from his right. “May we get you some colon-blow?”
Both their voices are quiet now and Cas remembers that Dean was three seconds from pulling the trigger on himself when Sam walked in. Thinking about Dean with a gun in his mouth makes Cas feel sick.
the one who stopped him from getting beat as a kid and apparently answered his prayers a few times even if he didn’t know he was making them. His best friend, his guardian angel, his… his.
do the predictable thing by making an epic battle?" Because this idea just felt so much more interesting. I highly recommend that chunk of meta, it's an excellent read.
about the second-youngest archangel, which I stumbled across by sheer accident :D prior to that I had very few thoughts about Raphael tbh because he's really only in s6 besides his one appearance in FTBYAM, but that post really got my brain jogging and I was like "hmm, what if I
“Dammit,” Sammy hisses. “Um. We’ve got some spare angel blades in storage, can you turn them into bullets in a hurry?”
Yes, he probably is. Cas manages to even take a nap like this, pleasantly trapped by the heavy warmth. When he wakes up Dean is still there and a nurse is checking on them - Cas has been roused by them arguing.
“Enough with the air quotes, mate,” Crowley snorts, briefly using English for that phrase before switching back again for absolutely no reason at all that Castiel can ascertain. “You’re not subtle, by the way. The talk is frequently going around about how much you stare at him.”
as unsubtle as the crush you’ve had on Cas for the past decade. Actually he’s the only thing less subtle than you, you’re both just thick.”
The first line changes on, which has Lee Webb and Cole cycling the puck back and forth between each other while they try to get out of the neutral zone. It ends up being Daniel who carries it over the blue line, passes to Victor, who spanks the puck off the Lightning goalie’s leg pad. It springs away and nobody can grab it in time, which gets a breakaway for a lucky Bolt - the fucker jets away towards the Isles’ defensive zone and rips off a shot that Frank snatches out of the air and hangs onto. The whistle goes.
He chuckles. “Yeah, that was a helluva night.” Then he feels his friend’s distress running up his back. “What is it, Cas?”
“But… aren’t you going to prank him? That sounds like a lie, Uncle Gabe. I don’t like lying, it makes my stomach hurt.”
“Super,” Dean grumbles. “I don’t know if you noticed, but I kinda suck at the whole feelings thing…”
“Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Thank you, Dean. He really only needs to stay busy until he can come watch us scrimmage.”
They get in Dean’s car, which has no seatbelts - logically Cas is aware that this isn’t technically a good thing, but it’s one less sensory issue he’ll have to put up with and that makes him happy. He settles comfortably against the seat and prepares to watch Dean drive for forty minutes.
“Cas!” Dean yelps, bolting over and gathering him up from the floor. “Cas. Okay. How ’bout you lay down, okay?”
The Isles all head out for warmups and Dean, for the first time since he’s had the C forced on him, actually has a good feeling about tonight’s game. The Bolts are a pain in the ass but they’re nowhere near as bad to play against as teams like the Caps or the Rangers.
“Okay, she’s all set now.” Castiel looks and Sam is feeding her a bottle of formula - they’d stocked up on baby supplies long before this point. “How’re you feeling, Cas?”
“Great.” Dean drops down to sit on the end of his bed and rubs his hand over his hair. He says nothing else until the nurse leaves. “So what the hell are you in for, huh?”
Gabriel’s doing a shoot today. Michael lives an hour from Gabriel’s house and so almost two hours from the hospital, and Anna’s even further - and they’re both working, of course. Sam, needless to say, is at his law office as well. This leaves one person and one person only available to drive Cas home, but he isn’t about to complain. He thinks it would be impossible for him not to appreciate their time together.
“Oh come on, Dean-o, I’m sure even you can figure it out for yourself. Besides, you should be happy to see me! I’m happy to be here, too!”
Apparently, the first line knows something that Castiel’s line doesn’t, because once the offside faceoff is resolved the Isles ring in their third:
His hands stop and he can’t make them move for a few minutes, because he doesn’t understand how this happened. He didn’t necessarily need to teach Sam the lesson at the Mystery Spot, but setting aside the fun of repeatedly ganking obnoxious-ass Dean he had good intentions the entire time because he wanted Sam to figure it out. Plus, Sam’s soul is more pleasant to look at - Dean’s is much too bright, it actually hurts Gabriel’s eyes and he has no idea how Castiel puts up with it. And when he stuck them in his idiot box, he let Sammy be the savior-doctor, and the car, and the star of the commercial. His pranks finally got Sam’s attention, and Sam reciprocated, only to take it back at the last second. Talk about mixed signals.
“Uh…” Shit, he has to actually think about that, which means it’s been way too long. “Like. Six months ago-ish. It was our last week before playoffs and I ended up with a really bad Grindr hookup.”
“Great. Now get the hell out,” Dean orders, because he seriously ain’t in the mood to handle whatever new unreasonable request he’s about to get. Cas wouldn’t show up and heal him for no reason, there’s gotta be something else nasty waiting just around the corner. When Cas does nothing Dean rolls his eyes. “Don’t you got someplace better to be right now? Like guarding seals or whatever?”
“What kind of pet?” Gabriel questions around a mouthful of Skittles that came from his jacket pocket.
After multiple bowls of oatmeal with strawberries and five Advil, Castiel goes to the practice arena. As is typical right now, Dean is present along with everyone else, but the types of exercise he can do are somewhat limited and he isn’t allowed on the ice for skills or scrimmages at all. He has his regular trainer and one of the medical trainers keeping eyes on him the same way Castiel watches Jack’s Halloween or Christmas candy to make sure none is getting eaten immediately before dinner; from this, he surmises that Dean has had issues in the past adhering to a recovery schedule. Given what Castiel understands about Dean, that isn’t surprising at all.
Castiel holds still and relaxes. It’s been longer than he can be bothered to recall since the last time he’s had his wings groomed by a sibling and the sensation is a welcome one, even with less than twenty percent of his plumage growing in at this point.
“My brother Sammy. He’s the one who saw… he was checking in on me because I didn’t call for a couple weeks.” It’s amazing - Dean, now sitting on the edge of his bed, is finally explaining himself to Cas. “Can I ask you something?”
Cas' truck is not one of the trucks he has in the show, it's actually my truck because I love my truck :D plus, Tacomas are unkillable. They're the best pickup trucks and everyone should have one.
Cas is staring at Dean from across the locker room. Like, more than usual. Just before they head back to the ice for the 2nd Cas starts signing.
“What does it matter what I wanted when you were little?” she says, surprising him. “Sweetheart, you
Castiel abruptly assembles the facts in his mind and subsequently begins to panic. The messages on Angel Radio had appeared mere minutes after he’d had sex with Dean that morning. He has a headache, when normally angels don’t experience that type of minor grievance. A Bible has burned him. He’s frightened of ingesting poisonous substances.
“Uh-huh. Imagine that. You doing somethin’ stupid and getting your fool ass blown up for your efforts ain’t his idea of a good day. And guess what, when he has to deal with you, me’n Sam gotta deal with
“You actually thought Cas was gonna let him off the hook like that?” Gabriel snorts, feeling for his archangel blade and quickly yoinking it back into his hand from ten feet away. “Have you
Dean has a hell of a time trying to move right now, he’s still getting healed up, nothing in him is working quite right yet. Every last drop of strength he can dig up goes into just one arm, raising a hand to feel limply and find a shoulder, more rough clothing - a collar. Actually, two collars. One of a coat and then of… that can’t be. A dress shirt?
“Cas - it’s okay. You weren’t tryna get me hurt or anything. You already got my forgiveness for… whatever. All of it. And if. Uh. If you’re really gonna go, then. You should prob’ly start tryna forgive yourself for some’a that shit, too. I know you think you’re a fuckup, and that’s fair ’cause you kinda are, but you never did anything but try to help. So.”
Castiel puzzles over their brief conversation for a moment, but ultimately decides it’s not important or concerning enough to warrant further examination and returns to considering the power upgrade that his brother has offered him. Admittedly, the idea isn’t an unwelcome one by any means, but he does harbor some reservations about it because he vividly remembers what happened when he swallowed the souls and the leviathan from Purgatory. Of course, he’s grown since then, and this time Dean will be informed from the beginning and can help him adjust. When he’d been engaged in his foolish war against Raphael it was at a point in time where, by comparison to humans, he still had the emotional maturity of a toddler. Castiel likes to believe that he’s much wiser and more tempered now.
“Yes, I see that now. I would appreciate you not mentioning it to Dean. As far as I’m aware, he doesn’t know and I’m also sure he doesn’t reciprocate. But I promise it had nothing to do with my decision to facilitate his healing process. I would’ve done this for Sam, too, in the same circumstances.”
After doing discharge paperwork all morning and then waiting, wasting time, it’s almost noon as they’re getting close to town and so Dean goes through the drive-thru to obtain lunch. Cas expects Dean to ask what he wants to order - everyone always does, as if he ever orders anything different, which is really annoying for him - but it doesn’t happen. After bringing Cas McDonald’s once Dean simply remembers his chosen items on the menu and orders them on his behalf without checking first.
“Presumably the immense emotional strain by itself exhausted you even without accounting for everything else,” Cas speculates calmly. “How are you feeling, Dean?”
Gabriel, frankly, is shocked. (And kind of impressed. Maybe a little turned on. Sam’s such a sharp tack.) “How’d you know?”
“Yeah, he said… since my disability ain’t like yours, since it’s temporary, I’m gonna need a job at some point, right? Well, I already know how to fix cars, so if I went and did actual classes on it I’m pretty much guaranteed to ace the course and then I can just work as a mechanic. It’s something I’m already good at anyway. Seems like it could work.”
Dean. Getting up off his ass, Dean looks all around but still can’t find Cas anywhere. Is it because he was so freaked out by the vacuum-hose-feeling that his focus broke? That must be it. So Dean closes his eyes again, and he’s a little more ready this time, and he lands on his feet when the vacuum thing has stopped on its own.
Day seventy eight. Dean has been here for three weeks, which Cas knows is an unusually long stay for the average psychiatric patient. This is thanks to Sam bullying Dean’s insurance provider because Dean is clearly not well enough to be left unsupervised yet. Cas is glad that his friend has such a competent and caring brother. Dean deserves to get better.
“It’s okay, Sam! I went with him and made sure there was no malicious tampering!” Jack speaks up helpfully.
“It’s a really long story that I don’t wanna get into right now, Cas, sorry. Thanks for not letting him talk to Dean, that’s a really big favor and I appreciate it.”
“Cas!” Dean yells, dropping hard onto his knees. “Cas…” He grabs Cas by the shoulder and shakes - nothing. “Cas, c’mon man, wake up… Cas. Cas! Dammit, I gotta get you outta here, c’mon!”
“I took down a monster,” Dean growls, stuffing his pistol into the back of his jeans. “Because that’s what I do. And I will continue to do that, until…”
That’s not what Dean means to say, but that’s what comes out. But that’s kinda how it always is for him, right? Whenever he’s pissed he always says shit without thinking first. Why should today be different?
“Is the entire point of this exercise for you to insult the way that I dress? If I wanted that I could’ve stayed with my last team.”
The store clerk positively squeals at them as she’s leading them away to ring up the items. Castiel accepts the apparent burden that is Dean’s friendship and pays for a number of shirts and ties he doesn’t feel he actually needs, largely because it felt nice to be called handsome and he wants it to happen again. On a smaller scale, he also feels somewhat bad for Dean being injured, so he’ll put up with this to help his friend feel better.
Eventually his back is clean and dry again, at least for a few minutes. Dean pulls on a fresh shirt and refuses to feel awkward about everything that Cas said to him. He really wishes he could go out and work on a case to clear his head, but he’s pretty much on mandatory bed rest until he finishes healing up. Plus this day is already longer than an actual day thanks to his trip upstairs, so he’s a weird combination of restless and bored yet exhausted in spite of taking a nap. And he’s sure the whole wing-healing-thing is taking it outta him too. Maybe he needs nutrition or whatever.
“He’s a danger to himself and everyone around him. We need to do something before he hurts anyone else.”
Rescue from Cas’ confused thoughts comes unexpectedly in the form of a phone call from Sam, who updates him on the case. Once business has been concluded Cas recounts Dean’s behavior and asks for an explanation.
Castiel is baffled, not only by the subject of conversation but also by Jack’s intense (if naive) concern.
He doesn’t like the bubble. It distorts his depth perception and no matter how much gelatin spray is used on the inside it always fogs at least slightly and it makes it ten times more difficult to drink gatorade. For now, he’s not wearing a mouthguard, which poses an additional drawback because he’ll need to find another mode of stimming while on the bench. He settles for tucking his right glove under his arm so that he can repeatedly pull his hand out of it and put it back in again, which isn’t as fun.
“It’s inscribed with the Word of God,” Cas explains gravely. “But it’s powerful beyond just that. An angel could potentially tap into its energy and become unfathomably dangerous as a result. I’m not aware of how one would go about doing such a thing, but it’s possible.”
“Not usually, no. He may be able to make it for Christmas, though… presuming I can find an excuse for Michael to not be there. They don’t get along at all.”
Cas doesn’t say anything, just walks over and touches his forehead. Immediately Dean’s filled with a warm-tingly-comforting feeling, the aches and much sharper pains of his injuries washing away until he’s basically restored to mint. That kinda pisses him off, though. Why’d he have to wait until now for this jackass to come fix him?
It’s kinda too bad. Sam would’ve been a fantastic NHL goaltender, especially being so damn tall as an adult.
“Well thanks for bringing me up to speed. It ain’t like I can help from all the way up here, but it’s nice to be kept in the loop,” Bobby chuckles. “Now, I might be dead, but I ain’t stupid, boy. The hell are you stalling for?”
The fans are all singing along with the goal song as they skate back to the bench, bumping fists with their teammates on the way by. Dean ends up sandwiched between Benny and Castiel.
Dean works on that idea mentally for a second. “So what, eventually you’d build me a bed or something?”
Cas sighs through his nose. “Dean, I would like to do that for you, but I don’t think it’s allowed. They’ll assume I’m stealing your meal. However I will take my tray here as well, and you won’t have to eat by yourself.”
there things you’re possibly angry about, though?” Bela asks with a smile he doesn’t like. He’s seen it before when she was goading Dean.
“You were tryna tell me a swishy wave of light could somehow be straight,” Bobby answers sarcastically.
Castiel isn’t accustomed to feeling fear during combat, but until now he’s never been directly putting Dean in harm’s way just through his own participation. What’s worse is that Dean can detect Castiel’s emotions and is helpless to react any other way than his own surge of terror, when normally he’s absurdly brave. Instinctively, reflexively, Castiel’s wings flap in a futile attempt to remove them from the impending peril.
“Not really. It’s too vague,” Bobby shrugs. “So how much danger are we talking from the halo patrol if they catch up?”
Lucifer is standing upright again, grinning and spitting blood. “Well, isn’t that just clever of them. Too bad, I
Now he just feels like a dick. “I’m sorry, Cas. Y’know I, I would’a still helped, I always help my friends.”
“I never tortured him on purpose. Try to empathise, Gabriel. You were very excited when Sam went to the difficulty of pranking you back. Think about how he shows love and affection to people, and then do that, along with offering him your absurdly dangerous book in lieu of a feather. Or, possibly, just give him a feather. He’s extremely intelligent and I’m sure it would take him less than an hour to understand the meaning behind it.”
“Don’t tell Sam what?” Dean grunts, shuffling in already awake for the first time in days instead of Cas doing it for him and fixing his coffee before making him fully conscious.
“Great. Get the fuck outta here, lady. I wasn’t even bothering you guys or nothin’, there’s no reason angels should be flying down to hassle me. I got bigger shit to deal with.”
Castiel’s final thought before the puck drops, glowering at a man he doesn’t know particularly well but very intensely hates, is the same thought he always has in this situation.
“Y’know what, fuck it, I’mma cook it myself,” he decides. “We’re having burgers. Come up to my place at about six.”
This culminates in Gabriel telekinetically pinning him to the spot on his back. Prior-Castiel watches in silence from a distance while layers are pushed aside to bare Castiel’s abdomen, up until the point where Dean’s undershirt is visible and he turns away with a despondently jealous expression. Castiel makes his best effort to hold still, but the molecular bonds of his vessel’s flesh are severed indelicately and he can’t stop a scream as the Tablet is wrested free. It tears small pieces of his grace out with it when it goes, not enough for him to miss but sufficient to cause even further pain.
It’s enough to make him get upset. He didn’t want Sammy to save him. Not this time. He wants to yell at his brother but he can’t move his jaw, his chin is resting on… something. Through his stubble he can feel some kind of fabric, coarsely textured. An arm across his back. And. A palm on the back of his head, stroking his hair a little bit. Somebody’s hanging onto him, propping him up.
“Cas,” Dean wheezes, reaching over an arm because no way in hell can he actually sit up right now, forget about standing. “Cas…”
“Yes, I’m aware. Uriel sabotaged the trap. Had he not done so, you would’ve been safe. It was outside my control just as much as yours, Dean. I apologise for that. It shouldn’t have happened that way.” Cas pauses, almost for too long. “Dean. I wouldn’t have allowed him to take you back there. Regardless of whether he’d succeeded to kill you, your soul no longer has a signature on it claiming it for Hell. Without that in place even a demon as powerful as Alastair was would have extreme difficulty pulling it down to the pit without the aid of a reaper or a hellhound. I would’ve had time to stop him, and either the archangels would’ve directed me to resurrect you again or I would’ve taken your soul to Heaven. At no point would you have ever returned to Hell.”
“I’m not ‘improving’ fast enough. That makes him angry. He controls my life, Dean. I can’t come back to the outside world until he says so.”
They chirp back and forth for the next few minutes before they arrive at Amalie Arena, occasionally including Cas even though it always seems to go over his head. Heading into the locker room, the team settles mostly into the same configuration they have at the Coliseum, which means that Cas is more or less across from Dean and Benny is right beside him. And it also means, unfortunately, that his best friend who knows him too fucking well is onto him and now wants to talk about it right before a god damn game of all times and places.
to do than the first one. Turns out my hockey playlist is great to listen to when writing epic battles between pissy archangels. As a sidenote, Dean in Dad Mode TM is possibly my favorite version of him ^_^
“No, Cas. Shut up. Mom, let’s just skip a step and pretend you already said you’re disappointed in me or whatever and then never bring it up again. You don’t have to talk to me or even think about it, and actually, I
And now another you showed up to warn me about it ’cause apparently Bobby actually dies from whatever it is you’re tryna do, and Sam’s gonna get hurt, you’re gonna get hurt, lots’a people’re gonna die, and none’a that’s okay, dammit! Why didn’t you just ask for help? We would’a helped you! We could’a figured this out! Instead apparently you’re running around with fucking
“Set him down, Sammy. Here, take her, I’ll take care of Cas.” Castiel is gently manhandled by his boyfriend and eventually ends up in bed with burn dressings plastering his hands. Dean begins wiping the blood off his face, speaking softly. “Did other angels do this? Were they already there?”
so if he wants to let you touch his wings you should totally go for it, it’s like rubbing your hand on a cloud.”
Despite his cynicism, Dean seems to be in an excellent mood while preparing his monstrous pile of bacon. Castiel wonders what Dean would say if he became aware that every night while he sleeps his arteries receive preventative maintenance with the help of angel grace.
“Nah, my best-friend-slash-unofficial-sister,” he laughs. “I’ve known her forever, we bonded over not being straight in high school.”
“No matter how much you don’t wanna hear it, my answer’s still the same for that. Other you knew what he did was wrong. Now you can own that, and admit you screwed up, and maybe you and Dean will finally get over yourselves and talk to each other like adults. Or you can keep bein’ an idjit and moping at the table makin’ us all miserable with you.”
have a choice with you, and then you still screwed me over. Family you kinda gotta expect to fuck up every so often, but you-” Dean stops for a second when his voice cracks and shakes his head. “I
He knows that as soon as he takes his glove off, his hand is going to swell up like a fucking balloon and that glove won’t be going back on again. So he has to grab the bottle of Gatorade with his left hand instead, which just feels weird and unnatural. He’s so distracted by his stupid fucking injury that he even forgets to make fun of Cas, who’s aggressively chewing his mouthguard like always. Around the mutilated synthetic rubber that’s bobbing in the corner of his lips, Cas is bickering loudly with Crowley in some language that’s not English, which is another very typical thing that happens on the bench.
Other people come into the room at various times. Nurses, probably. Cas ignores all of them. They can’t help him and they refuse to give him more ativan even though he needs it. He’s trapped in fear and there’s no way out. All he can do is wait for it to release him on its own.
Dean chokes on his own tongue and he could swear his heart actually stops beating for a couple of seconds. He stares at Cas and starts to sweat, which would admittedly be a lot more gross if his back wasn’t already drenched in fucking wing oil.
“Angels are made to worship God.” Okay. Not what Dean was expecting. “It’s the first thing we’re taught, as fledgelings, even before we learn to fly. We must worship God almost to the exclusion of anything else. In effect, that’s the only kind of intensive emotions we’re allowed - to love Him. So you can imagine that when an angel falls from Heaven, especially in the case that they find a more worthy cause to serve, that attention refocuses. But that’s not-” Cas stops. He looks like he’s thinking. “It took almost until now for me to understand what’s going on. Dean, I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call. And I believe that spending an extended period of time on Earth and around humans, around you, has drastically altered me. I’m currently disgraced from Heaven again for likely the next several centuries until things are back in order. But the fact that you’re so angry with me is what really makes me feel like I’ve been stripped of a home to go back to.”
Dean shakes his head, and - interestingly - snickers. “You got some balls, Cas. I don’t think anybody else would say that shit to him.”
“Not bad, Feathers,” Crowley mutters beside him. “Keep this up and you’ll trick me into believing you’re a competent hockey player.”
“Hey, whatever floats your boat. But some other angel would get freaked out if you offered.” Gabriel expertly starts picking at the coverts closest to Jack’s shoulder blades. “There’s other things, too. Your best choice would be Cas, if he’d ever bothered to try and teach you this stuff. But I’m sure he was too busy staring at Dean and drooling, so you’re stuck with me for now. Most angels pick a close friend or their mate for this.”
“I find it absolutely incredible,” his friend tells him, “that despite almost twelve years of me doing everything in my power to prove to the contrary, you
What brings him to realize that he should make some attempt at contact is when a frightening theme begins to appear in Dean’s prayers. Dean murmurs similar sets of words - infrequently at first, but gradually becoming more common - which indicate strongly that Dean has no desire to remain alive. Castiel cannot allow that to stand, and is further disappointed in himself for allowing things to come this far before taking a decision to act.
“MIDDLE OF MAY” his brother answers, still with a shit-eating grin. “WE WANTED TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT BEFORE TELLING ANYONE SO WE WOULDN’T JINX IT”
“I’m also aware that you have no genuine desire to help me and you’re only going along with this for your own ends,” Castiel snaps. “And if things fall through before we can finish, they’re much more likely to punish
Dean’s also not sure he’ll ever be able to say it back. But Cas tells him every so often for the past four days, and just because it’s weird and unexpected doesn’t mean he can’t still enjoy it.
When everyone’s warmed up, John sorts out the practice lines and D-pairs; Dean stays with Benny of course because the two of them together are a massive pain in the ass for the other team to say the least, Garth will be their starter goalie for about seventy five percent of games like usual. Castiel gets shuffled into the fourth line with Crowley and Kevin because he’s wearing an A and the fourth line can probably benefit from some leadership, given that the right wing is a rookie and the center is an industrial-grade asshole.
“Yes, I know that, you’re also attracted to women. In fact it seems split approximately sixty-forty in favor of women.” At least Cas looks a little bit uncomfortable - well, he should be, dammit. “Nobody will punish you, Dean. At least not anymore. I know you have an endless list of regrets, but this should never have been one of them.”
“Cas, I really can’t do this now, okay? Can it at least wait a couple weeks until I’m not fucking dying anymore? ’Cause now I’mma just be stuck with this whole damn talk when I got more important shit to worry about.”
for that, last time I laughed that hard Cas and a hooker were involved,” Dean says as he drags himself up off the floor with a huge smile still lighting up his face.
“Fortunately, we aren’t playing the Rangers until next month, so I’ll have plenty of time to adjust,” he comments, meticulously pulling up the bright red
“C’mon, man, I ain’t looking for an apology here. ’Cause. There’s stuff, for me, I never asked for. I figured I couldn’t have it, either. ’Cause I didn’t know angels can feel, which is kinda stupid’a me since you got turned mostly human a couple times.”
So far, they’ve managed to get Kevin and Victor in on the scheme. Kevin is new to the NHL and still has an idealized view of things, which means he hasn’t been completely crushed into submission yet, and Victor is a long-time veteran of awful coaching practices and knows things need to change. Four players, all at once, corroborating the story that John Winchester is unfit to be leading a hockey team is a fairly powerful group perspective as far as media is concerned.
It’s like getting sucked through a damn vacuum cleaner hose or something. Dean’s so glad Sam’s not here for the embarrassing yelp he lets out, because he’s fucking startled okay, he didn’t know it would feel like this. And then when he’s not getting sucked along anymore, it’s because he didn’t pop back into existence still standing, and now he drops about ten feet and lands directly on his face. He’s totally disoriented and just lies there for a second, vibrating from the impact.
For the morning, though, he’s at Wal-Mart, buying the makings of dozens of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches along with windshield washer fluid and fuel injector cleaner for his truck on Dean’s suggestion. Also piled up in the cart: frozen burritos, sour cream, pizza rolls, boxes upon boxes of Capri Sun not-juice pouches, orange juice, breakfast cereal (eaten dry because he doesn’t care for milk), lemon pudding cups.
His wings aren’t perceptible to humans unless he wills it, so he briefly runs the tip of one along Sam’s shoulder and arm. Mostly Sam seems irritated at the moment, despite his hunger being satisfied by leaf vegetables and radishes. Maybe once his stomach is full…
“Okay, Cas. I’m exhausted and you’re somehow even more dense than I thought, so here it is: Dean would be uncomfortable with it because he loves you back but he’s got however many decades of internalized homophobia that he refuses to deal with or admit even exists. And he also probably doesn’t think you’re into him because you’re an angel and angels don’t have feelings usually. There. I just took like three quarters of all that angsty indecision out of the equation for you. I’m going to bed. You’re going to talk to my brother tomorrow.”
Lucifer’s wings twitch just slightly, which is all the warning Gabriel has before his brother flies forward and then lunges to barrel directly into him and topple them both to the floor. His weapon skitters away to parts unknown and there’s a forearm pressing down on his neck, choking and pinning him. Gabriel recenters his weight into his upper back despite his wing and bucks Lucifer off, then rolls sideways and drags himself to his feet - just in time to get telekinetically backhanded into the wall.
If there’s one thing she can be sure of, though, after all the conditioning sessions, it’s that Castiel has an infuriatingly strong attachment to Dean Winchester. So, Dean Winchester is the obvious starting point in her search.
Dean growls and digs his fingernails into his back through his shirt. “Did I get cursed or something and I don’t know about it?”
“I need to do a test screening!” his brother insists in a tone of voice reminiscent of a spoiled child begging for something they don’t deserve.
“God’s honest truth.” Bobby holds up a hand as he says it. “The only reason you ain’t doing it right now is him floating around under your skin and you can’t see him at all.”
It’s a balancing act. Jack isn’t an NHL player, he’s an awkward and klutzy five-year-old just starting out at a team sport. Dean keeps this at the front of his mind. He refuses to do what his dad did when he was learning, to grill and grill and grill endlessly until Dean was crying and couldn’t stand up anymore. Jack doesn’t deserve that treatment. No kid does.
like that an angel, if one showed up, wouldn’t just exude an aura of peace or whatever. Angels might even be vicious. And where the fuck is this all coming from? Every hunter knows angels aren’t real, nobody’s ever seen one in the hundreds of years since lore started to be documented…
