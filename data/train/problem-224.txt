Breakfast consisted of hot water with honey.
He studied and memorised each one.
“No, not that well,” Charlotte said (probably Charles in daily life, John thought). “He was really close to Sue Ann though, whom your friend is now talking to. What’s her name again?”
“You would have been aiming for me, though,” Sherlock said, thinking aloud. “Mary just got in the way of the course of the bullet.”
Without looking up, Sherlock said, “What have you got?”
dedoo… deduce a
She was frowning. “I’ve never seen you two bring her on any cases with the Yard, though,” she said, thoughtfully. “Were things really going that well between John and Mary? I never actually had that impression.” (It seemed like more of an afterthought than an actual question, thank God.)

And, “Isn’t she the cutest?”
single parents managed to do the job, when parenting with just the two of them was already so much more of a challenge than it had been with three.
Where there was hope, there was life.
They fitted together like a key in a lock, opening new worlds visible only to them.
“Shall I get us coffees from that stall over there?” Sherlock asked.
He spent the following hours analysing Bob’s posts and comments on Facebook and Twitter, and looking at the information on his LinkedIn profile, on the website of the company he worked for, as well as that of his former employer, the college he’d attended and the Dungeons&Dragons forum where he was active.
Eurus’s brother was Jim Moriarty!
“You think it’s a trick. You look so... unsure. You’re not used to being unsure, are you?”
His hairs stood on end, face heating.
He wondered whether Mycroft was still having CCTV feeds around the city monitored and would notice his little brother being utterly spaced-out.

Sherlock had loved the way John had become undone below him, moaning and whimpering as if he were in danger of dying of pleasure. It felt as if he suddenly had magical powers, being able to make John squirm under his touch like that.
Meanwhile, it had become increasingly difficult to keep track of time. But fortunately, two weeks ago, when his mental capacity had still been a lot closer to normal than it was now, he’d been clever enough to set various alarms for today, so that he would end up in the right place at exactly the right moment.
Sherlock clasped his forehead, elbows leaning on the table.
Lestrade’s reaction was slowly threatening to become even more embarrassing than Mrs Hudson’s, who had been harassing them with her smiles and winks and extra food ever since she had caught them kissing in the hallway.
They had all been right. Just a little too soon.
Sherlock reluctantly took his arm from around John and got out of bed to dress. John did the same. They both looked over each other’s bodies, smiling quiet good-byes as bare skin was neatly covered up again by clothing, a glint in both their eyes signalling a silent understanding that they would be together in this bed again as soon as the day’s work was over.
Also, this was definitely not Eurus. Too young, and untalented.
So that was his motive? Wanting to ‘own’ people?
Open-mouthed, Sherrinford took in all the kinds of art materials the shop had, which were for a whole range of different media and techniques besides just oil painting, as he himself had only ever done. He largely ignored the products that were already familiar to him, and focused on the rest, intrigued. He ended up buying a couple of spray cans and template stencils.
With a slight delay, Sherlock hesitantly smiled back.
When Beverly showed them inside, Sherlock’s heart briefly clenched at the palpable absence of the boy. There are few things more personal than a person’s private room – especially a child’s – full of all their beloved things: their dreams and passions pinned to the walls in the form of pictures and posters, teddies that were once gifts from loved ones and hence visibly cuddled to death, cherished purchases from souvenir shops abroad, stickers as rewards for bravery at the doctor’s and dentist’s stuck to the wardrobe doors. On display for all to see, although intended primarily for the room’s occupant himself.
Despite his discomfort, John had to make an effort not to snigger at Sherrinford’s remark. He pinched the bridge of his nose so as not to reveal any of the thoughts going on inside his head.
Once it was inside the bag, she turned it around.
Molly went to sit on the back step of the vehicle, slightly hunched over, clasping her hands in her lap.
everything.
John started when Sherlock sat down next to him, making the mattress shift.
-- This one’s her. SH
The solid strength of John’s arms around him made some of the tension drain out of him.
“Stay here. And sit,” she commanded.
“Because I did,” John choked out in a tiny voice, scrunching up his face.
with John (a choice surely not made lightly, or it would have been made years earlier). This could not ever be allowed to be broken, because that would break Sherlock – and, by proxy, there would be collateral damage to Mycroft’s own heart as well. Luckily, he knew a couple of tricks that could be used to steer events into the desired direction – or, more precisely, away from an undesirable one.
and a
, as his cock was rock-hard again before he knew it. The smooth friction around his shaft was staggering and the encouraging little sounds that John made were driving him crazy – in the best possible way.
What on earth was going to happen from this point? Were they actually in a
(especially John’s, he knew all too well), were often only fleeting.
Now, there had been some sort of plan as to how to get her to do this, but what was it again? He could just ask, right? Nah, boring. Also, why did he not simply phone John?
Inside, a nurse named Eric came to collect them from the central hall and took them into one of the wings of the closed unit, chattering away all the while. About how nice it was that they’d come to visit. About how lovely the weather had been the week before.
When Sherlock eventually pulled back, his face remained close to John’s, hovering above him as their eyes locked. John had drowned in Sherlock’s gaze so often in the past, not capable of reading his intentions, yet unable to look away. It had always felt like they stared straight into one another’s soul, without fully understanding what they saw there, but still being captivated and mesmerised by each other’s hidden depths. But now, John knew exactly what it was he saw in Sherlock’s eyes. And he knew that Sherlock could finally, flawlessly read him as well.
“What’s so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?” John had asked, just after Sherlock had solved the mystery of the son of the Welsboroughs found dead in his car in their own driveway. (Funny, really, how perfectly healthy people sometimes died of suffocation in the least expected of places – albeit fully explicable.)
“Thank you, yeah. It’s not really me, though, I don’t think,” he said.
“I’d like to hear you say it.” Smith smiled fleetingly. “Say it for me, please.”
took care of that.” Sherlock seemed unable to stop smiling, which seemed odd.
“Nice,” John said, overseeing the property. “A bit big, but nice.”
But as he’d started to reach for his coat, there had been footsteps on the stairs. Then, the door had swung open and Mary cheerfully stepped inside, carrying two large shopping bags full of new maternity clothes – even though she was due in only ten days. The woman was a lunatic in so many ways. (Or was she planning to become a smuggler, hiding illegal goods under a fake bump, once the baby had been born, Sherlock briefly wondered?)
thing he’d ever truly wanted, really.
“It would appear so. And yeah, I noticed you’ve been dreaming rather a lot.”
Next, John had taken some outings to Regent’s Park to stretch his legs and help get himself back into shape. Daniel, the agent from downstairs, had accompanied him. Together, they’d also gone to Bronzefield to visit Aunt Vivian in prison twice. Sadly, as John rapidly got better, she rapidly got worse. It broke his heart to realise that she clearly had only a few weeks left to live. Then again, she was on borrowed time already, seeing as they’d given her three months in May, which was four months ago. She was incredibly strong and remained cheerful, but he could tell that her energy was dwindling ever more rapidly.
John decided not to bring up the sibling with Sherlock just yet, now that he was struggling with more urgent matters. But he definitely would, once everything was back to normal. Which was hopefully before autumn set in.
Just in case his big brother was watching, and tracking his steps on the map of London, Sherlock decided to send a message that would get his attention, writing something familiar with the path he chose to walk through various streets.
“Yes. Want to look.”
Almost like a normal household.
“Well, he’s coping, I guess. Still mourning the death of his beloved, of course. But you know Mycroft.” Sherlock pressed his lips together. Then he turned around and smiled at John. “Let’s go to bed. We could use an early night.”
After one or two minutes, John decided to get up and make them some coffee.
Sherlock opened the map of Norway once more over his finished breakfast plate in their B&B in Soknedal. It was starting to show considerable signs of wear and tear by now, as well as a variety of small food and coffee stains from various Norwegian breakfast dishes – like free souvenirs.
After that, he waited. It was vital to intercept and delete the replies before Bob and Violet could read them themselves.
“Having said that,” John continued, “the impression I got was not that of an unhealthy relationship. At all, actually. Although again, that might not say everything. Tea?”
“It’s Molly!” he called back over his shoulder. And then, in a gentle voice, “Molly, do come in. How are you?”
Sherlock had never had this level of attention paid to him before, and it was a mesmerising experience. After having covered the area between Sherlock’s nipples and his navel, leaving a subtle trail of cool damp patches on his skin, John continued to move lower, making Sherlock catch his breath. A moment later, John was lying on his side the other way round, now leaning on his right elbow: with his knees near Sherlock’s right shoulder, his head hovering near Sherlock’s half-hard prick.
to home. One month and counting. Still, it was definitely one of her less stressful assignments. Even though she had to be on standby for possible murderous intruders at all times, carrying her gun in every waking moment, while simultaneously working as a nanny of sorts (which, to be fair, was a task that Sherlock was now taking over from her more and more), the atmosphere was relaxed enough. Almost cosy.
* * * * *
That same afternoon, Sherlock painted her new names onto her bedroom door in sparkly, sea-green, swirly letters, with a mermaid next to it.
“Anyone.”
“Briony and Imogen are being relocated this instant,” Hannah said, barging back into the room.
Hannah’s voice sounded agitated from across the hall as she spoke on the phone. “It must be that woman who you said was my doppelganger, who lives across the street!”
“Screw the top.”
Only minutes before, Sherlock had scared off poor Greg Lestrade, who had dared to call to ask for Sherlock’s view on a recent murder case.
The plan was simple. He needed to get admitted to Smith’s hospital, which would be easy, really, with his current state of health. He was at least well underway in the right direction. He hadn’t really planned to keep up this level of drug use, kept telling himself he would soon quit, but if he needed to crawl further down this pit so he could catch a serial killer, then why not? He could crawl out afterwards. He’d done it before.
The truth had finally emerged, suddenly making the world an entirely different place.
She had been dead for several years now.
Jim would have been so proud.
“She was so smart, and… she always used to help us,” Sherlock said, sounding appropriately taken aback. “With cases. We were always working together, having fun,” he huffed, forcing out a smile. “Like that time we tried to use a bloodhound to trace the burglar smashing the Thatcher busts.” He paused. “She was just wonderful. John loved her so much, you know.”
They both gaped at him. “How the hell did you…?” Greg muttered.
As he brings the pints back to the table where Greg sits waiting, John resolves to leave right after this round. Only this prospect gives him the strength to sit through the rest of their conversation and respond like a proper friend to what Greg says.
Just as he took out his phone, however, it rang.
Hope that she’d leave that boring idiot Watson and come back to her.
Why he bothered to remember such things, he didn’t know.
He was pleading, submissive, and it was an entirely new side of John that Sherlock had never seen before. Sherlock looked at him in wonder: this beautiful, amazing man who wanted to become his husband and who, Sherlock then realised, loved him unconditionally, as it appeared. Each time when Sherlock had doubted John’s love for him, he had turned out to have been wrong, and even though Sherlock had gone and pushed him away more than once, John had not budged or stopped loving him. And now they were going to tie the knot. Forever.
He was nervous, John could see.
John didn’t mind the rain, even though he had no umbrella. In the arid heat of the Afghan deserts he had made a vow never to complain about precipitation ever again in his life. If anything, the typical London drizzle made him feel at home.
“Will he?” Mycroft said, giving John a meaningful look.
He was about to say it wasn’t really a therapist; she had just pretended so as to get close to him. But that would only lead to more questions. And the less people knew, the better. He didn’t want word to get out that Sherlock Holmes was looking for a mysterious, evil woman, who was good at disguises, since all sorts of folks would start muddling the investigation.
Hannah ran the last few metres through the small corridor and arrived in the bedroom only to see John sitting up in bed wide-eyed and a movement of black fabric disappearing through the knocked out window. She leaped over to look outside through the broken glass, but could only hear someone letting themselves fall awkwardly down the garbage bins under an overhang that restricted her view.
Then a deafening silence fell over the room.
John squinted his eyes in disgust, waving his chopsticks in mid-air. “Do people actually do that kind of thing?”
The next day, late in the afternoon, the doorbell to 221B rang in a fashion that indicated urgency, even panic. Sherlock looked up from his magazine and briefly locked eyes with John. Could either be an exciting new case, or a hysterical client who would require John to patiently convince them to leave before Sherlock resorted to less friendly measures to dispose of them.
Overwhelmed with guilt, he closed his eyes.
“Meanwhile, I will be concealed at the other end. I need you to have a clear view of the suspect and hear what they have to say. And don’t worry. I’ve taken measures to ensure that they won’t try to kill me – that is, you – again.”
“Well, you’re a doctor. Examine me,” Sherlock teased, sitting down on the chair again.
She looked down and nodded. “Acceptance of any existing situation is indeed the most healthy response. Although what other people think of you is rarely relevant,” she said. She then scribbled something in her notebook, which John couldn’t read. “So what happened after the hug?”
Hey guys, so sorry for the delay in updating. I really hope that I will be able to write more often again starting next month. I’ve got the entire plot planned until the end, so I just need time to sit and write it all down.
And why was his prick suddenly displaying an opinion, for fuck’s sake? God, this couldn’t get any worse, could it?
“Tea would be lovely, thanks.”
In order to distract himself, Sherlock casually strolled over to his parents, who were now talking with Sherrinford – using Mycroft as an interpreter. At least they now seemed more at ease with the use of sign language, even though they had still learnt too little themselves to actually apply it in any meaningful way. But in some measure they were trying now.
Probably.
filled most of the emptiness for
He bonelessly collapsed on top of Sherlock, resting his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder as he tried to wrap his mind around what they had just done and how utterly glorious it had been.
Irene pushed herself off the bed and checked her new hair in the tiny mirror. Then she walked out of the room and down the stairs.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d celebrated his birthday in the presence of either.
John gave him an open-mouthed smirk and huffed, then shook his head. “You meddlesome busybody of a genius.”
As he continued along the busy streets of London, he considered how it had been Mary’s newly revealed selfishness, dishonesty and cruelty that had made him stop loving and start hating her. Truth be told, Sherlock had also been selfish and dishonest often enough, and sometimes even cruel, but there had always been some higher cause. And you could appreciate the man for at least never having pretended to be anything different. With Sherlock, John had started hating and loving him pretty much at equal pace, he realised.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to his forehead and started rubbing his back, in rhythmic, grounding, soothing strokes.
John very slowly pushed in a bit more, then stopped again, until Sherlock nodded that it was okay to go deeper. Once he was past the first sphincter, he slid in so easily it made him blink.
The morgue.
,” John repeatedly moaned above him.
“I’m so happy for them, you know,” John said, dreamily. “I think they make a great couple.” He shifted a bit so he could fondle Sherlock from a more comfortable angle. “I’ve been
He sighed.
The opposite was true, of course.
John smiled, and set Rosie down on her rug.
At Hopkins’s raised eyebrows, he clarified, “That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there’s hair growing in his ears. So it’s a superficial job, then. But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger. He killed Evans.”
There were ads from brands she didn’t know, fashion trends she hadn’t seen before.
But in this case, that really was false hope getting the better of him, he acknowledged.
In the course of the day, Sherlock established that turning forty wasn’t so bad.
John looked peaceful. Relaxed.
To their shame, they had forgotten to put the presents under the tree the previous night, so they did so during Chloe’s late morning nap, seeing as she wasn’t able to tell the difference just yet, anyway.
. They couldn’t very well have any cleaning ladies walk in on them now.
If John had been unsure about the whole sex-with-Sherlock thing, he had been wrong. It was without any doubt whatsoever the best sex ever. Who needed tits or pussy when you had, well...
John casually closed the distance between them and gently rested his hands on Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock immediately relaxed into his touch, letting his head fall back so John could nuzzle his neck. John then let his hands roam over Sherlock’s belly, with one ending up stroking a nipple and the other one on Sherlock’s undeniably hardening bulge. John teasingly pressed his own now rather blatant erection against Sherlock’s arse, not bothering to suppress a soft moan. They had still never done it in this position and a wave of arousal hit him at the idea of bending his lover over right there at the kitchen table, without even having to get undressed properly. His hands came together at the buckle of Sherlock’s belt and he swiftly undid it while he gently moved against Sherlock’s arse, his prick now impossibly hard.
Then, not bothering to open the noisy waste bin, he very quietly put down the garbage bags, gladly taking the risk that rats would tear them open during the night, and withdrew. He had to make a deliberate effort to regain his neutral face – so as not to raise the attention of any of the guys – as he slipped back into the brightly lit kitchen.
“Excuse me,” James said sheepishly.
Upon Sherlock opening his mouth again, John quickly and efficiently shut him up with a look. Always worked.
No one had ever touched him there before.
-- I’m glad. S
“On what?” John demanded, feeling sick to the bone.
Sherlock moved slowly, carefully, although perhaps a little clumsily. This was his very first time, after all. There was deep concentration on his face, as well as profound ecstasy. Seeing his expression did things to John.
Sherlock felt a strange combination of disappointment and relief. He was disappointed mainly with himself, for being so nervous about something so trite, but very relieved that John actually seemed totally fine with not doing it, at least for now.
was going on here, Molly wondered.
Lost in their mutual stare, John felt his heart overflowing with all the emotions he’d been trying to lock inside, jumbled together with random thoughts, observations and hunches from the past. He had tried so hard not to miss Sherlock that it had hurt. He now slowly felt himself disconnect from all his thoughts and from being
“Excellent, Angelo, truly delicious,” John Watson replied. His partner, the famous Sherlock Holmes (whom Angelo was rather proud to have as one of his regular customers), hummed in agreement.
And wasn’t it much better to wait until that had happened, before they seriously attempted to properly burn Sherlock’s heart out, anyway? Wasn’t it, in fact, much easier to burn the heart out of that stupid, arrogant, posh brat when he actually had his heart
Sherlock’s face was a mask of neutral concentration as he once more fished out his phone and took another couple of pictures of the three items, separately and together, passports opened and closed – laid out on top of the envelope – before picking up the mysterious ball of tape and holding it between his thumb and index finger. He looked at John with raised eyebrows.
“Excellent, yes. Let’s do that,” Sherlock agreed. “What do you think of this hotel? Look,” he pointed at his screen.
The moustached man that entered their room showed signs of both anger and grief. “Good afternoon,” he said politely, clutching his hat in front of his rather voluminous belly. There was sweat on his forehead, despite the relatively cool temperature for June. He had obviously been worried sick for hours, most likely about a child. Also, he was an earl.
to believe me,” he pleaded. “I know- I know lying and deceiving comes easy to me, especially for cases, but I promised you last year that I would always be honest with you in future, and I have been. I am.”
John looked at Mycroft for a moment. “Sherlock’s not your only brother. There’s another one, isn’t there?”
Just before blowing out the candles, he recalled he was supposed to make a wish. But there was nothing left to wish for. He smiled. Everything was perfect just the way it was. So he blew them out just like that, under loud applause.
, wanting to kill
Then he realised Sherlock was talking to him.
They drowned in each other’s gaze for a while, amazed at what they were doing.
these things? Was nobody going to do anything?
Well, and fifty percent of his DNA. Of which Rosie had inherited roughly half again.
Chloe was drowsily sat in front of the telly watching Christmas-themed CBeebies as Sherlock and John silently stirred their cups, with hunched shoulders and half-lidded eyes.
“This dog doesn’t do much, does it?” Mary had said, ten minutes later. “He reminds me of you, John. Lazy and incapable, ha-ha! Not that you’re that much better, mind, Sherlock, but at least you’re good at pretending otherwise, right?” She had obviously thought this a very funny joke and had actually
already, grunting into John’s shoulder, as his movements stuttered to a halt.
Wordlessly, Sherlock took the puppy and instantly cradled it close to his chest.
Hell turned out to be a lovely little place on the southern coast of a river mouth lined with deciduous forests. The sun was only partly visible behind the mostly overcast sky, not dissimilar to the day Rosamund had been in the area, six months ago.
. See their reaction with my own eyes. Do my own damage control, where necessary.”
Once Lestrade and Interpol had been alerted, John and Sherlock numbly remained seated on the wooden bench, staring out at the sea.
“It’s too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you’re going out into the night, with no plan on how you’re getting home... and a gun.”
Sherlock felt a sudden rise of panic. “No, John. Why would we
* * * * *
“Missing child,” Sherlock had lied. “Walked out of his parents’ back garden never to be seen again. Three years old. Had just hurt his knee ten minutes prior, so Toby might be able to trace the scent of his blood.”
Another silence.
There was no point in hanging around here; it was getting dark and there wasn’t any other logical place in or around the school to look for more clues anyway. Sherlock needed to see the boy’s house, Holdernesse Hall, learn more about him and where he came from. But it was too late to go there now,
The training had been hard, but not as hard as some of the things she’d had to do before in her life. Especially not with Briony there, a fellow agent and single mother of a baby daughter who she soon became very close with.
Her relationship with her brother had always been difficult. As kids, their interests had invariably been vastly different, but she’d attributed that to their age difference. When she was in her teddy phase, he was in his Lego phase. When she had her Lego phase, he was in his computer game phase. When she was in her computer game phase, he had his rugby phase.
(No matter they looked more like sheep than like actual cats.)
It was, of course, proper women’s underwear: a plain black set with a narrow lace border.
Btw, if anyone would like to see some pictures of The Britannia Hotel in Trondheim, see this link:
To see his lover flaunt such womanly characteristics had momentarily caused a slight short-circuit in his brain.
“The Louvre can wait. And yes, I’m getting an idea…” Sherlock couldn’t keep from remarking with a cheeky smile.
Sherlock had kept his eyes fixed on their joint hands, not daring to look up. He was very aware that there were things he wanted, and that he thought perhaps John wanted as well, even. But not while he was still officially with Mary. Those things, if they ever came to be at all, would have to wait.
“Ah, you finally managed to escape Ms Prada?” Sherlock smirked. “I’m glad. So where do you work now?”
John helped Mrs Hudson get up and slowly walked her to the front door. A cab was pulling up to the kerb just in the moment they got there.
Of course, he had no way of knowing their history.
And while he had never been one for cuddling and fluff, he found that with Sherlock, what he loved possibly as much as the sex, was just lazily lying entangled on the sofa together, studying the hairs on the other’s neck or the curves of the other’s auricle, or simply feeling each other’s warmth and listening to each other’s breathing. Just being
Oh yeah, something about insurance. So John would know. And Lestrade. In case Sherlock couldn’t get John to help him after all, and he himself ended up, well, dead.
Hannah grabbed her phone and started to type furiously, her jaw set. “I’m letting Mycroft know I’m compromised. There will be some decisions to be made.”
He wanted John,
“Well, I could try to see if I can have my shift end at two. Sarah owes me a favour.”
The sod.
Sherlock gave him a blank stare, clearly not getting the point.
But then it occurred to him. “I know!” Sherlock exclaimed, in the middle of the crime scene they were at.
Well, probably when he’d been in his late teens, as he never mentioned her in any of his major life events, nor hinted at his mum not being there when he was little. And it likely happened in an unexpected manner, purely based on age and John never mentioning any sort of progressive disease he was familiar with from a relative’s or carer’s standpoint.
He loved to taste Sherlock's skin and to see his subtle reactions to each kiss on his body - a slight alteration in breathing, an expressive noise, a suppressed muscle twitch.
But Sherlock went on, “I’m sure his exponentially increased microflora and the gaseous compounds they’ve since produced can tell us something about the time and location of death. Bound to be interesting. Especially if you’re in for a nice smell.” For good measure, he’d flashed one of his intimidating grins.
As they kissed, frantically trying to make up for all the time that these feelings had remained unspoken, their arms wrapped tightly around one another, determined to never ever
“Now, it’s a... it’s a new kind of breakfast cereal,” Smith said to the flock of reporters, walking along.
“Sherlock is still not answering his phone,” she said, restlessly.
* * * * *
“So what will happen when we land?”
“Love and attraction are two different things, John.”
So John had smirked right back, and had then started to organise it.
Sherlock imagined future use of BSL during stakeouts, scuba diving sessions or simply for normal conversation in a couple of decades, when they would both be old and hard of hearing (and keeping bees in the garden of a nice little cottage in Sussex, although admittedly, the details of that plan hadn’t yet been discussed).
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock turned to face her.
As Molly stared at the landscape passing by, her thoughts kept turning around in circles about this whole operation and the reason for it (poor John!).
He trailed John’s lips with his tongue, the lips that had just spoken those words. He then moved on to John’s jawline, planting kisses along it, just because he could. When he arrived at John’s earlobe, he softly kissed that, too, before going back to his mouth.
And except when she had been moved to the infirmary, which had not been very nice at all. But still, a new experience. And a necessary one. Her body was slowly losing the fight against cancer, needing more support and more medicine by the day. Painkillers, foremost.
Nevertheless, Sherlock was elated to see his... his... John. He smiled.
Sherlock let out a derisive grunt. “I want to look into Thompson’s so-called alibi first. It doesn’t make sense.” The greengrocer who had been found dead, strangled, behind his own shop had had a long-standing feud with his neighbour, who had repeatedly tried, and failed, to expand his business by buying the adjacent property. So this Thompson had certainly had a motive and Sherlock had found the rope that had been used as a murder weapon (covered in the victim’s skin cells) hidden inside a pillow case at the bottom of Thompson’s laundry basket. Sherlock’s brain was now quickly starting to present possible circumstances which might have given the man an opportunity to create such a fake alibi. “You start looking into the supplier though. I would still like to know what reason she had to have ten kilos of acetamiprid in stock.”
With thanks to camillo1978 for providing the inspiration for an important plot twist in this chapter!
When Sherlock shifted his position to reach for his phone when it chimed with a text alert, thereby robbing John of his headrest, John realised how drowsy he was. Time to go home. They didn’t actually live together yet, after all.
Trembling, he collapsed on top of John. He buried his face in John’s neck as he tried to catch his breath, holding on to his lover (fiancé) for dear life.
John stepped across to the chair by the door and picked up his walking cane. Turning back to the bed, he held it up. “So how… how does it open?”
No, it couldn’t be John. He was smiling now. Bad teeth. Not John.
“Alright.” The sooner this was over, whatever this was, the sooner he would be able to get Sherlock back into his hospital bed, where he belonged.
But he didn’t.
Sherlock nodded. “I just... wondered how things were going and... and if there was anything I could do.”
Sherlock blinked, trying to recall the story exactly as they’d made it up just two hours prior.
This. This was an image Sherlock would remember forever.
Looking awkward, Molly reached into the pocket of her trousers and then held out an envelope. “It’s, er, it’s from John.”
“That’s very kind of you, Mrs Hudson, but he’s not here. He’ll be back in about half an hour.”
Cursing his bad luck, he wallowed in his frustration and self-pity for a while. It had been easier to accept his fate when he’d still been in hospital. Back home, it was weird being an invalid.
Sherlock trembled as he removed his fingers once more, and positioned himself closer to John. He swallowed.
?” John went over to look at the drip bag.
the possibility that anything like this could actually happen. I honestly never...” His voice had been barely audible at those last words, until it died away altogether.
He felt at least twenty years younger, and all his troubles concerning Mary seemed to have melted away in the warmth now filling his heart. For the first time in months, he had something to look forward to again.
“She’s smart and confident and that’s why you were attracted to her. No reason to beat yourself up over that. If anything, I should have seen it. But I didn’t, either. She’s clever, John. It’s not your fault.”
He spent almost half an hour sitting in front of a painting of the sea, just staring at it.
“John! Rosie,” Sherlock breathed, hugging the both of them. “Thank god you’re fine. What
“Well…,” he said, hesitantly, “I wanted to ask you something.”
She pulled up the other chair and sat. “Well… Six months ago, a man called Evans was murdered. He was shot from a distance of three hundred metres with this rifle.” She took a stack of pictures from a large envelope and showed him the top one, which he briefly glanced at from the corner of his eyes. “There are three suspects, all brothers. Nathan Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.” She laid out three photographs of the men on the bed.
all the while as well. This Eurus woman, mainly, and Mary of course; making me question everything I knew. And the cherry on top of all this is, I’ve been having all these totally bizarre, really intense dreams here in the hospital.” He put a hand over his eyes, suddenly feeling overwhelmed with despair. “What I’m trying to say is, I just don’t know what’s real anymore. Whether I can trust my own memories.” He looked helplessly at Sherlock.
John smiled in spite of himself, and for one ridiculous moment, Greg seemed about to shake their hands to congratulate them; then, realising this would probably be a bit of an odd thing to do, he settled for shaking just his own head in disbelief, barely able to contain his joy.
Janine carefully cupped her hands around the hot mug, letting the wonderful warmth seep into her cold fingers. “Now
Just take off the saintly ‘st’ from ‘Morstan’ and you had the most deadly assistant to the most dangerous criminal in the country. Hiding in plain sight.
“Okay. Well? How?”
Grinning, John let out a shaky breath. He had been inside his lover and he felt he would be unable to stop smiling for the next year or so.
at the least; why would suddenly every minute count
(Well, certainly the BBC had seen no reason to stop this scenario from unfolding – more than once.)
“As you’re… well… probably more of a lady’s man after all.” Sherlock swallowed, not quite knowing where to look.
“I… I’m sorry,” he said, before turning and leaving, his posture like that of a puppet whose main supporting wire had snapped.
At least they then knew for certain that she had a partner in crime – as the robbery had unquestionably been committed by two people – although they still didn’t know more than his approximate height and the fact that it was a man owning a balaclava helmet, which had all been rather bloody disappointing at the time.
Sherlock looked shyly at the floor, cursing himself for blushing like a kid. Then again, John was blushing as well and it only added to his attractiveness. Good Lord.
Sherlock let himself smile back at her, and, as they did a little eyebrow dance at each other, they both knew she knew exactly what they’d just done.
“Right. Sorry. I’ll go.” He looked at his alarm clock. It was 7 pm.
“I’m just not, and that’s that. I’m going with you. Also, I need the fresh air. I’ve been locked inside for almost a month. It’s starting to drive me mad.”
“We used to be so close. The three of us.” Sherlock swallowed. It was essential that he got this right. Of all the times throughout his life he’d had to give it his all, this was the one time he needed to get it one-hundred-percent-right. For John.
Yes, he did love Sherlock. Avidly.
“No headache?” Sherlock checked.
Nice.
“I don’t know.”
“How long?” Sherlock asked.
“I just wanted to bring you some casserole leftovers,” Mrs Hudson spoke through the closed door, articulating clearly.
“What?” Sherlock and Mrs Hudson spoke simultaneously.
Just a few more minutes, Sherlock thought. Just a few more minutes, and then it would either be plan A or plan B. He’d located all the necessary items for the second plan, if the first failed.
.” He gritted his teeth and looked away.
John widened his eyes, not fully comprehending. His frown stayed put.
In one crazy moment, the thought ‘
“Excellent idea.”
When he woke up, Sherlock found the other half of the bed empty. Of course; it was a Monday and John had a shift at the surgery. Bugger. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed, feeling rather silly when he noticed he was still wearing his lace underwear. He smiled nevertheless as he took it off. He had been a complete fool, it appeared, both to initially have extrapolated their future from the first few weeks and then later to think that it would continuously keep going downhill once they were in a quieter phase. On the one hand, he wished he’d had a bit more relationship experience, but on the other hand, the idea of ever being with anyone else but John was quite preposterous and not worth considering in any universe.
John was surprised to get to know a different side to Mycroft as well. There was something decidedly meek about him in the presence of his parents – or perhaps there were simply other things on his mind, which caused him to react with less vigour and sarcasm than usual. Maybe he missed Marcus all the more in settings like these. Mycroft had, of course, never had the opportunity to bring the man he’d loved to any such family gathering, John realised, and was perhaps a little envious of the fact that his youngest brother now could.
Lamentably but inevitably, this would without doubt be the last time, however.
“Good. Excellent,” the earl said, with a relieved nod.
Thankfully, John seemed to forgive his idiocy quite easily. And thankfully, Sherlock was usually a quick learner.
“Sherlock, I want you, all of you. I really,
“Because I’ll tell you something, John Watson,” she continued. “You will not have me.”
. About how they were. About how lovely the memorial service had been. And also about what their favourite memories of Aunt Viv were.
He instinctively took a few steps towards Sherlock, who to his astonishment (
” before resting his eyes on him and falling to John’s feet.
God, he feels like an arse.
He put Rosie down in her play corner in the lounge and went to the kitchen to heat the water for her formula. As he did so, it occurred to him that this evening, he should probably write some made-up blog post about how Sherlock had almost gotten himself killed again, but keeping in line with their ‘estranged’ façade. It was bad enough that Lestrade and Hopkins had witnessed John’s old cane being in Sherlock’s hospital room, so he would have to make up some story as to how it got there. And maybe he could include the wife he was supposedly still mourning by writing that Mary had given him advice via posthumous DVD or something, perhaps addressed to Sherlock and finding John by accident. He chuckled. He should really take up fiction writing, seeing how much he enjoyed making stuff up lately.
What did this mean? What would happen now?
He smiled an awkward smile at the man lying below him, being all charming even in this state.
When the hands and mouth abruptly disappeared, Sherlock blinked his eyes open to see John hastily unbuttoning his chequered shirt, his fingers faintly trembling. “God, it’s suddenly hot in here, isn’t it?” John muttered with an apologetic grin. Sherlock only bit back a smile as he waited to see John’s bare chest.
Rather than going up both flights of stairs, to get his cane – which he knew was still standing in a corner inside the wardrobe up in his old room – he entered the living room first.
Was this truly what it would be like from now on? By each other’s side, day and night? The hours of darkness spent together in the same bed, sharing each other’s warmth? Not feeling alone anymore? Or jealous of John’s dates? Ever?
John felt a chill run down his spine. “Mary Morstan,” he muttered, reading the fake name next to the familiar photo.
“Good heavens!” John exclaimed, with a half-chuckle. “Of course
Strange. It hurt, even though he knew it was fake.
“Hospital?” John asked.
But he shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t.
He considered going into the bathroom to tell John. However, he’d already started typing in the search field, to find more information on Twitter, before even consciously deciding to. Within seconds, he found a short news item about the court case, listing all the crimes she had been found guilty of.
The first time they’d used their mouths on each other had been nothing short of earth-shattering.
have you gotten into your head?”
,” he sighed. “And then we will all be out of this imbroglio.”
Putting down the paper and her mug in one fluid, quick, noiseless motion, she got up, simultaneously pressing the emergency button on her pager to alert Daniel, on guard downstairs. The next moment, she was in the corridor, gun drawn and pointing upwards.
“I think they call it ‘demisexual’,” Sherlock said.
’, because of the way Eurus used to prey on my weak spot, back when she was just a random kid in our street.” He blindly stared at his mug in silence.
“So you don’t want to do it?” Sherlock asked, unsure.
“I need an excuse to go chitchat with one particular goldsmith and didn’t have any suitable brooches or earrings myself that needed mending,” Sherlock smiled cheekily. “That’s why.”
Sometimes, they made love. Each time, before entering him, John would ask, “Are you sure?” and Sherlock loved him a little more. No one before had ever cared what he wanted or what he felt.
Like that time Sherlock had texted him at 4am to ask the chemical notation of aspirin.
“I’ll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.” And then, “No!” followed by a loud, furious “
Although things could never be the same as long as there still was a Moriarty on the loose.
“What’s what?”
“Yes: the name of the person my father wanted to kill.”
me.” He looked at John with something of surprise on his face. “Even though his approach in doing so was utterly stupid and obviously didn’t work at all. He probably meant well.” Sherlock frowned. “I’ve never allowed myself to really, properly think about his side of things.”
The culprit succeeded in getting up, though, and resuming his flight faster than John could get proper hold of him.
Although he looked apprehensive, there was no trace of discomfort in his expression. It was more like awe.
They would have to stick it out for a couple of days. Ah well. It would be over soon enough, and then the calm would return. Proper calm.
Sherlock tore his eyes away from the couple to look at John. Did he disapprove? Or was he just joking? No, he was decidedly beaming and Sherlock bit his lips to hide a smile.
However, the moment she started acting, a veil of shyness once more fell over her. Not for long, though. It was part of the act, building up towards an entirely different kind of energy.
Sometimes, he felt so much anger that it nearly suffocated him. He looked at strangers outside and bitterly wondered what they had on their conscience. No rapist ever looked like a rapist, did they? These bastards could be everywhere – and so could their victims, for that matter, for they were just as invisible. John honestly didn’t know what he would have done if that teacher of Sherlock’s had still been alive. It was probably a good thing that he wasn’t.
“Well, it’s her wife’s, of course.”
Why did these outrageous thoughts keep forcing themselves upon him at every turn, when there was no use, anyway?
He would also never have given Sherlock tender kisses on his cheek, but he does now.
Although finding the pearl was brilliant, of course, the other things John had found (and left) in Norway were of infinitely greater value. There was Chloe’s new name, and the resolution to arrange official parental responsibility for Sherlock – if he should want it. But also the realisation that – now that they had been properly together for a while – Sherlock had still not stopped loving him, or Chloe, and it didn’t look as if he ever would.
. “Then she stole my suitcase full of clothes and fled to California, of all places.”
They stood there together, laughing, until they were out of breath.

John felt his face crinkle again. “Yes. Very happy.”
, to eliminate the risk of the rest of the plethora of possible diseases spreading.
EDIT 16 September: I've got 39 planned now, LOL.
Either way, the man Sherlock had come face to face with over a broken politician’s bust in Reading had been an unexpected individual indeed. Certainly not a Moriarty, no matter how good he might have been with disguises. Seeing as the man had been wearing a necklace with the letters ‘A’ and ‘J’ dangling from it in thick gold, Sherlock had from there on referred to him as “AJ”. His real name had later turned out to be Amit Joachim, and he’d never wanted revenge on Mary at all, of course. They were the best of pals. It wasn’t until he’d gotten shot in Morocco and his fingerprints were entered into the system that they’d started to get a glimpse of what he and Mary had been up to in the recent past. Versatile, indeed.
He felt intensely contented, watching Rosie splash around with her rubber duck without a care in the world, while he washed her delightfully soft, fluffy baby hair himself again for the first time since July.
“Well, I think it would be a tad odd, to bring him to such an intimate setting as
The results page on her screen showed photographs of Smith, with links to a couple of books he’d written. One was apparently called ‘How to Make a Killing’ and the other ‘Business Killer’. Under the header ‘Latest News’ there was an item headlined, in speech marks, ‘“He’s a serial killer!”’ and underneath, it said, ‘Net detective blasts Culverton Smith on Twitter’.
John was now bucking back up against his hand, apparently trying to make him reach deeper. Sherlock tried to accommodate him as best as he could. After only a few minutes, John was already so open, so relaxed. Maybe Sherlock could already...?
The sound of breaking twigs quickly grew louder as Sherlock clambered his way to John through the undergrowth, a hint of pride in his eyes at the fact that his partner had apparently found an important clue. When he kneeled to take a look at the box, he drew in a long breath that subsequently seemed to freeze him on the spot. “Did you touch it in any way?” he asked abruptly.
“Well,” John sighed with a fond smile, “I’m basically knackered –
“Okay, I got it wrong, then. It wasn’t only one word; it can’t have been,” Faith said.
“Oh! That would be lovely, yes. It would make three visits in four months. Bad for the environment and all,” she chuckled, “but I’ll consider it.”
Somewhat awkwardly, Molly attempted a smile and stepped over some scattered building blocks to the corner where Rosie was playing with a plush octopus and what seemed to be a merman doll. “Hello Rosie,” she said, kneeling down next to her. “You were expecting someone else, weren’t you? But your daddy couldn’t come, so they asked me to pick you up.”
“Oh, we’re on a case with Missing Persons. But are you trying to tell me that you’ve… found someone
When James was safely out of hearing distance, Sherlock said to John, “Never hurts to make some friends among the local workmen.”
She briefly squeezed her eyes shut and ran over the order of Things To Be Done in her head. Although she felt relatively at home in 221B by now, after five weeks of living with the boys, she hadn’t yet reached the stage where she kept her sanitary pads in the shared bathroom.
He wiggled his head around a bit.
Ever since that first time, he felt strangely proud.
let go again.
“Yes, you are very cute together,” she said around her gum, her voice shrill. “Tell me, why have you two still not had sex?”
* * * * *
Greg then turned to Sherlock, who was now sitting up respectably on the sofa next to John, and he frowned, incredulous. “Wait, are you
See, he thought he had a pretty good reason either way. He’d cocked it all up, and he would never be good enough for John anyway. There just was no point in trying.
Sherlock no longer felt his too-tight, heeled shoes as he walked through the corridor of the theatre. Rather, it felt like he was floating on a cloud, gliding effortlessly, as in a dream.
to John in a way he hadn’t experienced before. In the exactly hundred days he’d been with John, Sherlock had determined, finally, that sex was not about taking but about giving. But that wasn’t true either, really. As he moved inside of John, with more care and gentleness than he’d ever known was in him, he realised that good sex was, more than anything, about
Greg promptly received confirmation of that by Sherlock’s panting “John, oh... yes... please...”
John had to look twice at the person approaching them through the middle aisle: he passed as well as a woman as Sherlock did. “I was wondering if you were still taking new members,” Sherlock said with a radiant smile. John thought he actually saw a hint of admiration flicker across the other man’s face at Sherlock’s voice confirming that he was, in fact, a man. “For
She was capable of
There was an electricity between them – the way they looked at each other every time Sherlock opened his eyes – that was mesmerising even to him as an outsider. It showed a mutual admiration so intense, it was almost palpable across the fibreglass network the stream was channelled through. Seeing his brother being given a tour through heaven by the good doctor made Mycroft feel both slightly sick and embarrassingly envious at the same time. When John started positively teasing Sherlock and making him coil and squirm against the backrest of the sofa – swirling just the tip of his tongue along the underside of Sherlock's glans, excruciatingly slowly – Mycroft had to look away again.
Breathlessly, Sherlock replied, “Suffocating me, overdosing me.” He pointed weakly towards the drug stand.
The earl vaguely nodded, dumbstruck.
John tried to wrap his brain around all these new facts. Had they literally been dancing around each other for years,
Not looking at him, but giving a short nod all the same, the Ice Man disappeared.
“And then, of course,” Sherlock went on, “there was the way they handled the situation after Redbeard was killed. I don’t really want to go into all that now,” Sherlock sighed, “and I really don't blame them for thinking Sherrinford did it on purpose, because that’s not the point. That wasn’t perhaps so much their fault, considering the way Nanny Forsyth had related to them what she thought she’d seen, and considering his previous behaviour.” He briefly closed his eyes. “But the fact that they never talked with me about what had happened, how I missed my dog, who was my closest companion at the time… and they simply pretended it had never happened, making it seem almost like we'd never had another brother… or a dog… That is something I find very hard to comprehend and accept.”
was why this Hannah woman was here. Apparently John and Rosie were staying here?
Fuming, Eurus stared at her laptop screen displaying John’s blog.
Then, to John, “Either he was allowed to pack, or he left by himself.”
In spite of them living practically on a cloud, though, this sadly only went for as long as they remained safely inside the confines of 221B. Now that other stress factors had fallen away, it became increasingly clear that John’s mental state regarding his trust issues was sub-optimal, to say the least. Even though there was no longer any threat, he was still extremely stressed and paranoid as soon as he left the flat, leading to a state of anxiety that lasted several hours after returning home each time.
Suddenly, everything felt simple again. John was here and hugging him back. Soon, their mouths found each other and a minute later, they were passionately kissing, snogging properly for the first time and pressing their bodies together without restraint.
Every few seconds, Sherlock stopped, sometimes pulling out a little, then pushing back in.
After a moment, John lowered his phone and terminated the call.
“Right.” John nodded, staring down at his hands. “It’s alright. I’m sorry.” He looked up at Sherlock. “So that means we can’t see each other for a while, then.”
“I’m sorry, John. It’s just… lying can become rather tricky, when you have to do it for ninety minutes straight.” Sherlock didn't know where to look, afraid to see the disappointment in John’s face.
Mrs Hudson sighed. “Well, yes. It must be old age, mustn’t it? I couldn’t keep escaping it forever. Ever since that ear infection in May my health has just been sliding downhill like an Olympic alpine skier.”
EDIT 25 Oct. 2019: It's incredibly funny how I kept thinking there were only around five chapters left to write for *ages*, but then I kept splitting the new draft chapters in two as I wrote them, seeing as they turned out to become much too long each bloody time. At the time I'm writing this comment, I'm pretty sure there will be 40 chapters in total. But who knows... ;)
That evening, after an early supper, as Sherlock was putting the leftovers in the fridge, John walked up to him and hugged him from behind. “I think
He forgot to breathe for a few seconds as he let the words echo in his mind. John loved him. Sherlock wasn’t even sure what that meant, exactly. But once his brain stopped trying to wrap itself around this new piece of information, a relieved smile involuntarily started to spread over his face.
Little Jimmy.
“So,” John grinned, beaming and not quite knowing where to look. “Here we are, then.” It felt ridiculous just sitting here, on separate chairs, when he wanted to hold Sherlock and kiss him and repeat that he loved him a hundred times over at least.
Sherlock grabbed at Smith’s lower right arm and flailed weakly with his other hand, trying to dislodge him. He failed. He didn’t have enough strength, not enough energy…
* * * * *
to happen once they finally came to their senses. Which, apparently, they had done, at long last!
They passed through a blue-painted corridor with a high ceiling and pipework running along it.
Sherlock casually looks away to something on the side table, as he pushes his tongue against one cheek.
Apparently, he’d closed his eyes at this point. Which shot wide open when John turned out to be smearing lubricant all over the condom as he dopily grinned up at Sherlock, enticingly biting his lip.
Through his evolving relationship with John, Sherlock changed. And to his own surprise, he was happily aware of it. The effect that John had been having on him ever since they met, of making Sherlock want to be a better person, kinder, and less closed off to other people, was now accelerated through their increased intimacy.
John had seemed so upset when he woke up, believing that Sherlock had lied to him about having a dangerous sister. About Sherlock apparently even choosing to save her over him.
John shifted his weight from one foot to the other. This was without doubt the most disturbing thing he had ever heard anyone say. He was beginning to realise why Sherlock was obsessed with this man. Something was definitely not right here. It just remained to be seen
With many thanks to Mamaorion, who beta’d this chapter for me as a last minute sick-replacement.
Memory. Often coming back. No use trying to forget.
“I’m still deciding,” he’d replied, “whether or not to protest this initiative.”
It was midnight before Violet’s reply finally arrived.
John looked up from his only half-finished plate at the kitchen table.
“Excellent,” Sherlock whispered, secretly a little grateful to DI Hopkins for giving him something else to focus on, even if just for a few minutes. “Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he’s dumped the specs,” he continued. “Even has a spray tan. But he’s clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.”
There was a reason he got on with her. She wasn’t as stupid as most people.
“Vivian Norbury. A Robert Jones to visit you,” the warder’s voice suddenly said.
“Here’s your next dose of buprenorphine and Xanax,” John said, shaking two pills from separate bottles onto his palm. He closed his fingers around them, however, before Sherlock could take them, and looked him in the eye. “Please,
” John looked like he’d eaten a whole lemon. “What in Heaven’s name gave you
“You invited her.” Sherlock smiled tightly at him. “Ah, let’s see if I can recall. ‘
With small blond man.
“Er... Condom?” John whispered.
God, the feeling of holding Sherlock, warm and real against his chest, and the way they had just stood there, breathing together with their arms around each other: it had been absolutely wonderful and slightly terrifying at the same time. But the best thing had been Sherlock’s joyous shyness and his flushed face with downcast eyes the next morning.
His feeling of relief made no sense.
“Know what? I think we both need another pint,” John offers, glad for an excuse to get up from their table.
He considered phoning Mycroft, loathe as he usually was to do so. But desperate times called for desperate measures.
Next, Sherlock let the sex toy slide all the way out, only to push it back in again. Slowly, but impressively deep.
The fragility of the precious interaction he had been witnessing triggered Mycroft’s mind to present various worrisome scenarios, each of which urgently demanded a counter-plan. If Sherlock ever lost what he now had with John, it would devastate him – to put it very mildly. It was the typical cruelty of life to create something this terrifyingly beautiful and then take it away again.
“I’m looking for Westminster Abbey,” the lady said, “which is supposed to be near here. Do you happen to know the way?”
At the same time, he had
She smiled at him sympathetically. “John,” she said, hesitantly, “you do need some sort of therapy, though, I should think. You need to work through this, somehow. I’m kind of afraid… you know… that rest alone isn’t going to do the trick, know what I mean?”
“Are you serious? I mean, are you
It was as if their newfound form of intimacy had unleashed a heightened and more uninhibited sort of attraction between them, Sherlock thought.
It didn’t sound like a dropped drinking glass. It sounded like a broken window pane.
He opened Air Canada’s website on his phone browser, searching for international flights that had left from Toronto Pearson within the last twelve hours, in order to look for any flights currently underway to Finland or a nearby European destination where she might have to stop over for Helsinki. “Oh. That’s nice,” he said calmly, as he scrolled his screen. “Try to tell me more about the plane.”
What followed was a frantic search for canvases on which his brother had painted other well-known parts of the world: Sydney Harbour, Macchu Piccu, the pyramids of Egypt. He held them up at his little brother, and Sherlock shook his head at each of them, feeling the lump in his throat grow.
John stepped closer to him with his hands behind his back. “So this is real? You’ve really lost it. You’re actually out of control.”
-- A month? J
Thankfully, this one didn’t start mindlessly chattering, but left as quickly as she’d come.
John went still and cupped Sherlock’s jaw with his hand. “I am. But, look. I love you,” he whispered. “And I don’t want to hurt you. So this makes me a bit nervous. Promise you’ll tell me if it’s hurting, okay? Because I don’t want that, and we’ll stop right away. You’ve got to promise.”
“Exactly what the abductor wants you to think. This is a planted clue. The box is not wet enough to have been here since Monday night and also, it smells of litter. Who would ever keep carrying around empty medicine boxes anyway?” He smiled. The hound had finally found a trail.
As much as Greg wanted to slam the door closed and leave, he just didn’t seem able to tear his eyes away from the pair of lovers. There was something almost magical about seeing them like this: John moving so very smoothly (the bastard was pretty damn good at this, he could tell) and Sherlock producing the most exquisite primordial little sounds from his throat in response.
Break-time was over.
“Good morning,” Arnold signed, once they were in Sherrinford’s room.
“Sherlock, I need to choose a recipe for Christmas dinner. What’s more, I have to
Sherlock swallowed and nodded. “Yes. I’m more sure than I’ve ever been of anything in my life, and I think that’s saying something,” he said, with a small smirk. He reached for the small plastic bottle of lube in the back of the drawer of his bedside table. “I bought this a while ago.”
Sherlock loved it when John undressed him, especially if it meant he was being impatient, like now.
Then it dawned on John. Ally…
Then, a strange thing happened.
“At an art gallery, believe it or not. I was so done with the world of publishing.”
“Not before you send someone over there to guard Sherlock.”
“These are not
Sherlock stupidly gaped at the two of them, holding Chloe close to his chest.
“Jolly good,” Mr Holmes said. “So how does this sign language phenomenon work, then?” he asked. “I’ve never quite understood.”
John obliged.
“Come back in ten,” Smith replied, grimly.
“Yes. But he was never able to learn sign language, or lip reading. Or any other form of communication with others, except the occasional drawing he used to make in his notebook to tell Mummy what it was he wanted. His limited mental capacities presented another difficulty. That, combined with the impressive tempers he used to display…”
By the time they had checked into the hotel and were finally up in their room with all their bags and a cot from reception, though, it had become dark – even though it was still only 4:15 pm.
A pained expression came over John’s face and he briefly looked away. “Well, as you know, she lives in Russia now.” He swallowed, visibly sad. “I haven’t seen her in… ages. She doesn’t come back to the UK very often.” Then he smiled and put a hand on Vivian’s bony knuckles. “But I spoke to her yesterday. She sends all her love.”
“I never read anything about any memory stick in that case file,” Donovan said, sceptically.
“The boys from the café.”
And Mycroft was already taking Sherrinford home to their parents, so they weren’t obliged to go and take him.
But Rose hadn’t wanted to listen to her. And the next few weeks, nothing had happened.
The direct order worked. Like a good little puppy, suddenly looking very small and cute, Sherlock walked straight towards him, albeit very slowly, his eyes still uncertain but no longer looking everywhere but at John.
It was as if he’d travelled back in time, all his later achievements gone. They didn’t matter in this house. Only his father occasionally asked about Sherlock’s current life, what he’d been up to, how things were in London. But to his mother, nothing outside her direct sphere of observation seemed to be of any relevance whatsoever. Well, she did
They both got out of the car, and, as if they’d been lifelong friends, together they started unloading various bags, all sorts of baby stuff (a baby bath, changing mat, bouncer chair) and the baby from the car.
The Light Vases mentioned in this story are from artist
Sherlock led the way, repeatedly looking over his shoulder as if to check this was real. (Why did being in love mean you had to behave like a five-year-old again, he wondered?)
With considerable effort, Sherlock opened his eyes. He had no idea where he was, and only the vaguest memory of the past twenty-four hours.
* * * * *
Sherlock gazed into the distance, considering.
Sherlock pulled up a chair, seeing as he had no other plans anyway. As Mrs Hudson filled the kettle and put a tea bag in a flowery mug, she chattered about the cake she was baking and how she hoped it turned out better than the last recipe she’d gotten from Mrs Turner. “I’ve decided to replace the sugar with honey though. You see, I was at this country fair with my sister two weeks ago, in Barnet, and they had the loveliest flower stalls there that you’ve ever seen, and beautiful crafts of all sorts of things made from straw – the shiny, golden type, you know – but they also had a stand where they were selling honey, you see. And the ladies that were selling the honey told me all about its antibacterial properties. And antifungal too. It works against lots of things! It’s very healthy, really. So now at least we can feel a bit less guilty when we eat the cake.” She chuckled.
The old man grunted, meanwhile fumbling with the receipt he was about to write for the brooch, and went on to mention that Bob had also muttered something about protecting the girl, which hadn’t made any sense to him.
Sherlock chuckled. “Shall we ask her, then?”
Chloe, indifferent, had already shifted her focus, reaching her arms out to Sherlock in order to move over onto his lap. “Mummy! Mummy!” she repeated, nestling herself in Sherlock’s arms.
Suddenly, as Sherlock looked at John holding on to a lamp post in his wig and leather boots and jacket, he couldn’t help bursting out laughing. “You look like you’re absolutely plastered!”
* * * * *
“Where are we going now?” Sherlock asked.
He hadn’t quite meant to say it the
, then they were more even than he could have known.
Sherlock looked bemused while John couldn’t help but smile, and he quickly looked down at his noodles, poking at them before he took another bite.
The youth looked at him with sad eyes with bags underneath. “Yeah, sure.”
He could hear John tossing off faster now, and Sherlock slowly realised that the accompanying slick sound was John using Sherlock’s semen as lube, which ignited a surge of fresh arousal in him in spite of his spent state.
, as well as my wonderful betas!!
Sherlock hurried down his ladder and ran to the main entrance at the front of the manor, pressing fast dial on his phone to contact the local police and succinctly asking them for assistance while he sprinted across the lawn. The older maid was about to stop him as he barged into the Hall, but he got rid of his disguise as he insisted on being let through and she gave in, eyes wide in shock. The earl appeared around the corner of the central hallway to see what was going on.
Sherlock thought back to all the hours he’d spent shadowing this guy while trying to dismantle Jim’s network (before erroneously concluding he was not involved), and something started to nag at the back of his mind. The androgynous-looking, genderqueer brother, who he’d never seen interacting with any friends or relatives. No sister in sight.
Shit. “Well… the other day, she kept going on about how she loved Sherlock’s deerstalker hat.” He smiled sheepishly. He should really stop pulling random stuff out of his arse like this. Just stick to the lies he couldn’t avoid; keep in line with what he’d already written on his blog.
Besides that, he was especially relieved that she hadn’t brought up Aunt Viv. They’d obviously lost touch and she had no idea their aunt was in prison. And John had simply not dared take the risk of telling her, and Harry then creating an uproar trying to prove Vivian’s innocence. And he wasn’t ready to let her in on a truth that only he, Sherlock and Mycroft knew, either.
“Oh, you had such a perfect little life. A nice family, a friend you always walked home with. What was his name again? You were inseparable. But I wanted to play too.”
“Safest place to hide,” Sherlock said, unable to take his eyes off Smith. “Plain sight.”
“No.”
But nevertheless, Sherrinford did seem to comprehend the general message. That a huge misunderstanding was being set right. And perhaps, even, that they were asking his forgiveness.
?” He’s not upset, exactly, seeing as the outcome is what it is. At least not
He looked at her beautiful little face, at her disproportionately long eyelashes.
“1982, when I was thirteen. Oh, I see your point there. That was the year after.”
“Yeah, I know, he mentioned it, which is why I came all the way here to hand him these personally.” He smiled a bit more to placate her. “It will only take two minutes,” he added reassuringly.
Sherlock quickly opened his eyes and sat up straight. He ran a hand through his hair and went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.
“Culverton’s doing a visit,” she said. “The kids would love to meet you both. I think he sort of promised.”
“Now that we know who she is and what she can do, it’s only a matter of time before we’ll finally catch her, of course.”
“So… How are Mummy and Daddy holding up with having a baby and an armed secret agent in the house, then?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock reluctantly turned back to him and let John put his arms around him.
Thank God for plan A. This was just plan B, anyway.
“You alright?” Sherlock’s low voice softly rumbled in his ear.
“Well,” John said, when they decided to call it a day and head back to the hotel for the night, “she probably wouldn’t have travelled so far up north from here onwards if she had hidden it in the first village she arrived at.”
John slowly sank to his knees, carefully putting down the gun he’d just fired on the floor in front of him, and hid his face. Sherlock tentatively stepped closer to him and put an arm around him as he kneeled too, letting his head hang next to John’s. “It’s okay. You had no choice. She would undoubtedly have killed Vivian, if you hadn’t acted so quickly. You did the right thing,” he said softly.
Hopefully this chapter partly makes up for some of the angst in the previous one...
Sherlock suddenly standing next to him at window, looking at him, then signing, “I want to ask something. You like to live in other house? Not far from here? Especially for deaf people?” He studied him for a moment. “There, everyone uses sign language. You want to go look tomorrow? Decide after?”
any longer? We’ve waited long enough. Don’t you... want this?”
Sherlock was bent over the desk, one cheek pressed to the wooden surface, his trousers half-way down his thighs, just like those of John, who was standing behind him, firmly gripping Sherlock’s hips and steadily pumping into him – head thrown back and eyes squeezed shut in delight.
Although the experiment had been a rather efficient form of distraction, it could never fill the gaping hole that was John’s absence.
But despite Sherlock’s intention to finally act upon his feelings once Mary was removed from the equation, he now realised he was simply too afraid to get it wrong.
Sherlock writhed in the sheets like a content cat, wallowing in the compliment.
, who had always seemed an open book to him? It was a tantalising mystery.
Despite the serious nature of their quest, Sherlock had to admit he’d secretly loved every minute of it. This ‘case of all cases’ had simply once more proven John to be his indispensable other half. It was as if they both viewed the world from a different angle, making their joint image near-perfect and complete – as long as they communicated seamlessly at all times, which they had now thankfully become rather good at.
. Pure fiction. Utterly unsuitable for his blog. But
Sherlock continued into the room, mock-gaping at the sight. “
He could kick himself.
“Just give me a second. I just need to… concentrate… is all.”
“You are
* * * * *
John was a miracle.
After dinner at a tiny bistro that Sherlock happened to know nearby – and where he also transformed back into his usual clean-shaven, dark-haired self in the loo, to the surprise of only one of the waiters (which in turn astounded John)
John stopped as the door fell closed in front of him. He raised his eyes to the ceiling.
John was not in a good mood. Sherlock could tell the instant he walked into the flat and saw John sitting at the kitchen table. He seemed to be annoyed with the person who wrote the newspaper article he was reading, which indicated he was still in the same general state of disgruntlement he’d been in for the past few days – or weeks even.
His shoulders were heaving as his movements slowly stuttered to a halt, a wonderful emptiness stretching out inside him with room for just one thought:
So John not only bought a tree to hang stuff in, but also decorated the rest of the house with fairy lights, shiny silver stars and mistletoe – under loud, excited cheers from Chloe. Of course, he couldn’t resist throwing Sherlock meaningful glances whenever she did so, and thankfully, he quickly saw Sherlock soften a little at the idea of all that holiday ‘nonsense’. (In part also thanks to the mistletoe, which had been a strategic choice.)
“Dressed,” John repeated flatly. “Because... you would like to properly rip off my clothes next time rather than just my T-shirt and pants?” He mock-frowned.
He’d let him down so often in real life. Even though he’d told himself he’d never ever lie to John again, John naturally still hadn’t forgiven him for all his previous lies in the past. And on top of that, Sherlock realised, he had not even kept his promise. He’d never told John about Sherrinford.
John nodded thoughtfully. “I suppose it’s like someone softly rubbing a stick on your arm,” he said. “Initially, it doesn’t hurt at all, but after a while, it will result in an abrasion of your skin and it will become unbearable if they just continue.”
He looked at her. “Sherlock’s using again.”
There was only one thing he cared about – well, maybe two or three different things, depending on what his mood was – but they all came in a syringe, neat and straightforward. Bill Wiggins had just dropped by with another supply. Home delivery.
“Is it, really? I’d thought, at six months… Yes, you’re probably right, Hannah.” Mrs Holmes was opening cabinets to fetch tea mugs while she talked. “That store is in Bristol, isn’t it? It’s almost an hour’s drive, but we have no choice, I think. Though, we were actually going to visit Sherrinford tomorrow, weren’t we? That’s three hours driving to and fro already. It’s his birthday.”
John’s mouth fell open in amused surprise. “Have you…” He cleared his throat. “Have you ever done that before?”
She absolutely adored little Rosie, with her big eyes, sometimes inquisitive and often twinkling with joy. Looking after her brought back happy memories of when Imogen had been that age, when she and Briony had just gotten together.
“That’s nice. And did he say anything?”
why you told her about us!” John fondly rolled his eyes and shook his head. “But hang on, I thought you said she was in California?”
John pressed his lips together. “Sure, you’re absolutely right. Let me help you.” He nodded and with gritted teeth – hidden behind an artificial smile – he stepped back into the shop.
* * * * *
Nonetheless, John had then simply brushed his teeth and gone up to his old bedroom as if everything was back to the way it had been.
Rosie reminded them of her presence by announcing she was tired and needed a nap – which was to say, her quiet babbling turned into fussing of increasing volume – so John picked her up and took her upstairs.
John watched her disappear down the hallway and exchanged his empty container for a new one from one of the bags.
Although it must be admitted, that perhaps John’s threat might have helped to remove his last doubts.
“Am I allowed to speak again?” Sherlock teased.
“Well, not much really. He’s a ginger. And he’s got the same South African accent as Bob. I think they came here together, but they don’t seem to be the best of friends, as Bob refused to talk about him whenever I tried to fish for information since.”
The morgue was an excellent place, in this respect, as John was fine with being in a room with dead people, and the route to the morgue was familiar to him, as were the people working there. However, a
Either way, Mary (Rosamund) must have been laughing her head off, thinking they would never find the Pearl anyway. (Which, to be fair, they hadn’t. AJ had taken it right under Sherlock’s nose, never to be found again. It must now lie in some hiding place somewhere in the world, where it would likely remain forever.)
“I did.”
“You visited him,” his elder brother’s familiar, icy voice stated.
“Oh! No, don’t worry, she already knows.”
Stifling a yawn, Sherlock took off his own clothes as well and climbed into bed next to John.
Saheed swallowed nervously, then looked round at the woman and two other men in the room. “Okay, everyone.” Clicking his pen shut, he pulled the sheet over the face of the person on the examination table.
Then he pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s surprised mouth, allowing his lips to part ever so slightly this time and caressing Sherlock’s with the tip of his tongue. Soon, he felt Sherlock do the same, a bolt of lightning hitting him in the gut as their tongues met for the first time, tentatively brushing against each other in a slow, mesmerising dance, which for that moment made the world stop spinning and the universe shrink down to pre-Big Bang dimensions.
That morning, John had given him a new, dark-green scarf with a subtle bee pattern woven into it which was only visible from a certain angle, as well as an absolutely brilliant, perfect and wonderful blowjob, and a delicious breakfast with toasted crumpets and strawberry jam.
And earlier that same morning, while roaming through London to clear his head, Sherlock had realised that Vivian Norbury, the lovely little old lady who had been present at the D-notice meeting in January as Mrs Smallwood’s assistant, might very well be able to give them exactly the kind of information on Mary (Rosamund) that they needed in order to have her locked away. Assistants like her were, after all, notorious for their infallible memories.
Except when John came to visit, of course. Which was always so very nice.
“Not that I’m aware of.” She looked up at him, patiently waiting for the next question.
Unlike Jim, who had gradually become more and more frustrated and obsessed with Sherlock bloody Holmes as the years had passed, and who never seemed to take any pleasure in any sort of achievement at all, as long as Holmes was still out there, out of his reach.
In that exact moment, without actively trying to, an image flashed into his mind and it was instantly clear to him what he should do. (Long live pornography for providing this invaluable bit of inspiration.) After one more kiss to John’s mouth, Sherlock crawled backwards until his face was level with John’s prick, and he planted a single soft kiss to its base. Then, he kissed the inside of each of John’s thighs, which John was still holding spread wide open, and from there, a meticulous trail downwards to his arse cheeks.
A quick check confirmed that both her knickers and trousers needed a prompt rinse in cold water if she ever wanted to wear them again.
Something ardently tickled in Sherlock’s stomach.
John instantly felt himself melt into Sherlock’s touch, electrified, high on shock and arousal at the same time, and kissed him back as gently and tenderly as he could muster with the amounts of adrenalin coursing through him: just pressing their lips together, afraid to overwhelm him again. He had been an idiot for jumping out there like that, but at the same time he was rather glad he had; there would not likely have been a better way. Sherlock was kissing him now. He did feel the same.
Afterwards, in his anger and frustration, Sherlock had occasionally fantasised about doing the same thing back at him: to have Middlehurst helpless and at his mercy while he furiously pounded into him, seeking revenge and relief at the same time.
“To the hospital. Now.”
He glanced at his brother walking beside him in the busy shopping street, unaware of his thoughts, as they passed all sorts of elaborate Christmas displays in the shop windows, all complete with fake snow and blinking lights.
(She was thankfully asleep at the moment, anyway.)
When Sherlock gave him the plant, wrapped in cellophane and adorned with green ribbons, Sherrinford stared at it intently for a while, before gently touching one of its hairy leaves through the opening in the plastic. He looked back at Sherlock with something that Sherlock thought might be gratitude, although he couldn’t be sure. Then Sherrinford went back over to the window, put the plant on the window sill and sat back down on his stool.
When he woke up a second time, the bed was cold and empty. He sat up with a start, only to hear typical John Watson breakfast preparation noises coming from the kitchen.
She should probably not stay long.
“So will there be a mock terrorist barging in any moment?” Harry asked, looking around her.
Having been mildly confused for a second, Sherlock became outrageously befuddled the next instant, when John lunged forward, grabbed the front of his shirt and pressed his mouth hard against Sherlock’s. Before he knew it, John’s arms were around him, pressing their bodies close as John forcefully worked Sherlock’s lips and mouth with his own.
John had actually managed to make Sherlock come just with words once: whispering both sweet and filthy things into his ear while kissing his neck – and subtly pressing his bulge to Sherlock’s naked cock as he was straddling him, but otherwise not touching him.
It had been a hectic couple of weeks – filled with lawyers, divorce papers, disposing of Mary’s things – and John decided to go for Chinese takeaway on his way home from work. He walked to the restaurant around the corner from the surgery just as dusk was setting in and changed the city into a landscape of lights. The pavement glistened and small puddles reflected the streetlamps and neon signs above, their already blurry mirror images distorted by the little raindrops that continued to fall.
“Oh, has it been repaired?”
The next day, just as little Rosie had been discovering how you could make various interesting noises by banging different sorts of toys together, and the tracker signal had been blinking steadily from Morocco for a while, the indicator had suddenly stopped. They never knew if she’d found them out and destroyed it, or if it was a simple accident or malfunction.
Rosie, propped on John’s hip, kept staring and pointing at Sherlock’s wig, but seemed otherwise unimpressed.
The text "PRESSURE POINT: REDBEARD (SEE FILE)" appearing when Magnussen analyses Sherlock.
She should have known better.
John held his breath.
After pocketing the little plastic bag, Sherlock casually strolled back home, feeling more at ease already for the knowledge that bliss was now within an arm’s reach.
He felt a sliver of disappointment creep in at the edges already.
After scrutinising her face on the photograph for a moment, the man raised his walkie-talkie to his mouth and said, “Visitor S coming up”. Then, to her, a little more friendly, “Come on in. First floor.”
Then Sherlock lifted his eyes back to John.
“How was Sherrinford?” Sherlock asked, certain that Mycroft had visited him the day before. It had been his birthday, after all.
“Tauren… Toppee Sun Airport, I think?”
Strange as it seemed, seeing John’s nerves significantly quieted Sherlock’s own.
Sherlock and John looked defeated.
Heat pooled in his abdomen at the memory.
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock said, still amazed.
When they were quiet again, John realised there was one more thing he felt he needed to say. He took a long breath. “Listen, I know that my previous marriage was just an empty shell that didn’t mean anything, which for some people might make it a reason never to marry again. But for me it’s all the more reason to want to set things right and be married properly. To the love of my life. You.”
Another difference was that John now knew – almost for certain – that Sherlock had more than one brother; a bizarre revelation which still blew his mind.
He was doubtlessly just being selfish, anyway.
He fell head-first into the big black hole of supreme ecstasy as his movements started to falter and his vocal chords randomly activated themselves of their own accord entirely.
Sherlock’s heart broke a little at the sight of his friend.
“Nobody. I... misspoke,” Mycroft said primly.
Perhaps it was the partial darkness that gave him the courage he had lacked before.
They could actually start living their lives together and John could finally, at long last, stop looking for what he hadn’t been able to find anywhere else.
“Dad? What’s happening? What was that text?” she asked, smiling. Strangely, although she still had the same northern English accent, her voice sounded slightly different. “Are you having one of your jokes?” She chuckled, then stopped walking forward and looked enquiringly at Sherlock. “Who are you?”
John willed himself to stay calm. “Who are you?”
Just a few types of alien molecules added to his organism, disrupting the natural balance between thousands of endogenous biochemical compounds in his nervous system and beyond; turning him into an unreliable loose projectile. Just like John’s dad and sister, when they were on booze.
And even then, Rose had not kicked Eurus out right away. But she had accepted the invitation, naturally, and had said her goodbyes on Christmas morning, telling Eurus briskly to make sure she didn’t leave a single trace that she’d ever been there.
They’d agreed they would visit an art museum together as soon as Sherlock was back from Norway. He thought it was an outrage that the last time anybody had taken Sherrinford to one was over eight years ago – on his birthday the year he’d come out of prison.
. He generally refused to look at people, much less strangers. Which made it quite impossible for him to learn any of the gestures.”
“Oh god, Sherlock…” John’s breath hitched with every syllable.
Mycroft had seen it all, from his bedroom window, and had been insufferable afterwards. “Better be careful, Sherlock. Don’t stoop to this level of hysterics ever again, if you want to be taken seriously in life at all.
“Of course not. Very good. But, um, I’ll tell you mine. My name is... William Sherlock Scott Holmes. So now I’m not really a stranger anymore, you see.”
John blinked, frowning. Of course it had. It just hadn’t occurred to him she might pose as his therapist and aim a bloody gun at him.
“Yes?”
Sadly, Rose’s presence had not even begun to fill the emptiness inside of Eurus that Jim had left behind. Rose herself had, however, soon started busying herself with keeping Jim’s business running. Which apparently
John’s blood turned cold when inside, he saw Smith at Sherlock’s bed, who instantly released Sherlock as he turned to look at the door.
“Are you sure?” the shopkeeper asked. “Should we cancel the ambulance, then?”
The first thing John did after their weekend in heaven was have himself tested. It had been a completely stupid and irresponsible thing not to use a condom when he’d given head, since he was perfectly aware that both herpes and gonorrhoea could easily be passed from mouth to genitals. He was a goddamn
“Really? Wow,” John said, a little awed.
“Good morning, my prince,” John teased.
The next day, after a late breakfast with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, they started their Search. They walked around the town, between the white and brownish-red wooden houses, following Rosamund’s GPS trail along streets and backways.
John quickly pulled Sherlock’s trousers and pants down. He liked Sherlock naked, even though both knew that John wasn’t going to bother taking off his own clothes.
, as promising to do so afterwards would only be counterproductive, I fear.” He was barely managing to keep a straight face himself by this point. “So will you
?” She laughed boisterously.
John tried not to think about it too much. Not about sex in general, nor about if and how he could ever get intimate with Sherlock again. He was just not ready to consider those things yet.
Tears were streaming down John’s face now, his emotions overflowing in one big, chaotic jumble.
Several times, John had put an arm around Sherlock in bed, but Sherlock had simply pretended he was already asleep even if John knew he wasn’t. In spite of what John had been telling him, Sherlock seemed convinced that John didn’t love him anymore. There was just no getting through to the bloody moron of a genius that he was. It was starting to reach the point of being pretty damn infuriating.
Sherlock asked for the bill. When it arrived, Mycroft tried to offer his card, but Sherlock made a point out of paying this time. Mycroft raised his eyebrows, but said nothing.
“He doesn’t text her back,” he replied, his jaw set.
His smirk, however, indicated that he’d guessed correctly.
“Promise,” John insisted firmly.
After three biscuits, he decided to text Mycroft.
John smiled in spite of himself. That was just such a ‘Sherlocky’ thing to ask. Always practical.
“There is no scheme, John. You were shot in the head with a rubber bullet. You’re still recovering.”
slept, he’d had this godawful dream where he was the one carrying a gun in the Aquarium instead of John, and in his attempt to shoot Moran, he accidentally killed John instead. The bullet, meanwhile, also broke the glass of one of the tanks, and the next moment, Sherlock was drowning in the water that kept flooding in, with John floating underwater in a cloud of blood just out of reach, and sharks hovering around the both of them, flashing their toothy grins as they drew nearer.
They held hands in the cab like frightened school children; Sherlock numb after having finally released his emotions, John clenching his other fist with more force than would be required to strangle the toughest geography teacher in the country. John very much doubted that anyone had been there to hold Sherlock’s hand back then, after it happened. He had so many questions, but none of them were worth asking.
I also want to thank all of the people who I’ve asked for all sorts of advice and who have given some of their free time to help me shape this story into the most realistic narrative I could: deaflock, ewebie, julzann, welovethebeekeeper, quietlymischievous, monikakrasnorada, smirkdoctor, myspecialhell, fatto-il-misfatto, johnlockismyreligion, chained-to-the-mirror and Hannah.
I have to say I’m quite proud of the end result, as I think I managed to come up with a story that fits with everything from BBC canon up to TFP. Let me know what you think!
Getting off with Sherlock was infinitely different from his last sexual experiences, with Mary; because those had been laced with a very different kind of passion – first grief (over Sherlock’s supposed suicide) and, later, outright hatred (for her having almost killed him for real). John had initially expected it to be hard to let go of those very unhealthy associations, but it wasn’t. Sherlock was Sherlock, and although John had wanted to strangle the man on plenty of occasions in the past, there was nothing but love and tenderness in their shared intimacy. When they were together like this, the world was safe and wonderful, and any worries they might have in their daily lives were utterly and completely gone.
Besides all that, she’d had a bit of a shock when this Sherlock bloke had gotten in touch last month, to tell her that John was in hospital. The network connection had been flaky for days, so she’d only received the message when John was already out of his coma. Hence she hadn’t had the chance to worry too much in the moment, but as the days passed, she’d started realising how she would have felt if the original message had reached her immediately: that her brother was in a bad way and might not pull through. He was still her brother, after all. Her only connection to her past. Well, him and Aunt Viv. They were the only family she had left.
Once the bed was flat, Smith straightened up and bared his teeth as he looked at Sherlock, running his tongue along his bottom lip. Then he walked around to the other side. He straightened the medical glove on his right hand and leaned down towards Sherlock. “Take a big breath if you want,” he whispered.
“It’s a really difficult language all of its own, you know. Extremely complex. The whole idea was just too ambitious.” She got up and walked to the far kitchen cupboard.
He made himself comfortable in a chair next to the bed.
,” Hannah said. “Or you could hang up a few posters near the building.”
He should have realised that she was just acting, that it was all fake.
, indeed.” He cupped Sherlock’s cheek with one hand, smirking. “Nor do I want to.”
“I think I saw the sea, before I came into the loo.”
Fixing him with her cold gaze, she said, “I lost the two people I loved because of you. So it would only be fair if he died.” Turning her eyes to John, Eurus’s voice was suddenly eerily flat. “Even before she died, he took Rose away from me.”
Bad idea. Very bad.
me, until now. But you could see straight through me from the first day. You see something precious in me that even I never saw in myself before, until I met you.” John noticed his voice was starting to sound funny now, but he didn’t care. “And that is why this is more than just being in love. You actually make me feel good about myself.”
“Dogs have similar nervous systems to ours! They experience pain in the same way. Bentham, the philosopher, stipulates they feel just like we do. So stop it! You’re going to hurt him!”
Sherlock didn’t care when some of his muscles and limbs started protesting their unusual position after a while. All that mattered was John, rocking into him, holding him, flooding him with oxytocin and endorphins that were so much better than any drug. So much better.
John gaped at the little bee in his hands. “Wow! Did you-- Did
“And while we’re there,” Sherlock went on, “I need you to help me find out on which days the guy gets his gold supplies from our South African duo.”
But, simultaneously, he’d had to pretend he loved Mary as well, day in, day out.
,” Sherlock hissed.
Strange, how comforting a hug could instinctively feel, regardless of his repulsion for this man.
He wondered also if John could hear any of the sounds around him.
The second time Sherlock sucked John off, he had lasted a bit longer and Sherlock had been able to at least practice this new skill a little.
When Sherlock was about halfway in, however, John suddenly grimaced and sharply sucked in air between his teeth.
It was the collector’s edition DVD box of Alfred Hitchcock films that John had been meaning to buy for ages.
John looked at Sherlock hesitantly for an instant, as if collecting himself, then deliberately reached for the top button of Sherlock’s shirt and started unbuttoning it, slowly and carefully. His eyes flashed between Sherlock’s and the place where he was about to see newly exposed skin behind each button. When his eyes fell on the little circle that his ex-wife’s bullet had left, he briefly looked up at Sherlock with a blank stare that hid the depth of emotion beneath it.
Sherlock looked alarmed. “What? Where?”
John let the dough rest and breathed out a long sigh. “I realised I was suppressing my memories of her, because her death was so painful to me.”
A reporter asked, “Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?”
And just when John had started seriously considering acting upon his feelings, they’d had a row and Sherlock had jumped.
Sherlock quickly helped John get the shirt off him and threw it randomly across the room so they could focus on each other again. He then boldly grabbed John’s arse with one hand and pressed his lips to John’s again. John curved a hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck in response, kissing him back, more slowly and gently this time.
“Would you like to rest now?” John asked.
“Well then. Can you tell me what happened?” the sergeant had asked, earnestly, as she cradled her coffee.
Well, not
Sherlock’s jaw tightens, before replying, "I’m not a child any more, Mycroft."
? More than the number of fingers and toes he had, for sure. Maybe close to those of two people.
“Just get your cock inside of me, John,” Sherlock pleaded once more, writhing in the sheets.
John hovered the mouse pointer over the little cross in the upper right corner. Just as he hadn’t been able to write anything truthful about those missions, he now couldn’t very well write about nappies and baby food on his public blog, could he? It was supposed to be about outlandish crimes, exciting adventures and brilliant deductions.
“Marcus,” his brother answered, with moist eyes. Then, shyly, “That’s the first time I’ve mentioned his name to anyone. Even Anthea knows him only by code name.”
Sherlock had to make an effort to keep taking regular breaths.
--Sounds great! Jack says it’s an incredibly posh place though... Maybe we should go to Negozio instead? It’s a lovely Italian restaurant down the road, slightly more affordable. :) Look forward to seeing you too. x
* * * * *
Lowering his mug, Sherlock looked around the room, pretending not to know what he was talking about. “Mm?” He swallowed his mouthful. “What was what?”
When she’d left, the earl continued, “Edith is an artist. She grossly underestimated what it meant to have a child and she’s had several nervous breakdowns since then. There was a point where she could only look at Arthur when he was asleep. She would stand next to his bed, just looking, for an hour every night.” Beverly stared blindly into the distance for a few moments at this painful memory. “I tried to make up for the lack of attention he got from his mum, I really did. But last summer, we decided it would probably be better for everyone if he started boarding. Except then it turned out that Edith and I had grown apart to the point where, well… there was no love left.”
John briefly caught his lip between his teeth and looked down at Sherlock with an awed look. “Oh god, you are so goddamn beautiful, you know that?”
Mycroft pursed his lips, nodding slowly. “Yes, I do see what you mean. That was a very curious decision, certainly.”
“That’s… a little weird, to be honest,” John said.
John held out a stern hand to Sherlock. “Whoa, Sherlock, d’you wanna put that down?”
After lunch, though, when John finally plonked down onto the sofa – a cup of tea in one hand and his newspaper in the other – Sherlock all of a sudden slammed shut the book he’d been reading and sprang from his chair to sit next to him. He pressed his side to the backrest and pulled up one leg so that he was directly facing John. He then rather elaborately pursed his lips before sucking them in, just staring at John, clearly anxious. He then looked around the sofa, as if trying to find the words there that he was looking for, his eyebrows travelling down and back up his forehead several times before he finally spoke.
The touch was electrifying, sending shuddering waves of goose bumps across Sherlock’s body. Sherlock let his head fall back against the door and John took the opportunity to lean in and run his tongue over his neck, eliciting a series of gasps and sighs from Sherlock’s open mouth, which were answered by John’s soft moans of contentment.
* * * * *
“But you have to,” Sherlock insisted. “I’m not going to attempt to penetrate you before you have.”
“Yes!” he yelled. “Yes, I would!”
The tone of his voice at the mention of his secret flame was full of love.
He pricked his ears.
Sherlock ambled over to where John was working, now alternately stretching the ball of dough and flattening it onto the work surface. He still looked a little weak, but not nearly as poorly as the previous few days. Same as Sherlock.
On a hunch, Sherlock started googling the names of the artists in the contemporary wing on his phone and showing their pictures to his brother. “Look, this artist is Deaf also,” he signed, showing him a Wikipedia page. “And here, this one lives very near Wantage,” he pointed, standing next to a painting of a giant still life of a salad bowl. “Would you like to meet some other artists some time?”
