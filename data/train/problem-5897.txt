Wade wasn’t going to argue with that. They were more than relieved when they reached the strange rock, which turned out to be a huge one storey building, decorated in plants, vines and anything the jungle could wrap around it. It didn’t take long to find the giant, wooden door at the front, which thankfully had no locks to stop them from getting in.
My updating will be crappy, I've got so much going on! Sorry! :(
Peter then had a thought. Pulling back from the kiss he looked up at Wade with a smirk. “Hey, Wade?”
Peter gave him the best ‘are you kidding me?’ look he could muster up. “Take a good look, idiot.” he said, pointing in the direction of the dinosaur’s trail.
“Shut up Wade!” Peter barked, his hand shaking as he virtually stabbed the buttons on the device. If he was being honest with himself, he really didn’t know what Tony could do at that moment, but looking around he didn’t really have any other choice than to try something.
“I thought we were supposed to see dinosaurs on this tour, Petey.” Wade deadpanned, flattening his face against the window of the vehicle. “I see grass, trees, trunks, fences, even bugs, hell is that a rabbit?”
“Steven!” Thor grinned, happy to hear his other friend’s voice. “Is Peter and his love safe and sound?”
“Phew.” Wade sighed, shaking his shoe to get rid of the clumps of dirt sticking to it. “That’s alright then.” He said as he began hoping on one leg, trying to put his trainer back on.
Wade was on his feet clapping like a maniac as Peter laughed beside him. It wasn’t until the crowd started dispersing and heading for the exit that they noticed Loki, who jumped out of his seat with an oversized, green umbrella clutched in his hand.
“Hey, Peter.” Steve smiled back at the cheerful teenager. “Good to see you in one piece.”
Tony nodded with an inaudible sigh. “Okay, okay, I’ll give Pepper a ring and see if we can switch some meetings around. I’ve got an important one to go to first though.”
The other two stayed silent for a short while, letting Bruce silently cry into his hands to get it out of his system. But Tony knew that now wasn’t the time to mourn, not for any of them, because as they stood in that hallway the Foniassaurus was still on the move.
Natasha ran for her life, the voices of her friends blaring hysterically in her ear. She heard one of her agents let out a stomach-turning cry, then another, then another, each one of her teammates being taken down around her. Natasha fled through the tall trees, trying desperately to stomp out the fear that was taking over, her hands shaking, and heart beating way too fast.
The engineer saw the exact moment it hit Bruce like a hard slap to the face. The scientist’s face turned as white as a sheet of paper, his eyes wide in shock, his hands started trembling as he pulled off his glasses and put a hand to his head. Luckily Steve was there as the next thing they knew Bruce’s knees had a mind of their own, and the blonde dashed over to catch him, holding him up as Tony ran across the hall to retrieve a chair for him to sit in.
“Hey.” She nodded to the other two. “What do you think?” she asked, looking at Steve.
What he didn’t see coming was the engineer screaming down the phone, his words making Steve wish he’d been wrong about the scratch marks.
“They’d be so boring at a barbeque.”
Steve’s voice came over the line, sounding just as stressed as he was. “
“Whoo!” Wade punched the air before leaning down to kiss Peter sloppily on his cheek.
“Isn’t that a good thing?” Peter asked, slumping down in his chair in utter relief.
Jessica and Luke had sauntered further into the cage, checking out the dinosaur’s footprints that led into the greenery. Steve stayed to take a look around the wall, seeing if there was any other evidence at how on earth such a humongous dinosaur could have gotten past them.
“Don’t Steve me.” Steve smiled as he removed his hand, making Tony smile in return. “We’ll do this together, okay?”
After Tony’s alarmed phone call to Thor, demanding they get a move on with the evacuation, they’d hurriedly gotten back in the car, not wasting anymore time in finding Peter and Wade. Tony was even more anxious now that he’d learnt the boats wouldn’t be at the park for at least another hour, not to mention Thor had told him they couldn’t find his nephew anywhere in the park on the infrared, which meant they were somewhere in the old section of the jungle where the cameras hadn’t been set up. But at least now they had an incline of where to look.
“Pete, honey bear?” Wade whispered, as brash, booming stomps headed their way as they both stood. “Why do I have a bad feeling about this?”
The room was deadly silent. Every employee now sitting at their stations awaiting orders, Thor and Carol already done with connecting Shields cameras to the main screen, every soldier’s individual body cam brought up for the entire control room to watch their every move. All eyes were on Tony as he gazed around the room, heart pumping probably as fast as those soldiers as they got closer to the danger.
“You can see Jess and Luke?” Tony cursed under his breath. “Shit! I’ve got to get a hold of them, keep an eye on that damn monster!”
Steve stood there in horror as the dinosaur bit down with its powerful jaws, blood beginning to pour from between its sharp teeth, Luke’s body going lifeless and limp like a ragdoll. Jessica screamed in agony, watching in anger and pain as her husband was crushed in the Foniassaurus’s mouth, the creature ripping the man’s body into pieces before flinging what was left of him onto the earthy ground, the creature eyed the two remaining prey and started to take slothful steps forward.
“So, we’re not going bye bye?” Wade asked, looking like he was contemplating whether to pick Peter up and run, or get into the foetal position and cry.
“With the only way we can,” Matt simply said, “with big guns.”
Like a mole popping out of its hole, Wade appeared out of nowhere behind the jeep, a big, cheerful grin on his face. “Look what I found!” he crooned, holding up what appeared to be an aged, yellowing map.
“No,” Steve bit his lip, thinking back to the incident with Shield, replaying every step in his mind from the conversations to the camera angles. “It inherited something a lot more dangerous.” He said surely.
Tony stopped the car then. He pulled onto the side and stared down at his phone, rubbing his thumbs in circles across the side of his head. This was not a good time for this conversation.
He knew he’d messed up, God did he know it. Everyone had told him so, his sister, Bruce, Pepper, even Thor who loved Steve like a brother and wanted the two to work it out so bad. He suddenly had the urge to turn the car around, when all of a sudden his phone buzzed and he picked it up to find a text message from May. He smiled at what she’d written.
Luke nodded slowly. Then Steve moved his gaze around the enclosure, eyes landing on each and every camera that was stuck to the wall. One by the gate, one in the corner by the glass windows, and another, hidden amongst the trees looking right into the dinosaur’s woodland. There were no cameras that could point towards where the Foniassaurus had made those marks, and all of a sudden Steve felt a chill run down his spine.
“No, really?” Peter snorted, as he went for the one on the right.
“Wade, come on.” Peter said as he started sprinting, dodging the branches and plants that were scattered in his way. “It’s a building!”
Peter’s eyes widened. “We are so dead.”
“JUST GO!” She shrieked, hand moving into her back pocket to retrieve a hand gun. “If I go down, I go down with him!”
Natasha’s husband hadn’t heard her. The team looked over at him, brows furrowing in confusion as to why he was looking up into the trees, as if something was lurking on the branches. Natasha called for him once more, but he held up his hand, gesturing for her to keep quiet. The team stood still, watching, and waiting.
“No.” Tony whispered, feeling the cold of fear creep up on him. “No!”
“The Brachiosaurus.” Was all Steve said before he was practically diving out of the passenger’s seat and running out into the field.
Wade nodded speedily, rolling to the side off of the smaller man, as they both lay on their stomachs before lifting themselves onto their knees. The two looked behind them as the dinosaur stomped its foot, getting ready to dive in for another round of tree chomping.
Matt didn’t answer them, neither did the rest, following their boss’s order to stay silent. As the occupants in the control room and his wife had bickered over the coms about infrared, Matt had stayed in place, flinching as some form of liquid had dropped straight onto his cheek. At first he’d thought it was just a drop of rain falling out of the leaves above, but after another had fallen in approximately the same place, he took his finger off the trigger of his gun and took a swipe at his face. His eyes widened as he looked down at the thick, red fluid that stained his glove.
“Wade!” Peter shouted back at his boyfriend, who’d, not so surprisingly, wondered off ages ago. “Wade, get in here! I did it! Let’s get a move on!”
“LUKE!” Jessica cried.
“Yes!” Steve answered. “Keep going!”
“I think the Foniassaurus is smarter than it looks.”
“Yeah, this must have been it. There’s no other emergency gates open.”
“I had meetings this afternoon.” As soon as the engineer had said it he regretted it. “I mean… I was going to see them tonight, for some food and stuff.”
They didn’t need a dinosaur encyclopaedia to know that whatever it was was looking them up and down like they were his lunch, and it didn’t take long for the thing to decide it was hungry. In a split second the dinosaur went from silently watching to making a racket as its jaws opened wide and he let out a blood curdling roar, almost sending Peter and Wade flying backwards.
By what he could tell from this angle, the arena appeared pretty safe. The walls must have been around fifty feet tall, ten feet taller than the dinosaur itself, they were made using beams and tough cement from what he was told, but they seemed thicker than the glass which was a bit of a relief. But Steve still couldn’t help but feel like the place wasn’t right for the creature. Never in his career at the park had he seen a dinosaur attempt an escape, not even the T-Rex had put a dent in its cage.
“You Peter Parker?” the man drawled in a thick English accent, sounding like he was bored rigid.
Tony heard the despair in his voice, it didn’t go unnoticed. “What?” Tony questioned. He didn’t know what could have been worse than a gigantic dinosaur escaping, and almost killing people. But then it struck him. He’d been so concerned about Steve that he’d blocked out everything else.
“That doesn’t matter!” Steve said in all seriousness, becoming irritated that nobody was even thinking about the dangers they were about to face. “She’s smart, you saw that. She
“She may be smart, but she’s never been out of her cage before,” Natasha said. “We have an advantage, she’ll have no idea how to survive out in the wild.”
“I’m not panicking!”
Steve held his gaze and exhaled. “Better them being angry than dead.”
Natasha didn’t let up. With the cries and shouts of her friends in her ear, Natasha never took her hand off the trigger, not until the very last shell released. As the Foniassaurus dove forward to capture Natasha in her jaws, the officer threw her gun to the side, pulling out her knife. The dinosaur clamped its teeth around her body, Natasha letting out a blood curdling yell as it lifted her into the air, swinging her about as if she were a dog and its toy.
If seeing the cabin was sentimental enough, he wasn’t prepared for the longing he felt when he laid eyes on Steve himself. As he drove slowly down the path and parked a fair way from the house, Tony saw him and he hadn’t changed one bit in the half a year he hadn’t seen him. The trainer was working on his motorbike as he did whenever he was feeling stressed, down on his knees in the dirt as he used a spanner to tighten up some loose nuts.
“PETER!” Tony bellowed as loud as he could. “PETER, STOP THE DAMN CAR!”
“Yes.” Bruce stammered. “A tree frog.”
“One Mrs. Triceratops, two Mrs. Triceratops, Three Mrs. Triceratops…”
She shrieked. “
Natasha and Matt nodded, before turning to leave.
If there was anything to say about Steven Grant Rogers, it was that he was the bravest man on Jurassic island. Not only did he become the parks very own dinosaur researcher and behaviour specialist, he also became the trainer and caretaker of four very real, and very dangerous velociraptors.
Steve shook his head in disbelief as Luke came to stand beside him, accompanied by Tony. “This is insane, I thought this glass was made to stand an explosion?”
“Then use thicker glass!”
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. The two ran as fast as they could through the trees, dodging bushes and twigs that got in their way, calling out Peter and Wade. They could just about hear the quiet rumbling of the jeep’s engine, meaning they were so close behind.
“Wade, what the hell?” Peter yelped as Wade tugged him through the crowd.
Bruce never told him that either. Tony suddenly had the urge to get on a plane back to
Tony groaned, raking his hands through his hair. “Shit!” he bellowed, making everyone in the room jump. “I can’t believe this is fucking happening!” he exhaled.
The three men looked over at the person approaching them. A tall woman with dark hair and a stern expression, her builder’s hat mismatched with her leather boots and jacket.
“Well done,” Steve said as he held up two hands, the creatures not moving an inch at his command. “Hold… that’s it.”
“Steve,” Tony went on, feeling more and more ready to let the truth spill out as he went. “I realised when I left that you were right… God you were so right! I was never there for you as much as I should have been! All those work calls, meetings, events that I’d spend hours at until early hours, flying off to New York all the time… I should… I should have treated you as my first priority, not my work, and I’m so fucking sorry.”
Tony nodded, slinging a gun over his shoulder that Steve handed him. “Okay, okay, we’re good… everything’s good. Good.”
Steve gave him a look that quite frankly said ‘no shit’. Tony continued. “I wasn’t kidding… when I said I needed time to think… I just… I needed time to process that we were over and that… that I was a terrible boyfriend and didn’t even realise it!”
“Tony!”
“Wade!”
“Steve’s right, Tony.” Bruce added. “You’re not thinking straight.”
“He was here.”
“Tony.” Steve looked at him liked he’d suddenly grown two heads. “Seriously?”
But before Steve could answer, the jeep hit a deep ditch in the ground, sending the jeep flying into the air and slamming back down with a thump. Steve’s phone slipped out of his hand, falling onto the floor of the vehicle and sliding underneath the front seat.
“WADE!” Peter Parker shouted across the room at his boyfriend, zipping his backpack shut with extreme difficulty. “Just choose which damn jacket you want and let’s go!”
“Of course it is.” Tony snorted.
“We have to stop all the rides.” He said before storming into the control centre, Bruce and Steve hot on his tail. “Thor!” Tony yelled, making everyone in the room look around. “Stop the rides and get everyone to the Information Centre, now!”
“I can’t, Peter could be in serious danger right about now!”
“So, what did Schmidt want this time?” Clint asked, opening the freezer to reveal shelves full of dead mice and rats. “Did Natasha know he was here?”
Tony stared ahead, mouth wide open but no words coming out. “But…” he shook his head, there must have been something wrong with the tracker. “No. No, no, she climbed out, we saw the marks! She’s escaped, there’s no other explanation!”
Thor said over the coms, sounding like he was about to be sick from the nerves, even though he was safe in the control room.
Realising he still had him in a tight hug, Tony quickly let go and took a tentative step back. He now too had a discrete smell of petrol over his shirt, but he couldn’t care less as long as Steve was safe.
“She already has, Tony.” Steve said. “Remember when Matt found her tracker? She came out of nowhere, just walked out from amongst the trees like she were…”
“So, nobody was here except for the two guards who couldn’t see inside the cage?” Steve said, starting to put things together.
“Forget about that now, Bruce.” Steve said. “We just have to concentrate on finding a way to kill her.”
Steve only nodded, eyes glued to one spot on the floor.
Tony bit his lip in agitation. “Steve?” the man finally turned his attention to him. “I’m sorry for not backing you up, I just… I knew Nat wouldn’t listen to me if I told them not to go, so, I had to let Shield do what they needed to.”
“I just… They were important to mom, she wouldn’t want them to fail. She put a lot of effort into them too, May.”
Tony could have hit himself for the stupid question, by the amount of cuts on Steve’s arms, and the possible bruise forming on his cheek he’d say he wasn’t doing too great.
Bruce shook his head back and forth wildly. “No, no, it’s my fault! Mine! I should… god I should never have agreed to make that damn thing!” he let out a quiet sob, before a single tear trailed down his cheek. “Nat… god she’s dead because of me… and her husband… God, Jess and Luke were planning on having kids!”
Bruce nodded. Steve’s concerned tone of voice didn’t go unnoticed by Tony. “What’s so bad about a fish? This dinosaur a good swimmer or something?”
Peter grinned. “That I’d like to see.”
Peter and Wade jumped out of their skin as a deafening boom sounded behind them, like the sound of an extremely big tree hitting the floor. They weren’t the only ones who’d noticed, as the Ankylosaurs made a run for it through the trees and out of sight, and Peter and Wade were left staring at the spot where the noise had come from.
They ran like the wind through the dark trees, the ground feeling light under their feet as the fear of getting caught gripped them. The further they ran the more they felt relieved that they were nearly out of the dinosaur’s vision, nearly in the clear. But the Foniassaurus soon realised that her prey wasn’t where she wanted them.
“Precisely.” Thor nodded. “But now that the Foniassaurs is out there, we have no choice but to turn up the volts on every fence that covers the fields and outskirts of the park. Just another way of keeping her away from the main park.”
“Let’s get you straight to a medic, huh?” Tony said to the trainer, as he eyed his cuts up troublingly.
Tony wasn’t expecting that. “You have?”
The waiter looked up at the sound of his name, seeing that it was only Stark he went straight back to his phone. It was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Oh,” Wade giggled excitedly. “Your uncle’s ex who finished with him because your uncle was a bad boyfriend?”
Tony frowned. “It’s Mr. Stark to you.” He said, noticing how Peter looked way too amused for his own good at the conversation. “And uh, how old are you exactly Wade?”
“All the meat eaters are put into separate cages.” Steve said, getting where Thor was going.
, to come check out her enclosure and see if you think it’ll hold and if anything needs adding or changed.”
Tony sighed, running a hand through his sticky hair, noting that his own hands were trembling irrepressibly. “It was Steve, I should never have…”
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“Jesus Christ!” Tony stomped on the break quickly before he unbuckled his belt, rushing out of the car himself. He knew Steve was a bit of a daredevil, but he wasn’t expecting him to leap out of a moving vehicle for crying out loud! “Steve!”
“It should be there.” Natasha said calmly, exchanging a look of uneasiness with her husband across the stream.
“Jackpot.”
Before he could summon up the courage to go that little bit further, the two were interrupted by the doors loudly slamming shut. The entire room stopped what they were doing at the lurid bang, all eyes turning to Bruce who stood there with cheeks as red as tomatoes, looking like he’d just done the most embarrassing thing in his entire life. He held up his hands and started apologising, avoiding all eye contact as he made his way over to Steve and Tony, more than relieved once the workers went back to doing their jobs.
“Fuck fuck fuck!” Wade screamed in panic as they jumped over fallen logs and dodged branches, Wade pushing Peter further ahead to shield him. “Run Peter, fucking run!”
“Tony! Step on it!” Steve hollered from the back seat. “NOW!”
Peter elbowed Wade so hard in the ribs he’d feel it for weeks. The teenager grinned innocently at his uncle, who didn’t look impressed.
“No, I understand,” Bruce said as he slipped his glasses back on, hands still quivering. “God, just kill it, it should never have… it should never have been made in the first place, I should never have agreed with Hank.”
Tony felt himself instinctively reaching out to touch the dinosaur, just as Steve was doing, and run a hand along its smooth skin. He rubbed his fingers down its neck as carefully as he could, wishing he could do something, anything to make the pain go away for the poor creature.
The Foniassaurus roared at the top of its voice, as if crying out in victory. Peter, in his terror, let the phone slip from his hand, the device forgotten as the dinosaur prepared itself for another chew on the tree.
As the gate was more than halfway shut they got there, Steve shoving Bobby through on his knees. With seconds left before the gate shut completely, Steve rolled underneath to be able to fit through, hearing the loud clink as the steel gate came to a close. Sitting up Steve turned just in time to see one of the raptors run straight into the metal bars, snapping his jaws in anger at losing out on its prey.
“Nope,” Tony chuckled, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. “But you were looking for those pretzels, and were pretty adamant that we’d find them.”
“No.” he breathed out, his hands balling into fists in anger at what they saw. Metres ahead was a pitch of green grass with not just one other Brachiosaurus, but at least five or six of them lying there dead, big, red lacerations on parts of their bodies. “She did this.” Steve snarled. “She just killed them all, killed them for nothing.”
The two sent her a small wave as they made their way to the security check, tickets in hand and backpacks ready to put through the machine. Peter turned once more to send his Aunt another wave, her hand waving back frantically.
Steve looked up to see the soldier who was talking to him, closed his backpack while still looking at him
-I want pops to come back -Maria said as she closed her eyes and squeezed her teddy bear- I want her to come back, they don't need it, I do!
But it was so complicated to be away from her husband after the events that had happened in the war against Thanos, three years ago. They had won but in that intense battle, Tony almost saw Steve leaving for the other world just because it occurred to the old man to protect him from an impact, from there that Stark promised himself that he would not move away from Steve since two months in a coma, Tony, without resting or eating well, had wreaked havoc on the brunette, he had realized that despite what had happened in the civil war he was madly in love with the old man and that he could never forget it so easily. It had taken him a week to forgive him after what happened in Siberia! She was too weak if it was her husband.
As if those two words existed in the vocabulary of Tony Stark since the little demons came into his life, breakfast had been chaos as usual but at least they were already in their respective schools.
-It’s nothing, Mr. Rogers, everything to see one of my students happy
-Tony ... Okay, I deserve it, I recognize it
It had been almost six months since they had met their father and husband (Tony's) and all that was getting so hellishly complicated, they had never been more than two or three months apart although in those months Rogers traveled sporadically to visit them. But since Hydra had taken power in one part of the world, the captain went back into action and much more overworked as he was the commander of the army. But the one who suffered most of them all, was Tony although he did not notice, he must be strong for his children.
Harley and Peter sighed in relief, although their relief was unnecessary since at that time someone was naughty stroking the ass of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D and heir of Stark Industries.
If we had been in an empty room I would have already undressed him to show how he had missed him. We parted when the air lacked and our lungs begged for oxygen.
He was going to continue playing when the crazy shouts of the cheerleaders and some exclamations of astonishment from his companions were heard, he turned to see what was so much fuss behind his back, his mouth opened in surprise since he was walking near the opposite arch Captain America himself, Steve Rogers, his pops ...
He said goodbye to both of them and then got on the plane with his comrades and best friends, when he sat sighing and looked at his wedding ring, he would soon be with them. With his happiness ...
- They are going to continue doing it or I will accuse them with pops, and they know that he punishes worse than daddy. They don't want to hear a one hour speech about how to be a good brother, do they? -The little girl looked at her brothers with a tender innocence while Harley murmured "Little manipulator."
-Yes, yes, be old. I must sleep and rest. replied the brunette with a snort
-As every morning Potts, my children are little angels called chitauris, I do not know at what time Steve coaxed me to have children with him, now I am a mother, father, IronMan, Philanthropist, former playboy and head of SHIELD at the same time. -The businessman said with a touch of drama while Pepper laughed fun and handed him his coffee-
-Are you here! Dad, you are here!
-You called to let me know you would arrive, Steve? -Sam asked while stretching in the seat making Buck sit on the other side and look at him angry-
-I'm at home, love.
Everyone shouted happily except Maria who kept painting, she knew that her daddy Tony had an important meeting and his pops ... his pops was far from her, he took a hand his left eye to rub it and not allow himself to cry, she was a big girl .
He had physical education that day and although he did not like sports very much if he liked what football was. It was where they never bothered him for being a good player and apart from the fact that they always had physical education when cheerleading training, he could enrich his eyesight as Daddy Tony would say.
Harley couldn't stand the tears of emotion. His pops were there! And he was safe and sound, made a mental note at night to thank Odin and God for hearing his prayers, as he could and with his nerves to the surface he ran to where the blonde walked to jump and hold on like koala, no matter what that they thought of him at that moment, all he wanted was to hold on to his father and never let go.
She was very worried about not getting out of the line, although her mind wandered elsewhere, Harley had fallen asleep at night with her since Maria kept crying. At least with the story his brother had managed to forget his grief a little, he felt his eyes tired but how he liked to paint he entertained himself in what he did until the teacher spoke, wrinkled his brow, did not like to be disturbed when there was something important. In that aspect he looked like his daddy. He kept painting no matter what that woman standing in front of the class would say.
-Dad yes, they are going to pay me for every time they made me rage little children of Satan, so I recommend using earplugs
Harley was the last one who had spoken making his brothers and their pops laugh. Everyone would say that Harley was the one who missed his father the least but he didn't. In fact Harley cried every night until he fell asleep asking Odin or Jesus to please take care of Steve, to return home well and promptly. He needed it too. Everyone needed him and missed him.
I hear some shrieks of joy but he didn't care, he didn't want to see how one of his friends was happy with his father while one of them was away, he was going to take another pencil until the voice of one of his companions was heard.
-Commander Are you sure about this? We are about to reach Hydra land after so many months
-Quiet Harley, nothing will happen, you know that your father likes to bother you with it.
-he kissed her forehead while Maria kept crying in her arms-
-Hey, calm Pet-Pet, congratulations son for your first place I am very proud of you
The little blonde quickly got off the table to run away while crying going to her room, her two older brothers looked at each other and then at her father who had been static instead.
-I love you guys, Maria remember to brush your teeth before bed but, when the last one is released and the mouse falls, it won't bring you anything. Harley don't make your father mad and stop disarming his suits. Peter, I hope you do very well at the science fair tomorrow, remember son that you are the best and always will be; Give a lot of kisses and pampering Johnny from me Yes? and Tony ...
-Fuck the first place You are here! But how? You know it doesn't matter, you're here, I missed you so much Pops, you missed me so much
-Very good, avengers and agents- I said as I looked with a happy smile when I saw Sharon Carter there, I took out my ring to admire him while he spoke and thus showed Sharon who I was married to-
They had almost 25 minutes of the game and he had played a terrible game, his mind was in another part of the world. Frustrated sigh did not like to feel helpless apart that he has never liked to see his younger sister cry.
But there was no sign whatsoever of the creature. Matt held up his hand once more, this time signalling for the team to come to a halt, as they did. The leader of Shield tentatively kept on going, not once letting his finger fall from the trigger, eyes on the trees up ahead. He knew the Foniassaurus was clever, what she’d done to his friends not long ago was no behaviour of any dinosaur he’d seen before, and he had a funny feeling she wasn’t about to be found quite so easily.
Unfortunately for Tony, his plan got a little side tracked when his phone began to ring. He took a peep at the screen and Peter’s name flashed across it. Tony felt relief flood him before he swiped his thumb across his phone and answered the call, full on bawling down the receiver.
“Look, Tony,” Steve said all of a sudden. “If you have something to say I’ll listen, but if you don’t I really think I’d better get inside the enclosure.”
And as the Foniassaurus got to him, Steve froze. Out in the corner of his eye he could see the dinosaur’s large feet, before all of a sudden it was bending down and it’s sharp, bared teeth came into view. Steve closed his eyes tight, not wanting to see what the animal’s next move would be, he just prayed inside his head that his plan had worked and he’d get out of this one alive.
“I swear that was a rabbit.”
“Well,” Tony shrugged. “Who’s to say it’s not a nice dinosaur?” he said with a smile.
Before Peter could answer, he was encased in a big, crushing hug, finding it a little difficult to breath. Tony quickly pulled away, checking over Peter to make sure he hadn’t been bitten by anything dinosaur like, or cut up by anything woodland like.
Steve knew he’d made a breakthrough training the raptors to even come to him when he called, he’d been even more surprised when he’d taught them how to wait and leave at the sound of his whistle. But he also knew that these were dinosaurs, a pack of dinosaurs, and dangerous ones at that. Steve may be their Alpha, but they were still velociraptors and not puppies.
“Jesus,” Tony said with a grin as he stopped in front of his nephew. “You’ve grown, how old are you now? Thirteen? Fourteen?”
“No I’m not, but they’re my raptors, I’m in charge of them, and I say what happens to them.”
“Yeah,” Wade squeaked. “So long Mr. Dinosaur, and don’t come back!”
Tony cursed in his mind. So much for playing it smooth. Tony tried not to let Steve’s stare faze him, being an expert in strutting Tony strolled on over to his ex-boyfriend with the biggest grin he could summon, noticing how Steve stood up, turned off his radio and gave him a not so friendly expression.
Bruce shrugged. “You know enough about business to have kept this place going for twenty years.”
“You owe me ten bucks.”
Wade looked confused, then surprised, then a light bulb went off in his head and he let out a curse. “Aw, fuck.”
BANG.
“Peter’s out there.”
Tony rolled his eyes and coughed into his hand. “It’s uh… it’s Steve.”
“Tony,” Steve stepped in, as Tony thought of how he was going to find Peter in all this mess. “You know a lot of guests will be difficult, they’d want to take their things with them, maybe they split up with their friends and want to find them, it’s not going to be easy persuading them to evacuate the island.”
?” The man’s voice suddenly became serious, meaning he was all ears. “
“Dinosaurs are like zoo animals these days,” Bruce said, snatching Tony’s phone out of his hand and putting it in his pocket. Tony glared. “We need something new, something bigger that will bring in the crowds.”
The jeep juddered and rattled noisily before stopping after a few seconds, Wade trying again and again to get it started, but unluckily the vehicle refused to come to life. Peter sighed, staring down at the engine and all the bits and bobs that held inside the front. He thought back to the time when he was younger, an infrequent time when Tony had babysat him for an entire day, his aunt May desperate as she had to go to a wedding somewhere in New Jersey. Tony had spent hours fixing his own car, hauling Peter along to show him how it was done, how everything worked and where everything went. Plus he was a good help passing the tools.
“Probably not,” Steve answered, letting Clint handle the job of putting the raptors grub into the buckets before he counted stock. “He was talking about using the raptors in a field test again.”
.” Aunt May breathed a sigh of relief. “
“Steve.” Tony whispered, without thinking he extended his arm to brush a hand over Steves. “Steve. I’m so…”
“I see no dude with a goatee, Petey.” Wade stated as he whipped his head back and forth.
The Foniassaurus growled at the back of its throat, but didn’t drop her. Natasha could feel the blood draining out of her, her energy dwindling as she continuously pierced the dinosaur anywhere she could reach. But the animal was no match for her. Within seconds the Foniassaurus reopened her jaws and clinched them back down, a nauseating crunch echoing through the control room, Natasha’s heavy breathing abruptly coming to a stop. Then everything went silent, as the sounds of the dinosaur’s heavy footfalls faded on screen.
“Hi Aunt May.” Peter greeted as he answered the phone.
“I know,” Peter said. “And don’t forget to tell Uncle Tony that he needs to ring you at least twice a day to let you know how we’re doing.”
“Wait, what?” Tony didn’t have time to stop him before Steve was out the door again, it was starting to become a habit of his. “Steve, be careful!” Tony called as he grabbed his own gun and got out of the car. “I swear you have a death wish!”
“What is this place?” Wade asked, giving the door a knock. “Anyone home?” he called in a high pitched voice.
“Erm…” Thor hummed, hanging up his phone and tossing it on his desk. He gazed up at the screen in front of the room, looking from one camera shot to the other, trying to figure out exactly what Steve was talking about over the phone. “Steve, he-,”
“Shit.” Tony said under his breath. “How dangerous is this thing?” he said, he hadn’t realised just how insane this idea had been, only now learning some facts about the creature. Maybe he should have paid more attention to Bruce when he’d gone over the plan.
“Uncle Tony, hurry up!”
The engineer took a quick glimpse in the side mirror, seeing the dinosaur take big steps behind them, opening its mouth to cry out. It was so close he could feel the creature’s breath breeze past him like a gust of wind, except it smelt like garbage and death, and Tony would hurl if he wasn’t focused on getting them the hell out of there. So, he pressed the pedal to the floor, pushing the vehicle as fast as it could go through the muddy forest. The jeep picked up speed, blasting off like a rocket, hitting low branches and crushing logs under its tyres.
“Aunt May,” he said, giving her a hug. “We’re going for four days!”
His suspicions were right as he came to a stop beside the trees, only the view of more trees, leaves and a muddy ground to be seen. No trace of the Foniassaurus.
Tony just about caught Steve’s words, but realising what the blonde had said he couldn’t help but feel encouraged.
But instead of getting it from Thor, it came in the form of Carol. She came rushing into the control room, looking more panicked than any of the workers had seen her before. Everyone went silent, because they knew within an instant that something was wrong, and Carol didn’t waste another second before she was yelling at the employees.
Peter was just a tad bit tempted to try and pick the lock on the door and jump out, maybe go on a little hunt of his own and try to find some of those long neck dinosaurs he’d seen in the movies. There’d be no doubt in his mind that Wade would happily tag along. He opened one eye to peak over at his boyfriend, who was now rubbing one hand down the glass window as if he were petting a dog. Peter smiled to himself before leaning all the way back and shutting his eyes again.
“Huh.” Wade hummed, standing beside the T-Rex and looking up in astonishment. “Do you think he skinned this bad boy just for its bones to be displayed in here?”
Tony almost jumped at the booming voice of one of the workers at the back row, he gazed over at him as the man stretched his arms into the air and grinned from ear to ear. Tony snorted, standing beside the long haired guy.
“I got away from Loki!” Wade said as they turned a corner. “He’s trying to kill me I tell you!”
Steve seized a hold of the petrol line and wrenched it towards him, with his other hand holding the knife he started to saw at it speedily. After what seemed like a lifetime the tube finally broke in half, the contents inside spilling all over Steve’s chest. The blonde placed the knife back into his pocket, before he spread the petrol further down onto his legs and arms like a flash, making sure his scent was covered enough to fool the smart creature.
Tony groaned, leaning back against the glass elevator and slapping a hand to his forehead. “But I hate it, all of it, can’t we just sponsor ourselves?”
, the clear sound of a thin twig breaking under a hefty weight, practically echoing against the quietness of the woods. They must have heard it back at base too, as the voices in her ear, Steve, Tony, Thor, Carol, began telling her to run, run and don’t look back.
Schmidt chortled. “Well I’m sure we’ll find a way, I am second in command after all.”
“Steven?” Thor called down the phone, as suddenly the line was cut off for some reason. “Steve, are you still there?”
“Exactly.” Steve said, noticing it was Tony who was calling. “We need to get out of here.” He said, backing up a little, hoping the other two would get the hint and follow. “Now.”
“Wade.” Peter’s voice called from behind him.
“I have a feeling it’s not.” Peter said, more captivated by the room they’d just walked in. “Wade, I think this must be the old building.”
Luke held up his hand and pointed to the other end of the room. Tony hadn’t noticed it before, but right in the top corner of the glass was a crack, a large slash that looked like something had hit it pretty hard. Tony’s eyes widened. Bruce definitely hadn’t mentioned that.
.” Steve answered in a rush, and Thor soon noticed that something was wrong by the sound of the younger man’s voice. “
“And we have to get these people off the island too.” Bruce added, Clint nodding in agreement.
Steve frowned. “You’re right.” Even though they’d had her tracker, she was nowhere to be found through infrared, the one thing that could have told them where she was. Steve had a bad feeling sitting in the pit of his stomach. “Bruce?”
“There’s been a breach!” She bellowed, heading for Thor. “Thor, sound the siren! Scott, call security, get them out to Main Street, NOW! The Pterodactyls have breached their cage, and they’re heading straight for Main Street!”
“Peter!” Tony wanted to yell, hit something, collapse and sleep for a few days, but instead he chose to run over to the driver’s side of the car, and swing open the door. “Don’t you ever do this to me again!”
“Jesus Christ!” Tony complained, interrupting her babbling. “You’re starting to sound like mom!”
“I’m gonna do it, fuck it.” Wade rubbed his hands together with a cackle.
“Steve.”
“Okay,” Peter said as calmly as he could. “In three, two…”
“My god.” Steve said under his breath, reaching a hand out to trail across the lines.
Once the pair got off behind the rest of the tourists, they carried their bags onto the decking where they walked along the platform and came to a stop halfway, eyes scanning the area to see if they could find Tony who said he’d be meeting them.
“You came down here to say hello, after six months of running away and completely avoiding me?” Steve said crossly, Tony’s prediction was just about right. “Don’t give me that bullshit Tony, you’re here because you want something, not to see me. So what is it?”
*****
“Front seat.” She repeated as Peter sent Wade an apologetic smile whilst getting into the back of the car. “I don’t want you groping my nephew.”
“Electric fences!” Thor squeaked as he practically ran back to his seat, instantly typing away speedily on his computer.
The couple felt the sting of the cold water as they hit it with a loud splash, their bodies dropping deep into the river. Peter felt his eyes tingle as he opened them, seeing Wade waving his arms wildly beside him as he began to swim upwards. Peter quickly grabbed him by his ankle, yanking him down to his level. Wade’s eyes widened as he began gesturing this way and that with his hands, Peter clutching his shirt and pointing to the surface, trying to tell him that they had to wait. Wade peered up and saw why. The Foniassaurus was still there, peeking over the cliff into the water, as if waiting for them to come back up so that it could snatch them.
The teenager’s head shot up at the urgency in Wade’s voice as he called him, and was surprised to see the man running full sprint towards him with a mad grin on his face. Peter was about to ask him what the hell was going on when his boyfriend grabbed a hold of his hand and yanked him off the bench.
Steve hummed, eyes going back to the screen. He felt his heart quicken as he saw the dinosaur’s tracking dot close in on the Shield agents, meaning they were almost there, almost gaining on the Foniassaurus. “They’re walking into a trap, Tony.” He practically whispered. “I meant what I said, they’re not going to kill her, she’s too smart.”
“Tony, now’s not the time.” Steve said calmly. “We need to figure out what to do next.”
“Tony!” Steve called again. “Tony, stop!”
“Exactly!” He boomed, fingers skidding across the keyboard. “We may have different fences located around the park, but their all for the dinosaurs that are less… shall we say carnivorous.”
Wade had threatened under his breath to grab the baby and toss it into the overhead locker, which resulted in a painful jab to his ribs from Peter. Well, if there was one good thing about flying it was the constant entertainment he got from sitting next to his boyfriend.
“Peter?” Tony shouted down the phone in annoyance, before the line went completely dead and all he could hear was a high pitched buzz. Tony stared down at his phone for what felt like hours before looking up and sharing a concerned look with Steve.
Peter chuckled. “That’s
“Thanks, Steve.”
“What?”
The Pterodactyl had him in his claws, and was flying him in the direction of the information centre, all the while Loki was kicking his legs out, scratching at the creature’s talons, anything to get it to drop him. But the dinosaur wouldn’t let up, and without warning it turned around and flew back the other way, heading right for the gigantic pool. Loki panicked even more, knowing if the Pterodactyl did drop him when they were across the large pond, he wouldn’t have a chance in there either, knowing what lurked beneath the deep waters.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Most kids get left with a sum of money when their asshole fathers hit the bucket, and what do I get? A tech company and a bunch of dinosaurs.”
As she came to a clearing she stopped abruptly, her stomach turning at the sight of one of her soldiers on the ground, his body torn in half. She scanned the area as hurriedly as she could, not wasting time in rushing over to the body on the ground and picking up the vast gun that was dropped beside him. With slippery fingers she clicked the lock off, wiping the splatters of blood off the gun’s side with the end of her sleeve.
“What do we do now?” An agent asked beside Natasha.
“It can do that remember,” Steve said calmly, trying his best to keep Tony from completely losing it. “At least we know Peter and Wade are okay, we’ll go to where they were last seen and we’ll bring them back. Okay?”
” Thor said in all seriousness. “
“Charles!” Steve then called over to a Shield man as he thought of a plan, shooting down one of the creatures. The boy named Charles came running over, huffing and puffing in his haste. “Gather some of the team, you need to get these people out of here and to the docks, you understand? They’re our main priority, the ships should be here by now! Make sure you get the wounded aboard first.”
Loki froze in the middle of the street, and turned around as an ear-splitting squawk reached his ears. His green eyes widened in terror, as metres above him a Pterodactyl came lunging down straight towards him, wings spread wide and mouth agape. Loki quickly turned back around, and made a dash for the centre, not looking back, and gasping for breath. But it was no use. Next thing he knew, Loki felt something sharp wrap around his shoulders and under his arms, and he cried in alarm as he was being lifted off the ground and into the air.
“Not a word,” Thor shrugged. “We lost track of them earlier when trying to sort out the guests. I’ll give him a call.”
So the engineer did.  It didn’t take long to realise what Steve was referring to, as etched in the muddy pathway were two sets of footprints, running for yards ahead of them and leading deeper into the forest.
Natasha gritted her teeth, slowly taking the gun into her hands. “I’m sorry guys.” She whispered into the com. “I can’t run.”
As the engineer pressed down on the handle to the control room’s door, he took a deep breath and pushed. Tony slowly made his way inside, prepared to see a room full of workers frantically running around, giving orders and preparing for what was to come next. What he wasn’t expecting was for everyone to be sitting at their posts, silent, all eyes turning to him as he wandered in. Tony could feel the blood drain from his face at their sombre expressions, even Thor had the face of someone who’d been crushed.
Tony groaned. “Don’t compare me to him.”
The engineer laughed. “Lighten up Bruce, I’ve been spewing bullshit for years, it’ll be fine.”
“Or…” Wade thought to himself, slipping around Peter to grip the handle of the door. “It could be filled with cotton candy and beef burgers.”
“No need,” Thor said, pointing a finger at the door. “I called them as soon as it happened.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Don’t be.” He said softly. “I should have put my foot down, I shouldn’t have let them walk out that door.”
Thor laughed joyfully. “Why, it is Energy Bolt.” He said in his English accent, holding up a can. “It’s delicious!”
Steve just nodded in reply, he wanted to say what he thought, but he didn’t think repeating himself would be the best thing to do, besides, Tony already knew what he thought about the mission. So he kept his mouth shut, instead, he watched as the Shield agents van came to a halt on the screen. Everyone in the room held their breath.
“He’s out in the park, Tony,” Steve answered him, trying his best to keep his tone of voice composed. “He’s probably enjoying himself with his boyfriend, just keep trying.”
Schmidt laughed loudly. “Ever the joker, Mr Rogers.” He gave a salute to them both before retreating with a big grin on his face. “Say hello to your raptors for me won’t you?” he called back as he got into his truck and sped off onto the road.
“Damn it!” Steve cursed, trying his best to reach under the seat and retrieve it. Through all the movement and panic, Peter was on it too, but to no avail, the phone was lost.
Bruce just stood there like he’d been stunned. His eyes flickered from Tony to Steve, mouth agape, not quite able to speak. Tony’s words repeated in his head over and over, and out of the blue he just began to laugh. Tony and Steve shared a look of confusion.
*****
The long, deafening ring kept on going. It rang and rang, and the more it rang the more Tony felt like he was going to throw up.
“God, Steve.” Tony chocked, naturally putting an arm around the other’s back, and gently pushing a strand of hair away from his face with his free hand. “I… I thought… shit, I… I love you, Steve.” Tony blurted out, not giving a damn this time, because he had to tell him the truth. “I love you so, so much, Steve, I’m so sorry, I-,”
The crashing sound of the Foniassaurus was right behind them, its heavy breathing so close they could feel it on the back of their necks. Neither of them wanted to turn, too afraid that if they did the creature would be way too close for comfort.
Tony couldn’t help the smile that grew on his face, and was about to let out exactly how much he’d missed Steve too, until a loud noise caught both their attention somewhere north. It sounded like an engine, a very old, raspy engine that belonged to some kind of jeep.
“Why would there-,” Wade’s eyes widened, and a cheeky grin slowly crept onto his face. “Oh, honey bear, you are so smart.” He said as he placed a sloppy, wet kiss onto an unsuspecting Peter’s lips.
“Steve?” Tony swallowed the growing lump in his throat, suddenly feeling sick to the stomach. “Please, tell me that’s not what I think it is.”
*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*
“Thor, your energy is sky high every time I see you.” Tony said, eyes scanning the security feeds. “What do you take, and where can I find some?”
“My name’s Loki, I work for your uncle,” he said with a sigh. “I’m
Wade took it and gave it a shake. “Twenty bucks says he’ll pee pee in his girly panties.”
Bruce groaned, knowing exactly what he was going to say. “The cuttlefish can change colour of its skin.” He said to Tony, who by now was confused. All the dinosaur lingo was starting to make his head spin. “It can blend into its surroundings, be invisible if it wanted.”
Tony turned to Thor. “Get Shield on the line.”
Steve simply smiled, resting a hand on the older man’s arm comfortingly. “Let’s go.”
“That’s my boy!” Wade hollered.
“You were meant to meet me on the helipad, we’re late for our meeting.” He said as he turned and stormed through the doors.
“Wade,” Peter sighed, tugging out the shoe and tossing it at the other man. Wade caught it with an oomph, mud splattering everywhere. “I said there is no dinosaur you idiot.”
The drive to the dinosaur’s enclosure didn’t seem any more promising though. The ten minute ride felt more like a ten hour ride. Tony had stuck the radio on quietly in the background as he drove off, Steve sitting beside him tight-lipped, looking at anything but Tony.
“Would be quite the entertainment, yeah.” Scott smirked.
“What’s the matter, Petey? Scared of the dark?” he grinned. “Don’t you worry, I’ll protect you from the big, bad dinosaur.” he said, wiggling his eyebrows up and down. “We could even make out under the scary, decomposing tree I see over there.”
Peter dove out of the front seat so Tony could take over, the teenager being pulled into the back seat by Steve who’d already climbed inside. The four were safely in the jeep before another thunderous thud made the vehicle jolt tremendously.
So that’s where Tony drove them. Steve and he sped through an open gate into one of the main fields of the park, sporting one of the island’s best rides, where guests could drive around amongst the dinosaurs and watch them through the safety of the vehicles. Thankfully all the jeeps were back at the starting point, none of them out in the open, which meant the employees had done their job and gotten all the guests out of there. But all wasn’t in one-piece, as Tony drove down the grassy field and noticed something off.
Tony didn’t give a damn that he was probably going way over the speed limit, right now he had to get to the control room before that creature so much as got halfway to the public part of the park. Heart racing, hands shaking, Tony hastily snatched a hold of his phone and dialled the control room number, hoping to God there wasn’t some kind of failure in the system like there had been days ago.
Tony nodded, earning an annoyed look from the blonde. “Jesus, Tony.” He shook his head in disbelief. “Your nephew is here and you’re not spending your time with him?”
Tony laughed, nodding as he remembered Steve telling him that when he’d thrown one of the dead rats at the animal. “Yeah, well, I just taste that good.” The blonde shook his head with a toothy smile. “It’s good to see you smile, you know.”
But before Steve could turn around and warn the other two, he heard something. It was a noise he did not want to be hearing this close up. The deep, growling grew into a loud grumble as Steve spun around slowly with his phone still at his ear, Tony’s panicking voice calling out his name.
Maria said happily as she hugged him by the neck and cried with joy, Steve bit his lower lip so as not to cry while stroking her baby's back-
-As my husband knows, Steve has not been able to go these last missions to be busy with the army. There is a mission that is a bit complicated, so that's why I quoted everyone here. I apologize for not being able to call them at the base, but I have to take care of four Stark-Rogers chitauris and take care of the company so I have been with meetings all day ...
-Very good children, today I have a surprise one of their parents came to visit them
- Complicated boss tomorrow? -There was one of the Angels of God, Virginia Potts looked at Tony amusedly from the entrance with a glass of coffee in his hand and a folder, Tony smiled happily, that woman did know him. Too bad that theirs didn't work because Tony saw her as a sister just like Pepper saw Tony as a brother-son, besides that 25 centimeters were not easily overcome.
His cheeks blushed a little while the brunette smiled triumphantly, laughter was heard behind them.
-I love you pops, and come back soon I miss your stories. Daddy Tony's are scary, ”said a small blonde with captivatingly brown eyes, carrying in his arms a small stuffed animal of Captain America better known as“ tsum tsum America ”hugs him tightly while smiling happily at his father
Peter mentioned with his eyes full of tears, his body reacted almost throwing himself over me and hugging me by the neck, I brought my hands behind his back to caress him
Maria watched in confusion as Peter and Harley ran their hands over their faces and sank into the chair
-Aaagh, the bad thing about pops coming back is that we will have to see them so sticky -Harley said while sitting at the end of that table with Peter and Maria watching as Tony had Johnny in his arms and Steve was beside him hugging him by his waist While listening to Tony's plan for that mission, his uncles looked at the scene with amusement and tenderness since occasionally Tony steals kisses from Steve and he blushes or just laughs. Nat was amused to see Sharon's face of boredom and grief at seeing that.
-Tony, you must come. -Explained the agitated redhead, she was a little scared-
-Greet me Tony and the children, okay? Tell them I'll be there soon, ”Rodhey said with a smile shaking hands with Steve, James had been able to make his life again after there was no hope for him to walk again, but thanks to Tony and his wonderful inventions (only some, most are dangerous for children) he was able to walk again and continue fighting for his country and his people.
I started talking while I had all the avengers more present to Coulson, Hill and Carter who were the agents that would help us in the mission, sometimes the words were going to be admired as Johnny played with his stuffed dinosaur and why he remembered Steve , he should be in charge of this meeting and I sat admiring my husband with Johnny in my arms, as he frowned as he looked at the maps and fighting tactics, as his left eyebrow was raised when he heard any recommendation we were giving or how their shone when his gaze fell on Johnny and me ...
-I love you, take care, yes? They're calling me, we'll talk tomorrow- Rogers sent them a kiss and cut off the communication while everyone said goodbye very happy, when the screen turned black everything returned to its normal rhythm, Maria squeezed her teddy bear, Harley frowned and Peter erased his smile.
Perhaps they save themselves from the speech of their pops -Tony said while looking at the map, his older children paid attention to him as well as his uncles who stopped talking at the moment looking at Tony- But they will not be saved from the screams tonight, There's a lot of time to recover, Rogers.
-Pops ...
-It's Steve ...- And when he said that I felt that my heart was slowly stopping, the room was spinning and before anyone spoke or if someone said something I did not hear it since I had run away, take out my cell phone while swallowing, My throat was dry. I looked for Steve's number but he didn't answer me, I got desperate little by little, dodged one of my workers. Why were they all out of their places of work and looking at someone? I frowned and approached little by little, I dropped my cell phone when I came to the front of that crowd of people, there I stood in front of my eyes with a funny smile and his military uniform (which all this, he looked delicious) Steve Rogers, on one side and really funny were our children looking at me, not even I knew what my face was when I saw my husband there, my legs were shaking just like my lips. But I forced my brain to send the order to my walking legs, and when I did it I did it slowly to then run and throw myself into his arms by winding my legs to his hip, I searched his lips desperately to kiss him and when I could touch that My mouth shook from head to toe, my God had missed him so much and I knew that like me he had done it too since it was a desperate kiss, needed to show us the love we had and how we had missed each other, I felt the Salty kiss but I didn't care, it didn't matter that everyone was watching us if I felt we were both alone.
-I'm glad you're here Captain, Peter has been a little distracted lately but I know that now with his presence he will be able to rejoice again
Clint, Nat, Bucky and Sam watched with tenderness and emotion that scene while Steve could not retain some tears trying to get out of his eyes, he was on his way home.
He let out a sigh and turned in his chair to look at his children.
He moved to the left to take off a teammate, sighed when he saw that he would have no other way out than to throw towards the goal since those of the opposing team made him a wall, begged Domino to have his luck and be able to make the goal, looked at his He then aimed the ball and threw it into the corner. The cheerleaders who supported them shouted with joy, Harley put an arm to his forehead, wiping away sweat, he would have responded with a flirtatious smile but now, he was tired, exhausted ... he was sad.
They shouted the two chestnut trees making the room explode in funny laughter and Tony smiled with determination
-Dad, no!
Buck said with a smile opening his water bottle and drinking a little, Steve smiled happily at last after so long he would be home.
-Happy Congratulations
-Pepper I'm in a meeting, then I ret ...- But he looked at me with his desperate face-
Peter and Harley looked confused as the avengers held their laughter and Steve lowered his head in shame, when the children of the leaders realized they opened their eyes with surprise.
The director began handing him the diploma along with the medal that was on his neck to Harry, moved to the side and did the same with MJ, when he was in front of me he smiled.
I dried her tears as she smiled at him and placed her medal giving him a hug again, she was coming home.
-Come on, there are many things to do and you have a meeting at 14:00 P.M with the avengers and some agents. And remember that it was you who decided to have children
-Well ... Okay, let's sleep boys tomorrow is another day and they have a lot to do. Maria to brush your teeth, give me Johnny I'll take care of him now
Yes, damn I missed him so much sometimes I felt that the air was missing when I stopped listening to his voice at the end of the video call. I was explaining the tactics plan when Pepper opened the meeting room door
-I came back my little kite, how I promised you, I'm about to get home ...
He asked for the pass again while running on the court, he recalled his first official football game when his parents were supporting them together with his uncles, brothers and grandfather Fury. This time he felt so happy, there was no danger, his pops were next to him ...
He saw Clint open the car door for seconds after letting a sleeping Johnny see his bear Ironman, Steve smiled happily and his eyes filled with tears left the bag and backpack on the floor to take Johnny in his arms who took stirred in those arms-
-They will be fine, it's just ground scoring, and Rodhey and Carol will be in charge to help them.
-This becomes more complicated every day -Tony sighed while looking at Johnny-
-I'm glad you are well, we'll see you soon, I promise you, -said a man with a tired smile but happy to see them, his blond hair and his deep blue eyes watched with adoration behind the screen. A beard that made him look more mature adorned his perfect face-
-Look soldier, I know that this is important for everyone here but I think I also need a little rest, many of you have been able to see your family, I haven't known anything about them for six months just by video call, Carol Danvers is One of the best pilots who left the National Aeronautical Guard and James Rodhey is the best lieutenant he has had in the last century within the forces, they will not be lost without me. They have them, now I can leave because my flight is waiting for me.
-And that's why today you won't receive a good night story, little spoiled- Stark replied old.
The director approached me with a smile and handed me Peter's medal and diploma.
-They don't know what a surprise they will take, brother
-Hey, Cap.! I have your first surprise - Barton said with a smile while Steve raised an eyebrow looking worried, when Barton said that it was necessary to be careful not for something he conspired with Sam, Scott and Loki to make mischief for the complex.
Carol winked at her as she smiled, satisfied with her achievement since Steve had her cheeks flushed and a shy smile, she knew that as men they could not father but she had understood Carol's reference and of course she would give him, not children but if she would give him love otherwise
