“But some of it looks real…”
“Not in so many words, but yes, essentially.”
Dean’s left hand lay open in his lap, fingers curled, and Cas reached down to brush his knuckles gently. How many times had he healed that hand? Inclining his head just an inch or two, he dared to plant a kiss in his friend’s hair. Never had he been quite so brave, or presumed to be so intimate—but it felt right. Castiel wished fervently that he could feel this closeness as a human would—Dean’s warmth, the smell of his body, the touch of his hair against Castiel’s lips. It wasn’t meant to be, perhaps—but he was at the very least thankful for what it
Dean handed Castiel the tweezers, then turned, dropped his towel to the floor, and crawled up to kneel on the edge of the bed. Ass in the air, thighs spread, he reached a hand around to gesture at his backside. “See it?” he asked through his teeth.
Between his spread thighs, Castiel’s cock stood full and flushed, blue-veined and pink-headed and fucking magnificent, and Dean’s mouth filled with saliva.
angel… the best thing that had ever happened to him…
Dean was speechless for a moment, wondering if he was actually going to get another hard-on from that suggestion. His dick’s recovery attempt was valiant.
Cas wasn’t sure he liked that plan as much—he’d rather be with Dean in the thick of the action. But Sam did have a point…
“Mmm.” The angel trailed fingers down the side of his face and neck, and Dean felt the tingle of grace, soothing his sore jaw. “I was moved by your enthusiasm for pleasing me.”
“You’re just traumatized, ok? It’s… it’s PTSD, you know? It happens to me all the time… to Sam, too. You just gotta find a way to cope for a little while. It’ll stop… it’ll get better.”
Jack waited expectantly.
“It’s mesmerizing,” Cas observed from the back seat.
Dean eyeballed him. “So what, uh… what the hell
Before Cas finished tucking the space blanket around him, he was asleep.
“Whack off… you mean masturbate?”
Back in his bedroom at the bunker, he closed the door behind him and turned to Cas. “Just me and you now, buddy,” he told the angel. “And it’s your turn…”
“Yes, I am,” Cas admitted, and reached out impulsively to touch Jack’s hair, run a thumb along the outer shell of his ear. He’d never felt Jack with human fingers before. Jack’s skin was even softer than Dean’s.
Dean sounded even more mightily annoyed, then he burst into stifled laughter. Cas wasn’t sure which was worse; it had been a long while since he’d felt more ignorant. “You
Castiel’s eyes narrowed, but he held Dean’s gaze.
Jack reached down and touched Castiel’s hand. “I’m really ok,” he said earnestly.
Castiel thought about how Dean’s soul opened to him in Hell, releasing all, trusting completely, and he smiled. “You can to me, Dean.”
Dean yanked the bathroom door open again, looking even more mightily provoked. “It’s on my balls,” he said tightly, “And it’s dug in. One of you clowns needs to help me.”
Dean stood up, turning, and shoved his hands in his pockets. Conversation over. “You know what I mean,” he said darkly. “Just keep it in your pants.”
Dean groaned, and giving in to his baser impulses, Castiel grabbed him by the ass cheek and pulled until Dean had him pinned against the wall.
“Because I’m better and faster at it, that’s why.”
“Thank you, but I don’t need you to.”
“You don’t say... What’s her name?” Dean sounded suspicious.
“You’re still naked,” Jack observed, in his outside voice. From behind the bathroom door, Dean winced. Yeah, it was kinda dark in the house, but he could still picture Castiel’s well-mussed sex hair, his dick hanging long and loose. God knows he could even have Dean’s jizz on his face—he hadn’t had time to check.
“Of course. Jack is my charge and he is very important. I do care for him as well. But you and I,” and here Castiel cupped Dean’s face in his warm, smooth hand, “we are
“Stop. My grace is returning to normal, thanks to you. Or at least normal for lately. Now it’s your turn for healing.” Cas smiled gently and continued his ministrations, holding Dean’s gaze. Dean shifted a little, felt his knee bump into Castiel’s. The pain in his head vanished, replaced by refreshing clarity, and he sighed in relief. Cas’ hand slipped down to his shoulder, fingers light on his bare skin. “Hmm,” Cas purred, a soothing sound. “Your shoulder is painful, too.”
“Thought you said it was all the same to you. Drinking beer, road tripping, hand jobs… no difference.”
Dean spiked an eyebrow as Sam removed his gloves, then slid a hand into Castiel’s hair and pulled him closer. What the ever-loving…?
So he did, with some urgency, lapping and twirling and licking and sucking like a porn star, following his tongue with a hand now, slurping and moaning with abandon. It was
“I want you to know why I couldn’t let you die, why I went back for you,” Dean recited solemnly.
“Bringing you pleasure is intoxicating to me,” Cas purred. “And making you ejaculate was incredibly stimulating.”
I just couldn’t say it…” Now he was blubbering like a baby… “but then you died and I realized I
“At least four… I believe five,” Castiel answered. His grace could sense their dark energies moving around the house next door—a brick colonial-style home in a 1940s suburb. The neighborhood in Dearborn, Michigan was quiet and upscale—not a place where screaming and violence were normal nightly occurrences. It would be hard to break in and kill five vampires without rousing the neighbors and inviting police attention.
“Yeah, but you’ve been human,” Sam offered. “You had a soul
It was wonderful.
Dean knew better. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him, groped for the nightlight he’d seen plugged in over the sink. Finally put a hand on it and flipped it on. He was afraid for a hot second that he’d see the terrible, black fissures spreading over Castiel’s skin again—but the tiny light only revealed Castiel’s vessel to be whole and his skin healthy. The angel’s face told a different story.
“Hey,” Dean whispered, “try to rest.”
“Cas has only seen it 99 times,” Dean quipped.
That’s when it began.
“Evidence that Dean is showering? Why is the door locked?”
“So you wanna just sit here?!”
“But I’ve never been to the garden.”
at me for a while. So I think we should stop right here.”
“It’s always been you. You are everything to me.”
“Well it’s pretty goddamn lame on my part,” Dean growled. He was still guilt-tripping from leaving Cas’s ass in Hell—and just when he didn’t think he could be a shittier pal…
He moved to pull his t-shirt out of his jeans, so as to wipe his face, and realized it had been torn nearly in half when the shifter grabbed him. “Ugh…” Second good shirt he’d lost this month.
Cas looked somewhat nonplussed. “I don’t need a snack.”
“No… no it don’t work that way.”
“Dean, there’s nothing wrong with your penis. Just because it’s a little shorter…”
“Yeah?”
“Huh. I knew it,” Dean replied. “Any sign of the girl?”
Castiel blinked at him in the dark, lips glistening. “You can feel my vibration?” There was a certain breathlessness to his question.
“But if it’s still deep…”
“Turn the heat up some more,” he grumbled.
Dean snorted. “Let’s hope,” he replied. Then he cleared his throat and prepared to be dad-like. “So you, uh, you enjoying the movie?”
Cas rolled his eyes, then reached two fingers up to Dean’s temple and sent a gentle jolt of grace through him. Dean gasped a little, but stood there wide-eyed, staring at Cas. Castiel let his fingers linger, feeling the creature’s energy, the place where it had attached to Dean and begun feeding on his blood. The grace made the tick squirm and convulse, but it only tightened its grip against the onslaught and kept on sucking.
Dean took his hands out of his gloves and blew on his fingers to try to warm them. “If we can’t open the door in time, Sam,” Cas was saying, “and Michael arrives, it will be nearly impossible to stop him.”
Sam followed Dean down off the screened porch, skipping the step, Jack and Cas behind.
“Of course. But I’m afraid that when you come out of this altered state, you will remember this conversation with some regret. You won’t want to have sex with me, and you might not even want to
Jack hollered at the Empty, trying a different tack.
Dean frowned. Nearly told him to get the stick out of his ass and get in the water before Dean knocked him in. But then it struck him—this wasn’t about Jack, really—this was about Cas. About what had happened to Cas last time he went near a lake. Flashing back to the sight of Cas wading into the water until he disappeared—being dragged under by the Leviathan writhing inside of him—Dean shuddered. The water suddenly seemed much cooler.
Dean scrambled off the bed, nearly tripping over his own feet. “Cas,” he hissed. “Cas!” He barely had time to scoot his ass into the bathroom before Sam and Jack barged in.
“Just once… can’t we try just once?”
The glove box squeaked closed again. “I’ll just
“Not soulless.”
anyhow. What he
“If you can’t sleep,” Cas suggested, “would you like to watch TV with me? That always relaxes you.” He lifted his eyes and Dean met his gaze.
He opened his eyes; Castiel’s hands were still on him, holding him gently but firmly, and the angel met his gaze from just a few inches away. His friend’s brow had a little furrow in the middle that Dean wanted to take a thumb to and smooth out. “It’s all good,” Dean blurted. “Thanks to you. Me and Sam mighta turned into popsicles if you weren’t here.”
“It’s all the same to me, Dean. I enjoy any sort of intimacy with you. I like riding in your car, or drinking at the bar, or watching Netflix together, or talking on the phone. I would also enjoy sex, I’m sure.”
“You even watching the movie?”
All that blood flow to his extremities… well, once his fingers and toes had regained their warmth and flexibility, his dick had also begun to come to life. He didn’t know if it was having a warm body so close, or the little extra pumping his heart was doing, or both—but he was popping a chubby in his jeans, and it was getting harder and harder to ignore.
Wonder after wonder.
“Cas,” he gasped, reaching behind him,” put your hand back on my…”
“He seems inordinately upset,” Castiel said.
“No part of me is little,” Cas growled.
“Your blade will kill,” the grinning TV judge proclaimed, and Dean lifted the remote impulsively and switched the set off. He clunked his empty beer bottle down on the nightstand.
“You probably need to urinate,” Cas declared beside him. “I will pump gas. Leave me your credit card.”
, or is that the
“True dat,” Dean grunted. So maybe… maybe if Cas warmed
“… your ancient ass notwithstanding, you’re still getting the looks from the ladies. More than I am nowadays.”
“Can I suck yours first?” Castiel asked breathlessly, and just at that moment, the front door squeaked open, bells jangling, and Dean jerked away.
With his hands on his friend’s warm skin, Dean suddenly became super-conscious of their proximity. They were inches apart, the sink pressing into Dean’s lower back. And Cas was buck naked, for God’s sake. Dean found himself speechless.
Dean popped off, breathless. “Soothing? I must be doing it wrong.”

Dean snorted. “Why
Castiel slammed the bunker door open, lurching into the darkness outside. He could feel the cool of the night, the breeze in his hair, but he couldn’t see where he was going. He couldn’t see. It was dark—so dark—not even a moon and he was human and he couldn’t see, and he stopped fifty yards down the dark access road, under the trees, and stood panting in his shirtsleeves.
“Come on in, man,” Dean pled gently. “You’ll be glad you did.” He pushed himself backwards into the water, treading again. “See, it feels awesome.”
“Yeah, I’m thinking… maybe we need to go back with dowsing rods or something.”
Castiel took Dean’s left hand and placed it near his heart. “Here,” he said. Then he took Dean’s right hand and placed it low on his ribcage, over the place the spear had pierced him. “And here.” He stood very still and opened his eyes to meet Dean’s.
“Dean…” Castiel whispered beside him.
Dean held the covers open, so Cas could slide underneath this time, and settled down to make himself comfortable next to his friend. It was weird, having Cas beside him without clothes; he’d so seldom seen the angel without his multiple layers. Castiel’s body seemed so much thinner without the trench coat. So much more human. Except for the way he lay on his back stiffly and stared at the ceiling.
“I could fuck you,” Cas suggested casually. “I’m sure you’d enjoy my penis inside you more than you enjoyed the Cartwright twins’ dildo.”
So Cas did.
Thanks again for reading. Comments are oh-so-delicious to the author, so please be generous! Hope you liked.
Cas curled his fingers around the steering wheel, wishing he could touch Dean, reassure him. But this raw openness rarely happened face to face—unless alcohol was involved. He dropped his voice another octave. “We are bonded. There is nothing to be done about that but to surrender to it. I have already surrendered. When will you?”
“Would you rather your brother did it?”
“Yeah… not anymore.”
“Kiss me,” Cas insisted, breathless. “Kiss me so you don’t cry out.”
, didn’t you? Didn’t you say you thought Metatron…”
“Yeah?”
“That is
“Let me help.” Dean felt Cas’ fingers nudge his out of the way, and close over the top of his right ear, then his left. Then there it was, that little injection of icy-hot grace: too cold at first, then so deliciously warm and soothing. Sometimes when Cas healed him he couldn’t help but let out an embarrassing moan—it was too much like sliding into a deliciously hot bath. But this time it was only his ears warming—and an “Ooh, yeah” didn’t seem out of line.
Cas smiled against his mouth. “Now I can feel your kisses.”
“I just need a short rest. After everything that’s happened.”
Jack nodded despite the coughing.
still offer his friends—his family—was love and companionship. He could eat and drink with them, touch and soothe them, cook them food that would taste good. He could feel and smell and see and hear his family the way other humans did.
“What if it doesn’t work? We’re in the ditch, Dean! It’s getting dark. If we’re stuck out here tonight, we need to be visible and keep the tailpipe open so we can keep warm. We can’t get buried or we’ll be here come spring!”
“This won’t be particularly relaxing, Dean.”
“Sinking?” Now he was puzzled. “Sinking how?”
“Ok. I like those odds. You wait right there; Sam and I’ll be right over.”
“Alright,” he agreed, despite sounding a bit nervous. “Teach me.”
Cas’ eye roll was visible even in the dark. He was getting better at that, Dean thought.
“The… uh…” Dean felt a flush rising up his neck again. He leaned over and snatched the beer bottle from the top of the dresser, went to take a pull, remembered it was empty. He dug his nails furiously into the label. Took a deliberate breath.
“It’s as up as it gets,” Sam replied.
So did it really just come down to him being chicken shit? And why? It wasn’t like Cas was going to smite him for coming out. Perhaps it was that Cas
“I’m not afraid of water. And I don’t see any horses,” Cas said coolly, looking away. But he squatted down in front of Dean.
Cas smiled tenderly at him. “You were enjoying it so much, I didn’t want to ruin it for you.”
But Dean couldn’t rest. Everything he’d wanted to say to Cas in the past six weeks—hell, the past six years—was bubbling up inside him. Some tiny voice on a distant shore in the back of his head was crying
Castiel thought now.
Dean couldn’t help but beam. His heart swelled another size. “Yeah. Yeah, we are.”
Subtly, the warmth began to morph into something more than physical heat. Heart beating strongly, he began to feel expansive. Open and unguarded. A little giddy, perhaps, but focused.
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean interrupted. “I’m just tryin’ to say, I’m so glad you’re here with us, popsicles or no. It just… it means everything to have you back, man.”
“Fuck…” Dean breathed.
“Yes, but very quietly. I don’t want to broadcast on angel radio, as you might say.”
angel, dammit.
Cas was unamused. “He could have drowned.”
“I’m afraid not,” Castiel replied.
“Jesus, you got that right. But c’mon, Jack and Sam are gonna be along any minute. What can I do to get you off?”
“Dude… it’s not f…funny out there. S… start the car.”
“I’m speaking to the tick.”
“Now, just try to breathe and rest quietly,” Cas told him.
Castiel began opening his tie, then unbuttoning his own shirt while Dean watched, panting, in the semi-darkness. He undid five buttons, then took one of Dean’s hands and slid it inside, against his breast. “Touch me,” the angel whispered.
“Oh… wow…” Sam chuckled deep in his throat, which sounded a little pervy, and Dean felt a funny pang as Sam proceeded to put his arms around the angel. “This is
They watched the movie companionably, munching their popcorn, Dean drawing his bare feet up underneath him for warmth, which caused their thighs to press together comfortably. Castiel didn’t move over, because Dean didn’t ask him to. When the movie ended, Dean found a program about giant squid—which also never got old—and they watched that in silence together, until Dean’s head began to nod.
He looked at Cas, who still stood behind him. “Got your swim trunks?”
“Uungh… you can say that again.”
Castiel had finally admitted to himself (with only mild chagrin) that his grace responded to Dean as if he were God. Perhaps that should have disturbed him more than it did. The angel rang like a temple bell in Dean’s presence; the mere sound of Dean’s voice sent pulse waves through his grace. Mystified at first, he’d found himself standing close, staring deeply into Dean’s eyes, just absorbing his soul’s brilliance and warmth and feeling the reverberation of their bond—until he realized that made Dean uncomfortable. After that, he’d become a little more circumspect, trying to give Dean his
“Jack,” Castiel murmured to the boy, touching his arm.
Jack looked thoughtful for a minute, then a flush rose in his face as it apparently dawned on him that he’d been caught out. “Oh,” he muttered. “Ok. Sorry.”
“What’s a loon?”
surrender,” Dean whispered.
“You weren’t ready.”
“Aw c’mon, Sam, you like this one—it has whales in it.”
Dean glanced at him, then away. He softened his tone. “I dunno man, I… I’m happy to have the kid back, in spite of it all. Even happier he’s got his soul again, and he knows he fucked up. It’s… it feels like a win somehow. And we really need a win right now, y’know?”
,” Dean countered.
“Hey,” Dean said. “Don’t be scared. You know I got you. I got this. You don’t have to do a thing.”
Sam’s voice hit him like another cold soaking.

“Oh yes… well, you can too, but I can see it much better. This is…”
“Twenty below ain’t a joke.”
Dean threw up his hands. “Holy Jesus, now
So here it was, he realized—the hidden gift. Only hours earlier, he had wished again that he could experience Dean with human senses. His wish was granted! Perhaps he could no longer heal his friends with his grace, or smite their enemies with one hand—but that hardly mattered in a fight against
At least too old to give a shit about somebody else’s idea of manhood anymore. Hell, he’d saved the world a few times over. If anybody wanted to give him a hard time about cuddling with a dude angel, they could fuck off to… well, where-ever. He’d earned this. And it was nice, just laying with Cas, touching a little, making his angel feel good. Even if Sam did wake up and see them, what was he gonna say?
Castiel is tired of waiting on Dean to come around - is there a way to seduce him? And what DID he do with the Cartwright twins?
a monumental dumbass… dude… the
“You really think we’re going to dig our way out of this?” Sam yelled, pulling his hat down over his ears.
being naked. To be honest, the fact that Dean was naked as the day he was born and his husband was still fully clothed was
The man nodded. “I do. It makes the 6 am shift a little more bearable.”
He never thought he’d be brave enough to give Dean his phone number when he returned the next day, and never expected to go on a date with the man less than a week later.
Sam’s smile appeared slowly. “Why do you need him to know I’m your brother?”
Castiel’s musing was interrupted by the sound of quiet footsteps slowly making their way down the hall outside the door. It was only his angelic hearing and military training that helped him pick out the slight tap of a low heeled shoe on the carpet. The heavy gait told him whoever was coming was a male human, and still twenty to thirty feet away by his estimation. He approached his door and waited, sure that the only reason someone would be walking past his room past nine would be for him, and sure enough, the steps paused outside his door, and after a pause and long sigh, they knocked.
“I hope it's ok that I’m here. I know you’re not allowed to see Dean until the ceremony, but I wasn’t sure if it was the whole family, or just him.”
“I was warned you didn’t like angels.”
“Yes, Mr. Novak. I’d like to set up a meeting between both parties.”
Dean smiled wickedly and used his other hand to push the loose shirt up, exposing Cas’s nipples. “Sensitive, are you?”
Cas turned to glare. “Well, stop sayin.”
He pulled over to the side of the freeway immediately, put on his hazards, and prayed that highway patrol wouldn’t drive past him. The absolute last thing he needed was a ticket when he was on a time crunch. His watch told him it was 7:35 am, so there was a huge chance he could see his soulmate pass him on the highway. He sat there, staring hard at the mass of cars, trying to make out a blur of gold in the mess.
“I could help?” he offered.
“We can test your theory another time, then.”
“No,” she corrected, “he’s bisexual.”
Dean were at fault for the regularity of their lovemaking.
Soon, it was time for the ceremonial robe, a silver silk monstrosity lined with ermine fur and embroidered with their royal crest. The robe, blessed by their religious leaders, was carefully draped below his wings and then over his shoulders, where it was then clasped around his neck. He immediately felt the weight of it, nearly suffocating him with the expectations of all those who wore it before him.
When Kelly made no reply, they both looked up at her.
He thought back to the way he treated everyone else. The obvious sexist comments, the over the top winks and posing, the smug way he spoke. Then he thought of the blushes Dean would send his way when Cas cocked an annoyed eyebrow at him, or the way he would sometimes hold his breath when he adjusted the costume on his body, and the way he’d stumble over his words when he spoke. ‘
“If I did, I’d never get any work done.”
Michael could have his fake tree and matching ornament set. Cas even stopped caring that they only went to Michael’s parents’ house for Christmas. The one thing he couldn’t have was this. Even when Michael rolled his eyes and called it dumb. Even when Michael played loud music in the kitchen because Castiel refused to pay attention to him when a movie was playing. Even when they were divorced and he cuddled onto the couch with a sleeping Claire in his arms, grateful that he had her in his life. These cheesy movies were his tradition.
“Come on, Cas. That’s not fair. You can’t do the eyebrow thing to me, it's too—”
Two hours later, he finally got his text.
“—redirected the attack, and if he hadn’t—”
Balthazar's expression was a kaleidoscope of emotion. “I see. Well, good for you Cassie. I’d give you a quick explanation but I see him coming and he looks determined, so it appears I won’t have the time.”
Dean, knowing exactly what he was going to say, rushed to climb into Cas’s lap and slap a hand over his mouth. “Don’t you dare finish that sentence.”
He shrugged, trying to appear casual, but no one had called him Cas since his college days, and he was giddy at the idea of Dean using such a familiar nickname. “That’s fine.”
The casual insult brought a smile to his face. “Now that I’m officially a part of the Winchester household, I can agree with your statement. He
Dean must have realized that his car was the only one in the lot, because he stopped Cas with a hand to his shoulder, and turned to him in confusion. “Where’s your car?”
“A little argument?” Cas repeated. Shaking his head, he pulled out his phone and opened his e-reading app. “Look at this quote on page one-hundred and thirty-four—” he showed the bookmarked quote to Dean. “David insults his intelligence, which we know is a soft spot for him because of his abusive father, and tells him to get lost. Seems pretty cut and dry to me. Canonically speaking, Adam is the type of man to hold a grudge. I don’t think he would let David off so easily.”
It was such a foreign idea that he was sure he misheard. “You think I’m attractive?”
“Well, I was smart enough to—” Sam trailed off and glanced towards the tower. “Oh, good… he’s coming!”
“Does it hurt?” Sam asked, interrupting the near orgasmic feeling of relief.
to flirt with you, I’ll never know.”
Cas tightened his arm around Dean’s shoulder. “Even if it’s not painful, it’s very hard to push a baby out of your body, or so I’ve been told.”
After a few minutes, he cleared his throat. “Remember when I said I wanted to talk to you about something?”
Dean found him in the bedroom, face down on the bed with his feet dangling off the edge. The fact that his loafers were still on his feet told Dean all he needed to know. He stood in the doorway for a moment, observing the distressed man. He hoped it wasn’t regret Cas was feeling.
“Still a ten, bitch!”
He threw himself into his work and hobbies, filling his time with reading and sewing Claire little dresses so he wouldn’t have to think about how lonely he was. Before his eyes, she was growing from a baby who scooted along the floor, to a toddler that scampered naked through the house, shrieking in laughter as her flustered dad chased her around with a diaper.
“That’s one of the only things worth watching in these movies.”
“Jack,” Cas repeated. “I like it.”
His skin heated against his will. “I’m not.”
didn’t want to explain how horrible it had gone. “I think I’ll have to wait another year or two for that.”
Castiel let out a burst of laughter at the ridiculousness of his statement. “You thought
“Let’s go.” He pulled Dean along, weaving them out of the crowd and forcing the guards to run to catch up.
Sure, they had tons of lakes in rivers in Lawrence, but nothing beat the silky feeling of warm sand under your feet, the salty breeze, and the hot sun beating down on you. He loved it so much that after he finished his week at Sam’s studio apartment, he was planning on driving the thirty minutes to San Jose for an interview, and if all went well, to apartment hunt. Not that he was going to tell his brother any of that. He’d wait until the last second or maybe just show up to his apartment out of the blue. The bitchface Sam was guaranteed to give him would be worth it.
Dean snorted. “More like I liked how he looked in those breaches.”
It was only when the man answered back with “Huh?” that he realized he had said it out loud.
“$2.95,” he repeated.
“Fuck is right,” Cas agreed, his voice cracking from misuse. He let out a jaw creaking yawn, and snuggled his face into Dean’s shoulder. "Grace will slip through when I'm feeling intense emotions. Battles...sex..."
He chuckled and sniffed, still attempting to keep the tears away. “I was wondering why the last name issue was never an argument. I guess I should have just asked, but I didn’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth.”
“He was. You just didn’t see it.”
Dean grabbed a few more drinks for them and attempted to get the job done, but they ended up talking more than wrapping. By the time they were on their last few items, they had somehow gone through another round of buttered rum (that Dean had added a few extra ounces of rum to), and two spiked hot chocolates.
“Tell that to the poor men and women that you shoot down when we go to the bar.”
“I never received any letters.”
“Yes he is, and they love it. It’s basically his job to propose to every woman he sees, you know.”
“Yeah. I'll never get used to that grace thing...Fucking awesome.”
Cas sucked in a deep breath and nodded quickly. “Really? You want to officially adopt her?”
He felt the strange urge to apologize, but before he could even open his mouth, Dean was already muttering to himself about needing to speak with his father. Dean left, practically pushing his way through the crowd in search of King John, leaving Cas standing there awkwardly.
He played dumb. “What do you mean?”
“I was born at 2:33 in the morning. The only sightings I’ve ever gotten stopped when I was a teenager. The only reason I know I still have a soulmate is because I sometimes wake up after having some very odd dreams.”
“Did you forget that he was also reading law books? Clearly, he’s up to something.”
“My first day here I was trying to find out some information about the notoriety-for-profit law. I googled it, but all I found was a Wikipedia article and I needed something with more legal mumbo-jumbo. I gotta sound like I know what I’m talking about, right?”
“She’ll learn about history from you and cars from me. Sounds pretty well rounded, right?”
The double door slammed open, both sides nearly upending the priceless vases that bordered the room. Everyone jumped as Commander Naomi stormed into the room, her dove gray wings poised to kill. With murder in her eyes, she zeroed in on her brother, the King, and marched to the large desk. As if all attention hadn’t already been on her, she slammed her fists onto the wood for effect. “Where is he?”
“Oh, really?”
The feed was full, Dean had topped it off that morning before work himself, so he knew Cas just wanted him alone for a few minutes so they could have a
“It’s my big day, cut me some slack.” Dean said nothing for a moment, then began again even quieter. “Do you think they’ll miss us if we cut out a little early?”
Cas snorted loudly at the suggestion that Balthazar was
Cas gave him a small smile. “You enjoy it, though. I can tell.”
He gathered Castiel into his arms and climbed into bed with him, hoping that he would fall asleep soon so he could get back to Becky. He let his eyes slide to the alarm clock that was on Michael's bedside table, and the numbers read 2:34 am. Something tickled the back of his mind, but he was too tired to grasp it. Eyes heavy, he began to drift off, when suddenly, he remembered. Castiel, his sweetest child, had been born at 2:31 am. Moisture suddenly filled his eyes as comprehension dawned. After five years of hoping and praying, Castiel Novak finally had his first sighting.
“And you know how I feel about your egg whites on toast. You need a muffin, son.”
He groaned in pain and rubbed at his eyes, hoping to get rid of any errant tears before the lifeguard came back. “I never wanted to know what a ten felt like.”
If that’s what you consider banter, no wonder poor Inias was always such a mess around you!”
He bowed to his father, eyes carefully downcast. “Thank you, Your Majesty.”
He smirked, tapping his nametag. “The name’s Bella.”
Ignoring the bumpy cobble road and the light flickering through the passing trees, he pressed a piece of parchment across his legs and began writing a letter to Cassie.
He took out his phone and aimed it at the baby, taking a few snapshots before putting his phone away. “I have to head back, but let me know when I can bring the girls over. We’ll bring dinner for you guys.”
“No.”
Their cocks rubbed against each other, giving them the friction they both needed to ratchet their arousal even higher.
“What about Michael? From what I can tell, you’re a hundred times better. I was a little worried when you never responded to my letter, but...”
“Hm…” Cas considered the dilemma, not caring at all that their children were kicking Dean’s ass. “I think I’ll save it for lunch tomorrow.”
“We could probably work something out.”
Conscious of the ticking clock, he kept one hand on his own dick and used the other to guide Cas’s tip into his waiting mouth. He groaned at the taste. So clean and fresh from his morning shower, but still a little salty from the precome and the overwhelming musk of
“Right.”
Claire tore it off then and there, flinging the fabric across the room. Neither man had it in them to ruin her excitement by chastising her, so they just watched as she pulled out an old shirt and put on a pair of black tights.
Dean pulled away, letting his head fall back against the spines of the thick books. “God, I wish we had a bed.”
When Castiel was approached and told his marriage was in talks, he accepted it without comment and flew to the palace within the hour, to the deep displeasure of his commander. When he landed in the courtyard, still in his uniform and exhausted from the flight, he was rushed to his rooms by the servants, eager to get him out of his armor before his audience with the king. Instead of his plate and chainmail, he was stuffed into a fine silk shirt, with a waistcoat and matching breeches. His comfortable leather shoes were replaced by long, gartered socks and low heeled shoes. By the time a servant fit him with a matching embroidered coat, he was ready to jump out the window and fly back into battle.
His heart beat loudly in his chest as he waited, poised to go the moment he caught a glimpse of familiar gold. Thirty seconds passed, then forty, and still no sign. He was going to give himself a heart attack if he didn’t calm down, but he didn’t have the time. Any second now, his soulmate’s car would drive past him and he just
Disneyland came to his rescue like he was a princess in a tower. He was hesitant to even apply, but Charlie was able to shake some sense into him.
“You know…” He rubbed a hand over his mouth, clearly embarrassed. “Angels all kinda look… And you don’t really… fit. I’m fucking this up, aren’t I?”
“I’m just sayin…”
at, but he needed the man to pull over now. Once they were face to face, he would be able to explain.
“This isn’t helping. I just want to know if I should ask him out or not.”
A hand rested on his shoulder, Charlie’s blue eyes taking in his pale face. “You ok, Cas?”
“I’m kidding!” Dean snorted in amusement, snuggling even further into Cas’s chest, face smothered between Cas’s pecks as he continued to chuckle. “I’d much rather fuck Castiel, my favorite angel.”
“Relax.”
“I think it helped acting like an ass. Made it feel like I wasn’t actually trading sex for a good grade.”
He gaped at her. “You think the fact that he was looking up tips on how to get away with murder is, what… completely fine?”
“You know… Bruce Wayne?” At Cas’s continued stare, he paused, his smile dropping a little. “Batman. You’ve seen The Dark Knight, right?”
They’ve spoken about how Kelly couldn’t legally sign the child over to them until twelve hours had passed, so they couldn’t take him home until the next day. They’ve talked about the future, how much contact she was comfortable with having between them. They’ve spoken about how she hoped the child would be raised. They’ve spoken about how often they would mail her updates, pictures, and anything else they might think to add. They’ve never talked about her naming him. In fact, they didn’t even think of the possibility until they got to the hospital and she was already pushing.
He cringed. “No, it's fine. I’ll just call you when I’m on my lunch.”
“And ruin the surprise?” King John let out a laugh. “We’ve known about your little crush for years.”
“That’s fair, but I promise you, he’s not a murderer. I was the one who issued his library card, and got to talk to him for a bit. He’s completely normal.”
“Now, what happened?”
By the time he was able to clock out, he was more than ready to go home. The house was quiet. Too quiet. Normally, he’d come home to Cas trying his hardest to get Claire to work on her take-home assignments, and keeping Jack entertained so he wouldn’t bother his sister. It was usually loud and crazy, and half the time he came home to a frenzied husband and messy house. This time, the living room was clean and empty, with no kids in sight. He was concerned for a moment, but quickly noticed the light coming from the office.
He let out the breath he had been holding. “Thanks…”
“I believe you. Perhaps by the time it was forwarded to me it was too late?”
forgot about the pain.
It wasn’t a question, so he just nodded and watched her pour him a cup and add a splash of cream. He was planning on swinging by the Starbucks on his way to work, but Missouri’s coffee was ten times better at half the price. He supposed that just this once, he could skip the drive-thru. “Yes, ma’am.”
He could see Cas at the desk, a few small stacks of paper in front of him and a frown on his face. His shirtsleeves were pushed up to his elbow and his tie was loose around his neck, making him the picture-perfect rumpled professor. Dean stared for a moment longer, unable to look away, and then rapped his knuckle on the door frame.
“It’s tradition,” Cas pointed out. “You weren’t allowed to see Hester before your marriage, and Gabriel couldn’t see Kali.”
Dean added a spoonful of the butter and brown sugar mixture into the bottom of their glasses then poured some hot water from the electric kettle. Finishing it off with a few ounces of rum and a bit of vanilla, they were ready to go. “Yeah, and it’s amazing. This isn’t like the time Sam convinced you to try your coffee with butter in it. Who the fuck does that? Psychos, that’s who.”
Dean smiled widely and gestured to the much smaller man beside him. “This is Garth. Don’t let his size fool you. He’s a scrappy guy. Then we have Lee and Jesse, with Gordon and Adam bringing up the rear.”
“He has a name, you know. You should find out what it is.”
The next day his toe was peeling, but at least it was the size it was supposed to be. He left in the morning and immediately started driving south. First order of business was with the restoration shop, so he drove there first and signed his contract, officially becoming an employee of Elite Restorations. Because he couldn't talk to Sam about the good news, he sent his exclamation mark filled text to Cas instead.
“—escorted him back to his village and didn’t accept payment when they—”
With a grin on his face, Cas got up and made his way to the washstand for the discarded cloth. “Need I remind you that the tour was your idea?”
“Fuck, baby. You feel so good.” He thrust again, this time harder and Cas saw stars. “God, you’re so hot.”
Dean moved to open the door and step outside, hoping the guy would give him a few seconds to explain before he punched him. His soulmate took a step back, fists clenching and unclenching rhythmically, poised for a fight. Dean understood. He obviously messed up and now he wanted to kick his own ass for being so stupid. If some asshole honked and tailgated him all the way to work, he’d want to kick the guy's ass too.
“He seems nice.”
The clock said he still had forty-five minutes left in the workday, and he just
He inched his way in, trying to calm himself. Did babies smell fear? Dean shook the thought out of his head and forced himself to walk up to the bassinet and peer inside. His son’s face was pinched and red, eyes closed tightly and eyebrows furrowed. He looked mad, and after what he just went through, Dean couldn’t blame him.
She couldn’t help but ask one of the nurses who had come through to give her a dose of painkillers, “Would he see anything?”
Cas watched him in confusion.
“Missouri didn’t say anything, ok?” he lied, not wanting to put too much stock in her predictions. They were correct often enough, but he couldn't take the chance. “And if you aren’t liking the coffee I've been bringing you, I can stop.”
“I feel horrible for taking all of this,” he mumbled, finally out of the market and heading for the training grounds.
They left that day with high spirits, confident that they tried their best, and if she didn’t choose them, then at least they knew what to expect with their next interview.
“I thought it was a fine portrait.”
Back at the shop with his phone still in hand and heart beating madly in his chest, Dean was at a loss for what to do. Eventually, he walked to the corner of the shop and wedged himself next to the refrigerator, effectively hiding from everyone in the shop. With a deep breath, he pulled up Cas’s number and hit dial. When the call didn’t connect the first time, he called again. Then again.
He shrugged and passed Cas his card back, his finger ghosting along Cas’s palm. “Yeah, you’re probably right. I could be a Bruce, though.” His voice dropped an octave and gained a rasp. “You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.”
He smirked. “I’m always right. Now, I need to hop into the shower. I can smell myself right now, and it's not pretty. Wanna join me?”
“Ok, I guess you’re right.”
“A fucking ten!” he yelled at his brother, extremely thankful that the morning’s crowd was so spread out. Any other beach would have had them packed next to each other like sardines. The last thing he wanted was to draw a crowd. If he was going to die, at least it was going to be without an audience.
“Dean,” Cas rumbled, “stop beating yourself up. It was an honest mistake, and I understand why you did it. You can still have the experience of working on your car with Jack, but you have to wait a while longer. You just get to have that with Claire first. There’s no law stating you can only teach one child how to work on the car. You can have your cake and eat it too, you know.”
“Metatron,” he answered remorsefully.
“Dean,” Cas hissed, not so discreetly elbowing him in the sides.
“What happened?”
He wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. “Because you signed a contract? Because King John is a man of his word? Perhaps Prince Dean liked the look of Cassie’s ass?”
Dean rolled his eyes and clapped the man on his back. “I grew up with Benny and he’s a good friend.”
Dean was only silent for the moment it took Cas to retrieve the brown leather belt. “How’s the morning going?”
Balthazar’s silence lasted a beat too long on the other end of the line. “Since when do you go to Starbucks? I
He preferred his commute to be silent, with no music or distractions of any kind. Clearly, his soulmate was a psychopath.
She threw her hands in the air. “Nothing! We’re just two sets of homos hanging out. No big deal.”
He pried open his watery eyes to glare at his brother. “What do you think?”
“Delicate,” he repeated. “I suppose it
“How are you so calm? Our little girl has a boyfriend!”
“No!” She squirmed away, but Jack was blocking her exit and it was too late. With as much strength as he possessed, Dean forced himself to sit and aimed for her armpit. She screamed loud enough that the neighbors must have heard and started kicking, nearly getting him in the crotch. Dean felt little hands pull at his in an attempt to save Claire, and he took the opportunity to pull Jack in front and start the assault on him.
“I need to go.”
“Spread your legs for me, Winchester.”
he missed this.
not being Gaston, but Dean instead. As he went to bed that night, he was no closer to the answer.
“—gave his last loaf of bread to a soldier who—”
“Better than our first anniversary?”
“You’re not helping.”
“Wow.”
They panted into each other's mouths, tongues tangling, and Cas shuffled backwards, pulling Dean along to the couch. He sat first, pulling Dean on top of him, and they settled into the loveseat together. They were sticky and damp with sweat, but neither cared as they clung to each other, both coming down from their high. He could sleep there, Dean thought, with Cas’s hand in his hair and his head pillowed on his chest. And god, he was tired enough to do it. He had never been one to fall asleep after sex, but with Cas’s heartbeat playing in Dean’s ear and the warmth of his chest keeping Dean comfortable, it was a close thing.
Dean’s lip curled up at the mention of his brother’s name. “Your brother is a bag of dicks. Whenever Michael comes here, he treats my staff like shit and acts like he’s better than everyone. He thinks he’s hot shit, but I just don’t see it.  I was so glad I didn’t have to marry that asshole.”
“This is serious! She’s in the first grade! She’s way too young to be thinking about boys,
“Is what getting out of hand? Your little stalking problem?”
Cas nodded in thanks. When he told Anna he’d walk, he didn’t consider that his trench coat wouldn’t be enough to keep the chill away.
“You’re doing so well, Dean.”
He placed him in the crook of her arms and stepped back, watching as she looked him over. Kelly brushed her hand over the dark tuft of hair, stroked his chubby cheeks, and smiled when he yawned widely. “He looks like a Jack, to me.”
She just cocked an eyebrow. “I wasn’t born yesterday, honey. A new sweetheart is the only thing that would keep you from visiting your Auntie Missouri.”
Dean shrugged. How could he explain that he was, in fact, freaking the fuck out? For god's sake, he was going to be in charge of another human. One who would look up to him, develop some of his habits—good and bad, and learn about life from him. Anyone would freak out. But on the other side, if the way his relationship with Claire was anything to go by, he was in for a lot of fun too. “I’m trying not to think about it too much. Like I said, it’s going to be a while before we actually adopt so by the time they’re ready, we’ll have this whole thing figured out.”
Speaking of… Dean took a second to rid himself of his boxers. No one said anything about
For instance, when he heard of a small human village under siege from a swarm of demons, he saw the importance of intervening before it was too late. Unfortunately, King John's hands were tied and could spare no men to save them. His commander refused to help without a formal request from King John, so it was Castiel alone that snuck out in the middle of the night to help. With only his two blades and the cover of darkness, he flew to the village, and in the predawn light he slaughtered the monsters, using his dark wings to cloak himself in the shadows and picking the demons off one by one. He left before the village could offer him thanks, not desiring even the smallest bit of attention for doing his duty as a prince and commander.
“I’ve been sleeping in and eating an early lunch.” It was a half truth, at best. His coffee usually held him over until around 10:30 am then he’d eat his packed lunch. There was no way he’d tell her that he sometimes added a pastry to his Starbucks order.
This is a good thing, love. You’re not exactly the belle of the ball. Better to let him see you once it's too late for them to back out of it.”
God, he hated that tone. “What?”
With their last thirty minutes ticking on, Castiel began his closing duties. He checked his emails one last time, emptied the return box, reshelved the last of the books, and finally made his way to shut down the computers. He and Anna were always the last to leave, so the others were already grabbing their things and heading home. He’d lock up on their way out, as he always did, and drop Anna off at her house.
They glanced at each other, both in silent agreement, before springing on her. She struggled and shrieked, but they were able to grab her wiggling form and cover her with those same kisses, not stopping until she went limp in surrender. Jack screamed in the background, wanting to be taken out of his high chair and join in on the fun.
The call came on a Friday afternoon.
“How dare you!”
“Oh, you think that’s canon? Tell me what else you think is canon.”
“Yeah, babe,” Dean encouraged, his lust blown eyes watching Cas’s fist work quickly over his cock. “I’m almost there.”
Metatron's pale face started turning purple. “
Dean had to admit that Cas being a part of his apartment hunt put a warm feeling in his chest. He sent back an enthusiastic text, and spent the rest of the day texting pictures of all the best and worst things about each apartment. Some had bad kitchen layouts, ugly carpet, and tile counters. While others had cool retro fixtures, gyms and pools in the complex, and even one that had its own garage. They both agreed that the last one was the best. Baby deserved a roof over her head just as much as he did.
Balthazar snorted into his hand. Castiel was
“I don’t want to know his name, and I don’t want to go out with him. Don’t you have work you should be doing?”
Dean snorted loudly. King Zachariah would have had a stroke at his husband's behavior, but Castiel found it absolutely adorable. “My brother said I’d like you.”
The kicks were kind of fun in the beginning, but then he started aiming for where I sprained a rib two years ago, and it really hurts sometimes. I like it when he gets the hiccups, though. They’re pretty cute.”
Cas shrugged. “I didn’t know.”
Dean shied away from Cas’s hand, too sensitive for even a light touch, and put his shaking arms to use pushing up off the desk. His husband pulled out as he stood, and Dean could feel a trickle of cum going down his thigh. Uncaring, he turned and pulled Cas into a kiss.
Without the heavy bucket, Castiel made quick work of the jog to the tower. Amazingly, the view from the back was just as good as the front. It almost erased his anger at his brother for making him leave.
He earned himself the nickname
“Cut my fucking leg off, there’s no way I’m letting you pee on me.”
Dean smiled and sent a quick text to Cas. “Sure, kid. Let's go before it gets too late. Daddy will kill us if we eat dessert too close to dinner.”
“Oh, it’s you,” Zachariah drawled, as if the servant hadn’t announced him. King John himself could have been announced and he wouldn't have paid a lick of attention to the poor servant.
He shuffled back and forth on his feet before making up his mind. “I'll take you home.”
“Come on, Dean. Fuck me.”
“You’d be surprised,” he quipped. “You and your damn angel stamina. If you start without me…”
“That’s wonderful, Claire. Are you finished with dinner?”
“Charlie!” Dean groaned, snatching the packet of sugar up so he could toss it at her head. She ducked out of the way with a smile, snatching a coaster and tossing it like a frisbee. Cas leaned away from them and met Gilda’s eye. She glanced once to Dean and then back at Cas, giving him an exaggerated eye roll.
It could have been minutes or hours, but Dean eventually pulled off with a ragged gasp, his forehead resting against Cas’s hip as he tried to catch his breath. He was a second away from suggesting they switch positions, or even suck each other at the same time, but then Dean’s head popped up with determination in his eyes. Without any warning, Dean climbed to straddle Cas’s hips and gripped his cock. It only took him a few seconds to dip his fingers into the already-open container of lube and slickly stroke his husband’s cock. Cas watched Dean work in stunned silence, knowing he should tell him to stop, that they didn’t need to do this a
On paper, it was nothing but a common political marriage. A way to finally placate King John and maintain the peace that they both strove to keep. Officially uniting their kingdoms would benefit the two politically, in trade, and in the war against demons. But to send Castiel, the fifth son and King Zachariah’s ugliest child, was an insult to the kingdom of Winchester and the gravity of the situation. Castiel had been far removed from palace politics, but even
“What did Missouri say?”
but he was a man of routine and everyday he woke up to have the same breakfast, went to work in the same two suits and ties, and did the same boring repetitive work crunching numbers and approving budgets.
slipped the tip into his ass. The stretch burned and his shoulders tensed and he felt hot all over, but he pushed against it, knowing that in a few moments his body would relax. Cas held his finger there for a few seconds before he pulled out and pushed back in, never venturing past his first knuckle. Cas continued to toy with his hole, pushing in and out, pulling gently at his rim until sweat began to bead on Dean’s forehead.
“I’m not asking a murderer out.”
It was silent for a few moments before Cas spoke again. “If you don’t mind me asking, how is the pregnancy going?”
He silenced his husband with a kiss and Cas was just drunk enough to go with it. He tasted like the hot cocoa he had just finished, and that only egged Dean on. They stumbled to the couch and collapsed onto it, Cas grunting as Dean’s full weight landed on him. He tried to lift himself so Cas could suck in a breath, but his knee slipped on the edge of the couch and he crashed to the floor. Dean laid there dazed for a moment,  until his head stopped spinning (mostly) and he could hear his husband’s loud laughter.
Cas’s head tilted to the side. “Who’s that?”
“It’s not a little crush…” Dean defended, his voice petulant.
Dean’s office faded back into view and he was left staring at his laptop and blinking away the strange feeling of coming back into his body. His heart was still beating loudly in his chest, a residual effect of the annoyance his soulmate had felt when he saw the car cutting in front of the traffic. Dean didn’t blame him since it was an asshole move, but he hated the emotional runoff that happened every so often. His soulmate must have been
At one time, he had naively imagined wooing Dean with his grace and exquisite beauty. Castiel had been well known in Heaven as a most beautiful angel, and he wished Dean could truly see his loveliness. Dean had gazed with wonder at the mere shadow of his wings, and Castiel dreamed of revealing his full glory to his beloved one day. Dean’s soul had been dazzled and awestruck by his true form in Hell—but what would the man think of him now?
“Sonofa
He finally looked up.
“Yes. I’ll wait right here, then.” he said, and ended the call.
“Well yeah, you… it’s like you’re
Sam had snorted and shook his head, “Dude, you ARE Mr. Spock.”
Dean relaxed a bit more, grinning and sliding his eyes up to Castiel’s. “Nice bedside manner, Doctor Assbutt.”
thought Dean,
that back there?” he asked, jerking his head toward Sam in the backseat.
“Perhaps it’s inside me,” Cas said lowly. “Burning through my grace. It could burst out again...”
Sam ignored him. Dean couldn’t really see his face in the dim interior of the car, pinned to the seat behind Cas, but he could hear the bliss in his voice.
Dean blinked. “Damn.” Cas shouldn’t say shit like that. “Uh, so,” he managed, “next time then. I’ll make it up to you.”
Perhaps three more miles, and Dean was just slipping into a little
“We’re screwed,” Sam griped, and Dean wanted to throttle him.
“Ok, buddy,” he whispered. “Ok.”
The boy’s brow knit even tighter. “
“Sam’s not going to let anything happen to him.” Dean lifted one dripping arm and flicked water Cas’ way. “C’mon, it’s time to lighten up—get in.”
it: the warmth of Dean’s palm, the fingers splayed across his backbone, the gentle pressure his friend exerted. Castiel stopped short, and Dean stopped beside him, his body turning in, and Cas suddenly wanted to embrace him. Instead, he let himself lean in just a bit—enough to press his shoulder to Dean’s, and tip his head close enough to smell the warm scent of Dean’s neck. It smelled like home.
Was it possible that Cas craved human touch now as much as he did? Why? Or was Cas somehow drawing from his soul? Cas seemed to read his mind, answering his question without being asked.
“A bud… you mean like an infant has?”
“Wish I could. Cas, you ok?”
Dean sighed, climbing off his lap and rearranging himself on the seat. With a few contortions, he was able to curl around the steering wheel and lie on his side, with his head on the angel’s thigh and his bent knees against the door. It occurred to him that he couldn’t monitor the windows or the mirrors anymore for an approaching plow, however.
“First is that you don’t touch your junk in a roomful of dudes.”
They crouched behind the garage, in the dark, to make a game plan.
“Yo.”
“Huh?”
“You must’ve seen some freaky shit,” Dean murmured, staring at his mouth.
Dean stopped short on his way back to his seat and spun around, Cas nearly running into him. “And you know this how?”
Cas looked over at him, and in the dappled moonlight, Dean could see the fiery angelic resolve in his eyes. “Easily accomplished,” he said.

“Stop it now,” Dean scolded. “It’s gorgeous cause it’s

“Do you want to describe it to me?”

“Dude, you’re better than heated seats,” he sighed. “This is awesome.”
him a soul?” Sam butted in, breathless.
“I’m thinkin’ we oughta take a swim…”
Dean’s eyes popped open. Cas was staring at him plaintively, his eyes glistening. He’d rolled onto his side.
“Why the hell didn’t you wake me up an hour ago, then? Let's get the fuck out of here!” He put his coffee down and sprung to his feet, letting the old quilt fall to the floor. “Can we grab breakfast burritos on the way?”
Castiel looked at his brother, already feeling the need to defend a man he’s never met. “I prefer muted colors as well.”
Children and their mothers flocked to his side to receive his flirtations and slightly sexist one-liners. He pressed fake kisses into the knuckles of little girls, encouraged young women to hang off of his muscles for pictures, and made it very clear he was on the hunt for a wife. In essence, he was the perfect Gaston.
“Well, not if you don’t want it,” he hedged. Fuck, the last thing he wanted was for Cas to agree just because it was something Dean wanted. A child wasn’t something you could return just because you changed your mind. If Cas agreed and then regretted it… “Listen, maybe we should talk about this another time. Do you want a drink or something? I could really use a whiskey.”
She let out a sigh and went back to the table to finish her waffle. “Ok, but I don’t want Jack to come. He doesn’t leave the dolls alone and last time he spilled all the tea.”
On the third day, Dean woke with a stress headache and as the hours stretched, it didn’t get any better. He scowled through his breakfast and his drive to the highway, cursing the fact that it would be another few hours before he could take another dose of Tylenol. The Target sign loomed in the distance, mocking him as he pulled onto the shoulder and practically punched his hazards lights on. He swore at himself and gave Baby a pat on her dash in apology. The last thing he needed was for Baby to get offended and give him problems when he was so far from home. She was a sensitive woman and deserved only gentle touches.
He stared at Dean, eyes wide in alarm. “What?”
And just like that, they were alone with Kelly.
Balthazar smiled in triumph. “I’ll be a very good boy…”
“I’m still going to Missouri’s.”
Dean scooped the little guy up and squeezed him. “See? He
Castiel sighed, forcing down his annoyance. “I just want to know what I should do.”
Dean’s mind was working hard to find a topic. “So, uh… You live around here?”
“That’s ok, then. Do I gotta share my barbies with her?”
Balthazar had always been the charming one. That angel could talk the pants off of anyone and seemed to know just what to say to put someone at ease. He had never been personable like his brother, but what he
Dean took a hopeful step forward. “And, uh… your dad always handed you the funnies and you two would read the paper together. Michael always said it was lame, but I think he was jealous...”
“If you don’t like it, I’ll talk to him. The last thing he wants right now is an HR complaint.”
Claire took his distraction for the opportunity it was and jumped onto Dean, latching onto his middle with her arms and legs, and pushing him over onto the couch. He yelped in surprise, laying there in shock as her seventy-pound frame landed on him. Jack piled on too, always ready to follow the lead of his big sister, his sharp elbows and knees digging into Dean’s muscles like the worst massage in the world.
As he turned to leave, she stopped with a soft hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry about that boy, ya hear me? Consider it one of my ‘educated guesses.’”
“I finally have a clue, Charlie. I might be able to find him.”
as good as his professor fantasy. Almost. Shit, Cas even had those damn socks on. He couldn’t help but grip himself and give a few strokes in a vain attempt to relieve some of the pressure.
coming back. King John’s letter said it as clear as day. He’s finally fitting in, the people loved him, the King recognizes his worth, and it was only a matter of time before Dean fell in love with him.
With a defeated sigh, he placed Jack onto the kitchen floor and sat at the breakfast nook with his head in his hands. He should have known things weren’t going to work out. Jack was only 11 months old, not even old enough to be walking, and Dean could laugh at himself for thinking Jack would sit quietly in his carrier for the hour it took to do the tune-up. Cas was right, he
Balthazar sat in silence as he waited for Cas to finish explaining exactly what he needed help with. When he was done, Balthazar continued to stare at him from his place on Cas’s couch. “So, you’ve been getting me coffee for a couple of weeks just so you can visit your boy toy?”
The conversation was jumping around too fast for him to follow. “I’m sorry. What letter?”
Cas nodded and left, doing his best to ignore the comment. He’d stopped questioning the woman and her future predictions long ago, but he wasn’t going to base his decisions on it either. With new resolve, he was determined to get up earlier so he could go to both stores the next morning.
Sam just shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
She was silent for a moment. “Ok, D&D is officially canceled. Hold on, let me tell the team.”
Dean snorted. “Have you
And last, but certainly not least: His soulmate was
He watched as the boys sparred under the supervision of an older man with salt and pepper hair and sharp eyes. Despite their size, they were doing quite well. Their form was shaky, and a few of them struggled to swing the heavy swords, but he could tell they would be fine soldiers in a few years. It was just as he moved towards the older boys practicing with pikes that he heard a sword clang to the ground on the other side of the training arena. He turned to see a cavalry rider staring at him in utter disbelief.
“Please, Dean,” he whimpered. “Move.”
Dean turned to Cas and mouthed
“I sent him away,” he admitted sheepishly.
“Yeah, ‘
“But you always tell me to ask first when I’m playing with Emma and Alice.” She pointed out, her tongue poking through her missing front tooth. “Will the baby get time out too if he plays with my things?”
This was one such time.
“It’s been months,” he pointed out gently.
Dean smiled at his dazed look. “What’s your name? I need to know.”
Unfortunately for him, his council didn’t agree. While Zachariah sat on his throne and disparaged his closest human allies, the Kingdom of Winchester had sent envoys and ambassadors to the other kingdoms, assimilating themselves into their courts and gaining favor. While Zachariah was the closest neighbor, he was far from their only ally, and if Zachariah even hinted at war, the other kingdoms would turn on him before he could blink.
“Gilda is already waiting for us outside and Dean wanted to clean up first before he headed over.”
man could look at that face and
“I do!” Dean practically yelled. “Please, Professor. I’m ready for your finger.”
He could feel his face flush, but he pushed through. “Your tone is really good if you’re trying to emulate his style. He doesn’t seem to try too hard. A lot of authors add flowery symbolism or take themselves too seriously. Too much purple prose. Winchester doesn’t do that. It’s one of the reasons I like him.”
He stuck out his bottom lip in a pout. “Come on. I need your help. How else am I going to wash my back?”
crush. He’s a war hero and a prince, Dean. We couldn’t have chosen a better match. We were lucky King Zachariah was even willing to let him go.”
tell me I’m being dramatic!”
“A ‘78 Continental.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean got up to make himself a second burger. After dinner, they sat down for a little tv. It was one of his favorite places to be, side by side with Claire stretched across their legs. He ran his fingers through her hair, wondering what he did to deserve them.
smiled at that. “You must be speaking of Michael.”
Blood rushed out of his brain and straight to his dick so quickly he felt a little lightheaded. He tripped forward and threw himself in the chair across from Cas so hard it squeaked in protest and scraped across the floor.
“You better be,” she warned, handing him his coffee. “And you better bring that man around soon, too.”
Dean hummed around him, sending vibrations echoing throughout his body and made even the tips of his fingers tingle. His wings thrashed, threatening to upend furniture, but they had carefully removed anything that could fall after the

but instead Balthazar patted him on his shoulder. “I wouldn’t miss your big day.”
Dean and Cas smiled at her. “Nice to meet you, Kelly.”
Cas huffed. “Not interested. I wouldn’t want to ruin your good name.”
“What do your men say about him?” he asked nervously.
They all collectively blinked at him and scurried from the room, with only one brave servant remaining. “Sir, would you like us to bring you another breakfast?”
He seemed to shake himself out of it. “I’m sorry, I’m Samuel, but you can call me Sam. I’m—”
Cas just stared at him blankly. “Dean… I’m an angel in a human kingdom.”
Suddenly a single dad, he had written off men completely. No one wanted to date a man with a child, especially a divorced one with as much baggage as Cas. It was too much responsibility, too much pressure. After all, Cas was ultimately looking for a father for his child and most men his age weren't looking for a family, they were looking for a quick fling. It didn’t help that the people he found on dating sights were absolutely horrible. If he wasn't getting sent a dick pick within three texts, he was being ghosted the moment he mentioned Claire. Gabe told him to leave her out of it, but she was such a big part of his life that not mentioning her felt deceitful.
Cas was saved from replying by the faintest sound of an infant's cry. They both froze, staring at the door in nervous anticipation. The sound came again, this time louder and angrier. Dean sagged into his husband in relief. “Fuck, did we just become dads again?”
His heart dropped. “So you’re saying I shouldn’t do it.”
“Michael and Anna are your siblings. I used to see you guys eat breakfast in the mornings before school. Anna would always complain that your parents bought plain cheerios and not the honey nut ones.”
Dean reached out to flick his brother’s forehead, but Sam deftly avoided the move. “You’re an ass, Sammy. The sun isn’t even out yet.”
Cas tapped his finger on the mouse, internally debating what he should do, when Anna made her way over and sat in the chair next to his. “What is it today?”
Despite having been to Starbucks nearly every day for a month, he had never been inside. The wall of coffee-scented air that hit him as he walked through the doors had him closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. Cas let out a little sigh of pleasure and joined the short queue, glancing around the large coffee shop as discreetly as he could.
“You’re just like Dean, then. You shoulda heard him talk about their cheddar burger.”
for his heroic deed on that day, and to his extreme embarrassment, his stunt earned him a substantial reputation. Humans wrote
After a few minutes acquainting himself with Dean’s usual band of guards, they left the castle grounds. When Cas first traveled by carriage through the bustling streets, he had been amazed at the amount of life he saw. Zachariah had always talked about Winchester like it was a slum and teeming with garbage, but it was a bustling city just like any other he’d been to on his campaigns. There were businesses, people chatting with friends, families ambling through the streets, and young children playing in fields.
The man whose name
Balthazar barreled on, ignoring Cas. “I’ll sit in the back seat and not say a word. You just order your coffee and I’ll observe the interaction. My lips will stay firmly shut the whole time.”
“Yes, and he had a massive crush on you because of it. That was flirting, my dear. You were
Cas gaped at him. “They aren’t that bad!”
“Too what?” he asked, his eyebrow still raised.
Cas snorted. “I don’t like that he flirts with you. It’s rude.”
As usual, the voice taking his order at the screen wasn’t the smooth voice of the green-eyed man, but high and perky as he placed the order for Balthazar’s cold brew. Soon, it was his turn to pull up to the window. He took a moment to dig through his glove compartment to grab a card, and—
“It is a big deal if this is a
The silence was beautiful. “I’m so glad the bassinet is on your side of the bed.”
He let out an audible sigh of relief and grinned at Cas. A door slamming alerted Dean to his time crunch. In just a few seconds, Sam cock-block Winchester would be there to help him into the car, so he needed to act quickly. He used his free hand to grab his phone and thrust it at Cas. He took it just as Sam rounded the front of his car. The look on his face as he caught on to the situation was priceless, and he just
“This is Benny.” Dean pulled the large man into a handshake. “He’s the head of the guard. Benny, this is Cas.”
Jack babbled some more, interjecting a few loud “
Once the car door was shut behind him, he checked the dash and noted the time with dismay. He only had fifteen minutes to get to work, and it took at least ten to go straight there. There was no way he was going to be able to stop by the doughnut shop and grab his usual hot coffee without being late.
Dean shrugged. “I didn’t want to freak you out, and I just kind of hoped you’d ask me about adoption at some point. I know we’ve been married for less than a year, but I was getting tired of waiting.”
“Well, I still think a rooster would—never mind.” He took a deep breath. “Ok, so I guess there are two things I want to talk to you about. Let me just lead with the easiest.”
“Don’t call me that.”
going to let his soulmate get away from him. Not after all he had done to find him. Not for anything. “Wait!” He took off at a run, and the man stopped at the sound of Dean’s heavy footfalls. When the man turned to glare some more, Dean opened his mouth and said the first thing that came to him. “You’re my soulmate!”
And suddenly, they were off, talking and smiling and possibly even flirting. It was exhilarating. He hadn’t been flirted with in what felt like years, but here Dean was, smirking and complimenting his daughter and letting Cas know he liked kids in such a way that made his interest undeniable. He was lightheaded and in shock at the way Dean blatantly eyed him up and down and made him feel desirable for the first time since his divorce four years ago.
Cas watched the gears turn in his head, and he knew what was coming. “Dean…”
“I am nothing like my father, I assure you.”
“Why don’t you just regift them?”
“I knew your name wasn’t Charlie...”
you. Trust me, if he was just doing the Gaston thing it would look completely different.”
Metatron was leaning over Zachariah’s shoulder, already reading ahead. From the expression on his face, it wasn’t good. Mumbling to himself, his father finally skimmed the letter. “Let's see… Blah, blah, blah. Too many greetings, what’s the—” Blood drained from his father's face. “What? ‘
, was direct. “Yes, but I hope that is not all we’ll be.”
“Hey, I’m a damn
“Yet,” Balthazar cut in.
He had a redheaded sister named Anna who talked his ear off about boys, and Dean knew from the minute he saw her that she would grow up to be a heartbreaker.
“Absolutely not.”
Cas let out a moan and couldn’t help slowing his strokes, his thighs and stomach clenching as his orgasm crested, covering Dean’s hand in a thick layer of come. Cas forced his eyes back open and continued moving, going as quickly as he could in his post-orgasm haze. He soon became grateful for having finished first because it meant he could give Dean his full attention, watching as Dean threw his head back, bit his bottom lip, and shook through his own orgasm.
“We may have bantered a little,” he admitted, thinking back to their conversations about his name tag. He refused to believe that their talks were very flirtatious. The winks and smiles, though? Perhaps. It was just so hard to believe that a man as handsome as him would flirt with a lowly financial advisor like Cas.
“I was flirting, then,” he wondered aloud.
They stood outside the hospital room, straining to hear past the noises of the hospital and the soft cries of Kelly coming from inside. Her nurses were her only company as she birthed the baby, and the two of them could do nothing but stand by and listen helplessly as the brave young woman brought their child into the world.
“Do you live close?” Castiel asked him. “I’m worried the water will cool before you get home.”
“Of course not!” He blushed. “Ok, I get your point. Although, I don’t think I could forgive myself if he did kill anyone.”
