Sherlock drops the phone. Then he spreads his arms and lets himself fall forwards and over the edge of the roof.
Sherlock smoothes down his clothes and tells his body to calm down. In the short time they've been together like this, he's already learned about so many new things, new
"You'll find that person. I'd be surprised if you didn't," I tell her, and that's when she leans forward in her chair and tries to kiss me.
Sniffing softly, Sherlock turns so that they can hug properly, and John pulls him close and kisses his cheek.
, Sherlock’s scent and his soft skin and his heated breath clouding his brain and rendering him unable to do anything but want more, more,
"I--- I wish we could go to bed now, John," he says. "I feel words are not enough to conclude this conversation. I--- I'm not sure there
He misses John. Always. It's like a vital organ has been removed from his body, leaving him crippled, and over time he's gotten used to it. But today, the phantom pain is killing him.
couldn’t. You’re much too good at this.” He administers a light slap to John’s right shoulder, then points at the bed. “Go sit down over there.”
Afterwards he watches me clean myself up, and the way his eyes follow my every move makes me nervous. He senses that (of course he does) and smiles.
The scenario runs through my head in mere seconds, and suddenly I'm seeing it, as clearly as if it was real.
He nibbles his way down the inside of Sherlock's left thigh, then up again until he reaches his testicles. He kisses him there as well, very gently, his palms gliding from the creases of his thighs to his knees in one long, calming stroke. Sherlock can feel every quick breath he takes brushing his sensitive skin, and it's torture and perfection at the same time.
, and John's vision flickers out of focus for a second. Sherlock's opening is soft and damp against his fingers; he can feel tender, puckered skin hiding a tight ring of muscle, and God, if this isn't the most sensual way Sherlock could have chosen to tell him that it's okay, that he can take what he wants,
He sinks to his knees beside the bed and, without further preliminaries, buries his face between Sherlock's legs to breathe him in. Sherlock shivers and moans, his thighs opening for John, and John rubs his cheek against the other man's testicles and then teases him there with the tip of his tongue. His right hand makes its way across Sherlock's chest and finds a nipple, and when he flicks it with his thumb, he feels it harden under his touch.
Sherlock has never heard him sound like this before, but he loves it, and he loves being the reason for it.
He tells Sherlock everything in the end – how the plane didn’t end up crashing after all, how Lily tried to get him to confess his feelings to him, how he thought he could never do that because of his responsibilities, how he threw away the napkin and then went back for it, how he decided to just suffer through it and try to forget, and how it didn’t let him sleep three nights in a row.
bit, after all. Either way, it's both terrifying and hilarious, and John tries to stay on his toes and keep up.
"What if we keep my back out of the way?" he asks and moans when I run my teeth along his Adam’s apple. “I could just---
“I know,” he answers, his lids fluttering as he leans into my touch. “But if any harm should come to you because of this--- If you end up in prison---”
I have never heard anybody utter my name with such reverence, such depth of emotion. Looking into his cerulean eyes, usually so keen, but now mellow with sorrow, I realise that I have never truly seen him for what he is. How could I have missed this? How could I not have recognised the human hiding inside the machine? Not even when I realised that my regard for him ran so much deeper than what is appropriate for two friends sharing the rent?
, nothing in between anymore, and they roll onto their sides simultaneously and meet in a full-body embrace, their mouths smashing together in a hot, impatient kiss, their legs entangling, their loins grinding against each other. John has never been this close to another man before, and the sensation of their erections rubbing against each other gives him goose bumps.
I pull him in for a deliberately unhurried kiss, and as he kisses back I can feel him relax into it, his arms wrapping themselves around my waist, his thigh slipping between my legs to press me even harder against the door. He is radiating so much body heat that I am beginning to sweat, so it comes as a welcome relief when he finally reaches for the buttons of my shirt and fumbles with them, his hands trapped between our bodies.
"Oh God, you feel so good," Sherlock tells him and bites his shoulder, then licks the spot to soothe the sting. "
John doesn't move away, but frowns and puts his hand on the small of Sherlock's back. "Sherlock. What's going on in that beautiful head of yours?"
. I can't explain it, and I don't even care. It's irrational. I don't know how or why, but I know there will never be anybody else for me but you. No matter what you did. No matter what you'll do."
On the next upwards caress, John lets his hands travel further, up to the nape of his neck and then into his hair, and Sherlock draws a long, shaky breath and feels his legs wobble in response to the touch. John's blunt nails scrape his scalp, massage it gently, but with enough pressure to set his nerve endings alight with pleasure.
"Good morning, John," Sherlock rumbles, gazing at him from under half-closed lids that only reveal mere slivers of his mesmerising light-blue irises.
People are trying to hold him back, trying to keep him from getting near the place where Sherlock fell, but he fights them off, none too gently, focused only on one thing. Maybe he can save him. Maybe it's not Sherlock after all. Maybe…
incredibly wonderful, and he hears himself utter a half-groan, half-sob that reverberates in the quiet room. Sherlock’s hands are on his abdomen now, and he reaches for them to entwine the other man’s fingers with his own.
"Hold me," Sherlock replies, his lids sliding shut, and John pulls him closer against his side and puts his arms around him, holding on as tightly as Sherlock's frail body allows him to.
I’m inside as deep as I can go, finding that he’s completely slack and open for me, while the rest of his body seems to be wound up as tight as a spring.
“Yes.” John finishes up with the necktie and smoothes down Sherlock’s lapels. “But a bit too explicitly gory for our target audience. How about the Birdwell case? People love hearing the part about the hornet’s nest.”
His length is throbbing against my hip, rock-hard and silky, and I feel myself stiffen in response, so immediately that it leaves me feeling lightheaded. My hand strays towards his chest, pushing gently. He growls through clenched teeth, sounding delirious with passion.
Nothing has been making sense ever since he died, and John doesn't give a fuck about what Ella says or what she thinks might help him cope. He
"I'll talk to Peter. He's been very busy, but I'm sure he'll make time. I--- I need time to think. Will you be alright if I leave now?"
Sometimes he wonders if he should preserve all the faces, all the stories, instead of deleting them from his mind. He's never wanted to become a cold-blooded killer. And it still affects him, so what he's been dreading hasn't happened… yet.
After one last gentle thrust he stills, still buried in his lover's body, so deep, so warm. A long shiver runs through him.
I close my eyes for a moment and fight to get my heart rate back under control. When I look at him again, he’s grinning.
… When you’ve healed… we’ll do this again… and then I’ll have you on your back, looking at me… I’ll lie on top of you… I'll be
"Are you sure this is okay?" Sherlock whispers while his fingers are already slipping between the other man's cheeks out of their own accord, searching, caressing, and John just keeps looking at him and nods and whispers back, right against his lips, making him shiver in response: "Do it."
"I was going to say lubricant, but if you want another cup of tea afterwards, we'll need some milk as well."
“Brother mine,” Mycroft says, one of his feet already on the threshold, but Sherlock just nods, and then suddenly they’re embracing each other, holding on tight.
"Don't spoil it now," he says, hoping John will understand. "Let's just enjoy this while it lasts. You're perfect like this.
The rational part of him is of course aware of the fact that it's pointless to worry about his age. It's not a factor that plays any role whatsoever in his and John's relationship, and it's something he can't do anything about anyway. John loves him. He loves John, whose body is, at the age of sixty-nine, not what it used to be, either, and he, Sherlock, doesn't mind at all. John is beautiful to him. They raised a daughter together. They'll be a couple till, for lack of a better phrase, death do them part.
“No, beautiful,” I confirm, overwhelmed with tenderness at the sight of this blatant show of wanton devotion. “Never.”
“I never--- never wanted to become a killer, John. I--- I helped people to get other people killed, by proving their guilt, by--- by helping the authorities to convict them, but up to the time I left you, I’d never actively,
I stay home from work for three more days, because I don’t want him to be alone. I’ve got six weeks left before I can leave the clinic, and at the moment I can’t even imagine leaving him on his own for one hour, let alone a whole day. He laughs at me for it, and I tell him I can very well make it another
Sherlock lets go of John to follow her, but not without planting one last kiss into John’s hair and mumbling, barely audibly: “I suppose I’ll retrieve my reward later.” John shoots him another look as a reminder that this is neither the time, nor the place for amorous innuendo, and Sherlock grins and allows himself to be dragged out of the room.
He glides his hands back to his arse, squeezing the strong muscles and marvelling at the way they twitch in response. “Stunning.” He nibbles his way down towards his bollocks, and he licks him there as well. “My darling.” The vein on the underside of Sherlock’s cock throbs against his lips as he trails them up and down the length of it, not quite sucking, but just dipping the tip of his tongue against it in a random pattern.
“Do not mention it, Dr Watson. You do not choose who you love, after all - who would I be to judge you for it? I do not agree with how the government treats men of your kind. Look at poor Wilde. I so loved his plays - and all his shenanigans, too. Speak his mind, he did! Alas, it was his downfall in the end. The two of you will be more careful, won’t you?” She stops and thinks for a moment, then adds: “Oh, and another thing… You have probably already thought about it, but make sure you do not buy your supplies at the same pharmacy every time. It is known to raise suspicions.”
alright with what I’m doing. It’s incredible. I watch him, almost awestruck, aware of the fact that no other person, no one but
He is exceptionally glad that Sherlock isn't looking at him right now. He's blushing so furiously that he's sure he's glowing in the dark. His whole face is burning.
"It's--- hard for me to interpret things sometimes," Sherlock suddenly blurts out, speaking fast, as if he wanted to get it over with. "Things like looks, or expressions. I don't always know what's expected of me, or what would be appropriate. Earlier, I--- I wasn't even sure whether you
A silent moment passes by. John's hand slides down the side of Sherlock's neck out of its own accord, coming to rest against the collar of his shirt.
His knees shaking and somehow feeling as if this was his first kiss ever, John grips Sherlock's collar with both hands now, pulls him in, opens his mouth wider and deepens their connection, and then Sherlock's hands are there, cradling his face, long fingers carding through the hair at his temples, their gentleness in stark contrast to the urgency with which he's pushing his tongue into John's mouth to look for his.
him, and the world outside could crumble and fall apart and it wouldn’t even matter to him, as long as he could be here with him, doing this.
“Stürzen wir ab?” a young girl asks in return, and even though he has no idea what that means, the tears in her voice make John feel terrible.
He moves his hands to Sherlock’s head again – he wants to spend his life touching his hair, his face, the back of his neck.
” he rumbles hoarsely and digs his thumb into the back of my neck, rubbing slow, encouraging circles. “
"Sherlock," he answers and runs his fingers through the smooth, thick curls framing the beloved face looking down at him. "You’ll be wonderful. You
Of course she did it on purpose. Maybe she just wanted to rile me up. Or maybe, and I’m suspecting that this is the more likely version, she noticed what I needed to finally get my head out of my arse and decided to help me out. Which would then, funnily enough, rile me up too. I can’t be mad at her. I deserve it.
So Sherlock gives him what he wants, surprised at his sudden lack of inhibition, but enjoying himself thoroughly nonetheless. Thrusting the way John seems to like it, having memorised the rhythm he showed him earlier, he keeps his mouth close to his ear and starts speaking into it, endearments and curses (John makes it clear that he loves those a lot), and sometimes just random sounds of pleasure, consciously ordering himself not to hold back as much as he normally would.
John laughs. They've never addressed this particular moment, not once in all those years, but somehow it feels right to do it now.
He's standing in front of the hooks on the wall that hold his coat and scarf, looking at the two items of clothing he's just taken off. He feels stupid and lost. He's out of his depths. He can't bring himself to turn around.
When John finally stops and moves up his body to kiss him again, he can taste himself on his lips, and it's still the most exciting thing he's ever done. John does not only want to do this to him, but he also wants him to share it, and the sheer intimacy of the act is what drives Sherlock out of his mind with arousal – every time. It feels dirty, indecent,
He turns his head and his eyes snap open, and I drown in moonlight blue infused with specks of gold and cry out, overwhelmed with the beauty of it all, unable to stop myself.
like. I want to become perfect for him. And I’m not sure I could use the same vocabulary anyway – I don’t see myself in bed with him, talking about him being
His hand leaves John’s arm and moves down to his arse, and before John knows what’s happening, he’s being drawn against Sherlock’s body with gentle force. His hardness presses against Sherlock’s hip through two layers of fabric, and he has to pull out of the kiss to catch his breath.
"Before we do this, I need to say it one more time. I'm sorry, John. For so many things. Your life would have been easier without me in it sometimes. I've never been good at showing it, but I did notice it when I hurt you – every time. I just couldn't always get past myself and stop."
I'm very aware that my guilty conscience is eating away at me, and that this is why I'm freaking out now, but I'm not ready to admit it yet.
On impulse, he pulls the slip of fabric towards himself and off its hook, digs his fingers into the smooth, expensive wool, and then buries his face in it.
It's not like his strength is waning yet. He's fit; he's still working. John is, too. But somehow he's scared that the slow, but incessant changes in his appearance might be the first signs that it's all about to start. Weakness. Decay.
Chiding himself for giving in so easily, he opens his lids. John blinks as if startled, then sends him a crooked, nervous smile.
“I can tell you what you can do,” I mutter, looking at the same window for a second before directing my gaze at the laptop again. “You can get the fuck back home, stat.”
, and for a moment his remorse makes him feel so sick that he's scared he'll throw up. He did, out of shame, out of disgust for himself, that evening. Several times. He knelt in front of his toilet and kept heaving until his stomach cramped and his throat was sore and there was only bile left in him. He didn't cry, although he really wanted to. He
“Alright, then,” he says, reaching out to ruffle her hair. “Papa can help you pick one, and afterwards, the two of you can lay the table.”
He's shaking violently and gulping for air, unable to gather his composure. He knows he's asking for too much, too soon, but he dreads the thought of ending his life in the knowledge that his daughter hates him for doing what he knows is the only way.
" he says lowly and then raises his head to pierce Sherlock with a desperate, exasperated look. "I’m sorry, Sherlock. I’m bollocks at this. I’m---
"You do know I still fancy you, don't you?" he mutters. "Just like back then. You're still the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Especially like this…" He kisses the nape of Sherlock's neck, licks him there and grazes his skin with his front teeth, which causes goose bumps to race down his back and arms. "Naked… hot… and soft… and so absolutely
, John,” he whimpers and reaches down with one arm to clasp my buttock, holding me still, but keeping me buried deep inside himself. “Never.”
“Listen, before the adrenaline wears off, I have to say one more thing. I have no one, John. No one. I’m alone. And I wish I had someone I could write a napkin message for – I really do. I know it’s all messed up, what with your pregnant wife and all, but please don’t let it go to waste. At least tell him.”
me to kiss you, John! If my deduction had been wrong, I could have destroyed the only friendship---"
I have to grin. It doesn't need a super brain to deduce the presence of that particular dish in the kitchen - the whole flat smells of it.
He rolls on his side and pulls me close, and I bury my fingers in his hair and press my forehead against his.
Sherlock smiles, showing his teeth, and allows it, even meets John's tongue with his own for a short, delicious moment, before drawing away entirely and rolling onto his back to gaze at John from under half-closed lids. It's the mother of all
“Hmm… I love you…” he sighs and takes a deep breath, melting against me, not leaving an inch of space between us.
“I love you so fucking much,” I mutter instead and just kiss him again, more deeply this time, and he reciprocates immediately, his tongue slipping between my lips to play with mine.
Sherlock is looking at him with a focused, intense gaze that takes his breath away. His pulse is racing.
He complies without a word, and before he knows what's happening, John has gone down on his knees behind him to nip at his hip, then at the back of his thigh.
of theirs will go, but alas, she's bound to the mansion, and the insistent pull of what's waiting beyond is getting stronger and stronger with every minute that passes. She knows it won't be long, now.
I’m doing this with makes everything ten times more exciting. I always thought allowing another person to touch me like this would be a painful and potentially humiliating experience, but it isn't. It's perfect.
"I want to learn about every part of you," I add, and then I just close my eyes and follow my instincts, licking first his tailbone, then the place where the cleft of his arse starts.
John sniffs angrily. Like every time that happens, Sherlock thinks that this really shouldn't make him look as dangerous as it does. Especially not now, with him wearing that ridiculous striped jumper that makes him look so much younger than he actually is.
“You’re not here for the small talk,” Sherlock replies. “Something’s happened. Why not get to the point right away?”
He draws back and then returns, a little more forcefully, and it knocks the air right out of Sherlock's lungs. He’d forgotten what it can feel like. Or maybe it’s never felt like this before.
I bite my lip, but before I can reply, Sherlock takes a step towards me and puts his hand on my arm.
Mrs Hudson bounces Rosie on her knees, and Rosie squeals in delight. Sherlock smirks to himself. How she's managed to figure it out so quickly he doesn't know, but it's quite obvious to him that this is not about giving them time to go out investigating. John, apparently oblivious to her motives, smiles at her.
“I knew you would,” Sherlock says calmly. “But please don’t. I want to have closure, John. Those two years – I don’t want them to haunt us.”
He’s aching to say it back, to turn this into something new, something bigger, but he’s so scared of what will happen next. Too scared.
"Are you alright?" John asks and draws him out of the spiral of nausea threatening to pull him under. Maybe it's showing on his face.
John is watching Sherlock and Henrietta, the older one of their granddaughters, from behind a leafless rose bush. They're walking around the beehives, wrapped up in their heavy winter clothes, their breath rising from their mouths in translucent clouds of white vapour.
“I wish I could take you in my arms now, John. I find it difficult to express what I want to tell you with words alone.”
him, despite the pain that's mounting with every step he takes. He can't move on if he doesn't force himself to let go, and he can't let go if he doesn't allow himself this grief, if he doesn't confront himself with it, only one last time.
Sherlock is scared of this part – more scared than he's ever been of anything before. This is not only about him and John anymore. There's a tiny human being involved in it all, and he's responsible for her pain and suffering. When she's older, will she hate him for it?
you?" John hisses, his knee pressing into Sherlock's side, into his broken ribs. It hurts a lot. "Am I doing it all for
“Sherlock,” I rumble, rolling his name around in my mouth, savouring the privilege of being allowed to use it. “Mmhhh…”
, I want to say, but refrain from doing so because I sense that he would be hurt. If I had to describe him to a stranger, “caring” would not be the first word to come to my mind, and I am mildly irritated by all the new facets of his personality I am confronted with today, and in such rapid succession. But I cannot deny that it is utter joy to have sparked this sudden surge of sentiment in someone who usually prides himself upon his complete detachment from any and all emotions.
him, and then Sherlock finally puts his arms around him in return and holds him tight, his open coat enveloping John like a blanket, taking away his sight. But he doesn't need to see right now. He closes his eyes and lets Sherlock's warmth seep into him from everywhere at once, listening to his quick, shallow breathing.
His tone is dry, almost cool, but he's not mad at being outed so early on. They wouldn't have been able to keep it from their landlady anyway, at least not for long. The open-door policy practised at 221B doesn't stop at bedroom doors, not as far as Mrs Hudson is concerned. It would have been only a question of time.
, which is not a lot of fun when being played against Sherlock Holmes, but the kids love it and John notices that Sherlock lets go some very obvious matches to let them have their moments to shine, too.
"How long has this been going on, then? Why did you never tell me?" she wants to know. "I should think that I, of all people---"
Holmes' smile turns wistful and he leans down to bump his forehead against mine, softly, and the gesture is so endearingly loving and innocent that my stomach clenches with affection.
John smiles and nods. “You two are mad,” he says with a slight eye roll. “But if that’s what makes you happy, go on.”
I go faster still, tightening my grip on my cock, feeling the memory of his fingers inside of me, remembering the way his touch caused sparks to spread through my whole body, like the tingle of an impending orgasm, but much, much more intense.
Although it hasn't registered with him what Sherlock means by that, John loosens his grip, and immediately he feels the younger man relax into his embrace. He buries his face in the crook of Sherlock's neck, shoving his scarf aside with his nose, smelling him,
, John thinks, and then he stops thinking for a moment, because Sherlock is trying to pull his underwear down, being hindered by John’s body weight and the less-than-perfect angle.
He's naked, fresh out of the shower, and as he stands there in front of the sink, his skin still damp and his hair in complete disarray, he realises that he hasn't really looked at himself for a long, long time.
“Love your mind,” I answer, too tired to hold my head up any longer. My forehead falling against his hipbone, I add: “Love
He lets go of him, and Sherlock gasps, sucking in a large, painful breath of air. He's feeling sick and dizzy, his vision flickering in and out around large black dots dancing in front of his eyes, his brain screaming for oxygen. Blood is roaring in his ears.
It's his third day without sleep, and it's slowly driving him insane. He makes it through his working day on auto-pilot - luckily, there haven't been any difficult cases this week, or he would have been in trouble.
John’s heart feels as if it wanted to jump out of his chest. He takes a deep breath to ground himself and then tries to focus on what he’s about to do to Sherlock, his lover and his best friend in the whole world, and apparently also the love of his life, because the way he’s feeling right now doesn’t leave room for any other explanation.
Sherlock fidgets with a corner of the duvet for a moment, and John can't believe his eyes. He's never seen him this nervous before. That he should be the reason for this premiere doesn't feel good at all, but he doesn't want to put too much pressure on him, so he just waits. Behind Sherlock's eyes, John can see him fight himself, and it's scary, but mesmerising.
They end up in a knot of limbs afterwards, still naked, and John thinks that being here like this with Sherlock is probably even better than the sex itself. Sherlock is a warm and comforting presence and, despite having been completely drenched in sweat only recently, still smells fantastic, like wood and spices and pure skin, and John wonders how the hell he managed to get him into his bed and what it would take to convince him to never, ever leave it again.
He makes fusilli with spicy tomato sauce – Sherlock's favourite pasta – while Sherlock rests on the couch, watching
, his knuckles white, his grip clenching and unclenching in an incoherent gesture of desperate frenzy.
“No, please…” he replies breathlessly. "I need to have you now… Please give it to me…" He bites down on his bottom lip and sucks it into his mouth, relishing my taste. I've never seen anything this sensual before. Then he smiles and whispers: “We've got all night… I'll get you hard again…
He's been taught that feeling such things is wrong, sick, an unforgiveable sin. He's had it beaten into him, again and again, until he
"My love," I reply, and it’s not something I’d usually say, but there's nothing that could express what I feel for him any better.
His hand slips between us and he fumbles with the zippers, buttons and flies of the garments separating us, and then our cocks finally touch, flesh on flesh, so warm, so silky-smooth, and I hiss and grab his arse to pull him against me.
The sweet, insistent ache of arousal is spreading through my body with mounting ferocity, and the fact that it’s
He looks so peaceful, Sherlock thinks, his heart aching with affection despite his efforts to block those feelings out. John's expression doesn't betray the turmoil raging inside of him, and Sherlock is glad that for now at least he seems to be free of the demons of his past.
I’ve always known that he values my companionship, and our bond has always been strong and somehow special, and it has always felt unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before. Looking at him now, I realise that it’s probably love, and that it has probably been there for a while now, but I don't know what to do. I can't make the next move. He has to help me.
With my medical kit located so handily close by, the latter is achieved in less than five minutes, and after dressing ourselves and attempting to fix his hair and my moustache in order to look presentable for the task lying ahead, we move to the sitting room and Holmes rings the bell.
That’s something I didn’t expect after experiencing him in bed. He’s so loving, so passionate – am I really the first one who gets to see him like that?
He slept with Mary when they got home from the last establishment they visited with Sherlock (you couldn't call it a restaurant), and he tried to make it all about her, make it slow and gentle and a promise of his love, a promise for what's to come when they're husband and wife. But all the while, Sherlock's eyes hovered in front of his own, as clearly as if they were real, as if the man they belong to was right there in the room with them, and John drowned in them until he couldn't tell anymore whether he was mesmerised or nauseated by the vision.
In a very remote corner of his mind, he is aware of the fact that this feeling right now, this sensation of complete and utter bliss and abandon, is not enough to outweigh the impending pain of its aftermath, but he can't bring himself to care. John is wonderful like this. While a part of him enjoyed being the more experienced one the first time they were together, Sherlock now appreciates this other face of John - maybe because the other man seems more like himself now, more self-confident and adventurous, or maybe simply because being the one in charge would be too exhausting right now.
“Okay. That’s great. So we don’t have to worry about anything there. We can just see where it leads us, Sherlock. And there are many things we can do without using anything to help it along. We can always try those things later. I know you find it to be an almost impossible notion, but… please stop thinking.”
I take your hand in mine and squeeze it, marvelling at those long, nimble fingers that draw ideas into the air when you speak, tracing every vein protruding from your pale skin, tracing every perfect bone and sinew that helps you to guide a bow across strings, to prepare a specimen for closer inspection under the microscope, to make my body burn under your touch when we’re alone. I caress the tender spot between your thumb and index finger, smoothing down the silky skin there with my fingertip.
walls squeezing him right into his cock, and he has to bite his tongue not to spend himself right then and there.
They're naked and sticky and cold and he's still wearing the condom, which feels bizarre and out of place in this terrible, confusing situation that he never saw coming, genius that he is, but he can't let go of John now. Something is poisoning him from the inside, and Sherlock wants to make it right.
) then spits, his voice filled with self-loathing, and there's a rustling sound in the background that John has heard before.
“You’re beautiful, too,” John tells him, and by now he knows that he’ll say anything that’s on his mind tonight, no matter what tomorrow will bring. “You’re
, so soon? What's gotten into you, love?" John asks and laughs a little, his surprise at this unexpected turn of events quickly making way for arousal.
“I needed that,” he eventually says, and I can hear that he’s hoarse from panting. “I needed that so much.”
I close my eyes for a moment to gather my composure. When I open them again, I find Sherlock looking after Mary with a barely noticeable hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock’s words touch something deep inside John. Sherlock may not find it easy to express his feelings, he thinks, but since they took the step beyond friendship, he’s always been incredibly transparent about his love for him.
A second later he grunts an unintelligible warning, his fingers tightening their hold on John's head, and John forces himself to come back to his senses and consciously experience the sensation of searing hot liquid being poured out inside his mouth, pulse after unhurried pulse, salty and bitter and gorgeously intimate, the pure essence of the man he adores.
He reaches down and strokes his hand up Sherlock's chest, along the line of his neck, and then up to his cheek. His fingers catch at his skin, painting it with their searing touch, and then John runs his thumb along his mouth, in a very obvious imitation of what Irene Adler's riding crop did to him while he was lying half-conscious on the floor in front of her.
“Look up. I’m on the rooftop,” he then says, and John's head snaps up immediately, and even from this far away Sherlock can see the terror in his expression.
We lie together quietly for a while, enjoying the sparse remnants of the afterglow of what has just transpired between us, but soon it becomes apparent that we must rise and clean ourselves and summon Mrs Hudson before she retires for the night, and change my bandages, too, if I am not to bleed all over my bed.
It’s Sherlock. But he doesn’t sound like himself at all. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I know that something is wrong. I’ve been waiting for this call for days, but this is not like I imagined it would be. I was looking forward to hearing his voice, longing for him to calm my frayed nerves with words of reassurance. Now there’s panic in how he says my name, and my heart sinks.
I suppress a laugh. I guess this means that yes, sex is definitely an option. I open my mouth to flick my tongue against his fingers, tasting salt and skin, and the low hum of pleasure he gives in response sends a spark of arousal between my legs.
I snort, and before I realise that I might be going too far with it, I ask: “And you’re expendable?”
Soon he can add another finger, which obviously makes the feeling better still, judging from the way John urges him on with wanton moans and the erratic bucking of his hips, and he thrusts deeply and massages that sweet spot inside of him with the quick, circular motions that he himself likes best.
,” he rambles and wonders if he should just give himself release with his free hand before he faints from sheer arousal, but at his last words Sherlock opens his eyes and lets go of the bed to grab his wrist and stop his thrusts.
It's wonderful and he needs more, and fast. John, however, doesn't continue, but just stares at him, holding himself in place, his thighs shaking. It must cost him an immense effort not to thrust; Sherlock can tell.
“Since you’re not fully operational at the moment, I’ll lend you a hand,” he then whispers and opens his own trousers next, his eyes on mine, his tongue sneaking out to wet his lower lip.
It has been going on for days, coming down in torrents that seem to never want to end, and Sherlock finds him hovering near the front door of 221B, drenched to the bone, his shoulders hunched and his face pale, so pale.
Sherlock watches as John, still catching his breath, looks down at the place where they're joined and then moves his hips in a slow, languid circle, fascination palpable in his gaze.
Gulping for air, he looks up to see his face, and Sherlock cranes his head to meet his eyes, his teeth clenched, his hair sticking to his sweaty forehead, his eyes blazing.
“I’ve been so selfish, Sherlock, lost in my own despair. It’s time I took care of you,” I tell him. “Whatever you need, I’ll give it to you. I want--- I
I groan and fish it out of my pocket. Perfect timing. As if my guilty conscience could get any bigger.
"I want to feel the same," John says lowly, breathing Sherlock's air. "I want to be close to you, closer than ever before."
He chides himself for being so weak, but strides over to the window nonetheless, his body moving as if driven by an outside force.
“Yeah,” John says roughly, marvelling at the spectacle before him. “That’s it. I’ve got you. Let go.” He repeats the movement of his hand, again and again, and then a second finger joins the first.
"No, it's true," he says. He's never discussed this topic with anyone before, and it feels… strange. Not bad, but not good either. "There were a few men at uni… and then later, in the army, there was… one."
A low, choked-off growl makes its way out of Sherlock’s chest, and then his lower body jerks off the bed and he throws back his head in abandon, his eyes going out of focus, his mouth opening in a completely silent scream.
“Stop this violence!” Sherlock exclaims as he bounds upwards and heads for the door. “Go make me some tea and some breakfast, John,” he calls back over his shoulder.
“Mrs Hudson!” we exclaim in unison - Holmes laughing, the merry sound tinged with hysteria, and I cringing in desperate embarrassment.
Despite his pleas to go faster, John keeps up his rhythm, his pressure, since he doesn't want it to end too soon, or ever. Sherlock is letting go of everything, he can tell when he looks at his face, and it's the most mesmerising thing to witness. In any other situation, Sherlock would sneer at meaningless expressions like "I want to make love to you all night" -
…” he hums as if to prove my point and circles my opening with his tongue. “That was the shortest panic attack in the history of humanity,” he then mutters against my wet skin, tickling me with his breath, and I close my eyes.
I've just had sex with my best friend, and I seem to be quite madly in love with him. He's being arrested for something he didn't do. Our flat is swarming with an army of annoying officers and detectives right now, and I've just hit their boss. In the face. A madman is going to kill me if my friend, who's now my
He closes his eyes and wraps his heart around that thought, and it's so sweet that he dozes right off and dreams about John in his pyjamas, holding him tight. Some time later, he wakes up and thinks (dreams?) he can hear someone breathing just outside his door, but he's so drowsy and comfortable that he can't make himself move to get up and check.
After breakfast, John takes a shower, and the warm water calms him down a little. There's no use breaking down now. Sherlock needs him, especially now that he's feeling so weak, and all he can do is try and make it easier for him. It'll be over soon – wasting the time they've got left on despair won't do either of them any good.
“You know, I’d almost forgotten how strange it is to always skip the small talk,” he jokes and sends Sherlock a lopsided smile.
He breaks off, wishing he’d kept this to himself. He's been thinking about it now and again in the past weeks – even though he's the one who takes care of Rosie most days, Sherlock still plays an important part in her life. They raise her together. He has no idea whether Sherlock even entertains thoughts of that nature, or if it matters to him.
He huffs, slings his arm around my waist, and buries his face in the space between his pillow and my neck. I hold him close and breathe into his hair.
“He’s here!” a small boy calls out from a desk in the third row, followed by a roar of tiny, happy cheers as several children gravitate towards Sherlock.
"Mmhh," John hums and breaks the kiss with a smacking sound to hide his face in the crook of Sherlock's neck, his hair tickling Sherlock's jaw. "Oh---
Sherlock's face takes on an expression he's never seen him wear before, and it's hard to describe what exactly it is. He feels that for a moment, he can see right into the other man's soul, into his deepest, most vulnerable core, and the impact of that is almost physical – it's so intense that it knocks the breath right out of him. He waits for Sherlock to speak again, biting back his impatience and despair because he wants to give him time to process this. His insides in a turmoil, he lowers his heels back to the floor and just looks up at the taller man, soaks up his body heat, his scent, scared that it's maybe all too much, too soon, and that Sherlock will bolt.
I freeze, tongue-tied, feeling self-consciousness engulf me once more with a vengeance. No one has ever touched me this way before. I need to tell him.
Sherlock is bad at reading between the lines, but this utterance seems to suggest that he's done something right, made it good for John, which is all that matters.
Sherlock has got used to the fact that his body still wants the kick – despite telling his brother and everyone else who cares to listen that he's a
“Turn around and walk back the way you came now,” he tells him and looks at John's silver-blond hair, his black leather jacket, the familiar way he carries himself as he walks closer.
“It wouldn’t do you justice anyway,” Holmes whispers, his lashes tickling my own. “You’re a delicacy which needs to be savoured slowly.” He pulls back and gazes at me. He looks beautifully inebriated. “An intricate machinery that needs to be taken apart…” He licks his lips, slowly, mesmerisingly. I stare. “Examined with the utmost care…” White teeth press into the plump pinkness of a full, luscious bottom lip.
As he approaches the school gates, the large oaken doors open, and he can already spot Rosie skipping down the stairs, surrounded by her classmates. They all scatter in the schoolyard, greeted by their mums and dads and caretakers. John walks closer, and as she races across the lawn, spirited and full of confidence, he thinks to himself, a bit bittersweetly, that she’s not so
Sherlock steps in front of him then and lowers himself down on his knees, his expensive trousers scraping the floor, collecting dust and tiny splinters of wood as he does so.
She bites her lip and looks at the floor, and I wonder if I might have sent out misleading signals. She looks a little drunk, but not drunk enough to forget herself, so she probably thought it was worth a shot. Perhaps she sensed the physical attraction that I can’t deny I’m feeling. Maybe she’s just looking for a bit of fun. I should never have agreed to this.
"Look at me, love," he says softly, intentionally using the term of endearment to get his point across.
He tries not to think about Mary, but does so anyway. He asks himself if Sherlock feels bad about hurting her, too. He almost certainly does.
After the fourth, fifth, sixth time, Sherlock's whole frame is vibrating, and it's the most wonderful sight. He is falling apart under John's hands. John wants to feel it, all of it, so he lets go of his leg and changes his position to lie down next to him, which causes his fingers to slip free of Sherlock's body by accident.
. I turned into the person I never wanted to become. I hate myself for it, and I cannot take it back. Never, Sherlock. I'll never forgive myself for doing that to you."
“I want to lie down with you,” he whispers into Sherlock’s ear. “The couch, the bed… I don’t care. I want to touch you, feel you. I want to undress you.”
He sucks me in time with the shudders running through me, and after a while, my brain catches up with events again. He’s moaning softly and caressing my thighs with long, calming strokes, and I take a deep breath and ruffle his hair to get him to look up.
My stomach clenches – I’m completely useless. I should have convinced Mycroft to let me come with him.
It was a beautiful ceremony, a beautiful reception, and he's got a beautiful wife. Everything's perfect, just the way they (she) imagined it, wanted it.
“I can still feel you inside of me,” I whisper into his mouth. “It’s the closest I’ve ever been to anybody. I’ll always feel you there, no matter how long we’ll be apart. Always.”
They stumble into the room and somehow Sherlock has the presence of mind to lock both the bedroom and the bathroom door to keep out any surprise visitors. And then, they’re kissing again, deeply and urgently, and Sherlock removes his hand from John’s crotch to cup the side of his face and to trace his cheekbone with his thumb. John can smell himself on Sherlock’s skin, shuddering at the shockwave of arousal hitting him squarely in the guts in response to it.
His choice of words is endearing and insanely arousing at the same time, and John growls and grinds his own hardness against Sherlock's hip to take the edge off his need.
Sherlock begins to stir. He makes a sleepy, happy noise of approval and shifts his legs to wrap them around John’s.
His entire midsection is on fire, and for a brief moment he reconsiders his plan to take all of this slow and make it last as long as possible. Sherlock’s divine mouth makes it quite difficult to think, and even more difficult to hold back.
sorry I made you think you were. I was weak, and I couldn't handle being alone with a child so suddenly. I was looking for someone to blame, and you were the easiest choice. Forgive me, Sherlock. Please stop now… Stop thinking like that. It's not true. It never was. Please acknowledge that
"Of course," John says. With one arm, he pulls the duvet up and covers himself and Sherlock with it, and then he draws him closer against himself again and shuts his eyes. "Of course."
And it made me angry! It didn't stop me from letting it all out on you! And I might do it again! Do you understand?!"
John smiles up at him, letting him rest on the flat of his tongue, his sharp, slightly bitter flavour tickling his palate. Then, after a final long, languid suck, he lets him go.
I think I’m shouting, but I’m not sure, and I don’t care. I’m burning all over, my skin slick with sweat, my hands trembling around his head. It goes on forever.
Sherlock turns the two of them around, taking hold of John's upper arms, and John is forcefully reminded of the countless occasions on which he did the exact same thing – all of them having occurred before the worst day, and never again afterwards.
Sherlock takes off his sunglasses and pulls down the hood of his jumper, revealing a mop of unruly curls.
Sherlock smiles and drops the crumpled tissue on the floor before cuddling up to John's side and running his fingers through his hair.
“You’re my favourite grown-ups,” Rosie impatiently responds as she reaches into her school bag and retrieves a folded piece of paper.
An animalistic grunt makes its way out of his throat then, and Sherlock senses him letting go before it happens and braces himself for the impact. John pounds into him hard as he reaches his peak, going so deep that pleasure almost borders on pain.
When Sherlock closes his eyes and smiles at the ceiling, giving himself over to John's ministrations without holding back, John suddenly sees the man he used to be, that graceful, otherworldly creature with creamy skin and raven hair, a Greek statue come to life, something so breathtakingly beautiful that John could never really fully comprehend why he chose
His beard brushes my length, chafes the thin, sensitive skin, and my thighs fall open without me telling them to. He chuckles darkly.
I hold on to his shoulders and step out of my clothes, and he helps me to remove my socks before caressing up my calves and the backs of my thighs.
“I’ll talk to Mary tomorrow,” he says, holding Sherlock’s inscrutable gaze. “I--- I wish we’d done this sooner, Sherlock. I wish---”
He sighs, his voice catching in the back of his throat, and for a little while it looks as if he wanted to cry, too. I watch him silently, waiting for him to speak again.
thankful that he's had this, has been allowed to hold it in his hands, his arms, for almost forty years, that he doesn't know how to deal with it.
He opens his lids and looks at me with so much pain in his eyes that I feel it hit me like something solid, something alive and vicious that’s threatening to sweep him away in its wake and leave me alone to grasp at thin, empty air.
Sherlock sounds as if he's hyperventilating, but he does it again, and again. John feels lightheaded with lust; his loins are burning up from the inside.
“Well, I never! Why didn’t you ever tell me? Who knows what could have occured! What if I had shown up a client, or, God beware, Inspector Lestrade? I would never have forgiven myself!”
have assumed that John would ever return the sentiment – or that he himself would ever be able to express it.
He can't say all that out loud, because it's insane and he's out of his mind with what surely is, simply has to be,
“I’ve dreamt about this for so long,” he says huskily, still caressing me, still avoiding the place I want to feel him most. The teasing is slowly driving me insane, but I also wish he never had to stop. “I touched myself thinking about it, about
Sherlock can't bear it. He can't catch hold of a thought to calm himself, can't get his body to relax, and thinking of John in Mary's arms, a blissful smile on his soot-streaked face, only makes it worse.
there. He doesn't want to go back there just yet. For a second he wonders if it was a good idea to get wasted on a weekday – he has to work tomorrow, and his patients won't appreciate him coming to the clinic reeking of alcohol. But who cares. He can always call in sick.
Slowly, so very slowly, I continue my approach. I can smell him now, his skin, his breath, smoke and tea and petrichor, and I want all that on my tongue, my lips, more than I have ever wanted anything before. I want to feel the shape of that gorgeous Cupid’s bow, want to trace it,
so much, so irrationally, and the fact that he is is at the same time the reason why he has to cast aside all the foolish sentiment making his heart burst and do what's right, what's
"I need you," he says against the younger man's soft, delicious lips before he can stop himself. "All of you. Make love to me.
When Sherlock nudges his thigh and signals him to turn around, he complies willingly. He rolls onto his back and opens his legs for him, and Sherlock lies down on top of him, so slender, all his muscles quivering, and that's when John snaps out of his stupor and remembers that Sherlock has never done this before.
single day. And I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. I love you. I--- I'll never have the words to tell you how much. You're allowed to mock me for this, but… you're the light of my life, Sherlock. I know you don't care about the solar system, but you're--- you're my sun."
"Special occasion, yes?" Angelo asks and puts one hand on Sherlock's shoulder, the other one on John's. "Anniversary?"
"You can touch," John mutters and nibbles his way along his jaw and down to the side of his neck, and Sherlock realises that his hand has strayed towards John's flank out of its own accord, his fingers skimming the outer edge of his abdomen, and it's clear which direction it really wants to take, even though Sherlock would swear that he doesn't have a say in the matter right now.
, but he’s very insistent, and in the end we make a compromise. Three more days of pampering (“You’ve got to
He rubs his cheek up and down my throat, teasing me, his mouth open, his breath fast and hot and moist. I moan, and my hips buck upwards out of their own acccord. My body's reacting to him without me piloting it, and I guess it's alright. He'll guide. I'll follow. My subconscious seems to know what to do.
"That's my--- shower gel..." Sherlock pants and feels stupid, because of course John knows that it's his shower gel; he
The rough urgency of his movements is such a turn-on. I nudge his entrance again, the touch slick and slippery this time, and he bucks against me and bites my ear. His breath is searing hot on my skin.
He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s back and clutches onto him as tightly as possible, kissing his head again, a bed of soft curls brushing against his nose. John loves this man with every fibre of his being, and some days he can’t even fathom how lucky he is.
John's hand is soft and warm as he puts it on his cheek, and Sherlock's system, unfamiliar with physical contact of this kind, doesn't know what to do with the sensation. He shudders. The wave runs through his body from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, leaving him trembling. He can't remember the last time someone touched him like this. Might have been Mrs Hudson. Might as well have been Mummy, years and years ago.
Sherlock gasps when he pulls him towards himself by the lapels of his coat and slings his arms around him underneath, digging his fingers into his shoulder blades. Sherlock flinches, but doesn't try to move away.
Only when I’m finished do I realise how quiet he’s become. He’s not moving, not even blinking, only staring at me with wide, incredulous eyes.
"Your father would have hated it," Sherlock then states and, who would have doubted it, hits the nail on the head with it.
He runs his hand through the cleft of John's buttocks, up and down, and feels his rhythm falter. The sound of his own voice, hard and clipped, shocks him, but he can’t stop.
John, sitting cross-legged on the floor, lets his hands sink into his lap then and fixes his eyes on the vision insisting that he's the real thing while behaving so out of character that it hurts his head to witness it. He wants to believe him, with every fibre of his being, but the rational part of his brain is reluctant to do so.
- the things you are afraid of… I know they won't repeat themselves. I don't know anything about relationships or how they work, but I know that despite
bare skin, and he remembers a half-whispered, breathless conversation about STDs and bedside drawers containing (John's) and not containing lube (Sherlock's, and that will have to change) that should have felt significantly more awkward than it actually did.
"Stop thinking," Sherlock tells him (and himself) and holds him tighter still. "Just… please. I can't."
Finally, Sherlock shakes himself out of his stupor. He takes a deep, silent breath, his chest heaving against John's. Then he moves his head and presses a long kiss against his sternum, a tender, chaste kiss that is still filled with so much honest meaning that it makes John feel lightheaded for a moment.
Why is John doing this? Out of a sense of obligation as his former best friend? Because he's a doctor? Because he hasn't realised that he doesn't
I rock him back and forth as much as his injuries allow me to and hum against his temple to calm him, and after a while I can feel the tension in his muscles dissolve.
A short walk through the frozen grass, saying goodbye to the garden, their bench under the willow tree, the bees.
“Have I ever let you down, Sherlock? In the first few weeks of our acquaintance, I was willing to kill for you, and did. I was willing to be blown up for you along with the man who’s now making our lives hell. What more do you want?
“Doctor?” Mary frowns at me and holds out a chart, waiting for me to take it. “This is Mr Smith. He’s complaining about---”
"Sherlock, please." I sit down again. I want to touch him, but I don't dare to. "I was being stupid,
John puts his index finger on Sherlock’s lips to shush him. “Sleep apnoea’s treatable. And stop trying to ruin my sweeping romantic sentiments with logic.”
John almost wishes he'd shout at him. He wishes Sherlock was angrier. He doesn't know how to deal with this level of understanding, somehow. It feels wrong. It
Sherlock's words reverberate in the otherwise silent hallway. John stares at him, a violent shiver running down his spine. He's both hot
Everything inside Sherlock turns cold. He's going to leave him now, after everything they've just done, and all because he loses grasp of his own brain whenever they're together and even more so when they're together like
"Yes. It's him," I reply and finally get up to walk around my desk and position myself between them.
Sherlock exhales through his nose, and there are tears in his eyes now. Mrs Hudson gets up and wraps her arms around him, unaware of his wounds, and he flinches. She backs off immediately.
We have a cup of tea together and chat about work, his wife, the weather, but he leaves soon afterwards. He doesn’t know how to behave around me, and I can relate. What do you say to a man supposedly mourning his best friend, his partner, the love of his life?
"Hrrmmm… Octopus," John grumbles sleepily when he tries to roll onto his side and Sherlock follows immediately, his arm slung around his middle.
Poor Sherlock. I know what happens to his brain when there's too much input of the kind he finds difficult to process - human interaction exhausts him.
I exhale into the crook of his neck, bite his shoulder, then lave the spot with my tongue to soothe the pain.
“Come on,” John says softly and grins at him. “You’re thinking so loudly that it’s sort of distracting. You can at least tell me what it is that’s keeping you from enjoying my endeavours to get you naked.”
“Yes, baby, I’m here. Calm down now… Just breathe with me, okay? Just breathe. It’ll be alright,” I tell him – and myself.
Sherlock feels his body go into panic mode and fights to stay in control, to not lose the mood of only moments before, when everything was not alright, far from it, but not like
They’re flying steadily now, leaving the wall of thunderclouds behind them, and everybody jumps when the Captain speaks again.
. He is quiet, and although my ability to deduce people is mediocre at best, I know that he is thinking about it, too.
"I'm that fish," Sherlock says after a long period of silence in which they listened to David Attenborough explaining how Japanese pufferfish attract mates by creating intricate patterns in the sand at the ocean floor.
Talking dirty has always been a crucial part of sex for him, so he’s happy when Sherlock groans and runs his nails down his spine and whispers: “Keep talking to me…”
We stay like that for quite some time, joined in this passionate, most intimate embrace, but not moving save for the rapid rising and falling of our chests and the wanderings of my mouth, which keeps raining feather-light caresses and gentle praise onto every inch of him I can reach. This is not only about him needing time to get used to the physical presence of me inside of him, I realise. This is him showing me all of himself, allowing me access to his most well-kept secrets - his heart; his human soul. It must take him an immense effort. That he deems me worthy of it makes me prouder than I could ever express.
"I love you too, John," he says, still holding John's face, his eyes dark and intense. "I've never been good with words, but I do hope you know that. You're my all. I--- There's always been only you. Only you. Always."
John puts his arm back around Sherlock's shoulders and presses a long, hard kiss against his neck. He's always envied his lover a bit in that respect – he's never found it as easy as Sherlock to come without extra stimulation.
"Darling…" he starts, but trails off, his head empty now, all the carefully thought-out words forgotten.
His tears have dried up, it seems. He sounds tired and empty now. Sherlock doesn't know what's worse.
“Sherlock,” I say carefully and put my palm on his shoulder, not caressing him, just pressing down a little to show him I’m there. “You’re not weak. You went through hell for us. For
“I'm sorry, John,” he breathes and places a light, barely-there kiss onto my exposed skin, right next to the bandage. “I'm sorry.”
"Patience, my love…" he tells Sherlock and himself in equal measures and pulls back to let his index finger join the proceedings.
The look of confusion that gets him is better than the hopeless one from before, so John congratulates himself.
He steps right in front of me then, so close that I have to crane my neck to be able to properly see his face. We’re not touching, but I can feel the heat radiating off his body.
I shrug and try to ignore the new surge of arousal spreading through my nerves as the implications of his question fill my brain with images of the two of us finally going at it without the hindrance of his injured body. I could get hard again right now. He’s like an aphrodisiac – just
John, who is wearing only a dressing gown, open at the front, and nothing underneath except his perfect, golden skin. John, who is putting items on his bedside table – a bottle of lubricant, a packet of condoms, and a baby monitor.
“If you ever feel like it’s getting too much… or if I do something you don’t like… just let me know, and I’ll stop. Just say the word, Sherlock,” John says, surprised when Sherlock suddenly reaches down to touch his cheek with his fingertips.
It's time to tell her; John knows. This is his last chance to come clean. And yet it's difficult to look into his own flesh and blood's eyes and admit the things he'd rather choose to forget.
"I want you in my mouth, baby…" he tells him, his voice rough and sultry, the way he knows Sherlock enjoys it. "I want to taste you…"
Sherlock lets out a long, shaky breath and leans down to lick John's throat, and then he pulls out almost entirely and comes back with a smooth, controlled, absolutely fucking
Sherlock also sometimes wonders what Mary meant when she said that she knew what he and John could become once she was gone. She seemed convinced they could go back to what they were before she came along, and despite his fear of having broken things between them that can't be mended, Sherlock wants to trust her. He's come to terms with the fact that John will never reciprocate his feelings in all their intensity. He'd never get involved like that with another man – he's stated that numerous times. And even if he
John bites his lip, hard, and another streak of Cowper's fluid hits Sherlock palate. Sherlock is impressed that he still manages to keep his eyes open and fixed on him - he seems so far gone already.
They rock back and forth together, more and more slowly, and John feels a pleasant tingling sensation now spreading from his middle into his hands and feet.
“I am very aware of that. But I cannot resist the temptation to touch you. Prepare yourself, because I will take absolutely
Not needing to be asked twice, John scrambles to his feet and lies down beside him, or rather halfway on top of him, and they meet in a long, heated kiss that’s nothing like the ones they shared that first time when John caught his friend alone in this very room, touching himself while thinking of him.
, if he stopped believing you’ll be there to welcome him home, there’d be nothing left to keep him from becoming either reckless or indifferent when it comes to valuing his own life. Considering the circumstances he finds himself in at the moment, both could lead to the most dreadful outcomes.”
When Rosie starts to fall asleep halfway through the movie, sprawled out into both of their laps at once, John picks her up to take her to her bedroom, upon which she stirs, gazes at him blearily, and says: “But I want my bedtime story first.”
"I’m happy for you," she says and smiles warmly. The laughter lines around her eyes are crinkling, but they can't hide the slight hint of apprehension in her gaze. "I’ve always hoped this day would eventually come. In fact… I think I knew it would."
Sherlock stays completely still for a second, studying John's face, but then purses his lips and frowns at him.
“If I ever lost you, I’d perish,” he then says, his voice a low rumble that crawls under my skin and sends shivers down my spine. I can tell he is struggling to make himself speak. “Earlier, when we arrived here, I pictured coming home to an empty flat, coming home to find your chair in front of the fireplace, your dressing gown on the hook by the door… knowing your body was lying, cold and lifeless, in the morgue at St. Bart's. I--- I
Sherlock grins tiredly. He doesn't complain when John takes his time cleaning him up, but just stretches himself like a lazy cat and lets it happen, his stomach rippling whenever one of those sweet little sparks of pleasure-pain shoots through him.
He thrusts from below to hit Sherlock’s prostate and tries to drag his abdomen along the underside of his cock as he speeds up his pace. He needs him to get there first.
Sherlock pulls back his hand, slowly, carefully, and wipes it on the sheet - he wanted to hurt him, just a little, when he did what he did, wanted to punish him, but now he feels ashamed.
“Mary kissed you,” I mutter and suck at his clavicle, mapping the cluster of freckles there with my tongue.
Sherlock blinks up at him, a vision of innocence, and removes his tongue from where it was busy rubbing teasing circles against John’s perineum.
"I know, and I deserve it. But please… Let me explain. Please, Sherlock. You can send me away afterwards, but I need to explain."
Then he pushes me down and cants his hips upwards at the same time, and I relax and allow him to slide inside, suppressing the urge to heave when he nudges the back of my throat.
"Half an hour ago you proclaimed your sexual versatility without hesitation. Loudly, I might add," he says.
. He has to settle for a handjob instead, but this time he can watch Sherlock's face when he reaches his peak, and it's out-of-this-world gorgeous.
On his knees, he shuffles forwards again until he's close enough to touch – but he doesn't, not yet.
Sherlock huffs and mutters something unintelligible under his breath, rubbing his slightly raspy cheek against his skin, and John knows that no one’s going to go anywhere right now, not even to the bathroom to get a flannel and some warm water. They’ll be sticking together
“I’ll be back in a few weeks,” he says, and his voice sounds much softer now. “It might take some time to get to him. Don’t worry if you don’t hear from me – I won’t be able to communicate once I’m there.”
“Oh, let me put it like this… I was beyond grateful for the thickness of the towels. Even a splendid mind like mine cannot always control an over-enthusiastic body. Not when it comes to you.”
It doesn't help that this morning started with a visit from his tedious brother, the sudden discovery of his phone's new personalised message alert (which, frustratingly, he can't get rid of, whatever he tries), and Mrs Hudson announcing her unsolicited opinions on both.
After tending to his wounds and spreading a light blanket over his naked back to keep him warm, I change into my pyjamas. Then I get my bedding from my room and put it on the floor right next to his bed. I’ll watch over him tonight, and tomorrow. If he lets me, I’ll watch over him
He smiles a little, and it looks so lovely that I want to kiss him all over again. I don't, for the time being, since I'm not sure yet where this will lead. Does Sherlock have… sex? I always thought he was above such mundane, irrational things.
"So it wasn't the riding crop she used on you?" John asks with an air of defiance. "Or the milky white,
to talk about his guilt and exhaustion in only slight variations of the conversation that started it all and long, sad silences that we spend with him sitting or lying beside me, holding my hand. Sometimes he cries. Sometimes I read to him from his favourite book on bees. Sometimes we watch reruns of Doctor Who on the telly.
Sherlock’s staring at him now, his lids heavy, his body slumped back into his chair, and he looks so inebriated that John jumps a little when he suddenly puts down his glass and moves to slide to the floor in a surprisingly graceful motion, coming to rest on his knees right in front of him.
John remembers Sherlock's bloody face and the way his pulse fluttered against his palm as he almost strangled him. He feels terrible, mind-numbing fear take over his whole body, chilling him to the bone. How could he promise that he'd better himself? It's inside of him, and it's always been there, ever since he was a boy. Why should it disappear just like that?
"I’m sorry. I realise it must be strange for you. I shouldn’t have brought it up," he says. "Let’s not think about it right now."
I roll over and cuddle up in his duvet, soaking up the faint traces of his presence still lingering in the fabric. I changed the sheets after the first time, of course, but he’s still here. This whole room is still full of
and no fuss at all tells him that the other man is indeed exhausted, and he makes sure that Sherlock's pyjamas are back in order before getting up to pick the duvet up from the floor and tuck him in again.
When he eventually joins Mary in their bed, she mumbles sleepily and rolls over and nestles up against his side.
He looks around himself in confusion, and it all comes back to him with so much force that it causes him to stagger on his feet.
Sherlock's pulse accelerates, a mixture of apprehension and curious expectation filling his insides.
John’s eyes snap shut and he presses his heels into the bed, his lower body straining to buck upwards, to get more contact, to
He hiccoughs lowly. His large hands grip my nightshirt and hold onto it, twisting the fabric in their grip in an incoherent gesture of despair.
“Do you mean sudden bursts of gloomy boredom? Or insensitive remarks you do not even realise you’re making? Or severed limbs in the fridge? Or extreme fits of possessive behaviour-slash-jealousy? Because I think we’ve been in a relationship for years now, Sherlock, probably ever since we moved in together.”
Sherlock's arms and legs go tense around him; the movements of his hips stutter and lose their rhythm.
John almost laughs at his friend’s presence of mind amidst the most incredible sex he’s had in a long time, but he’s also thankful for this piece of information. He knows he’s clean as well. He wants to do it so badly, and despite his earlier doubts, he suddenly can’t see any reason why he shouldn’t.
Sherlock utters something that can only be described as a grunt of delight, and John thinks it’s the most erotic sound he’s ever heard. His friend’s whole body is vibrating, and when he scissors his fingers to stretch him further, Sherlock’s hips jerk forwards and their erections slip-slide against each other, wet with lube and precome. It feels divine.
They took their time preparing him, so he's already become familiar with the pulsing, burning sensation that’s by now spreading from his entrance into every fibre of his being, but when Sherlock begins to rock his hips, he's overwhelmed by what it does to him. It's not more than very careful, very shallow thrusting, but it's already so different from feeling his fingers move and probe; it's much more intense, and John slings his legs around Sherlock's hips to ground himself. He needs as much body contact as possible right now.
"You never know what the future might bring, Sherlock," he says. "Not with these things, you don't. The trick is not to overthink it all."
He swallows and closes his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. It's more difficult than he thought. Telling himself that it has to be like this, that there's absolutely no other way, he then opens his lids again and slowly reaches out to put the key into the lock.
"You wanted him to think that I'm capable of making friends, even finding a lover," Sherlock answers his own question, his tone still neutral, but laced with a barely discernible trace of something dangerous. "You sensed his condescension before he verbalised it and wanted to pay him back for it."
"You're not going alone. This place is huge. We only have one torch. If something happened to you, it could take me ages to find you."
John smiles and runs the pads of his thumbs along Sherlock’s cheekbones. He’s always wanted to do that, ever since that first dinner at Angelo’s. Candlelight makes them stand out even more, but this, this is good too. Dreary London morning sun and speckles of dust floating through his field of vision, and Sherlock in his arms, still shaking from the impact of John’s mouth on his.
I writhe and buck and pull at the pillow my head is resting on, not knowing where to put my hands to keep at least a tiny grasp on reality. He's driving me wild, and we haven't even really started yet.
I’m making an atheist call out for God, I think and want to laugh. I want to make him say it over and over again, make him scream it in ecstasy while he spills himself inside my mouth, but I also want so much more tonight, so I slow down after bobbing my head a few times and carefully pull back, licking him all the way up until he slips out of me with a soft
John takes in his gaunt features, his bald head, the bony hands resting, one on top of the other, against his chest. He's like a tiny bird, fresh out of the egg, without feathers, and without protection.
“You’ve never behaved like “just a guest” around here before. Why start now?” She giggles nervously. “And… I should say--- well, I’m happy for you.”
I run my hand through his hair – because I’ve always wanted to do that, and because I sense that he needs comforting, too.
Sherlock shrugs, looking bemused. “It wasn’t as bad as I had anticipated,” he confesses. “People did seem to enjoy themselves.”
He gestures at his crotch, and when he follows the movement with his eyes, Sherlock can see what he means. While he himself has already managed to talk himself out of his erection quite successfully (his long years of practice proving useful at last), the evidence of John's arousal is still very obvious. He feels the urge to go and
The door behind him opens with a small creak, and he half-turns his head and looks up, his hands now clasped in front of his mouth. He's scared he might scream, or say something weird. He's scared he's going insane.
He's picturing Sherlock slipping his hand inside his jacket, his long, nimble fingers making their way across his chest, his touch light, but determined. And suddenly it's no longer his stupid phone he's going for, but the buttons of his shirt, the zipper of his trousers---
The last thing John sees before he closes his lids is Sherlock's upturned face, his impossible eyes twinkling at him, his soft, loving smile curving his rosy lips. The smile that belongs to him, and him alone.
“Sherlock will do, thank you,” he quips, then immediately grimaces in embarrassment. “I apologise. That was awful. I--- I seem to be nervous.”
Sherlock smiles slightly, his forehead coming to rest on John’s, and he lets out a tiny sigh. “It’s not myself I worry about, John.”
"I'm sorry," Sherlock murmurs again. "So sorry, little bee. I'm sorry. Please--- forgive him. Forgive
"I'm sorry, John," he repeats, not really sure what he's apologising for but feeling like he needs to nonetheless.
By now I've perfected the art of suppressing physical reactions to stimuli of all sorts - pain, delight, fear, arousal - but I'm very sure that this, this aching desire pulling at my insides whenever I look at him, will not go away, no matter how hard I try. He's the failure in my otherwise perfectly functioning system, and he's always been. No matter what he's done. No matter what he'll do in the future.
His train of thought stops abruptly when Sherlock takes his right hand and puts it back between his legs.
“We discussed it today, after coming home from the hospital,” I elaborate haphazardly. “It appears that my getting injured brought to the surface some--- facts that should have been addressed in the past, but never were.”
You’re here with me now, my love. It makes me forget the pain as my hands and feet start to burn. Your tender kiss takes away the agony of my muscles contracting all at once, trying to fight a hopeless battle that has long been lost.
Lily raises her head as well, and he can see that her cheeks are wet and her eyes have turned puffy and red.
," Sherlock sighs against John's mouth, their foreheads pressed together, and it's so unlike him to speak like that that John's heart skips a beat. "You make me feel things I'd never dreamed of feeling before you came along and showed them to me. Thank you.
, and then they're kissing, and he closes his lids and pulls at the Belstaff and feels the fingers of their joined hands entwine.
now, and although it’s confusing and he feels terrible for cheating on the woman he thought he loved and wanted to marry, he’s sure that it’s the right thing to do. He wonders if Sherlock leaving was the thing that made him realise how much he needs him in his life, how much he means to him - how much
, and Sherlock keeps looking at him and whimpers, then opens his mouth in a silent scream, his eyes wide open. At the edge of his field of vision, John sees him stroke himself with something close to desperation, so fast that his hand is a mere blur, and he can
Sherlock tastes salt on his lips. He reaches out with his free hand as if he could take hold of John's that way, and John mirrors the movement, his fingers grasping at thin air.
"Actually," Sherlock says, and John wants to giggle, because a lecture in the nude is not nearly as annoying as a normal one, "what I think you mean is 'beach glass'. Sea glass is physically and chemically weathered glass that is usually found on beaches along bodies of salt water. These weathering processes produce natural frosted glass. Beach glass comes from fresh water and in most cases has a different pH balance and a less frosted appearance. The last time I checked, my eyes did
John's face twists into an expression that looks like a mixture of agony and amusement and thus overtaxes Sherlock's ability to deduce his mood, so he waits for further clues.
John smiles to himself. Although he knows he shouldn’t encourage Sherlock with his crazy ideas, it’s always difficult to say no to him when his face lights up like that. “It’s wonderful to see your enthusiasm,” he says, “but I’m...not quite sure severed body parts are allowed inside a primary school.”
Sherlock is falling asleep in his arms now; John can tell from the way his breathing is evening out, and he closes his own eyes, too, and inhales his scent, his
Sherlock's face swims before his eyes, and John's got a split second to realise that that's partly down to the tears forming in his eyes and partly to the fact that Sherlock is leaning in, closer,
I rub my hands across my face in a nervous gesture I cannot control, then let them sink into my lap again. I feel weak. He is mute for so long that I start to suspect that this was too much, too soon - that my worst fear will come true and Holmes will tell me that I have misread the signs, that he is not of this disposition, that I should leave and never come back. Despite the rising urge inside of me to do or say something,
I kiss his forehead and wonder what he sees when he closes his eyes. Does he see himself running from people, being hurt by them? Or does he see himself being the one who does the hurting? Does he see himself shooting someone? Does he see his hand driving a blade into a living, breathing body, causing blood to gush over his fingers?
He loves to worship a partner with words, and Sherlock, who even manages to awaken that urge in him when he's fully dressed and bending over a bloody corpse, has done so ever since that very first day, is worship-worthy in more ways than anyone he's ever met before. And he apparently needs the confirmation and encouragement, so they complement each other perfectly.
Finally, after endless minutes have passed us by in that fashion, I feel his passage ripple around my length and then open up completely, allowing me to slide inside even further, and it is such a divine sensation that I cannot help but grunt in delight.
I purse my lips, wondering if I should say what’s on my mind. Then I just do. Whatever’s happening in Serbia right now, it’s highly probable that it’s not good.
Before he's even finished the last word, Sherlock has already drawn him in and crashed their faces together, and John gasps into the space between them and tilts his head, giving Sherlock's tongue and lips free rein. Sherlock takes advantage of that immediately and licks into John's mouth, making it deft and thorough, just the way he knows he likes it. His fingers make short work of the dressing gown, pushing it off John's shoulders and down his arms, and it slithers to the floor and pools at their feet.
He doesn’t know what else to say, what to do to make this better, so he simply closes the distance between them with three deft steps and wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist. The other man’s expression doesn’t betray any emotions whatsoever. John gets on his toes and bumps his nose against Sherlock’s, asking for permission, and when Sherlock tilts his head and closes his eyes, he leans forwards the rest of the way and brushes his lips with a slow, tentative kiss.
. Sherlock is crying out his name, repeats it like a mantra, making sounds John has never heard before, his voice raw and hoarse, and eventually grips John's wrist to hold on tight, and that's when John realises that he should probably take his hand away now if he ever wants to do this again.
“This happened to you because of me,” he said, in a vacant voice, as soon as Mrs Hudson had ushered us inside, and then he rejected her worried offers of help and steered me up the stairs and into our quarters. “I’m deeply sorry,” he added once he had assisted me in removing my hat and coat.
, and John doesn't mention it. He trails along on investigations whenever he finds the time and someone to look after Rosie, and they have tea and takeaway that John forces on him more or less successfully, and it's okay – it really is.
"I'm not good at this, John, as you're well aware," he says. "I--- Experiences I made in the past taught me that I'm probably not suited for relationships of any kind."
And Sherlock is a marvel. I’m flabbergasted by his epiphany as to Moriarty’s message, and seeing him tap out the long sequence of binary code he planted in his brain when he visited him after the trial felt almost unreal. I’ve lived with him for so long, but watching him demonstrate his remarkable skills is still something that amazes me beyond belief.
I pull him towards me. His nose is brushing mine now. I can't see his eyes anymore. His breath is hot against my cheeks. His fingers bury themselves into my t-shirt, grab a handful of it, twist it in their grasp.
is still echoing in the back of his head, and he wants to punch him for it. And, what's more, he's sure there were
They kiss and kiss, and Sherlock almost forgets to breathe while trying to memorise the sweet taste of John's tongue in his mouth.
No one has ever said his name like that before, and the many variations that Sherlock uses in different contexts—impossible to keep apart by an outsider, but filled with multitudes of meaning to John—are enough to last him a lifetime.
It begins as a slow, shuddering wave that goes through him from head to toe, but intensifies quickly, and Sherlock feels hot tears trickle into the space between them and carefully puts his arms around him to comfort him somehow, even if he has no idea what has set all this in motion - John seems so small right now, and yet so fierce, so dangerously fragile, as if he might explode at the slightest touch.
Of course I know that this, this beautiful thing we’re doing together, will not be enough to make everything whole again. It won’t be easy all the time. All I can do is hope it will be alright in the end.
My heart racing, I take his face in my hands and brush his cheekbones with my thumbs, wiping off the moisture gathering there in the process.
“Holmes,” I mutter and lean forwards ever so slightly, surrendering to the heady, irresistible pull drawing me towards him. “
He trails his palms down Sherlock’s long, lean back, very gently. His breath hitches as he traces the gnarly ridges of the scars littering it with his fingertips, trying desperately not to think about how he’d nearly lost him back then.
spend most of the journey to Duncton kissing and holding hands, and John is thankful that the driver humoured them, but now that they're naked and getting ready for their bath, he senses that a shadow has fallen across Sherlock's soul.
He doesn’t answer. I look at his gaunt face, and now that I’m taking my time to do so, I can see the marks his experiences left on his once so youthful features. There are lines that weren’t there two years ago, and a few small, faded scars, and a bitter expression of grief around his mouth that seems to be there to stay.
him, even. Sherlock's brain is muddled most of the time, sometimes because of the pills and needles he sneaks in whenever he gets the opportunity (it's easiest with Molly, most difficult with Mycroft), and sometimes because his body wants more, more-more-
Lady Emmeline Marlowe-Mottershead watches men in blue protective suits collect her bones from the niche in the wall where they've been waiting to be found for forty-three years, hidden by a portrait of her younger self. Eccentric, this placement, they said when her now deceased husband ordered it to be put up so close to the floor, and then they all turned away and didn't pay it a second thought. All except one, that is, but at the time it happened, that one wasn't even one year old.
"Sherlock… I can't believe how lucky I am," John mumbles softly, and it sounds amazed. "I can't believe you're still here with me."
“I am currently experiencing a most irrational streak of jealousy,” he murmurs after a moment. “I’m sorry. It will pass.”
John never could have guessed how difficult it would be for them to say goodbye at the end of the day. He had assumed Sherlock would be bursting through the exits, ready to head home, but he willingly stays and speaks with every person there. Every child who wants to say hello and give him a high-five and tell him he’s their hero. Every adult who wants to thank him and John for the “amazing work” they do. Even Mrs. Wallace extends a grateful hand and lets them know how much she truly appreciates them being there.
torment him, of course it does, and he’s sad that Mary will have to mourn him, but the most present image in his mind is still
“Yes,” he gasps, and I look up to see him bury his head in my pillow. His raven hair looks beautiful, standing out sharply against the white linen. “Again.”
John asks himself how unexpected a storm like this can be – aren’t they supposed to check the weather forecast before authorising a flight?
They’ve stopped talking. The only sounds breaking the silence of the room are those of wet, hungry kisses, heavy breathing, and the occasional slapping of skin against skin. The air around them is thick with perspiration and the scent of sex. Sherlock tastes delicious, of salt and himself, and John sucks his tongue into his mouth again and again, addicted to it. He's soaked in sweat, burning all over, but he's not done yet, oh, far from it. This is perfect. It's slow and tantalising, the way they move together, and it hasn't felt like this for a long while. Sherlock feels more open, somehow, more vulnerable, but also so much more receptive than usual, and John is sure that it has something to do with him shaking off a few of the demons of his past today.
Sherlock’s armchair creaks, telling him that his friend has just risen from it. Soft, slippered footsteps make their way over to him, and then there’s body heat, right behind his back, and in the window’s reflection he can make out the tall shape of the most important person in his life.
He wishes they'd told John about the plan, but it's too late now. Somewhere out there, a sniper is pointing his rifle at the man who means the world to him. For a brief moment, Sherlock is amused by the paradox – here he is, loving,
“Yes,” he slurs and pulls himself up and against John’s front to make room. John aligns his cock with his opening and then guides him back down and onto himself.
"Stop apologising, please. I--- I'll need some time to process all this. And we'll need to give the kids a chance to see you one last time, even if they won't know…"
John moves his hands over Sherlock’s cotton shirt, glides them up his shoulders and neck. He strokes the side of Sherlock’s cheek, runs his thumb over his sharp cheekbone, and keeps it there. “It’s alright, love,” he says to him.
"It was extremely arousing to watch you lose yourself. And you have to keep in mind that I've got a lot of catching up to do."
He remembers what happened yesterday and revels in the memories for a while, storing them in his mind palace, preserving them. He never wants to forget. He gets lost in the pleasant ripples of John's imaginary caress and almost gives in to the desire flaring up in him. He's so used to taking care of his needs on his own. However, he stops himself after one slow, lazy stroke – he wants to wait, to do it with John, soon.
They all talk to him, but something has happened to his ears. It's like they're stuffed with cotton wool. He doesn't understand a word. Suddenly he realises that his legs are moving, but he doesn't know where he's walking. A small, but strong hand is holding his, and there's a familiar trace of powdery perfume, and a purple sleeve.
He swallows audibly. I smile against his skin and move my mouth to his other buttock, kissing him there as well.
Sherlock inclines his head, signalling him that he’s listening. John braces himself. This moment will be his second crossroads in two days.
When it takes him, it does so much more slowly, the sensation less piercing and more like a dull, burning throb, but he knows John can feel it go through him, can feel him convulse around his shaft, and he's scared that he'll faint, because he just can't take anything more, and then John's arms are there, making a cage around him, protecting him, and John's lips, murmuring incomprehensible endearments into his ear.
"We need a shower," Sherlock breathes against his lips, a small grin tugging at the corners of his mouth.
The haze of deep, heady desire clouding his mind makes it difficult to get a grasp on anything, and it takes all of his energy to concentrate on simply moving his feet in a straight line. This endeavour isn’t made any easier by Sherlock very insistently holding onto him as they walk, his fingers halfway under his shirt again, his mouth busy devouring his ear. It’s a miracle that they don’t crash into furniture on their way to the bedroom, which suddenly seems very, very far away.
"Well, we can't go back and tell him it was all a hoax. That would be--- embarrassing, wouldn't it?"
in his surrender, and John knows that if he’s not careful, he’ll come from pleasuring his lover alone, untouched, like a teenager.
I gaze at him standing before me, naked and with all his walls lying crumbled at his feet, and my heart bursts with the tenderness I have finally allowed it to feel. I know, like I did on that very first day, that there is nothing in the world that could keep me from giving in to him, over and over again.
At seeing him so eager for it, a hot wave of pleasure ripples down my spine, setting me alight with desire, and my restraint falters. I groan and kiss his jaw, then the side of his neck.
I let my hands roam over every inch of his beauty I can reach and my brain immediately translates it into images I want to preserve forever.
He pushes his forearms under my upper body and grips my shoulders for leverage, and then he starts pounding into me hard and fast, grunting with the effort of it.
“Can you feel the beach beneath your palms?” I ask him huskily, and from the corners of my eyes I can see him run his hands across the sheets, lightly, his fingers playing with imaginary grains of sand.
I want to do all that, too. I want to love him every possible way, make him come with my hands, my mouth, my body. We don’t have the time. It’s not fair.
, I hope I'm not interpreting this the wrong way." He looks at me, his ocean-blue eyes desperate. "Please just
He's not sure how to act to make the whole thing as bearable as possible for his friend, who never agreed to be a part of this farce, but it turns out he needn't have worried – Sherlock seems to have decided to go all out and have some fun while playing along. Maybe it's because they have no choice. Maybe he is enjoying Wilkes' appreciation of his choice of significant other a
for my lips around it… gleaming milky white in the moonlight… Your hands buried in my hair, tightening their grip as I move up and down slowly… tasting you… hmmm…
“Fuck,” I curse and turn in his arms to press my mouth against his and taste myself on his lips. Our tongues entwine once more in a wet, lascivious kiss that leaves me breathless and lightheaded. “Take me to your bed now,” I tell him, my voice sounding strangely gravelly to my own ears. “I can’t--- wait any longer. See what you do to me…”
John strokes up and down his arm, which is draped across his middle in a careless sprawl, and enjoys the sensation of sparse body hair and smooth skin rubbing against his palm.
"I'm not going to wander off on my own; don't worry," Sherlock's voice comes floating from out of the half-light, and John stares at the ceiling and the shadows dancing across it, willing himself to not lose his head. "Your phone's in your inside pocket – how would I get at it without waking you?"
To free himself of the memories that are still haunting him, it's only logical to return to the place where it all started such a long time ago, so he goes to Baker Street and lets himself in with his old keys. Mrs Hudson told him to keep them when he moved out,
to do anything. And you’ll do nothing wrong. There can’t be anything wrong as long as I’m here with you. You’re perfect.
“Please remain calm,” the Captain says, his disembodied voice crackling through the stale cabin air, which is slowly getting colder and colder and feels weirdly damp in John’s lungs. That’s probably all the sweating and panting everybody’s doing by now.
The risk of completely killing the mood by reminding one’s lover of traumatic experiences in the middle of foreplay is not to be underestimated, but he also wants me to stop walking on eggshells around him, so I decide to face it.
"Yes," he replies and looks up into his face, locks eyes with him, and John bites down on his lip and aligns himself, sliding only his tip inside.
He really only wanted to disarm him – at first. But then it all went out of control, and suddenly John was high, too. High on the hot pain spreading through his fingers after slapping Sherlock's face, on the way his knuckles pulsed when his hands became fists and collided with those arrogant, too-beautiful-to-be-real cheekbones, on the scent of blood and fear tingeing the air. On the softness of Sherlock's midriff when John kicked and kicked and
talk. But if avoiding the issue is enough for Sherlock, it's enough for him, at least for now. It's all still so fragile between them, and he's afraid that insisting on addressing the events of the past might break the bond that they've re-established, might rip open the healing wounds all over again. So he stays quiet and lets Sherlock take the lead.
“Well, it was you who insisted on staying in a cottage by the sea. I gather you were aware of the fact that I don’t enjoy the benefits of a honey-coloured complexion.”
His hands come down to stroke my shoulders then, warm and comforting, and I realise that I need to sleep. I feel sated and content and absolutely wrecked, and I could sleep for a whole week now.
He laughs one of his rare real laughs then, and the sound makes me fall in love with him all over again.
day. One day to overwhelm John, distract him, get his mind off this insane idea, and maybe this engagement would never have happened.
Now the rain has stopped and he is back, clad in a pair of immaculate tweed trousers and a matching waistcoat buttoned up over a crisp white shirt, and the only thing giving away that he has only recently been caught up in the worst deluge London has seen in years is his hair - usually he keeps it slicked back and perfectly smoothed against his head with pomade, but now it is framing his face in tousled waves that are still damp and have thus turned an even darker shade of ebony brown. Despite the fact that he still looks weary, it is a lovely vision to see him like this, tinkering with our tea set and a tin of Mrs Hudson’s homemade ginger biscuits, and I cannot help but smile.
Sherlock looks at him, takes him in, but he doesn’t feel self-conscious about it. Sherlock has seen his scar before, but still wants to undress him, so he thinks he’s alright with him being not unblemished by his past. Nevertheless, he shudders when Sherlock reaches out and caresses the place where the bullet entered him, surprised by the tenderness of the moment.
When he stumbles down the hall and into the bedroom, lube in hand and Sherlock's mouth busy devouring his ear, a first faint roll of thunder shudders through the air. Raindrops are pattering against the half-open window, a cool gust of wind in their wake that makes the curtains billow and flap.
He sounds so calm, so at peace with everything, and I want to shout at him to be more upset, to allow himself the fury, the pain - he deserves it! He's been wronged!
…” He hums and wriggles his hips to make his pyjama trousers slide to the floor. “I like the sound of that…”
Her eyes flutter closed again immediately afterwards, and John chuckles exasperatedly and slowly makes his way down the hall.
Sherlock is so smart. How come he doesn't know that John's a monster? How come he's not trying to protect himself?
He breaks off, because right then the look in John's eyes changes, becomes un-deducible all of a sudden, and his brain stutters to an abrupt halt.
"Give me the oil," he hears John say and does so without thinking, and only when a slick, probing finger slips past his outer rim and replaces John's tongue does he snap back to reality.
Sherlock sounds indifferent. John’s lust turns into rage so quickly that he doesn’t know how to handle it.
"If you keep looking at me like this, we might not even make it to the bathroom," John answers lowly.
With a fervour that surprises both himself and Sherlock, who gasps and does some interesting kind of horizontal jump, he moves down the other man’s body, tongue-kissing every inch of skin that comes his way (his collarbones, his dusky pink nipples, the lines of his ribs, the dip of his navel, his sharp hipbones), and when he reaches Sherlock’s cock, he just takes its base into his hand and puts his mouth around the rest.
Sherlock nods slowly, maybe processing that John has just revealed that he's had sex with other men before, and then lifts a finger and traces John's lips with it.
"I’ll be there if you need someone to talk to, someone to support you - but that’s all I can do. I wish it was different. I’m sorry." His heart hammering, Sherlock takes a deep breath. There’s one more thing he needs to address. "John… I apologise for--- for hurting you. You said you were sore, and I knew it would probably make you uncomfortable, and I--- I disregarded that. I’m so, so sorry. I shouldn’t have done that."
His erection, flushed red and still moist with John’s saliva, twitches against his abdomen, and John moans in response, feeling his own cock filling again in sympathy.
She takes my hand, so gently, and puts it on your forehead. Together we push your lids down until those mesmerising irises are hidden behind thin, almost translucent curtains of skin, and when it’s done, all the light has vanished from the room.
"So you--- you thought, oh well, he'll probably try to do something funny today, better watch his every step? Or what?"
In a flash-forward vision that pops up in the back of his head, John sees himself and Sherlock and the life they'll reclaim for themselves. They'll start right here, with this lopsided kiss.
“All of you,” Sherlock repeats and then uses his left index finger to stroke it up and down the underside of John’s cock – slowly, so slowly, from base to tip and back again.

I really am. How come I’m not allowed to be with the one person who matters to me? Where is he? Why can’t Mycroft help more? Why is everything so fucked up?
. The rational part of him is aware of the fact that he shouldn't care, that this is more important than anything has ever been before. But no matter how he longs to shake them off, his fear and self-loathing are still very much there.
Sherlock blushes deeply; the translucent hue of pink crawls up his face to tinge his cheekbones, his nose, and even his ears, and John can’t help himself any longer. He pulls at the smooth curls winding around his fingers to draw Sherlock in for a kiss.
“Look at your back. You almost got yourself killed for me, Sherlock. Please just forgive me. For everything.”
"We do have candles, though," Sherlock points out, and John wonders how he manages to sound so smug while keeping his voice down like that. "And I'd bet that if you think about it, you'll find that I
"They caught me. I was trying to sneak into their headquarters, but I wasn't careful enough. Of course they were very interested in finding out who I was, and if I was part of a larger organisation. When I didn't speak, they tried to... persuade me."
It is warm, so warm, and silky slick, and I have to bite my lip very hard to stop myself from pounding into him in response. I could never risk hurting him, not even if he asked for it.
He fumbles for the condom she's put on the nightstand before they started and puts it on with shaking fingers, then gets on top of her and pushes in, thrusts hard right away. One of his hands is bracing his weight against the mattress, the other one is squeezing her breast.
My breath stutters with the effort of our lovemaking, and I am sure I do not have long. The fire of lust inside of me is burning brightly, licking all the way into my fingers and up to the base of my neck, and a familiar tingling is beginning to spread out from my midriff, ready to explode and wash over me in a flash of white light.
It happens so fast that Sherlock finds himself by his side before even realising that he's moved, and, following a spontaneous impulse, he sits down on the armrest of John's chair and lays his hand on his shoulder to put gentle pressure on it and show him that he's there.
“Look at me. I’m dead. I’ve just jumped off St Bart’s. You’ve seen me fall. I’m lying on the pavement, my skull broken. There’s blood everywhere.”
"You're not shutting me out now, Sherlock," John says lowly, his voice level, but tinged with a subtle trace of annoyance that Sherlock doesn't understand.
He slips into his mind palace without even noticing the transition from reality to the perfect world he's made for himself inside his head, and there's John, sitting in his room, looking up when he enters.
He hums around me and sucks hard, and my hips buck against his face in reflex, eager for more contact, for a faster rhythm, for more, more,
It's the one word, the one name, that has been keeping him grounded for the last two years. Attached to the one person who's ever managed to peel away the layers and layers of cold, hard arrogance, to dismantle the walls he'd built around his ego bit by incessant bit, and Sherlock had allowed him to, just like that. He'd
He pulls out of Sherlock and rolls him onto his back, and Sherlock slings his legs around his body and reaches down to help him find a good angle to enter him. It’s much easier than John thought. Sherlock’s body welcomes him into tight, wet heat, engulfing his cock in the most delicious way, and he moans and kisses him again, their hearts beating against each other through flesh and bone.
"Johnnnn!" Sherlock hears himself cry out, the pressure inside of him almost too much, too bright. "Ah!"
They're in John's bed, naked, rolling around and snogging and touching each other all over, and John's memory of how they got here is sort of hazy, but he doesn't mind too much.
a husband, and John knows he would die for Rosie if he needed to. He hopes that his mirroring that will make it easier for the younger man to understand his reasons.
Your lips, your perfect Cupid’s bow, your plump bottom lip – so teasing and pliant when we kiss, so vicious when you form the words that are sometimes too slow to keep up with your thoughts. So warm and dazzling when you smile at me. Your mouth is the vessel that holds the treasure of your voice, and when we make love and you pour a dark, barely-there moan into my throat, all my joints go weak. Every time. I want you to read to me tonight, to fall asleep with you, you,
He could go over to Billy's, just one last time. Just to get him through it, through this difficult phase in their lives – just to help him to not lose it completely. Just until Rosie feels better and settles down, until John is no longer so tired and so easily irritable. Until he's learned how to deal with it all. He knows he shouldn't, but his yearning is so strong. It's overruling his head. He won't use needles; that would be too much. No, he'll get himself a few pills, a small emergency stack – doesn't mean he'll take them. It will be good to know they're there. Just in case.
He forces himself to open his eyes. It's an alien sight that greets him through a veil of his own tears. Sherlock's cheeks are flushed and wet and there are large, sparkling teardrops clinging to his long, dark lashes. He's staring at John with so much pity in his gaze that it's almost unbearable.
Of course he couldn't be sure that exactly that hadn't already happened, but something Mrs Hudson said to him over tea and biscuits one rainy afternoon gave him the strength to hold on. "Give him some time," she said. "He'll be back. He's in a bad place right now, but he'll knock on your door one of these days. If you still want him around, he'll come back to you." Sherlock soaked up her words and the relief they offered him, but decided to ignore the last part – why should he ever
I'd be lying if I said I'd never thought about this. I have. I thought about it that first night at Angelo's, and I've thought about it time and time again ever since.
John doesn’t know what to reply to that; he’s so overwhelmed, so he just steps back into the other man's personal space and pulls his head towards himself for another kiss.
"What does that have to do with it?" he asks, the embers of his frustration flaring up inside him again. "And I've shagged my share of blokes, just for the record. Don't assume you know everything about me."
. Of course there is a lot that lies in between those two sentiments, and I give him all of that as well. Soon he is clinging onto me with closed eyes, lost in sensation, and I finish unbuttoning his shirt and pull it out of his trousers to run my hands up and down his naked back.
She makes him sit down at the kitchen table with her and puts her hand on his arm and asks him what's wrong, and he's so exhausted that he starts to cry.
"If Rosie lets me, I'll work on the blog. But I don't suppose I'll get much done," he grumbles through his fingers and sighs. Then he looks up again. "I'll be thinking of you."
I can’t think of anything else to say, to ask. I’ve dreamt about talking to him for so long, but now my brain is empty. We only have a few minutes – how am I supposed to make the best of that if I don’t know what to tell him?
"I'll take care of you, darling… God, you're so sweet like this…" he murmurs and gives him another stroke, eliciting another soft groan that causes warmth to spread in his insides.
Silence. Then he huffs, almost violently, and starts to vibrate in my arms. For the fraction of a second I am hurt, humiliated even, because it sounds like he is suppressing a laugh, but then I realise that it is quite the opposite. He is holding back a reaction that might be too painful for him to reveal just now, and I chide myself for not noticing right away. He does not answer, so I pull him against me and kiss his hair, over and over again.
“We decided upon the Edinburgh case,” Sherlock insists. They stand in front of the mirror, John helping Sherlock tie his tie as they debate which case to discuss.
Sherlock raises his head and smiles weakly. Everything feels slow and stiff, even the corners of his mouth. It's still early in the morning, but all he wants is John cuddled up against his back and some sleep.
"I love you," John repeats hoarsely, and, after trembling through the aftershocks, eventually slows down and then stops moving. "Sherlock… I love you so much. You're---
His choice of words could mean anything, John thinks. He could just be avoiding the “vernacular”. He could be---
"I missed you," he murmurs, placing a kiss onto Sherlock's sternum, lingering there before moving to his left nipple to lave it with his tongue. "I know I have no right saying that, but it's the truth." He kisses the place where Mary's bullet entered him, ever so gently, giving Sherlock goosebumps all over. "I missed you like crazy."
He gazes at me over his shoulder, and the look in his eyes changes from urgent want to tender concern.
Sherlock looks at him and wonders if he sounds like that just due to the adrenaline that comes with a perfectly ordinary almost-spill of boiling hot tea, or if there is another reason too, maybe a more momentous one. He himself is grappling for a hold on his emotions, which have burst to the surface after feeling John’s touch, brief as the sensation may have been, and he can’t see how he’s supposed to survive this, whatever happens next.
We kiss again, slowly and deeply this time, and he runs his hands up and down my back, giving me goose bumps. Then he goes slightly tense and pulls back to look at me.
With an impish, challenging glint in his eyes, he looks at me, and I take the bait, curious to see where this might lead.
"About what?" John asks, giving his voice a soothing timbre. "You can tell me, Sherlock." And then, when his friend still doesn’t answer: "There’s nothing you can’t tell me. Nothing at all. Please."
He holds me through it all, chasing after his own completion with wild, forceful thrusts, and it doesn't take him very long. The sounds he makes are the most arousing thing I've ever heard. His movements become more and more erratic, then falter altogether, and after a second of absolute stillness he pistons his hips forwards once, twice, and then he's there as well.
The minutes pass us by soundlessly. I stare into the semi-darkness, his scent and mine mingling all around us, like a disembodied, amorphous negative of the emotions that were felt inside this room tonight – passion, ecstasy, happiness. Fear. Hope.
He slides his palms down John’s back, and digs his fingers into his jumper in a possessive gesture. John groans, liquid heat pooling in his abdomen and licking up his spine, his pulse accelerating. Suddenly the air around them feels too warm to John, too stuffy, and they’re definitely wearing
He's rambling, still floating high himself, it seems, and John keeps his eyes closed and just feels him, smells him, listens to his mumbled words of praise.
"Then I'll stop now… while I still can," he tells John, his voice thick with suppressed want, and draws out of the other man's embrace to get up from the floor. "I'll visit Lestrade to distract myself until it's… time. What about you?"
tight, incredibly so, and he's glad they're using a condom now, because he knows that if he'd felt this skin on skin, he wouldn't have lasted five minutes.
He doesn't feel drunk anymore, which is probably down to the amount of adrenaline and endorphins coursing through his system right now. He's tired, exhausted even, but his head is clear.
," he states nonchalantly and sends Sherlock a brief crooked smile that he knows he won't be able to translate – but Wilkes will.
Remembering the smug arrogance with which Sherlock chose to reveal himself, John's fury flares up inside his guts all over again. At the same time, he wants to go over to Baker Street and see if he's really there, if he's really back. He wants to grab him and shake him and
Sherlock brushes his bad shoulder with his fingertips, then breaks their connection to straighten up again.
matter what – and who – they are. What they are made them do the things they did and didn't do, and it brought them here, to where they are now. Sherlock is brilliant, a mastermind, but he's also an addict with self-destructive tendencies. John is a soldier and a healer, but he's also an abuser. What they are will influence each and every step they take from here, and John knows that it probably won't be easy to get back to how it was before.
“Put your hand in my hair,” I tell him, and, his gaze fixed on mine, he raises his right hand and weaves his fingers through my hair, tugging softly.
That's true, and reasonable, he tells himself. John was abused. Why shouldn't he turn into an abuser himself as a result of that?
Sherlock tightens his grip around John’s waist, clinging to him as though he may somehow fly away, and Sherlock is the only thing tethering him to earth. “Love you, John. So, so much,” he whispers coarsely between kisses.
When he’s gone, I slide the DVD from the box into my laptop’s CD drive and click play. I’m not prepared for the onslaught of emotions when his face, his lanky body, his nervous gestures appear on the screen. I take a deep breath and lean back in my chair.
again, which stresses Sherlock out. He doesn’t even know why he always instigates it – it’s not like you can simply stop being asexual just because you’ve found the love of your life. He loves John – more than anything. But he doesn’t want to have sex. He
with him! I had looked for you everywhere before I came knocking. It’s the only place you could have been!”
At hearing him say his name, his tone so very obviously tinged with love and longing, John's heart takes a leap.
," John spits, his nose only inches from Sherlock's, so close that Sherlock can't make out his face anymore. "This is the last time. I'm
John caresses his thigh and keeps his finger right where it is, waiting for Sherlock’s body to get accustomed to it. The longer he waits, the more he feels the muscles gripping him give way.
“May I?” he asks, breathing hard and obviously crazy with desire and yet every ounce the gentleman, and I give him a barely-there nod and close my eyes.
He couldn't bear it if it ever happened again. He'd have to kill himself if it did. It would be better for everyb---
Sherlock puts his hands onto John’s shoulders to push himself up into a kneeling position, and then he takes John’s wrist in a gentle grip. “Like that,” he murmurs. “John.” He guides John’s hand between his legs, down past his scrotum and right between his buttocks, and then he lets go, staring down at him with wide, expectant eyes.
Sherlock inclines his head in acknowledgement and then looks at his brother, who gets up without a word and picks up his coat and umbrella from the other chair.
“That can be arranged,” he rumbles, and when our eyes meet for the briefest of moments, I can see it confirmed that he is indeed taking up my offer and letting go, at least for tonight.
, but that is not the reason why all of this is happening now. He doesn’t know if Sherlock is aware of that, too.
I reach up with my other arm and cup his face in my hand, let my thumb run along his cheekbone, then his beard. I'm allowed to touch, at last. I'll make use of every second of this.
– it’s not superficial, and afterwards I feel better. But this condensed form of communication doesn’t quench my longing for ordinary, everyday interaction. We don’t eat together, and we don’t fall asleep listening to each other’s breathing. He’s not really a part of my life right now, even though I feel him in every fibre of my being, all the time. He’s like a constant ache sitting behind my ribs, somewhere in the vicinity of my heart.
Sherlock has closed his eyes again. His voice sounds resigned and impassive, but John isn't offended. He knows that Sherlock is aware of the sad fact that John is only doing what's right – he's not going to shoot the messenger.
with Rosie, which she wins. John can practically hear her gloat over it all the way from the kitchen, as well as her eye roll at Sherlock’s clearly irked response:
"Yes," I say. "Well, at least I didn't think you were very experienced. I never saw you with anybody, so I just assumed you were not interested in sex. Or… relationships."
Sherlock looks like he's trying not to bite the armrest of his chair. John realises that he loves being responsible for him looking like that, even though the context could be less awkward.
Sherlock feels his wound begin to pulse and remembers that he should clean it, and sooner rather than later.
I’m shouting now, my face only inches from his, and I hope Mrs Hudson is out – I don’t want her to hear this. I’m embarrassed by the way I’m handling the situation, but I can’t help it. He has to tell me. He has to see that I need to know.
