Most of all, John didn’t know how to take care of another person - he could barely take care of himself on a good day - and God knew Sherlock required a lot of care.
”Yeah, probably a good idea.” he replied. “But when we come back we better start playing for real. We still haven’t made much use of the rules we estabilished.”
John blinked twice, astonished by the scene taking place in front of him.
“Oh, that is just—“ He paused before he could say something he didn’t mean. He was here to apologize, not to get into another fight. “Okay. Let’s start again. I’ve been an arsehole.”
What kind of question was that, ‘is everything okay?’ Of course it wasn’t okay. They’d been sharing a pleasant night together and suddenly Sherlock had decided to make everything weird for them. And for what? He thought back to what Sherlock had told him a few hours before. ‘
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, intrigued.
“Spoken like a true Capricorn.”
John chuckled. He tried to picture the Holmes brothers as grumpy teenagers, forced to take cooking lessons from their progressive mother. It was hilarious.
Meanwhile John took the coffee pot out of its rightful place in the cupboard and started making some coffee.
”Here, let me do it. You sit back on your chair and look up the next question.”
John handed him the phone and took a sip of wine.
He poured two shots of gin in their now empty mugs and handed one to the other. Sherlock Holmes was going to do a shot with him, wether he liked it or not.
“Mmh. Nothing.”
John blinked, startled. “What now?”
John felt like they were playing their own, silent poker game, each searching the other’s eyes for a clue of what was to come.
“Guess… mhh…” Sherlock paused to ponder what was clearly a very important decision. “Okay, I got it. Guess what animal I’m thinking of.”
“Oh, come on! It’s not like either of us has a normal job. Besides, there are no cases anyways, we might as well take advantage of it.”
Silence.
“Nothing. You’re a downright git, has anyone ever told you that?”
Sherlock was wearing an odd expression. “That’s— wow.” he said.
”Me?”
lonely.”
“I mean, girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever.” John tried to correct himself. “Nevermind that, it was a joke. So what do you say?”
John’s smile immediately faded away. They were back with the depressing questions.
“Alright then.”
“I just think it’s a little hypocritical of you to lecture me about love when all your relationships are clearly nothing more than an exchange of goods.”
He wasn’t sure why, but he felt the warm blood rush to his cheeks at the thought of looking into his roommate’s piercing blue eyes for more than a few seconds.
An odd expression crossed Sherlock’s face - a mix of defiance and something else entirely. There was a hint of a smirk lurking at the side of his mouth.
”Definitely.”
Sherlock seemed to ponder his answer for a moment.
There hadn't been a new case in almost two weeks and he'd started to let himself go: he was beginning to look thinner and paler than usual (which was saying something.) Ever since the draught had started he’d stopped eating almost entirely and didn't even bother to get out of the house, much to John’s chagrin.
He sat on his chair, chopsticks in one hand and book in the other,
“What?”
John opened his mouth, then closed it, at a loss for words.
“Well, yes, but-“
“Fine. Your way. Always your way.”
”Oh, right. The questions.” He flopped onto the chair. “Lay it on me.”
“Have you ever heard of the 36 questions?”
Sherlock didn’t answer. Instead he joined his hands like he often did during one of his cases and smirked.
He kept quiet for a while, weighing pros and cons of going out of his room for some leftover takeaway.
“What does that mean?”
John sat up straighter. “What, the drinking or the questions?” he asked.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but didn’t object to it.
“Well, you should thank her, because this is delicious.”
“Nothing.” murmured John.
“Yeah, right, how could I forget. The greatest private detective in the whole world.” John muttered mockingly.
”You know, I can tell when you’re not listening to me. Need I remind you that I’m doing this for you? I can just get back to my book if that’s what you want—“
“I think, Sherlock, that you’re underestimating the amount of love you have in your life.”
A grin split John’s face. “Yeah, we probably are, aren’t we?”
“I think you should say it anyways.”
Sherlock laughed, a brief and hoarse chuckle that echoed through the small room.
“About what?”
Sherlock was an arsehole, but he wasn’t entirely wrong. There had been a lot of women, it was true, but never one he’d properly fallen in love with. It was just never the right time; in highschool he was too focused on studying to get away from that dump of a town, and he’d spent most of his twenties in the army.
Just like that. John strongly considered the idea of strangling him for a few seconds, but then settled on a more subtle glare.
“No.” Sherlock repeated more loudly. “I might be drunk, but I meant what I said. And I think you meant it too when you said you didn’t feel the same way. So no, we’re not going to just forget about it, but I’m not going to make more of a fool of myself either.”
“Uhm, so what do you say?” he tried again. “I’m not asking a third time.”
Sherlock had a disgusted grimace painted on his face. “Ugh, gin.” he lamented. “I’d forgotten how disgusting it is on its own.” He put down his mug on the coffee table and stared at it for a few seconds before continuing. “So, what now?” he pondered.
He opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock interrupted him.
“You care about people.”
Sherlock didn’t wait for an answer.
“Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.” he said, as if that settled it. “What’s yours? Worst memory, I mean.”
“Is it… a cat?” he asked, tentatively.
“Elton John? Really?”
He didn’t know why, but the mere thought that Sherlock could love him was enough to send a panicking sensation through his body, a pit in his stomach.  And he knew that it had little to do with Sherlock, and everything to do with him; Sherlock’s love was a beautiful thing. Too beautiful for him, he felt.
“To having completed the first set of the questions. Twelve done, twenty-four more to go. Cheers!”
“I’m not trying to do anything.” Sherlock said. Something in his voice made John want to believe him.
“Oh, and you’re an expert on what is me and what isn’t, are you?”
He cleared his throat.
“You know what I mean.” John sighed. “You got it right down to the last detail... I just didn’t know I was
Sherlock’s eyes suddenly widened, as if a thought had just occurred to him. “We should get a cat.”
Just thinking about it filled him with a number of emotions he didn’t have a name for. Anger, mostly. Both at Sherlock, for manipulating him, and at himself for having fallen for it.
Now the cabbie was looking clearly amused. John would have wanted to scream at him. ‘
John’s lips curled into a smile as he entered his room and grabbed his black wool coat, which was resting on the back of his chair.
John heard himself yelp in surprise. He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but not
John sighed. For a genius, he could be really fucking daft.
”What is it?”
“Yeah, well, no need to be so literal, Sherlock.” he replied between one bite and the other.
“Why? Why does everything have to be so damn complicated?!”
Sherlock produced a sound that really sounded like a ‘
Then he answered: “No.”
“And you’ve been an arsehole too.”
John swallowed hard. He wasn’t sure what to expect from Sherlock - as always, his expression was impossible to read. Would he be angry? Find it weird? Ignore it altogether?
But he still wasn’t sure wether it was a good idea. He’d been lonely for so long that he hadn’t even considered that there might be another way. Well, almost lonely. He supposed he’d had Sherlock for the past four years. Still, it was very different for them to be friends than for them to be… whatever they wanted to call it. Boyfriends? Partners? John dreaded putting a label onto it, because that would mean that it was real.
John could see from expression that he was trying to come up with an answer on the spot.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow and glanced at him, waiting for him to go on.
Millions of questions were whirling through his head. And then Sherlock smiled, and John’s heart felt a thousand pounds lighter.
“For the record my last time was humming Don’t Go Breaking My Heart yesterday while I was cooking.”
“That was when I met you.” A striking man in an obituary. He smiled at the memory. “I think you know the rest.” he concluded.
“Good. I don’t want you to be mad at me.”
He sounded genuinely worried, and John knew him well enough to recognize the silent question underneath. ‘Are we okay?’
“Uhm, we could take a break.” John jumped to his feet. “You hungry?”
John blinked. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but not that.
John looked first at his plate, than at Sherlock, incredulous. “How could you know how I like them? I’m one hundred percent positive that I’ve never told you.”
Sherlock’s head perked up, as if he’d expecting him to say just that. John felt as if he’d been lured into a trap.
“Fine.”
“Excuse me?”
Despite his best intentions to stay mad at him, John felt his lips curl as soon as he looked across the room to his flatmate, eyes twinkling with amusement.
“It suits you.” joked Sherlock.
”Let me guess, you’re going to drink.”
He looked at Sherlock, and it was as if he was seeing him for the very first time, not as a calculating machine, not as the man he’d become, but as the child he’d once been, a frightened and lonely child whose only crime had been to be different.
“Yeah, well, keep your comments to yourself, thank you very much.”
Sherlock kept his eyes on him, staring at him with an animal-like intensity.
“You’re beautiful.” The words slipped out of John’s mouth before he could stop them, and when he realized it it was too late. They were already out there, hovering between them, and there was nothing he could do to take them back.
Sherlock frowned. “You think?”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed.
John turned around, irritated. He’d better have something good to counter.
“What? No.” replied Sherlock unconvincingly.
“How come we’ve never done this before?”
’re famous. I’m just Sherlock Holmes’ companion. ‘Bachelor John Watson’, that’s how they call me.”
John shrugged and gave him the patient look one would give a stubborn child, as if to say ‘it’s your game’.
”Why not? It’s fun!”
“No.”
The blond’s eyes widened in disbelief.
There was a heavy sigh from the other side of the door.
“John?”
“By convincing you to get drunk.” he pointed out.
Sherlock stared at him, his expression a mix of confusion, shock and pity. John wanted to cry. He could read the silent question in his eyes, ‘is that what you think of yourself?’.
The blond didn’t answer, he simply kept staring at him expectantly.
"Bored."
”Well, yeah, what else did you expect?” Sherlock was eyeing him curiously.
“Nevermind. It doesn’t matter.”
“How does my dating life impact you, exactly?” he bellowed.
Most of the things he knew about his father came from other people - he loved rugby, he liked dogs, he drank scotch. But that memory, real or fake, existed only in his head, and as long as he kept it to himself it was something that belonged only to him.
Eventually Sherlock broke the silence.
“Obviously.”
John sighed as he sat back on his chair.
John would have liked to remind him that he was mostly the one to thank for his suddenly pleasant evening, but he didn’t say any of that. Instead, he clinked his glass with the other’s. “Cheers!”
“If we have… I’m sorry,
“Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?” he read.
“For the record,” Sherlock said, voice reduced to a whisper. “I think you’re beautiful too.”
John thought about denying it, but there was no point. Sherlock would have known if he was lying.
“A good steak, a couple of pints at the local pub and then back home reading in front of the fireplace. Kind of like today, minus the crazy flatmate.”
”Why?”
John cleared his throat in an attempt to draw his attention.
he thought.
”You’re already famous.”
Sherlock winced and looked at John as if he had just admitted to beating up the elderly.
mine wouldn’t bother you so much!”
“Okay, let’s see... we’re both adult men. We were both born in the UK-“
predictable, that’s all.”
Well, he thought, it was a good thing that Sherlock was at least aware of the fact that he’d been a huge arse - even though his awareness couldn’t actually change anything. And if he was kicking himself for it, all the better.
“You enjoy watching me solve them.” Sherlock corrected him.
An odd expression crossed Sherlock’s face for a moment.
But by now he’d learned that there was no point in getting angry for every little irritating thing Sherlock did. And he supposed it wasn’t really Sherlock’s fault as much as the copious amounts of alcohol John had ingested in the last couple of hours’. Gin tended to make him belligerent.
“Well, all of you.” he specified hurriedly. “You, Molly, Greg, Mike. My friends. I would be nowhere without you.”
“My mother made a point to teach both me and Mycroft when we were teenagers. Said we would never find a girlfriend if we weren’t able to take care of ourselves.” He paused and smirked. “Well, she got one thing right.”
Instead, he went to the bathroom and had a shower.
“I thought you didn’t care about that stuff.” John said softly. “When people call you a weirdo, or a psychopath you never seem to mind.”
“Good.” he said, disappearing into the kitchen once again. When he re-emerged, he had two fuming mugs in his hands. He handed one to Sherlock.
“You sound surprised.”
“Okay, whatever.”
“Don’t play innocent, Holmes, I know you’d go to any length just to prove a point.”
No, he supposed he didn’t.
John moistened his lips. That was a good question, what
“That’s not a real answer and you know it.” he said in a tone similar to the one a mother would use to scold her disobedient child.
“You know what? Forget it. It was stupid of me to think that you could take this seriously.”
he spat the word as if it were poison - “all the women you sleep with?”
It sounded a little off, when he said it. Like he was reading it from a textbook. He hoped that the detective wouldn’t notice it.
“Just a hunch.” he answered.
The blond paused, taken aback. The way things were going, either there would be an insteresting murder within the next few days or John would have been the one to commit it.
“Just because you talents lie elsewhere, it doesn’t mean—“
He took his half-empty G&T and finished it in one gulp. He felt a bit naked, having Sherlock’s eyes on him, analyzing him, scanning his thoughts. He wished he would stop.
“Of course.” he replied, “What else would I be talking about?”
“I don’t remember it, really, I was five or six. A car accident, while he was getting back home from work. After that, it all came crashing down.”
“I’m starving.”
“Uhm, yeah?”
If there was one thing John Watson had learned in his thirty-two years on this earth, it was that the expectation is usually better than that reality.
The more time passed, the less John’s decision to reject the detective made any sense to him. If he had to be with someone, he wanted it to be Sherlock. He really, really did.
He went to pour himself some more wine and was disappointed to find that the bottle was almost empty. “It’s your turn, by the way.”
Sherlock looked at him like he was the most obtuse creature on the planet.
“You could always drink.” offered Sherlock helpfully. “We were talking about starting to play properly.”
That was a half-lie. It hadn’t worked out great so far, it had worked out terribly. So much hidden, so much unsaid. John had already lost him once and he still didn’t have the courage to admit to him how much he truly cared about him. He just figured he must know, because it was easier than being straight with him and say ‘Hey, I think I might be in love with you.’
There was also a note, written in a messy, barely-legible handwriting that John recognized as belonging to Sherlock.
He still couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that Sherlock had both apologized to him and done something thoughtful on the same day. Maybe he hadn’t been giving him enough credit, he thought.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow.
Sherlock nodded, looking very much like one who’s just found himself plummeted in his worst nightmare.
John couldn’t think of an answer, so he simply stood under the kitchen doorframe and watched as his sociopathic flatmate frantically tinkered with the limes in an effort to prepare two gin and tonics. Once he was done, a few minutes later, the detective topped them with two straws and gracefully placed them on the coffee table. Then he turned towards John with a proud look on his face.
Sherlock checked his watch. “About four minutes forty-five seconds.”
“Would you have told me, if I’d asked?”
“Very well.” John cleared his throat. “Question thirty-six.
“I’m not mad at you.”
“Like… no joking about death, for example. Or sickness.”
“You keep saying that, but you don’t mean it, not really.” he muttered.
"Oh, don't pretend that I've interrupted you. You stopped reading that stupid book about fortyfive minutes ago." the man spat bitterly.
“Of course, it makes sense!”
“I guess getting my degree?” he said, tentatively.
John thought he probably could have used a manual of his own.
He cleared his throat.
“Well, seems like I still manage to surprise you even after all these years.” said Sherlock hurriedly. “How about-“
Sherlock looked at him as if he didn’t understand the connection between the two concepts.
“Uhm, cheers, mate.” he muttered, sitting up straighter on his chair.
John stood up, trying to fight the wave of dizziness that immediately washed over him, picked up his glass and made his way to the kitchen.
”You okay?”
Eventually, he did. Sherlock lowered his gaze and redirected it towards his own glass.
They both kept quiet for a while, enjoying the burning sensation of the alcohol spreading in their chests.
“I don’t have
”A stroll around the centre of London. No cases, no murders, no hurry, just walking around the city.”
“Do we have anything stronger than wine?” he asked, gesturing to the empty bottle sitting on the coffee table along with the two mugs.
”They’re fine creatures, cats. Very useful.” Sherlock continued.
“Why?”
John thought about it for a while.
”What do you want me to say, John?”
John emptied his glass and glanced at his phone, hoping that the next question would be something lighter.
He said: “You never told me that.”
“Don’t you like it?”
”Err, no.”
“It’s not just you.” Sherlock said, hands twisting nervously around his glass. “But I’m glad we’re doing it now.”
“Okay, but that’s different-“ John said, trying to defend himself.
Sherlock blinked. He looked like he’d completely forgotten about the questions.
“Cheers.” repeated Sherlock.
He thought of how proud his british-raised mother would have been of him in that moment. She seemed to think that tea was the solution to pretty much any problem. He went to the kitchen and poured the boiling water in two identical mugs.
“That’s because the rules are wrong! I’s physically impossible for Mrs. White to be both in the study and in the hall.”
John squinted at him, very focused. Only a few hours before looking in Sherlock’s eyes for more than a handful of seconds would have felt like an insurmountable task, but by now the alcohol had taken over, and he felt bolder.
John chuckled. “I had no idea you were a fan of the Sex Pistols.”
thought John, ‘
”What does that have to do with anything?”
Sherlock looked surprised by the question and almost… relieved? No, that couldn’t be it.
“What’s the point in asking? You were there.”
“Now if you’re done accusing me of drugging you-“
”Question thirty-five. Tell your partner what you like about them. Be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you’ve just met.”
It wasn’t necessarily true, but it didn’t matter. Any words, however empty, were better than that awkward silence.
He froze, horrorstruck. The minute those words left his mouth he thought he would do anything to take them back. But it was too late. He’d crossed the line.
Sherlock glowered at him before continuing. “-I propose we go back to the questions.”
“Where did you learn how to cook anyways?”
“I’m not sure wether I should tell you.”
Sherlock returned his smile and gestured to the kitchen table. It had been cleaned up, and now two plates rested upon it.
Neither of then spoke for a long time. John’s mind was filled with a thousand thoughts. How shitty this all was. How Sherlock didn’t deserve it. Well, no one deserved it, but especially not Sherlock. How he would have wanted to punch God, if one even existed, for everything He’d done to him. But he didn’t say any of that.
”Too much?”
”Do you ever rehearse what you’re going to say before making a phonecall?”
“Nothing.” Sherlock confirmed with a brief nod. “I assume you have restrictions.”
It was the right thing to say, but it felt ingenuine, as though it was something he’d read about in a manual called “What to do after being rejected by your best friend”.
“I’m not hiding anything.” John replied, and even while he said it he could tell that it sounded fake.
“Stop giving me hope, if you’re not going to be with me!” Sherlock snapped. “It hurts too much, and I won’t be a part of it anymore.”
“Do you?” asked finally Sherlock, who’d had more than enough of it. For someone who spent most of his time ignoring other people he found awkward silences surprisingly difficult to bear, especially those between him and John.
John didn’t say anything, though he was thinking ‘
Sherlock gave him his most sincere you’re-not-going-to-hear-any-argument-from-me look.
“We both love London. We both enjoy helping people—”
“Oh, right.” Sherlock cleared his throat.  “Would you like to be famous? In what way? Well, that’s an easy one.”
Sherlock stared at him for a couple of seconds, looking like a deer caught in the headlights, then he sighed.
”Have you even ever been in love?” Sherlock pressed on mercilessly.
“You know, it’s not really fair. If I’d known you were going to come up with the rules as a way to avoid answering I wouldn’t have agreed to them.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him. “A juicer, John. A squeezer, however you want to call it.”
”Sorry about that.”
Sherlock sat up straighter and glanced at John’s phone. “Oh, this should be an interesting one.”
Fair enough.
Although, to think of it, that kiss had been pretty damn close to perfect… if it hadn’t been, of course, for the way it had ended and for the existential crisis that had followed it. Apart from that, it had been an experience he really, really wanted to repeat. God, what did that say about him?
It felt weirdly ordinary, like everything had changed, but at the same time nothing had. After all, they were still them, the detective with the funny hat and his companion. Nothing could change that.
For a while they kept quiet, drinking and enjoying their food. John hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he took his first bite of the sweet and sour chicken, and after that he was too busy seeing the face of God to speak. After a few minutes, Sherlock wiped his mouth with a paper napkin and cleared his throat.
He wasn’t sure wether Sherlock knew about it. He liked to think that he didn’t, but consciously he knew that he probably did. It was impossible to conceal anything from Sherlock. Well, nearly anything.
”Does that surprise you?”
The detective was sitting next to him, slightly pouting and looking very focused - on what exactly, John couldn’t quite figure out. But then again, he supposed Sherlock would always be a bit of a mistery to him.
Then he thought about his own answer. Not the one he’d given him, the one that had remained unspoken, though both of them knew it.
Sherlock snorted.
“Fine, let me just look them up— Okay, question one: given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you want as a dinner guest and why?“
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m okay.”
”Maybe. Do it anyways.”
“No you don’t.” replied Sherlock from his chair, a small smile in the corner of his mouth.
Maybe love didn’t exist, or maybe he’d just been self-sabotaging, putting his best friend above everyone in his life, including himself.
Sherlock didn’t give in the the provocation.
“That someone would be an idiot. I can recognize their thoughts and feelings using the science of deduction, but that doesn’t mean I understand them... and that’s why I need you.”
”Yeah, maybe don’t try that part on a child.”
thought John bitterly.
He cleared his throat and glanced at John’s phone. “For what in your life do you feel most grateful?” he read.
“Bit childish, don’t you think?” he observed.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to laugh.
“Uhm, try and guess.”
“It’s complicated.” John simply said.
“Just look at the prime example!” He gestured at himself. “You took a man throwing a temper tantrum and transformed it into a pleasant night for the both of us.”
John frowned, taken aback. He considered lying and telling him no, but then decided against it.
It was a quiet friday evening at 221b Baker Street. The November rain was ticking gently on the windows and the fragrant scent of crackling wood coming from the fireplace invaded the apartament - John had finally managed to convince Sherlock to light it up, despite numerous protests.
To be perfectly honest, John knew his answer. Of course he did. He just didn’t think Sherlock was going to like it.
”Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.”
John thought that it probably mattered a lot.
“Of course.” repeated John amused.
Pros: he was hungry. Like,
And if Sherlock had made a move on him then, well, he wasn’t sure what the would have done.
‘Sod off’ was one of them - possibly the most polite - accompanied by ‘No shit, genius.’ and ‘Great deduction’.
”How can you have forgotten it? We eat takeaway at least once a week. We’re their best customers.” objected Sherlock, logical as always.
John repressed his laughter. “I know you were.”
Although to be fair, he thought, most of the things Sherlock did would be an immediate red flag for any normal person. Luckily for him, John Watson wasn’t exactly what could be defined as a ‘normal person’.
John took a little sip from his glass. “It’s… good.”
He resisted the urge to lower his gaze, feeling his cheeks burning up. The air between them was crackling with anticipation, and they were so close John could taste the fragrance of Sherlock’s cologne on the tip of his tongue. They simply kept staring at each other, for God-knows-how-long.
Sherlock closed his eyes and rested his head on the back of the chair. This gave John a chance to observe him more closely, something he'd found himself doing way more often than he cared to admit.
”Yes, I suppose that’s true.” he said in a neutral voice.
Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice.
John suddenly felt a white hot rage boiling inside of him, just below the surface.
“Uhm, how about we keep asking the questions like we have up until now and either we answer or we drink?”
”Right.”
John supposed that ignoring him was a step better than straight up avoiding him.
“Fine. Sometimes.”
He started with his childhood: a normal, uninteresting childhood, spent largely in front of the TV or playing football with the lads. Then he got to his father’s death.
Silence fell in the small room, interrupted only by the light sound of the rain.
“Yes, they should be in the fridge.” he answered.
Outside his window, the light rain had turned into a full-on storm, which John thought was appropriate. It matched his mood.
He quickly jumped to his feet, as if something had bitten him.
”Mh?”
John’s brow furrowed. “I thought you didn’t like Agatha Christie.”
Hurt flashed across John’s face. He could taste it on his tongue, bitter and sour. If there had ever been a chance that this kiss could mean something, it had disappeared completely, and a small part of John couldn’t help but feel relieved. It was easier this way.
“That’s a given.”
John let out a long sigh. He was sitting on his bed, looking at his feet, unsure of what to do. He couldn’t go back out, that was for sure. Sherlock was waiting for him on the other side of the door, trying to… to what? Apologize? Explain? That wasn’t his style.
Granted, Sherlock had had his own reasons for doing so. He was a sociopath, after all, not heartless. He’d explained them to him in detail after his return, and on a rational level John knew that that should have made it better. Then why did he still feel so angry at him?
John laughed a bitter laugh.
John clinked his own, half-empty mug with the other’s.
“Because we still have a question left, and I think we should answer it. You know, for the sake of completeness.”
If Sherlock had heard him, he seemed to decide to let it go.
“Oi, I didn’t think I’d have someone looking through my stuff!” John protested, wagging an accusatory finger. “You know,  for anyone else this would be enough to move out.”
”I don’t. But it would make an amazing name for a cat, wouldn't it?"
“No, not like that.” Sherlock leaned forward until there were only a handful of centimeters between their faces.
Above it all, a question floated: what now? The dawn had risen upon the first day of the rest of their lives, as if someone had taken an axe and split their lives into two distinct ‘before’ and ‘after’. Were they just to keep living, together as a couple? That thought excited him and terrified at the same time.
”You do? I could have sworn you would have answered no.”
“Okay. You’re smart. Like, a proper genius.”
“Does it have to be a real person?”
“Yeah?”
“Why?”
”Well, if you have another brilliant idea besides playing Clue, I’m all ears.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.
John had
“Oh, then I guess I’ll drink.” John brought the straw to his lips and sipped his drink. “That leaves you.”
John nodded excitedly. “Yeah! How did you figure it out?”
John looked up to his roommate, surprised. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d genuinely apologized to him. For anyone else, it would have been the bare minimum, of course, but for Sherlock it was a huge improvement.
A couple of minutes later John came back from the kitchen, holding a bright yellow ceramic mug - a gift from Harry - filled with wine. He found that Sherlock had discarded the comforter, which was now laying at his feet, and had resorted to expressing his discontent by tapping his foot so quickly and with such intensity that John had worried it might fall off.
“I can’t believe you would be so superficial, John. I know your brain may not seem like much compared to mine, but still—“
”Good.” Sherlock fell heavily onto his armchair. “Me neither.”
”Can we at least finish the questions?” he asked. There was a bizarre expression on his face, one John wasn’t used to seeing on him often. Not quite hope, but something similar.
A shadow of a smile brightened Sherlock’s face, for just a second, before disappearing.
John snorted. “You could choose any human being in the universe and you landed on Agatha Christie?”
“Don’t tell me. I don’t wanna know what you were planning to do with it. Or where you got it. Let’s just find you something to do so I can get back to my book, okay?”
"What do you want?"
“You never asked me.”
John decided that there was no point in even asking how on earth he knew that.
“Wait.”
“I don’t know.” he muttered, eyes fixed on the carpet.
“Why would
When Sherlock came back home, John was sitting in his chair, waiting for him.
No, scratch that. Those were just excuses. There was another reason why every relationship he’d attempted in the last few years had failed, one John hadn’t yet dared to put into words.
But he was already gone.
The detective didn’t blink, he just kept staring at him unaffectedly, wearing an enigmatic expression.
It read: ‘
”You know, I don’t think that’s entirely true.” he said.
He thought he’d deserved it, really. He’d let his anger get to the better of him, and now he’d hurt the only person he truly cared about. Stupid, stupid John. Screwing up the closest thing to a healthy relationship he’d ever had.
“I was having a bad day and now I’m not anymore.” he explained. “To that.”
When he returned to the living room, he found that Sherlock seemed to have recomposed himself. He was sitting on his chair, staring broodingly into the fireplace.
”Hey, don’t you try and change the subject! You still have to answer the rest of the question.”
”No, we’re not playing Clue.” John interrupted him curtly.
“John?” the detective called gently, bringing him back to reality.
“In your own weird way, but you do.”
“Mh?”
“No, it’s very you.”
“That’s not in the rules.” he pointed out.
”Fine, you win.” he conceded eventually. “It was this morning under the shower - Anarchy in the UK, if you really must know.”
“Did we remember to order spring rolls?” asked Sherlock.
“What about—“
Sherlock stood up. If he hadn’t known better, John would have thought to have noticed a hint of shame buried deep behind those pale blue eyes.
“Kind of the same.” he answered with a shrug. “I mean, my circumstances were less… unusual, but I can’t imagine it must have been easy for my mother to raise two kids on her own. There are so many things she could have done better, but to be honest… I don’t think I could have done it any differently.” He lowered his gaze, hands twisting nervously around his glass. “I think that’s part of why I’m so terrified of ever becoming a parent.” he said. “There is so much you can do wrong.”
Besides, what was there to explain? He’d been perfectly clear. That kiss, him, meant nothing to him. John didn’t know how he could have been stupid enough to believe otherwise.
Outside the thick glass the sun shined bright and bathed the small room, flooding it with a buttery golden light.
Immediately after he’d gotten discharged, Sherlock had come along. And though none of them had said it, John knew that it had become immediately clear to every woman he’d dated ever since that they had no shot at competing with Sherlock Holmes.
“Yeah.”
“I think we’re supposed to take turns answering each question with complete honesty, and then stare at each other for four minutes. ” he explained, before hurriedly adding: “We don’t have to do the last part, though.”
“Anything.”
“Yep, all of them.” confirmed Sherlock. “Magazines are a bit old fashioned, if you ask me. You do know that there’s the internet for all that, right?”
“Right, let’s see...” he looked at his phone. “When did you last sing to yourself?”
”Doesn’t mean it’s not an added value.”
“Good point.” replied Sherlock. He wasn’t quite looking at him, more like right past him, at the bright green walls of the kitchen.
John wasn’t sure wether he was apologizing for for forcing him to answer, for putting him through that, or both. Probably both. It didn’t matter, though. He forgave him. Of course he did.
added a small voice in the back of his head. He paused to think about it.  Did Sherlock love him? He must do, he reasoned. He was his best friend, after all. Still, a confirmation every now and then would have been nice.
John thought of young Sherlock, a small child with a head of unruly black hair tousled by the wind, asking his mother questions she didn’t have the answer to. So lonely, so frustrated. He would have liked to give him a hug.
“What about me?”
“Fine, I’d pick Agatha Christie so that I can explain to her why most of her books are ridiculously unrealistic. Especially ‘10 little indians’ - God, I hate ‘10 little indians’!”
There was a moment of silence. And then, “John?”
“Great aim.” Sherlock commented.
Sherlock smiled enigmatically and emptied his mug, the red liquid dripping refreshingly down his throat. “You first.”
“Then it’s your turn now, yes?”
Usually, he would have found that annoying - he’d grown tired of the teasing and the manipulation. But he was drunk and tired, and him and Sherlock were close now, too close for him to be able to form a coherent thought, let alone a sentence.
hungry.
The cabbie was looking at them curiously through the rearview mirror and John couldn’t help but wonder what he might be thinking. Had he mistaken them for a couple, like Angelo and Mrs. Hudson the first time they’d met him? Was he sensing the weird tension between them? Was he blaming it on a first date gone wrong?
“You’re upset.” Sherlock said.
He observed the man sitting in front of him.
“Mh.”
“What?”
“No, no, I didn’t say that. I just said it’s new.”
“How dare you?” the detective exclaimed drammatically, looking insulted at the mere accusation that he hadn’t been truthful.
“Good. You should get on with the gin, then.”
Sherlock
“Done.”
Sherlock shook his head.
”I’m not entirely convinced. I’m not really a fan of spirits. As you know I prefer other... recreational substances.”
“Right.” said Sherlock, although part of John felt like he didn’t sound entirely convinced.
”The game, John.” he explained, impatiently. “How does one win the game?”
“God, I’d forgotten how good this is.” he commented.
“Err, without.”
Sherlock raised both hands in surrender.
”John? Open the door please.”
“I truly do!”
“I think... I think I wouldn’t mind waking up with your powers of deduction.” he said, after a moment of consideration.
“Yeah, but anyone could have said that. I want to hear
John straightened up. “Yes, I think so.”
”Yeah, it was one hell of a coincidence.” said John light-heartedly.
“Yeah?”
He tried to read a little, without any success.
Sherlock fell silent for a few uncomfortable minutes; John could basically hear the sound of the wheels turning inside his head, pondering, reflecting.
“Do you take it with or without sugar? I forget.” he asked, head peeking out of the kitchen doorframe.
“Because it doesn’t make sense, Sherlock!” he snapped. “The cocktails, the compliments, the kiss. It’s not
He smiled and John couldn’t help but grin in return. Many things could be said about Sherlock Holmes - he was annoying, arrogant and often rude - but no one could deny that he had the kind of smile that can easily light up a room.
“It was a long time ago.” he begun, eyes fixed on his empty glass. “I was fresh out of college and I didn’t have any prospects in life. I was in a dark, miserable place, and I spent my days chasing the the thrill, as I do now, just by… other means, if you know what I mean. I was sitting on my bathroom floor and I remember thinking ‘I’ve done too much’. I could feel that I’d made a terrible, terrible mistake.
It was a nice day.
“Yes. Merry.”
John kissed him. It felt like summer rain, pouring down the ceiling, flooding their souls. And in that moment, in that beautiful, delicate moment, everything felt perfect, like every broken piece had finally found its place.
No matter what happened between them, he needed to at least be friends with Sherlock. And if that meant they had to go back to secrets and half-truths, so be it.
Eventually, it was Sherlock who broke it.
He guessed he should have seen it coming. There was no keeping secrets with Sherlock. To be honest, he wasn’t even sure why he wanted to keep it a secret. After all, they were both adult men, and surely even Sherlock could… relate. Couldn’t he?
“Ugh, sorry, that was cheesy.”
“You knew I’d be here.”
“Do I?”
He cleared his throat and tried to focus on the questions, still unable to shake that idiotic grin off his face.
“Fine.” Sherlock grabbed John’s G&T from his hand and took a sip from it. “See? Completely safe.” he said, and put it back on the coffee table.
”I’m not!” John protested. “I’ve just… ran out of ideas. What’s yours? Biggest accomplishment, I mean.”
“Fine, I’m gonna let it slide.”
“You okay?”
Once they were inside the apartment, Sherlock placed the white plastic bag containing their food atop the already crowded coffee table. Their half-empty gin and tonics were still sitting next to it.
“Yes!” he replied furiously. “Like it or not, I know you better than anyone.”
“Alright, old boy.” he said to his reflection before leaving the bathroom. “You can do this.”
“That’s not an option either.”
“Yeah, they should be on the bottom of the bag.”
”I’m not angry.” Sherlock interrupted him, and for maybe fifteen seconds John felt hopeful. “I’m irritated.”
“I suppose.” murmured Sherlock thoughtfully. “Although you know what I think of coincidences.”
“Well, maybe if you had relationships of your own - like, I don’t know,
“But it wasn’t?”
John laughed acerbically.
"Well, do whatever you want, I'm-"
John frowned. “Why? It’s your turn.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. How about you, what ability would you want?”
Do I have to recount everytime your
“That’s not an option.”

“Let’s do this then. You start.”
John blinked, eyes wet in unshed tears.
maybe it’s fun, to me it’s a nightmare. You get way too into it and you refuse to play by the rules. Need I remind you that the last time we played it you got so frustrated you smashed one of Mrs. Hudson’s teacups against the wall?”
“Yes, why not?” asked Sherlock, who didn’t look like he was joking at all.
He sighed patiently.
Sherlock glanced at the worn copy of The Hobbit still sitting on the coffee table with a small smile on the corner of his mouth.
“That I can do.” he said, plopping down on the chair.
“Fine. You first.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John thought about it for a few seconds. “Yes, I think so. Well, as happy as one can be in a situation like that. It was hard, but the routine was good for me.”
”Excuse you, do I need to remind you that we joke at crime scenes on a daily basis? And there’s plenty of death there.”
“You don’t sound too convinced.” Sherlock pointed out, raised eyebrows and curious eyes.
Sherlock snorted.
The temporary euphoria of the kiss had long gone now, leaving behind a trail of questions he was afraid to ask and didn’t have the answer to.
“Stop what?”
John crossed his arms. “Oi, we established them together!” he protested.
Sherlock rested his back against the back of the chair and glanced at the phone, as if nothing had happened. And nothing had, technically.
It was the first time he’d ever told that to someone, and he couldn’t help but feel a bit guilty for having shared that memory.
“My parents…” he begun, cautiously. “Well, I don’t think I’m in any position to judge them. They tried their best under very peculiar circumstances.”
The gray rain felt like a distant memory, left in the past.
John grinned, despite himself. He couldn’t help the sensation that maybe Sherlock did love him after all, even though he wasn’t the type to say so out loud, and that made him feel happier than it probably should have. It shouldn’t even be a discovery, really. Of course Sherlock loved him. He was his best friend. And yet for some reason he was smiling ear-to-ear.
In response, John took a flowered pot holder sitting near the stove and threw it at him. It landed somewhere between Sherlock’s chair and the fireplace, dangerously close to the flame.
He emptied his mug, hoping that Sherlock would blame the alcohol for his reddened cheeks.
Don’t reach out, I need some space. Don’t reach out, I need some space. Don’t reach out, I need some space.
John digged into his eggs. They were delicious, obviously, because Sherlock had to be a genius in everything he attempted. He rolled his eyes at how good they were.
”How is that different?”
John was sitting on his chair, deeply immersed in the reading of a worn-out copy of "The Hobbit"... or at least he would have been, if it hadn't been for his flatmate, who'd been shooting him dirty looks from his across the room all afternoon, making it difficult for him to concentrate.
”We’re not strangers.” objected Sherlock, who looked at best perplexed by the suggestion.
He sighed. He needed to make things right.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “Takeaway?” he suggested.
"Bor-
“Don’t be foolish, no one knows me.” Sherlock spat out, as if disgusted by the mere idea.
John paused to ponder the idea very seriously for a while.
How was one even supposed to answer something like that?
He took the chance to study him for a little while. Everything about him looked so effortless, from the dark curls framing his face to the long dark coat that he wore almost every day. And then there was his face, which was beautiful, but in an odd way, like an abstract painting. Those piercing blue eyes, those cheekbones that could cut glass were unusual traits that made him instantly recognizable. But John’s favorite part of his face was another: his lips. They were plump and pale, and he remembered noticing them instantly the first time they’d met. They were kind of lips that make women go crazy.
John chuckled mentally. He would have looked adorable if he hadn't been... well, Sherlock.
“Okay,” admitted John, raising his hands in surrender. “I misjudged you.”
John threw back his head and let out a loud, roaring laugh. Even Sherlock chuckled softly; John noticed that when he laughed his face lighted up like a Christmas tree and small wrinkles formed at the corner of his eyes.
“You want to toast to yourself?” John suppressed a smile.
He jumped to his feet, and shortly after fell back on his chair. “Okay, maybe I’m more drunk than I thought.”
“Not too unoriginal, no. Maybe too corny.”
“I’m curious of your answers, and I don’t want you to copy mine.”
"What I was
“Okay, point sort-of-taken.” he admitted with a sigh. “But that doesn’t mean I
“Wow, what a bloody great deduction!” he exclaimed, his voice rising of an octave. “I see now that you’ve chosen the right career.”
John took a moment of consideration before answering.
”We’re not strangers or potential partners either, I thought at this point we’d stopped worrying about breaking the rules.”
”I believe I’ve told you before, I’d be lost without my blogger.”
“We could call it Poirot.”
.’ thought John bitterly, but didn’t say anything. Deep inside, he knew that he had no right to be jealous. There was only place in Sherlock’s heart for one thing, his work; he’d told him that the first night they’d met. Still, it wasn’t so bad. Being second place had its perks, and even a fraction of Sherlock’s affection was better than all of someone else’s.
“Not really. I mean, I assume I’ll die of violent death - loads of people don’t like me - but who’s to say. What about you?”
There was a pause.
be sorry, you’re not the one to blame for this. If anything, I should be sorry.
Not much to work with. He made a mental note to pick up something from the supermarket the following day.
”Fine. I see how this is.”
They paid and got inside the house without a word, dragging their feet wearily through the cold and windy night.
”I think you do.” Sherlock replied knowingly.
“Liar.”
John read those few words over and over, as if trying to memorize them, hoping that maybe on the fifteenth reread they would sound a bit less harsh.
the answer was yes, despite every effort, every therapist, every medication, the answer was still yes.
”Oh, right.” Why did everything have to be a competition with him? “I dunno, Sherlock. The first one to text an ex girlfriend loses?”
It was a statement, not a question.
to listen to.”
There were some things you couldn’t put into words until you realized you’d never have a chance to say them. He knew that, because he’d been in that situation.
His mother had struggled to move on, and she’d quickly became nothing more than a washed-out version of the woman she’d once been, the woman he remembered. He couldn’t stand to see her like that. He’d pushed on, and as soon as he’d graduated from high school he’d moved out, finished his studies and then enlisted in the army.
Sherlock turned his head towards the fireplace.
Sherlock smiled briefly. “Well, that’s… good.”
He glanced at Sherlock. He was looking outside the window too. ‘
“Oh, John, just in time. Do we have a juicer?”
“Let me think about it.” he answered, in an effort to buy himself some time.
John bit his lip thoughtfully.
John fought a snicker as he handed him the bottle. “Cocktails. Right. Thirty minutes ago you were sulking on your chair, refusing to eat, and now you’re making cocktails.”
He crossed his arms.
He glared at Sherlock. Conciously, he knew it wasn’t his fault, but realizing that only made him feel more furious at him.
He’d just been unlucky. That was it.
“Okay. You start.”
“Yeah, I can see that.”
Sherlock crossed his arms, eyebrows shooting up in skepticism.
“You’re not broken.” he said, slowly and quietly. “And I don’t want someone else. I want you.”
“I mean, can I avoid it?”
“No, no. Sorry.” Sherlock turned his head towards John and for a moment their eyes met mid-air. “I was just... thinking.”
The city outside the window of the cab looked as pretty as a postcard. John was observing it, fascinated, watching the buildings grow smaller and smaller as the  cab darted through traffic. Somewhere along the process of getting in a cab, reaching the restaurant, picking up the food and getting back in another cab it must had stopped raining, because now the dark blue sky was clear and cloudless.
Sherlock cleared his throat and tried to change the subject.
“I’m just going to say this once.” he said, between his teeth. “Who I sleep with is none of your concern.”
“Being nice?” he replied, though it sounded more like a question than a statement.
“Do you mind staying on topic?” he asked, heaving an exasperated sigh.
”Whose turn is it?” asked John after a few seconds of silence.
Of course, John thought angrily, he wasn’t even trying to apologize. He was only interested in finishing the thirty-six bloody questions. Typical.
Sherlock thought about it for a few seconds. “Uhm, I don’t remember.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it.
“I was never an easy child, you know” he continued after a moment of hesitation, “And to be honest neither was Mycroft. We were lonely and resentful. We couldn’t connect with other children, no matter how hard he tried.”
“You washed the glasses.” John looked first at the drinks, then at Sherlock, incredulous. “What about your experiment, with the blood? It sounded important.”
“Some strawberry jam, a carton of spoiled milk, some sinister looking yogurt and… i think that’s it.”
John scoffed. ‘Angry’ was a bit of an understatement. Absolutely furious, more like.
“Care to explain what you need that for?” John finally managed to ask.
Sherlock stared at him for a long moment - his expression, as always, was unreadable. For a brief second John thought that he was going to be mad at him, but then his lips curled into a smile.
"What?" John finally looked up from his book, only to find a very grumpy Sherlock sitting in front of him, completely wrapped in a weighted blanket and with a murderous look in his eyes.
“Where is it?”
he suggest? He quickly sifted through Sherlock’s favorite activities: annoying him, being an arrogant git, occasionally texting The Woman. None of those counted as real hobbies, though.
”You got that bit right. Then what?”
“I guess it’s... acceptable. But how does one win?”
, as you call it, has affected your concentration at work?”
“What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about
“They’re all facts, and they’re all true. I don’t understand what you want from me.” said John. He was still staring into Sherlock’s pale blue eyes, unwilling to be the first to break eye contact.
“You know, it’s gonna take all night if you’re going to be so technical with every question.”
“Let’s see what we have.” he said, opening the fridge. The inside of it, as it is the case for most single men sharing an apartment, was a scene of desolation. “Mayonnaise, some lettuce, a thumb. More gin and tonics…”
“Oh, shut up!” John rebutted. But he was smiling.
John didn’t say anything. He didn’t think he’d ever heard anyone past the age of fifteen refer to their mother as ‘annoying’, but that was Sherlock for you.
answers.”
“Do you even know where we keep the coffee pot?” he asked.
“Oh, sod off.” replied John quietly as his face rapidly turned crimson.
“Like what?”
He looked… hurt, and John had the distinct impression to have hit a sore subject.
“Okay, but before I answer I want some wine too. It’s not fair that only one of us gets to be tipsy.”
Sherlock smiled softly. “For the record, I think you would make an excellent father.”
Sherlock glanced uneasily at the fireplace.
“Coffee?” he offered.
John made for the bathroom, stumbling along the way, and once he reached it he got inside and locked the door.
to say,"
“I don’t know, have you tried the cupboard?”
“No, me neither.” Sherlock nodded in agreement.
That seemed to placate Sherlock, who smirked and leaned heavily onto the chair. “You know, you make winning arguments almost too easy.”
”Yes. You are.” he seethed. “You always are. With your kisses, and your compliments, and your being cute. Just stop it.”
”No.” he replied, doing his best to keep a firm voice. “And I think you should just speak or move on, because I’m tired of—“
“Are we okay?”
have been an exceptionally happy childhood.”
John opened his mouth. Then he closed it. Then he groaned in frustration. There was no winning, was there?
Sherlock stared at the other for what seemed like forever before sighing and giving him a resigned look.
He repeated them in his head like a mantra, trying to make sense of them.
drunk, you know?” John said, words slightly slurred by the alcohol.
CW/TW: this chapter contains mentions of PTSD and self hatred
Losing Sherlock had been hard. And finding out, after two years of grieving, that he was very much alive had been even harder. But learning that he’d been there, the day of his own funeral, hearing John’s speech and watching him mourn while knowing that he could have protected him from all that suffering? That was just too much. It was the shitty cherry on top of a shitty cake.
“John! Are you done?” called a voice from the living room, interrupting his train of thought.
“Very well.” John slipped his phone out of his pocket and unlocked it. “
“Still counts. We both  have complicated relationships with our siblings. Your turn.”
“Okay, okay.” Sherlock slurred. “My turn now.”
Sherlock snapped his fingers. “Yes! Coffee. Good idea.”
”Agreed.” Sherlock said with a nod.
“Yep.” he confirmed.
”Both.”
He checked his phone in search of the next question, number thirteen, and realized that according to the site they’d completed the first round.
”A bit, yeah.”
When he saw him, he didn’t seem startled. He simply kept unbuttoning his coat nonchalantly, seemingly unaware of John’s presence.
”I’m fine, I’m fine.” he managed to say a few seconds of coughing and gasping for air.
“Are you planning on moving out?” Sherlock asked calmly.
the voice in the back of his head commented sharply.
John folded his arms. If Sherlock thought that a little sweet talk could change the way he felt, he was dead wrong.
Luckily for him, there was plenty of food left, scattered here and there across the carpet, still inside the neat little boxes. The sweet and sour chicken, although cold, tasted heavenly on his tongue, and yet even that couldn’t distract him from asking himself stupid, pointless questions. Where was he? Was he alone? Was he happy? Was he with the Woman? What were they talking about?
“Yes, I suppose that’s true. What’s your answer, then? I’m curious about what you’ll say.”
”I’m only trying to tell you how I feel.” Sherlock protested weakly.
He spoke quietly, barely loud enough for John to hear, his iridescent blue eyes fixed on the parquet.
“I have to say, I like this rebellious side of you, John.”
”You’re the best… and the only friend I’ve ever had.”
John grinned, grateful. He cleared his throat.
“Is everything okay?” he asked, without looking him in the eyes.
John snickered. He still hadn’t quite grown used to Sherlock’s sudden mood swings, but for once he was relieved that they existed. He wasn’t sure how much longer he would have been able to endure grumpy-Sherlock.
“I don’t
Useful to what, John didn’t know, but he didn’t worry about it.
Sherlock turned his head towards him. “Isn’t it obvious? I’m making cocktails. Now, pass me the gin.”
“What is it?”
“You know how it is, my roommate is a psychopath who decided to fill our only glasses with what seems like blood for no apparent reason.”
Sherlock tilted his head slightly, surprised. He hadn’t anticipated such an answer.
“What about you, who’d you choose?”
“You are. A little.”
John had to bite his tongue to keep himself from responding in kind. Everytime he'd given in to the temptation he'd quickly regretted it; Sherlock might look like a cold-hearted arsehole when he was in one of his 'moods', but it was surprisingly easy to offend him and the last thing he wanted right now was a useless fight.
As the hot water washed over him, John thought back to the events of the previous night. He remembered it all. The things they’d told each other. The taste of the gin and tonic on his tongue. They way Sherlock’s skin had felt against his. The way their bodies fit together like two puzzle pieces.
“Do I what?”
John looked up to his flatmate. They both knew exactly what he was referring to.
“Okay, now that we’ve established that we can both read minds.” - Sherlock nodded vigorously in agreement - “Can we go back to the questions?”
“Stop it. Just stop it.” he said.
Sherlock snickered and took another sip of his G&T.
There was a bizarre expression painted on Sherlock’s handsome features. It was a mix of bewilderment and something else John couldn’t quite place.
“I like… well, what don’t I like?” John could tell by his voice that he was smiling. “I like the way you frown slightly when you’re very concentrated on something. I like your sweaters, even though they’re absurd and look like something my father would wear. I like how you close your eyes when you listen to a song you like, bobbing your head slightly to the rhythm. I like that you always know what to say to me when I’m down, and that you don’t put up with my shit when I’m being insufferable (which is often). I like how kind you are to everyone you meet, because life hasn’t been kind to you. But most of all I like how you make me feel, like I’m fifteen again, how you make my heart do somersaults.”
“Ta da!”
And now Sherlock who wanted ‘space’.
woah this was quite a journey! it took me a few months to write this, but i have to say i’m really pleased with how it turned out. as always, please leave some feedback in the comments (if you feel like it). english is not my first language and it really helps me improve! thank you for reading <3
“Yeah, I was a bit overzealous with the limes.” admitted Sherlock.
“I can’t.” he said quietly.
He sighed deeply.
He cleared his throat.
”I’m sorry. Just- I’m sorry.” was the only thing he could think of to say.
“Merry?” Sherlock volounteered.
”And your friends. Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, even Mycroft.”
“Beats me.” he replied with a shrug.
John had the very distinct sensation of being humoring a small child. There was something comforting in that thought. Like maybe Sherlock needed him as much as he needed him.
”I couldn’t believe my luck.” he said, twitching a smile. “You were the perfect flatmate under every aspect.”
“I’m not sure. I mean, by all means it
“Nice glass.” Sherlock observed sarcastically.
”Hey, I have no idea what I’ll look like when I’m ninety. Besides, I like how I look right now, I wouldn’t mind being like this for the rest of my life.”
“No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”
“Because you don’t want this!” John finally blurted out. “I’m a mess. And I’m selfish, and I’m angry, and I love you, I do, but even I know that’s not always enough. You deserve someone who can love you fully, not these broken remains of a man who will always need medications to sleep at night and to get through the day.”
“I hate you.” mumbled John, resuming his climb of the stairs.
Sherlock crossed his arms.
“I do.”
Something about that whole situation made him think that there had to have been something else to it.
“If you were able to live to the age of ninety and retain either the mind or body of a thirty-years-old for the last sixty years of your life, which would you want?”
Hearing it come out of his lips he realized that it sounded more like a reproach than he’d meant it to - oh well, there wasn’t much he could do about it now.
John just stood there for a few seconds, observing him, unsure of what to do, before sitting down in his own chair. Sherlock didn’t seem to take notice of his arrival, though John knew that he must had been aware of his presence. They sat in silence for a while, avoiding each other’s gaze, both unwilling to be the first one to speak.
He froze. Was girlfriend even the right word? He scanned the impassive face in front of him in search of a reaction, but he found nothing.
”What’s wrong with Elton John?”
“Wow, I hadn’t done a proper shot in like forever. Takes me back to the college days.”
“True.” said Sherlock. He took a sip, and John did the same.
“Nothing!” he answered more loudly.
“That’s not good. We still have a set and a half to go. We need to sober up. What’s a good way to sober up quickly?”
”Oh, don’t make that face.” said Sherlock as if he’d read his mind. “Certainly it’s not news to you that I randomly check through your room.”
“Surprisingly, yes.”
Cons: Sherlock might be out there, and he was not ready to face him just yet.
He casted Sherlock another glance. Fuck it. If they had to seem a couple, they would at least look like a happy one. He pulled his phone out of his pocket.
“If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?” he repeated patiently.
