Dean couldn’t get the image out of his mind. Cas bloodied, broken, black acid threading through his veins and slowly swallowing him whole.
Dean continues tracing over Cas' skin, fingers dancing in swirls and journeying farther down the angel's body and back up. Still, he doesn't look in his eyes. And Cas lays rigid, like he's afraid if he moves at all that Dean will stop all of it.
Dean's grinning down at his phone, line in the message bar blinking but neither of them message anything else back or forth. He's just staring down at Cas' stupid emojis lineup and defeated at how fucking endearing it is when John jumps in with a comment.
Hell, in some way, purgatory was as close as Dean's ever gonna get to something like this. Sure, a lot higher stakes, a lot more killing and a lot less downtime- but the essence is the same. A sense of freedom in a place where no one can see you at your barest instincts. Stripped raw. Pure and unfiltered.
"And if that happened..." Abraham continues, "I love your sister... but you know what she can do. Magda.... Magda's our cross to bear."
With the buzz of conversation ruminating around them, dying down with the night, Dean almost doesn't hear the front door creaking open from behind them. Really, he just doesn't think much of it.
He could stand the break from Crowley, too. It's been weeks of this and still they're no closer to finding or catching Lucifer than they'd been when they started.
He glares, tone even, "If I'm just a monster in a meatsuit. If my motives were impure- what would possibly be stopping me from killing you right now?"
"I have cash, do you need cash?" He asks as they three stop beside their cars, readying to part ways. Hands already deep in his pockets, he fishes out his wallet. There's several twenties stashed in there, "That's customary. Right? N- not that I'm-"
What he can do right now is give him one thing, though. A moment. He can do that. Because Dean Winchester is shit with words. Because Dean Winchester is a man of action. That's how he shows people he cares. That's how he'll show Cas he cares.
." Dean jams a finalizing fist in the space between them. A mock imitation of an order to a man that doesn't take them, "You stick around for Sam. You stay and you be a dad to
"I'm not going anywhere. My... my love for Dean isn't something that will fade in the way that human love can. How I feel exists in my being now, and it always has. Not- not in the way that it's a facet of destiny, but in that it isn't. It was a choice, letting myself fall for Dean. Maybe my first one-"
"Well, looks like a case of the crazies. But..." John slumps into the booth with a grunt, "The garden variety kind."
Dean's curled over, trying to keep from giving in to unconsciousness, when he notices Cas coming back into the fight, tugging the angel blade from within his sleeve. Dean rises, aiming his left for another hit, but she punches him directly in the fist, metal colliding with bone. He yells, falling back, barely a moment passing before she lands a kick in his side, sending him careening into the tail end of her van.
Crowley softens first, easing into a gentle smile, "I kid, Cas. Angel, demon, God, human, and all in-between... Dean Winchester is never a sloppy second. In fact, he may be the man to which all others are measured."
right, too. Crowley has been a decent contact and tentative co-conspirator in many of the big fights they've had the past couple of years. Amara being the most recent.
The same word keeps filtering through his mind over and over, forcing the memory to stick. It's something he knows he needs to hold onto.
Cas takes a steadying breath, lowering his gaze once more to the floorboards at his feet, "I took a vessel, just for a short time- this one mission. Devout, kind...
Cas takes a deep breath, the two of them standing there simply holding one another for what feels like far too short a time. Or maybe it's just Cas holding Dean and Dean letting him. It doesn't matter.
Once the pair find their way to a road, it's clear they're in Lawrence. The outer edges of the same cemetery Dean had popped out of last, and the same one the boys had spread John's ashes a decade ago. Which means they're less than four hours outside of Lebanon if they're able to wrangle up a ride.
Dean's apt to just ignore that one, but Sam pipes up instead, his voice rumbling against his chest, "Hey! You could be in a ditch right now, so how about you stow the commentary?"
Cas' face contorts in a mix of horror and disgust, forcing a snort from Dean mid-sip of his coffee- he starts choking and sputtering the stuff all over the table.
"They took everything from me. All my life, I dreamed about angels. I studied them. I made them my life's work, until finally I learned the spell to summon one- Ishim.
But Cas is watching with sympathetic eyes, and he's is probably the one other person aside from Dean who can ground Sam that much instead. Just by being around. Being there.
"Me giving you 'the talk.' You know how many times we've had to tell some civilian that monsters are real?"
Dean knows why- Sam doesn't seem to get it yet, but he doesn't really want him to, either. Not when the kid's already got enough on his plate as it is. So he drops his eyes, patting a loose hand on Cas' shoulder and stepping in line behind his father.
Dean strips out of his grimy jeans, switching on the hot water a little below max- and stepping under it, letting the droplets scorch into his skin. Scathing water seeps into his muscles and pounds hot against his scalp to help the ever-incoming headache.
He watches Cas inhale a deep breath, take another sip of coffee and finally set down the mug, opening his eyes. His gaze immediately slides to Dean, feeling the eyes on him. Dean jerks his vision away, coffee spilling over the edge of the mug he's still holding in mid-air while just staring at Cas for way too long like some kind of weirdo. He doesn’t even bother trying to cover up the movement. Just takes a large gulp and sets the cup down loudly, staring at the tiny puddle of coffee on the table in front of him.
“He ditches me,” Lucifer whimpers, eyes red-rimmed and lip quivering the split second before he slaps back on that grin, letting out a chuckle and pointing at the boys, “And you, too, by the way. And rides off into the sunset with Auntie Amara...”
Dean nods, rolling his eyes at the sappy look on Cas' face, cause that's better than getting all gooey about it, "Go on, get out of here. I'll call you in the morning."
Dean scoffs and evades his eyes, shrugging Sam's hand off of him. His face is getting a little too hot. Dad is the absolute last person he wants to be thinking about right now. He doesn't want to think about how dad would've reacted had he seen what went down at the BBQ last night. He doesn't want dad's opinion on Cas taking his hand in the Impala. He doesn't want dad to ever know that Dean
She perks up at the end, same as the boys. Dean, especially, nods enthusiastically, "Yes, alright!" He snaps his fingers, holding back a grin, "Oh... since the last time we saw you? I killed Hitler."
For all her bravado, and her certainty behind a bravely raised chin- it all drops as soon at the cover singes beneath her palm. She tears her hand away and the thing catches flame in the indented remnants of her print.
because he'd been that kid once. The psychic kid. The dangerous kid with powers he didn't understand.
He's nothing. Barely even an angel... certainly not one of the Lord. And he doesn't have the time to give this stranger an answer, much less find one.
"Hey." There's a question in his voice, but this doesn't prompt Dean to start talking, so he draws one out, "Everything... okay?"
affirmative," She nods against his hand, trying and failing to change her posiitoning to one less compromising, giving up with a huff, "I've already got
He doesn't remember what dad was like before mom died, of course, but Dean does a little bit. Might even be a reason he's held onto the concept of their dad with such a strong grip for so long- cause he knew what kind of a father John has always been capable of being.
Without preamble, he heaves his hand nearly against Cas' chest. It doesn't have to connect to send the angel careening backwards into the opposite wall, a smattering of clothes shaking loose from a rack and raining down over Cas' shoulders.
Maybe this wasn't a good idea. She's obviously busy- having fun. Taking a break. Why would she want to see her poor substitute of a father figure? It's- this is a bad idea.
There's nothing special about his hair, really. It's thicker than he thought it would be, looking at him, but he's just got the hair of a thirty-something year old guy. A little soft, a little curled on a cowlick in the back.
Cas steps back to Dean's side, looking down at the doc furiously. Marion holds his hands out, as if in surrender, breathing labored, "All right, look, she didn't give me her name. When we were done, the driver bailed. I got paid, and then some other chick shows up, and they all drive away."
"Good one." Sam snorts, breaking out into a laugh. He leans against the hood of the Impala, peering around the lot while waiting for dad to park a few spots down, "Cas here yet?"
to keeping up being pissed at Cas just so he can go do what he'd told himself he would for all those weeks.
"It'll fall apart. Someone will use us against each other or they'll kill you again and-" Dean goes back to watching his fingertips trail a pattern on Cas' shoulder.
many stories about you Winchesters." She croons, weaving through the bodies glued to the floor, unable to move any limb an inch- and plants her feet firmly on either side of Sam, prodding a teasing finger at his face, "And... I desperately want the Lucifer thing to be true. The idea that he left a meat suit alive is just so deliciously weak."
Billie whips out her hand, air knocking both boys to their asses, ignoring their slue of cries against it. This was supposed to be
Dean, of course, figured that out a little late. Only realizing a handful of years ago just how hard he was making it for the kid brother who saw a lot more than he let on.
”If you’d like to go on a hunt, Claire, I would join you if you like.” Cas says, completely out of nowhere.
Without a second glance, Cas stalks across the lot to his own pickup, and it's just Dean and John, staring one another down.
"Okay, but when we went over to his place yesterday," he sucks some more syrup from his thumb, tossing up a hand, "We got a whole bunch of jack and a little bit of squat. There was no hex bags, no EMF, no sulfur, which means no case."
Sam grins and Eileen smiles up at him. Their stools are basically on top of each other and she has both arms wrapped around one of Sam's, one leg resting over his lap. Sam's eyes catch hers and he looks down, all sheepish. Sam, the big lug, all six-foot-something of him and he still blushes when his girlfriend looks at him. Dean can't help but smile. He's glad Sam gets to have a happy, sappy start at life with Eileen.
"Of course," Cas smiles, placing a hand on Dean's shoulder briefly, then dropping it, "Call me with anything."
That's the thing about Jody... she doesn't just roll with the punches, she seeks out new ones to take for everyone else even though she's already bruised up good. Taking in the girls, losing her family, losing Bobby, learning about this whole underground life of theirs killing monsters, nearly getting killed time and again because of them... she's one of the strongest people he knows.
All these weeks with him, he’s learned a thing or two about reading that demon. He may even hold just as much fear and wrath as Cas in these moments.
With a gasp of stale air, Sam jolts awake horizontal on a cold cement floor. Flickering light claws up the walls from scattered candles, and his hands are securely tied behind his back.
Cas is about to say something else but Dean nudges him, nodding at Jody. They both turn to her and she smiles, stopping in front of the trio.
Sam looks down at his phone and the string of notifications that've popped up in the past couple of minutes alone, "One sec," He switches over to his laptop, presumably tapping rapidly through a couple of articles. His eyes flicker across the screen, widening.
He hops the fence, clumsily, it shaking more under his weight than he bargained for. Sam walks around it through the brush.
Except this isn’t like that. There’s no short breaths or hollow chest, it’s just a dull ache through his entire body, his face hot and eyes uncontrollably watering no matter how many times he swipes a palm across them.
He jumps through the door, tumbling forward onto his shoulders, rolling to his knees. In one swift move, he raises to a stand and peers around, pulling the demon blade from his inner coat pocket. Loraine is seated in front of him, between the stairs and Elvis.
There's no goal less pure than that." he nods, still looking at Cas, "One too many fallen angels on this earth, wouldn't you agree?"
They're not far now, just a few streets down. He takes out his phone to text Dean, tell him he'll only be a few minutes- Crowley grabs the phone from his hands.
”It's- we don't talk about anything! You just let him walk all over you because that's easier than actually fighting for something for yourself for once in your life!" He pauses, swallowing, "And I don't talk about it either. I've just let it happen, but I'm not a kid anymore so there's no excuse to keep ignoring all the shit I'm supposed to pretend I don't know about."
Dean hopes to God that he's in his room, just to make this easy. If he's outside he could be literally anywhere. Cas tends to get lost in nature if he has enough free time to explore it. Him finding his way home isn't a problem, but Dean doesn't want to have to go about
He lugs his stereo out into the library, figuring they can hear the speakers enough from the kitchen. Plus, maybe with this many people it might be nice to make use of the library like an old timey banquet hall.
Someone died here. Whether it was an angel or a human is not of his concern. It was still a person. And it was murder.
"The autopsy results." Sam eyes him, leaning against the counter with a bit more concern in his eyes, "Are you still drunk?"
There will be some images within this chapter for text messages. If for whatever reason you can't view them - you should be able to - I'm also posting what they say at the notes at the end of the chapter.
John doesn't let him get far enough to go for a third- and since Dean's acting on pure rage, barely able to register his own moves, John gets the jump on him.
Without even thinking about it, a small smile forms of Dean's own, too- just by imagining the curl of Cas' lips.
But Cas would ask himself that while watching Dean sleep with his boots on an a gun beneath his head, and he'd take away his nightmares and know it wasn't true. He's not simply a man.
Ruled by vengeance for much of his life, his distaste for all things supernatural will surely not do Cas any favors in winning the man's friendship. Furthermore, he's a man of control. He's radiating irritation at his current lack of such in a situation that cannot be controlled- his gaze piercing on Dean's back when he finally speaks up, pointedly not looking over at Cas at all.
Cas never eases peacefully or gradually into wakefulness. Every time, it's been with a startled gulp of air, eyes rapidly springing open, every one of his senses refocusing all at the same time. It's an overwhelming and horrible sensation.
He throws a right hook, Lucifer tilts back so it's a miss, and merely continues, sneering, "I know what a weak, duty-bound..." Cas throws another punch, and it's dodged again.
Castiel, too, finds himself grateful for such things. Even though he's lived thousands of lifetimes, it's only within this entirely too short one beginning on the day he befriended Dean Winchester, that he's actually lived a day at all. Before Dean, Castiel simply existed. He was a shadow, a soldier, a creature without a heart. Now he's a body, a father, and has a heart so full it's overwhelming at times.
"Site 94?" Ketch pitches in, "It's a government facility, off-books. Shadow-ops. One of those places that officially doesn't exist."
It’s probably odd seeing the guy in your dad’s meat suit eating pancakes for the first time in the most sheepish and adorable way possible, when in another life she would’ve been the one to copy his movements like a kid usually does with their dad. Maybe she did once, and these quirks of hers came from Jimmy. Now here she is passing them back to Cas in some weird kind of full-circle.
"We were already dead." Dean says flat, holding his gaze, "Being locked in that cell with nothing... I've been to Hell. This was worse."
He missed this, too. Doing nothing with Cas out in the front of the bunker, dead of night, or early mornings waiting for the sun to pop up. Just, shootin the shit and hanging out like two guys who can do that sort of thing.
"Of course," Sam scoffs, nodding, running a hand through his hair, "Of course. That's your angle, isn't it?"
"She was my boss..." She pauses, looking between them, "Is it true what they're saying, that she, you know... killed herself?"
When neither Dean or Cas make a move toward the bathroom, she raises her brows expectantly, "Not a request, boys, I won't have you getting vamp blood all on my couch."
Dean responds almost instantaneously, and it's clear the day has weighed on him, so Cas jokes along, trying in any small way to lighten his mood- which must be dire because he doesn't so much as mention Lucifer. But Cas doesn't pry.
"Cassie, who pooped in your Cheerios this morning?" Crowley grins, pulling out the chair across the table to settle in.
Jack is more excited about meeting Claire and the other girls than anything else, and wants to make sure they get enough snacks for everyone. And Claire's favorite beer. He'd texted Kaia to ask which one. Frankly, it's nice to hear Jack just blabber on about nothing for a little while so the focus isn't on Dean.
"You don't have to prove anything, Dean." Cas lowers his eyes, voice small as he deposits his jackets over the end of the bed and lays back against the pillow, peering up at Dean through his lashes, "It's like you said, we don't always agree, but at the end of the day I know who my real friends are."
"They won't understand," Ishim rolls his eyes, shaking his head at Cas one more time. Like it's all the guy knows how to do.
It's more of a restaurant than simply a bar in the daylight hours, but it's enough of a distinction that at night the lights are lowered and they stop serving all food outside of a couple of appetizers. The walls are lined with neon signs of various labels, and framed photographs of nothing of particular interest outside of a generalized midwestern theme. It's wood-paneled and old fashioned, smells of nothing but stale beer, and the surfaces are perpetually sticky. Sam's only been here a couple of times when Dean's dragged them both out with him, but Dean seems to love it. Especially when the bartenders started to know his name.
It's also, however, how he first started to realize the complexities that make up Dean Winchester in those early days of getting to know him. That complex mix of feelings and words is... well, it's come to have a sort of pull.
"Looks pretty good for a guy just got back from the Marianas Trench." John scoffs, taking a swig of his beer.
If Dean asked him, he would. He'd stay another hour, or two. Until he really had to go. Maybe after Dean's lids are heavy with sleep and shoulders slumping into unconsciousness. Cas would sit next to him as he dozed off, maybe place a hand on him to make sure he drifted into a peaceful sleep free of nightmares.
He’s been staring down at the photos on Dean’s desk again, elbows propped there and hands threaded into his hair- and the passage of time suddenly feeling askew. Stretching by the millisecond.
Dad’s not gonna get it. He’s gonna mess it all up and make it a weird thing... It shouldn't be... it's not like that with Cas. It's never been like that with Cas. Dean definitely doesn't think of Cas in any kind of way... like a... girlfriend.
"Tommy." Cas announces himself as he kicks off from the wall, John following suit beside him. Tommy's gait slows- the two other men at his heels following his lead.
They'd learn to live in a world without Dean Winchester in it because Dean was always meant to be a temporary fixture here. He's the guy that gets blown away halfway through the movie, in the battle, and the other guys- they feel that loss and it gets them to the end. Then, at the end of the day, when all’s said and done, they keep on living.
And he just looks at Dean like Dean is just as important, even though he's not. He's always been so much less than Cas.
"What-" Dean turns, swallowing, offering a half-smile he hopes looks more genuine than it feels, "What do they say about me?"
"And you think that means I don't... feel it?" Cas sounds hurt at the prospect. "That I don't care? How in our history together does this make sense?"
"I truly can't imagine the depths of your loss. This was your child. I can't imagine the pain. So if you leave here and you find that you can't forgive me... I'll be waiting."
He wonders if it's just the spell making Dean take this all so in stride, or if it's just Dean. If, all those years ago, this stuff actually used to be cool to him- instead of the nightmare inducing fuel it's been for Sam since the day Dean brought him in the loop of it all.
No matter how much Dean gripes about it, he always seems to sleep better when Cas is around to watch over him. Might be a sort of instinct- his body finally feeling safe enough to let it’s guard down.
Thank you guys for reading so far! Please comment, leave any kind of feedback, I’d love to hear from you :)
"And I need love," Lucifer continues, as though nothing's happened, shouting at Cas, lip curling. Tommy takes his chance to flee, scrambling for the door from behind Lucifer. "I had a really
John takes it, flipping open the barrel to check it for himself, same as Dean, then clicks it back, satisfied, "Mind clueing me in on what we're up against?"
They round the corner, one after the other, and Dean’s gaze finds Cas immediately, slouched off to the right in one of the chairs at the table, an empty teacup in front of him and his head propped in one hand. It's a very human gesture, really, and it makes Dean smile.
Dean waits, but Cas doesn't elaborate any further than that. He's not even sure if he wants him to. It'd be one thing if he's just talking about being an angel- passing out because he's been under heavy fire and the wounds are too bad to keep him in the ring. But Cas was human for months. He's slept hundreds of times.
"Yeah, then tell me what it's like cause it's lookin to me like you're butt-buddies with a fucking body snatcher without a lick of thought. I always knew Sammy was the smarter one of you, but this, Dean?" He scoffs, taking a swig of his drink with a hollow laugh while he pours the next one. "And you got your brother wrapped up in it now?"
It's different this time. Maybe because they're both sober. Maybe because Cas isn't braced and waiting for Dean to push him away this time. Maybe because they're both less afraid. It doesn't matter the reason, because whatever it is, this time is different.
Dean's heart is hammering in his chest, unable to stop holding his eyes with Cas' because Cas is doing it again... showing Dean how completely in love with him he is. And for how long, too. He remembers that time all those years ago when they were barely friends yet, but still somehow so important to each other. They've always been like this. Dean pulling Cas to his feet and Cas pulling Dean. Because he liked him then too.
"Thanks, man. Love you, too." He swats Cas' shoulder with the back of his hand in passing, beelining for the door, "I say we get the hell outta here before you all decide you liked me better the other way."
It's also a decision, however, that leaves them at a standstill. Three men with weapons trained on the three men opposite. And for a moment no one says a word, until- slowly- each men take pause to shift their attention ever so slightly to the vehicle approaching from behind him with soft classical music drifting from its core.
Dean tosses down his fork, it clanks on the plate, "Fine, hold up." wipes off his mouth lazily with the corner of a napkin and tosses it on his plate, standing.
Cas snaps, and that one grumpy syllable honest to god makes Dean almost beam outright for how happy he is to hear that stupid angel voice.
Dean nods, slow, then a few more times, blinking back wetness from his eyes before breaking into a shaky grin, "So what you're sayin' is you
He imagines Dean laying in a dark room with his father and brother, the tiny screen illuminating his face. He'd probably have taken the couch in whatever hole in the wall they found because he always puts the others in front of himself. And the others are snoring away peacefully while he's left to overthink in silence, shouldering things he shouldn't. Like always.
"Samuel," Rowena sighs, grabbing at Dean's palm with dainty, gentle hands, "Those glyphs you found are an archaic form of Celtic. Ogham Chraobh."
sound bad to say it out loud like that... but he can't bring himself to take it back, no matter how sad Cas sounds about it.
Dean doesn't believe him. Cas seems to realize this and grins. Dean grins back and laughs, patting Cas' back.
Sam shrugs, brows raised and expression flat as he pulls himself out of the booth, "I'm just saying."
Cas glances at the side of the man's head, and he doesn't meet his eye but he does nod in acknowledgment. He can't even appreciate the novelty of John actually apologizing for something- because he doesn't deserve it. And it's not even true in the first place.
"Think you boys should go." Abraham raises his voice from behind Sam, and he turns abruptly, greeted by the man and his son standing alongside Dean, who's looking between he and Gail with wide, curious eyes.
She might not even be able to control herself- eyes wide and staring up at the door with complete, shattered terror- it's clear her first thought isn't even that she might be strong enough to stop the intruder. Her first thought is nothing but fear. It's all she knows.
"A light st-" Sam's frown deepens, and he throws his head back, moving to the table, "Alright, we're gonna get you some help."
on through the rest of the album, with Dean grumbling on with each new song and Sam honest to god, actually singing a few parts out loud- which turned into an outright cackle of laughter at Dean's appalled wide eyes.
"Yeah." His eyes meet Dean's in the rearview for a fleeting moment, like that kind of a friendship is something Dean might understand on a level his brother doesn't. Or maybe it's both of them knowing even the term 'friendship' doesn't quite do justice in explaining that kind of bond. Maybe it's the knowing another human who'd go up to bat for an angel, and the angel who'd do the same.
They both climb out and Cas stops to straighten his tie in the side-mirror, leaning down to inspect his hair as well- a new wave of anxiety approaching because this is the part of the job he's the absolute worst at.
"I just wanted to say..." John clears his throat, "'m sorry, kid. Sam and Dean, that's not your fault."
"Shut up." He knows Crowley is playing this up simply to get a rise out of him. Probably just for fun. A road-trip laugh.
He says that, but starts shaking the trenchcoat from his shoulders, working off the suit jacket, tugging at the collar of his tie- loosening it between practiced fingers. And Dean's just watching him, "It's not about anything, man."
He looks up, tilts his head, "I know... that Dean's trying. To let himself be loved. To show care bluntly and attempt to let himself believe he can have it. I think your father's return has actually given him a bit of perspective where that's concerned." A small smile touches the corner of his mouth, turning the tape between both hands, "Maybe motivated him."
Leave it to Cas to hit the nail on the head. Dean chuckles, "Maybe I just wanted to have you to myself for five minutes."
Dean’s gaze roves over his features anyways- takes in his injuries, nodding even though he doesn’t believe him.
There's a lot of things to hate about this job, and it's not like he's asking for recognition or anything but it'd be nice if, once in awhile, they weren't carted away as murderers when just trying their damn best in a shit-ass world.
Cas falls silent, looking up to the sky. The weight is still heavy on his shoulders, no matter Dean's words. He's like Dean in that way- it's kind of him to attempt taking the blame off, but it doesn't mean either will ever actually do that. They just cycle through, time and again, trying to ease the guilt from each other but never quite managing it. “All the same... I’m still sorry.”
"Hm," John huffs, looking back down at the knife twisting in his hand- cogs turning in his head, "Right."
"I know." She nods, rubbing the back of her neck, muttering, "Everyone's sorry," and walks away without another parting word.
He fists his hands together on the table, tracing his thumbs over and under, over and under- just staring at them.
Cas could probably learn how to fix his own vehicles if he dedicated the time, but he likes when Dean does it. He likes seeing him happy figuring out the puzzle before him, the small smiles that come out as he figures out a certain piece. It's a skill that Dean takes pride in, and it's not often that he has something like that.
"Yeah..." His eyes drift back to Cas starting up a ring toss battle with Claire. Dean doesn't know what else to do with this. He started the conversation but there's nothing else to say. Just confirming the same information at this point.
Again, Dean doesn't say anything. He's just watching Cas, hoping an answer will fall out of the fucking sky so he doesn't have to say it himself.
Spoilers at the tail end of the chapter for "Brokeback Mountain" or, in other words, where Dean and Cas watch Brokeback together.
John steps in ahead of Sam, heavy-footed to the center of the room, frowning down at a lit candle on one side of the cluttered desk.
He abandons his own truck in favor of joining John, circling to the passenger side and peering through the open window, "You got here quickly."
Dean follows suit, still looking down at the keys in his hand- starting to finger through them like he's confused as to which is which.
It's eerily reminiscent of his time in heaven. His superiors who'd sneer down at him for a fault he'd made in battle. Or a bad call involving one Dean Winchester.
But he can't be sure Dean even knows why he came to a place like this, much less if he even remembers Cas' name- so he's trying exceptionally hard to save the judgment for a time Dean can actually appreciate it.
"That's just desperate, Cassie." Crowley shrugs, readjusts his shoulders and peers back at the newspaper in his lap, "If you're going to be
her. Lucifer has made off with a colossally powerful witch. Who, by the way, is the only person alive who can slam him back in the cage." He points a firm finger at him, "He will either kill her, control her, or she will offer her services to the biggest bad in town in order to save her neck, like she
Dean holds the door, and his dad steps through first, peering through the cavernous building. The balcony overlooks the map table lit up below, leading into the library around the bend to the right- even from here you can tell this is only a fraction of the bunker's expansive size. John grasps the railing, sliding his hands over it, "You live here?"
But unlike all those other diners, Dean Winchester is seated inside. Cas can see him through the window nursing a fresh mug of coffee, another mug in the empty space across the table, waiting for Cas.
Old religious family, too up their asses about doing right by God that they screw up their own kid and make a seriously pissed off spirit for their troubles? They've seen it before. Probably see it again before the lights go out. It sucks each time. Kid deserved better than that.
"’Save me, oh God.’" Dean reads back, lowering his voice, "I've been looking into some lore, too. Nothing on goopy brains from what I know. We sure it's witchy?"
Dean and Cas trade a look, and you know it's bad when even Cas knows the lying isn't convincing, but they let him continue a few more lines anyways.
John glowers, and turns, stepping up towards an office building to the right of them, "It's this one." He grumbles, by way of ending the conversation.
"Happy Thanksgiving, Dean!" Sam shouts across the kitchen jokingly sweet, but it makes Dean grin anyway as he cracks a couple eggs over a pan.
"Now that-" Ishim waves his spoon at Cas, giving no more emotion than before, "is refreshingly accurate. But since you brought a couple of extra 'people' to our little chit-chat, we should go somewhere more private.
"So what are you gonna do if you find Kelly and, uh, Lucifer Junior?" Dean clears his throat, unwilling to further this feelings hour so either of them gets a whiff of what's in his own head, "It is a Nephilim, right?"
If you're interested, the math on the days will be in the end notes for the chapter. Yes, I did the math on the days and where they line up in the year to more accurately string together the timeline.
move you pulled back there." Dean furiously sits down on the edge of the bed, starting to tug away at his shoelaces with an aggression that slows the process more than aids it.
Dean would do it. Doesn't even have to think about it, really, if it was Cas. If he had to. If, for some reason, Cas needed a new spot to claim squatters rights for a little while.
He starts rifling through the cabinets, opens and closes a few, looking for a pot and the boxes of easy ready mac n cheese, but it's all bare. He picks up a dish towel from the ground.
He sings through it a few times before slowing, drifting off to sleep, perhaps. A peaceful dream, maybe - hopefully, for a change. One he could escape for a time, accompanied by the melody he once equated to reminding him of Cas.
Dean shoves the machete with every ounce of his strength, staring straight up at the creature with murder written in every atom of his being. The vampire is just surprised enough to stumble back a bit, loosening his grip just enough for Dean to rip the machete all the way from his hands. He swipes the blade back, slices forward. The head only partially tears, gushing blood down and across Dean's front. He twists to the side, knocking the body off of his torso. Dean stabs his entire weight into finishing off the decapitation, the blade sinking through flesh and into the dirt.
Maybe Dean and Cas have always been right, in not imagining up a good future for themselves. Sam's gone back and forth, but maybe he's fooling himself more than the others if he never even figured a Dean who might drift away from dementia or something equally as mundane.
"Be right up, hun." She winks, heels tapping purposefully against the tile as she disappears behind the counter.
Dean glares back, downing the last of his beer, "Because it's a pile. Maybe you just need a new car."
It’s born of a want more than anything else. Because it’s not like John swooped in and saved the day. He just so happened to be the last one standing at the end of it when everyone else had already been knocked to theirs asses after swinging their hand, too.
a real family. Made him feel kind of crazy sometimes when they'd have one of those good days and he'd be left wondering if maybe he's just blown it all out of proportion.
Dean starts mentally filtering through the languages he's familiar with, landing on a few that sound similar, but that doesn't mean he can translate at the top of his head.
If he could stay like this the next hour, he would, but he can't. So, he loosens his grip and lets his hands fall with one last firm pat on Cas' shoulder, glancing fleetingly to his eyes before drifting his gaze over to where his dad stands expectantly.
"Mhmm," John stands, brow furrowed over eyes blazing down on his son, his voice low, "So this is what counts as a hunter these days? Beatin' down civilians with monsters and leaving people knocked out?"
He remembers the strange man with mournful green eyes pleading for help for his ill brother. How Cas had felt such a tug to help- beyond what he'd felt with anyone in his very limited memory up to that point- where he'd followed him to his vehicle without question.
that much." He lazily swings an arm out, blasting Lucifer back against a far wall without breaking a sweat. Whiskey and spent beerbottles scatter from the dressing tables, shattering against him on his way to the floor.
He barely tugs open the door, roughly hitting it against Sam's approaching torso, when the faint sounds of a scuffle can be heard around the side of the building. He locks eyes with Sam, all pretense of former anger gone- and they dart towards the noise, boots sliding in the dirt.
"I'm glad you're alright." John separates, holding Dean an arm's length away by the shoulder, "Isolation's a bitch, ain't it?"
Then, his phone buzzes, echoing across the field. Cas' name lights up the screen, answering a prayer he never even sent out.
"Fine. I'll eat some broccoli once a week just for you, Cas." Dean declares around a mouth full of s'more.
It’s a hundred percent about something else, but he doesn’t push. Of all people, Cas is sure entitled an existential crisis or two.
It's not like Dean can't relate. Those kind of memories... they don't just go away. That’s lifetime baggage.
Cas was the first face he saw, coming out of that hazy half-deluded sleep five years ago. Since then, it's been the two of them, tossing Lucifer back and forth- trying to keep the other from having to deal with that fearsome reality on their own.
Dean jolts himself back to life, staring down at the two plates in his hands as he slides in beside Cas on the couch. He hands one off to the angel without looking at him. If he looks at him right now he's gonna keep freaking out--
"Are we actually considering this?" Dean finally asks when they're on the road, Ketch following closely behind, having encouraged that the four of them put a fair shot of distance between themselves and the agents intent on them.
Dean grabbed another couple of bottles from the fridge and made his way to his room. He wouldn’t be able to sleep much tonight, but he’d decided sometime along the ride back what he was gonna do with that time. All the supplies were waiting in a box shoved in the bottom of his closet with the rest of his small amount of belongings he’d lugged with him since he was a kid.
"Claire tell you?" Dean asks, and Cas hums a positive. "Right... still here." He pauses, "Dad showed."
"Sam and Eileen seem happy, too." Kaia nods in a direction behind Dean where Sam and Eileen are off laughing together, looking like they've had one too many and enjoying every minute of it. Dean smiles.
“Guess so.” Dean gives no indication of emotion in either direction- thrilled versus discontent. He may not know what to think at all.
He needs to convert one of the rooms in this place to a movie room. Lots of... man-cave things. Pool. Beer.
"Lucifer. Think about it. Of all the extinct rock acts, Ladyheart are the most Paleolithic. A major label sponsored comeback in 2016 for
"Brother. Witch. Kill the witch," Dean nods, certain, struggling to keep those few little things- but he meets the other man's eye. The man smiles, small, and nods, placing a firm hand on Dean's shoulder.
He still fucking hated it. All he kept thinking was, what if that’s the last time he ever talks to Cas and he was too chicken-shit to send one stupid little emoji that’ll make the feathery little guy happy?
Claire grumbles and frowns down at the table but it’s not an outright no. Kaia shoves her shoulder against her girlfriend, smiling, and Claire starts to lighten up, groaning out a “Fine.”
"I mean, obviously, you've changed," Sam adds, then pauses, "but it's all been for the better, man."
"It's just over here," She nods, leading them around the corner to a slue of offices, name tags jutting out from the wall, "This is... was… Olivia's office."
They spend the next week or so tracking down a vamp nest up north with Donna. Neither of them brings up John until they're on the road, a long haul from the next job.
He waits for the flicker of recognition to pass back through Dean's face the same way it did with the lamp, and the room number- but it doesn't.
He laughs and pockets the phone, choosing to sit outside for a minute longer rather than watching nothing at all on tv. The wind is getting more aggressive. There's probably a storm rolling in from the west. It's not filled the skies yet, though.
He knows he should get in the middle- stop the fight before it really begins. But... something stops him, keeps him listening in on the voices carrying to where he stands barefoot in the center of the hallway.
Dean shrugs with a grin, "Do traditions mean nothing, now?" when neither appear all that amused, he succumbs, hands up placating, "Alright..."
Finally, they pull into the driveway of the address listed on the post-card. A minivan is parked up close to the entrance, so there's at least a high likelihood that she's home.
Where Dean was stuck in a ravaged future with scorched earth and crazies lusting for blood on every corner, but there was also Cas. Five years in the future, no grace, a little worse for wear and nothing like the guy Dean knew at the time- but he was there. Standing beside a worn-out, broken shell of a Dean, still fighting the good fight. Didn't turn his back once in all those years, even though
Sam snorts, walking through the doorway with a dusty old crate in hand, causing him to lean back comically to be able to lug the weight of it onto the ground beside the counter. He huffs out a breath, "I think you being obsessed with braiding my hair says a lot more about you than it does me."
Cas pockets his phone and strides in the side door. It only takes a moment to locate them. They're the only three men who would wear flannel and workboots so comfortably in the middle of an upscale hotel.
"Yeah. Screw y-" There's no harshness to his words, but Dean lets the rest of that sentence die in his throat anyway and just shakes his head. "Damnit Cas, I can't keep watching you die, man."
He turns to walk back to the altar, but Dean cuts in, "You sure were chatty with the press and the cops. 'Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us'. Boy, that's quite the headline grabber."
Not ideal but not terrible, either. He could get back and hopefully whoever blasted him away still has Sam in the same location. If they don't, he'll need to track them somehow. The woman was only a human, after all.
While the demon's distracted looking his way, Sam takes the opening, darting forward to get his arms around Jody- but not fast enough. She sees him coming, and knocks him back and over the table. Dean knows he's not gonna get anywhere closer but he's gotta try anyway-
Ishim's mostly trying to keep himself alive there in the back seat, all while giving Dean periodic directions. Dean's intently focusing on the road, not about to get surprised by any other car looking to turn Baby into a half donut- and Sam and Cas are in much the same mindset, eyes roving across the dark landscape for the red-headed crazy woman on the loose.
The demon takes a slow step forward- just one, then swings. Dean jolts back, narrowly missing the blade. He takes a second swing from the left this time- stepping forward so Dean can sidestep out of the way and to the opposite end of the room, beside Loraine.
"Magda, that wasn't your fault. You are not the devil. You're not evil. And it's scary. I- I know it's scary. But you can learn how to control it. You don't ever have to hurt anyone ever again."
With that, he marches into the diner, leaving Dean standing dumbstruck with his mouth half-open and a retort that hasn't left his lips. Sam turns to his brother with simple amusement, crosses his arms, and falls casually back against the Impala in wait for word inside. Like that's a thing they do now. Wait.
would listen. Actually, probably didn't even care. Was probably just pissed cause he couldn't skip town as quick as he'd wanted to.
Physically- he's perfectly safe from the looks of it. However, completely uncharacteristically, Dean's
Still, though, Lucifer's motives have always been odd and difficult to understand. Sometimes he seems to have none at all. Good days and bad- in the most extreme way possible.
"Okay, okay- the road- road!" Sam urges, reluctantly releasing his hold on the wheel as Dean turns back around, "Dude, watch the road."
He's seen Dean go home with woman after woman after woman over the years. Sometimes leaving Cas at the bar alone, other times leaving both he and Sam. It wasn't... well, it hurt. There's no denying that. But he could shove that down. It was just something he had to live with. Still has to live with.
It's Cas who starts in more urgently, kissing Dean hard. Kissing Dean like he's probably wanted to kiss him for years. And Dean moans against him, grinding his hips against Cas until they fall against the side of the Impala. Cas ruts against Dean in response, and Dean's gripping Cas' hair fiercely with one hand, sliding the other behind Cas' back to cement chest against chest. Cas grunts at the movement and anchors Dean's body before swiftly turning on his heel and shoving Dean against the car. He unlocks their mouths to mark a fiery trail of kisses down Dean's jaw, all the way down the nape of his neck. His breath on Dean's skin sends chills down his entire body-- but true to a hunter's life, this all only lasts a moment- because something violently tears Cas' body off of Dean and he doesn't even have a fraction of a second to react before another body is on top of him, this one cold and full of fang.
came back. To you. In a world free of his command, do you not think I would do the same every time again?"
Dean reluctantly meets Cas' eye across the table, "Fine. You look good today. The whole..." he waves a hand down his figure with the skewed tie and the sex hair and the rolled up shirtsleeves, "Shirt."
”That's Cas speak for pretty good,” Dean says, giving Jody a thumbs up. “I’d say, seven out of ten. Not quite as good as buttered popcorn, but not as bad as lasagna.”
Dean abruptly pads back towards his father and stops halfway, reaching under the table in between two seats to unholster a small pistol from its hiding spot. It's only a six shooter but it'll do the job. He flips open the barrel, double checking it's still loaded, clicks it back in place.
An angel running an errand. Stipulations in a deal to keep the vessel? Cas is very familiar. He was terrible at keeping his own promise to Jimmy- he arguably completely failed at it. It's surprising that Lucifer would even
He tries the handle. Locked. He shakes it, pounding his shoulder against the wood but the thing barely budges.
Dean's halfway down the hall when he calls over his shoulder, "Jack, put on your shoes we're leaving in ten."
It's when Cas swallows dryly that Dean starts to move again, gently prodding his nose against Cas' and their lips just a breath apart. He brings his hand to lightly brush against Cas' neck, feeling the rise of goosebumps his fingertips cause.
"Come on." Dean says softly, grabbing Loraine's arm to tug her into the living room, "Sammy!" He yells, peering around the house.
"Come on, Crowley. The police took them." Cas says sharply, voice low below the rest of the din of voices throughout the diner, "You have people in the government. You have spies."
”You’ll prob’ly like may’le syrup. It’s na’ural. I ‘et the best kind the store’s got. No ar’ificial crap.” Dean pipes in, mouth full.
to confront John." He pauses, maybe waiting for Dean to argue, but when he doesn't, continues, "Your life... you're still greatly impacted by the way he raised and treated you. I'm certain there are things you had to do, or perhaps that John
Dean catches up to Sam and startles him with a shout and two hands slapping on the giant's shoulders. Sam swings around, braced for a fight before realizing it's only Dean wearing a shit-eating grin. "C'mon man!"
. Cas slides his hand up Dean's neck and threads his fingers into his hair, gripping the back of his head and tugging it again into the comfortable space beneath his chin. They could be kissing right now. They could be doing any number of things, but this is somehow more intimate than any of it. Just a man afraid to love, letting himself be held in his lover's arms. There's something sacred about that.
Kaia snorts a giggle into her own mug. Dean glares up at her but she just raises her eyebrows innocently.
He wants to say more but doesn't want to risk his activities with Lucifer and Crowley to come up just yet. That's a conversation for later, maybe before he and Crowley meet back up in the morning.
Dean raises his brows, "Who are you?" she just looks at him, so he turns to Sam- did Sam call this chick?
Cas, on the other hand, is the picture of surface-level peace. Leaning against the back wall, arms crossed, eyes intent on the floor.
"Dean." Sam calls, and Dean turns back, reacting just in time to catch the room key tossed his way, "You guys take the room. I know you're gonna wanna watch tv anyway, Cas is the only one that'll put up with it."
"And I love you." Cas beams, dropping his hand from Dean's face and picking up a piece of french toast. He takes a bite, quirking his face in concentration before he swallows, "This, however, I unfortunately do not"
"Yeah, me too." He says quietly, turning to the tape deck on the desk, pressing a button, and pulling out a tape. He holds it between his fingers, twirls it a few times there just staring at it.
Cas can only imagine what it is she's been through, though Rowena has always been one known to claw her way out of any seeming fatal situation. Even now- she's in one piece, not a heel broken, no hair out of place, or tear in her shiny suit.
In the pale moonlight, the fragmented bits of light scattering their way through the trees, he can't really make out the blue in those eyes this time. Which is a damn shame. He'd have liked to see those one last time, too.
Hell, there was one time he went two whole days stumbling around the same town without some idea who he was- dad really put him through the ringer on that one when he finally found him.
John lets himself get tugged along, whispers carrying through in their wake. He even hears Alicia stage-whisper, "
It hadn't escaped his attention that John pocketed the weapons, just as it hadn't escaped him that John realized the importance of the angel blade. Cas doesn't think that John will sink to such drastic measures as attempting to kill him without reason, but even so- he doesn't truly know the man, and even Dean seems wary of him at this point.
Even though he knows with every bone in his body that that look Cas is shooting his way, that resolved calm, he's screaming
He licks his lips, lets out a harsh breath, and takes in another, shaking his head, still trying to catch his breath, "Asa, he was just al- he was just always so stubborn. Look... we were in the woods... Jael, he- he was taunting him. Asa wanted to chase him, but he didn't have the angel blade. I said, 'let's go back.' He called me a coward and he shoved me, so I shoved him back, and he fell... and he hit his head. I didn't mean to do it, but... it was a mistake. An accident. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. Asa hated that damn demon so much that I just..."
Trying to piece together an existence with people and keep them around and rely on the fact that they’ll always be there? There’s no quick and painless way about that. Not like death where maybe it’s instant or maybe it takes a few minutes or a few hours, but no matter what you’ll get to the same finish line.
Sensing Dean is struggling, Cas drops his eyes to his lips and delicately reaches his hand to caress the corner of Dean's lip with a fingertip, moving on to trace the shape of his nose and up into his hair. Dean closes his eyes and just lets himself give in to being felt. Cas continues on, running his hands through Dean's hair until Dean dips his head down and breaks, snuggling closer to Cas, grappling his arm out blindly to grab onto Cas' shirt. The angel settles his chin on Dean's temple, running his hands down the back of Dean's head, over his neck, and back again.
his dad's gonna draw some fucking conclusions. Conclusions that don't exist. And won't ever exist. That's not- It's not-
"Are you-" Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off, slaps the angel on the shoulder in passing and heads directly to the driver's side.
And he keeps holding that dick's unfeeling gaze even as Cas glances Dean's direction, soaking in his words, then turns back to Ishim, "Why do his words bother you so much, Ishim?"
The bunker's quiet in the mornings. It's quiet most of the time, really, but when Dean's still sacked out the silence is especially noticeable.
"I'm saying maybe if we find her," Sam says delicately, "We can explain to her that you're different now, you know?"
"I'll bet." John raises a brow, leering at the demon across the booth, then glancing Cas’ way as well. Crowley simply smiles at him.
"Yeah, well, maybe..." Dean mutters. He tears his eyes away to look out at the landscape of buildings dotted around them, "Just, maybe someday you'll realize it's not. That it's not... the same way I mean it."
"Right. Okay. Alright." Sam blinks, clearing his throat, "If you're doing so well, uh, name all the members of Bon Jovi."
Sam's nervous- looking on at Dean with the soft puppy eyes of a little brother. Not a killer. It's all Dean can do not to mirror that look, because he's got a feeling that this time won't be like the last few behind bars.
"Stop!" The dark-haired man hollers, weapon raised and trained directly on the center of his chest. When Cas doesn't react, he shakes the gun firmly, "Don't move!"
Sam nods, slowly, breathing out a barely-there chuckle, "Figured it might... bring back a few things?"
Huh?" John yells, shoving Dean's chest right back with a rough palm, "Because I sure as shit didn't ask to be brought back, Dean. So what the hell is it I'm even doing here?
“Should’ve sent him to my house.” Jody pipes in, grinning, “I seem to be the resident orphan collector these days.”
Crowley holds up his phone, clears his throat and deepens his voice in poor imitation of Dean, "'My devilishly handsome friend, I've made such a poor error of judgement. Demons
"He'll ease up." He lets out a breath, trying for a change in subject, nodding to the whiteboard by the entrance, "Saw you've been pretty busy on other stuff, at least. Anything solid?"
Jack looks at him then, and tilts his head in a very Cas manner, squinting before he says boldly yet entirely cryptic, "I don't think you do."
Sam claps a hand on his shoulder and looks at him like he doesn't really believe that. Dean doesn't even believe it anymore. He's just saying things. Trying to get out of it. Trying not to feel this way. But Sam doesn't call him out on it, either. Not this time.
Dean can watch a gay cowboy movie while in bed with his best friend. Definitely. It won’t be weird at all.
"No, you didn't." She tilts her head, squinting curiously. "And you hate it. Look in your eyes, I've seen it before. It's a dead man's look- eyes that say no matter where you go or what you do, it feels like this world doesn't fit anymore, like you're all alone."
"No. Not somehow." Ishim says, brows scrunched together, "I know what she's up to. She made some kind of demonic pact. Keeps her young, keeps her strong. Keeps her immune from our powers."
Dean starts palming at Cas' trenchcoat curiously, unpracticed fingers grazing over its folds like it's something new to him. He chuckles, not even bothering to attempt knocking away Cas' palm from his forehead, "So many pockets."
Ten minutes later they're standing outside of a large white stone building, Cas leaning against the sign reading
"Very... sweet." Brow furrowed, he seems to deliberate before taking another bite and smiling, "Hmm." He nods.
"Hey, kiddo." John pulls Sam into a bearhug, his eyes closed and head stretched up over the kid's shoulder. Sam falls into it, reluctantly at first, then all at once. Maybe cause a hug like that's hard to refuse, especially today.
thinking, which of course makes me think more. It's very frustrating." He sighs, "I'm used to watching people sleep and they're always so vulnerable in that state. How is one supposed to simply fall asleep easily knowing their body will be dormant and defenseless for hours..."
Cas hit the road within thirty minutes of Dean's mind getting stitched up. Memories poured back in with all the softness of a red-hot poker closing up a gaping wound.
But they finally beat Chuck. Jack did, mostly. And now he says he might be able to save Cas. So Dean sits on the floor of the one place he swore he'd never step foot in again, waiting. This time with a dangerous flame of hope in his chest because Cas has come back every damn time before, and it seems beyond cruel of this universe to throw everything it has at Dean and leave this being the one time he can't get him back. Wouldn't that be the icing on the cake? God's dead? Check. Free-will? Check. Cas out of the empty? Now, hold your horses...
The doorbell chimes out, and Jody shouts from the next room that she's getting it. Dean'll have to hide some cash somewhere for her later to pay back for the amount of pizza he devours. He and Cas head back to the dining room just in time for Jack and Alex to show up and steal three pies for the basement dwellers, then retreat just as rapidly. That still leaves three more pies for the grown-ups table, and Dean starts scarfing down a slice of meat-lovers before Jody has to shove a plate in his face so he'll eat like a normal human being.
"Plus, I guess I just figured he was trying to get me to be nice since he's like totally in love with you or whatever." She chokes out a laugh, then meets his eye uneasily, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, "But you really did, huh?"
"Like it matters. What Lucifer made that woman do has got nothing to do with music. It's about devotion." Crowley taps his fingers on the table.
Sam and the twins putter on about the different types of devil's traps- not that any of it really matters, they all pretty much get the job done- so he doesn't pay much attention, busying himself with more candles and rifling through a small desk in the corner, hoping for hidden weapons.
Cas fiddles with the keys in his pocket, needing something to busy with, fidget, "He doesn't like me."
"Besides, I have a lot of downtime while you all sleep. After we broke you out of Michael's control, I read several dozen books along the topic of running a business. I've learned quite a bit." Cas just smiles at him like it's a passing thing. No big deal. Like it's not one of the most thoughtful things anyone has ever done. And he did it as a 'just in case.' In case Dean ever wanted to, or ever thought that maybe he
He didn't really think about it at the time, of course, but how many vehicles did they filter through that year? A couple? Dozens, maybe?
Dean ignores him, "So you're the damsel in distress, Sam's the loveable nerd, and I'm the idiot jock-"
"Geez, any of that actually make it into your mouth?" Claire laughs, pointing at Dean's mess of a face.
Magda turns to him, then, chains rattling at her arms, voice smaller than before, afraid, "He's inside me. I can hear him whispering. He lets me hear what people are thinking. He lets me do things."
Cas' eyes stick on him for awhile longer. He doesn't need to look over to confirm it. But, eventually, his breath evens out to a dull sigh, his hand resting on Dean's chest flattens out, limp.
Abraham looks between them. He seems an average enough guy, nearly bald, sporting a thick goatee and mustache, and donning the same types of slacks and button downs Sam or Dean might wear any day of the week.
That, at least, starts to get a reaction out of the guy. He raises his chin, barely sparing another glance at Dean, but frowning over to Cas as though Cas might shrink before his glare. As if it might have some power over him.
Crowley puts a hand on his chest again, feigning hurt, "Another stinging sentiment. And here I am, being
He never wants to bring Dean that kind of pain again... but it had been necessary, he'd thought, in ending the fight. In getting Amara away from Dean. In keeping both Winchesters, and the world, safe. He will
"No, I can take the kid." Dean chugs down a last gulp of coffee and slams the empty mug on the table.
He leaves his hand on Cas' knee. Cas leaves his hand wrapped around Dean's forearm. Somehow their bodies have closed the foot of space between them- like always, and they're pressed flush side by side.
It's Dean's turn to look away, face getting hot. He hears Sam starting to clang around in the kitchen, and knows he has to go save him from himself pretty quickly.
John twists the wedding band around his finger another several rotations, but neither break the silence again the final hour of the drive. Neither acknowledge the tension as they pull up to the bunker's door, either.
If anything, he’s not gonna let Sam go worrying- thinking this was one of the bad nights. This is just Dean, womanizer extraordinaire and resident idiot, having a night on the town well past his prime.
He stomps down the hall more aggressively than he really needs to. Voices carry from the kitchen but soften to whispers at his approach.
Sam stares intently down at the floor, eyes shifting in thought and foot tapping in tune with it. He looks at Dean, as if searching for an answer, but Dean just shakes his head, because he doesn't have one.
He can feel Cas' fingers clasped onto the back of his jumpsuit, the fabric stretching thin against his skin. It's not the same way he'd held Sam, that's for sure. And maybe that's cause of Dean's prayerful ramblings of a man steadily going mad. Maybe it's something else he won't get a chance to find out about.
Frustrated, though, Ishim rolls back down his shirt with an angry grunt, not looking Cas in the eye, "I'm fine."
But maybe she's right. Maybe he was never meant to work shit out right off the bat and fit things back into place the way they used to.
She snatches it back, "Ugh, here." there's a little funky-haired doll jutting out from her bag- so Rowena pulls it out, handing that over with a sharp needle, "Play with this, and I'll... tell you a story."
"Neither did Dean, back then. It was coming from a different place than dad, though. That's for sure."
No, there's no way. Cas can't lie worth a damn. He can try his damnest to evade, but even that's like trying to look a dog in the eye when they
"Hey," Sam says softly, planting a hand on Dean's shoulder, "You wanna set up your stereo in here? I can take over the chopping."
raise these two boys into the incredible men he holds so dear today. Surely some of that within them must be in John as well. After all, Cas and Dean didn't exactly get off to the best start all those years ago, either. Sometimes you simply have to jump in with trust and pray that you've made the correct decision.
"Dean-" Cas starts, but cuts himself off as Sam clomps into the room, slowing his steps at the clear fog of tension.
Ketch, however, stops Cas by his sleeve, "Do you have any idea what sort of trouble we're walking into?"
Cas shifts his gaze to Dean, who lets out a breath, noticing Cas so incredibly close at his side. His neck blotches in pink and he raises a hand to rub it.
Cas doesn't have time for niceties, so he elects to ignore the man and peers around instead, looking for any indication at all of his location. There's nothing but darkness and land stretching for miles in any one direction. He could still be in Kansas, but he could be in about any other state in the midwest, too. The billboard behind is no help either, a singed hole left where he clearly collided through it on his rough landing.
Thing is, John's bullshit meter can't be beat that easy. He knows there's more to it, and he'll be damned if he's just gonna sign on easy... but even so, these mooks don't hold much up for hunters in these parts. Thinking they're all redneck ruffians with enough brawn, sure, but only two brain cells scraping between them.
Dean turns from the kitchen without a second look back, but feels Sam close at his heels. Cas raises his head at their approach, Dean raising up a beer in tandem and placing it in front of the angel.
The father and son pick up their lanterns again, retreating out of the barn, finally leaving Sam to exit.
He lunges- knife out, blade slicing through the air. Dean manages to duck back last second, fending off the flying arm with his own forearm. He tries to grab hold of John's arm to twist the blade from his grasp, but John's too fast- he drops the blade, catching it with his less dominant hand, swiping out, grazing Dean's ribs in the process.
"I seriously doubt it," Cas cuts him off, "I've heard nothing from heaven since the fight with Amara. I get the sense they want little to do with us down here."
"But the more I took, the more I needed. And when I didn't get them..." She quirks a half smile, shrugging, once again grabbing the lemonade from the shelf.
Where his own dad's concerned... it's been two weeks since John hit the road. Dean's sent out a few texts. He's sure Sam has, too. Maybe he's even gotten a response. He hopes so, cause Dean hasn't. But that's alright, cause if Dad did respond he'd just tell Dean to grow up and deal with it like a man. Cause that's what men do. They just deal with shit. Shove it down and say it's not a problem cause, fuck, it's not.
John leans back with a snort, linking his hands on his stomach, "Ah, shoot 'em a story about faking your death and people run with it. They believe what they gotta."
Sam nods in thanks, staring down at the thing, finger tapping on the side of his beer like he's figuring out quite what to say.
"You watch too much Animal Planet.” Dean tightens his arms around his chest, not appreciating the comparison, and scoffs absently, “What would you know about that, anyway?"
"It's not a single act of righteousness. Selling your soul in exchange for the life of another, for instance. People have sold themselves for another's life for as long as deals have been made, it's nothing new. Nothing... special." Cas pauses, trying to find the right words. "It's the reason Dean was the righteous man- the one heaven needed- instead of you, or any others before you. It's built into the very being of that soul.
Dean can't help it, a cackle of laughter bubbles up from deep in his chest, and pretty soon he's clutching at his stomach wheezing for breath.
So, the truth. Dean slides his fingers down the length of his beer, letting the condensation collect across the pads of his fingertips, "Cas, I don't like how the whole Billie thing went down, okay? I know you think you were doing the right thing. And I'm not
Well there's his answer. Cas has got himself a hot new piece. That's why Dean got so trashed last night.
“Crowley is following a lead. I’m to meet him a couple states over in the morning.” He sits up, “My bigger concern is what we’re going to do about him once he
But that's not all that causes Cas to stiffen uncertainly beneath the touch- it's how Dean seems to be wrapped around him, one arm circled around his neck and palming the back of his head.
"What?" John peers at him, looking back at the building confused, "The Wicca'd witch of the west in there. Miss 'positive energy' wanted a bigger office, did some hoodoo, boom. I say we take her out tonight, call it a day."
The man in front of him has nothing remaining of the caring, loving father within those photos. The lines of a long life are scarred deep into his cheekbones, forehead a stern line as he takes in Castiel’s image with the same amount of wariness as Cas does his.
Cas steps toward the man, intent on his vehicle, and the man holds a hand out as if to stop him, "Wait, wait, wait, wait... Who... What are you, man?"
Hesitantly, Cas rises to his feet, kind of stumbling once his full weight is out of the chair. Dean catches him with a firm grip around his bicep, tugging to gently escort him towards the hall, and to his own bedroom door. He shoves Cas down on the bed where he bounces there a second, that signature confused tilt of the head slowly coming up.
Cas has always thought Mary might like that. Her son’s personal guardian angel always watching over him.
"That's it." Dean says, nodding, feeling his mind warping away, pieces flitting away- pieces that- maybe they're the most important parts of him and he doesn't- he doesn't know- "This is what nails me."
"Maybe." Wendy heads to the table behind her, opens a drawer and pulls out a small book, turning carefully to a page near the end and tearing it out. She hands it over- and points to the second address scrawled on the list, "That's his cabin. Couple hours north. He usually stops here before heading to it."
Sam points at Dean, still not moving his eyes from his father, “You tell him he might have to kill me, don’t even give him a reason. And you- you had one
When he was a kid he never saw it because... well, who knows? Maybe he needed that. The superhero. The guy that could do no wrong. The one to look up to.
Ishim sneers, flicking his eyes to Sam, to Dean, then Cas, looking him up and down, "No wings, no home. Just a ratty old coat and a pair of poorly trained monkeys."
It's decided on the drive that Castiel will travel to Aldrich, Missouri alone- where the last call came in from the dead woman's cell. John and Dean will stay behind at home and hit up their contacts, scrub through surveillance footage, and do anything they can remotely to track down who these people are and where they might've taken Sam. The why is still a mystery that hangs over their heads, but with little way of getting to the bottom of that- it gets shoved aside for now.
“You make the difficult choices so others don’t have to. We all do. Just like shielding your brother from the violence of your father’s work for as long as you could. You do it out of love and a desire to do right in the world, even if it has a cost.”
Cas' cheeks turn a light shade of pink, and he smiles at Dean so adoringly that Dean finds his own face getting hot.
This room, if any, reminds him of Bobby's. It feels like there's whiskey engrained in the wood-floors and more stories laid out in their worn treadings.
It's been awhile since Dean's actually talked like that. Like he sees himself as the hero instead of the guy just doing a job he's supposed to do cause he's put in too many years already to call it quits and walk away guilt-free.
More start gathering around the fire as it picks up, and probably because Jack starts passing out sticks to everyone so they can make s'mores too. They'd bought up the store's entire stock of marshmallows and chocolate this morning because Jack was convinced they needed to have enough to share with an entire army. Seems he was right, though.
"I'm not fluent by any means- our primary focus in heaven has been entirely on humanity for the most part, but some of us have picked up a thing or two in regards to the communication methods of Earth's other creatures. Humans wouldn't be able to understand them in the same ways that we can, of course..."
“This sounds like you.” Cas says finally, one side of his mouth quirking up a little higher, looking over to the record player.
"Even if Crowley does bring in Rowena," Cas says, "the problem remains, Lucifer can't be returned to the cage inside his vessel. His essence has to be extracted."
fucking know. As soon as you let your guard down... as soon as you start to think you might be able to have something just once... everything goes to shit. People die. And Dean is left burying the people he loves over and over and over again like some kind of demented twilight zone.
Settled in a mirror to Cas, one arm beneath his head and the other settled between them nearly touching Cas, Dean lets himself break free of his own prison of space, and graze his fingertips over Cas' cheek. He doesn't look at Cas' eyes watching him, but knows they are. Instead, he watches the impact of his own touch on Cas. The parting of his lips, the catching of breath, the chills on the hairs of his neck. And Dean watches all that, while preparing all that he has to say next.
The next couple chapters will take a bit of time bc I’ve barely started the Lily Sunder chapter outside of a couple of small scenes. And Regarding Dean I wanna make sure I get right, though I do have quite a bit of that one done already.
to keep such a promise when he's not held to the same sort of contracts as a demon would be. Angels can neg out on their deals as they see fit. As long as the vessel says yes, that's the only rule that matters, honestly. It’s a disturbing con on a person’s life. An illusion to kept free will, when really it's more of the same trickery that demons hand out, just in shiner packaging.
"We're gonna sit you down right here." Sam separates them anyway, tugging him to the bed, shoving his ass down on the corner of it, "Uh, yeah, go ahead, um..."
"Monsters still care. They care a lot. Makes some even easier to catch," John purses his lips, nods over at Dean's approaching figure, "For you? It’s that boy. Only reason you're still sitting here. You'll do anything he'll ask. Hell if I know why. Don't mean I trust you. Don’t mean you’re any better for it. Don't mean I won't get rid of you first chance I've gotta."
As soon as Dean's boots touch down, Sam barrels forward, arms locking around Dean's shoulders and nearly knocking the both of them over.
Sam stays silent- it's not that he's not glad his dad trusts his instinct, but this just isn't the way things go. Sam and Dean might bicker, but end of the day they respect the other's side of things.
Dean straightens, tapping the missing pieces in place. John... did the job. The way he always taught them to do it in a black and white world.
"I, ah, I oughta get back to the party." Dean's voice comes out harder than he wants it to be, so he clears his throat.
He pulls aside another branch giving way to a bit of clearing in the brush when he hears his voice- and tumbles forward at the sound, feet stuttering to a stop.
We really wanna hash out old shit, or can we have a meal for once in our lives without jumping down each others’ throats?”
He ducks before Dean's fist can even swing down, charging forward with arms outstretched to grapple around his son’s middle. Dean tumbles ass-first to the pavement, head connecting with a
"If I plan to do anything else stupid," Cas tilts his head, locking eyes with Dean, tone dripping with bitterness, "I'll let you know."
Cas doesn't glance at a single person in the room, only crossing the lobby with a stiff gait, and sinking into the last open chair- directly across from Dean. He can feel their eyes on him, but doesn't acknowledge the stares until Dean swings his arms wide, brows raised expectantly, "Anything?"
showering Cas with small touches through the day. Touches that had been built up over a decade of longing and
Dean was different, even outside of heaven's role for him. The inherent cruelty of his life often tempered his kindness, hid away his goodness in a way that made Castiel realize that Dean thought so little of himself that he actively tried to get people not to see it.
But no, that can’t be it. It’s a moment of respite, because John’s not looking at them-instead focusing his entire attention on Crowley. Maybe it’s Dean letting the mask slip momentarily, even if by accident, because things really aren’t as fine with his father as he’d like to lead everyone to believe.
"Nice?" Cas scowls, squinting at him, trying very hard not to smite him where he stands, "You started this conversation taunting me with your sexual conquests with Dean-"
"Is this just..." Cas starts, licking his lips to break the tension of his own words, "Dean is this just a... physical sensation for you-"
"Even batman doesn't bring chicks to the bat cave." He winks, then realizes he's tilted his chair back too far and fumbles, jolting back towards the table, "Nah, been a dry spell for awhile, I guess."
It's just one thing after another after another in their stupid, fucked up lives. The world will be safe because it has him, and it has Sam? Well that's bull. Where's their safety? Where's their peace and quiet?
"Forget it." Dean takes a sip from his coffee cup, but it's been empty for awhile now. He scowls down at it and sets it down hard, eyes focusing out the window instead, "You're right. It doesn't matter... Anything Charlie would kick my ass for probably just means I'm being a dick."
Crowley stops, face stone, for once- all amusement drained to the fiery held beneath, "It's not about
He shakes his head, glaring at the building. Just because Sam's angling for a famous 'Sam and Dean feelings hour' at the worst possible time, doesn't mean he's gonna get one.
The man hands it back and Dean raises his brows for half a second. He takes a sip, nodding in approval when it's actually not half-bad, "That's good."
He lands another hit, then shoves Cas back into the ground- where he stays, unmoving. Ishim towers over him.
”Yeah, you should be! Tonight’s not gonna be a typical show. Tonight you’re gonna see and feel things you never saw or felt before…” He drawls out the words with a thirst, eyes grazing over the crowd, the possibilities before him clearly turning over and over in his mind, “Things might get a little bit messy.”
"Why don't you go grab a few hours, too?" He picks up their empties, getting up to deposit them in the sink. When Cas doesn't move, he crosses his arms, hip against the counter, "Come on, man. You had a pretty tough one today, no one's judging if you grab yourself a cat nap- get back to a hundred percent. Happens to all-"
Sam looks over at him, but Dean doesn't meet his eye, instead staring ahead at the trees, waiting for them to part so they can both just
"I don't-" but apparently no one really cares about the lie that Dean doesn't look at Cas any certain way.
Cas flew to him immediately, thinking something had gotten to him. That maybe he was dying. That despite his best efforts, the leviathan tracked him down anyway.
Jesus Christ, if he could ever delete a single sentence from ever having passed through his brain, that’d be it. Accuracy of the comparison be damned.
His eyes rove over the diner's patrons in an instant: Couple to the right by the window. Guy alone at the bartop. Waitress headed to the kitchen. Then, seated at a table to the far left, he sees Cas across the booth from another man, a woman standing at the end of the table and peering down at him. All three react to the sound of the bell, and stare at the brothers as they stomp forward.
Miriam's splayed out, ashen wings barely spanned into the light of the street. Ishim, beside her, is alive but a little worse for wear, cupping a hand over a wound at his side- blood seeping through his fingers.
Sam starts for the kitchen to join the others, but Dean tugs him back gently by the arm. He meets Sam's eye, seeming to build up to something.
"Yep. Yeah." He pauses, shifting in his seat, maybe to lay down because there's a lot of grunting and vinyl seats scraping beneath skin involved, "How's the hunt for the devil?"
Dean tears his eyes away and stares down at the counter again, latching his focus on a stray droplet of condensation.
Their boots clank in tandem up the metal stairs and out the front entrance. Cas' stolen brown pickup sits where he left it, abandoned with the door half ajar, having rolled several feet into the grass. The smaller sedan Dean and his father must have stolen sits right beside it, parked far more gracefully.
lore books, scribbled up notebooks, blades fashioned from different parts of creatures and metals... this guy didn't play around.
"Girl's got a natural talent. Uses that kitchen more than I do." Jody says, handing off a glass to Claire and ruffling her hair in the same movement.
Cas snags another beer from the fridge as well, leaning up against the other side of the island. He peels at the paper label on the bottle anxiously before finally opening his mouth, "Sam is quitting hunting."
But Cas does make Dean happy, too. Maybe that alone is enough for right now and he can figure out the rest later.
Dean half expected Cas to try and tag along on their little grocery trip despite the lack of invite, but he didn't. So it's just Jack and Dean standing outside of the marketplace as the poor teenager tasked with opening the store unlocks the front doors for them. Why they had to come to the store when the sun is barely up is no one's fault but Dean's. He could have planned for later today, or even just tossed Cas the keys and a credit card and told him to go nuts. But nope, he made his bed and was lying in it.
