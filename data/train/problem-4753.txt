He thought he’d snuck out undetected, but his father was a light sleeper, and any sound alerted him; Dean shouldn’t have assumed he could outsmart him.
It hurt so much and there was only one person he wanted, only one person who could ease his pain.
Cas, drove a dagger into Dean’s already destroyed heart.
As it turned out, being away from Dean was torture too. He tried to hunt and save people and do mundane activities, like fishing, but doing those things without Dean didn’t seem worth it. And when he returned to the bunker to help get rid of Chuck, he knew he wasn’t going to leave again.
“I said no,” Cas snapped. “There’s no way out of it this time, Dean. You know what you have to do.”
When he stepped outside, the world seemed to stop. There were no sounds of creatures scuffling among leaves, no calls of birds, no rustle of branches as the trees talked to each other. Everything was quiet, as if the planet were holding its breath, waiting.
Another writing request on my
Dean turned the water on as his tears dripped into the sink, and he slowly began to scrub himself clean from the damage his father had inflicted on him. He wrapped his broken rib with medical tape and an ace bandage and deemed himself cleaned up enough. But, clean to the outside eye as he might appear, his insides still squirmed from wounds that would never heal, they would bleed and pulse forever, unable to be sutured.
The one thing that Castiel had never been able to comprehend, the one thing that troubled him more than anything else, was the one thing he had not been prepared for.
“I know,” Dean choked out as he reached for the door so he could pull it closed, shutting out Sam’s protests.
Part of him wished that Heaven was as it had been in his last visit, it would be so much less painful. For everything was nearly perfect, there was just one thing missing. The most important thing.
As Dean moved behind a tree, eyes fixed on the lights coming from the back porch of the farmhouse, he heard rusting behind him and turned to see the glowing eyes of the beast. Dean reached for his shotgun and pulled the trigger. The shot hit the chupacabra and it yelped, but the wound wasn’t fatal.
Dean shrugged. He wasn’t sure why he didn’t want Sam to know yet, he knew he’d be supportive, Sam loved Cas like a brother and he wanted Dean to be happy, but there was something holding him back, some fear ingrained so deep inside of him that he couldn’t just push it aside.
Cas smiled fondly at him. “If that’s what you want.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “I’m not kissing you while you’re this drugged up.”
Finally, Dean gave in.
“Nightmares I can help with,” Cas said as his hand came to clasp around Dean’s wrist, long fingers clamping over his skin. “Come on.”
Life seemed pointless without Cas. Sam did his best to cheer him up, but he didn’t know what had happened and Dean would never give him the full picture. So when Dean saw a chance during that vamp hunt, to end it all, he took it.
“We wouldn’t dream of it,” Jody replied.
“Dean!” Sam’s muffled voice reached Dean’s ears but he paid his brother no mind.
Cas smiled, nodding.
The longer he walked, the more his head began to hurt and his dry mouth called for something other than water. Eventually, he had to let his exhaustion drag him to the ground, where he sat under a tree, head leaning against the sharp bark, eyes fixed towards the gloomy sky.
Seeing him again, made guilt burn in his veins, like he’d somehow betrayed someone he’d never even been with.
When night came, Dean didn’t even care to think about where he was stopping for the night, he didn’t survey the area or check for sleeping monsters, he just fell to the ground.
“Hiya!” Donna answers, chipper as ever.
Dean only blinked at him slowly, trying to ignore the pain. Cas ran a hand through Dean’s sweat and blood soaked hair, gently raking his fingers against his scalp. Dean shut his eyes and hummed in content at the feeling, and then Cas’s lips were on his and a warm wave of grace washed over him. His wounds closed, the pounding in his bruised head ceased its drumming, and the pain slipped away as easily as it had come.
“You don’t need to, Sam’s always got my back, and then I get to come home to you.” Dean smiled as he gently cupped the side of Cas’s face.
The meadow was beautiful.
Cas pressed a kiss to Dean’s forehead and reached for Dean’s hand. “I understand, I just think he deserves to know.”
Dean sighed and pushed himself up into a sitting position. “How can you think that things caused by pain and suffering are beautiful? All my scars do are remind of times I’ve failed.”
But there was always a voice in the back of his head, whispering one name over and over again: CasCasCas.
It was clear his mind was still focused on Jessica and Dean knew he wouldn’t be going to bed any time soon when his thoughts were still so occupied with her. He couldn’t help but feel sad for Sam. He’d loved Jess, that much was clear, and he’d wanted out of the life, but Dean had dragged him back; he still wasn’t certain that that had been the right thing to do, after all he was partly to blame for Jess’s death, if he hadn’t pulled Sam away, he’d have been there to prevent whatever burned her on the ceiling from doing so in the first place. But there was nothing Dean could do to heal a broken heart, all he could do was help Sam avenge Jessica and their Mom.
Cleaning up is easier said than done but they manage to dispose of the bodies and cover their tracks, the two of them packing up the Impala and making the short drive back to the bunker.  Luckily the hunt was fairly local, Dean is desperate for a shower since every part of him is sticky with blood and dirt. He’s going to have to detail the car after this, too, he and Sam are making a mess of the leather seat.  Not to mention the
problem?”
“Fuck off, asshole,” Dean shouts.  Sam walks off with a laugh, and Dean looks down at Cas.  “Guess our moment’s over?”
“Alright, well your fancy muscle car won’t do you any good out in these woods, so I’ve got a four-wheel drive jeep set up for you.”  Bobby washes his hands at the sink, his scent thoughtful.
"Don't logic me, Cas."
please, need it, want it.” Dean is repeating it over and over and Cas finally pulls his hand away, yelling in surprise as Dean flips around and manhandles him up against the head of the bed. Cas’ as yet neglected cock is so hard it’s standing straight up, and Dean doesn’t hesitate to crawl into Cas’ lap and drop down on it, impaling himself with a loud groan.
“People are going to be skeptical, nervous,” Dean points out.
Cas starts to move with intention, long deliberate thrusts that steal Dean’s breath, quickly picking up speed so Dean never gets it back.  Cas’ words devolve into variations on
“We’re boarding two horses right now, so no Moondor parties for a while.”
“The hell do you want, it’s 3:30 in the morning,” he grouses.
“Bobby said he helped Jack rebuild this place, and I can’t- I need to see him, Sam.”
“Dean, are you sure you want to go see everyone when you-“
, she couldn’t deal with my condition.  She refused to see it, distanced herself from me, basically treated me like I was invisible.  She refused to acknowledge that her perfect image of her perfect alpha son was anything but, well, perfect.  I didn't get on scent suppressors till I was 18 and could get them myself.”
“Cas, I get it.”  Cas’ gaze narrows but Dean keeps talking.  “You’re not the only one who’s afraid.” They hang in the silence for a moment, blood dripping down Dean’s chin as Cas’ eyes bore into him.  “We knew going into this, Cas. It’s part of the whole package.” Cas’ eyes drop to Dean’s mouth, his hand rising to draw his bloody thumb across Dean’s lip.
“Awesome Cas.  I know how I want to do this.”  Cas nods and sits down, taking a small bite of his dinner. Dean tells him everything, and while they eat they go over contingencies and worst case scenarios.  In the end, it just might work, and Cas can tell Dean is eager to get back to Sam and fill him in.
“Maybe.”  Jack closes his eyes, well, the form he takes in Heaven closes its eyes.  He traverses down the path of Sam and Dean Winchester, intricate webs of choices and branches they can take flowing in smaller or larger lines from a point until it forms a large fork- one direction lay a continuing life of hunting, the other the life they would have if they stopped.  “Although I can’t interfere, as their family I hope that they choose to stop.  That road has a much gentler ending.”  He turns to his companion, a form he knew so well on Earth and once again manifested here in Heaven.  “Do you miss them?”
Dean’s stomach drops into his feet as Cas slowly hands him the papers, an unreadable expression on his face.  The fact that he was Jack’s teacher surged to the forefront of his mind, and he feels utterly stupid for even thinking Cas would see him as anything
“What do you do for a living?” Cas finally asks.  Dean shrugs, a small shy tilt to his head and
“Yeah,” Dean smiles.  “When school is going on I don’t get a lot of time to myself.”
“Yes, well your dumb ass is lucky they never figured out where we went.”  The man walks up to within four feet of them, squaring his shoulders. Cas finds himself standing between him and Dean, his own shoulders back and hackles raising.
“Dean, what-”  Dean’s scenting him, strong inhales through his nose and hot exhales from his mouth across Cas’ skin.  Something needy bursts into his scent that makes Cas' heart melt. “What are you doing?” Cas’ voice is breathy, but he blames it on how Dean is squeezing the life out of him.
“Makin’ a mess of these pants.”  Dean’s voice trembles in spite of his sass and Cas is quick to unfasten Dean’s jeans.  Dean leans back on his hands so he can lift his hips high enough for Cas to slide the jeans and his boxer briefs down and off. He tosses the damp material towards their shirts, his breath coming in thick pants as the now unmuted scent of Dean’s slick hits the air.  Dean catches his eyes, his pupils blown wide and a flush on his cheeks. “What’cha want, Cas?” A myriad of images and fantasies explode into his mind, but when he opens his mouth only one thing comes out.
“Yep, gonna change the fucking world.”
“You’re so reckless,” Cas growls.  Warmth spreads from Cas’ touch and Dean knows he’s healing the wound but from the pain that lingers when Cas’ hand moves away he knows he isn’t finished.  He simply stopped the bleeding. Cas’ hand, now slick with Dean’s blood, slides over his abdomen and the bruises there. This shouldn’t be so fucking
“You deserved to hear those words at least once, too,” she says as she signs.  “You’re a good man, Dean, and Castiel may be gone but for a moment you made him
“Well you’re gonna need help cleaning that before it gets infected,” she insists.  “Come on, infirmary.” Sam sends Dean a pleading look as Mary leads him down the hallway by his good arm, but Dean just shrugs with a chuckle as Sam turns the corner.  Jack is still sitting at the table watching everything, and now he’s looking at Dean curiously.
He’s soaked in blood from head to waist,
It’s a quiet day, the sun is up, the breeze is light, and the sound of birds chirping in the trees lends a peaceful atmosphere to the little park bench Sam finds himself sitting on.
“No, but I bet I still have to get out of the car,” Cas sighs.  Dean grins, reaching over to squeeze his hand before popping his seat belt.  Cas climbs out of the car after him, stretching his sore back and legs as they approach the gate.
“You can call me Cas, everyone does,” he mumbles, taking a step back and dropping onto the porch swing.
“What’s on your mind?” Dean asks.
“So you buying that crappy Honda whatever, which I told you not to buy in the first place, is suddenly
“Even after what he said?”  Jack’s question brings a subtle melancholy to Castiel’s face.  Not pain, exactly, there’s too much warmth for that.  Perhaps it is the subtle grief for what could have been, or maybe the warm memory of what already was.
“I love you, my omega.”  Dean surges forward and kisses him, hands that were clutching his face now giving his hair sharp tugs. Cas’ arms wrap around Dean and pull him close, until their bodies are pressed together shoulders to thighs. Cas can feel it all coming to a head now, the worry and the pain from their three weeks apart bursting out of them in hard presses of lips and sweeps of tongue.  Cas’ heart is about to burst from his chest it’s beating so hard, and every breath is an intoxicating dose of
“Hush, I need it, okay?” she grouses.  Cas’ purpose hits him again and Charlie frowns in concern as his face falls.  “What’s going on?”
“Cas- as in he’s here?“
“Don’t argue with me, Winchester, you know you care about him.”  Dean scowls but he has to admit she has a point. “And anyway, if there had been another problem I was going to give you some pointers on contacting Jack’s dad.  You know, the one you haven’t been able to stop talking about?”
The change isn’t instant, but gradually, like the warm liquid feeling that flowed into and through him, he feels almost the opposite.  It's like he’s pouring something into Dean from where his teeth have broken skin. And then he
.  She smiles, catching her lower lip between her teeth before leaning forward to kiss Sam again.  Sam cups her face with his hands, fingers brushing her hair and it’s enough, right now is enough.
“Sounds like Cas.”
“Back at you,” Cas huffs, and Dean rolls his eyes at Cas' attempt to make it about him.  “I will, but… not right now.” Dean’s worried, Cas can scent it, but he seems to let it go, laying back down and tucking Cas close.  Dean’s grip is tight, possessive, and Cas finds he likes being possessed.
Dean’s getting too old for this shit.
“You're her son.  I may have hated my dad for some of the things he'd do, but at least I knew he did them because he cared too much.”  Cas stands, walking over to Dean and placing a hand on his forearm where it's folded against his chest. Risking crossing a line, Cas taps into his overactive instincts.  He tries to use his alpha pheromones to calm Dean, to sooth the emotions he’s worked up in the other man.
“My name is Dean,” the man says, offering his hand to shake.  Cas barely grips his hand before pulling his own back from the warmth of Dean’s.
Cas takes a deep breath and tries to think, his brain focusing on the sleeping baby in his memory and the sleeping teen in his living room.
“After everything,
“Us, he had us,” Sam corrects him.  “You, me, Cas…”. He stops talking but the word is out there, hanging between the two of them.  It’s silent in the kitchen as he finishes wrapping Dean’s hand, Sam arguing back and forth with himself until finally he decides he doesn’t want to wait for answers anymore.  “Dean, what happened?”  Dean takes his hand back when Sam is finished, running his other set of fingers over the bandage as Sam watches and waits for his brother to make up his mind.  When Dean finally does start talking, his tone is quiet, a kind of wistful sadness Sam’s not used to.
“How was your drive?” Sam asks, fumbling through the signs as best as he remembers.
“You have the weirdest freakin love life Sam, I swear to God- well, Jack?”  Dean shakes his head.  “You know what? I’m never using that phrase again but I stand by my point.”  Sam laughs, and it’s enough to bring a smile to Dean’s face too.
Finding out that Cas is here in heaven somewhere sets Dean on a rambling journey through a million different questions.
“Leave it to you to laugh at people’s pain.”
Dean’s knees almost buckle, hearing his voice again, hearing his name said with that same inflection.  He turns and there’s Cas, standing by the trunk of the Impala, still in the goddamn trench coat.  The only discernible difference Dean can see is that he looks lighter, both in a sense of not carrying a burden anymore but also in that he has an almost… well a weird aura around his edges.
radiating off the both of them, but Cas is no longer embarrassed.  He guides Dean to sit on the bed, shivering when Dean leans forward to press a kiss to his belly.
Oh, right.  He has a house guest.
After two cups of coffee and two donuts, Dean has effectively claimed one of the tables as his own, still fairly close to the coffee pot incase he needs a third cup.  It’s an hour past when Sam’s shift was supposed to end and Dean’s grateful he had the presence of mind to grab his bag when he left the house half conscious. He’s going over his upcoming lesson plans and trying to figure out what’s going to be on his midterm when he senses a presence walking up to his table.
“Taking classes?” Cas wonders.
Thank you so much for reading and commenting I appreciate it so much <3
“So why'd you quit your job?” he asks, hoping to divert the conversation into something else, anything else.  Dean’s eyes narrow a bit, but he accepts the change of subject.
“Stupid?  Crazy? Cocky?”  Dean offers with a wink.  Cas’ face is still angry but his hands relax, and Dean knows he won this round.  Who knew an angel would be this susceptible to Dean’s flirty charm? Dean sure as hell didn’t.  Castiel’s eyes soften just a little, and with a deep breath he seems to come to a decision.
“Wow, traffic in the city must be fucking hideous,” Cas chuckles.
“It’s fine, Cas, just don’t kiss me again and it’ll chill out by the time we get there,” Dean grumbles, adjusting his pants with an embarrassed huff.  They fall into step together back down the path, and Dean’s never been a hand holding guy but when Cas’ fingers interlock with his he doesn’t ever want to let go.
Cas knows tensions are high, he can scent it off everyone in the room, including himself, but they’re doing something about it.  They’ve got purpose, he has Dean, and his family is safe. Optimism he isn't used to feeling fills his chest with warmth.
“You really still want that, with me?”
“Well I'll be out of your hair shortly,” Dean reassures him.  Cas nods, feeling super awkward and inadequate next to this gorgeous man.  He can't even tell if he's an alpha or a beta, with no scent to go by. Not that it should matter, Cas reasons with himself.  It's not like anything is going to happen in the five minutes it takes to charge his phone.
Cas gives him a break to breathe, pulling back to meet Dean’s eyes.  His white shirt is now covered in red splotches, his face too around his lips, and when his lips part slightly Dean can see some in his mouth.  Dean’s heart is racing, adrenaline pumping hard as Cas’ tongue darts out across his own lip to wipe up a drop of Dean’s fresh blood. The coppery taste tingles on Dean’s lips, his tongue mirroring Cas’ motion and Dean watches as Cas’ eyes darken further.  Cas is still tense, a tightly coiled mass of muscle that can literally crush Dean into dust. Yet for all his talk of humans being fragile, what he sees in Cas’ eyes shows him that his angel is just as ready to break.
“Yes, Dean.  It’s good to see you again.”  Cas flashes back to Dean’s childhood friend, the omega girl he’d met in the woods.
“Sadly, I have to get home, otherwise I’d take you up on that offer.”  The man raises an eyebrow at Dean as he passed by on the way to the coffee pot. He was wearing scrubs and an ID badge and Dean’s brain starts to stumble over itself when he recognizes the tufts of dark hair and the blue eyes.
“Where’s the bathroom?” Dean asks, and Cas points further down the hall.
“Mr. Milton?!” he blurts.
“Humans for all their wonderful details and emotional intricacies are creatures of habit by nature.  Even if they know they can live however and wherever they want, sometimes all they want is the comfort they know.  And sometimes that’s not a bad thing at all,” Cas smiles.  He waves at a table of people, some of whom Jack recognizes from photos back on Earth, and others he recognizes by virtue of who he is now.  “Come on,” Cas says, placing a gentle hand on Jack’s shoulder and leading him out into the sunlight.  “We’ve got some work to do.”
.  He needed to hear those words, Sam, at least once in his fucking life he should have heard someone loved him.”  Dean gasps for air.  “I should have told him I loved him, too.”  Sam doesn’t have words, he can’t console his brother with false platitudes and reassurances, so he pushes himself to his feet and just wraps Dean up in a hug.  Dean’s grip is crushing in its intensity but Sam doesn’t flinch, and he doesn’t let go until Dean begins to move away.
”  Cas has moved to Dean’s nipples, exploring with his tongue and a little bit of suction, just how he knows Dean loves it.
“Hmm… Cas?”  Dean’s wrapped around him from behind, legs and arms holding him close in a, quite literally, warm embrace.  Cas’ dreaming must have woken him too. “S’matter?” Cas takes a deep breath, taking in his mate’s scent and letting it out slow.  He repeats a few times till his scent is back to normal and the nightmare recedes.
“I prefer it.” Cas keeps his eyes focused on his sandwich as he keeps talking.  “I have hyperosmia." Dean doesn't say anything, so Cas keeps talking to fill the silence.  “Most people don't know, only a handful of my closest friends and family. Because of it, I need to be out here alone.”  Dean’s scent changes, but not how he expects. Cas reads the subtle curiosity and concern, but they're muted underneath overwhelming empathy.  He expected the other emotions, but empathy was totally new.
“I could have gone with you,” he says, but she shakes her head.
“Cut it out, you flirt,” he laughs, rubbing her neck, her auburn coloring shining in the orange light of the sunset.  Once she’s secure, he moves to secure the second stall. “Oh, so we’re pouting today?” Cas laughs. The mare, Amelia, has her back to Cas, and she turns her face towards him for a moment before turning back haughtily.  “Be that way,” he hums, walking to the fence and climbing over. Finished with the horses, Cas makes his way towards the front of the house where the chicken coop is waiting. He checks the fencing, their feed, and gathers up the stragglers that fell asleep out in the grass instead of the coop.   Cas checks on the rooster in his separate pen, making sure he's secure for the night, too.
The video ends with another saccharine grin from the woman and Cas groans as he shuts it off.
“Sorry, Cas.  I guess I got a little carried away,” Dean murmurs after a while, both of their scents returning to normal.  Cas removes his hand, his fingers warm where they were pressed against Dean’s skin.
“Yeah, for a bit.  Your weird blood kink kinda wore me out.”  Dean rolls into his side, tucking himself around Cas as the big spoon.
“They could have at least picked an actor with more… personality.”
“Must be lonely.”  Dean’s scent shifts into pity, and Cas shakes his head.  He doesn’t want pity, especially not from Dean.
“I need you to tell me it's a bad idea to remote hack into Dick’s computer and make his desktop a picture of a dildo.”
“Last door on the right, the bedroom will be across the hall,” he explains.
“Well, it wouldn't be the first time.”  Dean shrugs like it's okay to stuff himself in the backseat of a car for eight hours.
“It helps me relax,” Sam bristles, his worry manifesting as anger in his scent.  “And it never hurts to be too prepared.”
“I wasn’t!”
“I’m Cas." Okay very intimidated, Jessica’s whole demeanor is a force to be reckoned with, and he finds he wants to drop his head in submission.  He manages not to at least, and Dean smirks at him when Jessica releases his hand.
Cas’ face in that moment shows more emotion than Dean’s ever seen him show the whole time he’s known him.  Without hesitating Dean wraps Cas in a hug, awkward as the angle is sitting next to him on the bench.  It’s the truth Dean kept coming back to, that no matter how much he kids himself, or he tries to ignore it, he belonged to Cas some time ago.  It just took losing him to realize it.
“Wait, you fix cars?” Cas blurts.
"Thanks, Cas."  There's something soft in Dean's voice that Cas is going to force himself to ignore.  Dean refills his water and sets it on the table while he washes the engine grime off his hands and lower arms.  Hoping to distract himself from Dean's flexing, Cas scrambles to gather sandwich ingredients and piles them on the counter.
"You mean like, everyone?  All alphas and omegas?" Cas asks.
“I could fix that, one last time.”  Castiel takes a breath, resting a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
“Working, huh, then why do you sound so spacey?” she asks, curiosity in her voice.
"I'm gonna- I'll be right back."  Cas is still wearing his work clothes, stained and smelling like horses.  Dean was probably poking fun, taking advantage of Cas’ obvious embarrassment.  He pours himself a mug of water, popping a tea bag inside and shoving it in the microwave with surprising force.  As the tea heats, he forces himself to breathe deep and slow, regaining his composure while he can. The microwave pings and Cas grabs the mug; taking in the calming smell of his mint tea, he braces himself and walks back outside.  Dean is on his phone, bent over in an awkward position since it's still plugged in. Cas makes himself look away from the slip of skin exposed by the tail of Dean's shirt riding up. He sips at his tea, the scalding liquid a welcome distraction.
“You look like a character in a bad slasher movie.”  Sam’s worried but there’s a laugh in his voice.
“Not direct contact, but I have been keeping tabs on them.”  She smiles at Cas, her scent reassuring. “Gabe’s farm is being watched by a neighbor, and it seems that officials have no idea where he’s disappeared to.  Michael has gone on a sabbatical and cannot be reached by anyone. From what communications I’ve hacked into, security forces are very frustrated that some ‘hick and pencil pusher’ have eluded them.”  Cas smiles, relaxing as his relief floods the room. “I’m working on the slow and safe way to contact the Omega group in Southeast, but bet you dollars to donuts they’re helping hide them.”
“Why would they bring the alpha back here though?  If they have a life outside the settlement?" Dean's question seems casual enough but Cas can scent the weight of it in his scent.  The meaning behind it.
“So, what, we’re supposed to bond over how crappy a student you were, too?”  Jack’s scowl is back, the moment of vulnerability lost. “If you’re going to feed me some stupid crap about how you ‘turned out okay’, I’ll pass.”  Jack turned for the door.
“So, you and Eileen, picking up where you left off?”  Sam shrugs, keeping his eyes focused on his brother’s hand.
“No, no I am not.”  Dean walks over to Cas, the two of them heading off on foot along the tree line.  “I’m not sure what the Empty’s plans for me were, but not long after I arrived Jack showed up and offered to put it back to sleep.  I’m not sure if it was Jack’s power, or maybe just exhaustion, but it agreed, and Jack brought me home.”
“Later, Charlie.”
“Gah, I didn’t really mean to just unload on you like this, I guess it just kinda came out.”  There’s a quiet pause and Dean snorts a small laugh.  Sam tries not to but he smiles and chuckles a little too, and Eileen grins and starts to laugh and for a few moments the three of them just chuckle at Dean’s accidental pun, that small dose of healing that only family and time can provide.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dean,” he says, and Dean laughs.
“Actually, uh, she,” Sam clears his throat, and Dean immediately regrets asking, “she died about five years after you did.  Oddly enough from cancer, something completely and totally normal.”
“It’s pretty awesome, I don’t deny it,” Dean says, gesturing at the nature around them.  The path they’re walking gives way to a small field, wildflowers in bloom all around and a lake in the middle, a small cabin sitting right in the center of the picturesque little image.  The sun is glinting off the water, giving the place an almost ethereal glow.  “Did we stumble into Thomas Kinkade’s heaven?” Dean wonders, blinking at all the color attacking his irises.
Cas ends his night the same way he always does- lounging on the porch swing with the cats.  He's stroking Bagheera fondly where he sits on the swing next to him purring. Sher Khan, the orange cat, lays sprawled out on the porch in front of Cas, the occasional twitch of his tail knocking against Cas’ foot.
“If you two are done being disgusting, we’ve got some food waiting in the kitchen,” Sam calls.  There’s a laugh in his voice that Dean finds irritating.
in bright red ink clearly visible.
Bagheera pokes his head out of his cat house, and Dean kneels down to greet him.
“I realize that my words on our parting have caused you some pain.”
“You sure you’ll be okay?” Gabriel asks for the 300th time this morning.  Castiel sighs into his coffee, burying his nose in the steam to help mask the scent of his cousin’s concern.  He loves his cousin, and he enjoys living with him, but sometimes the beta could very easily test his patience.
it, his back arching off the bed as Cas finally reaches down and wraps his hand around Dean’s cock.  His grip is tight and Dean’s helpless, shaking under the weight of the orgasm barreling down on him. “Cas!
but it was a gmail account
“Yeah, well, I know you okay.”  A woman smiles at the camera, explaining in her exaggerated perky voice a piece of the country’s history.  The overlaid images and videos are Charlie’s selection, and if Cas is honest that's the video's only saving grace.
“Decided you waited long enough?”
“And you agreed when I told you that you’d need some backup.  For which I offered my services.”
“Charlie, you and your LARPing friends-”
“I know,” she laughs.  “What do you expect from a government commission?”
The two of them share the rest of their coffee in companionable silence, their hands sometimes brushing against a knee, their fingers catching onto the other, small reassurances that they’re both taking steps to
“Thanks for the sandwich.” Dean takes one of the plates from behind him and Cas nods on autopilot, watching as Dean walks back to the table.
"Well, Dean as I'm sure you know, usually when people mate they want to have pups."  Layla grins as Dean flushes a bright pink, and Cas proceeds to choke on the air he's trying to breathe.
“Sam, man I’m sorry.”
All those lonely nights, replaying that moment over and over, wishing he had said
“Hm?”
“Y-you're welcome.”  Cas has to remind himself to breathe, his heart beating a hard rhythm against his sternum.  He can only imagine what he smells like to Dean right now, and it makes him a little nervous.  Confusion, embarrassment, and attraction are not a good combination.
“Um, yeah, you know him?”
“Bet he found you down in Southeast,” the man continues, his nose flaring as his eyes find Cas’ neck.  “And it seems y’all are mated, too.” Anger on his mate’s behalf swirls in with his own protectiveness, and if it wasn’t for Dean’s presence in the back of his mind he probably would have swung a punch.
“What do you mean by that?” Dean asks, curiosity in his voice. She lets them into the building, and Cas is startled to find a group of about fifty people inside, all staring at him and Dean. There’s a hushed silence in the room, and with this many people Cas is expecting the scents to be overwhelming but they’re… not.  Curiosity is one thing Cas catches, but overall it’s an undertone of anticipation. The scent that’s most freaked out in the entire room is his own, and Dean moves closer to him, brushing him with his shoulder.
“Nothing.  Bad dream.”  Cas’ words aren’t convincing, even to himself.  Dean pushes himself up on an elbow to look down at Cas, but Cas can’t bring himself to meet Dean’s eyes.
Neither of them move at first, Dean’s hands resting on Cas’ shoulders and Cas’ hands a firm grip on his hips. Both of their chests are heaving as they pant for breath in air so thickly laced with their scents it doesn’t feel like there’s enough oxygen. Cas meets Dean’s eyes before he deliberately tilts his head to the side, baring his neck in full submission to the omega on top of him.
“Donuts?” Dean says as he walks in the room, his scent so much warmer than it had been yesterday that Cas doesn’t even try to hide how his nose flares.
Okay, enjoy the new chapter everyone!!! *^_^*
“Dean, you-“
of Angel wings behind him, a noise he will never forget.
that happiness, bringing a smile to his own face.
“Shut up.”  Sam gets a grip on Dean with his right arm, and with timing practiced over years of hunting together they manage to get Dean to his feet.  His leg gives a loud throb in protest and then goes silent. Small victories. “Christ, look at you,” Sam mutters, leaning in to check the gash on Dean’s forehead.
“Whatever.  Just let me know when you set up your first date!”  She hangs up before Dean can say anything else, and Dean groans, grabbing his beer and downing half of it in one go.
“There's no hurry, you're not in the way where you're parked.”  Cas winces, he might as well come out and say I want to stare at you a little longer.  Cas grabs two coffee cups, fixing his how he likes before addressing Dean. “Milk or sugar?”
“I can feel you,” Dean breathes.  His eyes are closed, and the look on his face is indescribable. “Cas- Castiel I...I
“What was that?” Dean's voice comes from the doorway, making Cas jump and turn to face him.  Dean is still wearing the t-shirt that smells like the car, but he's swapped his jeans for cotton pajamas.  He drops his small duffel bag on the floor by the door, glancing around the room.
“Yet being the key word.”  Dean’s answering smile is shy and
sometimes when fucking him.  The thought sends a pulse through his cock and he moans, Cas taking the sound as further encouragement.
going to be happy.
“Not all mine.  Last swing hit an artery or some shit.  Wolf went off like a geyser.” He starts to stumble towards the door.
…that’s when Sam accepted that maybe, finally, it was all over.
"A sandwich sounds great."  Dean hangs the towel up, trading places with Cas who moves to grab plates out of the cabinet.  He breathes deep while Dean's close by, picking up on something mild and pleased. Cas is getting better at picking out the superficial scents and finding the core, calming scent of Dean.  His brain continues to wander in spite of himself, and he starts to wonder what Dean would smell like from the source, his nose pressed into the nook where Dean’s jaw meets his neck, where the scent glands are strongest...
“You love me?”  It’s such a small, timid thing when he says it.  He’s an
I had to struggle through some not so fun personal crap, and writing had to take a backseat. :(  It's been a rough couple weeks but watching the hits and kudos keep going up on this have kept me motivated to keep trying so thank you so much.
Sam, let me go.”  Cas is about to ask what’s happening when he catches an unknown alpha scent on the air.  Well… it’s not completely foreign, his brain registers something familiar about it…
“Shut up,” Cas pouts, not even the least bit embarrassed by how clingy he’s being.  They both head for the bathroom, the shower stall just big enough for the two of them to squeeze into and move around. They wash each other, slowly feeling out how the flow of their emotions works enough to give the other a little breathing room. By the time they’re finished Cas has figured out how to step back and let Dean have his space, yet still feel him as a weight in the back of his mind. They both get dressed in sweatpants and Cas sets to making something else to eat, Dean picking up the phone and calling Layla.
He pulls himself back into the present, and to Eileen’s credit she sits waiting patiently next to him.
Out of curiosity, Cas puts off work for a few more minutes to Google the news Charlie was talking about.  According to the news reports, the Security Force was transporting a political prisoner, and he'd given them the slip.  All they'd released was a physical description and a vague sketch. The guy looks like he could be anyone, and Cas laughs at the government's expense.  Without a photo they were gonna have their hands full for weeks. Cas closes out the news tab on his browser, setting his focus to his work. It isn't going to affect him anyway.
“Well it’s early, only a few days on the job, but the lack of weird shit I think speaks to his handle on the situation.”  Dean goes still, watching what Sam is doing closely.  “He’ll be fine, he had you as a role model.”
He had everything he could ever possibly want. Cold beers whenever he wished. Family and friends to catch up with. Endless roads to drive Baby down. It was truly paradise, and Dean knew Cas had helped build it. For him.
Sam clears his throat, forcing back more tears. “On our last hunt,” he begins, “Dean, uh, he didn’t, uh, he didn’t make it out.”
trigger warnings for blood and stiches in this chapter.
That he changed Castiel’s world for the better.
He felt like he was letting Cas fade away into nothing, like he was giving up on trying to remember him. Somehow the empty Cas-shaped hole in his heart was starting to close up as it was filled with other things.
An old windmill spun lazily in the weak breeze and a small brook gurgled quietly as it moved past a garden that held a few daisy’s. Dean spotted a bumble bee clinging to one of the flowers, scrambling against the white petals to get to the center of the pollen-rich flower.
Dean’s pout grew. “Why not?”
“Dean’ll be good to go in a few hours,” Sam announced as he plopped into his previously vacated chair, tearing Dean from his almost-slumber.
The first day was hard.
“There’s a storage room here that has more obscure files for monsters in them, right?”
When they pulled apart, Dean saw tears in Cas’s eyes. “Dean,” he breathed.
The sound of Claire’s voice rips a sob from Sam’s chest. Tears burn down his cheeks, his hands shake so badly that he has to set his phone down on the library table.
“Sorry it took me dying for me to say it,” Dean added, embarrassed.
That was until he met Castiel.
There were still days when he began to call out for Cas before he stopped himself, but those days were getting fewer and far between.
The next time someone came into his room, he was pleased to see that it was Sam, with Cas in tow.
Dean nodded slowly and was ordered to bed.
“There is no way,” Sam says. “Dean doesn’t- didn’t- want to be brought back, and Cas... Cas is in the empty. There’s no saving him from that.”
Dean found his voice again after an unknown amount of time, speaking softly into Cas’s shoulder. “Don’t you dare leave me again.”
“No,” his voice cracks, strained by too many tears.
The day went by filled with games and laughter. Everyone brought something for Dean. Cas gave him Scooby Doo socks, which Dean laughed at but was secretly pleased with. “Thanks, babe,” he said as he kissed him.
He could hear fighting and gunshots and yelps of pain, but his father’s orders kept him rooted to the spot.
His father hadn’t even praised him for a job well done. He’d hardly spoken a word to Dean since they got back. He knew his father well enough to know that something Dean had done had made him angry, and that something lay stitched under a bandage.
Dean knew what Cas would want for him, and so he chose the latter. Every day he just kept going through the motions, researching for hunters that needed it, keeping tabs on hunters who were off alone, repairing every car in the bunker in case anyone needed a spare, making every kind of bullet he knew would be useful for hunters passing through, cleaning rooms, shopping to keep the kitchen stocked, and logging in a lot of hours at the gun range.
Dean fell asleep with a smile on his face, despite the throbbing pain of his injured limbs. Cas was the only medicine he needed.
Cas nodded slowly, the motion seemed to take over his whole body, causing him to shake and tremble. “Good.” When Dean failed to speak, Cas let out a sigh. “Let’s get this over with, then.”
But eventually the hookups stopped happening. Dean didn’t know when he chose staying in over going out, but more often than not he’d be in his room in the bunker watching horror movies instead of seeking out a girl in a bar.
Dean waved him off with a grunt. “When do you think I’ll be out of here?”
Cas’s hand was warm, his grace even warmer, and as Dean drifted off, one thought flitted through his mind:
Dean had wanted so badly to impress his father, to show him he was ready, but he’d failed, because that was all he knew how to do.
“The day isn’t over yet,” Sam said as he entered the room carrying a pie with two candles sticking out of it, reading the number 42.
There would never be another day where Dean would have to stop a fight that was seconds from breaking out between his father and his brother.
Without Cas there was nothing to live for anyway.
“You too, Garth,” Sam replies.
“Jody,” Sam finally manages to choke out. “It’s-” he takes a breath but it feels like someone is crushing him from the inside, “Jody, it’s Dean,” he cries, “and Cas,” he adds with the last bit of air he can muster from his lungs.
“Dean, we need to go back to the bunker with Jack.”
When he finally fell asleep, it was the most restful, most peaceful, sleep he had experienced since becoming human, and he wished that he could spend every night tucked against Dean’s body, but alas, that was probably too far fetched a dream.
“You shouldn’t be. Sam’s your brother, and I’m fairly sure he already suspects.”
“Dad wasn’t drunk tonight,” Sam whispered in confusion.
His headache hadn’t disappeared with sleep and he couldn't stop his hands from shaking. Dean forced himself to keep going, to stumble through the trees, grabbing onto their trunks to steady his unstable legs. Nausea rolled over him in waves and more than once he found his empty stomach heaving to expel a string of bile.
A hand swung towards Dean’s face as a blood-curdling scream tore out of Cas’s mouth. He could barely see through his tears as he blocked Cas’s blows.
“Sam, what’s wrong?” she asks.
Castiel found that he was much like the Impala.
The fire had long since died out, the sun was high in the sky, its heat beating down on the back of Dean’s neck as he knelt by the smoked pyre. Dean could feel eyes on his back and knew Sam was probably looking out at him, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
This was a thought that he would have to either, examine later, or throw into a deep corner and try not to think about again. And if Dean knew himself, and he did, it was definitely going to be the latter.
Cas sighed, his eyes suddenly regaining a tiny bit of that brightness they used to always carry. “I love you too.”
“Dean,” Sam called after him, “wait!”
He reached up to close and lock the box and then he called Sam.
Castiel waited patiently for the car to reach him and when it slowed, the rumble of the engine loud in the quiet of Heaven, Castiel’s heart leaped into his throat as Dean stepped from his beloved car.
His body was starting to feel heavy, the call of death pulling him away.
enough.
“Love you,” Dean said over a yawn as he squeezed Cas’s hand.
“I got a question.”
Dean had barely turned towards his father when the first hit came and the rest never stopped coming.
“Cas,” he whispered to the tree tops. “You got your ears on?” Dean paused, listening for the rustle of wings. When no sound came, he shut his eyes, drawing in a breath against the pound of his aching head. “Cas, buddy, please. Where are you? I’m gonna find you… I’m gonna...” he trailed off as sleep finally claimed him.
Cas struggled in his grip, a grin spreading across his face. “You’re no match for me.”
Heaven was supposed to be a place free of pain, or so he’d thought. He’d originally been of the belief that when he died Heaven would be his favorite memories playing in repeat. But that was not the case. Not since Jack had taken over.
, believed that he wasn’t something to be used and tossed aside.
“Uh, I guess.”  Cas pushes himself to stand, cautious as he makes his way down the steps.  The man moves into view of the light above the driveway and Cas finally gets a good look at him.  He's a bit taller than Cas with light brown hair and broad shoulders. The cut of his jaw adds to his bright eyes and the half smile on his face, making him the very definition of ‘eye candy’.
Cas hits his alarm as it starts going off, feeling off center as he swings his legs over the side of the bed.  He hadn't slept well last night, tossing and turning, even waking up a few times before drifting off again. He doesn't bother getting dressed, heading straight for the coffee machine in his pajamas.
Have some Cas angst.
“Dean?” Cas asked in concern as he stood up just in time to catch Dean as he crashed into his arms. “Dean, what’s wrong?”
“I’m so sorry,” he sobbed. “Cas, I’m so sorry.”
“I need you to do this for me, I can’t do it alone.”
Cas huffed a broken laugh. “Of course I’m worried, you’re hurt.”
. He was fucked up and so fucking broken that there were hardly any pieces of him left, and then Cas went took the last one with him, leaving Dean even more of a shell.
As John burned in front of him, the man Dean loved and hated more than anyone else, he couldn’t help but let his shoulders drop out of that soldier stance his father had embedded in him.
The boy took off, fear in his eyes.
Dean shook his head. “Nah, let him wonder what we’re doing. I don’t feel like going anywhere right now.”
“Okay, okay,” Dean said, holding up his hands. “This way.”
“You don’t sound too good, is everything okay?”
It was probably midday when he saw him.
In light of recent script leaks, here is Dean spreading Cas's ashes.
He didn’t waste a second. Between the moment Cas had appeared and the next, Dean was rushing into Cas’s arms. Cas stiffened in his grip but soon relaxed, letting out a soft breath against Dean’s neck.
Dean nodded. “Yeah.”
Also on my
“Thank you.” He pulled Cas into a hug and then allowed himself to be guided into a seat and handed a beer.
Dean didn’t have enough energy to respond so he let his eyes close and when Sam returned to the room, he found them like that, Dean dozing off and Cas sitting resolutely by his side.
“I’m not having luck in the library, so I wondered if you could point me towards the storage room.”
Somewhere between the sounds of his sobs he heard Barry shout that he’d found what he needed. It didn’t register in Dean’s head, he was still too numb to think of anything but Cas and the moment the angel had confessed his love.
“I love you too,” Cas replied, his voice shook with tears and Dean felt one fall onto his cheek. Cas raised Dean’s hand to his mouth and pressed a kiss to his knuckles. “So much,” he breathed against his skin.
“I love you,” Cas began, “because you love unconditionally, because you’re loyal, and strong, and resilient, I love you because you
Dean’s fingers fisted tightly in the fabric of Castiel’s trench coat and suddenly he was being pulled forward into a kiss. Dean’s lips were soft, his mouth felt perfect against Castiel’s, they drew breaths in sync, neither wanting the kiss to end.
“Thanks, Cas,” he said, his heart filled with love for the man in front of him and he couldn’t resist pulling Cas back in for another kiss.
Cas’s eyes searched Dean’s carefully as his hand slipped from his shoulder. “You had a nightmare,” he said, more of a statement than a question.
Dean liked the feeling of Cas’s warm palm fitted into his, and he said as much, leaving Cas to laugh in amusement. Dean felt a dopy grin spread across his face and he let himself get lost in those blue eyes again.
But she was dead, gone, burned on the ceiling by a monster his father had yet to catch.
Birthday?
“Then don’t do this,” Dean pleaded. “Please. Stay, let me figure something else out.”
“They’ll probably want to keep you overnight to monitor you,” Cas replied.
His father took him by the shoulders and gave him a shake, not too hard, but not soft either.
Castiel didn’t know when he figured out that he was in love with Dean Winchester, the righteous man, the perfect vessel, but he found it hard to believe that anyone who looked upon Dean, who saw his bright soul, his caring nature, and his fierce protectiveness,
He hates that Dean lashes out when he’s scared.
Jimmy shook his head, there was bitterness to his words when he said. “I haven’t seen him.”
“I love you,” Dean managed to say, it was a raw whisper, shredded by the liquid in his lungs.
“Good.”
This boy’s face was marred with defeat, his eyes were no longer bright green, but a dull sage color, gray and desolate, an echo of the dark sky outside.
good, Dean. Your heart is so good, and pure, and I know you’ll never be able to see yourself the way I do, but you are perfect.”
“We have to,” Dean replied.
Now, standing in front of the door, he felt his heart lodge in his throat. It took a lot for him to open the door and when he did he was hit with the smell of dust.
He was sure as the days passed he’d miss his father, but right now, the anger inside Dean was near boiling point.
Faced with an eternity in a box, the part of Cas that bore the mark must have broken free.
Dean hated it.
There would never be another day where John would order Dean to do something and he would obey.
“Why don’t you go back to the library and I’ll go see what I can find for you.”
“The ocean. I’ll meet up with you after.”
John - Dad. Ellen. Jo. Pamela. Charlie. Cas.
Castiel shivered in sudden cold from the drying sweat on his skin, and Dean instantly moved closer, pulling the former angel into his arms. He knew neither of them would speak of this in the morning, Dean was only comforting him from a nightmare, nothing more.
The brother’s had headed to Texas on the tail of a chupacabra and had finally managed to track it to the farm of the Maverick family. The beast had gone through multiple farms in the area, killing livestock and draining the animals of blood. Dean had known it was a chupacabra from the get go and Sam had agreed with him which made one part of their hunt easier.
Castiel stared at Dean, his heart bursting with joy, with happiness, the happiness he’d felt in the moment he’d sacrificed himself for Dean could not hold a candle to the happiness of
“Do you remember what happened?” Cas asked as he sat down in the chair on the other side of Dean’s bed.
Dean looked over the food, not sure where to start. He decided to have a little bit of everything and Sam and Cas joined him at the table, Cas placing a mug of coffee down in front of Dean with a soft smile.
Dean allowed himself a few moments to look at his best friend, the love of his life, in his final resting place. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Cas’s forehead.
“‘M not in pain.”
Before Dean could do something stupid, like open the box, he pushed it over the edge of the ship, and watched as it sank, carrying Cas with it.
“Thanks, Sammy,” he said with a wince as he rolled his injured shoulder, gauging the sharp twinge of pain as he did so. He’d be fine in a few days.
“Sammy,” Dean rasped. “It doesn’t matter.”
“I have to,” Dean replied, his voice was taut as he tried to hold back tears.
But most of all…
He sucked in a breath that ended up being released in another sob as he buried his face in the lapels of Cas’s coat. Cas’s hands came up to Dean’s back, soothing him with small circles across his shoulders and lower back.
It is justified to say that the feeling pumping through Castiel is heavenly. He is in Heaven -literally and blissfully- in Dean’s arms, in the middle of a road that stretches forever.
Cas beamed at him and opened his mouth, allowing Dean to feed him. Dean didn’t care that they were being disgustingly cute, he was too happy to care, he had everything he could possibly want. It was the best birthday he’d had in well… ever, and he hoped the day would never end.
Slowly, he shut the door, and as he did his eye caught on the faded blood sigil Cas had drawn. It was nearly gone by now, but Dean could still see the outline and he reached a hand up to ghost over the door, never touching, too afraid that if he did it would fade away forever, just like Cas.
Dean didn’t answer, only frowned, and wrenched his gaze from Cas’s.
There are so many people to call, he can’t handle it all, but he has at least one more to make before he turns in for the night.
But, Castiel knew that he was going to lose Dean sooner or later; angels live forever and humans live for a microsecond compared to eternity.
He didn’t know where he was going, he just knew that Cas deserved to rest somewhere he’d like. He pushed a copy of the mixtape he’d given Cas into the tape deck and listened to Zeppelin as he began to sing.
And most of all, he told him that he was loved. Whether he thought he deserved to be loved or not, he was.
The blood that lay caked across his face was from the wounds of a soldier fighting in a war that he could not possibly win, and yet he fought anyway, knowing he would lose.
Eventually, the dreams stopped, and with them came a sense of acceptance. Cas wasn’t coming back. No matter what he did there was no way to reverse what the Empty had done, and so Dean was left with two options.
Sam got him a new record player while Eileen supplied the Zeppelin vinyl to go on it. Donna got him a new shotgun. Claire, Alex, and Patience had all pitched in to buy him a fancy silver knife that had protective symbols carved into the handle. Jody got him multiple new flannels and a new FBI badge that looked far more official than the ones they’d been running around with for over a decade. Bobby got him a pair of boots and Charlie got him DVD’s for Game of Thrones as well as all the Lord of the Rings movies. Garth got Dean spark plugs, which caused Dean to burst out laughing.
He wasn’t supposed to see.
Castiel was dead.
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas said as he came up to give Dean a quick kiss.
There was no world where he would leave his brother alone with John. Sam was only nine years old. Dean had to protect him, he had to let Sam be a kid, had to send him off to live his life; free of this torment.
Sam nodded and swallowed down another gulp of whiskey before Dean swiped the bottle for himself again. “Okay.”
Dean could only stare at the werewolf in shock as it barreled towards him. But he finally managed to raise his gun and aim. The wolf was so close that his long claws raked across Dean’s stomach just as he fired, sending a silver bullet through the beasts heart.
Dean still couldn’t figure out why Cas had left him, why he’d just up and vanished without an explanation. They’d stand a better chance if they stuck together.
Cas shook his head, sadness arresting his features. “I can’t.”
“Thanks.”
Dean squared his shoulders, ignoring the pain in his ribs as he did so, and took a few calming breaths. Rage still simmered, barely contained, under the surface of his deadened eyes, but he knew he’d have to swallow it down if he wanted to survive long enough to protect Sam.
He heard a shout that could only have come from his father’s mouth, and seconds later a man baring his teeth in a snarl burst through the door.
That he wasn’t an instrument for destruction.
. But the words still couldn’t move past his lips, past whatever barriers his fucked up issues had put up. But his heart cried for Cas, his heart said the words, and for now that was enough, it
“Okay, uh,” Dean started to back away, “I’ll just go.”
He loves Dean through his flaws, and he has many, but flaws are beautiful in their own way.
“Who’s worried,” Dean mumbled to her retreating back as he let himself flop back against the pillows, smiling as the morphine she’d given him reached his system.
He hadn’t been in the storage room since Cas died, over a year ago. No one  had been in that room, not even Sam, Dean hadn’t let him.
Three gunshots spiked the air, and then Sam’s voice reached Dean’s foggy hearing. “Dean!”
Dean wanted to sob, he wanted to cry in Cas’s arms until he was shaking and breathless, but he barely had enough energy left to blink. The blood loss had set in and he could see darkness creeping around the corners of his vision.
“Of course not. A glowstick could not possibly represent you. Your soul is much brighter than a glowstick,” Cas replied, deadpan.
. This feeling blossoming in his chest was only going to grow. He’d always felt something towards Dean, even when he was an angel, but now that he had shed his wings, now that he could bleed and hurt and feel, he learned what love
Castiel brought his arms up to Dean’s back and let himself melt into the hug. “Yes, I’m alive. Jack got me out.”
free.
“It’s done.”
“Split up,” Dean said as they got deeper into the forest.
“No,” he replies softly, delicately, “I can’t, not this time.”
Sam huffed a watery sigh. “I can’t do that, Dean.”
Safely under the covers, head turned away from his father, he let the tears fall. The pain threatened to swallow him up, but his father had offered him had nothing to ease it. He was careful not to make any noise, so careful not to let his father know that his son was crying.
Sam found out the next morning, when he knocked on Dean’s door and opened it to find the angel and the hunter curled up together, where they’d stayed since Cas had healed him.
“Good.”
“Did this one hurt a lot?” Cas asked.
Cas took a staggering step forward, bracing himself against the table with the light on. “Is he far behind you?”
“Thanks,” Sam repeats. He really is a broken record, going through the motions even when everything is skipping and scratchy, only producing white noise.
He could live his life. He could be with whoever he wanted to be with. He no longer had to fear his father’s scornful words or his wrath.
Cas gasped as his grace poured through his mouth, destroying everything that was left of the angel the mark had made its puppet.
One of Cas’s hands had slipped into Dean’s and the other was carding gently through his hair, smoothing back sweat soaked strands. Dean didn’t have much strength left, he could feel his body starting to slow, his heart beginning to carefully cease its work.
He wanted his Mom.
“Goodnight, Sammy,” he whispered.
Dean chuckled under him, his laugh reverberating through Castiel’s bones. “It’s an expression, Cas. Wings or not, you’ll always be an angel to me.”
Cas slumped against the box, limp, and Dean collapsed beside him. The pieces of his broken heart wedged themselves deeper into his chest and he sobbed as he pulled Cas’s body onto his lap, rocking him as he held him tightly.
“Bess and I will make the trip with the kids,” Garth says.
“Hey Dean,” Sam said as he sat down in the chair by his bed.
“What?” Donna gasps in shock.
Dean let Sam help him back to the Impala where Sam took the driver’s seat and sent them off back to the motel they’d booked for the night. There he let Sam tend to his wounds, dabbing at it with a whiskey-drenched washcloth. Dean swallowed down some of the burning liquid when Sam declared that the wounds on his neck were deep and needed stitches.
All of this was for him.
Loving Dean is the hardest thing Castiel has ever done, because loving someone means letting them go when it’s clear it won’t work out.
Dean collapsed once it was out of sight. He cried so hard he couldn’t breathe, his chest was constricting and he had half a mind to tie anchors to his feet and jump in after the box.
Dean didn’t have it in him to protest or shake Cas’s hand from his wrist, so he followed the angel back down the corridor to his room. With gentle hands, Cas eased Dean back into bed, pulling the covers over his body before reaching up to cards his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean shuddered under his touch.
Dean gets to go on his first hunt with his father.
“Have you thought about where you want to go for dinner?” Cas asked.
“I have to.” Silence passed between the brother’s for a few moments and then Dean stood and clapped Sam lightly on the shoulder. “Well, I’m heading to bed, you should think about doing the same.”
He was twelve years old, and his Dad had just taken him on his first hunt, a werewolf hunt that he’d wanted backup for. Dean wasn’t supposed to engage in any of the actual fighting, he was supposed to leave that to Dad. He was only there in case any of the wolves escaped, and if that happened then he was supposed to shoot to kill.
Dean groaned as Sam helped him down the stairs and back into the bunker.
“It wasn’t much of a secret,” Sam said.
Castiel blinked at his son in surprise. “Those are wise words.”
“No!” Cas roared.
“Dude,” Sam chuckled as he moved out from behind the counter. “Did you seriously forget your own birthday?”
He never did, because if he told Cas and Cas didn’t feel the same (could angels even love like that?) then everything between him and Cas would start to change. The glass world they live in would begin to crack and then even the lightest tap would cause it all to cave in.
“Yeah.”
Dean’s footsteps echoed loudly in his ears as he entered the bunker and walked slowly down the stairs. The main room was dim, only one light was on at the middle library table.
“You need to know something before you do this.”
Guilt instantly doused his relief and he hung his head, an apology to his father stiff on his tongue, but never passing his lips.
The barn faded away around him, Sam’s sobs were the last thing that he heard, and then he was in Heaven and Bobby was telling him that Cas was here.
“Come on, boy. You hungry for some breakfast?”
John was dead, and he would never hurt Dean again.
“We’re working on your discharge papers,” Sam said as he clapped a hand down on Dean’s shoulder, Dean winced at the impact. “Sorry.”
“Dean,” Cas’s tone was hard yet it held the smallest glimmer of sympathy. “I’m barely keeping everything at bay. My grace is fighting the effects of the mark, but it won’t be long before the mark takes over completely. We’re running out of time, this has to be done, while I’m still in control.”
Words would fail Dean, he knew that, so he took the chance to express his feelings in action instead. He surged forward, pushing Cas back against the door and connecting their lips in a bruising kiss. Dean didn’t expect Cas to kiss back, but he did, hard and passionate.
Castiel’s eyes flicked to the ground, unable to meet Dean’s steady green gaze any longer. “I didn’t think you’d want me,” he said quietly.
The werewolf fell to the ground, dead, and Dean was left to meet his father’s gaze.
Sam is left with the aftermath of Dean's death.
His body screamed for alcohol that Dean couldn’t provide.
“I love you because you never give up, you never give in. You help people out of the goodness of your heart, and your heart
Cas smiled gently at him, resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean leaned into the touch, it was warm and grounding as it sent a
He wanted to scream.
Cas smiled. Blue eyes glassy with his own tears, nearly reminiscent of how he’d look when he’d confessed his love to Dean in the bunker. Pure happiness.
This was inspired by this post on
“Do you really believe that?” Sam asked, skeptical.
“Oh,” Castiel said in a whisper.
Dean shoved gently at him, which caused his ribs to twinge painfully, but he ignored it. “No way in Hell.”
Dean didn’t say anything back, but Castiel hadn’t expected him to. What mattered to him was that Dean knew how he felt and that he was safe.
“What?” Dean asked innocently.
Because Dean loved Cas back.
Dean led Cas down the bunker hallway into the dungeon where the Ma’lak box waited, open and ready.
“Sam! It’s so good to hear from you, hombre!”
Castiel’s job on earth was done. Dean Winchester was saved.
“It’s okay,” Cas said again and Dean took solace in the words. “You’re okay, Dean. I’ve got you, I’m here.”
Dean already knew which one he’d choose, but pretending it could go differently gave him the strength to climb up to the portal. But when Cas slipped through his fingers, the decision was made for him.
Dean woke with a shuddering gasp. His cheeks were streaked with tears and there was an overwhelming bubbling feeling in his chest that let him know he was seconds away from a sob.
His father was dead.
Dean had accepted a long time ago that he would never find love.
Dean swallowed back the tears that wanted to spill across his cheeks. “I had to.”
His feet carried him towards the library, tears still streaming from his eyes, his breaths coming in harsh gasps somewhere between a sob and a desperate quest for air. He nearly tripped getting up the library steps but his sights were set on the figure sitting at the closet table, a book in front of him that he didn’t appear to be reading.
No, Dean had to go back.
“No, you’re not.” Sam was silent and Dean set the whiskey aside so he could lean forward in his chair and fix Sam with his full attention. “Is it Jess?” he asked. Sam’s eyes shot to his brother and Dean took that as confirmation. “Man, you’ve gotta let her go.”
Sam leveled him with a pained look. “It’s not that simple, Dean.”
“Don’t worry, we’ll have you out of here in no time,” the nurse said as she gave him a pat on the cheek, checked over the monitors one more time, and then left the room.
He dreamt of everything that had been done to him. He dreamt of the pain from being torn apart by the snap of a finger. He dreamt of the millions and millions of clones, that bore an uncanny resemblance to Dean Winchester, strewn dead around an empty warehouse. He dreamt of his memories being tampered with at the hands of Naomi.
“Cas, please,” he begged as he held Cas back against the box.
to have a relationship. He wanted
He knew they were out of time. He had to say goodbye.
“It’s not like I’m not aware of my actions,” Dean argued.
The whirring of Naomi’s drill echoed in his mind and he swallowed hard, the fear pulsing through him yet another new feeling he would have to get used to.
And of course Jimmy wouldn’t want to see the angel who stole his life and ruined his family. Dean couldn’t fault him for that, so he had turned away and pushed his way out of the Roadhouse.
Just up ahead there was a meadow.
“How’re you feeling?” Sam asked.
There would never be another night where he’d take a beating from his father and go to bed bleeding and bruised.
“I love you too,” Dean said breathlessly against Castiel’s lips. “I have for years.”
“I’m being truthful. You’re perfect to me, Dean. Broken or not. I can see under your scars, Dean. You’ve been through so much, and you’ve grown so strong from your experiences. Please never be ashamed of your scars or the cracks in your armor, they make you who you are, and I wouldn’t want you any other way.”
“He’s dead, Cas too,” Sam replies.
He knew he could see Dean again now that he was dead, he also knew that Dean probably didn’t want to see him, and he knew that he was still going to have to face him one way or another.
Dean hadn’t been able to move for a long time. The moon was hidden behind endless clouds, the rush of cars from a distant road filled his ringing ears, and a dog barked in the distance.
He could feel hands on him, Sam begging Dean to stay with him, pressure being applied to the wound that had punched its way through his abdomen. But it wasn’t just Sam’s hands; he could see Cas out of blurry eyes.
I wanted you back,” Dean said earnestly, his voice cracking on the last word.
A soft breeze ruffled his hair and the old windmill creaked as it tried to spin. Dean looked up to see that some of the ashes had been caught in the wind. Dean choked on a laugh as he watched them rise into the air.
Cas moved to climb into it but Dean put a hand on his arm to stop him. “Wait.”
“You stop that right now, Dean,” he’d snapped.
Dean took a shaky breath and forced his hands forward, scooping Cas’s ashes into an old vase he’d found in the cabin.
Dean didn’t notice the lingering touches at first. The squeeze of a shoulder with a hand that stayed for just a tiny bit longer than it should afterwards. There were also times when Dean caught Benny staring. His mind instantly wondered if Benny was sizing him up for a meal and would attack while he was asleep, but he quickly learned that those looks were filled with fondness.
“‘Night angel,” Dean said softly against his hair.
The bunker faded around him and Castiel sighed in relief, knowing that the landing had been worth it, because he was pretty sure that Dean finally,
Castiel knew he’d never be able to have a relationship with Dean that wasn’t friendship, as much as he yearned for one. So he kept to himself, he loved from afar, and he tried to prove to Dean that he wasn’t worthless.
Two days later, they found Cas.
“I certainly hope you don’t see me as an equivalent to your mother,” Cas said, slightly affronted, but teasing.
He would not cry.
He shouldn’t be glad that the man who raised him, who taught him everything he knew, was dead.
The back of a dark head, a tan trench coat sweeping behind him as he walked.
“Okay, Mom,” Dean grumbled.
“Happy birthday!” they shouted as Dean entered.
“You should get some sleep,” Dean said as he eyed his brother. There were dark circles under his eyes and he looked weary.
Cas’s blue eyes were fixed on his, something so sad and peaceful was settled in their depths. Dean blinked at him, all the words he wanted to say were lodged in his throat, stopped by a barrier of blood.
After a moment, Castiel felt the lightest of pressures on the top of his head. It took him a second to realize that it had been a kiss, the most barely-there of kisses, but a kiss nonetheless.
But Dean would never call it Heaven if it didn’t include Cas.
“Yeah, thanks,” Dean replied. “But we’re not talking about this.” Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed and Cas climbed off after him. He didn’t think twice about taking the angel’s hand as they walked to the kitchen.
All that loving, all that pain, that he had been holding inside him for years, came spilling out.
Eileen, Jody, Donna, the girls. Garth, Bess, and their kids. Bobby, Charlie, everyone from apocalypse world; it was overwhelming.
“And he will, just not yet. Is that okay? Can we wait a little longer?”
“Dean,” Sam said, voice almost a whisper. “Dad had blood on his hands when he came in here. You don’t have to lie.”
He could also feel blood that was scrubbed away, only leaving some flecks to remain from the fights and the wounds that needed healing.
When Sam left, Dean grinned up at Cas. “You gonna heal me with a kiss?”
“I just thought we could get an early jump on it, but you and Cas look… busy.”
“I just wanted to give you your present, away from Sam’s prying eyes,” Cas said.
Cas began to rock them gently and Dean’s grip tightened on Cas’s trench coat with each slow movement as his tears slowly began to stop and his aching chest let in some much needed air.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replied warmly.
“‘S nothin’, ‘ve had worse.”
That’s where Dean sat now, in their motel room, in a chair beside the barely-standing table that held all the first aid supplies his Dad always kept with him.
“I c-can’t,” he’d hiccupped.
It was true. All of it was true. Cas had already killed so many during moments when he lost himself to the mark. An angel with the power of the mark was unstoppable, the world would be demolished if such a being were allowed to continue to roam freely.
Castiel goes to Dean in Heaven.
Whenever Dean closed his eyes that was all he could see. Cas’s mouth open in surprise, white light shining from his mouth and eyes, the mirth in Lucifer’s smile, the sharp jolt in his knees as they hit the ground beside the scorch marks of Cas’s broken wings.
“I love you,” he blurted out, unable to stop himself.
Dean unwrapped the vase and stood there for a moment, staring at the ashes of his best friend. There was so much he wished he could have told Cas, so many words that had longed to be spoken but that had always died the second they rested on his tongue. Now Dean saw no point in saying them at all, but words fell from his mouth nonetheless.
There’s a lot more to love than meets the eye.
“I’ll come to see you, ya?”
The second day was harder.
Sam cut him a big slice of pie and Dean saw that it was cherry, his favorite. “Thanks, Sam,” he said as his brother set the plate in front of him. “I hope you guys don’t expect me to share!” he shouted out to the room.
Love hurts the most when you’ve gone through the trouble of jumping and falling, only to land and survive in a world where the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, doesn’t love you back.
Dean hadn’t meant for him to see.
So when Dean couldn’t forgive him for what happened with Jack and Mary, Castiel chose to go, and when Dean didn’t stop him, he knew he made the right choice. He couldn’t stop loving Dean, no matter what happened between them, but he couldn’t stand to be around him anymore, because loving someone who looks like they’re within reach but in reality is miles away, is pure torture.
Dean let himself fall further into Castiel, taking in everything about him; the feel of the scratchy trench coat under his fingers, the beat of Cas’s heart in his chest, the sweet smell of honey and nature that was just so very
“Yes it does,” Sam replied, voice suddenly hard.
fall in love with him.
A grief-stricken scream echoes in Sam’s ears and he can hear Claire storming away until a door slams in the distance.
Dean scrambled for his flare gun with his uninjured arm and tried to reach it where it was nestled behind his back, but the beast was draining him quickly of blood and he was beginning to see spots before his eyes.
“I’ll go see if I can negotiate a change to that plan,” Sam said as he stood up.
He hates that Dean doesn’t see himself as worth anything because he had it drilled into his brain by an abusive father that he’s not good enough for anything other than dying.
“He said he was going out,” Sam replied. There was a pause and then Sam put his book aside and crossed the room to Dean. “Did he do this to you?”
“I remember putting you back together,” Cas said softly. “I searched Hell for every piece of you, dragged bits of your soul from the clutches of demons, sewed you back into a person, every scar erased.”
Dean had dropped his already, but the wolf had managed to get his own shot in before he went down. He could feel the bullet inside him, wedged into some vital organ, it shifted with each labored breath he took.
When Dean returned, Sam didn’t try to console him, and Dean was grateful for it. He wanted to be left alone to grieve.
The fateful moment replayed in his head: Sam dragging him from Cas as he approached Lucifer, already thinking Cas was dead but then watching him come back through the gateway only for an angel blade to pierce through his heart.
But stepping into that room, everything came flooding back.
Dean trudged through the forests of purgatory, eyes scanning the trees warily for anything that might try to jump out at him. His body ached and he wanted nothing more than to collapse and let sleep take over, but he had to find Cas. The angel could have gone anywhere, he could be in trouble. Purgatory was no place to be alone.
Sam shrugged off his flannel and pressed it up against Dean’s neck before helping him stand. “Come on, let’s get you patched up.”
Cas shook his head. “You’re wrong.”
He’d gone out to meet Brendon, a... friend... he’d made on their last hunt. Brendon understood the life, so Dean thought maybe John would approve if he wanted to be something more with him. He thought maybe his father would have changed since their last discussion on sexuality. He couldn’t have been more wrong.
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean replied with a smile.
Cas shook his head but he was smiling. “Sam’s going to wonder what’s taking so long.”
The familiar pinch of a needle piercing his skin made him grit his teeth, but Sam’s hands were steady and he soon had the wounds properly sutured.
Cas chuckled and shook his head. “There’ll be time for that later, but what I got you, is a dinner date for two at a restaurant of your choosing.” Cas pulled a gift card from his coat pocket and handed it to Dean.
Cas’s fingers pressed down on Dean’s forehead, sending the warm tingling of grace flowing through him, guiding him off to a sleep Dean knew would be a lot more peaceful than the nightmare he had woken from.
He could feel the memories she held swirling around him.
The sky was dark. The clouds sat heavy in the stark expanse of galaxy. No stars could be seen, and somehow that made Dean feel better; there were less eyes to pray upon his weakness.
“But it’s
Hurt flashed across Dean’s face. “Why didn’t you come back to Earth?”
The bee from the daisy buzzed off into the sky, flying among the dust that was Castiel, like it was escorting his ashes to their true home.
When Dean finally managed to get control of himself, it had been about a week. A week of crawling to streams and eating whatever he could find. A week of shaking hands, horrible headaches, and watching Cas, whom he’d come to understand wasn’t real, walk off in the distance, back always to Dean.
Tears began to dampen his eyes the longer he looked at the sigil, and when he finally managed to turn around, he was confronted with the open space that Cas had disappeared from, smothered in black goo.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Well, birthday boy, come and eat.”

He never did anything right.
Dean slammed the trunk shut and made sure he had his flare gun and his shotgun before turning to Sam. “You ready?”
When he’d finally managed to get his feet under him, he clutched at his side and ran.
“I miss you so much, Cas. I’d give anything to have you back, to tell you-” he broke off, unable to go further as his voice broke and the tears fell freely.
Castiel couldn’t explain why, he just felt like the Impala had a soul of its own. She was gorgeous and so well loved. She’d taken the boys across the country, saved their lives when they needed to get away, been their home when they were otherwise homeless. She was so important to the Winchesters, and so she was important to Castiel.
“Dean we have to hurry, if we delay any longer I’m afraid I might hurt you.”
It was perfect.
Maybe his chance at love wasn’t as far gone as he’d thought.
Dean watched the flames as they licked up towards the sky, the smell of burning flesh stung the back of his throat with each breath he took, and tears mapped their way down his cheeks in salty waves.
“You’re scared,” Cas said, it wasn’t a question, it was a statement, an observation.
Dean nodded in understanding. “It was horrible. But we’ll find the thing, and we’ll make it pay.”
He noticed his similarities to the car one night while the Winchesters slept. Somehow he’d found his way to the garage where he’d decided to sit in the front seat of the Impala. This was where Dean felt the most comfortable and at home, right here, in this seat, hands on the steering wheel, pedal on the gas, music blaring from the speaker. Castiel’s hands hovered over the wheel, he almost didn’t want to touch it, this was Dean’s car and even sitting in this seat he felt almost wrong. He shouldn’t be touching Dean’s things, but some other part of him was drawn to the car.
He hates that Dean feels like he has to put up walls for his protection; what Castiel wouldn't give to be able to turn those walls into dust.
His hands on the seats could feel tears long since dried but still woven into the vinyl from the bad memories.
“Sam?” Jody questions softly.
Castiel didn’t know what he expected to happen, but Dean running at him and flinging his arms around his neck was not it.
He basked in the feeling it brought him, in the warmth that swirled through his soul.
Reborn many times.
After the age of six, crying was unacceptable under any circumstances.
The nurse checked his eyes, changed his bandages, and the whole time Dean let his attention fall in and out of focus. The nurse was wearing some kind of flowery perfume that made Dean want to sneeze, but somehow he managed to keep his bodily fluids to himself.
“Those can wait. You’re the best present I could ask for, Cas. Having you back, it’s all I could want.”
“Okay,” he whispered as tears slid down his cheeks.
Dean snorted and knocked Cas’s shoulder with his own. “Shut up.”
Summoning as much strength as his body could manage, he lifted Cas into the box and arranged him against the cold metal.
“Oh no, I know that look,” Dean said. “What’s up?”
“Cas?” Dean asked in disbelief.
Castiel smiled and let his fingers tangle with Dean’s. “That sounds wonderful.”
“Cas,” he said in a whisper. “Please man, just come back.”
Their foreheads rested against each other and Dean couldn’t help the laugh of joy that escaped him as he finally spoke. “Hey, Cas.” The emotion in his words and the kisses they had shared had to be enough for Cas to know that he felt the same, and by the look in Cas’s eyes, he did.
It’s not the falling that hurts, it’s the landing and realizing that the fall meant nothing until you hit the ground and your body breaks into hundreds of pieces.
“They’re-” he can’t say it, if he says it it’s real, if he says it he has to acknowledge that they’re gone. “Dead.” The word is a whisper, contorted with pain.
“Donna, hey,” Sam replies.
This was where everything had been taken from him. This was where his world imploded. This was where Dean had felt loved for the first time. This was where his heart was broken. This was where the love of his life was taken from him.
Dean was nothing short of miserable.
John Winchester only blinked a few times at Dean before grabbing him by the arm and pulling him into the Impala. He tossed Dean a rag and instructed him to put pressure on the wound before sending them off back to the motel.
John had made a deal for Dean’s life, that much was clear. In the end he’d sacrificed himself for his son, but that made Dean hate him more.
Sweat slicked his skin and dampened his shirt, his heart hammered a desperate drumbeat in his chest, and his hands were clammy where they gripped the sheets around him.
Sam sighed and sat down across from Dean, pulling the whiskey towards himself to have a sip.
Dean spent the rest of his hospital stay eating pudding and watching crap TV and when he was finally wheeled out of the building and helped into the backseat of Baby, he let out a sigh of relief.
It was Jimmy Novak, and in that moment, Dean’s already wounded heart had shattered. “Is he here?” Dean had asked, hopeful.
“I’ll find a way!” Claire shouts.
. Dean let himself be held, getting lost in the feeling of Cas’s hands on his back as the panic from his nightmare memory began to fade.
“I think it’s beautiful.”
Cas didn’t turn around, he kept walking, each step talking him farther and farther away from Dean.
Castiel hates Dean.
He hates that Dean won’t talk to him when he needs to.
Jack shrugged. “I’m just saying, you miss him, and he misses you.”
“We’re not
It was nice in a way, not having to go out and risk his life everyday, but there were times where he missed the adrenaline rush. When he missed the high of hunting, he drank, just so he could be buzzed in at least one way.
“Run!” Dean hissed to Brendon.
Everything he wanted to say was in that one word, and he knew Cas understood when he briefly let go of Dean’s hand to lay it on Sam’s arm, causing the younger Winchester to look up in panic.
“My apologies,” he said.
Sometimes he found himself wanting to lean into the touches, to run a hand over the beard on the vampire’s face just to feel the scratch of it under his fingers. There was so much pent up sexual energy building in Dean’s gut, and part of him wanted to jump Benny, slam him against a tree and capture his lips in a kiss.
“There, you’re done,” John said as he stood up.
“I love you too,” Cas replied.
“Bobby said... but I didn’t... but you’re here... you’re alive,” Dean muttered into Castiel’s shoulder.
“You might change that sentiment once the drugs wear off.”
Castiel was so new to everything concerning the incredible feat that was being human. Aches and pains dwelled in his joints, tiredness seeped through him with an ease that he hadn’t known could exist; it gripped him in an iron hold, dragging him down in an ocean that he had otherwise been afloat in.
She looked so lonely in the garage, the dark bunker humming around her, but Castiel knew that she was only waiting. Waiting for the Winchesters to climb inside where she could take them to save someone in need. Castiel patted her hood, the sound echoing around the garage, before he headed back inside to continue his watch over the Winchesters as they slept.
“Cas!” Dean called out, voice hoarse and degraded to a rasp.
Dean released Cas momentarily and the angel moved to attack him again, but Dean was faster. The angel blade he’d tucked into the waistband of his jeans was in his hand before Cas could take another step and soon it was embedded in Cas’s chest.
Dean dies in Castiel's arms.
Dean nodded at him in greeting. “Hey.”
“I’m happy for you,” Sam continued.
Dean headed to the docks, where he boarded a small fishing ship filled with men that didn’t ask questions. They took Dean out as far as they could and just as he moved to toss the box over the side, Dean heard Cas wake up.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Cas reassured him. “I’m going to stay right here and watch over you as you sleep.”
Dean shifted, bringing his arms up to wrap even more securely around Castiel’s human frame, jarring him from his thoughts.
Footsteps sounded outside his room and then the door was being pushed open and Dean was shouldering his way inside, gun drawn.
Sam calls Jody first.
A moment of silence passed between them, and then Cas asked, “how many werewolves attacked you on that hunt?”
“Cas,” he began a prayer, but the rest of his words stopped in his throat. He didn’t know what he wanted to say, or how to say it. He just knew that he wanted
“I love you because you’re you.”
“Yeah. Jody’s coming with the girls,” Sam says. “So I’ll see you when you get here.”
With a sigh he sat down on a large boulder and let his head fall into his hands.
“He didn’t mean it,” Dean mumbled.
“I wish I could heal you,” Cas said softly. “I hate that I can’t.”
Cas started under him, surprised at the break in silence. “I won’t,” he said, and it sounded like a promise.
“Oh no, what’s got you down in the dumps?” she asks.
“Yeah,” Sam affirms.
Sleep was welcome to his aching body. He knew it was bad, it had to be if he was in the hospital and not some rundown motel, but his mind was foggy enough not to worry about just
This was a writing request on
Dean scoffed and twisted so he could look at Cas where he sat on the bed. “It’s ugly.”
Dean found himself drifting off to the sweet litany of beeping monitors. The sound was like a lullaby in his head, the slow
Dean felt his last smile tug at his lips, his last breath pushing out of his clogged lungs past that smile as he finally let go and allowed himself to fall into the arms of death.
Dean buried himself in Cas’s arms, nosing at his neck and leaving soft kisses there. Cas let Dean kiss him anywhere and everywhere, and when they finally managed to get off each other, Sam had definitely had enough time to clear the dishes.
“I love you,” he whispered over another sob.
He had been prepared for these things. He’d watched the Winchesters endure pain and suffering, he’d seen firsthand what it would be like if he lost the safety that his grace provided, making him just that little bit more invincible than a mere human. He knew what it felt like to hurt, as he was still vulnerable to the edge of a blade or the barrel of a gun, but such things could never kill him.
“Is it really?” He glanced at his watch to see that the date was indeed, the 24th of January. “Huh.”
“What’s happened?”
Cas stopped in front of it, eyes trained on the metal carvings and nodded. “This should do.”
He took the vase and closed up the end with some plastic wrap before he made his way out to the Impala. She rumbled to life and Dean pulled away from the cabin.

There would never be another night where John would spit at Dean’s broken body as he lay on the pavement, blood dripping from his mouth, the damage done by his father after he saw his son with another man.
His father was dead and he was
Getting to sleep was hard. The bunker hummed around him, the concrete walls seemed to close in on him, a cold wind brushed over his skin and sent shivers down his spine, a feeling Dean had told him felt like you were being watched. The bed under him was comfortable but stiff, the pillow was thin and did little to support his head. His thoughts seemed to be caught up in a race, chasing each other around and around on an invisible track.
Castiel sighed and nodded slowly. “Alright, I’ll go to him.”
Dean shifted his gaze to Cas and couldn’t help but let his smile grow. “Peachy.”
He told him that he couldn’t have him.
“You betcha,” Donna replies, sadness tips the edges of her words.
He hoped Cas would like the meadow as much as he did.
“Hey Cas,” he began like he did all his prayers. “I thought you might like it here, in the sunshine, near the water.” Dean paused as he forced himself to tip some of the ashes onto the ground. He couldn’t bring himself to speak again until the ashes had been completely spread, and then he sank to his knees as sobs shook his shoulders.
nothing more than a whisper, telling him to sleep. It rocked him on gentle waves and coaxed him closer to unconsciousness, although, a Dean that wasn’t pumped full of pain medication would understand that the beeping had nothing to do with his drooping eyelids and everything to do with said pain medication.
Dean’s fingers tightened around Cas’s, trying to tell him that it was okay. It was okay that he didn’t have his powers anymore, life with him these past few years had been worth it all. Rescuing him from the empty, making him to become human to escape, it was all worth it. Dean knew Cas liked being human and that he vastly preferred it to being an angel.
Dean glanced at Cas, tears in his eyes. “You and Sam did all this?”
Dean nearly gasped at Cas’s appearance. His eyes were sunken in their sockets, their color, once bright blue, was now dulled and drained. Blood soaked the left side of his face and coated his trench coat and shirt.

He could feel the calm that would settle over the car during the night when the boys would be spread across the benches as they slept, trusting her to keep them safe, and she did.
He calls Donna next.
Dean nodded weakly, his tears burning at the corners of his eyes. He looked over to Sam who was staring at Dean through his own tears. Dean looked back at Cas, a silent conversation passing between them.
When they pulled apart, Dean felt like he was floating. “That was worth the wait,” he said.
Sam and Cas hadn’t noticed yet.
John Winchester was dead.
He appeared in the middle of a long stretch of road and he could make out the unmistakable shape of a black 1967 Chevrolet Impala making its way towards him.
Dean’s heart broke inside him, each piece lodging itself into his chest as pain tore through him. He bent his forehead against the angel’s and pressed another kiss to his lips.
The boy who looked back at him in the mirror, was not someone he recognized.
“I’m not perfect,” Dean muttered. “If I were perfect, I wouldn’t be so broken.”
Dean stayed there for a little while longer, listening to the brook as gurgled and flowed, watching the windmill spin and the daisy’s bend in the wind.
Dean could feel tears mingling with the blood on his face and he coughed again. Cas soothed him through it, a comforting hand through his hair and a kiss to his forehead.
“Cas,” he finally managed to choke out.
Sam nodded and headed off in one direction while Dean went the other. They’d canvassed the perimeter of the farm in the daylight and hadn’t been able to locate the chupacabra’s nest, killing it while it was in it’s nest was preferable, they could have just lit it on fire and let the flames do the rest, but now they were forced to wait for it to make its own appearance.
“Straight through the window,” Cas chimed in. “You hit your head pretty bad on the concrete.”
It took Dean a moment to realize that this feeling, pumping through his veins, was relief.
“You did not seriously compare me to a glowstick,” Dean grumbled over a small laugh.
Sam nodded, looking between the two of them. “Right, sure.”
“Uh, sorry,” Sam said as he stood awkwardly in the doorway. “I just uh, found another case.”
Cas squeezed his hand. “I love you too.”
Dean faltered, fumbling with his hands while he tried to calm the slamming of his heart in his chest. He managed to raise his head to meet Cas’s gaze and he swallowed as his eyes dipped to Cas’s lips.
The jerky in Dean’s throat suddenly didn’t want to go down. He coughed slightly, bringing his fist up to cover his mouth. “Um, yeah.”
Castiel dragged his eyes back up to Dean’s. “You did?”
Dean squeezed Cas’s hand and put on his best reassuring smile. “It’s okay. Besides, if you healed me I wouldn’t get you doting on me like this.”
“What kind of answer is that?”
“We’ll make the trip down to you, okay?”
“There’ll be a wake, yeah?”
“A week or so. Since he became God.”
With Barry gone, Dean had a moment to collect himself.
“Just your typical werewolf,” Dean replied through a grunt of pain.
Dean turned his head abruptly to see none other than Castiel standing before him. He looked the same as he always did, clad in a suit and trench coat, but he looked nervous, and Dean knew why.
But the longer Dean sat in the woods, eyes fixed on the cabin that his Dad had disappeared inside, the more anxious he got.
His sudden feelings for Benny made his nightly prayers to Cas that much more desperate. He wanted to push those urges away because there was only one person -angel- that he wanted to be with, even if he was too much of a coward to admit it aloud.
,” Dean retorted. “But, I guess the secret’s out now.”
Dean headed towards the library, his fingers linked with Cas’s, and when they arrived, Dean’s jaw nearly dropped. The room was filled with people.
“No?” Claire snaps, in clear confusion.
Dean stood with his back against a tree, the rough bark digging into his back with each labored breath that wheezed past his lips. He let the wind whip him, not caring that it lashed into his body with the steely grip of a predators teeth.
Slowly, Dean peeled himself away from Cas, but only far enough that he could look into those reassuring blue eyes. “I can’t take it if you do, Cas. I can’t,” he mumbled, voice wrecked from tears.
“Let me out!” he screamed.
Maybe once they got out of purgatory he’d finally have the balls to tell Cas how he felt, or maybe he’d just disappear back into the bottle he’d been deprived of.
Dean nodded into his pillow, eyes shut against the memory of the wolves claws digging into his back, pain exploding in his veins.
“You have to. We’ve got to focus on Dad, Sam. I need your head in the game, Dad needs your head in the game.”
Cas quickly moved to help Sam bring Dean into his room, where they laid him down on his bed. Dean winced in pain as the scratches from the werewolf brushed against the fabric of his shirt.
“Dean,” Cas chuckled.
“Of course,” Cas chuckled softly.
When John left him, broken and bleeding, with a spat warning that if he ever ‘pulled a stunt like that again’ he’d would never be allowed to come back.
He was
he did. It was just his fucked up mind that didn’t let him say it back. It was John Winchester’s voice in his head calling him every slur under the sun. It was his own insecurities and his belief that he didn’t deserve Cas. Cas was too good for him. Cas was
“It’s okay,” Cas shushed him softly as Dean’s body betrayed him and refused to fall back under his control. “I’ve got you, it’s okay.”
The drive to the bunker wasn’t a long one, but it was the most agonizing thirty minutes of Dean’s life.
Barry gave him a confused look but nodded. “Okay. Sure.”
“And what of Sam?”
The car seemed to creak in response and Castiel smiled.
Dean wasn’t supposed to be here, he wasn’t supposed to be alive. He should be dead, but he wasn’t, and John was the reason for it.
They were still too busy dealing with the werewolves, fighting for their own lives.
There would never be another day where John would yell at him in the stead of Sam.
“We’ve got other presents in the library,” Cas murmured against Dean’s lips.
Castiel considered this offer. Dean knew most of what Castiel had dreamed about, but he was in no hurry to relive his memories with the hunter.
Dean shook his head. “No, no, Cas, please don’t make me.”
Benny kissed him hard and Dean let the vampire have his way.
Dean sniffled and wiped at his eyes but he couldn’t stop the tears.
But Castiel himself, once angel of the Lord, had never understood the complexity of a human mind while it dreamed. He was never able to figure out how one could be tormented in what was supposed to be a restful experience. He only came to understand, one night, when his mind started to play tricks on him during his slumber.
Sam can’t get the words out, they’re stuck in his throat, throbbing behind tears.
Eventually, Cas disappeared and Dean was left alone again, mind foggy, and heart aching for the angel to return to him.
The last thing he heard before he let death claim him, was a soft whisper in his ear, Cas’s deep rumbling voice, so soothing and strong. “I’ll see you in Heaven.”
“But not before the ghoul kicked out your leg,” Sam added.
Dean’s mouth suddenly went dry and he had to clear his throat to get his voice to work. “Cas?” he called out warily. A shadow appeared from behind a post and Dean’s heart stuttered in his chest. “Cas,” he said as he took a step towards the shadow.
Love could push sadness away to make room for joy.
Dean used to hate when Cas did that. It was creepy on so many levels, but now, there was comfort in it that Dean hadn’t realized he’d missed until Cas had died.
And the man had said as much, in a voice like Castiel’s, but so different. “I am not Castiel.”
“Cas!?” he shouted, voice pulled tight with worry.
Sam’s footsteps retreated and Dean forced himself to his feet, clutching the vase tightly in his hands.
“Hello, Dean.”
His father nodded curtly and then stood up, leaving Dean to follow him.
“Cas,” Dean began.
It was at that moment that a sound Dean had not heard in many years filled the wood. The sound of wings.
Cas’s hand returned to Dean’s and Dean smiled through the blood and the pain. “I wish I could heal you,” Cas whispered softly.
dead, right? You can bring them back, can’t you?”
Cas did kiss the back of Dean’s hand to make up for it and Dean let his fingers thread with Cas’s.
“Anything I can do to help?”
Dean looked down at their joined hands and tried to ignore the tears beginning to prick at his eyes. “Why do you love me?”
Cas smiled and scooched closer to Dean, placing a hand on his cheek and drawing him in. Their lips met in a soft kiss, but Dean deepened it the first chance he got and Cas grinned into his mouth.
“So what’s next?” Sam asked.
“Just in case your car fails on you again,” he said.
So many people had died for
He came and went from consciousness, only waking when a nurse came to check on him or the drugs wore off and the pain started to creep in. His head hurt like a motherfucker and there was a throbbing ache in his leg and ribs that caused his breath to stutter every time he inhaled.
Used.
“Because it would be inappropriate,” Cas replied. Dean crossed his arms like a petulant child, of course that proved difficult due to his broken ribs, but he tried anyway. “Don’t hurt yourself,” Cas warned.
Soon his tears of pain became tears of longing. He missed his Mom, he hardly remembered what her voice sounded like, but he knew it was soft, and loving, nothing like the rough gravel that was John’s, whose every word left scrapes under his skin that no one could see; but that didn’t mean they weren’t there.
“Yes about that, I wasn’t expecting you so soon.”
“Do you wanna talk about it?” Dean asked tentatively.
Cas laughed, it was a gentle sound, deep yet soothing. “I suppose not.”
But his father’s anger filled voice rang in his ears nonetheless.
“Sammy!” Dean shouted, just as the beast charged him.
“Come with me,” Cas said softly in his ear as Sam turned on the sink to start washing dishes.
Dean hadn’t wasted a minute when he saw Brendon, he’d kissed him under the starless sky, their bodies flush against each other, trying to hide from the harsh cold in the air.
With Cas buried, everything looked completely hopeless. Chuck might be gone, but they were still losing to the monsters, and the future didn’t look bright. Dean wasn’t one to give up, but sometimes giving up was the only option, and Dean was inclined to accept that the end was upon them.
Once he did manage to drift off, a tired body rolling him into sleep, his dreams were the farthest from pleasant.
“Goodbye, Cas,” he choked out.
Dean couldn’t move. He was pressed against a tree, energy completely drained from his body, queasy, head drumming with what could only be described as a migraine, and hands unfit to hold a gun. The only thing he could do was stay where he was, spit bile onto the ground and pray to Cas.
Finally, the wound was declared sutured and his father wiped around it with a rag that smelled heavily of alcohol and plastered a bandage to it.
He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to say them out loud. Those three little words held so much in them that Dean wasn’t ready to unpack. So for now, his shaking sobs in the empty, dusty, room, would have to speak for him, and as his heart screamed for the one person who could make it all better, Dean sank into the door, tears leaking from his eyes, wishing for the Empty to come take him too so he could see Cas again and tell him the words he was so afraid to speak.
Dean nodded shakily. “Good. Good.”
That was when the shout had rung out, shattering the ice that had been preserving the moment.
When he finally stood and picked up the empty vase, he gave the meadow one last look and then walked back to the Impala, feeling the emptiness of Cas’s loss as he climbed into the car.
When Cas settled down beside him for the night, Dean turned to look at him, this beautiful angel, who was more perfect in Dean’s eyes than anything else. He kissed him slowly, pouring his love into the movement of their lips together, connected at the seams. And when they pulled apart, wrapped in each other’s arms, Dean decided that there was no better feeling than love. For love was the only emotion that had any power over the others.
The angel looked like he was about to argue but he only sighed. “What is it?” The barest glimpse of the old Castiel came through in the way Cas tilted his head and narrowed his eyes.
“Dean, I can’t let you do this,” Sam said as Dean stepped into the Impala.
Part of him thought that there was no point in having meaningless sex if nothing was going to be built from it. That was the problem. He
“I thought you didn’t share your pie,” Cas said with an amused smile.
“No, you don’t.”
But eventually Cas started to fade from his mind. It was just easier not to think about him and he had things to do to keep himself busy.
“How are we doing?” a nurse asked, she was blond, petite, and was exactly Dean’s type, but unfortunately, being bedridden and out of it meant that he couldn’t exactly turn the charm on easily. Not to mention, he was already taken, he had no reason to flirt.
Now, he
Dean pulled away just slightly, only far enough away to press his lips to Cas’s. It took Cas a moment to realize what was happening, but soon he was kissing Dean back and everything finally felt right. Everything was finally perfect.
“Claire,” Jody sighs sadly and Sam hears her take the phone from Claire’s hands.
,” Cas hissed as he gripped the edge of the table so hard the wood groaned under his hand. “And you will. You have to.”
SUICIDE TRIGGER WARNING!!
When everyone started to sing Happy Birthday to you, Dean sank into his seat in embarrassment. What the hell were you supposed to do when you were sung at anyway? When the singing stopped, Dean blew out the candles and everyone cheered.
“Please don’t go,” he begged.
When he opened the bathroom door, Sam fell backwards onto the tiled floors. Soft snores slipped past his brother’s lips and Dean bit back amusement. Sam had fallen asleep waiting for him to come out, had he really been in there that long?
“‘M’kay,” Dean slurred in response.
Sam shook his head, panic in his eyes. “No.” Cas leveled him with a look and Sam’s hands slowly fell away from the gushing wound. Dean tried to give Sam a reassuring look, but his brother was staring blankly at Dean.
Dean rolled over with a yawn, arms reaching for the warmth of the body that should be beside him, but an empty bed greeted his efforts. He opened his eyes slowly and glanced toward the bottom of the bed, where Miracle still lay curled up, he raised his head when Dean shifted and Dean leaned forward to scratch him behind the ears.
“How’d it happen?” Garth asks, his voice has changed, he’s clearly fighting tears.
Sam shrugged. “Just… do you think we’ll ever find Dad?”
And there it was, the anger born by the mark.
“It’s okay,” Cas said against his mouth. “It’s okay, Dean.”
Dean reached up a hand and gently ran his fingers over Cas’s face. Stubble scratched at the pads of his fingers but Dean liked the pull of it. He took in the bags under Cas’s eyes and the scab forming on his left cheek, but in searching Cas’s blue gaze he found concern there.
Dean was standing opposite him, looking at him in shock and wonder, as Castiel told him everything.
Jody is silent on the other end of the phone, but a pained sob crackles through the phone line and suddenly Claire’s voice is filling his ears.
“Yeah, you and Eileen work things out?”
“Well, you were all twitterpated, and I know you weren’t going to do anything about it, so I just thought I’d check the rules for you.”  She sounds almost crestfallen, and Dean takes a deep breath, knowing her heart was in the right place anyway.
“Cas’ true happiness was in telling you you were loved, not in having you love him back,” Eileen says, and Dean huffs out a puff of breath.
“Lunch.  I'm starving,” Dean smirks, turning for the house.  Cas hurries after him, making it to the door first since Dean paused to kick off his boots.
Doesn’t stop his mind from continuing to wander as they walk, thinking about the dusting of freckles, the too plush lips, those green eyes, and the cute way his blushes start from Dean’s ears then work their way to the rest of his face.
“My mother felt that, even now, the name should still carry weight.  That it should still be respected, and as a result, she was a stickler for order, a bit of perfectionist.  She insisted my brother Michael and I go to certain schools, get certain jobs, all so we’d be worthy of the Novak name.  I think she felt disappointed when Michael was born a beta, so she was kind of riding all her hope on me being an alpha. When I presented with my…
Problems with his meds don't explain why he'd made this random stranger a weird semblance of
He doesn’t really notice Cas moving them to the bed until his back hits the mattress and Cas tugs off the rest of his bloody clothes, boots and all.  The gash on his leg sticks to the denim as the pants come off and he cries out, the blood that was starting to scab over dripping down his calf. Cas is hovering over him where he’s kneeling between Dean’s legs, taking up his whole field of vision as his hand slides over the wound.  Dean grunts, a weird mixture of pain and arousal as Cas glowers at him.
“I’m okay," Cas assures him.  “I wasn’t expecting it to be so… easy.”  He meets Layla’s gaze and ducks his head when she gives him a knowing smile.
“Hey, it’s Dean.  I wanted to talk about something while it was fresh in my mind.” A pause while she answers, and Dean starts speaking again, but Cas is only half listening, focusing on setting water to boil for noodles and pulling out some of the fresh vegetables. Through the flow of Dean’s emotions in the back of Cas’ mind, he knows the conversation goes well, and by the time Dean is done, he’s served up a proper dinner for the two of them, Dean sniffing appreciatively as he walks into the room.
“Really?”  Cas turns over to face Dean, their legs still tangled.  “You want to take me, an alpha with hyperosmia, into a group of omegas?”
Eileen is his How.
"I suppose."  That was the best part about Cas' arrangement with his brother, but hearing the words come from Dean strikes something in him.
practically echoing in his ears, the scent of her hair as he tugged her in close.  Holding her again, knowing she was
They both float for a few minutes, sharing kisses, whispered affirmations.  Eventually, Cas slides out, pressing soft kisses in apology over Dean’s skin as he winces from the empty feeling.  Slowly, Cas lowers Dean’s legs, massaging the cramped muscles, fingers trailing down to his injured calf. A warmth washes over his skin and the wound heals fully, Cas’ lips tracing where it used to be.
“Yeah, the name sounds familiar,” Dean nods.
Sam’s on a night rotation for the weekend, so he’s already gone to work by the time Dean gets home from school.  Taking advantage of the empty apartment, Dean changes into sweatpants and a ratty old tshirt, ordering a pizza for dinner since Sam won’t be around to judge him.  He grabs a beer and has just popped it open when his phone rings. The ringtone (the Eleventh Doctor’s theme) tells him who it is without him even looking.
“Twelve hours, Dean,” Cas spits.  “You could have waited
“Never something I've pursued,” he answers, figuring there's nothing wrong with being honest.  “Why do you want to know if I'm mated?” Cas shouldn't ask, it's not his business anyway… but he has and now he waits for Dean's answer.  Dean takes the food off the heat and serves it, Cas grabbing forks as they both sit at the table.
“Shh,” Cas whispered, his voice was like a lullaby. “Close your eyes, Dean.” Dean obeyed, letting his eyes slide shut. Cas’s fingers moved from Dean’s hair to his forehead, but before Dean could let Cas send grace through him, he reached out a hand blindly towards the angel.
Sam sets his jaw and takes a deep breath, pulling himself out of the spiral before it’s too late.  Today he promised himself he would try not to linger on the memories.  He knows he’ll come to terms with them eventually, after everything he’s been through coping with trauma has become almost second nature.  But today, today he’s going to take a step in the direction of moving on.
Cas had been wondering about his name for weeks, and Dean wasn’t exactly what he was expecting, but it fit.  Simple, straightforward, yet it sat pleasantly on his lips, easy to say… Cas wants to smack himself for the direction his brain keeps turning.  He’d made an utter fool of himself, almost
Meg.  He has to tell Meg.
“Nothing, you're right, I'm sure it's a great car.  Sorry to tease.”
“Nah, nothing a little shower and a nap won’t fix.”  Jack’s face relaxes into a smile as Dean tosses his bag on the table.  Dean regrets that decision as a pain shoots up his arm from the movement.
When the bell rang, Dean called Jack over, Claire hesitating in the doorway until Jack waved her away.
"I mean, yeah, I guess," Dean mutters, glancing over at Cas.
Cas wakes up suddenly, adrenaline pumping through him.  For a moment he was back in the bunker, fighting his way to Dean in the crimson light. He can almost still smell the copper sharpness of blood from a guard’s busted face and the bitter scent of singed flesh from the stun gun he’d used.  There’s a thin layer of sweat covering his skin, and his scent is sharp enough to cut something.
“Stop pouting, I can hear it through the phone.”
“You should see the other guys,” Dean jokes.  Mary just gives him a
“But Jack was only half Angel.”
“Are you injured, Dean?” he asks.  Dean looks down at the mess he makes.
“Cas,” Dean rolls Cas over into his back, smiling down at him, “don’t ever change.”  Cas smiles, a soft shine in his eyes.
“Yeah,” Cas says quickly, climbing out of the car and heading for the stairs.  He pauses, turning back to look at Dean through the car window. “Thank you, for this.”  Dean smiles, and it should
“Sorry, I just...I didn’t really picture you doing that.”  Cas shrugs, and Dean smirks.
“`Course not," Dean gives him an amused look, "but it's nothing some stretching in the morning won't fix.  I'll be fine.” Dean is already turning to walk down the porch steps.
“Uh, yeah, yes,” Cas stammers nervously, hoping his scent isn't giving away exactly how nervous.
“How about you, huh?” Dean shoots back, gasping as Cas lowers his head to suck a new bruise into his sternum.  “You ran off last week to take on that demon boy band,
“Well, welcome to our home.” she gestures behind her, indicating that Cas and Dean should follow as she turns back for the gate.  Dean grabs their bags out of the Jeep and then grabs Cas’ hand with his free one, tugging gently in encouragement. Cas lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
“Nerd,” Dean chuckles.
He slips downstairs with their bags before Dean gets back from the shower, seeking out Charlie where she usually sets up shop in the kitchen.  Charlie was a bundle of energy for as long as Cas has known her, but she’s come
“It's my cousin’s home.  I've only lived here for a few years now.”  Cas downs the last of his tea before setting his mug in the sink.  “Let me make sure the bed is made." He leads Dean into the side hallway, pulling some pillows and blankets out of the linen closet.
“You just dumped all that on me and
Dean realizes what’s about to happen just before Cas sits up to align himself with Dean’s entrance.  His hands fly up to the headboard to anchor himself just as Cas slides inside him in one smooth thrust.  He’s not as prepped as he could be and the intrusion burns, but he’s bottomed enough lately that his body adjusts quickly, especially at the sight Cas makes as he hovers over him, still half dressed and eyes dangerous with all sorts of lusty emotions.
“Yes, he’s been decent company.”  Cas is looking up at Sam, thankfully, so he doesn’t see Dean blush.
Cas would be home waiting for him.
“Awesome, I just need to charge my phone for a minute so I can call a friend of mine."  The guy is gesturing back at the car as he steps closer and Cas takes a deep, calming breath through his nose.
“Did you...have you guys met before?” Sam wonders.  Cas fidgets with the strap of his bag.
“Shut up,” Dean grouses, turning and walking towards the cabin, holding Cas’ hand tight.  Cas can see the smile Dean doesn’t quite hide.
he come back from that, from staring down the absolute abyss of nothingness and loneliness?  How does he reconcile what his life was like before he knew it could all be taken away to after having everything taken from him?  The feeling of the floor suddenly dropping out from underneath him when Eileen stopped texting him, arriving to find her just
Dean smiles at him, soft and genuine. “Thanks, Cas.”  He squeezes past to walk down the hallway, brushing his arm on his way by, Cas' scent spiking with slight nerves.  Cas manages not to shiver at the touch, reminded again of the lack of scent coming off of Dean. The bathroom door closes, shaking him back into motion and Cas takes the linens to the bedroom.
“We’ll have all the time we need to catch up,” Dean says, patting Sam none too gently on the cheek.  “You go in there, see everyone, get a hold of Eileen.  I’ll be back.”
Fan-fucking-tastic.
The man, Dean’s father, steps forward one more time, holding out his hand.  “Name’s John Winchester.”
Cas' whole life had been nothing but discomfort and a struggle to maintain control.  He avoided strangers, and he hated surprises, much like the one Dean had given him appearing on his doorstep.  Yet all the worry he'd felt when Dean first arrived is gone now. He could smile and laugh around this total stranger, and in return, Dean didn't seem put off by Cas’ scent.  Not to mention the gorgeous green eyes, those kissable lips, the trim body, the graceful movements, the way he could cook, and the feel of his gaze on Cas’ body...
